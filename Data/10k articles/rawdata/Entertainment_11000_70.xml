'''''AdVenture Capitalist''''' is a [[free-to-play]] [[Incremental game|incremental]] video game developed and published by [[Hyper Hippo Productions]]. It was first released for [[Browser game|Browsers]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] in 2014, for [[iOS]] (published by [[Kongregate]]), [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]], and [[Linux]] in 2015, and for [[PlayStation 4]] in 2016. ''AdVenture Capitalist'' allows players to live like a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] and invest funds into certain products to generate revenue, by starting out with a single lemonade stand. The more revenue generated, the higher the player's cash is. A player can receive an angel bonus when resetting their progress, which provides a boost in all products' revenue for the next progress timeline. New areas of business have been added since the game's release, allowing the purchase of property on the Moon and Mars. A spin-off, ''AdVenture Communist'', was released on [[Steam (software)|Steam]] as [[early access]] on August 10, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/462930/AdVenture_Communist/ |title=AdVenture Communist |last= |first= |date= |work=Steam |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508232142/http://store.steampowered.com/app/462930/AdVenture_Communist/ |archivedate=2017-05-08 |deadurl=no |accessdate=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the completed game being released on iOS and Android on November 16, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/11/16/kongregate-and-hyper-hippo-launch-idle-clicker-adventure-communist/ |title=Kongregate and Hyper Hippo launch idle clicker AdVenture Communist |last=Takahashi |first=Dean |date=2017-11-16 |work=VentureBeat |accessdate=2018-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
There are three areas: Earth, Moon, and Mars. The player starts out on Earth with a single investment: a lemonade stand. Tapping it rewards money over time. When enough money is earned, more stands can be bought. Saving up allows the purchase of different investments at the cost of more time until payout. Once managers are hired for investments, they will run automatically, allowing successful idle play, even when offline. Upgrades can be bought to add multipliers to any investment.

When the player reaches 1 trillion dollars on Earth, they can start investing in a new area. Once invested in, an area will unlock in 72 hours, but the process can be sped up using video advertisements, angel investors/mega bucks, or gold. Gold can be bought via in-app purchase with real money and can be used for purposes such as gaining angel investors without resetting, instantly earning money for a day's worth of idling, and more. Mega Bucks are bought starting at 1 [[decillion]] of an area's currency, and their price is multiplied upon purchase by a fixed increment (the game describes this as inflation). When the player has 10 Mega Bucks, they can purchase a golden ticket, which when used on a single investment boosts its profits permanently by ×7.77. After one has boosted a whole planet, they will gain an additional ×10 boost, which adds (not multiplies) to a ×17.77 multiplier. This multiplier can be upgraded further using Mega Bucks.

Since October 2015, players can also play a limited-time special event, usually around holidays and other annual events, such as [[Halloween]] or [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]. They occur once per month for several days. These events are themed like the three areas, having their own set of businesses and upgrades, but are only available during that their event. If a player reaches at least one of the objectives of that event, they will get a badge shown in the Swag &amp; Stats page. As the player progresses in some events, they may acquire free gold or Mega Bucks based on unlocks, even a special badge that provides investment specific boosts when equipped. The events recycle, so if a player has missed a passed event, they will have a second opportunity to complete the tasks. Generally, these events last anywhere from three days to a week.

Since ''The Love Of Money'' update, the 'Swag &amp; Stats' section was renamed 'Career', along with the option for the player to make their character female.

A review from 148Apps had similar opinions, calling the game "upbeat" but "a waste of time."&lt;ref name="148Apps" /&gt;

'''Aller Media''' is a [[magazine]] publisher in the [[Nordic countries]], headquartered in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aller.dk/English/About%20Aller.aspx|title=About Aller|work=Aller|year=2012|accessdate=9 February 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207032406/http://www.aller.dk/English/About%20Aller.aspx|archive-date=7 February 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes ''Elle'', ''Cafe'', ''[[Familie Journalen]]'', ''[[Femina (Denmark)|Femina]]'', ''Allers'' and ''Se og Hør''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magpeople.com/w/?p=1018|title=Aller Magazine: magPeople|work=magPeople|year=2012|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Aller Media was founded in [[Copenhagen]] in 1873 by [[Carl Aller]] and his wife Laura Aller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carl Allers Etablissement A/S|url=http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/history/Ca-Ch/Carl-Allers-Etablissement-A-S.html|work=Reference for Business|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It expanded into [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] in the 1890s and into [[Finland]] in 1992. In August, 2009, Aller Press A/S changed its name to Aller Media A/S.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aller.dk/Presse/Presse%20og%20selskabsmeddelelser/Aller%20skifter%20navn%20til%20Aller%20media.aspx |title=Information about change of name from the company website (in Danish) |access-date=31 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707005556/http://www.aller.dk/Presse/Presse%20og%20selskabsmeddelelser/Aller%20skifter%20navn%20til%20Aller%20media.aspx |archive-date=7 July 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year Aller moved into a new headquarters at [[Havneholmen]]. The building is designed by [[PLH Architects]].

==Magazines and newspapers==
Aller's publications are among the most read in Sweden. It publishes 34 magazines every month which are read by over 4 million people including the best selling magazine in Sweden as of 2004, the TV Guide ''Se &amp; Hör'', which is published in Norway and Denmark as ''[[Se og Hør (Norway)|Se og Hør]]''.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

''Allers'' magazine is distributed in Norway and Sweden for the mature female market group. It traces its origins from the [[Denmark|Danish]] weekly ''[[Familie Journalen|Illustreret Familie-Journal]]'', founded in 1877 by Carl Aller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Oskar Bandle|author2=Kurt Braunmuller|author3=Ernst-Hakon Jahr|author4=Allan Karker |author5=Hans-Peter Naumann|author6=Ulf Teleman|title=The Nordic Languages 2: An International Handbook of the History of the North Germanic Languages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6b7WwBC5tRAC&amp;pg=PA1487|accessdate=24 November 2014|year=2005|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-017149-5|page=1487}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894 it moved base to [[Helsingborg]] and changed its name to the ''Allers Family-Journal''. In 1959 the name was changed to ''Allers Family Journal'', which in 1968 was shortened to ''Allers''. The original magazine was a pioneer in including crosswords and cartoons in magazines in Sweden. ''Allers'' is the oldest magazine still in circulation in Norway where it has been published since 1897.

In June 2013, Aller Media bought ''[[Dagbladet]]'' with online products from Berner Gruppen for reportedly about 300 million [[Norwegian kroner]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric B. Utheim and Line Midtsjø (21 June 2013):  [http://e24.no/media/haaper-aa-faa-fortsette-paa-dagbladet-fronten/20384659 Håper å få fortsette på  Dagbladet-fronten] {{no icon}} [[E24 Næringsliv|E24]], Retrieved 21 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2014 the company acquired several Finnish [[Women's magazines|women's]] and lifestyle magazines from [[Bonnier Group]], namely ''[[Costume (magazine)|Costume]]'', ''Divaani'' and ''[[Olivia (magazine)|Olivia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bonnier Publications sells Finnish lifestyle magazines|url=http://www.bonnier.com/news-press/News/2014/February/Bonnier-Publications-sells-Finnish-lifestyle-magazines/|accessdate=6 April 2015|work=Bonnier Group|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sweden, editorial offices are today (2009) located in [[Stockholm]], [[Göteborg]], [[Helsingborg]] and [[Malmö]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mynewsdesk.com/se/pressroom/picsearch/pressrelease/view/largest-nordic-publishing-house-allers-foerlag-launches-web-tv-with-picsearch-magazine-fiskejournalen-releases-professional-fishing-video-channel-299341 Mynewsdesk.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 Aller Media launched ''L33t Magazine'', an online [[English language]] publication focusing on [[esports]] and competitive [[video game]]s. The team is based in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1337mag.com/meet-the-team|title=Meet the Team|website=L33t Magazine|accessdate=1 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151108235202/http://1337mag.com/meet-the-team|archive-date=8 November 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company appeared to have halted publication of new articles on the ''L33t Magazine'' website after the end of 2015.

'''''Australia Calls''''' is a 1913 Australian [[silent film]] directed by [[Raymond Longford]] about the fictitious invasion of Australia by an unnamed Asian country.

The movie is not to be confused with Longford's 1923 picture ''[[Australia Calls (1923 film)|Australia Calls]]'' and is considered a [[lost film]].

Longford later claimed the film was the first Australian movie to have mass extras (from Sydney's Chinatown) and feature model photography, as well as being the first film in the world to show wireless.&lt;ref name="papers"/&gt; Film historians have said "the scale and blatant progpaganda of [the film]... made it the least typical of Longford's thirty narrative films".&lt;ref&gt;Graham Shirley and Brian Adams, ''Australian Cinema: The First Eighty Years'', Currency Press 1989 p 32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The film begins with a prologue, 'The Warning', showing a Sydney horse race, then a football match in front of thousands of spectators. Living on an outback station, Beatrice Evans ([[Lottie Lyell]]) rejects the advances of a suitor. An unnamed Asian country lands 20,000 troops (called "Mongolians") on the New South Wales coast, and Australia issues a call to arms, mobilising its forces. The invading army attacks Sydney, setting buildings on fire and taking over the Min, Treasury Building and wireless telegraph station. The rejected suitor turns traitor and Beatrice is captured by the enemy. However she is rescued by plane with the help of aviator William E. Hart and the Australians are victorious.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article10363264 "AMUSEMENTS." ''The Mercury (Hobart)'' 26 Feb 1914: 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

A contemporary review said "the synopsis contains scenes of Australians at play, at the races, at football, the call to arms, the burning of Sydney, the enemy in possession, Australian mobilising, the capture of the wireless station, treachery, in the hands of the enemy, Australian bushmen rallying, tapping the overhead telegraph wires, the charge of the lancers, and ride for life, William E. Hart (Australia's aviator) to the rescue."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article50745527 "PRINCESS THEATRE." ''Examiner (Launceston)'' 17 Feb 1914: 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cast==
*[[Lottie Lyell]] as Beatrice Evans
*Frank Phillips as Evans
*Alfred O'Shea
*George Wilkins
*William E. Hart as aviator
*Andrew Warr as Asian commander

==Production==
The movie was written by two journalists from the magazine ''[[The Bulletin]]'' and sought to exploit Australia's fear of the [[Yellow Peril]]. Filming was done with the assistance of the Australian Defence Department and took over a year to complete, including model work to convey the burning of Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Shirley and Brian Adams, ''Australian Cinema: the First Eighty Years'', Currency Press, 1989 p 32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article128376848 |title=It All Began With a Feature Movie On The Kelly Gang. |newspaper=[[The News (Adelaide)|The News]] |location=Adelaide |date=16 November 1946 |accessdate=20 February 2014 |page=2 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cast includes early Australian aviator William Edward Hart, who made the first cross-country flight in [[New South Wales]], and later tenor Alfred O'Shea. [[Ernest Higgins]] shot some aerial photography for the film on a flight with Hart. Scenes involving Hart were shot at Richmond.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hart-william-ewart-6592 William Ewart Hart] at ''[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Begleri''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: μπεγλέρι) is a small [[skill toy]] consisting of one or more beads at either end of a short string or fine chain. The toy can be flipped and twirled around the fingers to perform tricks. Begleri originated in Greece, and originally derived from the Greek rosary or [[komboloi]], which serve the function of worry beads, and are often flipped around to pass the time or keep the hands busy. While komboloi have beads forming a closed circle, begleri beads are threaded on an open strand, usually in a symmetrical formation, with equal weighting at either end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Komboloi|url=http://www.kombologadiko.gr/historyen.html|website=Kombologatiko|accessdate=7 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Begleri come in many forms, consisting of semi-precious stone or metal beads. They can be similar in form to the percussion instrument [[kashaka]], but are much smaller in size.

== Modern Begleri revival ==
Historically, begleri was associated with the Greek mangas subculture, and the rebetiko style of music, popular until the 1960s. In recent years, begleri has grown in popularity outside of Greece, as a skill toy and everyday carry item. This has led to a proliferation of begleri designs and styles, using all manner of modern materials. The recent uptick in interest among collectors and skill toy enthusiasts dates back to at least the early 2010s, when it began gaining popularity on hobbyist sites. As the popularity grew in online forums and social media, different styles of play began to emerge. A wide range of different styles of play and categories of tricks have developed, many of which can only be performed with relatively long-stringed begleri, termed "long game" by enthusiasts.

== Modern types of Begleri ==
Modern begleri as a skill toy has gained popularity with many people across the world. Due to the nature of play, begleri have shifted from the traditional ornate beads to simpler performance oriented beads. Two common begleri types are [[Monkey's fist|monkey-fist]] "beads", and solid type beads. Monkey-fist begleri are commonly made by people beginning to practice "slinging" the common term for begleri manipulation. Solid type beads are becoming more and more common, and there a few companies that are developing new geometries of beads based on feedback from consumers.

== In popular culture ==

Green]]'s thriller, The Trusted,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/books/the-trusted-20130406-2hd2t.html#ixzz2Q6yOtGvj|title=The Trusted|last=Dobbin|first=Winsor|date=2013-04-07|work=|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-05|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is almost always twirling a set of gold begleri in his fingers.

'''Bahānds''' ([[Devanagari]]: भांड, [[Urdu]]: بھانڈ, [[Gurmukhi]]: ਭਾਂਡ) are the traditional folk entertainers of [[India]], [[Bangladesh]], and [[Nepal]]. In India and Nepal, the Bahand are now an [[endogamy|endogamous]] Muslim community, which is no longer involved in their traditional occupation of folk entertainment.&lt;ref name="ref96mabaj"&gt;{{Citation | title=History of Indian theatre | author=Manohar Laxman Varadpande | publisher=Abhinav Publications, 1992 | isbn=978-81-7017-278-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZrjC24PuDQC | quote=''...

Payment for performances is usually voluntary: often, one performer goes around the audience collecting money on a "pay-what-you-can" basis while the others continue to perform.&lt;ref name="ref20pumic"/&gt; While most ''bahands'' belong to families that are engaged in folk entertainment as their hereditary profession, their specific art forms vary greatly by region, community and language. The term ''bahand'' itself can also mean both a specific dramatic story or an entire form/school of drama.

== Bahand of Uttar Pradesh ==

In [[Uttar Pradesh]], the Bahand are an endogamous Muslim community. Their ancestors were employed at the court of the various local rulers as folk entertainers, in particular at the court of the [[Nawabs of Awadh]]. Most Bahand in Uttar Pradesh are no longer involved with folk entertainment. What now binds the community is a sense of stigma attached to the community on account of their ancestral occupation. They are now mainly involved in wage labour; many [[Lucknow]] city are [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaw]] puller. Little is known about the origin of this community, other than that their ancestors were ''bahands''. The community has been granted [[Other Backward Classes|Other Backward Class]] status, which gives the community some benefits with regards reservation in public sector jobs. They are [[Sunni]] Muslims, and speak [[Urdu]], and rarely dialects of [[Hindi language|Hindi]]. The [[Naqqal]] sub-group has done better, and now prefer the self-designation Kashmiri Shaikh. They are now a community of successful businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;''People of India Uttar Pradesh'' Volume XLII Part One edited by A Hasan &amp; J C Das pages 261 to 262 Manohar Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bahand Pather of Kashmir==
[[File:Bhand Pather.jpg|thumbnail|Bahand Pather]]
''Bahand Pather'' is a ''bahand'' of the [[Kashmir]] region in which stories commemorating the lives of ''reshis'' (Sufi Sages, both Hindus and Muslims) or more contemporary real or fictional figures are enacted.&lt;ref name="ref31pixup"&gt;{{Citation | title=South Asian folklore: an encyclopedia : Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Sri Lanka |author1=Peter J.

At the heart of the form, though, is the broad, farcical playing of the maskharas, or clowns ...''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The storylines (or ''pathers'') are often humorous and satirical, and [[farce]] is an essential component of the plays.&lt;ref name="ref31pixup"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koausa.org/BhandPather/index.html |title= The Bhand Pather of Kashmir}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naqal of Punjab==
''Naqal'' (mimicry) is a strong ''bahand'' tradition in the Punjab region.&lt;ref name="ref20pumic"/&gt; The ''naqalchi'' (mimic, sometimes called the ''[[bahrupiya]]'') adopts the persona of a well-known person or character and improvises, using satire and farce extensively, to entertain the audience.&lt;ref name="ref20pumic"/&gt;

==The Ustad and jamoora format==
The ''ustad-[[jamoora]]'' format (''ustad'' means master in [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]], while ''jamoora'' is an assistant or follower who is usually younger than the ''ustad'') is a popular one in Hindi-speaking regions and involves only two ''bhand'' actors. Usually, the storylines consist of the ''ustad'' tutoring the ''jamoora'' to do or say something, and the ''jamoora'' responding with mechanical obedience with a subtle variation thrown in that creates a strong comical or satirical effect.

American comedian [[Bill Cosby]] was a popular spokesperson for advertising from the 1960s{{spaced ndash}}before his first starring television role{{spaced ndash}}until the early 2000s. He started with [[White Owl]] cigars, and later endorsed [[Jell-O]] pudding and gelatin, [[Coca-Cola]] (including [[New Coke]]), [[Texas Instruments]], [[E. F. Hutton &amp; Co.]], [[Kodak]], and the [[1990 United States Census]]. {{As of|2002}}, Cosby held the record for being the longest-serving celebrity spokesperson for a product, through his work with Jell-O. In 2011, he won the President's Award for Contributions to Advertising from the [[Advertising Hall of Fame]].

Cosby was one of the first black people to appear in the United States as an advertising spokesperson. He was known for his appeal to white consumers in the second half of the 20th century, in an industry seen as slow to accept diversity.&lt;ref name="adage-2009" /&gt; In spite of making contradictory soft drink pitches and endorsing a disgraced financial company, he continued to be considered effective and believable. In the 1980s, studies found Cosby the "most familiar" and "most persuasive" spokesperson, to the point where Cosby attributed his wealth to these contracts, as opposed to his television series. However, in 2014, allegations of sexual assault significantly damaged Cosby's public image; public opinion polling following the news placed him near the bottom of a list of 3,000 personalities, when rated on trust and effectiveness.

Public opinion of him dropped substantially in 2014, by many [[Bill Cosby sexual assault cases|sexual assault accusations]], the earliest of which dates back decades. More than 60 women accused him of [[rape]], [[drug-facilitated sexual assault]], [[sexual battery]], [[child sexual abuse]], and [[sexual misconduct]], although the [[statute of limitations]] had by then expired in nearly all cases. Cosby was found guilty of three counts of [[aggravated indecent assault]] in April 2018, and sentenced to 3 to 10 years in prison in September 2018.

Anthony Tortorici, director of public relations at Coca-Cola,  told ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' magazine in 1981 that the "three most believable personalities are God, [[Walter Cronkite]], and Bill Cosby."&lt;ref name="1981-12" /&gt; At the peak of his advertising career in the mid-1980s, Cosby had a [[Q Score]] of 70, meaning that 70&amp;nbsp;percent of those responding to a survey of 1,000 United States residents thought highly of him, thus deeming him the most familiar and persuasive endorser.&lt;ref name=538-dec5&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bialik|first1=Carl|title=Bill Cosby's Fall From Among The Most-Trusted Celebrities To The Least|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/bill-cosby-rape-allegations-most-trusted-celebrities/|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=FiveThirtyEight|date=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GodCountryCoke-362"&gt;Pendergrast, p. 362&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Cosby's score of 70 remains unmatched.

Professionally, Coca-Cola advertising director John Bergin considered Cosby the company's "greatest weapon"; he said, "magic happens when the camera starts." His enthusiasm was tempered on a personal level, finding him "inconceivably arrogant" and mentioned "blow-ups" on the set.&lt;ref name="GodCountryCoke-347"&gt;Pendergrast, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

One biographer of Cosby, Linda Etkin, said, "Cosby comes across as a father figure, a teacher, and a friend" in his advertisements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Etkin|first=Linda|title=Bill Cosby|year=1985|publisher=Modern Publications|isbn=0-87449-030-8|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Turner, in 1982 the marketing manager for Texas Instruments' consumer products group, said Cosby "represents comfort, and people trust him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wise|first=Deborah|title=Micro makers hike advertising budgets to woo more customers|journal=InfoWorld|date=8 February 1982|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eD4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA18&amp;dq=texas%20instruments%20bill%20cosby&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;q=texas%20instruments%20bill%20cosby&amp;f=false|accessdate=29 July 2011|publisher=Popular Computing, Inc.|location=Palo Alto CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, one educator asked for comment said he remembered Cosby as a "black male authority figure, one of those people who folks that don't live on the edges of the country think of as a good black guy; they trust that guy".&lt;ref name=forsomefans&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zernike|first1=Kate|title=For Some Fans, Accusations of Rape Crumble Bill Cosby's Wholesome Image|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/23/arts/bill-cosby.html|accessdate=7 December 2014|work=New York Times|date=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1988, a representative for Kodak said Cosby had become "synonymous with quality products and quality services".&lt;ref name="Jet-1988"&gt;{{cite journal|title = How Black Stars Help Sell Products On TV|journal = Jet|date = 8 February 1988|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=cLsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA60&amp;dq=texas+instruments+bill+cosby&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZNUyTsreHo-5twekzLn4DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEYQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=texas%20instruments%20bill%20cosby&amp;f=false|accessdate = 25 January 2013|oclc = 60630647}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ebony'' agreed, saying Cosby has the advantage of being able to be selective. Cosby said his belief in their product is an attribute, stating, "if I presented a Bill Cosby who didn't care, their sales would stop right there on the screen. Obviously, I could never do that. Once I believe in the product I aim to sell it, and that's what I think I do better than anybody".&lt;ref name="AAFPresidentsAward" /&gt;

An article in ''Black Enterprise'' said part of Cosby's mystique is "that he can endorse a number of products and still retain credibility in each individual sell".&lt;ref name="1981-12" /&gt; Shortly after being signed by Coca-Cola, Cosby appeared at a bottlers' convention. He refused to drink the bottle of Coke he carried on stage, saying, "I'm waiting for all the Jell-O pudding I ate to settle".&lt;ref name="1981-12" /&gt; Cosby said that in childhood, he experienced "periods of addiction" to Coca Cola, consuming fifteen bottles by 2 pm.&lt;ref name="GodCountryCoke-346" /&gt;

==Career in advertising==

===1960s===
[[File:Nat King Cole and Oscar Moore, New York, N.Y., ca. July 1946 (William P. Gottlieb 01541).jpg|right|thumb|Nat King Cole plays a piano, 1946, a photo pre-dating his television series.]]
The American advertising industry was initially reluctant to use black spokespeople for fear of angering white customers.&lt;ref name="wooallconsumers" /&gt; ''The [[Nat King Cole]] Show'' (1956-1957), the first nationally syndicated U.S. television series to be hosted by an African American, never found a national sponsor; after its cancellation Cole said, "Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark".&lt;ref name="adage-2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Miley|first=Marissa|title=Black Agency Employees Paid 20% Less Than Whites|journal=Advertising Age|date=8 January 2009|url=http://adage.com/article/news/study-ad-agencies-exhibit-pervasive-racial-discrimination/133638/|accessdate=25 January 2013|oclc=39911225|quote=Referencing Nat King Cole's comment that Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark, Mr. Mehri said, "They're going to be afraid of the sunshine we're going to bring to the industry."}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Henry|first=Mike|title=Black History: More Than Just a Month|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Plymouth UK|isbn=9781475802610|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LPgNRyfXF4gC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;dq=%22Madison+Avenue+is+afraid+of+the+dark.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GC-xUZvOIOjhyQHXsYCADA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Madison%20Avenue%20is%20afraid%20of%20the%20dark.%22&amp;f=false|date=27 December 2012}}; {{cite book|last=Giddins|first=Gary|title=Visions of Jazz:The First Century|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199879533|page=405|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JtEKSpyt2SUC&amp;pg=PA405&amp;dq=%22Madison+Avenue+is+afraid+of+the+dark.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9C6xUf_pNqL4yQHYmIDIDQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Madison%20Avenue%20is%20afraid%20of%20the%20dark.%22&amp;f=false|date=22 October 1998}}; the books say Revlon was the specific instigator of the remark.{{cite book|last=Henderson|first=Amy|title=On the air: pioneers of American broadcasting|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press for the National Portrait Gallery|isbn=9780874744996|page=140|editor=Smithsonian Institution Press for the National Portrait Gallery and Museum of Broadcasting|date=1 October 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cosby's first advertisement was for [[White Owl]] cigars. His agent approached them in 1965, before the debut of ''[[I Spy (1965 TV series)|I Spy]]'', but after several appearances on the late-night talk program ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', a signifier of success in American comedy. He told agent Norman Brokaw of [[William Morris Agency]] that he liked their tagline, "We're going to get you."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Whitaker |first1=Mark |title=Cosby: His Life and Times |date=September 16, 2014 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |isbn=1451697996 |page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosby later said there were no commercials "with a black person holding something, buying a product, so the absence of pictures, in retrospect, said a lot". Despite the stigma among advertisers around using a black spokesperson, sales of the product rose.&lt;ref name="AAFPresidentsAward"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crain|first=Rance|title=Bill Cosby Looks Back on His Life in Commercials|url=http://adage.com/article/news/bill-cosby-back-life-commercials/149599/|accessdate=12 August 2011|newspaper=Ad Age|date=28 March 2011|location=New York NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an entry in ''Ad Age Encyclopedia'', the public acceptance of Cosby and [[Robert Culp]] appearing as equals on ''I Spy'' made it possible for advertisers to show black people and white people together in their commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Archetype/Stereotype|url=http://adage.com/article/adage-encyclopedia/archetype-stereotype/98323/|accessdate=30 January 2013|newspaper=Ad Age Encyclopedia|date=15 September 2003|location=New York NY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Bill Cosby Radio Program'', which debuted in 1968, was sponsored by [[The Coca-Cola Company]].&lt;ref name="GodCountryCoke-346" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ccprogram" /&gt; The series was syndicated to over 200 radio stations by [[McCann Erickson]], Coca-Cola's advertising agency.&lt;ref name="ccprogram"&gt;{{cite web|last=Withers|first=L.

In 1974, Cosby began promoting [[Jell-O]] pudding for [[General Foods]].&lt;ref name="wooallconsumers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="companion"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Andrew F.|title=The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink|year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York NY|isbn=0-19-988576-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosby said comedian [[Jack Benny]], whose program the brand sponsored, was the only previous spokesman for Jell-O,&lt;ref name="dougshow"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cosby Part 5|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kUmDYdiYj4|work=Doug Miles and Don Henderson's radio show|publisher=WSLR Radio Sarasota|accessdate=3 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Kate Smith]], [[Lucille Ball]], and [[Andy Griffith]] have also pitched the brand.&lt;ref name="wiley"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Holly|title=Frommer's 500 Places for Food and Wine Lovers|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=0-470-48064-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gUGOKH5cHnwC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=jello+bill+cosby&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HEgEUda6IOT82gWbk4CgBQ&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=jello%20bill%20cosby&amp;f=false|page=58|date=8 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In previous campaigns since the brand's launch in 1902, it was targeted towards parents rather than to children, a practice from which the company departed in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Stephanie|title=Jell-O sales jiggle downward; X-treme products readied|url=http://adage.com/article/news/jell-o-sales-jiggle-downward-x-treme-products-readied/33243/|accessdate=30 January 2013|newspaper=Advertising Age|date=19 November 2001|location=New York NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cosby's early commercials were unscripted, but later were written by comedy writers. Cosby disagreed with the writers, who wanted to say the food was for when you were "hungry"; Cosby thought there was not enough substance to satisfy hunger and wanted to use the word "appetite".&lt;ref name="dougshow" /&gt; In 1979, General Foods introduced [[Pudding Pop]]s, the company's first frozen dessert product.

Cosby appeared in commercials for Coca-Cola's 1979 campaign, "Have a Coke and a Smile," and made a guest appearance at the Great Get-Together, a major bottlers' convention held that year.&lt;ref name="GodCountryCoke-346" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GodCountryCoke-324"&gt;Pendergrast, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt; This campaign continued into 1981.{{refn|Coca-Cola Canada commissioned a spot titled "Coke is winning", based on A.

His work in this decade was well received.

===1980s===

''Black Enterprise'' magazine found that Cosby was one of only a very few African Americans who could command among the highest fees paid for advertising spokespeople. The 1981 feature also highlighted how rare it was for African Americans to be hired for a complete campaign, as opposed to a single advertisement, despite an overall increase in opportunities.

Cosby returned as Coca-Cola's spokesperson in its 1982 "Coke Is It" campaign,&lt;ref name="GodCountryCoke-346" /&gt; a series of commercials mocking the [[Pepsi Challenge]].&lt;ref name="GodCountryCoke-346" /&gt; One advertisement in this series showed a [[Pepsi]] [[vending machine]] to mock the brand, which author [[Mark Pendergrast]] called "unthinkable".

In mid-1982, Cosby was hired by [[Texas Instruments]] to appear in television advertisements for the company's [[Texas Instruments TI-99/4A|TI-99/4A]] home computer.

[[File:New Coke can.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Spots with Cosby calling Pepsi too sweet were ill-advised, given the introduction of the reformulated sweeter tasting "[[New Coke]]".]]

In the 1990s, Bill Cosby was also the spokesperson for Service Merchandise. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Service Merchandise commercial|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vM-FiwgiWcU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Advertising Hall of Fame]] induction ceremonies on March 30, 2011, Cosby was the first winner of the American Advertising Federation's President's Award for Contributions to Advertising, for special achievements in the field.&lt;ref name="AAFPresidentsAward" /&gt;

==Criticism==
In 1973, ''[[The Village Voice]]'' writer Terry Guerin said Cosby was past his prime. Among the reasons, "making spokesman commercials for such established heels as White Owl cigars and Pan American airlines. He has evolved into a kind of self-parodying sap, the kind of flagrant, perpetual parader [[Sammy Davis, Jr.|Sammy Davis]] has always been".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Guerin|first=Terry|title=Transfiguration of Frazier &amp; Co.|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=k9RHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_YsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=bill%20cosby%20white-owl&amp;pg=6443%2C2785538 |accessdate=26 July 2011|newspaper=The Village Voice|date=10 May 1973|location=New York NY|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Noble Cos," a 1986 satirical editorial by [[Edward Sorel]] for ''[[The Nation]]'', was written in Cosby's imagined voice. It echoed the comments of other authors that Cosby had become out-of-touch with lower-class African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dyson|first=Michael Eric|title=Is Bill Cosby Right?: Or Has the Black Middle Class Lost Its Mind?|year=2006|publisher=Basic Civitas Books|isbn=0-465-01720-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rs5mrCyaaTEC|pages=83–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this sentiment, Cosby said in 1997, "So this buddy says, 'I didn't mind your commercials for Jello, Del Monte, Ford cars&amp;nbsp;... Ideal Toys, or Coca-Cola, although Coke does do business in South Africa&amp;nbsp;... But, Bill, why do commercials for those crooks at E. F. Hutton?' My buddy didn't understand my commercials improve race relations. Y'see, by showing that a black man can be just as money-hungry as a white man&amp;nbsp;... I'm proving that all men are brothers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Dyson|first = Michael Eric|title = Is Bill Cosby Right?: Or Has the Black Middle Class Lost Its Mind?|year = 2006|publisher = Basic Books|isbn = 978-0-465-01720-1|page = 288|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rs5mrCyaaTEC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=But,+Bill,+why+do+commercials+for+those+crooks+at+E.+F.+Hutton&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=207_ULDUK8mw2QXs8IHwBg&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=But%2C%20Bill%2C%20why%20do%20commercials%20for%20those%20crooks%20at%20E.%20F.%20Hutton}}; quote believed to have originated in "[http://business.highbeam.com/435553/article-1G1-56526077/sharing-humor-sharing-tears Sharing Humor, Sharing Tears]", ''St Louis Post-Dispatch'', 20 January 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Cosby told ''[[Black Enterprise]]'' magazine:
{{quote|In this business, many of us are well paid but we are not all that wealthy. You may read 'X-number of dollar goes to so and so,' but remember, everybody takes a cut – the lawyer, the agent, the publicist. If a company comes along and says 'We'd like you to talk about how much you enjoy wearing this warm-up suit,' and the money is right, I'm going to do it. Jell-O was a dessert in my house when I was a kid. My mom served Del Monte fruit cocktail when I was growing up. They want to pay me to say I eat these products, well, I eat them. I came out of a lower economic area, and this is money. This is a business&amp;nbsp;... show business. A great deal of our careers depends on keeping ourselves in the public eye. I think performers should take advantage of commercial offers if they're satisfied with the product.&lt;ref name=1981-12 /&gt;}}

===Sexual assault and rape allegations===
{{main|Bill Cosby sexual assault case}}
In October 2014, a stand-up comedy routine by [[Hannibal Buress]], addressing allegations of rape against Cosby, went viral on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Keefe|first1=Megan|title=Comic Hannibal Buress calls Cosby a "rapist"|url=http://decider.com/2014/10/21/hannibal-buress-calls-bill-cosby-a-rapist/?_ga=1.220824862.726639338.1417731143|accessdate=4 December 2014|work=Decider|date=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10, Cosby posted a message requesting [[Internet meme|meme]] images, using a hashtag of #CosbyMeme, on his [[Twitter]] feed.

The publicity surrounding the allegations had a drastic effect on Cosby's reputation, as seen in the following drop in his ratings. In March 2013, Cosby had a 76.3 rating on the [[Davie-Brown Index]], a rating of the public perceptions of roughly 3500 personalities published by [[Omnicom Group]] company [[The Marketing Arm]], placing him as the third most-trusted celebrity, behind Morgan Freeman and [[Mehmet Oz|Dr. Mehmet Oz]]. By November 19, this had fallen to 57.1, placing him at either the 2,626th spot&lt;ref name=538-dec5 /&gt; or 2615th,&lt;ref name="wsj-2615"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vranica|first1=Suzanne|title=Bill Cosby Falls From #3 to #2,615 in List of Most Trusted Celebrities|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/11/25/bill-cosby-falls-from-3-to-2615-in-list-of-most-trusted-celebrities/|accessdate=4 December 2014|work=Wall Street Journal|date=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; depending on the source. The same company's separate rating on who consumers view as an "effective product spokesperson" saw Cosby drop to 2,746th spot; at one point, he had been 5th.&lt;ref name="wsj-2615" /&gt; Awareness of Cosby increased from 63rd to 51st.&lt;ref name=538-dec5 /&gt; The Marketing Arm warns about misinterpreting the ratings fall; it said 900 celebrities were within the [[margin of error]] for Cosby's rating.&lt;ref name=538-dec5 /&gt; At the time of the accusations, [[E-Poll Market Research]] had not updated its scores; a [[Q Score]] for Cosby was not expected until 2015.&lt;ref name=538-dec5 /&gt; The executive vice-president of Q Scores Co. said polling in the midst of a scandal would likely overstate the score's longterm effects.&lt;ref name=538-dec5 /&gt; All three companies' scores are updated at different intervals, meaning they are not directly comparable.&lt;ref name=538-dec5 /&gt; Jell-O was relatively unaffected on social media by allegations against Cosby. The brand was mentioned in one percent of posts about Cosby, which was considered low.&lt;ref name="wsj-2615" /&gt; Still, negative connections continued, including by rapper [[Eminem]] in a [[freestyle rap]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sohh.com/eminem-proves-hes-still-got-it-blasts-bill-cosby-w-jello-o-freestyle-audio/|website=[[SOHH]]|title=Eminem proves he's still got it, blasts Bill Cosby w/ "Jello-o" Freestyle|date=July 23, 2015|last=Jones|first=Biz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an article by ''Food Drink and Franchise'' magazine pointed out moments in commercials that were awkward in retrospect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fdfworld.com/retailing/392/Six-Bill-Cosby-Jell-O-Commercials-That-Are-Just-Awkward-Now|website=Food Drink Franchise|title=Six Bill Cosby Jell-O Commercials That Are Just Awkward Now|first=Sasha|last=Orman|date=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3430">The '''Borzu Nama''' (pronounced as Borzū-Nāma or Borzū-Nāme) ({{lang-fa| برزونامه}}) is a [[Persian language|Persian]] epic poem of about 65,000 couplets recounting the exploits and adventures of the legendary hero Borzu, son of [[Sohrab]]&lt;ref name="IranicaBorzu"&gt;William L. Hanaway, "Borzu-Nama" in Encyclopedia Iranica.  [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/borzu-nama-epic-poem-1] accessed October, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Iranica2"&gt;BORZU-NĀMA (article 2) in Encyclopedia Iranica by Gabrielle van den Berg. [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/borzu-nama-2-epic-poem] accessed October, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and grandson of [[Rostam]].

==Plot==

[[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron]] identifies the author as 'Ata'i, who is further identified as 'Amid Abu'l 'Ala' 'Ata b. Yaqub Kateb Razi by Blochet.  He was a poet of the [[Ghaznavid]] court and died around 1078-1079.  The language of the Borzu-nama is characteristics of texts of the 11th century.  The story is versified in the same meter and style of [[Ferdowsi]]'s [[Shahnama]].  The Borzu-nama is possibly the longest of the post [[Shahnama]] epic poems and includes material from [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] national legends not used by [[Ferdowsi]].&lt;ref name="IranicaBorzu"/&gt;

The story starts with [[Sohrab]] the son of [[Rostam]]. On his way from [[Turan]] to fight the Iranians he marries a woman named Shahru.  Before leaving, he gives her a token to give to their unborn child.  The child is named Borzu by Shahru and she raises him without disclosing his father's identity.  The young Borzu is recruited  into [[Afrasiab]]'s, the King of Turan, army.  Borzu eventually forces his mother to reveal his father's name. On finding that it was [[Sohrab]], he sets off to battle [[Rostam]] to avenge his father's death.  [[Afrasiab]] then sends him with an army to [[Iran]], but Borzu is captured by Rostam's son [[Faramarz nama|Faramarz]] and taken to [[Sistan]].  Shahru is informed of Borzu's capture, and helps him escape.  He is recaptured by [[Rostam]], and not recognizing his grandfather, Borzu battles [[Rostam]].  His life is spared at the last minute when Shahru reveals their relationship.  Borzu and Rostam embrace and Borzu joins the Iranian forces.  [[Afrasiab]] learns of this and sends Susan-e Rameshgar, a musician and sorceress to capture Rostam and Borzu.  Afrasiab arrives with his army and the epic takes up a long series of battles and adventures that include famous Iranian and Turanian heroes from the Shahnameh, along with [[Daeva|Div]]s, [[Peri|Paris]] (fairies) and wizards.  The tale concludes with the death of Borzu at the hands of a [[Daeva|Div]].

== Editions ==
The Borzu-nama has not yet been published in a critical edition, but versions of the text have been included in the Shah Nama editions of both Turner Macan (pp.&amp;nbsp;2160–296) and Dabirsiāqi.&lt;ref name="Iranica2"/&gt;

==Possible influences==
Friedrich von Suhtschek, in a discussion of the Iranian sources of the Grail legend, claimed, but did not prove, that the Borzu Nama is the direct source of [[Wolfram von Eschenbach]]’s [[Parzifal]].

== History ==

Nude or sexualized female forms have been a theme of photography since as early as 1840.&lt;ref name="Warren2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Lynne|title=Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century Photography, 3-Volume Set|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cFVsBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA448|accessdate=31 December 2015|date=2005-11-15|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135205430|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early [[erotic photography]], such as [[French postcard]]s from the late 19th and early 20th century, [[pin-up girl]]s, and [[Hollywood]] culture have influenced the visual style of boudoir photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wgno.com/2014/07/18/a-peek-inside-boudoir-photography/|title=A Peek Inside Boudoir Photography|last=Sinkovits|first=Tanya|date=July 18, 2014|publisher=WGNO|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable early boudoir photographers include [[Albert Arthur Allen]], who photographed larger women against ornate backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malouf |first1=Caroline |title=Boudoir Photography |url=https://carolinemalouf.com/boudoir-blog/the-history-of-boudoir-photography |website=Caroline Malouf Photography |accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Boudoir photography was popularised in the millennium with the arrival of digital photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/businessclub/8216254/Tough-lessons-for-entrepreneurs-in-2010.html|title=Miss|last=Alexandra|first=Vince|date=|website=The Telegraph Newspaper|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It became popular with women seeking to create a private collection of professional studio portraits. Boudoir photography dates from the mid-1980s onwards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20089896,00.html|title=Now for Some Real Play Mates!

== Appeal ==

It is common for women to have boudoir photographs of themselves made as a gift to a partner, conventionally on the occasion of their engagement, marriage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.neerajagnihotri.com/boudoir-photography-india/|title=Luxury Boudoir Photography in India - Neeraj Agnihotri|work=NEERAJ AGNIHOTRI|access-date=2018-05-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; or before an enforced separation such as a military deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=HCcEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=%22boudoir+photographs%22+deployment&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4oN_6-oTKAhUL2R4KHdd1Dr8Q6AEIIzAB#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Centerfold|last=Surina|first=Echo|year=2009|work=Exquisite Weddings|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]] it became popular for brides-to-be to commission photoshoots as a wedding gift for the groom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://startups.co.uk/young-guns/alexandra-burns/|title=Miss|last=Vince|first=Alexandra|date=March 25, 2011|website=Startups|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boudoir photography is also sometimes given as a gift with the intention of re-affirming and encouraging the romance and sensuality between partners in a long-term relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/sep/02/boudoir-photography-orthodox-jewish-women|title=In the boudoir with Orthodox Jewish women |  work=The Guardian|last=Kanim|first=Debra|date=2 Sep 2015|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasingly, boudoir photography is seen as something that a person might do purely for their own enjoyment, for the pleasure and affirmation of seeing themselves as attractive, daring, sensual, and sexually-desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kentucky.com/living/health-and-medicine/article44037471.html|title=Boudoir photos help women reconnect with sexy side|last=Meehan|first=Mary|date=June 22, 2010|work=[[Lexington Herald-Leader]]|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.westernmorningnews.co.uk/posed-lingerie-celebrate/story-25965365-detail/story.html|title=I posed in my lingerie to celebrate ME!

== Styles ==

Boudoir photography encompasses a range of styles and moods. Named categories of boudoir photography include so-called "naughty girl", "fun and giggles", and "provocative and sensual", with varying degrees of explicitness and nudity.&lt;ref name="Lynch2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynch|first=Annette|title=Porn Chic: Exploring the Contours of Raunch Eroticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oasYAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT76|accessdate=31 December 2015|date=2013-08-15|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=9781472520142|pages=76–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Visually the genre is characterized by diffuse [[high-key lighting|high-key]] images&lt;ref name="Hewlett2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hewlett|first=Terry|title=Flash Photography: Art and Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7zOCBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=SA5-PA92|accessdate=31 December 2015|date=2014-07-31|publisher=Crowood Press, Limited|isbn=9781847977670|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; that flatter the appearance of skin, short focal distances, and shallow [[depth of field]],&lt;ref name="Lark2014"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lark|first=Jessica|title=Elegant Boudoir Photography: Lighting, Posing, and Design for Exquisite Images|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vb69BQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91|accessdate=31 December 2015|date=2014-05-13|publisher=Amherst Media|isbn=9781608957279|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; which together impart an intimate, "dreamy" mood. Other common styles include a low-key, deliberately grainy black-and-white, reflecting the influence of art nudes, early erotic photography, and [[film noir]].&lt;ref name="Lark2014" /&gt; Also common are poses and lighting setups intended to replicate the mood and appearance of classic pin-up photographs and paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=25 Amazing Boudoir Photography Techniques|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qymxcIKXCuIC&amp;pg=PA44|publisher=Edward Verosky|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hip hop DJs and [[turntablist]]s use the DJ mixer to play [[phonograph|record players]] like a musical instrument and create new sounds. DJs in the [[disco]], [[house music]], [[electronic dance music]] and other dance-oriented genres use the mixer to make smooth transitions between different [[sound recording]]s as they are playing. The sources are typically [[record turntable]]s, [[compact cassette]]s, [[CDJ]]s, or [[DJ#Software|DJ software]] on a [[laptop]]. DJ mixers allow the DJ to use [[headphone]]s to preview the next song before playing it to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itshousemusic.net|title=It's House Music (DJ equipment, DJ mixer, DJ controller..)|website=It's House Music|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160411052302/http://www.itshousemusic.net/|archivedate=2016-04-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most low- to mid-priced DJ mixers can only accommodate two turntables or CD players, but some mixers (such as the ones used in larger nightclubs) can accommodate up to four turntables or CD players. DJs and [[turntablist]]s in [[hip hop music]] and [[nu metal]] use DJ mixers to create beats, loops and "[[scratching]]" [[sound effect]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2fMpAAAAQBAJ|title=The Mobile DJ Handbook: How to Start &amp; Run a Profitable Mobile Disc Jockey Service|last=Zemon|first=Stacy|date=2013-07-24|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|year=|isbn=9781136117343|location=|pages=164|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
DJ mixers are usually much smaller than other mixing consoles used in [[sound reinforcement system]]s and [[sound recording]]. Whereas a typical [[nightclub]] mixer will have 24 inputs and a professional [[recording studio]]'s huge mixer may have 48, 72 or even 96 inputs, a typical DJ mixer may have only two to four inputs. The key feature that differentiates a DJ mixer from other types of larger audio mixers is the ability to redirect (''cue'') the sounds of a non- playing source to [[headphones]], so the DJ can find the desired part of a song or track and the presence of a [[crossfade (audio engineering)|crossfader]], which allows an easier transition between two sources (or, for [[hip hop music]] [[turntablist]]s, enables them to do [[scratching]] effects)..

A crossfader has the same engineering design as [[fader (audio engineering)|fader]], in that it is a sliding control, but unlike faders, which are usually vertical, crossfaders are usually horizontal. To understand the function of a crossfader, one can think of the crossfader in three key positions. For a DJ mixer that has two sound sources connected, such as two record turntables, when the crossfader is in the far left position, the mixer will output only turntable A's music. When the crossfader is in the far right position, the mixer will output only turntable B's music. When the crossfader is at its midpoint (which is always marked with a horizontal line), the mixer will output a blend of turntable A's music and turntable B's music. The other points along the crossfader's path produce different mixes of A and B.

DJ mixers typically have phono [[preamplifier]]s to hook up turntables. The signal that comes directly out of a vinyl turntable is too weak to be amplified through a [[PA system]]. Before a turntable can be usable in a mix, it needs to be preamplified. DJ mixers are also used to create [[DJ mix]]es, which are recorded and sold. DJ mixers usually have [[Equalization (audio)|equalization]] controls for bass and treble of each channel. Some 2010-era DJ mixers have onboard electronic or digital [[effects unit]]s such as echo or [[reverb]]. Some DJ mixers also feature a built-in [[USB]] [[sound card]] to connect to a computer running DJ software without requiring a separate sound card. DJ mixers typically have a microphone input, so that a [[microphone]] can be plugged into the mixer, enabling the DJ to announce songs or act as a [[master of ceremonies]] (MC) for an event. Some DJ mixers have a [[kill switch]], which completely cuts out a channel, or, on some models, completely cut out a frequency band (e.g., all the bass).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/How_to_DJ_properly.html?id=8ezrNAAACAAJ|title=How to DJ (properly): The Art and Science of Playing Records|last=Broughton|first=Frank|last2=Brewster|first2=Bill|date=2002|publisher=Bantam|isbn=9780593049662|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Cross. 2003, [http://blog.60works.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/DJ_Mixer_History.pdf Cornell University. ''A History of the Development of DJ Mixer Features; an S&amp;#x26;TS Perspective'' (PDF)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outputs==
The output from a DJ mixer is typically plugged into a [[sound reinforcement system]] or a [[PA system]] at a [[dance]], [[rave]], [[nightclub]] or similar venue or event. The sound reinforcement system consists of [[power amplifier]]s which amplify the signal to the level that can drive [[speaker enclosure]]s, which since the 1980s typically include both full-range speakers and [[subwoofer]]s for the deep bass sounds. If the DJ is performing a mix for a [[radio station]] or  [[television station]],  the output from the DJ mixer is plugged into the main [[audio console]] being used for the broadcast. If the DJ is performing a mix that is being recorded by a [[recording studio]], the output from the DJ mixer is plugged into the main audio console used for the recording, which is in turn plugged into the recording medium ([[audiotape]], [[hard disk]], etc.). In some cases, such as when a DJ is performing a set at a club for dancers that is also being simultaneously broadcast over the radio or television system or recorded for a [[music video]] or other show, the output from the DJ mixer is plugged into the sound reinforcement system and into the main audio console being used for the broadcast and/or recording. At club sets, some DJs may use a [[Foldback (sound engineering)|monitor speaker]] to hear the house's main mix. This monitor speaker can have its volume increased or decreased by the DJ as needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://musicgearblog.com/best-dj-mixers-reviewed/|title=Ultimate DJ Mixers on the Planet|last=V.K.|first=Shrodin|date=2018-09-21|work=MusicGear|access-date=2018-09-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Power==
DJ mixers have an [[AC mains]] plug that is connected to the wall to supply electric power for the unit. Some DJ mixers can take batteries, which enables users to mix songs outside or away from electric power sources, with the output being plugged into a portable [[boom box]] or other battery-powered sound system.

==History==
DJ mixing played a key role in the development of the African-American style of [[hip hop music]]. In hip hop music and occasionally in other genres that are influenced by hip hop (e.g., [[nu metal]]), the turntable is used as a musical instrument by [[DJ]]s, who use turntables along with a DJ mixer to create unique rhythmic sounds and other sound effects. Manipulation of a record as part of the music, rather than for normal playback or mixing, is called [[turntablism]].  The basis of turntablism, and its best known technique, is ''[[scratching]]'', pioneered by [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]]. It was not until [[Herbie Hancock]]'s "[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]" in 1983 that the turntablism movement was recognized in popular music outside of a hip hop context. In the 2010s, many hip hop DJs use DJ CD players or digital record emulator devices to create scratching sounds; nevertheless, some DJs still scratch with [[vinyl record]]s.

DJ mixing also played a key role in [[disco]] music in the 1970s. In disco clubs, DJs would use mixers to transition seamlessly from one song to another and create a mix of songs that would keep the dancers energized. One of the pioneers of DJ mixing equipment design was [[Rudy Bozak]]. Beatmatching and [[beatmixing]] with a DJ mixer were first used to encourage dancers not to leave the dancefloor between songs. By beatmatching song A and song B, a DJ can transition seamlessly between two songs, without creating a break in the music. Typically, when a DJ is using beatmatching, they will let song A play until it nears its end. As song A is playing, the DJ "cues up" song B in their headphones and adjusts the speed of record player B until the beats of song A and song B are synchronized ("synced up"). Then, once the two songs' beats are synchronized, they can slowly fade in song B while song A is nearing its ending. In the 2000s, DJ mixers have been used for [[harmonic mixing]].

'''''Dino Run''''' is an [[United States|American]] independent Flash game created by [[PixelJAM Games|PixelJAM]] and [[XGen Studios]], released on April 30, 2008, in which the player steers a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' through increasingly dangerous side-scrolling landscapes to escape an impending "wall of doom". The game uses simple [[pixel art]] and [[8-bit (music)|8-bit sound]] to replicate the style of 1980s arcade games. Expanded and improved versions of the game were later released for [[Macintosh]], [[Personal Computer|PC]], and [[Linux]] under the titles ''Dino Run SE'' and ''Dino Run DX''. alternate version of the game include: ''Dino Run: Marathon Of Doom,'' and ''Dino run: Enter Planet D''of-doom)

==Gameplay==
The playable [[dinosaur]] is controlled with the [[arrow keys]] or WASD keys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.e4.com/game/dino-run/review.e4 Games - Dino Run - Review - E4.com -]&lt;/ref&gt; The object of the game is to escape a "wall of doom" also known as "the apocalypse" which resembles a [[pyroclastic surge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pc.ign.com/objects/143/14321686.html IGN: Dino Run]&lt;/ref&gt; Meteors strike the ground as the player runs from left to right through landscapes populated by panicking dinosaurs of many species. Success is achieved by reaching "sanctuary" alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.igf.com/php-bin/entry2009.php?id=456 The 12th Annual Independent Games Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; Along the way, the player can choose to collect eggs and devour bones to advance their dinosaur's individual evolution (enhancing attributes like jumping height, strength, rate of acceleration and top running speed). There are four levels of difficulty: easy, medium, hard, and insane. Throughout the Challenge levels (2, 3, 4, 5, Apocalypse, (hard and medium mode only) Beyond Apocalypse (insane mode only) and some speed runs, the player can collect super eggs which grant additional score and [[DNA]]. There are a total of 10 Super eggs that can be obtained. At first, the game only featured a single Challenge game mode. Later versions featured a Speedrun mode, where the player was able to unlock numerous unique levels by exchanging bones collected during previous plays. In 2010, a new mode for the game was announced - Planet D, a set of "weird" levels, which are similar to the levels in the Challenge mode, but alter the physics of the game in various ways. before the release of Dino Run DX, (September 2015) the difficulty level for Planet D could not be changed. Later the same year,(2010) a [[multiplayer]] mode was added. In 2013, upon the official release of Dino Run SE, the game became a commercial release.

In July or August 2015, a new version entitled ''Dino Run DX'', was released, along with the campaign for it in August 28, 2015 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet|user=doomsurf|author=Dino Run Central|number=633704882512494592|date=18 August 2015|title=We've actually already soft-launched the campaign, but the URL is secret. it's not hard to find, though... :)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2015, it was released on the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] platform, and has received further updates, including a set of special Halloween-themed levels, freerun mode, being able to have 6 players in one multiplayer race, improved sprites, multicolored dino NPCs, and 60 new hats based on other indie games.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pixeljam.com/dinorun/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2018}}

===Milestones===
When the player completes a certain [[milestone]] or goal, they receive awards of bones, DNA, and points for their stats, as well as a trophy. [[Trophies]] can be viewed in the awards section of the stats menu, and they come in three levels depending on the level of skill the trophy was achieved with: bronze, silver, and gold.

== Reception ==
In the first three months following its release in the Steam marketplace, ''Dino Run DX'' was reported by [[Steam Spy]] to have accrued between 5,000 and 9,000 owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dino Run DX -|url = http://steamspy.com/app/248330|website = SteamSpy - All the data about Steam games|accessdate = 2015-12-27|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Hill Climb Racing''''' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] physics based driving game by Fingersoft. It was released on [[Google Play]] and  for devices using Apple's [[iOS]] in 2012. During its first year of release it was downloaded over 100 million times.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtv.fi/uutiset/it/artikkeli/oululaista-hittipelia-ladattu-vuodessa-yli-100-000-000-kertaa/2368872&lt;/ref&gt; Combined with its sequel, Hill Climb Racing 2, the entire franchise surpassed 1 billion downloads in April 2018. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.pocketgamer.biz/interview/68010/fingersofts-hill-climb-racing-franchise-rolls-past-one-billion-downloads&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
 
The object of the game is to collect coins while driving through racing stages. Driving consumes gas or battery for electric powered vehicles (even if you're not moving), which players can replenish by picking up gas canisters or batteries along the way. The player can "die" in various ways, such as if they run out of gas or hit the [[Avatar (computing)|avatar's]] head on the ground or ceiling (in levels such as Cave). Coins may also be earned by performing "tricks", difficult maneuvers in the air, or by reaching set distances during given stages. Coins may be spent on upgrades, or to unlock new stages and vehicles. Different stages have different attributes, such as different gravity, traction, terrain (elevation) or obstacles that will slow the player down.

=== Garage ===
The Garage was a new element of Hill Climb Racing introduced in Version 1.31.0, and it allowed players to make their own custom car based on the use of 'parts'.&lt;ref name="neckflip.wixsite.com"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://neckflip.wixsite.com/hillclimbracing/garage | title=Hill Climb Racing - Garage - wixsite.com | publisher = Wixsite.com | accessdate= 8 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Gems were also introduced as the 'premium' currency of the game. Gems can be found on the stage, before every second group of coins, unless there is a Gas canister. The Garage introduces the use of Cards, which are used to unlock and upgrade parts. Initially, the Garage costs 300 gems to unlock. Gems can be used to purchase Chests, which contain more cards of the four rarities, Common, Rare, Epic, and Legendary. Each of the custom parts has a special characteristic, such as '-50% fuel' or '+80% power'. A Gift chest is available for every new stage or car purchased, and usually contains about 3 cards. A Free chest is available every 4 hours and usually contains about 5 cards. The Free chest requires an Internet connection to claim. Version 1.32.1 saw the introduction of Boosters. Boosters add a few seconds of fuel time to allow you to drive extra meters, for 30 gems each.

== ''Sequel'' ==
Hill Climb Racing 2 was released to Android devices on November 28th 2016, to iOS in December 2016 &amp; to Windows 10 on March 23rd 2018. It has since been downloaded over 100 million times on the Google Play store alone &amp; is the all time top grossing racing game for the platform.&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fingersoft.hcr2&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt; The sequel introduced several new features including races, structured cups, challenges, special events and multiplayer. It also introduced all new vehicles and tuning parts as well as a large amount of cosmetic player and vehicle customization.

=== Multiplayer ===

Multiplayer within the game is asynchronous &amp; takes place across several different multiplayer modes. Fingersoft has stated that they are working on developing real time multiplayer for the game, to be released in a future update.

* '''Cups''' - Four people compete on several tracks, over a set distance, to complete it in the fastest time. Performing well in a cup boosts your rating, which is used to advance to higher leagues and unlock new cups.
* '''Challenges''' - Structured daily challenges that require you to take on the ghost of a particular person on a specific track using their exact same vehicle load-out. You can also record and share your own ghosts with friends as challenges.
* '''Events''' - Events are weekly global events that pit players from all over the world against one another in an attempt to perform a specific task, not necessarily related to racing. These have included tasks such as long jump, downhill skiing, kicking a soccer ball, running from zombies and more.

Multiplayer also encompasses a friends list. With random daily and weekly challenges for you and your friends to compete against one another. Currently this is handled by exchanging generated friend links outside the game. Fingersoft has stated that they are working on updating this and adding a more robust friend/teams system in the future.

&lt;!-- Note that the year, reflect the year the technology were introduced, NOT the example product! --&gt;

Electrically operated [[display device]]s have developed from electromechanical systems for display of text, up to all-electronic devices capable of full-motion 3D color graphic displays.  Electromagnetic devices, using a solenoid coil to control a visible flag or flap, were the earliest type, and were used for text displays such as stock market prices and arrival/departure display times. The [[cathode ray tube]] was the workhorse of text and video display technology for several decades until being displaced by plasma, liquid crystal ([[Liquid crystal display|LCD]]) and solid-state devices such as [[Light-emitting diode|LED]]s and [[OLED]]s. With the advent of microprocessors and microelectronic devices, many more individual picture elements ("[[pixel]]s") could be incorporated into one display device, allowing graphic displays and video.

== History ==
One of the earliest electronic displays is the [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT), which was first demonstrated in 1897 and made commercial in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Cathode Ray Tube and its Applications|journal=International Journal of Innovative Research in Technology|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CRT consists of an [[electron gun]] that forms images by firing electrons onto a [[phosphor]]-coated screen. The earliest CRTs were monochrome and were used primarily in [[oscilloscope]]s and black and white televisions. The first commercial colour CRT was produced in 1954.&lt;ref name="monitornerds"&gt;[https://www.monitornerds.com/history-of-computer-monitors/ – monitornerds.com – History of PC Monitors]&lt;/ref&gt; CRTs were the single most popular display technology used in [[television set]]s and [[computer monitor]]s for over half a century; it was not until the 2000s that LCDs began to gradually replace them.

A derivative of CRTs were [[storage tube]]s, which had the ability to retain information displayed on them, unlike standard CRTs which need to be refreshed periodically. In 1968, [[Tektronix]] introduced the [[Direct-View Bistable Storage Tube]], which went on to be widely used in oscilloscopes and [[computer terminal]]s.&lt;ref name="medical-answers.org"&gt;[http://www.medical-answers.org/hd/index.php?t=Tektronix+4014 medical-answers.org – Tektronix 4014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322134634/http://www.medical-answers.org/hd/index.php?t=Tektronix+4014 |date=2012-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''InnoGames GmbH''' is a German [[video game developer]] based in [[Hamburg]]. Founded in 2007, it focuses on the development of [[Browser game|browser]] and [[mobile game]]s. The company now has more than 200 million registered players and by 2017, it reached a revenue of {{Euro|161.5&amp;nbsp;million|link=yes}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=InnoGames reports revenue growth of 24% last year, up to €161.5m|date=20 February 2018|url=https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2018-02-20-innogames-reports-revenue-growth-of-24-percent-up-to-161-5m|publisher=[[gamesindustry.biz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2003, founders Eike and Hendrik Klindworth created and released the browser-based online game ''[[Tribal Wars]]'' as a hobby project. At the end of 2005, the game reached more than 50,000 active players and today has a total of 55 million registered players.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://2p.com/34601305_1/Tribal-Wars-2-Launched-on-iOS-Features-Real-time-And-Strategic-Battles-Online-by-crazy-guy.htm |title=Tribal Wars 2 Launched on iOS, Seamlessly Sharing Data With Android and Browser |last= |first= |date=24 June 2015 |website=2p.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the success, the three founders decided to work full-time on the development and publishing of browser games. Then in early 2007, InnoGames was founded to handle the operation and continued development of the [[TribalWars|Die Stämme]] (English name Tribal Wars). Since then, the company has developed new games and publishes their games worldwide.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{citation |title=History: Innogames. |date=28 Aug 2012 |url=http://corporate.innogames.com/en/history.html |publisher=InnoGames |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813073954/http://corporate.innogames.com/en/history.html |archivedate=13 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company released its second game, The West, in 2008. That same year InnoGames moved to Hamburg-Harburg and hired additional employees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; As the company continued to grow, they released their third game, Grepolis, on 2009. Since 2013, Grepolis is playable as an app for iOS and Android devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://gamecry.com/blog/grepolis-app-iphone/ |title=Grepolis App Now Available on iPhone |last= |first= |date=4 September 2013 |work=GameCry.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first city-builder, Forge of Empires, was published in 2012. The game includes a journey through time that begins in the Stone Age and guides the player through the ages of human history. As of late-July, 2018, the latest era is the Virtual Future, but further extensions are planned. Forge of Empires was awarded the German Computer Game Prize in 2013 as the best browser game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://de.mmooftheyear.com/hall-of-fame |title=MMO of the Year Hall of Fame |last= |first= |date= |website=MMO of the Year|access-date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 5 June 2014 the game is also playable as an app on the iPad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/innogames-brings-forge-of-empires-to-ipad/ |title=InnoGames brings Forge of Empires to iPad |last=Shaul |first=Brandy |date=5 June 2014 |work=ADWEEK|access-date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPhone version followed on September 2014 &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.technologytell.com/apple/141070/forge-empires-now-available-iphone/ |title=Forge of Empires now optimized for iPhone |last=Marceau |first=Erica |date=29 September 2014 |work=Technology Tell|access-date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Android version on 25 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blog.forgeofempires.com/?p=1063 |title=Forge of Empires Comes to Android |last= |first= |date=25 March 2015 |website=Forge of Empires Blog|access-date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Forge of Empires' Android version in 2015, the German developer published its second city-building MMO, Elvenar in April&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mmos.com/review/elvenar |title=Elvenar Overview |last= |first= |date= |website=MMOs.com|access-date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further growth===
In May 2010, the investor Fidelity Growth Partners Europe (FGPE) joined InnoGames with a minority share. Also in 2010, former [[Electronic Arts]] executive Gerhard Florin joined InnoGames as Chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2011-02-02-florin-takes-chairman-role-at-innogames |title=Florin takes chairman role at InnoGames |author=Matt Martin |publisher=GamesIndustry.biz |date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2016, MTG (Modern Times Group) acquired 35% of the German free-to-play developer.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2016-10-13-mtg-acquires-35-percent-of-innogames-for-90-million |title=MTG acquires 35% of InnoGames for €90 million |last=Handrahan |first=Matthew |date=13 Oct 2016 |website=gamesindustry.biz|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2016 was also InnoGames' most successful year, having a 68% year-on-year growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.develop-online.net/news/innogames-post-record-financials-after-a-decade-of-year-on-year-growth/0229292 |title=Players managed 600m hours of gameplay on InnoGames titles in 2016 |last=Tucker |first=Jake |date=7 Feb 2017 |website=Develop|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, InnoGames acquired Wooga's strategy game Warlords, promising a relaunch of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/02/23/innogames-acquires-woogas-strategy-game-warlords/ |title=InnoGames acquires Wooga's stratgy game Warlords |last=Takahashi |first=Dean |date=23 February 2017 |work=VentureBeat|access-date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on 2 May 2017 the Swedish Company MTG increased its stake in InnoGames by buying 51% of the company &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.mmobomb.com/news/swedish-entertainment-company-buys-51-stake-innogames/ |title=Swedish Entertainment Company Buys 51% Stake in InnoGames |last=Winter |first=Jason |date=2 May 2017 |work=|access-date=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile initiative==
The first title that the company launched on mobile platforms was Tribal Wars, its founding game. ''Grepolis'', another of its strategy browser titles, was also launched onto mobile platforms in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=E3 – InnoGames' Growth &amp; The Move to Fully Cross-Platform Experiences.Two of six games have a mobile app. |publisher=RTSGURU |date=26 June 2013 |url=http://www.rtsguru.com/article/6090/E3-InnoGames-Growth-The-Move-to-Fully-Cross-Platform-Experiences.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally in 2014, [[Forge of Empires]] was also converted to tablet and mobile &lt;ref&gt;us.forgeofempires.com&lt;/ref&gt; and increased the company's revenues. InnoGames managed to transition from browser to mobile, even as other studios have faltered. The company now has four studios which develop and maintain their strategy games.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite focusing on mobile, their CEO has said that the company will continue developing and maintaining browser games in the future &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.f2p.com/interview-with-hendrik-klindworth-ceo-of-innogames/ |title=Interview with Hendrik Klindworth, CEO of InnoGames |last= |first= |date=10 Oct 2015 |website=F2P.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jay Jason''' (1915 – 2001) was an [[United States|American]] [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] who continuously performed in the show-business industry from 1933 to 2000.

==Early life==

Jay Jason's grandparents were from Eastern Europe and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Grosswirth, Raymond. [http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~grosswirth/ancestry.htm "My family ancestry"]. An Ancestry.com community. Retrieved on 2011-11-24.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, Lina and Ben, had six children. Jay Jason's interest in show business began when he would imitate the dialects of some of the residents from different countries who lived in boarding houses his parents owned. Born in  [[Rochester, NY]], Jay Jason attended the [[University of Rochester]] where he majored in languages. He traveled to Buffalo for amateur shows, and success in these comedy contests led him to pursue a career as an entertainer.&lt;ref&gt;Jason, Jay. (November 28, 1960). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uRVSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EXcDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3577,4267830&amp;dq=jay-jason&amp;hl=en "My Favorite Jokes"]. ''[[Parade (magazine)]]'' in ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]''. Retrieved on 2013-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early comedy career==

Barely 19 years of age, he left the University of Rochester after two years for his first major club date, and changed his name from Jonas Levy to Jay Jason (sometimes in the media his last name was spelled Jayson). It was a common practice in those days for Jewish entertainers to change their names, to be more accepted. He performed throughout the Midwest during the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;Herzog, Buck. (March 23, 1936). "Up and down amusement row". The Milwaukee Sentinel. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; During World War Two, he entertained for the USO,&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=PMwpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=rv8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2715,2156811&amp;dq=jay-jason+comedian&amp;hl=en "Girls and mirth on USO show".] (March 17, 1943). ''Toledo Blade''. p 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and during one show, he performed in front of hundreds of Hollywood and night club personalities including Red Skelton and Mickey Rooney.&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/open?id=0Bz4gyjhP7mm3NDNiY2ZiMjEtMDNhMi00MjI1LWI1MTItOTJhZTFiZGFiZDAz "Club Executive: Mike, Mask, &amp; Baton".] (Feb. 1962). Retrieved on 2011-11-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, he continued to entertain in the Midwest.  In a 1950 Columbus, Ohio, newspaper article, reporter Herb Christopher calls Jay Jason "a rising star," and as “the current Palm Garden Headliner… (he) finds many calls for guest appearances, benefit performances. Local television guest shows also come all too easy…”&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, Herb. (May 20, 1950).

Retrieved on 2012-02-17.&lt;/ref&gt; such as a 1951 article in the Toledo Blade: “JAY JASON. This well known comedian, who has played many engagements in Toledo and has one of the largest night club followings…" &lt;ref&gt;”Lilgallen, Dorothy. (Feb. 12, 1951).

Favorite back at Kasee's".] ''Toledo Blade'',  p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later comedy career==

From the 1950s to the late 1990s, Jason was one of the most enduring and recognized performers at [[Catskill Mountains]]' resorts. He played frequently at the Granit, Concord, [[Kutsher's Hotel]], the [[Nevele]], The Laurels Hotel and Country Club, The Pines Resort, Raleigh, [[the Overlook]], the Tamarack Lodge, Stevensville, the Windsor, and [[Grossinger's Catskill Resort Hotel]].

Jason's humor had self-deprecating aspects, and all subjects were grist for his comedy routines.

Da Capo Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "Comedians are like the jazz musicians of the Borscht Belt, ... then there's Ralph Pope, Jay Jason, Lenny Rush, and Mickey Marvin...they’re incredible. And they do improvise, within a set form. They work with a set number of variables—like a musician would with, say, twelve notes—and they shift the order of things according to how the audience is reacting. They usually start out the same and have a big thing they do at the end that brings it to a peak and lets then bow out gracefully. Like a final coda or cadenza. But in the middle, you never know where they’re going next. That’s the exciting part".

==Personal life==
Jay married Lynn Peltz in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;Woodbury, Mitch. (Jan. 14, 1948). [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LfApAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=_v8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3866,6289524&amp;dq=jay-jason+comedian&amp;hl=en "Screen and stage news"]. ''Toledo Blade'', p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; and had two children named Diana and Leonard. After moving throughout the Midwest for much of his early career, in the mid-1950s, Jay and Lynn settled in [[Teaneck]], NJ, which allowed Jason easy access to the Catskills Mountains.

A number of comedians worked for Jason over time as drivers to the Borscht Belt hotels, including the comedian [[Kenny Kramer]], who was used as the basis for the character from the American sitcom ''[[Seinfeld]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Max. (July 2, 2004). [http://www.forward.com/articles/4939/ "Giving 'Seinfeld' fans a taste of reality, Kramer-style"]. ''The Jewish Daily Forward.''&lt;/ref&gt; Kramer is quoted as saying: “Through a friend of mine, I ended up getting a job as a chauffeur for a comedian named Jay Jayson,who was very popular in the Catskills. I used to drive Jay to his gigs, and carry his wardrobe, and I started writing jokes for Jay. Jay is doing my jokes    and they’re getting great laughs, and I realize, hey, I could do these jokes myself. So on November 7, 1971, I stepped on a stage for the first time as a comedian…”&lt;ref&gt;Mulcahy, Lisa. ”[https://books.google.com/books?id=uYb2UOgc_VgC&amp;pg=PT121&amp;lpg=PT121&amp;dq=%22jay+jayson%22+comedian+catskill+mountains&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yYqXX1iIwb&amp;sig=lQAyHKCcrZPe52mRJbgiT077hE4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RfUvUOn3MKqqyAHeqYGoDA&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jay%20jayson%22%20comedian%20catskill%20mountains&amp;f=false  The actor's other career book: Using your chops to survive and thrive]”. New York: Allworth Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Jason's nephew, Sid Roth, host of a noted messianic radio and television show,&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Sid. (June 2, 2014).“[http://www.itssupernatural.org/sid-roth/our-guests-marty-jennifer-goetz/ Sid Roth Hosts It's Supernatural]” It's Supernatural.&lt;/ref&gt; also drove Jason to the hotels in the Catskills.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Sid. "There must be something more". Shippensburg, PA: Destiny Image Publishers, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason was well-liked among entertainers. This is illustrated by a newspaper story about his son's bar mitzvah: "The boy’s father is the current comedy star at the Latin Quarter in New York city. Many show business personalities attended  the service including [[Jackie Mason]], [[Phil Foster]], [[Norman Dean]], Lew Black, Davey Starr, [[Jack Kahane]], Corbett Monica, [[Gene Baylos]], [[Marilyn Maxwell]], Tony Drake, Laura Lane, Tina Robin and Bea Kalmus."&lt;ref&gt;"Bar Mitzvah. Leonard Jason observes rites in Teaneck Community Center". (March 12, 1962). ''[[The Record (Bergen County)]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;  At his daughter Diana's wedding, comedians who attended included: Reginald Stanbach, Lou Menchell, Allan Tresser, Dusty Brooks, Al Bernie and Murray Waxman.&lt;ref&gt;"Comics gather for wedding". (Dec. 26, 1971). ''Sunday News. New York's Picture Newspaper'', p. J36.&lt;/ref&gt; Jason associated with other leading comics (e.g., [[Don Rickes]], [[Morty Gunty]], etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Earl.

[[File:Sanguosha.JPG|thumb|A LTK Game]]
'''''Legends of the Three Kingdoms'''''&lt;ref&gt;[http://detail.tmall.com/item.htm?spm=a1z10.3.w17-2877460756.15.aPutNw&amp;id=20617440578&amp;_u=2d5chp9ef6 LTK Official English Edition in Taobao]&lt;/ref&gt; ({{zh|t=三國殺|s=三国杀}}; literally '''Three Kingdoms Kill'''), or sometimes '''Sanguosha''', '''LTK''', '''3KK''' for short, is a Chinese [[card game]] based on the [[Three Kingdoms]] period of China and the semi-fictional novel [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] (ROTK). The rules of the basic LTK are almost identical to the rules of the older Italian card game [[Bang! (card game)|Bang!]]. LTK was released by YOKA games (游卡桌游) on January 1, 2008, and has been followed to date by a total of seven official expansion sets, an online version '''LTK Online''', as well as a children's version '''LTK Q Version'''. There are self-created cards by players, but these are mostly unofficial.

LTK initially began with a strong following in China since the entire game is in Chinese. Sales of LTK totaled 20 million yuan in 2009, and 100 million yuan in 2010.&lt;ref name="UC Berkeley"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/world/2012-08/03/content_15641747.htm|title=UC Berkeley takes novel approach to card game}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the game has begun to reach an international audience after players began translating the game into the English language and posting these translations on blogs and forums. Site visit statistics from one of these blogs showed that readers outside of China come primarily from [[Hong Kong]], [[Taiwan]],  [[Singapore]], [[the United States of America]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Malaysia]], and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="World SanGuoSha Audience"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sanguoshaenglish.blogspot.sg/2012/08/who-in-world-plays-sanguosha.html|title=Who in the world plays SanGuoSha?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relevance to history==
The cards and characters of LTK are all related to the ancient history of China, the most telling of which are the characters and their abilities. Each character is given an ability in the game which usually mirrors the historical character's personality, actions, strength/weakness, cause of death, and historical events in which the character was involved, etc. For example, [[Liu Bei]]'s ability '''Kindness'''(仁德) allows him to give away his cards to other players, mirroring the benevolent and kind nature of Liu Bei in ROTK. [[Cao Cao]], on the other hand, is given the ability '''Treachery'''(奸雄), which allows him to keep any card which causes him damage. This mirrors Cao Cao's style of coaxing able advisers of his enemies to defect and join him, then utilizing them for his cause.

The relevance of these abilities to ROTK and the Three Kingdoms history is interesting enough to inspire players to discover more about ROTK and Three Kingdoms history for themselves. One blog author describes his knowledge of Three Kingdoms evolving from uninterested to semi-expert after immersing in the study of LTK abilities. In August 2012, UC Berkeley offered a course in LTK.&lt;ref name="UC Berkeley" /&gt; The faculty sponsor of the course, Professor Robert Berring, wants to get undergrads "acquainted with essential philosophy dating back to China's ancient dynasties".

The standard mode of LTK can be played by 2 to 10 people. Each player plays one of these four roles: Monarch (主公), Minister (忠臣), Rebel (反贼) and Traitors(内奸). There can be only one monarch in the game at all times, but the number of ministers, rebels and traitors are determined by the total number of players, as shown in the table on the right. Each player may have 3 or 4 Health points (see below), depending on their character.

*If there are 5 or more players playing, the player playing as the Monarch may increase his/her total Health points by 1.
*At the beginning of the game, each player must draw one "Role Card" to determine his or her role.
**The player who draws the card "Monarch" must immediately show his or her role card. Others must keep their role card hidden until they are killed in the game.
*When the role card has been distributed and all players know their role, each player draws 4 cards.
*The Monarch begins the first round. He will draw 2 cards from the deck and use the cards on hand appropriately.
*When a rebel is killed, the killer draws three cards.
*If the Monarch kills a Minister, the Monarch has to discard all of his cards including equipment cards.

===Objectives===
Different roles have different victory conditions:
* '''Monarch''': Death of all the rebels and traitors.
* '''Minister''': Protect the monarch no matter the cost (victory conditions are the same as the monarch).
* '''Rebel''': Death of the Monarch (without leaving one Traitor as the sole survivor).
* '''Traitor (Turn-coat)''': Death of every other player (including the other traitors), with the last death of the Monarch.

The game ends immediately if:
* The Monarch is killed, or
* All the rebels and traitors are killed.

As long as one of the scenarios listed above occur at the endgame, the associated roles can claim victory even if the character has already been killed. In general, the Monarch and his ministers must work together to kill the rebels and traitors, while the rebels can cooperate to kill off the ministers before attacking the Monarch. Meanwhile, the traitor(s) can guise as a minister and help to kill the rebels, before revolting against the ministers and finally confronting the Monarch.

===Types of cards===
LTK consists of a few types of cards, which serve different purposes in the game.

*'''ROLE card  角色牌''' - These cards determine the individual player's role (Monarch/Ruler, Minister/Loyalist, Rebel or Defector/Turncoat) and his objectives. Aside from the Monarch, other players must keep their role cards secret throughout the game and reveal it when their character is killed in the game.
*'''LIFE card  体力牌''' - These cards serve as an indication of units of health of a player. Players typically use their character cards to cover the health cards such that the remaining points of health are revealed.
*'''HERO card 将牌''' - These cards determine the character that a player shall be using. The player assumes the allegiance and gender of the character selected, and also acquires the special abilities of that player. All characters in LTK are characters which appear in ROTK.
*'''BASIC cards 基本牌''' - These are playable action cards which can be used on other players or themselves. Basic cards include '''Strike''' (杀), '''Dodge''' (闪), '''Peach''' (桃) and their variations, and can affect the health of a player. ''Strike'' is used to cause damage to other players, ''Dodge'' is used to deflect a ''Strike'' attack (or the player loses 1 point of Health), while ''Peach'' is used to recover 1 point of Health or save a dying character. Basic cards can be identified by a diamond logo behind Chinese characters in the twelve o'clock position of the card.
*'''SCROLL cards 锦囊牌''' - These cards are cards which perform strategic actions or can affect multiple players, and they can be neutralized by a '''Ward''' (无懈可击) strategy card. There are also Time-delayed scroll cards that only take effect during the target player's turn.
*'''Equipment cards 装备牌''' - These cards are placed in front of the player and serve to modify distance and range calculations, as well as contribute to attack or defense attributes.

===Play===
[[File:Card Placement in LTK Game.png|thumb|right|250px|Placement of Personal Cards in a LTK Game]]
There are six main phases to playing when it comes to any player's turn.

#Initial phase (beginning of the turn)
#*Before the judgement phase, certain characters (such as [[Zhuge Liang]] or [[Zhen Ji]]) may use their special abilities to manipulate their own statuses or the cards in the deck.
#Judgement phase
#*Players with time-delayed status cards directed at them must draw and reveal cards on the deck to judge if they pass or fail certain tests, starting from the last status card played. Failure will result in penalties such as unable to draw cards, unable to play cards, or lose 3 health points from a Lightning attack card. Before the judgement, however, players may reveal a '''Ward''' (无懈可击) strategy card to cancel the status cards played on them, and skip the judgement phase.
#Drawing phase
#*The player draws two cards from the deck. Characters with special abilities (such as [[Zhou Yu]] or [[Zhang Liao]]) may use them to take more cards or draw cards from other players.
#Action phase
#*Any number of cards may be played, but generally, each player may only use the '''Strike''' card once, unless otherwise determined by their character or equipment.
#Discard phase
#*After playing, the player will have to discard cards in his hand such that the remaining number of cards is equal to his current Health points.
#End phase (end of the turn)
#*At the end of every turn, certain characters (such as [[Diao Chan]] or [[Cao Ren]]) may use their special abilities.

===Death===
When a player's Health points is reduced to 0, he faces imminent death and must instantly take action: he may request to be saved by a ''Peach'' card (thus letting other players play the card), or may use one immediately if he has it. If he is successful, his health will be recovered to 1 point. Otherwise, he dies (except some special character like Zhou Tai), and must reveal his role card and discard all other cards. If he is a Rebel and killed by a card from another player, that player may draw 3 cards.

It is possible for a player's health to have a negative value (such as suffering from a Lightning attack). In this case, the player will need as many ''Peach'' cards as he requires to raise his health back to 1 point in order to continue the game (for example, a Health point of -1 requires 2 ''Peach'' cards). The abilities of certain cards or characters may involve healing more than 1 points of health, or even prolonged living below 1 Health point.

===Point duels===
Certain special characters (such as [[Xun Yu]]) may initiate point duels with another player to unleash their special abilities. This is done when the initiator plays a card, and the other player does the same, and both players compare the numerical digit on the upper left corner.
The player with the larger number on the wins, with "Ace" as the smallest value and "King" as the largest value. In the case of ties, the initiator of the duel is considered to have "lost" the duel. Suits such as diamonds, hearts, etc. do not matter. Both cards are discarded into the discard deck; players cannot retrieve back the cards into their hands.

==Character allegiance==
All LTK characters are separated into four historically relevant allegiances. They are Shu Kingdom, Wei Kingdom, Wu Kingdom, and Neutral Heroes. In the original LTK, there are no repeated characters. However, as later character expansions are introduced, some characters are duplicated in different allegiances. This is because of the complex changes of each historical figure. Some characters, such as [[Jia Xu]], were under the allegiance of different kingdoms through the course of their lives.

With the introduction of the first LTK expansion pack, a new fictional allegiance known as the Demi-Gods was introduced. Demi-God characters are typically very significant characters in ROTK and Three Kingdoms history, and these characters are given abilities that are much more powerful than regular characters. The presence of Demi-God characters can severely imbalance a regular game, and thus most players choose not to include Demi-God characters into gameplay. Since Demi-God characters are obtained by chance in expansion packs, Demi-God character cards have become collectible pieces. Prices of single Demi-God cards have been known to equal, or exceed, the price of the whole expansion pack.

In 2011, YOKA released collectible '''SP cards''' that comes with every purchase of Zhuo You Zhi 桌游志 magazine, a monthly magazine discussing board and card-games in China. Many SP cards are remakes of existing LTK characters with different allegiances, representing that character from a different time period in his or her career.

==Expansion packs and collectibles==
As of October 2012, seven different official LTK expansion packs have been released. Two different Collector's Editions have also been released. Beginning January 2011, ultra-collectible SP cards were released monthly with every purchase of Zhuoyouzhi 桌游志 magazine. As of October 2012, the SP Yang Xiu character released with the inaugural issue of Zhuoyouzhi magazine has been seen to sell for 500 yuan, which is over forty times the original price of the magazine.

==Variations==
{{Inappropriate person|date=April 2014}}Variations to the original game are played by people from all over China. The game has since been translated into English. Many people created different ways of playing LTK with no roles.
# For three players. Two things have to be concerned about: you must kill the one that is on your right (that player after your turn) and also try to save to one on your left (the player before your turn). If a player whose position is immediately before you dies, you also lose the game.
# Country kill (with five to 12 players) has the same rules without the roles. Everyone chooses their character (five characters to choose from). A few things are different from the original game. The objective is to find your ally (who has the same country) and team up to kill other ally. There are no king's abilities. First, put your character card face down and don't show it to others. Second, whenever one chooses to use the character's abilities or flip riskily to let others know who you are. You are permanently face up because your character card has been shown to them and everyone knows which country you are except when flip character abilities.
# Advanced Country kill: Same on Country kill. Difference are choose from (6 character cards), from those 6 character cards, you choose two character cards with the same Country. During the game, your first Character that is reviled is permanently your gender for the rest of the game.

==Criticisms==
LTK is considered by some observers as a close replica of [[Bang! (card game)|Bang!]], due to similarities between the basic cards and tool cards. However, LTK has managed to entrench its position through the game's strong relations to ROTK.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The similarity has motivated the creators of Bang! to sue LTK and its Western distributor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.strebecklaw.com/bang-creator-sues/|title = Bang! creator sues Legend of the Three Kingdoms makers|date = September 3, 2014|accessdate = 2015-02-02|website = Zachary C. Strebeck: Attorney at Law|publisher = |last = Strebeck|first = Zachary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poor build quality of the Collector's Editions product is also a regular criticism, where the plastic trays holding the cards are easily crushed and the matte finish of the box is prone to scratches. One online shop selling LTK has discouraged customers from purchasing the Collector's Edition altogether to avoid product exchanges and refunds.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

==Differences between versions==

The ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' DVD sets were released in at least three encoding formats:

* [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]] (United States and Canada), in [[NTSC]] format
* [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 2]] (Europe), in [[PAL]] format
* [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 4]] (Australia and New Zealand), in PAL format

Aside from the region encoding (and the packaging), the Region 2 and Region 4 DVDs are identical.  However, there are several content differences between the Region 1 DVDs and the Region 2 and 4 DVDs.

=== Scenes from previous episodes ===
The Region 2 and 4 DVDs include the scenes from previous episodes ("Previously on ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''") at the beginning of each episode (except season 2); the Region 1 DVDs do not.

This even applies to the final episode of season five, ''[[The Gift (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Gift]]'', in which the "previously" scenes are a montage leading into the episode itself.  This montage was deleted from ''The Gift'' on the Region 1 DVDs.  This montage was later included as an [[Easter egg (media)|easter egg]] on the Season 7 DVD set, even in Region 2 and 4.

=== Widescreen ===
Beginning in season four, the Region 2 and 4 DVDs include the [[Aspect ratio (image)#16:9 standard|widescreen (16:9)]] version of the television show.  The Region 1 DVDs include the [[Aspect ratio (image)#4:3 standard|standard format (4:3)]] version, which is identical to the broadcast version.

The reason for this difference is that the Region 2 and 4 DVDs were released before the Region 1 DVDs, with less involvement from [[Mutant Enemy Productions]].  When the Region 1 DVDs were released, [[Joss Whedon]] decided that they should not have the widescreen version, because the show was directed and filmed for a 4:3 ratio.  The extra material in the widescreen versions is never important for the plot, although it gives additional views of the sets and backgrounds.

In 2011 Netflix began streaming Seasons 4-7 in the 16:9 ratio, but would ultimately revert to the 4:3 ratio. In Nordic Region 2 countries Netflix streams those seasons in 4:3 ratio, despite the local DVDs being in widescreen.

As of August 4, 2016 Netflix (and later Hulu) began streaming all 7 seasons in an updated HD version, replacing the original broadcast version. This version of the series is a remaster of the series in HD produced by the studio 20th Century Fox against the wishes of original production team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reactions: The Original Team|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-hd-blu-ray/reactions-the-original-team/671021773000114|website=www.facebook.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the original production team, including Whedon himself, and fans{{who?|date=July 2018}} have criticized the HD remaster for poor transferring of standard definition to high definition, the poor transition from 4:3 aspect ratio to 16:9 aspect ratio, improper lighting, lack of lens filtering and poorly redone special effects that were either upscaled or redone in HD not true to the original.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} For all of season 1 each episode had to be cropped, leaving everything in frame looking zoomed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=SunnydaleArchives|title=What's Wrong with Buffy's HD?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F28XcxHxH6k|accessdate=5 August 2016|date=4 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances the 16:9 aspect ratio shows goofs in frame like crew members or filming equipment on screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whitbrook|first1=James|title=Oh Dear, Buffy's HD Makeover Is A Total Mess|url=https://gizmodo.com/oh-dear-buffys-hd-makeover-is-a-total-mess-1671812347|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=5 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 20th Century Fox originally released the HD remaster as a syndicated broadcast on the network Pivot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Selcke|first1=Dan|title=Buffy The Vampire Slayer marathon heading to Pivot for Halloween|url=http://www.avclub.com/article/buffy-vampire-slayer-marathon-heading-pivot-hallow-210909|website=A.V. Club|accessdate=5 August 2016|date=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the HD remaster is not available for purchase on home media.

=== 4% speed difference ===
The Region 2 and 4 DVDs play the episodes at 4% faster than the Region 1 DVDs.  This reduces the running time of each episode by about two minutes (not counting the "scenes from previous episodes").  It also causes the sound to be raised by two-thirds of a [[semitone]].  For example, a C note is raised to a note two-thirds of the way from C to C♯.

The speeds of the different region DVDs match the speeds used during the original television broadcasts in the respective countries.  Thus the Region 1 DVD plays the video at the same speed as the American broadcasts (which is the speed at which the show was taped), while the Region 2 and 4 DVDs plays the video at the slightly faster speed that was used during the original British broadcasts.  This effect is not particular to the ''Buffy'' DVDs but affects all television shows, because film that uses 23.976 frames per second is sped up for PAL that uses 25 (in the NTSC standard it is [[telecine]]d and there is no speed variation).  But since the signal from a DVD player is ultimately analog, the Region 2 and 4 DVDs will still play at the faster speed when played on an American television with a multi-region DVD.

In Brazil the standard color system is not PAL, but PAL-M which is also 24 frames per second. In addition to that, all DVD releases, despite being Region 4 are in NTSC, so the frame rate is also 24 frames per second.

=== Subtitles ===
In the Region 2 and 4 releases, episodes with commentaries include two English subtitles:  the show itself, and the commentary.  The Region 1 releases do not offer subtitles for the commentaries.

The Region 1 DVDs also offer a smaller choice of non-English languages subtitles than the Region 2 and 4 DVDs.

The Region 1 ''Buffy'' 40-disc boxed set includes an extra disc (the 40th) with all-new special features:

* Introduction by [[Joss Whedon]]
* Back to the Hellmouth: A Conversation with Creators and Cast – with Joss Whedon, [[Marti Noxon]], [[David Fury]], [[Drew Goddard]], [[Jane Espenson]], [[Nicholas Brendon]], [[Charisma Carpenter]], [[Emma Caulfield]], and [[Danny Strong]]
* Breaking Barriers: It's Not a Chick Fight Thing
* Love Bites: Relationships in the Buffyverse
* Evil Fiends
* Buffy: An Unlikely Role Model
* ''Buffy'' Cast and Crew: Favorite Episodes

A repackaged 39-disc version was released on October 12, 2010, excluding the extra disc of bonus features.

===Slimmer versions===
The entire series was re-released on DVD in 2006, in a "slimmer" package with the same bonus materials that were featured in the original fold out versions.  Even "slimmer" versions were issued in 2008.

===Thematic releases===
Two special Region 1 DVD releases contain assorted episodes from various seasons:

* Spike: Love is Hell (October 2005)
:This single-disc release includes four [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]-related episodes: "School Hard", "Lie to Me", "Lovers Walk" and "Fool for Love", as well as a special feature on the character.
* The Curse of the Hellmouth (September 2006)
:A two-disc set that contains eight [[Sunnydale]]-related episodes: "The Pack", "Halloween", "Passion", "The Wish", "Helpless", "Fear, Itself", "Hush" and "Same Time, Same Place", as well as a short supplemental featurette.

In Region 2, there have been several single-disc releases named after individual characters from the show, under the overarching title of "The Slayer Collection". Each contains four episodes and a character profile. The Spike-centric DVD contains the same episodes as the Region 1 "Love is Hell" collection. Other discs focus on Willow, Xander, Giles, Cordelia, Dawn, Angel, and Faith.

Two other single-disc Region 2 DVDs have been released. The first is titled "The Very Best of...". It contains these four episodes: "Becoming, Part One", "Graduation Day, Part Two", "Hush", and "The Gift". The second contains the episode "[[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Once More, with Feeling]]" and a number of special features including a featurette on season 1 of ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' and a featurette titled "''Buffy'', Inside the Music".

In October 2008, a limited edition bonus DVD was made available exclusively to the retail chain Best Buy. The Region 1 85-minute DVD documents the 2008 ''Buffy'' Reunion at the Paley Festival, filmed on March 20, 2008. The DVD features interviews with Amber Benson, Nicholas Brendon, Charisma Carpenter, Emma Caulfield, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Seth Green, David Greenwalt, James Marsters, Michelle Trachtenberg &amp; Joss Whedon.  The DVD is available on Amazon and manufactured on-demand using DVD-R media.

"[[Best Friends Forever (South Park)|Best Friends Forever]]" and "[[Trapped in the Closet]]" were released for the first time on DVD. The Region 1 version has "Volume 1" in the title, as it was originally the intention to release Volume 2 at a later point in time. However, these plans were never executed. This has been fixed in the Region 2 and 4 release of the DVD, as Disc 1 was released separately as "Volume 1", and disc 2 was released separately as "Volume 2".

'''''Tomb Raider''''' is a [[media franchise]] consisting of [[action-adventure game]]s, comic books, novels, theme park rides, and [[film]]s, centring on the adventures of the female [[fictional character|fictional]] British archaeologist [[Lara Croft]]. Since the release of the original ''[[Tomb Raider (1996 video game)|Tomb Raider]]'' in 1996, the series developed into a [[Media franchise|franchise]] of the [[Tomb Raider|same name]], and Lara went on to become a major icon of the video game industry. The ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' has recognised Lara Croft as the "Most Successful Human Videogame Heroine" in 2006. Six games in the series were [[video game developer|developed]] by [[Core Design]], and the latest four by [[Crystal Dynamics]]. The games were first published by [[Eidos Interactive]]; Eidos became part of [[Square Enix]] on 22 April 2009. Square Enix owns the rights to the ''Tomb Raider'' trademark and characters of the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neoseeker.com/news/10546-square-enix-reviews-franchise-sales-data-after-eidos-acquisition/ |title=Square Enix reviews franchise sales data after Eidos acquisition |accessdate=2009-04-28 |work=neoseeker.com |date=23 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three films, ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'', ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider – The Cradle of Life]]'' and ''[[Tomb Raider (film)|Tomb Raider]]'', have been produced.

It was released on 22 March 2011 in North America and 25 March 2011 in Europe exclusively on [[PlayStation 3]] as part of the [[Classics HD]] line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/114/1140977p1.html | title = Tomb Raider Trilogy Confirmed | first = Jim | last = Reilly | date = 19 December 2010 | accessdate = 21 December 2010 | publisher = IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The games were originally developed by [[Crystal Dynamics]], in association with [[Buzz Monkey Software]] and [[Nixxes Software BV]], and were [[Porting|ported]] to the PS3 by Buzz Monkey Software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/291641/features/what-does-it-take-to-remake-a-ps2-game-in-hd-for-ps3/ | title = What does it take to remake a PS2 game in HD for PS3? | date = 5 March 2011 | accessdate = 5 March 2011 | publisher = [[Computer and Video Games]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection includes the [[PlayStation 2]] versions of ''Legend'' and ''Anniversary'' remastered in high definition plus ''Underworld'', which was previously released on the PS3 in 2008, all on one [[Blu-ray Disc]]. Also included is [[PlayStation Network#Trophies|PlayStation Network Trophy]] support, bonus Lara Croft and Viking Thrall avatars for use in [[PlayStation Home]], a theme pack for the [[XrossMediaBar]] and making-of videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=280965 | title = Tomb Raider Trilogy PS3 Revealed | first = Mike | last = Jackson | date = 19 December 2010 | accessdate = 21 December 2010 | publisher = [[Computer and Video Games]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/114/1142819p1.html | title = Tomb Raider Trilogy Dated for PS3 | first = Matt | last = Wales | date = 6 January 2011 | accessdate = 6 January 2011 | publisher = IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two downloadable episodes available for the Xbox 360 version of ''Underworld'' are not included, and Crystal Dynamics has no current plans to make them available on PS3. ''The Angel of Darkness'', the first ''Tomb Raider'' game to be released on the PS2, is also not included in the collection as it was developed by [[Core Design]] rather than Crystal Dynamics and has no relation to the story told in ''Legend'', ''Anniversary'' and ''Underworld''.

===''Level Editor''===
The ''[[Tomb Raider Chronicles#Tomb Raider Level Editor|Tomb Raider Level Editor]]'', Room Editor, is a tool released by Eidos Interactive with the video game ''Tomb Raider Chronicles'' in late 2000. Later, it was made available free to download from the Internet. Since then it has enabled players to design new levels of their own, set in locations from the original games or in new locations.

===''The Action Adventure''===
An interactive DVD was released by Bright Entertainment under license from Eidos in 2006, called ''Tomb Raider: The Action Adventure''. The game takes advantage of standard DVD player audiovisual capabilities, and the remote control. It has puzzles and action elements, while the story is based on ''The Angel of Darkness''.

==Films==
There were initially two film adaptations made in the early 2000s that starred [[Angelina Jolie]] as Lara Croft: ''[[Lara Croft: Tomb Raider]]'' in 2001 and its sequel, ''[[Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life|The Cradle of Life]]'', in 2003. While both films were financially successful, neither of them were well-received by critics. A reboot starring [[Alicia Vikander]] as Lara Croft was released on 16 March 2018, which in turn was better received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=IMAX and Warner Bros.

In 2007, an animated series based on the character was produced and broadcast by [[GameTap]] as part of a series of re-imaginings of popular video game series. Titled ''[[Revisioned: Tomb Raider Animated Series|Revisioned: Tomb Raider]]'', the series ran between May and June 2007. Multiple noted animators and writers were involved with the series, including [[Peter Chung]], [[Warren Ellis]], [[Gail Simone]] and [[Jim Lee]].&lt;ref name="1UPanimation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/news/gametap-announces-tomb-raider-retrospective|title=GameTap Announces Tomb Raider Retrospective|author=Kollar, Philip|website=[[1UP.com]]|date=17 May 2007|accessdate=18 November 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6d8jEHUab?url=http://www.1up.com/news/gametap-announces-tomb-raider-retrospective|archivedate=18 November 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the production team had great creative freedom, they were given a basic guideline for the character by the developers so that Lara would not do anything out of character.&lt;ref name="IGNgametap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2007/07/30/sdcc-07-revisioned-tomb-raider-panel|title=SDCC 07: Revisioned: Tomb Raider Panel|author=Canning, Robert|website=IGN|date=30 July 2007|accessdate=5 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205112218/http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/07/30/sdcc-07-revisioned-tomb-raider-panel|archivedate=5 December 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comics==
{{Main|Tomb Raider (comics)}}

Beginning in 1997, Lara Croft was featured in multiple comics produced by [[Top Cow Productions]]. Her first appearance is a cameo in ''[[Witchblade]]''. She later appeared in a [[Tomb Raider (comics)|titular comic book series]] which ran for fifty issues from 1999 to 2005. An attempt by Top Cow to restart the comic in 2007 stalled due to licensing issues.&lt;ref name="OPM-71"&gt;{{Cite journal| journal = [[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]| publisher = [[Ziff Davis]]| title = Spin: Toon Raider| page = 50| issue = 71|date=August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TRcowIssues"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.topcow.com/comics/25/all| title = All Tomb Raider Issues |website=topcow.com | publisher = [[Top Cow Productions]]| accessdate = 12 February 2010| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080617102124/http://www.topcow.com/comics/25/all| archivedate = 17 June 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MTVcomics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2457165/video-game-comics/|title=Our Giant Guide to Video Game Comics|author=John, Tracey |website=mtv.com |publisher=MTV|date=26 June 2008|accessdate=5 December 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204213218/http://www.mtv.com/news/2457165/video-game-comics/|archivedate=4 December 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new comic book series began in 2014, set within the 2013 reboot's continuity and bridging the narrative gap between the reboot and its sequel.&lt;ref name="TRrebootComic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/a-new-tomb-raider-comic-shows-whats-next-for-lara-crof-838044972|title=A New Tomb Raider Comic Shows What's Next for Lara Croft After Hit Game|author=Narcisse, Evan|website=Kotaku|date=19 July 2013|accessdate=20 July 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616192025/http://kotaku.com/a-new-tomb-raider-comic-shows-whats-next-for-lara-crof-838044972|archivedate=16 June 2015|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''moonwalk''' is a dance move in which the dancer moves backwards while seemingly walking forwards.&lt;ref&gt;Banes, Sally. ''Writing Dancing in the Age of Postmodernism'', Wesleyan University Press, 1994, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[popping]] move, the moonwalk became popular around the world after [[Michael Jackson]] performed it during a performance of "[[Billie Jean]]" on ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]],'' broadcast May 16, 1983.&lt;ref name="Time

==Technique==
An [[illusion]] is involved in creating the appearance of the dancer gliding backwards. Initially, the front foot is held flat on the ground, while the back foot is in a [[tiptoe]] position. The flat front foot remains on the ground but is slid lightly and smoothly backward past the tip-toe back foot. What is now the front foot is lowered flat, while the back foot is raised into the tiptoe position. These steps are repeated over and over creating the illusion that the dancer is being pulled backwards by an unseen force while trying to walk forward. Variations of this move allow moonwalking to appear to glide forward, sideways, or even in a circle.

==History==
[[File:Minnie the Moocher (1932).webm|thumb|thumbtime=26|start=26|end=67|[[Cab Calloway]] executed steps similar to the moonwalk (sidewalk or toe stand) as early as 1932.]]
[[File:Michael Jackson ao vivo 1993.jpg|thumb|[[Michael Jackson]] popularized and named the moonwalk in 1983.]]

There are many recorded instances of the moonwalk; similar steps are reported as far back as 1932, used by [[Cab Calloway]].&lt;ref&gt;Pagett, Matt. ''The Best Dance Moves in the World - Ever!'' Chronicle Books, 2008, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Calloway said that the move was called "The Buzz" when he and others performed it in the 1930s.&lt;ref name=DiLorenzo1985&gt;{{cite journal|last=DiLorenzo |first=Kris |date=April 1985 |title=The Arts. Dance: Michael Jackson did not invent the Moonwalk |journal=The Crisis |volume=92 |number=4 |issn=0011-1422 |page=143|quote=Shoot ... We did that back in the '30s!

In 1944, [[Judy Garland]] and [[Margaret O'Brien]] featured something like the move in their performance of "Under the Bamboo Tree" in ''[[Meet Me in St. Louis]],'' though their performance lacks the illusion created by the genuine moonwalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s8qpMcrEtTg |title=Under The Bamboo Tree - Judy Garland (Meet Me In St. Louis) |publisher=YouTube |date=2010-07-06 |accessdate=2014-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, [[Dick Van Dyke]] performed a similar variation of the moonwalk and [[Camel Walk#1950s/1960s Variant|camel walk]] in his [[sketch comedy|comedy routine]] called "Mailing A Letter On A Windy Corner".

In 1955, it was recorded in a performance by tap dancer [[Bill Bailey (dancer)|Bill Bailey]]. He performs a tap routine, and at the end, backslides into the wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |url=https://archive.org/details/BillBailey |title=Bill Bailey in 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French [[mime]] artist [[Marcel Marceau]] used it throughout his career (from the 1940s through the 1980s), as part of the drama of his mime routines. In Marceau's "Walking Against the Wind" routine, he pretends to be pushed backwards by a gust of wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/grand-master-of-mime-marcel-marceau-dies-1.644639| accessdate=2007-09-23 | title=Grand master of mime, Marcel Marceau, dies | agency=Associated Press | date=23 September 2007 | work=CBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, Mexican dancer-comedian [[Adalberto Martinez]] "Resortes" also performed the moonwalk in the film ''Colegio de Verano'' (Summer School).

In a November 1969 episode of ''[[H.R. Pufnstuf]]'', Judy the Frog teaches everyone a new dance called "The Moonwalk", which includes two instances of a stationary moonwalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tressugar.com/Moonwalk-HR-Pufnstuf-1093896|title=Did Jacko Jack the Moonwalk?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Choreographer [[Bob Fosse]] moonwalks in his role as the Snake in the 1974 film "[[The Little Prince (1974 film)|The Little Prince]]". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUTEhEPONgc | title=sssssSnake in the Grasssss | work=YouTube.com | accessdate=September 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also a been acknowledged that the professional wrestlers [[Michael Hayes (wrestler)|Michael "Pure Sexy" Hayes]], [[Terry Gordy]], and [[Buddy Roberts]] started doing the moonwalk as their trademark ring entrance by 1979 when they formed a wrestling stable known as [[The Fabulous Freebirds]].&lt;ref name="Birds"&gt;{{cite book | author=Greg Oliver and Steve Johnson | title= The Pro Wrestling Hall of Fame: The Tag Teams | publisher=ECW Press | chapter= Top 20: 7 The Fabulous Freebirds | pages= 46–51 | year=2005| isbn=978-1-55022-683-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James Brown]] used the move&lt;ref name="Inglis" /&gt; and can be seen performing it in the 1980 film ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]''. In 1981 in the promotional single and music video ''[[Crosseyed and Painless]]'' by new wave band [[Talking Heads]], authentic street dancers, picked by David Byrne, are featuring, including Stephen "Skeeter Rabbit" Nichols doing the moonwalk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Zrkf65GmwE | title=Talking Heads - Crosseyed and Painless - Official Original Video, 1981 | work=YouTube.com | accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached to 20 on the US dance charts. Another early moonwalker was [[Popping|popper]] and singer [[Jeffrey Daniel]], who moonwalked in a performance of [[Shalamar]]'s "A Night To Remember" on ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in the UK in 1982&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=END_WYdf8pw | title=A Night to Remember, Shalamar, Top of the Pops, 1982 | work=YouTube.com | accessdate=October 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was known to perform backslides in public performances (including weekly ''[[Soul Train]]'' episodes) as far back as 1974. Michael Jackson was a fan of Jeffrey Daniel's dancing and would eventually seek him out.

Also in 1982, [[Debbie Allen]] performs a moonwalk during a scene with [[Gwen Verdon]] in Season 1, Episode 10 ("Come One, Come All") of the TV series ''[[Fame (1982 TV series)|Fame]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFr4tBnXJ38 |title=Fame: Season 1 Episode 10 - "Evolution of Dance" Original Air Date: March 11th 1982 |publisher=YouTube.com |date=2006-09-29 |accessdate=2014-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Flashdance]]'', the move was used in the B-boy scene, where Rock Steady Crew's Mr. Freeze (Marc Lemberger), with an umbrella prop, [[mime]]d the wind blowing him backward as he first walks forward, fighting the wind, then starts moonwalking backwards. Mr. Freeze's version was also shown in the first hip hop movie ''Wild Style'' and [[Malcolm McLaren]] film clip "[[Buffalo Gals (Malcolm McLaren song)|Buffalo Gals]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RME_Qqaju9w ''Buffalo Gals''] (first 12 seconds sample) at [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeffrey Daniel]] taught Michael Jackson the moonwalk. Jackson saw Daniel do the moonwalk dance on ''Soul Train'' and had his manager call ''Soul Train'' to introduce him to the dancer. Daniel was touring with Shalamar at the time so Cooley Jackson and Caszper Candidate went to teach Jackson. However, Jackson was not able to pick up and master the technique until Daniel returned from tour and worked with him.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} The dance was popularized in 1983 when Jackson performed it during a television special, ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'', on March 25 of that year. Dressed in his [[Trademark look|signature]] black trousers, silver socks, silver shirt, black-sequined jacket, sequined glove, and black fedora, Jackson spun around, posed, and began moonwalking. Music critic Ian Inglis later wrote that Jackson encapsulated a long tradition of [[African-American dance]] movements in that one performance.&lt;ref name=Inglis&gt;Inglis, Ian. ''Performance and popular music'', Ashgate Publishing, 2006, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Moonwalking received widespread attention, and from then on, the moonwalk became Jackson's signature move for his song "[[Billie Jean]]". [[Nelson George]] said that Jackson's rendition "combined [[Jackie Wilson]]'s athleticism with James Brown's [[camel walk]]". Michael Jackson's autobiography was titled ''[[Moonwalk (book)|Moonwalk]]'', and he also starred in a 1988 film titled ''[[Moonwalker]]''.

In the 1984 movie ''[[Streets of Fire]]'', actor and performer [[Stoney Jackson]] executed a moonwalk as the leader of a fictional group, The Sorels, who lip-synced to the [[Dan Hartman]] song "[[I Can Dream About You]]".

[[Alexei Kovalev]] has been known for using the moonwalk in his [[National Hockey League]] career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE7yOppnwHQ | title=Youtube "Alex Kovalev Moonwalk on ice" | accessdate=2014-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He performed the move after scoring a goal on February 7, 2001, and on January 3, 2010. Kovalev moonwalked onto the ice after being named one of the stars of the game and again after scoring in a 2008 celebrity charity soccer game.

In 2018, [[Alessia Cara]] briefly used the moonwalk in the music video for her song "Trust My Lonely."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=AlessiaCaraVEVO|title=Alessia Cara - Trust My Lonely|date=2018-10-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=149&amp;v=uF9YayOgjRg|access-date=2018-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Teatro Municipal''', '''National Opera of Chile''' is the most important stage theatre and opera house in [[Santiago]], [[Chile]].

==History and overview==
The Chilean government ceded a significant parcel of land in downtown Santiago to the municipality, in 1848, and an 1853 decree by President [[Manuel Montt Torres]] provided for the construction of a municipal theater in his nation's capital, by then a rapidly growing city. [[French Chilean]] architect [[Claudio Brunet des Baines]] was commissioned for its design, and its construction was entrusted to another French Chilean, [[civil engineer]] Felipe Charme de l´Isle. Brunet des Baines created a [[French Rococo and Neoclassicism|French Neoclassical]] exterior&lt;ref name="BensonGraham2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Andrew Benson|author2=Melissa Graham|title=The Rough Guide to Chile|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XPr4ktEI8JEC|accessdate=10 December 2011|date=3 August 2009|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-4053-8381-3|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the theater, though his 1855 death left the supervision of the design to his countryman, Lucien Henault, and to the latter's assistant, Manuel Aldunate. The new team also benefited from a collaboration with [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]], the architect of the [[Opéra National de Paris]].
[[File:Santiago - Teatro Municipal (1872).jpg|thumb|left|View of the Teatro Municipal in 1872.]]

The Teatro Municipal was inaugurated on September 17, 1857,&lt;ref name="BensonGraham2009"/&gt; with the opera ''[[Ernani]]'' by [[Giuseppe Verdi]], performed by an Italian company brought in specially for the occasion. At the time, the theatre held 1,800 spectators, and included distinctive interior details such as a teardrop crystal chandelier. A December 8, 1870, performance by opera diva [[Carlotta Patti]] was followed by a massive fire, which practically destroyed the building. A quick response by both the local government and Chilean high society resulted in the theatre's prompt reconstruction, designed by Henault and completed on July 16, 1873. Its reinauguration was accompanied by a performance of Verdi's ''[[La forza del destino]]''.

===20th century===
The theatre went through a devastating 1906 earthquake, suffering the loss of most of its interior, and a second, serious fire in 1927, although it recovered quickly on both occasions. Following these reconstructions, the theatre's capacity was reduced to 1,500 in the main hall; however, its interior became more opulent. It was further modernized in 1952 and 1959, and numerous cultural institutions were created for the theatre during that era. The ''Santiago Philharmonic Orchestra'' was established in 1955, the Cultural Corporation of Santiago was formed to administer the center in 1957, the ''Santiago Ballet'' in 1959, and the ''Teatro Municipal Chorus'', in 1962.

The Teatro Municipal was declared a National Monument, in 1974. The theatre hosted the two editions of the [[OTI Festival]] in Chile: in [[OTI Festival 1978|1978]] and in [[OTI Festival 1986|1986]]. Renowned Chilean pianist [[Claudio Arrau]], who had left his homeland in 1941, returned for a visit in 1984, on which occasion the Claudio Arrau Salon, seating 250 spectators, was inaugurated. The stage curtain, installed in 1926, was replaced in 1995 with funds raised by offering donors a piece of the older curtain as a keepsake. 

The institution continues to maintain an active repertoire, and some of its most illustrious recent international guest performers and conductors have included: names in [[ballet]] such as [[Julio Bocca]], [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]], the [[Bolshoi Ballet]] and the [[Mariinsky Ballet]]; pianists [[Claudio Arrau]], [[Valentina Igoshina]] and [[Arthur Rubinstein]], [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]] and [[Daniel Barenboim]]; violinists [[Mischa Elman]], [[Jascha Heifetz]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], [[Gil Shaham]] and [[Isaac Stern]]; conductors [[Zubin Mehta]], [[Charles Dutoit]], [[Kurt Masur]] and [[Pierre Boulez]]; and stage performers such as [[Plácido Domingo]], Dame [[Kiri Te Kanawa]], [[Charles Aznavour]], [[Vivien Leigh]], [[Luciano Pavarotti]], [[Tito Schipa]] and [[Renée Fleming]].

'''The Museum of Particularly Bad Art Exhibition''' (MOPBA) is an annual event held on [[Chapel Street]], [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] celebrating poor [[art]] forms, primarily in the forms of [[painting]]s and [[Sketch (drawing)|sketch]]es. MOPBA relies on a core group of art pieces owned by [[Helen Round]] but the public are invited to enter pieces that are their own or that have been found that are considered poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/eish/kitsch-becomes-an-artform-in-australia-418024|title=Kitsch becomes an artform in Australia - IOL News|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/kultur/er-dette-arets-verste-kunstverk_-1.7300495|title=Er dette årets verste kunstverk?|first=|last=NRK|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event primarily is a charity event that funds three charities within the [[City of Stonnington|Stonnington]] area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/07/16/1089694559243.html|title=Art that's no oil painting - Arts - www.theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
The entries from the public are judged by meeting one point on the selection criteria. Selection points for entry of an art piece into MOPBA are:

* Completely devoid of technical skill ([[Colour]], [[Lightness (color)|tone]], [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] and [[shading]]);
* Unusual, poor or tasteless subject matters;
* Passion of the [[artist]] but is driven by an [[Amateur|uneducated hand]];
* An instinctual feeling that the art piece is poor.

==History==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Gary Glitter.jpg|right|thumbnail|"No one Wants to Touch Him There." ([[Gary Glitter]]). Materials: Crushed velvet, Acrylic and Glitter.]] --&gt;
[[Image:Windsor Junkie.jpg|left|300px|thumbnail|''Windsor Junkie circa 1896'' - Itchiball Prize Winner 2005.]]
The founder of MOPBA is [[Helen Round]]. In the early 1990s, ''[[Foreign Correspondent (TV series)|Foreign Correspondent]]'' reported on the [[Museum of Bad Art]] in [[Dedham, Massachusetts|Dedham]], United States. At this point of her life, Round was in the process of establishing a retail shop named "Fat Helen’s Bric a Brac shop", that was to specialise in the [[kitsch]], inane and tasteless.  It was also a hobby of Round's to peruse [[op shop]]s, [[garage sale]]s and [[Market (place)|market]]s. She was inspired by what she came across in these places and commenced her pursuit of collecting and preserving the mediocre. Round started collecting in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of Particularly Bad Art: About|url=http://www.mopba.org/?page_id=2|accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/reise/aktuell/kunst-in-melbourne-museum-der-haesslichkeiten-a-583180.html|title=Kunst in Melbourne: Museum der Hässlichkeiten|date=9 October 2008|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Round  has collected 200 examples of original art of poor taste. Of notable fame is the original portrait of [[actor]] [[Scott Baio]] that Round located in an op shop in the suburb of [[Windsor, Victoria|Windsor]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/suzanne-carbone/amanda-needs-love/2005/08/02/1122748636560.html|title=Amanda needs to be loved - Carbone &amp; Money - Opinion - theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="spiegel"/&gt;

The Exhibition awards the Itchiball Prize to the submitted art piece that is considered by the public to be the poorest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/deepend/dreadful-art/3339714|title=Dreadful art|date=8 August 2006|website=Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The name is a play on words and parody of the '[[Archibald Prize]]', Australia's most important [[portrait]]ure painting award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Itchyball Prize|url=http://www.mopba.org/?page_id=8|website=Museum of Particularly Bad Art|accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Opposite Day''' (also known as '''Backwards Day''') is a holiday where everything is the opposite of what it's supposed to be.

Opposite Day is sometimes declared retroactively to indicate that something which has just been said now has the opposite of its original meaning (similar to the practice of [[crossed fingers]] to automatically nullify promises).

The game has also been compared to a children's "[[philosophy]] course."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Preschool Confidential |author=Shelton, Sandi Kahn |publisher=Macmillan |year=2001 |isbn=9780312254582 |pages=232–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-referential paradox==
Opposite day causes a [[self-reference|self referential]] [[paradox]]. On opposite day, it could be said that "Today is opposite day." Therefore, it is not opposite day, but if you say it is a normal day it would be considered a normal day, which contradicts the fact that it has previously been stated that it is an opposite day.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10911">The '''Page playoff system''' is a [[playoff format]] used primarily in [[softball]] and [[curling]] at the championship level, the [[Pakistan Super League]], and the [[Indian Premier League]] [[cricket]] tournament.  Teams are [[Single-elimination tournament#Seeding|seed]]ed using a [[round-robin tournament]] and the top four play a mix of a [[single-elimination tournament|single-elimination]] and [[double-elimination tournament]] to determine the winner. It is identical to a four-team [[McIntyre System]] playoff, first used by the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] in Australia in 1931, originally called the '''[[Page–McIntyre system]]''', after the VFL delegate, the [[Richmond Football Club]]'s Secretary, Percy "Pip" Page, who had advocated its use.

==History==
The Page playoff system was used at the Australian Rugby League Championship 1954-1972. In Australia, its most notable use today is in netball, having been adopted by [[Suncorp Super Netball]] when it began play in 2017.

The system has been used since 1990 by the [[International Softball Federation]] and its successor, the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]], for the [[Women's Softball World Championship]] and from 1996 to 2008 at the [[Softball at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].&lt;ref name=ISF&gt;International Softball Federation. [http://www.internationalsoftball.com/english/rules_standards/technical_venue_man.pdf Technical &amp; Venue Manual] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061025144555/http://www.internationalsoftball.com/english/rules_standards/technical_venue_man.pdf |date=2006-10-25 }} ([[PDF]]).  Retrieved March 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first use in curling was by the [[Canadian Curling Association]] in the [[1995 Labatt Brier|1995 Labatt]] [[Tim Hortons Brier|Brier]],&lt;ref name=LFP&gt;Dalla Costa, Morris (March 3, 2006). [http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Curling/TournamentOfHearts/2006/03/03/1471245-sun.html]. ''[[London Free Press via Canoe]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the men's championship, and was adopted the next year at the [[1996 Scott Tournament of Hearts|1996]] [[Scotties Tournament of Hearts|Scott Tournament of Hearts]], the women's championship.&lt;ref name=1996Scott&gt;Soudog's Curling History Site. [http://soudogcurling.tripod.com/STOH/1996.html 1996 Scott Tournament of Hearts].  Retrieved March 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  It gained acceptance and in 2005 the [[World Curling Championships]] started using it, but it has not yet been adopted in curling at the [[Olympic Games]].

The format is used in the [[Indian Premier League]] cricket tournament since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[[Indian Premier League]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The format has also been used in some much lower-key, internet gaming events, such as chess&lt;ref name=Chess&gt;Fischer Random Chess Email Club.  [http://frcec.chess960.info/FischerCup.htm FRCEC's Annual Championship Tournament] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110081449/http://frcec.chess960.info/FischerCup.htm |date=2006-01-10 }}.  Retrieved March 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and backgammon.&lt;ref name=Backg&gt;New Horizons Backgammon.

Retrieved March 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The system requires teams to be [[ranking|ranked]] in some way, as the top two teams have an advantage over the bottom two.  This is usually accomplished through a round-robin tournament, which eliminates all but the top four teams.

===Round-robin===
A standard round-robin tournament is used, in which all teams play each other once.  Because the [[Triangular number|number of total games]] increases [[Quadratic growth|quadratically]] with respect to the number of teams, scheduling too many teams will result in an unwieldy number of games, particularly when there are a limited number of [[playing surface]]s ([[ice rink|curling rink]]s usually only have four [[Curling#Playing surface|sheet]]s).  Therefore, the number of teams is usually capped at around a dozen; if this is not possible or desirable, teams may be separated into groups playing separate round-robins and either having the top teams combining for the Page playoff or playing separate ones in each group and having the winners play each other after.

===Page playoff system===
The system was invented in Australia in the early 1930s and adopted soon after by the Victorian Football League (now known as the Australian Football League).  The top four teams advance to the playoffs, which are played over three rounds with one team being eliminated in each round.  {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

The format progresses as follows:
*In Game 1, the third- and fourth-placed teams play against each other. The loser is eliminated.
*In Game 2, the first- and second-placed teams play against each other. The winner qualifies directly for the final.
*In Game 3, the winner of Game 1 plays against the loser of Game 2. The loser is eliminated.
*Game 4 (the final) is then played between the winners of Games 2 and 3.

This system gives the top two teams a double chance, in that they can lose their first game and still go on to win the title, producing a similar though not identical effect to a [[double-elimination tournament]].  This gives the top two teams a significant advantage over the next two, since winning the title from third or fourth place requires winning one more game than winning from first or second, and also requires defeating every other team in the playoffs. Additionally, the higher ranked team in any pairing (which, in the final, is automatically the team which won Game 2) will play as the [[home team]] to provide an additional advantage; in the case of curling teams, where teams rarely play national or international tournaments at their home rink, the advantage is that the first-placed team is given the [[Curling#Last rock (or Hammer)|hammer]] (last rock) in the first end, which is a reasonable advantage between comparably skilled teams.

In the 2008 World Women's Curling championship, a fifth match was added to the format: a bronze medal playoff match, which was played between the two teams which did not qualify for the final (the losers of Games 1 and 3). This game is normally scheduled between Games 3 and 4. Previously, the bronze would have automatically been awarded to the team which lost Game 3, so this game provides a chance for the loser of Game 1 to still receive a medal. This was also introduced at the national level at the [[2011 Scotties Tournament of Hearts]] and the [[2011 Tim Hortons Brier]]. The bronze medal game was heavily criticized for being "meaningless" in part because simply winning a "medal" does not carry the same sort of prestige it does in the Olympic Games. The bronze medal game was eliminated prior to the 2018 Canadian championship curling season.

====Names of matches====
In Australia, Games 1 and 2 are known as ''Semi-Finals''; Game 3 is called the ''Preliminary Final'', and the final is known as the ''Grand Final''. To distinguish between the two Semi-Finals, which are different in nature, the match between 3rd and 4th is known either as the ''First Semi-Final'' or the ''Minor Semi-Final''; and the match between 1st and 2nd is known either as the ''Second Semi-Final'' or the ''Major Semi-Final''.

In Curling, Games 1 and 2 are usually known as the ''Page Playoffs'' (and Game 2 is usually played first, to give the higher-ranked team more rest before Game 3); Game 3 is called the ''Semi-Final'', and the final is known by that name. However, some sources, in order to distinguish between Games 1 and 2, refer only to Game 2 as a ''Page Playoff'' while referring to Game 1 as the ''Quarter-Final.''

In India, Game 1 is known as the ''Eliminator'', Games 2 and 3 are called ''Qualifiers'', and the final is known by that name.

====Examples====

The first-ever use of the system was in Australia in 1931 after the Victorian Football League adopted it.  The regular season ended with Geelong winning the minor premiership, followed by Richmond, Carlton and Collingwood.  The [[1931 VFL season#Finals|finals]] proceeded as follows:

==Reaction==
Players and fans alike have had a mixed reaction to the system.  Broadcasters enjoy it as it produces one more game than the single elimination format.&lt;ref name=LFP/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5324">'''Primal Scream''' is a tradition at [[Harvard University]] that forms part of the [[streaking at educational institutions]].  At midnight on the last night of reading period and before [[final exams]] begin, students [[Streaking|streak]] through the [[Harvard Yard|Old Yard]].  The streakers begin in the north end of The Yard and generally make one lap around, but the more adventurous sometimes aim for more.  This is done both semesters, even during [[New England]] winters.

Some of the streakers will "dress up" in capes and masks, or [[top hat]] and [[White tie|tails]], or other costumes, but their genitalia are still exposed.&lt;ref name=kester2012/&gt;  The walkways through which students run are lined with spectators and the [[Harvard University Band]] plays beforehand to excite the crowd.&lt;ref name=kester2012/&gt;

Before it became a "night when the whole student body comes together to gawk at just that"&lt;ref name=Thompson/&gt; it was a night with a closer association to its name.  Beginning in the 1960s students would congregate in the Yard or open their windows and just yell for 10 minutes.&lt;ref name=kester2012/&gt;  It was designed as a way to release stress.&lt;ref name=kester2012/&gt;  By the 1990s, the streaking aspect of the evening had become prominent.&lt;ref name=Bronner2012/&gt;  It is still designed to give stressed out students a chance to "step outside the box."&lt;ref name=fox2004/&gt;

The transition from yelling to streaking is unclear. Old administrators that have been at Harvard since the 1970s speak of an earlier day of adventurous streakers. Before there was streaking in the yard began the Quad Howl—streaking in what used to be old [[Radcliffe College|Radcliffe]]. These administrators of the Quad houses speculate that the change from the Quad to the Yard, which happened during their time, was because the narrow pathways of the Quad could not accommodate the increasing multitudes of people with an urge to get naked in public. The natural choice was to go join those in the Yard, giving them something to get excited about.

A small tradition of Quad Howl continues today: after each Primal Scream, a few Quad residents return to the Quad for a naked lap there.  Another related tradition is the Lingere Study Break where undergraduates in Lamont Library strip off their clothes, piece by piece, in front of hundreds of other students studying.&lt;ref name=Bronner2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=fox2004/&gt;

While the records are not entirely clear, it appears that when Charles Adams, son of [[John Adams]] and brother of [[John Quincy Adams]], was a student at Harvard, he and a few friends were disciplined for getting drunk and streaking naked across the Yard.  He was later readmitted.&lt;ref name=kester2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=adams/&gt;

Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 12:00 midnight marked the first time that students ran the naked lap in a clockwise direction.  The tradition of the naked lap has been to start outside of Hollis Hall and then take off initially running west around the Old Yard, counterclockwise.  However, [[Black Lives Matter]] protesters gathered and linked arms just west of Hollis blocking the traditional path.  A bit past midnight students decided to break tradition and run the naked lap clockwise in order to avoid the protesters and complete the lap.{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

"'''Proper Condom Use'''" is the seventh episode of the [[South Park (season 5)|fifth season]] of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]'', and the 72nd episode of the series overall. "Proper Condom Use" originally aired in the [[United States]] on August 1, 2001 on [[Comedy Central]].

In the episode, the teachers at South Park Elementary begin teaching kids sexual education classes. However, the teachers do it in an improper way, leading the boys to wage war against the girls.

==Plot==
[[Eric Cartman|Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]] learn from the 5th graders that "milking" a dog is possible, when it is in fact just stimulating a dog to the point of [[ejaculation]]. They show the act to Stan and Kyle, who are impressed.

Stan performs the technique on his own dog Sparky in front of his parents and their friends during a book club meeting, for which he is grounded for ten months. Stan cannot understand why he is being punished, as his parents are too embarrassed to explain [[sexual stimulation]] to him, and decide that the school should be responsible for teaching [[sex education]].

[[List of staff at South Park Elementary#Mr. Mackey|Mr. Mackey]] tries to teach the fourth grade boys about a male anatomy and female anatomy and the mechanics of [[sexual intercourse]]. Not having had sex since he was 19, Mr. Mackey cannot teach the boys anything of use. [[List of staff at South Park Elementary#Ms. Choksondik|Ms. Choksondik]], intending to scare the girls into safe sex, spends her lesson teaching the girls about all the different types of [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]]s that they might catch if the boys are not wearing condoms, but does not mention that in order to catch these diseases, they would first need to have sex. The boys try talking to [[Chef (South Park)|Chef]], the only person who actually has had much sexual experience, but he (who was opposed to the sex ed class and wanted the children to keep their naivety) doesn't tell them anything. The girls become so terrified of the boys that upon being approached by them at lunch, they back away and scream in fright when they learn the boys aren't wearing [[condom]]s. Afraid they will spread a disease, the boys go to the [[pharmacy]] to purchase condoms.

Hearing from the pharmacist that condoms were purchased, the school believes this is due to the students being sexually active. As a result, Ms. Choksondik says they should start teaching kindergarten students about sex education. 

Ms. Choksondik teaches the girls about pregnancy, which scares them even more than before when she shows them a detailed video of childbirth. The boys then buy the condoms and wear them at all times, not understanding how they work. Mr. Mackey tells them they are only worn during sexual intercourse. Angry that the girls misled them, and thinking that the girls are the ones carrying diseases, they come to believe that they must get rid of the girls. The girls build a massive fort to keep the boys out. The boys tell them to leave town in a siege reminiscent of ''[[Mad Max 2]]'',&lt;ref name="Gournelos2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gournelos|first=Ted|title=Popular Culture and the Future of Politics: Cultural Studies and the Tao of South Park|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MSs2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=2009-09-30|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739137222|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the girls refuse and attack the boys (killing Kenny with a boomerang), which escalates into a battle.

While preparing the lesson plan, Ms. Choksondik and Mr. Mackey become aroused by the sexual nature of their conversation, and admit to having sexual fantasies about each other. The two undress, and engage in unprotected sexual intercourse.

Meanwhile, the battle draws the attention of the adults and the parents, who get angry at the children for the conflict. Ms. Choksondik apologizes to the girls for not telling them that an STD is transmitted through sexual intercourse.

Chef, however, states that the parents are to blame since they were so quick to let the schools handle sex education rather than teach it to their kids themselves. The episode ends with Cartman stimulating another dog as everyone looks on without any objection.

Over the closing credits, Garrison can be heard still teaching [[kindergarten]]ers different sexual positions.

==Ratings and censorship==
In Australia, this episode received an MA rating, due to its strong sexual content throughout, and graphic violence near the end of the episode. Because of its content, this episode also aired at 9:00 at night instead of the programme's usual 8:30 timeslot. The British satellite channel [[Sky One]] refused to air this episode for its strong sexual and violent content, even though it aired a TV trailer with scenes from the episode. The UK terrestrial channel [[Channel 4]] and the UK cable channels Paramount Comedy 1 and MTV UK aired the episode with no edits made. Also, this episode is not aired on [[television syndication]] in the [[United States]] and has only been shown on [[Comedy Central]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/shows/south-park/forums/official-south-park-syndicated-thread-440-845845/]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Audio commentary|DVD commentary]], [[Comedy Central]] asked Parker and Stone to drastically shorten the part where Garrison demonstrates how to put on a condom by using his mouth with a condom around the lips and [[Deep throat (sexual act)|deep-throating]] the [[Human penis|model penis]] used in the lesson. They retained the scene for when the show originally aired, but repeat episodes cut Garrison putting his lips on the [[dildo]] to the children staring in shock at what Garrison is doing off-screen.

==Continuity==
In the episode Mr. Mackey states he has not had sex in "about 21 years" despite the fact that in the episode "[[Ike's Wee Wee]]" Mackey got briefly married and went on a honeymoon in India. Similarly, Mackey tells Choksondik that, while growing up, his head "just sorta seemed to get bigger while the rest of [his] body stayed the same", contradicting the explanation for Mackey's large head provided in "Ike's Wee Wee" in which Mackey's head shrunk back to a regular size when he removed his tie. &lt;ref&gt;http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Proper_Condom_Use/Script&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/Ike's_Wee_Wee/Script&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home release==
"Proper Condom Use", along with the fourteen other episodes from ''South Park: the Complete Fifth Season'', was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on February 22, 2005. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=South Park: The Complete Fifth Season DVD Review |publisher=Bullz-Eye |date=February 26, 2009 |last=Codding |first=Jamey  |url=http://www.bullz-eye.com/television_reviews/2001/south_park_5.htm |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Proper Condom Use" was released on [[DVD]] in June 2002, along with the episodes "[[Cripple Fight]]," "[[Scott Tenorman Must Die]]" and "[[It Hits the Fan]]", on a video titled ''Insults to Injuries''.&lt;ref name="insults_vhs_amazon"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/South-Park-Insults-Injuries-VHS/dp/B000063K6J |title=South Park - Insults to Injuries [VHS] |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="insults_tvshowsondvd"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/South-Park-Volume-Release/1200 |title=South Park - Insults To Injuries DVD Information |publisher=[[TVShowsOnDVD.com]] |accessdate=January 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110915021026/http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releases/South-Park-Volume-Release/1200 |archivedate=September 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex trafficking==
{{see also|Human trafficking in Fiji}}
Fiji is a source, destination, and transit country for women and children subjected to [[sex trafficking]]. Family members, taxi drivers, foreign tourists, businessmen, and crew on foreign fishing vessels have allegedly exploited Fijian children in sex trafficking. Some Fijian children are at risk of trafficking as families follow a traditional practice of sending them to live with relatives or families in larger cities, where they may be subjected to coerced to engage in sexual activity in exchange for food, clothing, shelter, or school fees. Women from China, [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], and other [[East Asia]]n countries are deceptively recruited by the lure of legitimate jobs in their home countries or while visiting Fiji, sometimes by Chinese criminal organisations, and then exploited in illegal brothels (posing as [[massage parlor]]s and spas), local hotels and private homes.&lt;ref name="state17"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fiji 2017 Trafficking in Persons Report|url=https://www.state.gov/j/tip/rls/tiprpt/countries/2017/271187.htm|website=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=4 February 2018}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15287">A '''re-edited film''' is a [[film]] that has been [[film editing|modified]] from its original [[theatrical release]]. These films are typically preceded by the disclaimer, "''This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen and edited for content''." Reasons for this type of editing may range from the distributor's demands to accommodating different audience groups. Fan-made movie edits are often met with controversy, as they bring up issues of copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120601/03533819162/fan-made-movie-edits-another-cultural-loss-hands-copyright.shtml|title=Fan-Made Movie Edits: Another Cultural Loss At The Hands Of Copyright|work=Techdirt.|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of re-editing ==
There are three main types of film editing: format, length, and content.
* '''Format''': Feature films are commonly produced in a [[widescreen]] 1.85:1 aspect ratio or 2.40:1 aspect ratio. which is different from the screen formats television currently has – A standard 1.33:1 (or 4:3) aspect ratio of [[analog television]] and the growing standard of 1.77:1 (or 16:9) aspect ratio for [[digital television]]. Prior to the beginning of a film presented in the 4:3 aspect ratio on [[VHS]] tapes or [[DVD]]s, a disclaimer appears (mainly a black background), reading, ''This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen.'' Since the adoption of [[High-definition television|HD]] television, some theatrical films intended for 2.39 or 2.40 aspect ratios have been reframed for 1.78 (16x9) for television and home video, and also require the modification warning as per [[Directors Guild of America|DGA]] rules.
* '''Length''': Films may be shortened for [[television]] [[broadcasting]] or for use on [[airline]]s.  DVD releases of films may also contain longer cuts.  In a growing trend, more and more films are being released in an ''Unrated'' cut of the film. Prior to when TV airings of the film begins, a format screen appears reading, "''The following film has been modified from its original version.  It has been formatted to fit this screen, to run in the time allotted and edited for content''" (see below).  The end credits on TV airings of films sometimes speed up to make time for the next show or film to start, or to free up more airtime for advertisements, which has become an increasingly-common practice.
* '''Content''': Some films have content deemed "objectionable" to "family audiences": [[sexual content]], [[obscene language]], [[graphic violence]], and perceived racial insensitivity.  To make these films suitable for younger or more typical audiences, or to appeal to [[advertisers]] when a film is shown on [[basic cable]] or [[broadcast]] TV, alternative versions are created with such content removed or replaced. Often, [[profanities]] are replaced with [[minced oath]]s.  The editing of these versions is performed by a censor and not the producer or director of the work. In addition, a film is often times edited if it receives the NC-17 (No one 17 and under admitted) rating from the MPAA, as NC-17 rated films are not screened at mainstream cinemas or advertised on television. Therefore, studios will often re-edit the film to achieve an R rating instead.  

== Re-editing techniques ==
There are two main techniques for re-editing films:

=== Manual re-editing ===
Purchased film content is downloaded onto an editing work station hard drive and third-party editors manually re-edit the video and audio tracks, removing objectionable content.  The re-edited version is then copied onto media (VHS or DVD) and made available for rental or purchase provided an original version has been purchased in correlation with the re-edited copy. Some manual re-edits are done by fans (see ''[[The Phantom Edit]]'') to cut a film to their own – or their peers – specifications.

Although the recent court ruling prohibits business from manually re-editing commercial films, the law still allows for individuals to self censor and edit their own films for personal use.

=== Programmed re-editing ===
Programmed re-editing occurs when software (such as that employed in a DVD player) is used to skip portions of the video and/or audio content on-the-fly according to pre-programmed instruction sets which are knowingly used by the consumer.

==Opening disclaimers==
In any case, theatrical films that aired on television in the 1970s and most of the 1980s would simply have an "Edited For Television" disclaimer superimposed right after the opening credits, or, in a few cases, superimposed over the movie title card itself, just below the title. However, today, when a theatrical film or television special is aired on network or syndicated television or is re-issued on video in a form different from its original version, variations of the following disclaimers appear:
* ''"This film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen.''"
* ''"The following film has been modified from its original version. It has been formatted to fit this screen."''
* ''"This film has been modified as follows from its original version: It has been formatted to fit your screen."''
* Depending on content and time, the disclaimer will add: ''"...to run in the time allotted and for content."'' or ''"...and to run in the time allotted."'' or ''"...and edited for content."''
* Disney films prepared for television by [[Disney-ABC Domestic Television]] and other select TV stations will have: ''"This film has been edited for television"'', or ''"This film has been modified from its original version. It has been edited for television and formatted to fit this screen."''
* Many DVD releases that contain versions of films different from the theatrical releases, such as [[Universal Pictures Home Entertainment|Universal Studios Home Video]]'s ''[[Legend (1985 film)|Legend]]'' director's cut DVD will have: ''"This film has been modified from its original version to include additional material not in the original release."''
* In the instance of black-and-white films that have been [[film colorization|colorized]], there will often be a disclaimer such as the following: ''"This is a colorized version of a film originally marketed and distributed to the public in black and white. It has been altered without the participation of the principal director, screenwriter, and other creators of the original film."''

== History of manual re-editing ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2017}}
Early cases of this practice go back to the [[Nazism|Nazis]], who regularly stole prints of American movies from European countries during their [[Blitzkrieg]] raids. They would then either cheaply reanimate the movie (see ''[[Hochzeit im Korallenmeer]]''), or they would change the names in the credits (as with [[Max and David Fleischer]]'s cartoons).

As theatrical movies began to air on television, networks successfully sought permission to air shortened versions of movies. These TV version of theatrical films had scenes or sections of movies cut out, in order to provide a length short enough to fit in fixed number normal television half-hour-based time slots (often four half-hour slots). This also allowed scenes unsuitable for television to be cut or trimmed such as those with sex or graphic violence. On the other hand, networks would also often add footage deleted from a film's theatrical release to pad out a certain running time (3 to 4 hours).

In response to consumer demand, families began to re-edit purchased VHS tapes literally by making cuts and splices to the tape. A hotbed for this activity has been Utah with its conservative and entrepreneurial population. When [[Titanic (1997 film)|''Titanic'']] was released on VHS, a video store owner in Utah began offering to re-edit purchased copies of the film for a $5 service fee. The service became very popular. Before long, several video rental businesses purchased VHS tapes and had them re-edited for their rental club/co-op members to watch.

At the end of the 1990s, some small companies began selling copies of movies, without the violent, indecent or foul language parts, to appeal to the family audience. By 2003, [[Hollywood]] reacted against these unauthorized modifications, as it considered them to be a destruction of the filmmakers work, and a violation of the controls an author has over his or her works. Famous directors and producers, such as [[Steven Spielberg]], have publicly criticized this practice in magazines.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

When DVD technology emerged, the re-editing industry began offering for sale or rental a disabled DVD accompanied by a re-edited version of the film on a coupled DVD-R  Several companies attempted this business. First, some tried to do it via physical brick and mortar stores, the most successful being the deal model and proprietary stores owned by [[CleanFlicks]], Inc. of Utah. [[Clean Films]] later became the largest and most successful company in the business by employing an online rental model (similar to [[Netflix]]) and avoiding any physical stores. CleanFlicks and CleanFilms were sued with several others and a federal judge in Colorado ruled that the companies were violating copyright. Those named in the lawsuit ceased renting and selling edited films. The legal argument was that the editing resulted in a derivation on a fixed media. At all times, for instance, CleanFilms sold edited films with a legitimately purchased original copy.  Furthermore, every rented unit in edited format had a corresponding original copy that was purchased at retail.  The judge ruled that the fixed media caused the violation. [[ClearPlay]] was not affected by this ruling, as they did not sell fixed media, and editing took place as the unaltered streamed media was altered by the consumer's control of ClearPlay's software.

The lawsuit started because a CleanFlicks franchisee in Colorado pre-emptively sued major directors. The franchisee feared the directors were going to sue because the DGA's website said as much. The [[Directors Guild of America]] and the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] counter-sued and also included several edited film companies for [[copyright infringement]] and claims regarding derivative works. In 2006, Judge Richard P. Matsch of the [[United States District Court for the District of Colorado]] ruled that it was a copyright violation to distribute re-edited films without the consent from the film studios (key was the fixed media aspect of the businesses).

In an odd twist, despite Judge Matsch's decision and order to the re-editing companies to destroy all their re-edited inventory, shortly after the studios' victory in the Denver court, the lawyers for the studios negotiated with lawyers for the re-editing companies allowing for the sale of existing inventory. One of the companies in the first three days of a "going out of business sale" generated more than a quarter of a million dollars in revenue and eventually sold enough re-edited movies to provide original investors a five times or better return on investment. This is an unexpected investor outcome given the loss of a major infringement case.

Less controversial than external bodies editing movies were the rise of [[director's cut]] editions of movies, which flourished with the advent of [[DVD]]s. These restore (and occasionally also shorten or omit, as in the case of [[Alien (film)|Alien]]) scenes or footage from movies which had been shortened for whatever reason (including studio interference with the directors creative vision, inability to finish what was intended due to technology, or even the reactions of test audiences).

== History of programmed re-editing ==
[[ClearPlay]] was sued by the DGA and MPAA, but the case was rendered moot by [[Family Entertainment and Copyright Act|The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of 2005]], which clarified that ClearPlay's filtering approach was legal and did not violate copyright law. As a result, ClearPlay has been able to offer its products to consumers in the U.S. while others have discontinued for legal reasons.

Another aspect of re-editing comes with consumer made edits, which are called [[fan edit]]s (or fanedits). It is when consumers load the films into their computers and use video editing software to produce mostly a version with changed content for their own entertainment. Fan edits are becoming more popular since they are spread over the internet.

== Future of the industry ==
It is unclear where this industry is headed.  There is demand for the product.{{original research?|date=January 2017}} A 2005 [[ABC News]] poll of 1,002 adults from across the United States found that 39% of those polled were interested in purchasing re-edited films, while 58% of respondents said that would not be interested in such a purchase (with a 3-point error margin).&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=692068 "ABC News Poll"]. (2005, April 22).  Poll: Mixed Reviews for 'Sanitized' Movies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the aforementioned legal rulings, companies continue to sell re-edited movies via the Internet. Some have been shut down as well. Yet, search engine results on the web reveal companies continue to provide fixed media products, such as Clean Play DVDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanplaydvds.com/|title=Edited Movies and Clean Family Edited DVDS for Sale ,|date=9 January 2011|website=archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110109164222/http://www.cleanplaydvds.com/|archivedate=9 January 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes they use "going out of business" tactics to move inventory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleanplaydvds.com/?gclid=CICOp_z1p6cCFQpvbAodLGjD_w|title=Edited Movies and Clean Family Edited DVDS for Sale ,|date=8 July 2011|website=archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708163539/http://www.cleanplaydvds.com/?gclid=CICOp_z1p6cCFQpvbAodLGjD_w|archivedate=8 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, physical "brick and mortar" stores have been shut down, such as Cougar Video in Provo, Utah, which remained open long after the named companies in the aforementioned lawsuit were closed down.

One company, Swank, offers re-edited movies created by the studios themselves, supposedly for showings in correctional facilities and other non-theatrical locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://college.swankmp.com/insti/edited.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510012800/http://college.swankmp.com/insti/edited.asp |archivedate=2011-05-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if these versions are the same re-edited versions that studios create for airlines or television showings.

A '''revolving auditorium''' is a mechanically controlled seating area within a [[theatre]] which can be rotated in order to manipulate the change of scenery and stage sets during the performance. Revolving auditoriums are favoured by open-air theatres in particular, because they are ideally suited for the use of natural scenery as an integral part of the set.

The first revolving auditoriums in Europe were built in 1959 in [[Finland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] (then [[Czechoslovakia]]), respectively. The auditorium in [[Pyynikin Kesäteatteri]], [[Tampere]], was the first of its kind to be powered by electrical machinery, whereas the auditorium in the old Baroque Castle Gardens in [[Český Krumlov]], [[South Bohemia]], required 40 people to power its movements.  At the time of its construction, [[Celtworld]] contained the largest revolving auditorium in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wheresgrandad.wordpress.com/2012/06/02/celtworld-where-mythology-met-lasers/|title=Celtworld: Where mythology met lasers|last=Catastrophe|first=Kitty|date=2 June 2012|website=Where's Grandad?||location=Ireland|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161013173509/https://wheresgrandad.wordpress.com/2012/06/02/celtworld-where-mythology-met-lasers/|archive-date=13 October 2016|dead-url=no|publisher=[[Wordpress]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Royal Union of Belgian Radio Amateurs'''  ('''UBA''') (in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], '''[[Koninklijk]]e Unie van de Belgische Zendamateurs''', in [[French language|French]] '''Union Royale Belge des Amateurs-Emetteurs''', in [[German language|German]] '''Königliche Union der Belgischen Funkamateure''') is a national [[non-profit organization]] for [[amateur radio]] enthusiasts in [[Belgium]].  UBA is the national member society representing Belgium in the [[International Amateur Radio Union]].&lt;ref name="iaru"&gt;International Amateur Radio Union (2008). [http://www.iaru.org/iaru-soc.html "Member Societies"].  Retrieved Aug. 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The UBA was founded on 25 January 1947, when separate amateur radio organizations based in [[Flanders]] and [[Wallonia]] merged.  The '''Réseau Belge''' (literally, "Belgian Network") was founded in September, 1923 in [[Brussels]] and drew its membership primarily from the French-speaking radio amateurs in Brussels and Wallonia.  In February 1926, the Réseau Belge began publishing a membership magazine called ''[[QSO (magazine)|QSO]]''.  Flemish amateur radio operators were eager to see Dutch language articles in ''QSO'', but were unable to persuade the editor of Réseau Belge to publish them.  With the support of the publisher of a small [[Dutch language]] magazine called ''Radio'', the '''Vlaamsche Radio Bond''' ("Flemish Radio Association") was founded in [[Ghent]] on September 22, 1929.  The new organization established its own magazine called ''[[CQ VRB]]''.  After [[World War II]], the two organizations agreed to combine into a unified national radio society for Belgium.&lt;ref name="uba_history"&gt;Royal Union of Belgian Radio Amateurs (2008). [http://www.uba.be/fr/uba/l-histoire-de-l-uba UBA History].&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 2001, the Royal Union of Belgian Radio Amateurs was officially recognised as an amateur association by ministerial decree under legislation dealing with the establishment of amateur radio stations.&lt;ref name="Decision of the Council of BIPT"&gt;[http://bipt.be/GetDocument.aspx?forObjectID=1513&amp;lang=fr ''Decision of the Council of BIPT'' Belgian Institute for Postal Services and Telecommunications, 2 August 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Services ==

UBA supports [[amateur radio operator]]s in Belgium by sponsoring [[amateur radio operating award]]s, radio [[contesting|contests]], and [[Amateur Radio Direction Finding]] competitions.  The UBA also operates a [[QSL card|QSL]] bureau for those members who regularly communicate with amateur radio operators in other countries.  UBA represents the interests of Belgian amateur radio operators and [[shortwave listening|shortwave listeners]] before Belgian and international telecommunications regulatory authorities.  The UBA also publishes a monthly membership magazine called ''[[CQ QSO]]''.

On 10 January 2017, Waszczykowski told reporters that, in a bid for a non-permanent seat for [[Poland]] on the [[UN Security Council]], he had meetings with officials from various countries, including some [[Caribbean]] nations, with some of them "perhaps for the first time in the history of our diplomacy.

As a result, the country gained a significant presence on the Internet, and was spontaneously given a fictitious identity on social media (Twitter, Facebook&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/sanescobarcountry/ San Escobar Facebook page]&lt;/ref&gt;), including a flag (blue, white, and green stripes, with a yellow 5-pointed star in a red triangle), photos and maps.&lt;ref name=gua/&gt; The Facebook page was created by Jarek Kubicki, a member of the [[Razem]] political party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiadomosci.wp.pl/nie-jestem-kijowskim-partii-razem-to-on-stoi-za-profilem-panstwa-san-escobar-6079394101535873a "Nie jestem Kijowskim partii Razem". To on stoi za profilem państwa San Escobar]&lt;/ref&gt; Within a day the hashtag &lt;tt&gt;#SanEscobar&lt;/tt&gt; was tracked by over 2 million people and has become the most popular within the Polish segment of Twitter. San Escobar has also become a subject of numerous joke news, e.g. about an appointment of a military attaché and its nice ecology. A good deal of them play upon drug lord [[Pablo Escobar]], popularized via the TV series ''[[Narcos]]''.&lt;ref name=GW0/&gt;&lt;ref name= GW/&gt;

A Twitter account for 'República Popular Democrática de San Escobar' (&lt;tt&gt;@rpdsanescobar&lt;/tt&gt;) was established, which quickly rose to prominence. It announced full support for Waszczykowski in his endeavor, and proceeded to issuing various news releases in Spanish and English, including a reproach towards Saint Kitts and Nevis: the correction of the Polish spokeswoman was interpreted as an attempt to foil Poland&amp;mdash;San Escobar relations. San Escobar issues a newspaper, ''San Escobar Times'' (also on Twitter). San Escobar has also become a popular travel destination via El Niño Airlines. For a while the phrase "Maybe I better drop it all and fly to San Escobar?" has become very popular (Polish: „A może rzucić to wszystko i polecieć do San Escobar?”, a play with the Polish saying "A może rzucić to wszystko i wyjechać w Bieszczady"). Ticketing service Fru wrote that there are only one-way tickets to San Escobar.&lt;ref name=GW/&gt; [[Netflix]] (the creator of ''Narcos'') also allegedly claimed it already has airline tickets to sell. For a while Wikipedia had a full-blown article about the country, including its population count, capital city ([[Santo Subito]]), and all.&lt;ref name= GW/&gt;&lt;ref name= GW2&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/7,75398,21227041,san-escobar-co-wiemy-o-nowym-sojuszniku-polski-ktorego-pozyskal.html "San Escobar - co wiemy o nowym sojuszniku Polski, którego pozyskał minister Witold Waszczykowski?"]&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts were soon created for political and other entities within San Escobar, like one for 'El Frente Comunista de San Escobar' (The Communist Front of San Escobar), which leads a [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the fictional country's government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/01/11/san-escobar-how-polands-foreign-minister-helped-create-a-fake-country/ San Escobar: How Poland’s foreign minister helped create a fake country] - [[Washington Post]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Quickly Waszczykowski became a target of all kinds of derision.&lt;ref name= GW/&gt; For example, a newspaper published suggestions of other countries for Waszczykowski to consider, such as [[San Serriffe]] or various [[micronation]]s.&lt;ref name=GW3&gt;[http://wyborcza.pl/7,75400,21227996,san-escobar-przetarl-droge-na-spotkanie-z-ministrem-waszczykowskim.html "San Escobar przetarł drogę. Na spotkanie z ministrem Waszczykowskim czekają przedstawiciele innych nieistniejących państw"],''Gazeta Wyborcza'' January 11, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 2017 [[Comedy Central Poland]] recorded an anthem of San Escobar sung by [[Eric Cartman]], an animated ''[[South Park]]'' character.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/ccpl/videos/10158109851845022/ Hymn San Escobar] – [[Comedy Central]] Polska&lt;/ref&gt;

Waszczykowski has won the listener's poll "Silver Lips" for 2017 for the most surprizing or funniest utterance by a Polish politician, carried out by [[Polskie Radio Program III]]. While receiving the award, Waszczykowski commented: "I'd rather expect the note of recognition from the Geographical Society. It did not arrive." &lt;ref name=usta&gt;[https://www.tvn24.pl/wiadomosci-z-kraju,3/srebrne-usta-za-2017-rok-rozdane,827481.html  " Triumf San Escobar.

The phenomenon of San Escobar became a subject of a scholarly paper.&lt;ref&gt;Ewa Badyda, Lucyna Warda-Radys. ''[http://www.ejournals.eu/pliki/art/10217/ Santo Subito, Bimberro Grande i Pico de Waszczykowski (2017 m) – wykreowany w przestrzeni Internetu fikcyjny kraj San Escobar (wpływ kontekstu na strukturę pojęcia)]'' [Santo Subito, Bimberro Grande and Pico de Waszczykowski (2017 m) – a fictional

'''Schlager music''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃlaːɡɐ|lang}}, "[[wikt:Schlager#German|hit(s)]]")&lt;ref name="ASEPMP"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Song for Europe: Popular Music and Politics in the Eurovision Song Contest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq7nilnv93cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|first=Ivan|last=Raykoff|first2=Robert|last2=Deam Tobin|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|location=London England and Burlington, Vt. USA|year=2007|pages=37–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a style of [[popular music]] which is generally a catchy instrumental accompaniment to vocal pieces of pop music with easy to understand, happy-go-lucky and often sentimental lyrics. It is prevalent in Central and Northern Europe, and Southeast Europe (in particular Germany,&lt;ref name="ASEPMP" /&gt; Austria, Albania, Bulgaria, Finland, Slovenia, Serbia, Croatia, Poland, Hungary, Switzerland, Turkey, Scandinavia and the [[Baltic States]]), and also (to a lesser extent) in France, Belgium, Netherlands and the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. In the United States it is also known as 'entertainer music' or 'German hit mix'.

[[File:Michelle in Berlijn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Michelle (German singer)|Michelle]] performing in Berlin, 15 March 2017, where she sang schlagers as well as ballads]]

The style emerged in Europe after the [[Second World War]], partly as a backlash against American [[rock and roll]], and uses simple patterns of music.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2011/mar/15/schlager-germany-biggest-pop-stars  Nico Roicke, "Schlager louts: meet Germany's biggest pop stars", ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 March 2011]. Retrieved 13 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Typical schlager tracks are either sweet, highly sentimental [[ballad]]s with a simple, catchy melody or light [[pop music|pop]] tunes. [[Lyrics]] typically center on love, relationships and feelings. The northern variant of schlager (notably in Finland) has taken elements from Nordic and Slavic [[folk songs]], with lyrics tending towards [[melancholia|melancholic]] and [[elegiac]] themes. Musically, schlager bears similarities to styles such as [[easy listening]] music.

The German word ''Schlager'' (itself a [[calque]] of the English word ''hit'') is also a loanword in some other languages ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], Russian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slovari.yandex.ru/dict/bse/article/00091/23800.htm|title=БСЭ|website=Slovari.yandex.ru|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hebrew]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dexonline.ro/definitie/%C8%99lag%C4%83r|title=Dexonline|website=Dexonline.ro|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example), where it retained its meaning of a "(musical) hit". The style has been frequently represented at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] and has been popular since the contest began in 1956,&lt;ref name="ASEPMP" /&gt; although it is gradually being replaced by other [[pop music]] styles.

Over time, schlager music has gradually shifted on to [[electronic music]] rather than generic pop music, due to its widespread use of [[synthesizer]]s throughout its various implementations in the recent decades.

==Variations by country==
{{anchor|Variations on the genre by country}}

===The Netherlands and Flanders===
[[Dutch language|Dutch]] schlager is called ''[[levenslied]]'' (literally 'life song', ''i.e.'' 'song about real life'). It is a sentimental, Dutch-language subgenre of pop music. Typical ''levenslied'' lyrics treat subjects such as love, misery, and nostalgia, besides longing for  sunny, exotic holiday places. A typical ''levenslied'' has catchy, simple rhythms and melodies (in common with many pop and folk tunes) and is structured in couplets and refrains. Traditional instruments in ''levenslied'' music are the [[accordion]] and the [[barrel organ]]. For example Nicole and Hugo.

===Finland===
The roots of Finnish schlager ({{lang-fi|iskelmä}}) date back to the [[interwar period]], when popular singers included [[Georg Malmstén]] and Matti Jurva. A particularly notable song was opera singer Ture Ara's "Emma" in 1929. Schlager tradition had (and still has) an important place in Finnish popular music, and its melodic language has also influenced [[Finnish rock]]. Schlager music shares its audience with [[Finnish tango]] music, since both are popular among older and even middle-aged Finns. A particular feature of Finnish schlager music were "translation schlagers" ({{lang-fi|käännösiskelmä}}). Noteworthy Finnish schlager composers include [[Juha Vainio]]. According to the polls conducted among Finnish audiences, "''Hopeinen kuu''", (originally "''Guarda che luna''" by  Walter Malgoni and Bruno Pallesi),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italica.rai.it/index.php?categoria=musica&amp;scheda=canzone_buscaglione_guarda_luna]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929063258/http://www.italica.rai.it/index.php?categoria=musica&amp;scheda=canzone_buscaglione_guarda_luna |date=2010-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in Finnish by [[Olavi Virta]] and "''Satulinna''" (composed by [[Jukka Kuoppamäki]] and sung by [[Jari Sillanpää]]) are the most popular Finnish schlagers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028011502/http://194.252.88.3/ijulkaisu.nsf/sivut/kaikkienaikojeniskelma_arkisto?opendocument&amp;pageid=Content1527599F44D|title=Iskelmäradio - Kaikkien aikojen iskelmä YLE Radio Suomi|date=28 October 2007|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iskelma.fi/?area=ajankohtaista&amp;iidee=7000000000034808|title=Eniten kotimaisia hittejä - Iskelmä|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany and Austria===
[[File:Musikantenstadl-Tournee 2010, Wien (18) Francine Jordi und Andy Borg.jpg|right|thumb|Austrian singer and presenter [[Andy Borg]] and Swiss singer [[Francine Jordi]]]]
The roots of German schlager are old: the word refers to songs by [[Heinz Rühmann]] and other movie actors/ singers of the 1930s. The antecessor of the schlager might be the operettas, which were extremely famous in the early twentieth century. In the 1920s and 1930s, the [[Comedian Harmonists]] and [[Rudi Schuricke]] laid the foundations for this new type of music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alsmann|first1=Götz|title='Der Schlager hat sich selbst entmannt'|url=http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/deutsches-liedgut-a-949272.html|accessdate=26 September 2015|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=8 May 2008|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known schlager singers during the 1950s and the early 1960s include [[Lale Andersen]], [[Freddy Quinn]], [[Ivo Robić]], Gerhard Wendland, [[Caterina Valente]], [[Margot Eskens]] and [[Conny Froboess]]. Schlager reached its peak in popularity in Germany and Austria during the 1960s (featuring [[Peter Alexander (Austrian actor and singer)|Peter Alexander]] and [[Roy Black (singer)|Roy Black]]) and the early 1970s.  From the mid-to-late 1990s into the early 2000s, however, German-language ''schlager'' saw an extensive revival in Germany by, for example, [[Guildo Horn]],&lt;ref name="ASEPMP" /&gt; [[:de:Dieter Thomas Kuhn|Dieter Thomas Kuhn]], [[Michelle (German singer)|Michelle]] and [[:de:Petra Perle|Petra Perle]]. Even reputable [[Nightclub|dance club]]s would put in a stretch of schlager titles during the course of an evening, and numerous new bands specialising in 1970s schlager [[cover version]]s and "new" material were formed. In [[Hamburg]], schlager fans still (as of 2013) gather annually by the hundreds of thousands&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atlanticalliance.eu/event/schlagermove?page=15|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120721003943/http://www.atlanticalliance.eu/event/schlagermove?page=15|deadurl=yes|title="Schlagermove" - Atlantic Alliance|date=21 July 2012|archivedate=21 July 2012|website=Archive.today|accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dress in 1970s clothing for a street [[parade]] called "Schlager Move". Due to its popularity, the Schlager Move brand is also used for a number of smaller Schlager music parties in several major German cities throughout the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schlagermove.de/|title=Schlagermove - Home|website=Schlagermove.de|accessdate=8 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revival is associated with [[kitsch]] and [[Camp (style)|camp]].

[[File:Helene-Fischer-Schleyerhalle.jpg|thumb|right|German artist [[Helene Fischer]]]]
Germans view Schlager as their country music and in fact American country and Tex-Mex music are both major elements in the Schlager culture ([[Is This the Way to Amarillo]] is regularly played in Schlager contexts, usually in the English original).

Popular Schlager singers include Michael Wendler, [[Roland Kaiser]], [[Hansi Hinterseer]], [[Jürgen Drews]], [[Andrea Berg]], [[Helene Fischer]], [[Nicole (German singer)|Nicole]], [[Claudia Jung]], [[Andrea Jürgens]], [[Michelle (German singer)|Michelle]], [[Kristina Bach]], [[Marianne Rosenberg]], [[Simone Stelzer]], Christian Lais, [[Semino Rossi]], [[Vicky Leandros]], [[:de:Leonard (Sänger)|Leonard]], [[DJ Ötzi]] and [[Andreas Gabalier]] who was voted best 'Schlager' singer in 2012. Stylistically, schlager continues to influence German "party pop": music most often heard in [[après-ski]] bars and [[Majorca]]n mass [[disco]]s. Contemporary schlager is often mingled with [[Volkstümliche Musik]]. If it is not part of an ironic kitsch revival, a taste for both styles of music is commonly associated with a lower and lower middle class habitus, typically heard in folksy pubs, at fun fairs, and bowling league venues.
Between 1975 and 1981 German-style schlager has become more disco-oriented, in fact in many ways merging with the mainstream disco music of the time. Singers like Marianne Rosenberg were recording both schlager and disco hits which sounded pretty much the same.

The song [[Moskau (song)|"Moskau"]] by [[Dschinghis Khan]] was widely recognized as one of the earliest form of modern, dance-based schlager, and that again proves that schlager of the 70-s and early 80-s basically  evolved into a mainstream disco and Euro-disco. German band Dschinghis Khan was primarily a disco band that performed and recorded both disco and disco-influenced schlager music.

===Sweden===

In Sweden, schlager has waxed and waned in popularity since at least the 1930s. It still enjoys a large place in Swedish culture, although it is considered to be too "popular and commercial" by many people. Although the original schlager was heavily influenced by [[operetta]]s, cabaret- and variety-style music and [[jazz]], this started to change during the 1960s and 1970s when schlager music became more pop-oriented. Since the early 1990s, schlager songs began to include elements of [[Rock music|rock]] and [[techno]]. Therefore, modern schlager music little resembles that of the 1940s. Despite this, many old schlager tunes are still popular; they are performed by many artists and at the [[Allsång på Skansen]].

[[File:Melodifestivalen 2014 bild 9.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Melodifestivalen]], often features modern schlager hits, giving it a second name by some: Schlagerfestivalen]]
The [[Melodifestivalen|Melodifestival]] (which selects the Swedish competitor at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]) is popularly also called ''Schlagerfestivalen'' ("the Schlager Festival") or Schlager-SM (Swedish schlager championship), since it has traditionally been characterised by schlager songs. The Eurovision Song Contest has also been called "Eurovisionsschlagerfestivalen" (Eurovision schlager festival) or schlager-EM ("European schlager championship"). The amount of schlager has decreased drastically in recent years, but schlager songs are the most likely genre to win the competition  ("''Evighet''" ({{lang-en|"[[Invincible (Carola Häggkvist song)|Invincible]]"}} in 2006 by [[Carola]] and "[[Hero (Charlotte Perrelli song)|Hero]]" by [[Charlotte Perrelli]] in 2008, for example). ''Melodifestivalen'' is the most popular TV program in Sweden. It is broadcast annually, and in 2006 an estimated 47 percent of the Swedish population watched the final. In Sweden "schlager" is often used to refer to Eurovision-participating songs.

Two characteristics of Swedish schlager are a pronounced [[key change]] before the final chorus and their three-minute length (the maximum song length permitted at the Eurovision Song Contest). Some Swedes dispute the meaning of "schlager" with respect to Swedish music; it may be used indiscriminately to describe all popular music, "older-sounding" popular music, ''Melodifestivalen'' songs, Eurovision songs, songs with a "catchy" chorus or [[dansband]] music. Both [[Björn Ulvaeus]] and [[Benny Andersson]] of [[ABBA]] were influenced by schlager music early in their careers.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:Tony Christie – Appen musiziert 2015 01.jpg|thumb|right|220px|British schlager singer [[Tony Christie]]]]
In the United Kingdom, schlager is often categorized simply as pop.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; The style has long been popular there, especially between the 1950s and 1980s, with singers such as [[Tony Christie]], who enjoyed success among schlager audiences in both Germany and the UK; [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], most notably with schlager hit "[[Release Me (1946 song)#Engelbert Humperdinck version|Release Me]]"; and [[Petula Clark]], who gained her first number 1 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] with "[[Sailor (song)|Sailor]]", the English schlager version of "[[Sailor (Your Home is the Sea)|Seemann (Deine Heimat ist das Meer)]]", originally performed by Austrian singer [[Lolita (Austrian singer)|Lolita]]. Artists from other countries have also had schlager hits in the UK.  American singers [[Al Martino]] and [[Roy Orbison]] both entered the British charts with schlager hits "[[Moon Over Naples|Blue Spanish Eyes]]" and "[[Only the Lonely]]" respectively. [[Billy Fury]]'s "[[Halfway to Paradise]]" reached  number 3 in the UK Singles Chart. From the Netherlands and the UK, Dutch band [[Pussycat (band)|Pussycat]] reached number 1 with the song "[[Mississippi (song)|Mississippi]]". German and Austrian singers have also had hits in the UK, such as German singer [[Nicole (German singer)|Nicole]] reached the UK chart with "[[Ein bißchen Frieden|A Little Peace]]" peaking at number 1. The song won Germany the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in 1982. The UK has itself entered many schlager artists into the Eurovision Song Contest, for example music group [[Brotherhood of Man]] won for the UK in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]] with "[[Save Your Kisses for Me]]".

German schlager, although mainly sung in German including [[volksmusik]] and its modern version [[volkstümliche Musik]], has attracted a small fan base in the United Kingdom, including [[BBC Radio Manchester]] commentator [[Manchester Sports#Ian Cheeseman|Ian Cheeseman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/manchester/content/articles/2008/10/06/061008_cheeseman_music_feature.shtml |title=Manchester - BBC Radio Manchester - Abba and Austria |publisher=BBC |date=2008-10-24 |accessdate=2012-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's current top selling schlager singer [[Helene Fischer]] released the album ''The English Ones'' in 2010 with several versions of her German language hits in English for her English speaking fans of schlager music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://chicagoschlager.blogspot.co.uk/2011/07/helene-fischer-in-english-does-it-work.html|title=Helene Fischer in English: Does It Work?

==={{anchor|The former Yugoslavia}}Former Yugoslavia===
The first schlager music in the former [[Yugoslavia]] began to appear in the late 1940s and early 1950s. The first (and most influential) festival of schlager music was the Zagreb Festival of Popular Music (later known as Zagrebfest), which began in 1953 and still takes place annually in [[Zagreb]]. Many schlagers ({{lang-hr|šlager, uspješnica}}) performed at Zagrebfest over the past five decades are an integral part of the Croatian and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] pop-music scene. The first schlager singers were [[Ivo Robić]] and [[Rajka Vali]], but over time [[Zagreb]] school of schlagers came to include such singers as [[Vice Vukov]], [[Arsen Dedić]], Hrvoje Hegedušić, Ivica Percl, [[Gabi Novak]], [[Frano Lasić]], [[Jasna Zlokić]], [[Zdravko Čolić]], and many others. Main composers of schlagers included Fedor Kopsa, Krešimir Oblak, Ferdo Pomykalo, [[Miljenko Prohaska]], Nikica Kalogjera, Bojan Hohnjec, Vanja Lisak, Zvonko Špišić, Ivica Stamać and Hrvoje Hegedušić.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/scena/showbizz/clanak/id/38719/hrvatski-evergreen-najbolje-melodije-zabavne-glazbe|title=Hrvatski evergreen: najbolje melodije zabavne glazbe|date=31 January 2009|work=[[Slobodna Dalmacija]]|last=Gall|first=Zlatko|authorlink=Zlatko Gall|language=hr|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Zagrebfest artists (such as [[Ivo Robić]] and [[Tereza Kesovija]]) would later have successful careers in Germany and France. Other pioneers of schlagers include Darko Kraljić (from Zagreb), who worked in [[Belgrade]]. He is best known by his hit "Čamac na Tisi" (sung by [[Lola Novaković]] and popular in revolutionary Hungary) and his music for the film ''Ljubav i moda'' ("[[Devojko mala]]" and "[[Pod sjajem zvezda]]", performed by Vokalni kvartet Predraga Ivanovića).

===Turkey===
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Schlager became popular in the 1950s Turkey. The first, most popular artist to publish schlager in Turkey was [[Ajda Pekkan]]. She published a lot of Schlager music, before shifting her genre to schlager-disco pop. Furthermore her stage name "Diva" is caused by [[Schlager]].{{clarify|date=June 2018}} There are many singers in this genre today, such as [[Tarkan (singer)|Tarkan]], [[Burcu Güneş]], Petek Dinçöz, Aylin Vatankoş, [[Nilüfer Yumlu]], [[Erol Evgin]], [[Funda Arar]] and [[Hülya Avşar]].

'''''Shanghai Knights''''' is a 2003 American-Hong Kong [[martial arts]] [[action film|action]] [[comedy film]]. It is the sequel to ''[[Shanghai Noon]]''.

==Plot==
{{Long plot|section|date=June 2017}}
In 1887, Chon Lin ([[Fann Wong]]) tells her father (Kim Chan), the Keeper of the [[Imperial Seal of China]] in the [[Forbidden City]], that her brother, Chon Wang ([[Jackie Chan]]), is doing well as a [[sheriff]] in [[Carson City]], [[Nevada]], but her father replies that her brother is dead to him. At that moment, Lord Nelson Rathbone ([[Aidan Gillen]]), leads a band of [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxers]] into the city, who attack the Keeper. Despite Lin's efforts, her father is killed and the seal is stolen. With his last breath, he gives Lin a box and tells her to give it to her brother.

Meanwhile, Chon Wang is doing well as sheriff, having captured an impressive array of fugitives. His deputy ([[Matt Hill]]) is relaxing with a book called ''"Roy O'Bannon Vs. The Mummy"'', a highly fictionalized account of the events of the first film that now portrays Wang's "[[Shanghai]] Kid" as a cowardly sidekick, which dismays Wang. Wang receives a parcel containing a [[puzzle box]] and a letter from Lin telling him that their father is dead and that she has tracked the murderer to [[London]].

Chon Wang travels to [[New York City]] to find his old partner Roy O'Bannon ([[Owen Wilson]]). and uses his share of the first film's gold to buy a ticket to London. Chon finds that Roy has left his brief stint in [[Police|law enforcement]], broken off his romance with Falling Leaves, spent most of the gold investing in the [[Zeppelin]], and is now a hotel waiter and part-time gigolo. (Later Roy reveals that he has lost all of the gold on publishing his novels). After they attempt [[prostitution]] to pay for a trip to the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], the [[List of mayors of New York City|Mayor of New York]] arrives in search of his daughters who are Roy's latest clients. The pair escapes and ship themselves to [[London]] in a crate.

In London, Wang and O'Bannon have their duster and watch stolen, respectively, by a number of street thugs including a young boy named Charlie ([[Aaron Taylor-Johnson|Aaron Johnson]]). After an extensive battle to reclaim these items, they are arrested by the police. In [[Scotland Yard]], Inspector Artie Doyle ([[Tom Fisher (actor)|Thomas Fisher]]) thanks the two for defeating the [[Fleet Street]] gang. He tells Wang that Lin is also in Scotland Yard, having attempted to kill Lord Rathbone. Meanwhile, Rathbone finds he is not alone in his carriage as Wu Chow ([[Donnie Yen]]) has sneaked his way on; Rathbone slips him the dagger that killed the Keeper of the Imperial Seal. Sometime later, Roy and Wang wander through London and see [[Buckingham Palace]]. They encounter Charlie, who lets them into the empty house of a [[Nobility|nobleman]] and finds an invitation to a gala at the castle.

Roy and Wang arrive that night at the gala, wearing [[disguise]]s: Roy masquerades as [[Major General]] "[[Sherlock Holmes]]" (a name he derives from the face of a clock), and Wang is the "[[Maharaja]] of [[Nevada]]". Wang and Roy follow Lord Rathbone to a private library, but Rathbone slips quickly through a secret passage before they can reach him. As Roy occupies himself with a copy of the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', Wang looks for the secret passage and discovers it in the fireplace. Wang enters the secret room, which contains treasures from throughout the [[British Empire]] and asks for Roy's help which Roy repeatedly ignores, as he thinks it is something minor, and continues to read his book. Rathbone's guards then attack Roy, but he is rescued by Lin, who has escaped from Scotland Yard. The three see Rathbone hand the Imperial Seal to Wu Chow, the [[Illegitimacy|illegitimate]] brother of the [[Emperor of China]], which is then stolen by Charlie who leaves his hat. Rathbone spots the three, and after a brief battle, he sets the barn on fire and escapes, and then the three also manage to escape.

They find Artie drunk after being sacked at his home. Artie deduces that Charlie is in [[Madame Tussauds]] by inspecting Charlie's hat. They arrive just in time to save Charlie from the Boxers at the expense of losing the seal again and being captured outside by police. Taken away in a police buggy, they are rescued in turn by Charlie, who later reveals his full name to be [[Charlie Chaplin]]. After an interlude in a [[brothel]] where Wang tries to convince Lin that Roy is unsuitable, Roy has overheard this and is upset with Wang, but forgives him when Roy arranges a pillow fight with the ladies of the night. When Lin sees this she runs into the night followed by Roy and Wang. They are all captured by Rathbone, who tells them that he is going to kill the royal family and frame "Loony" Lin. They escape and manage to stop Wu Chow from killing the royal family. Just as Wu Chow is about to kill Wang, Lin blasts and kills him with a rocket. The three then follow Rathbone to the top of [[Big Ben]]. He throws Roy out of the tower, but he survives when he grabs a hand of the clock. Thinking Roy is dead, Wang fights with Rathbone, and the pair is both thrown outside. Roy saves Wang as Rathbone falls to his death.

Roy and Wang are [[British honors system|knighted]], as is Artie, whose full name is now revealed to be [[Arthur Conan Doyle|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]. Artie decides to become a writer of detective stories revolving around his deductive reasoning technique, and asks Roy if he can use the "Sherlock Holmes" name. Roy proposes that he and Wang go to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] to get in on the ground floor with [[Film|motion pictures]]. They roll off in a buggy, with Charlie (wearing [[The Tramp|a fake mustache]]) stowed away. Wang also manages to open the box his father sent him, finding a message inside reminding him of the importance of family.

==Production==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
Director David Dobkin was personally chosen by Jackie Chan. Director David Dobkin had a difficult time choosing a suitable Asian actress who could do movement work, emote well and speak excellent English. He then saw clips of Fann Wong's videos "Wo lai ye" (2001) and "Qing she yu bai she" (2001) and requested to audition her in London, which she did attend. She subsequently got the role and her number of scenes was increased by thirty percent.

Aside from [[establishing shot]]s of iconic landmarks, the scenes in [[London]] were largely filmed in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title='Shanghai' wraps|url=https://variety.com/2002/film/news/shanghai-wraps-1117869042/|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=June 26, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|title=CZECH REPUBLIC: JACKIE CHAN FILMS "SHANGHAI KNIGHTS" ON LOCATION IN PRAGUE.|url=http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist//RTV/2002/05/16/205160047/?s=shanghai|publisher=[[ITN]]|date=May 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A third film was meant to be produced under the title ''Shanghai Dawn''. Plans for the film were posted on Jackie Chan's website, but after some news of casting and production plans, no film has been produced.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} While unconfirmed, it is speculated that the project has been halted indefinitely as there is no news nor a release date.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} In a February 7, 2003, interview, Owen Wilson said: "We're talking about it maybe starting in Hollywood and then going from there to Africa or the Pyramids ... I feel like we have the freedom to take them anywhere in time we want."{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

On May 14, 2015, MGM announced that they are moving forward with ''Shanghai Dawn''. [[Jackie Chan]], [[Lucy Liu]] and [[Owen Wilson]] are expected to reprise their roles as Chon Wang, Princess Pei-Pei and Roy O'Bannon respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perry |first=Spencer |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/440615-mgm-moving-forward-with-shanghai-dawn-starring-jackie-chan-and-owen-wilson |title=MGM Moving Forward with Shanghai Dawn, Starring Jackie Chan and Owen Wilson |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date=2015-05-14 |accessdate=2015-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2016, [[Jared and Jerusha Hess|Jared Hess]] signed on as director for the film while both Millar and Gough will develop a screen story with Theodore Riley and Aaron Buchsbaum writing the script for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/shanghai-dawn/ |title=Shanghai Dawn &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Movies - Empire |location=gb |publisher=Empireonline.com |date=2003-02-20 |accessdate=2017-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/new-shanghai-noon-sequel-napoleon-925947|title='Napoleon Dynamite' Director Jared Hess Tackling 'Shanghai Noon' Sequel (Exclusive)|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|last=Kit|first=Borys|date=September 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, Gough said the third film will be set in China because Chan "wants to showcase China in the way that the first film showcased the old West." Gough added that Chan and Wilson also have a hand in the creative process, saying "With those films, the collaboration of Jackie and Owen comes out on screen as they get along very well. With that in mind, you want to get their input in the story phase, so that when we got to script, it's based into the DNA of the story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://creativescreenwriting.com/into-the-badlands/|title=Into the Badlands: Blood-splattered Heroes and the One Degree of Jackie Chan|publisher=''Creative Screenwriting''|last=Swinson|first=Brock|date=November 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sound editor'''  is a creative professional responsible for selecting and assembling [[sound recordings]] in preparation for the final [[Audio mixing (film and television)|sound mixing]] or [[Audio mastering|mastering]] of a television program, motion picture, video game, or any production involving [[recorded sound|recorded]] or [[sound synthesis|synthetic]] sound.  Sound editing developed out of the need to fix the incomplete, undramatic, or technically inferior sound recordings of early [[talkies]], and over the decades has become a respected filmmaking [[craft]], with sound editors implementing the aesthetic goals of [[Sound design#Film|motion picture sound design]].

The [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] recognizes the artistic contribution of exceptional sound editing with the [[Academy Award for Sound Editing|Academy Award for Best Sound Editing]].

There are primarily three divisions of sound that are combined to create a final mix, these being dialogue, effects, and music.  In larger markets such as New York and Los Angeles, sound editors often specialize in only one of these areas, thus a show will have separate dialogue, effects, and music editors.  In smaller markets, sound editors are expected to know how to handle it all, often crossing over into the mixing realm as well.  Editing effects is likened to creating the sonic world from scratch, while dialogue editing is likened to taking the existing sonic world and fixing it.  Dialogue editing is more accurately thought of as "production sound editing", where the editor takes the original sound recorded on the set, and using a variety of techniques, makes the dialogue more understandable, as well as smoother, so the listener doesn't hear the transitions from shot to shot (often the background sounds underneath the words change dramatically from take to take).  Among the challenges that effects editors face are creatively adding together various elements to create believable sounds for everything you see on screen, as well as memorizing their sound effects library.

==Equipment==

The essential piece of equipment used in modern sound editing is the [[digital audio workstation]], or DAW.  A DAW allows sounds, stored as computer files on a host computer, to be placed in timed synchronization with a motion picture, mixed, manipulated, and documented.  The standard DAW system in use by the [[American film industry]], as of 2012, is [[Avid Technology|Avid]]'s [[Pro Tools]], with the majority running on [[Apple Computer|Mac]]s.  Another system in use presently is [[Yamaha]] owned [[Steinberg]]'s cross platform DAW [[Nuendo]] running on [[Apple Computer|Mac]]s using [[operating system]] [[Mac OS X]] but also on [[Windows XP]]. Other systems historically used for sound editing were:
* [[WaveFrame]], manufactured by [[WaveFrame (company)|WaveFrame]] of [[Emeryville]], [[California|CA]]
* Several DAWs have been manufactured by [[Fairlight (company)|Fairlight]]
* [[SonicSolutions]]
* [[AMS-Neve]] Audiofile
* AudioVision manufactured by Avid

The WaveFrame, Fairlights, and Audiofile were of the "integrated" variety of DAW, and required the purchase of expensive proprietary hardware and specialized computers (not standard PCs or Macs).  Of the two surviving systems, Pro Tools still requires some proprietary hardware (either a low cost portable device such as the "Mbox" or the more expensive multichannel A/D,D/A converters for more professional high end applications), while Nuendo (a successor to [[Cubase]]) is of the "host based" variety.

==Sound-effects library==
Sound-effects editors typically use an organized catalog of sound recordings from which sound effects can be easily accessed and used in film soundtracks. There are several commercially distributed sound-effects libraries available, the two most well-known publishers being [[Sound Ideas]] and The Hollywood Edge. Online search engines, such as [[Sounddogs]], A Sound Effect and Sonniss allow users to purchase sound effects libraries from a large online database.

Many sound effects editors make their own customized sound recordings which are accumulated into highly prized personal sound effects libraries. Often, sound effects used in films will be saved and reused in subsequent films. One exemplary case in point is a recording known as the "[[Wilhelm Scream]]" which has become known for its repeated use in many famous films such as ''[[The Charge at Feather River]]'' (1953), Pierre Marette Story (1957), ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'' (1980), ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' (1981), and ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992). Credited with naming and popularizing this particular recording is sound designer [[Ben Burtt]].

==History==

===Early talkies===
The first sound process to substantially displace [[silent film]]s in the moviegoing market was the [[Vitaphone]] process.  Under the Vitaphone process, a [[microphone]] recorded the sound performed on set directly to a [[phonograph]] master, which made Vitaphone recordings impossible to cut or resynchronize, as later processes would allow. This limited the Vitaphone process to capturing musical acts or one-take action scenes, like [[Vaudeville]] routines or other re-creations of stage performances; essentially, scenes that required no editing at all. However, [[Warner Brothers]], even as early as ''[[The Jazz Singer (1927 film)|The Jazz Singer]]'', began experimenting with the mixing of multiple phonograph recordings and intercutting between the "master" sync take and coverage of other angles. The original mixing console used to make the master recording of ''The Jazz Singer'', still viewable in the Warner Bros. Studio Museum, has no more than four or five knobs, but each is still visibly labeled with the basic "groups" that a modern [[sound designer]] would recognize: "music", "crowd", and so on.

Warner Bros. developed increasingly sophisticated technology to sequence greater numbers of phonograph sound effects to picture using the Vitaphone system, but these were rendered obsolete with the widespread adoption of [[sound-on-film]] processes in the early 1930s.

===Mechanical editing===
In a sound-on-film process, a microphone captures sound and converts it into a signal that can be photographed on film.  Since the recording is imposed linearly on the medium, and the medium is easily cut and glued, sounds recorded can be easily re-sequenced and separated onto separate tracks, allowing more control in mixing.  Options expanded further when optical sound recording processes were replaced with magnetic recording in the 1950s. Magnetic recording offered a better [[signal-to-noise ratio]], allowing more tracks to be played simultaneously without increasing noise on the full mix.

The greater number of options available to the editors led to more complex and creative sound tracks, and it was in this period that a set of standard practices became established which continued until the [[Digital data|digital]] era, and many of the notional concepts are still at the core of sound design, computerized or not:

* Sounds are assembled together onto '''tracks'''.  Many tracks are mixed together (or "dubbed together") to create a final film.
* A track will generally contain only one "type" or '''group''' of sound.  A track that contains dialogue only contains dialogue, a track that contains music should only contain music.  Many tracks may carry all the sound for one group.
* Tracks may be mixed a group at a time, in a process called '''predubbing'''.  All of the tracks containing dialogue may be mixed at one time, and all of the tracks containing [[Foley artist|foley]] may be mixed at another time.  In the process of predubbing, many tracks can be mixed into one.
* Predubs are mixed together to create a '''final dub'''.  On the occasion of the final dub, final decisions about the balance between different groups of sounds are made.

Historically the '''Dubbing Mixer''' (UK) or '''Re-Recording Mixer''' (US) was the specialist who mixed all the audio tracks supplied by the Dubbing Editor (with the addition of 'live sounds' such as Foley) in a special Dubbing Suite. As well as mixing, he would introduce equalization, compression and filtered sound effects, etc. while seated at a large console.  Often two or three mixers would sit alongside, each controlling sections of audio, e.g., dialogue, music, effects.

In the era of optical sound tracks, it was difficult to mix more than eight tracks at once without accumulating excessive [[noise]].  At the height of magnetic recording, 200 tracks or more could be mixed together, aided by [[Dolby]] noise reduction.  In the digital era there is no limit. For example, a single predub can exceed a hundred tracks, and the final dub can be the sum of a thousand tracks.

=== Digital sound ===
The mechanical system of sound editing remained unchanged until the early 1990s, when [[digital audio workstation]]s acquired features sufficient for use in film production, mainly, the ability to synchronize with picture, and the ability to play back many tracks at once with CD-quality [[fidelity]].  The quality of 16-bit audio at a 48&amp;nbsp;kHz [[sampling rate]] allowed hundreds of tracks to be mixed together
with negligible noise.

The physical manifestation of the work became computerized: sound recordings, and the decisions the editors made in assembling them, were now digitized, and could be versioned, done, undone, and archived instantly and compactly.  In the magnetic recording era, sound editors owned trucks to ship their tracks to a mixing stage, and transfers to magnetic film were measured in hundreds of thousands of feet.  Once the materials arrived at the stage, a dozen recordists and mix technicians required a half an hour to load the three or four dozen tracks a predub might require.  In the digital era, 250 hours of stereo sound, edited and ready to mix, can be transported on a single 160 GB [[hard drive]].  As well, this 250 hours of material can be copied in four hours or less, as opposed to the old system, which, predictably, would take 250 hours.

Because of these innovations, sound editors, as of 2005, face the same issues as other computerized, "knowledge-based" professionals, including the loss of work due to outsourcing to cheaper labor markets, and the loss of royalties due to ineffective enforcement of intellectual property rights.

===Animation sound editing===
In the field of animation, traditionally the sound editors have been given the more prestigious title of "film editor" in screen credits. As animated films are more often than not planned to the frame, the traditional functions of a film editor are often unnecessary. [[Treg Brown]] is known to cartoon fans as the sound effects genius of [[Warner Bros. Animation]]. Other greats of the field have included [[Jimmy MacDonald (sound effects artist)|Jimmy MacDonald]] of the [[Walt Disney Pictures|Walt Disney Studios]], Greg Watson and Don Douglas at [[Hanna-Barbera]], and Joe Siracusa of [[United Productions of America|UPA]] and various TV cartoon studios.

== Other fields ==
In the production of [[radio programming|radio program]]s and music, persons who manipulate sound recordings are known simply as "editors", in cases where the producers themselves do not perform the task.

'''''Star Trek: The Next Generation''''' ('''''TNG''''' and '''''ST:TNG''''') is an American [[science fiction on television|science fiction television series]] in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' franchise created by [[Gene Roddenberry]] that ran from 1987 to 1994. It follows the adventures of the [[starship]] [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]] and its crew set in the [[Alpha Quadrant]] (nearby regions of the [[Milky Way|Milky Way galaxy]]). ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' was the first [[live action]] ''Star Trek'' television series since the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' went off the air in 1969. The first episode takes place in the year 2364, 99 years after the start of the five-year mission described in the original series, which began in 2265.

''TNG'' featured a new crew that starred (for the majority of its seven-year broadcast run) [[Patrick Stewart]] as [[Captain]] [[Jean-Luc Picard]], [[Jonathan Frakes]] as [[Commander]] [[William Riker]], [[Brent Spiner]] as [[Lieutenant commander|Lt Commander]] [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], [[Michael Dorn]] as [[Lieutenant]] [[Worf]], [[LeVar Burton]] as Lt Commander [[Geordi La Forge]], [[Marina Sirtis]] as counselor [[Deanna Troi]], [[Gates McFadden]] as Dr. [[Beverly Crusher]], and a new ''Enterprise''. An introductory statement featured at the beginning of each episode's title sequence stated the ship's purpose in language similar to the opening statement of the original ''Star Trek'' series, but was updated to reflect an ongoing mission and to be gender-neutral:&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; 

{{quote|Space: the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship ''Enterprise''. Its continuing mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.}}

Roddenberry, [[Maurice Hurley]], [[Rick Berman]], [[Michael Piller]], and [[Jeri Taylor]] served as executive producers at various times throughout its production. The show was very popular, reaching almost 12 million viewers in its 5th season, with the series finale in 1994 being watched by over 30 million viewers.&lt;ref name=generations&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/arts/television-profits-reruns-and-the-end-of-next-generation.html?pagewanted=all|title=TELEVISION: Profits, Reruns and the End of 'Next Generation'|last=Schmuckler|first=Eric|date=July 24, 1994|website=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trektoday.com1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trektoday.com/articles/ratings_history.shtml|title=The Trek Nation – Star Trek Ratings History|website=www.trektoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''TNG'' premiered the week of September 28, 1987, drawing 27&amp;nbsp;million viewers, with the two-hour pilot "[[Encounter at Farpoint]]". In total, 176 episodes were made (including several two-parters), ending with the two-hour finale "[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]" the week of May 23, 1994. The series was broadcast in [[first-run syndication]] with dates and times varying among individual television stations. Several ''Star Trek'' series followed ''The Next Generation'': ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (1993–1999), ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' (1995–2001), ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' (2001–2005), and ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'' (2017–present). The series formed the basis for the seventh through the tenth of the [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]], and is also the setting of numerous novels, comic books, and video games. In its seventh season, ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' became the first and only syndicated television series to be nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series]]. The series received a number of accolades, including 19 Emmy Awards, two [[Hugo Award]]s, five [[Saturn Award]]s, and "[[The Big Goodbye]]" (S1E12) won a [[Peabody Award]]. Some of the highest rated episodes (by [[Nielsen ratings]]) were the pilot ("Encounter at Farpoint"), the finale ("All Good Things..."), the two-part "[[Unification (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unification]]", "[[Aquiel]]", "[[A Matter of Time (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|A Matter of Time]]", and "[[Relics (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Relics]]". Four episodes ("Encounter at Farpoint", "Sarek", "Unification", and "Relics") featured actors [[Leonard Nimoy]], [[Mark Lenard]], [[James Doohan]], and [[DeForest Kelley]] from the original ''Star Trek'' reprising their original roles.

{{:List of Star Trek: The Next Generation episodes}}

''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' aired for 7 seasons beginning on September 28, 1987 and ending on May 23, 1994. 

The series begins with the crew of the ''Enterprise''-D put on trial by an omnipotent being known as [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]], who became a recurring character. The god-like entity threatens the extinction of humanity for being a race of savages, forcing them to solve a mystery at nearby Farpoint Station to prove their worthiness to be spared. After successfully solving the mystery and avoiding disaster, the crew departs on its mission to explore strange new worlds.

Subsequent stories focus on the discovery of new life and sociological and political relationships with alien cultures, as well as exploring the [[human condition]]. Several new species are introduced as recurring antagonists, including the [[Ferengi]], the [[Cardassian]]s, and the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]]. Throughout their adventures, Picard and his crew are often forced to face and live with the consequences of difficult choices.

The series ended in its seventh season with a two-part episode "All Good Things...", which brought the events of the series full circle to the original confrontation with Q. An interstellar anomaly that threatens all life in the universe forces Picard to leap from his present, past, and future to combat the threat. Picard was successfully able to show to Q that humanity could think outside of the confines of perception and theorize on new possibilities while still being prepared to sacrifice themselves for the sake of the greater good. The series ended with the crew of the ''Enterprise'' portrayed as feeling more like a family and paved the way for four consecutive motion pictures that continued the theme and mission of the series.

===Background===
As early as 1972, [[Paramount Pictures]] started considering making a ''Star Trek'' film because of the show's popularity in syndication. However, with 1977's release of ''[[Star Wars]]'', Paramount decided not to compete in the science fiction movie category and shifted their efforts to a new ''Star Trek'' television series. The ''Original Series'' actors were approached to reprise their roles, sketches, models, sets and props were created for ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'' until Paramount changed its mind again and decided to create feature films starring the ''Original Series'' cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.syfy.com/syfywire/a-canceled-star-trek-show-from-the-70s-quietly-shaped-every-sequel-since|title=A canceled Star Trek show from the '70s quietly shaped every sequel since|last=Kaye|first=Don|date=2017-09-27|work=Syfy|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/12/27/remembering-star-trek-phase-ii|title=Remembering Star Trek: Phase II|last=Seibold|first=Witney|date=2017-12-27|website=IGN|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1986, 20 years after the original ''Star Trek''{{'}}s debut on [[NBC]], the franchise's longevity amazed Paramount Pictures executives. Chairman [[Frank Mancuso Sr.]] and others described it as the studio's "crown jewel", a "priceless asset" that "must not be squandered". The series was the most popular [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] television program 17 years after cancellation,&lt;ref name="harmetz19861102"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/arts/new-star-trek-plan-reflects-symbiosis-of-tv-and-movies.html?pagewanted=all | title=New 'Star Trek' Plan Reflects Symbiosis of TV and Movies |work=The New York Times | date=November 2, 1986 | accessdate=February 11, 2015 | last=Harmetz |first=Aljean | page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Harve Bennett]]-produced, ''Original Series''-era [[Star Trek (film series)|''Star Trek'' films]] did well at the box office.&lt;ref name="TNGComp1"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nemecek |first1=Larry |editor1-first=Dave |editor1-last=Stern |title=The Star Trek The Next Generation Companion |year=1992 |publisher=[[Pocket Books]] |location=1230 Avenue of the Americas, New York 10020 |isbn=0-671-79460-4 |page=1 |chapter=Rebirth }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Shatner]] and [[Leonard Nimoy]]'s salary demands for the film ''[[Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]]'' (1986) caused the studio to plan for a new ''Star Trek'' television series. Paramount executives worried that a new series could hurt the demand for the films, but decided that it would increase their appeal on videocassette and cable,{{r|harmetz19861102}} and that a series with unknown actors would be more profitable than paying the films' actors' large salaries.{{r|teitelbaum19910505}} Roddenberry initially declined to be involved, but came on board as creator after being unhappy with early conceptual work. ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' was announced on October 10, 1986,&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; and its cast in May 1987.&lt;ref name="ap19870521"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hUNgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7nANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1258,1275754 | title=Roddenberry names new Star Trek crew | work=The StarPhoenix | date=May 21, 1987 | accessdate=May 9, 2011 | agency=Associated Press | location=Saskatoon, Saskatchewan | pages=C3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paramount executive Rick Berman was assigned to the series at Roddenberry's request. Roddenberry hired a number of ''Star Trek'' veterans, including [[Robert H. Justman|Bob Justman]], [[D. C. Fontana]], Eddie Milkis and [[David Gerrold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/series/ENT/creative/69089.html|title= Star Trek Rick Berman Bio|accessdate=April 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early proposals for the series included one in which some of the original series cast might appear as "elder statesmen",{{r|harmetz19861102}} and Roddenberry speculated as late as October 1986 that the new series might not even use a spaceship, as "people might travel by some [other] means" 100 years after the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']].&lt;ref name="gendel19871011"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/292461160?accountid=35803 | title=NEW `TREK' IS ON THE LAUNCH PAD | work=Los Angeles Times | date=October 11, 1986 | accessdate=May 19, 2011 | author=Gendel, Morgan | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more lasting change was his new belief that workplace interpersonal conflict would no longer exist in the future; thus, the new series did not have parallels to the frequent "crusty banter" between Kirk, [[Spock]], and [[Leonard McCoy]].&lt;ref name="teitelbaum19910505"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1991-05-05/magazine/tm-2100_1_star-trek |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ybc7Wqbr?url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1991-05-05/magazine/tm-2100_1_star-trek |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |title=How Gene Roddenberry and his Brain Trust Have Boldly Taken 'Star Trek' Where No TV Series Has Gone Before : Trekking to the Top |work=Los Angeles Times |date=May 5, 1991 |page=16 |accessdate=April 27, 2011 |last=Teitelbaum |first=Sheldon |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to series actor Patrick Stewart, Berman was more receptive than Roddenberry to the series addressing political issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trekmovie.com/2010/06/22/video-patrick-stewart-on-how-he-expected-tng-to-fail-roddenberry-v-berman-star-trek-albatross-more/|title=VIDEO: Patrick Stewart On Expecting TNG To Fail, Roddenberry v Berman, Star Trek ‘Albatross’ + more|date=June 22, 2010|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series' music theme combined the fanfare from the original series theme by [[Alexander Courage]] with [[Jerry Goldsmith]]'s theme for ''[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]'' (1979). Some early episodes' plots derived from outlines created for ''Star Trek: Phase II''.&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; Additionally, some sets used in the ''Original Series''-era films were redressed for ''The Next Generation'', and in turn used for subsequent ''Original Series'' films.&lt;ref name="TNGTM"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Michael Okuda|Okuda, Michael]] and [[Rick Sternbach]]|year=1991|title=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-70427-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the transporter room set in ''TNG'' was used in the original ''Star Trek''{{'}}s transporter set.&lt;ref name="TNGTM" /&gt;

===Syndication and profitability===
Despite ''Star Trek''{{'}}s proven success, NBC and ABC only offered to consider pilot scripts for the new series, and CBS offered to air a [[backdoor pilot|miniseries that could become a series]] if it did well. That the [[Big Three television networks]] treated Paramount's most appealing and valuable property as they would any other series offended the studio. [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] wanted the show to help launch the new network, but wanted it by March 1987, and would only commit to 13 episodes instead of a full season. The unsuccessful negotiations convinced the studio that it could only protect ''Star Trek'' with full control.{{r|harmetz19861102}}{{r|gendel19871011}}

Paramount increased and accelerated the show's profitability by choosing to instead broadcast it in [[first-run syndication]]&lt;ref name="weinstein19880503"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1988-05-03/entertainment/ca-2130_1_star-trek | title=Newest 'Star Trek' Zooms at Warp Speed : 'Next Generation' Series Scores With Viewers and Critics Alike |work=Los Angeles Times | date=May 3, 1988 | accessdate=May 11, 2011 | last=Weinstein |first=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|teitelbaum19910505}}{{r|pearson2011}}{{rp|123–124}} on [[Independent station (North America)|independent station]]s (whose numbers had more than tripled since 1980) and Big Three [[network affiliate]]s.{{r|harmetz19861102}} The studio offered the show to local stations for free as [[barter syndication]]. The stations sold five minutes of commercial time to local advertisers and Paramount sold the remaining seven minutes to national advertisers. Stations had to commit to purchasing reruns in the future,{{r|weinstein19880503}} and only those that aired the new show could purchase the popular reruns of the ''Original Series''.&lt;ref name="davies2007"&gt;{{cite book | title=NBC: America's Network | chapter=The Little Program That Could: The Relationship Between NBC and ''Star Trek'' | publisher=University of California Press |last=Davies|first=Máire Messenger |author2=Roberta Pearson | editor=Hilmes, Michele |editor2=Henry, Michael Lowell | year=2007 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lhmw637JRgUC&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn=0-520-25079-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|222}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Trek Creator: The Authorized Biography of Gene Roddenberry|author=Alexander, David | publisher=Roc | year=1994|isbn=0-451-45440-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The studio's strategy succeeded. Most of the 150 stations airing reruns of the original ''Star Trek'' wanted to prevent a competitor from airing the new show; ultimately, 210 stations covering 90% of the United States became part of Paramount's informal nationwide network for ''TNG''.{{r|weinstein19880503}}{{r|harmetz19871004}} In early October 1987, more than 50 network affiliates pre-empted their own shows for the series pilot, "[[Encounter at Farpoint]]".  One station predicted that "''Star Trek'' promises to be one of the most successful programs of the season, network or syndicated".{{r|harmetz19871004}}

The new show indeed performed well; the pilot's ratings were higher than those of many network programs,&lt;ref name="harmetz19871004"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/04/arts/syndicated-star-trek-puts-dent-in-networks.html | title=Syndicated 'Star Trek' Puts Dent in Networks | work=The New York Times | date=October 4, 1987 | accessdate=May 9, 2011 | author=Harmetz, Aljean}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ratings remained comparable to network shows by the end of the first season, despite the handicap of each station airing the show on a different day and time, often outside prime time. By the end of the first season, Paramount reportedly received $1 million for advertising per episode, more than the roughly $800,000 fee that networks typically paid for a one-hour show;{{r|weinstein19880503}} by 1992, when the budget for each episode had risen to almost $2 million,{{r|cerone19921106}} the studio earned $90 million from advertising annually from first-run episodes, with each 30-second commercial selling for $115,000 to $150,000.{{r|mcclellan19920217}}&lt;ref name="cerone1992"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/1992-11-01/entertainment/ca-1591_1_action-series | title=TELEVISION : Action, Adventure, Aliens . . .

[[File:Gates with Denise August 2017.jpg|thumb|Denise and Gates were in Season 1 as Tasha Yar and Doctor Crusher, respectively, but were removed for Season 2.]]

C. Fontana|Fontana]], and others quitting after disputes with Roddenberry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Star Trek: "Where No One Has Gone Before" : A History in Pictures (Star Trek (Trade/hardcover)) |last=Dillard |first=J.

Writers found the show's "[[bible (writing)|bible]]" constricting and ridiculous and could not deal with Roddenberry's ego and treatment of them. It stated, for example, that "regular characters all share a feeling of being part of a band of brothers and sisters. As in the original ''Star Trek'', we invite the audience to share the same feeling of affection for our characters."{{r|teitelbaum19910505}}

Mark Bourne of ''The DVD Journal'' wrote of season one: "A typical episode relied on trite plot points, clumsy allegories, dry and stilted dialogue, or characterization that was taking too long to feel relaxed and natural."&lt;ref name="journal_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdjournal.com/quickreviews/s/st-tng.season01.q.shtml|title=DVD Journal: Star Trek: The Next Generation: Season One}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other targets of criticism included poor [[special effect]]s and plots being resolved by the ''[[deus ex machina]]'' of [[Wesley Crusher]] saving the ship.&lt;ref name="verdict_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/startrektngseason1.php|title=DVD Verdict: Star Trek: The Next Generation, Season One}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="scifi_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw8324.html|title=Sci Fi Weekly: Star Trek: The Next Generation—Season One DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Patrick Stewart]]'s acting skills won praise, and critics noted that characters were given greater potential for development than those of the original series.&lt;ref name="journal_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="verdict_1" /&gt; Both actors and producers were unsure whether [[Trekkie]]s loyal to the original show would accept the new one,&lt;ref name="beale19870721"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dJopAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=RoQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6987,2937125 | agency=Los Angeles Daily News | title=A Visit to 'Star Trek: The Next Generation' | work=Deseret News | date=July 21, 1987 | accessdate=May 9, 2011 | author=Beale, Lewis | pages=4T}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dougan19871003"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xpdKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R5QMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1428,666280 | agency=Scripps Howard News Service | title=Going where no cast has gone before... | work=Nashua Telegraph | date=October 3, 1987 | accessdate=May 9, 2011 | author=Dougan, Michael | page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; but one critic stated as early as October 1987 that ''The Next Generation'', not the movies or the original show, "is the real ''Star Trek'' now".&lt;ref name="macmillin19871030"&gt;{{cite news | agency=Newspaper Enterprise Association | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=N_QaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=bUcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5529,6154813 | title=New 'Star Trek' looks promising | work=Bowling Green Daily News | date=October 30, 1987 | accessdate=May 9, 2011 | author=MacMillin, Guy | location=Bowling Green, Kentucky | page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the events of most episodes of season one were self-contained, many developments important to the show as a whole occurred during the season. The recurring nemesis [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] was introduced in the pilot, the alien Ferengi had their sentinel showing in "[[The Last Outpost (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Last Outpost]]", the [[holodeck]] was introduced, and the romantic backstory between [[William Riker]] and [[Deanna Troi]] was investigated. "[[The Naked Now]]", one of the few episodes that depicted Roddenberry's fascination (as seen in the show's bible) with sex in the future, became a cast favorite.{{r|teitelbaum19910505}}

Later episodes in the season set the stage for serial plots. The episode "[[Datalore]]" introduced Data's [[evil twin]] brother [[Lore (Star Trek)|Lore]], who made several more appearances in episodes in subsequent seasons. "[[Coming of Age (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Coming of Age]]" dealt with Wesley Crusher's efforts to get into [[Starfleet Academy]] while also hinting at the threat to Starfleet later faced in "[[Conspiracy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Conspiracy]]". "[[Heart of Glory]]" explored Worf's character, [[Klingon]] culture, and the uneasy truce between the Federation and the Klingon Empire, three themes that played  major roles in later episodes. Tasha Yar left the show in "[[Skin of Evil]]", becoming the first regular Star Trek character to die permanently (although the character was seen again in two later episodes) in either series or film. The season finale, "[[The Neutral Zone (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Neutral Zone]]", established the presence of two of ''TNG''{{'}} most enduring villains: the Romulans, making their first appearance since the ''Original Series'', and, through foreshadowing, the Borg.

The premiere became the first television episode to be nominated for a [[Hugo Award]] since 1972. Six of the season's episodes were each nominated for an [[Emmy Award]]. "[[11001001]]" won for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series, "[[The Big Goodbye]]" won for Outstanding Costume Design for a Series, and "[[Conspiracy (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Conspiracy]]" won for Outstanding Achievement in Makeup for a Series.&lt;ref name="companion"&gt;{{cite book|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation Companion|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|author=Nemeck, Larry|isbn=0-7434-5798-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The Big Goodbye" also won a [[Peabody Award]], the first syndicated program{{r|weinstein19880503}} and only ''Star Trek'' episode to do so.

The top two episodes for Nielsen ratings were "Encounter at Farpoint" with 15.7, and "Justice" with 12.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treknation.com/nielsens/tng/season12.shtml|title=[TNG] Season 1–2 Ratings Archive|date=January 19, 2001|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010119055000/http://www.treknation.com/nielsens/tng/season12.shtml|archivedate=January 19, 2001|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season ran from 1987 to 1988.

===Season two===
{{Main|Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 2)}}
The series underwent significant changes during its second season. [[Beverly Crusher]] was replaced as Chief Medical Officer by [[Katherine Pulaski]], played by [[Diana Muldaur]], who had been a guest star in "[[Return to Tomorrow]]" and "[[Is There in Truth No Beauty?]]", two episodes from the original ''Star Trek'' series. The ship's recreational area, Ten-Forward, and its mysterious bartender/advisor, [[Guinan (Star Trek)|Guinan]], played by [[Whoopi Goldberg]], appeared for the first time. Owing to the [[1988 Writers Guild of America strike]], the number of episodes produced was cut from 26 to 22, and the start of the season was delayed. Because of the strike, the opening episode, "[[The Child (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Child]]", was based on a script originally written for ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'', while the season finale, "[[Shades of Gray (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Shades of Gray]]", was a [[clip show]].

Nevertheless, season two as a whole was widely regarded as significantly better than season one.{{r|verdict_2}} Benefiting from Paramount's commitment to a multiyear run and free from network interference due to syndication, Roddenberry found writers who could work within his guidelines and create drama from the cast's interaction with the rest of the universe.{{r|teitelbaum19910505}} The plots became more sophisticated and began to mix drama with comic relief. Its focus on character development received special praise.&lt;ref name="verdict_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/startrektngseason2.php|title=DVD Verdict: Star Trek: The Next Generation, Season Two}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-executive producer Maurice Hurley has stated that his primary goal for the season was to plan and execute season-long [[story arc]]s and [[character arc]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title="Star Trek: The Next Generation Season Two DVD Special Features}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hurley wrote the acclaimed episode "[[Q Who]]", which featured the first on-screen appearance of the Borg. Season two focused on developing the character Data, and two episodes from the season, "[[Elementary, Dear Data]]" and "[[The Measure of a Man (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Measure of a Man]]", featured him prominently.&lt;ref name="scifi_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/sfw/screen/sfw8559.html|title=Sci Fi Weekly: Star Trek: The Next Generation—Season Two DVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Miles O'Brien]] also became a more prominent character during the second season, while [[Geordi La Forge]] took the position of Chief Engineer. Klingon issues continued to be explored in episodes such as "[[A Matter of Honor]]" and "[[The Emissary (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Emissary]]", which introduced Worf's former lover [[K'Ehleyr]].&lt;ref name="journal_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdjournal.com/quickreviews/s/st-tng.season02.q.shtml|title=The DVD Journal: Star Trek: The Next Generation: Season Two}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five second-season episodes were nominated for six Emmy Awards, and "Q Who" won for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Drama Series.&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; The season ran from 1988 to 1989.

===Season three===
{{Main|Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 3)}}
Before the production of the third season in the summer of 1989, some personnel changes were made. Head writer Maurice Hurley was let go and [[Michael Piller]] took over for the rest of the series. Creator and executive producer Gene Roddenberry took less of an active role due to his declining health. Roddenberry gave Piller and Berman the executive producer jobs, and they remained in that position for the rest of the series' run, with Berman overseeing the production as a whole and Piller being in charge of the creative direction of the show and the writing room. Doctor Crusher returned from her off-screen tenure at Starfleet Medical to replace Doctor Pulaski, who had remained a guest star throughout the second season.  An additional change was the inclusion of the fanfare that was added to the opening credits of the second season, to the end of the closing credits.  [[Ronald D. Moore]] joined the show after submitting a [[spec script]] that became "[[The Bonding]]". He became the franchise's "[[Klingon]] guru",&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt;  meaning that he wrote most ''TNG'' episodes dealing with the Klingon Empire (though he wrote some Romulan stories, as well, such as "[[The Defector (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Defector]]"). Writer/producer [[Ira Steven Behr]] also joined the show in its third season. Though his tenure with ''TNG'' lasted only one year, he later went on to be a writer and showrunner of spin-off series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/startrek/view/library/creative/bio/69091.html|title= StarTrek.com Biography of Ira Steven Behr|accessdate=February 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Six third-season episodes were nominated for eight Emmys. "[[Yesterday's Enterprise]]" won for Outstanding Sound Editing for a Series and "[[Sins of the Father (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Sins of the Father]]" won for Best Art Direction for a Series.&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; After a chiropractor warned that the cast members risked permanent skeletal injury, new two-piece wool uniforms replaced the first two seasons' extremely tight spandex uniforms.&lt;ref name="BBC TNG"&gt;[http://bbc.adactio.com/cult/st/interviews/stewart/page14.shtml Is it true that you got back ache from your costume?] – BBC's Interview with actor Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard)&lt;/ref&gt; The season finale, the critically acclaimed episode "[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds]]", was the first season-ending [[cliffhanger]], a tradition that continued throughout the remainder of the series. The season ran from 1989 to 1990.

===Season four===
{{Main|Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 4)}}
[[Brannon Braga]] and [[Jeri Taylor]] joined the show in its fourth season. The fourth season surpassed the ''Original Series'' in series length with the production of "The Best of Both Worlds, Part II". A new alien race, the Cardassians, made their first appearance in "The Wounded". They later were featured in ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine''. The season finale, "Redemption", was the 100th episode, and the cast and crew (including creator Gene Roddenberry) celebrated the historic milestone on the bridge set. Footage of this was seen in the ''Star Trek'' 25th-anniversary special hosted by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy which aired later in the year. Seven fourth-season episodes were nominated for eight Emmys. "[[The Best of Both Worlds (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Best of Both Worlds, Part II]]" won for both Outstanding Sound Editing in a Series and Outstanding Sound Mixing for a Series.&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; Character Wesley Crusher left the series in season four to go to Starfleet Academy. "[[Family (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Family]]" was the only ''Star Trek'' episode not to have a bridge scene during the entire episode and is the only ''TNG'' episode where Data does not appear on-screen. The season ran from 1990 to 1991.

===Season five===
{{Main|Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 5)}}
The fifth season's seventh episode, "[[Unification (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Unification]]", opened with a dedication to ''Star Trek'' creator [[Gene Roddenberry]] (though the prior episode, "The Game", aired four days after his death). Roddenberry, though he had recently died, continued to be credited as executive producer for the rest of the season. The cast and crew learned of his death during the production of "[[Hero Worship (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Hero Worship]]", a later season-five episode. Seven fifth-season episodes were nominated for eight Emmys. "[[Cost of Living (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Cost of Living]]" won for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Costume Design for a Series and Outstanding Individual Achievement in Makeup for a Series, and "[[A Matter of Time (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|A Matter of Time]]" and "[[Conundrum (Star Trek: the Next Generation)|Conundrum]]" tied for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Special Visual Effects. In addition, "[[The Inner Light (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Inner Light]]" became the first television episode since the 1968 original series ''Star Trek'' episode "[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]" to win a [[Hugo Award]] for Best Dramatic Presentation.&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; Season five had the introduction of a jacket for Picard, worn periodically throughout the rest of the show's run. The observation lounge set was altered with the removal of the gold model starships across the interior wall and the addition of lighting beneath the windows. Recurring character Ensign [[Ro Laren]] was introduced in the fifth season. The season ran from 1991 to 1992.

===Season six===
{{Main|Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 6)}}
[[Image:Mae Jemison in Space.jpg|thumb|NASA Astronaut [[Mae Jemison]], shown here on a Space Shuttle mission is featured in "Second Chances" (S6E24) as a Lieutenant on the Enterprise-D]]
With the creation of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'', Rick Berman and Michael Piller's time was split between ''The Next Generation'' and the new show. Three sixth-season episodes were nominated for Emmys.

===Season seven===
{{Main|Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 7)}}
The seventh season was ''The Next Generation''{{'}}s last, running from 1993 to 1994. The penultimate episode, "[[Preemptive Strike (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Preemptive Strike]]", concluded the plot line for the recurring character Ensign [[Ro Laren]] and introduced themes that continued in ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' and ''Star Trek: Voyager''. ''The Next Generation'' series finale, "[[All Good Things... (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|All Good Things...]]", was a double-length episode (separated into two parts for reruns) that aired the week of May 19, 1994, revisiting the events of the pilot and providing a bookend to the series. Toronto's [[SkyDome]] played host to a massive event for the series finale. Thousands of people packed the stadium to watch the final episode on the stadium's [[JumboTron]].&lt;!-- wasn't this the highest-rated series finale of all time since MASH? can anyone find this info? --&gt; Five seventh-season episodes were nominated for nine Emmys, and the series as a whole was the first syndicated television series nominated for Outstanding Drama Series. To this day, ''The Next Generation'' is the only syndicated drama to be nominated in this category. "All Good Things..." won for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Special Visual Effects, and "[[Genesis (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Genesis]]" won for Outstanding Individual Achievement in Sound Mixing for a Drama Series. "All Good Things..." also won the second of the series' two Hugo Awards.&lt;ref name="companion" /&gt; "All Good Things..." also achieved the highest Nielson rating for all of Season 7, with a rating of 17.4.&lt;ref name="archive.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treknation.com/nielsens/tng/season7.shtml|title=[TNG] Season 7 Ratings Archive|date=February 10, 2001|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010210044026/http://www.treknation.com/nielsens/tng/season7.shtml|archivedate=February 10, 2001|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
Although the cast members were contracted for eight seasons,{{r|schmuckler19940724}} [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] ended ''The Next Generation'' after seven, which disappointed and puzzled some of the actors, and was an unusual decision for a successful television show. Paramount then made films using the cast, which it believed would be less successful if the show were still on television.&lt;ref name="svetkey19940506"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,302144,00.html | title=''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' readies for last episode | work=Entertainment Weekly | date=May 6, 1994 | accessdate=October 5, 2011 | author=Svetkey, Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt; An eighth season also would likely have reduced the show's profitability due to higher cast salaries and a lower price per episode when sold as [[strip programming]].{{r|schmuckler19940724}}

The show's strong ratings continued to the end; the 1994 series finale was ranked number two among all shows that week, between hits ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'' and ''[[Seinfeld]]'',&lt;ref name="schmuckler19940724"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/24/arts/television-profits-reruns-and-the-end-of-next-generation.html?pagewanted=all | title=Profits, Reruns and the End of 'Next Generation' | work=The New York Times | date=July 24, 1994 | accessdate=May 24, 2011 | author=Schmuckler, Eric}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was watched by over 30 million viewers.&lt;ref name=generations/&gt; ''TNG'' was the most-watched ''Star Trek'' show, with a peak audience of 11.5 million during its fifth season prior to the launch of ''DS9''.

==Story arcs and themes==
{{expand-section|date=September 2018}}
''Star Trek'' had a number of story arcs within the larger story, and oftentimes different episodes contributed to two or more different story or character arcs. Some are epitomized by the aliens the characters interact with, for example, ''TNG'' introduced the Borg and the Cardassians. The Klingons and Romulans had been introduced in the original series (1966–69); however, the Klingons were somewhat rebooted with a "turtle-head" look, although a [[retcon]] was given to explain this in an ''Enterprise'' episode. Other story arcs are epitomized by the appearances of a certain character such as Q or Ro Laren or by technology like the holodeck.

Certain episodes go deeper into the Klingon alien saga, which are famous for having an actual [[Klingon language]] made for them in the ''Star Trek'' universe. The Klingon stories usually involve Worf, but not all Worf-centric shows are focused on Klingons. The famous Duras sisters, a Klingon duo Lursa and B'Etor, were introduced on ''TNG'' in 1991 in the episode "Redemption" and they later appeared in the film ''Generations''.

''The Next Generation''{{'}}s average of 20&amp;nbsp;million viewers often exceeded both existing syndication successes such as ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]'' and network hits including ''[[Cheers]]'' and ''[[L.A.

The Enterprise and its setting is also in other Trekiverse games like ''[[Star Trek: Armada]]'' (2000). For example, in ''Star Trek: Armada'' voice actors from ''The Next Generation'' returned to their characters in the game including [[Patrick Stewart]] reprised the roles of Jean-Luc Picard and Locutus, [[Michael Dorn]] voiced Worf, [[Denise Crosby]] reprised [[Sela (Star Trek)|Sela]], and [[J. G. Hertzler]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://voicechasers.com/database/showactor.php?actorid=9878|title=J.G. Hertzler|website=Voice Chasers|access-date=2016-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; voiced Chancellor Martok. Several other voice actors who had been previously unaffiliated with ''Star Trek'' also voiced characters in the game, among them was Richard Penn.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0201172/ |title=Star Trek Armada |publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] |accessdate=Dec 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Star Trek: Armada II'' was set in the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' era of the Star Trek universe.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

''[[Star Trek: Hidden Evil]]'' (1999) included voice acting by [[Brent Spiner]] as [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]] and [[Patrick Stewart]] as Picard,&lt;ref name=ignreview&gt;{{cite news|title=Star Trek: Hidden Evil|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/1999/12/03/star-trek-hidden-evil|accessdate=April 14, 2013|newspaper=''IGN''|date=December 2, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was a follow-up from the ninth ''[[Star Trek]]'' film ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]''.&lt;ref name=ignreview/&gt;

Four films feature the characters of the series: ''[[Star Trek Generations]]'' (1994), ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' (1996), ''[[Star Trek: Insurrection]]'' (1998), and ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' (2002).

An ancestor of Worf, also played by Dorn, also appeared in ''Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country''.&lt;ref name="articles.sun-sentinel.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1993-04-04/entertainment/9302030994_1_worf-realistic-aspects-michael-dorn|title=That Macho Lt.

{{quote|I think it was kind of an honor they had my character be sort of the link between the two series. It was wonderful to be working with the other cast (from the original ''Star Trek'' series).

==Home media==
===VHS===
All episodes of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' were made available on [[VHS]] cassettes, starting in 1991. The entire series was gradually released on VHS over the next few years during the remainder of the show's run and after the show had ended.

The [[VHS]] for TNG were available on mail-order usually two episodes per [[VHS]] cassette.

===LaserDisc===
Paramount published all episodes on the [[LaserDisc]] format from October 1991 using an extended release schedule that concluded in May 1999.  Each disc featured two episodes with Closed Captions, Digital Audio, and CX encoding. Also published were four themed "collections", or boxed sets, of related episodes.  These included ''The Borg Collective'', ''The Q Continuum'', ''Worf: Return to Grace'', and ''The Captains Collection''.&lt;ref name="Blam Entertainment Group"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blam1.com/StarTrek/NextGeneration.htm |title=Star Trek: The Next Generation |last=Young |first=Blaine |date=April 19, 2003 |website= |publisher=Blam Entertainment Group |location= |accessdate=January 31, 2015 |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a production error with episode 166, "Sub Rosa", where a faulty master tape was used that was missing 4½ minutes of footage.  Though a new master copy of the episode was obtained, no corrected pressing of this disc was issued.&lt;ref name="Blam Entertainment Group"/&gt;

''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' was also released on LaserDisc in the non-US markets Japan and Europe.  In Japan, all episodes were released in a series of 14 boxed sets (two boxed sets per season), and as with the US releases were in the NTSC format and ordered by production code.  The European laserdiscs were released in the PAL format and included the ten two-part telemovies as well as a disc featuring the episodes ''Yesterday's Enterprise'' and ''Cause And Effect''.  The pilot episode, ''Encounter At Farpoint'', was also included in a boxed set called ''Star Trek: The Pilots'' featuring the pilot episodes from ''Star Trek: The Original Series'', ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'', and ''Star Trek: Voyager''.

===DVD===
The first season of the series was released on [[DVD]] in March 2002. Throughout the year the next six seasons were released at various times on DVD, with the seventh season being released in December 2002. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the series, [[CBS Home Entertainment]] and [[Paramount Home Media Distribution|Paramount Home Entertainment]] released ''Star Trek: The Next Generation&amp;nbsp;– The Complete Series'' on October 2, 2007. The DVD box set contains 49 discs. Between March 2006 and September 2008, "Fan Collective" editions were released containing select episodes of ''The Next Generation'' (and ''The Original Series'', ''Deep Space Nine'', and ''Voyager'') based on various themes. The individual episodes were chosen by fans voting on [[StarTrek.com]]. In total, six "Fan Collectives" were produced, along with a boxed set containing the first five collectives. In April 2013 all seven seasons of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' were re-released in new packaging featuring a silhouette of a different cast member on each box. However, the discs contained the identical content that was previously released in 2002.

===Blu-ray===
The original show was shot on high-quality [[35 mm film]], but had to be downscaled before editing and postprocessing to standard '80s and '90s TV resolution (video quality) for broadcast.  The show's final visual effects (e.g. all exterior shots of the starship ''Enterprise'', phaser fire or beaming fade-ins and -outs) were also composed only in standard resolution video. All previous home video and DVD releases used this severely downscaled version. To include such footage on [[Blu-ray]], using only [[Image scaling|upscaling]], would have resulted in a larger but blurred image, so CBS decided to use a more detailed approach to bring the show to high definition. They also opted to adhere to the show's original 4:3 aspect ratio.

A news release on the official website announced on September 28, 2011, in celebration of the series' twenty-fifth anniversary, that ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' would be completely re-mastered in 1080p and 4k high definition from the original 35&amp;nbsp;mm film [[Negative (photography)|negatives]] (consisting of almost 25,000 reels of original film stock). All the visual effects for each episode would be digitally recomposed from original large-format negatives and newly created CGI shots. The release would be accompanied by 7.1 [[DTS (sound system)|DTS]] Master Audio.

An initial disc featuring the episodes "Encounter at Farpoint", "[[Sins of the Father (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Sins of the Father]]", and "[[The Inner Light (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Inner Light]]" was released on January 31, 2012 under the label "The Next Level". The six-disc first season set was released on July 24, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2012/04/30/star-trek-tng-blu-ray-season-1%7ctitle=TV%7cwork=ew.com|title=TV|work=ew.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining seasons were released periodically thereafter, culminating in the release of the seventh season on December 2, 2014.

The entire re-mastered series is available on Blu-ray as individual seasons, and as a 41-disc box set titled ''The Full Journey''. Eventually, all remastered episodes will also be available for television syndication and digital distribution.&lt;ref name="startrek.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/the-next-generation-blu-rays-launch-in-2012|title=Star Trek The Next Generation Blu-rays Launch in 2012|last=Staff |first=StarTrek.com|accessdate=September 29, 2011| work=Startrek.com | date=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Okuda]] believes this is the largest film restoration project ever attempted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tng.trekcore.com/bluray/okuda1.html|title=Star Trek: The Next Generation: Blu-Ray Release|accessdate=July 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-offs and the franchise==
[[File:Enterprise-D bridge.jpg|thumb|Re-creation of the ''TNG'' starship bridge for ''[[Star Trek: The Exhibition]]'']]
''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' spawned different media set in its universe, which was primarily the 2370s but set in the same universe as first ''Star Trek'' TV shows of the 1960s. This included the aforementioned films, computer games, board games, theme parks, etc. In the 2010s there were rumors of a Captain Worf spin-off, the bridge officer that debuted on ''TNG'' and was also featured in the ''TNG'' spin-off show ''Deep Space Nine''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/star-trek-captain-worf-tv-show-michael-dorn/|title=Michael Dorn Confirms He's Working on a 'Star Trek: Captain Worf' TV Series [UPDATED]|date=September 3, 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' was the TV show launched following the conclusion of ''Star Trek: Voyager'' and was set 100 years before ''TOS'' and 200 years before ''TNG'', in addition to including some soft reboot elements with an all new cast. Some episodes connected to ''TNG'' directly including guest stars by Brent Spiner and connections to the events in ''TNG'''s fictional universe. The three-episode [[story arc]] consisting of "[[Borderland (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Borderland]]", "[[Cold Station 12]]", and "[[The Augments]]", with a Soong ancestor portrayed by ''The Next Generation'' regular [[Brent Spiner]] provides some backstory to Data's origins. Also, the ''Enterprise'' episode "[[Affliction (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Affliction]]" also helps explain the smooth-headed Klingons that sometimes appeared, a [[retcon]] that helped explain this varying presentation between ''TOS'', ''TNG'', and the films.

''Star Trek'' would not return to television as a show for over 12 years, until the debut of ''Star Trek: Discovery'' on CBS, but thereafter exclusively available on the internet service [[CBS All Access]] (Netflix internationally) at that time. The film franchise was rebooted in [[Star Trek (film)|2009]].

===The return of Picard===
On August 4, 2018, Patrick Stewart stated on social media that he would return to the role of Jean-Luc Picard in a project with CBS All Access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://deadline.com/2018/08/patrick-stewart-star-new-star-trek-series-jean-luc-picard-cbs-all-access-1202440156/|title=Patrick Stewart To Star In New ‘Star Trek’ Series As Jean-Luc Picard On CBS All Access|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|date=2018-08-04|work=Deadline|access-date=2018-08-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart wrote, "I will always be very proud to have been a part of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', but when we wrapped that final movie in the spring of 2002, I truly felt my time with ''Star Trek'' had run its natural course. It is, therefore, an unexpected but delightful surprise to find myself excited and invigorated to be returning to Jean-Luc Picard and to explore new dimensions within him. Seeking out new life for him, when I thought that life was over.
 
"During these past years, it has been humbling to hear stories about how ''The Next Generation'' brought people comfort, saw them through difficult periods in their lives or how the example of Jean-Luc inspired so many to follow in his footsteps, pursuing science, exploration and leadership. I feel I'm ready to return to him for the same reason – to research and experience what comforting and reforming light he might shine on these often very dark times.  I look forward to working with our brilliant creative team as we endeavor to bring a fresh, unexpected and pertinent story to life once more."

It is believed that the new project will be a continuation of the story after ''Star Trek: Nemesis'', and will not be a reboot of the series storyline as was done with the J.J. Abrams ''Star Trek'' films.

[[File:Pincerno - Sternschanze 01.jpg|thumb|Demonstration by leftist groups, amongst others for the squatted [[Hafenstraße]] houses in neighbouring St. Pauli on 20 December 1986]]
'''Sternschanze''' ({{audio|De-Sternschanze.ogg|German pronunciation}}) (lit. ''Star Sconce'') is a quarter in the center of [[Hamburg]] (Germany) within the [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] borough. In 2014, the population was 7,776 on an area of 0.6 sq km with a density of 14,113 inhabitants per sq km.&lt;ref name="hde"&gt;[http://www.hamburg.de/sehenswertes-sternschanze/ Ein kunterbuntes Viertel mit eigensinnigen Bewohnern], Hamburg.de, in German&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Reeperbahn]], it's Hamburg's best known entertainment and nightlife district. It is also known as '''''Schanzenviertel''''' ({{audio|De-Schanzenviertel.ogg|German pronunciation}}) and nicknamed '''''Schanze''''' ({{audio|De-Schanze.ogg|German pronunciation}}).

==History==
The name of the quarter originates from a [[sconce (fortification)|sconce]] (German: [[Schanze]]) formed like a star which has been built in the area in 1682 in front of the [[Hamburg city walls]]. From the 1930s to the 1970s the quarter was home for a large number of working-class people. Since the 1970s, families and students have started to move into the area. It is nearly, but not fully, congruent with the entertainment district of [[Schanzenviertel]] with its many bars and clubs, which is dubbed "Schanze" by its inhabitants. In the local slang, residents here live "in the sconce" ("in der Schanze").&lt;ref name="hde"/&gt;

The former concert house/theater building [[Rote Flora]] (built in 1888 as Flora concert hall) is also located here, at the street of [[Schulterblatt]]. It was [[Squatting|squatted]] by leftist groups in 1989, after there were plans since 1987/88 to rebuild it as a new musical theater. These plans were later realized near [[Holstenstraße station]] as [[Neue Flora]]. Since the beginning of the occupation, Rote Flora was used for cultural events by the squatting groups. In 2000, the building was acquired by real-estate agent Klausmartin Kretschmer, under a contract where the city of Hamburg prohibited him to make any alterations. Because he planned to make alterations anyway, conflicts arose with residents. In 2014, Hamburg city re-bought the building to avoid further conflicts; the building was renovated in 2015 by volunteers.&lt;ref name="hde"/&gt;

Since the beginning of the new millennium, Sternschanze is ''en vogue'' and subject to [[gentrification]]. Nevertheless, political demonstrations, mostly by leftist groups, take place here and sometimes lead to clashes with the police, frequently on 1 May ([[International Workers' Day|German Labour Day]]). [[Graffiti]] paintings can be found on many walls throughout the quarter.&lt;ref name="hde"/&gt; In 2008, the area of Schanzenviertel, which formerly was cut into three parts by the boundaries of [[Hamburg-Mitte]], [[Eimsbüttel]], and Altona, was merged into the new quarter of Sternschanze, which since then 
has belonged only to the Altona borough.

==Geography==
Sternschanze is located between the quarters of [[St. Pauli]], [[Altona-Altstadt]], [[Eimsbüttel (quarter)|Eimsbüttel]], and [[Rotherbaum]].

==Transportation==
[[Sternschanze station]] is serviced by [[Hamburg S-Bahn]] (lines S11, S21, S31) and [[Hamburg U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] trains ([[U3 (Hamburg U-Bahn)|U3 line]]), [[Feldstraße (Hamburg U-Bahn station)|Feldstraße]] - which is officially located in neighbouring [[St. Pauli]] quarter - by the underground line U3 only. [[Schlump (Hamburg U-Bahn station)|Schlump station]] is located on the north eastern boundaries of the Sternschanze quarter and served by underground lines [[U2 (Hamburg U-Bahn)|U2]] and U3.

"'''Surfin' Safari'''" is a song by American rock band [[The Beach Boys]],&lt;ref name=pc20/&gt; written by [[Brian Wilson]] and [[Mike Love]]. Released as a single with "[[409 (song)|409]]" in June 1962, it peaked at number 14 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits: Eighth Edition |last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song also appeared on the 1962 [[Surfin' Safari|album of the same name]].

==Recording==
The Beach Boys first recorded the song at World Pacific Studios on February 8, 1962 in what was the band's second ever recording session. However, the recordings from that session, engineered by Hite Morgan, would ultimately remain unreleased until the late sixties. The only difference instrumentally on this early version as opposed to the officially released version was the presence of [[Al Jardine]] on guitar instead of [[David Marks (musician)|David Marks]].

The instrumental track as well as the vocals for the officially released version were recorded at Western Recorders on April 19, 1962. The session, produced by Brian, featured David Marks and Carl Wilson on guitar; Brian Wilson on bass guitar and Dennis Wilson on drums. The song features Mike Love on lead vocals with backing vocals by Brian, Carl &amp; Dennis Wilson and Mike Love. Also recorded during that session were "[[409 (song)|409]]", "Lonely Sea" and "Their Hearts Were Full Of Spring". This session was recorded and given to Capitol Records as a demo tape. The label was impressed and immediately signed the band to their first major label. "Surfin' Safari" and "409" would be the band's first single to be issued under Capitol Records.

|source=—Review of "Surfin' Safari"  for [[Billboard magazine|Billboard]], June 9, 1962.&lt;ref name="Billboard"&gt;{{cite journal | date = June 9, 1962 |title=Reviews of New Singles |journal=Billboard Magazine |volume= 74 |issue= 23 |pages=40 |publisher= Nielsen Business Media, Inc. |doi= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sSkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PP4 |accessdate=April 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

The "Surfin' Safari" single backed with "409" was the band's second single and the first single to be released on the band's new label Capitol Records&lt;ref name=pc20&gt;{{Gilliland |url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc19770/m1/ |title=Show 20 - Forty Miles of Bad Road: Some of the best from rock 'n' roll's dark ages. [Part 1]
 |show=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States in June 1962. Originally Capitol Records felt "409" should be the 'A' Side, and first promoted the car song (according to Beach Boys biographers Badman, Gaines and Carlin) instead of "Surfin' Safari". However, as noted in the booklet to the 1993 CD box set ''[[Good Vibrations: Thirty Years of the Beach Boys]]'', radio station airplay in Phoenix, Arizona jump-started the B-side into a major nationwide hit (to date no copy of the first Capitol single with "409" as the A side has been discovered). The ''Billboard'' issue of July 14, 1962 cited Detroit as the major market of its national "break out".

The single peaked at the number 14 position on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart, with "409" also charting at number 76, making it the band's first double-sided hit single. It placed at number 10 on the ''Cash Box'' sales chart, and number 5 on UPI's national weekly survey used by newspapers. According to English pop music statistician Joseph Murrells in ''The Book of Golden Discs'', 1978 edition, it placed number 3 on one of the four major national charts then recognised, probably ''Variety''. Certainly its regional sales backed up these higher placings (than ''Billboard''). As well as its Capitol-record sales in New York, it was No. 1 in Los Angeles, San Diego, Dallas, Minneapolis, Buffalo and Hartford; and top five in Chicago, San Francisco, Phoenix, Tucson, Nashville, Cincinnati, Columbus, Dayton, Springfield MASS.

Capitol A&amp;R executive Nick (Nik) Venet, who signed the group and is listed as producer on their first two albums, is quoted in the Steven Gaines book as saying regarding the release that "The biggest order Capitol had from a single market all year [1962] was from New York City - where there was no surfing. It sold approximately nine hundred thousand records, but not enough for a gold."

In October 1962, the "Surfin' Safari" single was the first to be released by the band in the United Kingdom. However, given mediocre reviews at best, the single failed to make any impact on the charts. It did qualify as the Beach Boys' first international chart-topper, however. By the end of September it had peaked at number seven in Australia's ''Music Maker'' chart — only reaching the Billboard top 20 the following week — then in November spent three weeks at number one in Sweden (both charts cited by contemporary issues of ''Billboard''). In Germany, the World Pacific Studios recording of the song was used as the single release instead of the more well-known version. The single failed to chart.

In January 1970, the World Pacific Studios sessions recording of the song was issued on Trip Records as the B-side of a "Surfin'" single re-issue. The single however failed to make any impact on the charts.

==Album and alternate releases==
The song was first released on a single 45 RPM record and then later, it was released on the band's debut ''Surfin' Safari'' album, and on a number of later 'greatest hits' compilations. The song's appearance on the 1993 ''Good Vibrations'' box set is sourced from the original demo tape master, lacking the fade-out added before its release as a single.

Three takes of the early World Pacific Studios recordings of the song were eventually released on CD in 1991 on the archival release ''[[Lost &amp; Found (1961-62)]]'' as well as subsequent re-issues of that album which featured alternate album titles. A live concert performance of the tune "Surfin' Safari" is featured in the short documentary "One Man's Challenge", written and directed by Dale Smallin. Filmed July 28, 1962 (with the same lineup as the official Capitol single) at the Azuza Teen Club, this particular visual version of the song is, according to author [[Jon Stebbins]] in 'The Lost Beach Boy', "The only known performance footage of the Pendleton-shirt era Beach Boys."

'''''The King of Fighters 2003''''' ('''''KOF 2003''''') is a [[fighting game]] produced by [[SNK Playmore]] for the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo Geo]] arcade and home platforms in 2003. It is the tenth game in ''[[The King of Fighters]]'' series and the last one released for the Neo Geo, which served as the primary platform for the series since ''[[The King of Fighters '94]]''. It was ported to  [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] (not compatible with the Xbox 360), was released in North America] as a two-in-one bundle with the preceding game in the series, ''[[The King of Fighters 2002]]''.

==Gameplay==
The 3-on-3 Team Battle Format is applied in the game once again, just like the past editions. It also uses a Multi-Shift format that allows players to change characters during the middle of battle. When the "Change OK" sign is displayed above the Power Gauge, the player can do a Quick Shift and change characters immediately, or perform a Switch-Off Attack against the opponent that will consume one Power Gauge stock.

The game also features a Tactical Leader System, in which one of the members of the team is designated as the Leader. The chosen Leader can have an access to an exclusive move known as the "Leader Super Special Move" (in addition to the regular "Super Special Moves"). However, this usually requires two Power Gauge stocks to be able to perform it.

As in the last game in the series, the players' Power Gauge can hold up to 3 stocks at the beginning of a match. Unlike the previous game, however, the player starts with a full gauge of three stocks right away. When one team loses one of its members, the maximum capacity of Power Gauge stocks is increased by one, giving the losing team a handicap against the opposing team. In addition, unlike the previous ''KOF'' games, each hit only earns the player 100 points.

==Plot==
{{rewrite section|date=March 2013}}
The game revolves around The King of Fighters, an elite fighting tournament. From within the history of this remarkable and extraordinary competition, Rugal Bernstein was defeated, the Orochi was sealed away, and the NESTS cartel had fallen. The tournament at the center of the game is sponsored by an unknown patron, whose identity becomes a matter of public interest in the country. Perhaps as a result of this, it attracts a large number of contestants.

With the inception of the new "multi-shift" rule in this KOF tournament, wherein competitors can freely tag off during battles, the competition becomes a 'hot topic' and provokes widespread discussion. It also leads to a speedy execution of the match with unified team strategies.

In preparation for the tournaments, stadiums with the capacity to hold tens of thousands of people are procured from cities across the world and established in city centers. Schedules are completed and spectators move from one location to another to watch the preliminary matches. To create the atmosphere of a true street fight, competitions are broadcast live on giant screens.

'''''The Shadowcatchers: A history of cinematography in Australia''''' is a photographic history of Australian cinematography, written by [[Martha Ansara]] and published by the [[Australian Cinematographers Society]], which launched the project for its 50th Anniversary in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Cinematographers Society website, National Headquarters: Up and Running! http://www.cinematographer.org.au/01_cms/details.asp?ID=636&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
''The Shadowcatchers'' documents the history of Australia's national cinema and the industrial practices and role of the cinematographer from the 1890s to 2011. The book contains excerpts of oral histories of cinematographers recorded for the [[National Film and Sound Archive]] of Australia&lt;ref name="National Film and Sound Archive, Oral History Program"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nfsa.gov.au/collection/oral-history|title=National Film and Sound Archive, Oral History Program}}&lt;/ref&gt; discussing the nature of filmmaking under the impact of broader political, social and technological forces throughout Australian cinematic history, as well as photographs from Australian and international stills photographers.

The book was developed with input from veteran members of the Australian Cinematographers Society, creating a sense of an insiders’ view of what happens behind the camera. Themes include the changing culture and technology of Australian cinematography, the specific nature of the work, the importance of actuality and commercials production, international influences, relationships between cinematographers and directors, cast and crew, and the sorts of studios and locations where films have been made. Twenty-six biographies are also presented, covering early cintematographers such as the Burnes of Queensland, Academy Award Winners such as [[Dean Semler]], [[Russell Boyd]] and [[John Seale]], war correspondents [[Damien Parer]]&lt;ref&gt;The Kokoda Track: Exploring the site of the battler fought by Australians in World War II, ''About the Kokoda Track: 1942 and Today'' http://kokoda.commemoration.gov.au/about-the-kokoda-track/damien-parer.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Australia's War 1939–1945, Fall of Timor, http://www.ww2australia.gov.au/japadvance/guerillas.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Neil Davis (cameraman)|Neil Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;Australian War Memorial website, Neil Davis profile http://www.goodbuymovie.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Movietone News]] cameraman Bill Trerise.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Cinematographers Society website, John William (Bill) Trerise ACS (1898-1987) http://www.cinematographer.org.au/01_cms/details.asp?ID=542&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Shadowcatchers'' has been published in two editions: a softcover edition and a hardback collectors edition, limited to 250 numbered copies and signed by the five living Australian winners of the Academy Award for cinematography, [[Dean Semler]],&lt;ref&gt;Dean Semler (1996), ''Dances With Wolves'', The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1337948793575&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Seale]],&lt;ref&gt;John Seale (1996), ''The English Patient'', The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1337948612300&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrew Lesnie]],&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Lesnie (2001), ''The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring'', The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1337948311661&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russell Boyd]]&lt;ref&gt;Russell Boyd (2003), ''Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World'', The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1337949059542&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Dion Beebe]].&lt;ref&gt;Dion Beebe (2005), ''Memoirs of a Geisha'', The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1337948050763&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Topic Continuity in Discourse'''''—subtitled ''A Quantitative Cross Language Study''—is a book edited by [[Talmy Givón]], with contributions by himself and other experts in various languages. It is part of the series [[Typological Studies in Language]] (a supplement series to the [[academic journal]] ''[[Studies in Language]]'') and was published by [[John Benjamins]] in 1983.

The book presents a cross-linguistic hierarchy of [[natural language]] "[[Syntax|syntactic]] coding of [[topic–comment|topic]] accessibility" (including, for example, discourse participant prominence).&lt;ref name="Givón 1983: 17"&gt;Givón (1983): 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Givón describes the aim of the research, documented in the book, as "the rather ambitious goal ... to define, in a preliminary but cross-linguistically stable fashion, the basic principles of ''iconicity'' underlying the syntactic coding of the topic identification domain."&lt;ref&gt;Givón (1983): 18, emphasis original.&lt;/ref&gt;

Givón's starting point was his previously published (1978, 1979, 1981 and 1982) one-dimensional scale. As listed by him, from "most continuous/accessible topic" to "most discontinuous/inaccessible topic" this was as follows:&lt;ref name="Givón 1983: 17"/&gt;
* zero [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]]
* unstressed-[[Bound variable pronoun|bound pronoun]]s and grammatical agreement
* stressed-independent pronouns
* right-dislocated [[Definiteness|definite]] [[noun phrase]]s (NP)
* neutral-ordered NPs
* left-dislocated NPs
* Y-moved NPs (or "contrastive topicalization")
* [[Cleft sentence|cleft]] and focus constructions
* [[Reference|referential]] indefinite NPs

The language specific studies provided in the book are on [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Amharic]], [[Ute language|Ute]], [[Biblical Hebrew]], [[Spanish language in the Americas|Latin-American Spanish]], written English, spoken English, [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]]. The data from these languages were analysed according to a common [[methodology]], explained by Givón in the introduction to the book, and agreed upon by all the other contributors. The methodology involved quantitative measurements, which although [[Statistics|statistical]], were designed to be [[Experiment|repeatable]] and applicable to any language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="39736">The '''Tri-Ergon''' [[sound-on-film]] system was developed from around 1919 by three German inventors, [[Josef Engl]] (1893–1942), [[Joseph Massolle]] (1889–1957), and [[Hans Vogt Engineer)|Hans Vogt]] (1890–1979).

The system used a [[photoelectric]] recording method and a non-standard film size (42mm) which incorporated the sound track with stock 35mm film. With a Swiss backer, the inventors formed Tri-Ergon AG in [[Zurich]], and tried to interest the market with their invention.

There were a number of companies which used the Tri-Ergon name:
* Tri-Ergon AG ([[Zurich]], Switzerland), acquired the rights to the original 1919 patents from the inventors in 1923
* Tri-Ergon-Musik AG ([[St. Gallen]], Switzerland), founded c1926, held the patents for the rest of the world outside Germany
* Tri-Ergon-Musik AG (Berlin), which made phonograph records and owned the patents for Germany, formed in 1927: a subsidiary or branch of the St. Gallen company
* Tri-Ergon-Photo-Electro-Records (Berlin), a record label subsidiary of Tri-Ergon-Musik AG (Berlin)

[[UFA GmbH|Ufa]] acquired the German sound film rights for the Tri-Ergon process in 1925, but dropped the system when the public showing of their first sound film suffered technical failures.

The Tri-Ergon system appeared at a time when a number of other sound film processes were arriving on the market, and the company soon merged with a number of competitors to form the '''[[Tobis Film|Tobis]]''' syndicate in 1928, joined by the Klangfilm AG syndicate in 1929 and renamed as '''Tobis-Klangfilm''' by 1930. While Tri-Ergon became the dominant sound film process in Germany and much of Europe through its use by Tobis-Klangfilm, American film companies were still squabbling over their respective patents. For a time Tri-Ergon successfully blocked all American attempts to show their sound films in Germany and other European countries, until a loose cartel was formed under an agreement in Paris in 1930.

However, [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] of the [[Fox Film Corporation]] acquired the US rights for the Tri-Ergon system and, backed by Tri-Ergon AG, began a patent infringement battle in the courts in 1929 against much of the American film industry. The dispute wasn't settled until 1935, when Fox lost his final appeal in the [[US Supreme Court]]. A new Paris accord was signed in March 1936, which held until the start of the [[Second World War]]. The Tri-Ergon system continued in use in Germany and the continent during the war.

==Etymology==
The name Tri-Ergon means "the work of three", and is derived from {{lang-el|τρία|translit=tria}}), meaning three, and {{lang|el|ἔργον}}, {{transl|el|érgon}}, meaning 'deed, action, work, labour, or task'; cognate with {{lang-ang|weorc}} (English work).&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%94%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%BF%CE%BD "ἔργον"]. ''Wiktionary''. Retrieved 3 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsoundsweden.se/backspegel/triergon.html "Tri-Ergon"] (in Swedish). ''FilmSoundSweden''. Accessed 3 September 2017. With many photos. NB Swedish translates relatively well into English with a machine translator.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[erg]] also derives from the same word {{lang|el|ἔργον}}.

==Design==
[[File:Optical-film-soundtrack.svg|thumb|Left: [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]] sound track with variable density recording, similar to Tri-Ergon. Right: Variable area track as used by [[RCA Photophone]] ]]
The Tri-Ergon process involved recording sound onto film using the "variable density" method, used by Movietone and [[Lee De Forest]]'s [[Phonofilm]], rather than the "variable area" method later used by [[RCA Photophone]].&lt;ref&gt;There are analogies to be found with 'variable density' and the 'variable area' recording by considering sound broadcasting using [[Frequency Modulation|FM]] and [[Amplitude Modulation|AM]]: or the difference between editing a [[bar code]] and a [[Commons:Tutorial for Audio file editors|sound file]].&lt;!--If this is nonsense, please delete. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Tri-Ergon used a special form of microphone without mechanical moving parts (Cathodophone) for sound pickup and a special [[electric discharge tube]] for variable density film recording. For reproduction of sound, the system used an [[electrostatic loudspeaker]].

Two specific patents in the Tri-Ergon system would later cause controversy. The Tri-Ergon film used an extra 7mm sound strip attached to the edge of a standard 35mm film, resulting in a new film 42mm wide. This was achieved by a "double-printing" method by which the film and sound tracks were recorded and developed separately, then printed together onto a common positive.{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=58n}} This required special adjustments on the standard projectors, which was not well received by the industry.{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=53}} The other patent was a "flywheel" which allowed the film to flow smoothly through sound reproducing equipment.{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=53}}

An original Tri-Ergon sound [[movie projector]] (dated to 1923) is in the collection of the [[Deutsches Museum]] in [[München]], [[Germany]].

==History==
===Beginnings===
[[File:Gedenktafel Kurfürstendamm 68 (Charl) Alhambra Lichtspiele.JPG|thumb|Plaque at the site of the former Alhambra theatre on [[Kurfürstendamm]], [[Charlottenburg]], Berlin, commemorating the first public showing of sound films in 1922 by Engl, Massolle, and Vogt (in German).{{efn|Translation of the plaque:
:In this building, the former Alhambra cinema, visitors witnessed on the 17 September 1922 the world première of the first sound film of the German inventors' Triergon company. Dr. Jo Engl, Hon. Dr. Eng. Joseph Masolle, Hon. Dr. Hans Vogt&lt;ref&gt;The abbreviations are ''Ehren halber'' and ''[[honoris causa]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; established with their still used light-sound process the technical foundations of sound film. Dedicated by [[:de:Friedrich Jahn (Gastronom)|Friedrich Jahn]] 17 September 1964.&lt;ref&gt;In the 60s and early 70s the old Alhambra building housed one of Jahn's [[Wienerwald (restaurant)|Wienerwald]] fast food restaurants.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hans Vogt, the only surviving the member of the team, was present at the unveiling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gedenktafeln-in-berlin.de/nc/gedenktafeln/gedenktafel-anzeige/tid/tonfilm/ "Tonfilm"]. ''Gedenktafeln in Berlin''. Retrieved 21 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;}} ]]

Massolle, Engl and Vogt secured patents from 1919 in Germany, and applied for a US patent on 20 March 1922.&lt;ref name=Altoona &gt;[https://casetext.com/case/american-tri-ergon-corp-v-altoona-publix-theaters American Tri-Ergon Corp v. Altoona Publix Theaters (1933)] ''Casetext''. Retrieved 3 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first public showing of Tri-Ergon sound films took place in the {{ill|Alhambra (Kino)|de}} at 68 [[Kurfürstendamm]], Berlin on 17 September 1922. The inventors sold their patent to Swiss financial backers ([[St. Gallen]]) who formed Tri-Ergon [[Aktiengesellschaft|AG]]) in [[Zürich]], [[Switzerland]] to continue developing their process.{{sfn|Kreimeier|1999|p=178}}

In 1924 [[UFA GmbH|Universum-Film AG]] (Ufa) produced three hours' worth of vaudeville shorts with sound, similar to those produced by [[Warner Brothers]], who used a [[sound-on-disc]] system.{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=53}} Tri-Ergon AG licensed the recording film rights to Ufa in January 1925 and Masolle briefly became technical director of Ufa's first sound-film division.{{refn|The giant film conglomerate [[Ufa]] was secretly formed in 1917 by the German State as part of its propaganda effort.{{sfn|Kreimeier|1999|p=22-25}} }}{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=53}}

However, the non-standard film format was not popular: even a well-publicized tour of Germany in 1925 failed to generate much interest.{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=53}}

Ufa's first sound film, the 20-minute short ''{{ill|Das Mädchen mit den Schwefelhölzern (1925)|de}}'' ('The Match Girl') was directed by Guido Bagier. Bagier (who worked at Ufa between 1922 and 1927 as producer and musical advisor){{sfn|Ford|2011|p=217}} also wrote the music for the film; the screenplay was by Hans Kyser. It premièred at the Mozartsaal&lt;ref&gt;The Mozartsaal was a cinema converted from a former concert hall, located upstairs in the [[Neues Schauspielhaus]], 5 Nollendorfplatz, Berlin.&lt;/ref&gt; in December 1925, but was a total flop in terms of technical sound quality.{{sfn|Kreimeier|1999|pp=102, 178}} According to Bagier, the fiasco was due to technical problems with the playback equipment.{{sfn|Ford|2011|p=217}}{{sfn|Kreimeier|1999|p=102}}

===The Parufmet agreement===
In the meantime, [[UFA GmbH|Ufa]], having ducked the whole issue of sound fims, had still fallen into severe financial difficulties with productions of vastly expensive silent films accompanied by a live symphony orchestra playing a specially-composed score, such as [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[The Last Laugh (1924 film)|Der Letzte Mann]]'' (1924), with [[Emil Jannings]] and ''[[Faust (1926 film)]]''; and both parts of [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[Die Nibelungen]], with a score by [[Gottfried Huppertz]].&lt;!-- May need to ref this lot, but I'm fairly sure that all these points are all reffed up in the respective articles. Hmm, not all.--&gt;


[[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] stepped into the financial breach with the highly restrictive [[Parufamet]] agreement of December 1925, whereby the American firms took control (and revenue) of all Ufa's first-run theatres to show American films.{{sfn|Horak|1993|p=55}} Only one significant German film was shown in Ufa first-run cinemas in Berlin during this whole time the agreement was in effect: [[Joe May]]'s silent ''[[The Farmer from Texas]]''. The film received no publicity build-up and was dropped after only one week at the [[Ufa-Palast am Zoo]].{{sfn|Horak|1993|p=55}} Almost no German films were shown in US cinemas: and Ufa made no new films in Germany at all while the Parufamet contract was in force.{{sfn|Horak|1993|pp=56-7}}

Although this injection of foreign capital allowed the construction in 1926 of Ufa's enormous new Große Halle studios at [[Neubabelsberg]] (designed by Carl Stach-Urach, who had re-built the Ufa-Palast am Zoo the previous year), the Ufa management with [[Erich Pommer]] in charge of production continued to over-spend by enormous amounts. Lang's ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' cost over an (estimated) 5,100,000 Reichsmarks. Yet the only venue where ''Metropolis'' could be seen in the whole of Germany was at a single, small—yet equisitely decorated—cinema showing second-rate films, the [[Ufa-Pavillon am Nollendorfplatz]].&lt;ref name="Bar-Sagi" &gt;{{cite web |last=Bar-Sagi |first=Aitam |title='Metropolis' around the World: The First Season: 1926/7 |website=The Film Music Museum |date=24 October 2013 |url=http://fimumu.com/articles/metropolis-atw/ |accessdate=3 January 2017}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The box office receipts amounted to approximately 75,000 Reichsmarks, slightly over 0.01% of the budget.

===Expansion===
[[File:William Fox 1921.jpg|thumb|left|150px|William Fox in 1921]]
From 1926, needing more revenue, Tri-Ergon AG sought backers in the US. On 5 July 1927 the Hungarian-American [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] of the [[Fox Film Corporation]] personally purchased the U. S. rights to the Tri-Ergon patents for $50,000,{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=53}} forming the American Tri-Ergon Corporation.

Fox Film had also purchased sound-on-film patents from [[Freeman Harrison Owens]] and [[Theodore Case]], although it seems that only the Case patents were actually used in creating the new sound-on-film system he dubbed [[Movietone sound system|Fox Movietone]]. One of the first feature films to be released in Fox Movietone was ''[[Sunrise (film)|Sunrise]]'' (1927) directed by [[F. W. Murnau]]. Fox also used the system for the long-running [[newsreel]] series ''[[Fox Movietone News]]''.

On 5 March 1927 [[Alfred Hugenberg]]'s industrial Hugenberg-Gruppe took over Ufa and, as part of their initial cost-cutting measures, closed down the Tri-Ergon department. Ludwig Klitzsch, the managing director, dismissed Bagier and his team, sidestepping the problem of "the talkies" with their vast technical, financial, and legal problems.{{sfn|Ford|2011|p=216}}{{sfn|Kreimeier|1999|p=178}}

On 12 May 1927, Tri-Ergon-Musik-AG (Berlin), a subsidiary of Tri-Ergon-Musik-AG (St. Gallen) was formed by Joseph Masolle.{{sfn|Bock|Mosel|Spazier|2003|p=21}}{{sfn|Ford|2011|p=218}}&lt;!-- Ford says Masolle formed it in 1926 --&gt; By 1931 it was a subsidiary of [[IG Farben]], which was founded in 1925.{{sfn|Southard|2000|pp=99-102}} In December 1927 the Dutch firm of H. J. Küchenmeister founded a new company, International Maatschappij voor Sprekende Films NV (Sprekende Films NV) to profit from its patented 'Meisterton' system. Within a year the Dutch company would have almost total control of the Tobis and the Tri-Ergon patents.{{sfn|Dibbets|2003|p=28}}

At the 1927 [[Donaueschingen Festival|Baden-Baden festival]] of contemporary chamber-music, pioneering sound films with original scores by leading avant-garde composers were shown at special 'Film and Music' sessions. [[Walther Ruttmann]]'s abstract experimental film ''Opus III'' (1924), with an original score for chamber orchestra by [[Hans Eisler]], was shown twice: firstly as a silent film with the music performed live and synchronized using Blum‘s Musikchronometer, and then as a sound film (no longer extant) using the Tri-Ergon process.&lt;ref&gt;Ruttman would go on to direct [[Berlin: Symphony of a Great City]] with Meisel's avant-garde music.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn| Ruttmann's ''Lichtspiel Opus I'' was accompanied by a specially-written score by [[Max Butting]]. {{harv|Bendazzi|2015|pp=56–57}}. }} The sound-film recording was supervised by Bagier, now working for Tri-Ergon-Musik A.G.{{sfn|Ford|2011|p=217}}

Other films shown at the festivals in 1928-9 included American cartoons with music by [[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Ernst Toch]], newsreels ([[Darius Milhaud]]), and abstract films by [[Hans Richter (actor)|Hans Richter]] (Hindemith).{{sfn|Ford|2011|p=217}}

By mid-1928 a number of short films had been made using the Tri-Ergon process, produced by Tobis-Industrie GmbH (TIGes) (Berlin).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmportal.de/institution/tobis-industrie-gmbh-tiges-berlin_ea12b10c8c514676a9dc34cd95b40c87 "Tobis-Industrie GmbH (Tiges) (Berlin)"] (in German).

In September 1928 Walter Ruttman's full-length ''Stätten von deutscher Arbeit and Kultur'' was shown in the Vienna Urania cinema, along with ''Hans Moser als Wiener Dienstmann'' (1928), starring the Viennese comic actor [[Hans Moser (actor)|Hans Moser]]. In the autumn of a touring exhibition of sound films was shown throughout Austria.{{sfn|Patrasch|2007|p=165}} The German première of ''Ein Tag auf dem Bauernhof'' took place on 12 September 1928 at the Mozartsaal.


In July 1928 [[Reichs-Rundfunk-Gesellschaft|German State Radio]] commissioned Tri-Ergon-Musik A.G. to produce a sound film for the opening of the fifth German Radio Exhibition in Berlin. Their film ''Deutscher Rundfunk'', with music by [[Edmund Meisel]], showed at the exhibition in August.{{sfn|Ford|2011|p=219}} Reviewers of the Radio Exhibition screenings were impressed by the reproduction of natural sounds, such as street noises, marching soldiers, hammering machines, steam ships and zoo animals. It was later released in a shorter version, ''Tönende Welle''.{{sfn|Ford|2011|p=219}}

===Tobis and cartel wars===
Competing American sound film companies such as [[RKO]] (formed by [[RCA]]) were becoming more organised in Germany. To protect the market from American domination the German government lobbied for a cartelization of all important German sound film patents, and on 30 August 1928 the '''Tobis''' Tonbild-Syndicate A.G. was formed to consolidate the Tri-Ergon patents and several hundred more. The four original main companies who made up the Tobis syndicate were:{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=54}} 
* Messter-Ton Film, founded in Berlin by [[Oskar Messter]], the founder of the German film industry who had been making and showing [[sound-on-disc]] films since 1903. He merged his companies with [[Ufa]] at its founding in 1917, and owned a number of significant sound film patents. 
* Tri-Ergon-Musik AG (St. Gallen) formed c1926 by Tri-Ergon AG (Zurich), which since 1923 had owned the patents registered by the original inventors in 1919. This was the parent company of Tri-Ergon-Musik AG (Berlin), formed by Masolle on 12 May 1927,{{sfn|Ford|2011|p=218}} which made both sound films, and also phonograph records with the same photo-electric method used in the film soundtracks. The records were sold under the name Tri-Ergon-Photo-Records. 
* Deutsche Tonfilm AG (Hannover), which in 1925 acquired the Petersen-Poulsen patents for Gerrman speaking countries, signed a monopoly contract with Phoebus-Film (Berlin) to produce sound films.{{sfn|Kreimeier|1999|p=179}} Deutsche Tonfilm, Phoebus-Film and Lignose Hörfilm (see [[Jules Greenbaum#References|Jules Greenbaum]]) were all affiliated with the chemical-industrial giant [[IG Farben]], also formed in 1925.{{sfn|Kreimeier|1999|p=179}}{{sfn|Southard|2000|p=102}}
* The Dutch firm of H. J. Küchenmeister, who had started making 'Meisterton' sound films in 1925 with his own Ultraphone [[sound-on-disc]] system, which used two gramophone pick-up needles to give a stereo-like sound.{{sfn|Kreimeier|1999|p=179}} He formed a holding company - Küchenmeisters Internationale Ultraphoon Maatschappij NV (Ultraphone) - which launched on the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]] in October 1928{{sfn|Dibbets|2003|p=27}} It swiftly combined with German interests to form H. J. Küchenmeister-Kommanditgesellschaft (Berlin).

In this deal, Tobis acquired the option to purchase outright Tri-Ergon-Musik AG (Berlin), and made an agreement with Tri-Ergon-Musik-AG (St. Gallen) to use the Tri-Ergon sound film patents. Tobis was almost completely controlled by Küchenmeister by 1929.{{sfn|Southard|2000|p=101}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-13781, Richard Tauber.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Richard Tauber]] at a concert in the [[Berlin Zoological Garden]] in August 1932]]
''[[I Kiss Your Hand, Madame]]'' ('Ich küsse ihre Hand, Madame') was the first Tobis film with sound. Starring [[Harry Liedtke]] and [[Marlene Dietrich]] it premièred on January 16, 1929. Free of dialogue, the film's only sound segment occurs when the tenor [[Richard Tauber]] sings the title song on the soundtrack (00:32). Although Tauber appears with Liedtke and Dietrich in publicity shots for the film, he didn't appear on screen himself.&lt;ref name=Filmportal /&gt; The film was distributed by Deutsche Lichtspiel-Syndikat (DLS),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/company/co0012004/ "Deutsche Lichtspiel-Syndikat (DLS) (de)"]. IMDb. Retrieved 22 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  a chain of 800 cinemas which had installed Küchenmeister's 'Meisterton' sound system in 1928.{{sfn|Dibbets|2003|p=29}}

The main competitor of Tobis was the Klangfilm syndicate, a partnership formed in early 1929 between the electrical manufacacturers [[Siemens &amp; Halske]], [[AEG]], and [[Polyphon]]-Werke A.G. (who sold [[Polydor]] records). By March 1929 Tobis merged with Klangfilm, and the resulting syndicate was renamed '''[[Tobis-Klangfilm]]''' in 1930.{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=54}}{{sfn|Ford|2011|p=261}}

Tobis-Klangfilm made a deal with the British and French Phototone companies, and British Talking Pictures, Ltd. This made the patents of [[Lee de Forest]] available to Tobis-Klangfilm. Tobis-Klangfilm now had branches for production, distribution and equipment throughout Europe (including [[Tobis Portuguesa]]) and the United Kingdom.{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=54}}

Meanwhile, also in 1929, Ufa and Klangfilm planned a separate contract to develop their own sound film production. Tobis (possibly because its earlier failure with Ufa in 1925) stood in direct competition with the giant Ufa as a producer of film.&lt;ref name=Filmportal &gt;[http://www.filmportal.de/en/topic/the-emergence-of-german-sound-film ''The Emergence of German Sound Film'']. Filmportal.de. Retrieved 3 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The premiere in March 1929 at the Baden-Baden Festival of [[Walther Ruttmann]]'s Tobis film ''Melodie der Welt'' (''[[Melody of the World]]''), introduced the longest German sound film at the time with some 40 minutes running time.&lt;ref name=Filmportal /&gt;

The Dutch firm of H. J. Küchenmeister planned a massive expansion of Tobis across Europe, and on 19 May 1929 issued 5,000 shares of its new company, 'Internationale Maatschappij voor Accoustiek NV' (Accoustiek NV) on the [[Amsterdam Stock Exchange]]. This was the largest Dutch flotation to date, netting 5 million Dutch [[guilder]]s (approx. 8.3 million [[German Reichsmark|reichsmark]]s, $2 million, £500,000). It was over-subscribed by 3 billion guilders (about 5 billion RM), in keeping with the general stock exchange euphoria of the times.{{sfn|Dibbets|2003|p=30}}


Although Tobis-Klangfilm's preparations were complete by the spring of 1929, [[Warner Bros.]] was still technically far ahead and in May 1929 tried to present ''[[The Singing Fool]]'' in Germany, a Part-Talkie with [[Al Jolson]] in a follow-up to ''[[The Jazz Singer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;From the start of 1930, beginning with ''The Jazz Singer'', [[Warner Bros.]] only produced [[Sound-on-film|optical soundtracks]], having had ditched their [[Vitaphone]] [[sound-on-disc]] system.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobis-Klangfilm sued both Warner Bros. and Electrical Research Products, Inc. (ERPI)—[[Western Electric]]'s subsidiary for distributing its sound motion picture equipment—for patent infringement.&lt;ref&gt;Warner Bros. was itself in dispute with ERPI over royalty payments.&lt;/ref&gt; After a number of court cases, on 22 July 1929 the German appeals court upheld Tobis-Klangfilm's exclusive rights to sound-on-film recording in Germany: the company was victorious in all subsequent appeals.{{sfn|Gomery|1976|pp=53, 54}}

Tobis-Klangfilm won further injunctions in Switzerland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Holland, and Austria. Even William Fox, owner of Tri-Ergon's American rights, was prevented from presenting films in Berlin. No American films were shown at all in Berlin, and Tobis-Klang refused an offer from ERPI, [[Will H. Hays]] organised an American boycott through his company [[Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America]] (MPPDA).{{sfn|Gomery|1976|pp=55-56}}

The première of [[Carmine Gallone]]'s Tobis production, ''[[Das Land ohne Frauen]]'' ('The Land Without Women') - almost two hours long - on September 30, 1929, was hailed by reviews in the press as "the first feature-length German sound film".&lt;ref name=Filmportal /&gt;

On 29 October 1929 the [[Wall Street Crash]] occurred, triggering a worldwide financial crisis.

Ufa's first major sound film, [[Melody of the Heart]], was released in December 1929, followed in April 1930 by ''[[The Blue Angel]]'' with Dietrich and [[Emil Jannings]], and music by [[Friedrich Hollaender]]; and in September that year ''[[The Three from the Filling Station (1930 film)|The Three from the Filling Station]]'' with [[Lilian Harvey]], [[Willy Fritsch]] and songs by the [[Comedian Harmonists]]. The success of these early sound films led the Berlin Chamber of Commerce to comment: "By now, sound film has become firmly established."&lt;ref name=Filmportal /&gt;

===1930 Paris accord===
[[File:General Electric logo.svg|thumb|left|150px|[[General Electric]] logo]]
[[File:Berlin AEG Turbinenfabrik.jpg|thumb|AEG Turbine factory (c1909), designed by [[Peter Behrens]] ]]
The stalemate in the ongoing patent wars between the US and European interests was broken by RCA. In the summer of 1929 [[General Electric]] (GE) acquired a part interest in [[AEG]], one of the companies making up the original Klangfilm AG syndicate. With GE's influence, RCA and Tobis-Klangfilm signed a cooperative agreement. On 22 July 1930, at a conference in [[Paris]], [[France]], RCA, ERPI, and Tobis-Klangfilm formed a loose cartel to divide the world into three regions for selling sound recording and reproducing apparatus.

All pending litigation was dropped. ERPI and RCA acquired exclusive rights to sell their own recording and reproduction equipment, and distribute films in the United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, India, and the Soviet Union. Royalties collected in the United Kingdom were split, 25 percent going to Tobis-Klangfilm, who also acquired similar exclusive rights in Central Europe and Scandinavia.{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=57}}

===Patent battles in the US===
In 1930 Tri-Ergon AG's 1922 patent application was still pending in the United States. [[William Fox (producer)|William Fox]] (who had bought the US Tri-Ergon rights in 1926) had lost control of his own company, Fox Studios, to ERPI. Backed by Tri-Ergon AG in Switzerland, he intensified the attempt to get the patent granted. In September 1931 the efforts of American Tri-Ergon Corporation's patent lawyers paid off, and he was finally assigned the US patent for the Tri-Ergon rights in the United States. The assignor was Tri-Ergon AG, who had originally applied for the US patent back in 1922.&lt;ref name=Altoona /&gt; The Tri-Ergon patents named particular technical features that claimed to precede all other sound-on-film patents, such as the [[flywheel]] on the sound drum.

Fox then separately sued (as test cases) Altoona Publix Theatres Inc., which leased and operated the projection equipment from [[RCA]];&lt;ref name=Altoona /&gt; and [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] for infringement of the "double printing" method. He then sued RCA and ERPI - and the all the US film companies which used the Tri-Ergon design - for infringement, specifically the [[flywheel]] on the sound drum. During a series of legal tussles Fox at first won his lawsuit on appeal and then lost it after an unusual reversal of decision by the [[United States Supreme Court|U. S. Supreme Court]] in October 1934 not to review the case. The Supreme Court surprisingly relented, heard the appeal and finally ruled in March 1935 that neither system was 'new', and that there were prior inventions.{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=58-60}} An appeal by Alttona Publix was rejected on 1 April 1935.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ravellaw.com/opinions/473e58bcecb4737217671f9a8b95dd2b "Altoona Publix Theatres, Inc. v. American Tri-Ergon Corp."] 294 U.S. 734, (U.S. 1935) Decided 1 April 1935. ''Ravel''. Retrieved 3 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although this brought a swift end to the sound film wars between various competing US and European (Dutch, German, and Swiss) interests, it also meant that the original Tri-Ergon system was never formally adopted in the United States. As a result, William Fox's own American Tri-Ergon Corporation failed to collect an estimated $100 million in licensing fees.{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=60}}

===Financial woes===
In 1931 the effects of the [[Wall Street Crash]] eventually hit Küchenmeister's Sprekende Film NV, which owned Tobis. The Dutch firm had over-extended itself with bank loans which were not renewed, and its Ultraphone business went bankrupt.{{sfn|Dibbets|2003|p=30}} The hugely complex chain of inter-linked Tobis companies fell to pieces, necessitating a complete reorganisation of the whole business. Dutch bankers and creditors began re-financing the profitable parts of the company, which emerged in 1932 as 'International Tobis NV' or '''Intertobis''' {{sfn|Dibbets|2003|p=32}}

===1932 Paris conference===
[[File:Reichstagsbrand.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag on fire]] in 1933]]
The cartel rules began to irk foreign film companies, who had to pay ERPI a license fee (royalties) to shoot the film, and then had to pay Tobis-Klang to show the film in the areas allotted to them under the 1930 accord. Another conference was held in Paris during February 1932, but Tobis-Klangfilm demanded extra royalty fees, and American companies began withholding payments.{{sfn|Gomery|1976|p=60}}

Following the [[Reichstag fire]], the NSDAP (Nazi Party) began to suspend civil liberties and eliminate political opposition. The [[Communist Party of Germany|Communists]] were excluded from the Reichstag. [[Adolf Hitler]] called on [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] members to vote for the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]] on 24 March 1933, completing [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power|his rise to power]] from 1919 through the [[Beer Hall Putsch]] in 1923 to [[Chancellor#Germany|Chancellor]] ('Reichkanzler') of the German Reich.

During the nationalisation of the German film industry in 1935, the interests of Intertobis and Ufa were clandestinely transferred to Cautio GmbH.{{sfn|Dibbets|2003|p=32}} Cautio was personally set up in 1929 by [[Max Winkler]], its sole owner and shareholder, as a front company for the secret transfer of funds from the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] regime.{{sfn|Hale|2015|p=127}} In 1935 Winkler was named by Hitler as "Reich Plenipotentiary for the German Film Industry". He had links to [[Max Amann]], Hitler's sergeant from 1915 to 1918, president of [[Eher Verlag]] since 1922, and president of the Reich Media Council and Reich Press Leader from c1933.{{sfn|Whetton|2005|p=214}}

The new head of Tobis-Klang-film, Dr. Hans Henkel, journeyed to New York for personal negotiations in March 1936 to effect a new agreement. After two weeks' discussion all parties signed the new 1932 Paris accord on 18 March 1936 which included payment of royalties in the local currency where the film was being shown. Most American companies had withdrawn anyway from the German market by 1936, since much of their revenues were frozen under strict currency laws under the NSDAP.{{sfn|Gomery|1976|pp=60-61}}

==Tri-Ergon records==
[[File:Kabarett der Komiker; Bernard Etté 013584a.jpg|thumb|[[Bernard Etté]] in 1938]]
A subsidiary, Tri-Ergon Musik AG of [[Berlin]], made commercial [[phonograph]] records for the German, French, Swedish and Danish markets from about 1928 to 1932. The records were advertised and sold as "{{ill|Tri-Ergon Photo-Electro-Records|de}}".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tedstaunton.com/labels/1920_1929/pages/Tri_Ergon_1/tri_ergon_1.html "Tri-Ergon Photo-Electro-Record (Germany) / 1929"].

Received 22 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company released records of popular jazz and dance bands, and classical music. The Hungarian dance band leader {{ill|Géza Komor|de}} made a numerous records under both his own name and under the pseudonym of 'Harry Jackson', along with [[Bernard Etté]], and [[Friedrich Hollaender]] with the New Yorkers dance orchestra ("It's a Million to One You're in Love", TE 5137).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=120p-D5jcJo ''It's a Million to One You're in Love''], Tri-Ergon records on Youtube.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hollaender had conducted the choir and orchestra for the performances of a huge pageant-like spectacle, [[Max Reinhardt]]'s production of ''[[The Miracle (play)|The Miracle]]'' by [[Karl Vollmoeller|Karl Vollmöller]] at London's [[Olympia (London)|Olympia]] in 1911.

{{nihongo|'''''Valis: The Fantasm Soldier'''''|夢幻戦士 ヴァリス|Mugen Senshi: Varisu|lit."Dream Soldier: Valis"}}, also known as either just '''''Valis''''' or '''''The Fantasm Soldier''''', is a video game developed by [[Namco Tales Studio|Wolf Team]] and published by [[Telenet Japan]] in 1986 originally for the [[MSX]] and [[PC-88]] home computers and then ported to, remade or re-released for several other systems over the years. It is the first video game in the [[Valis (series)|''Valis'' series]] which stars a Japanese teenager named Yuko who uses a mystical sword called Valis to defend Earth and other worlds. Its critical reception has varied depending on the version, including critical acclaim for the 1992 [[PC Engine]] [[Video game remake|remake]].

==Gameplay==
In its original [[PC-88]] and [[MSX]] version, ''Valis: The Fantasm Soldier'' is a side-scrolling [[platform game]]. Wielding the game's titular sword, the main character fights through each level's enemies while jumping across ledges, then confronts a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] at the end of each level. At certain points in the game, gameplay pauses, and cinematic [[cutscene]]s regarding the game's storyline play. There is also a gameplay-tweaked and content-cut version for the [[FM-7]].&lt;ref name=hc1&gt;{{cite web|last=Derboo |first=Sam |url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/valis/valis.htm |title=Valis |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date=2014-04-20 |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Family Computer ([[Famicom]]) side-scrolling [[action role-playing game]] version of ''Valis'' differs considerably from the other versions of the game. While the basic plot remains the same, gameplay has moved from linear stage design to larger maze-style levels with multiple paths, often of a questionable design, resulting in a very high difficulty level especially since there is neither a password nor save system.&lt;ref name=hc1/&gt;

The [[Sega Genesis|Mega Drive/Genesis]] remake features gameplay system more similar to later games in the series, in particular ''[[Valis III]]''. Like other side-scrolling games of the era, the four [[D-pad]] buttons move the character, and the three fire buttons perform three actions for the main character: sliding, jumping, and swinging her sword that can be upgraded in three stages and there are alternative firing modes. The player can also use magic spells, gaining them after defeating bosses.&lt;ref name=hc2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregaming101.net/valis/valis2.htm |title=Valis |publisher=Hardcore Gaming 101 |date= |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[PC Engine]] remake features improvements in the gameplay system (such as single high jumps instead of two-phase jumps and the sliding move damaging enemies) and voiced cutscenes.&lt;ref name=hc2/&gt; The mobile remake further added new stages and alternate costumes.

==Plot==
{{nihongo|Yuko Asou|麻生 優子|Asou Yūko}} (voiced by [[Sumi Shimamoto]]) is a schoolgirl in late 1980s Japan who is fated to protect three different realms – our own Earth, the land of spirits, and Vecanti, the Dream World – by wielding a mystical sword known as Valis. Demon lord {{nihongo|Rogles| ろぐれす|Roguresu}} (voiced by [[Hideyuki Tanaka]]) extinguishes a light in Vecanti which functions as a source of power for those who live there, and in a desperate plea for salvation, its queen {{nihongo|Valia ばりあ|Baria}} (voiced by [[Yoshiko Sakakibara]]) reaches out for a brave soul who can help them in their time of despair. Yuko on Earth is the one who answers the call, being summoned by magical forces into Vecanti to liberate them from the evil of Rogles, who brainwashes Yūko's classmate and girlfriend {{nihongo|Reiko Kirishima|きりしま 麗子|Kirishima Reiko}} (voiced by [[Yūko Mita]]) into helping him try and put an end to the Valis warrior.

Against increasingly difficult odds, Yuko prevails. Although Reiko is killed in the process, her memory returns as she dies in Yuko's arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/msx_force_12/msx_force_8#page/n23/mode/2up/ |title=MSX Force 1-12 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==
The original PC-88 and MSX were all developed by [[Wolf Team]] and published by [[Telenet Japan]].&lt;ref name=hc1/&gt; [[Tokuma Shoten]] would later develop and release an almost completely redone version for the Famicom in 1987 only in Japan.&lt;ref name=hc1/&gt;

In 1991, Telenet and [[Renovation Products|Renovation]] (United States) released versions for the Mega Drive/Genesis, developed by Riot.&lt;ref name=hc2/&gt; An enhanced remake of the Mega Drive version was also developed by Riot and released by Telenet for the PC Engine's [[TurboGrafx CD|Super CD-ROM²]] add-on in 1992.&lt;ref name=hc2/&gt; In 2005-2006, [[Bandai Namco]] released another remake of the game, this time for mobile phone platforms in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=家庭用ゲーム |url=http://bandainamcoent.co.jp/corporate/press/bandainetworks/news/index.php?view=332&amp;ref=200603 |title=バンダイネットワークス株式会社のプレスリリース &amp;#124; バンダイナムコエンターテインメント公式サイト |publisher=Bandainamcoent.co.jp |date=2013-07-03 |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Sam Derboo from Hardcore Gaming 101 wrote the original versions "might be a horrible, unplayable mess, but its call to fame to begin with wasn't the gameplay, but the pioneering in cinematic cutscenes - two years even before ''[[Ninja Gaiden (NES video game)|Ninja Gaiden]]''. (...) What's left is the quite excellent [[chiptune]] music, really the only part the original ''Valis'' is worth being remembered for."&lt;ref name=hc1/&gt; Derboo further described the Family Computer version as a "typical Famicom action RPG - competently executed, but super obfuscate and endlessly frustrating."&lt;ref name=hc1/&gt; Nevertheless, ''MSX Club'' "highly recommended" the MSX version as an "excellent" action game,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scans.bytemaniacos.com/es/msx_club/MSX_Club_47.pdf |format=PDF |title=?MSXClub |date=December 1988 |website=Scans.bytemaniacos.com |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; even as ''Arcades'' gave it a score of only 9/20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Arcades/arcades_numero10/Arcades%20-%2010%20-%20page%20069.jpg |format=JPG |title=King Knight |website=Download.abandonware.org |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mega Drive / Genesis remake received rather mediocre but mostly positive review scores in the West, including 65% from ''[[Sega Visions]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Sega-Visions-Issue-08#page/n49/mode/1up/ |title=Sega Visions Issue 08 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 76% from ''Consoles+'', 65% from ''Joystick'', and 5/10 from ''ASM''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/Aktueller_Software_Markt_-_Ausgabe_1992.06/Aktueller%20Software%20Markt%20-%20Ausgabe%201992.06#page/n117/mode/1up/ |title=Aktueller Software Markt - Ausgabe 1992/06 |publisher=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardcore Gaming 101's Derboo opined "''Valis'' on the Genesis isn't a bad game, definitely leagues above the original, but still not particularly enjoyable. It's just so slow and boring."&lt;ref name=hc2/&gt; ''[[Sega Force]]'' bashed its "dull and repetitive" gameplay and declared: "High graphical content, low playability level. That's ''Valis'' in a nutshell."&lt;ref&gt;''Sega Force'' UK 5, page 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the PC Engine / TurboGrafx version of ''Valis'' was acclaimed by critics. Its review scores included 81% from ''Consoles +'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Consoles%20Plus/consoleplus_numero009/Consoles%20%2B%20009%20-%20Page%20058%20%28mai%201992%29.jpg |format=JPG |title=Super CD ROM Review |website=Download.abandonware.org |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Consoles%20Plus/consoleplus_numero009/Consoles%20%2B%20009%20-%20Page%20059%20%28mai%201992%29.jpg |format=JPG |title=Super CD ROM Review |website=Download.abandonware.org |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 78% from ''Génération 4'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Generation%204/generation4_numero044/Gen4%20N044%20-%20Page%20141.jpg |format=JPG |title=Console Test Review |website=Download.abandonware.org |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 77% from ''Joypad'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Joypad/joypad_numero009/Joypad%20009%20-%20Page%20120%20%281992-06%29.jpg |format=JPG |title=PC Engine Review |website=Download.abandonware.org |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Joypad/joypad_numero009/Joypad%20009%20-%20Page%20121%20%281992-06%29.jpg |format=JPG |title=PC Engine Review |website=Download.abandonware.org |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 83% from ''Joystick''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Joystick/joystick_numero027/Joystick%20027%20-%20Page%20167%20%281992-05%29.jpg |format=JPG |title=Valis : 83% |website=Download.abandonware.org |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Hardcore Gaming 101, "by its mechanics and level design, it is no doubt the most well-executed game in the entire series. It's still a bit too derivative and pedestrian to be counted among the genre greats like ''[[Castlevania (1986 video game)|Castlevania]]'' and ''[[Ninja Gaiden (NES video game)|Ninja Gaiden]]'', but at least very, very high second tier."&lt;ref name=hc2/&gt; ''[[Retro Gamer]]'' highlighted it as "arguable the best" entry in a "great series".&lt;ref&gt;"Minority Report: Japanese warriors". ''Retro Gamer'' 129, page 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Lucas M. Thomas from [[IGN]] included ''Valis'' among top ten unreleased TurboGrafx games: "If you're the kind of gamer who likes to know the exact color of panties being worn by your platforming hero girls, ''Valis'' is where you want to invest your time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2008/10/17/retro-remix-top-10-unreleased-turbografx-titles?page=3 |title=Retro Remix: Top 10 Unreleased TurboGrafx Titles - IGN - Page 3 |publisher=Uk.ign.com |date=2008-10-17 |accessdate=2015-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
