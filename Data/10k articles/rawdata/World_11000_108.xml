The '''African Wildlife Foundation''' ('''AWF'''), founded in 1961 as the African Wildlife Leadership Foundation, is an international conservation organization that focuses on critically important [[Landscape ecology|landscapes]] in Africa.{{sfn|About AWF}}

AWF's programs and conservation strategies are designed to protect the wildlife and wild lands of Africa and ensure a more sustainable future for Africa's people. AWF stops the degradation of animals and the world's environment.

Since its inception, the organization has protected endangered species and land, promoted conservation enterprises that benefit local African communities, and trained hundreds of African nationals in conservation—all to ensure the survival of Africa's unparalleled wildlife heritage.

==Early years==

[[File:Russell train.gif|thumb|218px|Russell Train, founder of the AWF]]
The African Wildlife Leadership Foundation (AWLF) was founded in 1961 by [[Russell E. Train]], a wealthy judge and hunter, and member of the Washington Safari Club.{{sfn|Russell E. Train}}
Other founding members from the Safari Club were [[Nick Arundel]], a former United States Marine Corps combat officer and journalist, [[Kermit Roosevelt, Jr.]] of the CIA, James S. Bugg, a business man and [[Maurice Stans]], later to be [[Richard Nixon]]'s finance chairman.{{sfn|Virginia Assembly...}}{{sfn|Train|2003|p=44}}{{sfn|Harrison|2009}}{{sfn|Bonner|1993|pp=56-57}}

Train was worried that European park managers would be replaced by unqualified Africans in conservation work as African countries gained their independence. Twenty African countries became independent in 1960 and 1961.
Train wrote "In Tanganyika alone, the government recently ordered 100 percent Africanization of the game service by 1966! ... Replacement of European staff by untrained, unqualified men spells disaster for the game".
He felt that it was urgent to train Africans to become wildlife professionals.{{sfn|Bonner|1993|pp=57}}

The first major grant of the AWLF was $47,000 to help found the [[College of African Wildlife Management]] at Mweka, [[Tanzania]] in 1963.{{sfn|Bonner|1993|pp=58}}
The college was organized by [[Bruce Kinloch]], Chief Game Warden of Tanganyika, as a pioneer institution for the training of African wildlife managers.{{sfn|Eyeball to eyeball...}}
Funding for Mweka was also provided by the [[U.S. Agency for International Development]], and the [[Frankfurt Zoological Society]], with facilities donated by the government of [[Tanganyika]].
By 2010 the college had trained over 4,500 wildlife managers from 28 African countries and 18 non-African countries.{{sfn|Last Stand...}}

In 1963 AWLF started a scholarship program to bring young Africans to American universities where they could study biology and wildlife management. The AWLF built a conservation education center in the same year, situated at the entrance to the [[Nairobi National Park]]. In 1967 the AWLF provided $50,000 to finance construction of a Research Institute in Tanzania. In 1970 the AWF established a school for wildlife management in [[Garoua]], Cameroon, giving instruction in French.
During the 1970s and 1980s the AWLF continued to finance students, and also assisted conservation projects, often giving supplies such as tents, vehicle spare parts, water pumps and photographic equipment rather than cash.{{sfn|Conserving Wildlife - 14 years}}

In 1969 the AWLF took the lead in a campaign supported by other conservation groups to protect rhinos. In 1974 the foundation began a program to study cheetahs.{{sfn|Conserving Wildlife - 14 years}}
In 1983 the AWF dropped "Leadership" from its name. Train was disappointed with the change, considering that the organization had lost sight of its original mandate. Instead, it had become just another conservation organization, giving funding to westerners to conduct research on animals.
However, research such as [[Dian Fossey]]'s work on gorillas and [[Cynthia Moss]]'s work on elephants, both supported by the AWF, was clearly useful.{{sfn|Bonner|1993|pp=59}}

The foundation struggled to raise money.
In 1968 the annual budget was less than US$250,000.{{sfn|Conserving Wildlife - 14 years}}
In 1988, the year in which the AWF launched a campaign against elephant poaching, the foundation had a staff of six and an annual budget of just $2 million.
When the AWF turned 30 in 1991, the board of trustees continued to be dominated by prominent and wealthy Americans, many of whom served on other non-profit boards.{{sfn|Bonner|1993|pp=60}}

==Recent thrusts==

In more recent years the AWF has modelled its program around three objectives: empowering people, conserving wildlife and protecting land. Empowering people involves conservation enterprises that provide benefits and incentives to local communities, sponsoring training of African conservationists and working with government to define conservation policy.{{sfn|Empowering People}}
Conserving wildlife involves research into species and into how these species interact with people, the basis for defining programs from which both humans and animals can benefit.{{sfn|Conserving Wildlife}}

The main thrust, however, is on protecting land, ensuring that large open landscapes are available for wildlife.
This involves supporting existing protected areas, creating private land trusts and working with local community groups on protecting special sites. Starting in 1998, land protection efforts focused on landscape-level conservation approaches. {{sfn|Protecting Land}}

The foundation had income of US$19,333,998 in the fiscal year ended 30 June 2009. Of this, $8,582,555 came from public sector support, $5,815,839 from corporate and foundation support, $5,224,931 from gifts from individuals and $1,360,424 from legacy gifts.
$17,395,456 was spent on programs, $1,524,764 on fund raising and $1,262,056 in administration.
Program funding broke down as $14,174,224 on conservation programs, $2,392,989 on public education and $828,243 on membership programs.{{sfn|BBB Wise Giving...}}

==Priority landscapes==

AWF used to call the landscapes that it supports "heartlands"; now, the organization employs a "priority landscape" approach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.awf.org/where-we-work&lt;/ref&gt;
Heartlands include:{{sfn|The African Heartlands}}

==Priority Landscapes==
Priority Landscapes include:

===Bili Uele===
The Bili-Uele Protected Area Complex is found in the remote north of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], along the border of the Central African Republic. The region consists of savanna mosaic north of the Uele River and lowland primary forest to the south. Both regions support exceptional biodiversity, including forest elephants, lions, as well as the last remaining undisturbed population of the eastern chimpanzee. An estimated 35,000–65,000 eastern chimpanzees are found in this complex. However, very little is known about the Bili-Uele area, and few organizations are working there.

===Congo===
[[File:Pan paniscus11.jpg|thumb|250px|Group of [[bonobo]]s]]
The [[Maringa-Lopori-Wamba Landscape]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] one of the least developed and most remote parts of the Congo Basin.
The inhabitants are among the poorest in Africa, depending on natural resources to meet their basic needs.{{sfn|Dupain et al. 2008|p=329}}
Most of the people live by [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture, and rely on bushmeat such as porcupine, sitatunga, and forest hog for protein.{{sfn|Dupain et al. 2008|p=331}}
Cash crops include maize, cassave and groundnuts.{{sfn|Dupain et al. 2008|p=332}}
The growing population is placing more stress on the environment, and there is risk of a revival of logging that could harm the ability of the land to sustain the people and could jeopardize both biodiversity.{{sfn|Dupain et al. 2008|p=329}}

Since 1973 a Japanese team has been researching the [[bonobo]] population near the village of [[Wamba, Luo Reserve|Wamba]] in 1973.
However, research was discontinued after political disorders started in 1991 followed by civil war in 1997, resuming only in the mid-2000s.{{sfn|Kimura|2009|pp=209-225}}
The [[IUCN Red List]] classifies bonobos as an [[endangered species]] with conservative population estimates ranging from 29,500 to 50,000 individuals.{{sfn|Pan paniscus: IUCN}}
The AWF has led efforts by local and international groups to develop a sustainable land use plan for the MLW Landscape.
The plan aims to ensure that the economic and cultural needs of the inhabitants are met while conserving the environment.
The approach combines AWF's Landscape Conservation Process and the [[Central African Regional Program for the Environment]] (CARPE) Program Monitoring Plan.
A variety of tools are used including surveys, interviews with local people and satellite image interpretation.{{sfn|Dupain et al. 2008}}

===Etosha-Skeleton Coast===
The Etosha-Skeleton Coast landscape, in the northern part of [[Namibia]], is home to Etosha National Park and its vast salt pan, woodland, and savanna ecosystems. The landscape is home to a diverse range of wildlife, from the black-faced impala to the desert-dwelling oryx to more commonly known animals such as the elephant, wild dog, lion, and cheetah. Possibly, most importantly, to the west of the park lies the Skeleton Coast, where herds of elephants roam. African Wildlife Foundation is scaling up social venture capital investments through its subsidiary, African Wildlife Capital (AWC), which invests in socially and environmentally responsible businesses, such as the Grootberg Lodge in the Khoadi-Hoas community conservancy. These businesses must comply with conservation covenants, ensuring that they are sustainable and improving livelihoods for people and habitats for wildlife.

===Faro===
At the core of the Faro landscape in northern Cameroon is Faro National Park, located close to the Nigerian border. Not only does this park host the largest population of hippos in Cameroon, it is also home to elephants, black rhinos, cheetahs, hyenas, and other wildlife. AWF is lending support to counter-poaching park rangers in Faro and building a contingent of community scouts on the park's borders to provide a needed buffer between outsiders and the park.

===Great Fish River===
The Great Fish River Nature Reserve is located in [[South Africa]]'s Eastern Cape province. The 45,000-hectare reserve, which lies in the Great Fish River valley, is home to an important and increasingly vulnerable population of critically endangered black rhino.

===Kazungula===

[[Image:Zambezi River at junction of Namibia, Zambia, Zimbabwe &amp;amp; Botswana.jpg|thumb|250px|Aerial photo of Kazungula (centre right) on the Zambezi River]]
[[Image:White rhino Livingstone.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The two white rhinos at Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park in May 2005]]
The floodplains of the Zambezi River are surrounded by a mosaic of miombo and mopane woodlands and grasslands that include important wildlife migration corridors.{{sfn|Kazungula Landscape}}
The [[Victoria Falls]], the largest in the world, are between [[Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park]] in Zambia and [[Victoria Falls National Park]] in Zimbabwe.
The Falls and surrounding area are designated a [[World Heritage Site]].
However, the environment is threatened by growing and haphazard development of tourism, and lack of funding to the park authorities.{{sfn|Mosi-Oa-Tunya}}

The AWF has established the {{convert|160000|acre|ha}} Sekute Conservation Area in this region in partnership with the Sekute Chiefdom, holding two elephant corridors.{{sfn|Kazungula Landscape}}
AWF helped wildlife authorities settle four new white rhinos in [[Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park]] in Zambia, joining the last surviving white rhino in the country, a bull.
On 17 January 2011 it was reported that two of the female [[white rhino]]s had given birth to calves, which seemed healthy.{{sfn|Exciting News...}}
The area is also home to endangered [[black rhino]]s.{{sfn|Kazungula Landscape}}
In 2011 a cluster of modern new buildings for the Lupani community school were opened in Kazungula, built by the AWF at a cost of US$250,000.
The new school has six classrooms, offices and five teachers' houses with three bedrooms each.{{sfn|Lombe|2011}}

===Kilimanjaro===

[[Image:Elephants Kili 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Elephants grazing in Amboseli swamps, north of [[Kilimanjaro]]]]
[[Disney]] released the movie ''African Cats'' in April 2011. The Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund gave AWF a portion of the proceeds from the first week's ticket sales for use in protecting the Amboseli Wildlife Corridor. Their "See 'African Cats,' Save the Savanna" program served both to promote the movie and to raise money for conservation.{{sfn|Disney's African Cats}}

===Limpopo===
[[File:Buffalo bend.jpg|thumb|250px|Buffalo Bend on the [[Mwenezi River]], [[Gonarezhou National Park]], [[Zimbabwe]]]]
The Limpopo Landscape includes areas of [[Mozambique]], [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]].
It includes savanna, woodland, rivers and floodplains.
Fauna include sable antelope, rhinos, hippos, and many species of birds, insects and aquatic life.{{sfn|Limpopo Landscape}}
The AWF has started the Leopard Conservation Science Project in this landscape .{{sfn|Revealing the Leopard}}
The AWF is particularly involved in the [[Banhine National Park]] in Mozambique, which covers {{convert|7000|km2|sqmi}}.
Until recently this park had little or no infrastructure or staff to ensure that the environment was protected.
The AWF has built a conservation research center, which it is marketing to the international scientific community.
Fees from researchers will pay for staff to run the center and to manage the park.{{sfn|Strengthening Banhine}}

The [[Great Limpopo Transfrontier Park]] (GLTP) is a {{convert|35000|km2|sqmi}} park that is being established to connect the [[Kruger National Park]] in South Africa, the [[Limpopo National Park]] in Mozambique, the [[Gonarezhou National Park]] in Zimbabwe and other protected areas.
It is almost the size of the [[Netherlands]] and more than three times larger than the [[Yellowstone National Park]].
The GLTP is home to many of the species most popular with tourists, including lion, white and black rhinoceros, giraffe, elephant, hippopotamus and buffalo.
The AWF says the megapark will result in "creating new jobs and fortifying a tourism base not yet meeting its full potential".{{sfn|Great Limpopo Transfrontier}}
The AWF is a major sponsor of the project that is setting up this park.{{sfn|Seven Elephants...}}

===Maasai Steppe===

The {{convert|35000|acre|ha}} Manyara Ranch Conservancy is near to [[Lake Manyara]] in [[Tanzania]].
This is a pioneering conservation and tourism project supported by the African Wildlife Foundation, the Tanzania Land Conservation Trust and the Manyara Ranch Conservancy. While not a park, the conservancy is frequented by resident and migrating wildlife including elephant, lion, buffalo, leopard and the more common plains game. Rarely seen in the parks but a common resident on the Conservancy is the lesser kudu.{{sfn|Making Conservation Our Business}}

===Mau Forest Complex===
Within Kenya's Rift Valley, sits the [[Mau Forest]] Complex. It is the largest indigenous montane forest in East Africa and serves as a critical water catchment area for the country, providing a source of water for many of [[Kenya]]'s wildlife and people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.awf.org/landscape/mau-forest-complex&lt;/ref&gt; African Wildlife Foundation, together with the Kenya Forest Service, the Community Forest Association, and other stakeholders, is reforesting areas of the Mau Forest with indigenous trees.

===Parc W===

[[File:Girafeskoure.jpg|thumb|250px|[[West African giraffe]]s near [[Kouré, Niger]]]]
This {{convert|1823280|ha|sqmi}} region is located around the point where [[Niger]], [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Benin]] meet.
It consists of three national protected parks that form a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], the trans-national [[W National Park]], as well as several adjacent reserves and buffer zones.
The complex includes savanna woodlands, gallery forests and flooded plains where the [[Mekrou River|Mekrou]] and [[Niger River|Niver]] rivers meet.
It is home to large and diverse wildlife populations including the largest population of elephants in the region and the only remaining [[West African giraffe]]s.{{sfn|Parc W Landscape}}
Mitochondrial and nuclear DNA research shows that this is a distinct and genetically healthy subspecies that diverged from the [[Rothschild's giraffe]] about 350,000 years ago.{{sfn|World's rarest giraffe}}

In Parc W, AWF and other International NGOs such as the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]], [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Africa '70 (NGO)|Africa 70]] play a central role in communication, education and organization of local communities and their leaders, and help collect socio-economic and technical data.{{sfn|Strategie Nationale}}
AWF is helping fund tree nurseries in Niger and Burkino Faso for replantings to provide fodder for the giraffes.{{sfn|Parc W Landscape}} Conservation threats are human population growth and desertification. AWF partners in the region include the [[Association pour la Sauvegarde des Girafes du Niger]], [[Centre National de Gestion des Réserves de Faune]] (CENAGREF), Benin and the Ministries of the Environment in Burkina Faso and Niger.{{sfn|Parc W Landscape}}

===Ruaha===

The Ruaha area will intersect with an agriculture corridor that the Tanzanian government wants to develop in southern [[Tanzania]]. The proposed corridor will overlap many different ecosystems, possibly undermining their ecological integrity and impacting wildlife areas. AWF is scaling up social venture capital investments through its subsidiary, African Wildlife Capital (AWC), which invests in socially and environmentally responsible agricultural and other businesses—such as the Rungwe Avocado Co.—that must comply with conservation covenants to secure and maintain investment. These AWC-invested businesses not only aim to benefit wildlife, but also benefit small-farm holders.

===Samburu===
[[File:Samburu Grevy's zebra.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Grevy's zebras in [[Samburu National Reserve]].]]

The national parks, private ranches, and communal lands of the [http://www.awf.org/landscape/samburu Samburu Landscape] support some of Africa's most impressive wildlife. The [http://www.awf.org/wildlife-conservation/grevys-zebra Grevy's zebra] and reticulated giraffe, species that are found only north of the Equator in Africa, roam in the Samburu Landscape among the acacia grasslands. The unique conservation challenges faced in Samburu are forest/habitat degradation due to logging and farming and cattle-carnivore conflict.

AWF has implemented solutions to address these challenges, including partnering with Starbucks Coffee Trading Co. to train coffee growers in sustainable and more productive practices, providing wildlife scouts with monitoring technology, and [http://www.awf.org/projects/ewaso-lions working with Samburu warriors] to protect endangered predators.

===Virunga===

[[File:Virunga Mountain Gorilla 1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Mountain gorilla]]s in [[Virunga National Park]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]]]
The [[Virunga Mountains|Virunga]] landscape is an area of volcanic highlands around the point where [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] meet, Virunga is home to the last 700 [[mountain gorilla]]s in the world.
It includes the [[Mgahinga Gorilla National Park]] in Uganda, where AWF opened a visitor center in July 2006.
The Virunga ecosystem is highly diverse, and also shelters chimpanzees, golden monkeys, forest elephants, and many species of birds, reptiles and amphibians.
The region is overpopulated, intensely poor and politically unstable, placing severe threats on the environment.{{sfn|Virunga Landscape}}

The AWF helped [[Dian Fossey]] study Rwandan mountain gorillas in the 1960s.
AWF President [[Robinson McIlvaine]] later said that "There would be no mountain gorillas in the Virungas today ... were it not for Dian Fossey's tireless efforts over many years".{{sfn|Celebrating AWF's 40th}}
McIlvaine initiated formation of a consortium to protect the threatened Rwandan mountain gorillas while he was president of the AWF between 1978 and 1982.{{sfn|Robinson McIlvaine}}
More recently, the AWF coordinated fundraising and construction of a lodge overlooking the [[Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National Park]], home of about half the worlds population of mountain gorillas.{{sfn|Clouds Mountain Gorilla Lodge}}

According to [[Farley Mowat]] in his book ''[[Woman in the Mists]]'', in the late 1970s Fossey asked McIlvaine to temporarily serve as secretary-treasurer of the [[Digit Fund]] while he was AWF President.
She had created the fund to finance patrols against poachers seeking to kill mountain gorillas. McIlvaine partnered with the [[International Primate Protection League]], the Digit Fund, and his own AWF asking for funds, to be made out to the AWF.
The Digit Fund received none of the money. When McIlvaine suggested to Fossey that the Digit Fund could be folded into AWF, Fossey declined and McIlvaine resigned as secretary-treasurer of the fund.{{sfn|Mowat|1987|pp=202-203}}

The AWF is a co-sponsor of the [[International Gorilla Conservation Program]] (IGCP) in Virunga, the others being [[Fauna &amp; Flora International]] (FFI) and the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF). Among other activities, the IGCP works with Virunga Artisans, which markets handmade products of artisans who live near the [[Volcanoes National Park|Volcanoes]], Mgahinga and Bwindi National Parks.{{sfn|About Virunga Artisans}}
A census of mountain gorillas in the Virunga Massif in March and April 2010 showed that there had been a 26.3% increase in the population over the past seven years, an encouraging sign that conservation efforts were succeeding.{{sfn|Masozera|2010}}

===Save Valley===

The [http://www.awf.org/landscape/save-valley Save Valley landscape] was once dominated by a large livestock operation that pushed out native wildlife and degraded much of the ecosystem. During recent decades, cattle fences and livestock have been removed, and the landscape has seen a resurgence of wildlife and a recovery of the wild habitats.

The Save Valley Conservancy, in Zimbabwe's southern lowveld area forms part of the Greater Limpopo Transfrontier Park. Here, lions, buffalo, leopard, elephant, and other game, including black and white rhinos, find their home. AWF supports Save Valley Conservancy's anti-poaching efforts and works with government partners to ensure the protection of Save's wildlife, namely its rhino populations.

Like other publications of the Academy, such as the ''[[Diccionario de la lengua española de la Real Academia Española]]'', the work follows a [[Linguistic prescription|linguistically prescriptive]] philosophy as opposed to a [[Linguistic description|descriptive]] one.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnin, Juan Eduardo.

Tilburg University, Oct. 2012, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition was published in 2005 and is now being revised to more properly align with principles set forth by the Academy's other publications.

The project was begun in response to the 50,000 questions received yearly by the constituent members of the Association of Spanish Language Academies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumer.es/web/es/educacion/2004/10/14/110278.php |title="Las 22 Academias de la Lengua Española aprueban el Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas", EROSKI CONSUMER, 14 Oct. 2004 |publisher=Consumer.es |date=2004-10-14 |accessdate=2013-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Diplomatic Documents of Switzerland''' ('''Dodis''') is a research project which edits important documents on [[Foreign relations of Switzerland|Swiss foreign relations]] and [[contemporary history]]. The project includes a book series in several volumes and the online database Dodis.

== Aim ==
In contrast to other editions on [[foreign policy]], Dodis is not a state-run project, but the product of academic [[research]]. The research group chooses the documents to be published according to independently defined criteria and is only bound to scientific principles. Through their choice of published documents, the researchers aim to show the main features of the [[international relations]] of [[Switzerland]] while maintaining its diversity. The  [[basic research]] done by Dodis provides [[historian]]s with [[primary source]]s allowing them to work on specific aspects of Swiss foreign policy or to contextualise more complex developments.

== Organisation ==
Diplomatic Documents of Switzerland is an enterprise of the [[Swiss Academy of Arts and Sciences|Swiss Academy for Humanities and Social Sciences (SAGW)]] and works under the auspices of the [[Swiss Society for History|Swiss Society for History (SSH)]]. The funding and the administration of the project were taken over by the academy in January 2000 from the [[Swiss National Science Foundation|Swiss National Science Foundation (SNF)]], which had until then been the major financial contributor to Dodis. Furthermore, the project is supported by the [[Federal Archives of Switzerland|Swiss Federal Archives (SFA)]], where the Research Centre is located and by the [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs|Federal Department of Foreign Affairs (FDFA)]]. The research centre of Diplomatic Documents of Switzerland is managed by a director. The director is accountable to the Dodis-Committee, which consists of representatives of the contributing organisations and of professors from all of the History departments in Switzerland.

== History ==
In 1972 a group of historians took the initiative to publish documents for the study of Swiss foreign policy and of the international relations of Switzerland. Fifteen volumes covering the period from 1848 until 1945 were subsequently published between 1979 and 1997. Each volume was published by a different team of researchers based at a Swiss university. The project was restructured in the mid 1990s: in the course of planning the second series of the Dodis and an online-database, the various and changing research teams were replaced by a permanent research centre with assigned staff. The work on the second series of the Dodis, covering the period from 1945 until 1989, started in 1997 and at the same time, the database dodis.ch went online.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.dodis.ch/en/profile&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==
=== Online database (dodis.ch) ===
Dodis.ch is an integrative and freely accessible internet database of Diplomatic Documents of Switzerland (Dodis). It contains thousands of documentes, primarily sourced from the Swiss Federal Archives, which are all related to Swiss foreign relations. The database also links meta-data regarding persons and organisations important to international and Swiss history. Sources can thus be critically contextualised and research can be extended to other Dodis documents as well as the relevant archival holdings. The [[relational database]] works in addition to the printed volumes and aims to illustrate in more detail the various aspects of Swiss international relations. The thousands of documents on dodis.ch are, contrary to those in the volumes, not annotated, but indexed and tagged according to scientific criteria. The documents on dodis.ch are scans and can be downloaded in pdf format.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Books ===
The book series in several volumes aims to illustrate the main features and the guidelines of the international relations of Switzerland. The documents printed in the volumes, therefore, primarily either show the general orientation of Swiss foreign relations or indicate what at a certain time strongly influenced this orientation. 
From 1979 until 1997 the first series was published in fifteen volumes covering the period from 1848 until 1945. These volumes were later digitalised and can be accessed on the Swiss Federal Archives' search engine '''publications officielles numérisées''', which uses [[full text search]]. The second series covering the period from 1945 until 1989 is to be completed by 2020 and is planned to be published in fifteen volumes, as well. The most recent Volume (Vol. 26 1973-75) was published 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dodis.ch/en/press-releases/swiss-foreign-policy-1973-1975-new-volume-out-now|title=Swiss Foreign Policy, 1973–1975: New Volume Out Now! {{!}} dodis.ch|website=www.dodis.ch|language=en|access-date=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ICGV ''Ægir''''' is an [[OPV (naval)|Offshore Patrol vessel]] of the [[Icelandic Coast Guard]] built by Aalborg Værft, in [[Denmark]]. She is the first ship of the [[Ægir-class offshore patrol vessel|''Ægir'' class]] and is the sistership of the slightly improved [[ICGV Týr|ICGV ''Týr'']]. 
She participated in the two last [[Cod Wars]].

In 1990 the original [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss|57mm cannon]] was replaced with the current [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors 40 mm gun]] and a large crane was added in 1994. The flight deck was enlarged in 1997 and in 2005 she was refitted in [[Poland]] with a new bridge and improved electronics suite.

== Historical ships ==
The first ship in the Icelandic Coast Guard to bear the name ''Ægir'' was commissioned on 14 July 1929. In her early years she was considered the most advanced patrol and inspection ship of the [[Nordic countries]]. She participated in the First [[Cod War]]. ''Ægir'' sailed with the newly elected president (1944) [[Sveinn Björnsson]] in the 1940s around Iceland. Full armament during the [[Second World War]] consisted of a [[QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss|57mm cannon]], 37mm [[anti-aircraft gun]], two [[machine gun]]s and [[depth charges]] along with various [[small arms]]. When the new ''Ægir'' arrived she was decommissioned and sold for scrap, even though she was still in excellent condition.

The '''Imgu Pung clan''' ({{Korean|임구 풍씨|臨朐 馮氏}}) is a [[Korean clans|Korean clan]] ([[Bon-gwan]]). The clan was located in [[Linqu County]], [[Weifang]], [[Shandong]], [[China]]. 

According to research carried out in 2015, the Imgu Pung clan had 592 members. The clan was founded by Pung Sam sa who belonged to the Linqu people of the [[Ming dynasty]]. When the Ming dynasty was replaced by the [[Qing dynasty]], Pung Sam sa was captured and detained in [[Shenyang]]. He was captured following his rebellion against the Qing dynasty, hoping to reinstate the Ming dynasty. Following his incarceration, he moved and was [[naturalized]] in [[Joseon]] with [[Hyojong of Joseon]], who became a hostage during [[Qing invasion of Joseon]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=|date=|title=Doosan Encyclopedia 풍 馮|publisher=[[Doosan Encyclopedia]]|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1159079&amp;cid=40942&amp;categoryId=31639&amp;mobile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="906">'''Kebakko''' is a type of ready-meal in [[Finland]]. Kebakkos are very similar to meatballs in Finland. It consists of [[meat]], [[breadcrumbs]], [[onions]], [[egg (food)|eggs]] and [[spices]]. The difference is mostly in shape, instead of a ball, kebakko is about 12 cm piece of meat on a wooden stick, and is usually sold in packs of four to twelve. The name comes from the [[Turkey|Turkish]] food [[kebab]], and the [[Finnish language|Finnish]] word ''kepakko'', meaning "small stick".

Kebakko represents [[fusion cuisine]]. It combines the Turkish [[kebab]] with traditional Finnish [[meatloaf]]. The usual way to serve kebakkos is to heat them and serve with various [[sauce]]s for dipping; the stick enables the kebakkos to be dipped and eaten by hand.

'''Kopačka''' ({{lang-mk|Копачка}}; {{lang-en|The farmers dance}}) is a traditional [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian]] [[Hora (dance)|''Oro'']], folk dance, from the region of Pijanec, a range of mountains in the eastern part of the [[Republic of Macedonia]].

Kopačka is traditionally performed by male dancers. It is a fast-paced dance with fast movements on half feet, featuring extensive jumping, side movements and scissors movements. The dancers hold their belts with their left hand over the right one and begin their dance in a position of a half circle. The dance rhythm is {{music|time|2|4}}.

The dance was first introduced to [[Tanec]] (the national folklore performance group in the [[Republic of Macedonia]]) by the village dancers. The original name for the dance was Sitnata (Macedonian: Ситната; English: ''The small/fine one''). Tanec changed the name to Kopačka and the dance subsequently became so famous that the villagers adopted this name of Kopačka for both the dance and the name of their group, to remind everyone whence this dance originally came.

The dance is based on a combination of two songs: ''Dimna Juda'' for the slow, walking part of the dance, and ''Derviško Dušo (Viško)'' for the fast part of the dance.

'''''Les Accords de Bella''''' is a 2007 anthropological documentary film directed by [[David Constantin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festivalfilmafriqueiles.fr/en/les-films/9.php|title=Les Accords de Bella|publisher=Festival Film Afriqueiles|accessdate=9 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120802194131/http://www.festivalfilmafriqueiles.fr/en/les-films/9.php|archivedate=2 August 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was selected by the [[African Film Festival of Cordoba - FCAT]].

== Synopsis ==
[[Rodrigues Island]], lost in the middle of the [[Indian Ocean]], has something particular: There are more than 500 accordions for 35,000 people. Polkas, mazurkas and waltzes are part of the history and mestization of an island forgotten by all for a very long time. Here, the accordion is not a forgotten instrument, quite the contrary; its sound mixes with African drums so that young and old can dance. With Philippe Imbert's help, a French craftsman, the Rodrigues Accordion Association has set out on a new adventure: Making their own accordion. The first one, the prototype, completely made on the island, is called Bella.&lt;ref name="Express"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lexpress.mu/services/archive-90183-david-constantin--bella--au-bois-dormant.html | title=David Constantin, "Bella" au bois dormant | work=[[L'Express (France)]] | date=16 July 2007 | accessdate=March 10, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130219031304/http://www.lexpress.mu/services/archive-90183-david-constantin--bella--au-bois-dormant.html | archivedate=19 February 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mauricien&gt;{{cite news|title=Les accords de Bella|url=http://www.lemauricien.org/weekend/070715/mg.htm#4|accessdate=11 March 2012|newspaper=[[Le Mauricien]]|date=15 July 2007|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Madonna Louise Ciccone''' ({{IPAc-en|tʃ|ɪ|ˈ|k|oʊ|n|i}}; born August 16, 1958) is an American singer-songwriter, actress and businesswoman.&lt;!--Only the most notable occupations associated with her, other less notable occupations should be listed in the infobox. --&gt; Referred to as the "[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Queen of Pop]]" since the 1980s, Madonna is known for pushing the boundaries of songwriting in mainstream popular music, as well as imagery in music videos and on stage. She has also frequently reinvented both her music and image while maintaining autonomy within the recording industry. Besides sparking controversy, her works have been praised by [[Music criticism|music critics]]. Madonna is often cited as an influence by [[List of artists influenced by Madonna|other artists]].

Born and raised in [[Michigan]], Madonna moved to [[New York City]] in 1978 to pursue a career in modern dance. After performing as a drummer, guitarist, and vocalist in the rock bands [[Breakfast Club (band)|Breakfast Club]] and Emmy, Madonna signed with [[Sire Records]] in 1982 and released her [[Madonna (Madonna album)|eponymous debut album]] the next year. She followed it with a series of successful albums, including the [[List of best-selling albums|global bestsellers]] ''[[Like a Virgin (album)|Like a Virgin]]'' (1984) and ''[[True Blue (Madonna album)|True Blue]]'' (1986), as well as the [[Grammy Award]] winners ''[[Ray of Light]]'' (1998) and ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' (2005). Throughout her career, Madonna has written and produced most of [[List of songs recorded by Madonna|her songs]], with many of them reaching number one on the record charts, including "[[Like a Virgin (song)|Like a Virgin]]", "[[La Isla Bonita]]", "[[Like a Prayer (song)|Like a Prayer]]", "[[Vogue (Madonna song)|Vogue]]", "[[Take a Bow (Madonna song)|Take a Bow]]", "[[Frozen (Madonna song)|Frozen]]", "[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]", "[[Hung Up]]", and "[[4 Minutes]]".

Madonna's popularity was further enhanced by her roles in films such as ''[[Desperately Seeking Susan]]'' (1985), ''[[Dick Tracy (1990 film)|Dick Tracy]]'' (1990), ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' (1992), and ''[[Evita (1996 film)|Evita]]'' (1996). While the latter earned her a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Motion Picture Comedy or Musical|Best Actress]], many of her other films received poor reviews. As a  businesswoman, Madonna founded her own entertainment company [[Maverick (company)|Maverick]], including the label Maverick Records, in 1992. Her other ventures include [[Madonna fashion brands|fashion design]], writing [[Madonna bibliography|children's books]], opening of health clubs, and filmmaking. She contributed in various charities and founded Ray of Light Foundation in 1998 and [[Raising Malawi]] in 2006.

Having sold more than 300 million records worldwide&lt;!--Do NOT change without consensus on talk page--&gt;, Madonna is noted as the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling female recording artist of all time]] by ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. The [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA) listed her as [[List of highest-certified music artists in the United States|the second highest-certified female artist in the U.S.]], with 64.5 million&amp;nbsp;[[RIAA certification|album units]]. According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', Madonna is the most successful solo artist in its [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] chart history. She is also the [[List of highest-grossing concert tours|highest-grossing solo touring artist of all time]], accumulating U.S. $1.4&amp;nbsp;billion from her concert tickets. Inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] in her first year of eligibility, Madonna topped [[VH1]]'s countdown of [[The Greatest (TV series)|100 Greatest Women in Music]]. Additionally, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' listed her among the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time|100 Greatest Artists of All Time]] and the [[Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time|100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time]].

==Life and career==

===1958–1981: Early life and career beginnings===
Madonna was born to Catholic parents Madonna Louise (''née'' Fortin) and Silvio Anthony "Tony" Ciccone&lt;ref name="mom"/&gt; in [[Bay City, Michigan]] on August 16, 1958.&lt;ref name=allmusicbio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/madonna-mn0000237205/biography|title=Madonna Biography|first=Stephen Thomas|last=Erlewine|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=April 13, 2015|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father's parents were Italian emigrants from [[Pacentro]], while her mother was of French-Canadian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony worked as an engineer designer for [[Chrysler]] and [[General Motors]]. Since Madonna had the same name as her mother, family members called her "Little Nonni". She has two elder brothers, Anthony and Martin, and three younger siblings, Paula, Christopher, and Melanie.&lt;ref name="thechild"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1400097/The-child-who-became-a-star.html|title=The Child Who Became a Star: Madonna Timeline|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=July 26, 2006|accessdate=June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon being [[Confirmation (Catholic Church)|confirmed]] in the [[Catholic Church]] in 1966, she adopted [[Saint Veronica|Veronica]] as a [[confirmation name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in the Detroit suburbs of [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] and Avon Township (now [[Rochester Hills, Michigan|Rochester Hills]]). Months before her mother died of [[breast cancer]] at age 30 on December 1, 1963, Madonna noticed changes in her behavior and personality, although she did not understand the reason.&lt;ref name="mom"/&gt; Her mother was at a loss to explain her medical condition, and often began to cry when Madonna questioned her about it. Madonna later acknowledged that she had not grasped the concept of her mother dying.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna turned to her paternal grandmother for solace. The Ciccone siblings resented housekeepers and rebelled against anyone brought into their home who they thought would try to take the place of their beloved mother. Madonna later told ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' that she saw herself in her youth as a "lonely girl who was searching for something. I wasn't rebellious in a certain way. I cared about being good at something. I didn't shave my underarms and I didn't wear make-up like normal girls do. But I studied and I got good grades.... I wanted to be somebody." Terrified that her father Tony could be taken from her as well, Madonna was often unable to sleep unless she was near him.&lt;ref name="mom"/&gt;

[[File:Madonna family in their vineyard cropped.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Madonna's stepmother and father, Joan and Tony Ciccone (2009)]]
In 1966, Tony married the family's housekeeper Joan Gustafson. They had two children, Jennifer and Mario.&lt;ref name="thechild"/&gt; Madonna resented her father for getting remarried, and began rebelling against him, which strained their relationship for many years afterward.&lt;ref name="mom"/&gt; She attended St. Frederick's and St. Andrew's Catholic Elementary Schools, and West Middle School. Madonna was known for her high [[Grade (education)|grade point average]], and achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior. She would perform cartwheels and handstands in the hallways between classes, dangle by her knees from the [[jungle gym|monkey bars]] during recess, and pull up her skirt during class—all so that the boys could see her underwear.&lt;ref name="tarabio"&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna's father put her in classical [[piano]] lessons, but she later convinced him to allow her to take [[ballet]] lessons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Flynn, her ballet teacher, persuaded her to pursue a career in dance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|pp=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later attended [[Rochester Adams High School]] where she became a straight-A student and a member of the cheerleading squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Claro|1994|pp=24, 27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, she received a dance scholarship to the [[University of Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tilden|first=Imogen|title=Madonna|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=July 4, 2001|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2001/jul/04/netnotes.imogentilden|accessdate=May 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, Madonna dropped out of college and relocated to New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=A Star with Staying Power|url=http://edition.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/madonna/profile.html|year=2004|accessdate=April 22, 2015|series=People in the News|network=[[CNN]]|credits=Hosted by Paula Zahn}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had little money while working as a waitress at [[Dunkin' Donuts]] and with [[modern dance]] troupes, taking classes at the [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater]] and eventually performing with [[Pearl Lang|Pear Lang Dance Theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EkNwz83JvvkC&amp;pg=PA42|title=Madonna Rising|last=Anderson|first=Christopher|date=October 14, 1991|work=New York|accessdate=December 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charlotteobserver.com/entertainment/music-news-reviews/article23418204.html|title=Madonna before she was Madonna – dancing at American Dance Festival|work=[[The Charlotte Observer]]|accessdate=December 14, 2015|date=June 7, 2015|last=Menconi|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Madonna: Queen of Pop|series=Biography|network=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]|minutes=5|credits=Hosted by Jim Wallasky}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna said of her move to New York, "It was the first time I'd ever taken a plane, the first time I'd ever gotten a taxi cab. I came here with $35 in my pocket. It was the bravest thing I'd ever done."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rettenmund|1995|p=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; She started to work as a backup dancer for other established artists. Madonna claimed that one night, while returning from a rehearsal, a pair of men held her at knifepoint and forced her to perform [[fellatio]]. She later found the incident to be "a taste of my weakness, it showed me that I still could not save myself in spite of all the strong-girl show. I could never forget it."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While performing as a backup singer and dancer for the French disco artist [[Patrick Hernandez]] on his 1979 world tour, Madonna became romantically involved with musician Dan Gilroy&lt;ref name="tarabio"/&gt; and they lived in an abandoned synagogue in [[Corona, Queens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-life/hook-ups-break-ups/documentary-reveals-bedroom-tapes-madonna-made-with-lover/news-story/c488636c482dabb3d12ea63e688b15e1|title=Documentary reveals bedroom tapes Madonna made with lover|date=August 14, 2016|accessdate=August 15, 2016|publisher=News.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="goldmine"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Madonna – From Genesis to Revelations|first=Bruce|last=Baron|journal=[[Goldmine (magazine)|Goldmine]]|date=July 2, 1999|volume=25|issue=494|issn=1055-2685}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they formed her first rock band, the [[Breakfast Club (band)|Breakfast Club]], for which Madonna sang and played drums and guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980&lt;ref name="thechild"/&gt; or 1981&lt;ref name="Rolling Biography"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Biography – Madonna|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|year=2004|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/madonna/biography|accessdate=April 29, 2008|first=Caryn|last=Ganz}}&lt;/ref&gt; she left Breakfast Club and, with her then boyfriend [[Stephen Bray]] as drummer, formed the band Emmy. The two began writing songs together, but Madonna later decided to promote herself as a solo act.&lt;ref name="breakfastclub"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/breakfast-club-mn0000512922|title=Breakfast Club &gt; Biography|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|first=Dan|last=LeRoy|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her music impressed DJ and record producer [[Mark Kamins]] who arranged a meeting between Madonna and [[Sire Records]] founder [[Seymour Stein]].&lt;ref name="Rolling Biography"/&gt;

===1982–1985: ''Madonna'', ''Like a Virgin'', and first marriage===
After Madonna signed a [[single (music)|singles]] deal with Sire, her debut single, "[[Everybody (Madonna song)|Everybody]]", was released in October 1982, and the second, "[[Burning Up (Madonna song)|Burning Up]]", in March 1983. Both became big club hits in the United States, reaching number three on [[Hot Dance Club Songs]] chart compiled by ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Madonna, Beastie Boys Nominated For Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame|publisher=MTV|date=September 23, 2007|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1570747/20070927/beastie_boys.jhtml|accessdate=May 29, 2008|last=Orzeck|first=Kurt}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this success, she started developing her [[eponym]]ous debut album, ''[[Madonna (Madonna album)|Madonna]]'', which was primarily produced by [[Reggie Lucas]] of Warner Bros. However, she was not happy with the completed tracks and disagreed with Lucas' production techniques, so decided to seek additional help.&lt;ref name=tara1/&gt;

Madonna moved in with boyfriend [[John Benitez|John "Jellybean" Benitez]], asking his help for finishing the album's production.&lt;ref name=tara1/&gt; Benitez remixed most of the tracks and produced "[[Holiday (Madonna song)|Holiday]]", which was her third single and her first international top-ten hit. The overall sound of ''Madonna'' was dissonant and in the form of upbeat synthetic disco, using some of the new technology of the time, like the [[LinnDrum|Linn drum machine]], [[Moog Taurus|Moog bass]] and the [[synthesizer|OB-X synthesizer]].&lt;ref name=tara1&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rooksby|2004|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released in July 1983 and peaked at number eight on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] six months later, in 1984. It yielded two top-ten singles on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], "[[Borderline (Madonna song)|Borderline]]" and "[[Lucky Star (Madonna song)|Lucky Star]]".&lt;ref name="bbalbums"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=madonna-p64565/charts-awards/billboard-albums|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=February 24, 2010|title=Madonna – Charts &amp; Awards – Billboard Albums}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbsingles"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=madonna-p64565/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=February 24, 2010|title = Madonna – Charts &amp; Awards – Billboard Singles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MadonnaVirginTour cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Madonna with her crew on [[The Virgin Tour]], 1985]]

In September 1993, Madonna embarked on [[The Girlie Show World Tour]], in which she dressed as a whip-cracking [[dominatrix]] surrounded by topless dancers. In Puerto Rico she rubbed the island's flag between her legs on stage, resulting in outrage among the audience.&lt;ref name="showstealer"/&gt; In March 1994, [[Madonna on Late Show with David Letterman|she appeared as a guest]] on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', using profanity that required censorship on television, and handing Letterman a pair of her panties and asking him to smell it.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tetzlaff|1993|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The releases of her sexually explicit book, album and film, and the aggressive appearance on Letterman all made critics question Madonna as a sexual renegade. Critics and fans reacted negatively, who commented that "she had gone too far" and that her career was over.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|pp=232–235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biographer [[J. Randy Taraborrelli]] described her ballad "[[I'll Remember]]" (1994) as an attempt to tone down her provocative image. The song was recorded for [[Alek Keshishian]]'s film ''[[With Honors (film)|With Honors]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made a subdued appearance with Letterman at an awards show and appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' after realizing that she needed to change her musical direction in order to sustain her popularity.&lt;ref name="tara235"/&gt; With her sixth studio album, ''[[Bedtime Stories (Madonna album)|Bedtime Stories]]'' (1994), Madonna employed a softer image to try to improve the public perception.&lt;ref name="tara235"&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album debuted at number three on the ''Billboard'' 200 and generated two U.S. top-five hits, "[[Secret (Madonna song)|Secret]]" and "[[Take a Bow (Madonna song)|Take a Bow]]", the latter topping the Hot 100 for seven weeks, the longest period of any Madonna single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Madonna's 40 Biggest Billboard Hits|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/list/499398/madonnas-40-biggest-billboard-hits|work=Billboard|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Something to Remember]]'', a collection of ballads, was released in November 1995.

In mid-2004 Madonna embarked on the [[Re-Invention World Tour]] in the U.S., Canada, and Europe.

Her tenth studio album, ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'', was released in November 2005. Musically the album was structured like a club set composed by a DJ.

Madonna's music has been the subject of much analysis and scrutiny. [[Robert M. Grant (economist)|Robert M. Grant]], author of ''Contemporary Strategy Analysis'' (2005), commented that what has brought Madonna success is "certainly not outstanding natural talent. As a vocalist, musician, dancer, songwriter, or actress, Madonna's talents seem modest."&lt;ref name=CSA&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserts Madonna's success is in relying on the talents of others, and that her personal relationships have served as cornerstones to the numerous reinventions in the longevity of her career.&lt;ref name=CSA/&gt; The author believed that Madonna's approach was far from the music industry wisdom of "Find a winning formula and stick to it". Her musical career has been a continuous experimentation with new musical ideas and new images and a constant quest for new heights of fame and acclaim. Grant concluded that "having established herself as the queen of popular music, Madonna did not stop there, but continued re-inventing."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grant|2005|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Musicologist]] [[Susan McClary]] wrote that "Madonna's art itself repeatedly deconstructs the traditional notion of the unified subject with finite ego boundaries. Her pieces explore various ways of constituting identities that refuse stability, that remain fluid, that resist definition."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lancaster|di Leonardo|1997|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas Harrison in the book ''Pop Goes the Decade: The Eighties'', Madonna was "an artist who pushed the boundaries" of what a female singer could do, both visually and lyrically.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harrison|2017|p=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her career Madonna has been involved in writing and producing most of her own music.&lt;ref name="music credit"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/madonna-mn0000237205/credits|title=Madonna &gt; Credits|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuart Price]], one of her past collaborators, said that "You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her.

Before emerging as a pop star, Madonna spent her early years dabbling in [[rock music]] alongside her bands, Breakfast Club and Emmy.&lt;ref name="rock star"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/23298744|title=Madonna: A true blue rock star|last=Sclafani|first=Tony|date=March 7, 2008|accessdate=January 14, 2011|publisher=[[MSNBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; While performing with Emmy, Madonna recorded about 12–14 songs which resemble the [[punk rock]] of that period.&lt;ref name="goldmine"/&gt; Her early rock roots also can be found on the demo album ''[[Pre-Madonna]]''.&lt;ref name="rock star"/&gt; [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] noted that with her self-titled debut album, Madonna began her career as a [[disco]] diva, in an era that did not have any such divas to speak of. In the beginning of the 1980s, disco was an anathema to the mainstream pop, and according to Erlewine, Madonna had a huge role in popularizing [[dance music]] as mainstream music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/madonna-mw0000268192|title=Madonna – Madonna &gt; Overview|publisher=AllMusic|accessdate=March 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's songs reveal several key trends that have continued to define her success, including a strong dance-based idiom, catchy hooks, highly polished [[arrangement]]s and Madonna's own vocal style. Her second album, ''Like a Virgin'' (1984), foreshadowed several trends in her later works. It contained references to classical works ([[pizzicato]] synthesizer line that opens "[[Angel (Madonna song)|Angel]]"); potential negative reaction from social groups ("[[Dress You Up]]" was blacklisted by the [[Parents Music Resource Center]]); and retro styles ("Shoo-Bee-Doo", Madonna's homage to [[Motown]]).&lt;ref name="fouzvocal"&gt;{{harvnb|Fouz-Hernández|Jarman-Ivens|2004|pp=59–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her mature artistic statement was visible in ''True Blue'' (1986) and ''Like a Prayer'' (1989). In ''True Blue'', she incorporated [[classical music]] in order to engage an older audience who had been skeptical of her music.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Like a Prayer'' introduced live recorded songs and incorporated different genres of music, including dance, [[funk]], [[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] and [[gospel music]].&lt;ref name="bookalbum"&gt;{{harvnb|Bronson|2002|p=329}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her versatility was further shown on ''I'm Breathless'', which consists predominantly of the 1930s Broadway [[showtune]]-flavored [[jazz]], [[swing music|swing]] and [[big band]] tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=madonna|title=CG: Madonna|publisher=Robert Christgau|accessdate=August 23, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606103847/http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=madonna|archivedate=June 6, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna continued to compose ballads and [[Glossary of musical terminology|uptempo]] dance songs for ''Erotica'' (1992) and ''Bedtime Stories'' (1994).

Pop vocalists usually sing songs "straight," but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways [[John Lennon]] and [[Bob Dylan]] did."&lt;ref name="rock star"/&gt; Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal [[timbre]] in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as "Minnie Mouse on helium".&lt;ref name="fouzvocal"/&gt; During the filming of ''Evita'', Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, "I studied with a vocal coach for ''Evita'' and I realized there was a whole piece of my voice I wasn't using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was going to make the most of it."&lt;ref name="vocal"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lamsweerde|first=Inez van|first2=Barry|last2=Walters|date=April 1998|title=Madonna Chooses Dare|journal=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=14|issue=4|pages=70–76|issn=0886-3032|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Jq-A2xEoAHIC&amp;pg=PA70|accessdate=February 26, 2010|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides singing, Madonna has the ability to play several musical instruments. She learned to play drum and guitar from her then-boyfriend Dan Gilroy in the late 1970s, before joining the Breakfast Club line-up as the drummer.&lt;ref name="Gnojewski57"/&gt; This helped her to form the band Emmy, where she performed as the guitarist and lead vocalist.&lt;ref name="Gnojewski57"/&gt; Madonna later played guitar on her [[Demo (music)|demo recordings]].

===Influences===
According to Taraborrelli, the defining moment of Madonna's childhood was the tragic and untimely death of her beloved mother. Psychiatrist [[Keith Ablow]] suggests her mother's death would have had an immeasurable impact on the young Madonna at a time when her personality was still forming.&lt;ref name="mom"&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|pp=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, author [[Lucy O'Brien]] feels the impact of the rape she suffered is the motivating factor behind everything Madonna has done, more important than the death of her mother: "It's not so much grief at her mother's death that drives her, as the sense of abandonment that left her unprotected. She encountered her own worst possible scenario, becoming a victim of male violence, and thereafter turned that full-tilt into her work, reversing the equation at every opportunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/madonna-like-an-icon-by-lucy-obrien-463929.html|title=Madonna: Like an Icon, By Lucy O'Brien|last=Burston|first=Paul|date=September 9, 2007|accessdate=September 6, 2010|newspaper=The Independent|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100928045808/http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/madonna-like-an-icon-by-lucy-obrien-463929.html|archivedate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As they grew older Madonna and her sisters would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began drifting farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come to think that she resembled poet [[Anne Sexton]] and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with [[Sylvia Plath]] being her favourite poet.&lt;ref name="mom"/&gt; Later, Madonna commented: "The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself."&lt;ref name="mom"/&gt; Taraborrelli believed that the devastation and abandonment Madonna felt at the loss of her mother taught her "a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own."&lt;ref name="mom"/&gt;

In 1985, Madonna commented that the first song to ever make a strong impression on her was "[[These Boots Are Made for Walkin']]" by [[Nancy Sinatra]]; she said it summed up her own "take-charge attitude".&lt;ref name="hot"/&gt; As a young woman, she attempted to broaden her taste in literature, art, and music, and during this time became interested in classical music. She noted that her favorite style was [[baroque music|baroque]], and loved [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] and [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] because she liked their "feminine quality".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Michael|2004|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna's major influences include [[Debbie Harry]], [[Chrissie Hynde]], [[Karen Carpenter]], [[The Supremes]] and [[Led Zeppelin]], as well as dancers [[Martha Graham]] and [[Rudolf Nureyev]].&lt;ref name="femaleinfluence"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/madonna-for-the-first-time-her-friends-and-lovers-speak-out-463608.html|title=Madonna: For the first time, her friends and lovers speak out|newspaper=The Independent|first=Lucy|last=O'Brien|date=September 1, 2007|accessdate=September 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/SHOWBIZ/Music/9901/19/madonna.lkl/|last=King|first=Larry|authorlink=Larry King|title=Interview: Madonna reviews life on Larry King Live|publisher=CNN|date=January 19, 1999|accessdate=June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also grew up listening to [[David Bowie]], whose show was the first rock concert she ever attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rockhall.com/inductees/david-bowie/transcript/madonna-accepts-for-david-bowi/|title=Madonna accepts for David Bowie|publisher=Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|accessdate=March 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna's Italian-Catholic background and her relationship with her parents are reflected in the album ''Like a Prayer''.&lt;ref name="laprsreview"/&gt; It was an evocation of the impact religion had on her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Brien|2007|pp=126–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her video for the title track contains Catholic symbolism, such as the stigmata. During The Virgin Tour, she wore a [[rosary]] and prayed with it in the music video for "La Isla Bonita".&lt;ref name="fouz"&gt;{{harvnb|Fouz-Hernández|Jarman-Ivens|2004|pp=67–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Open Your Heart" video sees her boss scolding her in the Italian language.

During her childhood, Madonna was inspired by actors, later saying, "I loved Carole Lombard and Judy Holliday and Marilyn Monroe. They were all incredibly funny&amp;nbsp;... and I saw myself in them&amp;nbsp;... my girlishness, my knowingness and my innocence."&lt;ref name="hot"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Worrell|first=Denise|title=Madonna, Why She's Hot|journal=Time|date=May 27, 1985|url=http://time.com/vault/issue/1985-05-27/page/1/|subscription=yes|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her "Material Girl" music video recreated Monroe's look in the song "[[Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend]]", from the film ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1953 film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' (1953). She studied the screwball comedies of the 1930s, particularly those of Lombard, in preparation for the film ''Who's That Girl''. The video for "Express Yourself" (1989) was inspired by [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[silent film]] ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1927). The video for "Vogue" recreated the style of [[Glamour (presentation)|Hollywood glamour]] photographs, in particular those by [[Horst P. Horst]], and imitated the poses of [[Marlene Dietrich]], Carole Lombard, and [[Rita Hayworth]], while the lyrics referred to many of the stars who had inspired her, including [[Bette Davis]], described by Madonna as an idol.&lt;ref name="carrie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Victor|2001|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Madonna's film career has been largely received negatively by film critics. Stephanie Zacharek stated in ''Time'' that, "[Madonna] seems wooden and unnatural as an actress, and it's tough to watch, because she's clearly trying her damnedest." According to biographer [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]], "Madonna puts a brave face on the criticism, but privately she is deeply hurt." After the [[box office bomb]] ''Swept Away'' (2002), Madonna vowed that she would never again act in a film, hoping her repertoire as a bad actress would never be discussed again.&lt;ref name="filmcareer"&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, a career retrospective, titled ''Body of Work'', was shown at New York's Metrograph hall. According to ''The Guardian''{{'}}s Nigel M. Smith, Madonna's film career suffered mostly due to lack of proper material supplied to her, and given a chance "[she] could steal a scene for all the right reasons".&lt;ref name="filmcareerretro"&gt;{{cite journal|last=M. Smith|first=Nigel|title=Is Madonna's acting really that bad?

Influences also came to her from the art world, such as through the works of Mexican artist [[Frida Kahlo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Voller|1999|p=170}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video of the song "Bedtime Story" featured images inspired by the paintings of Kahlo and [[Remedios Varo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guralnick|Wolk|2000|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna is also a collector of [[Tamara de Lempicka]]'s [[Art Deco]] paintings and has included them in her music videos and tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her video for "[[Hollywood (Madonna song)|Hollywood]]" (2003) was an homage to the work of photographer [[Guy Bourdin]]; Bourdin's son subsequently filed a lawsuit for unauthorised use of his father's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Gary|last=Susman|url=http://ew.com/article/2003/09/30/madonna-faces-copyright-suit-over-video-images/|magazine=Entertainment Weekly|title=Madonna faces copyright suit over video images|date=September 30, 2003|accessdate=June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pop artist [[Andy Warhol]]'s use of sadomasochistic imagery in his underground films were reflected in the music videos for "Erotica" and "Deeper and Deeper".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Guilbert|2002|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna is dedicated to [[Kabbalah]], and in 2004 she adopted the name [[Esther (given name)|Esther]] which in [[Persian language|Persian]] means "star".&lt;ref name="kab"/&gt; She has donated millions of dollars to New York and London schools teaching the subject.&lt;ref name="kab"&gt;{{harvnb|Friskics-Warren|2006|p=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report-madonna-opens-school-in-karachi-2022443|title=Madonna opens school in Karachi|newspaper=[[Daily News and Analysis]]|date=September 19, 2014|accessdate=August 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She faced opposition from rabbis who felt Madonna's adoption of the Kabbalah was sacrilegious and a case of celebrity [[wikt:dilettantism|dilettantism]]. Madonna defended her studies, saying: "It would be less controversial if I joined the Nazi Party", and that her involvement with the Kabbalah is "not hurting anybody".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/music/4393642.stm|title=Madonna defends Kabbalah interest|publisher=BBC|date=October 21, 2005|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the Kabbalah was subsequently observed in Madonna's music, especially albums like ''Ray of Light'' and ''Music''. During the Re-Invention World Tour, at one point in the show, Madonna and her dancers wore T-shirts that read "Kabbalists Do It Better".&lt;ref name="kab"/&gt;

===Music videos and performances===
{{See also|Madonna videography}}
In ''The Madonna Companion'' biographers Allen Metz and Carol Benson noted that more than any other recent pop artist, Madonna had used MTV and music videos to establish her popularity and enhance her recorded work.&lt;ref name="metz2"&gt;{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to them, many of her songs have the imagery of the music video in strong context, while referring to the music. [[Cultural critic]] [[Mark C. Taylor]] in his book ''Nots'' (1993) felt that the [[postmodern art]] form par excellence is video and the reigning "queen of video" is Madonna. He further asserted that "the most remarkable creation of MTV is Madonna. The responses to Madonna's excessively provocative videos have been predictably contradictory."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1993|p=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media and public reaction towards her most-discussed songs such as "Papa Don't Preach", "Like a Prayer", or "Justify My Love" had to do with the music videos created to promote the songs and their impact, rather than the songs themselves.&lt;ref name="metz2"/&gt; Morton felt that "artistically, Madonna's songwriting is often overshadowed by her striking pop videos."&lt;ref name="morton20"&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|2002|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna's initial music videos reflected her American and Hispanic mixed street style combined with a flamboyant glamor.&lt;ref name="metz2"/&gt; She was able to transmit her avant-garde downtown New York fashion sense to the American audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The imagery and incorporation of Hispanic culture and Catholic symbolism continued with the music videos from the ''True Blue'' era.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fouz-Hernández|Jarman-Ivens|2004|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Douglas Kellner]] noted, "such 'multiculturalism' and her culturally transgressive moves turned out to be highly successful moves that endeared her to large and varied youth audiences."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kellner|1995|p=271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna's Spanish look in the videos became the fashion trend of that time, in the form of boleros and layered skirts, accessorizing with rosary beads and a crucifix as in the video of "La Isla Bonita".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clerk|2002|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rettenmund|1995|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ExpressYourselfUnderGround cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|Madonna using the "Madonna mic" during the 1990 [[Blond Ambition World Tour]]. She was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free headsets.|alt=A young blond woman dancing in a white brasierre]]
Academics noted that with her videos, Madonna was subtly reversing the usual role of male as the dominant sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Welton|1998|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symbolism and imagery was probably the most prevalent in the music video for "Like a Prayer". The video included scenes of an African-American church choir, Madonna being attracted to a statue of a black saint, and singing in front of burning crosses. This mix of the sacred and the profane upset the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and resulted in the Pepsi commercial withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cross|2007|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, MTV named her "The Greatest Music Video Star Ever" and said that "Madonna's innovation, creativity and contribution to the music video art form is what won her the award."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Landrum|2007|p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madonna's emergence occurred during the advent of MTV; Chris Nelson from ''[[The New York Times]]'' spoke of pop artists like Madonna saying, "MTV, with its almost exclusively [[lip sync|lip-synched]] videos, ushered in an era in which average music fans might happily spend hours a day, every day, watching singers just mouth the words."&lt;ref name="sync"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/02/01/arts/music/01NELS.html?pagewanted=1|title=Lip-Synching Gets Real|last=Nelson|first=Chris|date=February 1, 2004|work=The New York Times|accessdate=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The symbiotic relationship between the music video and lip-syncing led to a desire for the spectacle and imagery of the music video to be transferred to live stage shows. He added, "Artists like Madonna and [[Janet Jackson]] set new standards for showmanship, with concerts that included not only elaborate costumes and precision-timed pyrotechnics but also highly athletic dancing. These effects came at the expense of live singing."&lt;ref name="sync"/&gt; Thor Christensen of ''[[The Dallas Morning News]]'' commented that while Madonna earned a reputation for lip-syncing during her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour, she has subsequently reorganized her performances by "stay[ing] mostly still during her toughest singing parts and [leaves] the dance routines to her backup troupe&amp;nbsp;... [r]ather than try to croon and dance up a storm at the same time."&lt;ref name="lip-sync"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/90158411/|last1=Christensen|first1=Thor|title=Loose Lips: Pop Singers' Lip-Syncing In Concert Is An Open Secret|page=B.8|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=September 15, 2001|issn=1068-624X|accessdate=August 4, 2018|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To allow for greater movement while dancing and singing, Madonna was one of the earliest adopters of hands-free radio-frequency [[Headset (audio)|headset microphones]], with the headset fastened over the ears or the top of the head, and the microphone capsule on a boom arm that extended to the mouth. Because of her prominent usage, the microphone design came to be known as the "Madonna mic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harada-sound.com/sound/handbook/rfmics.html|title=Kai Harada, sound designer and sound handbook author, writes about 'The Feeding and Care of RF Microphones'|last=Harada|first=Kai|date=September 1, 2007|publisher=Harada-Sound.com|accessdate=March 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/wimbledons-no-1-seat-455502.html|title=Wimbledon's No 1 seat|last=Castle|first=Andrew|date=July 2, 2007|work=The Independent|publisher=Independent News &amp; Media|accessdate=March 17, 2010|authorlink=Andrew Castle|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metz noted that Madonna represents a [[paradox]] as she is often perceived as living her whole life as a performance. While her big-screen performances are panned, her live performances are critical successes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Metz|Benson|1999|p=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna was the first artist to have her concert tours as reenactment of her music videos. Author Elin Diamond explained that reciprocally, the fact that images from Madonna's videos can be recreated in a live setting enhances the realism of the original videos. She believed that "her live performances have become the means by which mediatized representations are naturalized".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Diamond|1996|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taraborrelli said that encompassing multimedia, latest technology and sound systems, Madonna's concerts and live performances are "extravagant show piece[s], [and] walking art show[s]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taraborrelli|2002|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna always films her concert tours, saying: "It's like documenting and archiving your artwork. It's a record of something I created with a lot of great and talented people... They're stages of my career, and they tell a story. They're an important part of my legacy, so I'm documenting them," she explained. Madonna has expressed her desire to create a stripped-down, acoustic only concert "that continues to involve music and dance [but also] poetry and humor". She also wanted to involve water elements in her productions but had been discouraged due to logistical problems.&lt;ref name="ewtrump"/&gt;

According to Tony Sclafani from [[MSNBC]], "It's worth noting that before Madonna, most music mega-stars were guy rockers; after her, almost all would be female singers&amp;nbsp;... When the Beatles hit America, they changed the paradigm of performer from solo act to band.

Madonna has received acclaim as a role model for businesswomen in her industry, "achieving the kind of financial control that women had long fought for within the industry", and generating over $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion in sales within the first decade of her career.&lt;ref name="Routledge"&gt;{{harvnb|Kramarae|Spender|2000|p=459}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gini Gorlinski in the book ''The 100 Most Influential Musicians of All Time'' (2010), Madonna's levels of power and control were "unprecedented" for a woman in the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gorlinski|2010|p=330}}&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Colin Barrow from [[Cranfield School of Management]] described her as "America's smartest businesswoman&amp;nbsp;... who has moved to the top of her industry and stayed there by constantly reinventing herself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/madonna/Get-a-head-for-business.2566459.jp|title=Get a head for business, tune into Madonna|last=Johnston|first=Ian|work=[[The Scotsman]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924160401/http://www.scotsman.com/what-s-on/music/get-a-head-for-business-tune-into-madonna-1-556142|date=September 23, 2004|archivedate=September 24, 2015|accessdate=July 24, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[London Business School]] academics called her a "dynamic entrepreneur" worth copying; they identified her vision of success, her understanding of the music industry, her ability to recognize her own performance limits (and thus bring in help), her willingness to work hard and her ability to adapt as the keys to her commercial success.&lt;ref name=LBS&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/graduate_management/article1293585.ece|title=Case Study: Madonna|first=Jamie|last=Anderson|first2=Martin|last2=Kupp|work=The Times|publisher=News Corp|date=January 18, 2007|accessdate=August 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morton wrote that "Madonna is opportunistic, manipulative, and ruthless—somebody who won't stop until she gets what she wants—and that's something you can get at the expense of maybe losing your close ones.

It was founded, initially as the Medical Officers Union, in 1954 by Dr Vincent Tabone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rudolph|first1=Uwe Jens|last2=Berg|first2=Warren G|title=Historical Dictionary of Malta|date=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Maryland|isbn=9780810873902|pages=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was situated at Mount Misery, one of the peaks of the Rock. In 1901 its name was changed to [[Breakneck Battery]] at the suggestion of Major-General [[John Slade (British Army officer)|Sir John Slade]] of the [[Royal Artillery]]. Slade was to go on command British troops in Egypt from 1903 to 1905.&lt;ref name=slade&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sir John Slade, The Hero of Maiwand|journal=The Colonist|date=6 September 1913|page=5|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=TC19130906.2.44.1|accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following his suggestion in 1899 that it would be a suitable position to accommodate a long-range coastal defence gun, a [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX–X|9.2-inch breech-loading Mark X]] gun on a Mark V mounting was installed in 1906.&lt;ref name="Hughes308"&gt;[[#Hughes|Hughes]], p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

'''''Muggiaea atlantica''''' is a [[species]] of small [[hydrozoan]], a [[Siphonophorae|siphonophore]] in the [[Family (biology)|family]] [[Diphyidae]]. It is a cosmopolitan species occurring in inshore waters of many of the world's oceans, and it has colonised new areas such as the North Sea and the Adriatic Sea. It is subject to large population swings, and has been held responsible for the death of farmed salmon in Norway. The species was [[Species description|first described]] by J.T. Cunningham in 1892 from a specimen obtained at [[Plymouth]], England.

==Description==
''Muggiaea atlantica'' is a small colonial [[siphonophore]], but one of the two nectophores (swimming bells) is undeveloped. The remaining nectophore grows to a length of about {{convert|7|mm|1|abbr=on}}. It is translucent and has five straight, longitudinal ridges, some of which may form a keel. The hydroecium (ventral cavity) is about one third of the length of the nectophore, and the long slender somatocyst (extension of the gastrovascular system) reaches the apex of the nectosac (central cavity) and sometimes contains oil droplets.&lt;ref name=MSIP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://species-identification.org/species.php?species_group=zmns&amp;id=139 |title=''Muggiaea atlantica'' |author=van Couwelaar, M. |work=Zooplankton and Micronekton of the North Sea |publisher=Marine Species Identification Portal |accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Todd&gt;{{cite book|author1=C. D. Todd|author2=M. S. Laverack|author3=Geoff Boxshall|title=Coastal Marine Zooplankton: A Practical Manual for Students |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9KCRsSQQ-uwC&amp;pg=PT19|year=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-55533-3|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eudoxid (reproductive stage) soon becomes detached. It has a cone-shaped, asymmetric bract with a wide flanged suture running from apex to base. The right edge of the bract is curved while the left edge is truncated horizontally. The lower surface has a small cavity in which the somatocyst is situated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Russell, F.S. |authorlink = Frederick Stratten Russell|year=1938 |title=On the Development of ''Muggiaea atlantica'' Cunningham |journal=Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=441–446 |doi=10.1017/S0025315400012340 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
''Muggiaea atlantica'' is a [[Neritic zone|neritic]] species that forms part of the [[zooplankton]], and is found in the upper hundred metres of inshore temperate and subtropical waters worldwide. It is present in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean. It is a common siphonophore and probably more abundant than any other species of siphonophore in nearshore habitats. Its abundance is seasonal, and in parts of the northern hemisphere it has population peaks in May/June and again in September/November.&lt;ref name=Mapstone&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mapstone, Gillian M.|author2=Arai, Mary N.|title=Siphonophora (Cnidaria: Hydrozoa) of Canadian Pacific Waters |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8epLkhYnBGYC&amp;pg=PA23 |year=2009 |publisher=NRC Research Press |isbn=978-0-660-19843-9|pages=23–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the western English Channel it occurred sporadically before the 1960s but after 1968 it became resident. Its seasonal distribution and abundance seem to be associated with sea temperature changes and the availability of food.&lt;ref name=Blackett&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Blackett, Michael |author2=Licandro, Priscilla |author3=Coombs, Steve H. |author4=Lucas, Cathy H. |year=2014 |title=Long-term variability of the siphonophores ''Muggiaea atlantica'' and ''M. kochi'' in the Western English Channel |journal=Progress in Oceanography |volume=128 |pages=1–14 |doi=10.1016/j.pocean.2014.07.004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It appeared in the southern [[Adriatic Sea]] for the first time in the mid 1990s and became increasingly common there. It was detected in the marine lakes on the island of [[Mljet]] in southern Croatia in 2001, and seems to have displaced ''[[Muggiaea kochii]]'' in the Great Lake there. It is hypothesized that the cold winter of 2000/2001 favoured the more cold-tolerant ''M. atlantica'' over the warm-temperate ''M. kochii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Batistić, Mirna |author2=Lučić, Davor |author3=Carić, Marina |author4=Garić, Rade |author5=Licandro, Priscilla |author6=Jasprica, Nenad |year=2013 |title=Did the alien calycophoran ''Muggiaea atlantica'' outcompete its native congeneric ''M. kochi'' in the marine lakes of Mljet Island (Croatia)? |journal=Marine Ecology |volume=34 |issue=s1 |pages=3–13 |doi=10.1111/maec.12021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
''Muggiaea atlantica'' swims in an arc, propelled by pulsations of its bell, and then remains stationary for several minutes.&lt;ref name=Pitt/&gt; It feeds almost entirely on [[copepod]]s, consuming an estimated five to ten prey items daily, mostly during the night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Purcell, Jennifer E. |year=1982 |title=Feeding and growth of the siphonophore ''Muggiaea atlantica'' (Cunningham 1893) |journal=Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology |volume=62 |issue=1 |pages=39–54 |doi=10.1016/0022-0981(82)90215-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the eastern Pacific it is eaten by [[Predation|predatory]] fish such as the [[blue rockfish]] (''Sebastes mystinus''), and by the floating sea snail ''[[Carinaria cristata]]''.&lt;ref name=Mapstone/&gt;

Reproduction in this species is by an alternation of generations between an asexual polygastric animal (bearing both asexual and reproductive elements) and the sexual eudoxid stage which becomes detached from the nectophore. The generation time is short and under favourable conditions, numbers can build up rapidly.&lt;ref name=Blackett/&gt;

A population explosion of ''M. atlantica'' in the North Sea in 1989 caused  major changes in the composition of the community. The siphonophere was present at densities of five hundred per cubic metre and this depleted the copepods normally present. This resulted in a reduction in the grazing pressure on the phytoplankton and an increase in their growth, causing an [[algal bloom]] and other cascading [[ecosystem]] effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Greve, Wulf |year=1994 |title=The 1989 German Bight invasion of ''Muggiaea atlantica'' |journal=ICES Journal of Marine Science |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=355–358 |doi=10.1006/jmsc.1994.1037 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[aquaculture]] industry in Norway suffered a setback in 2007 when more than 100,000 caged [[salmon]] were killed by a bloom of ''M. atlantica'', present at a concentration of 2,000 per cubic metre in coastal waters.&lt;ref name=Pitt&gt;{{cite book|author1=Pitt, Kylie A. |author2=Lucas, Cathy H. |title=Jellyfish Blooms |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zr_EBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA133 |year=2013 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-94-007-7015-7 |pages=121–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; This siphonophore is also thought to have been involved in the loss of a million farmed salmon in Ireland in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1= Woo, Patrick T. K.|author2=Gregory, David W.

'''''Narodne novine''''' ({{lang-en|The People's Newspaper}}) is the [[official gazette]] (or [[newspaper of public record]]) of the [[Republic of Croatia]] which publishes laws, regulations, appointments and official decisions and releases them in the [[public domain]]. It is published by the eponymous public company.

The Narodne novine started as the ''Novine Horvatzke'', first published on January 6, 1835 by [[Ljudevit Gaj]], who created and printed the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dnc.nsk.hr/Newspapers/LibraryTitle.aspx?id=5e41e64d-d273-4447-9d82-98989ed95486 | language = Croatian | title = Stare hrvatske novine - Novine horvatzke | publisher = [[National and University Library in Zagreb]] | accessdate = 2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first usage of the term "Narodne novine" was in 1843, but the paper changed several names over the years, usually according to the name of the state that Croatia was part of.

Gaj sold the original publishing company to the government in 1868. The current incarnation of the company was officially founded in 1952. In 2001 the company became a [[public company]] ({{lang-hr|dioničko društvo}}).

The ''Narodne novine'' as the official gazette of the [[Republic of Croatia]] promulgates acts, laws and other rules and regulations of the [[Croatian Parliament]], [[bylaw]]s of the [[Croatian Government]] and also Decrees of the [[President of Croatia|President of the Republic]]. On publication, legislation begins a brief period (usually 8 days)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usud.hr/default.aspx?Show=ustav_republike_hrvatske&amp;m1=27&amp;m2=50&amp;Lang=en |publisher=[[Constitutional Court of Croatia]] |title=The Constitution of the Republic of Croatia |date=2001-06-15 |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091206184742/http://www.usud.hr/default.aspx?Show=ustav_republike_hrvatske&amp;m1=27&amp;m2=50&amp;Lang=en |archivedate=2009-12-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; known as ''[[vacatio legis]]'', allowing it to become widely known before taking legal effect.

The '''Ngaoundéré Central Station''' (''Gare centrale de Ngaoundéré'' in French) is the main [[railway station]] in [[Ngaoundéré]], [[Cameroon]]. It is located on the Yaoundé-Bélabo-Ngaoundéré line of the [[Camrail]] network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.camrail.net/reseau.html|title=Réseau |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2014| website=Camrail.net| language=French |publisher=CAMRAIL|accessdate=May 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station was opened on December 10, 1974. It was extensively renovated in 2012, at a cost of around two billion [[CFA francs]]. This renovation added 22 benches, 16 lamps, toilet blocks, commercial buildings, the installation of tiles and the construction of offices for the Commissioner of Railways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Petsoko |first=Mathurin |date=June 15, 2012 |title=Gare voyageurs relookée de Ngaoundéré: Les nouvelles installations inaugurées |trans-title=Passenger station revamped in Ngaoundere: New facilities inaugurated |url=http://www.journalducameroun.com/article.php?aid=11545 |language=French |newspaper=Journal du Cameroun |location= |publisher=Journal du Cameroun| accessdate=May 24, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The station serves as a discharge point for fresh foods which are then loaded into trucks for transport to points in the north of the country and in [[Chad]]. While a true dry port, the railway station in Ngaoundere lacks the appropriate infrastructure for the storage of fresh food. The food items are left in the open air, close to other types of goods, regardless of the type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://hal.cirad.fr/cirad-00471165 |title=Filières fruitières dans les savanes du Cameroun et du Tchad |last1=DANDJOUMA |first1= A.|date= April 20–23, 2009|booktitle=Actes du colloque «Savanes africaines en développement: innover pour durer» |page= 7|language= French|display-authors=et. al.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Labour Plan''' ({{lang-fr|Plan du Travail}}, {{lang-nl|Plan van de Arbeid}}), commonly known as the '''Plan De Man''' after its creator, was an economic policy devised in 1933 by the Belgian politician [[Henri De Man]] of the [[Belgian Labour Party]] (POB-BWP) to combat the economic situation experienced by Belgium in the aftermath of the [[Great Depression]]. The plan, described as a "Labour Plan", was one of the foremost examples of De Man's doctrine of "[[Planned economy|Planisme]]" (state planning).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boneau|first=Denis|title=Le planisme, une idéologie fasciste française|url=http://www.voltairenet.org/article15364.html|publisher=[[Voltaire Network]]|accessdate=3 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was aimed at "instilling a mixed economic system" by the creation of "a nationalized sector covering the organization of credit and the main industries which have already in reality been monopolized."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Deruette|first=Serge|title=La Vie en Rose: Réalités de l'Histoire du Parti Socialiste en Belgique|year=1999|publisher=Aden|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was broadly similar to the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s 1933 "[[New Deal]]" in the United States and the later [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|SDAP's]] 1935 "Plan of Work" in the Netherlands.

==Criticism==
Despite the support of the POB-BWP, the plan was criticized by many left-wing commentators. [[Leon Trotsky]] derided the plan as "a plan to deceive the toilers" and "a renovated instrument of bourgeois-democratic conservatism."&lt;ref name=Trotsky1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trotsky|first=Leon|authorlink=Leon Trotsky|title=Revisionism and Planning: The Revolutionary Struggle against Labor Fakers|journal=New International|date=January 1934|volume=11 [1945]|issue=2|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/trotsky/1934/01/planning.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trotsky further attacked the plan in a January 1934 article, entitled ''Revisionism and Planning'', in the newspaper ''[[New International]]''.&lt;ref name=Trotsky1/&gt;

The '''Pygmies''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Πυγμαῖοι}} ''Pygmaioi'', from the adjective πυγμαῖος from πυγμή ''pygmē'', "the length of the forearm") were a tribe of diminutive humans in [[Greek mythology]]. According to the [[Iliad]], they were involved in a constant war with the [[Crane (bird)|cranes]], which migrated in winter to their homeland on the southern shores of the earth-encircling river [[Oceanus]]. One story describes the origin of the age-old battle, speaking of a Pygmy Queen named [[Gerana]] who offended the goddess [[Hera]] with her boasts of superior beauty, and was transformed into a crane.

In art the scene was popular with little Pygmies armed with spears and slings, riding on the backs of goats, battling the flying cranes. The 2nd-century BC tomb near [[Panticapaeum]], [[Crimea]] "shows the battle of human pygmies with a flock of herons".&lt;ref&gt;Kubiĭovych and Shevchenka, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uZoYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=pygmies+kerch&amp;dq=pygmies+kerch&amp;pgis=1 p. 558].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Pygmies were often portrayed as pudgy, comical [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]]s. 

[[File:Pygmy Carrying Crane Sotades.jpg|thumb|right|Pygmy carrying crane. Potted by Sotades, about 460-450 BC from [[Ruvo]], [[British Museum]]]]

In another legend, the Pygmies once encountered [[Heracles]], and climbing all over the sleeping hero attempted to bind him down, but when he stood up they fell off. The story was adapted by [[Jonathan Swift]] as a template for [[Lilliput and Blefuscu|Lilliputians]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

[[St. Augustine]] (354–430) mentions the "Pigmies" in ''[[The City of God]]'', Book 16, chapter 8 entitled, "Whether Certain Monstrous Races of Men Are Derived From the Stock of Adam or Noah's Sons."&lt;ref&gt;Augustine, [https://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf102.iv.XVI.8.html Chapter 8. — Whether Certain Monstrous Races of Men Are Derived From the Stock of Adam or Noah's Sons]&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Greek geographers and writers attempted to place the Pygmies in a geographical context. Sometimes they were located in far [[India]], at other times near the [[Ethiopia]]ns of Africa. The [[Pygmy]] bush tribes of central Africa were so named after the Greek mythological creatures by European explorers in the 19th century. 

==Descriptions in literature==
[[File:Nuremberg chronicles - Strange People - Pygmy (XIIr).jpg|thumb|right|A Pygmy fighting his nemeses the cranes. From the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'' (1493).]]
From [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny's]] [[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]]:
{{cquote|Beyond these in the most outlying mountain region we are told of the Three-Span (Trispithami) Pygmae who do not exceed three spans, that is, twenty-seven inches, in height; the climate is healthy and always spring-like, as it is protected on the north by a range of mountains; this tribe Homer has also recorded as being beset by cranes. It is reported that in springtime their entire band, mounted on the backs of [[Domestic sheep|rams]] and [[Capra (genus)|she-goats]] and armed with arrows, goes in a body down to the sea and eats the cranes' eggs and chickens, and that this outing occupies three months; and that otherwise they could not protect themselves against the flocks of cranes would grow up; and that their houses are made of mud and feathers and egg-shells. [[Aristotle]] says that the Pygmies live in caves, but in the rest of this statement about them he agrees with the other authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Pliny. ''Natural History'', 7.23-7.30.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'' by [[Flavius Philostratus]]: 
{{cquote|And as to the pigmies, he said that they lived underground, and that they lay on the other side of the Ganges and lived in the manner which is related by all. As to men that are shadow-footed or have long heads, and as to the other poetical fancies which the reatise of Scylax recounts about them, he said that they didn't live anywhere on the earth, and least of all in India.&lt;ref&gt;Flavius Philostratus, ''The Life of Apollonius of Tyana'', translated by F. C. Conybeare, volume II, book III.XLVIII., 1921, p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From ''[[The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'':
{{cquote|That river goeth through the land of Pigmies, where that the folk be of little stature, that be but three span long, and they be right fair and gentle, after their quantities, both the men and the women.  And they marry them when they be half year of age and get children.  And they live not but six year or seven at the most; and he that liveth eight year, men hold him there right passing old.  These men be the best workers of gold, silver, cotton, silk and of all such things, of any other that be in the world.  And they have oftentimes war with the birds of the country that they take and eat.  This little folk neither labour in lands ne in vines; but they have great men amongst them of our stature that till the land and labour amongst the vines for them.  And of those men of our stature have they as great scorn and wonder as we would have among us of giants, if they were amongst us.  There is a good city, amongst others, where there is dwelling great plenty of those little folk, and it is a great city and a fair.  And the men be great that dwell amongst them, but when they get any children they be as little as the pigmies.  And therefore they be, all for the most part, all pigmies; for the nature of the land is such.  The great Chan let keep this city full well, for it is his.  And albeit, that the pigmies be little, yet they be full reasonable after their age, and can both wit and good and malice enough.&lt;ref&gt;''The Travels of Sir John Mandeville'', Chapter XXII, Macmillan and Co. edition, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2785">The '''Rolls of Oléron''' (''Rôles d'Oléron'', also known as the "Judgments of Oleron" and the "Rules of Oléron") were the first formal statement of [[Admiralty law|"maritime" or "admiralty" laws]] in northwestern [[Europe]].

They were promulgated by [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] in about 1160, after her return from the [[second crusade]] having accompanied her first husband [[Louis VII of France|Louis VII]]. They were based upon the ancient ''[[Lex Rhodia]]'', which had governed Mediterranean commerce since before the 1st century.  She likely became acquainted with them while at the court of King [[Baldwin III of Jerusalem]], who had adopted them, as the ''Maritime Assizes of the Kingdom of Jerusalem''.  They are named for the island of [[Oléron]] since the island was the site of the maritime court associated with the most powerful seamen's guild of the Atlantic.  She promulgated them in [[England]] at the very end of the twelfth century having been granted viceregal powers of England while King [[Richard I]] was on the [[third crusade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

| year = 1957
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were published subsequently in [[France|French]] and English. The English King [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] published them as "The judgment of the sea, of Masters, of Mariners, and Merchants, and all their doings." The Rolls greatly influenced the Baltic [[Laws of Wisbuy]] and are included in the English "[[Black Book of the Admiralty]]". They may also have influenced later maritime codes such the various "[[Pirate code|Articles]]" enforced by some [[Golden Age of Piracy|Golden Age]] pirates, for example, the "Obligations" of [[George Cusack]], who referred to them as the "Lawes of Pleron".&lt;ref name="Fox Dissertation"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fox|first1=E.

==History==
* February 21, 1955: Established as Apostolic Prefecture of Kabba from the [[Diocese of Benin City]], [[Diocese of Kaduna]] and [[Apostolic Prefecture of Oturkpo]]
* July 6, 1964: Promoted as Diocese of Kabba
* May 5, 1965: Renamed as Diocese of Lokoja

AN OUTLINE OF A HISTORY OF THE CATHOLIC DIOCESE OF LOKOJA

While the advent of the Catholic Faith in the Catholic Diocese of Lokoja is usually dated to the opening of a new mission in Lokoja in 1884, the birth of the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction, which we now call Lokoja Diocese must be dated back to 1955, when Kabba Prefecture was created, and later became Lokoja Diocese.

The creation of Kabba Prefecture resulted from a lengthy correspondence between the then Provincial and Superior-General of French-Canadian Spiritans (Canadian Spiritans). For at the end of the First World War German Missionaries were forced to leave the Cameroon, and the members of the French-Canadian Province of the Spiritans were asked to take over the German Mission in the Cameroon. Thus, the Cameroon became the field of work for the Canadian Spiritans until 1947 when their mission activity was shifted to Nigeria; in Nigeria they teamed up with their confreres from England under the authority of Father Francis Murray, the Administrator of the Prefecture of Benue until the arrival of Msgr. James Hagan as Prefect Apostolic.

In March 1955 the Prefecture of Kabba was created from Benin City Diocese and the Prefecture of Otukpo by the Vatican decree Number 1017 dated March 01, 1955; and Msgr Auguste Delisle, CSSp, a missionary since 1935 and on the Nigerian team since 1952 became the Prefect Apostolic by the Vatican decree number 2579 dated May 27, 1955. The new Prefecture was a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Onitsha. In terms of political pision Kabba Prefecture was coterminous with Kabba Province.

It was not until 1964 that the Prefecture of Kabba was raise to status of a Diocese by a Vatican decree dated July 06, 1964 with Msgr. A. Delisle as its first bishop; the name of the new diocese was Kabba and it remained a suffragan of Onitsha Archdiocese until ten weeks later when by a Vatican decree dated September 14, 1964 the Diocese of Kabba was made a suffragan of Kaduna. And by ye another Vatican decree number 1734 dated May 05, 1965 the Diocese of Kabba changed name to Diocese of Lokoja. According to Bishop Makozi,

The Prefecture of Kabba changed name briefly to Diocese of Kabba. To facilitate the administration of the diocese, the name was changed, of course with the approval of Rome, to Diocese of Lokoja, since the Kabba Provincial Headquarters was Lokoja where the Provincial Resident and his political administration resided.

A major pastoral progress was made when Idah Prefecture was created out of Lokoja Diocese with Msgr. Leopold Grimard as the Prefect Apostolic; the Prefecture was raised to the status of a diocese in 1978 with Bishop Ephraim S. Obot as its first bishop.

In 1971 the slow but sure process of indigenization of Kabba ecclesiastical jurisdiction that started with the priestly ordination of the duo of Alexius O. Makozi and Joseph Ohieku, assumed a far-reaching development when on May 30,1971 was raised to the episcopate as auxiliary bishop of Lokoja; Bishop Makozi became the bishop of Lokoja in 1972. Thus Bishop A. Delisle was the local ordinary of Kabba\Lokoja ecclesiastical jurisdiction for about seventeen years (1955 – 1972).

Bishop A.O. Makozi administered the diocese of Lokoja as the local ordinary until 1992 when he was transferred to the diocese of Port Harcourt. Bishop Joseph Sunday Ajomo replaced Bishop Makozi on May 03, 1992 as the bishop of Lokoja until he joined the Church Triumphant on June 20, 2004. May he rest in peace.

Following the sudden death of Bishop Joseph Sunday Ajomo, Late Very Rev. Fr. Joseph Ohieku was appointed the Diocesan Administrator in accordance with the relevant canonical provisions. He was automatically relieved when the Bishop elect, Msgr. Martin Dada Abejide Olorunmolu (appointed November 11, 2005), was ordained and installed February 11, 2006 as the fourth bishop of the Catholic Diocese of Lokoja.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1049">The '''Sukkites''' were an ancient [[Africa]]n nation. It is mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]] as one of three that followed King [[Shishaq]] (also spelled "Shishak," and associated by many scholars with [[Shoshenq I]]) of [[Egypt]] in his invasion of [[Jerusalem]]. This is the only biblical reference to Sukkiim.

[[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 2, Chapter 12:

:''And it came to pass, when [[Rehoboam]] had established the [[Kingdom of Judah|kingdom]], and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of the Lord, and all [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Israel]] with him...And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they had transgressed against the Lord. With twelve hundred [[chariot]]s, and threescore thousand horsemen: and the people were without number that came with him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the Ethiopians.''

'''''The Day the Leader was Killed''''' (orig. Arabic يوم مقتل الزعيم) is a [[novel]] written and published by [[Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Naguib Mahfouz]] in 1983.

==Plot summary==

The novel follows multiple narratives written in the [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream of consciousness]] format.  The novel is set during the early 1980s whilst Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]] was introducing the [[infitah]] or ''open door'' free-market economic policies which led to widespread unrest.  The plot revolves around a young Egyptian man who is in love with a co-worker, but her father will not permit their marriage because the young man cannot earn enough money to purchase and furnish an apartment.  Told from the perspective of Elwan, Randa and Elwan's grandfather Muhtashimi. Trapped in low-paid jobs amidst years of inflation and uneven distribution of wealth, Elwan and Randa's engagement has persisted for years without Elwan found the means to fulfil the financial obligations for marriage. Elwan refuses to accede to corruption or outside work to improve these circumstances, and both characters are noble and proud but perceived by others to be impractical and stagnant. Randa is pressured by her family and her government superior - Anwar - to break off the engagement as her advancing years means she will soon find herself too old to be desirable to potential suitors. Anwar simultaneously pressures Elwan to reconsider his circumstances and introduces him to his widowed sister, Gulstan, who is wealthy and looking for a new husband. Elwan finds himself attracted to Gulstan and feels sexual desire he has had to long suppress on account of his attenuated engagement to Randa. Muhtashimi is disappointed that his beloved grandson finds himself in his situation, and his narrative questions the direction of the country which as a younger man he had ardently fought to create as an activist teacher in the nationalist movement. Punctuated throughout the novel are comments on the decline of Sadat's Egypt and the increasing national despair amidst a revolution that has gradually lost its way.

Matters come to a head when Randa's mother visits Elwan's family and lays plain the problems of the engagement. Elwan's family is sympathetic as Elwan, as a man, may marry easily at any age. Elwan, unable to bear the social pressure and the lack of support for continued engagement from his family or colleagues, releases Randa from her obligations to him, despite great personal angst at betraying his love for her. Randa is in disbelief and then furious at Elwan, breaking off most contact between them and quickly dismissing her deep-seated love for Elwan, whilst Elwan remains tortured and despairing of the turn of events. She soon pursues a relationship with Anwar and then marries him, seeing it as a practical and viable alternative after years of torpor with Elwan. However she is soon disenchanted when she realizes despite Anwar's long overtures, the marriage is not one of true emotional connection and Anwar merely desires Randa as means to befit his social position and serve domestic functions. Randa, caught between modern ideals and traditional obligations, struggles with the new role and then quickly rejects it, seeking a quick divorce, which throws her and Anwar into social disrepute. Elwan meanwhile pursues a relationship of sorts Gulstan and considers marrying her, but his pride refuses the notion of him being 'sold' and he feels any match with Gulstan will be socially embarrassing and speak to weakness. Randa and Elwan reacquaint after Randa's divorce and Randa confesses the lie of the marriage to Anwar, which angers Elwan but does not lead to their reconciliation.

At the crescendo of the story, [[Assassination of Anwar Sadat|President Sadat is assassinated]], much to the horror of the characters in the story. Provoked by the events while despairing of his country and himself, Elwan goes to meet with Gulstan but finds Anwar there. In uncharacteristic rage, Elwan unleashes on Anwar kills him. The horrified Gulstan attempts to help Elwan cover up the murder on account of Anwar's pre-existing heart condition and her feelings for Elwan, but Elwan is resigned to fate and only half-heartedly attempts to conceal his crime. Elwan is imprisoned, bringing the story of Egypt's path and Elwan's into alignment. The novel ends with Muhtashimi's regret over the twin courses of disappointment, and regards Egypt as a nation caught between its many problems and a national character with occasional victories but far many disappointments and failings. Muhtashimi however recalls over the course of the novel his great faith in the teachings of the prophet and Islam, and ultimately believes as he prepares to die that faith will see his family, his grandson and his country through these yet again difficult times.

Like many of Mahfouz's novels, the book uses Egyptian history and society to analyze universal themes such as the relationship between love and economics, familiar relationships, death, and the irrationality of human emotion.
