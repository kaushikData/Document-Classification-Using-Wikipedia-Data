      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5340">An '''awkward silence''' is an uncomfortable pause in a conversation or presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Boston Globe|title=She's worried about awkward silence|date=February 16, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The unpleasant nature of such silences is associated with feelings of [[anxiety]] as the participants feel pressure to speak but are unsure of what to say next.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Intervention in human services |page=271 |author=Eveline D. Schulman |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-8016-4371-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KkdHAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In conversation, average pause length varies by language, culture and context. An awkward silence may occur if a pause has exceeded, for instance, a length generally accepted for demarcating a subject change or the end of a turn. It may be preceded by an ill-considered remark or an imbalance in which one of the participants makes minimal responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119564011/abstract?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0|title=Awkward Silences: Behavioural Antecedents and Consequences of the Conversational Lapse|journal=Human Communication Research|volume=8|issue=4|pages=299–316|date=17 Mar 2006|author1=Margaret L. Mclaughlin |author2=Michael J. Cody |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2958.1982.tb00669.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, the tension may arise from an expectation that speech is expected in the setting, such as a classroom or presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=168 |title=Between Speaking and Silence: A Study of Quiet Students |author=Mary M. Reda |publisher=SUNY Press |year=2009 |isbn=9780791493618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Europeans communicate with [[Japanese language|Japanese]], a period of meaningful silence is sometimes misinterpreted as an awkward silence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X5jDn2aRnd0C|pages=73|title= Going to Japan on Business: Protocol, Strategies, and Language for the Corporate Traveler|author=Christalyn Brannen|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|year=2002|isbn=978-1-880656-73-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Awkward silences may occur when Japanese are confronted with a direct question as the [[loss of face]] when making an unwelcome admission tends to make them reluctant to say phrases like "I don't know".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Silence in Intercultural Communication |author=Ikuko Nakane |page=164 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company |year=2007 |isbn=9789027254108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Remediation==
Awkward silences may result from a faltering conversation in which the participants have completed what they wanted to say.  To avoid such a conclusion, it has been recommended that the participants actively close the conversation by summarising what was said and thanking the others for their contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dk3WSr3d3V0C |year=2010 |title=How to Start and Make a Conversation |isbn=978-1-60138-383-9 |chapter=Exit Stage Left |author=Chris Gottschalk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When prolonged conversation is expected, people may be put at ease and conversation facilitated by contriving topics.  In a social setting where people are meeting for the first time, the organiser of the gathering may propose an [[Icebreaker (facilitation)|icebreaker]] or [[conversation opener]] such as a round of introductions.  Conversation pieces, such as novel trinkets or artworks, may be used to stimulate continued conversation.  In an online setting or [[virtual reality]], an automated agent may be used to monitor and stimulate flagging conversation by suggesting topics.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://sciencelinks.jp/j-east/article/200021/000020002100A0704719.php |title=A Virtual Space Agent that Facilitates Conversation |author=N.

In the film ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'', Mia and Vincent discuss uncomfortable silences after a pause in their conversation at Jackrabbit Slim's:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.law.uoregon.edu/org/olr/archives/80/80_Or_L_Rev_199.pdf|title=A Time to Keep Silent and a Time to Speak|author=Stefan H.

That's a good question.''&lt;br&gt;Mia: ''That's when you know you found somebody really special, when you can just shut the fuck up for a minute, and comfortably share silence.''}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikiquote:Pulp Fiction#Dialogue]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Escritura bassa vah.png|thumb|350px|The Bassa vah alphabet.]]
The '''Bassa script''', known as ''Bassa vah'' or simply ''vah'' ('throwing a sign' in [[Bassa language|Bassa]]) is an alphabet for writing the [[Bassa language]] of [[Liberia]].  It was reinvented by {{nobr|Dr. Thomas Flo Lewis}}, who rediscovered the script in South America from descendants of Bassa Slaves taken to the Americas he  instigated publishing of limited materials in the language from the mid-1900s through the 1930s, with its height in the 1910s and 1920s. It is alleged that some of the signs are based on native Bassa pictograms revealed by a former slave. It is not clear what connection it may have had with neighboring scripts, but [[Sort (typesetting)|type]] was cast for it, and an association for its promotion was formed in Liberia in 1959. It is not used contemporarily and has been classified as a failed script.&lt;ref&gt;Unseth, Peter. 2011. Invention of Scripts in West Africa for Ethnic Revitalization. In ''The Success-Failure Continuum in Language and Ethnic Identity Efforts'', ed. by Joshua A. Fishman and Ofelia García, pp. 23-32. New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Its creation should be distinguished from other orthographic attempts in the 1830s by European missionaries.

''Vah'' is a true alphabet, with 23 consonant letters, 7 vowel letters, and 5 tone [[diacritic]]s, which are placed inside the vowels. It also has its own marks for commas and periods.

==Unicode==
{{Main|Bassa Vah (Unicode block)}}
The Bassa alphabet was added to the [[Unicode]] Standard in June 2014 with the release of version 7.0.

The Unicode block for the Bassa alphabet is U+16AD0&amp;ndash;U+16AFF:

The history of Bible translations into the [[Albanian language]] can be divided into early and modern translations.

==Early Translations (Albanian Renaissance Translations)==
[[Image:16-K-Kristoforidhi.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]]]]

===The Buzuku Translations, 1554-1555===
Albanian priest [[Gjon Buzuku]] translated selected Scripture portions into Albanian which were printed in the first known Albanian book, ''The Missal'' (''[[Meshari]]''), composed in the [[Gheg]] dialect of Albanian. The Apostolic Library in the Vatican holds the only known copy of the book. Dr. Thoma Qendro prepared the Biblical text from Buzuku's ''Missal'' for the Albanian Interconfessional Bible Society's reprint in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;''Të Shkruomitë Shenjtë'' (Gjon Buzuku 1554-1555, përgatiti Thoma Qendro). Tiranë: Shoqëria Biblike Ndërkonfesionale e Shqipërisë, 2010. {{ISBN|978-1-84364-234-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elbasan Gospel Manuscript, 1761===
Earlier attempts have been recorded such as the 18th century [[Elbasan Gospel Manuscript]].&lt;ref name="Elsie2"&gt;{{Citation| last=Elsie| first=Robert| author-link=Robert Elsie| year=1995| title=The Elbasan Gospel Manuscript ("Anonimi i Elbasanit"), 1761, and the Struggle for an Original Albanian Alphabet| journal=Südost-Forschungen| volume=54| publisher=Südost-Institut| place=Regensburg, Germany| issn=0081-9077| url=http://www.elsie.de/pdf/articles/A1995ElbasanMs_Fig.pdf| format=PDF| mode=cs1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meksi Translation, 1821-1827===
[[Vangjel Meksi]] [[Vangjel Meksi#Translation of the New Testament|translated]] the New Testament in 1821 with the support of the [[British and Foreign Bible Society]]. This work was edited by bishop [[Gregory IV of Athens]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloshi, Xhevat. ''Përkthimi i V. Meksit dhe redaktimi i G. Gjirokastritit 1819-1827''. Tiranë: Onufri, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The book of Matthew was published in 1824 and the full New Testament in 1827, in both a full volume and a split two-volume set because "the Albanians had the custom of carrying their books with them near their heart."&lt;ref&gt;Vozga Ramazan. Libri Shqip 1555-1912 në fondet e Bibliotekës Kombëtare. Tiranë: Biblioteka Kombëtare / Onufri, 2010, p. 90-93.&lt;/ref&gt; An Albanian Translation of the Transcript was done by Dr. Thoma Qendro. The book was printed and published in spring of 2016 by SHBSHA.

===Kristoforidhi Translations, 1868-1884===
[[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]]&lt;ref&gt;Gillian Gloyer Albania  - 2008 p100 "Kostandin Kristoforidhi was an illustrious figure in the Albanian renaissance, Rilindja Kombetare, the 19th-century ... he returned to Istanbul in 1865 as a translator for the London-based Bible Society, who retained him until 1874.&lt;/ref&gt; translated the New Testament into Albania's two dialects as well as portions of the Old Testament (Genesis, Exodus, Deuteronomy, The Psalms, The Proverbs, and Isaiah). His work was also supported by the British and Foreign Bible Society.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Edward Mann ''Albanian literature: an outline of prose, poetry, and drama'' 1955 p121 "With his earnings he came to England and studied at London University for three years, during which time the British and Foreign Bible Society persuaded him to undertake a translation of the Bible into Albanian."&lt;/ref&gt;  These works are being reprinted by the Albanian Interconfessional Bible Society in a ten volume set which includes Kristoforidhi's Albanian Grammar (1882) and manuscript facsimiles.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Modern Translations==
===Filipaj Version, 1977===
Don Simon Filipaj worked with the Belgrade office of the United Bible Societies (UBS) to produce a Bible translation in Albanian.  The New Testament was published in 1977, which makes it the first New Testament in modern Albanian. One of the translation Consultants was Dayrell Oakley-Hill who had served in Albania with the Gendarmerie in the 1930s.  In 1994, Drita re-produced Dom Simon Filipaj's Bible which includes the [[Apocrypha]]. The version is used by Albanian Roman Catholic churches.

===ECM Version, 1993===
In 1993, European Christian Mission produced the first bound copy of the entire Bible in Albanian, prepared by Stephen Etches.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=x2-MYgEACAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; Bible smuggler [[Brother Andrew]] came personally to Albania to present this Bible to the country's president and people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opendoorsusa.org/about-us/history-of-open-doors&lt;/ref&gt; This version which was a dynamic equivalent translation similar to the English Good News Bible or German Gute Nachricht translation is now out of print.&lt;ref&gt;http://ccl.qdk.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Alb.01226&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 this was reprinted by the Albanian Interconfessional Bible Society.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===ABS Version, 1994===
In 1993, the Albanian Bible Society finished work on a translation of the complete Old Testament and by 1994 they finished the entire Bible. The Society had been preparing literature with Biblical content since 1974 and originally published its Bible with the name "Lajmi i Mirë" (LIM). The work was translated from the Italian text of the ''[[Textus Receptus]]''-based ''Nuova Diodati'' Revision 1991 and checked against the original languages and the English King James Version.&lt;ref&gt;Bibla: Diodati i Ri. Tiranë: Lajmi i Mirë, 1991-94, p. V - "Hyrje për Biblën shqip"&lt;/ref&gt; By 2002 the Society produced a revision of the New Testament which was "completely revised and compared in detail with the original text."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shoqeriabiblike.org/e2_Shoqeria.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This version continues to circulate widely among evangelical churches and is presented in various formats including the "Bibla e Studimit" (The New [[Thompson Chain-Reference Bible|Thompson Study Bible]], Albanian version 2009). In websites and [[Mobile app|apps]] this version is accessed as "ALBB Albanian Bible."  This text is copyright the Albanian Bible Society (ABS) although it is misleadingly labelled as public domain on various websites.

===Lea Plumbi-Frenzcke Version 1996 (NT)===
This  translation was published by Botime Çabej MÇM. According to the version's foreword, the textual basis is the ''[[Textus Receptus]]'' but also makes use of [[Nestle-Aland]]'s ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'' for several passages. Lea Plumbi-Frenzcke translated it with the help of Biblical Greek scholars. The literary editing was done by Gjergj Zheji. The language is slightly [[Tosk]] and the proper names reflect that (''Joani'' instead of ''Gjoni'', etc.). The stated purpose of this translation was to make a faithful, word-for-word translation that is understandable for the Albanian people.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===CHC Version, 2000 (NT)===
In 2000, Albanian linguist Vladimir Dervishi (1958-2010) produced a New Testament translation called the CHC ([[San Diego Christian College|Christian Heritage College]]) Version and is based on [[Nestle-Aland]]'s ''Novum Testamentum Graece'' with comparisons from the ''Textus Receptus''.

===New World Translation, 2000===
In 2000, the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]' ''New World Translation of the Christian Greek Scriptures'' was released in Albanian (''Shkrimet e Shenjta Përkthimi Bota e Re'');&lt;ref&gt;"Highlights of the Past Year", ''2001 Yearbook of Jehovah's Witnesses'', © Watchtower, page 8&lt;/ref&gt; the entire ''[[New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures]]'' in Albanian was released in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;"Jehovah’s Word Soars in “the Land of the Eagle”", ''The Watchtower'', October 15, 2005, page 20&lt;/ref&gt; This version is [https://www.apologjika.com/bibla-ne-perkthimin-bota-e-re/ not accepted] by Albanian Christians who do not belong to the Jehovah's Witness denomination, being viewed as "a distortion of the New Testament."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mantey |first1=Julius |title=Depth Exploration in The New Testament |date=1980 |publisher=Vantage Press |location=New York |page=136–137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SHIB Version, 2007 (NT)===
In 2007, Shërbimi Informues Biblik (SHIB) produced a text of the New Testament reportedly based on the 1912 German Luther Bibel. It was translated into Albanian by Marcel Steiner and edited by Kujtim Drizari, and called ''Besëlidhja e Re, Zëri i Zotit''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shib.info/products/produkt-1/, accessed 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interconfessional Version, 2007 (NT)===
In 2007, the [http://albanianbiblesociety.com/ Albanian Interconfessional Bible Society] (or "Shoqëria Biblike," a division of the [[United Bible Societies]]) produced a new translation of the New Testament based on ''The Greek New Testament, Fourth Revised Edition'' by the UBS. It was printed with a short concordance and names index. The Old Testament translated from Hebrew is now near completion. As reflected in its title, the introduction to the version states that it is "the fruit of the co-operative work of all the Christian confessions present in Albania" i.e. Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox.  In websites and apps this version is accessed as "AL Së bashku".  The Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania also engages in reproducing the earliest known Albanian versions or portions of the Bible.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

'''Charlotte Brooke''', (c. 1740 – 1793), born in Rantavan, [[County Cavan]], [[Ireland]], was the author of ''Reliques of Irish Poetry'', a pioneering volume of poems collected by her in the [[Irish language]], with facing translations. She was one of twenty-two children fathered by the writer [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]], author of ''Gustavus Vasa''; only she (and perhaps one other sibling) survived childhood.

==Early life==
From an early age she was attracted to books. While the rest of her family was sleeping, Brooke would go down to the study where she would spend hours reading.&lt;ref name="McCarthyEgan1904"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Justin McCarthy|author2=Maurice Francis Egan|author3=Douglas Hyde|author4=Charles Welsh |author5=Lady Gregory |author6=James Jeffrey Roche|title=Irish literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qF9AsJcMzBEC&amp;pg=PA280|accessdate=10 June 2013|year=1904|publisher=J. D. Morris &amp; company|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlotte Brooke was educated by her father Henry Brooke, and she immersed herself in reading history and literature at an early age. She was part of the first generation of the [[Protestant]] [[Anglo-Irish]] settler class who took a strong interest in the [[Irish language]] and Gaelic history; her primary interest in Irish language and literature was generated by her hearing it being spoken and recited by the laborers in [[County Cavan]] and on the [[County Kildare]] estates where her family had moved around 1758.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3537|title=Charlotte Brooke|publisher=oxforddnb.com|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was led to the study of the Irish language, and in less than two years she found herself in love with it. From reading Irish poetry and admiring its beauties, she proceeded to translate it into English, one of her earliest efforts being a song and monody by [[Turlough Carolan|Carolan]], which appeared in [[Joseph Cooper Walker]]'s&lt;ref name="oxforddnb.com"/&gt; 'Historical Memoirs of Irish Bards.'&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;{{cite book|title=Irish literature|author1=McCarthy, J.|author2=Egan, M.F.|author3=Hyde, D.|author4=Welsh, C.|author5=Roche, J.J.|date=1904|publisher=J. D. Morris &amp; company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qF9AsJcMzBEC|page=280|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mid-life==
Brooke, who was frail herself, took care of her father after her mother died in 1773. Meanwhile, the family had moved back to county Cavan, where they began living in a house they named Longfield which had been built near the Rantavan estate. A few years after [[Henry Brooke (writer)|Henry Brooke]] died in 1783, Charlotte Brooke ran into money troubles, after a model industrial village set up in [[County Kildare]] by her cousin Captain Robert Brooke went bankrupt (1787). Walker and other members of the recently created [[Royal Irish Academy]] sought to make an income for her, but Charlotte realized she had to rely on her writings and translations.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb.com"/&gt;

==Late Life==
In 1792, Brooke had taken up a life with friends in Longford, sharing a cottage due to her lack of income. On March 29, 1793, Charlotte Brooke passed of a malignant fever.&lt;ref name="oxforddnb.com"/&gt;

==Writings==
Brooke wrote:

* ''Reliques of Irish Poetry'' (1788);
* ''Dialogue between a Lady and her Pupils'' (1791);
* ''The School for Christians'' (1791);
* Natural History, etc.;
* ''Emma, or the Foundling of the Wood, and Belisarius'' (1803).

She sought to preserve the work of Irish poets, which she believed would be lost if not translated. An example of Brooke's is taken from a poem in ''Reliques of Irish Poetry''.

;''Carolan’s Monody on the Death of Mary Mac Guire''
&lt;poem&gt;
Were mine the choice of intellectual fame,
Of spelful song, and eloquence divine,
Painting’s sweet power, philosophy’s pure flame,
And Homer’s lyre, and Ossian’s Harp were mine;
The splendid arts of Erin, Greece, and Rome,
In Mary lost, would lose their wonted grace,
All would I give to snatch her from the tomb,
Again to fold her in my fond embrace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charlotte Brooke|author2=Aaron Crossley Hobart Seymour|title=Reliques of Irish poetry: consisting of heroic poems, odes, elegies, and songs, with notes explanatory and historical: and the originals in the Irish character, to which is subjoined an Irish tale|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRMwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR35|year=1816|publisher=J.

"'''A City upon a Hill'''" is a phrase from the [[parable]] of [[Salt and Light]] in [[Jesus]]'s [[Sermon on the Mount]]. In [[Matthew 5:14]], he tells his listeners, "You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden."

=="A Model of Christian Charity"==
This scripture was cited at the end of Puritan [[John Winthrop]]'s lecture or treatise, "[[A Model of Christian Charity]]" delivered on March 21, 1630 at [[Holyrood Church]] in [[Southampton]] before his first group of [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|Massachusetts Bay colonists]] embarked on the ship ''[[Arbella]]'' to settle Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Bremer, Francis, J., ''John Winthrop: America's Forgotten Founding Father'', Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 171.  It is often stated that the sermon was written aboard the flagship Arabella and delivered in Boston harbor, an error introduced by a cover letter on an early manuscript not in Winthrop's hand when the sermon was first published.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop, John, ''The Journal of John Winthrop, 1630-1649'', Harvard University Press, 1996, p.1 note 1&lt;/ref&gt; Winthrop warned his fellow Puritans that their new community would be "as a city upon a hill, the eyes of all people are upon us", meaning, if the Puritans failed to uphold their covenant with God, then their sins and errors would be exposed for all the world to see: "So that if we shall deal falsely with our God in this work we have undertaken and so cause him to withdraw his present help from us, we shall be made a story and a byword through the world". Winthrop's lecture was forgotten for nearly two hundred years until the Massachusetts Historical Society published it in 1838. It remained an obscure reference for more than another century until Cold War era historians and political leaders made it relevant to their time for false reasons, mistakenly crediting Winthrop's text as the foundational document of the idea of American exceptionalism.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel T. Rodgers, ''As a City on a Hill: The Story of America's Most Famous Lay Sermon'', Princeton University Press, 2018; and Richard M. Gamble, ''In Search of the City on a Hill: The Making and Unmaking of an American Myth'', Continuum, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in United States politics==
On 9 January 1961, President-Elect [[John F. Kennedy]] quoted the phrase during [[S:Address of President-Elect John F. Kennedy Delivered to a Joint Convention of the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts|an address]] delivered to the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court of Massachusetts]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = The President-Elect: City Upon a Hill |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,871951,00.html |newspaper=Time|date=1961-01-20|access-date=2015-09-16|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... I have been guided by the standard John Winthrop set before his shipmates on the flagship ''Arabella'' (sic) three hundred and thirty-one years ago, as they, too, faced the task of building a new government on a perilous frontier. "We must always consider", he said, "that we shall be as a city upon a hill—the eyes of all people are upon us". Today the eyes of all people are truly upon us—and our governments, in every branch, at every level, national, state and local, must be as a city upon a hill—constructed and inhabited by men aware of their great trust and their great responsibilities. For we are setting out upon a voyage in 1961 no less hazardous than that undertaken by the ''Arabella'' (sic) in 1630. We are committing ourselves to tasks of statecraft no less awesome than that of governing the Massachusetts Bay Colony, beset as it was then by terror without and disorder within. History will not judge our endeavors—and a government cannot be selected—merely on the basis of color or creed or even party affiliation. Neither will competence and loyalty and stature, while essential to the utmost, suffice in times such as these. For of those to whom much is given, much is required ...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/JFK/|title=Address of President-Elect John F. Kennedy Delivered to a Joint Convention of the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On November 3, 1980, [[Ronald Reagan]] referred to the same event and image in his Election Eve Address "A Vision for America"

{{quote |I have quoted John Winthrop's words more than once on the campaign trail this year—for I believe that Americans in 1980 are every bit as committed to that vision of a shining "city on a hill," as were those long ago settlers ...

These visitors to that city on the Potomac do not come as white or black, red or yellow; they are not Jews or Christians; conservatives or liberals; or Democrats or Republicans. They are Americans awed by what has gone before, proud of what for them is still… a shining city on a hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election Eve Address "A Vision for America"|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=85199|website=The American Presidency Project|publisher=UC Santa Barbara|accessdate=November 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

and in his January 11, 1989, farewell speech to the nation:
{{quote |I've spoken of the shining city all my political life, but I don't know if I ever quite communicated what I saw when I said it. But in my mind it was a tall, proud city built on rocks stronger than oceans, wind-swept, God-blessed, and teeming with people of all kinds living in harmony and peace; a city with free ports that hummed with commerce and creativity. And if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here. That's how I saw it, and see it still.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reaganlibrary.gov/011189i|title=Farewell Address to the Nation|website=reaganlibrary.archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

U.S. Senator [[Barack Obama]] also made reference to the topic in his commencement address on June 2, 2006 at the [[University of Massachusetts Boston]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obamaspeeches.com/074-University-of-Massachusetts-at-Boston-Commencement-Address-Obama-Speech.htm|title=Obama Speech – University of Massachusetts at Boston Commencement Address|website=obamaspeeches.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |It was right here, in the waters around us, where the American experiment began. As the earliest settlers arrived on the shores of Boston and Salem and Plymouth, they dreamed of building a City upon a Hill. And the world watched, waiting to see if this improbable idea called America would succeed.

More than half of you represent the very first member of your family to ever attend college. In the most diverse university in all of New England, I look out at a sea of faces that are African-American and Hispanic-American and Asian-American and Arab-American. I see students that have come here from over 100 different countries, believing like those first settlers that they too could find a home in this City on a Hill—that they too could find success in this unlikeliest of places.}}

In 2016, 2012 Republican presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]] incorporated the idiom into a [[Mitt Romney's March 3 speech|condemnation of Donald Trump's 2016 presidential campaign]]:

{{quote |His domestic policies would lead to recession; his foreign policies would make America and the world less safe. He has neither the temperament nor the judgment to be president, and his personal qualities would mean that America would cease to be a shining city on a hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OD8KZP30MvM |title=Romney: Trump playing Americans for suckers |publisher=YouTube.com |date=March 3, 2016 |accessdate=March 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the 2016 presidential race, Texas Senator [[Ted Cruz]] used the phrase during his speech announcing the suspension of his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4317340/ted-cruz-drops-out-suspends-campaign-speech-transcript/|title=Read Ted Cruz's Speech on Dropping Out of the Presidential Race|last=Beckwith|first=Ryan Teague|date=3 May 2016|website=Time|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Barack Obama]] also alluded to President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s use of the phrase during his speech at the Democratic National Convention the same year, as he proposed a vision of America in contrast to that of Republican presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/dnc-2016-obama-prepared-remarks-226345|title=Full text: President Obama's DNC speech|last=|first=|date=27 July 2016|work=Politico|access-date=2017-03-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, former FBI Director [[James Comey]] used the phrase in testimony before the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Senate Intelligence Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Full Transcript and Video: James Comey’s Testimony on Capitol Hill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/08/us/politics/senate-hearing-transcript.html|accessdate=20 June 2017|work=The New York Times|date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Australian politics==
In Australian politics, the similar phrase "[[the light on the hill]]" was famously used in a 1949 conference speech by then Prime Minister [[Ben Chifley]], and as a consequence this phrase is used to describe the objective of the [[Australian Labor Party]]. It has often been referenced by both journalists and political leaders in that context since this time.{{cn|date=May 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2539">'''Cúán úa Lothcháin''' was an [[Ireland|Irish poet]] from [[Tethbae|Tethba]], now in County Meath. He was the [[Chief Ollam of Ireland]] and died in 1024.

Born in the region of Tethba - part of the kingdom of [[Mide]] - Cúán acted as bard and propagandist for [[High King of Ireland|High King]] [[Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill]] (died 1022).

The [[Annals of Ulster]] give his obit as- "U1024.3 Cuán ua Lothcháin, chief poet of Ireland, was killed in [[Tethbae|Tethba]] by the men of Tethba themselves. The party that killed him became putrid within the hour. That was a poet's miracle."

The [[Annals of the Four Masters]] give his obit as- "M1024.4 Cuan Ua Lothchain, chief poet of Ireland, and a learned historian, was slain in Teathbha, and the party who killed him became putrid in one hour; and this was a poet's miracle."

The [[Annals of Inisfallen]] give his obit as- "AI1024.6 Cúán. Ua Lothcháin, chief poet of Ireland and a historian, was slain by the men of Tethba; and the man who slew him, i.e. the son of Gilla Ultáin, son of Roduib, was killed forthwith."

The [[Annals of Loch Cé]] give his obit as- "LC1024.4 Cuan Ua Lochain, i.e. the chief poet of Erinn, was slain by the men of Tethfa. God performed a ‘poet's miracle,’ manifestly, on the party that killed him, for they died an evil death, and their bodies were not buried until wolves and birds preyed upon them."

The [[Chronicon Scotorum]] give his obit as- "Annal CS1024 Kalends. Cuán ua Lothcháin, chief poet of Ireland and an expert in tradition lore was killed in Tebtha, and those nine who killed him turned putrid and that is a poet's miracle."

{{distinguish|text=his father and Buddhist scholar [[Dharmananda Damodar Kosambi]]}}

'''Damodar Dharmananda Kosambi''' (31 July 1907 – 29 June 1966) was an [[Indian people|Indian]] [[mathematician]], [[statistician]], [[philologist]], [[historian]] and [[polymath]] who contributed to genetics by introducing ''Kosambi map function''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vinod|first1=K.K. |date=June 2011|title=Kosambi and the genetic mapping function|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12045-011-0060-x |journal=Resonance|volume=16|issue=6|pages=540–550|doi=10.1007/s12045-011-0060-x|accessdate=15 December 2017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is well known for his work in [[numismatics]] and for compiling critical editions of ancient Sanskrit texts. His father, [[Dharmananda Damodar Kosambi]], had studied ancient Indian texts with a particular emphasis on Buddhism and its literature in the Pali language. Damodar Kosambi emulated him by developing a keen interest in his country's ancient history. Kosambi was also a [[Marxist]] historian specialising in ancient India who employed the [[historical materialism|historical materialist]] approach in his work.&lt;ref name=TH&gt;{{cite book |title= A Textbook of Historiography: 500 BC to AD 2000|last= Sreedharan|first= E.|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2004|publisher= Orient Blackswan |location= |isbn= 978-81-250-2657-0|page= 469|pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is particularly known for his classic work ''[[An Introduction to the Study of Indian History]]''.

He is described as "the patriarch of the Marxist school of Indian historiography".&lt;ref name=TH/&gt; Kosambi was critical of the policies of then prime minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], which, according to him, promoted capitalism in the guise of [[democratic socialism]]. He was an enthusiast of the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese revolution]] and its ideals, and, in addition, a leading activist in the World Peace Movement.

==Early life==
After a few years of schooling in India, in 1918, Damodar  and his elder sister, Manik  travelled to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] with their father, the eminent Buddhist and [[Pali]]  scholar, [[Dharmananda Damodar Kosambi]].
The latter was tasked by Professor [[Charles Rockwell Lanman]] of [[Harvard University]] to complete compiling a critical edition of [[Visuddhimagga]], a book on Buddhist philosophy, which was originally started by [[Henry Clarke Warren]].  There, the young Damodar  spent a year in a Grammar school and then was admitted to the [[Cambridge Rindge and Latin School|Cambridge High and Latin School]] in 1920. He became a member of the Cambridge branch of [[American Boy Scouts]].

It was  in Cambridge that he befriended another prodigy of the time, [[Norbert Wiener]], whose father [[Leo Wiener]] was the elder Kosambi's colleague at Harvard University.

Kosambi excelled in his final school examination and was one of the few candidates who was exempt on the basis of merit from necessarily passing an entrance examination essential at the time to gain admission to Harvard University. He enrolled in Harvard in 1924, but eventually postponed his studies, and returned to India. He stayed with his father who was now working in the Gujarat University, and was in the close circles of [[Mahatma Gandhi]].

In January 1926, Kosambi returned to the US with his father, who once again studied at Harvard University for a year and half. Kosambi studied mathematics under [[George David Birkhoff]], who wanted him to concentrate on mathematics, but the ambitious Kosambi instead took many diverse courses excelling in each of them. In 1929, Harvard awarded him the Bachelor of Arts degree with a [[Wiktionary:summa cum laude|summa cum laude]]. He was also granted membership to the esteemed [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]], the oldest undergraduate honours organisation in the United States. He returned to India soon after.

==Banaras and Aligarh==
He obtained the post of professor at the [[Banaras Hindu University]] (BHU), teaching German alongside mathematics. He struggled to pursue his research on his own, and published his first research paper, "Precessions of an Elliptic Orbit" in the ''Indian Journal of Physics'' in 1930.

In 1931, Kosambi married Nalini from the  wealthy Madgaonkar family. It was in this year that he was hired by mathematician [[André Weil]], then Professor of Mathematics at [[Aligarh Muslim University]], to the post of lecturership in mathematics at Aligarh.&lt;ref name=weil&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/24791768|title=The apprenticeship of a mathematician|last=Weil|first=André|last2=Gage|first2=Jennifer C|publisher=Birkhäuser Verlag|year=1992|isbn=9783764326500|location=Basel, Switzerland|pages=|oclc=24791768}}&lt;/ref&gt; His other colleagues at Aligarh included Vijayraghavan. During his two years stay in [[Aligarh]], he produced eight research papers in the general area of Differential Geometry and Path Spaces. His fluency in several European languages allowed him to publish some of his early papers in French, Italian and German journals in their respective languages.

|quote     =Marxism cannot, even on the grounds of political expediency or party solidarity, be reduced to a rigid formalism like mathematics. Nor can it be treated as a standard technique such as work on an automatic lathe. The material, when it is present in human society, has endless variations; the observer is himself part of the observed population, with which he interacts strongly and reciprocally. This means that the successful application of the theory needs the development of analytical power, the ability to pick out the essential factors in a given situation. This cannot be learned from books alone. The one way to learn it is by constant contact with the major sections of the people. For an intellectual, this means at least a few months spent in manual labour, to earn his livelihood as a member of the working class; not as a superior being, nor as a reformist, nor as a sentimental "progressive" visitor to the slums. The experience gained from living with worker and peasant, as one of them, has then to be consistently refreshed and regularly evaluated in the light of one's reading. For those who are prepared to do this, these essays might provide some encouragement, and food for thought.

In 1933, he joined the Deccan Education Society's [[Fergusson College]] in [[Pune]], where he taught mathematics for the next 12 years. In 1935, his eldest daughter, Maya was born, while in 1939, the youngest, [[Meera Kosambi|Meera]].

In Pune, while teaching mathematics and conducting research in the field, he started his interdisciplinary pursuit. In 1944 he published a small article of 4 pages titled 'The Estimation of Map Distance from Recombination Values' in ''Annals of Eugenics'', in which he introduced what later came to be known as [[Kosambi map function]].

One of the most important contributions of Kosambi to statistics is the widely known technique called [[proper orthogonal decomposition]] (POD). Although it was originally developed by Kosambi in 1943, it is now referred to as the [[Karhunen–Loève expansion]]. In the 1943 paper entitled 'Statistics in Function Space' presented in the ''Journal of the Indian Mathematical Society'', Kosambi presented the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition some years before Karhunen (1945) and Loeve (1948). This tool has found application to such diverse fields as image processing, signal processing, data compression, oceanography, chemical engineering and fluid mechanics. Unfortunately this most important contribution of his is barely acknowledged in most papers that utilise the POD method. In recent years though, some authors have indeed referred to it as the Kosambi-Karhunen-Loeve decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|last=Steward|first=Jeff|title=The Solution of a Burgers' Equation Inverse Problem with Reduced-Order Modeling Proper Orthogonal Decomposition|date=20 May 2009|degree=Master's|publisher=Florida State University|url=http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:253838/datastream/PDF/view|place=Tallahassee, Florida|doi=|accessdate=15 December 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215221310/http://diginole.lib.fsu.edu/islandora/object/fsu:253838/datastream/PDF/view#|archivedate=15 December 2017|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was his studies in numismatics that initiated him into the field of historical research. He did extensive research in difficult science of numismatics. His evaluation of data was by modern statistical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TG6PXBKwXNMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A Manual of Historical Research Methodology|last=Sreedharan|first=E.|publisher=Centre for South Indian Studies|year=2007|isbn=9788190592802|location=Thiruvananthapuram, India|pages=|access-date=16 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826053328/https://books.google.co.in/books?id=TG6PXBKwXNMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|archive-date=26 August 2017|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made a thorough study of Sanskrit and ancient literature, and he started his classic work on the ancient poet [[Bhartṛhari]]. He published his critical editions of Bhartrihari's [[Śatakatraya]] and [[Subhashita]]s during 1945–1948.

It was during this period that he started his political activism, coming close to the radical streams in the ongoing Independence movement, especially the [[Communist Party of India]]. He became an outspoken [[Marxism|Marxist]] and wrote some political articles.

==Tata Institute of Fundamental Research==
In 1945, [[Homi J. Bhabha]] invited Kosambi to join the [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research]] (TIFR) as Professor of Mathematics, which he accepted. After independence, in 1948–49 he was sent to England and to the USA as a UNESCO Fellow to study the theoretical and technical aspects of computing machines.  In London, he started his long-lasting friendship with Indologist and historian [[A.L. Basham]].  In the spring semester of 1949, he was a visiting professor of geometry in the Mathematics Department at the [[University of Chicago]], where his colleague from his Harvard days, [[Marshall Harvey Stone]], was the chair. In April–May 1949, he spent nearly two months at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]], discussing with such illustrious physicists and mathematicians as [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]], [[Hermann Weyl]], [[John von Neumann]], [[Marston Morse]], [[Oswald Veblen]] and [[Carl Ludwig Siegel]] amongst others.

After his return to India, in the [[Cold War]] circumstances, he was increasingly drawn into the World Peace Movement and served as a Member of the [[World Peace Council]]. He became a tireless crusader for peace, campaigning against the nuclearisation of the world. Kosambi's solution to India's energy needs was in sharp conflict with the ambitions of the Indian ruling class. He proposed alternative energy sources, like solar power. His activism in the peace movement took him to Beijing, [[Helsinki]] and Moscow. However, during this period he relentlessly pursued his diverse research interests, too. Most importantly, he worked on his Marxist rewriting of ancient Indian history, which culminated in his book, ''[[An Introduction to the Study of Indian History]]'' (1956).

He visited China many times during 1952–62 and was able to watch the Chinese revolution very closely, making him critical of the way modernisation and development were envisaged and pursued by the Indian ruling classes. All these contributed to straining his relationship with the Indian government and Bhabha, eventually leading to Kosambi's exit from the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in 1962.

==Post-TIFR days==
His exit from the TIFR gave Kosambi the opportunity to concentrate on his research in ancient Indian history culminating in his book, ''The Culture and Civilisation of Ancient India'', which was published in 1965 by Routledge, Kegan &amp; Paul. The book was translated into German, French and Japanese and was widely acclaimed. He also utilised his time in archaeological studies, and contributed in the field of statistics and number theory. His article on numismatics was published in February 1965 in [[Scientific American]].

Due to the efforts of his friends and colleagues, in June 1964, Kosambi was appointed as a Scientist Emeritus of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) affiliated with the Maharashtra ''Vidnyanvardhini'' in Pune. He pursued many historical, scientific and archaeological projects (even writing stories for children). But most works he produced in this period could not be published during his lifetime. On 29 June 1966, he died in Pune. He was posthumously decorated with the ''Hari Om Ashram Award'' by the government of India's University Grant Commission in 1980.

His friend A.L. Basham, a well-known indologist, wrote in his obituary:

:At first it seemed that he had only three interests, which filled his life to the exclusion of all others  — ancient India, in all its aspects, mathematics and the preservation of peace. For the last, as well as for his two intellectual interests, he worked hard and with devotion, according to his deep convictions. Yet as one grew to know him better one realized that the range of his heart and mind was very wide...In the later years of his life, when his attention turned increasingly to anthropology as a means of reconstructing the past, it became more than ever clear that he had a very deep feeling for the lives of the simple people of Maharashtra.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.oocities.org/bhupindersingh2/ddk/intro/intro.htm|title=Indian society: historical probings, in memory of D.

|quote     =Certain opponents of [[Marxism]] dismiss it as an outworn economic dogma based upon 19th century prejudices. Marxism never was a dogma. There is no reason why its formulation in the 19th century should make it obsolete and wrong, any more than the discoveries of [[Gauss]], [[Michael Faraday|Faraday]] and [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]], which have passed into the body of science... The defense generally given is that the [[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]] and the [[Upanishads]] are Indian; that foreign ideas like Marxism are objectionable. This is generally argued in English the foreign language common to educated Indians; and by persons who live under a mode of production (the bourgeois system forcibly introduced by the foreigner into India.) The objection, therefore seems less to the foreign origin than to the ideas themselves which might endanger class privilege. Marxism is said to be based upon violence, upon the class-war in which the very best people do not believe nowadays. They might as well proclaim that meteorology encourages storms by predicting them. No Marxist work contains incitement to war and specious arguments for senseless killing remotely comparable to those in the divine Gita.

As a historian, Kosambi revolutionised Indian historiography with his realistic and scientific approach. He understood history in terms of the dynamics of socio-economic formations rather than just a chronological narration of "episodes" or the feats of a few great men – kings, warriors or saints. In the very first paragraph of his classic work, ''[[An Introduction to the Study of Indian History]]'', he gives an insight into his methodology as a prelude to his life work on ancient Indian history:

:"The light-hearted sneer “India has had some episodes, but no history“ is used to justify lack of study, grasp, intelligence on the part of foreign writers about India’s past. The considerations that follow will prove that it is precisely the episodes — lists of dynasties and kings, tales of war and battle spiced with anecdote, which fill school texts — that are missing from Indian records. Here, for the first time, we have to reconstruct a history without episodes, which means that it cannot be the same type of history as in the European tradition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/AnIntroductionToTheStudyOfIndianHistory-D.D.Kosambi|title=An introduction to the study of Indian history|last=Kosambi|first=Damodar Dharmanand|publisher=Popular Prakashan|year=1975|isbn=|edition=Second|location=Mumbai, India|page=1|orig-year=1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[A. L. Basham]], "''An Introduction to the Study of Indian History'' is in many respects an epoch making work, containing brilliantly original ideas on almost every page; if it contains errors and misrepresentations, if now and then its author attempts to force his data into a rather doctrinaire pattern, this does not appreciably lessen the significance of this very exciting book, which has stimulated the thought of thousands of students throughout the world."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Professor [[Sumit Sarkar]] says: "Indian Historiography, starting with D.D. Kosambi in the 1950s, is acknowledged the world over – wherever South Asian history is taught or studied – as quite on a par with or even superior to all that is produced abroad. And that is why [[Irfan Habib]] or [[Romila Thapar]] or [[Ram Sharan Sharma|R.S. Sharma]] are figures respected even in the most diehard anti-Communist American universities. They cannot be ignored if you are studying South Asian history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In his obituary of Kosambi published in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', [[J. D. Bernal]] had summed up Kosambi's talent as follows: "Kosambi introduced a new method into historical scholarship, essentially by application of modern mathematics. By statistical study of the weights of the coins, Kosambi was able to establish the amount of time that had elapsed while they were in circulation and so set them in order to give some idea of their respective ages."

== Mathematical and scientific publications ==

In addition to the papers listed below, Kosambi wrote two books in mathematics, the manuscripts of which have not been traced. The first was a book on path geometry that was submitted to [[Marston Morse]] in the mid-1940s and the second was on prime numbers, submitted shortly  before his death. Unfortunately, neither book was published.  The list of articles below is complete but does not include his essays on science and scientists, some of which have appeared in the collection ''Science, Society, and Peace'' (People's Publishing House, 1995). Four articles (between 1962 and 1965) are written under the pseudonym S. Ducray.

The '''Ecole Supérieure Roi Fahd de Traduction''' ('''ESRFT''', "King Fahd School of Translation", {{lang-ar|مدرسة الملک فهد العلیا للترجمة}}&lt;!--Arabic from http://www.esrft.uae.ma/portal/img/01.jpg --&gt;) is a [[translation and interpreting school]] located in [[Tangier]], [[Morocco]].

==History and operations==
The school was established in Tangier in 1986 in an attempt to regularize the training of translators in this multilingual region. Before then, specialized centres for training translators did not exist in the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref&gt;Basil Hatim and Malcolm Williams. 1998.

{{Crossdressing}}

In the context of [[dominance and submission]] or [[kink (sexual)|kink]] subcultures,  '''"forced" feminization'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Definition - What does Forced Feminization mean?" Kinkly.com. Retrieved 27 Jan. 2018.|url=https://www.kinkly.com/definition/6140/forced-feminization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.transfemme.com/faqs/forced-feminization-stories/|title=Forced Feminization Stories|work=Transfemme|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''feminisation''' (see [[British and American spelling differences|spelling differences]]), also known as '''sissification''', refers to the practice of dressing a [[submissive (sexual)|submissive]] partner as a woman and/or encouraging or training them to act in a feminine or exaggeratedly feminine ("hyperfeminine") manner. If male, the submissive partner may be called a "sissy". Feminization may occur without a partner as a component of solo masturbation and/or through interactions with an online community.

Feminization is usually achieved via [[cross-dressing]], where the male is dressed in female attire, ranging from just wearing female undergarments to being fully dressed in very feminine attire, including make-up, hairdress and nail polish. Some males take on tasks, behaviours and roles that are overtly feminine, and adopt female mannerisms and postures in tasks such as sitting, walking, and acting in a feminine manner. This emasculation may be coupled with punishments such as [[erotic spanking|spanking]] or caning to gain cooperation and heighten submission of submissive male. Begging and pleading to stop the feminization may be part of the fantasy.

Costumes are sometimes very domestic, suggestive of servitude or [[ageplay]]. The clothes may be from those of a traditional submissive female role, such as schoolgirl, secretary or a "sissy" maid, or others, such as a princess.

Forced feminization may also include the male receiving [[anal sex]] from a female using a [[strap-on dildo]] (sometimes called [[Pegging (sexual practice)|pegging]]), or penetration from a male, or group of males. [[Butt plugs]] and other anal-penetrative toys may also be used. Anal sex is used because it may be perceived to be feminine due to its traditional use on women in heterosexual relationships, or due to the passive and submissive nature of being penetrated, whereas the typical male role may be judged to be more active/dominant. Alternatively, the feminized male may be "forced" to perform oral sex on a male.

Another common practice in feminization is [[Erotic sexual denial|orgasm control]], often through the use of a [[Chastity belt (BDSM)|chastity belt]]. Also encountered in feminization are the following: [[erotic humiliation]], [[bondage (BDSM)|bondage]], [[petticoating]], [[cuckold]]ry, [[leather subculture|leather]], [[Latex and PVC fetishism|latex/pvc]], [[Paraphilic infantilism|infantilism]], [[corporal punishment]], etc.

Feminization can also involve the conversion of a [[masculine]] name into a [[Grammatical gender#Personal names|feminine]] name such as "Stephen" into "Stephanie", "Joseph" into "Josephine", or "Daniel" into "Danielle", as part of a constructed feminine persona. The submissive male may also be given feminine name that is different from his male name, referred to as "a good girl", or insulted and degraded with derogatory terms usually applied to women, such as "slut" or "whore".

==Maid training==
[[File:Tranvestite Latex Maid.JPG|thumb|A feminized male wearing a latex maid's uniform]]
In particular, a very common theme in feminization is "sissy maid" training. In a typical scenario, a male submissive, or sissy maid, is dressed in an often sexy and frilly maid uniform to help enhance the sexual thrill. The activities the sissy is made to perform range from mundane household tasks that a real maid would perform, to degrading tasks that invoke erotic humiliation. The "sissy maid" might also be instructed to perform sexual acts, however, these acts usually place the sissy in submissive or passive role.

[[Image:Gaff.jpg|thumb|250px|right|]]
[[Image:Fishing with gaff hook.png|thumb|250px|RIGHT|Fishing with gaff hook]]
In [[fishing]], a '''gaff''' is a pole with a sharp hook on the end that is used to stab a large [[fish]] and then lift the fish into the boat or onto shore. Ideally, the hook is placed under the [[Vertebral column|backbone]]. Gaffs are used when the weight of the fish exceeds the breaking point of the [[fishing line]] or the [[fishing pole]]. A gaff cannot be used if it is intended to release the fish unharmed after capture, unless the fish is skilfully gaffed in the lip, jaw, or lower gill using a thin gaff hook. 

A "flying gaff" is a specialized type of gaff used for securing and controlling very large fish.  The hook part of the gaff (the head) detaches when sufficient force is used, somewhat like a [[Harpoon|harpoon's]] dart. The head is secured to the boat with a length of heavy rope or cable.

'''Gabrielle van Zuylen''' (9 July 1933 – 3 July 2010), born '''Gabriëlle (Gaby) Andrée Iglesias Velayos y Taliaferro''', baroness van Zuylen van Nyevelt van de Haar, was a French [[landscape architect]], [[garden designer]], garden writer and a member of the [[International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List]] since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/bestdressed/bestdressed_women?currentPage=3 |title=The International Hall of Fame: Women |magazine=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |accessdate=2018-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910003224/http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/bestdressed/bestdressed_women?currentPage=3 |archivedate=2011-09-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Baroness Gabrielle van Zuylen personifies the charm and elegance", according to the French magazine ''[[L'ŒIL]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=1 February 2002 |title=Les jardins de Gabrielle van Zuylen |trans-title=The gardens of Gabrielle van Zuylen |url=https://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/actualites/les-jardins-de-gabrielle-van-zuylen-86736 |language=fr |magazine=L'ŒIL |location=Paris |publisher=Éditions Artclair |access-date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Gabrielle van Zuylen was born in southern France, daughter of Andrés Iglesias y Velayos, the Spanish consul in [[Perpignan]], and his wife Mildred Taliaferro. She grew up in the United States and studied at [[Radcliffe College]]. She bears the title baroness van Zuylen as wife of the Dutch baron {{ill|Thierry van Zuylen van Nyevelt van de Haar|nl}} since they got married in 1956 in [[Boston]]. Although they divorced in 1987, Gabrielle retained the name Van Zuylen.

The Van Zuylen couple bought the property Haras de Varaville in [[Normandy]] in 1964. The property consisted of a 17th-century [[stable]] and ruins of castles that burned down in 1937. They asked the American architect Peter Harden to build a new home in a modern style. The garden was created and designed by the British landscape architect [[Russell Page]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Valéry |first=Marie-Françoise |editor-last=Taschen |editor-first=Angelika |date=1997 |title=Gardens in France |url= |location= |publisher=[[Benedikt Taschen]] |pages=122–127 |isbn=9783836556552 |author-link=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabrielle van Zuylen later wrote the book ''The Gardens of Russell Page'', which is about his influence in landscape architecture. The [[Garden Writers Association of America]] named this work ‘best book on gardens’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Zuylen |first=Gabrielle |translator-last=Paris |translator-first=I. Mark |date=1995 |title=The Garden: Visions of Paradise |series=‘[[New Horizons (Thames &amp; Hudson)|New Horizons]]’ series |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Garden.html?id=sOh9QgAACAAJ |location=London |publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]] |page=176 |isbn=9780500300558 |quote=About the author}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became a specialist on the construction of gardens and published several works about the subject, especially about historic gardens. Her books appeared mostly in French and English and some were also published or translated in other languages. She was a member of the {{ill|International Dendrology Society|de}}, Les Amateurs de Jardins and was a Chevalier of the [[Order of Agricultural Merit]]. She was also a gardener.

== Interview ==
An interview between Van Zuylen and [[Éditions Gallimard]] took place on the occasion of the publication of {{lang|fr|Tous les jardins du monde}} (UK ed. – ''The Garden: Visions of Paradise''), a heavily illustrated [[Pocket edition|pocket book]] belonging to the [[Collection (publishing)|collection]] "[[Découvertes Gallimard]]", which gives a concise history of the gardens, from antiquity to the modern day.

Van Zuylen described that pleasure is the primary purpose of a garden, the gardens have always been called "pleasure gardens". There are also three main functions of the garden: the sacred – "sacred enclosure", the place blessed by gods; the power – the great gardens of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] in [[Achaemenid Empire|Persia]] were wonderful paradises, but also masterful demonstrations of power; the domestic – the small, useful and popular city gardens.&lt;ref name=Entretien&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gallimard.fr/catalog/entretiens/01025288.htm |title=Rencontre avec Gabrielle Van Zuylen, à l'occasion de la parution de ''Tous les jardins du monde'' (1994) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2004 |website=[[Éditions Gallimard]] |publisher= |accessdate=2018-02-24 |language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Romans were the first to have the aesthetic concern of nature, for them, the [[Roman gardens|garden]] was the counterpart of architecture. In the [[Middle Ages]], the garden also played a very important role, but in another sense: it was [[Walled garden|walled]], protected from the outside. It was the [[Hortus conclusus|secret garden]], the garden of delights, allegory and theatre of love. The large classical gardens of the monarchy at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]] and [[Versailles]], the [[French formal garden|gardens ''à la française'']]. In the eighteenth-century England, on the contrary, with the [[landscape gardens]] developed by the large landowners which are far from the [[Court (royal)|court]]. The garden is truly a mirror, the counterpart of the social, political and artistic history of a civilisation.&lt;ref name=Entretien /&gt;

[[File:Paradise on Earth – The Gardens of Western Europe &amp; The Garden – Visions of Paradise.jpg|thumb|left|300px|US edition (left) and UK edition.]]
{{lang|fr|Tous les jardins du monde}} (lit. "All the Gardens of the World"; in United Kingdom – ''The Garden: Visions of Paradise''; in United States – ''Paradise on Earth: The Gardens of Western Europe''), an elegantly and beautifully illustrated pocket-sized book that treats about the [[History of gardening|history of Western gardens]] in a professional way, from antiquity (chap. Ⅰ, "The Gardens of Antiquity and the Legacy of Islam": the [[History of gardening#Mesopotamian Gardens|Mesopotamian]], [[Persian gardens|Persian]], [[Greek gardens|Greek]] and [[Roman gardens]]), [[Monastic garden|medieval Europe]] (chap. Ⅱ, "The Medieval Garden"), [[Italian Renaissance garden|Renaissance Italy]] (chap. Ⅲ, "The Gardens of Renaissance Italy"), [[French formal garden|Classical France]] (chap. Ⅳ, "Formality Triumphant: The Classic French Garden"), [[English landscape garden|18th-century England]] (chap. Ⅴ, "Planting Pictures: The English Landscape Garden") up to the modern day (chap. Ⅵ, "From Eclecticism to Modernism": for instance, the [[Parc André Citroën]]). The book provides numerous historical documents in its second part—the "Documents" section—which contains a compilation of excerpts divided into seven parts: 1, The origins of European gardens; 2, Gardens of the Middle Ages; 3, The Renaissance; 4, The royal gardens of France; 5, Art or nature?; 6, The diversity of 20th-century gardening; 7, Gardens of the New World. At the end of the book are glossary, list of the great European gardens, excerpts from the [[Florence Charter]], further reading, list of illustrations and index. It has been translated into [[American English|American]] and [[British English]], Italian, Japanese, Korean, Russian, Turkish, [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified]] and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional Chinese]].

Van Zuylen explains in the book the origin and meaning of a number of historical terms:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boekpraat.nl/Genres/Kunst__strips/Garden__The__Visions_of_paradise_ |title=The garden – visions of paradise |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2007 |website=boekpraat.nl |language=nl |access-date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Persian {{transl|el|parádeisos}}: via [[Alexander the Great]] the Greeks became familiar with the phenomenon of ornamental garden—the Persian {{transl|el|parádeisos}}—characterised by a watercourse in cross form, the [[Charbagh]].
* [[Epicureanism]]: "happiness lies in moderation and refinement", refers to an [[Epicurus|eponymous philosopher]] and gardener in ancient Athens.
* {{lang|la|[[Genius loci]]}}: originally the place dedicated to a local god (a protective spirit), later the specific attributes or special significance of a piece of landscape.
* {{lang|la|Hortus}}: with the Romans, originally a place for cultivation of vegetables or fruits, later that is combined with water, [[trellis work]] and murals. Currently it means "garden" as in [[horticulture]].

[[File:Meister des Frankfurter Paradiesgärtleins 001.jpg|thumb|left|300px|'The "Mary Garden" ({{lang|de|[[Paradiesgärtlein]]}}) by an unknown [[Upper Rhenish Master|Rhenish master]] in the early 15th century is at once an exemplary {{lang|la|[[hortus conclusus]]}} and a telling record of late medieval gardening practices.' – Excerpted from the caption for the painting which found on {{pp.|40|41}} as a double-page spread illustration in this book.]]
It is natural using French sources in an English garden book, especially with regard to the medieval gardens, such as the frescoes from the [[Palais des Papes]] in [[Avignon]] and illustrations from the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]. But the author didn't forget to include some German sources, with {{lang|de|[[Paradiesgärtlein]]}} being one of them.

It goes without saying that the glory of classical French garden culture and the dynasties of famous garden designers are discussed: [[Claude Mollet|Claude]] and [[Jacques Mollet]] (inventor of the [[French formal garden#Parterres de broderie|parterres de broderie]]), [[André Le Nôtre]] (known for the gardens of [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]], [[Gardens of Versailles|Versailles]] and the [[Jardin du Luxembourg]]).

A less well known figure, [[Peter Joseph Lenné]], a 19th-century [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] gardener and landscape architect who worked in [[Potsdam]] and [[Berlin]] ([[Klein Glienicke]], [[Pfaueninsel]] and [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]]).

Following the [[Viennese Prater]] as the first public park, [[Napoleon III]] commissioned around 1850 the prefect of the [[Seine (department)|Seine department]], baron [[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]] to direct the [[Haussmann's renovation of Paris|renovation of Paris]]. Haussmann worked with the engineer [[Adolphe Alphand]] and the gardener [[Jean-Pierre Barillet-Deschamps]], they changed the closed hunting forest [[Bois de Boulogne]] into a recreation park for the Parisian public. At the same time, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] designed the [[Central Park]] in New York City.

Then in the modern times, the beloved gardens of [[Gertrude Jekyll]] ([[Munstead Wood]]), [[Vita Sackville-West]] ([[Sissinghurst Castle Garden]]) and Major [[Lawrence Johnston]] ([[Hidcote Manor Garden]]). The current canon of the good garden: a formal structure in combination with an informal planting, especially the [[perennials]].

Van Zuylen closes her book with a reflection: {{Quote|text=Garden-making, like other art forms, draws on the past as it looks to the future. Tradition and innovation are the warp and weft of its history. A garden design is a visual statement of the relationship among human beings, their natural environment and prevailing cultural values […] Gardeners around the world share a common goal: to create a retreat, however limited in space or charm, that offers sanctuary from the tensions of modern life, a place where people can once again relate to nature and feel the pulse of our living, growing planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Van Zuylen |first=Gabrielle |translator-last=Paris |translator-first=I.

'''Hillel Zeitlin''' (1871–1942) was a [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] writer who edited the Yiddish newspaper ''Moment'', among other literary activities. He was born in the [[Mogilev Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (present-day [[Gomel Region]] of [[Belarus]]) to a [[Chassidic]] [[Chabad]] family. Already in his childhood, he was recognized for his particularly sharp and analytical mind. When Zeiltin turned 15, his father died and he decided to become a Hebrew teacher.

His exit from the world of the [[Yeshiva]] exposed him to the works of the scholars of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. He began studying in earnest the works of both [[Jewish]] philosophers ([[Maimonides]], [[Gersonides]], [[Spinoza]] etc.) and non-[[Jewish]] ones such as [[Schopenhauer]], [[Nietzsche]] and others.

During this period in his life, he began questioning his [[religious beliefs]] and eventually drifted toward [[secularism]].

Zeitlin also grew close to the [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|territorialist movement]] and lent his support to the "[[British Uganda Programme|Uganda proposal]]". Zeitlin was of the opinion that it would be impossible to settle in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] without removing the half a million [[Palestinian Arabs]] and so the [[Zionist]] proposals would fail.&lt;ref&gt;Shapira, Anita (1999). ''Land and Powe: The Zionist Resort to Force, 1881-1948''. Stanford University Press. {{ISBN|0-8047-3776-2}}. p 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a practical [[Jewish Territorialist Organization|territorialist]] and his writings took on more urgency after the notorious [[pogroms]] in [[Kishinev]] and [[Homel]].

After World War I, Zeitlin gradually drifted back toward [[tradition]] and began leading an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] lifestyle. The reason(s) for this drastic change in his life is not completely clear but may have had something to do with the suffering of Jews during the war.

At the same time, Zeitlin remained independent and unconventional in his beliefs and actions. He did not, for instance, hesitate to eulogize his former friend the great writer and thinker [[Yosef Haim Brenner]], who was an ardent secularist.

When the [[Nazis]] began liquidating [[Polish Jewry]] in 1942, Zeitlin was 71 years old. He was killed by Nazis in the [[Warsaw ghetto]]&lt;ref name=" Fine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fine|first1= Lawrence |last2= Fishbane|first2= Eitan |last3=Rose|first3=Or N |title=Jewish Mysticism and the Spiritual Life: Classical Texts, Contemporary Reflections|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5qT52SSB5LAC&amp;dq=%22Kalonymus+Kalman+Shapira%22+killed&amp;q=zeitlin#v=snippet&amp;q=zeitlin&amp;f=false|year=2010|publisher=[[Jewish Lights Publishing]]|isbn=978-1-58023-434-4|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while holding a book of the [[Zohar]] and wrapped in a [[Tallit|prayer shawl]] and [[Tefillin|phylacteries]]. Most of his family was also killed; the only survivor was his elder son Aaron.

His sons, [[Aaron Zeitlin]] (1898-1973) and [[Elchanan Zeitlin]] (1900-1942), were also Yiddish writers.

An [[ophthalmologist]] by profession, Rizal became a writer and a key member of the Filipino [[Propaganda Movement]] which advocated [[political reform]]s for the colony under [[Spanish Empire|Spain]].

He was executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of [[Wikt:rebellion|rebellion]] after the [[Philippine Revolution]], inspired in part by his writings, broke out. Though he was not actively involved in its planning or conduct, he ultimately approved of its goals which eventually led to [[Philippine independence]].

He is widely considered one of the greatest heroes of the Philippines and has been recommended to be so honored by an officially empaneled National Heroes Committee. However, no law, executive order or proclamation has been enacted or issued officially proclaiming any Filipino historical figure as a [[National hero of the Philippines|national hero]].&lt;ref name="national"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/researches/rrb_0301_1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419232121/http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/researches/rrb_0301_1.pdf |archivedate=April 19, 2016 |title=Selection and Proclamation of National Heroes and Laws Honoring Filipino Historical Figures |accessdate=September 8, 2009 |publisher=Reference and Research Bureau Legislative Research Service, House of Congress |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the author of the novels ''[[Noli Me Tángere (novel)|Noli Me Tángere]]'' and ''[[El filibusterismo]]'', and a number of poems and essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zaide|first1=Gregorio F.|last2=Zaide|first2=Sonia M.|title=Jose Rizal: Life, Works and Writings of a Genius, Writer, Scientist and National Hero|year=1999|publisher=All-Nations Publishing Co., Inc.|location=Quezon City|isbn=978-971-642-070-8|url=http://www.allnationspublishing.com/articles/6/1/Jose-Rizal-Life-Works-and-Writings-of-a-Genius-Writer-Scientist-and-National-Hero/Page1.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923080018/http://www.allnationspublishing.com/articles/6/1/Jose-Rizal-Life-Works-and-Writings-of-a-Genius-Writer-Scientist-and-National-Hero/Page1.html|archivedate=September 23, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VIAF"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rizal y Alonso, José Protasio, 1861–1896|website=|publisher=Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)|location=|url=http://viaf.org/viaf/41845763/|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:José Rizal baptism.jpg|thumb|José Rizal's baptismal register]]
[[File:Francisco r mercado.jpg|thumb|upright|Francisco Mercado Rizal (1818–1897)]]
José Rizal was born in 1861 to Francisco Rizal Mercado y Alejandro and [[Teodora Realonda y Quintos|Teodora Alonso Realonda y Quintos]] in the town of [[Calamba, Laguna|Calamba]] in [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] province. He had nine sisters and one brother. His parents were leaseholders of a ''[[hacienda]]'' and an accompanying rice farm by the [[Dominican order|Dominicans]]. Both their families had adopted the additional surnames of ''Rizal'' and ''Realonda'' in 1849, after Governor General [[Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa]] decreed the adoption of [[Catálogo alfabético de apellidos|Spanish surnames]] among the [[Filipino people|Filipino]]s for census purposes (though they already had Spanish names).

Like many families in the Philippines, the Rizals were of mixed origin. José's patrilineal lineage could be traced back to [[Fujian]] in China through his father's ancestor Lam-Co, a Chinese merchant who immigrated to the Philippines in the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joserizal.ph/fm01.html|title=Jose Rizal [Rizal Family]|work=joserizal.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asianhistory.about.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asianhistory.about.com/od/profilesofasianleaders/p/joserizalbio.htm|title=Jose Rizal Biography – National Hero of the Philippines|author=Kallie Szczepanski|work=About.com Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|1=When José was baptized, the record showed his parents as Francisco Rizal Mercado and Teodora Realonda.[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/mcc_joserizal/life_lineage1.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+02:25:55 "José Rizal’s Lineage"]|group=note}}&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philippine-embassy.de/bln/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=804&amp;Itemid=357&amp;lang=de http://www.oovrag.com/essays/essay2010c-3.shtml http://www.joserizal.ph/fm01.html http://allaboutjoserizal.weebly.com/uploads/2/1/8/0/21807656/6084787.png?794 https://xhellephyeom23.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/rizal-genealogyxx.jpg https://akosimendozaabby.files.wordpress.com/2013/06/family-tree.png&lt;/ref&gt; Lam-Co traveled to Manila from [[Amoy]], China, possibly to avoid the famine or plague in his home district, and more probably to escape the [[Manchu]] invasion. He finally decided to stay in the islands as a farmer. In 1697, to escape the bitter [[Sinophobia#Philippines|anti-Chinese prejudice]] that existed in the [[Philippines]], he converted to [[Catholicism]], changed his name to Domingo Mercado and married the daughter of Chinese friend Augustin Chin-co. On his mother's side, Rizal's ancestry included Chinese, Japanese and [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] blood. His mother's lineage can be traced to the affluent Florentina family of Chinese mestizo families originating in [[Baliuag, Bulacan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Project Gutenberg EBook of Lineage, Life and Labors of Jose Rizal: Philippine Patriot |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/6867/6867-h/6867-h.htm#d0e1535 |author=Austin Craig |website=www.gutenberg.org |date=January 8, 2005 |accessdate=July 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; José Rizal also had Spanish ancestry. His grandfather was a half Spaniard engineer named Lorenzo Alberto Alonzo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ourhappyschool.com/history/lola-lolay-bahay-na-bato|title=The Mercado – Rizal Family|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an early age, José showed a precocious intellect. He learned the alphabet from his mother at 3, and could read and write at age 5.&lt;ref name="asianhistory.about.com"/&gt; Upon enrolling at the [[Ateneo Municipal de Manila]], he dropped the last three names that made up his full name, on the advice of his brother, [[Paciano Rizal|Paciano]] and the Mercado family, thus rendering his name as "José Protasio&lt;!---Protacio is NOT CORRECT. DO NOT CHANGE. SEE SOURCE BELOW. Named after San Protasio (Saint Protasius/Protase)---&gt; Rizal". Of this, he later wrote: ''"My family never paid much attention [to our second surname Rizal], but now I had to use it, thus giving me the appearance of an illegitimate child!"''&lt;ref name="repositories.cdlib.org"&gt;Vicente L. Rafael [http://escholarship.org/uc/item/4j11p6c1 On Rizal's El Filibusterismo], University of Washington, Dept. of History.&lt;/ref&gt; This was to enable him to travel freely and disassociate him from his brother, who had gained notoriety with his earlier links to Filipino priests [[Mariano Gomez]], [[Jose Burgos]] and [[Jacinto Zamora]] (popularly known as [[Gomburza]]) who had been accused and executed for treason.

[[File:Calamba City, 003.jpg|thumbnail|left|Rizal's house in Calamba, Laguna.]]

Despite the name change, José, as "Rizal" soon distinguished himself in poetry writing contests, impressing his professors with his facility with Castilian and other foreign languages, and later, in writing essays that were critical of the Spanish historical accounts of the pre-colonial Philippine societies. Indeed, by 1891, the year he finished his ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'', this second surname had become so well known that, as he writes to another friend, ''"All my family now carry the name Rizal instead of Mercado because the name Rizal means persecution! Good! I too want to join them and be worthy of this family name..."''&lt;ref name="repositories.cdlib.org" /&gt;

==Education==
[[File:Rizal-11.jpg|thumb|left|Rizal, 11 years old, a student at the Ateneo Municipal de Manila]]

Rizal first studied under Justiniano Aquino Cruz in [[Biñan, Laguna]], before he was sent to [[Manila]].&lt;ref name=valdez2007p86&gt;{{harvnb|Valdez|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ixcoCv2o2NoC&amp;pg=PT86 77]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As to his father's request, he took the entrance examination in [[Colegio de San Juan de Letran]] but he then enrolled at the [[Ateneo de Manila University|Ateneo Municipal de Manila]] and graduated as one of the nine students in his class declared ''sobresaliente'' or outstanding. He continued his education at the [[Ateneo Municipal de Manila]] to obtain a land surveyor and assessor's degree, and at the same time at the [[University of Santo Tomas]] where he did take up a [[Pre-law|preparatory course in law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.varsitarian.net/news/special_news/20110618/jose_rizal_a_birthday_wish_list |title=Jose Rizal: A birthday wish list |author1=Parco de Castro |author2=M. E. G. |work=[[The Varsitarian]] |accessdate=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon learning that his mother was going blind, he decided to switch to medicine at the [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Medicine and Surgery|medical school]] of Santo Tomas specializing later in [[ophthalmology]].

[[File:Rizal-18.jpg|thumb|Rizal as a student at the [[University of Santo Tomas]]]]

Without his parents' knowledge and consent, but secretly supported by his brother [[Paciano Rizal|Paciano]], he traveled alone to [[Madrid, Spain]] in May 1882 and studied medicine at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|Universidad Central de Madrid]] where he earned the degree, ''[[Licentiate in Medicine and Surgery|Licentiate in Medicine]]''. He also attended medical lectures at the [[University of Paris]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]]. In [[Berlin]], he was inducted as a member of the Berlin Ethnological Society and the Berlin Anthropological Society under the patronage of the famous [[pathologist]] [[Rudolf Virchow]]. Following custom, he delivered an address in German in April 1887 before the Anthropological Society on the orthography and structure of the [[Tagalog language]]. He left [[Heidelberg, Germany|Heidelberg]] a poem, "A las flores del Heidelberg", which was both an evocation and a prayer for the welfare of his native land and the unification of common values between East and West.

At [[Heidelberg]], the 25-year-old Rizal, completed in 1887 his eye specialization under the renowned professor, [[Otto Heinrich Enoch Becker|Otto Becker]]. There he used the newly invented [[ophthalmoscope]] (invented by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]]) to later operate on his own mother's eye. From Heidelberg, Rizal wrote his parents: "I spend half of the day in the study of German and the other half, in the diseases of the eye. Twice a week, I go to the bierbrauerie, or beerhall, to speak German with my student friends." He lived in a Karlstraße boarding house then moved to Ludwigsplatz. There, he met Reverend Karl Ullmer and stayed with them in [[Wilhelmsfeld]], where he wrote the last few chapters of ''[[Noli Me Tángere (novel)|Noli Me Tángere]]''.

Rizal was a [[polymath]], skilled in both science and the arts. He painted, sketched, and made sculptures and woodcarving. He was a prolific poet, essayist, and novelist whose most famous works were his two novels, ''[[Noli Me Tángere (novel)|Noli Me Tángere]]'' and its sequel, ''[[El filibusterismo]]''.{{refn|His novel ''Noli'' was one of the first novels in Asia written outside Japan and China and was one of the first novels of anti-colonial rebellion. Read Benedict Anderson's commentary: [http://newleftreview.org/A2510].|group=note}} These social commentaries during the [[History of the Philippines (1521-1898)|Spanish colonization]] of the country formed the nucleus of literature that inspired peaceful reformists and armed revolutionaries alike. Rizal was also a [[list of polyglots#19th century|polyglot]], conversant in twenty-two languages.{{refn|He was conversant in Spanish, French, Latin, Greek, German, Portuguese, Italian, English, Dutch, and Japanese. Rizal also made translations from Arabic, Swedish, Russian, Chinese, Greek, Hebrew and [[Sanskrit]]. He translated the poetry of [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] into his native [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. In addition he had at least some knowledge of [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Chavacano]], [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]], [[Ilokano language|Ilocano]], and Subanun.|group=note}}{{refn|In his essay, "Reflections of a Filipino", (''La Solidaridad'', c.1888), he wrote: "Man is multiplied by the number of languages he possesses and speaks."|group=note}}&lt;ref name="Laubach"&gt;[[Frank Laubach]], ''Rizal: Man and Martyr'' (Manila: Community Publishers, 1936).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witmer, Christoper (June 2, 2001). [http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig/witmer1.html "Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not)"]. LewRockwell.com. Retrieved on September 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rizal's multifacetedness was described by his German friend, Dr. [[Adolf Bernhard Meyer]], as "stupendous."{{refn|[[Adolf Bernard Meyer]] (1840–1911) was a German ornithologist and anthropologist, and author of the book ''Philippinen-typen'' (Dresden, 1888)|group=note}} Documented studies show him to be a [[polymath]] with the ability to master various skills and subjects.&lt;ref name="Laubach" /&gt;&lt;ref name="joserizal1"&gt;[http://www.joserizal.ph/ch01.html The Many-Sided Personality].

Besides poetry and creative writing, he dabbled, with varying degrees of expertise, in architecture, [[cartography]], economics, [[ethnology]], [[anthropology]], sociology, [[dramatics]], martial arts, fencing and [[pistol shooting]]. He was also a [[Freemason]], joining Acacia Lodge No. 9 during his time in Spain and becoming a [[Master Mason]] in 1884.

==Personal life, relationships and ventures==
[[File:Rednaxela Terrace.jpg|thumb|Rednaxela Terrace, where Rizal lived during his self-imposed exile in Hong Kong (photo taken in 2011).]]

José Rizal's life is one of the most documented of 19th century Filipinos due to the vast and extensive records written by and about him.&lt;ref name="Rizalino"&gt;Kalaw, Teodoro."Epistolario Rizalino: 4 volumes, 1400 letters to and from Rizal". Bureau of Printing, Manila.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost everything in his short life is recorded somewhere, being himself a regular diarist and prolific letter writer, much of the material having survived. His biographers, however, have faced difficulty in translating his writings because of Rizal's habit of switching from one language to another.

They drew largely from his travel diaries with their insights of a young Asian encountering the West for the first time. They included his later trips, home and back again to Europe through Japan and the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Antonio T. Tiongson|author2=Edgardo V. Gutierrez|author3=Ricardo Valencia Gutierrez|author4=Ricardo V. Gutierrez|title=Positively No Filipinos Allowed: Building Communities and Discourse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y1YN11so7k4C&amp;pg=PA17|year=2006|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=978-1-59213-123-5|page=17}}&lt;br/&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joserizal.ph/tr30.html |title=Rizal in America |date=2004 |website= |publisher=Jose Rizal University |accessdate=December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, finally, through his self-imposed [[exile]] in Hong Kong.

Shortly after he graduated from the Ateneo Municipal de Manila (now [[Ateneo de Manila University]]), Rizal (who was then 16 years old) and a friend, Mariano Katigbak, came to visit Rizal's maternal grandmother in [[Tondo, Manila]]. Mariano brought along his sister, Segunda Katigbak, a 14-year-old Batangueña from [[Lipa, Batangas]]. It was the first time they met and Rizal described Segunda as "rather short, with eyes that were eloquent and ardent at times and languid at others, rosy–cheeked, with an enchanting and provocative smile that revealed very beautiful teeth, and the air of a sylph; her entire self diffused a mysterious charm." His grandmother's guests were mostly college students and they knew that Rizal had skills in painting. They suggested that Rizal should make a portrait of Segunda. He complied reluctantly and made a pencil sketch of her. Unfortunately for him, Katigbak was engaged to Manuel Luz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zaide|first=Gregorio|title=Rizal's Life, Works and Writings|year=1957|publisher=Villanueva Book Store|location=Manila, Philippines|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ophthalmologist Business Card of Doctor Jose Rizal from Hong Kong End of 19 Century.jpg|thumb|left|Business card shows Dr. José Rizal is an Ophthalmologist in Hong Kong]]

From December 1891 to June 1892, Rizal lived with his family in Number 2 of [[Rednaxela Terrace]], Mid-levels, Hong Kong Island. Rizal used 5 D'Aguilar Street, Central district, [[Hong Kong Island]], as his [[ophthalmologist]] clinic from 2&amp;nbsp;pm to 6&amp;nbsp;pm. This period of his life included his recorded affections of which nine were identified. They were Gertrude Beckett of Chalcot Crescent, [[Primrose Hill]], [[Camden Town|Camden]], [[London]], wealthy and high-minded Nelly Boustead of the English and [[Iberians|Iberian]] merchant family, last descendant of a noble Japanese family Seiko Usui (affectionately called O-Sei-san), his earlier friendship with Segunda Katigbak, Leonor Valenzuela, and eight-year romantic relationship with a distant cousin, [[Leonor Rivera]] (popularly thought to be the inspiration for the character of [[María Clara]] in ''[[Noli me tangere (novel)|Noli me tangere]]'').

===Affair===
In one recorded fall from grace he succumbed to the temptation of a '[[lady of the camellias]]'. The writer, [[Maximo Viola]], a friend of Rizal's, was alluding to [[Alexandre Dumas fils|Dumas]]'s 1848 novel, ''[[La Dame aux Camélias|La dame aux camelias]]'', about a man who fell in love with a [[courtesan]].

===Association with Leonor Rivera===
{{See also|Leonor Rivera}}
[[Image:Crayon sketch of Leonor Rivera by Rizal.jpg|thumb|A crayon portrait of Leonor Rivera by José Rizal]]

[[Leonor Rivera–Kipping|Leonor Rivera]] is thought to be the inspiration for the character of [[María Clara]] in ''Noli Me Tángere'' and ''El Filibusterismo''.&lt;ref name="inquirer"&gt;Martinez-Clemente, Jo (200-06-20) [http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/16626/keeping-up-with-legacy-of-rizal%E2%80%99s-%E2%80%98true-love%E2%80%99 Keeping up with legacy of Rizal’s ‘true love’] ''Inquirer Central Luzon'' at inquirer.net. Retrieved on December 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera and Rizal first met in Manila when Rivera was only 14 years old. When Rizal left for Europe on May 3, 1882, Rivera was 16 years of age. Their correspondence began when Rizal left a poem for Rivera saying farewell.&lt;ref name="JR" /&gt;

The correspondence between Rivera and Rizal kept him focused on his studies in Europe. They employed codes in their letters because Rivera's mother did not favor Rizal. A letter from Mariano Katigbak dated June 27, 1884, referred to Rivera as Rizal's "betrothed". Katigbak described Rivera as having been greatly affected by Rizal's departure, frequently sick because of [[insomnia]].

When Rizal returned to the Philippines on August 5, 1887, Rivera and her family had moved back to [[Dagupan, Pangasinan]]. Rizal was forbidden by his father Francisco Mercado to see Rivera in order to avoid putting the Rivera family in danger because at the time Rizal was already labeled by the ''criollo'' elite as a ''filibustero'' or [[subversive]]&lt;ref name="JR" /&gt; because of his novel ''Noli Me Tángere''. Rizal wanted to marry Rivera while he was still in the Philippines because of Rivera's uncomplaining fidelity. Rizal asked permission from his father one more time before his second departure from the Philippines. The meeting never happened. In 1888, Rizal stopped receiving letters from Rivera for a year, although Rizal kept sending letters to Rivera. The reason for Rivera's year of silence was the connivance between Rivera's mother and the Englishman named Henry Kipping, a [[civil engineer|railway engineer]] who fell in love with Rivera and was favored by Rivera's mother.&lt;ref name="JR"&gt;[http://www.joserizal.ph/lv01.html Leonor Rivera], José Rizal University, joserizal.ph&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Coates"&gt;Coates, Austin. "Leonor Rivera", ''[[Rizal: Philippine Nationalist and Martyr]]'', Oxford University Press (Hong Kong), pp. 52–54, 60, 84, 124, 134–136, 143, 169, 185–188, 258.&lt;/ref&gt; The news of Leonor Rivera's marriage to Kipping devastated Rizal.

His European friends kept almost everything he gave them, including doodlings on pieces of paper. In the home of a Spanish liberal, Pedro Ortiga y Pérez, he left an impression that was to be remembered by his daughter, Consuelo. In her diary, she wrote of a day Rizal spent there and regaled them with his wit, social graces, and sleight-of-hand tricks. In London, during his research on [[Antonio de Morga]]'s writings, he became a regular guest in the home of [[Reinhold Rost]] of the [[British Museum]] who referred to him as "a gem of a man."&lt;ref name="Rizalino" /&gt;{{refn|Dr. Reinhold Rost was the head of the India Office at the British Museum and a renowned 19th century philologist.|group=note}} The family of Karl Ullmer, pastor of [[:de:Wilhelmsfeld|Wilhelmsfeld]], and the Blumentritts saved even buttonholes and napkins with sketches and notes. They were ultimately bequeathed to the Rizal family to form a treasure trove of memorabilia.

[[File:Josephine Bracken BR.jpg|thumb|upright|Josephine Bracken was Rizal's [[common-law marriage|common-law]] wife whom he reportedly married shortly before his execution]]

===Relationship with Josephine Bracken===
{{Further|Josephine Bracken}}

In February 1895, Rizal, 33, met [[Josephine Bracken]], an Irish woman from [[Hong Kong]], when she accompanied her blind adoptive father, George Taufer, to have his eyes checked by Rizal.&lt;ref&gt;Fadul 2008, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; After frequent visits, Rizal and Bracken fell in love with each other. They applied to marry but, because of Rizal's reputation from his writings and political stance, the local priest Father Obach would only hold the ceremony if Rizal could get permission from the Bishop of [[Cebu City|Cebu]]. He was unable to obtain an ecclesiastical marriage because he would not return to Catholicism.&lt;!-- was this because of his Freemasonry ties or his politics? AllanBz --the answer is both-KaElin--&gt;&lt;ref name="spouse"&gt;Fadul 2008, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

After accompanying her father to Manila on her return to Hong Kong, and before heading back to [[Dapitan]] to live with Rizal, Josephine introduced herself to members of Rizal's family in Manila. His mother suggested a [[civil marriage]], which she believed to be a lesser sacrament but less sinful to Rizal's conscience than making any sort of political retraction in order to gain permission from the Bishop.&lt;ref name="Craig215"&gt;Craig 1914, p. 215.&lt;/ref&gt; Rizal and Josephine lived as husband and wife in a common-law marriage in [[Talisay, Zamboanga del Norte|Talisay]] in [[Dapitan]]. The couple had a son who lived only for a few hours after Josephine suffered a miscarriage; Rizal named him after his father Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;Fadul 2008, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Brussels and Spain (1890–92)==
In 1890, Rizal, 29, left Paris for [[Brussels]] as he was preparing for the publication of his annotations of [[Antonio de Morga]]'s ''Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas'' (1609). He lived in the boarding house of the two Jacoby sisters, Catherina and Suzanna, who had a niece Suzanna ("Thil"), age 16. Historian [[Gregorio F. Zaide]] states that Rizal had "his romance with Suzanne Jacoby, 45, the petite niece of his landladies." Belgian Pros Slachmuylders, however, believed that Rizal had a romance with the 17-year-old niece, Suzanna Thil, as his other liaisons were all with young women.&lt;ref name="Suzanne"&gt;Cuizon, Ahmed (June 21, 2008). [http://globalnation.inquirer.net/cebudailynews/news/view/20080621-143971/Rizals-affair-with-la-petite-Suzanne "Rizal’s affair with 'la petite Suzanne'"], ''Inquirer/Cebu Daily'', Retrieved on September 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He found records clarifying their names and ages.

Rizal's Brussels stay was short-lived; he moved to Madrid, giving the young Suzanna a box of chocolates. She wrote to him in French: "After your departure, I did not take the chocolate. The box is still intact as on the day of your parting. Don’t delay too long writing us because I wear out the soles of my shoes for running to the mailbox to see if there is a letter from you. There will never be any home in which you are so loved as in that in Brussels, so, you little bad boy, hurry up and come back…"&lt;ref name="Suzanne"/&gt; In 2007, Slachmuylders' group arranged for an historical marker honoring Rizal to be placed at the house.&lt;ref name="Suzanne" /&gt;

The content of Rizal's writings changed considerably in his two most famous novels, ''[[Noli Me Tángere (novel)|Noli Me Tángere]]'', published in Berlin in 1887, and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'', published in Ghent in 1891. For the latter, he used funds borrowed from his friends. These writings angered both the Spanish colonial elite and many educated Filipinos due to their symbolism. They are critical of Spanish friars and the power of the Church. Rizal's friend [[Ferdinand Blumentritt]], an [[Austria-Hungary]]-born professor and historian, wrote that the novel's characters were drawn from real life and that every episode can be repeated on any day in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harry Sichrovsky|title=Ferdinand Blumentritt: an Austrian life for the Philippines : The Story of José Rizal's Closest Friend and Companion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-yBFKQAACAAJ|year=1987|isbn=978-971-13-6024-5|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blumentritt was the grandson of the Imperial Treasurer at [[Vienna]] in the former [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and a staunch defender of the Catholic faith. This did not dissuade him from writing the preface of ''El filibusterismo'' after he had translated ''Noli Me Tángere'' into German. As Blumentritt had warned, these books resulted in Rizal's being prosecuted as the inciter of revolution. He was eventually tried by the military, convicted and executed. Teaching the natives where they stood brought about an adverse reaction, as the [[Philippine Revolution]] of 1896 took off virulently thereafter.

[[File:Filipino Ilustrados Jose Rizal Marcelo del Pilar Mariano Ponce.jpg|thumb|Leaders of the reform movement in Spain: Left to right: Rizal, del Pilar, and Ponce (c. 1890).]]

As leader of the reform movement of Filipino students in Spain, Rizal contributed essays, [[allegories]], poems, and [[editorials]] to the Spanish newspaper ''[[La Solidaridad]]'' in Barcelona (in this case Rizal used a pen name, "Dimasalang", "Laong Laan" and "May Pagasa"). The core of his writings centers on liberal and progressive ideas of individual rights and freedom; specifically, rights for the Filipino people. He shared the same sentiments with members of the movement: that the Philippines is battling, in Rizal's own words, "a double-faced Goliath"—corrupt friars and bad government. His commentaries reiterate the following agenda:{{refn|In his letter "Manifesto to Certain Filipinos" (Manila, 1896), he states: ''Reforms, if they are to bear fruit, must come from above; for reforms that come from below are upheavals both violent and transitory.''(''Epistolario Rizalino'', op cit)|group=note}}

*That the Philippines be made a province of Spain (''The Philippines was a province of [[New Spain]] – now Mexico, administered from Mexico city from 1565 to 1821. From 1821 to 1898 it was administered directly from Spain.'')
*Representation in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]]
*Filipino priests instead of Spanish friars – [[Augustinians]], [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], and [[Franciscans]] – in parishes and remote ''sitios''
*Freedom of assembly and speech
*Equal rights before the law (for both Filipino and Spanish plaintiffs)

The colonial authorities in the Philippines did not favor these reforms. Such Spanish intellectuals as Morayta, [[Miguel de Unamuno|Unamuno]], [[Francisco Pi y Margall|Pi y Margall]], and others did endorse them.

[[Wenceslao Retana]], a political commentator in Spain, had slighted Rizal by writing an insulting article in ''La Epoca'', a newspaper in Madrid. He implied that the family and friends of Rizal were evicted from their lands in Calamba for not having paid their due rents. The incident (when Rizal was ten) stemmed from an accusation that Rizal's mother[[Teodora Alonso Realonda|, Teodora]], tried to poison the wife of a cousin, but she said she was trying to help. With the approval of the Church prelates, and without a hearing, she was ordered to prison in [[Santa Cruz, Laguna|Santa Cruz]] in 1871. She was made to walk the ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) from Calamba. She was released after two-and-a-half years of appeals to the highest court.&lt;ref name="Craig" /&gt; In 1887, Rizal wrote a petition on behalf of the tenants of Calamba, and later that year led them to speak out against the friars' attempts to raise rent. They initiated a litigation which resulted in the Dominicans' evicting them from their homes, including the Rizal family. General [[Valeriano Weyler]] had the buildings on the farm torn down.

Upon reading the article, Rizal sent a representative to challenge Retana to a duel. Retana published a public apology and later became one of Rizal's biggest admirers, writing Rizal's most important biography, ''Vida y Escritos del José Rizal''.&lt;ref&gt;Retana, Wenceslao.

==Return to Philippines (1892–96)==

===Exile in Dapitan===
[[File:Bust of Padre Guerrico, modelled by Rizal.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of Padre Guerrico in clay, by Rizal.]]
[[File:Sketch of blumentritt by rizal.jpg|thumb|upright|Rizal's pencil sketch of Blumentritt.]]
Upon his return to Manila in 1892, he formed a civic movement called ''[[La Liga Filipina]]''. The league advocated these moderate social reforms through legal means, but was disbanded by the governor. At that time, he had already been declared an enemy of the state by the Spanish authorities because of the publication of his novel.

Rizal was implicated in the activities of the nascent rebellion and in July 1892, was deported to [[Dapitan]] in the province of [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga]], a peninsula of [[Mindanao]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filipiniana.net/ArtifactView.do?artifactID=R2009LMC0093 "Appendix II: Decree Banishing Rizal.

(Manila: National Historical Institute.)&lt;/ref&gt; There he built a school, a hospital and a water supply system, and taught and engaged in farming and horticulture.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} ''[[Abaca]]'', then the vital raw material for cordage and which Rizal and his students planted in the thousands, was a memorial.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In Dapitan, the Jesuits mounted a great effort to secure his return to the fold led by Fray Francisco de Paula Sánchez, his former professor, who failed in his mission. The task was resumed by Fray [[:ca:Pau Pastells i Vila|Pastells]], a prominent member of the Order. In a letter to Pastells, Rizal sails close to the [[deism]] familiar to us today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bonoan|first=Raul J.|date=1992|title=The Enlightenment, Deism, and Rizal|journal=Philippine Studies|volume=40|issue=1|pages=53–67|jstor=42633293}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.studymode.com/essays/Rizal-As-a-Deist-375373.html|title=Rizal as a Deist Research Paper - 1191 Words|author=|date=|website=studymode.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Raul J. Bonoan, S.J., ''The Rizal-Pastells Correspondence'' (Manila: Ateneo de Manila University Press, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We are entirely in accord in admitting the existence of God. How can I doubt His when I am convinced of mine. Who so recognizes the effect recognizes the cause. To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, it would be to doubt everything; and then what is life for? Now then, my [[faith]] in God, if the result of a ratiocination may be called faith, is blind, blind in the sense of knowing nothing. I neither believe nor disbelieve the qualities which many attribute to Him; before theologians' and philosophers' definitions and lucubrations of this ineffable and inscrutable being I find myself smiling. Faced with the conviction of seeing myself confronting the supreme Problem, which confused voices seek to explain to me, I cannot but reply: ‘It could be’; but the God that I foreknow is far more grand, far more good: ''Plus Supra!''...I believe in (revelation); but not in revelation or revelations which each religion or religions claim to possess. Examining them impartially, comparing them and scrutinizing them, one cannot avoid discerning the human 'fingernail' and the stamp of the time in which they were written... No, let us not make God in our image, poor inhabitants that we are of a distant planet lost in infinite space. However, brilliant and sublime our intelligence may be, it is scarcely more than a small spark which shines and in an instant is extinguished, and it alone can give us no idea of that blaze, that conflagration, that ocean of light. I believe in revelation, but in that living revelation which surrounds us on every side, in that voice, mighty, eternal, unceasing, incorruptible, clear, distinct, universal as is the being from whom it proceeds, in that revelation which speaks to us and penetrates us from the moment we are born until we die. What books can better reveal to us the goodness of God, His love, His providence, His eternity, His glory, His wisdom? ‘The heavens declare the glory of God, and the firmament showeth his handiwork.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;''Epistolario Rizalino: 4 volumes, 1400 letters to and from Rizal'', edited by Teodoro Kalaw (Manila: Bureau of Printing, 1930–38)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
His best friend, professor [[Ferdinand Blumentritt]], kept him in touch with European friends and fellow-scientists who wrote a stream of letters which arrived in Dutch, French, German and English and which baffled the censors, delaying their transmittal. Those four years of his [[exile]] coincided with the development of the [[Philippine Revolution]] from inception and to its final breakout, which, from the viewpoint of the court which was to try him, suggested his complicity in it.&lt;ref name="Rizalino" /&gt; He condemned the uprising, although all the members of the ''[[Katipunan]]'' had made him their honorary president and had used his name as a cry for war, unity, and liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://definitelyfilipino.com/blog/2012/07/29/rizalismo-isang-sanaysay/|title=Rizalismo (isang sanaysay)|work=Definitely Filipino™}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is known to making the resolution of bearing personal sacrifice instead of the incoming revolution, believing that a peaceful stand is the best way to avoid further suffering in the country and loss of Filipino lives. In Rizal's own words, "''I consider myself happy for being able to suffer a little for a cause which I believe to be sacred [...]. I believe further that in any undertaking, the more one suffers for it, the surer its success. If this be fanaticism may God pardon me, but my poor judgment does not see it as such.''"&lt;ref name="Dapitan"&gt;Rizal, Dapitan, September 1, 1892. In Raul J. Bonoan, The Rizal-Pastells Correspondence. Manila: Ateneo de Manila University Press, 1994, 86s.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dapitan, Rizal wrote "Haec Est Sibylla Cumana", a parlor-game for his students, with questions and answers for which a wooden top was used. In 2004, Jean Paul Verstraeten traced this book and the wooden top, as well as Rizal's personal watch, spoon and salter.

===Arrest and trial===
By 1896, the rebellion fomented by the ''[[Katipunan]]'', a militant secret society, had become a [[Philippine Revolution|full-blown revolution]], proving to be a nationwide uprising.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} Rizal had earlier volunteered his services as a doctor in Cuba and was given leave by Governor-General [[Ramón Blanco y Erenas|Ramón Blanco]] to serve in Cuba to minister to victims of [[yellow fever]]. Rizal and Josephine left Dapitan on August 1, 1896, with letter of recommendation from Blanco.
&lt;!--Rizal had predicted that the United States was going to be a "troublesome rival" if his prophecy that the "Great American Republic, whose interests lie in the Pacific, will someday dream of possessing the Philippines" will ever come true. During his only visit to the United States in 1888, Rizal described the USA: “I visited the largest cities of America with their big buildings, electric lights, and magnificent conceptions. Undoubtedly America is a great country, but it still has many defects. There is no real civil liberty." He was quarantined in San Francisco's pier as a result of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] and witnessed the inequality experienced by African Americans and people of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dr. Jose Rizal—the first Filipino TNT in America? |author=Rodel Rodis |url=http://globalnation.inquirer.net/4212/dr-jose-rizal%E2%80%94the-first-filipino-tnt-in-america |newspaper=Global Nation |date=June 15, 2011 |accessdate=June 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rizal knew, that if ever the Philippines came under American rule racism would be a major concern.  It was likewise important that for the revolution to succeed there must be a foreign ally that will provide the revolution (which he considered as a last resort) arms, food, ammunition and diplomacy. José Rizal was elected honorary president by the ''Katipunan'' without his knowledge and his name would be used by the revolutionaries in their battlecry.--&gt;

Rizal was arrested en route to Cuba via Spain and was imprisoned in [[Barcelona]] on October 6, 1896. He was sent back the same day to Manila to stand trial as he was implicated in the revolution through his association with members of the ''Katipunan''. During the entire passage, he was unchained, no Spaniard laid a hand on him, and had many opportunities to escape but refused to do so.

While imprisoned in [[Fort Santiago]], he issued a [[manifesto]] disavowing the current revolution in its present state and declaring that the education of Filipinos and their achievement of a national identity were prerequisites to freedom.

Rizal was tried before a [[court-martial]] for [[rebellion]], [[sedition]], and [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], was convicted on all three charges, and sentenced to death. Blanco, who was sympathetic to Rizal, had been forced out of office. The friars, led by then Archbishop of Manila Bernardino Nozaleda, had 'intercalated' [[Camilo de Polavieja]] in his stead, as the new Spanish [[Governor-General of the Philippines]] after pressuring Queen-Regent [[Maria Cristina of Spain]], thus sealing Rizal's fate.

==Execution==
[[File:Rizal execution.jpg|350px|thumb|A photographic record of Rizal's execution in what was then [[Rizal Park|Bagumbayan]].]]

Moments before his execution on December 30, 1896, by a squad of Filipino soldiers of the Spanish Army, a backup force of regular Spanish Army troops stood ready to shoot the executioners should they fail to obey orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Charles Edward |last2=Rodriguez|first2=Eulogio Balan |title=The hero of the Filipinos: the story of José Rizal, poet, patriot and martyr|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BgsvAAAAIAAJ|year=1923|publisher=The Century co.|page=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish Army Surgeon General requested to take his pulse: it was normal. Aware of this the sergeant commanding the backup force hushed his men to silence when they began raising "vivas" with the highly partisan crowd of Peninsular and Mestizo Spaniards. His [[last words]] were those of [[Seven Last Words|Jesus Christ]]: "''consummatum est''", – ''it is finished.''&lt;ref name="Laubach" /&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[Austin Coates]], ''Rizal: Philippine Nationalist and Martyr'' (London: Oxford University Press, 1968) {{ISBN|0-19-581519-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Rizal's trial was regarded a travesty even by prominent Spaniards of his day. Soon after his execution, the philosopher [[Miguel de Unamuno]] in an impassioned utterance recognized Rizal as a "Spaniard", "...profoundly and intimately Spanish, far more Spanish than those wretched men—forgive them, Lord, for they knew not what they did—those wretched men, who over his still warm body hurled like an insult heavenward that blasphemous cry, 'Viva Espana!'"Miguel de Unamuno, epilogue to Wenceslao Retana's ''Vida y Escritos del Dr. José Rizal''.(Retana, op. cit.)|group=note}}

He was secretly buried in [[Paco, Manila|Pacò]] Cemetery in Manila with no identification on his grave. His sister Narcisa toured all possible gravesites and found freshly turned earth at the cemetery with guards posted at the gate. Assuming this could be the most likely spot, there never having any ground burials, she made a gift to the caretaker to mark the site "RPJ", Rizal's initials in reverse.

His undated poem ''[[Mi último adiós]]'', believed to have been written a few days before his execution, was hidden in an alcohol stove, which was later handed to his family with his few remaining possessions, including the final letters and his last bequests.&lt;ref name=Alvarez&gt;Alvarez, S.V., 1992, Recalling the Revolution, Madison: Center for Southeast Asia Studies, University of Wisconsin-Madison, {{ISBN|1-881261-05-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|91}} During their visit, Rizal reminded his sisters in English, "''There is something inside it''", referring to the alcohol stove given by the Pardo de Taveras which was to be returned after his execution, thereby emphasizing the importance of the poem. This instruction was followed by another, "''Look in my shoes''", in which another item was secreted. Exhumation of his remains in August 1898, under American rule, revealed he had been uncoffined, his burial not on sanctified ground granted the 'confessed' faithful, and whatever was in his shoes had disintegrated. And now he is buried in Rizal Monument in Manila.&lt;ref name="Craig" /&gt;

In his letter to his family he wrote: ''"Treat our aged parents as you would wish to be treated...Love them greatly in memory of me...December 30, 1896."&lt;ref name="Rizalino" /&gt; He gave his family instructions for his burial: "Bury me in the ground. Place a stone and a cross over it. My name, the date of my birth and of my death. Nothing more. If later you wish to surround my grave with a fence, you can do it. No anniversaries''."&lt;ref&gt;[http://joserizal.info/Writings/Letters/Family/1896-f-letters.htm "Letters Between Rizal and his Family, #223"].  The Life and Writings of José Rizal. Retrieved on September 29, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final letter, to Blumentritt – ''Tomorrow at 7, I shall be shot; but I am innocent of the crime of rebellion. I am going to die with a tranquil conscience.''&lt;ref name="Rizalino" /&gt; Rizal is believed to be the first Filipino revolutionary whose death is attributed entirely to his work as a writer; and through dissent and [[civil disobedience]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; enabled him to successfully destroy Spain's moral primacy to rule. He also bequeathed a book personally bound by him in Dapitan to his 'best and dearest friend.' When Blumentritt received it in his hometown [[Litoměřice]] (Leitmeritz) he broke down and wept.

==Works and writings==
Rizal wrote mostly in Spanish, the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish Philippines]], though some of his letters (for example ''[[Mga Kababayang Dalaga ng Malolos|Sa Mga Kababaihang Taga Malolos]]'') were written in Tagalog. His works have since been translated into a number of languages including Tagalog and English.

===Other works===
Rizal also tried his hand at painting and sculpture. His most famous sculptural work was "[[The Triumph of Science over Death]]", a clay sculpture of a naked young woman with overflowing hair, standing on a skull while bearing a torch held high. The woman symbolized the ignorance of humankind during the Dark Ages, while the torch she bore symbolized the enlightenment science brings over the whole world. He sent the sculpture as a gift to his dear friend Ferdinand Blumentritt, together with another one named "The Triumph of Death over Life".

The woman is shown trampling the skull, a symbol of death, to signify the victory the humankind achieved by conquering the bane of death through their scientific advancements. The original sculpture is now displayed at the Rizal Shrine Museum at Fort Santiago in Intramuros, Manila. A large replica, made of concrete, stands in front of Fernando Calderón Hall, the building which houses the College of Medicine of the University of the Philippines Manila along Pedro Gil Street in Ermita, Manila.

===Retraction controversy===
Several historians report that Rizal retracted his anti-Catholic ideas through a document which stated: ''"I retract with all my heart whatever in my words, writings, publications and conduct have been contrary to my character as a son of the Catholic Church.''"{{refn|''Me retracto de todo corazon de cuanto en mis palabras, escritos, impresos y conducta ha habido contrario á mi cualidad de hijo de la Iglesia Católica'': Jesus Cavanna, ''Rizal's Unfading Glory: A Documentary History of the Conversion of Dr. José Rizal'' (Manila: 1983) |group=note}} However, there are doubts of its authenticity given that there is no certificate{{clarify|date=September 2018|reason=What does marriage certificate have to do with retraction authencity?}} of Rizal's Catholic marriage to Josephine Bracken.&lt;ref name="Pascual"&gt;Ricardo Roque Pascual, ''José Rizal Beyond the Grave'' (Manila: P. Ayuda &amp; Co., 1962)&lt;/ref&gt; Also there is an allegation that the retraction document was a forgery.&lt;ref&gt;Ildefonso T. Runes and Mameto R. Buenafe, The Forgery of the Rizal "Retraction" and Josephine's "Autobiography" (Manila: BR Book Col, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

After analyzing six major documents of Rizal, Ricardo Pascual concluded that the retraction document, said to have been discovered in 1935, was not in Rizal's handwriting. Senator [[Rafael Palma]], a former President of the [[University of the Philippines]] and a prominent [[Freemasonry|Mason]], argued that a retraction is not in keeping with Rizal's character and mature beliefs.&lt;ref name="EH"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://joserizal.info/Reflections/retraction.htm| work=Life and Writings of José Rizal| title=Rizal's Retraction: A Note on the Debate, Silliman Journal (Vol. 12, No. 2, April, May, June 1965), pages 168–183| accessdate=September 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called the retraction story a "pious fraud."&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palma, Pride of the Malay Race (New York: Prentice Hall, 1949)&lt;/ref&gt; Others who deny the retraction are [[Frank Laubach]],&lt;ref name="Laubach" /&gt; a Protestant minister; [[Austin Coates]],&lt;ref name="Coates" /&gt; a British writer; and [[Ricardo Manapat]], director of the National Archives.&lt;ref name="AO"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Ambeth Ocampo| title=Rizal Without the Overcoat| year=2008| publisher=Anvil Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who affirm the authenticity of Rizal's retraction are prominent Philippine historians such as [[Nick Joaquin]],{{refn|Joaquin, Nick, Rizal in Saga, Philippine National Centennial Commission, 1996:""It seems clear now that he did retract, that he went to confession, heard mass, received communion, and was married to Josephine, on the eve of his death".|group=note}} [[Nicolas Zafra]] of [[University of the Philippines|UP]]&lt;ref name="NZ"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Nicolas Zafra| title=Historicity of Rizal's Retraction| year=1961| publisher=Bookmark}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[León María Guerrero III]],{{refn|"That is a matter for handwriting experts, and the weight of expert opinion is in favor of authenticity.

"The First Filipino: A Biography of José Rizal". National Historical Institute of The Philippines, Manila.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} [[Gregorio Zaide]],&lt;ref name="GZ"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Gregorio Zaide| title=Jose Rizal: Life, Works and Writings of a Genius, Writer, Scientist and National Hero| year=2003| publisher=National Bookstore}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guillermo Gómez Rivera]], [[Ambeth Ocampo]],&lt;ref name="AO" /&gt; John Schumacher,&lt;ref&gt;Schumacher, John.

Ediciones de Cultura Hispánica, Madrid.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Dumol]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mariaronabeltran.com/2011/09/uncovering-controversial-facts-about.html "Uncovering Controversial Facts about José Rizal"] (mariaronabeltran.com)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Austin Craig]].&lt;ref name="Craig" /&gt; They take the retraction document as authentic, having been judged as such by a foremost expert on the writings of Rizal, [[Teodoro Kalaw]] (a 33rd degree Mason) and "handwriting experts...known and recognized in our courts of justice", [[Henry Otley Beyer|H. Otley Beyer]] and Dr. José I. Del Rosario, both of UP.&lt;ref name="NZ" /&gt;

Historians also refer to 11 eyewitnesses when Rizal wrote his retraction, signed a Catholic prayer book, and recited Catholic prayers, and the multitude who saw him kiss the [[crucifix]] before his execution. A great grand nephew of Rizal, Fr. [[Marciano Guzman]], cites that Rizal's 4 [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|confessions]] were [[certify|certified]] by 5 eyewitnesses, 10 qualified witnesses, 7 newspapers, and 12 historians and writers including Aglipayan bishops, Masons and anti-clericals.&lt;ref name="MG"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Marciano Guzman| url=http://www.bukal.com/pdfs/rizals%20conversion-pp.rtf| title=The Hard Facts About Rizal's Conversion| year=1988| publisher=Sinagtala Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt; One witness was the head of the Spanish [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] at the time of his notarized declaration and was highly esteemed by Rizal for his integrity.&lt;ref name="Cav"&gt;{{Cite book| author=Jesus Cavanna| title=Rizal's Unfading Glory: A Documentary History of the Conversion of Dr. Jose Rizal| year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of what he sees as the strength these [[direct evidence]] have in the light of the [[historical method]], in contrast with merely [[circumstantial evidence]], UP professor [[emeritus]] of history Nicolas Zafra called the retraction "a plain unadorned fact of history."&lt;ref name="NZ" /&gt; Guzmán attributes the denial of retraction to "the blatant disbelief and stubbornness" of some Masons.&lt;ref name="MG" /&gt; To explain the retraction Guzman said that the factors are the long discussion and debate which appealed to reason and logic that he had with Fr. Balaguer, the visits of his mentors and friends from the Ateneo, and the grace of God due the numerous prayers of religious communities.&lt;ref name="MG" /&gt;

Supporters see in the retraction Rizal's "moral courage...to recognize his mistakes,"&lt;ref name="GZ" /&gt;{{refn|The retraction, Javier de Pedro contends, is the end of a process which started with a personal crisis as Rizal finished the ''Fili''.&lt;ref&gt;Javier de Pedro (2005) [http://crcpublications.wordpress.com/book-titles/rizal-through-a-glass-darkly/ Rizal Through a Glass Darkly], University of Asia and the Pacific&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://202.138.141.8/pdfs/rizals%20religious%20thought-pp.rtf "Evolution of Rizal's Religious Thought"].&lt;/ref&gt;|group=note}} his [[Deathbed conversion|reversion]] to the "true faith", and thus his "unfading glory,"&lt;ref name="Cav" /&gt; and a return to the "ideals of his fathers" which "did not diminish his stature as a great patriot; on the contrary, it increased that stature to greatness."&lt;ref&gt;(1950-01-06).

Retrieved on September 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, senator [[Jose Diokno]] stated, "Surely whether Rizal died as a Catholic or an apostate adds or detracts nothing from his greatness as a Filipino... Catholic or Mason, Rizal is still Rizal – the hero who courted death 'to prove to those who deny our patriotism that we know how to die for our duty and our beliefs'."&lt;ref&gt;Garcia, Ricardo P. (1964). "''The Great Debate: The Rizal Retraction'' – Preface".  R.P. Garcia Publishing Co., Quezon City.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Mi último adiós"===
{{Main article|Mi último adiós}}

The poem is more aptly titled, "'''''Adiós, Patria Adorada'''''" (literally "''Farewell, Beloved Fatherland''"), by virtue of logic and literary tradition, the words coming from the first line of the poem itself. It first appeared in print not in Manila but in Hong Kong in 1897, when a copy of the poem and an accompanying photograph came to J. P. Braga who decided to publish it in a monthly journal he edited. There was a delay when Braga, who greatly admired Rizal, wanted a good job of the photograph and sent it to be engraved in London, a process taking well over two months. It finally appeared under 'Mi último pensamiento,' a title he supplied and by which it was known for a few years. Thus, when the [[Jesuit]] Balaguer's anonymous account of the retraction and the marriage to Josephine was appearing in Barcelona, no word of the poem's existence reached him in time to revise what he had written. His account was too elaborate that Rizal would have had no time to write "Adiós."

Six years after his death, when the [[Jones Law (Philippines)|Philippine Organic Act]] of 1902 was being debated in the United States Congress, Representative Henry Cooper of Wisconsin rendered an English translation of Rizal's valedictory poem capped by the peroration, "Under what clime or what skies has tyranny claimed a nobler victim?"&lt;ref&gt;Esteban de Ocampo, "Why is Rizal the Greatest Filipino Hero?" National Historical Institute. {{ISBN|971-538-053-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the US Congress passed the bill into law which is now known as the Philippine Organic Act of 1902.&lt;ref name="Pacis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Pacis |first=Vicente Albano |title=RIZAL IN THE AMERICAN CONGRESS |url=http://philippinesfreepress.wordpress.com/2005/12/28/rizal-in-the-american-congress-december-27-1952/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060504005030/http://philippinesfreepress.wordpress.com/2005/12/28/rizal-in-the-american-congress-december-27-1952/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 4, 2006 |work=The Philippines Free Press Online |date=December 27, 1952 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a major breakthrough for a US Congress that had yet to grant equal rights to African Americans guaranteed to them in the [[US Constitution]] and the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] was still in effect. It created the Philippine legislature, appointed two Filipino delegates to the US Congress, extended the US Bill of Rights to Filipinos, and laid the foundation for an autonomous government. The colony was on its way to independence.&lt;ref name="Pacis" /&gt; The Americans, however, would not sign the bill into law until 1916 and did not recognize Philippine Independence until the [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Treaty of Manila]] in 1946—fifty years after Rizal's death.This same poem which has inspired independence activists across the region and beyond was recited (in its [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] translation by [[Rosihan Anwar]]) by Indonesian soldiers of independence before going into battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mi Ultimo Adios by Jose Rizal|url=http://www.palhbooks.com/rizal.htm|publisher=Philippine American Literary House|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828090056/http://www.palhbooks.com/rizal.htm|archivedate=August 28, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later life of Bracken===
Josephine Bracken, whom Rizal addressed as his wife on his last day,&lt;ref&gt;Craig 1914, p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; promptly joined the [[Philippine Revolution|revolutionary]] forces in [[Cavite]] province, making her way through thicket and mud across enemy lines, and helped reloading spent cartridges at the arsenal in [[Imus, Cavite|Imus]] under the revolutionary General Pantaleón García. Imus came under threat of recapture that the operation was moved, with Bracken, to [[Maragondon, Cavite|Maragondon]], the mountain redoubt in Cavite.&lt;ref name="Fadul 2008, pg. 18"&gt;Fadul 2008, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

She witnessed the [[Tejeros Convention]] prior to returning to Manila and was summoned by the [[Governor-General]], but owing to her stepfather's American citizenship she could not be forcibly deported. She left voluntarily returning to Hong Kong. She later married another Filipino, Vicente Abad, a [[mestizo]] acting as agent for the [[Tabacalera]] firm in the Philippines. She died of [[tuberculosis]] in Hong Kong in March 15, 1902, and was buried at the Happy Valley Cemetery.&lt;ref name="Fadul 2008, pg. 18" /&gt; She was immortalized by Rizal in the last stanza of [[Mi Ultimo Adios]]: "''Farewell, sweet stranger, my friend, my joy...''".

===Polavieja and Blanco===
Polavieja faced condemnation by his countrymen after his return to Spain. While visiting [[Girona]], in [[Catalonia]], circulars were distributed among the crowd bearing Rizal's last verses, his portrait, and the charge that Polavieja was responsible for the loss of the Philippines to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Craig 1914, pp. 259–260.&lt;/ref&gt; Ramon Blanco later presented his sash and sword to the Rizal family as an apology.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Criticism and controversies==
Attempts to debunk legends surrounding Rizal, and the tug of war between free thinker and Catholic, have kept his legacy controversial.

===National hero status===
The confusion over Rizal's real stance on the Philippine Revolution leads to the sometimes bitter question of his ranking as the nation's premier hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ocampo|first=Ambeth|title=Rizal without the overcoat|year=1990|publisher=Anvil Publishing|location=Manila|isbn=978-971-27-0920-3|url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/155795.Rizal_Without_the_Overcoat}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Almario|first=Manuel|title=Commentary, Rizal: ‘Amboy’ or home-made hero?|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/120015/rizal-%E2%80%98amboy%E2%80%99-or-home-made-hero|accessdate=September 3, 2013|newspaper=The Philippine Inquirer|date=December 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; But then again, according to the National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP) Section Chief Teodoro Atienza, and Filipino historian [[Ambeth Ocampo]], there is no Filipino historical figure, including Rizal, that was officially declared as national hero through law or executive order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/culture-profile/culture-profile-phil-fast-facts.php |title=Philippine Fast Facts |accessdate=March 10, 2009 |publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206161803/http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/culture-profile/culture-profile-phil-fast-facts.php |archivedate=December 6, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="natheroes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncca.gov.ph/about-culture-and-arts/culture-profile/culture-profile-nationalhero.php |title=Selection and Proclamation of National Heroes and Laws Honoring Filipino Historical Figures |accessdate=March 10, 2009 |publisher=National Commission for Culture and the Arts }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although, there were laws and proclamations honoring Filipino heroes.

====Made national hero by colonial Americans====
Some{{who|date=September 2015}} suggest that Jose Rizal was made a legislated national hero by the American forces occupying Philippines. In 1901, the American Governor General [[William Howard Taft]] suggested that the U.S. sponsored [[Philippine Commission]] name Rizal a national hero for Filipinos. Jose Rizal was an ideal candidate, favourable to the American occupiers since he was dead, and non-violent, a favourable quality which, if emulated by Filipinos, would not threaten the American rule or change the status quo of the occupiers of Philippine islands. Rizal did not advocate independence for Philippines either.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Forbes|first=Cameron|title=The Philippine Islands|year=1945|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=B6F60A5C946DA2241A7D980E3EFA1E6F.journals?fromPage=online&amp;aid=6339224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the US-sponsored commission passed Act No. 346 which set the anniversary of Rizal’s death as a “day of observance.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Constantino|first=Renato|title=Rizal Day Lecture|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/120015/rizal-%E2%80%98amboy%E2%80%99-or-home-made-hero|accessdate=September 3, 2013|newspaper=Philippine Inquirer|date=December 30, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Renato Constantino writes Rizal is a "United States-sponsored hero" who was promoted as the greatest Filipino hero during the American colonial period of the Philippines – after Aguinaldo lost the Philippine–American War. The United States promoted Rizal, who represented peaceful political advocacy (in fact, repudiation of violent means in general) instead of more radical figures whose ideas could inspire resistance against American rule. Rizal was selected over [[Andrés Bonifacio]] who was viewed "too radical" and [[Apolinario Mabini]] who was considered "unregenerate."&lt;ref&gt;Constantino, Renato (1980) [1970], "Veneration without Understanding, Dissent and Counter-consciousness", pp. 125–145. Malaya Books, Quezon City .&lt;/ref&gt;

====Made national hero by Emilio Aguinaldo====
On the other hand, numerous sources&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aguinaldo's Rizal Day Decree, 1898|url=http://www.philippinemasonry.org/3/post/2011/05/dr-jose-rizal-1861-1896-philippine-national-hero.html|publisher=Philippine Freemasons|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; quote that it was General [[Emilio Aguinaldo]], and not the second Philippine Commission, who first recognized December 30 as "national day of mourning in memory of Rizal and other victims of Spanish tyranny. As per them, the first celebration of Rizal Day was held in Manila on December 30, 1898, under the sponsorship of the Club Filipino.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=General Emilio Aguinaldo decrees December 30, 1898, as a national day of mourning|url=http://www.philippinemasonry.org/3/post/2011/05/dr-jose-rizal-1861-1896-philippine-national-hero.html|accessdate=September 3, 2013|newspaper=El Heraldo dela Revolucion|date=December 25, 1898}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The veracity of both claims seems to be justified and hence difficult to ascertain. However, most historians agree that a majority of Filipinos were unaware of Rizal during his lifetime,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ocampo|first=Ambeth|title=Was Jose Rizal an American-sponsored Hero?|url=http://joserizal.nhcp.gov.ph/Reflections/americanhero.htm|work=Reflections of Jose Rizal|publisher=NHCP – National Historical Commission of The Philippines|accessdate=September 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he was a member of the richer elite classes (he was born in an affluent family, had lived abroad for nearly as long as he had lived in the Philippines) and wrote primarily in an elite language (at that time, [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] were the languages of the masses) about ideals as lofty as freedom (the masses were more concerned about day to day issues like earning money and making a living, something which has not changed much today).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zaide|first=Gregorio and Sonia|title=Jose Rizal: Life, Works, and Writings of a Genius, Writer, Scientist and National Hero|year=1999|publisher=All Nations publishing Co.

Teodoro Agoncillo opines that the Philippine national hero, unlike those of other countries, is not "the leader of its liberation forces". He gives the opinion that Andrés Bonifacio not replace Rizal as national hero, like some have suggested, but that be honored alongside him.&lt;ref&gt;Agoncillo, Teodoro (1990) [1960], "History of the Filipino People (8th ed.)". Garotech Publishing Inc., Quezon City. {{ISBN|971-8711-06-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constantino's analysis has been criticised for its polemicism and inaccuracies regarding Rizal.&lt;ref&gt;Couttie, Bob (2007). [https://www.scribd.com/doc/35185987/The-End-of-Veneration "The End of Veneration"]. Scribd.com. Retrieved on September 29, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The historian Rafael Palma, contends that the revolution of Bonifacio is a consequence wrought by the writings of Rizal and that although the Bonifacio's revolver produced an immediate outcome, the pen of Rizal generated a more lasting achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Palma (1949). "Pride of the Malay Race", p. 367. Prentice Hall, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critiques of books===
Others present him as a man of contradictions. [[Miguel de Unamuno]] in "Rizal: the Tagalog Hamlet", said of him, “a soul that dreads the revolution although deep down desires it. He pivots between fear and hope, between faith and despair.”&lt;ref&gt;Miguel de Unamuno, "The Tagalog Hamlet" in ''Rizal: Contrary Essays'', edited by D. Feria and P. Daroy (Manila: National Book Store, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt; His critics assert this character flaw is translated into his two novels where he opposes violence in ''Noli'' and appears to advocate it in ''Fili'', contrasting Ibarra's idealism to Simoun's cynicism. His defenders insist this ambivalence is trounced when Simoun is struck down in the sequel's final chapters, reaffirming the author's resolute stance, ''Pure and spotless must the victim be if the sacrifice is to be acceptable.''&lt;ref name="Fili"&gt;José Rizal, ''El Filibusterismo'' (Ghent: 1891) chap.39, translated by Andrea Tablan and Salud Enriquez (Manila: Marian Publishing House, 2001) {{ISBN|971-686-154-0}}. ([http://www.gutenberg.org/catalog/world/readfile?fk_files=44689&amp;pageno=233 online text at Project Gutenberg])&lt;/ref&gt;

Many thinkers tend to find the characters of María Clara and Ibarra (Noli Me Tángere) poor role models, María Clara being too frail, and young Ibarra being too accepting of circumstances, rather than being courageous and bold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lua|first=Shirley|title=Love, Loss and the Noli|url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/10659/love-loss-and-the-%E2%80%98noli%E2%80%99|accessdate=September 3, 2013|newspaper=The Philippine Inquirer|date=August 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''El Filibusterismo'', Rizal had Father Florentino say: “...our liberty will (not) be secured at the sword's point...we must secure it by making ourselves worthy of it. And when a people reaches that height God will provide a weapon, the idols will be shattered, tyranny will crumble like a house of cards and liberty will shine out like the first dawn.”&lt;ref name="Fili" /&gt; Rizal's attitude to the [[Philippine Revolution]] is also debated, not only based on his own writings, but also due to the varying eyewitness accounts of [[Pío Valenzuela]], a doctor who in 1895 had consulted Rizal in Dapitan on behalf of Bonifacio and the ''Katipunan''.

===Role in the Philippine revolution===
Upon the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution in 1896, Valenzuela surrendered to the Spanish authorities and testified in military court that Rizal had strongly condemned an armed struggle for independence when Valenzuela asked for his support. Rizal had even refused him entry to his house. Bonifacio, in turn, had openly denounced him as a coward for his refusal.{{refn|Bonifacio later mobilized his men to attempt to liberate Rizal while in [[Fort Santiago]]. (Laubach, op.cit., chap. 15)|group=note}}

But years later, Valenzuela testified that Rizal had been favorable to an uprising as long as the Filipinos were well-prepared, and well-supplied with arms. Rizal had suggested that the ''Katipunan'' get wealthy and influential Filipino members of society on their side, or at least ensure they would stay neutral. Rizal had even suggested his friend [[Antonio Luna]] to lead the revolutionary forces since he had studied military science.{{refn|Antonio Luna denounced the ''Katipunan'', but became a general under Emilio Aguinaldo's First Republic and fought in the [[Philippine–American War]].|group=note}} In the event that the ''Katipunan'' was discovered prematurely, they should fight rather than allow themselves to be killed. Valenzuela said to historian [[Teodoro Agoncillo]] that he had lied to the Spanish military authorities about Rizal's true stance toward a revolution in an attempt to exculpate him.&lt;ref&gt;Agoncillo, Teodoro. ''The Revolt of the Masses''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his execution, Rizal wrote a proclamation ''denouncing'' the revolution. But as noted by historian Floro Quibuyen, his final poem ''Mi ultimo adios'' contains a stanza which equates his coming execution and the rebels then dying in battle as fundamentally the same, as both are dying for their country.&lt;ref&gt;Quibuyen, ''A Nation Aborted: Rizal, American Hegemony, And Philippine Nationalism''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy and remembrance==
Rizal was a contemporary of [[Gandhi]], [[Tagore]] and [[Sun Yat Sen]] who also advocated liberty through peaceful means rather than by violent revolution. Coinciding with the appearance of those other leaders, Rizal from an early age had been enunciating in poems, tracts and plays, ideas all his own of modern nationhood as a practical possibility in Asia. In the ''Noli'' he stated that if European civilization had nothing better to offer, colonialism in Asia was doomed.{{refn|Also stated in Rizal's essay, "The Philippines: A Century Hence", ''The batteries are gradually becoming charged and if the prudence of the government does not provide an outlet for the currents that are accumulating, someday the sparks will be generated.''

Though popularly mentioned, especially on blogs, there is no evidence to suggest that Gandhi or Nehru may have corresponded with Rizal, neither have they mentioned him in any of their memoirs or letters. But it was documented by Rizal's biographer, Austin Coates who interviewed Jawaharlal Nehru and Gandhi that Rizal was mentioned, specifically in [[Letters from a Father to His Daughter|Nehru's prison letters to his daughter Indira]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecommunitypaper.com/archive/2008/01_10/index.php|title=The Paper|work=thecommunitypaper.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Look|first=Wing, Kam|title=Jose Rizal and Mahatma Gandhi: nationalism and non- violence|year=1997|publisher=The University of Hongkong|location=Hongkong|url=http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/40428/1/FullText.pdf?accept=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[political figure]], José Rizal was the founder of ''[[La Liga Filipina]]'', a civic organization that subsequently gave birth to the ''Katipunan'' led by [[Andrés Bonifacio]],{{refn|Bonifacio was a member of La Liga Filipina. After Rizal's arrest and exile, it was disbanded and the group splintered into two factions; the more radical group formed into the ''Katipunan'', the militant arm of the insurrection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boondocksnet.com/centennial/sctexts/esj_97d_b.html].

He was a proponent of achieving Philippine self-government peacefully through institutional reform rather than through violent revolution, and would only support "violent means" as a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trillana III|first=Dr. Pablo S.|title=2 historical events led to birth of modern RP|url=http://www.inquirer.net/specialfeatures/independenceday/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20070611-70586|work=Philippine Daily Inquirer|accessdate=June 11, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120171104/http://www.inquirer.net/specialfeatures/independenceday/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20070611-70586|archivedate=January 20, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rizal believed that the only justification for national liberation and self-government was the restoration of the dignity of the people,{{refn|Rizal's annotations of Morga's ''Sucesos de las islas Filipinas'' (1609), which he copied word for word from the [[British Museum]] and had published, called attention to an antiquated book, a testimony to the well-advanced civilization in the Philippines during pre-Spanish era. In his essay "The Indolence of the Filipino" Rizal stated that three centuries of Spanish rule did not do much for the advancement of his countryman; in fact there was a 'retrogression', and the Spanish colonialists have transformed him into a 'half-way brute.' The absence of moral stimulus, the lack of material inducement, the demoralization--'the ''indio'' should not be separated from his [[carabao]]', the endless wars, the lack of a national sentiment, the Chinese piracy—all these factors, according to Rizal, helped the colonial rulers succeed in placing the ''indio'' 'on a level with the beast'.

His image as the Tagalog Christ also intensified early reverence to him.

Rizal, through his reading of Morga and other western historians, knew of the genial image of Spain's early relations with his people.&lt;ref&gt;José Rizal, [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/6885 "Indolence of the Filipino"]. Retrieved on January 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In his writings, he showed the disparity between the early colonialists and those of his day, with the latter's injustices giving rise to [[Gomburza]] and the Philippine Revolution of 1896.
The English biographer, [[Austin Coates]], and writer, [[Benedict Anderson]], believe that Rizal gave the Philippine revolution a genuinely national character; and that Rizal's patriotism and his standing as one of Asia's first intellectuals have inspired others of the importance of a national identity to nation-building.&lt;ref name="Coates" /&gt;{{refn|According to Anderson, Rizal is one of the best exemplars of nationalist thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benedict Anderson|Anderson Benedict]] (2005).

The Belgian researcher Jean Paul "JP" Verstraeten authored several books about Jose Rizal: ''Rizal in Belgium and France'', ''Jose Rizal's Europe'', ''Growing up like Rizal'' (published by the National Historical Institute and in teacher's programs all over the Philippines), ''Reminiscences and Travels of Jose Rizal'' and Jose Rizal "Pearl of Unselfishness". He received an award from the president of the Philippines "in recognition of his unwavering support and commitment to promote the health and education of disadvantaged Filipinos, and his invaluable contribution to engender the teachings and ideals of Dr. Jose Rizal in the Philippines and in Europe". 
One of the greatest researchers about Rizal nowadays is Lucien Spittael.

Several titles were bestowed on him: "the First Filipino", "Greatest Man of the Brown Race", among others. The [[Knights of Rizal|Order of the Knights of Rizal]], a civic and patriotic organization, boasts of dozens of chapters all over the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://knightsofrizal.org.ph/ Knights of Rizal] - central website of the Order, Philippines&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knightsofrizal.org Order of the Knights of Rizal] - website of the Malaya chapter, Chigago, Illinois&lt;/ref&gt; There are some remote-area religious sects who venerate Rizal as a [[Folk saint]] collectively known as the [[Rizalista religious movements]], who claim him as a sublimation of Christ.&lt;ref&gt;(2011-08-23).

===Species named after Rizal===

José Rizal was imprisoned at [[Fort Santiago]] and soon after he was banished at [[Dapitan]] where he plunged himself into studying of nature. He then able to collect a number of species of various classes: insects, [[butterflies]], [[amphibians]], [[reptiles]], [[Seashell|shells]], [[snakes]] and plants.

Rizal sent many specimens of animals, insects, and plants for identification to the (Anthropological and Ethnographical Museum of Dresden&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skd.museum/en/museums-institutions/japanisches-palais/museum-fuer-voelkerkunde-dresden/index.html|title=Staatliche Kunstsammlungen Dresden – Museum für Völkerkunde Dresden|work=skd.museum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509134944/http://www.skd.museum/en/museums-institutions/japanisches-palais/museum-fuer-voelkerkunde-dresden/index.html|archivedate=May 9, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Dresden Museum of Ethnology]]. It was not in his interest to receive any monetary payment; all he wanted were [[scientific]] books, magazines and [[surgical instruments]] which he needed and used in [[Dapitan]].

During his exile, Rizal also secretly sent several specimens of [[Draco (genus)|flying dragons]] to Europe. He believed that they were a new species. The German zoologist Benno Wandolleck named them ''Draco rizali'' after Rizal. However, it has since been discovered that the species had already been described by the Belgian-British zoologist [[George Albert Boulenger]] in 1885 as ''[[Draco guentheri]]''.&lt;ref name="rdb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species?genus=Draco&amp;species=guentheri|title=''Draco guentheri'' BOULENGER, 1885|author1=Peter Uetz |author2=Jakob Hallermann |author3=Jiri Hosek |publisher=The Reptile Database|accessdate=December 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three species named after Rizal:
* ''[[Draco rizali]]'' – a small lizard, known as a flying dragon
* ''Apogania rizali'' – a very rare kind of beetle with five horns
* ''[[Rhacophorus rizali]]'' – a peculiar frog species. Rhacophorus rizali&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joserizal.ph/ta02.html|title=Jose Rizal [Trivia]|work=joserizal.ph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical commemoration===
* Although his field of action lay in politics, Rizal's real interests lay in the arts and sciences, in literature and in his profession as an ophthalmologist. Shortly after his death, the Anthropological Society of Berlin met to honor him with a reading of a German translation of his farewell poem and Dr. [[Rudolf Virchow]] delivering the eulogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/ufreytag/page17.html |title=Dr. Virchow's obituary on Rizal, 1897 |accessdate=November 12, 2006 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618024056/http://www.geocities.com/ufreytag/page17.html |archivedate=June 18, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Rizal Monument]] now stands near the place where he fell at the Luneta in Bagumbayan, which is now called [[Rizal Park]], a [[List of national parks of the Philippines|national park]] in Manila. The monument, which also contains his remains, was designed by the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[Richard Kissling]] of the [[William Tell (opera)|William Tell]] sculpture in [[Altdorf, Uri]].{{refn|Rizal himself translated Schiller's ''William Tell'' into Tagalog in 1886.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joserizal.ph/tr17.html "Rizal in Berlin, Germany"].

* The [[William Howard Taft|Taft]] Commission in June 1901 approved Act 137 renaming the District of Morong into the Province of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]]. Today, the wide acceptance of Rizal is evidenced by the countless towns, streets, and numerous parks in the Philippines named in his honor.

===Adaptation of his works===
The cinematic depiction of Rizal's literary works won two film industry awards more than a century after his birth. In the 10th [[FAMAS Awards]], he was honored in the Best Story category for Gerardo de León's adaptation of his book ''Noli Me Tángere''. The recognition was repeated the following year with his movie version of ''El Filibusterismo'', making him the only person to win back-to-back FAMAS Awards posthumously.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

Both novels were translated into opera by the composer-librettist Felipe Padilla de León: ''Noli me tangere'' in 1957 and ''[[El filibusterismo]]'' in 1970; and his 1939 overture, ''Mariang Makiling'', was inspired by Rizal's tale of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mari Arquiza |url=http://www.philmusicregistry.net/artist_profile.php?artist_id=218 |title=:: Felipe De Leon : |work=Philmusicregistry.net |accessdate=December 30, 2009|date=December 2, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ramaswamy Aiyer Krishnamurthy''' (9 September 1899 – 5 December 1954), better known by his pen name '''Kalki''', was a Tamil writer, journalist, poet, critic and Indian independence activist.  
  
He was named after "[[Kalki]]", the tenth and last [[avatar]] of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] God [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Room|first=Adrian|title=Dictionary of Pseudonyms: 13,000 assumed names and their origins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSIhzKnNUf4C&amp;lpg=PA254|accessdate=15 April 2013|year=2010|edition=5|publisher=Macfarland|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=978-0-7864-4373-4 |page=254}}&lt;/ref&gt; His writings include over 120 short stories, 10 novellas, 5 novels, 3 historical romances, editorial and political writings and hundreds of film and music reviews.

==Early life==
Krishnamurthy's father was Ramaswamy Aiyar, a poor accountant in Puttamangalam village in the old [[Tanjore]] district of erstwhile [[Madras Presidency]]. He began his primary education in his village school and later attended Municipal High School in [[Mayavaram]] but quit in 1921, just short of completion of his Senior School Leaving Certificate, in response to [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s 1921 [[Non-cooperation movement|call for non-co-operation]] joining the [[Indian National Congress]] instead.&lt;ref name="Frontline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1621/16210810.htm|title=Renaissance man|last1=Viswanathan|first1=S.|date=9 October 1999|work=Frontline|publisher=The Hindu group|accessdate=14 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anandhi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chennaibest.com/cityresources/Books_and_Hobbies/kalki.asp|title=Kalki – the man behind the legend: An intimate portrait by his daughter K.

==Career==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
In 1923 he joined as a sub-editor at ''Navashakti'', a [[Tamil language|Tamil]] periodical edited by Tamil scholar and freedom fighter [[Thiru. V. Kalyanasundaram]], popularly known as "Thiru Vi. Ka". Krishnamurthy's first book was published in 1927. After leaving ''Navashakti'' in 1928, Krishnamurthy stayed with [[Rajaji|C. Rajagopalachari]] at the Gandhi [[ashram]] in [[Tiruchengode]] in [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]] district and helped him edit ''Vimochanam'', a Tamil journal devoted to propagating prohibition. In 1931, he was again imprisoned for six months. Next year Krishnamurthy joined ''[[Ananda Vikatan]]'', a humour weekly edited and published by [[S. S. Vasan]].

Krishnamurthy's witty, incisive comments on politics, literature, music and other forms of art were looked forward to with unceasing interest by readers. He wrote under the pen names of "Kalki", "Ra. Ki", "Tamil Theni", "Karnatakam" and so on. Vikatan published many of his short stories and novels (as serials). In 1941, he left ''Ananda Vikatan'', and rejoined the freedom struggle and courted arrest.

Upon his release after three months he and [[Kalki Sadasivam|Sadasivam]] started the magazine ''Kalki''. He was its editor until his death on 5 December 1954. The success that Krishnamurthy attained in the realm of historical fiction is phenomenal. At a time when the literacy level was low and when the English-educated Tamils looked down on writings in Tamil, Kalki's circulation touched 71,000 copies – the largest for any weekly in the county then – when it serialised his historical novels. ''Semmalar'', the monthly organ of the [[Tamil Nadu]] [[Progressive Writers' Movement|Progressive Writers Association]], brought out a special number to commemorate Kalki's birth centenary. Kalki wrote the script and some lyrics for [[Meera (1945 film)|Meera]], a film starring [[M.S. Subbulakshmi]].

Kalki's contribution to the cause of [[Tamil music]] is also noteworthy. He spearheaded a movement that wanted [[Carnatic music]]ians to include more Tamil songs in their concerts and composed a number of songs. His Tamil translation of Gandhi's autobiography, ''[[My Experiments with Truth]]'', was published as ''Satya Sothanai''.

==Novels==
Kalki considered ''Alai Osai'', which was serialised in [[Kalki (magazine)|Kalki]] in 1948–49 and published as a book in 1963, as his best. The novel won him the [[Sahitya Akademi Award]] posthumously in 1956. Set at the time of Indian Independence Struggle, the book revolves around how the life of people living at that time and place are influenced by various fluctuations in Indian Society.

His other social novels include ''Thyaga Bhoomi'' (The land of sacrifice) and ''Kalvanin Kadali'' (Bandit's sweetheart), both of which have been filmed. ''Thyaga Bhoomi'', which has the [[Salt Satyagraha]] as its backdrop, dealt with women's rights and [[untouchability]]. It was serialised in ''[[Ananda Vikatan]]'', and was being filmed at the same time. Stills from the filming were used as illustration. After a successful run for six weeks, the film, directed by veteran [[K. Subramanyam]], was banned by the colonial Government on the grounds that it indirectly aroused the people to fight for freedom. Almost all of Kalki's novels appeared first in the serial form and only then in the book form.

''[[Parthiban Kanavu]]'' and ''[[Sivagamiyin Sapatham]]'' give a picture of the great [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] Age of the seventh century A.D., whereas ''[[Ponniyin Selvan]]'' paints the age of the glorious [[Chola dynasty|Cholas]]. Both periods are a mixture of many aspects of the history of [[Tamil Nadu]] such as that of religions, literature, art and architecture and also of administration.

'''Kalmi Baruh''' ({{lang-sr-cyrl|Калми Барух}}); 26 December 1896 &amp;ndash; 1945) was a [[History of the Jews in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Jewish]] [[scholar]] in the field of [[Judeo-Spanish language]], pioneer of the Sephardic studies and [[Hispanic studies]] in former [[Yugoslavia]].

==Life and activities==
Kalmi Baruh was born in December 1896 in [[Sarajevo]], in one of the oldest Sephardic families in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He attended elementary school in the town of [[Višegrad]] (Вишеград), and has graduated from high-school in Sarajevo. Baruh's academic studies and the PhD - ''Der Lautstand des Judenspanischen in Bosnien'' (The Sound System of the Judeo-Spanish in Bosnia) were at [[Vienna University]]. He worked as a teacher in the First Sarajevan Gymnasium/High-school, and was the only [[Balkan Peninsula]] scholarship recipient from the [[Spain|Spanish]] Government for the post-doctoral studies in the Spanish Center for Historic Studies in [[Madrid]] (1928/9). For a long period of years he worked together with several Yugoslav and [[Europe]]an magazines in the field of [[linguistics]] and [[literature]], such as: ''Srpski književni glasnik'' and ''Misao'', both from [[Belgrade]], ''Revista de filología Española'' (Madrid)....  He collaborated with the Institute for Balkan Studies and the [[University of Belgrade]] and the [[Royal Spanish Academy]]. He translated from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to [[Serbian language|Serbian]]   ([[Enrique Larreta]]: ''Slava don Ramira, Jedan život u doba [[Philip II of Spain|Filipa II]]'', ''Narodna prosveta'', Belgrade, 1933; [[Jose Eustasio Rivera]]: ''Vrtlog'', ''Minerva'', [[Subotica]]-Belgrade, 1953 ...). Baruh presented some of the less known modern [[Spanish literature]] in Yugoslavia and provided reviews for it. He also published linguistic comparative studies, school books and scientific works on philology reviews, especially in [[Romanic languages]]. He collected, annotated and explored Judeo-Spanish linguistic forms and romances throughout [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], [[Priština]] (Приштина) and [[Skopje]] (Скопје). Baruh was one of the pillars of the Sarajevan progressive magazine ''Pregled'', and competent basis for the congregational magazines ''Jevrejski život'' and ''Jevrejski glas'', as well as for the cultural-educational society ''[[La Benevolencija]]''. He cooperated with Prof. [[Ernesto Giménez Caballero]], Dr. [[Ivo Andrić]], [[Isidora Sekulić]], [[Žak Konfino]], [[Stanislav Vinaver]], Dr. [[Jovan Kršić]], Dr. [[Moric Levi]], [[Laura Papo Bohoreta]]... .

Baruh spoke ten languages, while he wrote his works mostly in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ([[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]]), then in Judeo-Spanish, Spanish, [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]].

During the 1930s he was an eminent, [[leftist|left-oriented]] Yugoslav intellectual. Baruh gave special attention to the pupils of poor social background, workers' education, [[inter-religious tolerance]] and fought against [[anti-semitism]]. He propagated unreserved support for the Republicans during the [[Spanish Civil War]].

He died in [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen-Belsen]] [[Nazi]] [[Germany|German]] [[Concentration Camp]].

The '''Koti language''', or '''''Ekoti''''' (pronounced {{IPA-xx|ekot̪i|}}), is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] language spoken in [[Mozambique]] by about 64,200 people{{ref|count}}. Koti is spoken on [[Koti Island]] and is also the major language of [[Angoche]], the capital of the district with the same name in the province of [[Nampula Province|Nampula]].

In terms of genetic classification, Koti is generally considered to belong to the Makhuwa group (P.30 in [[Malcolm Guthrie|Guthrie's]] classification). A large portion of its vocabulary however derives from a past variety of [[Swahili language|Swahili]], today the lingua franca of much of East Africa's coast. This Swahili influence is usually attributed to traders from [[Kilwa Kisiwani|Kilwa]] or elsewhere on the [[Zanzibar]] Coast, who in the fifteenth century settled at Angoche.{{ref|stratum}} Arends et al. suggest it might turn out to be a Makhua–Swahili [[mixed language]].&lt;ref&gt;Arends, Muysken, &amp; Smith (1995), ''Pidgins and Creoles: An Introduction''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography and demography==
The place name ''Koti'' refers primarily to the island. An older form is {{IPA|[ŋɡoji]}};{{Dubious|date=September 2009}} this form with the class 2 nominal prefix ''a'' for 'people' gave rise to the Portuguese name ''Angoche''. The much older local African name of Angoche, still in use, is ''Parápaátho''. Angoche was probably established in the fifteenth century by dissidents from [[Kilwa (district)|Kilwa]].{{ref|kilwa}} In the centuries that followed, it flourished as a part of the Indian Ocean trading network.

About nine Koti villages are found in the coastal areas of Koti island; these are usually accessed by boat. Much of the coastline is covered by mangrove woods (''khava''). On the mainland, there are about five other Koti villages, all in the vicinity of Angoche. The main economic activity of men in the villages is fishing; the catch is sold on the markets of Angoche. People keep chickens and some goats.

In Makhuwa, the dominant regional language of much of northern Mozambique, the Koti are called ''Maka'', just like other coastal Muslim communities that were part of the Indian Ocean trading network. Most Koti have at least some knowledge of Makhuwa or one of its neighbouring dialects; this extensive bilinguality has had considerable influence on the Koti language in recent years.

==Sounds==

===Vowels===
Koti has five vowels. The open vowels {{IPA|ɛ}} and {{IPA|ɔ}} are normally written ''e'' and ''o''. The high vowels ''i'' and ''u'' do not occur word-initially. There is a restricted form of [[vowel harmony]] in verbal bases which causes /u/ in verbal extensions to be rendered as [o] after another /o/; thus, the separative extensions ''-ul-'' and ''-uw-'' appear as ''-ol-'' and ''-ow-'' after the vowel ''o''. Furthermore, a distributional analysis shows that /o/ tends to occur mainly after another /o/, and only rarely after the other vowels.{{ref|vowels}}
&lt;div style="float:right; padding-left:15px"&gt;
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center;"
!Koti
! width="25%" | [[Front vowel|Front]]

|-
|style="text-align: right;"|[[Open vowel|Open]]|| || a ||
|}
&lt;/div&gt;
Vowel length is contrastive in Koti, except in word-final position. Long vowels are best treated as two tone-bearing units. Several vowel coalescense processes do take place, within words as well as across morpheme boundaries: ''mathápá mawíxí apa'' → ''mathápá mawíx'áapa'' 'these green leaves' (the apostrophe shows the location of coalescence). In case of word-final 'i' it is sometimes accompanied with [[glide formation]]: ''olíli áka'' → ''olíly'aáka'' 'my bed'.{{ref|coalescence}}

===Consonants===
The table below shows the consonant inventory of Koti.{{ref|consonants}} The two glides ''w'' and ''y'' are only phonemically contrastive in certain contexts; in some other contexts, they can be derived from vowels. Consonants in parentheses are extremely rare, with the only example of ''dh'' in S&amp;M's corpus, ''adhuhuri'' 'second prayer in the morning', being in variation with ''aduhuri''; the fricative ''zh'' occurs only in some recent loans from [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]. Voiced stops are rather infrequent overall, and they tend to occur after a homorganic, tone-bearing nasal. Additionally, voiced stops often vary with their voiceless unaspirated counterparts.

Words in Koti show incompatibility of aspirated consonants; this phenomenon is dubbed ''[[Katupha's Law]]'' in Schadeberg (1999), and is found in related Makhuwa languages as well. If two aspirated consonants are brought together in one stem, the first such consonant loses its aspiration. The effect is particularly clear in reduplicated words: ''kopikophi'' 'eyelash'; ''piriphiri'' 'pepper' (cf. Swahili 'piripiri'); ''okukuttha'' 'to wipe'.
Another incompatibility concerns dental and retroflex consonants, which never occur together within a stem, and usually assimilate when brought together. Consider the class 1 demonstrative for example: ''o-tthu-o-tu'' becomes ''othuutu'' under influence of the dentral-retroflex incompatibility.

===Tone===
Koti, like most Bantu languages, is a register tone language with two tones: High and Low. Tone is not lexically distinctive for verbs, but it is very important in verbal inflection and in some other parts of grammar. Contour tones (falling and rising tones) do occur, but only on long vowels, therefore they are analysed as sequences of the H and L level tones. There is a process of High Doubling which spreads any H tone to the following tone bearing unit, and a process of Final Lowering which deletes any utterance-final High tone. Both can be seen in effect in the following example (Low tone is unmarked): ''kaláwa'' 'boat', ''kaláwá khuúlu'' 'the biggest boat'. In ''kaláwa'', High doubling is canceled because Final Lowering applies, so the last syllable has a Low tone. In the second example, the first H tone in ''kaláwá'' has spread to the next syllable (High Doubling) and Final Lowering again causes the very last syllable of the utterance to be Low in tone.

==Morphosyntax==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
Koti has a typical Bantu [[noun class]] system, in which every noun belongs to a nominal class which class markers throughout the sentence are in agreement with. Classes pair up in 'genders' for the derivation of plurals. Verbal words consist of a ''stem'' to which various morphemes and clitics can be affixed.

'''Kutin''' is a member of the [[Duru languages|Duru]] branch of [[Savanna languages]]. Most Nigerian speakers moved to Cameroon when the [[Gashaka-Gumti National Park]] was established.

Blench (2004) considers the three varieties, Peere, Potopo (Kotopo), and Patapori, to be separate languages.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4140">The '''Langkawi Declaration on the Environment''' was a declaration issued by the assembled [[Commonwealth Heads of Government|Heads of Government]] of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] on the issue of [[environmental sustainability]].  It was issued on October 21, 1989 at [[Langkawi]], [[Malaysia]], during the tenth [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM).

The declaration covers a wide range of topics related to the environment, blaming 'past neglect in managing the natural environment and resources'.&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/171730/1989_langkawi_declaration_on_the_environment.htm |date=21 October 1989 |title=Langkawi Declaration on the Environment 1989 |accessdate=2008-08-31 |publisher=[[Commonwealth Secretariat]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202064714/http://www.thecommonwealth.org/document/34293/35468/171730/1989_langkawi_declaration_on_the_environment.htm |archivedate=2 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It lists what the Heads of Governments perceived to be the main environmental problems: the [[greenhouse effect]], damage to the [[ozone layer]], [[acid rain]], [[marine pollution]], [[land degradation]], and species [[extinction]].  These, the declaration affirmed, were issues that transcended national borders, and hence required the involvement of international organisations, such as the Commonwealth, to coordinate strategies to solve them.&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt;

A key agreement in the formulation of the agreement was the pledge by [[developed country|developed countries]] not to connect future international [[development aid]] to commitment to environmental sustainability or introduce [[trade barrier]]s.&lt;ref name="Bowman"&gt;{{cite book |title=International Law and the Conservation of Biological Diversity |last=Bowman |first=Michael |author2=Redgwell, Catherine  |year=1996 |publisher=Kluwer Law International |location= |isbn=978-90-411-0863-0 |pages=239 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This, the developing countries argued, would prevent economic growth (described as a 'compelling necessity'),&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt; and hence reduce their ability to develop sustainable natural environments.  In exchange, the developing countries conceded to the Commonwealth's developed members (particularly [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United Kingdom]]), their interest in protecting the environment.&lt;ref name="Bowman" /&gt;

Amongst the commitments made by members in the Langkawi Declaration were:&lt;ref name="Langkawi Declaration" /&gt;
* Support the development of an international sustainable development funding mechanism.
* Support the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and recommend the Commonwealth's own report on [[climate change]].
* Promote [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].
* Promote [[afforestation]] and sustainable forest management in developing countries, and the conservation of [[Old growth forest|virgin forest]] to protect [[biodiversity]].
* Restrict non-[[sustainable fisheries]], including banning tangle nets and pelagic driftnet fishing, as part of a general trend amongst international organisations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthtrust.org/dnpaper/intllaw.html |date=May 1994 |title=International Law Governing Driftnet Fishing on the High Seas |accessdate=2008-08-31 |publisher=[[Earthtrust]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Prevent dumping of toxic or hazardous materials in the oceans or in developing countries.
* Promote public awareness of environmental risks and issues.

'''Olga Moraes Sarmento da Silveira''' (nèe, '''Maria Olga de Moraes Sarmento da Silveira'''; known also as, '''Olga Morais Sarmento'''; 26 May 1881 - 17 October 1948) was a Portuguese writer and feminist. 

==Early years==
Maria Olga de Moraes Sarmento da Silveira was born in [[Setúbal]], 26 May 1881. She was a daughter and granddaughter of military men, spending part of her childhood in Elvas, where she became a friend of [[Virgínia Quaresma]].&lt;ref&gt;"Maria Olga de Morais Sarmento da Silveira". En: Dicionário no Feminino (séculos XIX-XX), dirección de Zília Osório de Castro y João Esteves, coord. António Ferreira de Sousa, Ilda Soares de Abreu e Maria Emília Stone (Lisboa: Livros Horizonte, 2005), pp. 736-37.&lt;/ref&gt; She married a Navy physician when she was 16, who died shortly afterwards in combat, in Cuamato, Angola. 

==Career==
Moraes associated with a group of Portuguese intellectuals, who at the beginning of the 20th century, fought for civil rights, as well as women's legal and political rights. She succeeded [[Ana de Castro Osório]]as editor-in-chief of ''Sociedade Futura'' (founded 1902). She affiliated with ''Liga Portuguesa da Paz'' (Portuguese League of Peace), cofounding the organization and serving as president of its Feminist Section in 1906.

On May 18, 1906, Moraes delivered a lecture on "Problema Feminista" (Feminist Problem) at the Sociedad de Geografía de Lisboa.&lt;ref&gt;SARMENTO, Olga Moraes. As Minhas Memórias (Lisboa: Portugália, 1948), pp. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; She also traveled as a lecturer to South America, visiting Brazil, Uruguay, and Argentina. In Brazil, she met and became friends with the writer [[Júlia Lopes de Almeida]].&lt;ref&gt;SARMENTO, Olga Moraes. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Moraes lived in Paris during the First World War . For more than thirty years, she was a companion and partner of Baroness [[Hélène van Zuylen]], of the [[Rothschild banking family of France]], whom she saved from the Holocaust by taking her to Lisbon and then to [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;''As Minhas Memórias'', pp. 312-13. &lt;/ref&gt; She also devoted herself to writing the Baroness' memoirs.

Moraes was closely linked to her city of birth, Setúbal, leaving all her assets to the Municipal Chamber, including her personal library and a vast collection of autographs of personalities from art, music and literature in postcards, letters, and books. This legacy is part of the collection of the Museo de Setúbal/[[Monastery of Jesus of Setúbal|Convento de Jesús]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mun-setubal.pt/pt/pagina/olga-moraes-sarmento-1881-1948/129|title=Olga Moraes Sarmento (1881-1948)|publisher=Municipal de Setúbal|accessdate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in Lisbon, 17 October 1948.{{sfn|INDEX|2014|p=392}}

'''Message discipline''' is the concept that [[politician]]s and other public policy advocates should talk about what is relevant to achieve their aims, and not allow themselves to be sidetracked either by their own thoughts or the questions of [[Mass media|press]] or audience. &lt;!-- Essentially, they should try to manipulate any discussion to mislead voters through "glittering generalities".--&gt; The term is finding its way into business, both in advertising and internal communications.

When a politician repeats the same thing ''ad nauseam'', or uses a question on one subject as a launching point to talk about a different subject, he or she is said to be exercising message discipline. Message discipline may  involve a subordination of irrelevant personal opinions, or a subordination of fluctuating desires to say what others want to hear versus maintaining an unwavering devotion to the message as it reaches out to greater numbers of potential audience members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Managing the President's Message: The White House Communications Operation|author=Martha Joynt Kumar|publisher=JHU Press|year=2007|isbn=080188652X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Message discipline is often practiced around [[wedge issue]]s. Devolving to talking points (practicing message discipline) around issues such as same-sex marriage or abortion rights can be a powerful weapon in the politician's arsenal, either clouding a difficult line of questioning from an interviewer, or motivating the candidates' base to vote. Key to defining wedge issues and practicing message discipline are the selection of terms that [[Low information voter|low-information voters]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brockington,|first=David|title=A Low Information Theory of Ballot Position Effect|journal=Political Behavior|date=2003-03-01|doi=10.1023/A:1022946710610|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1023/A:1022946710610}}&lt;/ref&gt; will rally around.

This goal-oriented, structured, strategic communication, is believed{{by whom?|date=January 2014}} to drive operational excellence in organizations, as it reduces the clutter and mixed messages that sometimes afflict communications through organizational layers.

Message discipline is criticised by educated voters who see it as a method of obfuscation from what the electorate sees as important. Overly simplistic and repeated communications of the message is seen as dumbing downnand can meet with cynicism of the electorate.

A '''monkey's fist''' or '''monkey paw''' is a type of [[knot]], so named because it looks somewhat like a small bunched fist/paw. It is tied at the end of a [[rope]] to serve as a weight, making it easier to throw, and also as an [[ornamental knot]]. This type of weighted rope can be used as a hand-to-hand weapon, called a [[slungshot]] by [[sailor]]s. It was also used in the past as an [[anchor (climbing)|anchor]] in rock climbing, by stuffing it into a crack. Nowadays it is still sometimes used in [[sandstone]], e.g., the [[Elbe Sandstone Mountains]] in [[Germany]].

==Description==
[[File:Monkey's fist.jpg|thumb|right|an ornamental monkey's fist with a hard eye splice, custom-made at the chandlers [[Arthur Beale]]]]
{{Quote|The monkey's fist is a spherical covering with six surface parts presenting a regular over-one-and-under-one weave. This weave is commonly doubled or tripled to present an appearance that superficially resembles a Turk's-head. Like the Turk's-head, the knot is tied with a single strand, but here the resemblance ceases. The Turk's-head diagram consists of a single line; the common monkey's fist diagram has three separate lines, which are best represented by three interlocking circles, in the best Ballantine tradition. To tie a knot on this diagram with a single strand, it is necessary to complete each circle in turn—that is, to double or triple it, as the case may be—and when this has been done to deflect the strand into another circle which is completed in turn before commencing the third and last circle.|''[[The Ashley Book of Knots]]''&lt;ref&gt;Ashley, Clifford W. (1944). ''The Ashley Book of Knots'', p.353. Doubleday. {{ISBN|0-385-04025-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The monkey's fist knot is most often used as the weight in a heaving line. The line would have the monkey's fist on one end, an [[eye splice]] or [[bowline]] on the other, with about 30 feet (~10 metres) of line between. A lightweight feeder line would be tied to the bowline, then the weighted heaving line could be hurled between ship and dock. The other end of the lightweight line would be attached to a heavier-weight line, allowing it to be drawn to the target easily.

The knot is often tied around a small weight, such as a stone, marble, tight fold of paper, [[grapeshot]], or a piece of wood. However, this may be considered unsafe and therefore poor seamanship.
The UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s (MCA) publication “Code of Safe Working Practices for Merchant Seamen”, Section 25.3.2, states that “heaving lines should be constructed with a “monkey’s fist” at one end. To prevent personal injury, the ‘fist’ should be made only with rope and should not contain added weighting materials”.
[http://www.southamptonvts.co.uk/admin/content/files/NTMs/2016%20No%2027%20Correction.pdf]

They should not be attached by metal or plastic clip to the heaving line. 
Some port authorities instruct linesmen to cut off monkey's fists that use these fastenings. [http://portmarinesafetycode.co.uk/cntm1-16.htm]

==Tying==
[[File:Monkey Fist HowTo.jpg|thumb|left|tying the Monkeys fist]]
:A simpler knot to use as weight while throwing a rope is [[heaving line knot]] [[File:Heaving line knot step4.jpg|thumb|right|heaving line knot, light version]] tied using the same 3 step method as a monkeys fist but with only one turn (light version) or one and a half turns (heavier version) in the first step, most of the rope weight provided by the turns at the second step, and as third step threading the end through the nearest bight pinched by the turns at the second step and tightening.

== Other applications ==
[[File:Monkey fist cufflink.jpg|thumb|A [[cufflink]] made from a wire tied into a Monkey's fist knot]]
A monkey's fist can be used on two ends of a tow lines of one side a fish net which is then thrown from one trawler to another, allowing the net to be cast and set between two boats so the [[trawl]] can be used between the two, in [[pair trawling]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Board on Science and Technology for International Development, National Research Council | title=Fisheries Technologies for Developing Countries | url=http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=1024&amp;page=77 | publisher=The National Academies Press  | year=1998 | accessdate=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the tow or catch is negotiated between both parties. This makes it easier to catch fish given the greater surface area between both boats to turn around and catch missed fish from the sea much more quickly. Once all fish have been hauled up from the sea, tow lines of the fish net is returned by way of thrown both monkey's fists back to the host trawler. Alternatively, a monkey fist can be used as a weight of a heaving line thrown to over to an opposing ship to bring two ships together.&lt;ref&gt;Leishman, J. "[http://www.nordhavn.com/newsroom/articles/sea_09-04_AcrossIn18.pdf Leg 1: Ft. Lauderdale to Bermuda - Across the Atlantic in 18 Trawlers]." Sea Magazine, September 2004. Accessed 2009-06-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its use as a lifeline thrown from boat to boat, this knot was adopted as a symbol of solidarity among the [[hobo]] community.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

Monkey's fists are commonly used as a convenient and unobtrusive method of storing and transporting precious gemstones.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

A floating monkey's fist can be created by tying around a buoyant material such as cork or styrofoam.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The three coils of cordage in a monkey's fist form in effect a set of [[Borromean rings]] in three dimensions. This is most obvious when tied flat.

It is also the most common knot used in a pair for [[cufflinks]] where it is considered a "silk knot."

Monkey fists have become popular as main deployment handles for sport parachute systems.

The '''Naʼvi language''' (Naʼvi: ''{{lang|art|Lìʼfya leNaʼvi}}'') is the [[constructed language]] of the [[Naʼvi]], the [[Sapience|sapient]] [[humanoid]] [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] inhabitants of the fictional moon Pandora in the 2009 film [[Avatar (2009 film)|''Avatar'']]. It was created by [[Paul Frommer]], a professor at the [[University of Southern California|USC]] [[USC Marshall School of Business|Marshall School of Business]] with a doctorate in [[linguistics]]. Naʼvi was designed to fit [[James Cameron]]'s conception of what the language should sound like in the film, to be realistically learnable by the fictional human characters of the film, and to be pronounceable by the actors, but to not closely resemble any single human language.

When the film was released in 2009, Naʼvi had a growing vocabulary of about a thousand words, but understanding of its grammar was limited to the language's creator.&lt;ref name="www.npr.org"&gt;{{Cite web| last =  | first =  | title = Do You Speak Na'vi? Giving Voice To 'Avatar' Aliens : NPR | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=121350582 | publisher =  | accessdate = 16 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has changed subsequently as Frommer has expanded the lexicon to more than 2200 words&lt;ref name="www.learnnavi.org"&gt;{{Cite web| last =  | first =  | title = Definitive Na’vi Dictionary | url = http://eanaeltu.learnnavi.org/dicts/NaviDictionary.pdf | publisher =  | accessdate = 25 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has published the grammar, thus making Naʼvi a relatively complete, learnable and serviceable language.

==Roots==
The Naʼvi language has its origins in James Cameron's early work on ''Avatar''.  In 2005, while the film was still in [[scriptment]] form, Cameron felt it needed a complete, consistent language for the alien characters to speak.  He had written approximately thirty words for this [[alien language]] but wanted a linguist to create the language in full.  His production company, [[Lightstorm Entertainment]], contacted the linguistics department at the [[University of Southern California]] seeking someone who would be interested in creating such a language. Edward Finegan, a professor of linguistics at USC, thought that the project would appeal to Paul Frommer, with whom he had co-authored a linguistics textbook, and so forwarded Lightstorm's inquiry on to him.  Frommer and Cameron met to discuss the director's vision for the language and its use in the film; at the end of the meeting, Cameron shook Frommer's hand and said "Welcome aboard."

Based on Cameron's initial list of words, which had a "Polynesian flavor" according to Frommer,&lt;ref name=uso&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usoproject.blogspot.com/2009/11/interview-with-paul-frommer-alien.html |title=An interview with Paul Frommer, Alien Language Creator for Avatar |work=Unidentified Sound Object |first=Matteo |last=Milani |date=November 24, 2009 |accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the linguist developed three different sets of meaningless words and phrases that conveyed a sense of what an alien language might sound like: one using [[Tone (linguistics)|contrasting tones]], one using [[Vowel length|varying vowel lengths]], and one using [[ejective consonant]]s.  Of the three, Cameron liked the sound of the ejectives most.  His choice established the [[phonology]] that Frommer would use in developing the rest of the Naʼvi language – [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], and an initial [[Lexicon|vocabulary]] – a task that took six months.

==Development==
The Naʼvi vocabulary was created by Frommer as needed for the script.  By the time [[Casting (performing arts)|casting]] for ''Avatar'' began, the language was sufficiently developed that actors were required to read and pronounce Naʼvi dialogue during auditions.  During [[Filmmaking#Production|shooting]] Frommer worked with the cast, helping them understand their Naʼvi dialogue and advising them on their Naʼvi [[pronunciation]], [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]], and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]].  Actors would often make mistakes in speaking Naʼvi.  In some cases, those mistakes were plausibly explained as ones their human characters would make; in other cases, the mistakes were incorporated into the language.

Frommer expanded the vocabulary further in May 2009 when he worked on the [[James Cameron's Avatar: The Game|''Avatar'' video game]], which required Naʼvi words that had not been needed for the film script and thus had not yet been invented. Frommer also translated into Naʼvi four sets of song lyrics that had been written by Cameron in English, and he helped [[vocalist]]s with their pronunciation during the recording of [[James Horner]]'s [[Avatar: Music from the Motion Picture|''Avatar'' score]].  At the time of the film's release on December 18, 2009, the Naʼvi vocabulary consisted of approximately 1000 words.

Work on the Naʼvi language has continued even after the film's release.  Frommer is working on a compendium which he plans to deliver to [[20th Century Fox|Fox]] in the near future.&lt;ref name=vf&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2009/12/brushing-up-on-navi-the-language-of-avatar.html |title=Brushing up on Na'vi, the Language of ''Avatar'' |journal=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |first=Julian |last=Sancton |date=December 1, 2009 |accessdate=January 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108074609/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/oscars/2009/12/brushing-up-on-navi-the-language-of-avatar.html |archivedate=January  8, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He hopes that the language will "have a life of its own,"&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2009/11/usc-professor-creates-alien-language-for-avatar.html |title=USC professor creates an entire alien language for 'Avatar' |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |first=Geoff |last=Boucher |date=November 20, 2009 |accessdate=January 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thinks it would be "wonderful" if the language developed a following.&lt;ref name=uso /&gt; Since then, it has developed a following, as is evident through the increasing learner community of the language.&lt;ref name=ubc&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://news.ok.ubc.ca/2011/07/28/language-of-avatar-under-study/ |title=Language of Avatar under study |journal=[[UBC Media Releases]] |first= |last= |date=July 28, 2011 |accessdate=October 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community's Lexical Expansion Project, together with Frommer, has expanded the lexicon by more than 50 percent.

Frommer also maintains a blog, Na’viteri, where he regularly posts additions to the lexicon and clarifications on grammar. Naʼviteri has been the source of the vast majority of Naʼvi growth independent of Frommer's contract with 20th Century Fox.

==Structure and usage==

{{Refimprove section|date=August 2013}}

The Naʼvi language was developed under three significant constraints.  First, Cameron wanted the language to sound alien but pleasant and appealing to audiences.  Second, since the storyline included humans who have learned to speak the language, it had to be a language that humans could plausibly learn to speak.  And finally, the actors would have to be able to pronounce their Naʼvi dialogue without unreasonable difficulty.  The language in its final form contains several elements which are uncommon in human languages, such as [[Grammatical conjugation|verbal conjugation]] using [[infix]]es.  All Naʼvi linguistic elements are found in human languages, but the combination is unique.

===Phonology and orthography===
Naʼvi lacks [[voiced plosive]]s like {{IPAblink|b}} {{IPAblink|d}} {{IPAblink|ɡ}}, but has the [[ejective consonant]]s {{IPAblink|pʼ}} {{IPAblink|tʼ}} {{IPAblink|kʼ}}, which are spelled ''px, tx, kx.'' It also has the [[syllabic consonant]]s ''ll'' and ''rr''.  There are seven vowels, ''a ä e i ì o u.'' Although all the sounds were designed to be pronounceable by the human actors of the film, there are unusual [[consonant cluster]]s, as in ''fngap'' {{IPA-art|fŋap|}} "metal".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.to/archives/4560/ "Na'vi, la langue d'Avatar"], ''L'express,'' 1 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Naʼvi syllables may be as simple as a single vowel, or as complex as ''skxawng'' "moron" or ''fngap'' above (both [[consonant|C]]C[[vowel|V]]C).

The fictional language Naʼvi of Pandora is unwritten. However, the actual (studio) language is written in the [[Latin script]] for the actors of ''Avatar''. Some words include: ''zìsìt'' "year", ''fpeio'' "ceremonial challenge", ''’awve'' "first" (''’aw'' "one"), ''muiä'' "fair", ''tireaioang'' "spirit animal", ''tskxe'' "rock", ''kllpxìltu'' "territory", ''uniltìrantokx'' "avatar" (dream-walk-body).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.delawareonline.com/article/20091206/ENTERTAINMENT/912060309/1114/entertainment |title=Linguist shapes alien tongue |work=[[The News Journal|DelawareOnline.com]] |first=Geoff |last=Boucher |date=December 6, 2009 |accessdate=February 11, 2012}}{{dead link|date=February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vowels====
There are seven monophthong vowels:
{| class="wikitable IPA"
|-
! Type !! front !! back
|-
!rowspan=2|High
|''i'' [i] || rowspan=2|''u'' [u] &lt;br/&gt;~ [ʊ]
|-
|''ì'' [ɪ]
|-
!Middle
|''e'' [ɛ] || ''o'' [o]
|-
!Low
|''ä'' [æ] || ''a'' [a]
|}
There are additionally four [[Diphthong|diphthongs]]: aw [aw], ew [εw], ay [aj], ey [εj], and two syllabic consonants: ll [l̩] and rr [r̩], which mostly behave as vowels.

Note that the ''e'' is open-mid while the ''o'' is close-mid, and that there is no ''*oy.'' The ''rr'' is strongly [[Trill consonant|trill]]ed, and the ''ll'' is "light", never a "dark" ([[velarisation|velarized]]) {{IPA|*[ɫ̩]}}.

These vowels may [[hiatus (linguistics)|occur in sequences]], as in the [[Polynesian languages]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. Each vowel counts as a syllable, so that ''tsaleioae'' has six syllables, {{IPA|[tsa.lɛ.i.o.a.e]}}, and ''meoauniaea'' has eight, {{IPA|[mɛ.o.a.u.ni.a.ɛ.a]}}.

Naʼvi does not have vowel length or tone, but it does have contrastive [[stress (phonetics)|stress]]: ''túte'' "person", ''tuté'' "female person". Although stress may move with [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]], as here, it is not affected by [[inflection]] (case on nouns, tense on verbs, etc.). So, for example, the verb ''lu'' ("to be") has stress on its only vowel, the ''u,'' and no matter what else happens to it, the stress stays on that vowel: ''lolú'' "was" (''l{{angle bracket|ol}}u''), ''lolängú'' "was (ugh!)" (''l{{angle bracket|ol}}{{angle bracket|äng}}u''), etc.

====Consonants====
There are twenty consonants. There are two Latin transcriptions: one that more closely approaches the ideal of one letter per [[phoneme]], with the ''c'' and ''g'' for {{IPA|[ts]}} and {{IPA|[ŋ]}} (the values they have in much of Eastern Europe and Polynesia, respectively), and a modified transcription used for the actors, with the digraphs ''ts'' and ''ng'' used for those sounds. In both transcriptions, the [[ejective consonant]]s are written with digraphs in ''x,'' a convention that appears to have no external inspiration.

{| class="wikitable IPA" style="text-align: center;"
! Type
! [[labial consonant|Labial]]
! [[alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]
! [[palatal consonant|Palatal]]
! [[velar consonant|Velar]]
! [[glottal consonant|Glottal]]
|-
! [[ejective consonant|Ejective]]
| ''px'' [pʼ]
| ''tx'' [tʼ]
|
| ''kx'' [kʼ]
|
|-
! [[plosive consonant|Plosive]]
| ''p'' [p]
| ''t'' [t]
|
| ''k'' [k]
| ''ʼ'' [ʔ]
|-
! [[Affricate]]
|
| ''ts (c)'' [ts]
|
|
|
|-
! [[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]
| ''f'' [f]&lt;br/&gt;''v'' [v]
| ''s'' [s]&lt;br/&gt;''z'' [z]
|
|
| ''h'' [h]
|-
! [[Nasal stop|Nasal]]
| ''m'' [m]
| ''n'' [n]
|
| ''ng (g)'' [ŋ]
|
|-
! [[Approximant consonant|Liquid/glide]]
| ''w'' [w]
| ''r'' [r]&lt;br/&gt;''l'' [l]
| ''y'' [j]
|
|
|}

The fricatives and the affricate, ''f v ts s z h'', are restricted to the onset of a syllable; the others may occur at the beginning or at the end (though ''w y'' in final position are considered parts of diphthongs, as they only occur as ''ay ey aw ew'' and may be followed by another final consonant, as in ''skxawng'' "moron"). However, in addition to appearing before vowels, ''f ts s'' may form [[consonant cluster]]s with any of the unrestricted consonants (the [[plosive]]s and [[approximant|liquids/glides]]) apart from ''’'', making for 39 clusters. Other sequences occur across syllable boundaries, such as ''Naʼvi'' {{IPA|[naʔ.vi]}} and ''ikran'' {{IPA|[ik.ɾan]}} "banshee".

The plosives ''p t k'' are [[tenuis consonant|tenuis]], as in Spanish or French. In final position, they have [[no audible release]], as in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and other languages of Southeast Asia. The ''r'' is [[flap consonant|flapped]], as in Spanish and Indonesian; it sounds a bit like the ''tt'' or ''dd'' in the American pronunciation of the words ''latter / ladder''.

====Sound change====
The plosives undergo [[lenition]] after certain [[prefix]]es and [[preposition]]s. The ejective consonants ''px tx kx'' become the corresponding plosives ''p t k''; the plosives and affricate ''p t ts k'' become the corresponding fricatives ''f s h''; and the glottal stop ''’'' disappears entirely. For example, the plural form of ''po'' "s/he" is ''ayfo'' "they", with the ''p'' weakening into an ''f'' after the prefix ''ay-.''

Lenition has its own significance when the plural prefix can optionally be omitted. In the above example, ''ayfo'' can be shortened to ''fo''. Similarly, the plural of ''tsmukan'' "brother" can be ''smukan'' (from ''aysmukan'').

===Grammar===
{{main|Na'vi grammar}}

Naʼvi has [[free word order]]. For example, the English "I see you" (a common greeting in Naʼvi), can be as follows in Naʼvi:

''Oel ngati kameie''

''Ngati oel kameie''

''Oel kameie ngati''

All forms of "I see you" in Naʼvi are completely correct. As sentences become more complex though, some words, like adjectives and negatives, will have to stay in a more or less fixed position in the sentence, depending on what the adjective or negative is describing.

"Today is a good day"

''Fìtrr lu sìltsana trr''

''Sìltsana trr fìtrr lu''

In this case, the adjective ''sìltsan(a)'' (good) will need to stay with the noun ''trr'' (day), therefore limiting the sentence to fewer combinations on the construction of the sentence, but as long as it follows or precedes the noun, the sentence is fine. By putting the attributive ''a'' before the adjective, the adjective can be put after the noun:

''Fìtrr lu trr asìltsan''

More information about this can be found in the ''Adjectives'' section.

====Nouns====
Nouns in Naʼvi show greater [[grammatical number|number]] distinctions than those in most human languages do: besides [[singular number|singular]] and [[plural number|plural]], they not only have special [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual]] forms for two of an item (eyes, hands, lovers, etc.), which are common in human language (English has a remnant in "both"), but also [[trial number|trial]] forms for three of an item, which on Earth are only found with pronouns. Gender is only occasionally (and optionally) marked.

The plural prefix is ''ay+,'' and the dual is ''me+.'' Both trigger lenition (indicated by the "+" signs rather than the hyphens that usually mark prefix boundaries). In nouns which undergo lenition, the plural prefix may be dropped, so the plural of ''tokx'' "body" is either ''aysokx'' or just ''sokx.''

[[gender (language)|Masculine and feminine]] nouns may be distinguished by suffix. There are no articles (words for "a" or "the").

Nouns are declined for [[grammatical case|case]] in a [[tripartite language|tripartite]] system, which is rare among human languages. In a tripartite system, there are distinct forms for the object of a clause, as in "he kicks &lt;u&gt;the ball&lt;/u&gt;"; the agent of a [[transitivity (grammatical category)|transitive]] clause which has such an object, as in "&lt;u&gt;he&lt;/u&gt; kicks the ball"; and the subject of an intransitive clause, which does not have an object, as in "&lt;u&gt;he&lt;/u&gt; runs". An object is marked with the [[accusative case|accusative]] suffix ''-ti,'' and an agent with the [[ergative case|ergative]] suffix ''-l'', while an [[intransitive case|intransitive subject]] has no case suffix. The use of such case forms leaves the [[word order]] of Naʼvi largely free.

There are two other cases—[[genitive case|genitive]] in ''-yä'', [[dative case|dative]] in ''-ru''—as well as a [[topic marker]] ''-ri''. The latter is used to introduce the topic of the clause, and is somewhat equivalent to Japanese ''wa'' and the much less common English "as for". It preempts the case of the noun: that is, when a noun is made topical, usually at the beginning of the clause, it takes the ''-ri'' suffix rather than the case suffix one would expect from its grammatical role. For example, in,

:{|
|-
|''Oe-ri''||''ontu''||''teya''||''l{{angle bracket|äng}}u''
|-
|I-[[topic marker|{{sc|top}}]]||nose||full||be{{angle bracket|[[Pejorative|{{sc|pej}}]]}}
|}
:"My nose is full (of his distasteful smell)", lit. "As for me, (my) nose is full"; since the topic is "I", the subject "nose" is associated with "me": That is, it's understood to be "my nose". "Nose" itself is unmarked for case, as it's the subject of the intransitive verb "to be". However, in most cases the genitive marker -yä is used for this purpose.

Besides case, the role of a noun in a clause may be indicated with [[adposition]]s. Any adposition may occur as either as a [[preposition]] before the noun, or as an [[enclitic]] after the noun, a greater degree of freedom than English allows. For example, "with you" may be either ''hu nga'' or ''ngahu''. When used as enclitics, they are much like the numerous cases found in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]. When used as prepositions, more along the lines of what English does, certain of them trigger lenition. One of the leniting prepositions is ''mì'' "in", as in ''mì sokx'' "in the body". This may cause some ambiguity with short plurals: ''mì sokx'' could also be short for ''mì aysokx'' "in the bodies".&lt;ref&gt;When ''mì'' is used as an enclitic, however, the noun is not lenited: ''tokxmì'' "in the body", ''sokxmì'' "in the bodies".&lt;/ref&gt;

Naʼvi pronouns encode [[clusivity]]. That is, there are different words for "we" depending on whether the speaker is including his/her addressee or not. There are also special forms for "the two of us" (with or without the addressee), "the three of us", etc. They do not inflect for gender; although it is possible to distinguish "he" from "she", the distinction is optional.

The deferential forms of "I" and "you" are ''ohe'' and ''ngenga''. Possessive forms include ''ngeyä'' "your" and ''peyä'' "her/his". "He" and "she" can optionally be differentiated as ''poan'' and ''poé''.

The grammatical distinctions made by nouns are also made by pronouns.

====Adjectives====
Naʼvi [[adjective]]s are uninflected—that is, they do not agree with the noun they modify—and may occur either before or after the noun. They are marked by a syllable ''a'', which is attached on the side closest to the noun. For example, "a long river" can be expressed either as,

:{|
|-
|''ngim-a''||''kilvan''
|-
|long-[[attributive|{{sc|attr}}]]||river
|}

or as,

:{|
|-
|''kilvan''||''a-ngim''
|-
|river||[[attributive|{{sc|attr}}]]-long
|}

The free word order holds for all attributives: Genitives (possessives) and [[relative clause]]s can also either precede or follow the noun they modify. The latter especially allows for great freedom of expression.

The [[attributive adjective|attributive]] affix ''a-'' is only used when an adjective modifies a noun. [[predicative adjective|Predicative]] adjectives instead take the "be" verb ''lu'':

:{|
|-
|''kilvan''||''ngim''||''lu''
|-
|river||long||be
|}
:"The river is long"

====Verbs====
Verbs are conjugated for [[grammatical tense|tense]] and [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], but not for [[grammatical person|person]]. That is, they record distinctions like "I am, I was, I would", but not like "I am, we are, s/he is". Conjugation relies exclusively on [[infix]]es, which are like suffixes but go inside the verb. "To hunt", for example, is ''taron'', but "hunted" is ''t{{angle bracket|ol}}aron'', with the infix ''{{angle bracket|ol}}''.

There are two positions for infixes: after the onset (optional consonant(s)) of the [[penult|penultimate syllable]], and after the onset of the final syllable. Because many Na’vi verbs have two syllables, these commonly occur on the first and last syllable. In monosyllabic words like ''lu'' "be", they both appear after the initial onset, keeping their relative order.

The first infix position is taken by infixes for tense, aspect, mood, or combinations thereof; also appearing in this position are [[participle]], [[reflexive verb|reflexive]], and [[causative]] forms, the latter two of which may co-occur with a tense/aspect/mood infix by preceding it. Tenses are [[past tense|past]], recent past, present (unmarked), [[future tense|future]], and immediate future; aspects are [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (completed or contained) and [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (ongoing or uncontained). The aspectual forms are not found in English but are somewhat like the distinction between 'having done' and 'was doing'.

:''taron'' [hunt] "hunts"
:''t{{angle bracket|ìm}}aron'' [hunt{{angle bracket|{{sc|rec}}}}] "just hunted"
:''t{{angle bracket|ay}}aron'' [hunt{{angle bracket|{{sc|fut}}}}] "will hunt"
:''t{{angle bracket|er}}aron'' [hunt{{angle bracket|{{sc|impv}}}}] "hunting"
:''t{{angle bracket|ol}}aron'' [hunt{{angle bracket|{{sc|pfv}}}}] "hunted"
:''t{{angle bracket|ì{{angle bracket|r}}m}}aron'' [hunt{{angle bracket|{{sc|rec}}{{angle bracket|{{sc|impv}}}}}}] "was just hunting"

Tense and aspect need not be marked when they can be understood by context or elsewhere in the sentence.

The second infix position is taken by infixes for [[affect (linguistics)|affect]] (speaker attitude, whether positive or negative) and for [[evidentiality]] (uncertainty or indirect knowledge). For example, in the greeting in the section on nouns, ''Oel ngati kameie'' "I See you", the verb ''kame'' "to See" is inflected positively as ''kam{{angle bracket|ei}}e'' to indicate the pleasure the speaker has in meeting you. In the subsequent sentence, ''Oeri ontu teya längu'' "My nose is full (of his smell)", however, the phrase ''teya lu'' "is full" is inflected pejoratively as ''teya l{{angle bracket|äng}}u'' to indicate the speaker's distaste at the experience. Examples with both infix positions filled:

:''t{{angle bracket|ìrm}}ar{{angle bracket|ei}}on'' [hunt{{angle bracket|{{sc|rec.impv}}}}{{angle bracket|{{sc|laud}}}}] "was just hunting": The speaker is happy about it, whether due to success or just the pleasure of the hunt
:''t{{angle bracket|ay}}ar{{angle bracket|äng}}on'' [hunt{{angle bracket|{{sc|fut}}}}{{angle bracket|{{sc|pej}}}}] "will hunt": The speaker is anxious about or bored by it

===Lexicon===
The Naʼvi language currently has over 2,000 words. These include a few English [[loan word]]s such as ''kunsìp'' "gunship". The published lexicon, including the odd inflectional form, is available online at https://eanaeltu.learnnavi.org/dicts/NaviDictionary.pdf. Additionally, the community at learnnavi.org is working with Dr. Frommer to further develop the language. Naʼvi is a very modular language and the total number of usable words far exceeds the 2,000 dictionary words. For example: ''rol'' "to sing" → ''tìrusol'' "the act of singing" or ''ngop'' "to create" → ''ngopyu'' "creator". Workarounds using existing words also abound in the Naʼvi corpus, such as ''eltu lefngap'' "metallic brain" for "computer" and ''palulukantsyìp'' "little thanator" for "cat".

The '''oath of office of the Vice President of the United States''' is the [[oath]] or [[Affirmation in law|affirmation]] that the [[Vice President of the United States]] takes upon assuming the vice-presidency but before he or she begins the execution of the office. Just before the [[president-elect]] takes the [[Oath of office of the President of the United States|oath of office]] on [[United States presidential inauguration|Inauguration Day]], the vice president-elect will step forward on the inaugural platform and repeat the oath of office. Although the [[United States Constitution]]—[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 8: Oath or affirmation|Article II, Section One, Clause 8]]—specifically sets forth the oath required by incoming presidents, it does not do so for incoming vice presidents. The constitution—[[Article Six of the United States Constitution#Oaths|Article VI, Clause 3]]— simply requires that they, along with all other government officers (federal and state; elected and appointed), pledge to support the Constitution. Since 1937, Inauguration Day has been January 20 (was March 4), a change brought about by the  [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|20th amendment to the Constitution]], which had been [[ratification|ratified]] four years earlier. The vice president's swearing-in ceremony also moved that year, from the [[United States Senate|Senate chamber]] inside the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], to the presidential inaugural platform outside the building.&lt;ref name="VPceremony"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inaugural.senate.gov/days-events/vice-presidents-swearing-in-ceremony|title=Vice President's Swearing-In Ceremony|publisher=The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies|access-date=January 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Text==
{{Quote| I, (state your name), do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|5|3331}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Background==

The [[1st United States Congress|1st Congress]] passed an [[An act to regulate the time and manner of administering certain oaths|oath act]] in May 1789, authorizing only U.S. senators to administer the oath to the vice president (who serves as the president of the Senate). Later that year, legislation passed that allowed courts to administer all oaths and affirmations. Since 1789, the oath has been changed several times by Congress. The present oath repeated by the vice president, senators, representatives, and other government officers has been in use since 1884.&lt;ref name="VPceremony"/&gt;

When the vice presidency was established in 1789, and for the century that followed, the Vice President was sworn in on the same date as the president, March 4, but at a separate location, typically in the [[United States Senate]], where he holds the office of President of the Senate. Up until the middle of the 20th Century, the Vice President-Elect nearly always would be sworn in by the highest-ranking officer of the US Senate which was the outgoing vice president or the President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate. Sometimes, although not always, a short address would be given by the new vice president to the Senate.

The oath of office has been administered most by the [[President Pro Tempore of the United States Senate]] (last in 1925) for a total of 20 times. Others to give the oath of office include the outgoing Vice President (last in 1945) 12 times, an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]] (last in 2017) 9 times, the [[Chief Justice of the United States]] (last in 2001) 6 times, [[U.S. Senators]] that are not President Pro Tempore of the Senate (last in 1969) 5 times, the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] (last in 2005) 4 times, a US judge twice, and a US Consul once with one time being unrecorded. Former Chief Justice [[Warren E. Burger]] has given the oath the most times with three.

Of the 59 times the Oath of Office has been administered, 47 times have been at some location in the [[United States Capitol]]. The [[White House]] has seen 3 oaths of office, and [[Congress Hall]] in Philadelphia twice. The following locations all had the oath administered once in that location: [[Federal Hall]], [[Old Brick Capitol]], [[Havana, Cuba]], a private residence in New York, and the [[Number One Observatory Circle]]. Reflecting the relative lack of importance of the office in the early 1800s, there are two instances where the location of the Vice President's oath of office is unknown.

Due to Vice President-elect William King's deteriorating health, a bill signed on March 3, 1853, the last day of the [[32nd United States Congress]], allowed for the oath to be administered to him as he rested in Cuba.

As an [[Old Testament]] Scholar, George's research works have been reviewed in the [[Toronto Journal of Theology]]&lt;ref&gt;Ellen White, ''Book Review of The Rod in the Old Testament'' in [[Toronto Journal of Theology]]'', Volume 21, Issue 2, September 2005.

{{quote|''George's thorough analysis of the terms for "Rod" has brought to light important nuances of meaning in the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] vocabulary, especially with regard to the principal words, ''מַטֶּה matteh'' and sḗbeṭ.  The insights uncovered by Dr. George's work offer valuable information for scholars involved in [[Bible translation]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] lexicography, and the study of the societal patterns in ancient Israel''}}

'''Palaung''', or in Chinese '''De'ang''', is a [[Mon–Khmer]] [[dialect cluster]] spoken by over half a million people in [[Burma]] ([[Shan State]]) and neighboring countries. The [[Palaung people]] are divided into Palé, Rumai, and Shwe, and each of these has their own language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peoplesoftheworld.org/text?people=Palaung|title=The Palaung|last=Ray Waddington|year=2003|publisher=The Peoples of the World Foundation|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Klose, Albrecht (2001) ''Sprachen der Welt: ein weltweiter Index der Sprachfamilien, Einzelsprachen und Dialekte, mit Angabe der Synonyma und fremdsprachigen Äquivalente'' (''Languages of the world: a multi-lingual concordance of languages, dialects and language-families'') Saur, Munich, Germany,  page 403, {{ISBN|3-598-11404-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Riang languages are reported to be unintelligible or only understood with great difficulty by native speakers of the other Palaung languages.

A total number of speakers is uncertain; there were 150,000 Shwe speakers in 1982, 272,000 Ruching (Palé) speakers in 2000, and 139,000 Rumai speakers at an unrecorded date.&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

==Dialects==

===Yan &amp; Zhou (2012)===
Chinese linguists classify "Deang 德昂" varieties (spoken mostly in Santaishan Ethnic Deang Township 三台山德昂族乡, [[Mangshi]] and Junnong Township 军弄乡, [[Zhenkang County]]) as follows (''Deangyu Jianzhi''). Names in [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] are from Yan &amp; Zhou (2012:154-155) &lt;ref&gt;Yan Qixiang [颜其香] &amp; Zhou Zhizhi [周植志] (2012). ''Mon-Khmer languages of China and the Austroasiatic family'' [中国孟高棉语族语言与南亚语系]. Beijing: Social Sciences Academy Press [社会科学文献出版社].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Bulei 布雷''' (''pu le'') (representative datapoint: Yunqian 允欠,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=98248&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mangshi]]): spoken in [[Luxi City|Luxi]]
**'''Bulei 布雷''' (''pu le'') dialect
**'''Raojin 饶进''' (''rau dʑĕŋ'') dialect
*'''Liang 梁''' (''liaŋ'') (representative datapoint: Xiaochanggou 硝厂沟): spoken in [[Longchuan County, Yunnan|Longchuan]] and [[Ruili]]
*'''Rumai 汝买''' (''ro mai'', ''ro rau mai'') (representative datapoint: Yechaqing 叶茶箐): spoken in [[Zhenkang County|Zhenkang]] and [[Baoshan, Yunnan|Baoshan]]

The Deang 德昂 variously refer themselves as ''naʔaŋ'', ''daʔaŋ'', ''toʔaŋ'', and ''laʔaŋ'', depending on the dialect (Yan &amp; Zhou 2012:154-155). Another Deang autonym is ''ho (rau) khaoʔ'', where ''rau'' means 'village'. The local [[Tai Neua language|Dai]] people refer to the Deang as ''po˧loŋ˧''.

Liu (2006)&lt;ref&gt;Liu Yan [刘岩] (2006). Tone in Mon-Khmer languages [孟高棉语声调研究]. Beijing: Minzu University Press [中央民族大学出版社].&lt;/ref&gt; documents 3 Palaungic lects, namely:
*Guangka Village, Mengxiu Township, Ruili City (瑞丽市勐休乡广卡村);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=96662&lt;/ref&gt; ''ru55 mai412''; tonal
*Mengdan Village, Santaishan Township (三台山勐丹村);&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynszxc.gov.cn/villagePage/vIndex.aspx?departmentid=98245&lt;/ref&gt; ''ʔaŋ''; non-tonal

===Ostapirat (2009)===
Weera Ostapirat (2009:74) classifies the Palaung languages as follows.&lt;ref&gt;Ostapirat, Weera. 2009. "[http://www.lc.mahidol.ac.th/lcjournal/FullPaper/JLC28-1-Weera-OS.pdf Some phonological criteria for Palaung subgrouping]". In ''Journal of Language and Culture'' Vol. 28 No. 1 (January – June 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; Defining [[sound change]]s are given in parentheses.

===Shintani (2008)===
[[Shintani Tadahiko|Shintani]] (2008) recognizes two dialects of Palaung, namely Southern Palaung and Northern Palaung. Southern Palaung unvoiced stops correspond to Northern Palaung voiced stops, the latter which Shintani (2008) believes to be retentions from Proto-Palaungic. Southern Palaung dialects studied by Shintani (2008) are those of:

*[[Kengtung]] town
*Waanpao village (near Kengtung)
*Chengphong village (near Kengtung)
*Loikhong village (near Mängpeng)
*Mängküng
*Yassaw
*[[Kalaw]]

===Deepadung, et al. (2015)===
Deepadung, et al. (2015)&lt;ref&gt;Deepadung, Sujaritlak; Supakit Buakaw; Ampika Rattanapitak. 2015. [http://www.mksjournal.org/mks44sujaritlak.pdf A Lexical Comparison of the Palaung Dialects Spoken in China, Myanmar, and Thailand]. ''Mon-Khmer Studies'' 44:19-38.&lt;/ref&gt; classify the Palaung dialects as follows.
;Palaung
*'''Ta-ang''': [[Namhsan]], Khun Hawt, Htan Hsan
*(core Palaung)
**'''Pule''': Pang Kham, Man Loi, Meng Dan, Chu Dong Gua
**'''Dara-ang''': Pan Paw, Noe Lae, Nyaung Gone, Pong Nuea (?), Xiang Cai Tang 香菜塘
**'''Rumai''': Nan Sang, Guang Ka, Mang Bang
**? Cha Ye Qing 茶叶箐

==Phonology==
Shorto (1960) lists the following consonants for Palaung:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Labials !! Dentals !! Palatals !! Velars !! Glottal
|-
| p || t || t͡ɕ || k || ʔ
|-
| b || d || d͡ʑ || g || 
|-
| m || n || ɲ || ŋ || 
|-
| v|| s ||  ||  || h
|-
|  || r,l || j ||  ||
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !!Front !! Central !! Back 
|-
| High || i||ɯ||u
|-
| Mid tense||e||||o 
|-
| Mid lax ||ɛ || ə||ɔ
|-
| Low|| ||  ||a
|}

According to Shorto (1960), /ə/ does not occur alone in primary stressed syllable, but only in an unstressed syllable or as the second member of a diphthong. There are also a large number of diphthongs, including /eo/, /eə/, /aə/, /ɔə/, /oə/, /uə/, and /iə/.

Although Milne (1921) includes the vowels /ü, ö, ɪ/ in her transcriptions, Shorto (1960) did not find these as vowel phonemes in his work.

(Note that the words cited below in the Syntax section come from Milne (1921), so their phonetic representations may need revision.)

==Syntax==

===Nouns and noun phrases===
The order of elements in the noun phrase is 
N - (possessor) - (demonstrative)

Consider the following examples:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| kwɔɔn||ai||öö
|-
|child||we two||this
|-
|colspan="10"|this child of ours
|}

===Prepositions and prepositional phrases===
Shwe Palaung has prepositions, as in the following example:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ta|| khuun|| hɔɔkhəm
|-
|to||great||king
|-
|colspan="10"| to the great king
|}

===Sentences===

Clauses in Shwe are generally in subject–verb–object (SVO) order:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| əən||dii||d͡ʒüür ||gaaŋ
|-
|he||future||buy||house 
|-
|colspan="10"|a baby cried

|}

==Text sample==

The following part of a story in Shwe Palaung is from Milne (1921:146-147)
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Naaŋ̩ ||rashööh,|| naaŋ|| jü|| grai|| ta|| khuun|| hɔɔkhəm|| naaŋ|| daah,

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8711">The '''Proclamation of Neutrality''' was a formal announcement issued by U.S. President [[George Washington]] on April 22, 1793 that declared the nation [[Country neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] in the [[French Revolutionary Wars|conflict between France and Great Britain]]. It threatened legal proceedings against any American providing assistance to any country at war.

== Background ==
News that [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] had declared war on Great Britain in February 1793, and with this declaration that France, by the country's own volition, was now at war with all of Europe, did not reach America until the first half of April of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin M.

Cengage Learning. p. 150. {{ISBN|978-1-337-29416-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; President Washington was at [[Mount Vernon (plantation)|Mount Vernon]] attending the funeral of a nephew when he was given the news.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Francis Jones, 2002. George Washington: Ordinary Man, Extraordinary Leader. Fordham Univ Press. p. 139. {{ISBN|978-0-8232-2187-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He hurried back to Pennsylvania and summoned a cabinet meeting on April 19. It was unanimously agreed to issue a proclamation "forbidding citizens to take part in any hostilities in the seas, on behalf of or against any of the belligerent powers."&lt;ref&gt;John Torrey Morse, 1876. The Life of Alexander Hamilton: By John T. Morse, Jr. Little, Brown, and Company. pp. 84–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cabinet debate===
Washington's members agreed that neutrality was essential; the nation was too young and its military was too small to risk any sort of engagement with either France or Britain. Secretary of State [[Thomas Jefferson]], in particular, saw in this question, as well as in the other twelve,{{which|date=July 2018}} the influence of the Federalists — his political rivals; yet he too agreed a proclamation was in order, though perhaps not an official one.

In a cabinet meeting of January 14th, Thomas Jefferson argued that while neutrality was a ''[[sine qua non]]'', there was no real need to make a Proclamation of Neutrality either immediately or even officially; perhaps there might be no need for an official declaration at all. The United States could declare its neutrality for a price, Jefferson intimated, "Why not stall and make countries bid for [American] neutrality?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Ron Chernow|Chernow, Ron]], ''Alexander Hamilton'' (Penguin, New York 2004) p. 435&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Secretary of the Treasury [[Alexander Hamilton]] declared that American neutrality was not negotiable.  Jefferson eventually resigned from his duty as Secretary of State in disagreement with the Proclamation of Neutrality.

===Declaration===
{{quote|By the President of the United States of America

A Proclamation

Whereas it appears that a state of war exists between [[Habsburg Monarchy | Austria]], [[Prussia]], [[Piedmont-Sardinia | Sardinia]], [[Kingdom of Great Britain | Great Britain]], and the [[Dutch Republic |United Netherlands]] of the one part and [[French Revolution | France]] on the other, and the duty and interest of the United States require that they should with sincerity and good faith adopt and pursue a conduct friendly and impartial toward the belligerent powers:

I have therefore thought fit by these presents to declare the disposition of the United States to observe the conduct aforesaid toward those powers respectively, and to exhort and warn the citizens of the United States carefully to avoid all acts and proceedings whatsoever which may in any manner tend to contravene such disposition.

And I do hereby also make known that whosoever of the citizens of the United States shall render himself liable to punishment or forfeiture under the law of nations by committing, aiding, or abetting hostilities against any of the said powers, or by carrying to any of them those articles which are deemed contraband by the modern usage of nations, will not receive the protection of the United States against such punishment or forfeiture; and further, that I have given instructions to those officers to whom it belongs to cause prosecutions to be instituted against all persons who shall, within the cognizance of the courts of the United States, violate the law of nations with respect to the powers at war, or any of them.

In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand. Done at the city of Philadelphia, the 22nd day of April, one thousand, seven hundred and ninety-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the seventeenth.

By the President:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proclamation 4 - Neutrality of the United States in the War Involving Austria, Prussia, Sardinia, Great Britain, and the United Netherlands Against France

== Pacificus-Helvidius debates ==
The proclamation started a war of pamphlets between Hamilton (writing for the Federalists), and Madison (writing for the Jeffersonian/Republicans). In his seven essays, written under the ''nom de plume'' "Pacificus", Hamilton dealt with objections to the proclamation. Among his arguments were:

* The decree was, in fact, constitutional; for while Congress has the sole right to declare war, it is "the duty of the executive to preserve peace till war is declared."&lt;ref&gt;"Pacificus No.1" June 29, 1793&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Neutrality Proclamation did not violate the United States' defensive alliance with France, as the Jeffersonians were claiming. The treaty, Hamilton pointed out, was a defensive alliance and did not apply to offensive wars, "and it was France that had declared war upon other European powers", not the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;Chernow, Ron, ''Alexander Hamilton'(Penguin Books, NY) 2004, p.442''&lt;/ref&gt;
* By siding with France the United States would have left itself open to attacks within American borders by the governments of Britain and Spain stirring up "numerous Indian tribes" influenced by these two governments.

Jefferson (having read several of the "Pacificus" essays) encouraged [[James Madison]] to reply. Madison was initially hesitant. From his Virginia plantation he offered Jefferson excuses as to why he could not write a reply, including that he didn't have the necessary books and papers to refute "Pacificus", that the summer heat was "oppressive", and that he had many houseguests who were wearing out their welcome.&lt;ref&gt;Chernow&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately Madison agreed to Jefferson's request, though afterwards he wrote to him, "I have forced myself in to the task of a reply. I can truly say I find it the most grating one I have ever experienced."&lt;ref name=Ketcham&gt;Ralph, Ketcham, ''James Madison''(University of Virginia Press 1971) p.436&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing under the name "Helvidius", Madison's five essays showed the animosity that had evolved with the two political factions. He attacked Federalists, and Hamilton in particular, and anyone who supported the Neutrality Proclamation as secret monarchists, declaring: "Several features with the signature of Pacificus were [as of] late published, which have been read with singular pleasure and applause by the foreigners and degenerate citizens among us, who hate our republican government and the French Revolution."&lt;ref name=Ketcham/&gt; Madison brought to light the strict constructionist's view of both the Constitution and the Proclamation, demanding that Congress, not the president, had full authority over all foreign affairs except those areas specified in the Constitution.

'''Psycholinguistics''' or '''psychology of language''' is the study of the interrelation between linguistic factors and psychological aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED521774.pdf|title=An introduction to psycholinguistics|last=Jodai|first=Hojat|date=June 2011|website=ERIC:ED521774|archive-url=|archive-date=August 2018|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also studies  [[psychology|psychological]] and [[neurobiology|neurobiological]] factors that enable [[human]]s to acquire, use, comprehend and produce [[language]]. The discipline is mainly concerned with the mechanisms in which languages are processed and represented in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Nordquist, Richard. "psycho-linguistics." ThoughtCo, Apr. 25, 2017, thoughtco.com/psycholinguistics-1691700.&lt;/ref&gt; Initial forays into psycholinguistics were largely philosophical or educational schools of thought, due mainly to their location in departments other than applied sciences (e.g., cohesive data on how the human brain functioned). Modern research makes use of [[biology]], [[neuroscience]], [[cognitive science]], [[linguistics]], and [[information science]] to study how the brain processes language, and less so the known processes of [[social sciences]], [[human development (psychology)|human development]], communication theories and [[infant development]], among others. There are a number of subdisciplines with non-invasive techniques for studying the neurological workings of the brain; for example, [[neurolinguistics]] has become a field in its own right.

Psycholinguistics has roots in education and philosophy, and covers the "cognitive processes" that make it possible to generate a grammatical and meaningful [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] out of [[vocabulary]] and [[grammar|grammatical structures]], as well as the processes that make it possible to understand utterances, words, [[writing|text]], etc. Developmental psycholinguistics studies children's ability to learn language.

==Origin of term==
The term ''psycholinguistics'' was coined in 1936 by [[Jacob Robert Kantor]] in his book ''An Objective Psychology of Grammar'' and started being used among his team at [[Indiana University]], but its use finally became frequent thanks to the 1946 article "Language and psycholinguistics: a review," by his student Nicholas Henry Pronko.&lt;ref&gt;Pronko, N. H. (1946). Language and psycholinguistics: a review. ''Psychological Bulletin'', 43, May, 189-239.&lt;/ref&gt; It was used for the first time to talk about an interdisciplinary science "that could be coherent"&lt;ref&gt;Levelt, W. J. M. (2013). ''A History of Psycholinguistics: the pre-Chomskyan era''. Part 1. Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-965366-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the title of ''Psycholinguistics: A Survey of Theory and Research Problems'', a 1954 book by [[Charles E. Osgood]] and [[Thomas A. Sebeok]].&lt;ref&gt;Murray, D. J. (2001). Language and psychology: 19th-century developments outside the Germany: A Survey (pp. 1679-1692). En S. Auroux (Ed.), ''Geschichte der Sprachwissenschaften (vol. 2 History of the Language Sciences: An International Handbook on the Evolution of the Study of Language from the Beginnings to the Present''. (Ill.) Berlin: Walter de Gruyter. 911 pp. {{ISBN|3110167352}})''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of study==
Psycholinguistics is an interdisciplinary field. Hence, it is studied by researchers from a variety of different backgrounds, such as psychology, [[cognitive science]], linguistics, and [[speech and language pathology]]. Psycholinguists study many different topics, but these topics can generally be divided into answering the following questions: (1) how do children acquire language ([[language acquisition]])?; (2) how do people process and comprehend language (language comprehension)?; (3) how do people produce language (language production)?; and (4) how do people acquire a new language ([[second language acquisition]])?

Subdivisions in psycholinguistics are also made based on the different components that make up human [[language]].

Linguistics-related areas:
* [[Phonetics]] and [[phonology]] are concerned with the study of speech sounds. Within psycholinguistics, research focuses on how the brain processes and understands these sounds.
* [[Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]] is the study of word structures, especially the relationships between related words (such as ''dog'' and ''dogs'') and the formation of words based on rules (such as plural formation).
* [[Syntax]] is the study of the patterns which dictate how words are combined to form sentences.
* [[Semantics]] deals with the [[meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of words and sentences. Where syntax is concerned with the formal structure of sentences, semantics deals with the actual meaning of sentences.
* [[Pragmatics]] is concerned with the role of [[context (language use)|context]] in the interpretation of meaning.

A researcher interested in language comprehension may study [[word]] recognition during [[reading (activity)|reading]] to examine the processes involved in the extraction of [[orthography|orthographic]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[phonological]], and [[semantic]] information from patterns in printed text. A researcher interested in language production might study how words are prepared to be spoken starting from the conceptual or semantic level. Developmental psycholinguists study infants' and children's ability to learn and process language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Houston|first=D.M.|author2=Jusczyk, P.W. |title=The Role of Talker-Specific Information in Word Segmentation by Infants|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Perception and Performance|year=2000|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1570–1582|doi=10.1037/0096-1523.26.5.1570|url=http://www.iupui.edu/~babytalk/pdfs/Houston_2011.pdf|accessdate=1 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005004725/http://www.iupui.edu/~babytalk/pdfs/Houston_2011.pdf|archivedate=5 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
In this section, some influential theories are discussed for each of the fundamental questions listed in the section above.

===Language acquisition===
{{Main|Language acquisition}}
There are essentially two schools of thought as to how children acquire or learn language, and there is still much debate as to which theory is the correct one. The first theory states that all language must be learned by the child.  The second view states that the abstract system of language cannot be learned, but that humans possess an innate language faculty, or an access to what has been called [[universal grammar]]. The view that language must be learned was especially popular before 1960 and is well represented by the [[Mentalism (psychology)|mentalistic]] theories of [[Jean Piaget]] and the empiricist [[Rudolf Carnap]]. Likewise, the school of psychology known as [[behaviorism]] (see [[Verbal Behavior]] (1957) by [[B.F. Skinner]]) puts forth the point of view that language is a behavior shaped by conditioned response, hence it is learned.

The innatist perspective began with [[Noam Chomsky]]'s highly critical review of Skinner's book in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chomsky |first=N |year=1959 |title=A Review of B. F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior |journal=Language |issn=0097-8507 |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=26–58 |doi=10.2307/411334 |publisher=Linguistic Society of America |last2=Skinner |first2=B. F. |jstor=411334}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review helped to start what has been termed "the [[cognitive revolution]]" in psychology.  Chomsky posited humans possess a special, innate ability for language and that complex syntactic features, such as [[recursion]], are "hard-wired" in the brain. These abilities are thought to be beyond the grasp of the most intelligent and social non-humans. According to Chomsky, children acquiring a language have a vast search space to explore among all possible human grammars, yet at the time there was no evidence that children receive sufficient input to learn all the rules of their language (see [[poverty of the stimulus]]). Hence, there must be some other innate mechanism that endows a language ability to humans. Such a language faculty is, according to the [[innateness hypothesis]], what defines human language and makes it different from even the most sophisticated forms of animal communication.

The field of linguistics and psycholinguistics since then has been defined by reactions to Chomsky, pro and con. The pro view still holds that the human ability to use language (specifically the ability to use recursion) is qualitatively different from any sort of animal ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hauser M.D. |author2=Chomsky N. |author3=Fitch W. | journal=Science | volume=298 | issue=5598 | pages=1569–79|doi=10.1126/science.298.5598.1569| year=2002 | pmid=12446899 | title=The faculty of language: what is it, who has it, and how did it evolve?}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ability may {{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} have resulted from a favorable mutation or from an adaptation of skills evolved for other purposes. The view that language can be learned has had a recent resurgence inspired by [[emergentism]]. This view challenges the "innate" view as scientifically unfalsifiable; that is to say, it can't be tested. With the amount of computer power increasing since the 1980s, researchers have been able to simulate language acquisition using neural network models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Rethinking innateness: A connectionist perspective on development | last=Elman |first=Jeffrey |author2=Bates Elizabeth |author3=Johnson Mark |author4=Karmiloff-Smith Annette |author5=Parisi Domenico |author6=Plunkett Kim | year=1998 | publisher=The MIT Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These models provide evidence that there may, in fact, be sufficient information contained in the input to learn language, even syntax. If this is true, then an innate mechanism is no longer necessary to explain language acquisition.

===Language comprehension===
{{Main|Language comprehension}}
One question in the realm of language comprehension is how people understand sentences as they read (also known as [[sentence processing]]). Experimental research has spawned a number of theories about the architecture and mechanisms of sentence comprehension. Typically these theories are concerned with what types of information contained in the sentence the reader can use to build meaning, and at what point in reading does that information become available to the reader. Issues such as "[[modularity of mind|modular]]" versus "interactive" processing have been theoretical divides in the field.

A modular view of sentence processing assumes that the stages involved in reading a sentence function independently in separate modules. These modulates have limited interaction with one another. For example, one influential theory of sentence processing, the garden-path theory,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Making and correcting errors during sentence comprehension: Eye movements in the analysis of structurally ambiguous sentences | author=Frazier L. | author2=Rayner, K. | journal=Cognitive Psychology | volume=14 | issue=2 | pages=178–210 | year=1982 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(82)90008-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that syntactic analysis takes place first. Under this theory as the reader is reading a sentence, he or she creates the simplest structure possible in order to minimize effort and cognitive load. This is done without any input from semantic analysis or context-dependent information. Hence, in the sentence "The evidence examined by the lawyer turned out to be unreliable," by the time the reader gets to the word "examined" he or she has committed to a reading of the sentence in which the evidence is examining something because it is the simplest parse. This commitment is made despite the fact that it results in an implausible situation; we know from experience that evidence can rarely if ever examine something. Under this "syntax first" theory, semantic information is processed at a later stage. It is only later that the reader will recognize that he or she needs to revise the initial parse into one in which "the evidence" is being examined. In this example, readers typically recognize their misparse by the time they reach "by the lawyer" and must go back and re-parse the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The interaction of syntax and semantics during sentence processing: Eye movements in the analysis of semantically biased sentences |author1=Rayner K. |author2=Carlson M. |author3=Frazier L. | journal=Journal of verbal learning and verbal behavior | volume=22 |issue=3 | pages=358–374 | year=1983 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(83)90236-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This reanalysis is costly and contributes to slower reading times.

In contrast to a modular account, an interactive theory of sentence processing, such as a [[Constraint-based grammar|constraint-based]] lexical approach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Toward a lexical framework of constraint-based syntactic ambiguity resolution |author1=Trueswell J. |author2=Tanenhaus M. | journal=Perspectives on sentence processing | pages=155–179 | year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; assumes that all available information contained within a sentence can be processed at any time. Under an interactive account, for example, the semantics of a sentence (such as plausibility) can come into play early on in order to help determine the structure of a sentence. Hence, in the sentence above, the reader would be able to make use of plausibility information in order to assume that "the evidence" is being examined instead of doing the examining. There are data to support both modular and interactive accounts; which account is the correct one is still up for debate.

===Language production===
{{Main|Language production}}
Language production concerns how people produce language, either in written or spoken form, in a way that conveys meanings comprehensible to others. One of the most effective ways to explain the way people represent meanings using rule-governed languages is by observing and analyzing instances of [[speech errors]]. They include speech dysfluencies like false starts, repetition, reformulation and constant pauses in between words or sentences; also, slips of tongue, like blendings, substitutions, exchanges (e.g. [[Spoonerism]]), and various pronunciation errors. These speech errors yield significant implication on language production, in that they reflect that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=V.|first=Fromkin,|date=1973|title=Speech errors as linguistic evidence|url=http://hdl.handle.net/11858/00-001M-0000-002B-2D04-D|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Speech is planned in advance: speech errors like substitution and exchanges show that one does not plan his/her entire sentence before s/he speaks. Rather, their language faculty is constantly tapped during the speech production process. This is accounted for by the limitation of the working memory. In particular, errors involving exchanges imply that one plans ahead in their sentence but only about significant ideas (e.g. the words that constitute the core meaning) and only to a certain extent of the sentence.
# Lexicon is organized semantically and phonologically: substitution and pronunciation errors show that lexicon is organized not only by its meaning, but also its form.
# Morphologically complex words are assembled: errors involving blending within a word reflect that there seems to be a rule governing the construction of words in production (and also likely in mental lexicon). In other words, speakers generate the morphologically complex words by merging morphemes rather than retrieving them as chunks.
It is useful to differentiate between three separate phases of production: conceptualization "(determining what to say), formulation (translating the intention to say something into linguistic form), and execution (the detailed articulatory planning and articulation itself)."&lt;ref name="Psycholinguistics"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/846651282|title=Psycholinguistics.|date=2011|publisher=SAGE|others=Harley, Trevor A.|isbn=9781446263013|location=Los Angeles, Calif.|oclc=846651282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most psycholinguistic research has largely concerned itself with the study for formulation because the phase of conceptualization largely remains an elusive and mysterious period of development.&lt;ref name="Psycholinguistics"/&gt;

For models of speech production, see [[v:Psycholinguistics/Models of Speech Production|Psycholinguistics/Models of Speech Production]].

==Methodologies==

===Behavioral tasks===
Many of the experiments conducted in psycholinguistics, especially earlier on, are behavioral in nature. In these types of studies, subjects are presented with linguistic stimuli and asked to perform an action. For example, they may be asked to make a judgment about a word ([[lexical decision task|lexical decision]]), reproduce the stimulus, or name a visually presented word aloud. Reaction times to respond to the stimuli (usually on the order of milliseconds) and proportion of correct responses are the most often employed measures of performance in behavioral tasks. Such experiments often take advantage of [[priming (psychology)|priming effects]], whereby a "priming" word or phrase appearing in the experiment can speed up the lexical decision for a related "target" word later.&lt;ref name="packard"/&gt;

As an example of how behavioral methods can be used in psycholinguistics research, Fischler (1977) investigated word encoding using the lexical decision task. He asked participants to make decisions about whether two strings of letters were English words. Sometimes the strings would be actual English words requiring a "yes" response, and other times they would be nonwords requiring a "no" response. A subset of the licit words were related semantically (e.g., cat-dog) while others were unrelated (e.g., bread-stem). Fischler found that related word pairs were responded to faster when compared to unrelated word pairs. This facilitation suggests that semantic relatedness can facilitate word encoding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Semantic facilitation without association in a lexical decision task | author=Fischler I. | journal=Memory &amp; Cognition |volume=5 |  issue=3 | pages=335–339 | year=1977 | doi=10.3758/bf03197580}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eye-movements===
Recently, [[eye tracking]] has been used to study online language processing. Beginning with Rayner (1978)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Rayner K. | title=Eye movements in reading and information processing |journal=Psychological Bulletin | year=1978 | volume=85 |pages=618–660 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.85.3.618 | pmid=353867 | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the importance and informativity of eye-movements during reading was established. Later, Tanenhaus et al. (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tanenhaus M. K. |author2=Spivey-Knowlton M. J. |author3=Eberhard K. M. |author4=Sedivy J. E. | year=1995 | title=Integration of visual and linguistic information in spoken language comprehension|journal=Science |volume=268 |pages=1632–1634 | doi=10.1126/science.7777863 | pmid=7777863 | issue=5217}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the visual-world paradigm to study the cognitive processes related to spoken language. Assuming that eye movements are closely linked to the current focus of attention, language processing can be studied by monitoring eye movements while a subject is presented auditorily with linguistic input.

===Language production errors===
{{Main|Speech error}}
The [[Error analysis (linguistics)|analysis]] of systematic [[Speech error|errors in speech]], writing and [[Typographical error|typing]] of language as it is produced can provide evidence of the process which has generated it.  Errors of speech, in particular, grant insight into how the mind processes language production while a speaker is in the midst of an utterance. Speech errors tend to occur in the [[lexeme|lexical]], [[morpheme]], and [[phoneme]] encoding steps of language production, as seen by the ways errors can manifest.&lt;ref name="linguisticsociety1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linguisticsociety.org/resource/slips-tongue-windows-mind|title=Slips of the Tongue: Windows to the Mind {{!}} Linguistic Society of America|website=www.linguisticsociety.org|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The types of speech errors, and some examples, are:&lt;ref name="linguisticsociety1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/linguistics/lectures/05lect16.html|title=Lecture No. 16 -- Speech Errors|website=www.departments.bucknell.edu|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omniglot.com/language/articles/speecherrors.htm|title=Speech Errors and What They Reveal About Language|website=www.omniglot.com|access-date=2017-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Substitutions (phoneme and lexical) – replacing a sound with an unrelated sound, or a word with an antonym, and saying "verbal&amp;nbsp;'''outfit'''" instead of "verbal&amp;nbsp;output", or "He rode his bike&amp;nbsp;'''tomorrow'''" instead of "...yesterday", respectively,
* Blends – mixing two synonyms together and saying "my&amp;nbsp;'''stummy'''&amp;nbsp;hurts" in place of either "stomach" or "tummy",
* Exchanges (phoneme [a.k.a. [[Spoonerism]]s] and morpheme) – swapping two onset sounds or two root words, and saying "You&amp;nbsp;'''h'''issed my&amp;nbsp;'''m'''ystery lectures" instead of "You&amp;nbsp;missed my&amp;nbsp;history lectures", or "They're&amp;nbsp;'''Turk'''ing&amp;nbsp;'''talk'''ish" instead of "They're&amp;nbsp;talking&amp;nbsp;Turkish", respectively,
* Morpheme shifts – moving a function morpheme such as "-ly" or "-ed" to a different word and saying "easy enough'''ly'''" instead of "easily&amp;nbsp;enough",
* Perseveration – continuing to start a word with a sound that was in the utterance previously and saying "John&amp;nbsp;'''g'''ave the&amp;nbsp;'''g'''oy a ball" instead of "John gave the&amp;nbsp;boy a ball", and
* Anticipation – replacing a sound with one that is coming up later in the utterance and saying "She drank a '''c'''ot '''c'''up of tea" instead of "She drank a &lt;u&gt;h&lt;/u&gt;ot cup of tea."

Speech errors will usually occur in the stages that involve lexical, morpheme, or phoneme encoding, and usually not the first step of [[Encoding (memory)#Semantic encoding|semantic encoding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Speech Errors as Linguistic Evidence|last=Fromkin|first=Victoria A.|publisher=Mouton &amp; Co. N. V.|year=1973|isbn=|location=The Netherlands|pages=157–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;This can be credited to how a speaker is still conjuring the idea of what to say, and unless he changes his mind, can not be mistaken in what he wanted to say.

===Neuroimaging===
{{main|Neurolinguistics}}
Until the recent advent of [[non-invasive]] medical techniques, brain surgery was the preferred way for language researchers to discover how language works in the brain. For example, severing the [[corpus callosum]] (the bundle of nerves that connects the two hemispheres of the brain) was at one time a treatment for some forms of [[epilepsy]]. Researchers could then study the ways in which the comprehension and production of language were affected by such drastic surgery. Where an illness made brain surgery necessary, language researchers had an opportunity to pursue their research.

Newer, non-invasive techniques now include brain imaging by [[positron emission tomography]] (PET); [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI); [[event-related potentials]] (ERPs) in [[electroencephalography]] (EEG) and [[magnetoencephalography]] (MEG); and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] (TMS). Brain imaging techniques vary in their spatial and temporal resolutions (fMRI has a resolution of a few thousand neurons per pixel, and ERP has millisecond accuracy). Each type of methodology presents a set of advantages and disadvantages for studying a particular problem in psycholinguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aguirre|first=Geoffrey K.|date=2014-03-01|title=Functional Neuroimaging: Technical, Logical, and Social Perspectives|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hast.294/abstract|journal=Hastings Center Report|language=en|volume=44|issue=s2|pages=S8–S18|doi=10.1002/hast.294|issn=1552-146X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computational modeling===
Computational modelling, such as the [[Dual-route hypothesis to reading aloud|DRC model]] of reading and word recognition proposed by [[Max Coltheart]] and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Coltheart M. |author2=Rastle K. |author3=Perry C. |author4=Langdon R. |author5=Ziegler J. | year = 2001 | title = DRC: "A dual route cascaded of visual word recognition and reading aloud | url = | journal = Psychological Review | volume = 108 | issue = 1| pages = 204–256 | doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.1.204 | pmid=11212628}}&lt;/ref&gt; is another methodology and refers to the practice of setting up cognitive models in the form of executable computer programs. Such programs are useful because they require theorists to be explicit in their hypotheses and because they can be used to generate accurate predictions for theoretical models that are so complex that they render [[discursive psychology|discursive analysis]] unreliable. Other examples of computational modelling is [[James McClelland (psychologist)|McClelland]] and [[Jeff Elman|Elman's]] [[Trace (psycholinguistics)|TRACE]] model of speech perception&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = McClelland | first1 = J.L. | last2 = Elman | first2 = J.L. | year = 1986 | title = The TRACE model of speech perception | url = | journal = Cognitive Psychology | volume = 18 | issue = | pages = 1–86 | doi=10.1016/0010-0285(86)90015-0 | pmid=3753912}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Franklin Chang's Dual-Path model of sentence production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chang|first=Franklin|date=2002-09|title=Symbolically speaking: a connectionist model of sentence production|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15516709cog2605_3|journal=Cognitive Science|volume=26|issue=5|pages=609–651|doi=10.1207/s15516709cog2605_3|issn=0364-0213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issues and areas of research==
Psycholinguistics is concerned with the nature of the computations and processes that the brain undergoes to comprehend and produce language. For example, the [[cohort model]] seeks to describe how words are retrieved from the [[lexicon|mental lexicon]] when an individual hears or sees linguistic input.&lt;ref name="packard"&gt;[[Jerome Packard|Packard, Jerome L]] (2000). "Chinese words and the lexicon." ''The Morphology of Chinese: A Linguistic and Cognitive Approach''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. pp. 284-309.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Altmann, Gerry T.M. (1997). "Words, and how we (eventually) find them." ''The Ascent of Babel: An Exploration of Language, Mind, and Understanding''. Oxford: Oxford University Press. pp. 65-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research using new [[non-invasive]] imaging techniques seeks to shed light on just where certain language processes occur in the brain.

There are a number of unanswered questions in psycholinguistics, such as whether the human ability to use syntax is based on innate mental structures or emerges from interaction with other humans, and whether some animals can be taught the syntax of human language.

Two other major subfields of psycholinguistics investigate [[first language acquisition]], the process by which infants acquire language, and [[second language acquisition]]. In addition, it is much more difficult for adults to acquire [[second language]]s than it is for infants to learn their first language (bilingual infants are able to learn both of their native languages easily). Thus, [[critical period|sensitive periods]] may exist during which language can be learned readily.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (1982). ''Ethnicity, Language, and Power from a Psycholinguistic Perspective.'' Bruxelles: Centre de recherche sur le pluralinguisme. pp. 4-7.&lt;/ref&gt; A great deal of research in psycholinguistics focuses on how this ability develops and diminishes over time. It also seems to be the case that the more languages one knows, the easier it is to learn more.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (1982). ''Ethnicity, Language, and Power from a Psycholinguistic Perspective.'' Bruxelles: Centre de recherche sur le pluralinguisme. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of [[aphasiology]] deals with language deficits that arise because of brain damage. Studies in aphasiology can both offer advances in therapy for individuals suffering from aphasia, and further insight into how the brain processes language.

'''Sasidharan Arattuvazhi''' was a [[Malayalam]] [[playwright]] and [[screenwriter]]. Within a career spanning more than two decades, he wrote 20 screenplays and 12 plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screenindia.com/old/20010209/rehap.htm|author=|title=Sasidharan Aarattuvazhi: The interview that never happened|work=|publisher=''[[Screen India]]''|date=February 9, 2002 |accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Sasi was born at Arattuvazhi in [[Alappuzha district]] as the son of Arjunan Pillai. He liked writing plays while still only in school. His first professional stage play was ''Kolayaali'' (''The Murderer''). Later, when Sasi was studying at S. D. College, [[Alappuzha]], the craze for writing plays besieged him again. He wrote plays and sent them to the [[All India Radio]]. Sasi shifted home base to [[Thiruvananthapuram]], where he worked first as a journalist with magazines such as ''Kudumbakatha'' and ''Kuttikatha''. He then set up his own advertising agency, Primary Colours. He wrote some of his notable stage plays during this time. Inspired by various screenplays of [[M. T. Vasudevan Nair]], he developed a keen interest in writing screenplays for films. He made his flm debut with Kaladharan’s ''[[Nettipattam]]'' (1990). But the film failed both critically and commercially. He was then approached by [[Rajasenan]], for whom he wrote the family drama ''[[Ayalathe Adheham]]''. The film became a resounding hit. With this film, Sasi gained a place with the top-grade screenwriters of Malayalam. He went on to write screenplays for 18 more films, including the cult classic ''[[Yodha (1992 film)|Yoddha]]'', comic thriller ''[[CID Unnikrishnan B.A., B.Ed.]]'', family drama ''[[Kaliveedu]]'', and the hilarious ''Cheppadividya''.  ''Yoddha'', which released on 4 September 1992 is widely regarded as his master piece. The film became a landmark film in the history of [[Malayalam cinema]], with its story, scenes, characters and music gaining cult status.

Sasidharan Arattuvazhi died on 21 January 2001. He was 45.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rediff.com/movies/2001/jan/23sasi.htm|author=|title=Sasidharan Arattuvazhi passes away|work=|publisher=[[Rediff.com]]|date=January 23, 2001|accessdate=April 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was suffering from [[cirrhosis]], attributed by his heavy alcoholism. He is survived by his wife Sudhakutty and two daughters.

The '''South Asian Spelling Bee''' is an annual [[spelling bee]] platform in the United States for children of [[South Asian]] descent. It is an annual contest that tours the country each June and July in pursuit of the top two spellers from 12 cities nationwide.  The competition is open to any student in the between the ages of 8 and 14, who has at least one parent or grandparent who is of South Asian descent, or whose lineage can be traced to [[Afghanistan]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[India]], [[Maldives]], [[Nepal]], [[Pakistan]], and/or [[Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southasianspellingbee.com |title=South Asian Spelling Bee |publisher=South Asian Spelling Bee |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its launch in 2008, the South Asian Spelling Bee has been aired in over 120 countries on [[Sony Entertainment Television Asia]] as a multi-part series.

==Competition==
Regional competitions are held in major [[South Asian]] American hubs across the United States.  As of 2017, the ''[[Bee (gathering)|bee]] visits: the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], [[Dallas]], [[Chicago]], [[Seattle]], [[Charlotte, NC]], [[New Jersey]], the [[Washington Metropolitan Area]], and [[Boston]].  Spellers are enrolled by a parent or guardian to participate in any one regional contest.  ''The top three spellers from each regional contest are awarded cash prizes.  The winner and first runner-up in each of the regional contests are invited to participate in the national final, which takes place each August at [[Rutgers University]] in Piscataway, New Jersey.  The national champion is awarded a $3,000 grand prize scholarship presented by the title sponsor. 

== Media coverage ==
The South Asian Spelling Bee is featured across an array of South Asians-focused as well as mainstream media outlets.  Produced for broadcast on Sony Entertainment Television Asia, the regional contests and finals are aired worldwide each year.  
Many South Asian-focused [[newspapers]], feature coverage of the bee each season, from the season launch through the national finals.  In light of the successes of South Asian-American students when it comes to spelling contests, the South Asian Spelling Bee has gained recognition for its role in promoting academic talent.  In 2008, the Bee was noted by [[BBC News]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7443800.stm|title=South Asians top US spelling contests|publisher=BBC News |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate=2011-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an emerging platform geared specifically towards this audience
In 2010, the South Asian Spelling Bee was recognized by the [[Wall Street Journal]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704545004575353693299232142|title= Winning Bees Spells Glory for Indian Kids on the Ethnic Circuit|publisher= The Wall Street Journal |date=2010-07-14 |accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a leading academic contest for South Asian-American youth.

==Previous National Champions (since 2011)==
In 2011, Narahari Bharadwaj of Plano, Texas won the bee on the word "schindylesis." Bharadwaj placed 14th in the 2011 Scripps National Spelling Bee.
Syamantak Payra of Clear Creek, TX was crowned the 2012 champion on the word "dghaisa." Payra went on to the place 7th and 37th in the 2013 and 2014 Scripps National Spelling Bee(s), respectively.
Sriram Hathwar of Painted Post, NY, won the 2013 bee on "phorminx." Sriram has done well in Scripps as well, placing 6th in 2011, 3rd in 2013, and becoming co-champion of the 2014 Scripps National Spelling Bee (along with Ansun Sujoe). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Championship Finalists 2014|url=http://spellingbee.com/public/results/2014/finishers/html|website=Scripps National Spelling Bee|publisher=E.W. Scripps Company|accessdate=11 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were the first co-champs in 52 years. Sriram also competed at Scripps in 2008 (as a second grader) and 2009.
In 2014, Gokul Venkatachalam from Chesterfield, Missouri won on the word "becquerel"; he placed 3rd at Scripps earlier that year and tied for 1st place at the 2015 Scripps National Spelling Bee, which saw co-champions for the second year in a row. Vanya Shivashankar of Olathe, Kansas, the other champion, tied for runner up at SASB behind Gokul in 2014. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Championship Finalists 2015|url=http://spellingbee.com/public/results/2015/finishers/html|website=Scripps National Spelling Bee|publisher=E.W.

[[File:Center for the Study of the American South.jpg|thumb|The Love House and Hutchins Forum, location of the Southern Oral History Program.]]
The '''Southern Oral History Program''' (SOHP), located in the Love House and Hutchins Forum in the historic district of [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina]], is a research institution dedicated to collecting and preserving [[oral histories]] from across the [[southern United States]].

==History==
Founded in 1973 by [[Jacquelyn Dowd Hall]] and the History department of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] (UNC), the Southern Oral History Program is a part of UNC's [[Center for the Study of the American South]]. The SOHP is dedicated to the study of the American South as told by the many who lived, but did not write, history. The SOHP has collected over 4,000 [[oral history]] interviews with southerners who have made important contributions to various fields, been involved in specific historical movements, or lived through times of southern transformation. In the past 35 years, the Program has grown to become one of the more prominent collections of oral histories in the United States. Graduate students and faculty at UNC and the SOHP as well as independent researchers work to collect oral histories with the goal of "rendering historically visible those whose experience is not reflected in traditional written sources."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unc.edu/mss/inv/s/Southern_Oral_History_Program_Collection.html Finding aid for the SOHP at the Southern Historical Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

The SOHP is involved in many oral history outreach efforts, conducting workshops, aiding researchers interested in performing oral history interviews, and helping to promote the use of oral history in the classroom across North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sohp.org/outreach/index.html|title=Outreach at the SOHP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
All oral histories are stored in the archives at the [[Southern Historical Collection]] in the [[Wilson Round Library]] at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and are freely available to the public. Many interviews have not only audio but also full transcripts, abstracts, biographical forms on the interviewees, and field notes from the interviewers.  An [http://www.lib.unc.edu/mss/sohp_interviewee/ interview database] searchable by subject, project, interviewer, interviewee name, occupation, ethnicity, or interview number is available online. Traditionally, all oral histories have been accessible only on-site in the reading room of the Southern Historical Collection in Chapel Hill, N.C. However, a 2005 a grant-funded project, "[[Oral Histories of the American South]]" (OHAS), conducted by [[Documenting the American South]] began working to digitize 500 SOHP oral histories and provide online access to full audio, transcripts, and lesson plans for use of online oral histories in the classroom.

==Research==
Since 2001, much of the SOHP's research effort has been focused on the initiative "The Long Civil Rights Movement: The South Since the 1960s," which documents the history and evolution of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and other parallel movements in the South, such as the women's movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sohp.org/research/index.html|title=Research at the SOHP|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These interviews focus on three main areas: race and the public schools, economic justice, and gender and sexuality. In 2008, the SOHP received a $937,000 grant from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] to continue to collaborate in their efforts to produce civil rights movement scholarship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sohp.org/|title=Southern Oral History Program homepage|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SOHP projects by series==
Though the SOHP collects interviews from independent researchers across the South, most of the collection stems from field work conducted specifically by the SOHP. UNC faculty and students along with SOHP staff collect oral histories within the scope of specific interview series developed by the SOHP, listed below. Each series has a specific focus, and many contain sub-series.

*A. Southern Politics
*B. Individual Biographies

'''Sporting colours''', more often known merely as &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/colour|title=colour Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|language=en|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;''colours'' or ''house-colours'', are awarded to members of a university or school who have excelled in a sport.  Colours are traditionally worn in or on scarves, ties, blazers, gowns, cuff-links, and other items of apparel. The award system gives rise to phrases such as ''an Oxford Blue'', meaning a person who was awarded a [[Oxford Blue|Blue]] by the [[University of Oxford]]. Similarly a [[Cambridge Blue (colour)|Cambridge Blue]] is awarded by the [[University of Cambridge]]. ''Colours are not however, always known as 'a Blue'.''  A 'university sporting blue' is a generic term which stems from the Oxford and Cambridge Blue, but 'Colours' by definition may be any colour, and often reflect the colours associated with the school uniform, crest, or other significant semiotic.

In some award schemes, it is possible to receive a half colour, such as a Half-Blue. Typically, a given institution will award a single colour; for example, Cambridge and Oxford awards are different shades of blue, and the [[University of London]] awards a Purple.

American universities tend to award a [[varsity letter]] rather than a colour.

The system is common in the majority of British  [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep schools]], [[Independent school (UK)|independent schools]] and old schools of Australia, South African and Sri Lanka. Often [[blazer]]s are given to denote pupils who have achieved in a sport. The blazers are often distinct from the standard school blazer though often colours simply take the form of embellished arms or braided cord or ribbon edging on the standard blazer. Ties are also used as a common way of displaying representative ''colours''.

'''Thoppil Bhasi''' (8 April 1924 – 8 December 1992) was a [[Malayalam]] playwright, screenwriter, and film director. He was associated with the communist movement in [[Kerala]] and his play ''[[Ningalenne Communistakki]]'' (You Made Me a Communist) is considered to be a groundbreaking event in the history of Malayalam theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1810/18100700.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011230183653/http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1810/18100700.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 December 2001|title=Path-breaking plays|date=12 May 2001|work=Frontline|accessdate=16 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born '''Thoppil Bhaskara Pillai''', on 8 April 1924 at Vallikunnam in Alleppey district, Kerala, Bhasi was the eldest son of Thoppil Parameshwaran Pillai and Nanikkutti Amma.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://kpackerala.wordpress.com/2011/08/08/thoppil-bhasi-a-profile/ KPAC], Thoppil Bhasi | A Profile&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
His elementary education was at the [[SNDP]] [[Sanskrit]] School, and later on at the Sanskrit School, [[Changankulangara]], from where he graduated in the Sanskrit Shastri course. Knowing fully well his desire to learn indigenous medicine, his father had him enrolled at the [[Ayurveda College, Thiruvananthapuram]].  It was here that he spearheaded the Students' Agitation that led to installing many of the facilities and rights enjoyed by the current generation of students at the College of Ayurveda. He also graduated securing the Top Rank in the Vaidya Kalanidhi Examination.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

==Social life==
His deep and enduring friendship with [[Kambisseri Karunakaran]] that extended through all spheres of their lives, also saw them at the forefront of some of the most significant political agitations in central Kerala. Once a staunch supporter and activist of the [[Indian Congress party]], Thoppil Bhasi soon distanced himself from the same on matters of principles and found his direction in the neo movement of Communism via the [[Communist Party of India]]. He was associated with the communist movements that took place in Kerala during the 1940s and 1950s. Branded a Subversive and a Wanted Man by the government, he was on the run and went underground during the period of 1948–52, as a top priority suspect in the infamous [[Sooranad]] Incident, with a Rs 1000 bounty on his head. He was later acquitted, and went on to contest the first [[Panchayat]] elections in Kerala. He won, becoming the first president of the Vallikunnom panchayat. He was elected twice to the state assembly contesting the State elections, from [[Bharanikkavu]] in 1954 and [[Pathanamthitta]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="test" /&gt;

===KPAC, theatre and Malayalam films===
Thoppil Bhasi never contested any more elections post his 1957 win, to devote his entire energies to this new direction his life has set course on – theatre. He had written his first One-act play ''Munnettam'' (''The Advance'') while on the run from the state, and based on the feedback received from the underground collective, had revisited, refined and re-energised the plot from a different perspective, creating the historical Ningalenne Communistaakki, both under his pseudonym Soman, for fear of revealing his true identity. The drama helped [[Kerala People's Arts Club|KPAC]] to become a force to reckon with on Kerala's theatrical arena. Later,he wrote scripts for 110 [[Malayalam films]] starting from 'Mudiyanaya Puthran' in 1961,most of them mega hits.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

His association with KPAC started with the staging of Ningalenne Communistaakki, and the entire proceedings from the show were donated towards the attorney fees needed to free the rest of accused in the Soornad Incident.He wrote the play ''Ningalenne Communistakki'' while in hiding in connection with the Sooranad case, which resulted from a revolt by agricultural workers against a landlord. Bhasi had to write the play under the name, Soman. ''Ningalenne Communistakki'' was first staged (under the banner of [[Kerala People's Arts Club|KPAC]]) in [[Chavara]] in [[Kollam district]] on 6 December 1952.  He wrote 16 plays, for KPAC, each more spectacular and socially relevant than its predecessor and it used to be said in the 60s and 70s that there wasn't a day where at least one of his plays was not staged at any part of Kerala! Such was the influence of his creative power. From KPAC, he slowly moved to the film industry (some say it was a natural progression), authoring over 100 Screenplays and turned to directing 16 movies in Malayalam language, most of them box-office successes.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Thoppil Bhasi's wedding with Amminiamma, the niece of C Shankaranarayanan – ex-Speaker of the Kerala Legislative Assembly was solemnised when he was on the run, a wanted man for the government! In a moving tribute, aptly titled 'My Comrade', Amminiamma, amongst other nuggets, shares her husband's principle of simplicity and frugality in every aspect of his life. She recalls Udaya studio's Kunchacko asking her to buy him a new shirt as he was fed up of seeing Thoppil Bhasi in the same shirt every time! Thoppil Bhasi seems to have famously remarked, "Chackochen, I have 8 shirts of the same colour and type, and all eight have the same 'beedi-burn' patch at the left side of my breast-pocket !" He was the quintessential socialist, according to her. Thoppil Bhasi has 4 sons – Ajayan, Soman, Rajan and Suresh, and daughter Mala . Ajayan went on direct the award-winning Malayalam film [[Perumthachan (film)|Perumthachan]] in 1991.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
Thoppil Bhasi's dramas, Mudiyanaya Puthran and Puthiya Akasham, Puthiya Bhumi were awarded the Kerala Sahithya Academy Awards, and the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Academy awarded him its Fellowship in 1981. He is also the recipient of the Professor N Krishna Pillai Award and the SovietLand Nehru Award.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt; He also was awarded the [[Kerala State Film Award for Best Film]] for directing [[Sarasayya]] in 1971 and the [[Kerala State Film Award for Best Story]] for [[Mooladhanam]] in 1969.

==Literary works==
Thoppil Bhasi was prolific in terms of his creative output during his active years in theatre and movies. He authored 16 full-length plays, screenplays for over a 100 movies, directed 16 movies and his autobiography was titled, Oliviley Ormakal. He was a regular contributor to the Janayugom Magazine and short stories to various publications which are yet to be collated and archived.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

==Death==
Thoppil Bhasi died on 8 December 1992.&lt;ref name="test"/&gt;

==Selected books==
#''Ningalenne Communistakki'': a drama which has influenced the politics of Kerala.
#''Thulabharam'' and many screen plays.

In [[broadcasting]], '''traffic''' is the scheduling of program material, and in particular the advertisements, for the broadcast day. In a commercial radio or TV station there is a vital link between sales (of advertisement or commercial space) and traffic in keeping the information about commercial time availability.

The station sells airtime to its customers. It is not unusual in a single hour for 18–20 minutes to be commercials.

The traffic department together with sales aims to sell the available airtime ("avails") at the best possible rates. The traffic department generates a daily log of programming elements such as commercials, features and [[public service announcement]]s. The log defines when they are planned to be aired. The log will be used by the on-air operator who actually plays the commercials.  A copy of the log after the fact is used for reconciliation to determine what actually aired.

Typically a broadcaster uses a broadcast management software system that allows for automation between departments.  Some software systems are end-to-end and manage the whole spectrum of tasks required to broadcast a television or radio station, others specialize in specific areas, such as sales, programming, traffic, or automation for master control.

==Process==
The traffic process starts by a salesperson making an agreement with a customer about a campaign. The agreement is called a ''sales order'' and it defines the dates when spots (advertisements) are run and the commercial terms of the campaign. The sales order usually also defines the product group in order to avoid conflicts in scheduling, for example, where two fast food vendors have a spot in the same break.

At the station, a traffic person collects the sales orders and enters them into a computer system that will help to generate the daily logs. The traffic person also links the sales order with the possible media, such as an audio tape which contains the actual spot. When all the material is finished, the traffic system will be updated with parameters that define how the campaign will be run: in which [[dayparting|daypart]]s there will be spots, how the spots are placed within a break, and what other separation criteria in addition to product groups there may be.

His father was a renowned epigraphist, archaeologist and Indologist, who dedicated his life to historical research and Indological studies. He was a pioneer in ''Daasa Sahitya'' research. His mother built a value system based on the heritage of ''daasara padagalu''. Vadiraj had his early education in Sanskrit and philosophy under the tutelage of his father.

He stood 1st class 1st rank in [[Karnataka University]] studying Mathematics and Statistics in 1956. He was the first to achieve 82.5%.

==Career==
He has made significant contributions in [[Economics]] and [[Sanskrit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most widely held works by V. R Panchamukhi|url=https://www.worldcat.org/identities/lccn-n79141947/|publisher=[[WorldCat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economics===
Panchamukhi contributed to the field of economics in multiple ways. His work on the applications of [[game theory]] to [[Commercial policy|International Trade Policy]] analysis was noted as a pioneering work by [[Jagdish Bhagwati]] in his Survey of Literature published in the Economic Journal of [[London School of Economics]] (1975). His work on 'Effective Rates of Protection and Domestic Resource Cost', prepared and published jointly with Bhagwati and [[T. N. Srinivasan]], made a significant impact on the trade policy regimes of the 1960s and 1970s.

He worked on development models and resource gaps for the countries of the [[United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific]] (ESCAP) region that were presented under the leadership of [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Jan Tinbergen]] while he was a staff member of the ESCAP (then ECAFE). This became the basis for Resource Transfer for Development in the ESCAP region in the 1970s. He delivered a lecture at the Special Session of the ESCAP (held in Shanghai, China) on 'Theme of Strategy for Least Developed Countries.' This was used for many resolutions at the ESCAP Special Session.

He was invited to work at the [[South Centre (organization)]], Geneva, by [[Julius Nyerere]], the former President of Tanzania, and the then Chairman of the group. His analytical paper on the proposed [[Multilateral Agreement on Investment]] was utilized for negotiations at the [[WTO]] Ministerial Meetings (Singapore) in the 1990s.

He developed the "Research Information System (RIS)" for the Non-Aligned and other Developing Countries (an autonomous body established by the [[Ministry of External Affairs (India)]] in 1984) into an important 'think tank' of the developing world. It provided analytical inputs on international economic topics such as WTO, regional cooperation, investment flows and many others.

He was the Member Secretary of the "P. C. Alexander Committee on Import–Export Policies and Procedures" in 1977 that made path-breaking contributions to the process of liberalization of the trade policy regime in India.

'''Vernalization''' (from [[Latin]] ''vernus'', "of the [[spring (season)|spring]]") is the induction of a plant's [[flower]]ing process by exposure to the prolonged cold of winter, or by an artificial equivalent. After vernalization, plants have acquired the ability to flower, but they may require additional seasonal cues or weeks of growth before they will actually flower. Vernalization is sometimes used to refer to herbal (non-woody) plants requiring a cold dormancy to produce new shoots and leaves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sokolski |first1=K. |last2=Dovholuk |first2=A. |last3=Dovholuk |first3=L. |last4=Faletra |first4=P. |title=Axenic seed culture and micropropagation of ''Cypripedium reginae'' |journal=Selbyana |volume=18 |issue=2 |year=1997 |pages=172–82 |jstor=41760430 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but this usage is discouraged.&lt;ref name = "chouard"&gt;{{cite journal

Many plants grown in [[temperate]] climates require vernalization and must experience a period of low winter temperature to initiate or accelerate the flowering process. This ensures that reproductive development and seed production occurs in spring and winters, rather than in autumn.&lt;ref name = "sung"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sung |first1=Sibum |last2=He |first2=Yuehui |last3=Eshoo |first3=Tifani W |last4=Tamada |first4=Yosuke |last5=Johnson |first5=Lianna |last6=Nakahigashi |first6=Kenji |last7=Goto |first7=Koji |last8=Jacobsen |first8=Steve E |last9=Amasino |first9=Richard M |title=Epigenetic maintenance of the vernalized state in Arabidopsis thaliana requires LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 |journal=Nature Genetics |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=706–10 |year=2006 |pmid=16682972 |doi=10.1038/ng1795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The needed cold is often expressed in [[chilling requirement|chill hours]]. Typical vernalization temperatures are between 5 and 10 degrees Celsius (40 and 50 degrees Fahrenheit).{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

For many [[perennial plants]], such as [[fruit tree]] species, a period of cold is needed first to induce dormancy and then later, after the requisite period of time, re-emerge from that dormancy prior to flowering. Many [[monocarpic]] winter [[annual plant|annuals]] and [[biennial plant|biennials]], including some [[ecotype]]s of ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Michaels |first1=Scott D. |last2=He |first2=Yuehui |last3=Scortecci |first3=Katia C. |last4=Amasino |first4=Richard M. |title=Attenuation of FLOWERING LOCUS C activity as a mechanism for the evolution of summer-annual flowering behavior in Arabidopsis |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=100 |issue=17 |pages=10102–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12904584 |pmc=187779 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1531467100 |jstor=3147669 |bibcode=2003PNAS..10010102M }}&lt;/ref&gt; and winter [[cereals]] such as [[wheat]], must go through a prolonged period of cold before flowering occurs.

==History of vernalization research==
In the [[history of agriculture]], farmers observed a traditional distinction between "winter cereals", whose seeds require chilling (to trigger their subsequent emergence and growth), and "spring cereals", whose seeds can be sown in spring, and germinate, and then flower soon thereafter. Scientists in the early 19th century had discussed how some plants needed cold temperatures to  flower. In 1857 an American agriculturist [[John Hancock Klippart]], Secretary of the Ohio Board of Agriculture, reported the importance and effect of winter temperature on the germination of wheat. One of the most significant works was by a German plant physiologist [[Gustav Gassner]] &lt;!-- .de version exists --&gt; who made a detailed discussion in his 1918 paper. Gassner was the first to systematically differentiate the specific requirements of winter plants from those of summer plants, and also that early swollen germinating seeds of winter cereals are sensitive to cold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chouard|first1=P|title=Vernalization and its relations to dormancy|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|date=1960|volume=11|issue=1|pages=191–238|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.11.060160.001203}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1928 a Russian geneticist [[Trofim Lysenko]] published his works on the effects of cold on cereal seeds, and coined the term "яровизация" ("jarovization") to describe a chilling process he used to make the seeds of winter cereals behave like spring cereals (''Jarovoe'' in Russian, originally from ''jar'' meaning fire or the god of spring). Lysenko himself translated the term into "vernalization" (from the Latin ''vernum'' meaning Spring). After Lysenko the term was used to explain the ability of flowering in some plants after a period of chilling due to physiological changes and external factors. The formal definition was given in 1960 by a French botanist P. Chouard, as "the acquisition or acceleration of the ability to flower by a chilling treatment".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Poltronieri|first1=Palmiro|last2=Hong|first2=Yiguo|title=Applied Plant Genomics and Biotechnology|date=2015|publisher=Woodhead Publishing|location=Cambridge (UK)|isbn=978-0-08-100068-7|page=121|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMIcBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lysenko's 1928 paper on vernalization and [[plant physiology]] drew wide attention due to its practical consequences for Russian agriculture. Severe cold and lack of winter snow had destroyed many early winter wheat seedlings. By treating wheat seeds with moisture as well as cold, Lysenko induced them to bear a crop when planted in spring.&lt;ref name="lysenkosci"&gt;{{cite journal| first1= Nils |last1=Roll-Hansen| year = 1985| title = A new perspective on Lysenko?| journal = [[Annals of Science]]| volume = 42| pmid = 11620694| issue = 3| pages = 261–278| publisher = Taylor &amp; Francis| doi = 10.1080/00033798500200201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later however, Lysenko inaccurately asserted that the vernalized state could be inherited, i.e. the offspring of a vernalized plant would behave as if they themselves had also been vernalized and would not require vernalization in order to flower quickly.&lt;ref name = "amasino"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amasino|first1=R.|title=Vernalization, competence, and the epigenetic memory of winter|journal=The Plant Cell|date=2004|volume=16|issue=10|pages=2553–2559|doi=10.1105/tpc.104.161070|pmid=15466409|pmc=520954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early research on vernalization focused on plant physiology; the increasing availability of molecular biology has made it possible to unravel its underlying mechanisms.&lt;ref name = "amasino"/&gt; For example, a lengthening daylight period (longer days), ''as well as'' cold temperatures are required for winter wheat plants to go from the vegetative to the reproductive state; the three interacting genes are called ''VRN1'', ''VRN2'', and ''FT'' (''VRN3'').&lt;ref name = "trevaskis"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to plant flowering requiring the successful co-operation of several [[metabolic pathway]]s, computer models that incorporate vernalization have also been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=New Genetic Model Predicts Plant Flowering in Different Environments |publisher=Brown University |date=January 15, 2009 |url=https://news.brown.edu/articles/2009/01/arabidopsis |accessdate=March 20, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In ''Arabidopsis thaliana''==
[[File:Arabidopsis thaliana rosette.png|thumb|''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' rosette before vernalization, with no floral spike]]
''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' ("thale cress") is a much-studied model for vernalization. Some ecotypes (varieties), called "winter annuals", have delayed flowering without vernalization; others ("summer annuals") do not.&lt;ref name ="pbvr"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.plant-biology.com/vernalisation-response.php

      |publisher= Plant Biology }}{{self-published inline|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genes that underlie this difference in plant physiology have been intensively studied.&lt;ref name = "amasino"/&gt;

The reproductive phase change of ''A. thaliana'' occurs by a sequence of two related events: first, the [[Bolting (horticulture)|bolting]] transition (flower stalk elongates), then the floral transition (first flower appears).&lt;ref name=pouteau&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pouteau |first1=Sylvie |last2=Albertini |first2=Catherine |title=The significance of bolting and floral transitions as indicators of reproductive phase change in ''Arabidopsis'' |journal=Journal of Experimental Botany |volume=60 |issue=12 |pages=3367–77 |year=2009 |pmid=19502535 |doi=10.1093/jxb/erp173 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bolting is a robust predictor of flower formation, and hence a good indicator for vernalization research.&lt;ref name = "pouteau"/&gt;

In winter annual ''Arabidopsis'', vernalization of the [[meristem]] appears to confer competence to respond to floral inductive signals. A vernalized meristem retains competence for as long as 300 days in the absence of an inductive signal.&lt;ref name ="pbvr"/&gt;

At the molecular level, flowering is repressed by the protein ''Flowering Locus C'' (''FLC''), which binds to and represses genes that promote flowering, thus blocking flowering.&lt;ref name = "sung"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Amasino |first1=Richard |title=Seasonal and developmental timing of flowering |journal=The Plant Journal |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=1001–13 |year=2010 |pmid=20409274 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-313X.2010.04148.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Winter annual ecotypes of Arabidopsis have an active copy of the gene ''FRIGIDA'' (''FRI''), which promotes ''FLC'' expression, thus repression of flowering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Choi |first1=Kyuha |last2=Kim |first2=Juhyun |last3=Hwang |first3=Hyun-Ju |last4=Kim |first4=Sanghee |last5=Park |first5=Chulmin |last6=Kim |first6=Sang Yeol |last7=Lee |first7=Ilha |title=The FRIGIDA Complex Activates Transcription ofFLC, a Strong Flowering Repressor inArabidopsis, by Recruiting Chromatin Modification Factors |journal=The Plant Cell |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=289–303 |year=2011 |pmid=21282526 |pmc=3051252 |doi=10.1105/tpc.110.075911 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prolonged exposure to cold (vernalization) induces expression of ''VERNALIZATION INSENSTIVE3'', which interacts with the ''VERNALIZATION2'' polycomb-like complex to reduce ''FLC'' expression through chromatin remodeling.&lt;ref name = "Sung and Amasino"&gt;{{cite journal

==Devernalization==
It is possible to devernalize a plant by 
exposure to sometimes low and  high temperatures subsequent to vernalization. For example, commercial [[onion]] growers store sets at low temperatures, but devernalize them before planting, because they want the plant's energy to go into enlarging its bulb (underground stem), not making flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

Viktor Astafyev was born in the village of [[Ovsyanka, Krasnoyarsk Krai|Ovsyanka]] (then [[Krasnoyarsk]] [[Uyezd]], [[Yeniseysk Governorate]], [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Russian SFSR]]) on the bank of the [[Yenisei River|Yenisei river]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warheroes.ru/hero/hero.asp?Hero_id=10582 Герой Соц. Труда Астафьев Виктор Петрович :: Герои страны]. Warheroes.ru. Retrieved on 2 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Pyotr Pavlovich Astafyev, was a son of a relatively rich mill-owner (a part-time hunter who most of his time though spent at home), mother Lydia Ilyinichna Astafyeva (née Potylitsyna) came from a peasant family. In his 2000 autobiography&lt;ref name="autobio"&gt;{{cite web | author = | date = 2004| url  = http://magazines.russ.ru/ural/2004/5/ast1.html|title = Autobiography| publisher  = Ural magazine| accessdate = 13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viktor Astafyev remembered his father's household as a place where men, led by grandfather Pavel Yakovlevich, were on continuous binge, while all the work was being organized and done by two women, Lydia and her mother-in-law, Maria Osipova, Pavel Yakovlevich's young second wife.&lt;ref name="rost"&gt;Rostovtsev, Yuri. Viktor Astafyev. ЖЗЛ (Lives of Distinguished People) series. Moscow, Molodaya Gvardia Publishers. 2009. Timeline. pp. 383–388&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931 two tragedies struck. First Pyotr, Pavel and the latter's father (Astafyev grand-grandfather) Yakov Maximovich were arrested as part of the [[Dekulakization]] campaign and sent to a Siberian labour camp. In July 1931 Lydia Ilyinichna, Viktor's mother drowned in the [[Yenisey]] as the boat which she was rowing, carrying food to the Krasnoyarsk prison where her arrested husband was kept, got upturned. That year Pyotr Astafyev received 5 years of prison as an "[[Enemy of the people]]" and was sent to the infamous [[White Sea – Baltic Canal|Belomorkanal]] building-site. Seven-year-old Viktor found himself in the house of Yekaterina Petrovna and Ilya Yevgrafovich Potylitsyns, his mother’s parents who gave the boy all their love and care. In 1932 he joined a local primary school. His life in the early 1930s Astafyev later described in his book of short stories ''The Last Respect'' (Posledny Poklon, 1968).&lt;ref name="rost"/&gt;

In 1934 Pyotr Astafyev returned from labour camp and married again. He took Viktor to his new place, a small forest village Sosnovka, then in 1935 moved the family to [[Igarka]] where they settled as [[Forced settlements in the Soviet Union|spetspereselentsy]]. Ignored by both his stepmother Taisiya Tcherkasova (who’s by now given birth to her own son, Nikolai) and father, the boy rioted and soon found himself on the street, homeless. In 1937 he was taken in an orphanage and joined the 5th form of its special school which years later he remembered with great affection. Two of the teachers, Rozhdestvensky and Sokolov, noticed artistic and literary abilities in the boy who by this time started to write poetry, and did a lot to encourage him.&lt;ref name="rost"/&gt; Years later he remembered:&lt;blockquote&gt; Critics for some reason tend to feel sorry for me and for the difficult childhood that I had. This vexes me a lot. More than that... Given such a chance, I’d have chosen the very same life, full of things, happiness, victories and defeats. The latter only help to see the world better, to feel kindness deeper. There would have been just one thing I'd have changed – asked fate to keep mother with me. [Long pause] Orphanage, wandering, the boarding school – all this I had to live through in Igarka. But there were other things – books and songs, skiing trips, childhood happiness, first tears of epiphany... It was there that for the first time I've heard the radio, the gramophone, the brass orchestra... And it was in Igarka that I wrote my first ever short story which my teacher Rozhdestvensky published in our school's self-edited journal. And the newspaper Bolshevik Zapolyarya published my 4-line verse.&lt;ref name="rost"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
On 1 May 1941, Astafyev graduated from the school and joined a brickyard as a transport worker. As the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] broke out, he was working in the Kureika station, a manual worker at local village Soviet. In August he left Igarka and joined the newly formed Railway school in [[Krasnoyarsk]] which he graduated in June 1942.&lt;ref name="rost"/&gt;

===The War years ===
In October 1942 Astafyev volunteered for the [[Soviet Army]] and, after six months spent in reserve units (first in [[Berdsk]], then in [[Novosibirsk]]) in April 1943 was moved to [[Kaluga]] region as a soldier of the 92nd Howitzer brigade of the Kiev-Zhitomir division. In May Astafyev went into action, taking part in fierce fighting conducted by the [[Bryansk Front|Bryansk]], [[Voronezh Front|Voronezh]] and [[Steppe Front]]s. In October he was injured while force-crossing [[Dnieper]] (that was where and when he lost his right eye)&lt;ref name="bykov"&gt;{{cite web | author = Dmitry Bykov interview| date = 2009| url  = http://vikent.ru/author/1910/|title = Viktor Petrovich Astafyev| publisher  = Prosaic Publishers| accessdate = 13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 25 November received his first award, [[Medal "For Courage" (Russia)|For Courage]] medal. In January 1944 he returned to action, took part first in [[Battle of the Korsun–Cherkassy Pocket|Korsun-Shevchenko operation]], then (in March and April) in the [[Kamenets-Podolsky]] assault and on 25 April was awarded the [[Order of the Red Star]].&lt;ref name="rost"/&gt;

On 17 September 1944, Astafyev was heavily injured near Polish town of [[Dukla]] and spent the next 8 months in hospitals. "Since then I was unfit for an active service and was drifting from one reserve unit to another until I settled at the postal point of the [[1st Ukrainian Front]] nearby Zhmerinka station. Here I met a fellow soldier, Maria Semyonovna Koryakina, married her after demobilization and went with her to her place in the town of [[Chusovoy]] of the [[Perm]] (then Molotov) oblast," he wrote in autobiography.&lt;ref name="autobio"/&gt;

The horrible experience of war has remained with Astafyev forever, becoming the major incentive to become a writer. "About the War... what do I know? Everything and nothing. I was a common soldier and we had our own, soldiers' truth. One rather glib author called it derogatively 'the truth from the trenches' and our 'point of view' – a 'hillock view'&lt;ref group=note&gt;A pun on 'tochka', a ''point'' [as in 'tochka zreniya', a 'point of view'] and 'kochka', a ''hillock''&lt;/ref&gt;… But I felt like I had to tell about the everyday side of the war, of how the trenches smelt, of the way people there lived... The first killed, one of us. The first one you've killed. I had to write of all the monstrous things I've seen," he said years later in an interview.&lt;ref&gt;Rostovtsev, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary career===
After his [[discharge (military)|discharge]] in 1945 Astafyev settled for a while in his wife's parents' house in Chusovoy, then went to Krasnoyarsk, doing various jobs such as [[locksmith]] and [[smelter]]. In 1950 he started contributing to the Tchusovsky Rabochy (The Tchusovoy Worker) newspaper which in February 1951 published his debut short story "A Civil Man" (Grazhdansky tchelovek), which two years later was reprinted by the [[Perm]]-based Zvesda newspaper. In 1954 Astafyev was for the first time published by a [[Moscow]] magazine (short story "Splinter", in ''Smena''). In 1955 he left the newspaper and started working upon his first novel ''Snows are Melting'' (Tayut Snega) which was published in 1958, as was his first book of short stories ''Warm Rain'' (Tyoply Dozhd), dedicated mostly to the experience of Russian soldiers and civilians during the German-Soviet War. Also in the late 1950s Astafyev joined the regional Perm radio. Working there provided relatively good wages but involved too much blatant propaganda. "I decided to quit after 1,5 years, feeling that otherwise I'd just stop respecting myself altogether," he remembered.&lt;ref&gt;Rostovtsev,  p.121&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 October 1958 Astafyev became the member of the RSFSR Union of Writers.&lt;ref name="rost"/&gt;

In 1959, Astafyev enrolled in the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]] in Moscow; he became friends with [[Sergey Vikulov]], Yevgeny Nosov and a group of [[Vologda]] authors. One of several short novels of this period, ''The Old Oak'' ("Starodub", 1960), became Astafyev's first European publication: translated into [[Czech language|Czech]], in 1963 it was published in [[Prague]]. After 1962 Astafyev became a professional writer, his wife Maria helping out as a typist.&lt;ref group=note&gt;In 1965 Maria Koryakina debuted with her short story "Hard-Earned Happiness" and since then published 16 books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rost"/&gt;

In 1969 Astafyev and his family moved to the city of Vologda where most of his literary friends lived. Several major books – ''Notches'' (Zatesi), ''Mountain Pass'', ''The Last Respect'' (book 1), ''Shepherd and His Wife'' followed in the early 1970s and won Astafyev (now the [[Order of the Red Banner of Labour]] two-times chevalier) the RSFSR State Maxim Gorky Prize in December 1975. A year later ''Nash Sovremennik'' published "The Tsar Fish", one of his most famous short stories (which gave the title to the compilation). His debut play ''The Bird-Cherry Tree'' was premiered at the Moscow Yermolova theatre, also in 1976. On 19 October 1978, for the ''Tsar-Fish'' book Astafyev received the [[USSR State Prize]].&lt;ref name="rost"/&gt;

In 1981 the first edition of ''The Complete Astafyev'' in 4 volumes came out. By this time the author bought himself a house in his native Ovsyanka and moved his family to Krasnoyarsk. The first TV documentary (shot by director M.Litvyakov) "Viktor Astafyev" was shown in 1983. By 1984 four films based on his work came out, including ''Falling Stars'' by [[Igor Talankin]] and Arkady Sirenko's ''Born Twice'', the latter featuring Astafyev as a scriptwriter. Great resonance had his novel ''[[Sad Detective]]'' (1986), as well as a set of 1987 short stories, including controversial "The Catching of Cudgeons in Georgia". In 1988–1989 Astavyev visited France (where his ''Sad Detective'' was published), [[Bulgaria]] (to oversee his 1966 short novel ''The Theft'' being screened) and Greece and took part in the 1989 [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union]]. The epic novel ''The Cursed and the Slain'' (Proklyaty i Ubity, books 1 and 2, 1992–1993) brought Astafyev The [[State Prize of the Russian Federation]] in May 1996. The same month Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] visited Ovsyanka to meet Astafyev. In 1998 the 15-volumes Krasnoyarsk edition of ''The Complete Astafyev'' came out.&lt;ref name="rost"/&gt;

Astafyev's last years were not happy ones. In 2000 he suffered a stroke. Not long before his death Astafyev wrote his last words: "I entered a world that was kind and open and I loved it wholeheartedly. I leave a world that is alien, evil and vile and I have nothing to say to all of you by way of farewells."&lt;ref&gt;Rostovtsev, p.246&lt;/ref&gt; Viktor Astafyev died on 29 November 2001, in Krasnoyarsk. He was buried in his native Ovsyanka.&lt;ref name="rost"/&gt;

==Controversy==
In the mid-1980s, he became embroiled in significant controversy over his writings followed by accusations of [[chauvinism]] and [[xenophobia]] when the public learned, through [[samizdat]], about the correspondence between the literary historian [[Natan Eidelman]] and Astafyev that had been provoked by alleged [[racist]] overtones in Astafyev's work ''Sad Detective'' and his ''The Catching of Gudgeons in Georgia'' (both 1986), the latter deemed offensive by the [[Georgians|Georgian]] readership.&lt;ref&gt;Shlapentokh, Vladimir (1990), ''Soviet Intellectuals and Political Power: The Post-Stalin Era'', pp. 269–270.

Waiting for Democracy. ''Foreign Policy'', No. 84 (Autumn, 1991), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1993, he signed the [[Letter of Forty-Two]].&lt;ref name=letter&gt;{{cite news|script-title=ru:Писатели требуют от правительства решительных действий|url=http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/PAPERS/HONOUR/LETT42.HTM|accessdate=21 August 2011|newspaper=[[Izvestia]]|date=5 October 1993|language=ru|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716043414/http://vivovoco.rsl.ru/VV/PAPERS/HONOUR/LETT42.HTM|archivedate=16 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 1999, his novel ''Jolly Soldier'', which portrayed the horrors of the [[Soviet Army]] was met with extremely adverse reaction, which may have brought about a heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/courier/2001_11/uk/doss24.htm "Bound by Nostalgia"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060716085425/http://www.unesco.org/courier/2001_11/uk/doss24.htm |date=16 July 2006 }}, ''[[UNESCO Courier]],'' November 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In the years when many Soviet war literature authors (like Fyodor Parfyonov or Ivan Stadnyuk) were singing paeans to an idealized, invincible Soviet war hero, crashing the enemy under the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] leadership, Viktor Astafyev became one of the first to rebel against the officially-approved convention and reveal the darker, unglamorous side of what was happening in 1941–1945.&lt;ref name="druzhba"&gt;{{cite web | author = Lazarev, Lazar| date = 2005, No.6| url  = http://magazines.russ.ru/druzhba/2005/6/ll14.html|title = The Truth From the Trenches | publisher  = [[Druzhba Narodov]]| accessdate = 13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is credited with being one of the major proponents (alongside [[Viktor Nekrasov]], [[Vasil’ Bykaw|Vasyl Bykov]], [[Vladimir Bogomolov (writer)|Vladimir Bogomolov]], [[Konstantin Vorobyov (writer)|Konstantin Vorobyov]]) of the so-called The Truth from the Trenches (okopnaya pravda) movement (the term was used originally in a derogatory sense by detractors who argued that formers soldier could not be trusted to write about the Great war objectively, being ignorant of its greater 'truths') which brought authenticity and harsh realism to the Soviet war literature.&lt;ref name="krugosvet "&gt;{{cite web | author = | date = | url  = http://www.krugosvet.ru/enc/kultura_i_obrazovanie/literatura/ASTAFEV_VIKTOR_PETROVICH.html|title = Astafyev, Viktor Petrovich| publisher  = Krugosvet Encyclopedia| accessdate = 13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="moteyunaite"&gt;{{cite web | author = Moteyunaite, Ilona| date = 2007| url  = https://lit.1september.ru/article.php?ID=200700907|title = In blood, in suffering, in death…| publisher  = Literature (newspaper)| accessdate = 13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Gillespie summed up his career as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Astafyev has always been a highly individual writer who conforms to no movements or stereotypes.... He has always remained true to himself, and has retained a certain hard-edged integrity. His novel ''Prokliaty i ubity'' [The Damned and the Dead] is a gritty, typically uncompromising picture of war, with many naturalistic descriptions in a style the author has developed since the cathartic ''Pechal'nyi detektiv''. Astafyev remains very much a writer who refuses to be easily categorized: he is neither a Village Prose Writer, nor a writer of "war prose", nor a writer who explores the mistakes of the recent Soviet past. At the same time, he is all of these. Capable of surprising and even shocking his reader, Astafev maintains a deep lyrical sense that has produced what Eidel'man called "the best descriptions of nature for decades". More than any other writer living in Russia today (with the possible exception of Solzhenitsyn), he is a writer who examines man as subjected to and moulded by the total Soviet experience.&lt;ref&gt;David Gillespie, "Viktor Petrovich Astaf'yev (1924–)," in Neil Cornwell and Nicole Christian, eds., ''Reference Guide to Russian Literature'' (Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998: {{ISBN|1-884964-10-9}}), pp. 123–4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
