The '''African Development Movement''' ({{lang-fr|Mouvement Africain de Développement}}, MAD) was a [[political party]] in [[Gabon]] led by [[Pierre Claver Zeng Ebome]].

==History==
The MAD contested the [[Gabonese legislative election, 2001|2001 parliamentary elections]], winning one of the 120 seats in the [[National Assembly (Gabon)|National Assembly]], taken by Zeng Ebome. He retained the seat in the [[Gabonese legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]], in which the party was part of the bloc supporting the ruling [[Gabonese Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://africanelections.tripod.com/ga.html Elections in Gabon] African Elections Database&lt;/ref&gt; 

The party held its Fourth Congress on 10 February 2008, reaffirming its participation in the Presidential Majority and re-electing Zeng Ebome as its President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaboneco.com/show_article.php?IDActu=5353 "Gabon : Le MAD en rangs serrés pour les élections locales"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711062654/http://www.gaboneco.com/show_article.php?IDActu=5353 |date=2011-07-11 }}, Gaboneco, 11 February 2008 {{fr icon}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It lost its seat in the [[Gabonese legislative election, 2011|2011 elections]].

In 2010 it was one of several parties that merged to form the [[National Union (Gabon)|National Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/gabonese-opposition-forms-new-party-1.473158 Gabonese opposition forms new party] IOL, 10 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Akureyri Golf Club was established in 1935. It is Iceland‘s second-oldest golf club after [[Reykjavik Golf Club]].

Akureyri Golf Club established its current location at the Jadar farm in 1970. For ten years, the members played a 9-hole course which is now the front nine, designed by Magnus Gudmundsson. In 1980, the second nine holes were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daley|first1=Paul|title=Golf Architecture: A Worldwide Perspective, Volume 3|date=2008|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=9781589806160|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second nine holes were developed and implemented by Magnus Gudmundsson and Gunnar Thordarson.

The Arctic Open is held at Akureyri Golf Club during the summer solstice. It was first held in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/story/golf-in-iceland|title=Golf in Iceland: Under the Midnight Sun - Golf Digest|author=Oliver Horovitz,Dom Furore|date=|work=Golf Digest|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a four-day championship event, open to international professional and amateur golfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcticopen.is|title=Arctic Open - a true golfing adventure under the midnight sun|author=Arctic Open - a true golfing adventure under the midnight sun|date=|work=Arctic Open - a true golfing adventure under the midnight sun|accessdate=3 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23990">The '''anti-bureaucratic revolution''' was a campaign of street protests by supporters of Serbian leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] that ran between 1988 and 1989 in [[Yugoslavia]]. The protests overthrew the governments of the Serbian autonomous provinces of [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]] and [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]], as well as the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]], and replaced them with allies of Milošević, thereby creating a dominant voting bloc within the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav presidency council]].

The name ''anti-bureaucratic revolution'' is derived from the proclaimed revolt against bureaucratic and [[political corruption|corrupt governing structures]].

The events were condemned by the [[communist]] governments of the western Yugoslav republics (especially [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]] and [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|SR Croatia]]), who successfully resisted the attempts to expand the revolt onto their territories, and turned against Milošević. The rising antagonism eventually resulted in the dissolution of the ruling [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] in 1990, and subsequently in the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]].

==Prelude==
{{expert needed| reason=Institutional access required to verify source in this section|talk=Prelude: Milošević's rise to power |date=January 2016}}

Since the adoption of the 1974 Constitution of Yugoslavia, Serbia and its two autonomous provinces Kosovo and Vojvodina entered into political deadlock with the provincial governments in Kosovo and Vojvodina.{{sfn|Jović|2008|p=172}} In 1976 the Serbian government issued its first complaints of unconstitutional practice of autonomy by the provinces to Tito and [[Edvard Kardelj]] and issued a subsequent complaint in 1984 on the matter, attempting to resolve the problems within the 1974 Constitution.{{sfn|Jović|2008|pp=173-174}} It was reported that the provinces had repeatedly denied the Serbian government the ability to enact policies in their territories, such as regulation of citizenship policy, common defense law, and [[Social policy|social plans]].{{sfn|Jović|2008|p=174}}

The situation in Kosovo became a crisis in the [[1981 protests in Kosovo]] by Albanians who were heard shouting slogans such as "We are Albanians, not Yugoslavs", "Kosova Republic", "Unity with Albania", "Long live Marxism-Leninism, Down with Revisionism" and others.{{sfn|Jović|2008|p=185}} The presence of ethnic and ideological dimensions to the protestors demands led to Yugoslav authorities deciding to forcibly stop the protests, the president of the Pristina League of Communists, Aslan Fazlia (an Albanian) said that the protests were nationalistic and counterrevolutionary and announced tough police action against the demonstrators.{{sfn|Jović|2008|p=185}} This action failed to quell the protests that instead grew in response with protests by Albanians sweeping across Kosovo, the President of the League of Communists of Kosovo [[Mahmut Bakalli]] decided in response to ask the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) to bring tanks onto the streets.{{sfn|Jović|2008|p=185}} Police reinforcements from [[Central Serbia]] were stopped by a roadblock and then Albanian demonstrators took hostages from thirty-four houses of Serbs and Montenegrins, demanding that these police forces leave Kosovo in exchange for the release of the hostages.{{sfn|Jović|2008|pp=185-186}} Only after additional police forces from Pristina arrived were the hostages released.{{sfn|Jović|2008|pp=185-186}} The protests lead to vandalism throughout Kosovo including smashed windows of cars, shops, and state institutions.{{sfn|Jović|2008|pp=185-186}} The Yugoslav leadership declared a "crisis situation in Kosovo" and all republics were requested to send their police troops to Kosovo.{{sfn|Jović|2008|pp=185-186}} The Yugoslav leadership was shocked by extent of the violence used by the demonstrators and the relatively large participation in the demonstrations.{{sfn|Jović|2008|pp=185-186}}

The aftermath of the 1981 protests in Kosovo resulted in resentment by Serbs in Kosovo to the political situation in Kosovo.{{sfn|Crampton|2013|p=148}} Serbs suspected that deliberate [[Albanianization]] of Kosovo and Serbs being driven out was demonstrated by statistics showing that the population of Serbs in Kosovo had significantly decreased from 23.5% in 1961 to 13.2% in 1981, as well as making claims that they were being persecuted by Albanians including that Serb women were being systematically raped by Albanians.{{sfn|Crampton|2013|p=148}} Many of these claims were not backed up by factual evidence but built up as popular rumours believed amongst Serbs in Kosovo.{{sfn|Crampton|2013|p=148}}

Milošević took control of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]]'s [[League of Communists of Serbia|Serbian branch]] in September 1987, when his faction won over its opposition, led by [[Ivan Stambolić]]. His rise to power coincided with Serbo-Albanian tensions in [[Kosovo]], as [[Serbs of Kosovo|Kosovo Serbs]] felt oppressed by [[Albanians in Kosovo|Albanians]] and the Albanian-dominated leadership of the province. The tensions were further boosted by inflammatory reports in the Serbian media.

According to the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution|1974 Yugoslav constitution]], the two [[autonomous province]]s of Serbia ([[Vojvodina]] and Kosovo) were largely independent from the central Serbian government, with both of them holding a seat in the Yugoslav Presidency, on a par with the six constituent republics of Yugoslavia. In effect, their status was almost equivalent to the republics', which enabled provincial leaderships of Kosovo and Vojvodina to have policies that were practically independent.

In late 1987 and 1988, a populist campaign started in Serbia against this situation, which it described as untenable. Provincial leaderships were being accused of bureaucratic inefficiency and alienation from the people. Popular slogans like "Oh Serbia in three parts, you will be whole again" (Ој Србијо из три дела поново ћеш бити цела, ''oj Srbijo iz tri dela ponovo ćeš biti cela'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nin.co.rs/arhiva/2431/1.html|title=Duh Belog dvora|publisher=[[NIN (magazine)|NIN]]|date=1997-08-01|author=Petar Ignja|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; caught on. The atmosphere was further stirred up by numerous articles and readers' letters in Serbian press, the most notorious being ''[[Politika]]'''s rubric "Odjeci i reagovanja" (''Echoes and reactions''), a [[letters to the editor]] column which was used as a type of [[astroturfing]].&lt;ref name="Politika"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkBmdCwHuDsC&amp;pg=PA550&amp;lpg=PA550&amp;dq=anti-bureaucratic+revolution
|title=Politika in the Storm of Nationalism|author=Aleksandar Nenadović|year=1993|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9116-56-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Milosavljević|2003}}

The main points of the campaign were the following:&lt;ref name=kearns&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/1467-923X.00201|title=Western Intervention and the Promotion of Democracy in Serbia|author=Ian Kearns|publisher=The Political Quarterly|pages=23|year=1999|volume=70|issue=1|issn=0032-3179|doi=10.1111/1467-923X.00201|journal=The Political Quarterly }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Serbs in Kosovo were being harassed by Albanians and suppressed by the Albanian-dominated Kosovo government
*Due to the 1974 constitution, Serbia had no effective control over its provinces, whose leaderships were bureaucratic and estranged from the people
*This constitution was created by the influence of the other Yugoslav republics, especially Slovenia and Croatia, in order to suppress Serbia's power and create an environment for the exploitation of Serbia's natural resources
*The constitution had, in effect, created a [[confederal]] type of government, as no decision could be made without the [[consensus]] of all six republics in the federal parliament; and a system with a better consideration of popular majority was called for (the slogan "[[one man, one vote]]" was one of the most popular)
*Therefore, a thorough revision of the federal constitution and the enhancement of Serbian control over its provinces were necessary

==Protests==
The mass protests started in February 1986, with several meetings of Kosovo Serbs in [[Belgrade]] and in Kosovo, pleading for a resolution of the problematic situation on Kosovo. These were relatively small, with 100-5,000 participants, and were mostly reactions to individual inter-ethnic incidents. The largest such protest was held in [[Kosovo Polje]] in April 1987, gathering around 20,000 people.{{sfn|Milosavljević|2003}}

However, the outburst of protests began in the latter half of 1988. In June, the protest of workers of the [[Zmaj (factory)|Zmaj]] factory gathered 5,000 protestors; in July, meetings were held in seven towns with tens of thousands protesters, and in August in ten towns with 80,000 people. By September they spread to 39 towns with over 400,000 people.{{sfn|Milosavljević|2003}}

===Vojvodina (October 1988)===
On 5 October 1988, around 150,000 people gathered in [[Novi Sad]] to protest against the Vojvodina provincial government. The gathering started a day earlier in the nearby town of [[Bačka Palanka]], and, as ''Politika'' explained it, people spontaneously gathered and moved on to Novi Sad, the provincial capital.{{sfn|Milosavljević|2003}} The protest in Bačka Palanka was led by [[Mihalj Kertes]], a mid-level official of the Communist Party, an ethnic [[Hungarians in Vojvodina|Hungarian]] who would later become famous for his remark "How can you Serbs be afraid of Serbia when I, a Hungarian, am not afraid of Serbia?"&lt;ref name="Kertes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Crash of Yugoslavia's Money Man|
url=http://listserv.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0011&amp;L=justwatch-l&amp;O=D&amp;P=77111|author=Michael Dobbs|publisher=Washington Post Foreign Service|date=2000-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; (and later still, as Milošević's money man). Protesters from Novi Sad and other parts of Serbia gathered in huge numbers, and began the protest in front of the provincial [[Parliament of Vojvodina]].

The provincial leadership, led by [[Milovan Šogorov]], [[Boško Krunić]] and [[Živan Berisavljević]], were caught by surprise. Before the event, they tried to compromise and negotiate with Milošević, expressing cautious support for the constitutional changes while trying to keep their and Vojvodina's position intact. However, the avalanche of media campaign orchestrated from Belgrade was about to overwhelm them; they were labelled as power-hungry "[[Armchair revolutionary|armchair]]ers" (фотељаши / ''foteljaši'') and "autonomists" (аутономаши / ''autonomaši'').&lt;ref name="NIN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vojvodina:Užegli jogurt|date=1998-10-15|url=http://www.nin.co.rs/arhiva/2494/6.html|author=Petar Ignja|publisher=NIN|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vojvodina government then cut off power and water supply to protesters, a move which enraged them further still, and caused even more people from Novi Sad and its vicinity to join. When power was restored, they tried a different tactic: in order to cheer the demonstrators up, they gave them bread and [[yogurt]]. However, thousands of yogurt packages were soon thrown at the Parliament building by angry protesters. That term "Yogurt Revolution" for the protest was named after that episode.&lt;ref name="Kerenji"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aENQit9KT0sC&amp;pg=RA2-PA354&amp;lpg=RA2-PA354&amp;dq=Yogurt+revolution+Novi+Sad|

On October 6, the entire collective leadership of Vojvodina resigned and were soon replaced with Milošević's men of trust [[Nedeljko Šipovac]], Radovan Pankov and [[Radoman Božović]]. The Vojvodina representative in the Central Committee of [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|SKJ]], Boško Krunić, resigned and was replaced by Stanko Radmilović, while the President of the Central Committee of the [[League of Communists of Vojvodina|SKV]], Milovan Šogorov, resigned and was replaced by Bogosav Kovačević.

===Ušće rally===
The rally in [[Belgrade]], at [[Ušće]] (the large field at confluence of [[Sava|Sava River]] into [[Danube]]) was held on November 19, 1988. According to the state press, it gathered about a million people, and according to others, several hundred thousands. It was conceived as a "mother of all rallies", and a huge crowd of people come from all parts of Serbia by public and factory buses taken just for this opportunity. Milošević reaffirmed his and Serbia's confinement to the principles of liberty and Serbian equity within Yugoslavia:&lt;ref name="Bg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beograd.rs/cms/view.php?id=201267|title=Disintegration Years 1988-2000|publisher=Assembly of Belgrade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;We will win the battle for [[Kosovo]] regardless of the obstacles placed in front of us in the country and abroad. So, we will win regardless of the uniting of our enemies from abroad and those in the country. And that this nation will win the battle for freedom, is a fact well-known even to the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] and [[Nazi Germany|German]] conquerors.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Montenegro===
Rallies and media were also similarly used in Montenegro with the first rally in support of Kosovo Serbs and Kosovo Montenegrins taking place in [[Titograd]] on 20 August 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dan.co.me/?nivo=3&amp;datum=2009-08-23&amp;rubrika=Politika&amp;najdatum=2009-08-21&amp;clanak=198303 | title = Bili Srbi, a sada ih svrbi | newspaper = [[Dan (newspaper)|Dan]] | date = August 21, 2009 | accessdate = 2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership of the [[League of Communists of Montenegro|Montenegrin Communist League]] was on the defense at the time, claiming that it was protecting Kosovo, but their restraint in direct support for Milošević was deemed not good enough by the putschists.

What eventually proved to be the coup's first act occurred on 7 October 1988 when Montenegrin police intervened against protesters in Žuta Greda demanding resignations from the Montenegrin leadership. In order to deal with the situation the leadership proclaimed the [[state of emergency]]. The state of emergency did not last long, as it was taken as an act of hostility towards Serbia by media outlets controlled by Milošević as well as Milošević's supporters in Montenegro.&lt;ref name="Vreme"&gt;{{cite web|title=Serbian President: The Technology Of A Showdown|url=http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/153/t153-3.htm|publisher=Vreme|author=Milan Milošević, Filip Švarm|date=1994-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second act started with joint rallies consisting of workers from Radoje Dakić, a state-owned factory, and [[Veljko Vlahović University]] students. On 10 January 1989, over 10,000 protesters gathered in [[Titograd]].{{sfn|Milosavljević|2003}}&lt;ref name="Vreme"/&gt; The old leadership, confused and disorganised, soon gave in; none of them later played a significant political role.&lt;ref name="Vreme"/&gt; The new "young lions" of the Montenegro, [[Momir Bulatović]], [[Milo Đukanović]] and [[Svetozar Marović]], became the new leadership, strongly allied with Milošević in the years to come. The League of Communists of Montenegro was subsequently transformed by the "triumvirate" who had full control over the (Socialist) Republic of Montenegro into the [[Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro]], which vigorously maintained its grip over Montenegro and does so to this day more than 20 years later.

===Toppling of Kosovar leadership and reduction of autonomy===
[[Azem Vllasi]] and [[Kaqusha Jashari]], the two top-ranked Kosovo politicians, were replaced in November 1988.{{sfn|Milosavljević|2003}} The Albanian population of Kosovo grew restless, and in February 1989 they engaged in a general strike, particularly manifesting itself in the [[1989 Kosovo miners' strike]]. Meanwhile, on February 28, another major rally was held in Belgrade, where the chants "We want weapons" and "Arrest Vllasi" were heard, and three days later, Vllasi was indeed placed under arrest.{{sfn|Milosavljević|2003}}

In early 1989, the [[Parliament of Serbia]] had proposed constitutional amendments that would have significantly reduced SAP Kosovo's autonomous status within SR Serbia.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}} Kosovo Albanians organized large demonstrations against these moves,{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}} but in March 1989, preceding a final push for the ratification of constitutional changes in the Assembly of Kosovo, the Yugoslav police rounded up around 240 prominent Kosovo Albanians, apparently selected based on their anti-ratification sentiment, and detained them with complete disregard for [[due process]].{{sfn|Anderson|1990|pp=27&amp;ndash;29}}

Albanian representatives in the [[Parliament of Kosovo]] boycotted the vote on the matter on March 23, 1989, but regardless of the failure of the motion to meet the required two-thirds majority, it was declared to have passed.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}} On March 28, the Serbian parliament approved the constitutional changes.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}}

===Gazimestan rally===
{{Main article|Gazimestan speech}}
The largest rally of all was held at [[Gazimestan]] on 28 June 1989, gathering two million according to ''[[Politika]]''.{{sfn|Milosavljević|2003}}

===Action North===

When a "Rally of Truth" ({{lang-sl|Miting resnice}}) was attempted in [[Ljubljana]], [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]] in December 1989, in an action named '''Action North''' Slovene police forces prevented it with the help of Croatian police forces. This action can be considered the first Slovenian defense action against the attacks of the supporters of Milošević, leading to Slovenian independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329 |title=Historical Circumstances in Which "The Rally of Truth" in Ljubljana Was Prevented |publisher=Journal of Criminal Justice and Security |accessdate=4 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213053210/http://www.fvv.uni-mb.si/varstvoslovje/Abstract.aspx?cid=329 |archivedate=December 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rtvslo.si/osamosvojitev/prispevek/108/predvajaj/|title="Rally of truth" (Miting resnice)|publisher= A documentary published by [[RTV Slovenija]]|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of Slovene police forces who participated later organized their own veteran organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.akcijasever.si/|title=akcijasever.si|publisher=The "North" Veteran Organization|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
The anti-bureaucratic revolution affected the balance of power in the [[Presidency of Yugoslavia]]. Serbia's [[Borisav Jović]] (at the time the President of the Presidency), Montenegro's Nenad Bućin, Vojvodina's Jugoslav Kostić and Kosovo's [[Riza Sapunxhiu]], started to form a voting bloc.&lt;ref name="bhdani-2001"/&gt; The reduction of provincial autonomy, but not the complete abolishment of provincial status, was seen as intentional, as Milošević needed the extra provincial votes to gain influence in the federal presidency.&lt;ref name="Krieger2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krieger|first=Heike|title=The Kosovo Conflict and International Law: An Analytical Documentation 1974–1999|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-OhPTJn8ZWoC&amp;pg=PA522|accessdate=9 March 2012|date=12 July 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521800716|page=522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Judah2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Judah|first=Tim|title=Kosovo: what everyone needs to know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M2IbzZcAnUUC&amp;pg=PP56|accessdate=9 March 2012|date=29 September 2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195376739|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1990 the [[Croatian Parliament]] replaced its representative [[Stipe Šuvar]] with [[Stjepan Mesić]] in the wake of the [[Log Revolution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slobodnaevropa.org/content/article/1045346.html | publisher = [[Radio Free Europe]] | language = Croatian | title = Svjedoci raspada - Stipe Šuvar: Moji obračuni s njima | date = 2008-02-27 | accessdate = 2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Mesić was only seated in October 1990 because of protests from the Serbian side. From then on, Mesić joined Macedonia's [[Vasil Tupurkovski]], Slovenia's [[Janez Drnovšek]] and Bosnia and Herzegovina's [[Bogić Bogićević]] in opposing the demands to proclaim a general [[state of emergency]], which would have allowed the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] to impose [[martial law]] in March 1991.&lt;ref name="bhdani-2001"/&gt; When Sapunxhiu 'defected' his faction in the final vote, Jović briefly resigned and returned, Bućin was replaced with [[Branko Kostić]], and Sapunxhiu with [[Sejdo Bajramović]], effectively deadlocking the Presidency.&lt;ref name="bhdani-2001"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bhdani.com/arhiva/208/t20801.shtml | language = Bosnian | newspaper = [[BH Dani]] | title = Stjepan Mesić, svjedok kraja (I) - Ja sam inicirao sastanak na kojem je podijeljena Bosna | date = 2001-06-01 | issue = 208 | accessdate = 2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon the country descended into the [[Yugoslav Wars]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1143">'''Apsines''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀψίνης}}) was a [[sophist]] from [[Athens]]. He was a son of Onasimus, and grandson of another Apsines who was an Athenian sophist. It is not impossible that he may be the Apsines whose commentary on [[Demosthenes]] is mentioned by [[Ulpian]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Ulpian]], ''ad Demosth. Leptin.'' p. 11; comp. Schol. ''ad Hermog.'' p. 402&lt;/ref&gt; and who taught rhetoric at Athens at the time of [[Aedesius]], in the fourth century CE, though this Apsines is called a [[Lacedaemon]]ian.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eunapius]], ''Lives of the Sophists'' p. 113, ed. Antwerp. 1568&lt;/ref&gt;

This Apsines and his disciples were hostile to Julianus, a contemporary rhetorician at Athens, and to his school. This enmity grew so much that Athens in the end found itself in a state of civil warfare, which required the presence of a Roman proconsul to suppress.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eunapius]], ''Lives of the Sophists'' p. 115, &amp;c., ed. Antwerp. 1568&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Association for the Defense of Nature (ADN)''' was born in 1986 as a result of the concern of a group of people for the environment. It is an [[NGO]] that aims to protect and study nature in [[Andorra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bondia.ad/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4656&amp;Itemid=999 |title=ADN organitza una projecció de fotografies del sud-est d'Àsia |work=Diari Bondia Andorra |date=2009-04-20 |accessdate=2011-04-23 |language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ADN pursues its aims through three basic lines of action: conservation, study and information.

== Conservation ==
ADN carries out direct action of nature conservation: 
* Promotes planning to streamline the human presence (industrial, tourism, etc..) In the Valleys of Andorra.
* Work for the creation of protected natural areas, suggesting areas, management measures, ways of sustainable use, etc..
* Vigil for the safeguarding of endangered species, both animal and vegetable.
* Claim effective solutions to the problems of pollution and waste.
* Collaborate with other institutions to create, adapt and apply the laws of environmental protection.

== Study ==
ADN contributes to research on the environment and this protection: 
* Promotes and develops scientific basis for conservation actions and proposals.
* Learn lesser known natural elements of our country, analyzing the situation and proposing measures for their protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.ad/imagenes/publicacions/butlleti13.pdf |title=La petjada ecològica d'Andorra: càlcul i educació ambiental |work=UNESCO Andorra |year=2005 |accessdate=2011-04-23 |language=ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Information ==

'''Bembe''' (Kibeembe) is a [[Bantu language]] of [[Congo-Brazzaville]]. It is closely related to [[Kongo language|Kikongo]]. ''Pangwa'' (not the Pangwa of Tanzania) may be a dialect.

Maho (2009) considers Beembe, Kamba-Doondo, and Hangala (Ghaangala) to be distinct languages.

It should not be confused with the [[Bembe language (Ibembe)]] spoken in Congo-Kinshasa and Tanzania.

{{lang|ga|'''Deoraíocht'''}} (original spelling {{lang|ga|Deoraidheacht}}) is an [[Irish-language]] novel by [[Pádraic Ó Conaire]]. An English translation is published under the title '''''Exile'''''. Published in 1910, it is arguably ([[Peadar Ó Laoghaire]]'s ''Séadna'' also being a contender for the position) the most important novel from the [[Gaelic revival]]. For many critics its radical social message, its sympathy with the poor and marginalised, its tendency to convey urban life honestly and fairly and its avoidance of romanticising rural life in comparison to urban life makes it the outstanding novel of the [[Gaelic revival]].&lt;ref&gt;Declan Kiberd, ''Idir Dhá Chultúr'' (Baile Átha Cliath, 2002), p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip O'Leary, ''The Prose Literature of the Gaelic Revival, 1881–1921'' (Penn, 1994), ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''East German passport''' was issued to citizens of the former German Democratic Republic (commonly known as [[East Germany]]) for international travel. Since the [[German reunification|reunification]] of Germany, all German citizens are issued [[German passport]]s.

== Overview ==
According to a ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' report in 1989, only 25% of East Germans were passport holders.&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McCartney|first1=Robert J.|title=East Germany Opens Berlin Wall And Borders, Allowing Citizens To Travel Freely To The West|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/11/10/east-germany-opens-berlin-wall-and-borders-allowing-citizens-to-travel-freely-to-the-west/98a8e433-efba-44a9-bd42-0c6781375d66/|accessdate=10 January 2018|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=10 November 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an East German passport law in 1957, East German citizens needed a visa to travel abroad, including [[West Germany]] and [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Kalinovsky|editor1-first=Artemy M.|editor2-last=Daigle|editor2-first=Craig|title=The Routledge Handbook of the Cold War|date=2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-315-88228-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tpnAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT137&amp;lpg=PT137&amp;dq=east+german+passport+law&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Sd2GXryMoU&amp;sig=YOjo7AYphD3FK12VG7BwsiqP29I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj--qza-s7YAhUKzWMKHWh_DqIQ6AEIczAP#v=onepage&amp;q=east%20german%20passport%20law&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The penalty for making an unauthorized journey outside East Germany was imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aftermath 1949 -- 1959|url=https://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/BERLIN_A/AFTERMAT.HTM|website=[[Harry S. Truman Presidential Library and Museum|Harry S. Truman Presidential Library &amp; Museum]]|quote=1957: A new passport law provided for three years' imprisonment for anyone making an unauthorized journey outside the borders of East Germany...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once they return from their travels, the passports needed to be turned in.&lt;ref name="WaPo"/&gt;

== Types of passports ==
There were at least four types of passports: alien, service, standard, and diplomatic.&lt;ref name="PassportType"&gt;{{cite web|title=East German Passport Types|url=https://www.passport-collector.com/east-german-passport-types/|website=Passport-collector.com|accessdate=10 January 2018|date=20 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PassportCollectorFact"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Passport of the German Democratic Republic (GDR)|url=https://www.passport-collector.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/GDR-passport-history.pdf|website=Passport-collector.com|accessdate=10 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While standard passports were blue in color, alien and service passports were in different shades of green.&lt;ref name="PassportType"/&gt; Diplomatic passports were in red.&lt;ref name="PassportType"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyMail"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilkinson|first1=James|title=From Stalin’s Soviet Union to East Germany and British Palestine: The extraordinary historical passports to countries that no longer exist - including a European state that lasted just four years|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4373648/See-passports-countries-no-longer-exist.html|accessdate=10 January 2018|date=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Languages==
East German passports contained text in German, French, English, and Russian.&lt;ref name="PassportCollectorFact"/&gt; English, however, was omitted from the passport after a revision in or around 1988.&lt;ref name="PassportCollectorFact"/&gt;

==Passport note==

East German passports contained a note to the effect that:

::''The Ministry of Foreign Affairs asks all authorities both inland and abroad to let the bearer of this passport travel freely and to grant him any protection and assistance that he might require.''&lt;ref name="PassportCollectorFact"/&gt;

Versions issued in late 1989 forward to the country's [[Die Wende|demise in October 1990]] omit the note.&lt;ref name="PassportCollectorFact"/&gt;

== Following reunification ==
Following reunification, the Unification Treaty provided that East German passports would remain in force until, at the latest, 31 December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paßgesetz der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik|url=http://www.verfassungen.de/de/ddr/passgesetz79.htm|accessdate=11 January 2018|language=[[German language|German]]|quote=Einigungsvertrag vom 31. August 1990 (BGBl. II S. 889) mit der Maßgabe, dass die ausgestellten Pässe bis spätestens zum 31. Dezember 1995 in Geltung bleiben}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that date, East German passports were invalid for identification and citizens had to use [[German passport]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1141">The '''''Eastern Province Herald''''' is a newspaper, founded in 1845 and based in [[Port Elizabeth]], [[South Africa]]. 

The paper was founded by Scottish immigrant [[John Paterson (Cape politician)|Jock Paterson]] on 7 May 1845. Paterson was still contracted by the state, making the move illegal, so the paper was in the name of his partner John Phillip, as the official owner. After the two men fought, Paterson stopped publication and later sold the newspaper in 1857 to his friend [[Robert Godlonton]] who owned the ''[[Grahamstown Journal]]''. Philip opened the competing ''[[Port Elizabeth Mercury]]'' newspaper. 

In the mid-1870s the [[Cape Colony]] underwent a massive economic and social growth, and the paper finally became a daily paper in 1878, as well as a full printing company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingstide.co.za/content.asp?PageID=422|title=King's Tide Boutique Hotel :.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2806">The British '''expedition to Ostend''' on 18 May 1798 was launched to destroy gun-boats harboured in [[Ostend]] and destined to take part in the planned invasion of Britain, and to destroy the infrastructure of the port including the locks, basin-gates, and sluices of the [[Bruges–Ostend Canal]]. It was a combined [[Royal Navy]] and [[British Army]] expedition under the command of Captain [[Home Riggs Popham|Home Popham]] (R.N.) and Major-General [[Eyre Coote (British Army officer)|Eyre Coote]]. The British destroyed their objectives, but the army contingent was captured by the French.

==History==
As Coote held the Dover army command, he was appointed to command the troops employed in the expedition, which Sir Home Popham had planned to cut the sluices at Ostend and thus flood that part of the Netherlands which was then in the possession of the French. The troops were only 1,300 in number. The Navy successfully disembarked them and they succeed in cutting the sluices as proposed on 18 May.{{sfn|Stephen|1887|p=161}} They also destroyed the lock-gates of the Bruges–Ostend Canal, which made canal navigation between Holland, Flanders, and France impossible.{{sfn|Field of Mars|1801|p=253}} This meant that any movement of barges had to be by sea, leaving them vulnerable to attack by the Royal Navy.

A high wind off the land then sprang up, and the ships could not come in to take the troops off. French troops were hurried up, and the small English force was completely hemmed in. After a desperate resistance, in which he lost six officers and 109 men killed and wounded, Coote, who was himself severely wounded, was forced to surrender (although he was shortly back in command at Dover after a prisoner exchange).{{sfn|Stephen|1887|p=161}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="790">In [[Sweden]], a '''folkpark''' is a public recreation space, usually featuring large grassed areas, trees, children's play facilities, etc. Most towns and cities have a folkpark. These parks were originally created by the [[labour movement]] so that [[worker]]s and their families could have a place to unwind. In larger folkparks, there is sometimes a [[bandstand]] or stage, and they are used for concerts and other entertainment. Summer folkpark tours are a traditional part of the touring circuit for bands, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkpark.nu/index.htm Folkparker] ''folkpark.nu''.

In addition to offering a three-year bachelor's degree in theology, the seminary offers graduate-level courses in cooperation with [[Uppsala University|Uppsala University and Linköping University]]. Today there are circa 300 students at the college/seminary, most of whom are preparing for ministry in the [[Swedish Evangelical Mission]] or the [[Church of Sweden]]. In addition, there is a [[Bible]] school located on campus offering a one-year certificate in theology. Also, certain programs have specific profiles, such as counselling or charismatic theology.

The School is owned and run by the [[Lutheran]] [[Swedish Evangelical Mission]] (In [[Swedish language|Swedish]]: ''Evangeliska fosterlandsstiftelsen'') and began its existence as a training institute for inland and overseas [[missionaries]]. For the last several decades, however, Sweden's own need for church leaders and clergy has been the school's primary focus, and most students enroll today with an eye to future ministry in Sweden, although a number of students also end up working internationally in a variety of mission agencies.

The School has several internationally well renowned scholars as affiliated researchers or professors, and publish the peer-reviewed Nordic Academic Journal ''Theofilos'' in cooperation with NLA, Norway.

The School has exchange programmes with the following theological institutions:
*[[Luther Seminary]] in [[Saint Paul]], [[Minnesota]], USA
*[[Wycliffe Hall]] of [[Oxford University]], [[England]] 
*[[Ethiopian Graduate School of Theology]] in [[Addis Ababa]], [[Ethiopia]]  
*[[MF Norwegian School of Theology]] in [[Oslo]], [[Norway]]

Since 2015, the president has been Prof. Dr. Kjell O. Lejon

The '''Katima Mulilo Bridge''' (also known as ''Bridge 508'' in the Namibian Bridge Register) carries the [[TransCaprivi Highway]] over the [[Zambezi River]] between [[Katima Mulilo]], [[Namibia]] and [[Sesheke]], [[Zambia]]. It is a [[road]] bridge, completed in 2004, 900 metres long and with 19 spans.&lt;ref name=Dierks&gt;[http://www.klausdierks.com/Namibian_Roads/Zambezi_bridge.htm Website of] Dr. [[Klaus Dierks]] [http://www.klausdierks.com/FrontpageMain.html], first Deputy Minister for Works, Transport and Communication in independent Namibia, involved in the planning and negotiations for the bridge, accessed 15 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; It links Namibia's [[Trans–Caprivi Highway]] to the Zambian road network, forming a section of the trade route from south-central Africa to the [[Atlantic]] known as the [[Walvis Bay]] Corridor. It is  also intended to carry [[tourism|tourist]] traffic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grnnet.gov.na/News/Archive/2004/may/week2/bridge_rpt.htm Speech of Dr. [[Sam Nujoma]]] at the bridge's opening ceremony, as published on the [http://www.grnnet.gov.na/ Government of Namibia Network] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121203072358/http://www.grnnet.gov.na/ |date=2012-12-03 }}, accessed 15 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for the [[bridge]] were first considered in Namibia in 1982, and the number 508 was allocated to the project. However, the [[History of Namibia|occupying]] [[South Africa]]n government was opposed to the project, and only after Namibian independence was planning resumed in 1990. 

In 2002 the [[contract]] for construction was awarded to [[Concor]] of [[South Africa]] and [[Hochtief]] of [[Germany]], with the bridge completed on schedule in 2004. The bridge was constructed using the German technique of [[incremental launching]] (''Taktschiebe-Verfahren''), with the deck of the bridge constructed on location then [[hydraulics|hydraulically]] pushed segment-by-segment across the river.&lt;ref name="Dierks" /&gt;

The bridge was officially opened by the [[President of Namibia]], Dr. [[Sam Nujoma]], and [[President of Zambia]], [[Levy Mwanawasa]] on 13 May 2004, in Katima Mulilo.

The '''Kucong''' ({{zh|s=苦聪人|t=苦聰人|p=Kǔcōng rén}}) is an ethnic group in [[China]] and it is considered one of the poorest minorities in the country. There are around 80,000 Kucong people and they live in five other countries, namely [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and the [[United States]], where at least 600 are living as migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peoples of the Buddhist World: A Christian Prayer Diary|last=Hattaway|first=Paul|publisher=William Carey Library|year=2004|isbn=1903689902|location=Pasadena, CA|pages=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the population, however, live in the [[Mojiang]], [[Xinping]], and [[Mengla]] counties of China's Yunnan Province. 

The Kucong found in [[Laos]] and are considered to be one the nation's more primitive groups. More than 3,000 Kucong inhabit at least 16 villages of northern part of the country. A subgroup of the Kucong in Laos are called Lahu Aga ('Bent Gourd Lahu') by other people because traditionally they wore a curved gourd around their necks. These are the reasons why the Kucong are often identified by some sources&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of China|last=Olson|first=James|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=1998|isbn=0313288534|location=Westport, CT|pages=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of Lahu group. There are sources, however, that cite distinctions between the two minorities. These point to key differences such as in the case of their languages. Although closely related, Kucong and Lahu are far from mutually intelligible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Atlas of Languages of Intercultural Communication in the Pacific, Asia, and the Americas|last=Wurm|first=Stephen|last2=Muhlhausler|first2=Peter|last3=Tryon|first3=Darrell|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|year=1996|isbn=3110134179|location=Berlin|pages=754}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Kucong are not recognized by the Chinese government as an official minority nationality, but they are officially being considered.&lt;ref name="Gladney" /&gt; The group has previously applied for a separate minority status but it was rejected in 1985. It is currently under the category of unclassified minorities in China.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The people are considered as invisible people since they have little contact with other ethnic groups and they also seldom let traders see them when they sell their wares to buy some necessities. Their houses are small and narrow and a house consists of a single room without divisions and without windows. The fire is in the center, where the family members sleep with their livestock. Today, they still keep a semi-nomadic existence, living mainly from hunting and gathering; and government subsidies. Kucong children also have difficulty going to school because the medium of instruction in schools near the places they live in is Mandarin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Negotiating Ethnicity in China: Citizenship as a Response to the State|last=Shih|first=Chih-yu|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=0415283728|location=London|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4486">Professor '''Kunibert Raffer''' (born 1951) is a development researcher. His main contributions are on international economic relations and the problems of [[unequal exchange]]. From 1979-1980 he was Associate Professor of Economics at the [[University of Vienna]] and from 1983-84 consultant to [[UNIDO]]. He was a visiting lecturer (1986–89) at the [[University of Klagenfurt]] and then Visiting Fellow of the Institute of Development Studies (IDS) at the [[University of Sussex]]. He spent 1990-93 as Honorary Research Fellow, Department of Commerce, [[University of Birmingham]] and in 1998 participated in the [[UNDP]]'s research project "International Development Cooperation and Global Public Goods". Since 2002 he has been Senior Associate of the [[New Economics Foundation]] (London), with a winter term (002-03) as visiting Professor at the Centre for the Study of International Institutions (CSI), SOWI Faculty, [[University of Innsbruck]].

His articles on [[Chapter 11]] of US Title 11 ([[Bankruptcy]]) in the context of the problem of sovereignty created a veritable flood of international reactions. In 1987 Raffer proposed to internationalise the basic features of the US [[Chapter 9]], maintaining that its essential points can be applied to sovereign borrowers immediately and without problems. There were numerous academic responses.&lt;ref&gt;Eichengreen, Barry (1999) Toward a New International Financial Architecture: A Practical Post-Asia Agenda, Institute for International Economics: Washington DC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, Kenneth (1999) "Global Financial Instability: Framework, Events, Issues", The Journal of Economic Perspectives 13(4), pp.21ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dabrowski, Martin , Rolf Eschenburg &amp; Karl Gabriel (Hg) (2000) Lösungsstrategien zur Überwindung der Internationalen Schuldenkrise (Volkswirtschaftliche Schriften, Heft 509), Duncker &amp; Humblot: Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rogoff, Kenneth &amp; Jeromin Zettelmeyer (2002) "Bankruptcy Procedures for Sovereigns: A History of Ideas, 1976–2001", IMF Staff Papers 49(3), pp.470ff&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martin Dabrowski, Andreas Fisch, Karl Gabriel &amp; Christoph Lienkamp (Hg) (2003) Die Diskussion um ein Insolvenzrecht für Staaten, Bewertungen eines Lösungsvorschlages zur Überwindung der Internationalen Schuldenkrise, Duncker &amp; Humblot, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;P.K. Rao (2003) Development Finance, Springer, Berlin etc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International reception==
Raffer was given the opportunity to discuss his ideas with [[Members of the European Parliament]] on 7 December 2005 as a guest speaker at the Workshop on the [[International Monetary Fund]] in [[Brussels]], and on 9 June 1992 at a Roundtable with MPs on international insolvency at [[Strasbourg]]. In the US, Raffer's proposal was incorporated into the "Global Development Resolution", initiated by Rep. [[Bernie Sanders]] (for the [[106th Congress]], 1st Session). Other legislative assemblies, reciting to Raffer's proposals, were the Argentine Parliament in [[Buenos Aires]], the Uruguayan Parliament (Palacio Legislativo), and the Indonesian Parliament in [[Jakarta]]. On 18 March 1999, Raffer was invited to present his ideas at a consultative meeting between the international [[Jubilee 2000]] campaign, representatives of the [[G7|G-7 governments]] and the [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]] institutions on [[developing countries' debt]]s in [[London]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17913">The globalization of [[National Hockey League]] has been occurring since its inception.  The early years saw a largely Canadian league, with some Americans playing. As the league progressed it experienced an influx of European players, at first from Western European countries, such as Sweden. After the fall of Communism, players from Eastern European countries, such as the former Czechoslovakia and Soviet Union, joined the league.  The NHL eventually saw fewer European players, but more players from Canada and the United States.  Today the NHL has players from five continents.  The following is a '''list of countries and the first person born there that played in the National Hockey League.'''  These players are not necessarily the first citizen of each respective country to play in the NHL, as nationality is determined under a nation's [[nationality law]] and may differ. Additionally, some countries have had citizens play in the NHL, but have never had a ''native-born'' player reach the league. One current example of this is [[Australia]]; while the country saw its first citizen reach the league in 2017, said player ([[Nathan Walker]]) had been born in the United Kingdom.

Most statistical sources in the sport follow the convention of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]] in classifying players by the currently existing countries in which their birthplaces are located.

[[File:Denali Mt McKinley.jpg|thumb|400px|[[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Elevation|highest]] [[Summit|mountain peak]] of [[North America]].  Denali is the third most [[Topographic prominence|topographically prominent]] and third most [[Topographic isolation|topographically isolated]] [[summit]] on Earth after [[Mount Everest]] and [[Aconcagua]].]]

The following sortable table comprises the '''124 [[Summit|mountain peaks]] of [[North America|greater North America]]&lt;ref name=NA&gt;This article defines [[North America|greater North America]] as the portion of the [[Continent|continental landmass]] of the [[Americas]] extending westward and northward from the [[Isthmus of Panama]] plus the [[Island|ocean islands]] surrounding that landmass.  This article defines the ocean islands of greater North America to include the [[Island#Continental islands|coastal islands]] of [[Geography of North America|North America]], the [[Caribbean|islands of the Caribbean Sea]], the [[Lucayan Archipelago]], the [[List of islands of Greenland|islands of Greenland]] ([[Greenland|Kalaallit Nunaat]]), the [[List of islands of Canada|islands of Canada]], and the [[List of islands of Alaska|islands of Alaska]].  The [[Hawaiian Islands]] are not included because they are considered part of [[Oceania]].&lt;/ref&gt; with at least {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[elevation]] and at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]]'''.&lt;ref name=major&gt;This article defines a significant summit as a summit with at least {{convert|100|m|1|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of [[topographic prominence]], and a major summit as a summit with at least {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.  All summits in this article have at least 500&amp;nbsp;meters of topographic prominence.  An [[Ultra-prominent peak|ultra-prominent summit]] is a summit with at least {{convert|1500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} of topographic prominence.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[summit]] of a mountain or hill may be measured in three principal ways:
#The [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] of a summit measures the height of the summit above a [[Geoid|geodetic sea level]].&lt;ref name=NAVD_88&gt;All elevations in the 48 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[contiguous United States]] include an elevation adjustment from the [[National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929]] ([[NGVD 29]]) to the [[North American Vertical Datum of 1988]] ([[NAVD 88]]).  For further information, please see this [[United States National Geodetic Survey]] [http://www.ngs.noaa.gov/faq.shtml#WhatVD29VD88 note].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range&gt;If the elevation or prominence of a summit is calculated as a range of values, the [[arithmetic mean]] is shown.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is a measure of how high the summit rises above its surroundings.&lt;ref name=prominence&gt;The [[topographic prominence]] of a summit is the [[Elevation|topographic elevation]] difference between the summit and its [[Topographic prominence#Definitions|highest or key col to a higher summit]].  The summit may be near its key col or quite far away.  The key col for [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] is the [[Isthmus of Rivas]] in [[Nicaragua]], {{convert|7642|km|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} away.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=range/&gt;
#The [[topographic isolation]] (or radius of dominance) of a summit measures how far the summit lies from its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;ref name=isolation&gt;The [[topographic isolation]] of a summit is the [[great-circle distance]] to its nearest point of equal elevation.&lt;/ref&gt;

In greater North America, only [[Denali]] exceeds {{convert|6000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation.  Three major summits exceed {{convert|5500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, [[List of the major 5000-meter summits of North America|11 exceed {{convert|5000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}]], 21 exceed {{convert|4500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, the following 124 major summits exceed {{convert|4000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, 277 exceed {{convert|3500|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}}, and [[List of the major 3000-meter summits of North America|401 exceed {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=off|comma=5|sp=us}} elevation]].

'''''Loyalties''''' is a 1999 Canadian documentary film directed by [[Lesley Ann Patten]] about two women—one white, one black—who discover that they are related due to the  legacy of [[slavery in the United States]]. In 1995, Dr. Ruth Whitehead of the [[Nova Scotia Museum of Natural History]] in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]] met [[Black Canadian]] graduate student Carmelita Robertson, who happened to mention that her relatives came to [[Nova Scotia]] from [[South Carolina]] as [[Black Loyalists]] in the late 18th century. Whitehead, whose own family also came from South Carolina, realized that she recognized some of the names of Robertson's ancestors, and together the two women journey to [[Charleston, South Carolina]] to explore their shared past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Movies &amp; video|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aJhIAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=XAoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3694%2C724763|accessdate=15 July 2012|newspaper=[[The Post and Courier]]|location=Charleston|date=18 March 1999|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The film also exposes strains in the personal relationship between the two women, with Whitehead descended from wealthy slave owners, and Robertson the descendant of their slaves.&lt;ref name=North&gt;{{cite book|title=North of Everything: English-Canadian Cinema Since 1980|publisher=University of Alberta Press|isbn=978-0888643902|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLNhHWfarosC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=Loyalties+NFB+Leslie+patten&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=m4CdGyIn4-&amp;sig=mEWs8Bw07vDYAzoyvC1ngFqHgTQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TpL_T5qZBKrk0QG_o8TqBw&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Loyalties%20NFB%20Leslie%20patten&amp;f=false|editor=William Beard and Gerry White|page=37|chapter=Brave New Film Board|date=1 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Butcher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Butcher|first=Kristen|title=Loyalties|journal=Canadian Materials|date=8 September 2000|volume=VII|issue=1|url=http://www.umanitoba.ca/cm/vol7/no1/loyalties.html|accessdate=13 July 2012|publisher=Manitoba Library Association|ISSN=1201-9364| format=Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mfumu'eto''''' is a [[magazine]], that was established in the 1990s by a high priest named Mfumu'eto. This individual ran a one-man publishing empire on the streets of [[Kinshasa]]. His arsenal of little [[comic books]], written in [[Lingala]], [[Tshiluba]] and [[French language|French]], were made on low-quality paper. These comic books were self-produced using stencils and photocopying machines and distributed informally in the market place. The comic books quickly gained notoriety for their controversial attacks against the political powers of the 1990s in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].

Along with other low-cost and locally distributed magazines, such as ''Fula Ngenge'', Mfumu'eto's comics inaugurated the era of the author as the producer in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]'s literary world. Like other comics produced in Kinshasa at the time they were heavily influenced by urban culture. Mfumu'Eto also drew inspiration from local traditions, combining African traditional medicine with religion, pulp fiction with politics,and  irony with attitude. This culminated into an eclectic display that directly contested dominant colonial systems of knowledge.

His most famous series includes the politically propulsive ''A Nguma Meli Muasi Ya Na Kati Kinshasa'', first published in 1990 and which was subsequently banned by the authorities.  Mfumu'Eto work was exhibited in Europe and the US in 2011, following the international success of popular painters such as [[Cheri Samba]] and the growing interest in African comics.

As [[Antarctica]] has never been permanently settled by humans, there has historically been little '''military activity in the Antarctic'''. Because the [[Antarctic Treaty System|Antarctic Treaty]], which came into effect on June 23, 1961, bans military activity in Antarctica, military personnel and equipment may only be used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose (such as delivering supplies) on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Wikisource |first= |authorlink= |title = Antarctic Treaty |work= |publisher= |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Antarctic_Treaty |format= |doi= |accessdate=2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Antarctic Treaty specifically prohibits military activity on land or [[ice shelf|ice shelves]] below 60°S.  While the use of [[nuclear weapons]] is absolutely prohibited, the Treaty does not apply to naval activity within these bounds (in the [[Southern Ocean]]) so long as it takes place on the [[high seas]].

==Notable operations==
Military forces from many countries have provided support to scientific expeditions and bases in Antarctica. Notable operations and expeditions have included:
* [[Second voyage of James Cook|Commander James Cook's second voyage]] ([[United Kingdom]], 1773)
* [[USS Vincennes (1826)|USS ''Vincennes''' surveys of Antarctica]] ([[United States]], 1839 and 1840)
* In February 1941 the [[German auxiliary cruiser Komet|German auxiliary cruiser ''Komet'']] patrolled the [[Ross Sea]] and Antarctic coastline in an unsuccessful search for [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] [[whaler]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Asmussen |first=John |authorlink= |title=Hilfskreuzer (Auxiliary Cruiser) Komet |work= |publisher= |url=http://www.bismarck-class.dk/hilfskreuzer/komet.html |doi= |accessdate=2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Operation Tabarin]] (United Kingdom, 1944–45)
* [[Operation Highjump]] (United States, 1946–47)
* [[Base Soberania]] ([[Chile]], 1947)
* [[Operation Windmill]] (United States, 1947–48)
* [[Base General Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme|Base O'Higgins]] ([[Chile]], 1948) 
* The Australian auxiliary [[HMAS Wyatt Earp|HMAS ''Wyatt Earp'']] made an unsuccessful voyage to Antarctica in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=HMAS ''Wyatt Earp'' |publisher=Sea Power Centre Australia |url=http://www.navy.gov.au/hmas-wyatt-earp |accessdate=2008-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[González Videla Antarctic Base|Base González Videla]] ([[Chile]], 1951)
* [[Base Aguirre Cerda]] ([[Chile]], 1955)
* [[Operation Deep Freeze]] (United States, 1955–present)
* [[Operación 90]] ([[Argentina]], 1965)
* [[Base Presidente Frei]] ([[Chile]], 1980)
* [[Comandante Ferraz Antarctic Station]] ([[Brazil]], 1984)

* [[Estación Parodi]] ([[Chile]], 1999)
* [[Expedición Hielo I]] ([[Chile]], 2002)
* [[Chilean South Pole Expedition|Expedición Hielo II]] ([[Chile]], 2004)
* In January 2006, a [[Royal New Zealand Air Force]] [[P-3 Orion|P-3K Orion]] maritime patrol aircraft conducted a trial flight to and from [[Pegasus blue ice runway|Pegasus Airfield]] near [[McMurdo Station]] to determine the feasibility of conducting patrols from Antarctica in support of the [[Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=RNZAF Orion Lands on Antarctica |publisher=[[New Zealand Defence Force]] |date=17 January 2006 |url=http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/news/media-releases/20060117-rnzafoloa.htm |accessdate=2007-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; RNZAF P-3Ks have regularly conducted flights to and from Antarctica since this successful trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Air Force conducts early ice flight |url=http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/news/media-releases/20081030-aceif.htm |publisher=New Zealand Defence Force |date=2008-10-30 |accessdate=2008-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential for future conflicts==
[[John Keegan]] and [[Andrew Wheatcroft]], in their 1986 book 'Zones of Conflict: An Atlas of Future Wars', make the point that strategic interests in Antarctica derive from two causes: economic and strategic. Antarctica has great potential economic value, in terms of mineral and oil resources. Strategically, there was continuing concern about keeping the [[Cape Horn]] route available for free passage during the Cold War, as, among other things, U.S. aircraft carriers cannot pass through the [[Panama Canal]]. The [[Falkland Islands]], Keegan and Wheatcroft go on to say, dominate the [[Drake Passage]], the 'stretch of stormy water separating South America from the Antarctic'. This was a less publicised factor during the [[Falklands War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keegan |first=John |authorlink=John Keegan |author2=Andrew Wheatcroft |title=Zones of Conflict: An Atlas of Future Wars |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1986 |location=New York |pages= |url= |doi= |isbn=0-671-60115-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, with the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]], and increasing competition for fossil fuel resources, the 'economic' rather than the 'strategic' rationale will likely grow more important in the early twenty-first century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bergin |first=Anthony |title=Six reasons Antarctica is crucial |publisher=[[Australian Financial Review]] |pages=63 |date=20 February 2007 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National High Court''' ({{Lang-is|Landsyfirréttur í Reykjavík}}, {{Lang-da|Landsoverretten i Reykjavik}}) was a [[high court]] in [[Iceland]] established in 1800. The court was established due to dissatisfaction with the [[High Court (Iceland)|High Court]] which had been the high court of the country from 1563. In 1920, the [[Supreme Court of Iceland]] was established replacing the National High Court.

'''Operation Spider''' or '''Project Spider''' is a [[surveillance]] programme by [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] (IRGC) to monitor [[Iran]]ian internet users on [[social media]] such as [[Facebook]]. The operation was publicized in January 2015 with a statement by IRGC's "The Center for Investigation of Organized Crime". The program is said to be expanding to [[Instagram]], [[Viber]], and [[WhatsApp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/r-irans-guards-increase-monitoring-of-social-media-state-tv-2015-3|first=Sam |last=Wilkin |first2=Mehrdad |last2=Balali|title=Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards are ramping up domestic surveillance|date=March 2, 2015|accessdate=March 30, 2015|work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Operation Spider II was used to detect Iranian models posting images of themselves online not wearing a headscarf. The models were subsequently charged with “promoting western promiscuity”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/16/iranian-models-arrested-for-posting-pictures-without-headscarves/|first=Richard |last=Spencer |title=Iranian models arrested and forced to give public self-criticism for posting pictures without headscarves |accessdate=May 15, 2018|work=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian models were arrested and forced to give public self-criticism for posting the pictures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/iran-arrests-8-people-spider-ii-operation-targeting-models-posing-online-without-2369545|first= Vishakha  |last= Sonawane |title=Iran Arrests 8 People In Spider II Operation Targeting Models Posing Online Without Headscarves |accessdate=May 15, 2018|work=IB Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2015 Arrests ==
Since September 2014, the IRGC intensified its review of [[Facebook]] pages, and that 350 Facebook pages managed by 36 individuals had been identified and 130 of them deleted from Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iranhumanrights.org/2015/03/facebook-users-arrested/|title=Facebook Users Arrested, Others Will Be Arrested Soon, IRGC Warns|date=March 13, 2015|accessdate=March 30, 2015|work=International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2015, 12 Iranian Facebook users were arrested and 24 other citizens were summoned to answer questions about their Facebook activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.iranhumanrights.org/2015/02/facebook-arrests/|title=Iran’s IRGC Intensifies Crackdown on Facebook Users with 12 Arrests and 24 Summonses|date= February 5, 2015 |accessdate=March 30, 2015|work=International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, a statement by the Center for Investigation of Organized Cyber Crimes was published that stated several Facebook users had been arrested in a surveillance project by the IRGC named “Operation Spider” that is aimed at identifying and rooting out Facebook pages and activities that spread “corruption” and western-inspired lifestyles. The statement also says they "received indirect and covert support from the Western governments and had targeted a remarkable number of Facebook users in the guise of cultural and social pages over a span of two years".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.tasnimnews.com/English/Home/Single/638880|title=Iran Busts Facebook Band Involved in Criminal Acts |date=January 31, 2015|accessdate=March 30, 2015|work=[[Tasnim News Agency]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rooke Battery''' is a now derelict [[artillery battery]] on the west side of the [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]] of [[Gibraltar]].

==Description==
The derelict battery can now be found on the [[Footpaths of Gibraltar#Royal Anglian Way|Royal Anglian Way]] which is named after the 2nd Battalion of the Royal Anglian Regiment, who refurbished it in August 1969. The path leads up the west side to the top of the Rock passing by this battery and [[Hayne's Cave Battery]].&lt;ref name=dg/&gt; 
[[File:Royal Anglian Way.gif|thumb|left|Location of the battery]]
The battery has a plaque labelled "1906" and it is named after Sir [[George Rooke]]&lt;ref name="Sayer1865"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sayer|first=Frederick|title=The History of Gibraltar and of Its Political Relation to Events in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q45MmghAoMgC&amp;pg=PA118|accessdate=29 March 2013|year=1865|publisher=Chapman and Hall|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; who commanded the British Fleet when Gibraltar came under British rule.

This battery's in 1907 had a [[BL 9.2 inch gun Mk IX–X]] on a Mk. V mounting which was protected against severe damage because it had an underground magazine and shelter. The popular 9.2-inch guns were also installed high on the rock at [[Spur Battery]], [[Breakneck Battery]] and similar locations. The gun is known to have still been here in 1928.&lt;ref name=dg/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1672">The '''Tielt Formation''' ({{lang-nl|Formatie van Tielt}}; {{lang-fr|Formation de Tielt}}; abbreviation: Tt; named after the town of [[Tielt]] in [[West-Flanders]]) is a [[formation (stratigraphy)|geologic formation]] in the [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]] of [[Belgium]]. The formation [[outcrop|crops out]] in the north of [[Hainaut (province)|Hainaut]], in the southern and central parts of West- and [[East-Flanders]] and in [[Walloon Brabant|Walloon]] and [[Flemish Brabant]]. It consists of [[marine (ocean)|marine]] very fine [[sand]] and [[silt]], deposited in the shallow sea that covered Belgium during the middle and late [[Ypresian]] [[age (geology)|age]] (early [[Eocene]], about 50 million years ago).

The Tielt Formation is 50 metres thick at most. It is subdivided into three [[member (stratigraphy)|members]]: the [[Kortemark Member]], the [[Egemkapel Member]] and the [[Egem Member]] ([[glauconite|glauconiferous]] fine sand). The formation lies stratigraphically on top of the [[Kortrijk Formation]] (early Ypresian sandy clay and silt). In the northwestern part of Belgium, the [[Gentbrugge Formation]] (late Ypresian marine clay and silt) covers the Tielt Formation. If the Gentbrugge Formation is absent, the younger [[Brussel Formation]] ([[Lutetian]] calcareous sand) is directly found on top of the Tielt Formation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14772">{{Taxation}}
A '''withholding tax''', or a '''retention tax''', is an [[income tax]] to be paid to the government by the payer of the income rather than by the recipient of the income. The tax is thus withheld or deducted from the income due to the recipient.  In most jurisdictions, withholding tax applies to [[employment]] income. Many jurisdictions also require withholding tax on payments of [[interest]] or [[dividend]]s. In most jurisdictions, there are additional withholding tax obligations if the recipient of the income is resident in a different jurisdiction, and in those circumstances withholding tax sometimes applies to [[royalties]], [[renting|rent]] or even the sale of [[real estate]].  Governments use withholding tax as a means to combat [[tax evasion]], and sometimes impose additional withholding tax requirements if the recipient has been delinquent in filing tax returns, or in industries where tax evasion is perceived to be common.

Typically the withholding tax is treated as a payment on account of the recipient's final tax liability, when the withholding is made in advance.  It may be refunded if it is determined, when a [[wikt:tax return|tax return]] is filed, that the recipient's tax liability to the government which received the withholding tax is less than the tax withheld, or additional tax may be due if it is determined that the recipient's tax liability is more than the withholding tax.  In some cases the withholding tax is treated as discharging the recipient's tax liability, and no tax return or additional tax is required. Such withholding is known as final withholding. 

The amount of withholding tax on income payments other than employment income is usually a fixed percentage.  In the case of employment income the amount of withholding tax is often based on an estimate of the employee's final tax liability, determined either by the employee or by the government.

==Basics==
Some governments have written laws which require taxes to be paid before the money can be spent for any other purpose. This ensures the taxes will be paid first and will be paid on time, rather than risk the possibility that the tax-payer might [[default (finance)|default]] at the time when tax falls due in arrears.

Typically, withholding is required to be done by the employer of someone else, taking the tax payment funds out of the employee or contractor's salary or wages. The withheld taxes are then paid by the employer to the government body that requires payment, and applied to the account of the employee, if applicable.  The employee may also be required by the government to file a tax return self-assessing one's tax and reporting withheld payments.

==Income taxes==

===Wage withholding===
{{see also|Payroll tax}}
Most developed countries operate a wage withholding tax system. In some countries, [[subnational]] governments require wage withholding so that both national and subnational taxes may be withheld.  In the [[Tax withholding in the United States|U.S.]],&lt;ref&gt;See U.S. [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf Publication 15], which includes withholding tables for income tax. State requirements vary by state; for an example, see the New York state portal for [http://www.tax.ny.gov/bus/wt/wtidx.htm withholding tax].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Payroll tax#Canada|Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;See [[Canada Revenue Agency]] [http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/t4001/t4001-09e.pdf Publication T4001]. Canada Revenue Agency also provides significant online guidance accessible through a web [http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/payroll/index.html index], including an online [http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/esrvc-srvce/tx/bsnss/pdoc-eng.html payroll tax calculator].&lt;/ref&gt; and others, the federal and most state or provincial governments, as well as some local governments, require such withholding for income taxes on payments by employers to employees.  Income tax for the individual for the year is generally determined upon filing a tax return after the end of the year.

The amount withheld and paid by the employer to the government is applied as a prepayment of income taxes and is refundable if it exceeds the income tax liability determined on filing the tax return. In such systems, the employee generally must make a representation to the employer regarding factors that would influence the amount withheld.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw4.pdf Form W-4].&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, the tax authorities publish guidelines for employers to use in determining the amount of income tax to withhold from wages.

The [[Payroll tax#United Kingdom|United Kingdom]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/paye/intro/basics.htm PAYE for employers: the basics]&lt;/ref&gt; and certain other jurisdictions operate a withholding tax system known as [[pay-as-you-earn tax|pay-as-you-earn]] (PAYE), although the term "withholding tax" is not commonly used in the UK.  Unlike many other withholding tax systems, PAYE systems generally aim to collect all of an employee's tax liability through the withholding tax system, making an end of year tax return redundant. However, taxpayers with more complicated tax affairs must file tax returns.

[[Payroll tax#Australia|Australia]] operates a [[pay-as-you-go tax|pay-as-you-go]] (PAYG) system, which is similar to PAYE. The system applies only at the federal level, as the individual states do not collect income taxes.&lt;ref&gt;See the Australian Tax Office's [http://www.ato.gov.au/businesses/content.asp?doc=/content/31962.htm&amp;pc=001/003/079/001/004&amp;mnu=&amp;mfp=&amp;st=&amp;cy=1 PAYG withholding] web page for details and tools.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other domestic withholding===
Some systems require that income taxes be withheld from certain payments other than wages made to domestic persons. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] requires withholding of tax on payments of interest on deposits by banks and building societies to individuals.&lt;ref&gt;See Irish Tax &amp; Customs [http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/dirt/index.html Deposit Interest Retention Tax].&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. requires payers of dividends, interest, and other "reportable payments" to individuals to withhold tax on such payments in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/3406- 26 USC 3406], Backup Withholding.  Withholding applies to individuals who have not provided the payee a tax identification number or failed to certify that they are is subject to backup withholding or with respect to whom the IRS has notified the payee that backup withholding applies. The rate of withholding tax is the fourth lowest rate of tax for individuals.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australia]] requires payers of interest, dividends and other payments to withhold an amount when the payee does not provide a [[tax file number]] or [[Australian Business Number]] to the payer. [[India]] enforces withholding tax also on payments between companies and not just from companies to individuals, under the [[Tax Deducted at Source|TDS]] system. (Since April 2016, the [[United Kingdom]] has discontinued withholding tax on interest and dividends, though in some cases this income will become liable for taxation through other means).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/dividend-allowance-factsheet/dividend-allowance-factsheet Dividend Allowance factsheet ]] [[HMRC]], 17 August 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social insurance taxes (social security)==
Many countries (and/or subdivisions thereof) have social insurance systems that require payment of taxes for retirement annuities and medical coverage for retirees. Most such systems require that employers pay a tax to cover such benefits.&lt;ref&gt;See for example [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/3111- 26 USC 3111]; ATO [http://www.ato.gov.au/content/downloads/SPR00108513n71038.pdf Publication 71038], Super: What employers need to know. Some systems, for example, [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]] levy a [http://www.osr.nsw.gov.au/taxes/payroll/ payroll tax] independently of a social insurance system.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some systems also require that employees pay such taxes.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/3102- 26 USC 3102].&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the employees are required to pay the tax, it is generally withheld from the payment of wages and paid by the employer to the government. Social insurance tax rates may be different for employers than for employees.  Most systems provide an upper limit on the amount of wages subject to social insurance taxes.&lt;ref&gt;These limits may vary by country and year. For 2009, the U.S. income limit on the retirement portion (6.2%) of social security tax was $106,800, versus $102,000 for 2008, and there was no limit on the medicare portion (1.45%) of the tax; see Publication 15, supra. Canadian wages subject to [[Canada Pension Plan]] were limited to $46,390 of the excess over $3,500 for 2009, at a tax rate of 4.95%; see Publication T4001, supra. UK [http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/nitables/ca38.pdf National Insurance contributions] are due for earnings above the Earnings Threshold (£110 weekly) up to a limit that varies depending on other coverage.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International withholding==
Most countries require payers of interest, dividends and royalties to non-resident payees (generally, if a non-domestic postal address is in the payers records) withhold from such payment an amount at a specific rate.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_3_30_A.html 26 USC 1441-1446], IRS Publication 515, CRA Publication [http://www.cra-arc.gc.ca/E/pub/tg/t4061/t4061-09e.pdf T4061].&lt;/ref&gt;  Payments of rent may also be subject to withholding tax or may be taxed as business income.&lt;ref&gt;For example, U.S. rules provide that rentals that rise to the level of a trade or business are not subject to withholding taxes, but other rental income may be subject to 30% withholding tax. An election may be available under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/871- 26 USC 871(d)] or an applicable [[tax treaty]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The amounts may vary by type of income. A few jurisdictions treat fees paid for technical consulting services as royalties subject to withholding of tax.{{Citation needed|reason=India citation needed|date=September 2011}}{{Citation needed|reason=Pakistan citation needed|date=September 2011}}  Income [[tax treaties]] may reduce the amount of tax for particular types of income paid from one country to residents of the other country.

Some countries require withholding by the purchaser of real property.  The U.S. also imposes a 10% withholding tax on the gross sales price of a U.S. real property interest unless advance IRS approval is obtained for a lower rate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/897- 26 USC 897] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1445- 26 USC 1445].  The lower rate of withholding is requested by filing IRS [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8288b.pdf Form 8288-B] by the sale closing date.&lt;/ref&gt; Canada imposes similar rules for 25% withholding, and withholding on sale of business real property is 50% of the price, but may be reduced on application.

The European Union has issued directives prohibiting taxation on companies by one member state of dividends from subsidiaries in other member state,&lt;ref&gt;The [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31990L0435:EN:HTML parent/subsidiary directive].&lt;/ref&gt; except in some cases,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=t0Z_Jla7D1gC&amp;dq=salvador+trinxet&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=4y2M7NB-c4&amp;sig=xosb_2rlC-Q3B5DuIYCkdsgXezc&amp;hl=es&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=wQFNUPDjI4HQ9ASr_ICoBA&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBTgK [[Parent Subsidiary Directive]], by Salvador Trinxet Llorca]&lt;/ref&gt; interest on debt  obligations, or royalties&lt;ref&gt;The [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003L0049:en:HTML [[interest and royalties directive]]].&lt;/ref&gt; received by a resident of another member nation.

Procedures vary for obtaining reduced withholding tax under income tax treaties.  Procedures for recovery of excess amounts withheld vary by jurisdiction. In some, recovery is made by filing a tax return for the year in which the income was received. Time limits for recovery vary greatly.

Taxes withheld may be eligible for a [[foreign tax credit]] in the payee's home country.

==Remittance to tax authorities==
Most withholding tax systems require withheld taxes to be remitted to tax authorities within specified time limits, which time limits may vary with the withheld amount. Remittance by [[electronic funds transfer]] may be required&lt;ref&gt;The U.S. requires remittance electronically within no later than the following business day when the balance of unremitted amounts exceeds $100,000, and other thresholds apply; see IRS Publication 15, supra, p. 23. Canada requires remittance within three business days of the end of the quarter-monthly period in which withholding occurs for Threshold 2 remitters; see CRA Publication T-4001, supra., p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; or preferred.
	  		  	
Penalties for delay or failure to remit withheld taxes to tax authorities can be severe.&lt;ref&gt;Penalties of up to 100% may be assessed against a withholding agent under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/6672- 26 USC 6672] for intentional failure to withhold and remit. The penalty may be assessed against any person, including a corporate officer or employee, having custody or control of the funds.&lt;/ref&gt; The sums withheld by a business is regarded as a debt to the tax authority, so that on bankruptcy of the business the tax authority stands as an unsecured creditor; however, sometimes the tax authority has legislative priority over other creditors.

==Reporting==
Nearly all systems imposing withholding tax requirements also require reporting of amounts withheld in a specified manner. Copies of such reporting are usually required to be provided to both the person on whom the tax is imposed and to the levying government.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, IRS Form W-2 and CRA Form T4 with respect to employees, and IRS Form 1042 and CRA Form NR4 with respect to payments to foreign persons.&lt;/ref&gt;  Reporting is generally required annually for amounts withheld with respect to wages. Reporting requirements for other payments vary, with some jurisdictions requiring annual reporting and others requiring reporting within a specified period after the withholding occurs.
