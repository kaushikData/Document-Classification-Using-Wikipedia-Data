A live-action adaptation of the animated series (either a TV series or a movie) is in talks. A teaser pilot titled ''Darkly'' was produced in 2016 by Play Entertainment and Mad Rocket Entertainment, adapted by Daniele Cosci and directed by Alessio Liguori, with Alessandro Danzi as Sulfus, Demetra Bellina as Raf and Denise Tantucci as Reina. The plot is aimed to an older audience and follows a darker storyline, where Raf and Sulfus are killed by Reina and reborn as humans without memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|language=Italian|url=http://www.lastampa.it/2016/02/16/edizioni/asti/il-giovane-attore-diventa-un-demone-O9AYRY16R0I083qHOnXVbI/pagina.html|title=Il giovane attore diventa un “demone”|date=16 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Four Angels (Raf, Uri, Sweet and Miki) and four Devils (Sulfus, Cabiria, Kabale and Gas) are sent to Earth, in an unused area of the Golden School, where they learn everything they need to become Guardian Angels and Guardian Devils. The Angels and Devils are required to form pairs as part of their education, each of which will have to deal with a human being, known as Earthly Ones, and help them choose between the right and wrong way in life without being discovered. Angels and Devils cannot operate at the same time, so they decide, clashing in the Challenge Room, who will work first. Moreover, they are subject to the V.E.T.O. (Vetoed from Exposing, Touching or Obstructing/Overhearing in the comic – {{lang-it|Vietato Esporsi, Toccare, Ostacolare/Origliare}}).

===Comic plot===
While the Angels and Devils are attending their stage on Earth, the planet is threatened by ancient creatures, the Reliveds, led by a mysterious man called Maliki. He was a Devil who gave up his eternal life because he loved a human woman, named Vera. When she left him, he decided to take revenge on all Angels, Devils and humans. As a result, the Angels and Devils form an alliance to fight against him.

===Cartoon plot===

====First season====
The evil Neutral One Reina, imprisoned in the Limbo with her slave Maliki, wants to take revenge of Angels and Devils who confined her. To get free, a sacrilege is necessary: because of this, she exploits the rising feelings between Raf, an Angel, and Sulfus, a Devil, forcing them to kiss. The sacrilege breaks the chains and Reina, once free, tells the truth about her origins to Raf: she was born a Terrestrian and was adopted by the Tall Spheres when her parents, two powerful sovereigns, died during the struggle between Angels and Devils. The Neutral One persuades Raf to enter in the Hall of Portraits to see her parents' faces: while the Angel is in, Reina steals all of the portraits to control the Earthly One's will. At the end of the first season, using the ''Prism Fly'' ability, Raf, the Angels and the Devils manage to defeat Reina. Raf discovers that her real father is Maliki, who sacrifices his life to save her, while her mother is imprisoned somewhere in an endless slumber.

====Second season====
After the Summer vacations, Angels and Devils return to the Golden School to begin the second year of their stage, there new Earthly Ones are given to them. Meanwhile, Sulfus is blackmailed by two masked eternals who hold in their possession Raf's mother: Angelie. In order to make sure Sulfus does not try to escape their control, a mysterious girl: Blu, watches over him. Raf and Sulfus' love is highly tested with the appearance of these new enemies and more mysteries about Raf's past are revealed. At the end of the second season, Raf and Sulfus learn that the School's Angel principle, Cassidy, and Devil principle, Kubral, manipulated them in order to destroy the V.E.T.O.'s scales and wage war against each other.

==Differences between comic and cartoon==
* In the comic, the main characters are younger: in fact, while in the cartoon they are the same age as Raf (15 "stars", as for the Angels, or "flashes", as for the Devils), in the comic the heroine is 12, Uri 11 and Miki 9; Sulfus is 13, Kabale and Gas 10, Cabiria is 11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Italian |url=http://www.mondotv.it/MondoTVspa/sitoweb_mondotv/angelsFriends_personaggi.php |title=Angel's Friends Personaggi |work=Mondo TV }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sweet (whose original Italian name is Dolce), Misha and Reina don't appear in the comic, while the Angel Ang-Lì, the Devil Mephisto, and Raoul, the Earthly one loved by Raf, aren't shown in the cartoon.
* In the comic, the hobbies of Angels and Devils are shown, while in the cartoon they are not. For example, Raf is keen on ecological remedies, such as beauty masks and infusions, Miki is a music expert, Kabale loves [[chemistry]], [[alchemy]] and [[numerology]]. Cabiria likes films, cartoons and comics and she's a director and an illustrator. Gabe is a genius of technology and uses a handheld.
* In the comic, Angels are part of a [[funk]] band, in which Raf is the vocalist, Gabe plays the keyboard, Miki the bass, Uri the drums and Ang-Lì the sax. The Devils have their own rock band: Sulfus plays the bass, Kabale the electric guitar, Cabiria the drums, Gas the keyboard and Mephisto is the vocalist.
* In the comic, Miki is repeating the school year because she tried to heal her Earthly one, breaking the V.E.T.O.. Sulfus behaves like a seducer, which doesn't happen in the cartoon.
* The character design of the cartoon is far different than that of the comic.
* In the comic, Arkhan and Temptel don't teach "positive Earthly life" and "negative Earthly life", but "positive Earthly infancy" and "negative Earthly infancy", as the characters are younger.

==Characters==
{{see also|List of Angel's Friends characters}}

==Places==
;Angie Town
:Angels' city, it's a peaceful town located in the [[Paradise]]. It's ruled by the High Spheres ({{lang-it|Alte Sfere}}), whose messengers are the seraphims.

'''Sulfur City''' ({{lang-it|Zolfanello City}})
:Devils' city, it's a chaotic place, located in [[Hell]]. It's ruled by the Low Spheres ({{lang-it|Basse Sfere}}), whose messengers are the malebolge. Also called "Match City".

;Earthly city
:It's the city where the Earthly ones live. Its name is unknown, but it looks like European metropolis.

;Golden School
:It's the school where the Earthly ones study, an old building located in the Earthly city. In an unused area, Angels and Devils attend their classes. In the middle, there is the Central Ala, where classrooms are located; in the same hallway, there's the Challenge Room ({{lang-it|Aula Sfida}}), where Angels and Devils clashes. In the tower there are the Dreaming Rooms ({{lang-it|Sognatori}}), Angels' dormitories, while underground there are the Incubators ({{lang-it|Incubatori}}), Devils' dormitories.

;Mistery House
:Reina and Maliki's house after leaving the Limbo. Previously, it was Raf's family's house.

;Limbo
:It's the place where Reina was imprisoned since her exile, a place outside the control of both the High and Low Spheres. Only a sacrilege between an Angel and a Devil is powerful enough to break the wall of the prison. Maliki also lives here with his mistress, but he's allowed to go to the real world.

;Path of Metamorphoses
:A legendary path, rich in trials and obstacles, which, if passed, would allow Angels or Devils to become human. Tyco and Sai decided to try it, but after reaching the end, they didn't manage to transform and were obliged to separate. In it, the Wind of Deceptions (or Wind of Metamorphoses) blows: it's a powerful wind that inhibits reasons and pulls humans, Angels and Devils to act impulsively. The Path of Metamorphoses appears for the first time in the movie ''Between Dream and Reality''. At the end of the second season, Raf and Sulfus made the decision to walk the path together.

;Sunny College
: It's the place where the Angels and Devils went to take summer classes together. They were taught about Earthly Acting.

;Princess Theater
: While the Angels and Devils were taking summer courses the Earthly Ones were assigned to perform a play at a nearby abandoned theater. The theater was closed down because Tyco didn't want to see plays that reminded him of his feelings for Sai.

== Episodes ==
The cartoon is produced by [[R.T.I.]], [[Mondo TV]] and [[Play Entertainment]], directed by [[Orlando Corradi]] and written by [[Francesco Arlanch]] and [[Francesco Balletta]]. However, the first one who realized the cartoon (26 episodes lasting 20 minutes each) was the Italian company [[Stranemani]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2doLuUh6Klg|title=Trailer of the first cartoon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stranemani.com/|title=Angel's Friends|work= Stranemani website}}&lt;/ref&gt; but during the comic festival in [[Cannes]] the version by Mondo TV was chosen, despite the Stranemani version using the same character designs from the comic.

=== First season (2009–2010) ===

A television movie based on the animated series and settled between the first and the second season aired, in Italy, on 23 April 2011. The movie focuses on the Angels attending the Summer School at the Sunny College in Alpinville, where Raf hopes she will not meet Sulfus. The Devils show up at the school and Raf tells Sulfus she has fallen in love with someone else. Meanwhile, the Earthly ones receive the task of refurbishing the Theatre of Princes ({{lang-it|Teatro dei Principi}}) and organising a play, ''Romeo &amp; Juliet'' by [[William Shakespeare]]. However, they are attacked by a mysterious hooded man who wants them to leave the theatre. The Angels and the Devils decide to investigate and find out the truth about Tyco and Sai's fate. At last, Raf and Sulfus conclude that they'll decide what to do about their future together once returned to the Golden School for the new term.

'''Azerbaijan State Pantomime Theatre''' ({{lang-az|Azərbaycan Dövlət Pantomim Teatrı}}) is a [[Mime artist|pantomime]] theatre in [[Baku]], [[Azerbaijan]].

==History==
The theatre was founded in 1994 by Bakhtiyar Khanizadeh, an actor of the [[Azerbaijan State Theatre of Young Spectators]]. He worked closely with students of the [[Azerbaijan State University of Culture and Arts]] and selected the ones he considered fit to establish the pioneer mime theatre studio in Azerbaijan. For the next 11 years, the theatre was based in the building of the Theatre of Young Spectators until relocated to the building of the Shafag Cinema. In 2000, the theatre received the status of a state theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.day.az/culture/264438.html Director of Azerbaijan Pantomime Theatre on Body Language, New Projects and Favourite Roles]. ''Day.az''. 28 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2000, the theatre has twice housed the Himjim International Pantomime festivals. As of 2009, it has toured 12 countries, its repertoire including 24 plays by both local and foreign playwrights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pantomima.az/az/faq.php?cat_id=1 Azerbaijan State Pantomime Theatre - Official Website].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Choto Shona Mosque''' ({{lang-bn|ছোট সোনা মসজিদ}}, ''Small Golden Mosque'') is located in [[Chapai Nawabganj]] district of Bangladesh. The mosque is situated about {{convert|3|km}} south of the Kotwali Gate and {{convert|0.5|km}} to the south-east of the [[Mughal Tahakhana]] complex in the [[Firozpur Quarter]].

==History==
[[File:Choto Sona Mosque 1808.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Choto Shona Mosque in 1808]]
[[File:Sona Masjid rear.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Choto Shona Mosque (rear view)]]
The mosque was built during the reign of [[Alauddin Husain Shah|Sultan Hussain Shah]], between 1493 and 1519. The fifteen domes of the mosque were once gilded, giving the mosque the name of ''Choto Shona Masjid'' (''Small Golden Mosque'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangladesh.com/religious-sites/chhota-sona-masjid/ Chhota Sona Masjid. Gaur | By Bangladesh Channel]. Bangladesh.com. Retrieved on 2012-08-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The mosque is one of the best-preserved [[sultana (title)|sultana]] monuments under protection by the Department of Archaeology and Museums, Governments of Bangladesh. The gilding that gave the building its name does not exist anymore. The mosque premise, which covers an area of 42 m from east to west by 43.5 m from north to south, was originally surrounded by an outer wall (now restored) with a gateway in the middle of the east side.
[[File:Sona2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Plaque at the entrance with a short history of the mosque]]

==Design==
[[File:ছোট সোনা মসজিদ, চাঁপাইনবাবগঞ্জ.jpg|thumb|Choto Sona Mosque, view from outside]]
Built of brick and stone, the mosque proper forms a rectangle having outside dimensions of {{convert|25.1|m|ft}} from north to south and {{convert|15.9|m|ft}} from east to west. All the four walls are veneered externally and to some extent also internally with granite stone blocks. These stones have disappeared from the southern side of the west wall because of conservation works after the destruction by the [[1897 Assam earthquake|earthquake of 1897]]. The four exterior angles of the building are strengthened with polygonal towers, of which nine facets are visible. The cornices are curvilinear and have stone gutters to drain off the rain water from the roof. There are five arched doorways in the eastern facade and three each on the north and south walls. Corresponding to the five archways in the east wall there are five semi-circular ''mihrabs'' inside the west wall. The stones of most of these miharbs have disappeared.

The interior of the mosque, measuring {{convert|21.2|by|12.2|m}}, is divided into three aisles by two rows of stone pillars, four in each row. A wide central nave has cut the aisles into halves, each half showing six equal square units with a side of 3.5 m. The nave has three rectangular units, each measuring 3.5 by 4.5 m. The interior of the mosque has therefore a total of fifteen units, of which the three rectangular units are covered with ''chauchala'' vaults, and the remaining twelve square units each by an inverted tumbler-shaped dome. They are all carried on radiating arches springing from the free-standing stone pillars and the engaged pilasters. The upper corners in between the arches of the square units are filled with corbelled brick pendentive to make up the phase of transition for the domes. At the northwest corner of the mosque there is a royal gallery forming an upper floor, which is still standing in a dilapidated condition. It was approached from the northwest corner of the mosque through a stepped platform connected with a doorway. The gallery has a mihrab in front.

Stone carving, brick-setting, terracotta, gilding and glazed tiles were used in decorating the building, and of them the former played the dominant role. The subject matters of the stone carving were chosen according to the demand of the spaces, e.g., the borders of the panels with creepers and their interior with various forms of stylised hanging patterns adapted from the chain-and-bell of the Bauddha and Jaina period. The spandrels of arches and the spaces above the frames are always dotted with rosettes, an attractive form of designs, but are all carved differently. The interior of the domes and vaults are decorated with terracottas, those of the vaults being copies of the bamboo frames of local huts. All the frontal archways and those of the ''mihrabs'' are cusped.

[[File:Side view of Sona Mosjid.jpg|thumb|Side view of Sona Mosjid]]
==Ornamentation==
The most important ornamentation of the mosque is to be seen on the frontal courtyard of the mosque, only recently excavated. The ornamentation consists of mosaic roundels in blue and white colours of variegated design. The mosaic design is not ''in situ'', but a roundel has been composed by the excavators, putting the flakes in their appropriate places and exhibiting it in a room attached to the guesthouse nearby. At a distance of 14.5 m to the east of the gateway there is a stone platform containing two tomb sarcophagi inscribed with verses from the Quran and some names of God. It is unknown who is buried here. Cunningham suggests these are the tombs of Wali Muhammad, the builder of the mosque, and his father Ali.

==Current situation==
The glamour of the Chhoto Sona Masjid is not there as it was originally, particularly because of the stripping of the decorative mihrabs and the mosque courtyard, but the remains are nevertheless one of the most attractive monuments of Guar-Lakhnauti.

'''Coffeemakers''' or '''coffee machines''' are cooking [[Small appliance|appliance]]s used to brew [[coffee]]. While there are many different types of coffeemakers using a number of different brewing principles, in the most common devices, coffee grounds are placed in a paper or metal filter inside a funnel, which is set over a glass or ceramic '''coffee pot''', a [[Cookware and bakeware|cooking pot]] in the [[kettle]] family. Cold water is poured into a separate chamber, which is then heated up to the boiling point, and directed into the funnel. This is also called ''[[drip brew|automatic drip-brew]]''.

== History ==
[[File:Coffeepot MET DP103144.jpg|thumb|''[[Coffeepot (François-Thomas Germain)|Coffeepot]]'', France, c. 1757, Metropolitan Museum of Art]]
[[File:DublinSterlingSilverHotWaterJug.jpg|thumb|upright|Silver hot water jug, Dublin c1770, using a coffee-pot shape with a higher base.]]
For hundreds of years, making a cup of coffee was a simple process.  Roasted and ground coffee beans were placed in a pot or pan, to which hot water was added, followed by attachment of a lid to commence the infusion process. Pots were designed specifically for brewing coffee, all with the purpose of trying to trap the coffee grounds before the coffee is poured. Typical designs feature a pot with a flat expanded bottom to catch sinking grounds and a sharp pour spout that traps the floating grinds. Other designs feature a wide bulge in the middle of the pot to catch grounds when coffee is poured.

In France, in about 1710, the Infusion brewing process was introduced. This involved submersing the ground coffee, usually enclosed in a linen bag, in hot water and letting it steep or "infuse" until the desired strength brew was achieved. Nevertheless, throughout the 19th and even the early 20th centuries, it was considered adequate to add ground coffee to hot water in a pot or pan, boil it until it smelled right, and pour the brew into a cup.

There were lots of innovations from France in the late 18th century. With help from [[Jean-Baptiste de Belloy]], the Archbishop of Paris, the idea that coffee should not be boiled gained acceptance. The first modern method for making coffee using a coffee filter—[[drip brew]]ing—is more than 125 years old, and its design had changed little. The ''biggin'', originating in France ca. 1780, was a two-level pot holding coffee in a cloth sock in an upper compartment into which water was poured, to drain through holes in the bottom of the compartment into the coffee pot below. Coffee was then dispensed from a spout on the side of the pot. The quality of the brewed coffee depended on the size of the grounds - too coarse and the coffee was weak; too fine and the water would not drip the filter. A major problem with this approach was that the taste of the cloth filter - whether cotton, burlap or an old sock - transferred to the taste of the coffee.  Around the same time, a French inventor developed the "[[Coffee percolator|pumping percolator]]", in which boiling water in a bottom chamber forces itself up a tube and then trickles (percolates) through the ground coffee back into the bottom chamber. Among other French innovations, [[Benjamin Thompson|Count Rumford]], an eccentric American scientist residing in Paris, developed a French Drip Pot with an insulating water jacket to keep the coffee hot. Also, the first metal filter was developed and patented by French inventor.[[File:EkspresKrot.jpg|thumb|Product of the Polish company Pol-Ekspres (1930s)]]

==Types==
[[File:Cafeti%C3%A8re_7.jpg|thumb|Coffee decant poured in a pitcher . French drip coffee pot]]
===Vacuum brewers===
{{main|Vacuum coffee maker}}
[[File:Coffee decant.jpeg|thumb|Coffee decant poured in a bowl]]
[[File:Vacpot3.jpg|thumb|upright|Vacuum coffee brewer; a Bodum vacuum brewer in which the coffee is drawn back by pressure differential.]]
Other coffee brewing devices became popular throughout the nineteenth century, including various machines using the [[vacuum]] principle. The Napier Vacuum Machine, invented in 1840, was an early example of this type. While generally too complex for everyday use, vacuum devices were prized for producing a clear brew, and were popular up until the middle of the twentieth century.

The principle of a vacuum brewer was to heat water in a lower vessel until expansion forced the contents through a narrow tube into an upper vessel containing ground coffee. When the lower vessel was empty and sufficient brewing time had elapsed, the heat was removed and the resulting vacuum would draw the brewed coffee back through a strainer into the lower chamber, from which it could be decanted. The [[Bauhaus]] interpretation of this device can be seen in [[Gerhard Marcks]]' [[Sintrax]] coffee maker of 1925.

An early variant technique, called a balance siphon, was to have the two chambers arranged side-by-side on a sort of [[Weighing scale|scale]]-like device, with a counterweight attached opposite the initial (or heating) chamber. Once the near-boiling water was forced from the heating chamber into the brewing one, the counterweight was activated, causing a spring-loaded [[snuffer]] to come down over the flame, thus turning "off" the heat, and allowing the cooled water to return to the original chamber. In this way, a sort of primitive 'automatic' brewing method was achieved.

On August 27, 1930, Inez H. Pierce of Chicago, Illinois filed patent for the first vacuum coffee maker that truly automated the vacuum brewing process, while eliminating the need for a stove top burner or liquid fuels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baharris.org/coffee/Patents/1994323.gif |title=Patent drawing |date= |accessdate=2013-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; An electrically heated stove was incorporated into the design of the vacuum brewer. Water was heated in a recessed well, which reduced wait times and forced the hottest water into the reaction chamber. Once the process was complete, a thermostat using bi-metallic expansion principles shut off heat to the unit at the appropriate time.  Pierce's invention was the first truly "automatic" vacuum coffee brewer, and was later incorporated in the [[Farberware]] ''Coffee Robot''.

Pierce's design was later improved by U.S. appliance engineers [[Ivar Jepson]], [[Ludvik Koci]], and Eric Bylund of [[Sunbeam Products|Sunbeam]] in the late 1930s. They altered the heating chamber and eliminated the recessed well which was hard to clean. They also made several improvements to the filtering mechanism. Their improved design of plated metals, styled by industrial designer [[Alfonso Iannelli]], became the famous Sunbeam ''Coffeemaster'' line of automated vacuum coffee makers (Models C-20, C-30, C40, and C-50). The Coffeemaster vacuum brewer was sold in large numbers in the United States during the years immediately following [[World War I]].

=== Percolators ===
{{main|Coffee percolator}}
[[File:Perkulator.jpg|upright|thumb|right|Electric percolator]]

Percolators began to be developed from the mid-nineteenth century.  In the United States, James H. Mason of Massachusetts patented an early percolator design in 1865.  An Illinois farmer named Hanson Goodrich is generally credited with patenting the modern percolator.   Goodrich's patent was granted on August 16, 1889, and his patent description varies little from the stovetop percolators sold today.  With the percolator design, water is heated in a boiling pot with a removable lid, until the heated water is forced through a metal tube into a brew basket containing coffee.  The extracted liquid drains from the brew basket, where it drips back into the pot.  This process is continually repeated during the brewing cycle until the liquid passing repeatedly through the grounds is sufficiently steeped.  A clear sight chamber in the form of a transparent knob on the lid of the percolator enables the user to judge when the coffee has reached the proper color and strength.

Domestic [[electrification]] simplified the operation of percolators by providing for a self-contained, electrically powered heating element that removed the need to use a stovetop burner.  A critical element in the success of the electric coffee maker was the creation of safe and secure fuses and heating elements. In an article in House Furnishing Review, May 1915, Lewis Stephenson of Landers, Frary and Clark described a modular safety plug being used in his company's Universal appliances, and the advent of numerous patents and innovations in temperature control and circuit breakers provided for the success of many new percolator and vacuum models.  While early percolators had utilized all-glass construction (prized for maintaining purity of flavor), most percolators made from the 1930s were constructed of metal, especially aluminum and nickel-plated copper.

The method for making coffee in a percolator had barely changed since its introduction in the early part of the 20th century. However, in 1970 [[General Foods]] Corporation introduced Max Pax, the first commercially available "ground coffee filter rings". The Max Pax filters were named so as to compliment General Foods' Maxwell House coffee brand. The Max Pax coffee filter rings were designed for use in percolators, and each ring contained a pre-measured amount of coffee grounds that were sealed in a self-contained paper filter. The sealed rings resembled the shape of a doughnut, and the small hole in the middle of the ring enabled the coffee filter ring to be placed in the metal percolator basket around the protruding convection (percolator) tube. 
 
Prior to the introduction of pre-measured self-contained ground coffee filter rings, fresh coffee grounds were measured out in scoopfuls and placed into the metal percolator basket. This process enabled small amounts of coffee grounds to leak into the fresh coffee. Additionally, the process left wet grounds in the percolator basket, which were very tedious to clean. The benefit of the Max Pax coffee filter rings was two-fold: First, because the amount of coffee contained in the rings was pre-measured, it negated the need to measure each scoop and then place it in the metal percolator basket. Second, the filter paper was strong enough to hold all the coffee grounds within the sealed paper. After use, the coffee filter ring could be easily removed from the basket and discarded. This saved the consumer from the tedious task of cleaning out the remaining wet coffee grounds from the percolator basket.

With the introduction of the [[#Electric drip coffeemakers|electric drip coffee maker]] for the home in the early 1970s, the popularity of percolators plummeted, and so did the market for the self-contained ground coffee filters. In 1976, General Foods discontinued the manufacture of Max Pax, and by the end of the decade, even generic ground coffee filter rings were no longer available on U.S. supermarket shelves.

===Moka pot===
{{main|Moka pot}}

The moka pot is a stove-top coffee maker which produces coffee by passing hot water pressurized by steam through ground coffee. It was first patented by inventor Luigi De Ponti for Alfonso Bialetti in 1933. Bialetti Industrie continues to produce the same model under the name "Moka Express".
 
The moka pot is most commonly used in Europe and in Latin America. It has become an iconic design, displayed in modern industrial art and design museums such as the Wolfsonian- FIU, Museum of Modern Art, the Cooper–Hewitt, National Design Museum, the Design Museum, and the London Science Museum. Moka pots come in different sizes, from one to eighteen 50 ml cups. The original design and many current models are made from aluminium with bakelite handles.

An electric drip coffee maker can also be referred to as a dripolator. It normally works by admitting water from a cold water reservoir into a flexible hose in the base of the reservoir leading directly to a thin metal tube or heating chamber (usually, of aluminum), where a heating element surrounding the metal tube heats the water.  The heated water moves through the machine using the ''[[thermosiphon]] principle''.  Thermally-induced pressure and the siphoning effect move the heated water through an insulated rubber or vinyl riser hose, into a spray head, and onto the ground coffee, which is contained in a brew basket mounted below the spray head.  The coffee passes through a filter and drips down into the carafe.  A one-way valve in the tubing prevents water from siphoning back into the reservoir.  A thermostat attached to the heating element turns off the heating element as needed to prevent overheating the water in the metal tube (overheating would produce only steam in the supply hose), then turns back on when the water cools below a certain threshold.  For a standard 10-12 cup drip coffeemaker, using a more powerful thermostatically-controlled heating element (in terms of wattage produced), can heat increased amounts of water more quickly using larger heating chambers, generally producing higher average water temperatures at the spray head over the entire brewing cycle.  This process can be further improved by changing the aluminum construction of most heating chambers to a metal with superior heat transfer qualities, such as copper.

Throughout the latter part of the 20th century, a number of inventors patented various coffeemaker designs using an automated form of the drip brew method. Subsequent designs have featured changes in heating elements, spray head, and brew-basket design, as well as the addition of timers and clocks for automatic-start, water filtration, filter and carafe design, and even built-in coffee grinding mechanisms.

===Pourover, water displacement drip coffeemakers===
[[Bunn-O-Matic]] came out with a different drip-brew machine.  In this type of coffeemaker, the machine uses a holding tank or boiler pre-filled with water.  When the machine is turned on, all of the water in the holding tank is brought to near boiling point (approximately 200{{ndash}}207&amp;nbsp;°F or 93{{ndash}}97&amp;nbsp;°C) using a thermostatically-controlled heating element.  When water is poured into a top-mounted tray, it descends into a funnel and tube which delivers the cold water to the bottom of the boiler.  The less-dense hot water in the boiler is displaced out of the tank and into a tube leading to the spray head, where it drips into a brew basket containing the ground coffee. The pourover, water displacement method of coffeemaking tends to produce brewed coffee at a much faster rate than standard drip designs.  Its primary disadvantage is increased electricity consumption in order to preheat the water in the boiler.  Additionally, the water displacement method is most efficient when used to brew coffee at the machine's maximum or near-maximum capacity, as typically found in restaurant or office usage. In 1963, Bunn introduced the first automatic coffee brewer, which connected to a waterline for an automatic water feed.

=== Cafetiere ===
[[File:French press.jpg|upright|thumb|A cafetiere coffeemaker]]A [[cafetiere]] (Coffee Plunger, French press in US English) requires coffee of a coarser grind than does a drip brew [[coffee filter]], as finer grounds will seep through the press filter and into the coffee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09113/964681-51.stm|title=Manual brewing techniques give coffee lovers a better way to make a quality drink|website=www.post-gazette.com|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee is brewed by placing the coffee and water together, stirring it and leaving to brew for a few minutes, then pressing the plunger to trap the coffee grounds at the bottom of the beaker.

Because the coffee grounds remain in direct contact with the brewing water and the grounds are filtered from the water via a mesh instead of a paper filter, coffee brewed with the cafetiere captures more of the coffee's flavour and [[essential oil]]s, which would become trapped in a traditional drip brew machine's paper filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coffeeresearch.org/coffee/brewing.htm|title=Coffee Brewing - CoffeeResearch.org|website=www.coffeeresearch.org|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with drip-brewed coffee, cafetiere coffee can be brewed to any strength by adjusting the amount of ground coffee which is brewed. If the used grounds remain in the drink after brewing, French pressed coffee left to stand can become "bitter", though this is an effect that many users of cafetiere consider beneficial. For a {{convert|1/2|l|adj=on}} cafetiere, the contents are considered spoiled, by some reports, after around 20 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = John Wiley and Sons| isbn = 978-0-470-00955-0| last = Rinsky| first = Laura Halpin| title = The Pastry Chef's Companion| page = 119 | year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other approaches consider a brew period that may extend to hours as a method of superior production.

=== Espresso machine ===

=== Single-serve coffeemaker ===
The single-serve or single-cup coffeemaker has gained popularity in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2012/11/28/the-k-cup-patent-is-dead-long-live-the-k-cup/|title=The K-Cup Patent Is Dead, Long Live The K-Cup|last=Gara|first=Tom|date=2012-11-28|website=WSJ|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Single-serve brewing systems let a certain amount of water heated at a precise temperature go through a coffee portion pack (or [[coffee pod]]), brewing a standardized cup of coffee into a recipient placed under the beverage outlet. 
A coffee portion pack has an air-tight seal to ensure product freshness. It contains a determined quantity of ground coffee and usually encloses an internal [[filter paper]] for optimal brewing results. 
The single-serve coffeemaker technology often allows the choice of cup size and brew strength, and delivers a cup of brewed coffee rapidly, usually at the touch of a button. Today, a variety of beverages are available for brewing with single-cup machines such as tea, hot chocolate and milk-based specialty beverages.
Single-cup coffee machines are designed for both home and commercial use.

==Design considerations in coffeemakers==
[[File:Atomic coffee maker.jpg|thumb|left|[[Atomic Coffee Machine|Atomic brand coffee maker]]]]
[[File:Moka2.jpg|thumb|[[Moka pot]] coffee pot]]

At the beginning of the twentieth century, although some coffee makers tended to uniformity of design (particularly stovetop percolators), others displayed a wide variety of styling differences.  In particular, the vacuum brewer, which required two fully separate chambers joined in an hourglass configuration, seemed to inspire industrial designers.  Interest in new designs for the vacuum brewer revived during the [[American Craftsman|American Arts &amp; Crafts]] movement with the introduction of "Silex" brand coffee makers, based on models developed by Massachusetts housewives Ann Bridges and Mrs. Sutton. Their use of [[Pyrex]] solved the problem of fragility and breakability that had made this type of machine commercially unattractive.  During the 1930s, simple, clean forms, increasingly of metal, attracted positive attention from industrial designers heavily influenced by the functionalist imperative of the [[Bauhaus]] and [[Streamline Moderne|Streamline]] movements.  It was at this time that Sunbeam's sleek Coffeemaster vacuum brewer appeared, styled by the famous industrial designer [[Alfonso Iannelli]].  The popularity of glass and Pyrex globes temporarily revived during the [[World War II|Second World War]], since aluminum, chrome, and other metals used in traditional coffee makers became restricted in availability.

The impact of science and technological advances as a motif in post-war design was eventually felt in the manufacture and marketing of coffee and coffee-makers. Consumer guides emphasized the ability of the device to meet standards of temperature and brewing time, and the ratio of soluble elements between brew and grounds.  The industrial chemist [[Peter Schlumbohm]] expressed the scientific motif most purely in his "Chemex" coffeemaker, which from its initial marketing in the early 1940s used the authority of science as a sales tool, describing the product as "the Chemist's way of making coffee", and discussing at length the quality of its product in the language of the laboratory: "the funnel of the CHEMEX creates ideal hydrostatic conditions for the unique... Chemex extraction."  Schlumbohm's unique brewer, a single Pyrex vessel shaped to hold a proprietary filter cone, resembled nothing more than a piece of [[laboratory equipment]], and surprisingly became popular for a time in the otherwise heavily automated, technology-obsessed 1950s household.

In later years, coffeemakers began to adopt more standardized forms commensurate with a large increase in the scale of production required to meet postwar consumer demand.  Plastics and composite materials began to replace metal, particularly with the advent of newer electric drip coffeemakers in the 1970s.  During the 1990s, consumer demand for more attractive appliances to complement expensive modern kitchens resulted in a new wave of redesigned coffeemakers in a wider range of available colors and styles.

==Unusual designs==
Several models of [[propane]] gas powered coffee machines are also available.

[[Image:Cryingtheneck2008.JPG|thumb|300px|'Crying The Neck' at [[St Columb Major]] (2008).]]
'''Crying The Neck''' is a [[harvest festival]] tradition once common in counties of [[Devon]] and [[Cornwall]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in [[Europe]]. The tradition declined following the invention of machines such as the [[combine harvester]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}

The tradition is no longer known to be practiced in Devon. In Cornwall, however, the tradition was revived in the early twentieth century by the [[Old Cornwall Society]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==Ceremony==
In ''The Story of Cornwall'', by [[Kenneth Hamilton Jenkin]], the following explanation is given on the practice:

:"In those days the whole of the reaping had to be done either with the hook or [[scythe]]. The harvest, in consequence, often lasted for many weeks. When the time came to cut the last handful of standing corn, one of the reapers would lift up the bunch high above his head and call out in a loud voice....., 

:"I 'ave 'un! I 'ave 'un! I 'ave 'un!"

The rest would then shout, 

:"What 'ave 'ee? What 'ave 'ee? What 'ave 'ee?"

and the reply would be: 

:"A neck! A neck! A neck!"

Everyone then joined in shouting:

:"Hurrah! Hurrah for the neck! Hurrah for Mr. So-and-So" 
(calling the farmer by name.)"

==Modern popular culture==
In a harvest scene in the third episode of the second series of the 2015 of ''[[Poldark (2015 TV series)|Poldark]]'' (S02 E03), Francis Poldark performs the tradition at Trenwith, his estate.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

In a harvest scene in the third episode of supernatural drama ''[[The Living and the Dead (TV series)|The Living and the Dead]]'' (S01 E03), Charlotte Appleby performs the tradition at her husband's family farm, which she manages.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

==History==
The company was founded illegally in 1943, during the [[History of the Netherlands (1939-1945)#German occupation|German occupation of the Netherlands]] by {{Interlanguage link multi|Geert Lubberhuizen|nl}}; its first publication was a poem by [[Jan Campert]] called ''De Achttien Dooden'' ("The eighteen dead"), which describes the execution of 15 resistance fighters and three communists. The poem was sold to raise money for Jewish children who were placed with Dutch families; when it was published, in the spring of 1943, Campert had already died in the [[Neuengamme concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="hubben"/&gt; When the German occupier rounded up students for the [[Arbeitseinsatz]], Lubberhuizen hid in the attic of Maarten Vink, a surgeon, and ran the press from there.&lt;ref name="roegholt"&gt;{{cite web |last=Roegholt |first=Richter |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hoe De Bezige Bij ontstond als illegale uitgeverij |work= |publisher=De Bezige Bij |date= |url=http://www.debezigebij.nl/boekboek/show/id=33841 |format= |doi= |accessdate=2009-07-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517030209/http://www.debezigebij.nl/boekboek/show/id%3D33841 |archivedate=May 17, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name is derived from one of Lubberhuizen's aliases, "Bas." After he had signed a note, "Bas (busy)," an English-speaking friend joked, "Bas, busy as a bee can be," which led to the current name.&lt;ref name="roegholt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 2004, the company published an illustrated history of its activities during the war years; see {{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2506">A '''discount card''' is a card or document, often a plastic [[credit card]] or paper card, that entitles the holder to [[Discounts and allowances|discount]]s on the prices of some products or services. Cards may be issued as part of a [[loyalty program]], offering discounts to existing customers to ensure their continuing custom; they may be offered free of charge, offering a modest discount with the intention of persuading purchasers to patronise participating shops; or they may be sold to members, offering larger discounts—for example, the [[tastecard]] offers 50% discounts at many [[restaurant]]s—at a substantial annual cost. Cards may be offered by merchants or groups of merchants, by clubs or associations who negotiate on behalf of all members to obtain benefits, or by official organisations offering concessionary prices to qualifying groups, such as the disabled.

==Types==
* [[Loyalty program|Loyalty cards]]

'''English Renaissance theatre'''—also known as '''Renaissance English theatre''' and '''Elizabethan theatre'''—refers to the theatre of [[England]] between 1562 and 1642.

This is the style of the plays of [[William Shakespeare]], [[Christopher Marlowe]] and [[Ben Jonson]].

==Background==
The term ''English Renaissance theatre'' encompasses the period between 1562—following a performance of [[Gorboduc (play)|''Gorboduc'']], the first English play using [[blank verse]], at the [[Inner Temple]] during the Christmas season of 1561—and the ban on theatrical plays enacted by the English Parliament in 1642.

The phrase ''Elizabethan theatre'' is sometimes used, improperly, to mean ''English Renaissance theatre,'' although in a strict sense "Elizabethan" only refers to the period of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth's]] reign (1558–1603). ''English Renaissance theatre'' may be said to encompass ''Elizabethan theatre'' from 1562 to 1603, ''[[James VI and I|Jacobean]] theatre'' from 1603 to 1625, and ''[[Charles I of England|Caroline]] theatre'' from 1625 to 1642.

Along with the economics of the profession, the character of the drama changed towards the end of the period. Under [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]], the drama was a unified expression as far as social class was concerned: the Court watched the same plays the commoners saw in the public playhouses. With the development of the private theatres, drama became more oriented towards the tastes and values of an upper-class audience. By the later part of the reign of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]], few new plays were being written for the public theatres, which sustained themselves on the accumulated works of the previous decades.{{sfn|Gurr|2009|pp=12–18}}

==Sites of dramatic performance==

===Grammar schools===
The English [[grammar school|grammar schools]], like those on the continent, placed special emphasis on the ''[[trivium]]'': grammar, logic, and [[rhetoric]]. Though rhetorical instruction was intended as preparation for careers in civil service such as law, the rhetorical canons of memory (''[[memoria]]'') and delivery (''[[pronuntiatio]]''), gesture and voice, as well as exercises from the ''[[progymnasmata]]'', such as the ''[[prosopopoeia]]'', taught theatrical skills.{{sfn|Christiansen|1997}}{{sfn|Astington|2010|p=45}} Students would typically analyze Latin and Greek texts, write their own compositions, memorize them, and then perform them in front of their instructor and their peers.{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=298}} Records show that in addition to this weekly performance, students would perform plays on holidays,{{sfn|Astington|2010|p=42}} and in both Latin and English.{{sfn|Astington|2010|p=43}}

[[File:Nathan Field.JPG|thumb|Nathan Field, who began his acting career as a [[boy player]]]]

===Choir schools===
Choir schools connected with the Elizabethan court included [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle|St. George’s Chapel]], the Chapel Royal, and [[Old St Paul's Cathedral|St. Paul’s]].{{sfn|Astington|2010|p=49}} These schools never performed plays and other court entertainments for the Queen.{{sfn|Astington|2010|pp=48–50}} Between the 1560s and 1570s these schools had begun to perform for general audiences as well.{{sfn|Astington|2010|p=51}} Playing companies of boy actors were derived from choir schools.{{sfn|Gurr|2009|p=45}} An earlier example of a playwright contracted to write for the children's companies is [[John Lyly]], who wrote ''[[Gallathea]]'', ''[[Endymion (play)|Endymion]]'', and ''[[Midas (Lyly play)|Midas]]'' for Paul’s Boys.{{sfn|Astington|2010|p=54}} Another example is [[Ben Jonson]], who wrote ''[[Cynthia’s Revels]]''.{{sfn|Gurr|2009|pp=67–68}}

===Universities===
{{main|Academic drama}}
[[Academic drama]] stems from [[late medieval]] and [[early modern]] practices of miracles and morality plays as well as the [[Feast of Fools]] and the election of a [[Lord of Misrule]].{{sfn|Boas|1914|p=346}} The Feast of Fools includes [[Mummers play|mummer plays]].{{sfn|Boas|1914|p=8}} The universities, particularly [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], were attended by students studying for bachelor's degrees and master's degrees, followed by doctorates in Law, Medicine, and Theology.{{sfn|Boas|1914|p=13}} In the 1400s, dramas were often restricted to [[Mummers play|mummer plays]] with someone who read out all the parts in Latin.{{sfn|Boas|1914|pp=14–15}} With the rediscovery and redistribution of classical materials during the [[English Renaissance]], Latin and Greek plays began to be restaged.{{sfn|Boas|1914|pp=14–18}} These plays were often accompanied by feasts.{{sfn|Boas|1914|p=25}} Queen Elizabeth I viewed dramas during her visits to Oxford and Cambridge.{{sfn|Boas|1914|pp=89–108, 252–285}} A well-known play cycle which was written and performed in the universities was the ''[[Parnassus Plays]]''.{{sfn|Boas|1914|p=346}}

===Inns of Court===
[[File:Gorboduc TP 1565.jpg|thumb|Gorboduc TP 1565]]
Upon graduation, many university students, especially those going into law, would reside and participate in the [[Inns of Court]]. The Inns of Court were communities of working lawyers and university alumni.{{sfn|Astington|2010|p=69}} Notable literary figures and playwrights who resided in the Inns of Court include [[John Donne]], [[Francis Beaumont]], [[John Marston (poet)|John Marston]], [[Thomas Lodge]], [[Thomas Campion]], [[Abraham Fraunce]], [[Sir Philip Sidney]], [[Sir Thomas More]], [[Sir Francis Bacon]], and [[George Gascoigne]].{{sfn|Astington|2010|pp=69–71}}{{sfn|Cunningham|2007|p=200}} Like the university, the Inns of Court elected their own [[Lord of Misrule]].{{sfn|Astington|2010|p=70}} Other activities included participation in [[moot court]], [[disputations|disputation]], and [[masques]].{{sfn|Astington|2010|p=70}}{{sfn|Cunningham|2007|p=200}} Plays written and performed in the Inns of Court include ''[[Gorboduc]]'', ''[[Gismund of Salerne]]'', and ''[[The Misfortunes of Arthur]]''.{{sfn|Cunningham|2007|p=200}} An example of a famous [[masque]] put on by the Inns was [[James Shirley]]’s ''[[The Triumph of Peace]]''. [[Shakespeare]]’s ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' and ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' were also performed here, although written for commercial theater.{{sfn|Astington|2010|p=74}}

==Establishment of playhouses==
The first permanent English theatre, the [[Red Lion (theatre)|Red Lion]], opened in 1567{{sfn|Bryson|2008|p=28}} but it was a short-lived failure. The first successful theatres, such as [[The Theatre]], opened in 1576.

The establishment of large and profitable public theatres was an essential enabling factor in the success of English Renaissance drama. Once they were in operation, drama could become a fixed and permanent, rather than transitory, phenomenon. Their construction was prompted when the [[Lord Mayor of London|Mayor]] and [[City of London Corporation|Corporation of London]] first banned plays in 1572 as a measure against the plague, and then formally expelled all players from the city in 1575.{{sfn|Ordish|1899|p=30}} This prompted the construction of permanent playhouses outside the jurisdiction of London, in the [[Liberty (division)|liberties]] of Halliwell/Holywell in Shoreditch and later [[Liberty of the Clink|the Clink]], and at [[Newington Butts]] near the established entertainment district of St. George's Fields in rural Surrey.{{sfn|Ordish|1899|p=30}} [[The Theatre]] was constructed in [[Shoreditch]] in 1576 by [[James Burbage]] with his brother-in-law [[John Brayne]] (the owner of the unsuccessful [[Red Lion (theatre)|Red Lion]] playhouse of 1567){{sfn|Bowsher|Miller|2010|p=19}} and the [[Newington Butts]] playhouse was set up, probably by Jerome Savage, some time between 1575{{sfn|Wickham|Berry|Ingram|2000|p=320}} and 1577.{{sfn|Ingram|1992|p=170}} The Theatre was rapidly followed by the nearby [[Curtain Theatre]] (1577), the [[the Rose (theatre)|Rose]] (1587), the [[the Swan (theatre)|Swan]] (1595), the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]] (1599), the [[Fortune Playhouse|Fortune]] (1600), and the [[Red Bull Theatre|Red Bull]] (1604).{{efn|A complete roster of what the Elizabethans called "public" theatres would include the [[Boar's Head Inn, Whitechapel|Boar's Head Inn]] (1598), and the [[Hope Theatre]] (1613), neither of them major venues for drama in the era.}}

==Playhouse architecture==
{{wide image|The Globe Theatre, Panorama Innenraum, London.jpg|600px|The Globe Theatre, Panorama Innenraum, London|50%|right}}
Archaeological excavations on the foundations of the Rose and the Globe in the late 20th century showed that all the London theatres had individual differences, but their common function necessitated a similar general plan.{{sfn|Gurr|2009|pp=123–131, 142–146}} The public theatres were three stories high, and built around an open space at the centre. Usually polygonal in plan to give an overall rounded effect, although the Red Bull and the first Fortune were square. The three levels of inward-facing galleries overlooked the open centre, into which jutted the stage: essentially a platform surrounded on three sides by the audience. The rear side was restricted for the entrances and exits of the actors and seating for the musicians. The upper level behind the stage could be used as a [[balcony]], as in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', or as a position from which an actor could harangue a crowd, as in ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''.{{sfn|Ichikawa|2012|pp=1–12}}

The playhouses were generally built with timber and plaster. Individual theatre descriptions give additional information about their construction, such as flint stones being used to build the Swan. Theatres were also constructed to be able to hold a large number of people.{{sfn|Hattaway|2008|page=40}}

A different model was developed with the [[Blackfriars Theatre]], which came into regular use on a long-term basis in 1599.{{efn|The Blackfriars site was used as a theatre in the 1576-84 period; but it became a regular venue for drama only later.}} The Blackfriars was small in comparison to the earlier theatres and roofed rather than open to the sky. It resembled a modern theatre in ways that its predecessors did not. Other small enclosed theatres followed, notably the [[Whitefriars Theatre|Whitefriars]] (1608) and the [[Cockpit Theatre|Cockpit]] (1617). With the building of the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]] in 1629 near the site of the defunct Whitefriars, the London audience had six theatres to choose from: three surviving large open-air public theatres—the Globe, the Fortune, and the Red Bull—and three smaller enclosed private theatres: the Blackfriars, the Cockpit, and the Salisbury Court.{{efn|Other "private" theaters of the era included the theatre near [[St Paul's Cathedral]] used by the [[Children of Paul's]] (1575) and the occasionally used [[Cockpit-in-Court]] (1629).}} Audiences of the 1630s benefited from a half-century of vigorous [[dramaturgy|dramaturgical]] development; the plays of [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]] and [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and their contemporaries were still being performed on a regular basis, mostly at the public theatres, while the newest works of the newest playwrights were abundant as well, mainly at the private theatres.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

==Audiences==
Around 1580, when both the Theatre and the Curtain were full on summer days, the total theatre capacity of London was about 5000 spectators. With the building of new theatre facilities and the formation of new companies, London's total theatre capacity exceeded 10,000 after 1610.{{sfn|Cook|2014|pp=176–178}}

Ticket prices in general varied during this time period. The cost of admission was based on where in the theatre a person wished to be situated, or based on what a person could afford. If people wanted a better view of the stage or to be more separate from the crowd, they would pay more for their entrance. Due to inflation that occurred during this time period, admission increased in some theatres from a penny to a sixpence or even higher.{{sfn|MacIntyre|1992|p=322}}

Commercial theaters were largely located just outside the boundaries of the [[City of London]], since City authorities tended to be wary of the adult playing companies, but plays were performed by touring companies all over England.{{sfn|Keenan|2002}} English companies even toured and performed English plays abroad, especially in [[Germany]] and in [[Denmark]].{{sfn|Dawson|2002|pp=174–193}}{{efn|For example, ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' was performed in [[Nördlingen]] in 1604.{{sfn|Dawson|2002|p=176}}}}

==Performances==
The acting companies functioned on a [[Repertory theatre|repertory]] system: unlike modern productions that can run for months or years on end, the troupes of this era rarely acted the same play two days in a row. [[Thomas Middleton]]'s ''[[A Game at Chess]]'' ran for nine straight performances in August 1624 before it was closed by the authorities; but this was due to the political content of the play and was a unique, unprecedented, and unrepeatable phenomenon. The 1592 season of [[Lord Strange's Men]] at the [[The Rose (theatre)|Rose Theatre]] was far more representative: between 19 February and 23 June the company played six days a week, minus Good Friday and two other days. They performed 23 different plays, some only once, and their most popular play of the season, ''The First Part of Hieronimo'', based on Kyd's ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]'', 15 times. They never played the same play two days in a row, and rarely the same play twice in a week.{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=374}}{{efn|[[Edmund Kerchever Chambers|E.K. Chambers']] ''The Elizabethan Stage'' (1923), reflects an earlier interpretation of the identity of the ''Hieronimo'' play.{{sfn|Chambers|1923|p=396}}}} The workload on the actors, especially the leading performers like [[Richard Burbage]] or [[Edward Alleyn]], must have been tremendous.

One distinctive feature of the companies was that they included only males. Female parts were played by adolescent [[boy players]] in women's costume. Some companies were composed entirely of boy players.{{efn|For example the [[King's Revels Children]], [[Children of Paul's]], and the [[Children of the Chapel#The troupes of child actors|Children of the Chapel]]. Shakespeare even alludes to such companies, with a certain amount of scorn, in ''Hamlet'' Act 2, Scene 2.{{sfd|Hamlet|2|2|337–391}}}} Performances in the public theatres (like the Globe) took place in the afternoon with no artificial lighting, but when, in the course of a play, the light began to fade, candles were lit.{{sfn|Bellinger|1927|pp=207–213}} In the enclosed private theatres (like the Blackfriars) artificial lighting was used throughout. Plays contained little to no scenery as the scenery was described by the actors or indicated by costume through the course of the play.{{sfn|Ichikawa|2012|p=100}}

In the Elizabethan era, research has been conclusive about how many actors and troupes there were in the 16th century, but little research delves into the roles of the actors on the English renaissance stage. The first point is that during the Elizabethan era, women were not allowed to act on stage. The actors were all male; in fact, most were boys. For plays written that had male and female parts, the female parts were played by the youngest boy players.{{sfn|Maclennan|1994}}

In Elizabethan entertainment, troupes were created and they were considered the actor companies. They traveled around England as drama was the most entertaining art at the time. As a boy player, many skills had to be implemented such as voice and athleticism (fencing was one).{{sfn|Maclennan|1994}} Stronger female roles in tragedies were acted by older boy players because they had the experience.{{sfn|Maclennan|1994}}

&lt;!-- FIXME: This paragraph verges on incoherence. It needs a complete rewrite (TNT). --Xover, 2 March 2018 --&gt;
Elizabethan actors never played the same show on successive days and added a new play to their repertoire every other week. These actors were getting paid within these troupes so for their job, they would constantly learn new plays as they toured different cities in England. In these plays, there were bookkeepers that acted as the narrators of these plays and they would introduce the actors and the different roles they played. At some points, the bookkeeper wouldn’t state the narrative of the scene, so the audience could find out for themselves. In Elizabethan and Jacobean plays, the plays often exceeded the number of characters/roles and didn’t have enough actors to fulfill them, thus the idea of doubling roles came to be.{{sfn|Calore|2003}} Doubling roles is used to reinforce a plays theme by having the actor act out the different roles simultaneously.{{sfn|Kregor|1993}} The reason for this was for the acting companies to control salary costs, or to be able to perform under conditions where resources such as other actor companies lending actors were not present.{{sfn|Kregor|1993}}

&lt;!-- FIXME: Is this actually connected to the rest of the section, or is it just a general observation? --Xover, 2 March 2018 --&gt;
There are two acting styles implemented. Formal and natural. Formal acting is objective and traditional, natural acting attempts to create an illusion for the audience by remaining in character and imitating the fictional circumstances. The formal actor symbolizes while the natural actor interprets. The natural actor impersonates while the formal actor represents the role. Natural and formal are opposites of each other, where natural acting is subjective. Overall, the use of these acting styles and the doubled roles dramatic device made Elizabethan plays very popular.{{sfn|Triesault|1970}}

==Costumes==
[[File:Elizabethan-Actors-Actors.gif|thumb|right|Costumes of the Elizabethan Era]]
One of the main uses of costume during the Elizabethan era was to make up for the lack of scenery, set, and props on stage. It created a visual effect for the audience, and it was an integral part of the overall performance.{{sfn|MacIntyre|1992}} Since the main visual appeal on stage were the costumes, they were often bright in colour and visually entrancing. Colours symbolized social hierarchy, and costumes were made to reflect that. For example, if a character was royalty, their costume would include purple. The colours, as well as the different fabrics of the costumes, allowed the audience to know the status of each character when they first appeared on stage.{{sfn|Keenan|2014|pp=109–110}}

Costumes were collected in inventory. More often than not, costumes wouldn't be made individually to fit the actor. Instead, they would be selected out of the stock that theatre companies would keep. A theatre company reused costumes when possible and would rarely get new costumes made. Costumes themselves were expensive, so usually players wore contemporary clothing regardless of the time period of the play. The most expensive pieces were given to higher class characters because costuming was used to identify social status on stage. The fabrics within a playhouse would indicate the wealth of the company itself. The fabrics used the most were: velvet, satin, silk, cloth-of-gold, lace, and ermine.{{sfn|Mann|1991}} For less significant characters; actors would use their own clothes.&lt;!-- FIXME: A proper explanation of Sumptuary laws and how they relate to Elizabethan theatre should go here. --Xover, 2 March 2018 --&gt;

Actors also left clothes in their will for following actors to use. Masters would also leave clothes for servants in their will, but servants weren’t allowed to wear fancy clothing, instead, they sold the clothes back to theatre companies.{{sfn|Keenan|2014|pp=109–110}} In the Elizabethan era, there was a law stating that certain classes could only wear clothing fitting of their status in society. There was a discrimination of status within the classes. Higher classes flaunted their wealth and power through the appearance of clothing, however, actors were the only exception. If actors belonged to a licensed acting company, they were allowed to dress above their standing in society for specific roles in a production.{{sfn|Montrose|1996|pp=35–37}}

==Playwrights==
The growing population of London, the growing wealth of its people, and their fondness for spectacle produced a dramatic literature of remarkable variety, quality, and extent. Although most of the plays written for the Elizabethan stage have been lost, over 600 remain.

The people who wrote these plays were primarily self-made men from modest backgrounds.{{efn|A few aristocratic women engaged in closet drama or dramatic translations. Chambers lists [[Elizabeth Tanfield Cary|Elizabeth, Lady Cary]]; [[Mary Sidney|Mary Herbert, Countess of Pembroke]]; [[Jane Lumley|Jane, Lady Lumley]]; and [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth Tudor]].{{sfn|Chambers|1923}}}} Some of them were educated at either [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] or [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]], but many were not.  Although [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson]] were actors, the majority do not seem to have been performers, and no major author who came on to the scene after 1600 is known to have supplemented his income by acting. Their lives were subject to the same levels of danger and earlier mortality as all who lived during the early modern period: [[Christopher Marlowe]] was killed in an apparent tavern brawl, while [[Ben Jonson]] killed an actor in a duel. Several were probably soldiers.

Playwrights were normally paid in increments during the writing process, and if their play was accepted, they would also receive the proceeds from one day's performance. However, they had no ownership of the plays they wrote. Once a play was sold to a company, the company owned it, and the playwright had no control over casting, performance, revision, or publication.

The profession of dramatist was challenging and far from lucrative.{{sfn|Halliday|1964|pp=374–375}} Entries in [[Philip Henslowe]]'s Diary show that in the years around 1600 Henslowe paid as little as £6 or £7 per play. This was probably at the low end of the range, though even the best writers could not demand too much more. A playwright, working alone, could generally produce two plays a year at most. In the 1630s [[Richard Brome]] signed a contract with the [[Salisbury Court Theatre]] to supply three plays a year, but found himself unable to meet the workload. Shakespeare produced fewer than 40 solo plays in a career that spanned more than two decades: he was financially successful because he was an actor and, most importantly, a shareholder in the company for which he acted and in the theatres they used. Ben Jonson achieved success as a purveyor of Court [[masque]]s, and was talented at playing the [[patronage]] game that was an important part of the social and economic life of the era. Those who were purely playwrights fared far less well: the biographies of early figures like [[George Peele]] and [[Robert Greene (16th century)|Robert Greene]], and later ones like Brome and [[Philip Massinger]], are marked by financial uncertainty, struggle, and poverty.

Playwrights dealt with the natural limitation on their productivity by combining into teams of two, three, four, and even five to generate play texts. The majority of plays written in this era were collaborations, and the solo artists who generally eschewed collaborative efforts, like Jonson and Shakespeare, were the exceptions to the rule. Dividing the work, of course, meant dividing the income; but the arrangement seems to have functioned well enough to have made it worthwhile. Of the 70-plus known works in the canon of [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]], roughly 50 are collaborations. In a single year (1598) Dekker worked on 16 collaborations for impresario [[Philip Henslowe]], and earned £30, or a little under 12 shillings per week—roughly twice as much as the average artisan's income of 1''s''. per day.{{sfn|Gurr|2009|p=72}} At the end of his career, [[Thomas Heywood]] would famously claim to have had "an entire hand, or at least a main finger" in the authorship of some 220 plays. A solo artist usually needed months to write a play (though Jonson is said to have done ''[[Volpone]]'' in five weeks); Henslowe's Diary indicates that a team of four or five writers could produce a play in as little as two weeks. Admittedly, though, the Diary also shows that teams of Henslowe's house dramatists—[[Anthony Munday]], [[Robert Wilson (dramatist)|Robert Wilson]], [[Richard Hathwaye]], [[Henry Chettle]], and the others, even including a young [[John Webster]]—could start a project, and accept advances on it, yet fail to produce anything stageworthy.{{sfn|Halliday|1964|pp=108–109, 374–375, 456–457}}

&lt;small&gt;Short yellow lines indicate 27 years — the average age these authors began their playwrighting careers.&lt;/small&gt;

==Genres==
[[Genre]]s of the period included the [[history play]], which depicted English or European history. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays about the lives of kings, such as ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' and ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'', belong to this category, as do [[Christopher Marlowe]]'s ''[[Edward II (play)|Edward II]]'' and [[George Peele]]'s ''[[Famous Chronicle of King Edward the First]]''. History plays dealt with more recent events, like ''[[A Larum for London]]'' which dramatizes the sack of [[Antwerp]] in 1576.

[[Tragedy]] was a very popular genre. Marlowe's tragedies were exceptionally successful, such as ''[[Doctor Faustus (play)|Dr. Faustus]]'' and ''[[The Jew of Malta]]''. The audiences particularly liked [[Revenge play|revenge dramas]], such as [[Thomas Kyd]]'s ''[[The Spanish Tragedy]]''. The four tragedies considered to be Shakespeare's greatest (''[[Hamlet]]'', ''[[Othello]]'', ''[[King Lear]]'', and ''[[Macbeth]]'') were composed during this period.

[[Comedy (drama)|Comedies]] were common, too. A subgenre developed in this period was the [[city comedy]], which deals satirically with life in London after the fashion of [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman]] [[New Comedy]]. Examples are [[Thomas Dekker (poet)|Thomas Dekker]]'s ''[[The Shoemaker's Holiday]]'' and [[Thomas Middleton]]'s ''[[A Chaste Maid in Cheapside]]''.

Though marginalised, the older genres like [[pastoral]] (''[[The Faithful Shepherdess]]'', 1608), and even the [[morality play]] (''[[Four Plays in One]]'', ca. 1608-13) could exert influences. After about 1610, the new hybrid subgenre of the [[tragicomedy]] enjoyed an efflorescence, as did the [[masque]] throughout the reigns of the first two [[House of Stuart|Stuart]] kings, [[James I of England|James I]] and [[Charles I of England|Charles I]].

==Printed texts==
Only a minority of the plays of English Renaissance theatre were ever printed. Of Heywood's 220 plays, only about 20 were published in book form.{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=375}} A little over 600 plays were published in the period as a whole, most commonly in individual [[book size|quarto]] editions. (Larger collected editions, like those of [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Shakespeare's]], [[Ben Jonson folios|Ben Jonson's]], and [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|Beaumont and Fletcher's]] plays, were a late and limited development.) Through much of the modern era, it was thought that play texts were popular items among Renaissance readers that provided healthy profits for the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|stationers]] who printed and sold them. By the turn of the 21st century, the climate of scholarly opinion shifted somewhat on this belief: some contemporary researchers argue that publishing plays was a risky and marginal business{{sfn|Blayney|1997}}—though this conclusion has been disputed by others.{{sfn|Farmer|Lesser|2005}} Some of the most successful publishers of the English Renaissance, like [[William Ponsonby (publisher)|William Ponsonby]] or [[Edward Blount]], rarely published plays.

A small number of plays from the era survived not in printed texts but in [[manuscript]] form.{{efn|For example ''[[Sir Thomas More (play)|Sir Thomas More]]'', ''[[John of Bordeaux]]'', ''[[Believe as You List]]'', and ''[[Sir John van Olden Barnavelt]].''}}

==The end of English Renaissance theatre==
{{main article|London theatre closure 1642}}{{See also|Antitheatricality}}
The rising [[Puritan]] movement was hostile toward theatre, as they felt that "entertainment" was sinful. Politically, playwrights and actors were clients of the monarchy and aristocracy, and most supported the Royalist cause. The Puritan faction, long powerful in London, gained control of the city early in the [[First English Civil War]], and on 2 September 1642, the [[Long Parliament]], pushed by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarian party]], under [[Puritan]] influence, banned the staging of plays in the London theatres though it did not, contrary to what is commonly stated, order the closure, let alone the destruction, of the theatres themselves:

{{quote
|title=''Acts and Ordinances of the Interregnum, 1642-1660''
|author=[[His Majesty's Stationery Office]]
|source="September 1642: Order for Stage-plays to cease"{{sfn|Firth|Rait|1911}}
|text=
Whereas the distressed Estate of Ireland, steeped in her own Blood, and the distracted Estate of England, threatened with a Cloud of Blood by a Civil War, call for all possible Means to appease and avert the Wrath of God, appearing in these Judgements; among which, Fasting and Prayer, having been often tried to be very effectual, having been lately and are still enjoined; and whereas Public Sports do not well agree with Public Calamities, nor Public Stage-plays with the Seasons of Humiliation, this being an Exercise of sad and pious Solemnity, and the other being Spectacles of Pleasure, too commonly expressing lascivious Mirth and Levity: It is therefore thought fit, and Ordained, by the Lords and Commons in this Parliament assembled, That, while these sad causes and set Times of Humiliation do continue, Public Stage Plays shall cease, and be forborn, instead of which are recommended to the People of this Land the profitable and seasonable considerations of Repentance, Reconciliation, and Peace with God, which probably may produce outward Peace and Prosperity, and bring again Times of Joy and Gladness to these Nations.}}

The Act purports the ban to be temporary ("...while these sad causes and set Times of Humiliation do continue, Public Stage Plays shall cease and be forborn") but does not assign a time limit to it.

Even after 1642, during the [[English Civil War]] and the ensuing [[English Interregnum|Interregnum]] ([[Commonwealth of England|English Commonwealth]], some English Renaissance theatre continued. For example, short comical plays called [[Drolls]] were allowed by the authorities, while full-length plays were banned. The theatre buildings were not closed but rather were used for purposes other than staging plays.{{efn|See for example the [[Red Bull Theatre]] and [[Robert Cox (actor)|Robert Cox]]}}

The performance of plays remained banned for most of the next eighteen years, becoming allowed again after the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] of the monarchy in 1660. The theatres began performing many of the plays of the previous era, though often in adapted forms. New genres of [[Restoration comedy]] and [[Restoration spectacular|spectacle]] soon evolved, giving English theatre of the later seventeenth century its distinctive character.

All references to Shakespeare's plays, unless otherwise specified, are taken from the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]]'s ''Folger Digital Editions'' texts edited by Barbara Mowat, Paul Werstine, Michael Poston, and Rebecca Niles. Under their referencing system, 3.1.55 means act 3, scene 1, line 55. Prologues, epilogues, scene directions, and other parts of the play that are not a part of character speech in a scene, are referenced using Folger Through Line Number: a separate line numbering scheme that includes every line of text in the play.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7233">'''Fratire''' is a type of 21st-century fiction literature written for and marketed to young men in a [[political correctness|politically incorrect]] and overtly [[masculinity|masculine]] fashion. The term was coined following the popularity of works by [[George Ouzounian]] (writing under the pen name Maddox) and [[Tucker Max]].&lt;ref name="NY TIMES"/&gt; Described as a satirical celebration of traditional masculinity, the genre has been criticized for allegedly promoting [[sexism]] and [[misogyny]].&lt;ref&gt;Ann Johnson, "The Subtleties of Blatant Sexism", ''Communication and Critical/Cultural Studies'', Volume 4, Issue 2 June 2007 , pages 166 - 183&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genre==
Fratire generally features male protagonists, usually in their twenties and thirties. It is characterized by masculine themes and could be considered the male equivalent of [[chick lit]].&lt;ref name="NY TIMES"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Harkin | first = James | title = The return of the real man | publisher = Financial Times (September 15, 2006) | date =  | url = http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto091520060937397349 | accessdate = 2010-06-20 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was popularized by [[Tucker Max]]'s ''[[I Hope They Serve Beer in Hell]]'' and [[Maddox (writer)|Maddox's]] webpage titled [[The Best Page in the Universe]] and his book ''[[The Alphabet of Manliness]]''. According to one of the authors, "fratire as a genre represents the non-mainstream literary reaction to the feminization of masculinity," although not all the books address this so directly.&lt;ref name="maddox"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tucker-max/pass-the-beer-in-defense_b_22530.html |title = Pass the Beer: In Defense of "Fratire" |publisher  = The Huffington Post (August 6, 2006)|author = Tucker Max|date =|accessdate = 2008-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
Fratire is a [[portmanteau]] of [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] and [[satire]]. The term was introduced by ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter [[Warren St. John]] in a 2006 article titled ''Dude, here's my book''. Allegedly, it was the only word allowed by the editor.&lt;ref name="NY TIMES"&gt;{{cite news | last = St. John | first = Warren | title = Dude, Here's My Book | publisher = New York Times (April 16, 2006) | date = April 16, 2006| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/16/fashion/sundaystyles/16CADS.html | accessdate = 2008-02-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="maddox"/&gt;  Tucker Max, after first hearing the term during a telephone interview with St. John, said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Great Holy Jesus. Warren, that is awful. First off, I wasn't in a fraternity. Neither was Maddox. In fact, none of the writers you are profiling in your article was in a frat. Please, call it anything else."&lt;ref name="maddox"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term aimed to classify the recent publication of male-centric books that focused on alcohol and sexual themes. Publishers continued to push the genre as a sales tactic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/tag/fratire/products ''Fratire products''] Amazon.com, Retrieved on 2008-09-14&lt;/ref&gt; After the success of the books published by Max and Maddox, publishers and reporters attempted to capitalize on the trend with new iterations of the word, including "[[lad-lit]]," "dicklit," "frat-lit" and "menaissance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Criticism of fratire==
[[Melissa Lafsky]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' described the genre as "[[misogyny]] for sale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/melissa-lafsky/misogyny-for-sale-the-ne_b_22313.html |title= Misogyny for sale: The new "Frat-Lit" trend |publisher  = The Huffington Post |last = Lafsky | first = Melissa | authorlink = Melissa Lafsky| date= 6 June 2006|accessdate = 22 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lafsky wrote that fratire authors were profiting by fueling young male anger concerning societal demands for equality. In a [[Salon.com]] interview with [[Rebecca Traister]], Ouzounian said his writing was a nostalgic parody of old-fashioned masculinity and that society had moved too far forward to return to those concepts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Traister|first=Rebecca|authorlink=Rebecca Traister|title=It's a man's world|work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|date= 2 June 2006|url=http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2006/06/02/maddox_qa/|accessdate=15 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with [[Public Radio International]], Maddox offered the suggestion that the misogyny often associated with the genre of fratire had become more acceptable because women are stronger than they've ever been in society, and that singling out women as the only group not okay to lampoon is a sexist act in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://216.22.0.192/images/maddox_pri.mp3|title = Save the males|publisher = Public Radio International |author = To The Best of our Knowledge|date = 29 June 2006 |accessdate = 29 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 article, [[Kira Cochrane]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'' disputed that idea, stating there still remained much inequality between men and women. Cochran called the fratire genre a regression to old-fashioned sexism "presented under the veil of irony".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Cochrane|first=Kira|authorlink=Kira Cochrane|title =Retrosexual, or just misogynist?|work=[[New Statesman]]|date= 5 June 2008|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/society/2008/06/cochrane-women-woman-long|accessdate=14 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2501">The '''Goethe Society of North America''' ('''GSNA''') was founded in December 1979 in [[San Francisco]] as a [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to the encouragement of research on [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] (1749–1832) and his age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goethe Society of North America|url=http://www.goethesociety.org/|work=goethesociety.org|publisher=Goethe Society of North America|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goethe Society has allied organization status with the [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA), the [[American Society for Eighteenth-Century Studies]] (ASECS), and the [[German Studies Association]] (GSA).

== Book Series and Yearbook ==
The Goethe Society sponsors a book series, "New Studies in the 'Age of Goethe'" published by [[Bucknell University]] Press.  The book series aims to publish one or two volumes per year, focusing on the “Age of Goethe” in relation
to the fields of literature, history (including art history and 
history of science), philosophy, art, music, or politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Goethe Society of North America announces, "New Studies in the ‘Age of Goethe,’"|url=http://www.goethesociety.org/materials/bookseries.pdf|work=gothesociety.org|publisher=Bucknell University Press|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1982 the Goethe Society has published the ''Goethe Yearbook'', which is composed mainly of research, articles, and an extensive reviews section.  The ''Yearbook'' aims above all to encourage and publish original English-language contributions to the understanding of Goethe and other authors of the Goethezeit, while also welcoming contributions from scholars around the world. The book review section seeks to evaluate a wide selection of recent publications on the period&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Goethe Yearbook|url=http://www.goethesociety.org/pages/yearbook.html|work=goethesociety.org|publisher=Goethe Society of North America|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has become a respected organ of eighteenth-century studies in diverse disciplines and which is recognized as a vital compendium of current research in its articles and its extensive review section. The ''Goethe Yearbook'' is distributed free to all paid-up members of the GSNA

'''Heaven Leigh Casteel''' is the protagonist of the novels in the Casteel series created by [[V. C. Andrews]], and concluded by [[Andrew Neiderman]] after her death.

==''Heaven''==
The first novel of the same name, ''Heaven'', commences with Heaven and her family's pitiful struggle against poverty in the hills of the West Virginia mountains. Heaven, her father Luke Casteel, her stepmother Sarah, her four half brothers and sisters, Tom, Fanny, Keith and Our Jane, and her grandparents live in a one bedroom shack in the Willies, the mountains above the town Winnerow.

Scorned by the people of the valley as being "hill-billies" and "hill scum", Heaven's pride remains intact, although she is wounded by her father, who ignores her as if she does not exist while lavishing attention on the other children. One night, Heaven's granny takes her to the graveyard and shows her a gravestone with the word "Angel" carved upon it. Heaven learns that the reason for her father's animosity is that her birth caused the death of her real mother, Luke's first wife, whose real name was [[Leigh VanVoreen]], but everybody in the Willies called her 'Angel'.

Anny then presents Heaven with her mother's valuable heirloom suitcase, which contains her mother's rich clothes, the like of which Heaven has never seen, and what soon becomes Heaven's most prized possession, a portrait doll that was modeled after her mother. The doll's face is a mirror of Heaven's, except that the doll has silvery blond hair.

Heaven flourishes into a gifted student, and she and Tom treasure books and excel in English. Fanny, however, is more interested in boys than books, and acts up with Heaven, constantly reveling in their father's attention. But it is when Heaven meets and captures the heart of Logan Stonewall that Fanny really begins to cause trouble. She always wants what Heaven has, and this becomes a reoccurring theme in their relationship. Logan and Heaven become childhood sweethearts and pledge their hearts and lives to each other. However, Logan is the son of the local pharmacist, and his wealthy mother scorns Heaven as an ignorant hillbilly.

After the premature death of Sarah and Luke's fifth child, Heaven's grandmother passes away, causing her grandfather to become senile. Sarah falls into a deep post-natal depression and then disappears, leaving a cryptic note that seems to indicate suicide. The children are left to fend for themselves when their father abandons them as well. Heaven becomes a surrogate mother, skipping school in order to take care of her brothers and sisters, insisting that they attend school even if she cannot. When Luke returns, he brings the devastating news that he is ill with syphilis and that he plans to sell his children for $500 a piece on Christmas Day in order to fund his treatment. Heaven watches heartbroken as her family is split up and sold off. Keith and Our Jane are sold to a wealthy-looking couple, which gives Heaven some comfort as Jane is very attached to Keith. Fanny is sold to the town pastor, Reverend Wise. Tom is sold to farmer, Buck Henry.

Heaven is sold to Kitty and Cal Dennison, who live in Candlewick, a sub division in Atlanta. Separated from her siblings and her beloved Logan, Heaven soon realizes that she has been bought as a slave for Kitty, who detested Heaven's mother for marrying Luke, as she was in love with him. After aborting his baby, she discovered she was unable to have any more children and therefore bought Heaven as some sort of twisted revenge against her father. Kitty abuses Heaven physically and emotionally, even scalding her in a burning hot bath to "cleanse" her of her hillbilly dirt, and burns the beloved portrait doll of her mother. Despite all this, Heaven finds some comfort in her relationship with Cal.

Cal lavishes attention on Heaven, buying her clothes, and treating her to all she has been denied in her deprived upbringing, such as films and fine restaurants. Vulnerable and longing for a father figure, Heaven laps up this attention, and is unable to defend herself when Cal's attentions become sexual. When Kitty becomes seriously ill, he seduces Heaven. She is shamed and devastated, blaming herself for what happened, unable to understand why he did this. When Cal announces that they are returning to Winnerow so a dying Kitty can see her parents, she seizes the opportunity to see Logan. However, when she confesses what happened, he runs from her leaving her alone in the world. Heaven is temporarily reunited with Tom, Fanny, and her Grandpa, but, still bitter and hateful, she avoids her father. Upon Kitty's death, Cal abandons her, and she boards a plane for Boston to find her maternal grandparents.

==''Dark Angel''==
Upon arriving in Boston, Heaven meets Jillian Tatterton, her wealthy grandmother, and her second husband who is 20 years her junior, Tony Tatterton. Tony was Leigh's stepfather, and Heaven is grieved to learn that her real grandfather died several years earlier. The couple take Heaven to Tony's ancestral home, Farthingale Manor, the enormous estate that her mother ran from. Heaven is shocked and deeply hurt to learn however, that her grandparents only expect her for a short visit. Heaven feeds them lies about her mother, including that she didn't give birth to Heaven straight away, but that her parents were married for a year before her birth.

Heaven is well accommodated, and resides in the suites that were her mother's. Heaven begins to delve into her mother's past, and comes face to face with a piece of her past when she meets Troy Tatterton, Tony's younger brother who lives in the cottage behind the English maze when Heaven becomes lost in the maze. Heaven is immediately attracted to the handsome and talented Troy, yet is at first reluctant to let Heaven into his life, yet she pressures him into letting down his wall of hostility despite Tony ordering her to stay away from him.

Heaven learns that he was three and her mother was twelve when they first met, and Leigh was like an older sister to him. Troy and Heaven eventually become lovers, and Heaven forgets Logan as she discovers her passion and love for Troy are stronger than what she had felt for Logan. Troy soon reveals to her however, that he has premonitions, and dreams that reveal to him that he will not live much longer, and he has no reason to doubt them since all his past dreams have come true, including his dream of Leigh's death.

Deeply disturbed but unwilling to lose him, Heaven persuades him to marry her. The two are happy for a brief time, until Troy's detective agency locates Keith and Our Jane. Heaven rushes to 'save them' when Troy becomes ill and wishes her to go on and find them, only to discover once she is there that they no longer need her and that they love their adoptive parents when they deny knowing her. 

Devastated, she goes to Fanny, who spitefully convinces her to go to Winnerow to get back her baby Darcy that she sold to the Reverend Wayland Wise who adopted her and raped her. Heaven reluctantly agrees, but discovers it is a mistake and impossible once she is there. Once in Winnerow, Heaven runs into Cal, who again bombards her with his needs and wants, and tries to force himself on her. Heaven however, disillusions him and pushes him put of her life forever.

Decided on going to find her grandfather in their old cabin, Heaven gets caught in a storm between Winnerow and the Willies, only to be discovered by Logan who finds Heaven's car broken down on the highway, and takes her to the cabin. Heaven however, returns only to discover the money she has been sending her grandfather had been put towards restoring the cabin and it is now an adequate home.

As the storm becomes more violent, Heaven comes down with the same illness as Troy. Stuck with no one but Logan to look after her, Heaven submits to his efforts to help her. She dreams of Troy, and in her desperation to get back to him she shouts at Logan to let her contact him. Logan grows jealous and angry, confessing he still loves her and wants her back.

When the storm clears and Heaven recovers, she returns to Troy, only to be encountered by Tony who confesses he was pleased by her upcoming marriage to Troy, but that now he cannot let it go ahead. A devastated Heaven forces the truth from him, and he reveals that the reason her mother fled from Farthingale Manor was that he fell in love with her and raped her, and that he discovered from Troy that Heaven was really a year older than she first pretended, and thereby, he is her father.

Heartbroken that Troy is her uncle and she cannot marry him, Heaven goes to confess the truth to him, but upon seeing him, she cannot do it. Yet Jillian had revealed the truth to him, having known it all along, and in order to protect Heaven, Troy leaves his home leaving her a letter insisting that she go to Jillian and hear the whole truth.

Heaven goes to Jillian's suite, and in revealing and finally accepting the truth, Jillian falls into insanity. Heaven leaves Farthingale Manor to escape the memories of all she has lost, yet upon her return she learns that Troy's prophecy has indeed come true. He killed himself as he was unable to live without her.

Devastated, Heaven once again flees to Winnerow, this time to confront her father who has again married and has another son, Drake. Her beloved brother Tom is living with him, and both work at the circus. Heaven is appalled at Tom's willingness to give up his dreams in order to help their father attain his, and as revenge for all he has done she dyes her hair blond, the same shade as her mothers, puts on one of her mothers old dresses, and approaches her father when he is lion taming at the circus.

Luke believes his Angel has come back to him, and when he drops his gun, the lion mauls and kills Tom. Blaming herself, she returns to the cabin to become a teacher at the Winnerow school, to pass on her love of books to those in the same position she was. She acknowledges that she will eventually become Logan's wife, as the waters have stilled between them.

==''Fallen Hearts''==
Proud and beautiful, Heaven comes back to the hills - to rise at last above her family's shame!

As Logan's bride, she would savor now the love she had sought for so long. And free from her father's clutches, she would live again in her backwoods town, a respected teacher and cherished wife.

But after a wedding trip to Boston's Farthinghale Manor and a lavish, elegant party, Heaven and Logan are persuaded to stay... lured by Tony Tatterton's guile to live amidst the Tatterton wealth and privilege.

Then the ghosts of Heaven's past rise up once more, writhing around her fragile happiness and threatening her precious love with scandal and jealousy, sinister passions and dangerous dreams!

==Synopsis==
In 2010, Superintendent of Public Schools for Bertie County, Chip Zullinger (1951-2014) had been hired to address the school district's serious shortcomings.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;  After completing four large architectural projects with designer Emily Pilloton (author of the 2009 book ''Design Revolution'') and architect Matt Miller,&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; Zullinger invited the two to create a high school curriculum.

Pilloton and Miller described the curriculum, ultimately named '''''Studio H''''', as [[Industrial arts|shop class]] for the 21st century, where the design process could address the community's problems and its own sense of possibility. Named after its focus on "humanity, habitats, health and happiness,"&lt;ref name="variety"&gt;{{cite news

Pilloton and partner Miller, worked with 10 (initially 13)&lt;ref name="the.only"/&gt; high school students at Bertie Early College High School through the year-long,  full-scale design/build curriculum &amp;mdash; following six design rules: there is no design without critical action; we work 'with' not 'for;' we start locally and scale globally; create systems, not stuff; document, share and measure; and finally build.

The project team and the community had identified a new farmer's market as a viable and desirable community project, and under the leadership of Pilloton and Miller the students focused on developing design and construction skills: critical thinking, research (e.g., analyzing Buckminster Fuller's [[Dymaxion House]]), sketching, and drafting, along with welding and real-world construction trades. Pilloton and Miller in turn completed construction documents and specifications, worked with a structural engineer and filed for construction permits &amp;mdash; while also preparing and conducting three hours of daily classroom instruction.&lt;ref name="daily"&gt;{{cite news

Together the Project H team identified student Stevie Mizelle's preliminary concept model to develop further, subsequently completing construction of the farmer's market to approximately 75% before the school year ended.  The design features a large wood platform for vendor booths with vertical wood trusses supporting a rectilinear roofed canopy with wood slats designed to filter and control solar glare; a main floor at the same height above grade as a pickup truck bed, allowing vendors to back up to the "loading dock" at each vendor stall and walk their goods directly off their truck into their booth; and a long ramp at the front to allow pedestrian accessibility and to provide a symbolic front porch for visitors.&lt;ref name="studioh2"&gt;{{cite news

Early in the school year, Pilloton and Miller chose to continue with the project after Zullinger, their prime backer, was dismissed by the school board, and the board became unwilling to underwrite the curriculum and withdrew their offered salaries.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; Pilloton and Miller continued to work with the students and subsequently completed construction of the farmer's market after the school year ended.  The Windsor Super Market opened in October 2011.

Students featured in ''Studio H'' were Erick Bowen, Rodecoe Dunlow, Kerron Hayes, Anthony Johnson, Stevie Mizelle, Cameron Perry, Cj Robertson, Jamesha Thompson, Colin White and Alexia Williams.  The film also features County Commissioner Ron Wesson as well as volunteer Eric Wandmacher (friend of Pilloton and Miller) and Superintendent of Public Schools, Chip Zullinger.&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;{{cite news

==Background==

{{quote box |quote =  
My goal in going in to Bertie County was not to go in and just design for them, but to really teach their kids about the design process and do something for the community with their high school students. That, in a way, transcends a lot of this social design movement stuff ... and hopefully [it's] the next phase of what that movement can be.|source= —Matthew Miller'' &lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;}}

Prior to one-year '''''Studio H''''' curriculum in Bertie County, Pilloton and Miller had completed four architectural projects with the school board, as backed by Superintendent Zullinger: four playgrounds, three computer labs, a weight room for the football team, and a county-wide graphic campaign.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; Friction on the school board developed with another Zullinger-backed project, "Connect Bertie," a project to bring free county-wide internet connectivity by paying an outside entity, [[Century Link]], to provide the internet services at a cost of $2 million annually.  The tension culminated with Zullwinger's dismissal, followed a reversal of the dismissal and then acceptance of his resignation.  Without his support and the offered salaries, Zullwinger's departure directly threatened the Studio H project.&lt;ref name="zull"&gt;{{cite news

Other tensions arose, and in a 2013 interview, Pilloton identified a racially and politically charged context that surrounded the curriculum and the project &amp;mdash; describing Bertie County as a place where "hundreds of years of slavery and institutionalized racism is very much still alive and kicking."&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt; On release of the film, Pilloton and Miller said "they said they still believe it was fear of change – not lack of money in a budget that topped $30 million – that ultimately led to the board's decision."&lt;ref name="fear of change"&gt;{{cite news

Pilloton had grown up near [[Mt. Tamalpais]], California, attributing the German toy ''Quadro'' with inspiring her interest in design.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;  She later studied at the [[College of Environmental Design, UC Berkeley]] and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], during a period when there was no curriculum but when there was a 100,000 sf shop class.&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;

Matt Miller was born in [[West Virginia]] and has architecture degrees from the [[University of Tennessee]] and [[Cranbrook Academy of Art]].  He has taught architecture and design at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]], the [[College of Creative Studies]], and UC Berkeley &amp;mdash; and worked with [[Architecture for Humanity]].  Miller was the first student at the Cranbrook Academy to design and also build his thesis project (along with classmate Thomas Gardner): a 900 sf, two-story block infill house&lt;ref name="house"/&gt; at 2126 Pierce Street in [[Poletown East, Detroit|Poletown, Detroit]].  The house, ultimately abandoned,&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; had a construction budget of $60,000 and used all-volunteer labor along with carefully selected materials (e.g., concrete block and rubber membrane roofing) to keep costs down.&lt;ref name="house"/&gt;

==Reception==
As of mid-2014, the film had received a rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] of 81% favorable critic response and 100% favorable audience response.&lt;ref name="RT"&gt;{{cite news

''[[Architectural Record]]'' called the film "A document of America at its most vulnerable."&lt;ref name="film82"/&gt; ''The New York Times'' reviewer Nicolas Rapold said "the movie's biggest weakness comes with its tendency to film people telling us what's going on rather than having us observe."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news

==Follow up==
Pilloton and Miller, who had been a couple, split up&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt; some time after the period depicted in the documentary.  Matthew Miller is now the lead design/build instructor at '''''(co)studio''''', a public high school program in [[Carbondale, Colorado]].  Pilloton continues to direct Studio H, which is now in its fourth year, at the at REALM Charter School in [[Berkeley, California]].&lt;ref name="indie"/&gt;

Studio H has grown to include more than 200 students,&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite news

Students have worked on these projects for high school and college credits as well as stipends.&lt;ref name="studioh"&gt;{{cite news

At a point early in the film, student Stevie Mizelle &amp;mdash; whose preliminary design for the farmer's market was ultimately selected by the team for design development &amp;mdash; joked: "school, I hate it, my dad hated it, my granddaddy hated it. I'm carrying on a tradition."  He currently studies animal behavior at North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC, making Dean's List his freshman year.&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;  He was the first male relative in his immediate family to graduate from high school, attributing his graduation to his work with Studio H.&lt;ref name="daily"/&gt;

'''Ilocandia''' is the term given to the traditional homeland of the [[Ilocano people]].

From the original western strip of Northern Luzon (now known as the Region 1 or [[Ilocos Region]]), Ilocandia has spread throughout the [[Cagayan Valley]], [[Cordillera Administrative Region]], and northern [[Central Luzon]].

Although there are also a large number of [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]] in other parts of the [[Philippines]] like, [[Palawan]] and [[Mindanao]], these are not considered to be a part of Ilocandia, as they are not part of the traditional Ilocano homeland.

==[[Provinces of the Philippines|Provinces]] of the Ilocandia==
Today, the first three regions of the [[Philippines]] (Region 1 or Ilocos Region, Region 2 or Cagayan Valley and Region 3 or Central Luzon) comprise the present-day Ilocandia. Although most of the residents of the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]] belong to another [[ethnic group]] (the [[Igorot]]s), the predominance of the usage of [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] makes it also a part of the Ilocandia.

===[[Ilocos Region|Region 1]] or the [[Ilocos Region]]===
The northern portion of [[Ilocos Region]] (Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur) is the original [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]] homeland. Originally composed of a single province known as [[Ilocos Province]], it used to cover the western part of Northern [[Luzon]]. Today, the [[Ilocos Region]] includes four [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]], [[Pangasinan]] being the home of more than half of the region's population.

It is mistaken to assume that residents of Pangasinan are Ilocano speakers considering that according to the 2000 census, only 44% of Pangasinan population speak Ilocano. Pangasinan cannot even be considered as the original homeland of the Ilocano people since Ilocanos in Pangasinan are either migrants or descendants of migrants from the northern portion of Region 1 (Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur).

The northern portion of the country is known as the '''''Nuclear Ilocandia''''' since only 66% of Region 1 population are Ilocanos according to 2000 census. A substantial number of Region 1 population are [[Pangasinan]], whose population accounts for 27% of the region's population. Other peoples also live in Region 1 such as the '''Bago''', '''Agta''' and '''Ibaloi'''.

===[[Cagayan Valley|Region 2]] or [[Cagayan Valley]]===
When the arid lands of the [[Ilocos Region]] could no longer support the growing number of [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]], they tried the less chartered [[Cagayan Valley]], which they later on find more suitable to their [[agriculture|agricultural]] way of life. Although not originally a part of the '''Ilocandia''', the [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]] have conquered the area, thus making it a part of the '''Greater Ilocandia'''.

===[[Central Luzon|Region 3]] or [[Central Luzon]]===
Though a predominantly [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan-speaking]], [[Pangasinan language|Pangasinan-speaking]], and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog-speaking]] region, [[Central Luzon]] acts as fringe-area of Ilocandia. No [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] in the region is a predominantly [[Ilocano language|Ilocano-speaking]] area, but some northern [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipalities]] use it as a ''[[lingua franca]]'', especially in northernmost [[Tarlac]], [[Zambales]], [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]], and [[Nueva Ecija]], with the southern parts around [[Bulacan]], [[Pampanga]], and [[Bataan]] leaning more towards [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]].

The table below shows only the [[Provinces of the Philippines|provinces]] that have a significant number of [[Ilocano language|Ilocano speakers]]:

===[[Cordillera Administrative Region|CAR]] or the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]]===
Technically, the peoples of the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]] belong to another ethno-linguistic group collectively known as the [[Igorot]]s. Hence, they are not a part of the '''Original Ilocandia''' nor the '''Greater Ilocandia'''. However, because of the presence of the different [[Indigenous peoples in the Philippines|ethno-linguistic groups]], [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] has become the medium of communication between these different tribes.

'''Infopoverty''' is the name given to the Programme and the World Conference started in 2001, in the ambit of the United Nations, aimed to fight poverty towards the application of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]], Information and Communication Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketpress.info/notiziario_det.php?art=3958 Marketpress]: Pierpaolo Saporito, Presidente di OCCAM, nominato High Level Advisor dell'alleanza globale delle Nazioni Unite per le ICT e lo sviluppo . Tale nomina, confermata con lettera del Vice Segretario Generale della Nazioni Unite, Jose Antonio Ocampo, rappresenta un importante riconoscimento dell'Onu per il lavoro svolto da Occam e dal Programma Infopoverty nella lotta alla povertà attraverso le nuove tecnologie della comunicazione e dell'informazione&lt;/ref&gt;
The term has been coined in 1998 by Arch. Pierpaolo Saporito, Founder and President of [[OCCAM - Observatory on Digital Communication]] and Gerardo Zepeda-Bermudez, Vice-President and Member of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://qn.quotidiano.net/esteri/2011/03/26/479979-poverta_combattere_grazie_cellulare.shtml Quotidiano]: Pierpaolo Saporito, presidente di OCCAM, fondatore insieme al Parlamento Europeo e le Nazioni Unite di Infopoverty&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infopoverty World Conference==
The Infopoverty World Conference is the annual international conference, under the auspices of the United Nations, at the United Nations headquarters, New York,&lt;ref&gt;[[Chhavi Rajawat|Wikipedia]]: Infopoverty World Conference held at the United Nations&lt;/ref&gt; organized by [[Observatory of Digital Communications|OCCAM]], together with the [[European Parliament]], [[UNESCO]], and other scientific and university institutions (Infopoverty Institute at Oklahoma University).&lt;ref&gt;[http://infopoverty.ou.edu]: The Infopoverty Institute coordinates with the Observatory for Cultural and Audiovisual Communication (OCCAM) and collaborates with the international community in applying these services especially to impoverished communities around the world.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmeplus.eu/2011/03/infopoverty-world-conference-2011-24-25-march/ Emmeplus]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}: The Infopoverty Programme was started by the first Infopoverty World Conference Conference, organized by OCCAM in 2001 with the European Parliament, UNESCO Mediterranean Programme, UNIC and other scientific and universityThe Infopoverty Programme was started by the first Infopoverty World Conference Conference, organized by OCCAM in 2001 with the European Parliament, UNESCO Mediterranean Programme, UNIC and other scientific and university institutions&lt;/ref&gt; At its 13th edition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un-ngls.org/spip.php?article4261]:Article on the 13th Infopoverty World Conference in United Nations Non-Governmental Liaison Service e-bulletin&lt;/ref&gt; the Infopoverty World Conference saw the participation of more than 100 international organizations,hundreds of from Governments, international and regional organizations, public and private institutions and the civil society and 63 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmeplus.eu/2011/03/infopoverty-world-conference-2011-24-25-march/Emmeplus]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}:The past editions of the Infopoverty World Conference enjoyed the participation of more than 100 international organizations, 10000 participants from Governments&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infopoverty Programme==
The Infopoverty Programme transfers into concrete actions the orientations emerged from the Conference, realizing the ICT Villages, aimed to help the most disadvantaged communities.The first pilot projects were realized at San Ramon and San Pedro, Honduras, in cooperation with the local Ministry of Science and Technologies, following the devastation from Hurricane Mitch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130218135950/http://telecom.esa.int/telecom/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=28074 ESA]: Whole areas were left without either electricity or telephone. Two villages, however, Saint Ramon and San Pedro were supplied with solar energy and with satellite terminals allowing broadband connection to the Internet&lt;/ref&gt;
These experiences were instrumental for the definition, thanks to the collaboration with the most important international institutions, of the ICT Village model,&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;[http://www.infopoverty.net/mission.html%20 Infopoverty Programme – Mission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326003107/http://www.infopoverty.net/mission.html |date=26 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; validated by the World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis, 2005, with the creation of the Borj Touil Village.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crystalweb.it/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=print&amp;sid=396 Crystalweb] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602051006/http://www.crystalweb.it/modules.php?name=News |date=2 June 2013 }}: Infopoverty Programme al summit mondiale sulla società dell'informazione&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internet geography''', also called '''cybergeography''', is a subdiscipline of [[geography]] that studies the spatial organization of the [[Internet]], from social, economic, cultural, and technological perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mapping the 'Geography' of the Internet|url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/09/mapping-the-geography-of-the-internet/279434/|accessdate = 2015-09-15|first = Emma|last = Green|date = 2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Global Geographies of the Internet|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=HGHwMXVXzD8C|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2012-08-01|isbn = 9789400712454|first = Barney|last = Warf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The core assumption of Internet geography is that the location of servers, [[website]]s, data, services, and infrastructure is key to understand the development and the dynamics of the Internet. Among the topics covered by this discipline, of particular importance are information geography and [[digital divide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Towards a study of information geographies: (im)mutable augmentations and a mapping of the geographies of information|journal = Geo: Geography and Environment|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 2054-4049|pages = 88–105|volume = 2|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/geo2.8|first = Mark|last = Graham|first2 = Stefano|last2 = De Sabbata|first3 = Matthew A.|last3 = Zook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-colonial Kamrup was a large territory consisting of Western Assam and [[North Bengal]],&lt;ref&gt;Upendranath Goswami (1970), ''A Study on Kāmrūpī: A Dialect of Assamese'', Page iii&lt;/ref&gt; which keep reducing in size in subsequent periods. In the nineteenth century eastern Kamrup became part of [[Colonial Assam]] while parts of western Kamrup merged with [[Bengal]]. Ancient cities [[Pragjyotishpura]] and [[Durjaya]] were located in modern Kamrup. Kamrup is considered as a politically, socially and culturally separate unit,&lt;ref&gt;Upendranath Goswami (1970), ''A Study on Kāmrūpī: A Dialect of Assamese''&lt;/ref&gt; and cultural artefacts from this region are called [[Kamrupi culture|Kamrupi]].

==Etymology==
The origin of name attributed to a legend in [[Hindu Epics|epic]], the [[Kalika Purana]] mentioned that country got its name from cupid [[Kamadeva]] (Kama), who regain his form (Rupa) back from ashes here.&lt;ref&gt;Hemanta Kumar Sarma (1992), ''Socio-Religious Life of the Assamese Hindus: A Study of the Fasts and Festivals of Kamrup District'', p.4, p.p.262, Daya Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Kamrup (350–1140)==
{{main|Ancient Kamrup}}{{Further|Kamarupa}}
The first historical mention of [[Kamarupa]] comes from [[Samudragupta]]'s [[Allahabad Stone Pillar Inscription of Samudra Gupta|4th-century Allahabad prasasti]], where it is mentioned along with [[Davaka]] and [[Samatata]] as frontier kingdoms of the [[Gupta empire]]. Davaka, currently in [[Nagaon district]] (central Assam), is not mentioned in historical texts again, which indicates that the kings of Kamarupa must have absorbed it.&lt;ref&gt;"It is presumed that (Kalyana Varman) conquered Davaka, incorporating it within the kingdom of Kamarupa" {{harv|Puri|1968|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the kingdom came to be known as Kamarupa, the kings called themselves the rulers of Pragjyotisha (''Pragjyotishadhipati''), and not Kamarupa;&lt;ref&gt;"The name Kamarupa does not appear in local grants where Pragjyotisha alone figures with the local rulers called Pragjyotishadhipati." {{harv|Puri|1968|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; nevertheless Kamarupa continued to be mentioned in inscriptions, such as [[Nidhanpur copperplate inscription|Nidhanpur inscription]] of Bhaskar Varman.&lt;ref&gt;[[Epigraphia Indica]] Vol XII and XIX&lt;/ref&gt; Vaidydeva, an 11th-century ruler, named Kamarupa as a ''mandala'' within the Pragjyotisha ''bhukti''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Puri|1968|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sircar, the Kamarupa mandala is congruent to undivided Kamrup of the modern times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sircar|1990|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the epigraphic records define Kamarupa as a smaller region within the historic kingdom, the 9th–10th-century [[shakta]] work [[Kalika Purana]] names the kingdom Kamarupa. [[Yogini Tantra]] provides the traditional boundary: [[Karatoya river]] in the west, Dikkaravasini (Sadiya) in the east and the Brahmaputra-Lakhya river confluence in the south forming a triangle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sircar|1990|pp=63–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both the western boundary as well as the name agrees with the 7th-century account left by Chinese traveller [[Hiuen Tsang]] who visited the region in seventh century c.e, identified the kingdom as Kamarupa (Ka-mo-lu-po) which was located to the east of the Karatoya (Ka-lo-tu).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sircar|1990|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the ancient kingdom covered initially present undivided Kamrup region, [[Western Assam]]&lt;ref&gt;Tej Ram Sharma (1978), ''Personal and Geographical Names in the Gupta Inscriptions'', p.254&lt;/ref&gt; but later expanded to include rest of the [[Brahmaputra valley]], [[North Bengal]] as well as most of the northern parts of [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]] and at some point parts of [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]], starting with acquisition of Davaka (Central Assam) in east. The medieval and pre-modern usage of "Kamrup" was limited to North Bengal and western Assam.

==Medieval Kamrup==

===Kamrup/Kamata (1255-1581)===
{{main|Kamata kingdom}}
The Kamarupa region soon lost a unified political rule. Sandhya, a 13th-century ruler in the Kamarupanagara ([[North Guwahati]]), moved his capital to present-day North Bengal and his kingdom came to be called Kamata;&lt;ref&gt;"Hema Saraswati in his ''Prahrada-carit'' says that Durlabhanarayan was the unequaled king of Kamata-mandala" {{harv|Neog|1990|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes as Kamata-Kamrup,&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gogoi|2002|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its eastern boundary at the Manas river.&lt;ref&gt;"The invasion of Mughisuddin, though abortive, had shaken the Kamarupa kingdom.  It was reorganized as a new state. 'Kamata' by name with Kamatapur as capital.  The exact time when the change was made is uncertain.  But possibly it had been made by Sandhya (c1250-1270) as a safeguard against mounting dangers from the east and the west.  Its control on the eastern regions beyond the Manah (Manas river) was lax." {{harv|Sarkar|1992|pp=40–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This kingdom was a part of the original Kamarupa kingdom and included in general Koch Bihar, Darrang, Kamrup districts, and northern Mymensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sarkar|1992|p=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the extreme east of the erstwhile Kamarupa kingdom the [[Chutiya kingdom|Chutiya]], [[Kachari kingdom|Kachari]] and the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahom]] kingdoms emerged, with the [[Baro-Bhuyan]]s providing the buffer between these kingdoms in the east and the Kamata kingdom in the west.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Sircar|1990|p=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kamrup/Koch Hajo (1581-1615)===
{{main|Koch Hajo}}
In the beginning of the 16th century Viswa Singha filled the vacuum left by the destruction of the Khen dynasty of Kamata and consolidated his rule over the Baro-Bhuyan chieftains ruling over the Kamrup region, and by the time of Naranarayana, the kingdom extended a firm rule between the Karatoya and the Bhareli rivers.  Even though the Koch kings called themselves Kamateshwars (lords of Kamata),&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Nath|1989|p=}}&lt;/ref&gt; their kingdom came to be called the Koch kingdom and not as Kamrup.

In 1581 the Kamata kingdom was bifurcated with Raghudev gaining control over the portion to the east of the Sankosh river up to the Bharali river&lt;ref&gt;Though [[Chilarai]] and Naranarayana established control up to [[Subansiri river]] via the [[Treaty of Majuli]], the [[Sukhaamphaa]] recovered control between [[Bhareli River|Bhareli]] and Subansiri soon after.&lt;/ref&gt; in the northbank; and east of the Brahmaputra in present-day Bangladesh.  Raghudev’s kingdom came to be called [[Koch Hajo]] in Muslim chronicles, and Kamrup in [[Ekasarana Dharma|Ekasarana]] documents.&lt;ref&gt;"The eastern division (of the Koch kingdom) was known as 'Kamrup' in the local sources and as 'Koch Hajo' in the Persian chronicles." {{harv|Nath|1989|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the Mughal gained power in Dhaka, Koch Bihar entered into an alliance with them, and arraigned themselves against Parikshitnarayana, the son of Raghudev, who had come to power in Koch Hajo in the meanwhile.  The Mughals pushed eastward, removed Parikshit from power in Koch Hajo/Kamrup by 1615 (up to the Barnadi river), and came into direct military conflict with the Ahom kingdom; and after the first round of battles, they established control over nearly the entire Koch Hajo, right up to Barnadi river.&lt;ref&gt;[[Treaty of Asurar Ali]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarkar Kamrup (1639-1681)===
The Mughals established four [[Sarkar (country subdivision)|sarkar]]s in the newly acquired land---among which were Dhekeri (between Sankosh and Manas) and Kamrup (between Manas and Barnadi).&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gogoi|2002|p=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mughals lost Kamrup for ever in 1682.

===Kamrup/Borphukan's domain (1682-1820)===
After the [[Battle of Itakhuli]] (1682), the [[Ahom kingdom]] established control over Sarkar Kamrup, and it became the domain of the [[Borphukan]], based in Guwahati.  The region continued to be called Kamrup and its eastern and western boundaries were identical to the later British district.&lt;ref&gt;"Camroop (Kamrup), on the west, or towards Bengal, is bounded by the Manaha river (Manas river); on the north by Raotan, on the east by Bushnudeee (Barnadi river) which separates it from Dehrungh (Darrang) and on the south by Berhampooter (Brahmaputra river)", Wade, Dr John Peter, (1805) "[https://books.google.com/books?id=WItJAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA119 A Geographical Sketch of Assam]" in Asiatic Annual Register, reprinted {{harv|Sharma|1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the Kamrup region, the Borphukan's domain included the additional region to the east up to Kaliabor.  The Koch prince that oversaw Darrang, too, reported to the Borphukan.  The Ahoms did not impose their administrative system fully over Kamrup, and the resultant ''pargana''-based system was a mixed Mughal-Ahom system, in contrast to the [[Paik system]] in the rest of the kingdom in the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gogoi|2002|p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kamrup/Burmese empire (1821-1824)===
The region became part of Burmese empire between 1821 and 1824.

==Colonial Kamrup (1833-1947)==
The region came under Burmese control in 1822. The British, in control over the region to the west of the Manas river since the transfer of Bengal in 1765, marched into Guwahati on 28 March 1824 at the beginning of the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]] and established administrative control by October.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bannerjee|1992|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Undivided Kamrup district|Kamrup district]] that the British constituted in 1833/1836 was largely congruous to the Mughal Sarkar Kamrup of 1639.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Banerjee|1992|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IIT Guwahati guesthouse as viewed from hill top.jpg|right|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;[[Indian Institute of Technology]], [[North Guwahati]]&lt;/center&gt;]]

==Modern Kamrup==
After Indian Independence in 1947, the Kamrup district maintained its form.  The district was divided, beginning in 1983, and the original district is often called "Undivided Kamrup district". The Kamapitha, Sarkar Kamrup of 1639 and the Undivided Kamrup district from the Colonial as well as the Independent periods is today defined as the Kamrup.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32177">'''Leaderless resistance''', or '''phantom cell''' structure, is a [[Rebellion|social resistance]] [[strategy]] in which small, independent groups ([[Clandestine cell system|covert cells]]), or individuals (a solo cell is called a "[[Lone wolf (terrorism)|Lone Wolf]]"), challenge an established institution such as a law, economic system, social order, or government. Leaderless resistance can encompass anything from [[nonviolence|non-violent]] protest and [[civil disobedience]] to [[vandalism]], [[terrorism]], and other violent activity.

Leaderless cells lack vertical command links and so operate without hierarchical command,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Simson Garfinkel]] | title = Leaderless resistance today | url = http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1040| work=First Monday| volume= 8| issue= 3|date=3 March 2003| accessdate = May 7, 2006 |doi=10.5210/fm.v8i3.1040}}&lt;/ref&gt; but they have a common goal that links them to the social movement from which their ideology was learned.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;Joosse, Paul. 2007. "Leaderless Resistance and Ideological Inclusion: the Case of the Earth Liberation Front. Terrorism and Political Violence 19(3): 351-368. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09546550701424042?journalCode=ftpv20&lt;/ref&gt;

Leaderless resistance is simple and difficult to stamp out. It has been employed by a wide range of movements, including [[animal-liberation movement|animal-liberation]], [[radical environmentalist movements|radical environmentalist]], [[Pro-life movement|anti-abortion]], military [[invasion]] resistance, [[colonialism]] resistance, [[terrorism|terrorist]], and [[hate group]]s.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;

==General characteristics==
A covert cell may be a lone individual or a small group. The basic characteristic of the structure is that there is no explicit communication between cells that are acting toward shared goals. Members of one cell usually have little or no information about who else is agitating on behalf of their cause.

Leaderless movements may have a symbolic figurehead. This can be a public figure, a [[multiple-use name]], or an inspirational author, who picks generic targets and objectives, but does not actually manage or execute plans. [[Mass media|Media]], in this case, often create a [[positive feedback loop]]: by publishing declarations of a movement’s role model, this instills motivation, ideas, and assumed sympathy in the minds of potential agitators who in turn lend further authority to the figurehead.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} While this may loosely resemble a vertical command structure, it is notably unidirectional: a titular leader makes pronouncements, and activists may respond, but there is no formal contact between the two levels of organization.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;

As a result, leaderless resistance cells are resistant to [[informant]]s and [[traitor]]s. As there is neither a center that may be destroyed, nor links between the cells that may be infiltrated, it is more difficult for established authorities to arrest the development of a leaderless resistance movement than it is with movements that adopt more conventional hierarchies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Given {{clarify|date=July 2018|reason=what's asymmetrical about it? asymmetrical with respect to what?|text=the asymmetrical character}} of leaderless resistance, and the fact that it is often strategically adopted in the face of a power imbalance, it has much in common with [[guerrilla warfare]]. The latter strategy, however, usually retains some form of organized, bidirectional leadership and is often more {{clarify|date=July 2018|reason=what does this mean?|text=broad-based}} than the individualized actions of leaderless cells. In some cases, a largely leaderless movement may evolve into a coherent [[insurgency]] or guerrilla movement, as with the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Yugoslav partisans]] of [[World War II]].&lt;!-- In the same conflict, the [[United Kingdom|British]] leadership had extensive plans for the use of such resistance in the event of a successful [[Operation Sealion|German invasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=British Resistance Organisation |title=History |url=http://www.parhamairfieldmuseum.co.uk/brohistory.html |publisher=parhamairfieldmuseum.co.uk |accessdate=May 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050315030541/http://www.parhamairfieldmuseum.co.uk/brohistory.html |archivedate=March 15, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {trivia that doesn't relate to the main topic}--&gt;

Leaderless resistance often involves resistance by violent means, but it is not limited to them. Non-violent groups can use the same structure to author, print, and distribute [[samizdat]] literature, to create self-propagating [[boycotts]] against political opponents via the internet, to maintain an alternative [[Digital currency|electronic currency]] outside of the reach of taxing governments and transaction-logging banks, and so forth.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul. 2012. "Elves, Environmentalism, and 'Eco-terror'" Crime Media Culture 8(1): 75-93. http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1741659011433366&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
The concept of leaderless resistance was developed by Col. [[Ulius Louis Amoss]], a former [[United States Intelligence Community|U.S. intelligence]] officer, in the early 1960s. An [[anti-communist]], Amoss saw leaderless resistance as a way to prevent the penetration and destruction of CIA-supported resistance cells in Eastern European countries under Soviet control.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150626193618/http://www.defendingdissent.org/fame/index.php?title=Leaderless_Resistance:_Amoss_Version_1953-1962] Amoss as cited in Defending Dissent Foundation Study Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept was revived and popularized in an essay published by the anti-government [[Ku Klux Klan]] member [[Louis Beam]] in 1983 and again in 1992. Beam advocated leaderless resistance as a technique for [[white nationalism|white nationalists]] to continue the struggle against the [[Federal Government of the United States|U.S. government]], despite an overwhelming imbalance in power and resources.

Beam argued that conventional [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] pyramidal organizations are extremely dangerous for their participants, when employed in a resistance movement against government, because of the ease of disclosing the [[chain of command]]. A less dangerous approach would be to convince like-minded individuals to form independent cells without close communication between each other but generally operating in the same direction.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hornebeagles.jpg|right|thumb|An [[Animal Liberation Front|ALF]] raid removing 82 beagles and 26 rabbits from [[Harlan (company)|Interfauna]] in Cambridge on [[Saint Patrick|St Patrick's Night]] 1990.&lt;ref name=Arkangel&gt;[http://www.directaction.info/barry/barry.htm "The man, the activist"], first published in ''[[Arkangel (magazine)|Arkangel]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt;
The first recorded [[direct action]] for [[animal liberation movement|animal liberation]] which progressed (after a considerable delay) into a movement of leaderless resistance was by the original "Band of Mercy" in 1824 whose goal was to thwart [[fox hunters]].&lt;ref name=Best&gt;Best &amp; Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters'', Lantern Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by this group and after seeing a pregnant deer driven into the village by fox hunters to be killed, John Prestige decided to actively oppose this sport and formed the [[Hunt Saboteurs Association]] (HSA) in 1964. Within a year, a leaderless model of hunt-sabotage groups was formed across the country.&lt;ref name=Best/&gt;

A new [[Band of Mercy]] was then formed in 1972. It used direct action to liberate animals and cause economic sabotage against those thought to be abusing animals. [[Ronnie Lee]] and others changed the name of the movement to the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF) in 1976 and adopted a leaderless resistance model focusing broadly on animal liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Webb, Robin. "Animal Liberation — By 'Whatever Means Necessary'," in Best &amp; Nocella (eds), ''Terrorists or Freedom Fighters, Lantern Books, 2004, p. 77.''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Earth First!]] and the [[environmental movement]] in the 1980s also adopted the leaderless resistance model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Southern Poverty Law Center | title = From Push to Shove | url = http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 | accessdate = May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An animal liberation movement advocating violence emerged with the name [[Animal Rights Militia]] (ARM) in 1982. Letter bombs were sent{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} to the then [[British Prime Minister]], [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Two years later the name Hunt Retribution Squad (HRS) was also used.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter.

The [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) formed in 1992, breaking from Earth First! when that organization decided to focus on public direct action, instead of the [[ecotage]] that the ELF participated in,&lt;ref&gt;Alleyne, Richard. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/01/19/ncam119.xml "Terror tactics that brought a company to its knees"], ''The Daily Telegraph'', January 19, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;. A [[violent]] group called the [[Justice Department (animal rights group)|Justice Department]] was established in 1993, and in 1994 {{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=this sounds threatening, but without more information, it's vague. Amazon.com sends razor blades to people, but it doesn't make the papers.|text=sent razor blades}} to hunters such as [[Prince Charles]] and to [[animal research]]ers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/902751.stm "Animal rights, terror tactics"], ''BBC News'', 30 August 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=42 "From push to shove"], ''Southern Poverty Law Group Intelligence Report'', Fall 2002, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 the leaderless resistance strategy was employed by animal liberation organisations like [[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty]] (SHAC), which was formed from the [[Consort beagles]] campaign and [[Save the Hill Grove Cats]] to close down [[Huntingdon Life Sciences]] (HLS). Despite claiming successes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shac.net/MISC/quantum Quantum Analytics: Drop HLS], ''[[Stop Huntingdon Animal Cruelty|SHAC]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; leaderless animal liberation and environmental movements generally lack the broad popular support that often occurs in strictly political or military conflicts.{{cite needed|date=July 2018}} The [[Revolutionary Cells (RCALB)|Revolutionary Cells--Animal Liberation Brigade]] (RCALB) appeared in 2003 and sent pipe bombs to [[Chiron Corporation]] and used [[incendiary device]]s against other targets{{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=It's unclear what the significance of this is to the page topic.|text=, whilst a year later on the south coast of [[Dorset]], the [[Lobster Liberation Front]] (LLF) was founded}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/hampshire/dorset/3939111.stm "Activists' 'war' to save lobsters"], ''BBC News'', July 30, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a few years of the victories claimed by the SHAC, other campaigns against animal testing laboratories emerged.

===Islamists===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}
Leaderless resistance is also often well-suited to terrorist objectives. The [[Islamist terrorism|Islamist]] organization [[Al-Qaeda]] uses a typical figurehead/leaderless cell structure. The organization itself may be pyramidal, but sympathizers who act on its pronouncements often do so spontaneously and independently.

Given the small, clandestine character of terrorist cells, it is easy to assume they necessarily constitute leaderless resistance models. When there is bidirectional communication with external leadership, however, the label is inappropriate. The men who executed the bombings of the [[London Underground]] on July 7, 2005 constituted a leaderless resistance cell in that they purportedly acted out of sympathy for [[Islamic fundamentalism]] but under their own auspices. The hijackers involved in the [[September 11 attacks]], by contrast, allegedly received training, direction, and funding from Al-Qaeda, and are not properly designated a leaderless cell.

===Neo-Nazis===
The concept of leaderless resistance remains important to much far right thinking in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Paul de Armond | title = Putting the Far Right into Perspective | url = http://www.publicgood.org/reports/spectrum/ | accessdate = May 7, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a proposed response to perceived federal government over-reach at the expense of individual rights. {{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=Garfinkel has yet to be introduced. Who is he?|text=Garfinkel }}, however, found in his research that for the most part the far right seldom used this tactic,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}. [[Timothy McVeigh]] is one example in the [[United States]]. McVeigh worked in a small cell which based its attack on motivations widespread among far-right anti-government groups and the militia movement.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Leaderless resistance has been advocated by White Supremacist groups such as [[White Aryan Resistance]] and the British neo-Nazi [[Combat 18]]. The modern [[Ku Klux Klan]] is also credited with having developed a leaderless resistance model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = University of Michigan | title = Right-Wing Domestic Terrorism | url = http://www-personal.umich.edu/~lormand/agenda/9909/06.pdf | accessdate = May 7, 2006 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Troy Southgate]] also advocated forms of leaderless resistance during his time as a leading activist in the [[National Revolutionary Faction]] and a pioneer of [[National-Anarchism]].

===Radical environmentalism===
{{Main article|Radical environmentalism}}
:''Further information: [[Ecotage]], [[Eco-terrorism]], and [[Earth liberation]]''
Leaderless resistance emerged in the environmental movement in 1976 when [[John Hanna (activist)|John Hanna]] and others as the [[Environmental Life Force]] (ELF) (also known now as the ''original ELF'') used explosive and [[incendiary device]]s. The group conducted armed actions in northern [[California]] and [[Oregon]], later disbanding in 1978 following Hanna's arrest for placing incendiary devices on seven crop-dusters at the [[Salinas, California]] airport on [[May Day]], 1977.&lt;ref name=elf&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.originalelf.org/ |title=Original ELF |access-date=2018-12-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415040756/http://www.originalelf.org/ |archive-date=2012-04-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A decade and a half later this form of [[guerrilla warfare]] resurfaced using the same [[acronym]].
[[Image:Earthfirstmonkeywrench.png|thumb|right|180px|The symbol of [[Earth First!]]: a Monkey wrench and stone hammer.]]

In 1980 [[Earth First!]] was founded by [[Dave Foreman]] and others to confront environmental destruction, primarily of the American West. Inspired by the [[Edward Abbey]] novel ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]'', Earth First! made use of such techniques as [[treesitting]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.penbay.org/ef/treesit_first1985.html Earth First's first treesitting civil disobedience action] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016222643/http://www.penbay.org/ef/treesit_first1985.html |date=2005-10-16 }}, ''Earth First! 1985'', Oregon, June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[treespiking]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.things.org/~jym/ef/tree-spiking-memo.html Tree Spiking Memo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424015446/http://www.things.org/~jym/ef/tree-spiking-memo.html |date=2008-04-24 }}, ''Earth First!'', April 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; to stop [[logging]] companies, as well as other activities targeted towards [[mining]], [[road]] construction,&lt;ref name="wall"&gt;{{cite book | title = Earth First! and the Anti-Roads Movement: Radical Environmentalism and Comparative Social Movements | last = Wall | first = Derek | year = 1999 | publisher = Routledge }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[suburb]]an development, and [[Energy development|energy companies]].

The organization was committed to nonviolent [[ecotage]] techniques from the group's inception. Others split from the movement in the 1990s, including the [[Earth Liberation Front]] (ELF) in 1992, which named itself after the [[Animal Liberation Front]] (ALF) which had formed in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenfield.fortunecity.com/tree/16/fire.html ELF Burns Down Vail] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211235040/http://greenfield.fortunecity.com/tree/16/fire.html |date=2006-02-11 }}, ''FIRE'', December 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later in [[Canada]], inspired by the ELF in [[Europe]], the first ''Earth Liberation'' [[direct action]] occurred, but this time as the [[Earth Liberation Army]] (ELA), a similar movement who use ecotage and [[monkeywrenching]] as a tool.

A series of actions earned ELF the label of [[eco-terrorism|eco-terrorists]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://prfamerica.org/EarthLiberationFrontNo1onFBIList.html Earth Liberation Front is now FBI's No. 1 Domestic Terrorist Threat], ''Property Rights of America Foundation Inc'', March 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthliberationfront.com/elf_news.htm ELF News], ''Earth Liberation Front''&lt;/ref&gt; including the burning of a [[ski]] resort in [[Vail, Colorado]] in 1998, and the burning of an [[SUV]] dealership in [[Oregon]] in 1999. In the same year the ELA made headlines by setting fire to the [[Vail Resorts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], causing $12 million in damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_36_15/ai_56063251 waste &amp; abuse - controversy over a temporary dirt road built by Vail Resortsand its effect on wetlands] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925184013/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_36_15/ai_56063251 |date=2008-09-25 }}, ''BNet'', September 27th 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The defendants in that case were later charged in the [[FBI]]'s "[[Operation Backfire (FBI)|Operation Backfire]]" with other crimes; this was later named by environmentalists as the [[Green Scare]], alluding to the [[Red Scare]] periods of fear over communist infiltration of U.S.&lt;ref name=opb&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan06/elf012006.htm Eco-Terror Indictments: "Operation Backfire" Nets 11] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100817222138/http://www.fbi.gov/page2/jan06/elf012006.htm |date=2010-08-17 }}, [[FBI]], January 20th 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedom4um.com/cgi-bin/readart.cgi?ArtNum=69570 Resentencing date set for Jeff Luers], ''Freedom4um'', 29 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] several laws were passed{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} increasing the penalty for ecoterrorism, and the U.S. Congress held hearings on the activity of groups such as the ELF. To date no one has been killed as a result of an ELF or ALF action, and both groups forbid harming human or non-human life.&lt;ref name=rel&gt;[[Bron Taylor]], 1998.

===Anti-abortion militancy===
Anti-abortion [[Militant (word)|militants]] [[Army of God (USA)|The Army of God]] use leaderless resistance as their organizing principle.

===Network analysis in classical setting===
Leaderless resistance [[social network]]s are potentially vulnerable to [[social network analysis]] and its derivative, [[link analysis]]. Link analysis of social networks is the fundamental reason for the ongoing legislative push in the U.S. and the European Union &lt;!-- and elsewhere (where?) --&gt; for mandatory [[Telecommunications data retention|retention of telecommunication traffic data]] and for limiting access to [[Anonymity|anonymous]] [[Prepaid mobile phone|prepaid]] [[Mobile phone|cellphones]], as the stored data contain important network analysis clues.{{cite needed|date=July 2018}}
{{See also|MAINWAY}}

Network analysis was successfully used by French Colonel [[Yves Godard (French officer)|Yves Godard]] to break the [[Nationalism and resistance in Algeria|Algerian resistance]] between 1955 and 1957 and force them to cease their [[bombing]] campaigns. The Algerian conflict may be better described as guerrilla in nature rather than leaderless resistance (see ''Modern Warfare'' by Col. Roger Trinquier), and this illustrates the weakness of cell-structured insurgents when compared to leaderless ones. {{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=What is mapping data? This term has not been explained.|text= The mapping data}} were obtained{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} by the use of [[informant]]s and [[torture]] and were used{{by whom?|date=July 2018}} to obtain the identities of important individuals in the resistance; these individuals were then [[assassination|assassinated]]{{by whom?|date=July 2018}}, which disrupted the Algerian resistance networks. The more irreplaceable the individual is in the adversary's network, the greater the damage is done to the network by removing them.

===Advantages for leaderless resistance===
Traditional organizations leave behind much evidence of their activities, such as money trails, and training and recruitment material. Leaderless resistances, supported more by [[ideology|ideologies]] than organizations, generally lack such traces. The effects of their operations, as reported by the [[mass media]], act as a sort of messaging and recruitment advertising.

{{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=Who is Paul Joosse and why is he an authority?|text=Paul Joosse}} argues that leaderless resistance movements can avoid the ideological disputes and infighting that plague radical groups. They do this by {{clarify |date=July 2018 |reason=It's unclear what this means.|text=limiting interaction to the virtual realm}}.&lt;ref&gt;Joosse, Paul. 2007.  "Leaderless Resistance and Ideological Inclusion" Terrorism and Political Violence 19(3): 351-368. http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09546550701424042?journalCode=ftpv20&lt;/ref&gt;

The internet provides counterinsurgents with further challenges. Individual cells (and even a single person can be a cell) can communicate over the internet, anonymously or semi-anonymously sharing information online, to be found by others through well-known websites. Even when it is legally and technically possible to ascertain who accessed what, it is often practically impossible to discern in a reasonable timeframe who is a real threat and who is just curious, a journalist, or a [[web crawler]].

Despite these advantages, leaderless resistance is often unstable.{{cite needed|date=July 2018}} If the actions are not frequent enough or not successful, the stream of publicity, which serves as the recruiting, motivation, and coordination drives for other cells, diminishes. On the other hand, if the actions are too successful, [[support group]]s and other [[social structure]]s will form that are vulnerable to network analysis.

A '''revived language''' is one that, having experienced near or complete extinction as either a spoken or written language, has been intentionally [[Language revitalization|revived]] and has regained some of its former status.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The most frequent reason for extinction is the marginalisation of local languages within a wider dominant [[nation state]], which might at times amount to outright political oppression. This process normally works alongside economic and cultural pressures for greater [[centralisation]] and [[assimilation (sociology)|assimilation]]. Once a language has become marginalised in this way, it is often perceived as being "useless" by its remaining speakers, who associate it with low social status and poverty, and consequently fail to pass it on to the next generation. 

The only substantial success story in the field of language revival is [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; all other cases are projects of limited success.

==Cornish==
{{Main|Cornish revival}}
[[File:Origo Mundi kynsa gwersow.jpg|thumb|right|The opening verses of ''Origo Mundi'', the first play of the [[Ordinalia]] (the ''[[masterpiece|magnum opus]]'' of medieval Cornish literature), written by an unknown monk in the late 14th century]]
[[Cornish language|Cornish]] was once spoken in the English county of [[Cornwall]] until it became extinct as a spoken language in the late 18th century. The language had been in decline since the 14th century and by the time of the death of the last fluent speakers, was only spoken in the western fringes of the county. [[Dolly Pentreath]] (d. 1777) is believed to have been the last speaker of the language. [[Cornish literature|Literature]] from the Medieval and Tudor periods, and fragments, including grammars, from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries survived, which allowed Cornish to be reconstructed by a small group of Celtic enthusiasts in the 20th century as part of the [[Celtic Revival]]. These Cornish language revivalists borrowed heavily from Welsh and Breton in order to aid in the creation of the modern Cornish language. The reconstruction of the language was known for disputes over orthography during the late 20th century, until a [[Standard Written Form]] was agreed upon in 2008. The number of Cornish speakers is difficult to estimate, but it is believed that some 500 individuals have a degree of fluency in the language. The language is now taught in some schools in Cornwall. UNESCO recently reclassified the language from "extinct" to "critically endangered".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-11935464|title=BBC News - Cornish language no longer extinct, says UN|work=BBC News|accessdate=14 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dalmatian==
{{Main|Dalmatian language}}
The Dalmatian language was spoken in [[Dalmatia]], a coastal region of [[Croatia]], in the [[Middle Ages]]. Its last known native speaker was [[Tuone Udaina|Antonio Tuone Udaina]], who died on June 10, 1898, as the result of an explosion. The Dalmatian language is being revived by pro-autonomist Dalmatian activists, and today is estimated that there are about 20 fluent Dalmatian speakers and more than one hundred people with some knowledge of the language.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160629055742/http://langadalmot.webs.com/ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hawaiian==
{{Main|Hawaiian language}}
On six of the seven inhabited islands of [[Hawaii]], Hawaiian was displaced by English and is no longer used as the daily language of communication. The one exception is [[Niihau|Niʻihau]], where [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] has never been displaced, has never been endangered, and is still used almost exclusively. Native speakers of Niʻihau Hawaiian speak among themselves in a way significantly different from the Hawaiian of the other islands&amp;mdash;so different that it can be difficult for non-Niʻihau speakers of Hawaiian to understand. The most marked difference between Niiahauan and Hawaiian is that the Hawaiian K sound is often replaced with a T sound in Niihauan.

Efforts to revive the language have increased in recent decades. Hawaiian [[language immersion]] schools are now open to children whose families want to retain (or introduce) Hawaiian language into the next generation. The local [[National Public Radio|NPR]] station features a short segment titled "Hawaiian word of the day". Additionally, the Sunday editions of the ''[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]]'' feature a brief article called ''Kauakukalahale'', written entirely in Hawaiian by a student.

==Hebrew==
{{Main|Revival of the Hebrew language|Modern Hebrew}}

[[File:HavivSchool03.jpg|thumb|250px|First Hebrew school in Rishon Lezion]]

[[Hebrew]] was revived as a spoken language two millennia after it ceased to be spoken (although it was always used as a written language), and is considered a language revival "success story". Although used in liturgy,  and to a limited extent commerce,  it was extinct as a language used in everyday life until its revival,  considered impractically archaic or too sacred for day-to-day communication, although it was, in fact, used as an international language between Jews who had no other common tongue, with several Hebrew-medium newspapers in circulation around Europe at the beginning of the 19th century, and a number of Zionist conferences being conducted exclusively in Hebrew. Starting in the late 19th century,  it was revived as an everyday spoken language as part of the emerging Zionist movement. [[Eliezer Ben-Yehuda]] largely spearheaded the revival efforts, and his son [[Itamar Ben-Avi]] was raised as the first native Hebrew speaker since Hebrew's extinction as an everyday language. Hebrew is now the primary official language of [[Israel]],  and the most commonly spoken language there. It is spoken by over 9,000,000 people today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=8065 |title=A million and a half Israelis struggle with Hebrew |website=Israelhayom.com |accessdate=2017-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them live in Israel or are Israeli expatriates, but many in [[Judaism|Jewish]] communities outside Israel have undertaken its study.

==Kaurna==
{{Main|Kaurna language}}

[[Kaurna language|Kaurna]] is an [[Australian Aboriginal languages|Australian Aboriginal language]] of the [[Kaurna people]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]], Australia. It is currently being revived by the [[Kaurna Warra Pintyandi]], a committee of Kaurna Elders and youth, teachers, linguists and other researchers based at the [[University of Adelaide]].

==Latin==
{{main|Contemporary Latin}}
[[File:Vatican latin atm.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Latin in use on an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]].]]

[[Latin]] was historically the language of the [[Roman Empire]], but spread through Europe and beyond, thanks partially to its role in the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and in higher register.

Feature films and broadcasting have been conducted in Latin. Two notable examples include 1976's ''[[Sebastiane]]'' by [[Derek Jarman]] and Paul Humfress, and [[Mel Gibson]]'s ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (which also contains long sections in Aramaic). [[Harry Potter]] has even been translated into Latin and [[ancient Greek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~loxias/harry_potter.htm|title=Harry Potter in Greek|last=Wilson |first=Andrew|year=2006|publisher=Andrew Wilson |accessdate=28 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somewhat like Sanskrit, Hebrew, Maori and Manx, Latin has never been entirely out of view, and has always had some speakers, but a lack of native speakers.

==Lazuri (Laz)==
{{Main|Laz language}}
The UNESCO Atlas of the World’s Languages in Danger (2010) declares Lazuri as a language that is definitively endangered. Lazuri is a Southwest Caucasian language spoken by ca. 30,000 people as their mother tongue along the East Black Sea coast of Turkey and in some parts of the Autonomous Republic of [[Adjara]] (Salminen, 2007).  The region where the Lazi people live is called Lazona (Benninghaus, 1989). Because Lazuri is primarily an oral language, and all new speakers tend to grow up bilingual (typically speaking Lazuri and Turkish), the language is at risk of extinction (e.g., Yuksel-Sokmen &amp; Chasin, 2008). Although the Lazuri alphabet was first established around the late 20s by a native folklorist, named Iskender Tsitasi, who published periodicals and poems until 1938, there were many obstacles to learn and to teach Lazuri due to the lack of language learning resources and limited documentation of the language (interview with language activist [[:tr:İsmail Avcı Bucaklişi|İsmail Avcı Bucaklişi]] in Istanbul, April 2012). Hence, Lazuri remained a primary spoken language until Lazoglu and Feuerstein re-introduced the Lazuri Alboni or Alphabet in Latin letters in 1984 and started to publish periodicals, called 'Ogni' (“Did you hear”). The first Lazuri Dictionary (Bucaklişi &amp; Uzunhasanoğlu, 2006) was among the first one to adopt the Lazuri Alboni. ''The Little Prince'' by Antoine de Saint-Exupery become the first book which has been formally translated into the Lazuri Alboni by Sinan Albayrakoğlu (2011) who worked four years on the Turkish to Lazuri translation. Also, in 2011 the Bosphorus University of Istanbul started to offer Lazuri as an elective class for beginners. With the recent establishment of the Lazika Yayin Kolektif (Lazika Publication Collective) in 2010, current and future generations of students, teachers, authors, and scholars of Lazuri are encouraged to contribute to the process of language revitalization, thus paving the way for a Lazuri literature.

==Livonian==
[[Livonian language|Livonian]] is a Finnic language spoken in [[Latvia]].  It is one of the three languages (along with Manx and Cornish) listed as revived by the UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger''.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leonese==
{{Main|Leonese language}}

Leonese was recognised as a seriously endangered language by UNESCO, in 2006. The only legal reference to this language is in the [[Castile and León#Languages|Autonomy Statute of Castile and León]]. The Province of León government supports the knowledge of this language through courses, by celebrating "Leonese Language Day" and by sponsoring literary efforts in the Leonese language, such as "Cuentos del Sil", where nine writers from teenagers to people in their eighties develop several stories in Leonese. The Leonese Local Government uses the Leonese language in some of their bureaus, organizes courses for adults and in 2007 organized Leonese Language Day. The Leonese Local Government official website uses the Leonese language. The Leonese language is taught in two schools of León city since February 2008. The local authority for education said it would be taught in all Leonese schools next course.

==Manx==
{{Main|Manx language}}
[[File:Manx-museum.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Use of Manx on the national museum; note the smaller font size of the Manx.]]

Manx is a language spoken in the [[Isle of Man]], which is in the [[Irish Sea]], between Scotland, England, Ireland and Wales. Manx ceased to function as a community language during the first quarter of the 20th century, but was revived by enthusiasts at a time when there were still a number of native speakers alive. Although at one point no native speakers of the language were alive and it may have been officially classified as "dead" in 1975, the revival appears to have gained strength in recent years. There is a regular programme in Manx on [[Manx Radio]]. As of 2012 there were sixty-nine pupils undergoing their education through the medium of Manx at the {{lang|gv|[[Bunscoill Ghaelgagh]]}}.

==Palawa kani==
{{main|Palawa kani}}

Palawa kani is an attempt to revive various Tasmanian dialects in a single combined form.

The original [[Tasmanian languages]], which may have number a dozen or more, became extinct in 1905 when the last native speaker died. As part of community efforts to retrieve as much of the original Tasmanian culture as possible, efforts are made to (re)construct a language for the indigenous community. Due to the scarcity of records, Palawa kani is being constructed as a composite of the estimated 6 to 12 original languages.

Theresa Sainty and Jenny Longey were the first two "language workers" to work on the project in 1999.

==Sanskrit==
[[File:Agni and Prithvi.jpg|left|thumb|200px|A revived language being put to another use: the [[Agni]] and [[Prithvi]] missiles of India.]]
{{main|Sanskrit revival}}
[[Sanskrit]] was a pan-South Asian and Southeast Asian (reaching as far as the Philippines) language  in [[Vedic]] times but lost its prominent place among spoken dialects in modern India. A number of attempts to revive Sanskrit have been made from the 18th century onward. However, it has been challenged in this role by various community languages, [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Urdu]] and [[English language|English]].

Many of India's, Nepal's and Sri Lanka's scientific and administrative terms are named in Sanskrit, as a counterpart of the western practice of naming scientific developments in [[Latin]] or [[Classical Greek]]. Many Nepalese names of people and places have derived from Sanskrit which is why it is so important in the history of the Nepali language. The [[Integrated Guided Missile Development Program|Indian guided missile program]] that was commenced in 1983 by [[DRDO]] has named the five missiles (ballistic and others) that it has developed as [[Prithvi missile|Prithvi]], [[Agni missile system|Agni]], [[Akash missile|Akash]], [[Nag missile|Nag]] and [[Trishul missile|Trishul]] ('Akash', 'Nag' and 'Trishul' are, however, Hindi; though written the same in the [[Devanagari]] script, these three words in Sanskrit are - for transliteration - 'Akasha', 'Naga', and 'Trishula'). India's first modern fighter [[aircraft]] is named [[HAL Tejas]].

[[Neo-Sanskrit]] is spoken in around four villages in India. The [[Mattur]] village in central [[Karnataka]], Shimoga district claims to have native speakers of Sanskrit among its population. Historically the village was given by King [[Krishnadevaraya]] of the [[Vijayanagara Empire]] to Vedic scholars and their families. People in his kingdom spoke [[Kannada]] and [[Telugu language|Telugu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-08-13/india/27856220_1_sanskrit-vedic-scholar-kysar-khan This village speaks gods language] 13 Aug 2005 [[Times of India]] Retrieved on September 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samskrita Bharati]] ({{lang-sa|संस्कृतभारती}}, {{IPA-sa|sə̃skr̩təbʱɑːrətiː|IPA}}) is a [[non-profit organization]] working to [[language revitalization|revive]] Sanskrit, also termed Sanskrit revival.  The organization has its headquarters in [[New Delhi]], and [[United States|U.S.]] chapter headquarters in [[San Jose, California]].  The Samskrita Bharati office in [[Bangalore]] is called "Aksharam" and houses a research wing, library, publication division, and audio-visual language lab for teaching spoken Sanskrit.

'''''Luna''''' was a British children's [[science fiction]] TV comedy show produced by [[ITV Central|Central Television]] for the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] network which ran for two series in 1983 and 1984. The first series was recorded at the former ATV studios in Elstree, the second at their [[Nottingham]] facility.

==Premise==
''Luna'' was also the name used by the show's central character, played by [[Patsy Kensit]] (1st series) and by [[Jo Wyatt]] (2nd series). ''Luna'' was co-written by [[Colin Prockter]] and [[Colin Bennett (UK TV)|Colin Bennett]]; Bennett also acted in it. The show was created and produced by [[Micky Dolenz]] of the pop group [[the Monkees]]. The character 80H was played by Roy Macready&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb name|id=0534321|name=Roy Macready}}&lt;/ref&gt; and U2 by [[Bob Goody]].&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb name|id=0329586|name=Bob Goody}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was about the domestic life of an eccentric family group set in the year 2040 - although in the setting the characters are not in fact biologically related but assigned to shared living quarters by the bureaucracy. Parts of the setting were decidedly [[dystopic]]; in the first episode, Luna is threatened with execution for having lost her citizen's identity card.

A distinctive feature of the show was the language of "techno-talk", used by all of the characters and described as an alternate version of English that had emerged to make it easier for computers to understand human speech. Techno-talk was characterised by the formation of new words from stems that already existed in regular spoken English. It also had echoes of [[George Orwell]]'s [[Newspeak]], albeit that it had been created for a different purpose. For example, the characters live in a "habiviron" (from ''habitat'' and ''environment''); similarly, school is "eduviron"; a child is a "diminibeing" (abbreviated to "dimini") and "regrets!" and "gratitudes!" replace "sorry" and "thank you".

The first season was repeated in the weeks immediately prior the broadcast of the second season, but the programme has not been repeated since then. The entire series has not been [[wiped]] and still exists in archive, which is unusual for older children's shows in the UK.

==Characters==
*Luna (Season 1: 72-batch-19Y) - a female "diminibeing" (actually two different characters - the habiviron is assigned a new diminifemale in season two, but she adopts the same name as her predecessor).  Luna is kind and demure; having been raised in a "dimini colony", she knows very little about the old world but is curious to learn about it and keen to fit in with the others.  Andy likes her for the "civilising influence" she brings to the habiviron.  Luna was given her name by Andy, because she asked for one; Andy chose it because she was "batched" on the moon.
*Brat (3G-batch-19Y) - a geeky male diminibeing.  Brat is younger than Luna, and extremely intelligent and technical; he can fix most of the machines in the habiviron if necessary.  Unfortunately, he is also extremely spoiled and selfish; he has made attempts to have both Andy and Luna replaced (Andy with a newer model android and Luna with a male diminibeing).  He is also ignorant about the old world, but unlike Luna, he actively refuses to learn about it or co-operate with the adults; he even persistently insists on using code numbers to identify the other characters (calling Luna "72" and Andy "CB").  Brat was given his name by Gramps during one of their arguments; neither he nor Luna actually knows what the word means.
*Gramps (WB1889U) - an aging punk, and the original inhabitant of Habiviron Jo-Y.  He grew up in the old world and often has difficulty understanding the other characters' use of techno-talk, which he hardly ever uses himself (Andy generally translates for him).  He does not particularly like having to share his habiviron with diminibeings, but tolerates them regardless.  He has a large stash of old world artifacts (such as teapots, rubik cubes, Monopoly games, etc.) in his bedroom, which are now considered illegal.  He never uses code numbers, and cannot even remember his own; he introduces himself to Brat and Luna as "Gramps".
*Andy (CB1979D) - the habiviron's malfunction-prone android.  Andy is an outdated model of android; the habiviron is entitled to receive a newer one, but Gramps keeps Andy around since he knows Andy will tolerate his "inefficient" ways.  Andy is familiar with the old world, and frequently quotes from Shakespeare or other historical literature, which most of the other characters (even Gramps) don't recognize.  Andy was given his name by Gramps, because he is an android; he also uses the name "CB".
*Mother (1984726SD) - the habiviron's computer, who runs all the standard functions of the habiviron and keeps Andy charged.  Mother is Andy's nickname for her, she hates it.
*Jazzmine - Luna's alien pet; a "little simple" (from the planet Sim).  Luna rescued Jazzmine from mistreatment at the hands of a travelling junk trader.  Although unable to speak, Jazzmine can perform some complex tasks, and has healing powers.
*80H - the sector "bureaubeing".  80H is in charge of the whole sector, including resource allocation and law enforcement, and has ultimate power (including the power of life and death) over every being in the sector.  He's addressed as "your burificence" and his arrival at the habiviron is always proceeded by a fanfare provided by Mother; he wears a shiny black suit with a black full-face helmet and speaks in a harsh ring-modulated voice.  Underneath the helmet, though, is a regular, balding and stressed-out office worker; he finds the helmet uncomfortable and only wears it when required by official business.  80H is in fact quite kindly (albeit somewhat of a [[jobsworth]]) and, like most of the adult characters, remembers and has a certain amount of affection for the old world; unfortunately, the demands of his employers ("the central bureaubureau") often conflict with this.  Many of the other adult characters appear to have known him in the old world, and still use his old name ("Sid"), which he hates.
*40D - 80H's ditzy assistant (1st season).
*32C - 80H's assistant (2nd season).

==Episodes==
===Series One===
*Ep1 - ''Habiviron, Sweet Habiviron'': Brat, and later Luna, arrive at the habiviron.  Gramps is rather upset at having to share his home with children (and particularly dislikes Brat), and is already in trouble with 80H for having been caught with an old world teapot, which is now illegal to possess.  When 80H visits to check on the new arrivals, Luna finds she's lost her egothenticity card; Andy attempts to hide this from 80H, but fails and 80H tells Luna she will need to show him the card within 24 hours or be "obliviated".  Andy and Luna search for the card, but find no help: the sector's lost property officer insists that it cannot be lost because he doesn't know where it is, and the sector police suggest it may have been stolen but refuse to help because Luna cannot prove her identity (due to not having her card).  Gramps is summoned to 80H's, where he appeals to "Sid" to have one last cup of tea; 80H relents, but afterwards the illegal teapot is thrown into the obliviator.  Gramps rails angrily at the idea that 80H would do this to Luna, and 80H admits he does not relish the task, but is required to follow instructions to the letter.  Time runs out, and Luna visits 80Hs to report on this; the obliviator door is opened for her to enter, when Brat runs up, holding the card to give to 80H.  Brat reports that the card was "in the secret pouch in Luna's zipclad", but it is strongly implied that Brat stole it and later regretted this.  Luna is saved, and 80H puts the card under his chair to stop it wobbling.
*Ep2 - ''The Clunkman Cometh'': "The Clunkman", a junk merchant, visits the habiviron.  Brat plans to sell him Andy in exchange for a robot goldfish, knowing that a new android will be supplied; however, Luna intervenes to prevent this.  She is also shocked at The Clunkman's treatment of his pet alien; so much so that, after he has left, she teleports onto his ship and kidnaps the alien, naming it Jazzmine.  The Clunkman goes to visit 80H to report the missing alien; 80H is suffering from toothache, and cannot believe Luna would do such a thing, but he agrees to investigate anyway (in exchange for some contraband old world sweets).  Brat reports Jazzmine's presence at the habiviron to 80H, who tells Luna that aliens cannot legally be kept in a static habiviron and goes to get the Clunkman to pick her up.  When he arrives, Luna begs 80H to allow Jazzmine to stay, and Jazzmine uses her healing powers to cure 80H's toothache.  80H agrees that she can stay, but the Clunkman still insists that she belongs to him, and thus wants her back or else to be given something in exchange.  He initially wants Andy, but he eventually accepts one of Gramps' old world LPs.
*Ep3 - All The World's A Teletalk Linkup
*Ep4 - Happy Batch Day Dear Luna
*Ep5 - ''Environmental Ambience Stable, Wish You Were Here'': Luna is feeling bored, and Andy proposes going on holiday.  To do this the group need to get travel permits from 80H, but he is only too happy to provide them, since the Assistant Galactic Coordinator is visiting the sector for a random inspection and he is concerned he would find their habiviron "inefficient".  They arrange their plans, but 80H learns that the Coordinator will be visiting earlier than expected, and therefore gives the group permits for the earlier time, leaving their bookings unusable and no time to make earlier ones.  Gramps suggests that they could go camping instead, and Brat produces a model VW Beetle which can be converted into a full-size car for them to drive in.  Unfortunately, they then find that Jazzmin has no travel permit, and 80H cannot get her one, since technically she is not permitted to be in the habiviron at all.  40D agrees to substitute one of hers, and the group prepares to leave, only to find that car does not work; Brat had no idea that cars needed petrol, which is no longer available.  As a last resort, the group decide to camp inside the Habiviron.  The Assistant Coordinator arrives in the habiviron as part of his random inspection, and 80H nearly passes out when he sees what's going on, but in fact he's happy to join in.

Many of the episodes of Luna feature "techno talk" versions of classic or music hall songs.  These include:

* ''I belong to 3540'' ([[I Belong to Glasgow]]) and ''Maybe it's because I'm a 3540er'' ([[Maybe it's because I'm a Londoner]]), sung by the Clunkman in 1.2.
* ''I do like to be beside the Saline'' ([[I Do Like To be Beside the Seaside]]) and ''We're Porting along on a Tidal Displacement'' ([[We're Riding Along on the Crest of a Wave]]), sung by the whole group in 1.5.

The '''Madras''', also called the '''Jip''' or '''Jupe''', is the [[national costume|national dress]] of the countries of [[Dominica]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciad.org.uk/2012/05/07/adrianna-henderson-on-the-national-dress-of-dominica/|title=Adrianna Henderson on the national dress of Dominica|accessdate=17 October 2015|work=ciad.org.uk|date=7 May 2012|author=Henderson, Adrianna}}&lt;/ref&gt; , [[Saint Lucia]], and [[French West Indies]] . A traditional five piece costume it was originally derived from the Wob Dwyiet (or Wobe Dwiette), a grand robe worn by the earlier French settlers, and this garment is also recognised as a national dress of the country. The madras is the traditional  dress of the women and girls of Dominica and St. Lucia, and its name is derived from the [[Madras (cloth)|madras]] cloth, a fabric used in the costume.

==History==
The cloth, known as the madras, is named after its place of origin, [[Madras]], [[India]]. The origins of the madras lie in the pre-[[Slavery in the British and French Caribbean|emancipation]] days of St. Lucia, when African slaves on the island would don the colourful dress during feast days.&lt;ref name="Folk Research Centre"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stluciafolk.org/outfits/view/18| title=National Dress of Saint Lucia | work= Folk Research Centre | author= | date=2010 | accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the late 17th century, slaves on the island were forced to wear the [[livery]] of the estate to which they belonged.&lt;ref name="Folk Research Centre"/&gt; Normally a single colour, one piece item, originally worn as a sarong, later becoming a simple tunic with holes for the arms and head, and a simple rope belt. During Sundays and holidays, the slaves could normally wear what they wished, and through monies earned through selling produce from small plots of land, they would often buy colourful cloth. On feast days and special occasions, free women and slaves would wear the colourful clothes, now known  as "Creole dress".&lt;ref name="Folk Research Centre"/&gt;

Towards the end of the 18th century the Indian cotton known as 'muchoir madras' became popular amongst the Creole women, and eventually replaced the white cotton head kerchief. The material was soon used for scarfs and then the 'jupe' or skirt.&lt;ref name="Folk Research Centre"/&gt; With the fashion for ribbons becoming popular, women added them to the lace on the arms and the neck of their chemise. The chemise, once fashionably long, became shorter until replaced by a blouse and petticoat, but still with the threaded ribbons.&lt;ref name="Folk Research Centre"/&gt;

The madras today is almost identical to the traditional costumes worn by other former French colonies of the Caribbean, including the neighbouring islands of [[Martinique]], [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Dominica]]. In 2004 a national awareness campaign was launched by the Saint Lucian government during the 25th anniversary of the country's [[Independence of Saint Lucia|Independence]]. Both the Madras and the Wob Dwyiet, recognised as symbols of the country, were included in this campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Costume==
The Madras is made up of five individual pieces of clothing. The costume comprises a white cotton or [[poplin]] blouse, known in [[Antillean Creole|French Creole]] as a chimiz decolté or chemise decoltee, finished with [[Broderie Anglaise]] and red ribbons.&lt;ref name="UN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.un.int/stlucia/Costume.htm| title=Saint Lucia national dress| work= United Nations | author= | date= | accessdate=15 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second item is an ankle length skirt, again trimmed with lace and red ribbons; which has two gathers towards the lower end of the garment. The third item is the shorter outer skirt, made of Madras material, to which the costume is named. The Madras material is used again in the fourth item, the head piece, known as the ''Tête en l'air'' or ''tèt anlè''; a square or rectangular piece of cloth worn over the forehead and folded to display varying numbers of peaks. The head scarf can be tied in a ceremonial fashion or can be worn to show the availability of the woman in courtship,&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt; depending on the number of peaks tied into it. One peak represents that the woman is single, two that she is married, three that she is widowed or divorced, and four that she is available to any who tries.&lt;ref name="Folk Research Centre"/&gt; The final item is a triangular silk scarf, ''foulard'', pinned to the left shoulder, its apex at the end of the elbow and tucked into the waist of the skirt.&lt;ref name="UN"/&gt;

The costume is traditionally worn on Independence Day, National Day and [[Jounen Kwéyòl]] (Creole Day). It is also worn when dancing the [[Quadrille]], which has been adopted by the country as the national dance.

{{Wiktionary|mainstream}}

'''Mainstream''' is current [[thought]] that is widespread.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/mainstream American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]'', Fifth Edition (2011) (defining "mainstream" as "The prevailing current of thought, influence, or activity).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.thefreedictionary.com/prevailing American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]'', Fifth Edition (2011) (defining "prevailing" as "Generally current; widespread...").&lt;/ref&gt;  It includes all [[popular culture]] and [[media culture]], typically [[Dissemination|disseminated]] by [[mass media]]. It is to be distinguished from [[subculture]]s and  [[counterculture]]s, and at the opposite extreme are [[cult following]]s and [[fringe theories]].

This word is sometimes used in a pejorative sense by subcultures who view ostensibly mainstream culture as not only exclusive but artistically and aesthetically inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Pysnakova, Michaela.  "Understanding the Meaning of Consumption of Everyday Lives of 'Mainstream' Youth in the Czech Republic" in ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=B8IwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA64 New Perspectives on Consumer Culture Theory and Research]'', p. 64 (Pavel Zahrádka and Renáta Sedláková eds. Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[United States]], [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline]] churches are sometimes referred to synonymously as "mainstream."&lt;ref&gt;Caldwell, John. "Faith in school: as mainstream churches continue to wrestle with homosexuality, some religious colleges are taking an increasingly welcoming attitude toward gay students", ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' Sept 2, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baer, Hans A. "Black Mainstream Churches; Emancipatory or Accommodative Responses to Racism and Social Stratification in American Society?" ''Review of Religious Research'' Vol. 30, No. 2 (Dec., 1988), pp. 162-176&lt;/ref&gt;

== In the media ==
{{main|Mainstream media|Mass media}}
The labels "Mainstream media", or "mass media", are generally applied to print publications, such as newspapers and magazines that contain the highest readership among the public, and to [[radio format]]s and television stations that contain the highest viewing and listener audience, respectively. This is in contrast to various [[independent media]], such as [[alternative media]] newspapers, specialized magazines in various organizations and corporations, and various electronic sources such as [[podcasts]] and [[blogs]] (Though certain blogs are more mainstream than others given their association with a mainstream source.&lt;ref&gt;Wallsten, K. (2007), Agenda Setting and the Blogosphere: An Analysis of the Relationship between Mainstream Media and Political Blogs. Review of Policy Research, 24: 567–587. doi: 10.1111/j.1541-1338.2007.00300.x&lt;/ref&gt;

== In science ==

Mainstream science is [[scientific inquiry]] in an established [[field of study]] that does not depart significantly from  [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] [[theory|theories]].  In the [[philosophy of science]], mainstream science is an area of scientific endeavor that has left the process of becoming established. New areas of scientific endeavor still in the process of becoming established are generally labelled  [[protoscience]] or [[fringe science]]. A definition of mainstream in terms of protoscience and fringe science&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.fiu.edu/~mizrachs/truzzi.html ''Reflections on the reception of unconventional claims in science''], newsletter ''Center for Frontier Sciences'', [[Temple University]] (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; can be understood from the following table:&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn]]: ''Reflections on my critics.''  In: [[Imre Lakatos]] and A. Musgrave: ''Criticism and the growth of knowledge.'' Cambridge University Press, London (1974), pp. 231–278.&lt;/ref&gt;

By its standard practices of applying good [[scientific method]]s, mainstream is distinguished from pseudoscience as a [[demarcation problem]] and specific types of inquiry are debunked as [[junk science]], [[cargo cult science]], [[scientific misconduct]], etc.

== In sociology ==
{{Main|Normality (behavior)}}

Mainstream pressure, through actions such as [[peer pressure]], can force individuals to [[conformity|conform]] to the [[mores]] of the group (e.g., an [[obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] to the mandates of the [[peer group]]). Some, such as those of [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|modern Hipster culture]], have stated that they see mainstream as the antithesis of [[Individualism|individuality]].

According to sociologist [[G. William Domhoff]], critiques of mainstream sociology and political science that suggest their allegiance to an elite few, such as the work of sociologists [[C. Wright Mills]] (especially his book ''[[The Power Elite]]'') and [[Elite theory#Floyd Hunter|Floyd Hunter]], troubles mainstream sociologists, and mainstream sociology "often tries to dismiss power structure research as muckraking or mere investigative journalism" and downplays the notion of dominance by a power elite because of doubts about the ability of many business sectors to coordinate a unified program, while generally overlooking a policy-planning network that can perform this function.&lt;ref name=Domhoff&gt;{{cite web|last1=Domhoff|first1=G. William|title=C. Wright Mills, Floyd Hunter, and 50 Years of Power Structure Research|url=http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/theory/mills_address.html|website=Who Rules America?|accessdate=28 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In religion==

''Mainstream Christianity'' is a term used to collectively refer to the common views of major denominations of [[Christianity]] (such as [[Orthodox Christianity]], [[Roman Catholicism]], [[Anglicanism]], and [[Protestantism]]) as opposed the particular tenets of other [[Christian denomination]]s. The context is dependent on the particular issues addressed, but usually contrasts an [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]] majority view against a [[heterodox]] minority view. In the most common sense, "mainstream" refers to [[Nicene Christianity]], that is the traditions which accept the [[Nicene Creed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |quote= The Nicene Creed is the profession of the Christian Faith common to the Catholic Church, to all the Eastern Churches separated from Rome, and to most of the Protestant denominations |work= [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], Volume XI |year= 1911 |place= New York |publisher= Robert Appleton Company |title= The Nicene Creed |url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11049a.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |quote= Christian statement of faith that is the only ecumenical creed because it is accepted as authoritative by the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican, and major Protestant churches |contribution= Nicene Creed |title= Encyclopædia Britannica |year= 2007 |publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online. |url= http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9055702 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2015}}
{{Main|Mainstreaming (education)}}

"Mainstreaming" is the practice of bringing disabled students into the “mainstream” of student life. Mainstreamed students attend some classes with typical students and other classes with students that have similar disabilities.  Mainstreaming represents a midpoint between [[Inclusive classroom|full inclusion]] (all students spend all day in the regular classroom) and dedicated, self-contained classrooms or [[special school]]s (disabled students are isolated with other disabled students).

==Etymology==
The term ''mainstream'' refers to the main current of a river or stream. Its figurative use by [[Thomas Carlyle]] to indicating the prevailing taste or mode is attested at least as early as 1831.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=mainstream "Mainstream (n)" ''Online Etymology Dictionary'']&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, one citation of this sense is found prior to Carlyle's, as early as 1599.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|mainstream}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the designs that are used contain symbological and religious significance to the Ojibwa.

'''''Midvinterblot''''' (Swedish for "Midwinter sacrifice") is a painting by the Swedish painter [[Carl Larsson]], created in 1915 for the hall of the central staircase in [[Nationalmuseum]] in [[Stockholm]].  It has been called [[Sweden]]'s most controversial painting.&lt;ref name="national"/&gt; 

The painting depicts a legend from [[Norse mythology]] in which the Swedish king [[Domalde]] is sacrificed to avert famine.  After long debate, the painting was rejected by the museum; but the controversy resurfaced in the late 20th century, and the painting finally was placed where Carl Larsson had intended.

==Background==
[[Image:Larsson GustavVasas intåg 2012.jpg|thumb|The painting ''[[Gustav Vasas intåg i Stockholm 1523|Gustav Vasa enters Stockholm 1523]]'', which ''Midvinterblot'' was intended to contrast]]

Larsson was commissioned to decorate all the walls of the central staircase in the museum except for one, and he wanted to decorate the last wall as well. He intended the last wall to present a contrast to the other illustrations of the staircase. Whereas the painting ''[[Gustav Vasas intåg i Stockholm 1523|Gustav Vasa enters Stockholm 1523]]'' presented a midsummer theme with a triumphant king, Larsson wanted the last illustration to be a midwinter theme with a king who sacrificed himself for his people.&lt;ref name="larsson222"&gt;Gunnarsson 1992:222&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources and inspiration==
Larsson went to [[Copenhagen]] to visit the [[National Museum of Denmark]] where he copied the ornamentation of an [[Fibula (brooch)#Iron Age fibulae|Iron Age fibula]]. The literary sources that inspired Larsson were [[Adam of Bremen]] and [[Snorri Sturluson]].&lt;ref name="larsson222"/&gt; On the subject of the [[Temple at Uppsala]], Adam of Bremen had written:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In this temple, built entirely of gold, the people worship the statues of three gods. These images are arranged so that [[Thor]], the most powerful, has his throne in the middle of the group of three. On either side of him sit [[Odin|Othin]] and [[Freyr]]. [...] Near that temple is [[Sacred tree at Uppsala|a very large tree]] with widespread branches which are always green both in winter and summer. What kind of tree it is nobody knows. There is also a spring there where the pagan are accustomed to perform sacrifices and to immerse a human being alive. As long as his body is not found, the request of the people will be fulfilled.&lt;ref name="larsson222"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northvegr.org/lore/gesta/index.php Section of ''History of Hamburg's Bishops'' in English at Northvegr].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Snorri Sturluson]] wrote on the subject of the sacrifice of the king:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[[Domalde|Domald]] took the heritage left by his father [[Visbur]], and ruled over the land. As in his time there was great famine and distress, the Swedes made great [[blót|offerings of sacrifice]] at [[Gamla Uppsala|Upsal]].  The first autumn they sacrificed oxen, but the succeeding season was not improved thereby. The following autumn they sacrificed men, but the succeeding year was rather worse. The third autumn, when the offer of sacrifices should begin, a great multitude of Swedes came to Upsal; and now the chiefs held consultations with each other, and all agreed that the times of scarcity were on account of their king Domald, and they resolved to offer him for good seasons, and to assault and kill him, and sprinkle the stalle of the gods with his blood. And they did so.&lt;ref name="larsson222"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/heim/02ynglga.htm|title=THE YNGLINGA SAGA|work=sacred-texts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northvegr.org/lore/heim/001_03.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312204129/http://www.northvegr.org/lore/heim/001_03.php |archivedate=2007-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Evolution of the work==
===First version===
[[Image:Midvinterblot, first sketch (1910).jpg|thumb|The first sketch (№ 236) from 1910]]

The earliest known sketch (№ 236) is made in graphite and is located in the Carl Larsson museum in Sundborn. It was dated by Karl Axel Arvidsson to a time shortly after the visit to Copenhagen in 1910. In July, Larsson started to paint a large version, which was finished in January 1911, but it is only preserved in a photograph.&lt;ref name="larsson222"/&gt; It is based on the early sketch but it presents a richer set of figures in the foreground. The early version was put on display in Nationalmuseum without receiving any official comments. There was no formal order and no official contest had been declared, and the initiative was only Larsson's.&lt;ref name="larsson223"&gt;Gunnarsson 1992:223&lt;/ref&gt;

An anonymous writer calling himself "Archaeologist" voiced harsh criticism in ''[[Dagens Nyheter]]'' on February 20, 1911. The writer stated that there were several anachronisms in the painting and which had been combined freely. The anonymous writer called the temple a "summer restaurant" decorated with motives from the Biological museum in Stockholm and he considered the dresses in the painting to be as preposterous as a Swedish farm with camels walking around the dunghill.&lt;ref name="larsson223"/&gt;

===Second version===
[[Image:Midvinterblot, second sketch (1913), nr 237.jpg|thumb|The second sketch (№ 237) from 1913]]

The criticism against the artistic freedom of giving a personal interpretation of a distant historic event, could have been directed at many other historic paintings of the 19th century. The criticism against Midvinterblot would be in the same vein during the following years. Larsson retorted that he would happily delegate the task to a younger talent—but he made a second version in oil (№ 237) in which he made the temple wider and where he added an executioner in the centre. The sets of characters were more closely assembled and the frieze-like quality was enhanced.&lt;ref name="larsson223"/&gt;

===Third version===
[[Image:Midvinterblot, third sketch (1913), nr 238.jpg|thumb|The third sketch (№ 238) from 1913]]

Some major changes were introduced in a third [[watercolour painting]] (№ 238) which he made during the autumn of 1913. This version was given the text ''En drömsyn. En konung offras för folket'' ("a dream vision, a king sacrificed for his people"), a text which was possibly added in the hope that it would not be considered to be an attempt at a historically faithful reconstruction.&lt;ref name="larsson223f"&gt;Gunnarsson 1992:223ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The most essential change consisted of a more monumental composition. The temple had been enlarged considerably and given a more stern shape, and the figures had been more closely assembled and they formed an unbroken relief-like row. The sketch was put on exhibition in the museum in November 1913 and in a letter to Ludvig Looström, the director of the museum, Larsson offered the painting for 35,000 Swedish kronor.&lt;ref name="larsson225"&gt;Gunnarsson 1992:225&lt;/ref&gt;

This version was criticised even before the museum board had had time to present their own view. August Brunius, who had expressed his enthusiasm for the Gustav Vasa painting, reacted against the choice of subject, like most critics. The choice of subject was only aggravated by the way it was presented.&lt;ref name="larsson225"/&gt; Brunius felt the painting to be unreal, unbelievable and not very relevant for the modern Swedes of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Det hela är overkligt som en opera, man tror icke på vad som sker, man känner icke för vad som sker. /.../ ''Midvinterblot'' är ett kusligt uppträde av tvivelaktig historisk sanning och angår oss moderna svenskar föga mer än en människoätarscen i mörkaste Afrika" (Sv. D. 6 November 1913). '''Translation''': "''The whole thing is as unreal as an opera, one cannot believe what is happening, one cannot connect emotionally with what is taking place. /.../ Midvinterblot is a creepy, scandalous scene of dubious historicity and is no more relevant to us, modern Swedes, than a scene of cannibalism from the darkest Africa” (from ''Svenska Dagbladet'', November 6, 1913)''".&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 17, 1914, the museum's board presented their ambivalent view on the painting. The majority of the board seconded the motion that Larsson was to finish ''Midvinterblot'' for the museum wall, but they added the reservation that the main scene with the sacrifice of a king should be excluded or downplayed. The director of the museum, Looström, objected to the board's ruling, and he declared the painting to illustrate a "ritual killing" and he would rather the wall remain empty. Carl Larsson received the ruling of the board as a confirmation that the museum accepted his painting, but he declared that he would not make the suggested changes, nor would he accept the suggestion that the painting should be installed in the [[Stockholm City Hall]] instead.&lt;ref name="larsson225"/&gt;

Even Larsson's good friend and biographist Georg Nordensvan joined the critics, but he could not sway Larsson's determination either, although Larsson probably took his criticism hardest. The archaeologist Bror Schnittger, who was probably identical to the anonymous writer who had initiated the criticism, launched additional criticism in ''Svenska Dagbladet'' against the lack of historical authenticity in the painting. The distance in dating between the objects in the painting were given as at least 2000 years and Schnittger thought that the painting was unacceptable in the museum building.&lt;ref name="larsson225"/&gt; Larsson stated that he intentionally included objects that would be from the distant past in relation to the setting of the painting, and that he did not see these as anachronisms, because he imagined the subjects would be antiquarians who kept ancient items as ritual objects.&lt;ref name="Moynihan2007_236"&gt;Moynihan 2007:236&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 1, 1914, Larsson, who was by then ostracized, wrote a letter to the minister of religious affairs and declared that he resigned from the task of illustrating the museum wall.&lt;ref name="larsson225"/&gt;

===The final versions and rejection===
[[Image:Midvinterblot, fourth sketch (1915), nr 239.jpg|thumb|The fourth sketch (№ 239) from 1915]]
[[Image:Studie för kung Domalde (1914), nr 240.jpg|thumb|The study of king Domalde (№ 240) from 1914]]
[[Image:Bödeln (1914), nr 241.jpg|thumb|The wizard (№ 241) from 1914]]

In May 1914, Carl Larsson resumed the work on the painting on his own initiative.&lt;ref name="larsson225"/&gt; During 1915, he presented a painted sketch (№ 239), which was largely consistent with the previous painting. The king had been remade based on an oil painting (№ 240) that Larsson had made with a male model named Rydberg in 1914. The king's position was more pathetically composed and expressive and it agreed more with the change of emphasis that had taken place during the evolution of the work after Larsson's decision that the sacrifice was voluntary.&lt;ref name="larsson226"&gt;Gunnarsson 1992:226&lt;/ref&gt;

A new figure, a [[völva|wizard]], had been added to the left of the sleighs and the lion guardians at the entry of the temple, which had received a noticeably Chinese character. The colours are forceful and there are considerable amounts of gold, something that Larsson intended as a disclaimer of the common notion that pre-history was gray.&lt;ref name="larsson226"/&gt;

Before the final decision, both the board and Carl Larsson knew that the minister of religious affairs was favourable towards the new painting. However, a majority of the board, including the former director Looström and his successor [[Richard Bergh]], was against it, and only two were in favour. Instead, the board asked Larsson to make a different painting. Larsson did not answer initially, but he declared in the press that he still considered ''Midvinterblot'' to be among the greatest and most beautiful works he had ever made.&lt;ref name="larsson226f"&gt;Gunnarsson 1992:226ff&lt;/ref&gt;

The minister asked for expert advice and the debate continued in the newspapers. There were suspicions that there was a political side to the animosity between Bergh and Larsson, but these suspicions were convincingly dispelled much later by [[Prince Eugén, Duke of Närke]] in a personal letter.&lt;ref name="larsson227"&gt;Gunnarsson 1992:227&lt;/ref&gt;

A book published by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson claims that the most immediate and natural explanation for the ultimate rejection of the painting was the fact that time had rendered the painting unfashionable. Because of the long debate, the painting became a survivor from [[Romanticism|a time past]] and it could not meet the [[modernism#The explosion of modernism 1910–1930|modernist ideals]] of the new century.&lt;ref name="larsson227"/&gt;

The final version was exhibited where it was intended to be in June 1915. In the following year, it was shown at the art gallery [[Liljevalchs konsthall]] as its first exhibit was dedicated to Carl Larsson, [[Bruno Liljefors]] and [[Anders Zorn]]. It was tentatively shown again in Nationalmuseum during the period 1925–1933. In 1942, the painting was stored at the ''Archive for Public Decorative Art'' (now renamed the ''Museum of Sketches'') in [[Lund]]&lt;ref name="larsson227"/&gt;, where it was prominently on show for forty years.

According to the book by Nationalmuseum, the controversy concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and the ideals that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more indifferent to these ideals. The events embittered his last years and he declared in his autobiography that the controversy broke him down and that he admitted it with anger. It is clear that he began to identify himself with the work and it is possible that he also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.&lt;ref name="larsson227"/&gt;

==The later controversy and eventual acceptance==
[[Image:Nationalmuseum trappa 2008b.jpg|thumb|In 1997, the painting was finally installed in the place for which it was made (picture taken in 2008).]]

During 1983–1984, the painting was exhibited at the [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]] in Stockholm, and after this exhibit an art dealer offered to donate or sell the painting to Nationalmuseum. The board rejected the offer with the statement that the Old Norse motif was more appropriate for the Museum of National Antiquities, which at the time still shared the same building as Nationalmuseum. When the Museum of National Antiquities had been moved to a building of its own, the painting should be moved there too.&lt;ref name="larsson227"/&gt;

After this rejection, the painting was sold to a Swedish art collector who offered to sell it to the Museum of National Antiquities for 12 million Swedish kronor. This offer caused a controversy in which people debated if the painting belonged to Nationalmuseum or the Museum of National Antiquities. In this debate where there were exaggerations in both directions, people claimed that the painting was both an unsurpassed masterpiece of Swedish art and a work of suspect morality. In 1987, it was sold by [[Sotheby's]] in [[London]] to a Japanese art collector.&lt;ref name="larsson227"/&gt;

In 1992, Nationalmuseum celebrated its bicentennial anniversary and dedicated the exhibit to Carl Larsson. The Japanese owner lent the painting to the museum and when the 300,000 visitors  of the late 20th century could see the work for the first time in the hall where it was intended to be, the general opinion changed.&lt;ref name="national"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmuseum.se/Global/PDF/Skolan/L%C3%A4rarhandledningar/L%C3%A4rarhandledningar/F%C3%B6rsta%20m%C3%B6tet-%20CLs%20v%C3%A4ggm%C3%A5lningar/PDF_skola_Handledning_Se_hur_det_kanns_Folder_Midvinterblot.pdf|format=PDF|title=Midvinterblot, Sveriges mest omdiskuterade målning|website=nationalmuseum.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Nationalmuseum bought the painting from the collector ordered a frame for stretching the canvas from [[Per Målare]], a carpenter in [[Gagnef]], [[Dalarna]], and installed it permanently where Carl Larsson had intended it to be.&lt;ref name="national"/&gt;

The painting provides the background for the book ''Midwinterblood'' by [[Marcus Sedgwick]], published in 2011.

The '''Mingun Bell''' ({{lang-my-Mymr|မင်းကွန်းခေါင်းလောင်းတော်ကြီး}} {{IPA-my|mɪ́ɴɡʊ́ɴ kʰáʊɴláʊɴ dɔ̀ dʑí|}}) is a [[bell (instrument)|bell]] located in [[Mingun]], [[Sagaing Region]], [[Myanmar]]. It is located approximately {{convert|11|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Mandalay]] on the western bank of the [[Irrawaddy River]]. It was the heaviest functioning bell in the world at several times in history. 

==Description==
The weight of the bell is 55,555 [[Burmese units of measurement#Mass|viss]] ({{convert|90,718|kg|lb|0|disp=or}}). This number is conveniently remembered by many people in Myanmar as a mnemonic "''Min Hpyu Hman Hman Pyaw''" ({{lang-my-Mymr|မင်းဖြူမှန်မှန်ပြော}}), with the consonants representing the number 5 in Burmese astronomy and numerology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-museum/largest-ringing-bell.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120909082625/http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-museum/largest-ringing-bell.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-09-09 |title=The Mingun Bell |publisher=Myanmar's Net Inc. |accessdate=2008-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmars.net/myanmar-travel/myanmar-mandalay/mingun.htm|title=Mingun|publisher=Myanmar's Net Inc.|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weight of the bell and its mnemonic words are written on the surface of the bell in white.

The outer diameter of the rim of the bell is {{convert|16|ft|3|in|m|2}}. The height of the bell is {{convert|12.0|ft|m|2}} on the exterior and {{convert|11.5|ft|m|2}} in the interior. The outside circumference at the rim is {{convert|50.75|ft|m|3}}. The bell is {{convert|6|to(-)|12|in|cm|0}} thick and stands {{convert|20.7|ft|m|2}} high from the rim to the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/8-2001/min.htm|title=The Mingun Bell|publisher=Ni Ni Myint, (www.myanmar.gov.mm)|accessdate=2008-04-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706051545/http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/8-2001/min.htm|archivedate=2008-07-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bell is uncracked and in good ringing condition. The bell does not have a clanger but is rung by striking the outer edge.&lt;ref name=bird/&gt;

==History==
{{multiple image|right|direction=vertical|image1=Mingun Bell 1873.jpg|width=200|image2=Mingun Bell 1896.jpg|footer=Mingun Bell in 1873 (top) and 1896}}
Casting of the bell started in 1808 and was finished by 1810. King [[Bodawpaya]] (r. 1782–1819) had this gigantic bell cast to go with his huge [[stupa]], [[Mingun Pahtodawgyi]]. The bell was said to have been cast on the opposite side of the river and was transported by using two boats, which after crossing the river, proceeded up two specially built canals. The canals were then dammed and the bell was lifted by raising the water level by the addition of earth into the blocked canal. In this way the bell was originally suspended.&lt;ref name=bird/&gt;

The Mingun Bell was knocked off its supports as a result of a large [[earthquake]] on 23 March 1839. It was resuspended by the [[Irrawaddy Flotilla Company]] in March 1896 using screw jacks and levers using funds from public subscription. The party to celebrate was attended by many and an hourly boat was required to take visitors from nearby [[Mandalay]].&lt;ref name=bird&gt;Bird, George W (1897). [http://dlxs.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=sea&amp;cc=sea&amp;idno=sea282&amp;node=sea282%3A29&amp;frm=frameset&amp;view=image&amp;seq=466''Wanderings in Burma''], pages 318–319. London: Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co., Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Felice Beato]] captured a photograph of the bell prior to its resuspension.

==Current status==
At 90 tons, the Mingun Bell reigned as the largest ringing bell in the world until 2000, when it was eclipsed by the 116-ton [[Bell of Good Luck]] at the [[Foquan Temple]], [[Pingdingshan]], [[Henan]], [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kungfuhome.net/Htmls/Scenic/Scenic_308.shtml Fodushan Scenic Area]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Elaeis guineensis - noix de palme oil palm - harvesting fruits from the the cluster.jpg|thumb|Harvesting palm nuts for ''moambe'']]

'''Palm butter''' or '''palm cream''', frequently known as '''moambe''', '''mwambe''' or '''nyembwe''', is an ingredient made from the [[pericarp]] (not the seeds) of palm nuts, the fruit of the [[African oil palm]] (''Elaeis guineensis'') tree. It forms an important ingredient in stews and sauces in [[African cuisine]].

Dishes made with the sauce often include [[peanut]]s, peanut sauce, or [[peanut butter]]. The meat usually used in the dishes is [[chicken]] but other meats such as beef, fish, mutton, or any wild game meat such as crocodile or venison are used as well. [[Moambe chicken]] is considered a [[national dish]] of three African countries.

==Regional variations==
[[File:Moambe - noix de palme sauce with chicken.jpg|thumb|Dish of [[Poulet Moambe]]]]
In order to make palm butter, palm nuts are boiled and then pounded. The pulp is mixed with water, sieved and boiled again. Canned palm soup base, also called ''sauce graine'' or ''noix de palme'' may be substituted.

===Gabon===
In Gabon, the sauce is usually called ''nyembwe'' from the [[Myene language|Myene]] word for palm oil.&lt;ref name="Gabon"&gt;[http://www.gabonmagazine.com/images/G10-ENGLISH/G10.palmoil.p18-23.pdf "Oiling the Wheels of the Economy."] ''Gabon''. Winter 2007. p. 19.  Retrieved 10 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The most important dish using nyembwe is [[Nyembwe chicken]] (French: ''poulet [au] Nyembwe'' or ''poulet [au] Gnemboue'') which is considered a national dish of Gabon.&lt;ref name="Gabon"/&gt;

===Republic of the Congo===
In the Republic of the Congo, the sauce is called ''moambé'' or ''mwambe''. [[Moambe chicken]] is considered a national dish of the country.

===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
In western regions of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, ''mwambi'' or ''mwambe'' ({{lang-ln|mwǎmba}}) is the name given to the sauce of palm oil or peanuts. [[Poulet à la Moambé]], "chicken in a ''moambe'' sauce", is also considered the Congo's national dish.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/africa/192part-guide-to-the-world-democratic-republic-of-congo-633651.html Travel: 192-Part Guide to the World Part 41 Congo (Kinshasa)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Angola===
In Angola the dish is called ''[[muamba de galinha]]'' and is considered a national dish as well. It is usually served with funge, a manioc purée, and can be made with fish on occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton,Cherie.

Measurement is derived from the verb 'to measure' which means to assess something; in Arabic 'yaqees' 'measure' has the meaning of comparing something to something else. In this sense, measurement is a daily practice that manifests itself in all our assessment activities, whether we assess concrete things in terms of size and color, or abstract things such as human relations. The ultimate goal of 'measuring' something is to assess ourselves in comparison to everything else in the world.

Some of measurement areas include measuring the level or standard of knowledge nationwide or measuring the standard of a particular sect of the whole population or measuring for licensing or admission purposes in [[university education]], [[Vocational education|vocational]] or [[technical education]], for example. Measurement can never be done without well-recognized and approved criteria. We use the '[[meter]]', for example, as the measuring unit for distance and use '[[gram]]' unit for weight and '[[hour]]' unit for time and so on.

Scientifically speaking, there have been numerous definitions of 'measurement' that vary depending on the measured object and the set criteria, goals and controls of measurement.
Measurement varies based on:
* evaluating things in quantitative terms and in a graded manner based on the well-known rule that everything exists in quantities and every quantity is measurable.
* representing properties in numerical terms based on certain rules.
* measuring some mental processes and psychological traits  via a group of stimuli especially set to do quantitative  and qualitative evaluation.

Assessment simply means to evaluate something, and in scientific terms it refers to the process of passing judgment to evaluate capacity, knowledge, actions, solutions, methods, materials, etc. This is often done by applying certain criteria and standards to check adequacy, accuracy and effectiveness. In other words, evaluation means to give something a value based on approved standards. In the educational field, assessment refers to testing students' achievement and how far is obtained relative to some known educational objectives or goals. Measurement and assessment are so related and integrated.

== About the center ==
On 19/8/2000 AD, the [[Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques]] ordered the establishment of “The National Center for Assessment in higher Education” to perform [[standardized tests]] to measure student achievements applying for [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate study]].

After the establishment, the center set the mission, vision and goals, to determine its plan and path, which based itself on preparing scientific and professional standards where equity and efficiency are present, and at the same time, to achieve global leadership in the formulation tests and standards in the educational and professional fields.

The center includes a number of functional, linguistic,  and professional departments entrusted with the preparation of tests and assessments, as well as other supportive departments. The Centre has also developed an organizational structure that explains the process of decision making and how it moves from the top of the pyramid of management to the rest of the departments.

Since its establishment, the center has made outstanding accomplishments in the preparation and formulation of [[standardized testing]] in various educational and professional fields that has been published in annual reports, which is part of the center’s strategy of clarity, transparency and communication with various segments of society.

== Establishment ==

On the 19th of [[Jumada al-awwal]] 1421 [[Hijri year|AH]] which corresponds to the 19th of August 2000, a royal decree numbered 471/8 affirming the Higher Education Council’s along with the [[Council of Ministers of Saudi Arabia|Council of Ministers]] Decision, which includes:
#	The requirements of college admission should include exams where its results are used as a standard along with the high school diploma results, those tests could be performed according to the following:
:*	Exams to test the student’s abilities and skills.
:*	Exams to test the student’s [[educational attainment]], and those tests should be unified when it comes to majors which are the same.
#	The student is allowed to take the Exam more than one time in a year.
#	Establishing a managerially and financially independent center to be named “ The National Center for Assessment in Higher Education.”
# To receive a fee, which is Commensurate with the costs of preparing these exams, to cover the costs of running the center and its development, and to organize the appropriate research in order to achieve this.

== Mission, vision, and goals ==
===Mission===
To provide educational and professional assessments that contributes in achieving equity and to elevate the efficiency of the institutions of our society, and to provide specialized studies and consultations in the field of [[educational assessment]].

===Vision===
To achieve global leadership in the formulation of tests and standards in the educational and professional fields.

===Goals===
#	To develop means of educational assessment for all levels of education.
#	The preparation and the management of the standards of the professional licensing tests.
#	To assess educational achievements in order to elevate the efficiency of educational institutions.
#	To help in finding students with extraordinary abilities, skills, and creativity.
#	To attract and to sponsor experienced individuals in the area of assessment.
#	Provide professional and education consultation services in the area of assessment.
#	To perform specialized studies and research, and to spread the awareness on the importance of assessment in both the educational and the social fields.

== Tests and assessments ==
[[Educational testing|Educational tests]] presented by the center, are considered the most important test that are being developed, and it consists of two sections : The [[Language|verbal]] and the [[wikt:Special:Search/quantitative#Adjective|quantitative]]. These test forces on student's analytical and deductive skills, in order to help them assess their learning capacity.

[[linguistics|Linguistic]] tests, are the second type of tests provided by the center, it includes: [[English language]] efficiency test, and the [[Arabic language]] test for non-native speakers. The center also presents an assessment test for talented and creative students, as well as vocational tests, the most important of which: Vocational Standards Test for Teachers.

The test developing process goes through a number of steps, which  includes theoretical and practical aspect. After the tests are formulated, they are subjected to examinations and testing through a specialized arbitrary committee, and prior to the final approval, the test are revised by a specialized committee, that consists of four experts.

==Stages of test and question construction==

Test construction is based upon practical and scientific rules that are applied before, during and after each item until it finally becomes a part of the test.  The following are the stages of constructing a test as followed by the Center.

===Preparation===
Each year the Center attracts a number of competent specialists in testing and educationalists to receive training in workshops that deal with the theoretical and applied aspects of the test. The theoretical aspects include:

# the concepts on which a test is constructed
# the  goals and objectives of the test.
# the general components , parts  and sections of a test
# the theoretical and technical foundations of test building.

Applied training includes:
# discussing different types of test items. This aims at putting theoretical and technical concepts into practice.
# collective training on writing items for various parts of the test
# constructing items on  individual basis  (outside workshops) which  is intended as peer teaching.

===Test writing===
*	Each test writer is charged with making questions that are relevant to his/her specialty.
*	Each test writer is given a code number that carries his/her personal data for confidentiality.
*	Each item is given a code number that is kept intact. Each item is in the question bank even if it is not to be used in the test.

===Arbitration===

Various items of the test are arbitrated by a 3-member committee:
 
# a specialist in the content area.
# a specialist in measurement
# an experienced educator.

Each item is either:
# accepted as is, or
# accepted after modifications, or
# rejected as invalid.

Based on a set questionnaire the committee judge each item from various dimensions including the nature of the item, item difficulty, item conformity to the content controls, item bias, and item quality. Justifications have to be provided if an item is deemed invalid. All data is entered into the Center's computer.

===Item entry===

All items are entered into the computer marked with the relevant arbitration judgment except  those  deemed invalid or incorrigible.

===Review===
All the computerized items are reviewed by four testing experts to verify:

# strict implementation of arbitration committee comments.
# accuracy of numbers and graphs.
# no grammatical, spelling errors or misprints.
# full compliance of items to the test pre-set standards and regulations.
# answer key is provided for all test items.
# screening out the items that seem too complicated or might take  too much time to answer.

===Item trial (pilot testing)===

Trial items are included in the actual test and they go through the same stages of test preparation above, but they do not calculate towards the final score.

===Item analysis===

Items are statistically analyzed so that the valid ones are selected for the test, while the invalid ones are rejected.

===Test construction===

Test is constructed in its final form. Items are randomly selected from those deposited in the question bank in a manner that adequately represents that various parts of test dimensions.

===Test production===

The test is finally produced. Trial questions are included and various versions of the test are prepared to avoid cheating. The test is printed in booklets that include test instructions and test items.

===Equivalence of various test versions===

The Center produces multiple versions of the same test. However, the Center has been cautious about discrepancies between various versions of the test in terms of difficulty, discrimination or content. An equivalence check  is run during test construction based on scientific criteria to ensure test discrimination and differential capacity. Although it is more accurate to run equivalence test during construction stage, equivalence criterion is applied during and after the test.

==Giftedness and Creativity Assessment (Mawhiba)==

'''Objectives:'''

The Objectives of this test is to detect the student’s potential abilities and academic skills in the fields of Language, Mathematics, Science, and some creativity aspects, given to it by a series of dimensions, sections, styles, and images.

'''Sections:'''
#	Mental flexibility.
#	Scientific and mechanical reasoning.
#	Linguistic reasoning and reading comprehension.
#	Mathematical and spatial.

'''Eligible test takers:'''
All levels of public education starting from 3rd grade all the way to the senior year of high school, in all the schools in the kingdom, note that the detection tools will be applied on the following educational levels:

#	3rd grade.
#	6th grade.
#	9th grade.

==Educational tests==

===General Aptitude Test (GAT)===
'''Objectives''' 

This test measures a student's analytical and deductive skills. It focuses on testing the student's capacity for learning in general regardless of any specific skill in a certain subject or topic. The test measures abilities relevant to:
#	reading comprehension
#	recognizing logical relations
#	solving problems based on  basic mathematical notions.
#	inference skills
#	measuring capacity

'''GAT Sections'''

The test is divided into two sections, the verbal and the  quantitative.
A.	The verbal section. This section includes the following.

#	Reading comprehension. Testees are required to comprehend and analyze reading passages by answering the questions given.
#	Sentence completion.  Testees are asked to fill in the missing parts in the text to make complete meaningful sentences.
#	Verbal analogy. Testees are required to match the relation between a pair of words given at the beginning of the question and a pair given in the choices.
#	Synonymy. Testees are asked to give a synonym that matches the meaning of the word give.

B.	The quantitative Section

This section includes suitable mathematical problems that match General Secondary Schools Science and humanities majors. It focuses on measurements, inference and problem solving skills and requires only basic knowledge. The questions are divided as follows:

:{| class="wikitable"
| Arithmetic questions ||  40%
|-
| Geometry questions || 24%
|-
| Algebra questions  ||  23%
|-
| Statistices and analytical questions || 13%
|-
|}

As for the humanities-major students, GAT includes 30 questions on arithmetic ,geometry and mathematical analysis.

'''Test duration'''

The test normally takes two and half hours, divided on 25-minute intervals for each of the six test parts.

'''Results'''

Answer sheets are machine-graded and results are listed and printed and then announced. A student can receive GAT score via the Center's website or through an SMS for those registered for this service. Results are electronically sent to universities and colleges. For student who did the test more than once, only the highest score is sent. GAT is not a Pass-Fail test. The recorded score that the student receives represents the relevant position that the student occupies among the total number of students taking the test. Every higher education institution in Saudi Arabia has its own method of interpreting the relevant weight of GAT vs. General Secondary School final score. Competition in university admission is then based on the combined total scores of the GAT and General Secondary School in addition to the score obtained in any achievement test administered by the university (if required).

'''Is GAT a Pass/Fail test?'''

As noted above, GAT is no Pass/Fail test. This 100-point test carries a certain relative weight interpreted by the institution the student applies for. GAT score should not be compared to that of General Secondary School score. What really matters is the relevant position of the student compared to those of other students, according to the following table:

:{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Score
! Student's Position
|-
| 81 and above
| Top 5%
|-
| 78 and above
| Top 10%
|-
| 73 and above
| Top 20%
|-
| 70 and above
| Top 30%
|-
| 61-65
| The average
|-
| 60 and below
| Lowest 30%
|}

::This test is presented three times every year, the test times are on the center's website.

====Arabic Language Test for Non-Native Speakers====
:This test is designed to measure the non-native speaking student’s proficiency in the Arabic language.

*'''Reasons to develop this test:'''
::Standardized tests are considered an evaluation and assessment tools, that reflects the development and advancement of societies; because it is usually created due to the need of attracting qualified individuals by the society’s sectors and institutions. These institutions often prove their efficiency through the means of having their employees pass certain curtain assessment tests, which are based on scientific and objective standards. It is curtain that teaching the Arabic language to non-native speakers has gone a long way in accumulating experience and success, and it well known that there is a need for an efficient and an objective way to assess the proficiency of a language for non-native speakers. When it came to choosing process amongst the non-native speakers in some programs, it is usually done through the criteria of competitiveness, the existence of a standardized test that facilitates the selection process proved to be essential. These test should also be developed by a specialized institution in the field of assessment. Thus, this specialized test has become the topping of the accumulated knowledge and long experience in teaching the Arabic language, it also adds a new dimension and an element of maturity and success to the process.

*'''Students eligible to sit for this test:'''
::Perhaps the most beneficiary of this test are the academic establishments, whether it be schools, institutions, and universities, that seeks to attract non-native speaking students. For a long time, Arabic universities has been keen on attracting a large number of non-native speaking students. There are also other universities in the world that adopted similar approaches in accepting students seeking to study the Arabic language or to study other sciences using the Arabic language.
::This test could be used in the following:
::#Joining a language program or academic tracks that require a certain level of proficiency in the language.
::#Exemption from certain academic requirements.
::#Joining jobs that require knowledge in Arabic language.
::#Document the student’s language level while studying and after.

*'''Targeted language proficiency level:'''
::This test measures the student’s efficiency and skills in listening, reading, and writing using standard Arabic. In general, the test concentrates on the academic part of the language more than the other communication skills. Hence, it is more in sync with the programs that are available in Arabic countries, it also helps in connecting the student to the current culture of the Arab world.

::The Test consists of the following skillset:	
:::{| class="wikitable"
|-
| Reading comprehension || 40%
|-
| Writing || 35%
|-
| Listening comprehension || 25%
|}

::The test is divided into 6 parts, every part is 25 minutes long.

*'''Test Consistency:'''
::The consistency of the Arabic Language Test for Non-Native Speakers in its first draft 0.94; which means that this test has a high [[Internal consistency|consistency rate]].

[[File:Kids skinny dipping in India.jpg|thumb|right|Boys swimming in a sacred tank in [[India]], 2006]]
'''Nude swimming''', or '''skinny dipping''', is the practice of [[human swimming|bathing]] [[nudity|naked]], originally in natural bodies of water, but also in [[swimming pool]]s or [[hot tub]]s. The term ''[[wikt:dipping|dipping]]'' was the practice of being immersed in spring waters, for health reasons at [[spa town]]s.

The widespread social convention and practice today is for swimmers especially in public places to wear [[swimsuit]]s. Most countries do not have specific laws proscribing nude swimming, and the matter is regulated largely by social convention and practice. Nude swimming takes place on [[nude beach]]es, or at [[Naturism|naturist]] facilities, segregated public swimming areas or in private swimming pools. Some countries around the world regard nude swimming as [[public nudity]], which is treated in a variety of ways, ranging from tolerance to strict enforcement of prohibitions against it.

The term ''[[wikt:skinny-dip|skinny-dip]]'' was first recorded in English in 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED1|skinny dip}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is most commonly used in the United States.

== History ==
===Established practice===
[[Human swimming|Bathing]] by both sexes together had occurred since time immemorial and is documented in [[Cave of Swimmers|neolithic cave drawings]] and [[Roman mosaics]] and frescos. The [[woodcut]] illustrations in [[Everard Digby (scholar)|Everard Digby]]'s 1587 book ''The Art of Swimming (De Arte Natandi)'' and later, the 40 [[copperplate etching]]s in [[Melchisédech Thévenot]]'s 1789 instruction book, also called ''The Art of Swimming'', &lt;!-- date disputed --&gt; illustrate that swimming was normally [[swimsuit|costume]] free. When working people started visiting the coast to be 'dipped' for health or to 'bathe' for leisure cannot be determined but had been happening for 'some time' in 1709.{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=9}}{{sfn|Walton|1983|pp=10,11}}

=== 18th century===
For the common folk, splashing in rivers and swimming was a leisure activity and always done naked by boys and men and often by the women and girls. Bathing in the sea by the lower classes was noted in [[Southampton]] by [[Thomas Gray]] in 1764, and in [[Exmouth]] by shoals of [[Exeter]] damsels in unsufferable undress in 1779.{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=11}} Lancashire working people bathed naked in the sea without any segregation in 1795:

{{quote|lower classes of people of both sexes made an annual pilgrimage to Liverpool where they dabbled in the salt water for hours at each tide in promiscuous numbers and not much embarrassing themselves about appearance.{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=11}} }}

====Spa towns====
[[Thomas Guidott]] set up a medical practice in the English town of [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]] in 1668. He became interested in the curative properties of the waters and he wrote ''A discourse of Bathe, and the hot waters there. Also, Some Enquiries into the Nature of the water'' in 1676. This brought the health-giving properties of the hot mineral waters to the attention of the aristocracy.{{sfn|Burns|1981}} Doctors and quacks set up further [[spa town]]s such as [[Harrogate]], Bath, [[Matlock, Derbyshire|Matlock]] and [[Buxton]] soon after taking advantage of mineral water from [[chalybeate]] springs.{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=8}} Here cures were guaranteed by '[[spa|taking the water]]' or being 'dipped' by bathing attendant in cold water. Treatment was received in the nude. Until the 1670s nude female bathing in the spas was the norm and only after that restrictions were imposed. As time progressed the resorts had to address two questions; was it right that men and women bathed together, and was it right that clothes should be worn. Establishments sought to impose dress codes.

Each town was free to make its [[bylaw|own laws]], and some chose to. For example, the Bath Corporation official bathing dress code of 1737 prohibited men and women to swim nude either in the day or in the night. Bath's specific rules were prescribed as follows:

{{quote|It is Ordered Established and Decreed by this Corporation that no Male person above the age of ten years shall at any time hereafter go into any Bath or Baths within this City by day or by night without a Pair of [[Undergarment|Drawers]] and a [[Waistcoat]] on their bodies. No Female person shall at any time hereafter go into a Bath or Baths within this City by day or by night without a decent [[Chemise|Shift]] on their bodies.{{sfn|Byrd|1987|p=50}}}}

Female bathing costumes were derived from those worn at Bath and other spas.

====Sea bathing resorts====
In the early 1730s, fashionable [[sea bathing]] initially followed the inland health seeking tradition. At English resorts such as [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] and [[Whitby]], natural springs emerged from the cliffs allowing fresh water to be ingested and cold dip in the sea.{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=12}} The resorts modelled themselves on Bath, and provided [[promenade]]s, [[circulating library|circulating libraries]] and [[assembly room]]s.{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=9}}

While sea bathing or dipping, men and boys were naked. Women and girls were encouraged to dip wearing loose clothing. Scarborough was the first resort to provide [[bathing machine]]s for changing. Some men extended this to swimming in the sea and by 1736 it was seen at Brighton and [[Margate]], and later at [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], [[Eastbourne]] and [[Portsmouth]].{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=12}} Seeing them frolicking in the sea attracted sightseers to the sea spa resort.

Working people also started to visit the coast to be dipped or bathe. In 1709, Walton records a man from [[Crosby, Merseyside|Crosby]] having his daughters dipped in the sea to cure a skin complaint.{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=9}}

====Notable American====
Among notable Americans, [[Benjamin Franklin]], an avid swimmer, possessed a copy of ''The Art of Swimming'' by [[Melchisédech Thévenot]], which featured illustrations of nude swimmers.{{sfn|Thévenot|1789|p=}} American president [[John Quincy Adams]] was known to skinny-dip.

=== 19th century ===
At the beginning of the Victorian period, working people of both sexes bathed for pleasure without clothes. The genteel classes were bathing for health from using bathing machines, the men and boys swam naked while the girls and women dipped alongside them.{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=30}} On the [[River Cherwell]] near the [[University of Oxford]] an area for male nude bathing was known as [[Parson's Pleasure]], and a nearby area for female nude bathing was known as [[Dame's Delight]].

The rise of the influence of Christian [[Evangelical]]s caused arrangements for [[mixed bathing]] to be reassessed. Moral pressures forced some town councils to establish zones for the women and men to bathe separately. A half-hearted attempt was made to suggest to men that torso-suits would be fashionable, but this was resisted by genteel swimmers who believed that torso-suits restricted the contact between the skin and the saltwater.{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=30}}

These areas were not policed, and around 1860–75,{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=19}} under pressure from the church ever stricter bylaws were passed but not enforced. Mixed bathing was a popular activity for families, who would take their custom to the next resort along the coast if mixed bathing was forbidden.{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=21}} Resorts were trying to placate the Evangelicals without upsetting traditional bathers by designating separate areas of the beach.{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=22}}

Drawers, or [[caleçon]]s as they were called (''fr:caleçon de bain''), came into use in the 1860s. Even then there were many who protested against them and wanted to remain in the nude. Rev. [[Francis Kilvert]], an English nude swimmer, quoted by Cinder described men's bathing suits coming into use in the 1870s as "a pair of very short red and white striped drawers". Excerpts from Kilvert's diary show the transition in the England of the 1870s from an acceptance of nude bathing to the acceptance of bathing suits. Kilvert describes "a delicious feeling of freedom in stripping in the open air and running down naked to the sea."{{sfn|Cinder|1998|pp=331-3}}

There are very few records of magistrates enforcing the bylaws. In 1895 ''Cosmopolitan'' reported: "At most English resorts, buff bathing is available before eight o'clock in the morning"{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=23}} while [[Brighton]], [[Worthing]], [[Hastings]], [[Bexhill-on-Sea|Bexhill]], [[Bognor Regis|Bognor]] and [[Folkestone]] still tolerated nude bathing at any time of the day, in areas away from the central bathing areas.{{sfn|Travis|1997|p=23}}

In 1895, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', [[London Evening Standard|''Standard'']], ''[[Daily Graphic]]'' and ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspapers ran a campaign to reintroduce mixed bathing in all resorts, pointing out that its prohibition split up families and encouraged them to take their holidays abroad. Commercial pressure defeated the moral pressures. Sea bathing had ceased to be done for health reasons, and was done overwhelmingly for pleasure. As the segregated beaches in town disappeared, bathing costumes for men became part of the commercial package, and nude bathing ceased.{{sfn|Travis|1997|pp=23,29}} Nude bathing continued to be practised outside resorts on isolated pieces of coast; a very few of these known beaches and coves later got local authority recognition as [[nude beach]]es.

The introduction of mixed bathing throughout Europe and elsewhere certainly created pressure towards bathing costumes being worn by both genders. However, well into the latter days of the Victorian Era, whereas all females were routinely wearing modest bathing attire, many boys well into their teens in Victorian England, even when in a mixed gender setting, were still swimming and playing at the beach resorts completely naked. An article published on August 23, 1891 in the ''Syracuse Sunday Herald'' suggests naked boys of up to 15 years in age were problematic for American parents with daughters, and read:

{{quote|A 'Bewildered American' writes to the London Standard that he can't take his little girl to play in the sand at a British seaside resort without her being surrounded by crowds of naked boys. An English friend told him that they let their daughters play with naked boys of ten years of age, but draw the line at fifteen.{{sfn|The Sunday Herald|August 23, 1891}}}}

All this was very much an English problem and one of attitude. In France discreet nude bathing for both sexes remained acceptable anywhere along the coast or on river banks apart from those in the town or village centres. In Germany, provision for nude swimming is made in major city centre parks such as the [[English Garden (Munich)|English Garden]] in [[Munich]].

[[File:Swimming hole.jpg|thumb|[[Thomas Eakins]], ''[[The Swimming Hole]]'' (1885)]]
In America, skinny dipping by boys was common. The [[Dixon, Illinois]] ''Evening Telegraph'' 1890 published a request: "for boys swimming in the [[mill race]] to be more modest as women felt they can't go down Water Street for fear of seeing them."&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, ''Illinois Evening Telegraph'', 18 June 1890&lt;/ref&gt;

Swimming was not only a sport for the residents of Victorian [[East London, Eastern Cape]], but due to periodic water shortages, sometimes a necessity. From 1873 the town council promulgated measures to control swimming hours, apparel and especially separate swimming areas for men and women. These regulations were too conservative and constraining for the taste of the residents of this coastal town and for several decades they were the subject of legal battles, or were simply ignored. The dispute was finally settled in 1906 when mixed bathing was permitted with the proviso that both men and women should wear suitable swimming costumes.{{sfn|Tankard|1992}}

=== 20th century ===
American president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] describes nude swims in the Potomac with his "tennis cabinet" in his ''Autobiography'': "If we swam the Potomac, we usually took off our clothes.{{sfn|Roosevelt|2014|p=53}}

[[Ernest Thompson Seton]] describes skinny dipping as one of the first activities of his [[Woodcraft Indians]], a forerunner of the [[Scouting|Scout movement]], in 1902.{{sfn|Seton|1951|p=297}}

In a 1909 New York elementary schools swimming competition, boys in the 80&amp;nbsp;lb division competed naked; their bathing suits slowed them down.{{sfn|New York Times|1909}}

==== Indoor pools ====
The [[Young Men's Christian Association]] (YMCA) was set up in 1842 with a mission to provide an education program and healthy sports to young men. The YMCA was responsible for providing swimming classes to countless numbers of American boys and teenagers. This included swimming in indoor pools. Swimming trunks were not permitted in their pools.{{sfn|Tate|2001}} In [[Lincoln, Nebraska]] in 1958, for example, learners were told just to bring a towel and not to bring trunks. In [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin]] in 1954, the Recreation Department reported that 404 youngsters had attended an 11-day swimming course where the boys were unhampered by bathing suits.{{sfn|Jarvis|1954}} When the [[YMCA]] began to admit females in the early 1960s, the wearing of bathing suits became a requirement.

In [[Portland, Ohio]] in 1915, all boys and girls wore torso swimming costumes. The problem was that [[wool]]len bathing suits were unhealthy and harboured the [[Vibrio cholerae|cholera]] [[bacteria]] and [[Rickettsia|typhus]] bacteria which infected the water in the pool. Both the cholera and the typhus diseases could be fatal. As a precaution, the pool was completely drained every 10 days. In 1910, [[slow sand filter|sand filtration]] was introduced which reduced the number of bacteria present, but the safest way was not to wear woollen suits, and this approach was endorsed by  the [[American Public Health Association]] (APHA). American [[High school#United States|high school]] and [[junior high school]] swimming in many states had policies that followed APHA guidelines. The guideline were published every three years, and from 1926 until 1962 every edition recommended nude swimming. In other states, all boys and girls bathed in clothes. The 1937 Administration of Health and Physical Recreation training manual stated, "Nude bathing for boys is practiced universally, in a few schools girls may swim nude and this is the most sanitary method."

Nude female swimming was not allowed in most schools, both for modesty reasons and because it would be awkward to accommodate menstruating girls. The [[Detroit]] public schools briefly allowed nude female swimming in 1947; this policy was revoked after three weeks due to protests from parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Thread: Old D.P.S. Policy? |url=https://www.detroityes.com/mb/showthread.php?3630-Old-D-P-S-Policy |website=DetroitYES! |publisher=© AtDetroit LLC 2000 |accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] was effective, it was difficult to manage the [[pH]] of the water, as chlorine could cause [[burning]] of the skin if wrongly administered. A simple test was devised in 1939 which made chlorination practical. [[World War II]] delayed its introduction until the early 1950s. The October 16, 1950 ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine had a large illustration of boys swimming together in the indoor pool of [[New Trier High School]] in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], and the caption did not mention they were naked.&lt;ref name="Inc1950"&gt;{{cite book|title=LIFE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CEwEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA106|date=16 October 1950|publisher=Time Inc|pages=106–|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice continued in the states that had a tradition of nude swimming.

During the 1960s, as baby boomers were entering high school, there was a growing backlash against enforced nude male swimming and by the 1970s, it had largely been phased out along with gender integration of pools. Male students protested the double standard of being required to go nude due to wool lint from swimwear clogging pool filters when it did not appear to cause a problem with girls' swim costumes. In any case, rising living standards post-World War II created a greater desire for privacy.

In some English schools, [[Manchester Grammar School]] for example, nude swimming was compulsory until the 1970s. It was discontinued when it started admitting girls.{{sfn|Cohen|2005}} This was also the case for some American high schools.{{sfn|NPR|2006}} &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Andreatta|first1=David|title=Andreatta: When boys swam nude in gym class|url=https://eu.democratandchronicle.com/story/news/local/columnists/andreatta/2017/09/22/andreatta-when-boys-swam-nude-gym-class/694542001/|accessdate=27 May 2018|work=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle|date=4 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and junior high schools and in some [[summer camps]]. John Torney in his 1937 article on Swimming and Lifesaving programs for summer camps wrote that ''boys and girls enjoy the thrill of swimming nude and costumes can be discarded for a night swim''.{{sfn|Torney|1937}} A 2006 Roper poll showed that 25% of all American adults had been skinny dipping at least once, and that 74% believed nude swimming should be tolerated at accepted locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.naturisteducation.org/Projects/NEF-Roper_Poll_2006/nef-roper_poll_2006.html | title = Roper poll online | publisher = Naturist education | year = 2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, states, counties and municipalities may enact their own dress codes, and many have. According to an Australian magazine, "In the early 1900s, women were expected to wear cumbersome dress and pantaloon combinations when swimming. In 1907, at the height of her popularity, [[Annette Kellerman]] was arrested on Revere Beach, Massachusetts, for indecency – she was wearing one of her fitted one-piece costumes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.liveandlearn.com.au/Dawn/54/herstorykellerman54.htm |work=The Dawn |issue=54 |accessdate=2010-09-27 |title=Herstory: Annette Kellerman |date=March 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051118190716/http://liveandlearn.com.au/Dawn/54/herstorykellerman54.htm |archivedate=2005-11-18|postscript= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, [[Ethelda Bleibtrey]] was arrested for nude swimming at the beach of Manhattan—she removed her stockings at a pool where it was forbidden to bare "the lower female extremities for public bathing". The subsequent public support for Bleibtrey led to the abandonment of stockings as a conventional element in women’s swimwear.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The [[1912 Summer Olympics]] in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] were the first Olympic Games to feature female swimming as an event and the costumes used, which became translucent when wet, caused somewhat of a scandal. The United States protested that the event was "obscene" and refused to send a female swim team to the Olympics. Eventually an American women's swim team participated in the [[1920 Summer Olympics]] in [[Antwerp, Belgium]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Nude swimming is fairly common in rural areas, where unexpected visitors are less likely. However, in some places even that type of swimming is prohibited by law. There is no federal law against [[nudity]]. Nude beaches, such as [[Baker Beach]] in San Francisco, operate within federal park lands in California. However, under a provision called ''[[concurrent jurisdiction]]'', [[federal park ranger]]s may enforce state and local laws, or invite local authorities to do so. Today, many swimmers in the United States confine nude swimming to private situations due to concerns about attitudes to [[public nudity]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

=== Naturist movement ===
[[File:2014 WNBR Brighton beach.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A couple at the beach in [[Brighton]], England, after completing the [[World Naked Bike Ride]], 2014]]
Since the early 20th century, the [[naturism|naturist]] movement has developed in western countries that seeks a return to non-sexual nakedness when swimming and during other appropriate activities.&lt;ref name=BNWeb &gt;{{Citation | last = | first =|  title = British Naturism (BN)| date = | url = http://www.bn.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_Id=3| issn= 0264-0406 |accessdate = 2011-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120331110705/http://www.bn.org.uk/pages/pages.asp?page_Id=3|archive-date=2012-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some places around the world, [[nude beach]]es have been set aside for people who choose to engage in normal beach activities in the nude.

== Modern prevalence ==
In many countries today nude swimming mostly takes place at nude beaches, naturist facilities, private swimming pools, or secluded or segregated public swimming areas. Some Western countries, such as Canada and the United Kingdom, have no laws prohibiting nude swimming in public areas, but some countries around the world strictly enforce various laws against [[public nudity]], including nude swimming. Some jurisdictions which maintain laws against public nudity may turn a blind eye to incidents of skinny dipping depending on the circumstances, as police officers on the spot decline to make arrests.{{sfn|Goodman|2013}}

Conflicts have arisen in the United States on federally-designated beaches, which are nevertheless patrolled by local police, since there is no federal law against nudity in these areas, but there may well be local ones. Skinny-dippers generally deal with this by keeping an eye out for local patrols, who generally do not go out of their way to find violators, as long as it is not flagrant.{{clear left}}

In Germany nude bathing is more widespread than many other countries. A 2014 study revealed Germans (28%) were the most likely of all nations surveyed to have been nude at a beach.&lt;ref&gt;Bridge, Adrian (July 14, 2017) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/germany/articles/Germans-most-likely-to-go-nude/ "Germans most likely to go nude"] ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===World Record===
The largest skinny dip was achieved during an event organized by  Deirdre Featherstone&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.facebook.com/deirdre.featherstone/ Deirdre Featherstone] &lt;/ref&gt;(Ireland). The official figure is 2,505 women and was achieved on 9 June 2018 in Wicklow, Ireland. The event was organized to raise awareness on breast cancer and to raise funds for Aoibheann’s Pink Tie
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aoibheannspinktie.ie/ Aoibheann’s Pink Tie]&lt;/ref&gt;, a National Children’s Cancer Charity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Guiness World Record |url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-skinny-dipping-%28swimming-naked%29 |website=Guiness World Record |accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:The Pursuit - Nudes Swimming by Charles Shannon.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Haslewood Shannon|Charles Shannon]], ''The Pursuit - Nudes Swimming'' (1922)]]
[[File:Saturday Evening Post 19 Aug 1911.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[J. C. Leyendecker]], ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' (August 19, 1911)]]
&lt;!--  This section needs considerable expansion : different art periods saw swimming as part of the arcadian life, as a background for figure studies, as symbolising innocence, the Golden Age, as a reflection of normality, a yearning to for free and natural sensuality {{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Margaret|title=Nude Male : a New Perspective.|date=1978|publisher=Paddington P.|location=New York and London|isbn=0-7092-0871-5|pages=238-252}} --&gt;

Nude swimming was a common subject of [[Old Masters]] – painters from before the 1800s – and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] oil paintings, usually [[bucolic]] or in a mythological or historical settings. For example, Swedish painters [[Georg Pauli]] and [[Anders Zorn]] painted a number of nude swimming scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Canu|first1=John F.|title=ART / 4 / 2DAY|url=http://www.safran-arts.com/42day/art/art4aug/art0822.html#zorn|website=www.safran-arts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{bsex|date=September 2017}}

Late in the 19th Century painters started to render nude boys and men in a realistic setting. [[Daumier]]'s ''Bathers'' shows youths clumsily hauling off their clothes (a symbol of repression) and a naked short stocky youth stepping cautiously into the water that represents freedom. [[Seurat]]'s ''Bathers Asnières'' uses similar symbolism to show the bathers removing their every day identities to step into the momentary sunlight.&lt;ref name=Walters&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walters|first1=Margaret|title=Nude Male: A New Perspective.|date=1978|publisher=Paddington P.|location=New York and London|isbn=0-7092-0871-5|pages=238–252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The bathers in [[Thomas Eakins]]' ''[[The Swimming Hole]]'' each represent different stage in the artist's life. He prepared for this canvas by taking multiple photographs of his students frolicking at this location-and overall portrays a happy physical unselfconsciousness seen through the perspective of age-a nostalgia for youth. By the 1880s this nostalgia for youth was a veneer carefully disguising a latent homosexuality. In contrast there were poets and painters who would contrast free young beauty of bodies in the water with the approaching grind of maturity and responsibility. [[Henry Tuke]] loved to paint naked bathers in a soft idealised style deliberately avoiding overt sexuality.&lt;ref name=Walters/&gt;

[[Cezanne]]'s monumental male bathers derive from memories of a happy childhood rather than direct observation. This was described by his friend [[Emile Zola]] as a time when "they were possessed with the joys of plunging (naked) into the deeper pools where the waters flowed, or spending the days stark naked in the sun, drying them selves on the burning sand, diving in once more to live in the river..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorival|first1=Bernard|title=Cezanne|date=1949|location=London|page=63|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Walters/&gt;

In later periods, depictions of nude swimming scenes became rarer, but more likely to depict straightforward contemporary scenes. The cover of the August 19, 1911 edition of the ''[[Saturday Evening Post]]'' had a [[Joseph Christian Leyendecker|Leyendecker]] painting of three boys;&lt;ref name=meyer&gt;Meyer, Susan E. "J.C. Leyendecker." In America's Great Illustrators, 136–159. New York: H. N. Abrams, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; the cover of the June 4, 1921 edition had [[Norman Rockwell]]'s painting [[:File:1921-6-4 No Swimming - Norman Rockwell.jpg|''No Swimming'']], depicting boys in various states of undress escaping from the local authorities.

The '''Nzappa zap''' (also referred to as '''zappozap''', '''kasuyu''') is a traditional [[weapon]] from [[Congo Basin|the Congo]] similar to an [[axe]] or [[hatchet]]. It has an ornate [[wrought-iron]] blade connected to a club-like wooden handle, often clad in copper, bronze or brass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Additional Images  ‹› 'Nzappa Zap' axe from upper Congo.|url=https://collection.nam.ac.uk/detail.php?acc=1960-08-15-6|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.artmetal.com/project/Features/Africa/46.htm |title=African Art - Life Force at the Anvil |author=Joyce, Tom |date=1998 |work=ArtMetal: Social Networking for the Metal Arts |accessdate=9 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://i153.photobucket.com/albums/s216/phyreblade_blog/Weapons/Nzappa%20Zap/H03M_001.jpg |title=Nzappa zap!! |author=Phyreblade |publisher=Wordpress |date=21 June 2007 |work=The Realm of the Dark Blade |accessdate=9 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Largely ceremonial, it can be used much like the [[Americas|American]] [[Tomahawk (axe)|tomahawk]], both thrown for short distances and as a [[melee weapon]] in [[hand-to-hand combat]]. It differs from the usual axe style, in that the blade mounts to looping prongs that affix to the [[wiktionary:Shaft|shaft]].

This weapon derives from the upper Congo region and was used as a brutal weapon in battle. It was usually crafted by the Nsapo people who thrived industrially from iron and copper. The axe is forged from Iron while the handle is made of wood covered in copper. This weapon yields a lot of damage when used mainly in close combat and sometimes directly thrown. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.history.com/shows/forged-in-fire/season-4/episode-11/bonus-what-is-a-nzappa-zap|title=Watch Bonus: What Is a Nzappa Zap?

The blade is also attached through a post extending from the handle. Nzappa Zaps sometimes has two or three human faces in the iron head. The axe is ceremonial and usually kept and carried by the chiefs of the Songye. The weapon holds power and significance among the people. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collection.nam.ac.uk/detail.php?acc=1960-08-15-6|title=Nzappa Zap|last=|first=|date=|website=National Army Museum|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The axe was used in battle, as a status symbol, and also as a form of currency in trade. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-saleroom.com/en-us/auction-catalogues/wallis-and-wallis/catalogue-id-srwall10028/lot-3a42f177-5403-4595-9994-a45600afeb53|title=A good Songe axe, Nzappa Zap, from the Upper Congo basin, the iron crescent blade supported by tw|last=the-saleroom.com|website=www.the-saleroom.com|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The weapon is the etymological base of the name "[[Zappo Zap]]", an infamous Songye tribal group once active in the [[Congo Free State]].

== Nature of Western civilization ==
* [[Western world]] &amp;ndash; The [[first civilization]]s made various unique contributions to the western civilizations. These contributions, which are likewise the achievements of antiquated civilizations, incorporate certain things in the zones of philosophy, art and engineering, and math and science. The antiquated civilizations were a momentous civilization in that they have made every one of these contributions and achievements while at the same time battling. The most imperative regions of Greek achievement were math and science. They accomplished a wide range of things in the territories of brain science, astronomy, geometry, science, material science, and physics. 
In philosophy, first civilizations had made numerous powerful contributions to western civilization. Greek philosophers were awesome thinkers who were resolved to look for truth to a specific subject or question regardless of where it drove them. The well-known philosophers trusted that life was not worth living unless it was inspected and the truth about existence was searched out. With a specific end goal to solve problems in life, Socrates created a method for taking care of these problems called the Socratic Method.

{{Sound change}}
In [[linguistics]], '''palatalization''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|æ|l|ə|t|ə|l|aɪ|ˈ|z|eɪ|ʃ|ən}} is a [[sound change]] that either results in a [[palatal consonant|palatal]] or [[palatalization (phonetics)|palatalized consonant]] or a [[front vowel]], or is triggered by one of them. Palatalization involves change in the [[place of articulation|place]] or [[manner of articulation]] of [[consonant]]s, or the [[fronting (phonology)|fronting]] or [[raising (phonology)|raising]] of [[vowel]]s. In some cases, palatalization involves [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] or [[lenition]].

An example of palatalization in English is one of the possible pronunciations of ''did you?'' as {{IPA|[dɪdʒuː]}} rather than {{IPA|[dɪdjuː]}}

==Types==
Palatalization is sometimes an example of [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]]. In some cases, it is triggered by a palatal or palatalized consonant or front vowel, but in other cases, it is not conditioned in any way.

===Consonant===
Palatalization changes [[place of articulation]] or [[manner of articulation]] of consonants. It may add palatal secondary articulation or change primary articulation from [[velar consonant|velar]] to palatal or [[alveolar consonant|alveolar]], alveolar to [[postalveolar consonant|postalveolar]].

It may also cause a consonant to change its manner of articulation from stop to affricate or fricative. The change in the manner of articulation is a form of [[lenition]]. However, the lenition is frequently accompanied by a change in place of articulation.
*{{IPAblink|k}} &gt; {{IPA|[kʲ]}}, {{IPAblink|c}}, {{IPAblink|tʃ}}, {{IPAblink|ts}}, {{IPAblink|ʃ}}, {{IPAblink|s}}

Palatalization of [[velar consonants|velar]] consonants commonly causes them to front, and [[apical consonant|apical]] and [[coronal consonant|coronal]] consonants are usually raised. In the process, stop consonants are often spirantised except for palatalized labials.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Palatalization, as a [[sound change]], is usually triggered only by [[Mid vowel|mid]] and [[Close vowel|close]] (high) front vowels and the [[semivowel]] {{IPA|[j]}}. The sound that results from palatalization may vary from language to language. For example, palatalization of {{IPA|[t]}} may produce {{IPA|[tʲ], [tʃ], [tɕ], [tsʲ], [ts]}}, etc. A change from {{IPA|[t]}} to {{IPA|[tʃ]}} may pass through {{IPA|[tʲ]}} as an intermediate state, but there is no requirement for that to happen.

In some [[Zoque languages]], {{IPA|[j]}} does not palatalize velar consonants but it turns alveolars into palato-alveolars. In the [[Nupe language]], {{IPA|/s/}} and {{IPA|/z/}} are palatalized both before front vowels and {{IPA|/j/}}, while velars are only palatalized before front vowels. In [[Luba-Kasai language|Ciluba]], {{IPA|/j/}} palatalizes only a preceding {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/s/}}, {{IPA|/l/}} or {{IPA|/n/}}. In some variants of [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]], velars are palatalized before {{IPA|/j/}}, but apicals are not. In [[Indo-Aryan languages]], dentals and {{IPA|/r/}} are palatalized when occurring in clusters before {{IPA|/j/}}, but velars are not.

===Vowel===
Palatalization sometimes refers to [[vowel shift]]s, the [[fronting (phonology)|fronting]] of a [[back vowel]] or [[raising (phonology)|raising]] of a [[front vowel]]. The shifts are sometimes triggered by a nearby [[palatal consonant|palatal]] or palatalized consonant or by a high front vowel. The [[Germanic umlaut]] is a famous example.

A similar change is reconstructed in the history of [[Old French]] in which [[Bartsch's law]] turned [[open vowel]]s into {{IPA|[e]}} or {{IPA|[ɛ]}} after a palatalized velar consonant. If it was true for all open vowels in Old French, it would explain the palatalization of velar plosives before {{IPA|/a/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Buckley|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Erzya language|Erzya]], a [[Uralic languages|Uralic language]], the open vowel {{IPAblink|a}} is raised to near-open {{IPAblink|æ}} after a palatalized consonant, as in the name of the language, {{IPA|[erzʲæ]}}.

In [[Russian language|Russian]], the back vowels {{IPA|/u o/}} are fronted to central {{IPA|[ʉ ɵ]}}, and the open vowel {{IPA|/a/}} is raised to near-open {{IPA|[æ]}}, near palatalized consonants. The palatalized consonants also factor in how [[vowel reduction in Russian|unstressed vowels are reduced]].

===Unconditioned===
Palatalization is sometimes unconditioned or spontaneous, not triggered by a palatal or palatalized consonant or front vowel.

In southwestern [[Romance languages|Romance]], clusters of a voiceless [[obstruent]] with {{IPA|/l/}} were palatalized once or twice. This first palatalization was unconditioned. It resulted in a cluster with a palatal lateral {{IPA|[ʎ]}}, a palatal lateral on its own, or a cluster with a palatal approximant {{IPA|[j]}}. In a second palatalization, the {{IPA|/k/}} was affricated to {{IPA|[tʃ]}} or spirantized to {{IPA|[ʃ]}}.
* [[Vulgar Latin]] {{lang|la|clāmāre}} "to call" &gt; [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]] {{lang|rup|cl'imari}} /kʎimari/, [[Aragonese language|Aragonese]] {{lang|an|clamar}} /kʎamar/, Spanish {{lang|es|llamar}} {{IPA|/ʎamar/}}, Italian {{lang|it|chiamare}} {{IPA|/kjaˈmare/}}
: &gt; [[Istriot language|Istriot]] {{lang|ist|ciamà}} {{IPA|/tʃaˈma/}}, Portuguese {{lang|pt|chamar}} {{IPA|/ʃɐˈmaɾ/}}

In the [[Western Romance languages]], Latin {{IPA|[kt]}} was palatalized once or twice. The first palatalization was unconditioned: the {{IPA|/k/}} was vocalized to {{IPA|[i̯t]}} or spirantized to {{IPA|[çt]}}. In a second palatalization, the {{IPA|/t/}} was affricated to {{IPA|[tʃ]}}:
* Vulgar Latin {{lang|la|noctem}} "night" &gt; [[French language|French]] {{lang|fr|nuit}} {{IPA|[nɥi]}}, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] {{lang|pt|noite}} {{IPA|[ˈnoj.tɨ]}}, eastern [[Occitan language|Occitan]] {{lang|oc|nuèit}}, [[Catalan language|Catalan]] {{lang|ca|nit}}, [[Mozarabic language|Mozarabic]] {{lang|mxi|noxte}} {{IPA|/noçte/}}
: &gt; Spanish {{lang|es|noche}}, western Occitan {{lang|oc|nuèch}}, [[Romansh language|Romansh]] {{lang|rm|notg}}

In many dialects of English, the back vowel {{IPA|/uː/}} is fronted to near-back {{IPA|[u̟ː]}}, central {{IPA|[ʉː]}}, or front {{IPA|[yː]}}. This vowel shift is unconditioned, happening in all cases, and not triggered by another sound.

A similar change is reconstructed for [[Ancient Greek]]. In the [[Attic Greek|Attic dialect]] before the [[Classical Greece|Classical period]], the back vowels {{IPA|/u uː/}} were fronted to {{IPA|[y yː]}}. During the [[Koine Greek|Koine]] or [[Medieval Greek]] period, they were unrounded to {{IPA|[i iː]}}, and they finally merged as short {{IPA|[i]}}, the pronunciation that they have in [[Modern Greek]].

===Anticipatory and progressive===
When palatalization is assimilatory or triggered by a consonant or vowel, it is triggered by a following sound (anticipatory) or by a preceding sound (progressive).

==Effects==

===Allophony and phonemic split===
Palatalization may result in a [[Phonological change#Phonemic splits|phonemic split]], a [[historical linguistics|historical change]] by which a [[phoneme]] becomes two new phonemes over time through palatalization.

Old historical splits have frequently drifted since the time they occurred and may be independent of current phonetic palatalization. The [[lenition]] tendency of palatalized consonants (by [[assibilation]] and deaffrication) is important. According to some analyses,&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Bhat|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; the lenition of the palatalized consonant is still a part of the palatalization process itself.

In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], allophonic palatalization affected the [[dental consonant|dental]] plosives {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}}, turning them into [[alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] affricates {{IPA|[tɕ]}} and {{IPA|[dʑ]}} before {{IPA|[i]}}, [[rōmaji|romanized]] as ⟨ch⟩ and ⟨j⟩ respectively. Japanese has, however, recently regained phonetic {{IPA|[ti]}} and {{IPA|[di]}} from loanwords, and the originally-allophonic palatalization has thus become lexical. A similar change has also happened in [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]. That would also be true about most dialects of [[Brazilian Portuguese]] but for the strong [[Phonotactics|phonotactical]] resistancy of its native speakers that turn dental plosives into post-alveolar affricates even in loanwords: McDonald's {{IPA-pt|mɛ̞kiˈdõnɐwdʑ(is)|}}.

For example, [[Votic language|Votic]] has undergone such a change historically, ''*keeli'' → {{lang|vot|tšeeli}} 'language', but there is currently an additional distinction between palatalized laminal and non-palatalized apical consonants. An extreme example occurs in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], whose palatalized ([[Hard and soft G|'soft']]) {{lang|es|g}} has ended up as {{IPA|[x]}} from a long process where Latin {{IPA|/ɡ/}} became palatalized to {{IPA|[ɡʲ]}} (Late Latin) and then affricated to {{IPA|[dʒ]}} (Proto-Romance), deaffricated to {{IPA|[ʒ]}} (Old Spanish), devoiced to {{IPA|[ʃ]}} (16th century), and finally retracted to a [[velar consonant|velar]], giving {{IPA|[x]}} (c. 1650). (See [[History of the Spanish language]] and [[Phonological history of Spanish coronal fricatives]] for more information).

==Examples==
Palatalization has played a major role in the history of English, and of other languages and language groups throughout the world, such as the [[Romance languages|Romance]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], [[Finnic languages|Finnic]], [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Mordvinic languages|Mordvinic]], [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]], [[Iranian languages|Iranian]], [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and [[Micronesian languages]].

===English===

====Anglo-Frisian====
{{details|Phonological history of Old English#Palatalization}}
In [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]], the language that gave rise to English and the [[Frisian languages]], the velar stops {{IPA|/k ɡ/}} and the [[consonant cluster]] {{IPA|/sk/}} were palatalized in certain cases and became the sounds {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, {{IPA|/dʒ/}}, {{IPA|/j/}}, and {{IPA|/ʃ/}}. Many words with Anglo-Frisian palatalization survive in Modern English, and the palatalized sounds are typically spelled {{angbr|ch}}, {{angbr|(d)ge}}, {{angbr|y}}, and {{angbr|sh}} in Modern English.

Palatalization only occurred in certain environments, and so it did not apply to all words from the same [[root (linguistics)|root]]. This is the origin of some [[alternation (linguistics)|alternations]] in [[cognate]] words, such as ''speak'' and ''speech'' {{IPA|/ˈspiːk, ˈspiːtʃ/}}, ''cold'' and ''chill'' {{IPA|/ˈkoʊld, ˈtʃɪl/}}, ''burrow'' and ''bury'' {{IPA|/ˈbʌroʊ, ˈbɛri/}}, ''dawn'' and ''day'' {{IPA|/ˈdɔːn, ˈdeɪ/}}. Here {{angbr|k}} originates from unpalatalized {{IPA|/k/}} and {{angbr|w}} from unpalatalized {{IPA|/ɡ/}}.

Some English words with palatalization have unpalatalized cognates from the [[Northumbrian dialect]] and from [[Old Norse]], such as ''shirt'' and ''skirt'' {{IPA|/ˈʃərt, ˈskərt/}}, ''church'' and ''kirk'' {{IPA|/ˈtʃərtʃ, ˈkərk/}}, ''ditch'' and ''dike'' {{IPA|/ˈdɪtʃ, ˈdaɪk/}}. [[German language|German]] only underwent [[High German consonant shift#/s/ &gt; /ʃ/|palatalization of {{IPA|/sk/}}]]: ''cheese'' {{IPA|/tʃiːz/}} and {{lang|de|Käse}} {{IPA|/kɛːzə/}}; ''lie'' and ''lay'' {{IPA|/ˈlaɪ, ˈleɪ/}}, {{lang|de|liegen}} and {{lang|de|legen}} {{IPA|/ˈliːɡən, ˈleːɡən/}}; ''fish'' and {{lang|de|Fisch}} {{IPA|/fɪʃ/}}.

The pronunciation of {{lang|ang|wicca}} as {{IPA|[ˈwɪkə]}} with a hard {{angbr|c}} is a [[spelling pronunciation]], since the actual Old English pronunciation gave rise to ''witch''.

====Yod-coalescence====
{{details|Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-coalescence}}
Later in English, another palatalization called yod-coalescence occurred. Alveolar stops and affricates were palatalized before the palatal approximant {{IPA|/j/}} so that the clusters {{IPA|/dj/}}, {{IPA|/tj/}}, {{IPA|/sj/}} and {{IPA|/zj/}} changed into {{IPA|[dʒ]}}, {{IPA|[tʃ]}}, {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}} respectively, frequently occurring with clusters that would be considered to span a syllable boundary.&lt;ref&gt;Wyld, H.C., A History of Modern Colloquial English, Blackwell 1936, cited in Wells (1982), p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt; Yod-coalescence in stressed syllables, such as in ''tune'' and ''dune'', occurs in [[Australian English phonology|Australian]], [[Cockney#Cockney speech|Cockney]], [[Estuary English]], [[Hiberno-English]] (some speakers), [[Newfoundland English]], [[South African English]], and to a certain extent in [[New Zealand English]] and [[Scottish English]] (many speakers). This can lead to additional homophony; for instance, ''dew'' and ''due'' come to be pronounced the same as ''Jew''.&lt;ref name="Schneider"&gt;Bauer, L. &amp; Warren, P. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mtd3a-56ysUC&amp;pg=PA596 New Zealand English: phonology] in Schneider, E.W. "A handbook of varieties of English: Phonology, Volume 1", [[Walter de Gruyter|Mouton De Gruyter]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain varieties—such as [[Australian English]], [[South African English]], and [[New Zealand English]]—{{IPA|/sj/}} and  {{IPA|/zj/}} in stressed syllables can coalesce into {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}}, respectively. In Australian English for example, ''assume'' is pronounced {{IPA|[əˈ'''ʃʉ'''ːm]}} by some speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Wells, John C. | author-link=John C. Wells | title=Accents of English | location=[[Cambridge]] | publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] | year=1982 | isbn=0-521-22919-7 | id=(vol. 1), {{ISBN|0-521-24224-X}} (vol. 2), {{ISBN|0-521-24225-8}} (vol. 3)|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, some speakers may palatalize the {{IPA|/s/}} to a {{IPA|/ʃ/}} when it comes before the [[Consonant cluster|cluster]] /tr/,&lt;ref&gt;Durian, David (2007) "Getting [ʃ]tronger Every Day?: More on Urbanization and the Socio-geographic Diffusion of (str) in Columbus, OH," University of Pennsylvania Working Papers in Linguistics: Vol. 13: Iss. 2, Article 6&lt;/ref&gt; so words like ''student'' and ''stress'' would be pronounced {{IPA|[ˈʃtʃuːdənt]}} and {{IPA|[ˈʃtʃɹɛs]}}, respectively, with the former pronunciation being less common among North American speakers. According to author Wayne P. Lawrence, "this phonemic change seems to be neither dialectal nor regional."&lt;ref&gt; Lawrence, Wayne P. (2000) "Assimilation at a Distance," American Speech Vol. 75: Iss. 1: 82-87; doi:10.1215/00031283-75-1-82&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hay2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jennifer Hay|title=New Zealand English|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=--eqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA37|date=6 March 2008|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-3088-2|pages=37–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other ====
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
Others include the following:
*Rhotic palatalization:
:This is found in non-rhotic dialects of New York City, according to Labov, triggered by the loss of the [[coil–curl merger]].  It results in the palatalization of /ɝ/.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Labov|1966|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (Labov never specified the resultant vowel.)
*In [[Glasgow]] and some other urban Scottish accents, {{IPA|/s/}} is given an [[apico-alveolar]] articulation, which auditorily gives an impression of a [[retraction (phonetics)|retracted]] pronunciation similar to {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Cole, J., Hualde, J.I., ''Laboratory Phonology 9'', Walter de Gruyter 2007, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Semitic languages===
==== Arabic ====
Some modern Arabic varieties developed palatalization of &lt;big&gt;[[Kaph|ك]]&lt;/big&gt; (turning {{IPA|/k/}} into {{IPAblink|tʃ}}, {{IPAblink|ts}}, {{IPAblink|ʃ}}, or {{IPAblink|s}}) and &lt;big&gt;[[Qoph|ق]]&lt;/big&gt; (turning {{IPA|/q/}} into {{IPAblink|dʒ}} or {{IPAblink|dz}}), usually when adjacent to front vowel, though these palatalizations also occurred in other environments as well. These two palatalizations occur in a variety of dialects, including [[Mesopotamian Arabic|Iraqi]], rural [[Palestinian Arabic|Palestinian]] varieties, a number of Gulf Arabic dialects,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A short reference grammar of Gulf Arabic|last=McCarus|first=Hamdi A. Qafisheh ; in consultation with Ernest N.|publisher=University of Arizona Press|year=1977|isbn=0-8165-0570-5|location=Tucson, Ariz.|page=265|chapter=Appendix II}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A short reference grammar of Gulf Arabic|last=McCarus|first=Hamdi A.

* Classical Arabic {{lang|ar|الشارقة}} ('[[Sharjah]]') {{IPA|/aʃːaːri'''q'''a/}} &gt; Gulf {{IPA|[əʃːɑːr'''d͡ʒ'''ɑ]}} while other neighboring dialects {{IPA|[aʃːaːr'''g'''a]}} without palatalization.
* Classical Arabic {{lang|ar|كلب}} ('dog') {{IPA|/'''k'''alb/}}   &gt;  Iraqi and Gulf  {{IPA|['''t͡ʃ'''alb]}}, and Najdi {{IPA|['''t͡s'''alb]}}.
* Classical Arabic {{lang|ar|ديك}} ('rooster') {{IPA|/diː'''k'''/}}  &gt; rural Palestinian {{IPA|[diː'''t͡ʃ''']}}
* Classical Arabic {{lang|ar|قربة}} ('water container') {{IPA|/'''q'''irba/}} &gt; Najdi {{IPA|['''d͡z'''ərba]}} although this phenomenon is fading among the younger generations where {{lang|ar|قربة}} is {{IPA|['''g'''irba]}} like most other dialects in Saudi Arabia.

Palatalization occurs in the pronunciation of the second person feminine singular pronoun in those dialects. For instance :

Classical Arabic {{lang|ar|عَيْنُكِ}} ('your [f.] eye') {{IPA|/ʕajnu'''k'''i/}}  is pronounced:

* {{IPA|[ʕeːnət͡ʃ]}} in Gulf, Iraqi, and rural Palestinian dialects
* {{IPA|[ʕe̞ːnət͡s]}} in Najdi and a number of [[bedouin]] dialects.
* {{IPA|[ʕe̞ːnəʃ]}} or {{IPA|[ʕe̞ːnəs]}} in some southern dialects in Saudi Arabia and Yemen.

While these dialects would pronounce {{IPA|[ʕajnu'''k'''a]}} {{lang|ar|عَيْنُكَ}} ('your [m.] eye') as {{IPA|[ʕe̞ːnək]}}, most other urban dialects would say {{IPA|[ʕeːn'''a'''k]}} (to a male) and {{IPA|[ʕeːn'''i'''k]}} (to a female).

====Assyrian Neo-Aramaic====
[[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic]] features the palatalization of [[kaph]] (turning {{IPA|/k/}} into {{IPAblink|tʃ}}), [[taw]] (turning {{IPA|/t/}} into {{IPAblink|ʃ}}) and [[gimel]] (turning {{IPA|/ɡ/}} into {{IPAblink|dʒ}}),&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Macuch Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London Vol. 53, No. 2 (1990), pp. 214-223&lt;/ref&gt; albeit in some dialects only and seldom in the standardized version of the language.&lt;ref&gt;Rudder, Joshua.

===Romance languages===
{{details|Romance languages#Palatalization}}
The [[Romance languages]] developed from [[Vulgar Latin]], the colloquial form of [[Latin]] spoken in the [[Roman Empire]]. Various palatalizations occurred during the historical development of the Romance languages. Some groups of the Romance languages underwent more palatalizations than others. One palatalization affected all groups, some palatalizations affected most groups, and one affected only a few groups.

====Gallo-Romance====
In [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]], Vulgar Latin *{{IPA|[ka]}} became *{{IPA|[tʃa]}} very early, with the subsequent deaffrication and some further developments of the vowel. For instance:
* {{lang|la|cattus}} "cat" &gt; {{lang|fr|chat}} {{IPA|/ʃa/}}
* {{lang|la|calva}} "bald" (fem.) &gt; {{lang|fr|chauve}} {{IPA|/ʃov/}}
* *{{lang|la|blanca}} "white" (fem.) &gt; {{lang|fr|blanche}} {{IPA|/blɑ̃ʃ/}}
*{{lang|la|catēna}} "chain" &gt; {{lang|fr|chaîne}} {{IPA|/ʃɛn/}}
*{{lang|la|carus}} "dear" &gt; {{lang|fr|cher}} {{IPA|/ʃɛʁ/}}

Early English borrowings from French show the original affricate, as ''chamber'' {{IPA|/ˈtʃeɪmbəɾ/}} "(private) room" &lt; Old French {{lang|fro|chambre}} {{IPA|/tʃɑ̃mbrə/}} &lt; Vulgar Latin {{lang|la|camera}}; compare French {{lang|fr|chambre}} {{IPA|/ʃɑ̃bʁ/}} "room".

====Mouillé====
'''Mouillé''' ({{IPA-fr|muje}}, "moistened") is a term for palatal consonants in the Romance languages. Palatal consonants in the Romance languages developed from {{IPAslink|l}} or {{IPAslink|n}} by palatalization.

===Satem languages===
{{main|Centum–satem isogloss}}
In certain Indo-European language groups, the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] "palato-velars" of [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]  ({{PIE|*ḱ, *ǵ, *ǵʰ}}) were palatalized into [[sibilant]]s. The language groups with and without palatalization are called satem and centum languages, after the characteristic developments of the PIE word for "hundred":
*PIE {{PIE|*(d)ḱm̥tóm}} &gt; [[Avestan language|Avestan]] ''satəm'' (palatalization)
::[[Latin]] ''{{lang|grc|centum}}'' {{IPA|/kentum/}} (no palatalization)

===Slavic languages===
{{main|Slavic first palatalization|Slavic second palatalization}}
In the Slavic languages, two palatalizations took place. Both affected the Proto-Slavic velars {{PIE|*k *g *x}}. In the first palatalization, the velars before the front vowels {{PIE|*e *ē *i *ī}} and the palatal approximant {{PIE|*j}} changed to {{PIE|*č *ž *š}}. In the second palatalization, the velars changed to ''c'', ''dz'' or ''z'', and ''s'' or ''š'' before the Proto-Slavic diphthongs {{PIE|*aj *āj}}, which must have been [[monophthongization|monophthongized]] to {{PIE|*ē}} by this time.

===Mandarin Chinese===
{{main|Mandarin Chinese#Initials|Standard Chinese phonology#Palatal series}}
In many dialects of [[Mandarin Chinese]],{{clarify|reason=Which dialects have palatalization? Varieties of Chinese says "many northern and central varieties" have palatalization of velars or alveolars or both, but is not specific.|date=February 2015}} the alveolar sibilants {{IPA|/ts tsʰ s/}} and the velars {{IPA|/k kʰ x/}} were palatalized before the [[Syllable#Chinese model|medials]] {{IPA|/j ɥ/}} and merged in pronunciation, yielding the [[alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal sibilants]] {{IPA|/tɕ tɕʰ ɕ/}}. Alveolo-palatal consonants occur in modern [[Standard Chinese]] and are written as {{angbr|{{transl|zh|ISO|j q x}}}} in [[Pinyin]]. [[Postal romanization]] does not show palatalized consonants, reflecting the [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|dialect of the imperial court]] during the [[Qing dynasty]]. For instance, the name of the capital of [[China]] was formerly spelled ''Peking'', but is now spelled ''{{transl|zh|ISO|[[Beijing|Beǐjīng]]}}'' {{audio-IPA|Zh-Beijing.ogg|[peɪ̀.tɕíŋ]|help=no}}, and ''Tientsin'' and ''Sian'' were the former spellings of ''{{transl|zh|ISO|[[Tianjin|Tiānjīn]]}}'' {{audio-IPA|Zh-Tianjin.ogg|[tʰjɛ́n.tɕín]|help=no}} and ''{{transl|zh|ISO|[[Xi'an|Xī'ān]]}}'' {{IPA|[ɕí.án]}}.

'''''Passage''''' is an outdoor 2014 art installation consisting of 38 weathered steel boat sculptures by Bill Will, installed along the [[MAX Orange Line]] in the [[Brooklyn, Portland, Oregon|Brooklyn]] neighborhood of southeast [[Portland, Oregon]], in the United States.

==Description==
Bill Will's ''Passage'' consists of 36 weathered steel boat sculptures installed adjacent to [[MAX Orange Line]] tracks along Southeast 17th Avenue between McLoughlin and Powell boulevards. According to [[TriMet]], which began installing the sculptures in March–April 2014, the "pieces draw on the natural history of the area while celebrating the Portland-Milwaukie light rail transit project's green street improvements in the corridor".&lt;ref name=Rose&gt;{{cite news|last=Rose|first=Joseph|title=TriMet installs 'Passage' public art along Portland-Milwaukie MAX line (w/ photos)|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/commuting/index.ssf/2014/04/trimet_installs_passages_publi.html|accessdate=September 9, 2015|work=[[The Oregonian]]|date=April 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project's cost was not confirmed in TriMet's announcement.&lt;ref name=Rose/&gt;

'''Pre-Code Hollywood''' refers to the brief era in the [[Cinema of the United States|American film industry]] between the widespread adoption of sound in pictures in 1929&lt;ref name="La1"&gt;LaSalle (2002), pg. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and the enforcement of the [[Motion Picture Production Code]] censorship guidelines, popularly known as the "Hays Code", in mid-1934. Although the Code was adopted in 1930, oversight was poor and it did not become rigorously enforced until July 1, 1934, with the establishment of the [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA). Before that date, movie content was restricted more by local laws, negotiations between the Studio Relations Committee (SRC) and the major studios, and popular opinion, than by strict adherence to the Hays Code, which was often ignored by Hollywood filmmakers.

As a result, some films in the late 1920s and early 1930s depicted or implied [[innuendo|sexual innuendo]], [[miscegenation]], mild [[profanity]], [[illegal drug use]], [[promiscuity]], [[prostitution]], [[infidelity]], [[abortion]], intense [[violence]], and [[homosexuality]]. Strong female characters were ubiquitous in such pre-Code films as ''[[Female (1933 film)|Female]]'', ''[[Baby Face (film)|Baby Face]]'', and ''[[Red-Headed Woman]]''. Gangsters in films like ''[[The Public Enemy]]'', ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'', and ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' were seen by many as heroic rather than evil. Along with featuring stronger female characters, films examined female subject matters that would not be revisited until decades later in US films. Nefarious characters were seen to profit from their deeds, in some cases without significant repercussions, and drug use was a topic of several films. Many of Hollywood's biggest stars such as [[Clark Gable]], [[Barbara Stanwyck]], [[Joan Blondell]], and [[Edward G. Robinson]] got their start in the era. Other stars who excelled during this period, however, like [[Ruth Chatterton]] (who decamped to England) and [[Warren William]] (the so-called "king of Pre-Code", who died in 1948), would wind up essentially forgotten by the general public within a generation.&lt;ref name="Tu371"&gt;Turan, pg. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in late 1933 and escalating throughout the first half of 1934, American [[Catholic Church in the United States|Roman Catholics]] launched a campaign against what they deemed the immorality of American cinema. This, plus a potential government takeover of film censorship and social research seeming to indicate that movies which were seen to be immoral could promote bad behavior, was enough pressure to force the studios to capitulate to greater oversight.

==Origins of the Code (1915-1930)==
[[File:Will-H-Hays.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Will H. Hays|"Will" Hays]] was recruited by the studios in 1922 to help clean up their "Sin City" image after a series of scandals, especially the [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle manslaughter trial]].&lt;ref name="SS190"/&gt;]]

===Earliest attempts for the Code===
In 1922, after some risqué films and a series of off-screen scandals involving Hollywood stars, the studios enlisted [[Presbyterian elder]] [[Will H. Hays|William H. "Will" Hays]], a figure of unblemished rectitude, to rehabilitate Hollywood's image. Hays, later nicknamed the motion picture "Czar", was paid the then-lavish sum of $100,000 a year (equivalent to more than $1.4 million in 2015 dollars).&lt;ref name="ah"&gt;Yagoda, Ben.

Harding]] and former head of the [[Republican National Committee]],&lt;ref name="SS190"&gt;Siegel &amp; Siegel, pg. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; served for 25 years as president of the [[Motion Picture Association of America|Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America]] (MPPDA), where he "defended the industry from attacks, recited soothing [[wiktionary:nostrum|nostrums]], and negotiated treaties to cease hostilities."&lt;ref name="DH6"&gt;Doherty, pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood mimicked the decision [[Major League Baseball]] had made in hiring judge [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] as [[Commissioner of Baseball|League Commissioner]] the previous year to quell questions about the integrity of baseball in wake of the [[Black Sox Scandal|1919 World Series gambling scandal]]; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Hays the "screen Landis".&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt;

Hays introduced a set of recommendations dubbed "The Formula" in 1924, which the studios were advised to heed, and asked filmmakers to describe to his office the plots of pictures they were planning.&lt;ref name="Pr20"&gt;Prince, pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court had already decided unanimously in 1915 in ''[[Mutual Film Corporation v. Industrial Commission of Ohio]]'' that free speech did not extend to motion pictures,&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, essay in Bernstein, pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; and while there had been token attempts to clean up the movies before, such as when the studios formed the [[National Association of the Motion Picture Industry]] (NAMPI) in 1916, little had come of the efforts.&lt;ref&gt;Butters Jr, pg. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Creation of the Code and its contents===

In 1929, an American Roman Catholic layman [[Martin Quigley (publisher)|Martin Quigley]], editor of the prominent trade paper ''[[Motion Picture Herald]]'', and Father [[Daniel A. Lord]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest, created a code of standards (which Hays liked immensely&lt;ref name="Sm38"&gt;Smith, pg. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;), and submitted it to the studios.&lt;ref name="DH6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pg. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord's concerns centered on the effects sound film had on children, whom he considered especially susceptible to their allure.&lt;ref name="Sm38"/&gt; Several studio heads, including [[Irving Thalberg]] of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM), met with Lord and Quigley in February 1930. After some revisions, they agreed to the stipulations of the Code. One of the main motivating factors in adopting the Code was to avoid direct government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, pg. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the responsibility of the Studio Relations Committee, headed by Colonel Jason S. Joy, to supervise film production and advise the studios when changes or cuts were required.&lt;ref name=LaSalle&gt;[[Mick LaSalle|LaSalle, Mick]]. [http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/precode.jsp "Pre-Code Hollywood"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618074036/http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/precode.jsp |date=2009-06-18 }}, GreenCine.com; accessed October 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DH8"&gt;Doherty, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Code was divided into two parts. The first was a set of "general principles" which mostly concerned morality. The second was a set of "particular applications" which was an exacting list of items that could not be depicted. Some restrictions, such as the ban on homosexuality or the use of specific curse words, were never directly mentioned but were assumed to be understood without clear demarcation. Miscegenation, the mixing of the races, was forbidden. It stated that the notion of an "adults-only policy" would be a dubious, ineffective strategy that would be difficult to enforce.&lt;ref name="DH7"&gt;Doherty, pg. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did allow that "maturer minds may easily understand and accept without harm subject matter in plots which does younger people positive harm." If children were supervised and the events implied elliptically, the code allowed what [[Brandeis University]] cultural historian Thomas Doherty called "the possibility of a [[Film|cinematically]] inspired thought crime".&lt;ref name="DH11"/&gt;

[[File:Joan Blondell banned 1932 publicity photo.jpg|thumb|right|upright|This 1932 promotional photo of [[Joan Blondell]] was later banned, under the then-unenforceable [[Motion Picture Production Code]].]]

The Code sought not only to determine what could be portrayed on screen, but also to promote traditional values.&lt;ref&gt;Butters Jr, pg. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Sexual relations outside of marriage could not be portrayed as attractive and beautiful, presented in a way that might arouse passion, nor be made to seem right and permissible.&lt;ref name=LaSalle/&gt; All criminal action had to be punished, and neither the crime nor the criminal could elicit sympathy from the audience.&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt; Authority figures had to be treated respectfully, and the clergy could not be portrayed as comic characters or villains. Under some circumstances, politicians, police officers and judges could be villains, as long as it was clear that they were the exception to the rule.&lt;ref name=LaSalle/&gt;

The entire document contained Catholic undertones and stated that art must be handled carefully because it could be "morally evil in its effects" and because its "deep moral significance" was unquestionable.&lt;ref name="DH7"/&gt; The Catholic influence on the Code was initially kept secret. {{Why?|date=January 2012}}&lt;ref name="Bl43"&gt;Black, pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; A recurring theme was "throughout, the audience feels sure that evil is wrong and good is right."&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt; The Code contained an addendum commonly referred to as the Advertising Code, which regulated film advertising copy and imagery.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Enforcement===

On February 19, 1930, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' published the entire contents of the Code and predicted that state film censorship boards would soon become obsolete.&lt;ref name="Bl44"&gt;Black, pg. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the men obligated to enforce the code — Jason Joy, who was the head of the Committee until 1932, and his successor, Dr. James Wingate — were seen as generally ineffective.&lt;ref name="DH8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bl51"&gt;Black, pg. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The very first film the office reviewed, ''[[The Blue Angel]]'', which was passed by Joy without revision, was considered indecent by a California censor.&lt;ref&gt;Black, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there were several instances where Joy negotiated cuts from films, and there were indeed definite—albeit loose—constraints, a significant amount of lurid material made it to the screen.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pg. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Joy had to review 500 films a year using a small staff and little power.&lt;ref name="Bl51"/&gt; The Hays office did not have the authority to order studios to remove material from a film in 1930, but instead worked by reasoning and sometimes pleading with them.&lt;ref name="Bl52"&gt;Black, pg. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Complicating matters, the appeals process ultimately put the responsibility for making the final decision in the hands of the studios themselves.&lt;ref name="DH8"/&gt;

One factor in ignoring the Code was the fact that some found such censorship prudish. This was a period in which the [[Victorian era]] was sometimes ridiculed as being naïve and backward.&lt;ref name=LaSalle/&gt; When the Code was announced, ''[[The Nation]]'', a liberal periodical, attacked it.&lt;ref&gt;Black, pp. 44–45.&lt;/ref&gt; The publication stated that if crime were never presented in a sympathetic light, then, taken literally, "law" and "justice" would become the same. Therefore, events such as the [[Boston Tea Party]] could not be portrayed. And if clergy were always to be presented positively, then hypocrisy could not be examined either.&lt;ref name="Bl45"&gt;Black, pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The Outlook (New York)|Outlook]]'' agreed, and, unlike ''Variety'', predicted from the beginning the Code would be difficult to enforce.&lt;ref name="Bl45"/&gt;

[[File:Thesaturdaynightkid.jpg|thumb|upright|left|{{shy|[[Clara Bow]] lifts her skirt on the poster for the 1929 film ''[[The Saturday Night Kid]]''. Skirt-lifting was one of many suggestive activities detested by Hays.&lt;ref name="screed"/&gt;}}]]

Additionally, the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s motivated studios to produce films with racy and violent content, which boosted ticket sales.&lt;ref name=LaSalle/&gt; Soon, the flouting of the code became an open secret. In 1931, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' mocked the code, and ''Variety'' followed suit in 1933. In the same year as the ''Variety'' article, a noted screenwriter stated that "the Hays moral code is not even a joke any more; it's just a memory."&lt;ref name="DH8"/&gt;

==Early sound film era==
Although the liberalization of sexuality in American film had increased during the 1920s,&lt;ref name="BG218"&gt;Benshoff &amp; Griffin, pg. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; the pre-Code era is either dated to the start of the sound film era, or more generally to March 1930, when the Hays Code was first written.&lt;ref name="La1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the protests of NAMPI,&lt;ref&gt;Black, pg. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; New York became the first state to take advantage of the Supreme Court's decision in ''Mutual Film vs. Ohio'' by instituting a censorship board in 1921. Virginia followed suit the next year,&lt;ref&gt;Butters Jr, pg. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; and eight individual states had a board by the advent of sound film.&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (1999), pg. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vieira. pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these boards were ineffectual. By the 1920s, the New York stage, a frequent source of subsequent screen material, had topless shows; performances were filled with curse words, mature subject matter, and sexually suggestive dialogue.&lt;ref name="but"&gt;Butters Jr, pg. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Early during the sound system conversion process, it became apparent that what might be acceptable in New York would not be so in Kansas.&lt;ref name="but"/&gt; In 1927, Hays suggested studio executives form a committee to discuss film censorship. [[Irving G. Thalberg]] of [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]] (MGM), [[Sol Wurtzel]] of [[Fox Film Corporation|Fox]], and E. H. Allen of [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] responded by collaborating on a list they called the "Don'ts and Be Carefuls", based on items that were challenged by local censor boards, and which consisted of eleven subjects best avoided, and twenty-six to be handled very carefully. The [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC) approved the list, and Hays created the SRC to oversee its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;Vieira, pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pr30"/&gt; However, there was still no way to enforce these tenets.&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt; The controversy surrounding film standards came to a head in 1929.&lt;ref name="La1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bu"&gt;Butters Jr, pg. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

Director [[Cecil B. DeMille]] was responsible for the increasing discussion of sex in cinema in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="SS379"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black, pp. 27–29. *Parkinson, pg. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting with ''[[Male and Female]]'' (1919), he made a series of films that examined sex and were highly successful.&lt;ref name="SS379"&gt;Siegel &amp; Siegel, pg. 379.&lt;/ref&gt; Films featuring Hollywood's original "[[It girl]]" [[Clara Bow]] such as ''[[The Saturday Night Kid]]'' (released four days before the October 29, 1929, market crash) highlighted Bow's sexual attractiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff &amp; Simmons, pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; 1920s stars such as Bow, [[Gloria Swanson]], and [[Norma Talmadge]] freely displayed their sexuality in a straightforward fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Black, pg. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hollywood during the Great Depression ==

The Great Depression presented a unique time for film-making in the United States. The economic disaster brought on by the stock market crash of 1929 changed American values and beliefs in various ways. Themes of [[American exceptionalism]] and traditional concepts of personal achievement, self-reliance, and the overcoming of odds lost great currency.&lt;ref name="DH16"&gt;Doherty, pg. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the constant empty economic reassurances from politicians in the early years of the Depression, the American public developed an increasingly jaded attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unemployed men queued outside a depression soup kitchen opened in Chicago by Al Capone, 02-1931 - NARA - 541927.jpg|thumb|right|Unemployed men in 1931. The Depression profoundly influenced pre-Code Hollywood both financially and artistically.]]

The cynicism, challenging of traditional beliefs, and political controversy of Hollywood films during this period mirrored the attitudes of many of their patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Also gone was the carefree and adventurous lifestyle of the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; "After two years the [[Jazz Age]] seems as far away as the days before the war", [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] commented in 1931.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; In the sense noted by Fitzgerald, understanding the moral climate of the early 1930s is complex. Although films experienced an unprecedented level of freedom and dared to portray things that would be kept hidden for several decades, many in America looked upon the stock market crash as a product of the excesses of the previous decade.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt; In looking back upon the 1920s, events were increasingly seen as occurring in prelude to the market crash.&lt;ref name="DH23" /&gt; In ''[[Dance, Fools, Dance]]'' (1931), lurid party scenes featuring 1920s flappers are played to excess. [[Joan Crawford]] ultimately reforms her ways and is saved; less fortunate is [[William Bakewell]], who continues on the careless path that leads to his ultimate self-destruction.&lt;ref name="DH23"&gt;Doherty, pg. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

For ''[[Rain or Shine (film)|Rain or Shine]]'' (1930), [[Milton Ager]] and [[Jack Yellin]] composed "[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]". The song was repeated sarcastically by characters in several films such as ''[[Under Eighteen]]'' (1931) and ''[[20,000 Years in Sing Sing]]'' (1933). Less comical was the picture of the United States' future presented in ''[[Heroes for Sale (film)|Heroes for Sale]]'' that same year (1933), in which a [[hobo]] looks into a depressing night and proclaims, "It's the end of America".&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Heroes for Sale'' was directed by prolific pre-Code director [[William Wellman]] and featured silent film star [[Richard Barthelmess]] as a World War I veteran cast onto the streets with a morphine addiction from his hospital stay. In ''[[Wild Boys of the Road]]'' (1933), the young man played by [[Frankie Darrow]] leads a group of dispossessed juvenile drifters who frequently brawl with the police.&lt;ref name="Tu375"&gt;Turan, pg. 375.&lt;/ref&gt; Such gangs were common; around 250,000 youths traveled the country by hopping trains or hitchhiking in search of better economic circumstances in the early 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;McElvaine (vol 1), pg. 311.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American union bank.gif|thumb|left|A crowd gathers around American Union Bank in New York City during a [[bank run]] early in the Great Depression. The [[Herd mentality|mob mentality]] displayed in bank runs was portrayed in films like ''[[American Madness]]'' (1932), where [[Frank Capra]] depicted "the thin line between investor confidence and panic in Hoover's America."&lt;ref name="DH40" /&gt;]]

Complicating matters for the studios, the advent of [[sound film]] in 1927 required an immense expenditure in sound stages, recording booths, cameras, and movie-theater sound systems, not to mention the new-found artistic complications of producing in a radically altered medium. The studios were in a difficult financial position even before the market crash as the sound conversion process and some risky purchases of theater chains had pushed their finances near the breaking point.&lt;ref name="DH17"&gt;Doherty, pg. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; These economic circumstances led to a loss of nearly half of the weekly attendance numbers and closure of almost a third of the country's theaters in the first few years of the depression. Even so, 60 million Americans went to the cinema weekly.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 18.&lt;br /&gt;* McElvaine (Vol 1), pg. 448.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the economic realities of the conversion to sound, were the artistic considerations. Early sound films were often noted for being too verbose.&lt;ref name="Tu371" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DH34"&gt;Doherty, pg. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, [[Carl Laemmle]] criticized the wall-to-wall banter of sound pictures, and director [[Ernst Lubitsch]] wondered what the camera was intended for if characters were going to narrate all the onscreen action.&lt;ref name="DH34"/&gt; The film industry also withstood competition from the home radio, and often characters in films went to great lengths to belittle the medium.&lt;ref name="DH36"&gt;Doherty, pg. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The film industry was not above using the new medium to broadcast commercials for its projects however, and occasionally turned radio stars into short feature performers to take advantage of their built-in following.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seething beneath the surface of American life in the Depression was the fear of the angry mob, portrayed in panicked hysteria in films such as ''[[Gabriel Over the White House]]'' (1933), ''[[The Mayor of Hell]]'' (1933), and ''[[American Madness]]'' (1932).&lt;ref name="DH40"&gt;Doherty, pg. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Massive wide shots of angry hordes, comprising sometimes hundreds of men, rush into action in terrifyingly efficient uniformity. Groups of agitated men either standing in breadlines, loitering in hobo camps, or marching the streets in protest became a prevalent sight during the Great Depression.&lt;ref name="DH40"/&gt; The [[Bonus Army]] protests of World War I veterans on the capital in Washington, D.C., on which Hoover unleashed a brutal crackdown, prompted many of the Hollywood depictions. Although social issues were examined more directly in the pre-Code era, Hollywood still largely ignored the Great Depression, as many films sought to ameliorate patrons' anxieties rather than incite them.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 41–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hays remarked in 1932:&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|The function of motion pictures is to ENTERTAIN. … This we must keep before us at all times and we must realize constantly the fatality of ever permitting our concern with social values to lead us into the realm of propaganda … the American motion picture … owes no civic obligation greater than the honest presentment of clean entertainment and maintains that in supplying effective entertainment, free of propaganda, we serve a high and self-sufficing purpose.}}

==Social problem films==
Hays and others, such as [[Samuel Goldwyn]], obviously felt that motion pictures presented a form of escapism that served a palliative effect on American moviegoers.&lt;ref name="DH46"&gt;Doherty, pg. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Goldwyn had coined the famous dictum, "If you want to send a message, call [[Western Union]]" in the pre-Code era.&lt;ref name="DH46"/&gt; However, the MPPDA took the opposite stance when questioned about certain so-called "message" films before Congress in 1932, claiming the audiences' desire for realism led to certain unsavory social, legal, and political issues being portrayed in film.&lt;ref name="DH49"&gt;Doherty, pg. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Warren William in Goodbye Again trailer.jpg|thumb|[[Warren William]], described by [[Mick LaSalle]] as "one of the singular joys of the Pre-Code era,"&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (2002), pg. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; played industrialist villains and other lowlife characters.]]

The length of pre-Code films was usually comparatively short,&lt;ref name="Tu370"&gt;Turan, pg. 370&lt;/ref&gt; but that running time often required tighter material and did not affect the impact of message films. ''[[Employees' Entrance]]'' (1933) received the following review from [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]]: "As an attack on ruthless capitalism, it goes a lot further than more recent efforts such as ''[[Wall Street (1987 film)|Wall Street]]'', and it's amazing how much plot and character are gracefully shoehorned into 75 minutes."&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, Jonathan. [http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/employees-entrance/Film?oid=1054057 ''Employees' Entrance'' review], ''[[Chicago Reader]]''; accessed October 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The film featured pre-Code megastar [[Warren William]] (later dubbed "the king of Pre-Code"&lt;ref name="Tu371"/&gt;), "at his magnetic worst",&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; playing a particularly vile and heartless department store manager who, for example, terminates the jobs of two long-standing male employees, one of whom commits suicide as a result. He also threatens to fire [[Loretta Young]]'s character, who pretends to be single to stay employed, unless she sleeps with him, then attempts to ruin her husband after learning she is married.&lt;ref&gt;Turan, pg. 374.&lt;/ref&gt;

Films that stated a position about a social issue were usually labeled either "propaganda films" or "preachment yarns". In contrast to Goldwyn and MGM's definitively Republican stance on social issue films, Warner Brothers, led by New Deal advocate [[Jack L. Warner]], was the most prominent maker of these types of pictures and preferred they be called "Americanism stories".&lt;ref name="DH49"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DH54"&gt;Doherty, pg. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DH79"&gt;Doherty, pg. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; Pre-Code historian Thomas Doherty has written that two recurring elements marked the so-called preachment yarns. "The first is the exculpatory preface; the second is the [[Jazz Age]] prelude."&lt;ref name="DH50"&gt;Doherty, pg. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; The preface was essentially a softened version of a disclaimer that intended to calm any in the audience who disagreed with the film's message. The Jazz Age prelude was almost singularly used to cast shame on the boisterous behavior of the 1920s.&lt;ref name="DH50"/&gt;

''[[Cabin in the Cotton]]'' (1932) is a Warner Bros. message film about the evils of capitalism. The film takes place in an unspecified southern state where workers are given barely enough to survive and taken advantage of by being charged exorbitant interest rates and high prices by unscrupulous landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; The film is decidedly anti-capitalist;&lt;ref name="DH51"&gt;Doherty, pg. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; however, its preface claims otherwise:&lt;ref name="DH50" /&gt;{{quote|In many parts of the South today, there exists an endless dispute between rich land-owners, known as planters, and the poor cotton pickers, known as "peckerwoods". The planters supply the tenants with the simple requirements of everyday life and; in return, the tenants work the land year in and year out. A hundred volumes could be written on the rights and wrongs of both parties, but it is not the object of the producers of ''Cabin in the Cotton'' to take sides. We are only concerned with the effort to picture these conditions.}} In the end, however, the planters admit their wrongdoing and agree to a more equitable distribution of capital.&lt;ref name="DH51" /&gt;

[[File:Claudette Colbert in It Happened One Night.jpg|thumb|left|A famous scene from ''[[It Happened One Night]]'', in which [[Claudette Colbert]] hitchhikes using an unorthodox method to attract a ride, after [[Clark Gable]]'s failure to get one with his thumb.]]

The avaricious businessman remained a recurring character in pre-Code cinema. In ''[[The Match King]]'' (1932), [[Warren William]] played an industrialist based on real-life Swedish entrepreneur [[Ivar Kreuger]], himself nicknamed the "Match King", who attempts to corner the global market on matches. William's vile character, Paul Kroll, commits robbery, fraud, and murder on his way from a janitor to a captain of industry.&lt;ref name="DH59"&gt;Doherty, pg. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dave Kehr|Kehr, Dave]]. [https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0D13FE35540C778DDDAE0894DA404482 The Nation; Seeing Business Through Hollywood's Lens], ''The New York Times'', July 14, 2002; accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; When the market collapses in the 1929 crash, Kroll is ruined and commits suicide to avoid imprisonment.&lt;ref name="DH59"/&gt; William played another unscrupulous businessman in ''[[Skyscraper Souls]]'' (1932): David Dwight, a wealthy banker who owns a building named after himself that is larger than the [[Empire State Building]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Mordaunt Hall|Hall, Mourdant]].

Americans' mistrust and dislike of lawyers was a frequent topic of dissection in social problem films such ''[[Lawyer Man]]'' (1933), ''[[State's Attorney (1932 film)|State's Attorney]]'', and ''[[The Mouthpiece]]'' (1932). In films such as ''[[Paid (1930 film)|Paid]]'' (1930), the legal system turns innocent characters into criminals. The life of [[Joan Crawford]]'s character is ruined and her romantic interest is executed so that she may live free, although she is innocent of the crime for which the district attorney wants to convict her.&lt;ref name="DH60"&gt;Doherty, pg. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious hypocrisy was addressed in such films as ''[[The Miracle Woman]]'' (1931), starring [[Barbara Stanwyck]] and directed by [[Frank Capra]]. Stanwyck also portrayed a nurse and initially reluctant heroine who manages to save, via unorthodox means, two young children in danger from nefarious characters (including [[Clark Gable]] as a malevolent chauffeur) in ''[[Night Nurse (1931 film)|Night Nurse]]'' (1931).&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many pre-Code films dealt with the economic realities of a country struggling to find its next meal. In ''[[Blonde Venus]]'' (1932), [[Marlene Dietrich]]'s character resorts to prostitution to feed her child, and [[Claudette Colbert]]'s character in ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934) gets her comeuppance for throwing a tray of food onto the floor by later finding herself without food or financial resources.&lt;ref name="DH56"&gt;Doherty, pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joan Blondell]]'s character in ''[[Big City Blues (1932 film)|Big City Blues]]'' (1932) reflects that as a [[chorus girl]] she regularly received diamonds and pearls as gifts, but now must content herself with a corned beef sandwich.&lt;ref name="DH56" /&gt; In ''[[Union Depot (film)|Union Depot]]'' (1932), [[Douglas Fairbanks Jr.]] puts a luscious meal as the first order of business on his itinerary after coming into money.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 57–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political releases===
[[File:Gabriel-over-the-white-house.jpg|thumb|In the pre-Code film ''[[Gabriel Over the White House]]'' (1933), a U.S. President makes himself dictator{{snd}}part of what the 1930s trade papers dubbed the "dictator craze".]]

Given the social circumstances, politically oriented social problem films ridiculed politicians and portrayed them as incompetent bumblers, scoundrels, and liars.&lt;ref name="DH63"&gt;Doherty, pg. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Dark Horse (1932 film)|The Dark Horse]]'' (1932), [[Warren William]] is again enlisted, this time to get an imbecile, who is accidentally in the running for Governor, elected. The candidate wins the election despite his incessant, embarrassing mishaps. ''[[Washington Merry-Go-Round (film)|Washington Merry-Go-Round]]'' portrayed the state of a political system stuck in neutral.&lt;ref name="DH63"/&gt; [[Columbia Pictures]] nearly released the film with a scene of the public execution of a politician as the climax before deciding to cut it.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cecil B. DeMille]] released ''[[This Day and Age (film)|This Day and Age]]'' in 1933, and it stands in stark contrast to his other films of the period. Filmed shortly after DeMille had completed a five-month tour of the [[Soviet Union]], ''This Day and Age'' takes place in America and features several children torturing a gangster who got away with the murder of a popular local shopkeeper.&lt;ref name="DH65"&gt;Doherty, pg. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monahan, Kaspar. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=T_8cAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jY4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4282,584441&amp;dq=this-day-and-age+demille&amp;hl=en "High Schoolers Smash Rule Of Gangland – Save City From Mobsters In DeMille Film At Penn"], ''[[The Pittsburgh Press]]'', September 16, 1933; accessed October 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The youngsters are seen lowering the gangster into a vat of rats when the police arrive, and their response is to encourage the youths to continue this. The film ends with the youngsters taking the gangster to a local judge and forcing the magistrate to conduct a trial in which the outcome is never in doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

The need for strong leaders who could take charge and steer America out of its crisis is seen in ''[[Gabriel Over the White House]]'' (1933), about a benevolent dictator who takes control of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Black, pg. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walter Huston]] stars as a weak-willed, ineffectual president (likely modeled after Hoover) who is inhabited by the archangel [[Gabriel]] upon being knocked unconscious.&lt;ref name="DH735"&gt;Doherty, pp. 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Mordaunt. [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=1&amp;res=9401E3DD1438E333A25752C0A9629C946294D6CF&amp;partner=Rotten%20Tomatoes ''Gabriel Over the White House'' review in ''The New York Times''], April 1, 1933; accessed October 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The spirit's behavior is similar to that of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. The president solves the nation's unemployment crisis and executes an [[Al Capone]]-type criminal who has continually flouted the law.&lt;ref name="DH735"/&gt;

Dictators were not just glorified in fiction. Columbia's ''[[Mussolini Speaks]]'' (1933) was a 76-minute paean to the [[Fascism|Fascist]] leader, narrated by NBC radio commentator [[Lowell Thomas]]. After showing some of the progress Italy has made during [[Il Duce]]'s 10-year reign, Thomas opines, "This is a time when a dictator comes in handy!"&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was viewed by over 175,000 jubilant people during its first two weeks at the cavernous [[Palace Theatre (Albany, New York)|Palace Theater]] in [[Albany, New York]].&lt;ref name="DH77"&gt;Doherty, pg. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The election of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (FDR) in 1932 quelled the public affection for dictators.&lt;ref name="DH77"/&gt; As the country became increasingly enthralled with FDR, who was featured in countless [[newsreel]]s, it exhibited less desire for alternative forms of government.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Hollywood films reflected this new optimism. ''Heroes for Sale'', despite being a tremendously bleak and at times anti-American film, ends on a positive note as the New Deal appears as a sign of optimism.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; When ''[[Wild Boys of the Road]]'' (1933), directed by [[William Wellman]], reaches its conclusion, a dispossessed juvenile delinquent is in court expecting a jail sentence. However the judge lets the boy go free, revealing to him the symbol of the New Deal behind his desk, and tells him "[t]hings are going to be better here now, not only here in New York, but all over the country."&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; A box-office casualty of this hopefulness was ''Gabriel Over the White House'', which entered production during the Hoover era malaise and sought to capitalize on it. By the time the film was released on March 31, 1933, FDR's election had produced a level of hopefulness in America that rendered the film's message obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 75.&lt;br/&gt;*Black, pg. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Adolf Hitler]]'s rise to power in Germany and his regime's anti-Semitic policies significantly affected American pre-Code filmmaking. Although Hitler had become unpopular in many parts of the United States, Germany was still a voluminous importer of American films and the studios wanted to appease the German government.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; The ban on Jews and negative portrayals of Germany in the Fatherland even led to a significant reduction in work for Jews in Hollywood until after the end of World War II. As a result, only two social problem films released by independent film companies addressed the mania in Germany during the pre-Code era (''[[Are We Civilized?]]'' and ''[[Hitler's Reign of Terror]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, [[Herman J. Mankiewicz]] and producer [[Sam Jaffe (producer)|Sam Jaffe]] announced they were working on a picture, to be titled ''Mad Dog of Europe'', which was intended to be a full-scale attack on Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt; Jaffe had quit his job at [[RKO Pictures]] to make the film. Hays summoned the pair to his office and told them to cease production as they were causing needless headaches for the studios.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany had threatened to seize all the properties of the Hollywood producers in Germany and ban the import of any future American films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jta.org/1933/10/23/archive/charges-nazis-here-using-threats-to-halt-production-of-mad-dog-of-europe|title=Charges Nazis Here Using Threats to Halt Production of "mad Dog of Europe"|work=Jta.org|date=1933-10-23|accessdate=2013-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/books/scholar-asserts-that-hollywood-avidly-aided-nazis.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 "Scholar asserts that Hollywood avidly aided Nazis"], nytimes.com, June 26, 2013; accessed December 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime films==
{{Main|Pre-Code crime films}}

In the early 1900s, the United States was still primarily a rural country, especially in self-identity.&lt;ref name="SS165"&gt;Siegel &amp; Siegel, pg. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; [[D. W. Griffith]]'s ''[[The Musketeers of Pig Alley]]'' (1912) is one of the earliest American films to feature urban organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;Shadoian, pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Prohibition's arrival in 1920 created an environment where anyone who wanted to drink had to consort with criminals,&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; especially in urban areas. Nonetheless, the urban-crime genre was mostly ignored until 1927 when ''[[Underworld (1927 film)|Underworld]]'', which is recognized as the first gangster movie,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dave Kehr|Kehr, Dave]]. [http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/underworld/Film?oid=1049074 ''Underworld'' (film) review], ''Chicago Reader''; accessed October 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; became a surprise hit.

According to the ''Encyclopedia of Hollywood'' entry on ''Underworld'', "The film established the fundamental elements of the gangster movie: a hoodlum hero; ominous, night-shrouded city streets; floozies; and a blazing finale in which the cops cut down the protagonist". Gangster films such as ''[[Thunderbolt (1929 film)|Thunderbolt]]'' (1929), and ''[[Doorway to Hell]]'' (1930) were released to capitalize on ''Underworld''{{'}}s popularity,&lt;ref name="SS165"/&gt; with ''Thunderbolt'' being described as "a virtual remake" of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, pg. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Other late 1920s crime films investigated the connection between mobsters and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] productions in movies such as ''[[Lights of New York (1928 film)|Lights of New York]]'' (1928), ''[[Tenderloin (film)|Tenderloin]]'' (1928) and ''[[Broadway (1929 film)|Broadway]]'' (1929).&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hays Office had never officially recommended banning violence in any form in the 1920s—unlike profanity, the drug trade or prostitution—but advised that it be handled carefully.&lt;ref name="Pr20"/&gt; New York's censor board was more thorough than that of any other state, missing only around 50 of the country's 1,000 to 1,300 annual releases.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, pg. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1927 to 1928, violent scenes removed were those in which a gun was pointed at the camera or "at or into the body of another character". Many shots where machine guns were featured, scenes where criminals shot at law enforcement officers, some scenes involving stabbing or knife brandishing (audiences considered stabbings more disturbing than shootings), most whippings, several involving choking, torture, or electrocution, and any scenes which could be considered educational in their depiction of crime methods. Sadistic violence and reaction shots showing the faces of individuals on the receiving end of violence were considered especially sensitive areas.&lt;ref&gt;Prince, pp. 23–28.&lt;/ref&gt; The Code later recommended against scenes showing robbery, theft, safe-cracking, arson, "the use of firearms", "dynamiting of trains, machines, and buildings", and "brutal killings", on the basis that they would be rejected by local censors.&lt;ref name="Pr30"&gt;Prince, pg. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Muni Scarface 2.JPG|thumb|The public's fascination with gangsters in the early 1930s was bolstered by the extensive news coverage of criminals like [[Al Capone]] and [[John Dillinger]], upon whom were based such characters as ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'', portrayed by [[Paul Muni]] (1932).]]

===Birth of the Hollywood gangster===
{{quote|No motion picture genre of the Pre-Code era was more incendiary than the gangster film; neither preachment yarns nor vice films so outraged the moral guardians or unnerved the city fathers as the high caliber scenarios that made screen heroes out of stone killers.&lt;ref name="DH139"/&gt;|Pre-Code historian Thomas P. Doherty}}

In the early 1930s, several real-life criminals became celebrities. Two in particular captured the American imagination: [[Al Capone]] and [[John Dillinger]]. Gangsters like Capone had transformed the perception of entire cities.&lt;ref name="DH139"&gt;Doherty, pg. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; Capone gave Chicago its "reputation as the locus classicus of American gangsterdom, a cityscape where bullet-proof roadsters with tommygun-toting hoodlums on running boards careened around State Street spraying fusillades of slugs into flower shop windows and mowing down the competition in blood-spattered garages". Capone appeared on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine in 1930.&lt;ref name="DH139"/&gt; He was even offered 7-figure sums by two major Hollywood studios to appear in a film but declined.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dillinger became a national celebrity as a bank robber who eluded arrest and escaped confinement several times. He had become the most celebrated public outlaw since [[Jesse James]].&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 137.&lt;/ref&gt; His father appeared in a popular series of newsreels giving police homespun advice on how to catch his son. Dillinger's popularity rose so quickly that ''Variety'' joked that "if Dillinger remains at large much longer and more such interviews are obtained, there may be some petitions circulated to make him our president."&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Hays wrote a cablegram to all the studios in March 1934 mandating that Dillinger not be portrayed in any motion picture.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 137–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre entered a new level following the release of ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' (1931), which featured [[Edward G. Robinson]] as gangster Rico Bandello.&lt;ref name="SS165"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Siegel &amp; Siegel, pg. 359.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Caesar'', along with ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' starring [[James Cagney]] as Tom Powers and ''[[Scarface (1932 film)|Scarface]]'' (1932), featuring [[Paul Muni]] as Tony Comante, were, by standards of the time, incredibly violent films that created a new type of anti-hero. Nine gangster films were released in 1930, 26 in 1931, 28 in 1932, and 15 in 1933, when the genre's popularity began to subside after the end of Prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;Black, pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The backlash against gangster films was swift. In 1931, Jack Warner announced that his studio would stop making them and that he himself had never allowed his 15-year-old son to see them.&lt;ref&gt;Leitch, pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

After he had finished his work, Vollmer stated that gangster films were innocuous and even overly favorable in depicting the police.&lt;ref name="Bl123"&gt;Black, pg. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Hays used the results to defend the film industry,&lt;ref name="Bl123"/&gt; the New York State censorship board was not impressed, and from 1930 through 1932, removed 2,200 crime scenes from pictures.&lt;ref name="Sm51"&gt;Smith, pg. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Scarface'' provoked outrage mainly because of its unprecedented violence, but also for its shifts of tone from serious to comedic.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 149–50.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dave Kehr]], writing in the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', stated that the film blends "comedy and horror in a manner that suggests Chico Marx let loose with a live machine gun."&lt;ref name="CR"&gt;Kehr, Dave.[http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/scarface/Film?oid=1150143 ''Scarface'' review at ''Chicago Reader'']; accessed October 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In one scene, Camonte is inside a cafe while a torrent of machine-gun fire from the car of a rival gang is headed his way; when the barrage is over, Camonte picks up one of the newly released [[tommy gun]]s the gangsters dropped and exhibits childlike wonder and unrestrained excitement over the new toy.&lt;ref name="DH150"/&gt; Civic leaders became furious that gangsters like Capone (who was also the inspiration for ''Little Caesar'')&lt;ref name="Film4"&gt;[http://www.film4.com/reviews/1931/little-caesar Little Caesar review at Film4.com]; accessed October 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; were being applauded in movie houses all across America.&lt;ref name="SS165"/&gt; The screenplay, adapted by Ben Hecht who was a journalist in Chicago, contained biographical details for Muni's character in ''Scarface'' that were so obviously taken from Capone, and the detail so close, that it was impossible not to draw the parallels.&lt;ref name="DH148"/&gt;

One of the factors that made gangster pictures so subversive was that, in the difficult economic times of the Depression, there already existed the viewpoint that the only way to get financial success was through crime.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Kansas City Times]]'' argued that although adults may not be particularly affected, these films were "misleading, contaminating, and often demoralizing to children and youth."&lt;ref&gt;Black, pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Exacerbating the problem, some cinema theater owners advertised gangster pictures with a singular irresponsibility. Real-life murders were tied into promotions and "theater lobbies displayed tommy guns and [[Baton (law enforcement)|blackjacks]]".&lt;ref name="DH153"&gt;Doherty, pg. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; The situation reached such a nexus that the studios had to ask exhibitors to tone down the gimmickry in their promotions.&lt;ref name="DH153"/&gt;

===Prison films===
Prison films of the pre-Code era often involved men who were unjustly incarcerated, and films set in prisons of the north tended to portray them as a bastion of solidarity against the crumbling social system of the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]].&lt;ref name="DH158"&gt;Doherty, pg. 158&lt;/ref&gt; Sparked by the real-life Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930, in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells, causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions inside prisons in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name="DH158"/&gt; The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the [[chain gang]] film.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 159&lt;/ref&gt; In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pp. 159–160&lt;/ref&gt; In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconian system of discipline in the blazing outdoor heat, where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors.&lt;ref name="DH158"/&gt;

[[File:Muni Chain Ganger.JPG|thumb|''I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang'' (starring Paul Muni, 1932) was based on [[I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!|the autobiographical memoirs]] of [[Robert Elliott Burns|Robert E. Burns]], who was himself a fugitive when the picture was released. The film proved to be a powerful catalyst for later criminal-justice and social reforms.]]

The prototype of the prison genre was ''The Big House'' (1930).&lt;ref&gt;Druker, Don. [http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/the-big-house/Film?oid=1055698 The Big House], ''Chicago Reader'', accessed October 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Big House'', [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]] plays a squirmy inmate who is sentenced to six years after committing vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. His cell mates are a murderer played by [[Wallace Beery]] and a forger played by [[Chester Morris]]. The picture features future staples of the prison genre such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, visitations, an escape, and the codes of prison life. The protagonist, Montgomery, ends up being a loathsome character, a coward who will sell out anyone in the prison to get an early release.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 160&lt;/ref&gt; The film was banned in Ohio, the site of the deadly prison riots that inspired it.&lt;ref name="Doherty. pg. 170"&gt;Doherty, pg. 170&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Numbered Men]]'', ''[[The Criminal Code]]'', ''[[Shadow of the Law]]'', ''[[Convict's Code]]'', and others, from no less than seven studios, followed.&lt;ref&gt;Black, pp. 158–159&lt;/ref&gt; However, prison films mainly appealed to men, and had weak box office performances as a result.&lt;ref name="Doherty. pg. 170"/&gt;

Studios also produced children's prison films that addressed the juvenile delinquency problems of America in the Depression. ''The Mayor of Hell'', for instance, featured kids killing a murderously abusive reform school overseer without retribution.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 169&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chain gang films====

The most searing criticism of the American prison system was reserved for the depiction of Southern chain gangs, with ''[[I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang]]'' being by far the most influential.&lt;ref&gt;Wollstein, Hans J. [https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/94754/Hell-s-Highway/overview REVIEW: ''Hell's Highway''], nytimes.com; accessed October 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

''I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang'', which is based on [[I Am a Fugitive from a Georgia Chain Gang!|the true story]] of [[Robert Elliott Burns|Robert E. Burns]], is by far the most famous of the early 1930s chain gang films.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 163&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of 1931, ''[[True Detective (magazine)|True Detective Mysteries]]'' magazine had published Burns' work over six issues, and it was released as a book in January 1932.&lt;ref&gt;Niemi, pg. 381&lt;/ref&gt; Decorated veteran James Allen ([[Paul Muni]]) returns from World War I a changed man, and seeks an alternative to the tedious job that he left behind. He travels the country looking for construction work. His ultimate goal is to become involved in construction planning. Allen follows a hobo he met at a homeless shelter into a cafe, taking him up on his offer of a free meal. When the hobo attempts to rob the eatery, Allen is charged as an accessory, convicted of stealing a few dollars, and sentenced to ten years in a chain gang. The men are chained together and transported to a quarry to break rocks every day. Even when unchained from each other, shackles remain around their ankles at all times. Allen convinces a large black prisoner who has particularly good aim to hit the shackles on his ankles with a sledgehammer to bend them. He removes his feet from the bent shackles, and in a famous sequence, escapes through the woods while being chased by bloodhounds. On the outside he develops a new identity and becomes a respected developer in Chicago. He is blackmailed into marriage by a woman he does not love who finds out his secret. When he threatens to leave her for a young woman he has fallen in love with, she turns him in. His case becomes a [[cause célèbre]], and he agrees to turn himself in under the agreement that he will serve 90 days and then be released. He is tricked however, and not freed at the agreed upon time. This forces him to escape again, and he seeks out the young woman, telling her that they cannot be together because he will always be hunted. The film ends with her asking him how he survives, and his ominous reply from the darkness: "I steal."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mervyn LeRoy|LeRoy, Mervyn]]. ''I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang'' (1932) United States: Warner Bros.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although based on reality, ''Chain Gang'' changes the facts slightly to appeal to Depression-era audiences by making Allen's return home one to a country that is struggling economically, even though Burns returned to the roaring twenties.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 164&lt;/ref&gt; The film's bleak, anti-establishment ending shocked audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty. pg. 166&lt;/ref&gt; ''Laughter in Hell'', a 1933 film directed by [[Edward L.

===Promotion===
As films featuring prurient elements performed well at the box office, after the crackdown on crime films,&lt;ref&gt;Vasey, pg. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood increased its production of pictures featuring the [[seven deadly sins]].&lt;ref name="DH103"&gt;Doherty, pg. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Warner Bros formed an official policy decreeing that "two out of five stories should be hot", and that nearly all films could benefit by "adding something having to do with ginger."&lt;ref name="DH104"&gt;Doherty, pg. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmakers (including the shrewd [[Mae West]]) began putting in overly suggestive material they knew would never reach theaters in hopes that lesser offenses would survive the cutting-room floor. MGM screenwriter [[Donald Ogden Stewart]] said "[Joy and Wingate] wouldn't want to take out too much, so you would give them five things to take out to satisfy the Hays Office—and you would get away with murder with what they left in."&lt;ref name="Vi130"&gt;Vieira, pg. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

Films such as ''[[Laughing Sinners]]'', ''[[The Devil's Holiday]]'', ''[[Safe in Hell]]'', ''[[The Devil Is Driving (1932 film)|The Devil is Driving]]'', ''[[Merrily We Go to Hell]]'', ''[[Laughter in Hell]]'', and ''[[The Road to Ruin (1934 film)|The Road to Ruin]]'' were provocative in their mere titles.&lt;ref name="DH103"/&gt; Studios marketed their films, sometimes dishonestly, by inventing suggestive tag lines and lurid titles, even going so far as to hold in-house contests for thinking up provocative titles for screenplays.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 107–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly labeled "sex films" by the censors, these pictures offended taste in more categories than just sexuality.&lt;ref name="DH103"/&gt; According to a ''Variety'' analysis of 440 pictures produced in 1932–33, 352 had "some sex slant", with 145 possessing "questionable sequences", and 44 being "critically sexual". ''Variety'' summarized that "over 80% of the world's chief picture output was … flavored with bedroom essence."&lt;ref name="DH104"/&gt; Attempts to create films for adults only (dubbed "pinking") wound up bringing large audiences of all ages to cinemas.&lt;ref name="Sm56"/&gt;
[[File:Ina Claire of The Greeks Had a Word for Them 3.jpg|thumb|left|Some objected to publicity photos such as this 1932 shot of [[Ina Claire]] posing suggestively on a bed.]]
Posters and publicity photos were often tantalizing.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 110–11.&lt;/ref&gt; Women appeared in poses and garb not even glimpsed in the films themselves. In some cases actresses with small parts in films (or in the case of Dolores Murray in her publicity still for ''[[The Common Law (film)|The Common Law]]'', no part at all) appeared scantily clad.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Hays became outraged at the steamy pictures circulating in newspapers around the country.&lt;ref name="DH111"&gt;Doherty, pg. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; The original Hays Code contained an often-ignored note about advertising imagery, but he wrote an entirely new advertising screed in the style of the [[Ten Commandments]] that contained a set of twelve prohibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 107, 110–12.&lt;/ref&gt; The first seven addressed imagery. They prohibited women in undergarments, women raising their skirts, suggestive poses, kissing, necking, and other suggestive material. The last five concerned advertising copy and prohibited misrepresentation of the film's contents, "salacious copy", and the word "[[courtesan]]".&lt;ref name="screed"&gt;Doherty, pp. 111–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Studios found their way around the restrictions and published increasingly racy imagery. Ultimately this backfired in 1934 when a billboard in Philadelphia was placed outside the home of [[Cardinal Dougherty|Cardinal Dennis Dougherty]]. Severely offended, Dougherty took his revenge by helping to launch the motion-picture boycott which would later facilitate enforcement of the Code.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt; A commonly repeated theme by those supporting censorship, and one mentioned in the Code itself&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in Jacobs, pg. 10: "Most arts appeal to the mature. This art appeals at once to every class, mature, immature, developed, underdeveloped, law abiding, criminal. Music has its grades for different classes; so has literature and drama. This art of the motion picture, combining as its does the two fundamental appeals of looking at a picture and listening to a story, at once reached [sic] every class of society. [Thus] it is difficult to produce films intended for only certain classes of people .... Films, unlike books and music, can with difficulty be confined to certain selected groups"&lt;/ref&gt; was the notion that the common people needed to be saved from themselves by the more refined cultural elite.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 106–07.&lt;br/&gt;Massey, pg. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the obvious attempts to appeal to red-blooded American males, most of the patrons of sex pictures were female. ''Variety'' squarely blamed women for the increase in vice pictures:&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Women are responsible for the ever-increasing public taste in sensationalism and sexy stuff. Women who make up the bulk of the picture audiences are also the majority reader of the tabloids, scandal sheets, flashy magazines, and erotic books … the mind of the average man seems wholesome in comparison. … Women love dirt, nothing shocks 'em.}}

Pre-Code female audiences liked to indulge in the carnal lifestyles of mistresses and adulteresses while at the same time taking joy in their usually inevitable downfall in the closing scenes of the picture.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; While gangster films were claimed to corrupt the morals of young boys, vice films were blamed for threatening the purity of adolescent women.&lt;ref name="Sm56"&gt;Smith, pg. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content===
In pre-Code Hollywood, the sex film became synonymous with women's pictures — [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] once told Wingate that he was ordered by Warner Brothers' New York corporate office to reserve 20% of the studio's output for "women's pictures, which inevitably means sex pictures."&lt;ref name="Vi118"&gt;Vieira, pg. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Vice films typically tacked on endings where the most sin-filled characters were either punished or redeemed. Films explored Code-defying subjects in an unapologetic manner with the premise that an end-reel moment could redeem all that had gone before.&lt;ref name="DH113"&gt;Doherty, pg. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of marriage was often tested in films such as ''[[The Prodigal (1931 film)|The Prodigal]]'' (1931), in which a woman is having an affair with a seedy character, and later falls in love with her brother-in-law. When her mother-in-law steps in at the end of the film, it is to encourage one son to grant his wife a divorce so she can marry his brother, with whom she is obviously in love. The older woman proclaims the message of the film in a line near the end: "This the twentieth century. Go out into the world and get what happiness you can."&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 113–114.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Madame Satan]]'' (1930), adultery is explicitly condoned and used as a sign for a wife that she needs to act in a more enticing way to maintain her husband's interest.&lt;ref name="DH114"&gt;Doherty, pg. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Secrets (1933 film)|Secrets]]'' (1933), a husband admits to serial adultery, only this time he repents and the marriage is saved.&lt;ref name="DH114"/&gt; The films took aim at what was already a damaged institution. During the Great Depression, relations between spouses often deteriorated due to financial strain, marriages lessened, and husbands abandoned their families in increased numbers.&lt;ref&gt;McElvaine (Vol 2), pg. 1055.&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage rates continually declined in the early 1930s, finally rising in 1934, the final year of the pre-Code era, and although divorce rates lowered, this is likely because desertion became a more common method of separation.&lt;ref&gt;McElvaine (Vol 1), pp. 310–311.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, female characters, such as [[Ruth Chatterton]]'s in ''[[Female (1933 film)|Female]]'', live promiscuous bachelorette lifestyles, and control their own financial destiny (Chatterton supervises an auto factory) without regret.&lt;ref name="Vi118"/&gt;

In ''[[The Divorcee]]'' (1930), starring [[Norma Shearer]], a wife discovers that her husband (played by Chester Morris), has been cheating on her. In reaction, she decides to have an affair with his best friend  (played by [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]). When the husband finds out, he decides to leave her. After pleading with him to stay, the wife unleashes her frustrations upon him, and in a moment of inspiration reveals her desire to live a fearless, sexually liberated life without him. According to at least one film historian, {{Who|date=November 2016}} this was the motion picture that inspired other films centering upon sophisticated female protagonists, who stayed out late, had affairs, wore revealing gowns, and who basically destroyed the sexual double standard by asserting themselves both within society and in the bedroom. From ''[[The Divorcee]]'' onward, there developed "a trend toward a sophistication in women's pictures that would continue unabated until the end of the Pre-Code era in mid-1934.&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle M. (2000). ''Complicated Women: Sex and Power in Pre-Code Hollywood''. New York, NY: St. Martin's Press, page 12.&lt;!--ISSN/ISBN needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most prominent examples of punishment for immoral transgressions in vice film can be seen in ''[[The Story of Temple Drake]]'', based on the [[William Faulkner]] novel ''[[Sanctuary (Faulkner novel)|Sanctuary]]''. In ''Drake'', the title character (played by [[Miriam Hopkins]]), a cold, vapid "party girl", the daughter of a judge, &lt;!-- no need to delete; I browsed Doherty's book in the library today and the words added are his --&gt;is raped and forced into prostitution by a backwoods character, and according to pre-Code scholar Thomas Doherty, the film implies that the deeds done to her are in recompense for her immorality.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 117–118.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in court, she confesses that she killed the man who raped and kept her.

In 1933 her studio, Paramount, signed a largely ineffectual agreement not to depict women in men's clothes in their films.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Female protagonists in aggressively sexual vice films were usually of two general kinds: the bad girl or the fallen woman.&lt;ref name="DH131"&gt;Doherty, pg. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; In so-called "bad girl" pictures, female characters profited from promiscuity and immoral behavior.&lt;ref name="DH132"&gt;Doherty, pg. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean Harlow]], an actress who was by all reports a lighthearted, kind person offscreen, frequently played bad girl characters and dubbed them "sex vultures".&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (1999), pg. 127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the most prominent examples of bad girl films, ''[[Red-Headed Woman]]'' and ''[[Baby Face (film)|Baby Face]]'', featured Harlow and Stanwyck. In ''Red-Headed Woman'' Harlow plays a secretary determined to sleep her way into a more luxurious lifestyle, and in ''Baby Face'' Stanwyck is an abused runaway determined to use sex to advance herself financially.&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle, Mick.

''Red-Headed Woman'' begins with Harlow seducing her boss Bill LeGendre and intentionally breaking up his marriage. During her seductions, he tries to resist and slaps her, at which point she looks at him deliriously and says "Do it again, I like it! Do it again!"&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (1999), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; They eventually marry but Harlow seduces a wealthy aged industrialist who is in business with her husband so that she can move to New York. Although this plan succeeds, she is cast aside when she is discovered having an affair with her chauffeur, in essence cheating on her paramour. Harlow shoots LeGendre, nearly killing him. When she is last seen in the film, she is in France in the back seat of a limousine with an elderly wealthy gentleman being driven along by the same chauffeur.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The film was a boon to Harlow's career and has been described as a "trash masterpiece".&lt;ref&gt;Hanke, Ken.

Cinema classified as "fallen woman" films was often inspired by real-life hardships women endured in the early Depression era workplace. The men in power in these pictures frequently sexually harassed the women working for them. Remaining employed often became a question of a woman's virtue. In ''[[She Had to Say Yes]]'' (1933), starring [[Loretta Young]], a struggling department store offers dates with its female stenographers as an incentive to customers. ''Employees' Entrance'' was marketed with the tag line "See what out of work girls are up against these days."&lt;ref name="DH131"/&gt; Joy complained in 1932 of another genre, the "kept woman" film, which presented adultery as an alternative to the tedium of an unhappy marriage.&lt;ref name="Sm53"&gt;Smith, pg. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1934, nudity involving "civilized" women, which was understood to mean white women, was generally banned, but permitted with "uncivilized" women, which was understood to mean non-white women.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Filmmaker Deane Dickason took advantage of this loophole to release a quasi-pornographic documentary ''Virgins of Bali'' in September 1932, which concerns a day in the life of two Balinese teenagers, who are presumably "uncivilized".&lt;ref&gt;Doherty pg 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The film's introduction notes that Balinese women were normally topless and only covered their breasts for ceremonial duties; Doherty commented dryly that, "fortunately" for Dickason, his film's two "stars" rarely performed ceremonial duties. Typical of the film is the first scene where the two girls take a bath in the river while Dickason narrates, talking breathlessly about how the two girls "bathe their shamelessly nude bronze bodies".&lt;ref&gt;Doherty pp. 133-34.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Virgins of Bali'', which consisted almost entirely of scenes of Balinese women in various states of undress under the guise of showing what daily life in [[Bali]] was like was an immensely popular film with men at the time, and almost single handedly made Bali into a popular tourist destination.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty pg 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

Homosexuals were portrayed in such pre-Code films as ''[[Our Betters]]'' (1933), ''[[Footlight Parade]]'' (1933), ''[[Only Yesterday (1933 film)|Only Yesterday]]'' (1933), ''[[Sailor's Luck]]'' (1933), and ''[[Cavalcade (1933 film)|Cavalcade]]'' (1933).&lt;ref name="Vi1323"&gt;Vieira, pp. 132–133.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the topic was dealt with much more openly than in the decades that followed, the characterizations of gay and lesbian characters were usually derogatory. Gay male characters were portrayed as flighty with high voices, existing merely as buffoonish supporting characters.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;

A rare example of a homosexual character not being portrayed in the standard effeminate way, albeit still negatively, was the villain "Murder Legendre", played by [[Bela Lugosi]] in ''[[White Zombie (film)|White Zombie]]'' (1932), the Frenchman who mastered the magical powers of a ''Bokor'' (voodoo sorcerer). Legendre is hired by a wealthy plantation owner Charles Beaumont ([[Robert Frazer]]) to turn the woman he desires into a zombie, only to be informed later that Legendre desires him and is going to transform him into a zombie. In films like ''[[Ladies They Talk About]]'', lesbians were portrayed as rough, burly characters, but in DeMille's ''[[The Sign of the Cross (1932 film)|The Sign of the Cross]]'', a female Christian slave is brought to a Roman prefect and seduced in dance by a statuesque lesbian dancer.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Fox nearly became the first American studio to use the word "gay" to refer to homosexuality, but the SRC made the studio muffle the word in the soundtrack of all footage that reached theaters.&lt;ref name="Vi133"&gt;Vieira, pg. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:West, Mae (Go West Young Man).jpg|thumb|upright|{{shy|[[Mae West]] is some|times er|ro|ne|ous|ly called the reason for the Production Code.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even under the Code she managed to wear an almost trans|par|ent dress in ''[[Go West, Young Man]]'' (1936).}}]]

Bisexual actress [[Marlene Dietrich]] cultivated a cross-gender fan base and started a trend when she began wearing men's suits. She caused a commotion when she appeared at the premiere of ''[[The Sign of the Cross (1932 film)|The Sign of the Cross]]'' in 1932 in a tuxedo, complete with top hat and cane.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 123.&lt;br /&gt;Siegel &amp; Siegel, pg. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of homosexual characters was at its height in 1933; in that year, Hays declared that all gay male characters would be removed from pictures. Paramount took advantage of the negative publicity Dietrich generated by signing a largely meaningless agreement stating that they would not portray women in male attire.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comedy==

In the harsh economic times of the early Depression, films and performers often featured an alienated, cynical, and socially dangerous comic style. As with political films, comedy softened with the election of FDR and the optimism of the New Deal. Characters in the pre-Code era frequently engaged in comedic duels of escalating sexual innuendo.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 172–175.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Employee's Entrance'', a woman enters the office of a scoundrel boss who remarks, "Oh, it's you — I didn't recognize you with all your clothes on."&lt;ref name="DH176"&gt;Doherty, pg. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; Racial stereotypes were usually employed when ethnic characters appeared. Blacks in particular were usually the butt of the wisecrack, never the author. The most acknowledged black comedian was [[Stepin Fetchit]], whose slow-witted comedic character was only meant to be successful in an unintentional manner, with himself as the punchline.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 177–178.&lt;br/&gt;Bogle, pg. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New York stage was filled with ribald humor and sexually offensive comedy; when movie producers started to put wisecracks in their sound pictures, they sought New York performers.&lt;ref name="but"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DH181"&gt;Doherty, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Popular comics such as the [[Marx Brothers]] got their start on Broadway in front of live audiences.&lt;ref name="DH179"&gt;Doherty, pg. 179.&lt;/ref&gt; Censors complained when they had to keep up with the deluge of jokes in pictures in the early 1930s, some of which were designed to go over their heads.&lt;ref name="DH181"/&gt; The comic banter of some early sound films was rapid-fire, non-stop, and frequently exhausting for the audience by the final reel.&lt;ref name="DH179"/&gt;

[[Mae West]] had already established herself as a comedic performer when her 1926 Broadway show ''Sex'' made national headlines. Tried and convicted of indecency by the New York City District Attorney, she served eight days in prison.&lt;ref name="DH182"&gt;Doherty, pg. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; West carefully constructed a stage persona and carried it over into her interviews and personal appearances.&lt;ref name="DH183"&gt;Doherty, pg. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite her voluptuous physique, most of her appeal lay in her suggestive manner. She became a wordsmith in the art of the come-on and the seductive line, and despite her obvious appeal to male audiences, was popular with women as well.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 182–83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sm55"&gt;Smith, pg. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the cries of the censors,&lt;ref name="West"&gt;McElvaine (vol 2), pg. 1039.&lt;/ref&gt; West got her start in the film ''[[Night After Night (film)|Night After Night]]'' (1932), which starred [[George Raft]] and [[Constance Cummings]], as a [[Texas Guinan]]-esque supporting character. She agreed to appear in the film only after producers agreed to let her write her own lines.&lt;ref name="Vi112"&gt;Vieira, pg. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In West's first line on film, after a hat check girl remarks "Goodness, what beautiful diamonds", West replies, "Goodness had nothing to do with it, dearie."&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (2000), pg. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Raft, who had wanted [[Texas Guinan]] herself for the role that went to West, later wrote, "In this picture, Mae West stole everything but the cameras."&lt;ref name="SS457"&gt;Siegel &amp; Siegel, p. 457.&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to make ''She Done Him Wrong'' in 1933, which became a huge box office hit, grossing $3 million against a $200,000 budget,&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; and then nine months later wrote and starred in ''[[I'm No Angel]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; She became such a success that her career saved Paramount from financial ruin.&lt;ref name="DH182"/&gt;&lt;ref name="West"/&gt;

The arrival of sound film created a new job market for writers of screen dialogue. Many newspaper journalists moved to California and became studio-employed screenwriters. This resulted in a series of fast-talking comedy pictures featuring newsmen.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Front Page (1931 film)|The Front Page]]'', later re-made as the much less cynical and more sentimental post-Code ''[[His Girl Friday]]'' (1940), was adapted from the Broadway play by [[Chicago]] newsmen, and Hollywood screenwriters, [[Ben Hecht]] and [[Charles MacArthur]]. It was based on Hecht's experiences working as a reporter for the ''[[Chicago Daily Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cartoons===

Theatrical cartoons were also covered by the Production Code. According to [[Leonard Maltin]]: "In early 1933 a Georgia theater owner wrote to ''Film Daily'': 'The worst kicks we have are on smut in cartoons. They are primarily a kid draw, and parents frequently object to the filth that is put in them, incidentally without helping the comedy. The dirtiest ones are invariably the least funny.'" [[Betty Boop]] thus underwent some of the most dramatic changes after the Code was imposed: "gone was the garter, the short skirt, the décolletage".&lt;ref&gt;Maltin, Leonard. ''Of Mice and Magic: A History of American Animated Cartoons'' Revised edition. 1987, pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musicals==

As sound pictures became the norm in Hollywood, the "backstage" film musical was a natural subject for the new medium.  Not only could the studios present singing and dancing to their audiences &amp;ndash; many of whom were unlikely to have ever seen a stage musical before &amp;ndash; but the Pre-Code film musicals also tended to feature shapely young female chorus "girls" wearing skimpy rehearsal clothing which revealed parts of the body which were still not normal to see on the street, and hinted at other parts in a way that normal fashion did not allow.&lt;ref name=lasalle&gt;LaSalle, Mike (2014) [https://books.google.com/books?id=IFDRAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=pre-code%20musicals&amp;pg=PA158#v=onepage&amp;q=pre-code%20musicals&amp;f=false ''Complicated Women: Sex and Power in Pre-Code Hollywood''] New York: MacMillan. p.158 {{ISBN|9781466876972}}&lt;/ref&gt; But even if this could be considered to be exploitative use of the female body, the Pre-Code movie musicals were generally not derogatory in their presentation of the physical virtues of their women, but celebratory, with [[Busby Berkeley]]'s spectacular musical numbers being especially, and wittily, so; Berkeley avoided fetishizing his female performers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Molly Haskell|Haskell, Molly]] (1987) ''From Reverence to Rape: The Treatment of Women in the Movies'' (2nd ed.) Chicago: University of Chicago Press. p.146. {{ISBN|0-226-31885-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chorus "boys", too, were generally well built, healthy-looking, virile specimens, but even so they never got nearly the attention that the women did. As well as these obvious displays of male and female sexual potential &amp;ndash; and the flirting and courting that went with it &amp;ndash; Pre-Code musicals also featured the energy and vitality of their youthful featured actors,&lt;ref name=lasalle /&gt; as well as the comedic abilities of the many older character actors in Hollywood, who were often cast as producers, agents, Broadway "angels" (financial backers) and stingy rich relatives, and brought a light &amp;ndash; if often stereotypical &amp;ndash; touch to these films.

==Horror and science fiction==

Unlike silent-era sex and crime pictures, silent horror movies, despite being produced in the hundreds, were never a major concern for censors or civic leaders. When sound horror films were released however, they quickly caused controversy. Sound provided "atmospheric music and sound effects, creepy-voiced macabre dialogue and a liberal dose of blood-curdling screams" which intensified its effects on audiences, and consequently on moral crusaders.&lt;ref name="Sm57"&gt;Smith, pg. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berenstein, pp. 2, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hays Code did not mention gruesomeness, and filmmakers took advantage of this oversight. However, state boards usually had no set guidelines and could object to any material they found indecent.&lt;ref name="DH297"&gt;Doherty, pg. 297.&lt;/ref&gt; Although films such as ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Freaks]]'' caused controversy when they were released, they had already been re-cut to comply with censors.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Boris Karloff]] in ''[[Frankenstein (1931)|Frankenstein]]'' (1931). The monster's brutality, and the doctor's declaration that "[[Frankenstein (1931 film)#Pre-Code era scenes and censorship history|"Now I know what it feels like to be God!"]], shocked many moviegoers. By the time of ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), the Code was in full effect.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner (1988), pg. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teresi, Dick. [https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/13/books/are-you-mad-doctor.html?pagewanted=2 "Are You Mad, Doctor?"], ''The New York Times'', September 13, 1988; accessed November 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Comprising the nascent motion picture genres of [[Horror film|horror]] and [[science fiction]], the nightmare picture provoked individual psychological terror in its horror incarnations, while embodying group sociological terror in its science fiction manifestations. The two main types of pre-Code horror pictures were the single monster movie, and films where masses of hideous beasts rose up and attacked their putative betters. ''Frankenstein'' and ''Freaks'' exemplified both genres.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 296, 299, 308.&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Code horror cycle was motivated by financial necessity. Universal in particular buoyed itself with the production of horror hits such as ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931) and ''Frankenstein'', then followed those successes up with ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'' (1932), ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932), and ''[[The Old Dark House]]'' (1932). Other major studios responded with their own productions.&lt;ref name="Sm57"/&gt; Much like the crime film cycle, however, the intense boom of the horror cycle was ephemeral, and had fallen off at the box office by the end of the pre-Code era.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Joy declared ''Dracula'' "quite satisfactory from the standpoint of the Code" before it was released, and the film had little trouble reaching theaters, ''Frankenstein'' was a different story.&lt;ref&gt;Vieira, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt; New York, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts removed the scene where the monster unintentionally drowns a little girl and lines that referenced Dr. Frankenstein's God complex.&lt;ref name="Vi43"/&gt; [[Kansas]], in particular, objected to the film. The state's censor board requested the cutting of 32 scenes, which if removed, would have halved the length of the film.&lt;ref name="DH297"/&gt;

Paramount's ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931 film)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' (1931) played to the Freudian theories popular with the audience of its time. [[Fredric March]] played the split-personality title character. Jekyll represented the composed [[super-ego]], and Hyde the lecherous [[Id, ego and super-ego|id]]. [[Miriam Hopkins]]'s coquettish  bar singer, Ivy Pierson, sexually teases Jekyll early in the film by displaying parts of her legs and bosom.&lt;ref name="DH305"&gt;Doherty, pg. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Joy felt the scene had been "dragged in simply to titillate the audience."&lt;ref name="Vi43"&gt;Vieira, pg. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Hyde coerces her with the threat of violence into becoming his paramour and beats her when she attempts to stop seeing him. She is contrasted with his wholesome fiancée Muriel ([[Rose Hobart]]), whose chaste nature dissatisfies March's baser alter ego.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.tvguide.com/dr-jekyll-mr-hyde/review/113132 Review: ''Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde''], tvguide.com; accessed November 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The film is considered the "most honored of the Pre-Code horror films."&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 303–304.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the graphic scenes between Hyde and Ivy were cut by local censors because of their suggestiveness.&lt;ref&gt;Vieira, pg. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Sex was intimately tied to horror in many pre-Code horror movies. In ''Murders in the Rue Morgue'', an adaptation of [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s [[The Murders in the Rue Morgue|classic tale]] which has little in common with the source material, [[Bela Lugosi]] plays a mad scientist who tortures and kills women, trying to mix human blood with ape blood during his experiments. His prized experiment, an intelligent ape named Erik, breaks into a woman's second-floor apartment window and rapes her.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 305–307.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rue Morgue.JPG|thumb|right|In ''[[Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932 film)|Murders in the Rue Morgue]]'' (1932), the shadow of the ape's hand appears over head of Camille ([[Sidney Fox]]) as it enters her room. What follows has been dubbed "interspecies miscegenation" by film historian Thomas Doherty.&lt;ref name="DH305"/&gt;]]

In ''Freaks'', director [[Tod Browning]] of ''Dracula'' fame helms a picture that depicts a traveling circus populated by a group of deformed carnival freaks. Browning populated the movie with actual carnival sideshow performers including "midgets, dwarfs, hermaphrodites, Siamese twins, and, most awful, the armless and legless man billed as the 'living torso'".&lt;ref name="DH313"&gt;Doherty, pg. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a group of Pinheads, who are depicted as fortunate in that they are not mentally capable enough to understand that they disgust people.&lt;ref name="DH313"/&gt; But the truly unsavory characters here are the villains, the circus strongman Hercules and the beautiful high-wire artist Cleopatra, who intends to marry and poison Hans, the midget heir who is enamored of her. At a dinner celebrating their union, one of the freaks dances on the table as they chant "gooble-gobble, gobble, gobble, one of us, one of us, we accept her, we accept her." Disgusted, Cleopatra insults Hans and makes out with Hercules in front of him. When the freaks discover her plot, they exact revenge by mutilating Cleopatra into a freak.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 313–318.&lt;/ref&gt; Although circus freaks were common in the early 1930s, the film was their first depiction on screen.&lt;ref name="DH313" /&gt; Browning took care to linger over shots of the deformed, disabled performers with long takes of them including one of the "living torso" lighting a match and then a cigarette with his mouth. The film was accompanied by a sensational marketing campaign that asked sexual questions such as "Do the Siamese Twins make love?", "What sex is the half-man half-woman?", and "Can a full grown woman truly love a midget?"&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 315–317.&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly, given its reaction to ''Frankenstein'', the state of [[Kansas]] objected to nothing in ''Freaks''.&lt;ref&gt;Butters, pg. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; However, other states, such as Georgia, were repulsed by the film and it was not shown in many locales.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 317–18.&lt;/ref&gt; The film later became a cult classic spurred by [[midnight movie]] showings,&lt;ref&gt;Phipps, Keith. [http://www.avclub.com/articles/freaks,11321 Review of the film ''Freaks'' profile], avclub.com, August 16, 2004; accessed November 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was a box-office bomb in its original release.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 318.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Island of Lost Souls (1932 film)|Island of Lost Souls]]'' (1932), an adaptation of [[H. G. Wells]]' science-fiction novel, ''[[The Island of Doctor Moreau]]'', [[Charles Laughton]] plays yet another mad scientist with a God complex.&lt;ref&gt;Vieira, pg. 147.&lt;/ref&gt; As Moreau, Laughton creates a mad scientist's island paradise, an unmonitored haven where he is free to create a race of man-beasts and Lota, a beast-woman he wants to mate with a normal human male. A castaway lands on his island, providing him an opportunity to see how far his science experiment, the barely clothed, attractive Lota, has come. The castaway discovers Moreau [[vivisection|vivisecting]] one of the beast-men and attempts to leave the island. He runs into the camp of the man-beasts and Moreau beats them back with a whip. The film ends with Lota dead, the castaway rescued, and the man-beasts chanting, "Are we not men?" as they attack and then vivisect Moreau.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 308–311.&lt;/ref&gt; The film has been described as "a rich man's ''Freaks''" due to its esteemed source material.&lt;ref name="Vi132"&gt;Vieira, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Wells, however, despised the movie for its lurid excesses. It was rejected by 14 local censor boards in the United States, and considered "against nature" in Great Britain, where it was banned until 1958.&lt;ref name="Vi132" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hanke, Ken.

==Exotic adventure films==
[[File:Bird of Paradise (1932) 2.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Dolores del Río]] dances almost [[Toplessness|topless]] in ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'' (1932).&lt;/center&gt;]]

Pre-Code films contained a continual, recurring theme of white racism.&lt;ref name="DH254"&gt;Doherty, pg. 254.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1930s, the studios filmed a series of pictures that aimed to provide viewers a sense of the exotic, an exploration of the unknown and the forbidden. These pictures often imbued themselves with the allure of interracial sex according to pre-Code historian Thomas Doherty. "At the psychic core of the genre is the shiver of sexual attraction, the threat and promise of miscegenation."&lt;ref name="DH254"/&gt; Films such as ''[[Africa Speaks]]'' were directly marketed by referencing interracial sex; moviegoers received small packets labeled "Secrets" which contained pictures of naked black women.&lt;ref name="DH255"&gt;Doherty, pg. 255.&lt;/ref&gt; As portrayals of historic conditions, these movies are of little educational value, but as artifacts that show Hollywood's attitude towards race and foreign cultures they are enlightening.&lt;ref name="DH254"/&gt; The central point of interest in ''[[The Blonde Captive]]'' (1931), a film which depicted a blonde woman abducted by a savage tribe of Aboriginal Australians, was not that she was kidnapped, but that she enjoys living among the tribe.&lt;ref name="DH255"/&gt; The lack of black characters in films highlights their status in [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow America]].&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 255–256.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Bird of Paradise (1932 film)|Bird of Paradise]]'', a white American man ([[Joel McCrea]]) enjoys a torrid affair with a Polynesian princess ([[Dolores del Río]]). The film created a scandal when released due to a scene featuring del Río [[Skinny dipping|swimming naked]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms5.html Sex in Cinema], AMC filmsite&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orson Welles]] said del Río represented the highest erotic ideal with her performance in the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dawnsdeloresdelrio.blogspot.com/2010/05/bird-of-paradise1932-pre-code.html ''Bird of Paradise'' (1932 film) review], dawnsdeloresdelrio.blogspot.com; accessed June 23, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The white protagonist in ''[[Tarzan the Ape Man (1932 film)|Tarzan, the Ape Man]]'' (1932) is the "King of the [African] Jungle". Tarzan ([[Johnny Weissmuller]]) is a monosyllabic half-naked jungle creature whose attractiveness is derived from his physical prowess; throughout the movie, he saves Jane ([[Maureen O'Sullivan]]) from danger and she swoons in his arms.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 257.&lt;br/&gt;Hall, Mourdant.

The board consisted of the heads of Fox, RKO, and Universal. After watching the scene "several times", the board sided with Breen and the MPPDA, and the scene was removed, but MGM still allowed some uncut trailers and a few reels to stay in circulation.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 260–261.&lt;br/&gt;Vieira, pp. 179–80.&lt;/ref&gt; MGM marketed the film primarily towards women using taglines such as:&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic characters were portrayed against stereotype in ''[[Massacre (1934 film)|Massacre]]'' (1934). The protagonist ([[Richard Barthelmess]]) is a Native American who performs in a [[Wild West Shows|Wild West Show]] in full Indian garb, but then slips into a suit and speaks in American slang once the show is over.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; He has a black butler who is atypically intelligent; his character merely plays dumb by slipping into a stereotypical slow-witted "negro" character when it suits him, rather than being genuinely unintelligent.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;

Films such as ''[[The Mask of Fu Manchu]]'' (1932), ''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932) and ''[[The Bitter Tea of General Yen]]'' (1933), explored the exoticism of the Far East — by using white actors, not Asians, in the lead roles. The white actors frequently looked absurd in [[Portrayal of East Asians in Hollywood|yellow-face makeup]] next to genuine Asians, so the studios would cast all the Asian parts white.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 268.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, "[[Yellow Peril]]" stereotypes dominated the portrayal of Asian characters, who were almost always villains.&lt;ref name="Yunte, pg. 144"&gt;Yunte, pg. 144&lt;/ref&gt; The American scholar Huang Yunte wrote that the character of Charlie Chan, a Chinese-American detective aided by his bumbling, Americanized "Number One Son" were virtually the only positive examples of Asian characters in Hollywood in this period.&lt;ref name="Yunte, pg. 144"/&gt; The actress [[Anna May Wong]] complained in a 1933 interview about the prevalence of "Yellow Peril" stereotypes in Hollywood saying: "Why is it that the screen Chinese is always the villain? And so crude a villain – murderous, treacherous, a snake in the grass! We are not like that. How could we be, with a civilization that is so many times older than the West?"&lt;ref&gt;Lim 2005, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Fu Manchu'', Boris Karloff plays the evil Chinese mad scientist and gangster Dr. Fu Manchu, who wants to find the sword and mask of [[Genghis Khan]], which will give him the power to control the "countless hordes" of Asians, and lead them into battle against the West.&lt;ref name="fu"/&gt; Fu is a sexual deviant who engages in ritual torture and has occult powers.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 269–270.&lt;/ref&gt; Several times, the film seems to suggest Fu is engaged in an incestuous relationship with his equally evil daughter Fah Lo See ([[Myrna Loy]]), which plays up a central theme of the "Yellow Peril" fears, the alleged abnormal sexuality of Asians.&lt;ref name="Yunte, pg. 144"/&gt; In a scene cut from the film due to its depiction of miscegenation, the film shows Fu's depraved daughter violating one of the chaste good characters.&lt;ref&gt;Vieira, pg. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Fu is eventually conquered, but not before he temporarily lays his hand on the sword and proclaims to a vast Pan-Asian army made up of Asians and Muslims: "Would you have maidens like this [referring to [[Karen Morley]]] for your wives? Then conquer and breed! Kill the white man and take his women!"&lt;ref name="fu"&gt;[[Charles Brabin|Brabin, Charles]]. ''The Mask of Fu Manchu'' (1932). United States: MGM.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marlene Dietrich in Shanghai Express (1932) by Don English.png|thumb|upright|left|&lt;center&gt;[[Marlene Dietrich]] in&lt;br&gt;''[[Shanghai Express (film)|Shanghai Express]]'' (1932)&lt;/center&gt;]]''

The Chinese warlord General Henry Chang ([[Warner Oland]]) in the 1932 film [[Shanghai Express (film)|''Shanghai Express'']], who is presented as being not only as [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]], but as having a menacing asexuality that places him outside of the conventionally defined world of Western sexuality and racial order, making him as dangerous to the Western characters who he has taken hostage as much as the fact that he is a vicious warlord.&lt;ref name="Marchetti pg 64"&gt;Marchetti pg 64&lt;/ref&gt; Though Chang is Eurasian, he takes pride in his Chinese heritage while rejecting his American heritage, which confirms his Eastern identity.&lt;ref name="Marchetti pg 64"/&gt; War-torn China, circa 1931 is presented as a "hell", which a diverse group of Westerners must travel through on a nightmarish train trip from Beijing to [[Shanghai]], which takes a turn for the worse when the train is hijacked by Chang and his men.&lt;ref&gt;Marchetti pg 61&lt;/ref&gt; The film strongly hints that Chang is bisexual, who not only wants to rape the heroine Shanghai Lily ([[Marlene Dietrich]]), but also the hero Captain Donald "Doc" Harvey ([[Clive Brook]]).&lt;ref name="Marchetti pg 64"/&gt; When the German opium smuggler Erich Baum ([[Gustav von Seyffertitz]]) insults Chang, the result is a scene where the warlord commits a symbolic rape, as the sadistic Chang clearly takes sexual pleasure in branding Baum with a red-hot poker.&lt;ref&gt;Marchetti pg. 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt; After he is branded (the symbol of slavery), the once proud Baum becomes notably cowed and submissive towards Chang who in a certain sense now "owns" him, which reflected the ultimate Yellow Peril fear of Westerners becoming the slaves of the East and its perverted sexuality.&lt;ref&gt;Marchetti pg 65&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Chang does actually rape Hui Fei ([[Anna May Wong]]).&lt;ref name="Marchetti pg. 65"&gt;Marchetti pg. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Gina Marchetti suggests that Chang's desire to blind Harvey is not only meant literally, but is also a metaphor for castration, which even under the more permissive Production code in effect in 1932 would have been a taboo subject.&lt;ref&gt;Marchetti pg 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In a marked contrast to Chang's twisted sexuality and his "almost effeminate polish", the British Army Captain Harvey is a resolutely heterosexual, ruggedly tough soldier with a deep romantic streak who more than amply proved his manliness in the trenches of World War I, presenting a model of Western masculinity and strength.&lt;ref&gt;Marchetti 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

At several times, the film hints that Shanghai Lily and Hui Fei are more than best friends, and are in fact engaged in a lesbian relationship, so when the film ends with Lily choosing Harvey as her lover, this serves as a testament to his manly Western sex appeal, which "redeems"  her from her life as a prostitute.&lt;ref&gt;Marchetti pg. 60-65&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time that ''Shanghai Express'' embraces Yellow Peril stereotypes through the character of Chang, it also to some extent undermines them through the character of Hui, who is shown crying inconsolably after being raped by Chang, which gives her a certain humanity and allows the audience to sympathize with her.&lt;ref name="Marchetti pg. 65"/&gt; Hui is a courtesan who is looked down upon by all Western characters except for her best friend Lily on the account of her race and profession, but she is shown as possessing dignity and a willingness to stand up for herself.&lt;ref&gt;Chan pg. 232-234&lt;/ref&gt; Several scenes seemed to suggest that Shanghai Lily and Hui are more attracted to one another then either are to Captain Harvey as the two women exchange longing glances more than once, through this may be suggesting Hui's sexuality is not quite normal (most people in 1932 would considered bi-sexuality to be unnatural).&lt;ref&gt;Chan pg. 232 &amp; 236&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Hui wears a tight cheongsam dress, which clearly reveal her erect nipples, which definitely captures Lily's interest .&lt;ref&gt;Chan pg. 236&lt;/ref&gt; The same criticism might be applied to Lily, but the film ends with Lily embracing heterosexual love by kissing Harvey while Hui walks off into the distance alone, sadder as a result of losing her best friend to Harvey and because she was raped, but otherwise unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Chan pg. 236-237&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it is Hui who saves Harvey in the climax from being blinded/raped/castrated at the hands of Chang by killing Chang; Hui explains the killing as her way of regaining the self-respect that Chang had taken away from her.&lt;ref&gt;Chan pg. 232 &amp; 236-237&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frank Capra]]'s ''The Bitter Tea of General Yen'' was not quite the same type of film: Stanwyck plays a missionary who goes to civil-war-torn China and meets the titular general (played by [[Nils Asther]]) after his car kills the driver of her [[Pulled rickshaw|rickshaw]]. When she is knocked unconscious in a riot, he takes her out of the rabble and onto a train car. She has lurid, horror-themed, symbolic dreams about the General, in which she is both titillated and repulsed by him. The film breaks precedent by developing into an interracial love story, but his army ends in ruins. Yen kills himself at the film's conclusion—by drinking poisoned tea—rather than be captured and killed.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 270–274.&lt;/ref&gt; Capra adored the script and disregarded the risk of making a film that broke California's (and 29 other states') laws concerning the portrayal of miscegenation. Cinematographer [[Joseph Walker (cinematographer)|Joseph Walker]] tested a new technique he created, which he dubbed "Variable Diffusion", in filming the picture. This rendered the entire picture in very [[soft focus]].&lt;ref name="Vi118"/&gt;

==Newsreels and documentaries==
{{Main|Newsreel}}

From 1904 until 1967, when television finally killed them off, newsreels preceded films. In the early sound-film era, they lasted around eight minutes and featured highlights and clips of the world's biggest stories. Updated twice a week by the five major studios, they became a highly profitable enterprise: in 1933, newsreels had a total box office take of almost $19.5 million against an outlay of under $10 million.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 197, 212.&lt;/ref&gt; The sound-film era created the narrator; among the first was [[Graham McNamee]], who provided voiceover during the clips, often delivering hackneyed jokes while delineating the on-screen action.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 174–175, 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Sound newsreel interviews and monologues featured famous subjects unaccustomed to the new medium. These clips changed public perception of important historical figures depending on their elocution, the sound of their previously unheard voices, and their composure in front of the camera.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 200–202.&lt;/ref&gt; Around 12 "newsreel theaters" were soon created around the United States, the most successful being the Embassy Newsreel Theater on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]. The Embassy was a 578-seat facility that presented fourteen 45–50 minute programs a day, running from 10 in the morning until midnight.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted for its discerning, intellectual audience, many of whom did not attend motion-picture theaters.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:All Quiet on the Western Front lobby card.jpg|thumb|right|''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1930). one of the first American films to portray the horrors of [[World War I]], received great praise from the public for its humanitarian, anti-war message.]]

The most gripping news story of the pre-Code era was the [[Lindbergh kidnapping|kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby]] on the evening of 1 March 1932.&lt;ref name="Gill"/&gt; As the child was already enormously famous before the kidnapping, the event created a media circus, with news coverage more intense than anything since World War I. Newsreels featuring family photos of the child (the first time private pictures had been "conscripted for public service"&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 218–219.&lt;/ref&gt;) asked spectators to report any sight of him. On May 12, 1932, the child's body was found less than five miles from the Lindbergh home.&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;Gill, Barbara. [http://www.nj.com/lindbergh/hunterdon/index.ssf?/lindbergh/stories/demcovr.html "Lindbergh kidnapping rocked the world 50 years ago"], ''[[The Hunterdon County Democrat]]'', 1981, accessed October 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DH220"&gt;Doherty, p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt; Although newsreels covered the most important topics of the day, they also presented [[Human interest story|human-interest stories]] (such as the immensely popular coverage of the [[Dionne quintuplets]]&lt;ref name="DH220"/&gt;) and entertainment news, at times in greater detail than more pressing political and social matters.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 199.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the images' impact belies their historical accuracy; nearly all ceremonies and public events that were filmed for newsreels in the early sound era were staged, and in some cases even reenacted. For instance: when FDR signed an important bill, a member of his cabinet was called away before the staged reenactment began, so the film shows him absent at the time of the signing, although he had been present.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 203–204.&lt;/ref&gt; The newsreels of FDR were staged to hide his hobbled gait caused by polio.&lt;ref name="DH7785"&gt;Doherty, pp. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt; Caught between the desire to present accurate hard-hitting news stories and the need to keep an audience in the mood for the upcoming entertainment, newsreels often soft-pedaled the difficulties Americans faced during the early years of the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 208, 213–215.&lt;/ref&gt; FDR in particular received favorable treatment from Hollywood, with all five of the major studios producing pro-FDR shorts by late 1933. These shorts featured some of the studios' lesser contract talent extolling the virtues of FDR created government and social programs.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt himself was a natural before the camera. The newsreels were instrumental to the success of his initial campaign, and his enduring popularity while in office.&lt;ref name="DH7785"/&gt; He was described by ''Variety'' as the "Barrymore of the Capital".&lt;ref name="DH79"/&gt;

Taking advantage of the existence of 30 years of newsreels archives were filmmakers who made early sound era documentaries. World War I was a popular topic of these pictures and spawned the following documentaries; ''[[Albert Leroy Rule#Filmography|The Big Drive]]'' (1933), ''World in Revolt'' (1933), ''This is America'' (1933), and ''Hell's Holiday'' (1933).&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 204–205.&lt;/ref&gt; The most prescient{{clarify|date=February 2016|reason=Prescient in what sense?}} pre-Code World War I documentary was aptly called ''The First World War'' (1934) and was the most critically and commercially successful documentary of the era.

Filmmakers also made feature-length documentaries that covered the dark recesses of the globe, including the [[Amazon rainforest]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American settlements]], the [[Pacific islands]], and everywhere in between. Taking advantage of audiences' voyeuristic impulses, aided by the allowance of nudity in tribal documentaries, the filming of lands untouched by modernity, and the presentation of locales never before filmed, these movies placated Depression era American audiences by showing them lifestyles more difficult than their own.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 223, 225–227.&lt;/ref&gt; Also captured were Arctic expeditions in films such ''90° South'' and ''[[With Byrd at the South Pole]]'', and [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] in the [[safari]] films of [[Martin and Osa Johnson]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 227–228, 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some exploitation style documentaries purported to show actual events but were instead staged, elaborate ruses. The most prominent of which was ''[[Ingagi]]'' (1931), a film which claimed to show a ritual where African women were given over to gorillas as sex slaves, but instead was mostly filmed in Los Angeles using local blacks in place of natives.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 236, 241.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Douglas Fairbanks]] mocked the phoniness of many pre-Code documentaries in his parody ''[[Around the World in 80 Minutes with Douglas Fairbanks]]'', in one scene of which he filmed himself wrestling a stuffed tiger doll, then a tiger-skin rug.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Opposing these films was the [[travelogue (films)|travelogue]] which was shown before features and served as a short saccharine form of cinematic tourism.&lt;ref name="DH222"&gt;Doherty, pg. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Code films began to draw the ire of various religious groups, some Protestant but mostly a contingent of Roman Catholic crusaders.&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (2002), p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amleto Cicognani|Amleto Giovanni Cicognani]], apostolic delegate to the [[Catholic Church]] in the United States, called upon Roman Catholics in the United States to unite against the surging immorality of films. As a result, in 1933 the Catholic Legion of Decency, headed by the Reverend [[John T. McNicholas]] (later renamed the [[National Legion of Decency]]), was established to control and enforce decency standards and boycott films they deemed offensive.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 320–321.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TM"&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762190-1,00.html Religion: Legion of Decency], ''TIME'', June 11, 1934; accessed October 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; They created a rating system for films that started at "harmless" and ended at "condemned", with the latter denoting a film that was a sin to watch.&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, Jarvie, and Fuller, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legion spurred several million Roman Catholics across the U.S. to sign up for the boycott, allowing local religious leaders to determine which films to protest.&lt;ref name="TM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bl149"&gt;Black, pg. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative Protestants tended to support much of the crackdown, particularly in the South, where anything relating to the state of race relations or miscegenation could not be portrayed. Although the Central Conference of American Rabbis joined in the protest, it was an uneasy alliance given the heavy presence of Jewish studio executives and producers, which, it was felt, had inspired at least some of the vitriol from the Catholic groups.&lt;ref name="DH322"/&gt;

Hays opposed direct censorship, considering it "Un-American". He had stated that although there were some tasteless films in his estimation, working with filmmakers was better than direct oversight, and that, overall, films were not harmful to children. Hays blamed some of the more prurient films on the difficult economic times which exerted "tremendous commercial pressure" on the studios more than a flouting of the code.&lt;ref name="Bl150"/&gt; Catholic groups became enraged with Hays and as early as July 1934 were demanding that he resign from his position, which he did not, although his influence waned and Breen took control, with Hays becoming a functionary.&lt;ref&gt;United Press.

[[File:MPPDA Seal.JPG|thumb|left|The PCA seal of approval in the 1930s. The Seal appeared before every picture approved by the MPPDA.]]

The [[The Payne Fund|Payne Study and Experiment Fund]] was created in 1927 by [[Frances Payne Bolton]] to support a study of the influence of fiction on children.&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, Jarvie, and Fuller, p. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Payne Fund Studies]], a series of eight&lt;ref&gt;See Jowett, Jarvie and Fuller, pg. 92. Frequently this number is mistakenly given as nine; nine were announced, but only eight were ever released.&lt;/ref&gt; books published from 1933 to 1935 which detailed five (5) years of research aimed specifically at the cinema's effects on children, were also gaining publicity at this time, and became a great concern to Hays.&lt;ref name="Bl150"&gt;Black, pg. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jc107"&gt;Jacobs, pg. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, pg. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Hays had said certain pictures might alter "... that sacred thing, the mind of a child … that clean, virgin thing, that unmarked state" and have "the same responsibility, the same care about the thing put on it that the best clergyman or the most inspired teacher would have."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, pg. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its initial reception, the main findings of the study were largely innocuous. It found that cinema's effect on individuals varied with age and social position, and that pictures reinforced audiences' existing beliefs.&lt;ref name="MS29"&gt;Massey, pg. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jowett, Jarvie, and Fuller, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Motion Picture Research Council (MPRC, led by honorary vice president [[Sara Delano Roosevelt]] (mother of President Franklin D. Roosevelt),&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt; and executive director the Rev. William H. Short&lt;ref&gt;Saettler, pg. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;) which funded the study, was not pleased. An "alarmist summary" of the study's results written by [[Henry James Forman]] appeared in ''[[McCall's]]'', a leading women's magazine of the time, and Forman's book, ''[[Our Movie Made Children]]'', which became a best-seller, publicized the Payne Fund's results, emphasizing its more negative aspects.&lt;ref name="DH322"&gt;Doherty, pg. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Massey, pp. 29–30.&lt;br&gt;*Jowett, Jarvie, and Fuller, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social environment created by the publicity of the Payne Fund Studies and religious protests reached such a fever pitch that a member of the Hays Office described it as a "state of war".&lt;ref name="Ja106" /&gt; However, newspapers including ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' ([[Cleveland]]), ''[[New Orleans Times Picayune]]'', ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'', ''[[Atlanta Journal]]'', ''[[Saint Paul Dispatch]]'', the Philadelphia [[The Philadelphia Record|''Record'']] and ''[[Public Ledger (Philadelphia)|''Public Ledger]]'', the ''[[Boston American]]'' and New York's ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'', ''[[New York Daily Mirror|Daily Mirror]]'', and ''[[New York Post|Evening Post]]'' all lambasted the studies.&lt;ref&gt;Black, pg. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; When discussing the Supreme Court's 1915 decision, film historian Gregory Black argues that the efforts of reformers might have been lessened had "filmmakers been willing to produce films for specialized audiences (adults only, family, no children) … but the movers and shakers of the industry wanted or needed the largest possible market."&lt;ref&gt;Black, pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The most provocative pictures were the most profitable, with the 25% of the motion picture industry's output that was the most sensational supporting the cleaner 75%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Corliss]] essay reprinted in Schatz, pg. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1932, there was an increasing movement for government control.&lt;ref&gt;Butters Jr, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; By mid-1934 when Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia called for a Catholic boycott of all films, and [[Raymond Joseph Cannon|Raymond Cannon]] was privately preparing a congressional bill supported by both Democrats and Republicans which would introduce Government oversight, the studios decided they had had enough.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 321, 324–325.
* Corliss essay in Schatz, pg. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; They re-organized the enforcement procedures giving Hays and the recently appointed [[Joseph Breen|Joseph I. Breen]], a devout Roman Catholic, head of the new [[Production Code Administration]] (PCA), greater control over censorship.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 8, 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The studios agreed to disband their appeals committee and to impose a $25,000 fine for producing, distributing, or exhibiting any film without PCA approval.&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt; Hays had originally hired Breen, who had worked in public relations, in 1930 to handle Production Code publicity, and the latter was popular among Catholics.&lt;ref&gt;Butters Jr., pg. 190.&lt;br/&gt;* Jeff &amp; Simmmons, pg. 55.&lt;br/&gt;* Ross, pg. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; Joy began working solely for [[Fox Studios]], and Wingate had been bypassed in favor of Breen in December 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pg. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pg. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Hays became a functionary, while Breen handled the business of censoring films.&lt;ref&gt;LaSalle (1999), pg. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Breen initially had anti-Semitic prejudices,&lt;ref&gt;Black, pg. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and was quoted as stating that Jews "are, probably, the scum of the earth."&lt;ref name="Bl149"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DH98"&gt;Doherty. pg. 98. *For more discussion of Breen's antisemitism, see Doherty (2009), chapter 10, in the "Further reading" section.&lt;/ref&gt; When Breen died in 1965, the trade magazine ''Variety'' stated, "More than any single individual, he shaped the moral stature of the American motion picture."&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Legion's impact on the more effective enforcement of the Code is unquestionable, its influence on the general populace is harder to gauge. A study done by Hays after the Code was finally fully implemented found that audiences were doing the exact opposite of what the Legion had recommended. Each time the Legion protested a film it meant increased ticket sales; unsurprisingly, Hays kept these results to himself and they were not revealed until many years later.&lt;ref name="La201"&gt;LaSalle, pg. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to big cities, boycotts in smaller towns were more effective and theater owners complained of the harassment they received when they exhibited salacious films.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 324–325.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many actors and actresses, such as Edward G. Robinson, Barbara Stanwyck, and Clark Gable, continued their careers apace after the Code was enforced. However, others, such as [[Ruth Chatterton]] (who decamped to England around 1936) and [[Warren William]] (who died relatively young in the 1940s), who excelled during this period, are mostly forgotten today.&lt;ref name="Tu371"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vol2"/&gt;

==After the Code era – Motion Picture Association of America film rating system (MPAA)==

[[File:Three on a Match Dvorak Wellman.jpg|thumb|right|Scenes such as this, in which a man is about to kiss a woman in bed in her nightgown, ([[Warren William]] and [[Ann Dvorak]] in 1932's ''[[Three on a Match]]'') were proscribed by the Production Code. After 1934, a scene such as this would not appear in a Hollywood film for decades.]]

Censors like Martin Quigley and Joseph Breen understood that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;a private industry code, strictly enforced, is more effective than government censorship as a means of imposing religious dogma. It is secret, for one thing, operating at the pre-production stage. The audience never knows what has been trimmed, cut, revised, or never written. For another, it is uniform—not subject to hundreds of different licensing standards. Finally and most important, private censorship can be more sweeping in its demands, because it is not bound by constitutional due process or free-expression rules—in general, these apply to only the government—or by the command of church-state separation … there is no question that American cinema today is far freer than in the heyday of the Code, when Joe Breen's blue pencil and the Legion of Decency's ever-present boycott threat combined to assure that films adhered to Catholic Church doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Heins, Marjorie. [http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:1wufM1hmlzsJ:www.fepproject.org/commentaries/themiracle.html+Martin+Quigley+censor&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=7 "''The Miracle'': Film Censorship and the Entanglement of Church and State"], fepproject.org; accessed October 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Termed by Breen as "Compensating moral value", the maxim was that "any theme must contain at least sufficient good in the story to compensate for, and to counteract, any evil which relates."&lt;ref name="DH11"&gt;Doherty, pg. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Hollywood could present evil behavior, but only if it were eradicated by the end of the film, "with the guilty punished, and the sinner redeemed".&lt;ref name="DH11"/&gt;

Pre-Code scholar Thomas Doherty summarized the practical effects:&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even for moral guardians of Breen's dedication, however, film censorship can be a tricky business. Images must be cut, dialogue overdubbed or deleted, and explicit messages and subtle implications excised from what the argot of film criticism calls the "[[diegesis]]". Put simply, the diegesis is the world of the film, the universe inhabited by the characters existing in the landscape of cinema. "Diegetic" elements are experienced by the characters in the film and (vicariously) by the spectator; "nondiegetic" elements are apprehended by the spectator alone.... The job of the motion picture censor is to patrol the diegesis, keeping an eye and ear out for images, languages, and meanings that should be banished from the world of film.... The easiest part of the assignment is to connect the dots and connect what is visually and verbally forbidden by name. … More challenging is the work of the textual analysis and narrative rehabilitation that discerns and redirects hidden lessons and moral meanings.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Shirleytemple young.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Shirley Temple]], a rising star in 1934, was advertised as "an attraction that will serve as an answer to many of the attacks that are being hurled at pictures."&lt;ref name="DH333"&gt;Doherty, p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The censors thus expanded their jurisdiction from what was seen to what was implied in the spectator's mind. In ''[[The Office Wife (1930 film)|The Office Wife]]'' (1930), several of [[Joan Blondell]]'s disrobing maneuvers were strictly forbidden and the implied image of the actress being naked just off-screen was deemed too suggestive even though it relied upon the audience using their imaginations, so post-Code releases of the film had scenes which were blurred or rendered indistinct, if allowed at all.&lt;ref name="DH11"/&gt;

Following the July 1, 1934 decision by the studios put the power over film censorship in Breen's hands, he appeared in a series of newsreel clips promoting the new order of business, assuring Americans that the motion-picture industry would be cleansed of "the vulgar, the cheap, and the tawdry" and that pictures would be made "vital and wholesome entertainment".&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 328–30.&lt;/ref&gt; All scripts now went through PCA,&lt;ref name="La201"/&gt; and several films playing in theaters were ordered withdrawn.&lt;ref name="Ja106"&gt;Jacobs, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first film Breen censored in the production stage was the Joan Crawford film ''[[Forsaking All Others]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 329.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Independent film producers vowed they would give "no thought to Mr. Joe Breen or anything he represents", they caved on their stance within one month of making it.&lt;ref name="DH334"&gt;Doherty, p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; The major studios still owned most of the successful theaters in the country,&lt;ref name="SS190"/&gt; and studio heads such as [[Harry Cohn]] of [[Columbia Pictures]] had already agreed to stop making indecent films.&lt;ref&gt;[[United Press]]. [https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IzcyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=FOMFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1882,689742&amp;dq=will+hays&amp;hl=en Will Hays Confers with Film Leaders], ''Berkeley Daily Gazette'', July 10, 1934; accessed October 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19340721.2.151.7 Stir in Hollywood], ''[[The Evening Post (New Zealand)|Evening Post]]'', July 21, 1934; accessed October 20, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In several large cities audiences booed when the Production seal appeared before films.&lt;ref name="DH334"/&gt; But the Catholic Church was pleased, and in 1936 [[Pope Pius XI]] stated that the U.S. film industry "has recognized and accepts its responsibility before society."&lt;ref name="ah"/&gt; The Legion condemned zero films produced by the MPPDA between 1936 and 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Corliss essay in Schatz, pg. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;

A coincidental upswing in the fortunes of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the ''Motion Picture Herald'' as proof positive that the code was working.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pg. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as [[John Dillinger]], [[Baby Face Nelson]], and [[Bonnie and Clyde]] that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of [[Al Capone]] and [[Machine Gun Kelly]] in [[Alcatraz Island|Alcatraz]].&lt;ref name="DH339"/&gt; Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually.&lt;ref name="DH335"&gt;Doherty, pg. 335.&lt;/ref&gt; A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as [[Shirley Temple]] took off.&lt;ref name="DH333"/&gt;

[[File:Leo Gorcey and James Cagney in Angels With Dirty Faces trailer.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Leo Gorcey]] and [[James Cagney]] in ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]] (1937)]]

Stars such as James Cagney redefined their images. Cagney played a series of patriots, and his gangster in ''[[Angels with Dirty Faces]]'' (1937) purposefully acts like a coward when he is executed so children who had looked up to him would cease any such admiration.&lt;ref name="DH339"&gt;Doherty, pg. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; Breen in essence neutered Groucho Marx, removing most of his jokes which directly referenced sex, although some sexual references slipped through unnoticed in the Marx Brothers post-Code pictures.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner (1988), pp. 114–116, 118–120.&lt;/ref&gt; In the political realm, films such ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'' (1939) in which [[James Stewart]] tries to change the American system from within while reaffirming its core values, stand in stark contrast to ''Gabriel Over the White House'' where a dictator is needed to cure America's woes.&lt;ref&gt;Doherty, pp. 341–342.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some pre-Code movies suffered irreparable damage from censorship after 1934. When studios attempted to re-issue films from the 1920s and early 1930s, they were forced to make extensive cuts. Films such as ''[[Mata Hari (1931 film)|Mata Hari]]'' (1931), ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (1931), and ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1932) exist only in their censored versions. Many other films survived intact because they were too controversial to be re-released, such as ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1931 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1931), which was remade a decade later with the same name, and thus never had their master negatives edited.&lt;ref&gt;Vieira, pg. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of ''[[Convention City]]'' (1933), which Breen would not allow to be re-released in any form, the entire film remains missing. Although it has been rumored that all prints and negatives were ordered destroyed by Jack Warner in the late thirties,&lt;ref&gt;Vieira, pp.&amp;nbsp;211–212, 230&lt;/ref&gt; further research shows the negative was in the vaults as late as 1948 when it was junked due to nitrate decomposition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chiseler.org/post/1562863854/where-is-convention-city-hiding Where is Convention City hiding?], chiseler.org; accessed August 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rigdum Funnidos''' is a character in [[Henry Carey (writer)|Henry Carey]]'s ''[[Chrononhotonthologos]]'' (1734).  Rigdum Funnidos is the comically plain-spoken contrast to the bombastic [[Aldiborontiphoscophornio]].  Both are courtiers, but whereas Aldiborontiphoscophornio might explain, when asked who [[Somnus]] is,
:"The Son of ''[[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]]'' and of ''[[Erebus]],''
:Incestuous Pair! Brother of ''[[Mors (mythology)|Mors]]'' relentless,
:Whose speckled Robe and Wings of blackest Hue,
:Astonish all Mankind with hedeous Glare;
:Himself with sable Plumes to Men benevolent
:Brings downy Slumbers and refreshing Sleep,"
Rigdum Funnidos responds,
:"This Gentleman may come of a very good Family, for aught I know; but I would not be in his Place for all the World." (I i, 47-54).
Rigdum is both a [[Sancho Panza]] to the absurd Aldiborontiphoscophornio and a figure of the "Plain Dealer" (see ''[[The Plain Dealer (play)|The Plain Dealer]]'' by [[William Wycherly]]).

It is also [[Sir Walter Scott]]'s nickname for [[John Ballantyne (publisher)|John Ballantyne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/ballant.htm |title=John Ballantyne |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050731100720/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/ballant.htm |archivedate=31 July 2005 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott's epithet was a compliment. Conversely Aldiborontiphoscophornio was Scott's name for [[James Ballantyne]] in allusion to his pompous manner.&lt;ref name="Clarke"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pseudonyms|author=Joseph F.

'''Sambe''' ({{lang-ko|삼베}}), or [[Hemp#fiber|hemp fiber]], is a traditional fiber for Korean clothing. The knowledge of weaving sambe skillfully is being lost, has been deemed a national treasure, and specific individuals with the ability were designated [[Heritage preservation in South Korea|intangible cultural asset]]s.{{sfn|Cho|2007}} Sambe was the primary textile fiber used in clothing for commoners prior to the introduction of cotton to Korea in the late 15th century.{{sfn|Yi|2008|p=55}} A particularly fine variety is ''andongpo'' from [[Andong]], [[North Gyeongsang Province]].{{sfn|Yi|2008|p=55}}{{sfn|Clarke|2006|p=54}}{{sfn|Chung|2015}}

A [[Korean traditional funeral]] includes a sambe death dress for the deceased and sambe clothing for mourners.{{sfn|Kendall|Dix|1987|pp=80-82}} After commercial relations between China and Korea resumed in 1990, Chinese-made hemp cloth began to replace Korean cloth.{{sfn|Koh|2007}}

'''Schleberoda''' is a village and a former municipality in the [[Burgenlandkreis]] district, in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], [[Germany]]. Since 1 July 2009, it is part of the town [[Freyburg, Germany|Freyburg]].

It has been proposed by Germany for inscription in the List of [[World Heritage]]. The World Heritage nomination [[Naumburg Cathedral and the High Medieval Cultural Landscape of the Rivers Saale and Unstrut]] is representative for the processes that shaped the continent during the [[High Middle Ages]] between 1000 and 1300: [[Christianization]], the so-called [[Landesausbau]] and the dynamics of cultural exchange and transfer characteristic for this very period.&lt;ref name="Bartlett"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of Europe: Conquest, Colonization and Cultural Change 950-1350|last=Bartlett|first=Robert|date=1994|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
Schleberoda is located north of the [[Unstrut]]. It was founded as a result of intensive land development by clearance in the [[High Middle Ages]] such as other villages with ″root″ (Roda) in the name (e.g. Albersroda, Baumersorda, Schnellroda, Ebersroda and Schleberoda).    
The closely bordering local nobles in the area separated their territories using stone landmarks, as is still visible at the historic edges of the nearby woods, authentic landmarks which have been unchanged since the High Middle Ages: The clearance work and founding of new villages ran southwards from the original parish of Mücheln and ended at the Neue Göhle forest, which belonged to the territory of the [[Landgrave of Thuringia|Landgraves of Thuringia]] and could therefore not be cleared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Linien und Säume, Zonen und Räume an der Ostgrenze des Reiches im frühen und hohen Mittelalter.|trans-title=Lines and frontiers, zones and spaces at the Eastern border of the empire of the Early and High Medieval Ages|pages=39–56|author=Hardt, Matthias|publisher=Wien|date=2000|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The forest Neue Göhle (Old Sorbian name gola = heath forest) has survived as a continuous, large forest complex. It was used for the production of pole wood in the context of [[winegrowing]] at a very early point in time, which is why it had been afforested in the form of coppice-with-standards.  Stone landmarks, ditches, banks and paths are still visible at the historic edges of this woods separated the territories of the closely bordering local nobles in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=1913|language=German|trans-title=On the history of the so-called ″circular villages" in the region of Naumburg. An agricultural research.|title=Zur Geschichte der sogenannten "Kreisdörfer" im Naumburger Kreise. Eine agrarhistorische Studie.|author=Naumann, Louis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
Schleberoda has retained the structures and authentic form dating from the time of its foundation. It is an examples of the land development in the contact area between [[Germans]] and [[Slavs]] in the [[High Middle Ages]]. It has been able to retain its original ground plan as a radial round village dating from the High Middle Ages.  Around the original village [[pond]], serving for fire-fighting, and the bake house, replaced at the end of the [[18th century]], forward-gabled and side-gabled buildings are grouped, some made with packed loam, with high-quality portals dating from the [[16th century|16th]] to [[19th century]]. 
The position of the former gate to the compact village settlement is still identifiable today. Including the outer boundary of the official village area is not only identifiable by a circumferential path and has survived in its original form to the north-west in the shape of an impenetrable hedge. The [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] choir tower of the village church with coupled abat sons has survived.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6587">The '''siren suit''' is a one-piece garment for the whole body which is easily put on or taken off, originally designed for use on the way to and in [[air-raid shelters]].&lt;ref&gt;URL:http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/siren-suit?q=siren+suit. Accessed: 2013-06-20. (Archived by WebCite® at https://www.webcitation.org/6HViXEs1y)&lt;/ref&gt; The suit solved the problems of warmth and modesty encountered when seeking shelter during nighttime [[Strategic bombing|air raids]] in the [[United Kingdom]] during [[World War II]].  It was roomy and could be put on over night clothes quickly when an imminent air raid was announced by the [[siren (noisemaker)|sirens]].

The suit was worn by both children and adults when sheltering in either back garden or public shelters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/69/a2736669.shtml |title=WW2 People's War - My Homemade 'Siren Suit' |publisher=BBC |date=2004-06-12 |accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tatler"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://battleofbritainblog.com/historical-documents/tatler-magazine-summer-1940/ |title=Tatler Magazine, Summer 1940 &amp;#124; Battle of Britain Day by Day |publisher=Battleofbritainblog.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Winston Churchill during the Second World War in the United Kingdom H38661.jpg|thumb|Winston Churchill wearing a siren suit beside British Field Marshall [[Bernard Montgomery, 1st Viscount Montgomery of Alamein|Bernard Montgomery]] during the Second World War in the United Kingdom]]

Similar in style to [[boilersuit]]s worn by many workers including mechanics, brick layers and tank crews to protect their standard clothing, the siren suit was invented by [[Winston Churchill]] as an original leisure suit in the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Reynolds1963"&gt;{{cite book|author=Quentin James Reynolds|title=Winston Churchill|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FNgEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=12 March 2013|date=1 November 1963|publisher=Random House|page=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played a large part in popularising it as an item of clothing during World War II, wearing it regularly, including when meeting other important people such as U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], General [[Dwight Eisenhower]]&lt;ref name="Inc1942"&gt;{{cite book|author=Time Inc|title=LIFE|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C04EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=11 March 2013|date=19 January 1942|publisher=Time Inc|page=23|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bJ9aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-E4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4449,5907553|title=Prescott Evening Courier - Google News Archive Search|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advantages of clothing that could be easily and quickly put on over other clothing led to the adoption of this style of suit during the war by many who were forced to leave their homes to seek shelter during [[strategic bombing|air raids]]. That these raids were announced by the sound of sirens led to the adoption of their name.

==Construction==

Cut loose, with [[zipper]]ed and button closures, a belt and large simple pockets, siren suits were made of many fabrics but most typically wool or other materials available under clothing [[rationing]]. Suits could be bought ready made&lt;ref name="tatler" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Veillon2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dominique Veillon|title=Fashion Under the Occupation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CzZP1Beq2iAC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=25 March 2013|date=1 October 2002|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-85973-548-0|pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a pattern from which they could be hand made with available fabrics. 

Some suits had a panel at the back that opened to allow the wearer to use the toilet while still wearing the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ahistoryoftheworld/objects/IK_JlUpjSfCAqyvCm-nKtw |title=A History of the World – Object : Siren Suit |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2013-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

Winston Churchill was a famous wearer, having a pin stripe version which he wore during the war years and then for portraits by [[Oscar Nemon]] and [[Frank O. Salisbury]] after the war in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Vanessa Thorpe and John Vincent |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/nov/10/artsandhumanities.politics |title=Churchill's Blitz siren suit put up for auction &amp;#124; UK news &amp;#124; The Observer |publisher=Guardian |date= 11 November 2002|accessdate=2013-06-19 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another suit, made of bottle-green velvet, was created for him by [[Turnbull &amp; Asser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/news-features/TMG8737053/Turnbull-and-Asser-The-best-of-British.html |title=Turnbull &amp; Asser: The best of British - Telegraph |publisher=Fashion.telegraph.co.uk |date= 2 September 2011|accessdate=2013-06-19 |location=London |first=Luke |last=Leitch}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his gray pinstripe suits was sold in 2002 for £29,875.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennett |first=Will |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1415948/30000-for-Churchills-suit.html |title=£30,000 for Churchill's suit |publisher=Telegraph |date=2002-12-13 |accessdate=2013-06-19 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The company was founded by Will Dennis and Jeff Noh in May 2011.&lt;ref name=MikeButcherTC /&gt; The idea for Spinlister arose after Dennis listed his own bike for rent on [[Craigslist]] in New York City and saw interest from both locals and tourists to rent it out for more than a few hours.&lt;ref name=JPan_Mashable&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pan |first1=Joann |title=SpinLister Creates Online Hub for Bike Rentals in NYC, SF|url=http://mashable.com/2012/04/02/spinlister-bike-rentals-in-ny-sf/  |publisher=Mashable Inc. |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's first two markets were New York City and San Francisco&lt;ref name=MikeButcherTC /&gt;&lt;ref name=JBrustein_NYT&gt;{{cite news |last1=Brustein |first1=Joshua|title=There's More Than One Way to Share a Bike|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/19/nyregion/spinlister-and-social-bicycles-develop-bike-sharing-alternatives.html |accessdate=26 August 2015|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and started with only bike listings from individuals or existing [[Bike rental|bike rental shops]].&lt;ref name=MikeButcherTC /&gt;

'''''Stay''''' are identical [[cast iron]] human form sculptures made by [[Antony Gormley]] and installed in two locations in the [[Christchurch Central City|central city]] of [[Christchurch]], [[New Zealand]]. The first sculpture was installed in the [[Avon River (Canterbury)|Avon River]] in September 2015. The second sculpture is still in storage at [[Canterbury Museum, Christchurch|Canterbury Museum]], to be installed in the north quadrangle of the [[Christchurch Arts Centre|Arts Centre]] in early 2016.

==Background==
Gormley visited Christchurch in 2007&lt;ref name="Press first article"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Gates |first1=Charlie |title=Antony Gormley's sculpture for Christchurch city centre revealed &lt;!-- printed title was: "'Healing' sculptures for city revealed" --&gt; |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/art-and-stage/72252404/antony-gormleys-sculpture-for-christchurch-city-centre-revealed |accessdate=30 September 2015 |work=[[The Press]] |date=22 September 2015 |page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remembers it as a city "blessed with open spaces and relatively wide streets and no great high-rises".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Harper |first1=Jenny |title=A Dark and Empty Interior |url=http://christchurchartgallery.org.nz/bulletin/168/a-dark-and-empty-interior/ |publisher=[[Christchurch Art Gallery]] |accessdate=30 September 2015 |date=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central city received massive damage in the February [[2011 Christchurch earthquake]]. Gormley was approached in 2014&lt;ref name="Gormley statue installed"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Campbell |first1=Georgina |title=First Gormley statue put in place &lt;!-- printed title; online title was "Gormley statue installed on the Avon River" --&gt; |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/christchurch-life/art-and-stage/visual-art/72528425/gormley-statue-installed-on-the-avon-river |accessdate=30 September 2015 |work=[[The Press]] |date=30 September 2015 |page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt; about contributing an artwork to Christchurch, and he provided two identical cast iron sculptures that can contribute to the 'healing' of the city, as he called it.&lt;ref name="Press first article" /&gt;

{{quote|text=Christchurch is a well-ordered city based on a 19th century urban plan which suddenly became chaotic through planetary forces rupturing human design. SCAPE 8 presents the ideal opportunity to ask whether art can instigate and give space for new attitudes and begin to heal and encourage reconciliation. Post-quake, this city is a human habitat forced by nature to reformulate. The attitude of the work I have made for it carries a sense of reflection or 'taking stock'.|author=Antony Gormley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stay |url=http://www.scapepublicart.org.nz/scape-8-antony-gormley/ |publisher=Scape Public Art |accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gormley stated that he made his work available at a discounted rate, and had therefore asked for the price not to be revealed.&lt;ref name="Lynch criticism"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lynch |first1=Chris |title=Chris Lynch: Who signed off on the sculpture? |url=http://www.newstalkzb.co.nz/opinion/chris-lynch-who-signed-off-on-the-sculpture/ |accessdate=30 September 2015 |work=[[Newstalk ZB]] |date=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purchase and installation was funded by [[Christchurch City Council]] (CCC) and the [[Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority]] (CERA). CCC contributed [[New Zealand dollar|NZ$]]502,500 towards the cost, whilst CERA would not disclose the size of their contribution.&lt;ref name="Press first article" /&gt;

The first announcement about the legacy (i.e. permanent) artworks by Gormley was made in April 2015, when it was revealed that his work was to be installed in Christchurch as part of the Scape8 public art exhibition, to be held from 3 October to 15 November 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SCAPE 8 Public Art Christchurch Biennial |url=http://www.biennialfoundation.org/2015/04/scape-8-public-art-christchurch-biennial-participating-artists-announced/ |publisher=Biennial Foundation |accessdate=30 September 2015 |date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The local newspaper, ''[[The Press]]'', reported on 22 September 2015 of the pending installation of the first sculpture in the Avon River, just upstream from the Gloucester Street Bridge.&lt;ref name="Press first article" /&gt; A {{convert|6|m}} pile was screwed into the riverbed, and the sculpture installed onto this foundation on 29 September. This was the first work of Gormley installed in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Gormley statue installed" /&gt;

==Arts Centre installation==

In early 2016, the second sculpture is to be installed in the north quadrangle of the [[Christchurch Arts Centre]]. As of October 2015, the main part of the Arts Centre is still under earthquake repair and not accessible to the public as yet.&lt;ref name="Gormley statue installed" /&gt;

==Series overview==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2015}}

===Super Sentai Series===
In every Super Sentai Series, the protagonists are a team of people who – using wrist-worn or hand-held devices – transform into superheroes and gain superpowers – color-coded uniforms, [[signature weapon]]s, sidearms, and fighting skills – to battle a group of evil beings that threaten to take over the Earth. In a typical episode, the heroes thwart the enemies' plans and defeat an army of enemy soldiers and the [[Villain of the week|monster of the week]] before an enlarged version of the monster confronts them, only to be defeated again when the heroes fight it with their [[mecha]]. Each Super Sentai Series is set in its own [[fictional universe]]; various TV, video and film specials feature a team-up between one or more teams.

The series was created by [[Shotaro Ishinomori]],{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} then known for the 1971–1973 ''[[Kamen Rider]]'' TV series and the long-running manga ''[[Cyborg 009]]''. He developed the first two Super Sentai Series ''[[Himitsu Sentai Gorenger]]'', which ran from 1975 to 1977, and ''[[J.A.K.Q. Dengekitai]]'', released in 1977. [[Toei Company]] put the franchise on hiatus in 1978,{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} collaborating with [[Marvel Comics]] to produce a live action ''[[Spider-Man (Toei TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series, which added giant robots to the concept of ''tokusatsu'' shows. The giant robot concept was carried over to Toei and Marvel's next show, ''[[Battle Fever J]]'', released in 1979, and was then used throughout the Super Sentai Series.

===''Power Rangers''===
{{Main|Power Rangers}}
In 1993, American production company [[Saban Entertainment]] adapted 1992's ''Kyōryū Sentai Zyuranger'' into ''[[Mighty Morphin Power Rangers]]'' for the [[Fox Kids]] programming block, combining the original Japanese action footage with new footage featuring American actors for the story sequences. Since then, nearly every ''Super Sentai'' series that followed became a new season of ''Power Rangers''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} Some countries, such as France, Brazil, Thailand, and the Philippines, switched from broadcasting ''Super Sentai'' to ''Power Rangers''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} In 2002, Saban sold the ''Power Rangers'' franchise to [[Disney]]'s [[Buena Vista (brand)|Buena Vista]] division,{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} who owned it until 2010, broadcasting ''Power Rangers'' on [[ABC Kids (United States)|ABC Kids]], [[ABC Family Channel]], [[Jetix]], and [[Toon Disney]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} On 12 May 2010, Saban bought the franchise back from Disney, moving the show to the [[Nickelodeon]] network for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Littleton|first1=Cynthia|title=Saban re-acquires rights to ‘Rangers’|url=https://variety.com/2010/film/news/saban-re-acquires-rights-to-rangers-1118019212/|website=Variety|accessdate=12 May 2010|date=12 May 2010|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130418121206/http://variety.com/2010/film/news/saban-re-acquires-rights-to-rangers-1118019212/|archivedate=18 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May 2018, toy company [[Hasbro]] announced they had acquired the ''Power Rangers'' franchise from Saban Capital Group for $522 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arrant|first1=Chris|title=SABAN Sells POWER RANGERS for $522 Million|url=https://www.newsarama.com/39721-power-rangers-sold-to-hasbro.html|website=Newsarama|accessdate=May 8, 2018|language=en|date=May 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trobriand cricket''' refers to a unique version of the [[bat-and-ball games|bat-and-ball]] [[sport]] [[cricket]] played by the [[Trobriand Islands|Trobriand Islanders]].&lt;ref&gt;This article relies '''heavily''' on class notes created by Jennifer S. Esperanza of [[North Carolina State University]]: Esperanza, JS. ''[http://sasw.chass.ncsu.edu/s&amp;a/people/lecturers/esperanza/class_materials/ant495K/trobriand_cricket.doc Trobriand cricket]''. 2004. Retrieved on 2008-04-16.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=September 2017}} They were first exposed to the game by [[Christian]] [[missionaries]], who thought the game would discourage war among the natives.  However, the game was quickly adapted to Trobriand culture by expanding the number of players, adding dances and chanting, and modifying the bats and balls.  Since war between groups on the island was banned, cricket began to incorporate many of the traditional practices associated with war for the Trobriand people.  The game also reflects the objects of powers introduced to the islands by its [[British empire|British colonizers]] and American troops during [[World War II]].

==Historical background==
Cricket was introduced to the Trobriand Islands in 1903 by the [[British people|British]] [[Methodist]] missionary [[William Gillmore]], who hoped to reduce [[tribalism|tribal]] rivalry and fighting. The modern-day version is very different from the game introduced by Gillmore, as new rules and traditions have been integrated. 

==Anthropological analysis==
{{Original research|section|date=April 2008}}
In the Trobriand Islands, ''kayasa'' is a form of obligatory, competitive activity done traditionally in the form of [[Endemic warfare|ritual warfare]]. Warfare with spears was replaced by cricket, as a peaceful way of continuing ''kayasa''. 

Trobriand cricket has been altered such that the [[home (sports)|home team]] is always the winner. There are no restrictions on the number of players on a team; thus, a team can have as many as 40 or 50 players. 

Before the match, the ball and bats are given to a local spiritual leader who blesses the equipment for good luck. Also, this leader works on ensuring good weather. Before the match, each team practices chants and dances to be performed at various times throughout the game. Each [[dismissal (cricket)|out]] is followed by a celebratory dance, [[choreography (dance)|choreographed]] by the opposing team. These dances often have special meaning, commenting on the prowess of the team, their superior skills, or mocking the other team. These dances may also have [[sexual innuendo]]s and [[erotic]] themes. 

[[Bowling (cricket)|Bowling]] is done [[underarm bowling|underarm]] (as in [[softball]]), rather than [[overarm bowling|overarm]] as in international cricket. This change came about because underhanded-bowled balls are less painful if they contact with a player.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Trobriand Cricket (film)|Trobriand Cricket]]''. Dir. Gary Kildea and Jerry Leach. [[Ronin Films]], 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are ritual entrance and exit dances. One team had a mascot dressed as a tourist (dressed in bright colors, stopping in front of the performances to get a “close-up” view with his pretend binoculars).  At the end of the match, there is an exchange of food, with the home team putting on the feast.

Other Trobriand changes to cricket include the following:
*The visiting team bats first
*The [[Bat (cricket)|bat]] and [[cricket ball|ball]] are not regular
*Teams bowl alternately from each end of the [[pitch (cricket)|pitch]]
*Scoring varies considerably — for example, six [[run (cricket)|runs]] are scored by a lost ball or by hitting the ball over a tree (compare to the standard [[boundary (cricket)|boundary]] rules)
*The [[umpire]] is from the batting side, and when sides change the umpire does as well
*Rather than with the awarding of trophies, games conclude with a feast put on by the home team.

Today, cricket holds special meaning for the local population of the Trobriands. It has evolved to take on warlike aspects. For example, players’ bodies are decorated in bright colors and designs, similar to those displayed by warriors. The field entry and exit dances take on a warlike formation. 

Trobriand cricket is an example of [[syncretism]]. Usually, syncretic cultures or traditions take elements from both the existing, “traditional” culture and elements from “outsiders” such as colonists, occupiers, or missionaries.

==In popular culture==
Trobriand cricket was featured in an episode of the 2007 BBC series ''[[Last Man Standing (UK TV series)|Last Man Standing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/lastmanstanding/about/index.shtml BBC - Last Man Standing - About The Show&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080111003148/http://www.bbc.co.uk/lastmanstanding/about/index.shtml |date=2008-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the song "Steak n' Sabre", written by [[Black Francis|Frank Black]] and recorded by Frank Black and the Catholics, and which Black has stated is about alternate realities, he references "Trobriander" cricket:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pledgemusic.com/projects/frankblackboxset/updates/45496 “Steak ’n Sabre” track notes and lyrics from Frank Black]&lt;/ref&gt; "Like Trobrianders / Don't you understand that's a different kind of world."
