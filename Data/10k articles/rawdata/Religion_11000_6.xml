'''Adon''' ({{lang-phn|ê§Äê§Éê§ç}})  literally means "lord." Adon has an uncertain etymology, although it is generally believed to be derived from the [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] ad, ‚Äúfather.‚Äù&lt;ref name="DDD"&gt;{{Cite book  | editors = K. van der Toorn, Bob Becking, Pieter Willem van der Horst | title = Dictionary of Deities and Demons in the Bible DDD | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yCkRz5pfxz0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=dictionary+of+deities+and+demons+in+the+bible&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xbpiVLq2N8vmsATYsoGYCg&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=lord&amp;f=false | year = 1999| publisher = Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 531}}

==Ugaritic tradition==

The pluralization of Adon "my lord" is ''[[Adonai]]'' "my lords."&lt;ref name="Yiddish"&gt;{{Cite book  | author = Leo Rosten| title = The New Joys of Yiddish: Completely Updated | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=V04IRE3SwmgC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=Adonai+my+lords&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KrViVJ_bJ6THsQTLrIH4Bg&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Adonai%20my%20lords&amp;f=false| origyear = 1968| year = 2010| publisher = Crown Publishing Group| pages = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Otto Eissfeldt]] theorizes that Adonai is a post positive element attested to in Ugaritic writing. He points to the myth of the struggle between [[Baal]] and [[Yam (god)|Yam]] as evidence.&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt;{{rp| 531}} Some theorize that Adonai was originally an epithet of the god [[Yahweh]] depicted as the chief antagonist of "the ''Ba`al''s" in the [[Tanakh]]. Only later did the epithet come to be used as an [[Adonaist|euphemism]] to avoid invoking the deity's proper name, [[Tetragrammaton|Yahweh]].

In Canaanite/Ugaritic tradition, '' æadn ilm'', literally "lord of gods" is an epithet of [[El (god)|El]].&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt;{{rp| 532}} However, '' æadn'' "lord" could also be an epithet of other gods. When [[Yam (god)|Yam]] is described as being at the zenith of his might, he is proclaimed '' æadn'' or "lord" of the gods.&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt;{{rp| 532}} In some [[Ugaritic]] texts the term '' æadn  æilm rbm'' meaning "the Lord of the Great Gods" is used to refer to the lord and father over deceased kings&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt;{{rp| 532}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | editors = Cyrus H.

Other suggest this is a reference to a human necromancer traveling to the land of the dead. [[Karel van der Toorn]] disagrees he believes that it is a reference to [[Milku]], [[Yaqar]] or [[Yarikh]] or possibly [[El (god)|El]]&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt;{{rp| 532}} [[Ugarit]] family households were modeled after the structure of the divine world, each headed by an ''  æadn'' meaning in this context "master" or "patron". Generally, this was the [[patriarch]] of the family and there may be some relation between '' æadn'' and the Ugarit word for "father", '' æad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | editors = Stephen L.

==Etymology==

The name of the Greek god [[Adonis]] is similar to a Semitic word‚Äî''[[adon]]'' (which means "[[lord]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.eb.com/levels/referencecenter/article/3772|title=Britannica Library|website=library.eb.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet there is no trace of a Semitic deity directly connected with Adonis,&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and no trace in Semitic languages of any specific [[mytheme]]s connected with his Greek myth; both Greek and Near Eastern scholars have questioned the connection.&lt;ref&gt;Burkert, p 177 note 6 bibliography&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hebrew Bible==

In the Hebrew Bible, ''adoni'' (‚Äúmy lord‚Äù) is always a non-deity title usually referring to a human superior or occasionally an angel, whereas ''adonai'' (literally "my lords") is reserved for God alone. In Jewish tradition, the pluralization is used to distinguish God from earthly lords and to increase his majesty.&lt;ref name="Yiddish"/&gt; However, many modern critical scholars see the use of a plural as a remnant of a [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] past, with the word only later coming to refer to [[Yahweh]], the single god of Judaism. It is thought that at least some biblical authors used the word originally in a polytheist sense.&lt;ref name="DDD" /&gt;{{rp| 531}}

'''Aga Syed Mohammad Baqir Kirmani''' ([[Urdu]]ÿ¢ÿ∫ÿß ÿ≥€åÿØ ŸÖÿ≠ŸÖÿØ ÿ®ÿßŸÇÿ± ⁄©ÿ±ŸÖÿßŸÜ€å) was a religious cleric who came from [[Kirman]], [[Iran]] in [[Kashmir]] to spread the message of [[Islam]]. Perhaps he was one of the companions of [[Mir Syed Ali Hamdani]]. He came here in 1374 A.D. Another tradition is that he came with founder of [[Shiaism]] in [[Kashmir]]
[[Mir Sham ud-Din Iraqi]] in 1500 A.D. to [[Kashmir]].   He stayed at [[Wahabpora]] for a long period of time. He died here and was buried at [[Wahabpora]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Mosavi Dictionary of local words, Page No. 38-39&lt;/ref&gt; He was a great jurist, teacher and preacher.

'''''Amanita muscaria''''', commonly known as the '''fly agaric''' or '''fly amanita''', is a [[basidiomycete]] of the genus ''[[Amanita]]''. It is also a [[muscimol mushroom]]. Native throughout the [[temperate]] and [[boreal ecosystem|boreal]] regions of the Northern Hemisphere, ''Amanita muscaria'' has been unintentionally [[introduced species|introduced]] to many countries in the Southern Hemisphere, generally as a [[symbiont]] with pine and birch plantations, and is now a true [[Cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] species. It [[mycorrhiza|associates]] with various [[deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] trees.

Arguably the most iconic [[toadstool]] species, the fly agaric is a large white-[[lamella (mycology)|gilled]], white-spotted, usually red mushroom, and is one of the most recognisable and widely encountered in popular culture.

Although classified as [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]], reports of human deaths resulting from its ingestion are extremely rare. After [[parboiling]]‚Äîwhich weakens its toxicity and breaks down the mushroom's psychoactive substances‚Äîit is eaten in parts of Europe, Asia, and North America. ''Amanita muscaria'' is noted for its [[hallucinogenic]] properties, with its main psychoactive constituents being the compounds [[ibotenic acid]] and [[muscimol]]. The mushroom was used as an intoxicant and [[entheogen]] by the [[peoples of Siberia]], and has a religious significance in these cultures. There has been much speculation on possible traditional use of this mushroom as an intoxicant in other places such as the Middle East, Eurasia, North America, and Scandinavia.

==Taxonomy and naming==
The name of the [[mushroom]] in many European languages is thought to be derived from its use as an [[insecticide]] when sprinkled in milk. This practice has been recorded from [[Germanic languages|Germanic-]] &lt;!--(bar England)--&gt; and [[Slavic languages|Slavic-speaking]] parts of Europe, as well as the [[Vosges Mountains|Vosges]] region and pockets elsewhere in France, and Romania.&lt;ref name=Wasson1968&gt;{{cite book |title=Soma: Divine Mushroom of Immortality |last=Wasson |first=R. Gordon|year=1968|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovick |location= |isbn=0-88316-517-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|198}} [[Albertus Magnus]] was the first to record it in his work ''De vegetabilibus'' some time before 1256,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=De vegetabilibus |author=Magnus A.|authorlink=Albertus Magnus |year=1256|chapter=Book&amp;nbsp;II, Chapter 6; p 87 and Book&amp;nbsp;VI, Chapter 7; p 345|publisher= |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt; commenting ''vocatur fungus muscarum, eo quod in lacte pulverizatus interficit muscas'', "it is called the fly mushroom because it is powdered in milk to kill flies."&lt;ref name = "Ramsbottom44"&gt;Ramsbottom, p 44.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Fly Agaric mushroom 05.jpg|thumb|Showing the partial veil under the cap dropping away to form a ring around the stipe]]
The 16th-century Flemish botanist [[Carolus Clusius]] traced the practice of sprinkling it into milk to [[Frankfurt]] in Germany,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rariorum plantarum historia |author=Clusius C.|authorlink=Carolus Clusius |year=1601|chapter=Genus&amp;nbsp;XII of the pernicious mushrooms |publisher= |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Carl Linnaeus]], the "father of taxonomy", reported it from [[Sm√•land]] in southern Sweden, where he had lived as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =Linnaeus C.| authorlink=Carl Linnaeus | title=Flora svecica [suecica] exhibens plantas per regnum Sueciae crescentes systematice cum differentiis specierum, synonymis autorum, nominibus incolarum, solo locorum, usu pharmacop√¶orum| publisher=Laurentii Salvii |location=Stockholm | year=1745| pages=|language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described it in volume two of his ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' in 1753, giving it the name ''Agaricus muscarius'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Linnaeus C | title=Species Plantarum| publisher=Laurentii Salvii |location=Stockholm | year=1753|chapter= Tomus&amp;nbsp;II | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/359193| page=1172|language=la}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[specific name (botany)|specific epithet]] deriving from [[Latin]] ''musca'' meaning "fly".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Simpson DP | title = Cassell's Latin dictionary | publisher = Cassell Ltd. | year= 1979 | edition = 5th | location = London | page = 883 | isbn = 0-304-52257-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gained its current name in 1783, when placed in the genus ''[[Amanita]]'' by [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]], a [[sanctioned name|name sanctioned]] in 1821 by the "father of mycology", Swedish naturalist [[Elias Magnus Fries]]. The starting date for all the [[mycota]] had been set by general agreement as January 1, 1821, the date of Fries's work, and so the full name was then ''Amanita muscaria'' (L.:Fr.) [[William Jackson Hooker|Hook]]. The 1987 edition of the [[International Code of Botanical Nomenclature]] changed the rules on the starting date and primary work for names of fungi, and names can now be considered valid as far back as May 1, 1753, the date of publication of Linnaeus's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Esser K|author2=Lemke PA | title = The Mycota: a comprehensive treatise on fungi as experimental systems for basic and applied research | publisher = Springer | year= 1994| page = 181| isbn = 3-540-66493-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, Linnaeus and Lamarck are now taken as the namers of ''Amanita muscaria'' (L.) Lam..

The English mycologist [[John Ramsbottom (mycologist)|John Ramsbottom]] reported that ''Amanita muscaria'' was used for getting rid of bugs in England and Sweden, and ''bug agaric'' was an old alternative name for the species.&lt;ref name = "Ramsbottom44"/&gt; French mycologist [[Jean Baptiste Fran√ßois Pierre Bulliard|Pierre Bulliard]] reported having tried without success to replicate its fly-killing properties in his work ''{{lang|fr|Histoire des plantes v√©n√©neuses et suspectes de la France}}'' (1784), and proposed a new binomial name ''Agaricus pseudo-aurantiacus'' because of this.&lt;ref name=Wasson1968/&gt;{{rp|200}} One compound isolated from the fungus is 1,3-diolein ( 1,3-Di(cis-9-octadecenoyl)glycerol), which attracts insects.&lt;ref name = "Bnejamin95"/&gt;
It has been hypothesised that the flies intentionally seek out the fly agaric for its intoxicating properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Animals and psychedelics: the natural world and the instinct to alter consciousness|first=Giorgio|last=Samorini|year=2002|isbn=0-89281-986-3|at=823/1251 (67%) in Kindle edition}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An alternative derivation proposes that the term ''fly-'' refers not to insects as such but rather the [[delirium]] resulting from consumption of the fungus. This is based on the medieval belief that flies could enter a person's head and cause mental illness.&lt;ref name = "Michelot03"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Michelot D |author2=Melendez-Howell LM. |title=''Amanita muscaria'': chemistry, biology, toxicology, and ethnomycology |journal=Mycological Research |volume=107 |issue=Pt 2 |pages=131‚Äì46 |year=2003 |pmid=12747324 |doi=10.1017/S0953756203007305}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several regional names appear to be linked with this connotation, meaning the "mad" or "fool's" version of the highly regarded edible mushroom ''[[Amanita caesarea]]''. Hence there is ''{{lang|ca|oriol foll}}'' "mad oriol" in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], ''mujolo folo'' from [[Toulouse]], ''{{lang|fr|concourlo fouolo}}'' from the [[Aveyron]] department in Southern France, ''{{lang|it|ovolo matto}}'' from [[Trentino]] in Italy. A local dialect name in [[Fribourg]] in Switzerland is ''tsapi de diablhou'', which translates as "Devil's hat".&lt;ref name=Wasson1968/&gt;{{rp|194}}

===Classification===
''Amanita muscaria'' is the [[type species]] of the genus. By extension, it is also the type species of ''Amanita'' [[subgenus]] ''Amanita'', as well as section ''Amanita'' within this subgenus.

====Controversy====
[[File:Amanita muscaria var. formosa sensu Thiers.jpg|thumb|right|upright|''Amanita muscaria'' var. ''formosa'' is now a synonym for ''Amanita muscaria'' var. ''guessowii''.&lt;ref name=tulloss2 /&gt;]]

''Amanita muscaria'' varies considerably in its morphology, and many authorities recognize several subspecies or varieties within the species. In ''The Agaricales in Modern Taxonomy'', German mycologist [[Rolf Singer]] listed three subspecies, though without description: ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' ssp. ''muscaria'', ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' ssp. ''americana'', and ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' ssp. ''flavivolvata''.&lt;ref name=singer/&gt;

However, a 2006 molecular phylogenetic study of different regional populations of ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' by mycologist J√≥zsef Geml and colleagues found three distinct [[clade]]s within this species representing, roughly, Eurasian, Eurasian "subalpine", and North American populations. Specimens belonging to all three clades have been found in Alaska; this has led to the hypothesis that this was the centre of diversification for this species. The study also looked at four named varieties of the species: var. ''alba'', var. ''flavivolvata'', var. ''formosa'' (including var. ''guessowii''), and var. ''regalis'' from both areas. All four varieties were found within both the Eurasian and North American clades, evidence that these morphological forms are [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphisms]] rather than distinct subspecies or varieties.&lt;ref name="Geml06"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Geml J |author2=Laursen GA |author3=O'Neill K |author4=Nusbaum HC |author5=Taylor DL |title=Beringian origins and cryptic speciation events in the fly agaric (''Amanita muscaria'') |journal=Molecular Ecology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=225‚Äì39 |date=January 2006 |pmid=16367842 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2005.02799.x |url=http://www.lter.uaf.edu/pdf/1190_Geml_Laursen_2006.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716142858/http://www.lter.uaf.edu/pdf/1190_Geml_Laursen_2006.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further molecular study by Geml and colleagues published in 2008 show that these three genetic groups, plus a fourth associated with oak‚Äìhickory‚Äìpine forest in the southeastern United States and two more on [[Santa Cruz Island]] in California, are delineated from each other enough genetically to be considered separate species; thus ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' as it stands currently is evidently a [[cryptic species complex|species complex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Geml, J. |author2=Tulloss, R.

==Description==
[[File:Amanita muscaria section 1 WF orig.jpg|thumb|right|Cross section of fruiting body, showing pigment under skin and free gills|alt=A white-fleshed mushroom with a red skin cut in half]]
A large, conspicuous [[mushroom]], ''Amanita muscaria'' is generally common and numerous where it grows, and is often found in groups with [[basidiocarp]]s in all stages of development.
Fly agaric fruiting bodies emerge from the soil looking like white eggs. After emerging from the ground, the cap is covered with numerous small white to yellow pyramid-shaped warts. These are remnants of the [[universal veil]], a membrane that encloses the entire mushroom when it is still very young. Dissecting the mushroom at this stage will reveal a characteristic yellowish layer of skin under the veil; this is helpful in identification. As the fungus grows, the red colour appears through the broken veil and the warts become less prominent; they do not change in size, but are reduced relative to the expanding skin area. The cap changes from [[wikt:globose|globose]] to hemispherical, and finally to plate-like and flat in mature specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Zeitlmayr L.|year=1976|title=Wild mushrooms: an illustrated handbook|publisher=Hertfordshire, UK: Garden City Press|isbn=0-584-10324-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fully grown, the bright red [[pileus (mycology)|cap]] is usually around {{convert|8|‚Äì|20|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} in diameter, although larger specimens have been found. The red colour may fade after rain and in older mushrooms.

The free [[lamella (mycology)|gills]] are white, as is the [[spore print]]. The oval spores measure 9‚Äì13 by 6.5‚Äì9&amp;nbsp;[[micrometre|Œºm]]; they do not turn blue with the application of [[Melzer's reagent|iodine]].&lt;ref name="arora86"/&gt; The [[stipe (mycology)|stipe]] is white, {{convert|5|‚Äì|20|cm|in|abbr=on}} high by {{convert|1|‚Äì|2|cm|in|round=0.5|abbr=on}} wide, and has the slightly brittle, fibrous texture typical of many large mushrooms. At the base is a [[Volva (mycology)|bulb]] that bears universal veil remnants in the form of two to four distinct rings or ruffs. Between the basal universal veil remnants and gills are remnants of the [[partial veil]] (which covers the gills during development) in the form of a white [[annulus (mycology)|ring]]. It can be quite wide and flaccid with age. There is generally no associated smell other than a mild earthiness.&lt;ref name = "Ultimatemush"&gt;{{cite book| author = Jordan P|author2=Wheeler S.| year = 2001 | title = The ultimate mushroom book | publisher = Hermes House | isbn = 0-8317-3080-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phillips06&gt;{{cite book | author= Phillips R.| year = 2006 | title = Mushrooms | publisher = Pan MacMillan | isbn = 0-330-44237-6|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although very distinctive in appearance, the fly agaric has been mistaken for other yellow to red mushroom species in the Americas, such as ''[[Armillaria]]'' cf. ''mellea'' and the edible ''Amanita basii''‚Äîa Mexican species similar to ''[[Amanita caesarea|A.&amp;nbsp;caesarea]]'' of Europe.

Furthermore, the stem, gills and ring of ''A. caesarea'' are bright yellow, not white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Haas H.| year = 1969 | title = The young specialist Looks at fungi| publisher = Burke | isbn=0-222-79414-3|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The volva is a distinct white bag, not broken into scales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Krieger LCC| year = 1967 | title = The mushroom handbook| publisher = Dover| isbn=0-486-21861-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, the introduced fly agaric may be confused with the native vermilion grisette (''[[Amanita xanthocephala]]''), which grows in association with [[eucalypts]].

Ibotenic acid and muscimol are structurally related to each other and to two major [[neurotransmitter]]s of the central nervous system: [[glutamic acid]] and [[GABA]] respectively. Ibotenic acid and muscimol act like these neurotransmitters, muscimol being a potent [[GABA A receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[agonist]], while ibotenic acid is an agonist of [[NMDA receptor|NMDA glutamate receptors]] and certain [[metabotropic glutamate receptor]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J√∏rgensen, C.

===Symptoms===
Fly agarics are known for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount ingested per body weight, effects can range from [[nausea]] and twitching to drowsiness, [[cholinergic crisis]]-like effects (low [[blood pressure]], [[sweat]]ing and [[saliva]]tion), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, [[Euphoria (emotion)|euphoria]], relaxation, [[ataxia]], and [[Vertigo (medical)|loss of equilibrium]].&lt;ref name="Benjamin92"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Benjamin DR|year=1992|title=Mushroom poisoning in infants and children: the ''Amanita pantherina''/''muscaria'' group|journal=Journal of Toxicology: Clinical Toxicology|volume=30|issue=1|pages=13‚Äì22|doi=10.3109/15563659208994442|pmid=1347320}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoegberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Satora05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Buck63"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Buck, R.

In cases of serious poisoning the mushroom causes [[delirium]], somewhat similar in effect to [[anticholinergic]] poisoning (such as that caused by ''[[Datura stramonium]]''), characterised by bouts of marked [[Psychomotor agitation|agitation]] with confusion, hallucinations, and irritability followed by periods of [[central nervous system]] depression. [[Seizures]] and [[coma]] may also occur in severe poisonings.&lt;ref name="Hoegberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Satora05"/&gt; Symptoms typically appear after around 30 to 90 minutes and peak within three hours, but certain effects can last for several days.&lt;ref name="Brvar06"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brvar, M. |author2= Mozina, M.|author3= Bunc, M. |title=Prolonged psychosis after ''Amanita muscaria'' ingestion |journal=Wien.

===Treatment===
Medical attention should be sought in cases of suspected poisoning. If the delay between ingestion and treatment is less than four hours, [[activated charcoal]] is given. [[Gastric lavage]] can be considered if the patient presents within one hour of ingestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Vale, J.

There is no antidote, and supportive care is the mainstay of further treatment for intoxication. Though sometimes referred to as a [[deliriant]] and while [[muscarine]] was first isolated from ''A. muscaria'' and as such is its namesake, [[muscimol]] does not have action, either as an [[agonist]] or [[Receptor antagonist|antagonist]], at the [[muscarinic acetylcholine receptor]] site, and therefore [[atropine]] or [[physostigmine]] as an antidote is not recommended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Dart, R.

===Psychoactive use===
[[File:Mushroom in the Hills of Adelaide.jpg|alt=Amanita muscaria in Mount Lofty, South Australia|thumb|Photographed in Mount Lofty Botanic Gardens, Adelaide Hills, South Australia]]

The wide range of [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] effects have been variously described as [[depressant]], [[sedative]]-[[hypnotic]], [[Psychedelic drug|psychedelic]], [[dissociative]], and or [[deliriant]]; [[Paradoxical reaction|paradoxical effect]]s such as [[Stimulant|stimulation]] may occur however. Perceptual phenomena such as [[synesthesia]], [[macropsia]], and [[micropsia]] may occur; the latter two effects may occur simultaneously and or alternatingly as part of [[Alice in Wonderland syndrome]], collectively known as dysmetropsia, along with related distortions [[pelopsia]] and [[teleopsia]]. Some users report [[lucid dream]]ing under the influence of its hypnotic effects. Unlike ''[[Psilocybe cubensis]]'', ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' cannot be commercially [[Fungiculture|cultivated]], due to its [[mycorrhiza]]l relationship with the roots of [[pine]] trees. However, following the outlawing of [[psilocybin mushroom]]s in the United Kingdom in 2006, the sale of the still legal ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' began increasing.&lt;ref name=EMC2006&gt;{{cite book|title=Hallucinogenic mushrooms an emerging trend case study.|date=2006|publisher=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction|location=Lisbon|isbn=92-9168-249-7|url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/attachements.cfm/att_31215_EN_TP_Hallucinogenic_mushrooms.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}}

Professor [[Marija Gimbutienƒó]], a renowned Lithuanian historian, reported to [[R. Gordon Wasson]] on the use of this mushroom in Lithuania. In remote areas of [[Lithuania]] ''Amanita muscaria'' has been consumed at [[wedding feast]]s, in which mushrooms were mixed with [[vodka]]. The professor also reported that the Lithuanians used to export ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' to the [[Lapps]] in the Far North for use in [[shamanic]] rituals. The Lithuanian festivities are the only report that Wasson received of ingestion of fly agaric for religious use in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=Wasson1980&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wondrous Mushroom: Mycolatry in Mesoamerica |last=Wasson |first=R.

===Siberia===
''Amanita muscaria'' was widely used as an [[entheogen]] by many of the [[indigenous peoples of Siberia]]. Its use was known among almost all of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]]-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the [[Paleosiberian]]-speaking peoples of the [[Russian Far East]]. There are only isolated reports of ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' use among the [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic]] and [[Turkic peoples]] of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' was not practised by these peoples.&lt;ref name="nyberg1"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nyberg, H.|year=1992|title=Religious use of hallucinogenic fungi: A comparison between Siberian and Mesoamerican Cultures|journal=Karstenia |volume=32|issue=71‚Äì80|url=http://www.funga.fi/Karstenia/Karstenia%2032-2%201992-4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In western Siberia, the use of ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' was restricted to shamans, who used it as an alternative method of achieving a [[trance]] state. (Normally, Siberian shamans achieve trance by prolonged drumming and dancing.) In eastern Siberia, ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' was used by both shamans and laypeople alike, and was used recreationally as well as religiously.&lt;ref name="nyberg1" /&gt; In eastern Siberia, the [[shamanism|shaman]] would take the mushrooms, and others would drink his urine.&lt;ref name=Wasson1968/&gt;{{rp|161}} This urine, still containing psychoactive elements, may be more potent than the ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' mushrooms with fewer negative effects such as sweating and twitching, suggesting that the initial user may act as a screening filter for other components in the mushroom.&lt;ref name="Diaz"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diaz, J.|title=How Drugs Influence Behavior: A Neurobehavioral Approach|publisher=Prentice Hall|location=Upper Saddle River, N.J.|year=1996|isbn=0-02-328764-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Koryaks|Koryak]] of eastern Siberia have a story about the fly agaric (''wapaq'') which enabled Big Raven to carry a whale to its home. In the story, the deity ''Vahiyinin'' ("Existence") spat onto earth, and his [[spittle]] became the ''wapaq'', and his saliva becomes the warts. After experiencing the power of the ''wapaq'', Raven was so exhilarated that he told it to grow forever on earth so his children, the people, could learn from it.&lt;ref name = "Ramsbottom45"&gt;Ramsbottom, p 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the [[Koryaks]], one report said that the poor would consume the urine of the wealthy, who could afford to buy the mushrooms.&lt;ref name=Wasson1968/&gt;{{rp|234‚Äì35}}

===Other reports of use===
The Finnish historian [[T. I. Itkonen]] mentions that ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' was once used among the [[Sami people]]: sorcerers in [[Inari, Finland|Inari]] would consume fly agarics with seven spots.&lt;ref name=Wasson1968/&gt;{{rp|279}} In 1979, Said Gholam Mochtar and [[Hartmut Geerken]] published an article in which they claim to have discovered a tradition of medicinal and recreational use of this mushroom among a [[Parachi]]-speaking group in [[Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;"Several Shutulis asserted that Amanita-extract was administered orally as a medicine for treatment of psychotic conditions, as well as externally as a therapy for localised frostbite." {{cite journal|url=http://www.erowid.org/plants/amanitas/references/journal/1979_mochtar_afghanistan1.shtml|title=The Hallucinogens Muscarine and Ibotenic Acid in the Middle Hindu Kush: A contribution on traditional medicinal mycology in Afghanistan|author1=Mochtar, S.

===Vikings===
The notion that [[Viking]]s used ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' to produce their [[berserker]] rages was first suggested by the Swedish professor Samuel √ñdmann in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;{{sv icon}} √ñdmann S. (1784) F√∂rs√∂k at utur Naturens Historia f√∂rklara de nordiska gamla K√§mpars Berserka-gang (An attempt to Explain the Berserk-raging of Ancient Nordic Warriors through Natural History). ''Kongliga Vetenskaps Academiens nya Handlingar'' '''5''': 240‚Äì247 (In: Wasson, 1968)&lt;/ref&gt; √ñdmann based his theories on reports about the use of fly agaric among [[Shamanism in Siberia|Siberian shamans]]. The notion has become widespread since the 19th century, but no contemporary sources mention this use or anything similar in their description of berserkers. Muscimol is generally a mild relaxant, but it can create a range of different reactions within a group of people.&lt;ref name=Hoff&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoffer|first=A.|author2=Osmond, H.|authorlink=Abram Hoffer|title=The Hallucinogens|publisher=Academic Press|year=1967|pages=443‚Äì54|isbn=0-12-351850-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that it could make a person angry, or cause them to be "very jolly or sad, jump about, dance, sing or give way to great fright".&lt;ref name=Hoff/&gt;

==Fly trap==
''Amanita muscaria'' is traditionally used for catching flies possibly due to its content of [[ibotenic acid]] and [[muscimol]].
Recently, an analysis of nine different methods for preparing ''A. muscaria'' for catching flies in [[Slovenia]] have shown that the release of [[ibotenic acid]] and [[muscimol]] did not depend on the solvent (milk or water) and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of [[ibotenic acid]] and [[muscimol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lumpert  | year = 2016 | title = Catching flies with Amanita muscaria: traditional recipes from Slovenia and their efficacy in the extraction of ibotenic acid | doi = 10.1016/j.jep.2016.04.009 | journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology | volume = 187 | issue = | pages = 1‚Äì8 | pmid=27063872}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soma===
{{See also|Botanical identity of Soma-Haoma}}

In 1968, [[R. Gordon Wasson]] proposed that ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' was the ''[[Soma (drink)|soma]]'' talked about in the [[Rigveda]] of India,&lt;ref name=Wasson1968/&gt;{{rp|10}} a claim which received widespread publicity and popular support at the time.&lt;ref name=Letcher145&gt;Letcher, p 145.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted that descriptions of ''Soma'' omitted any description of roots, stems or seeds, which suggested a mushroom,&lt;ref name=Wasson1968/&gt;{{rp|18}} and used the adjective ''h√°ri'' "dazzling" or "flaming" which the author interprets as meaning red.&lt;ref name=Wasson1968/&gt;{{rp|36‚Äì37}} One line described men urinating ''Soma''; this recalled the practice of recycling urine in Siberia. Soma is mentioned as coming "from the mountains", which Wasson interpreted as the mushroom having been brought in with the Aryan invaders from the north.&lt;ref name=Wasson1968/&gt;{{rp|22‚Äì24}} Indian scholars Santosh Kumar Dash and Sachinanda Padhy pointed out that both eating of mushrooms and drinking of urine were proscribed, using as a source the ''[[Manusm·πõti]]''.&lt;ref name=Letcher146&gt;Letcher, p 146.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1971, Vedic scholar John Brough from Cambridge University rejected Wasson's theory and noted that the language was too vague to determine a description of Soma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1017/S0041977X0012957X|author=Brough, J.|title=Soma and ''Amanita muscaria''|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies (BSOAS)|volume=34|issue=02|year=1971|pages=331‚Äì62}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1976 survey, ''Hallucinogens and Culture'', anthropologist Peter T. Furst evaluated the evidence for and against the identification of the fly agaric mushroom as the Vedic Soma, concluding cautiously in its favour.&lt;ref name="Furst 1976 96‚Äì108"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hallucinogens and Culture |last=Furst |first=Peter T.|year=1976|publisher=Chandler &amp; Sharp |location= |isbn=0-88316-517-1 |pages=96‚Äì108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philologist, archeologist, and [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] scholar [[John Marco Allegro]] postulated that early Christian [[theology]] was derived from a fertility cult revolving around the [[entheogen]]ic consumption of ''A. muscaria'' in his 1970 book ''[[The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross]]'',&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book | author = Allegro, J. | year = 1970 | title = The Sacred Mushroom and the Cross: A Study of the Nature and Origins of Roman Theology within the Fertility Cults of the Ancient Near East | publisher = Hodder &amp; Stoughton | location = London| isbn = 0-340-12875-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his theory has found little support by scholars outside the field of [[ethnomycology]]. The book was roundly criticized by academics and theologians, including [[Godfrey Rolles Driver|Sir Godfrey Driver]], Emeritus Professor of Semitic Philology at [[Oxford University]], and [[Henry Chadwick (theologian)|Henry Chadwick]], the Dean of [[Christ Church, Oxford]].&lt;ref name="Letcher, p 160"&gt;Letcher, p 160.&lt;/ref&gt; Christian author John C. King wrote a detailed rebuttal of Allegro's theory in the 1970 book ''A Christian View of the Mushroom Myth''; he notes that neither fly agarics nor their host trees are found in the [[Middle East]], even though cedars and pines are found there, and highlights the tenuous nature of the links between biblical and Sumerian names coined by Allegro. He concludes that if the theory were true, the use of the mushroom must have been "the best kept secret in the world" as it was so well concealed for two thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=King, J.

==Culinary use==
The toxins in ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' are water-soluble. When sliced thinly, or finely diced and boiled in plentiful water until thoroughly cooked, it seems to be detoxified.&lt;ref name="RubArora"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s12231-008-9040-9|author=Rubel, W.|author2=Arora, D.|year=2008|title=A Study of Cultural Bias in Field Guide Determinations of Mushroom Edibility Using the Iconic Mushroom, ''Amanita Muscaria,''as an Example|journal=Economic Botany|volume=62|issue=3|pages=223‚Äì43 | url = http://www.davidarora.com/uploads/muscaria_revised.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its consumption as a food has never been widespread,&lt;ref&gt;Viess, Debbie.

Retrieved on 26 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; the consumption of detoxified ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' has been practiced in some parts of Europe (notably by Russian settlers in Siberia) since at least the 19th century, and likely earlier. The German physician and naturalist [[Georg Heinrich von Langsdorff]] wrote the earliest published account on how to detoxify this mushroom in 1823. In the late 19th century, the French physician [[F√©lix Archim√®de Pouchet]] was a populariser and advocate of ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' consumption, comparing it to [[manioc]], an important food source in tropical South America that must be detoxified before consumption.&lt;ref name="RubArora"/&gt;

Use of this mushroom as a food source also seems to have existed in North America. A classic description of this use of ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' by an [[African-American]] mushroom seller in Washington, D.C., in the late 19th century is described by American botanist [[Frederick Vernon Coville]]. In this case, the mushroom, after parboiling, and soaking in vinegar, is made into a mushroom sauce for steak.&lt;ref&gt;Coville, F. V. 1898.

U.S. Government Printing office, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also consumed as a food in parts of Japan. The most well-known current use as an edible mushroom is in [[Nagano Prefecture]], Japan. There, it is primarily salted and pickled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Phipps, A.

A 2008 paper by food historian William Rubel and mycologist [[David Arora]] gives a history of consumption of ''A.&amp;nbsp;muscaria'' as a food and describes detoxification methods. They advocate that ''Amanita muscaria'' be described in field guides as an edible mushroom, though accompanied by a description on how to detoxify it. The authors state that the widespread descriptions in field guides of this mushroom as poisonous is a reflection of [[cultural bias]], as several other popular edible species, notably [[morels]], are toxic unless properly cooked.&lt;ref name="RubArora"/&gt;

This mushroom has been widely consumed in Nagano, Japan,&lt;ref name="honest-food.net"&gt;{{cite web |title=How to Safelty Eat Amanita Muscaria |url=https://honest-food.net/eating-santas-shroom/ |website=Honest-food.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is mainly [[pickling|pickled]] for consumption there.

Documentary released 1998-08-10. Relevant material about 06:30‚Äì07:00 minutes. Transcription: ''I then moved on to the appearance of the fly agaric mushroom in our own culture. This is the famous example from Lewis Carroll's ''Alice in Wonderland'', the caterpillar sitting on the mushroom. Alice bites a little piece of this to get larger / smaller. So there is some evidence that Lewis Carroll himself was aware of some of the properties of eating these mushrooms, and the way in which it altered perception. And so the image of the fly agaric became very common in Victorian literature, especially associated with faeries and little people sitting on mushrooms and toadstools.''&lt;/ref&gt;]]
An account of the journeys of [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg|Philip von Strahlenberg]] to Siberia and his descriptions of the use of the ''mukhomor'' there was published in English in 1736. The drinking of urine of those who had consumed the mushroom was commented on by Anglo-Irish writer [[Oliver Goldsmith]] in his widely read 1762 novel, ''Citizen of the World''.&lt;ref&gt;Letcher, p 122.&lt;/ref&gt; The mushroom had been identified as the fly agaric by this time.&lt;ref&gt;Letcher, p 123.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors recorded the distortions of the size of perceived objects while intoxicated by the fungus, including naturalist [[Mordecai Cubitt Cooke]] in his books ''The Seven Sisters of Sleep'' and ''A Plain and Easy Account of British Fungi''.&lt;ref&gt;Letcher, p 125.&lt;/ref&gt; This observation is thought to have formed the basis of the effects of eating the mushroom in the 1865 popular story ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''.&lt;ref name="Letcher, p 126"/&gt; A hallucinogenic "scarlet toadstool" from Lappland is featured as a plot element in [[Charles Kingsley]]'s 1866 novel ''[[Hereward the Wake (novel)|Hereward the Wake]]'' based on the [[Hereward the Wake|medieval figure]] of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;Letcher, p 127.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s 1973 novel ''[[Gravity's Rainbow]]'' describes the fungus as a "relative of the poisonous [[Destroying angel|Destroying Angel]]" and presents a detailed description of a character preparing a cookie bake mixture from harvested ''Amanita muscaria''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pynchon, T.|title=[[Gravity's Rainbow]]|publisher=Penguin Books|location=New York|year=1995|pages=92‚Äì93 |isbn=978-0-09-953321-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fly agaric shamanism is also explored in the 2003 novel ''[[Thursbitch]]'' by [[Alan Garner]].&lt;ref&gt;Letcher, p 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Anthropic bias|the book|Anthropic Bias (book)}}
The '''anthropic principle''' is a [[philosophy|philosophical consideration]] that observations of the [[universe]] must be compatible with the [[consciousness|conscious]] and [[sapience|sapient]] [[life]] that observes it. Some proponents of the anthropic principle reason that it explains why this universe has the [[age of the universe|age]] and the [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s necessary to accommodate conscious life. As a result, they believe it is unremarkable that this universe has fundamental constants that happen to fall within the [[Fine-tuned Universe|narrow range thought to be compatible with life]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/cosmo/lectures/lec24.html  Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abyss.uoregon.edu/~js/ James Schombert, Department of Physics at University of Oregon]&lt;/ref&gt;
The '''strong anthropic principle''' ('''SAP''') as explained by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]] states that this is all the case because the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have conscious and sapient life [[emergence|emerge]] within it. Some critics of the SAP argue in favor of a '''weak anthropic principle''' ('''WAP''') similar to the one defined by [[Brandon Carter]], which states that the universe's ostensible fine tuning is the result of [[selection bias]] (specifically [[survivor bias]]): i.e., only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of observing and reflecting on the matter. Most often such arguments draw upon some notion of the [[multiverse]] for there to be a [[statistical population]] of universes to select from and from which selection bias (our observance of ''only'' this universe, compatible with ''our'' life) could occur.

==Definition and basis==
The principle was formulated as a response to a [[Fine-tuned Universe|series of observations]] that the laws of nature and parameters of the universe take on values that are consistent with conditions for life as we know it rather than a set of values that would not be consistent with life on [[Earth]].  The anthropic principle states that this is a [[a priori and a posteriori|necessity]], because if life were impossible, no living entity would be there to observe it, and thus would not be known. That is, it must be possible to observe ''some'' universe, and hence, the laws and constants of any such universe must accommodate that possibility.

The term ''[[wikt:anthropic|anthropic]]'' in "anthropic principle" has been argued&lt;ref&gt;Moster√≠n J., (2005), ''Antropic Explanations in Cosmology'', in  Hajek, Vald√©s &amp; Westerstahl (eds.), ''Proceedings of the 12th International Congress of Logic, Methodology and Philosophy of Science''; http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/1658/"&lt;/ref&gt; to be a [[misnomer]].&lt;ref&gt;"anthropic" means "of or pertaining to mankind or humans".&lt;/ref&gt;  While singling out our kind of carbon-based life, none of the finely tuned phenomena require [[human]] life or some kind of [[carbon chauvinism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/ant_encyc.pdf The Anthropic Principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617015335/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Cosmo/ant_encyc.pdf |date=June 17, 2012 }}, Victor J. Stenger&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TZ5FLwnCTMAC&amp;client=firefox-a Anthropic Bias], Nick Bostrom, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Any form of life or any form of heavy atom, stone, star or galaxy would do; nothing specifically human or anthropic is involved.

The anthropic principle has given rise to some confusion and controversy, partly because the phrase has been applied to several distinct ideas. All versions of the principle have been accused of discouraging the search for a deeper physical understanding of the universe. The anthropic principle is often criticized for lacking [[falsifiability]] and therefore critics of the anthropic principle may point out that the anthropic principle is a non-scientific concept, even though the weak anthropic principle, "conditions that are observed in the universe must allow the observer to exist",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/anthropic%20principle anthropic principle]. ''Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; is "easy" to support in mathematics and philosophy, i.e. it is a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]] or [[truism]].&lt;!--, albeit a "vacuously true" statement [removed for the time being] --&gt;  However, building a substantive argument based on a tautological foundation is problematic. Stronger variants of the anthropic principle are not tautologies and thus make claims considered controversial by some and that are contingent upon empirical verification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physics.sfsu.edu/~lwilliam/sota/anth/SAP_FAP.htm The Strong Anthropic Principle and the Final Anthropic Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://firstpraxis.wordpress.com/2011/05/26/on-knowing-sagan-from-pale-blue-dot/ On Knowing, Sagan from Pale Blue Dot]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anthropic 'coincidences'==
{{Main|Fine-tuned Universe}}
In 1961, [[Robert Dicke]] noted that the [[age of the universe]], as seen by living observers, cannot be random.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Robert Dicke |author = Dicke, R. H.  | journal = Nature | title = Dirac's Cosmology and Mach's Principle | volume = 192 | pages = 440‚Äì441| date = 1961 | doi = 10.1038/192440a0|bibcode = 1961Natur.192..440D | issue=4801}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, biological factors constrain the universe to be more or less in a "golden age", neither too young nor too old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink = Paul Davies | author = Davies, P. | title = The Goldilocks Enigma | publisher = Allen Lane| date = 2006 | isbn = 0-7139-9883-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the universe were one tenth as old as its present age, there would not have been sufficient time to build up appreciable levels of
[[metallicity]] (levels of elements besides [[hydrogen]] and [[helium]]) especially [[carbon]], by [[nucleosynthesis]].  Small rocky planets did not yet exist.  If the universe were 10 times older than it actually is, most stars would be too old to remain on the [[main sequence]] and would have turned into [[white dwarf]]s, aside from the dimmest [[red dwarf]]s, and stable planetary systems would have already come to an end. Thus, Dicke explained the coincidence between large dimensionless numbers constructed from the constants of physics and the age of the universe, a coincidence which had inspired [[Dirac large numbers hypothesis|Dirac's varying-G theory]].

Dicke later reasoned that the density of matter in the universe must be almost exactly the [[Friedmann equations#Density parameter|critical density]] needed to prevent the [[Big Crunch]] (the "Dicke coincidences" [[argument]]). The most recent measurements may suggest that the observed density of [[baryon]]ic matter, and some theoretical predictions of the amount of [[dark matter]] account for about 30% of this critical density, with the rest contributed by a [[Cosmological constant problem|cosmological constant]]. [[Steven Weinberg]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Steven Weinberg | author = Weinberg, S. | title = Anthropic bound on the cosmological constant | journal = Physical Review Letters| volume = 59| pages = 2607‚Äì2610| date = 1987 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.59.2607 | pmid = 10035596 | issue = 22 | bibcode=1987PhRvL..59.2607W}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave an anthropic explanation for this fact: he noted that the cosmological constant has a remarkably low value, some 120 [[orders of magnitude]] smaller than the value [[particle physics]] predicts (this has been described as the "worst prediction in physics").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/blog/space/2007/02/physicists-debate-nature-of-space-time.html New Scientist Space Blog: Physicists debate the nature of space-time - New Scientist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, if the cosmological constant were only several orders of magnitude larger than its observed value, the universe would suffer catastrophic [[Cosmic inflation|inflation]], which would preclude the formation of stars, and hence life.

The observed values of the [[dimensionless physical constant]]s (such as the [[fine-structure constant]]) governing the four [[fundamental interaction]]s are balanced as if [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned]] to permit the formation of commonly found matter and subsequently the emergence of life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/constants.html How Many Fundamental Constants Are There? ] [http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/README.html John Baez, mathematical physicist. U. C. Riverside], April 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; A slight increase in the [[strong interaction]] would bind the [[dineutron]] and the [[diproton]], and [[nuclear fusion]] would have converted all hydrogen in the early universe to helium. Water, as well as sufficiently long-lived stable stars, both essential for the emergence of life as we know it, would not exist. More generally, small changes in the relative strengths of the four fundamental interactions can greatly affect the universe's age, structure, and capacity for life.

==Origin==
[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was among the first atheist proponents of arguments along similar lines to the anthropic principle.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''Arthur Schopenhauer: The World as Will and Presentation, Volume 1'', Routledge, 2016, p. 211: "the world [is a] mere ''presentation'', object for a subject..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lennart Svensson, ''Borderline: A Traditionalist Outlook for Modern Man'', Numen Books, 2015, p. 71: "[Schopenhauer] said that "the world is our conception." A world without a perceiver would in that case be an impossibility. But we can‚Äîhe said‚Äîgain knowledge about Essential Reality for looking into ourselves, by introspection. ... This is one of many examples of the anthropic principle. The world is there for the sake of man."&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase "anthropic principle" first appeared in [[Brandon Carter]]'s contribution to a 1973 [[Krak√≥w]] [[symposium]] honouring [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] 500th birthday. Carter, a theoretical astrophysicist, articulated the Anthropic Principle in reaction to the [[Copernican Principle]], which states that humans do not occupy a privileged position in the [[Universe]]. As Carter said: "Although our situation is not necessarily ''central'', it is inevitably privileged to some extent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first=B.| last = Carter | authorlink = Brandon Carter | booktitle =IAU Symposium 63: Confrontation of Cosmological Theories with Observational Data | publisher =Reidel | date = 1974 | location = Dordrecht |title = Large Number Coincidences and the Anthropic Principle in Cosmology | pages = 291‚Äì298}}; republished in General Relativity and Gravitation (Nov. 2011), Vol. 43, Iss. 11, p. 3225-3233, with an introduction by [[George F. R. Ellis|George Ellis]] (available on [[Arxiv]]&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Carter disagreed with using the Copernican principle to justify the [[Perfect Cosmological Principle]], which states that all large regions ''and times'' in the universe must be statistically identical. The latter principle underlay the [[steady-state theory]], which had recently been falsified by the 1965 discovery of the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]]. This discovery was unequivocal evidence that the universe has changed radically over time (for example, via the [[Big Bang]]).

Carter defined two forms of the anthropic principle, a "weak" one which referred only to anthropic selection of privileged [[spacetime]] locations in the universe, and a more controversial "strong" form which addressed the values of the fundamental constants of physics.

[[Roger Penrose]] explained the weak form as follows:

{{quote|The argument can be used to explain why the conditions happen to be just right for the existence of (intelligent) life on the Earth at the present time. For if they were not just right, then we should not have found ourselves to be here now, but somewhere else, at some other appropriate time. This principle was used very effectively by Brandon Carter and [[Robert Dicke]] to resolve an issue that had puzzled physicists for a good many years. The issue concerned various striking numerical relations that are observed to hold between the physical constants (the [[gravitational constant]], the mass of the [[proton]], the [[age of the universe]], etc.). A puzzling aspect of this was that some of the relations hold only at the present epoch in the Earth's history, so we appear, coincidentally, to be living at a very special time (give or take a few million years!). This was later explained, by Carter and Dicke, by the fact that this epoch coincided with the lifetime of what are called [[main-sequence]] stars, such as the Sun. At any other epoch, the argument ran, there would be no intelligent life around to measure the physical constants in question‚Äîso the coincidence had to hold, simply because there would be [[Sapience|intelligent life]] around only at the particular time that the coincidence did hold!|''[[The Emperor's New Mind]]'', Chapter 10}}

One reason this is plausible is that there are many other places and times in which we can imagine finding ourselves. But when applying the strong principle, we only have one universe, with one set of fundamental parameters, so what exactly is the point being made? Carter offers two possibilities: First, we can use our own existence to make "predictions" about the parameters. But second, "as a last resort", we can convert these predictions into ''explanations'' by assuming that there ''is'' more than one universe, in fact a large and possibly infinite collection of universes, something that is now called the [[multiverse]] ("world ensemble" was Carter's term), in which the parameters (and perhaps the laws of physics) vary across universes. The strong principle then becomes an example of a [[selection effect]], exactly analogous to the weak principle. Postulating a multiverse is certainly a radical step, but taking it could provide at least a partial answer to a question which had seemed to be out of the reach of normal science: "why do the [[list of laws of science|fundamental laws of physics]] take the particular form we observe and not another?"

Since Carter's 1973 paper, the term "anthropic principle" has been extended to cover a number of ideas which differ in important ways from those he espoused. Particular confusion was caused in 1986 by the book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]],&lt;ref&gt;{{BarrowTipler1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; published that year which distinguished between "weak" and "strong" anthropic principle in a way very different from Carter's, as discussed in the next section.

Carter was not the first to invoke some form of the anthropic principle. In fact, the [[evolutionary biologist]] [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] anticipated the anthropic principle as long ago as 1904: "Such a vast and complex universe as that which we know exists around us, may have been absolutely required [...] in order to produce a world that should be precisely adapted in every detail for the orderly development of life culminating in man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink = Alfred R.

==Variants==
'''Weak anthropic principle (WAP)''' ([[Brandon Carter|Carter]]): "[W]e must be prepared to take account of the fact that our location in the universe is ''necessarily'' privileged to the extent of being compatible with our existence as observers." Note that for Carter, "location" refers to our location in time as well as space.

'''Strong anthropic principle (SAP)''' (Carter): "[T]he universe (and hence the [[Dimensionless physical constant|fundamental parameters]] on which it depends) must be such as to admit the creation of observers within it at some stage. To paraphrase [[Descartes]], ''cogito ergo mundus talis est''."&lt;br&gt;The Latin tag ("I think, therefore the world is such [as it is]") makes it clear that "must" indicates a [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from the fact of our existence; the statement is thus a [[truism]].

In their 1986 book, ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'', [[John D. Barrow|John Barrow]] and [[Frank Tipler]] depart from Carter and define the WAP and SAP as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Barrow, John D. | title = Anthropic Definitions | journal = Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society | volume = 24| pages = 146‚Äì53 | date = 1997 | bibcode=1983QJRAS..24..146B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barrow &amp; Tipler's definitions are quoted verbatim at ''[http://www.dhushara.com/book/quantcos/anth/anth.htm Genesis of Eden Diversity Encyclopedia.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Weak anthropic principle (WAP)''' (Barrow and Tipler): "The observed values of all physical and [[cosmological]] quantities are not equally probable but they take on values restricted by the requirement that there exist sites where [[carbon-based life]] can [[evolution|evolve]] and by the requirements that the universe be old enough for it to have already done so."&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unlike Carter they restrict the principle to carbon-based life, rather than just "observers". A more important difference is that they apply the WAP to the fundamental physical constants, such as the [[fine structure constant]], the number of [[Spacetime#Privileged character of 3+1 spacetime|spacetime dimensions]], and the [[cosmological constant]]‚Äîtopics that fall under Carter's SAP.

'''Strong anthropic principle (SAP)''' (Barrow and Tipler): "The Universe must have those properties which allow life to develop within it at some stage in its history."&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;This looks very similar to Carter's SAP, but unlike the case with Carter's SAP, the "must" is an imperative, as shown by the following three possible elaborations of the SAP, each proposed by Barrow and Tipler:&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
* "There exists one possible Universe 'designed' with the goal of generating and sustaining 'observers'."
::This can be seen as simply the classic [[design argument]] restated in the garb of contemporary [[cosmology]]. It implies that the purpose of the universe is to give rise to [[Sapience|intelligent life]], with the [[physical law|laws of nature]] and their fundamental physical constants set to ensure that life as we know it will emerge and evolve.
* "Observers are necessary to bring the Universe into being."
::Barrow and Tipler believe that this is a valid conclusion from [[quantum mechanics]], as [[John Archibald Wheeler]] has suggested, especially via his idea that information is the fundamental reality (see [[It from bit]]) and his '''Participatory anthropic principle (PAP)''' which is an [[Von Neumann‚ÄìWigner interpretation|interpretation of quantum mechanics]] associated with the ideas of [[John von Neumann]] and [[Eugene Wigner]].
* "An ensemble of other different universes is necessary for the existence of our Universe."
::By contrast, Carter merely says that an [[multiverse|ensemble of universes]] is necessary for the SAP to count as an explanation.

For Bostrom, Carter's anthropic principle just warns us to make allowance for ''anthropic bias''‚Äîthat is, the bias created by anthropic [[selection effect]]s (which Bostrom calls "observation" selection effects)‚Äîthe necessity for observers to exist in order to get a result. He writes:

{{quote|Many 'anthropic principles' are simply confused. Some, especially those drawing inspiration from Brandon Carter's seminal papers, are sound, but... they are too weak to do any real scientific work. In particular, I argue that existing methodology does not permit any observational consequences to be derived from contemporary cosmological theories, though these theories quite plainly can be and are being tested empirically by astronomers. What is needed to bridge this methodological gap is a more adequate formulation of how observation [[selection effect]]s are to be taken into account.|''Anthropic Bias'', Introduction&lt;ref&gt;Bostrom, N. (2002), op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

'''[[Self-sampling assumption|Strong self-sampling assumption (SSSA)]]''' ([[Nick Bostrom|Bostrom]]): "Each observer-moment should reason as if it were randomly selected from the class of all observer-moments in its [[reference class]]."&lt;br&gt; Analysing an observer's experience into a sequence of "observer-moments" helps avoid certain paradoxes; but the main ambiguity is the selection of the appropriate "reference class": for Carter's WAP this might correspond to all real or potential observer-moments in our universe; for the SAP, to all in the multiverse. Bostrom's mathematical development shows that choosing either too broad or too narrow a reference class leads to counter-intuitive results, but he is not able to prescribe an ideal choice.

According to [[J√ºrgen Schmidhuber]], the anthropic principle essentially just says that the [[conditional probability]] of finding yourself in a universe compatible with your existence is always 1. It does not allow for any additional nontrivial predictions such as "gravity won't change tomorrow". To gain more predictive power, additional assumptions on the [[prior distribution]] of [[multiverse|alternative universes]] are necessary.&lt;ref name="RgenSchmidhuber"&gt;[[J√ºrgen Schmidhuber]], 2000, "[https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0011122 Algorithmic theories of everything.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[J√ºrgen Schmidhuber]], 2002, "[http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/speedprior.html The Speed Prior: A New Simplicity Measure Yielding Near-Optimal Computable Predictions.]" ''Proc. 15th Annual Conference on Computational Learning Theory'' (COLT 2002), Sydney, Australia, Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence. Springer: 216-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Playwright and novelist [[Michael Frayn]] describes a form of the Strong Anthropic Principle in his 2006 book ''The Human Touch'', which explores what he characterises as "the central oddity of the Universe":

{{quote|It's this simple paradox. The Universe is very old and very large. Humankind, by comparison, is only a tiny disturbance in one small corner of it - and a very recent one. Yet the Universe is only very large and very old because we are here to say it is... And yet, of course, we all know perfectly well that it is what it is whether we are here or not.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Frayn]], ''The Human Touch''. Faber &amp; Faber {{ISBN|0-571-23217-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Character of anthropic reasoning ==
Carter chose to focus on a tautological aspect of his ideas, which has resulted in much confusion. In fact, anthropic reasoning interests scientists because of something that is only implicit in the above formal definitions, namely that we should give serious consideration to there being other universes with different values of the "fundamental parameters"‚Äîthat is, the [[dimensionless physical constant]]s and initial conditions for the [[Big Bang]]. Carter and others have argued that life as we know it would not be possible in most such universes. In other words, the universe we are in is [[fine-tuned universe|fine tuned]] to permit life. Collins &amp; Hawking (1973) characterized Carter's then-unpublished big idea as the postulate that "there is not one universe but a whole infinite ensemble of universes with all possible initial conditions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Collins C. B. | author-link = C. B. Collins | author2 = Hawking, S. W. | author2-link = Stephen Hawking | title = Why is the universe isotropic? | journal = Astrophysical Journal | volume = 180 | pages = 317‚Äì334 | date = 1973 | doi = 10.1086/151965 | bibcode=1973ApJ...180..317C}}&lt;/ref&gt; If this is granted, the anthropic principle provides a plausible explanation for the fine tuning of our universe: the "typical" universe is not fine-tuned, but given enough universes, a small fraction thereof will be capable of supporting intelligent life. Ours must be one of these, and so the observed fine tuning should be no cause for wonder.

Although philosophers have discussed related concepts for centuries, in the early 1970s the only genuine physical theory yielding a multiverse of sorts was the [[many-worlds interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]]. This would allow variation in initial conditions, but not in the truly fundamental constants. Since that time a number of mechanisms for producing a multiverse have been suggested: see the review by [[Max Tegmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Tegmark, M. | authorlink = Max Tegmark | title = Is 'the theory of everything' merely the ultimate ensemble theory?| journal = Annals of Physics | volume = 270 | pages = 1‚Äì51| date = 1998 | doi = 10.1006/aphy.1998.5855|arxiv = gr-qc/9704009 |bibcode = 1998AnPhy.270....1T }}&lt;/ref&gt; An important development in the 1980s was the combination of [[inflation theory]] with the hypothesis that some parameters are determined by [[symmetry breaking]] in the early universe, which allows parameters previously thought of as "fundamental constants" to vary over very large distances, thus eroding the distinction between Carter's weak and strong principles. At the beginning of the 21st century, the [[string landscape]] emerged as a mechanism for varying essentially all the constants, including the number of spatial dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;Strictly speaking, the number of non-compact dimensions, see [[String theory]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The anthropic idea that fundamental parameters are selected from a multitude of different possibilities (each actual in some universe or other) contrasts with the traditional hope of physicists for a [[theory of everything]] having no free parameters. As [[Einstein]] said: "What really interests me is whether God had any choice in the creation of the world." In 2002, proponents of the leading candidate for a "theory of everything", [[string theory]], proclaimed "the end of the anthropic principle"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kane, Gordon L. | author2 = Perry, Malcolm J. | author3 = Zytkow, Anna N. | last-author-amp = yes | title=The Beginning of the End of the Anthropic Principle | journal = New Astronomy | volume = 7 | date = 2002 | pages = 45‚Äì53  | doi=10.1016/S1384-1076(01)00088-4 | arxiv=astro-ph/0001197|bibcode = 2002NewA....7...45K }}&lt;/ref&gt; since there would be no free parameters to select. String theory now seems to offer no hope of predicting fundamental parameters, and now some who advocate it invoke the anthropic principle as well (see [[#String theory|below]]).

The modern form of a [[design argument]] is put forth by [[intelligent design]]. Proponents of intelligent design often cite the [[Fine-tuned Universe|fine-tuning]] observations that (in part) preceded the formulation of the anthropic principle by Carter as a proof of an intelligent designer. Opponents of intelligent design are not limited to those who hypothesize that other universes exist; they may also argue, anti-anthropically, that the universe is less fine-tuned than often claimed, or that accepting fine tuning as a brute fact is less astonishing than the idea of an intelligent creator. Furthermore, even accepting fine tuning, [[Elliott Sober|Sober]] (2005)&lt;ref&gt;Sober, Elliott, 2005, "[http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/black-da.pdf The Design Argument]" in Mann, W. E., ed., ''The Blackwell Guide to the Philosophy of Religion''. Blackwell Publishers. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903095009/http://philosophy.wisc.edu/sober/black-da.pdf |date=September 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ikeda and [[William H. Jefferys|Jefferys]],&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda, M. and Jefferys, W., "The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism," in ''The Improbability of God,'' Michael Martin and Ricki Monnier, Editors, pp. 150-166. Amherst, N.Y.: Prometheus Press. {{ISBN|1-59102-381-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ikeda, M. and Jefferys, W. (2006). Unpublished FAQ "[http://quasar.as.utexas.edu/anthropic.html The Anthropic Principle Does Not Support Supernaturalism.]"&lt;/ref&gt; argue that the Anthropic Principle as conventionally stated actually undermines intelligent design; see [[fine-tuned universe]].

[[Paul Davies]]'s book ''[[The Goldilocks Enigma]]'' (2006) reviews the current state of the fine tuning debate in detail, and concludes by enumerating the following responses to that debate:
#The absurd universe: Our universe just happens to be the way it is.
#The unique universe: There is a deep underlying unity in physics which necessitates the Universe being the way it is. Some [[Theory of Everything]] will explain why the various features of the Universe must have exactly the values that we see.
#The multiverse: Multiple universes exist, having all possible combinations of characteristics, and we inevitably find ourselves within a universe that allows us to exist.
#Intelligent design: A creator designed the Universe with the purpose of supporting complexity and the emergence of intelligence.
#The life principle: There is an underlying principle that constrains the Universe to evolve towards life and mind.
#The self-explaining universe: A closed explanatory or causal loop: "perhaps only universes with a capacity for consciousness can exist". This is [[John Archibald Wheeler|Wheeler's]] Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP).
#The fake universe: We live inside a [[virtual reality simulation]].

Omitted here is [[Lee Smolin]]'s model of [[Fecund universes theory|cosmological natural selection]], also known as "fecund universes", which proposes that universes have "offspring" which are more plentiful if they resemble our universe. Also see Gardner (2005).&lt;ref&gt;Gardner, James N., 2005, "[http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-physical-constants-as-biosignature-an-anthropic-retrodiction-of-the-selfish-biocosm-hypothesis The Physical Constants as Biosignature: An anthropic retrodiction of the Selfish Biocosm Hypothesis,]" ''[[International Journal of Astrobiology]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly each of these hypotheses resolve some aspects of the puzzle, while leaving others unanswered. Followers of Carter would admit only option 3 as an anthropic explanation, whereas 3 through 6 are covered by different versions of Barrow and Tipler's SAP (which would also include 7 if it is considered a variant of 4, as in Tipler 1994).

The anthropic principle, at least as Carter conceived it, can be applied on scales much smaller than the whole universe. For example, Carter (1983)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Carter, B. | title = The anthropic principle and its implications for biological evolution | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society | volume = A310 | pages = 347‚Äì363 | date = 1983 | doi = 10.1098/rsta.1983.0096 | last2 = McCrea | first2 = W. H. | issue = 1512 |bibcode = 1983RSPTA.310..347C }}&lt;/ref&gt; inverted the usual line of reasoning and pointed out that when interpreting the evolutionary record, one must take into account [[cosmological]] and [[astrophysical]] considerations. With this in mind, Carter concluded that given the best estimates of the [[age of the universe]], the evolutionary chain culminating in ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' probably admits only one or two low probability links.

==Observational evidence==
No possible observational evidence bears on Carter's WAP, as it is merely advice to the scientist and asserts nothing debatable. The obvious test of Barrow's SAP, which says that the universe is "required" to support life, is to find evidence of life in universes other than ours. Any other universe is, by most definitions, unobservable (otherwise it would be included in ''our'' portion of ''this'' universe). Thus, in principle Barrow's SAP cannot be falsified by observing a universe in which an observer cannot exist.

Philosopher [[John Andrew Leslie|John Leslie]]&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, J. (1986) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; states that the Carter SAP (with [[multiverse]]) predicts the following:
* Physical theory will evolve so as to strengthen the hypothesis that early [[phase transition]]s occur probabilistically rather than deterministically, in which case there will be no deep physical reason for the values of fundamental constants;
* Various theories for generating [[multiverse|multiple universes]] will prove robust;
* Evidence that the universe is [[fine tuned universe|fine tuned]] will continue to accumulate;
* No life with a [[alternative biochemistry|non-carbon chemistry]] will be discovered;
* Mathematical studies of [[galaxy formation]] will confirm that it is sensitive to the rate of [[expansion of the universe]].

Hogan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hogan, Craig | title = Why is the universe just so? | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume =  72 | date = 2000 | pages = 1149‚Äì1161 | doi = 10.1103/RevModPhys.72.1149 | bibcode=2000RvMP...72.1149H|arxiv = astro-ph/9909295 | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has emphasised that it would be very strange if all fundamental constants were strictly determined, since this would leave us with no ready explanation for apparent fine tuning. In fact we might have to resort to something akin to Barrow and Tipler's SAP: there would be no option for such a universe ''not'' to support life.

Probabilistic predictions of parameter values can be made given:
#a particular multiverse with a "[[measure theory|measure]]", i.e. a well defined "density of universes" (so, for parameter ''X'', one can calculate the [[prior probability]] ''P''(''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;) ''dX'' that ''X'' is in the range ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''X'' &lt; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''dX''), and
#an estimate of the number of observers in each universe, ''N''(''X'') (e.g., this might be taken as proportional to the number of stars in the universe).
The probability of observing value ''X'' is then proportional to ''N''(''X'') ''P''(''X''). A generic feature of an analysis of this nature is that the expected values of the fundamental physical constants should not be "over-tuned", i.e. if there is some perfectly tuned predicted value (e.g. zero), the observed value need be no closer to that predicted value than what is required to make life possible. The small but finite value of the [[cosmological constant]] can be regarded as a successful prediction in this sense.

One thing that would ''not'' count as evidence for the Anthropic Principle is evidence  that the Earth or the [[solar system]] occupied a privileged position in the universe, in violation of the [[Copernican principle]] (for possible counterevidence to this principle, see [[Copernican principle]]), unless there was some reason to think that that position was a [[necessary condition]] for our existence as observers.

==Applications of the principle==
{{Synthesis|date=December 2010}}

===The nucleosynthesis of carbon-12===
[[Fred Hoyle]] may have invoked anthropic reasoning to predict an astrophysical phenomenon. He is said to have reasoned from the prevalence on Earth of life forms whose chemistry was based on [[carbon-12]] [[atom]]s, that there must be an undiscovered [[resonance]] in the carbon-12 nucleus facilitating its synthesis in stellar interiors via the [[triple-alpha process]]. He then calculated the energy of this undiscovered resonance to be 7.6 million [[electronvolt]]s.&lt;ref&gt;University of Birmingham [http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm Life, Bent Chains and the Anthropic Principle] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090927094126/http://www.np.ph.bham.ac.uk/research/anthropic.htm |date=September 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Rev. Mod. Phys.'' 29 (1957) 547&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Alfred Fowler|Willie Fowler]]'s research group soon found this resonance, and its measured energy was close to Hoyle's prediction.

However, a recently released paper argues that Hoyle did not use anthropic reasoning to make this prediction.&lt;ref&gt;Kragh, Helge (2010) When is a prediction anthropic? Fred Hoyle and the 7.65 MeV carbon resonance. http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/5332/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cosmic inflation ===

[[Don Page (physicist)|Don Page]] criticized the entire theory of [[cosmic inflation]] as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = D.N. | last = Page | date= 1983 | title = Inflation does not explain time asymmetry | journal = Nature | volume = 304 | page = 39 | doi = 10.1038/304039a0|bibcode = 1983Natur.304...39P | issue=5921}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasized that initial conditions which made possible a thermodynamic [[arrow of time]] in a universe with a [[Big Bang]] origin, must include the assumption that at the initial singularity, the [[entropy]] of the universe was low and therefore extremely improbable. [[Paul Davies]] rebutted this criticism by invoking an inflationary version of the anthropic principle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = P.C.W. | last = Davies |authorlink = Paul Davies | date = 1984 | title = Inflation to the universe and time asymmetry | journal = Nature | volume = 312 | page =  524 | doi = 10.1038/312524a0|bibcode = 1984Natur.312..524D | issue=5994}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Davies accepted the premise that the initial state of the visible universe (which filled a microscopic amount of space before inflating) had to possess a very low entropy value‚Äîdue to random quantum fluctuations‚Äîto account for the observed thermodynamic arrow of time, he deemed this fact an advantage for the theory. That the tiny patch of space from which our observable universe grew had to be extremely orderly, to allow the post-inflation universe to have an arrow of time, makes it unnecessary to adopt any "ad hoc" hypotheses about the initial entropy state, hypotheses other Big Bang theories require.

=== String theory ===
{{Main|String theory landscape}}
[[String theory]] predicts a large number of possible universes, called the "backgrounds" or "vacua". The set of these vacua is often called the "[[multiverse]]" or "[[String theory landscape|anthropic landscape]]" or "string landscape". [[Leonard Susskind]] has argued that the existence of a large number of vacua puts anthropic reasoning on firm ground: only universes whose properties are such as to allow observers to exist are observed, while a possibly much larger set of universes lacking such properties go unnoticed.

Others‚Äîmost notably [[David Gross]] but also [[Lubos Motl]], [[Peter Woit]], and [[Lee Smolin]]‚Äîargue that this is not predictive. [[Max Tegmark]],&lt;ref&gt;Tegmark (1998) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mario Livio]], and [[Martin Rees]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Livio, M. | author2 = Rees, M.

[[J√ºrgen Schmidhuber]] (2000‚Äì2002) points out that [[Ray Solomonoff]]'s [[Solomonoff's theory of inductive inference|theory of universal inductive inference]] and its extensions already provide a framework for maximizing our confidence in any theory, given a limited sequence of physical observations, and some [[prior distribution]] on the set of possible explanations of the universe.

===Dimensions of spacetime===
[[File:Spacetime dimensionality.svg|thumb|300px|Properties of ''n''+''m''-dimensional spacetimes]]
There are two kinds of dimensions, [[spatial dimension|spatial]] (bidirectional) and [[temporal dimension|temporal]] (unidirectional).&lt;ref name="Skow2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skow|first1=Bradford|title=What makes time different from space?|journal=No√ªs |date=2007 |volume=41 |pages=227‚Äì252 |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160824025031/http://web.mit.edu/bskow/www/research/temporality.pdf |accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Let the number of spatial dimensions be ''N'' and the number of temporal dimensions be ''T''. That ''N'' = 3 and ''T'' = 1, setting aside the compactified dimensions invoked by [[string theory]] and undetectable to date, can be explained by appealing to the physical consequences of letting ''N'' differ from 3 and ''T'' differ from 1. The argument is often of an anthropic character and possibly the first of its kind, albeit before the complete concept came into vogue.  

The implicit notion that the dimensionality of the universe is special is first attributed to [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], who in the [[Discourse on Metaphysics]] suggested that the world is [[wikiquote:Gottfried Leibniz|"the one which is at the same time the simplest in hypothesis and the richest in phenomena."]]&lt;ref name="Leibniz1686"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leibniz|first1=Gottfried|title=Die philosophischen schriften von Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Volume 4|date=1880|publisher=Weidmann|page=427&amp;ndash;463|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Discourse_on_Metaphysics|accessdate=13 April 2018|chapter=Discourse on Metaphysics}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]] argued that 3-dimensional space was a consequence of the inverse square [[law of universal gravitation]]. While Kant's argument is historically important, [[John D. Barrow]] says that it "[...] gets the punch-line back to front: it is the three-dimensionality of space that explains why we see inverse-square force laws in Nature, not vice-versa" (Barrow 2002: 204).&lt;ref group=note&gt;This is because the law of gravitation (or any other [[inverse-square law]]) follows from the concept of [[flux]] and the proportional relationship of flux density and the strength of field. If ''N'' = 3, then 3-dimensional solid objects have surface areas proportional to the square of their size in any selected spatial dimension. In particular, a sphere of [[radius]] ''r'' has area of 4œÄ''r''&amp;nbsp;¬≤. More generally, in a space of ''N'' dimensions, the strength of the gravitational attraction between two bodies separated by a distance of ''r'' would be inversely proportional to ''r''&lt;sup&gt;''N''‚àí1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1920, [[Paul Ehrenfest]] showed that if there is only one time dimension and greater than three spatial dimensions, the [[orbit]] of a [[planet]] about its Sun cannot remain stable. The same is true of a star's orbit around the center of its [[galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Ehrenfest| first = Paul| authorlink = Paul Ehrenfest| title = How do the fundamental laws of physics make manifest that Space has 3 dimensions?|journal = Annalen der Physik| volume = 61| pages = 440| date = 1920| doi = 10.1002/andp.19203660503|issue = 5 |bibcode = 1920AnP...366..440E}}. Also see Ehrenfest, P. (1917) "In what way does it become manifest in the fundamental laws of physics that space has three dimensions?" ''Proceedings of the Amsterdam Academy''20: 200.&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrenfest also showed that if there are an even number of spatial dimensions, then the different parts of a [[wave]] impulse will travel at different speeds. If there are &lt;math&gt;5 + 2k&lt;/math&gt; spatial dimensions, where ''k'' is a whole number, then wave impulses become distorted. In 1922, [[Hermann Weyl]] showed that [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]]'s theory of [[electromagnetism]] works only with three dimensions of space and one of time.&lt;ref&gt;Weyl, H. (1922) ''Space, time, and matter''. Dover reprint: 284.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Tangherlini showed in 1963 that when there are more than three spatial dimensions, electron [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] around nuclei cannot be stable; electrons would either fall into the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] or disperse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Tangherlini| first = F. R.| title = Atoms in Higher Dimensions| journal = Nuovo Cimento| volume = 14 | issue = 27| pages = 636| date= 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Tegmark]] expands on the preceding argument in the following anthropic manner.&lt;ref name="tegmark-dim"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Tegmark| first = Max| authorlink = Max Tegmark| title = On the dimensionality of spacetime| journal = Classical and Quantum Gravity| volume = 14 | issue = 4| pages = L69‚ÄìL75| date= April 1997| url = http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/dimensions.pdf| doi = 10.1088/0264-9381/14/4/002| accessdate = 2006-12-16 |arxiv = gr-qc/9702052 |bibcode = 1997CQGra..14L..69T}}&lt;/ref&gt; If ''T'' differs from 1, the behavior of physical systems could not be predicted reliably from knowledge of the relevant [[partial differential equation]]s. In such a universe, intelligent life capable of manipulating technology could not emerge. Moreover, if ''T'' &gt; 1, Tegmark maintains that [[proton]]s and [[electron]]s would be unstable and could decay into particles having greater mass than themselves. (This is not a problem if the particles have a sufficiently low temperature.) If ''N'' &lt; 3, gravitation of any kind becomes problematic, and the universe is probably too simple to contain observers. For example, when ''N'' &lt; 3, nerves cannot cross without intersecting.

In general, it is not clear how physical law could function if ''T'' differed from 1. If ''T'' &gt; 1, subatomic particles which decay after a fixed period would not behave predictably, because time-like [[geodesic]]s would not be necessarily maximal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1119/1.1976386 | last1 = Dorling | first1 = J. | year = 1970 | title = The Dimensionality of Time | url = http://link.aip.org/link/?AJP/38/539/1 | journal = American Journal of Physics | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 539‚Äì40 |bibcode = 1970AmJPh..38..539D }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''N'' = 1 and ''T'' = 3 has the peculiar property that the [[speed of light]] in a vacuum is a ''lower bound'' on the velocity of matter; all matter consists of [[tachyon]]s.&lt;ref name="tegmark-dim" /&gt; 

Hence anthropic and other arguments rule out all cases except ''N'' = 3 and ''T'' = 1, which happens to describe the world around us.

== Metaphysical interpretations ==
Some of the metaphysical disputes and speculations include, for example, attempts to back [[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin|Teilhard de Chardin]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s earlier interpretation of the universe as being Christ centered (compare [[Omega Point]]), expressing a ''creatio evolutiva'' instead the elder notion of ''creatio continua''.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Johann.&amp;nbsp;Dorschner. und.&amp;nbsp;Ralph.&amp;nbsp;Neuh√§user.&amp;nbsp;Evolution. des.

James Birx, Teilhard de Chardin, V&amp;R unipress GmbH, 2005, p. 109 ff&lt;/ref&gt; From a strictly secular, humanist perspective, it allows as well to put human beings back in the center, an anthropogenic shift in cosmology.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  [[Karl W. Giberson]]&lt;ref&gt;Giberson, Karl. "Anthropic principle: A postmodern creation myth?". ''Journal of Interdisciplinary Studies''. 9.1/2 (1997): 63-90.&lt;/ref&gt; has been sort of laconic in stating that{{Quote|text=What emerges is the&amp;nbsp;suggestion&amp;nbsp;that cosmology may at last be in possession of some raw material for a&amp;nbsp;[[postmodern]] creation myth.|sign=[[Karl W.

===''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle''===
A thorough extant study of the anthropic principle is the book ''The Anthropic Cosmological Principle'' by [[John D. Barrow]], a [[cosmologist]], and [[Frank J. Tipler]], a [[cosmologist]] and [[mathematical physicist]]. This book sets out in detail the many known anthropic coincidences and constraints, including many found by its authors. While the book is primarily a work of theoretical [[astrophysics]], it also touches on [[quantum physics]], [[chemistry]], and [[earth science]]. An entire chapter argues that ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' is, with high probability, the only [[extraterrestrial intelligence|intelligent species]] in the [[Milky Way]].

The book begins with an extensive review of many topics in the [[history of ideas]] the authors deem relevant to the anthropic principle, because the authors believe that principle has important antecedents in the notions of [[teleology]] and [[intelligent design]]. They discuss the writings of [[Fichte]], [[Hegel]], [[Bergson]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]], and the [[Omega Point]] cosmology of [[Teilhard de Chardin]]. Barrow and Tipler carefully distinguish [[teleology|teleological]] reasoning from [[eutaxiology|''eutaxiological'']] reasoning; the former asserts that order must have a consequent purpose; the latter asserts more modestly that order must have a planned cause. They attribute this important but nearly always overlooked distinction to an obscure 1883 book by L. E. Hicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Hicks| first= L. E.| date=1883| title=A Critique of Design Arguments| location=New York| publisher=Scribner's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeing little sense in a principle requiring intelligent life to emerge while remaining indifferent to the possibility of its eventual extinction, Barrow and Tipler propose the [[final anthropic principle]] (FAP): Intelligent information-processing must come into existence in the universe, and, once it comes into existence, it will never die out.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrow and Tipler submit that the FAP is both a valid physical statement and "closely connected with moral values". FAP places strong constraints on the structure of the [[universe]], constraints developed further in Tipler's ''The Physics of Immortality''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = F. J. | last = Tipler |authorlink = Frank Tipler | title = The Physics of Immortality | publisher = DoubleDay | date = 1994 |isbn =  0-385-46798-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such constraint is that the universe must end in a [[big crunch]], which seems unlikely in view of the tentative conclusions drawn since 1998 about [[dark energy]], based on observations of very distant [[supernova]]s.

In his review&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Gardner|Gardner, M.]], "WAP, SAP, PAP, and FAP," ''The New York Review of Books 23'', No. 8 (May 8, 1986): 22-25.&lt;/ref&gt; of Barrow and Tipler, [[Martin Gardner]] ridiculed the FAP by quoting the last two sentences of their book as defining a Completely Ridiculous Anthropic Principle (CRAP):

{{quote|At the instant the [[Omega Point]] is reached, life will have gained control of ''all'' matter and forces not only in a single universe, but in all universes whose existence is logically possible; life will have spread into ''all'' spatial regions in all universes which could logically exist, and will have stored an infinite amount of information, including ''all'' bits of knowledge which it is logically possible to know. And this is the end.&lt;ref&gt;Barrow and Tipler 1986: 677&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Reception and controversies  ==
Carter  has frequently regretted his own choice of the word "anthropic", because it conveys the misleading impression that the principle involves humans specifically, rather than intelligent observers in general.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Carter (2004) op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; Others&lt;ref&gt;e.g. message from [[Martin Rees]] presented at the Kavli-CERCA conference (see video in External links)&lt;/ref&gt; have criticised the word "principle" as being too grandiose to describe straightforward applications of [[selection effects]].

A common criticism of Carter's SAP is that it is an easy [[deus ex machina]] which discourages searches for physical explanations. To quote Penrose again: "[I]t tends to be invoked by theorists whenever they do not have a good enough theory to explain the observed facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Penrose, R. |authorlink = Roger Penrose | title = The Emperor's New Mind | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0-19-851973-7 | date =1989}} Chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter's SAP and Barrow and Tipler's WAP have been dismissed as [[truism]]s or trivial [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]‚Äîthat is, statements true solely by virtue of their [[logical form]] (the conclusion is identical to the premise) and not because a substantive claim is made and supported by observation of reality. As such, they are criticized as an elaborate way of saying "if things were different, they would be different", which is a valid statement, but does not make a claim of some factual alternative over another.

Critics of the Barrow and Tipler SAP claim that it is neither testable nor falsifiable, and thus is not a [[scientific method|scientific statement]] but rather a philosophical one. The same criticism has been leveled against the hypothesis of a [[multiverse]], although some argue{{who|date=March 2016}} that it does make falsifiable predictions. A modified version of this criticism is that we understand so little about the emergence of life, especially intelligent life, that it is effectively impossible to calculate the number of observers in each universe. Also, the prior distribution of universes as a function of the fundamental constants is easily modified to get any desired result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Starkman, G. D. | author2 = Trotta, R. | title = Why Anthropic Reasoning Cannot Predict Œõ | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 97 |page = 201301 | date = 2006 | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.201301 | pmid = 17155671 | issue = 20 | bibcode=2006PhRvL..97t1301S|arxiv = astro-ph/0607227 }} See also this [http://www.physorg.com/news83924839.html news story.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many criticisms focus on versions of the strong anthropic principle, such as Barrow and Tipler's ''anthropic cosmological principle'', which are [[Teleology|teleological]] notions that tend to describe the existence of life as a ''necessary prerequisite'' for the observable constants of physics. Similarly, [[Stephen Jay Gould]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay| date =1998| title=Clear Thinking in the Sciences |booktitle=Lectures at Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Gould| first=Stephen Jay | date= 2002 | title=Why People Believe Weird Things: Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of Our Time| isbn=0-7167-3090-1  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Shermer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Shermer| first=Michael | date= 2007 | title=Why Darwin Matters| isbn=0-8050-8121-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others claim that the stronger versions of the anthropic principle seem to reverse known causes and effects. Gould compared the claim that the universe is fine-tuned for the benefit of our kind of life to saying that sausages were made long and narrow so that they could fit into modern hotdog buns, or saying that ships had been invented to house [[barnacle]]s. These critics cite the vast physical, fossil, genetic, and other biological evidence consistent with life having been [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuned]] through [[natural selection]] to adapt to the physical and geophysical environment in which life exists. Life appears to have adapted to the universe, and not vice versa.

Some applications of the anthropic principle have been criticized as an [[argument by lack of imagination]], for tacitly assuming that carbon compounds and water are the only possible chemistry of life (sometimes called "[[carbon chauvinism]]", see also [[alternative biochemistry]]).&lt;ref&gt;e.g. {{cite journal | author = [[Bernard Carr|Carr, B. J.]] |author2=[[Martin Rees|Rees, M. J.]] | title = The anthropic principle and the structure of the physical world | journal = Nature | volume = 278 | pages = 605‚Äì612| date = 1979 | doi = 10.1038/278605a0 | bibcode=1979Natur.278..605C | issue=5705}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range of [[dimensionless physical constant|fundamental physical constant]]s consistent with the evolution of carbon-based life may also be wider than those who advocate a [[fine tuned universe]] have argued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Stenger| first=Victor J| authorlink = Victor Stenger | date= 2000| title=Timeless Reality: Symmetry, Simplicity, and Multiple Universes| publisher=Prometheus Books| isbn = 1-57392-859-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Harnik et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Harnik, R. | author2 = Kribs, G. | author3 = Perez, G. | date = 2006 | title =A Universe without Weak interactions | journal = Physical Review | volume = D74 | page = 035006 | doi =10.1103/PhysRevD.74.035006 |arxiv= hep-ph/0604027 | bibcode=2006PhRvD..74c5006H | issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; propose a [[weakless universe]] in which the [[weak nuclear force]] is eliminated. They show that this has no significant effect on the other [[fundamental interaction]]s, provided some adjustments are made in how those interactions work. However, if some of the fine-tuned details of our universe were violated, that would rule out complex structures of any kind‚Äî[[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[galaxies]], etc.

[[Lee Smolin]] has offered a theory designed to improve on the lack of imagination that anthropic principles have been accused of. He puts forth his [[Lee Smolin#Cosmological natural selection|fecund universes]] theory, which assumes universes have "offspring" through the creation of [[black hole]]s whose offspring universes have values of physical constants that depend on those of the mother universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Lee Smolin| author-link=Lee Smolin | editor=Tyson, Neil deGrasse | editor-link=Neil deGrasse Tyson | editor2=Soter, Steve | editor2-link=Steven Soter| date=2001| title=Cosmic Horizons: Astronomy at the Cutting Edge | publisher= The New Press| isbn = 978-1-56584-602-9 | pages =148‚Äì152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosophers of cosmology [[John Earman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Earman John | date = 1987 | title = The SAP also rises: A critical examination of the anthropic principle | journal = American Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 24 | pages = 307‚Äì317 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernan McMullin]],&lt;ref&gt;McMullin, Ernan. (1994). "Fine-tuning the Universe?" In M. Shale &amp; G. Shields (ed.), ''Science, Technology, and Religious Ideas'', Lanham: University Press of America.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jes√∫s Moster√≠n]] contend that "in its weak version, the anthropic principle is a mere tautology, which does not allow us to explain anything or to predict anything that we did not already know. In its strong version, it is a gratuitous speculation".&lt;ref&gt;Moster√≠n, Jes√∫s. (2005). Op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; A further criticism by Moster√≠n concerns the flawed "anthropic" inference from the assumption of an infinity of worlds to the existence of one like ours:

{{quote|The suggestion that an infinity of objects characterized by certain numbers or properties implies the existence among them of objects with any combination of those numbers or characteristics [...] is mistaken. An infinity does not imply at all that any arrangement is present or repeated. [...] The assumption that all possible worlds are realized in an infinite universe is equivalent to the assertion that any infinite set of numbers contains all numbers (or at least all G√∂del numbers of the [defining] sequences), which is obviously false.}}

'''Chandi''' ([[Sanskrit]]: {{IAST|Ca·πá·∏çƒ´}}) or '''Chandika''' ({{IAST|Ca·πá·∏çika}}) is a [[devi|Hindu deity]]. Chandi is the form of [[Parvati]],  and she is the ferocious form of [[Shakti]]. She is said to be the most ferocious incarnation of [[Adi Parashakti]]. Chandika form is said to be extremely ferocious and inaccessible because of her anger. She cannot tolerate evil acts. Chandika does not like evil doers and becomes terribly angry on seeing them. She slays evil doers without mercy. Her anger is expressed in ''[[Devi Mahatmya]]''. A seven-year-old girl is also known as Chandika in Sanskrit scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;Preston, James J. Cult of the Goddess: Social and Religious Change in a Hindu Temple.

==Etymology==
{{IAST|Ca·πá·∏çƒ´}} or {{IAST|Ca·πá·∏çika}} is the name by which the Supremely devine is referred to in Devi Mahatmya. Chandi represents the shakti or power of [[Brahman]]. The word ''Chanda'' hints at extraordinary traits and thus refers to the [[Brahman]], who is extraordinary due to his complete independence with respect to time and space. The word Chandi also refers to the fiery power of anger of the Brahman.&lt;ref name="saptashatI"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=141&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 | title=Chandika name origin | accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bhaskararaya]], a leading authority on matters concerning Devi worship, defines Chandi as 'the angry, terrible or passionate one'.&lt;ref&gt;Coburn, Thomas B.,Encountering the Goddess: A Translation of the Devi-Mahatmya and a Study of Its Interpretation,p.134 &lt;/ref&gt; While scholars debate whether an old Goddess was Sanskritized or a suppressed Goddess was reclaimed, the fact remains that since the very early days, the Devi was worshiped in the subcontinent regardless of whether she appears as a supreme deity in Brahminic texts. Scholars who trace her tracks show that she was very much a part of an early theistic impulse as it was being crystallised in the Indic mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Bhattacharya Saxena|first= Neela|title=Gynocentric Thealogy of Tantric Hinduism: A Meditation Upon the Devi |encyclopedia=[[Oxford Reference]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2011|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199273881.003.0006|subscription=yes}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;C. Mackenzie Brown writes: 

"Hymns to goddesses in the late portions of the great Mahabharata epic and in the Harivamsa (AD 100-300) reveal the increasing importance of female deities in Brahminical devotional life.‚Ä¶ The re-emergence of the divine feminine in the Devi-Mahatmya was thus both the culmination of centuries-long trends and the inspirational starting point for new investigations into the nature of feminine transcendence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Mary McClintock Fulkerson|first=Sheila Briggs |title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theology|encyclopedia=[[Oxford Reference]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2011|doi=10.1093/oxfordhb/9780199273881.001.0001|subscription=yes}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When she does appear in ''[[Markandeya Purana]]'', in the section known as Chandi or The Devi Mahatmya, she proclaims her preeminence:

{{Cquote|I resemble in form Brahman

From me emanates the world

Which has the Spirit of Prakriti and Purusha

I am empty and not empty

I am delight and non-delight

I am knowledge and ignorance

I am Brahman and not Brahman|}}

This text recounts the tale of male demons and their destruction by the Great Goddess and traces its lineage through the [[Devƒ´s≈´kta]] or the Vac Sukta in The ''[[Rigveda]]'' and also connects with the Samkhya Prakriti to establish itself as a canonical text for the Shaktas.&lt;ref&gt;Beane 1977: 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mookerjee, Ajit (1988). Kali: The Feminine Force. New York: Destiny&lt;/ref&gt;

Chandi, the fiercest form of the Goddess, who is the main deity of the famous Devi Mahatmya, a great poem of seven hundred verses (also called Durga Saptasati or Chandi) which celebrates the destruction of demons.  As Chandi or the destroyer of opposition, she can be invoked for removing obstacles to allow us to attain any of the four goals of life.&lt;ref name="Chandi in scriptures"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=102&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 | title=dasha mahavidya | accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation of Chandi or Chandika is used twenty-nine times in the Devi Mahatmya, which is agreed by many scholars to have had originated in [[Bengal]], the primary seat of the [[Shakta]] or Goddess tradition and [[tantra|tantric]] sadhana since ancient times. It is the most common epithet used for the Goddess. In Devi Mahatmya, Chandi, Chandika, Ambika and [[Durga]] have been used synonymously.&lt;ref&gt;Coburn, Thomas B., Devƒ´ MƒÅhƒÅtmya.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis for Chandi worship is found in Devi Bhagavata as well as in the Markandeya Purana, which contains the well known Saptashati. This narrates the three tales of Chandika fighting and destroying the evil forces in the forms of Madhu, Kaithabha, Mahishasura and Shumbha &amp; Nishumbha. These stories are narrated in thirteen chapters in the form of seven hundred stanzas or half stanzas. Each of these is considered as an independent mantra by repeating which one attains profound benefits. In addition, the mantra prescribed for this is what is known as Navakshari, the nine lettered mantra that has its basis in the Atharva Shirsha Upanishad, known as the Devi Upanishad.&lt;ref name="Chandi worship"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=81&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 | title=Sri Vidya Upasana Tatva | accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goddess Chandi is associated with the 9 lettered Navakshari Mantra.It is also called Navarna Mantra or Navavarna Mantra. It is one of the principal mantras in Shakti Worship apart from the Sri Vidhya Mantras. It customary to chant this mantra when chanting the [[Devi Mahatmya]]. She is supposed to live in a place called Mahakal, which is close to [[Kailasa]].&lt;ref name=Madan&gt;{{cite book|title=India through the ages|last=Gopal|first=Madan|year= 1990| page= 81|editor=K.S. Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legends==
She is considered as [[Kaatyayini]] ([[Durga]]) who had killed [[Mahishasura]] as well as [[Kaushiki]] or [[Ambika (goddess)|Ambika]] (forms of [[Parvati]]) who killed Shumbha, Nishumbha and their fellow demons. [http://stotraratna.awardspace.com/sruthi/katha/k7.pdf] "The great Goddess was born from the energies of the male divinities when the devas became impotent in the long-drawn-out battle with the [[asuras]]. All the energies of the Gods became united and became supernova, throwing out flames in all directions. Then that unique light, pervading the Three Worlds with its lustre, combined into one, and became a female form."&lt;ref&gt;Beane, Wendell Charles (1977). Myth, Cult and Symbols in Sakta Hinduism. Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The [[Devi]] projected an overwhelming omnipotence. The three-eyed goddess was adorned with the crescent moon. Her multiple arms held auspicious weapons and emblems, jewels and ornaments, garments and utensils, garlands and rosaries of beads, all offered by the gods. With her golden body blazing with the splendour of a thousand suns, seated on her lion vehicle, Chandi is one of the most spectacular of all personifications of Cosmic energy."&lt;ref&gt;Mookerjee, Ajit, Kali, The Feminine Force, p 49&lt;/ref&gt;

In other scriptures, Chandi is portrayed as "assisting" [[Kali]] in her battle with demon [[Raktabija]]. While Kali drank Raktabija's blood, which created new demons from his own blood on falling on the ground; Chandi would destroy the armies of demons created from his blood and finally killed Raktabija himself.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins p.255-7&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Skanda Purana]], this story is retold and another story of mahakali killing demons Chanda and Munda is added.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins p.260&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chandi Homa (Havan)==

Chandi Homa is one of the most popular Homas in [[Hindu]] religion. It is performed across India during various festivals, especially during the [[Navaratri]]. Chandi Homa is performed by reciting verses from the Durga Sapthasathi and offering oblations into the sacrificial fire. It could also be accompanied by the Navakshari Mantra. Kumari Puja, Suvasini Puja also form a part of the ritual.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, C. Mackenzie (1990). The Triumph of the Goddess: The Canonical Models and Theological Visions of the Devi-Bhagavata Purana. Albany: State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Sandi Dewi (Chandi) Nat.jpg|thumb|A Burmese portrayal of Chandi (Sandi Dewi).]]
The dhyana sloka preceding the Middle episode of Devi Mahatmya the iconographic details are given. The Goddess is described as eighteen armed bearing string of beads, battle axe, mace, arrow, thunderbolt, lotus, bow, water-pot, cudgel, lance, sword, shield, conch, bell, wine-cup, trident, noose and the discus (sudarsana). She has a complexion of coral and is seated on a lotus.&lt;ref&gt;Sankaranarayanan. S., Devi Mahatmyam, P 148.&lt;/ref&gt; In some temples the images of Maha Kali, Maha Lakshmi, and Maha Saraswati are kept separately. The Goddess is also portrayed as four armed in many temples.

As Purnachandi, she is visualised as both the essence as well as transcendence i.e. the [[Brahman]]; who is beyond Laghu Chandika, who is of the combined form of [[Parvati]], [[Lakshmi]] and [[Saraswati]] as represented in Durga Saptashati of Markandeya Purana. As Purnachandi, she sports with her sixteen hands, sword, arrow, spear, shakti, chakra, mace, rosary, kartarI, phalaka, karmuka, nagapasha, axe, damaru, skull, boon jesture and protection jesture.&lt;ref name="Chandi forms"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kamakotimandali.com/blog/index.php?p=1004&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1 | title=Purna Chandi | accessdate=4 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In folklore of Bengal==
Chandi is one of the most popular folk deities in [[Bengal]], and a number of poems and literary compositions in Bengali called ''Chandi Mangala Kavyas'' were written from 13th century to early 19th century. These had the effect of merging the local folk and tribal goddesses with mainstream
Hinduism. The ''Mangal kavyas'' often associate Chandi with goddess [[Kali]] or Kalika&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel(2004) p.21&lt;/ref&gt; and recognise her as a consort of [[Shiva]] and mother of [[Ganesha]] and [[Kartikeya]], which are characteristics of goddesses like [[Parvati]] and [[Durga]].&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel(2004) pp. 149-150&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of Chandi as the supreme Goddess also underwent a change. The worship of the goddess became heterogeneous in nature.

Chandi is associated with good fortune. Her auspivcious forms like ''Mangal Chandi'', ''Sankat Mangal Chandi'', ''Rana Chandi'' bestow joy, riches, children, good hunting and victory in battles while other forms like ''[[Oladevi|Olai Chandi]]'' cure diseases like cholera, plague and cattle diseases.&lt;ref&gt;McDaniel(2002) pp. 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;

These are almost all village and tribal Goddesses with the name of the village or tribe being added onto the name Chandi. The most important of these Goddesses is Mongol Chandi who is worshipped in the entire state and also in Assam. Here the word "Mongol" means auspicious or benign.&lt;ref&gt;Manna, Sibendu, Mother Goddess, {{IAST|Cha·πá·∏çƒ´}}, pp. 100-110&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Congregational Christian Church of Samoa''' ('''CCCS''') is an international [[Christian Church|evangelical Christian Church]] originally established in [[Samoa]] by [[missionary|missionaries]] of the [[London Missionary Society]].

== History ==
[[File:Institution at Malua, Samoa (LMS, 1869, p.14).jpg|thumb|260px|Institution at Malua, Samoa ([[London Missionary Society|LMS]], 1869, p.14)&lt;ref name="Fruits-LMS"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=London Missionary Society|title=Fruits of Toil in the London Missionary Society|date=1869|publisher=John Snow &amp; Co.|location=London|page=14|url=https://archive.org/details/fruitsoftoilinth17115gut|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
CCCS traces its beginnings to the arrival in 1830 of missionaries sent by the [[London Missionary Society]] (LMS), accompanied by missionary teachers from [[Tahiti]] and the [[Cook Islands]] and a [[Samoans|Samoan]] couple from [[Tonga]].

The LMS missionaries arrived at a time of fierce warfare and fighting between local chiefs. Weary of violence and bloodshed, they readily received the missionaries and their gospel of peace.

Paramount chief, Malietoa Vainu'upo, of noble lineage accepted Christianity. All his followers and kinsfolk immediately followed suit. Similarly, Tui-Manu'a, the sovereign ruler of the Manu'a islands also embraced the LMS emissary. The Kingdom of Manu'a became a LMS and Congregational stronghold. Within a few years, virtually the whole of Samoa was converted to Christianity. Huge numbers of people from simple and noble lineage soon offered themselves for overseas mission work. In 1839, nine years after the arrival of the LMS, the first twelve Samoan missionaries left for mission work in [[Melanesia]]. Since then, Samoans continued to take the gospel message to other [[Pacific islands]], e.g. [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Vanuatu]], [[Kiribati]], [[Tuvalu]], [[Niue]], [[Tokelau]], [[New Caledonia]], [[Rotuma]], [[Solomon Islands]], [[Wallis and Futuna]]. Many of these early Samoan missionaries never returned home; they occupy many of the unnamed and unmarked graves on islands throughout the Pacific. By the 1980s Samoan missionaries could be found in Africa, evangelizing on the streets of London, to remote villages in Jamaica.

== Establishment of a theological college ==

[[Malua Theological College]] was established in 1844, its main objective to teach and educate local students so that each village of Samoa would have a theologically educated pastor as spiritual leader. By the end of the 19th century, a pattern of ministry had emerged. It was modeled on the Samoan village structural organization and aimed at preserving, as much as possible, the value systems of the Samoan way of life. The church community functions in the same way as the village, where five main groups ‚Äì matai (titled men), spouses of [[Fa'amatai|matai]], untitled men [[aumaga]], unmarried women [[aualuma]], and children ‚Äì each have their own individual and corporate roles and responsibilities for the maintenance of order and welfare. The village congregation is the basic unit of the CCCS with the pastor as the spiritual leader.

== Church's focus ==

The Samoan church during the missionary period engaged itself in the "social redemption of humanity". This vision was based on the church's understanding of God's sovereignty. It saw the divine purpose of redemption not in individual terms only but also in corporate, social and political terms. The newly acquired faith had its focus on the transformation of life and society. That legacy remains a motivating force in the nation's idealism as well as in the church's commitment to active social efforts. The church has been able to maintain five high schools, one girls' college and one theological college.

== Relationships with other churches ==

Since the second half of the 20th century, the Samoan church has continued to forge ecumenical relationships with other churches locally, regionally and internationally. It has become a transnational church with eight districts (synod or diocese) outside Samoa: one in the United States, one in [[Hawaii]], three in Australia and three in New Zealand. It has one congregation in [[Fiji]] and [[American Samoa]]. In the Independent state of Samoa alone the CCCS membership is over 70,000. In the U.S. Territory of American Samoa, the CCCAS has over 39,000 adherents. Samoan Congregational adherents account for nearly half of the Samoan population living abroad.

When the London Missionary Society combined with other missions to create the Council for World Mission (CWM) in 1977, the CCCS became a part of this global missionary effort as well. A ecclesial schism took place within the Samoan church in 1980, with the American Samoa district withdrawing and forming the Congregational Christian Church of American Samoa (CCCAS).  The CCCAS became a member of CWM in 1994.  The 2012 CWM Conference was held at the CCCAS headquarters in Kananafou. Fellow church members from over thirty-one Churches with LMS affiliations converged upon Kananafou to share in Christian fellowship.  Samoan Congregational churches continue to play an active role in participating in ecumenical efforts that outreach to the world.

==Bible==
Within the first years of their work, the LMS missionaries developed a [[Samoan alphabet]] and put the [[Samoan language|language]] into written form. The setting-up of the first printing press in Samoa (1839), only the second in the Pacific region, was a mark of the missionary zeal to bring the people to understand the gospel through the written word.

The London Missionary Society missionaries, working with prominent and well-versed Samoan orators in the local vernacular, translated the [[Bible|Christian Bible]] into the [[Samoan language]], and this Bible translation, "O le Tusi Pa'ia", is still  used today. It provides an important grounding in the philosophical usage of the Samoan language. By 1855 the translation of the Bible in Samoan was completed. The 1886 edition of the Samoan Bible was printed by the LMS in London. This edition used Roman numerals and the word, "Ieova", or Jehovah, in reference to the Lord throughout the Old Testament text.

'''Continuing Churches''' are often numerically small denominations that formed from disputes within a larger parent organization. The ‚Äòcontinuing‚Äô organizations may be old or the split between the parent Church and the Continuing Church may be recent.

==Terminology==
The term ''Continuing Church'' has been used by a number of  Christian denominations  formed in response to a variety of doctrinal disagreements between members. The use of this term is meant to suggest that no new doctrines were being promoted by the dissenters, but rather that the historic faith allegedly abandoned by the parent body was being preserved‚Äîor continued‚Äîin these newly founded churches.

==Examples of Continuing Churches==
Examples of Continuing Churches include the [[Free Church of England]] (1844), [[Presbyterian Church in America]] (1973), [[Continuing Anglican Movement]] (1977), [[Reformed Presbyterian Church General Assembly]] (1991), the [[Episcopal Missionary Church]] (1992), and the [[Free Church of Scotland (continuing)]] (2000). 

In the USA, the [[ordination of women]] beginning in the 1970s played a major part in the formation of a number of Continuing Churches, as did Fundamentalist and Evangelical convictions. The [[Southern Methodist Church]] (1940) and the [[Evangelical Church of North America|Evangelical Church]] (1968), for example, were both bodies which refused to join with the [[Methodist Church (USA)|Methodist Church]] the [[United Methodist Church]], respectively, on grounds of theology and polity. And there are many remnants of the former Congregationalist denominations which now comprise the [[United Church of Christ]] merger, such as the [[Conservative Congregational Christian Conference]] (1948). The North American [[Baptists_in_the_United_States|Baptist]] landscape is replete with organizations that originate from a refusal to join a larger body.

In Australia, both [[Fellowship of Congregational Churches]] and the [[Presbyterian Church of Australia]] continued after the [[Uniting Church in Australia]] [[Basis of Union (Uniting Church in Australia)|formed]] in 1977.

==Apostolic succession==
Continuing Churches with a Catholic or Anglican tradition have sometimes found it difficult to manage the initial separation in that there are a limited number of Anglicans or Roman Catholics who have passed on valid Apostolic succession. Prior to the 1970s, ‚ÄòContinuing Churches‚Äô often approached English speaking Old Catholics to obtain Apostolic Succession and to place themselves within the historic episcopacy. This means that although such churches may have continued the beliefs and practices of Anglicanism, they have Apostolic Succession through the Old Catholic bishops Arnold Harris Matthew or Rudolphe De Landas Berghes. Most Continuing Anglican churches, however, descend from the "Denver Consecrations" of 1978 in which the consecrators were bishops in good standing in the [[Anglican Communion]].

==Theology==
‚ÄòContinuing Churches‚Äô are frequently less tolerant of doctrinal diversity than the parent Church and claim that they hold on to an 'orthodox' position. The separation of the ‚Äòcontinuing‚Äô Church from the parent body often leads to a position of conflict between the two organisations.

'''David Davies''' (died 1807) was a Welsh Independent minister, and editor of 'Y Geirgrawn'. He is thought to have grown up in the Llanybydder area, [[Carmarthenshire]]. He is known to have been studying at the Academy in Swansea in 1786. By 1787 however, he was ordained and pastor of the church at Pen-y-Graig and of Capel Sul, [[Kidwelly]]. He subsequently (about 1790) moved to Holywell, where he stayed until 1800. It was there he published his radical magazine 'Y Geirgrawn' (nine numbers, Feb ‚Äî Oct 1796). Its controversial views are known to have caused upset amongst the authorities and his congregation, to the extent that surviving letters on the subject speak of ‚Äòunhappy misunderstandings‚Äô which ‚Äòwent on for years‚Äô. On leaving [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] in 1802 he moved to Welshpool, and then, in 1803 to Stoneway, [[Bridgnorth]].

He died in 1807, and was buried in [[Bridgnorth]] chapel.

The '''Durga Vahini''' (''Carrier of [[Durga]]'') is the women's wing of the [[Vishva Hindu Parishad]] (VHP). It was established in 1991 and its founding chairperson is [[Sadhvi Rithambara]]. The Vishva Hindu Parishad states the purpose of the Durga Vahini is to encourage more women to participate in prayer meetings and in cultural activities. Kalpana Vyash, a senior leader of the organization, said that the Durga Vahini members dedicate themselves "to physical, mental and knowledge development".&lt;ref name=TRIBUNE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2002/20020412/nation.htm#7|title=Women 'Ram Bhakt' hog limelight|date=2002-04-11|accessdate=2008-06-29|publisher=''[[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the organization is to establish Hindu solidarity by helping Hindu families during the time of hardship and by providing social services.&lt;ref name="AGWAPRSA"&gt;{{cite book

The Durga Vahini aggressively recruits&lt;ref name="FWR"/&gt; young women from low-income earning and lower caste families. Members learn [[karate]] and ''[[lathi khela|lathi]]'', and receive ideological education. The organization especially recruits young girls for carrying risky tasks of militant activism in which much physical strength is required, for example confronting [[Muslim]] people who they view as enemy&lt;ref name="EGSN"/&gt; and to fight on the front lines in places like [[Ayodhya]].&lt;ref name="FR"&gt;{{cite book

On 16 March 2002, Durga Vahini activists wielding tridents and sporting saffron headbands ransacked the Orissa Assembly along with VHP and Bajrang Dal members.&lt;ref name=TEHELKANSO&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main37.asp?filename=Ne190108next_stop.asp|title=Next Stop Orissa|author=S.

The Durga Vahini alleged to have participated in the [[2002 Gujarat violence]].&lt;ref name=DAWNSFFH&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/weekly/dmag/archive/020901/dmag12.htm |title='Stop funding fascist Hindus!' |author=Anjum Niaz |date=2002-09-01 |accessdate=2008-06-29 |publisher=''[[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713084648/http://www.dawn.com/weekly/dmag/archive/020901/dmag12.htm |archivedate=13 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Durga Vahini has denied such allegations. Regarding the Durga Vahini's role in the riots, VHP spokesman Kaushikbahi Mehta said, "We in the VHP had nothing to do with the violence except to take care of widows and victims of the [[Godhra train burning|Godhra mayhem]]. So was the case with the Durga Vahini". But many people claimed that white-churidar clad girls were involved in the violence. A senior police official said, "They were found providing healing touch to the male activists, information back-up and if the ethnic cleansing theory is true, I have a feeling they played a significant role in intelligence network as well. While it will be very difficult to prove their direct involvement, women Sanghis had definitely scrutinised voters‚Äô list or the traders‚Äô licence papers to screen the minorities with an innocuous intention".&lt;ref name=TRIBUNE/&gt;

Six members of the Durga Vahini were arrested in [[Gwalior]] in March 2004 for blackening the face of Neetu Sapra, director of the play ''Kal Aaj Aur Kal''. The Vishva Hindu Parishad and the Bajrang Dal claimed the play depicted [[Rama]], [[Sita]], [[Laxman]] and [[Hanuman]] in "indecent" way. The activists also damaged the furnitures in Sapra's home.&lt;ref name=HINDU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2004/03/15/stories/2004031509931500.htm|title='Durga Vahini' activists held|date=2004-05-15|accessdate=2008-06-29|publisher=''[[The Hindu]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, Durga Vahini organized a training camp for self-defence in Jammu &amp; Kashmir, girls from 17 border towns of the state participated in the camp.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/j-k-girls-turn-up-in-huge-numbers-at-durga-vahini-training-camp-for-self-defence-exercise-325387.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dvadasha stotra''' is a series of 12 [[Stotras]] composed by Sri [[Madhvacharya]], the 13th-century founder of the Tattvavada or [[Dvaita]] school of philosophy. 'Dvadasha' in [[Sanskrit]] means 12 and all the 12 stotras are in praise of Lord [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Krishna: A Sourcebook|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=2n4VDAAAQBAJ|author=Edwin F. Bryant|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=18 June 2007|page=358}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvaita.org/madhva/dvaadasha.html Dvaadasha Stotra]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the stotras were composed in connection with the installation of the idol of Lord [[Krishna]] at [[Udupi]]. While most of the 12 stotras are praises of the Lord, the third stotra is actually a summary of Madhvacharya's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of Indian Council of Philosophical Research, Volume 19|page=147|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=bkIKAQAAMAAJ|year=2002|publisher=[[Indian Council of Philosophical Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been numerous musical compositions of Dvadasha stotras over the years. It is also a ritual to recite the Dvadasha stotras at the time of "naivedya"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvaita.org/madhva/dvaadasha.html#occasions Occasions for the Dvadasha Stotra's recitation]&lt;/ref&gt; or offering of food to God at [[Madhwas|Madhva]] temples.

==Commentaries and translations==
There are eight known commentaries on the Dvadasha stotras.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvaita.org/madhva/dvaadasha.html#commentaries Commentaries on the Dvadasha Stotra]&lt;/ref&gt; They are by,

The '''Evil God Challenge''' is a [[thought experiment]].  The challenge is to explain why an [[omnibenevolence|all-good]] god should be more likely than an all-evil god.  Those who advance this challenge assert that, unless there is a satisfactory answer to the challenge, there is no reason to accept God is good or can provide moral guidance.

==Origin==
Papers by Stephen Cahn,&lt;ref&gt;1976, Stephen Cahn, ''Cacodaemony'', Analysis 37 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Millican]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.millican.org/papers/1989DevAdv.pdf 1989, Peter Millican, ‚Äò''The Devil's Advocate''‚Äô, first published in Cogito]&lt;/ref&gt; Edward Stein&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20014323 1990, Edward Stein, American Philosophical Quarterly, Vol. 27, No. 2 (Apr., 1990) , pp. 163-167, ''God, the Demon, and the Status of Theodicies'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christopher New]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=New| first=Christopher|date=June 1993| title=Antitheism ‚Äì A Reflection| journal=Ratio| volume=6| issue=1| pages=36‚Äì43| doi=10.1111/j.1467-9329.1993.tb00051.x}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and Charles B Daniels,&lt;ref&gt;1997, Daniels, Charles B. (1997). "God, demon, good, evil", ''The Journal of Value Inquiry'', Vol. 31 (2), June, pp.177‚Äì181.&lt;/ref&gt; explored the notion of an 'anti-God'‚Äîan omnipotent, omniscient God who is all evil. The Evil God challenge was developed at length and in several formats by the philosopher [[Stephen Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stephenlaw.blogspot.co.uk/2010/02/evil-god-challenge.html 2010, ''Evil God Challenge'' in Journal of Religious Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TU54EYkap5Q|title=Stephen Law - Evil God Anti God Evil Creator Hypothesis Reverse Theodicies|first=|last=Galen Orwell|date=27 January 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporting the greater likeliness of an [[omnimalevolent]] creator, in 2015, John Zande published an extended argument for the Evil God thesis,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Owner of All Infernal Names: An Introductory Treatise on the Existence, Nature and Government of Our Omnimalevolent Creator|last = Zande|first = John|publisher = Createspace|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1512263527|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the irresistible, self-complicating nature of this universe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=phil_pubs|title = Manifest complexity: A foundational ethic for astrobiology?|last = Smith|first = Kelly|date = 2014|journal = Space Policy |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=209‚Äì214 |doi = 10.1016/j.spacepol.2014.10.004|pmid = |access-date = 12 Oct 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; not only resolves the [[Problem of evil|Problem of Good]], but establishes unignorable teleological evidence for the wicked disposition of the Creator. Stephen Law noted this work to be an intriguing development in the theology of the Evil God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://twitter.com/stephenlaw60?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor|title = Evil God has a theology being developed|date = 7 July 2015|accessdate = 12 October 2015|website = stephenlaw60|publisher = Twitter|last = Law|first = Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The challenge==
The Evil God Challenge demands explanations for why belief in an all-powerful all-good God is significantly more reasonable than belief in an all powerful all-evil god. Most of the popular arguments for the existence of God give no clue to his moral character and thus appear, in isolation, to work just as well in support of an evil god as a good God.

==Criticisms and responses==
Several criticisms and responses to the Evil God Challenge have been presented. [[William Lane Craig]], Steve Wykstra, Dan Howard-Snyder, and Mike Rea have all suggested that the evident presence of good in the world makes impossible the notion of an all-evil, omnipotent God.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reasonablefaith.org/the-evil-god-objection William Lane Craig sets out this position in several places, including on his ''Reasonable Faith'' blog]&lt;/ref&gt;  William Lane Craig has suggested that an all-evil God would create a world devoid of any good, owing to his nature of evil, whereas an all-good God would create a world realistically with elements of both good and evil. Law contends that even if an evil God is logically untenable, if we would nevertheless rule out an evil god in any case based on observed goods, then shouldn't we similarly rule out a good god on the basis of observed evils.&lt;ref&gt;''‚ÄòEvil God Challenge‚Äô'' in ''Religious Studies'', 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; This could be seen as an example of a [[straw man]].

Max Andrews objects to Law's contention here not by denying the existence of evil, but by denying the existence of evil as Law defines it. In general, Law's challenge is only valid if evil is defined as "equal and opposite" to good: the "Evil God Challenge" is premised not upon "the existence of evil", but upon a peculiar belief about what evil "is", a belief Law borrows from the "religious fundamentalist" described in the quotation above. Andrews instead adopts Augustine's definition of evil not as "equal and opposite" to good, and thus as the presence of some "thing", but rather as an absence of good, and thus as something with no nature of its own: according to this definition, an evil God and a good God are not comparable, making the line of argument involved in the "Challenge" meaningless.&lt;ref name="sententias.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sententias.org/2011/12/21/responding-to-the-evil-god-challenge/#more-1340|title=Responding to the Evil God Challenge -|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comparison between a good God and an evil God according to this definition would be like a comparison between apples and no apples. Andrews further suggests, given this definition of evil, the notion of an all-evil God is incoherent, since such a God would be unable to imagine everything he did was evil.&lt;ref name="sententias.org"/&gt;

In other words, the "Evil God Challenge", far from being purely "atheistic", is premised upon a particular theological or ontological belief about the nature of evil, which is not accepted by many theists.

Rebutting Andrews's characterization of evil as presented in his "A Response to the Problem of an ‚ÄòEvil God‚Äô as Raised by Stephen Law",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://sententias.org/2012/01/20/a-response-to-the-problem-of-an-evil-god-as-raised-by-stephen-law/|title = A Response to the Problem of an ‚ÄòEvil God‚Äô as Raised by Stephen Law|date = 2012-01-20|accessdate = 12 October 2015|website = Sententias|publisher = |last = Andrews|first = Max}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Zande argued&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; that maximum evil (identified as The Owner of All Infernal Names:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Owner of All Infernal Names|url = https://thesuperstitiousnakedape.wordpress.com/2015/06/08/the-owner-of-all-infernal-names/|accessdate = 2015-10-12|first = John|last = Zande|first2 = |last2 = }}&lt;/ref&gt; a metaphysically necessary, maximally powerful being who does not share His creation with any other comparable spirit) is not, as Andrews proposes, "maximally selfish", hateful, vengeful, or even hostile, rather best described as intensely pragmatic and thoroughly observant of His needs; promoting, defending, and even admiring life in its struggle to persist and self-adorn. As presented, maximum evil is not, therefore, an [[Ouroboros]] on a colossal scale, hopelessly given over to self-indulgence and destined to defile
itself and anything it imagined into being, for a world driven only by impetuous brutality would resemble more a raging, super-heated, short-lived bonfire than a secure, creative, and ultimately profitable marketplace desired by a Creator who, above all other
things, seeks to maximize his own pleasure over time.

[[Peter Forrest (philosopher)|Peter Forrest]] has suggested an evil God is less likely than a good God, because the term ‚Äògood‚Äô is intrinsically linked to the notion of ‚ÄòGod‚Äô in a way that ‚Äòevil‚Äô is not.&lt;ref&gt;2012, "Replying to the Anti-God Challenge: A God Without Moral Character Acts Well", ''Religious Studies'' 48 (1):35 - 43.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Edward Feser]] has argued with Law from a similar position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edwardfeser.blogspot.co.uk/2010/10/laws-evil-god-challenge.html|title=Law‚Äôs ‚Äúevil-god challenge‚Äù|website=edwardfeser.blogspot.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to these arguments, an evil God, whatever this might be, would simply not be God.

{{Spirituality sidebar|experience}}
The '''evolutionary psychology of religion''' is the study of [[religious belief]] using [[evolutionary psychology]] principles. It is one approach to the [[psychology of religion]]. As with all other organs and organ functions, the [[brain]]'s functional structure is argued to have a genetic basis, and is therefore subject to the effects of [[natural selection]] and [[evolution]]. Evolutionary psychologists seek to understand cognitive processes, religion in this case, by understanding the survival and reproductive functions they might serve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Steadman, L. |author2=Palmer, C. |date=2008 |title=The Supernatural and Natural Selection: Religion and Evolutionary Success |publisher=Paradigm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanisms of evolution==
{{See also|Evolutionary origin of religions}}

There is general agreement among scientists that a propensity to engage in religious behavior evolved early in human history. However, there is disagreement on the exact mechanisms that drove the evolution of the religious mind. There are two schools of thought. One is that religion itself evolved due to [[natural selection]] and is an [[adaptation]], in which case religion conferred some sort of evolutionary advantage. The other is that religious beliefs and behaviors may have emerged as by-products of other adaptive traits without initially being selected for because of their own benefits.&lt;ref name="Sosis"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Watts2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tamas/&gt;

Religious behavior often involves significant costs including economic costs, [[celibacy]], dangerous rituals, or by spending time that could be used otherwise. This would suggest that natural selection should act against religious behavior unless it or something else causing religious behavior to have significant advantages.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 44 The Evolution of Religion by Joseph A. Bulbulia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion as an adaptation===
{{further|Handicap principle|Signalling theory}}

Richard Sosis and Candace Alcorta have reviewed several of the prominent theories for the [[adaptive value]] of religion.&lt;ref name="Sosis"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2003|title=Signaling, solidarity, and the sacred: the evolution of religious behavior|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology|volume=12|issue=6|doi=10.1002/evan.10120|pages=264‚Äì274 |last1=Sosis |first1=R. |first2=C. |last2=Alcorta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many are "social solidarity theories", which view religion as having evolved to enhance cooperation and cohesion within groups. Group membership in turn provides benefits which can enhance an individual's chances for survival and reproduction. These benefits range from coordination advantages&lt;ref name=Tamas&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The deification of historical figures and the emergence of priesthoods as a solution to a network coordination problem|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|journal = Religion, Brain &amp; Behavior|date = 2015-08-14|issn = 2153-599X|pages = 1‚Äì11|volume = 0|issue = 0|doi = 10.1080/2153599X.2015.1063001|first = Tam√°s|last = D√°vid-Barrett|first2 = James|last2 = Carney}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the facilitation of costly behavior rules.&lt;ref name=Watts2015&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Broad supernatural punishment but not moralizing high gods precede the evolution of political complexity in Austronesia|url = http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1804/20142556|journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|date = 2015-04-07|pmc = 4375858|pmid = 25740888|pages = 20142556|volume = 282|issue = 1804|doi = 10.1098/rspb.2014.2556|first = Joseph|last = Watts|first2 = Simon J.|last2 = Greenhill|first3 = Quentin D.|last3 = Atkinson|first4 = Thomas E.|last4 = Currie|first5 = Joseph|last5 = Bulbulia|first6 = Russell D.|last6 = Gray}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impetus for development of religion for group cohesion is strongly suggested by Edward O. Wilson's theory of "eusociality".  He posited that the individuals of a small percentage of species including homo sapiens, ants, termites, bees and a few other species, replicated their genes by adhering to one of a number of competing groups.  He further postulates that, in homo sapiens, thanks to our enormous forebrains, there evolved a complex interplay between group evolution and individual evolution within a group.&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Social Conquest of Earth|year=2007|first=Edward O.|last=Wilson|publisher=Liveright|isbn=978-0871403636}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=October 2018}}

These social solidarity theories may help to explain the painful or dangerous nature of many religious rituals. [[Handicap principle|Costly-signaling theory]] suggests that such rituals might serve as public and hard-to-fake signals that an individual's commitment to the group is sincere. Since there would be a considerable benefit in trying to cheat the system - taking advantage of group living benefits without taking on any possible costs - the ritual would not be something simple that can be taken lightly.&lt;ref name="Sosis"/&gt; Warfare is a good example of a cost of group living, and Richard Sosis, Howard C. Kress, and James S. Boster carried out a cross-cultural survey which demonstrated that men in societies which engage in war do submit to the costliest rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year=2007 |title=Scars for war: evaluating alternative signaling explanations for cross-cultural variance in ritual costs |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2007.02.007 |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=28 |issue=4| pages=234‚Äì247 |last1=Sosis |first1=R. |last2=Kress |first2=H. C. |first3=J. S. |last3=Boster}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies that show more direct positive associations between religious practice and health and longevity are more controversial. Harold G. Koenig and Harvey J. Cohen summarized and assessed the results of 100 evidence-based studies that systematically examined the relationship between religion and human well-being, finding that 79% showed a positive influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Link between Religion and Health: Psychoneuroimmunology and the Faith Factor|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|year=2001|first1=Harold G. |last1=Koenig |first2=Harvey J. |last2=Cohen|isbn=0-19-514360-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies are popular in the media, as seen in a recent [[NPR]] program including University of Miami Professor Gail Ironson's findings that belief in God and a strong sense of spirituality were good predictors of a lower viral load and improved immune cell levels in HIV patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=104351710|title=Can Positive Thoughts Help Heal Another Person?|last=Hagerty|first=Barbara|year=2009|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dr. Richard P. Sloan of Columbia University was quoted in the New York Times as saying that "...there is no really good compelling evidence that there is a relationship between religious involvement and health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E04E0DE1730F934A35756C0A9649C8B63|title=Religion and Health: New Research Revives an Old Debate|date=May 7, 2002|accessdate=2009-12-19|newspaper=New York Times | first=Mary | last=Duenwald}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is still debate over the validity of these findings, and they do not necessarily prove a direct cause-and-effect relationship between religion and health. Mark Stibich claims there is a clear correlation but the reason for it is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;http://longevity.about.com/od/longevityboosters/a/religion_life.htm&lt;/ref&gt; A criticism of such [[placebo]] effects, as well as the advantage of religion giving a sense of meaning, is that it seems likely that less complex mechanisms than religious behavior could achieve such goals.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

===Religion as a by-product===
{{See also|Agent detection}}
[[Stephen Jay Gould]] cites religion as an example of an [[exaptation]] or [[Spandrel (biology)|spandrel]], but he does not himself select a definite trait which he thinks was actually acted on by natural selection. He does, however, bring up Freud's suggestion that our large brains, which evolved for other reasons, led to consciousness. The beginning of consciousness forced humans to deal with the concept of personal mortality. Religion may have been one solution to this problem.&lt;ref name="exaptation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gould|first=S. J.|year=1991|title=Exaptation: a crucial tool for an evolutionary psychology|journal=Journal of Social Issues|volume=47|pages=43‚Äì65|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.1991.tb01822.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other researchers have proposed specific psychological processes which may have been co-opted for religion. Such mechanisms may include the ability to infer the presence of organisms that might do harm ([[agent detection]]), the ability to come up with causal narratives for natural events ([[etiology]]), and the ability to recognize that other people have minds of their own with their own beliefs, desires and intentions ([[theory of mind]]). These three adaptations (among others) allow human beings to imagine purposeful agents behind many observations that could not readily be explained otherwise, e.g. thunder, lightning, movement of planets, complexity of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmid= 16035401|url= http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|title= Religion's evolutionary landscape: counterintuition, commitment, compassion, communion|year= 2004|publisher= [[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]]|last1= Atran|first1= S|last2= Norenzayan|first2= A|volume= 27|issue= 6|pages= 713‚Äì30; discussion 730‚Äì70|journal= The Behavioral and Brain Sciences|doi= 10.1017/s0140525x04000172|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080807165354/http://www.bbsonline.org/Preprints/Atran-12172002/Referees/|archivedate= 2008-08-07|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pascal Boyer]] suggests, in his book ''[[Religion Explained]]'', that there is no simple explanation for religious [[consciousness]]. He builds on the ideas of cognitive anthropologists [[Dan Sperber]] and [[Scott Atran]], who argued that religious cognition represents a by-product of various evolutionary adaptations, including [[folk psychology]]. He argues that one such factor is that it has, in most cases, been advantageous for humans to remember "minimally counter-intuitive" concepts which are somewhat different from the daily routine and somewhat violate innate expectations about how the world is constructed. A god that is in many aspects like humans but much more powerful is such a concept, while the often much more abstract god discussed at length by theologians is often too counter-intuitive. Experiments support that religious people think about their god in [[anthropomorphic]] terms even if this contradicts the more complex theological doctrines of their religion.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007/&gt;

Pierre Lienard and Pascal Boyer suggest that humans have evolved a "hazard-precaution system" which allows us to detect potential threats in the environment and attempt to respond appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2006|title=Whence collective rituals? A cultural selection model of ritualized behavior|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=108|pages=824‚Äì827|last1=Lienard |first1=P. |first2=P. |last2=Boyer |doi=10.1525/aa.2006.108.4.814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several features of ritual behaviors, often a major feature of religion, are held to trigger this system. These include the occasion for the ritual, often the prevention or elimination of danger or evil, the harm believed to result from nonperformance of the ritual, and the detailed proscriptions for proper performance of the ritual. Lienard and Boyer discuss the possibility that a sensitive hazard-precaution system itself may have provided fitness benefits, and that religion then "associates individual, unmanageable anxieties with coordinated action with others and thereby makes them more tolerable or meaningful".

[[Justin L. Barrett]] in ''Why Would Anyone Believe in God?'' suggests that belief in God is natural because it depends on mental tools possessed by all human beings. He suggests that the way our minds are structured and develop make belief in the existence of a supreme god with properties such as being superknowing, superpowerful and immortal highly attractive. He also compares belief in God to belief in other minds, and devotes a chapter to looking at the evolutionary psychology of atheism. He suggests that one of the fundamental mental modules in the brain is the Hyperactive Agency Detection Device (HADD), another potential system for identifying danger. This HADD may confer a survival benefit even if it is over-sensitive: it is better to avoid an imaginary predator than be killed by a real one. This would tend to encourage belief in ghosts and spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barrett|first=Justin L.|title=Why Would Anyone Believe in God|chapter=3|isbn=0-7591-0667-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though hominids probably began using their emerging cognitive abilities to meet basic needs like nutrition and mates, [[Terror Management Theory]] argues that this happened before they had reached the point where significant self (and thus end-of-self) awareness arose. Death awareness became a highly disruptive byproduct of prior adaptive functions. The resulting anxiety threatened to undermine these very functions and thus needed amelioration. Any social formation or practice that was to be widely accepted by the masses needed to provide a means of managing this terror. The main strategy to do so was to "become an individual of value in a world of meaning‚Ä¶acquiring self-esteem [via] the creation and maintenance of culture", as this would counter the sense of insignificance represented by death and provide 1) symbolic immortality through the legacy of a culture that lives on beyond the physical self ("earthly significance") 2) literal immortality, the promise of an afterlife or continued existence featured in religions ("cosmic significance").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Landau | first1 = M. J. | last2 = Solomon | first2 = S. | last3 = Pyszczynski | first3 = T. | last4 = Greenberg | first4 = J. | year = 2007 | title = On the compatibility of terror management theory and perspectives on human evolution | url = | journal = Evolutionary Psychology | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 476‚Äì519 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memes===
{{See also|Memes}}
[[Richard Dawkins]] suggests in ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'' that cultural [[memes]] function like genes in that they are subject to natural selection. In ''[[The God Delusion#Roots of religion and morality|The God Delusion]]'' Dawkins further argues that because religious truths cannot be questioned, their very nature encourages religions to spread like "mind viruses". In such a conception, it is necessary that the individuals who are unable to question their beliefs are more biologically fit than individuals who are capable of questioning their beliefs. Thus, it could be concluded that sacred scriptures or oral traditions created a behavioral pattern that elevated biological fitness for believing individuals. Individuals who were capable of challenging such beliefs, even if the beliefs were enormously improbable, became rarer and rarer in the population. (See [[denialism]].)

This model holds that religion is the byproduct of the cognitive modules in the human brain that arose in our evolutionary past to deal with problems of survival and reproduction. Initial concepts of supernatural agents may arise in the tendency of humans to "overdetect" the presence of other humans or predators (momentarily mistaking a vine for a snake). For instance, a man might report that he felt something sneaking up on him, but it vanished when he looked around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guthrie|first=Stewart Elliot|title=Faces in the Clouds: A New Theory of Religion |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=0-19-506901-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stories of these experiences are especially likely to be retold, passed on and embellished due to their descriptions of standard ontological categories (person, artifact, animal, plant, natural object) with counterintuitive properties (humans that are invisible, houses that remember what happened in them, etc.). These stories become even more salient when they are accompanied by activation of non-violated expectations for the ontological category (houses that "remember" activates our intuitive psychology of mind; i.e. we automatically attribute thought processes to them).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/anthro/bec/papers/boyer_religious_concepts.htm|title=Functional Origins of Religious concepts|last=Boyer|first=Pascal|accessdate=2009-12-19|authorlink=Pascal Boyer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the attributes of our intuitive psychology of mind is that humans are interested in the affairs of other humans. This may result in the tendency for concepts of supernatural agents to inevitably cross connect with human intuitive moral feelings (evolutionary behavioral guidelines). In addition, the presence of dead bodies creates an uncomfortable cognitive state in which dreams and other mental modules (person identification and behavior prediction) continue to run decoupled from reality producing incompatible intuitions that the dead are somehow still around. When this is coupled with the human predisposition to see misfortune as a social event (as someone's responsibility rather than the outcome of mechanical processes) it may activate the intuitive "willingness to make exchanges" module of the human theory of minds resulting in the tendency of humans to try to interact and bargain with their supernatural agents ([[ritual]]).&lt;ref name="boyer"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boyer|first=Pascal|title=Religion Explained: The Evolutionary Origins of Religious Thought|publisher=Basic Books|year=2001|authorlink=Pascal Boyer|isbn=0-465-00695-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a large enough group, some individuals will seem better skilled at these rituals than others and will become specialists. As the societies grow and encounter others, competition will ensue and a "survival of the fittest" effect may cause the practitioners to modify their concepts to provide a more abstract, more widely acceptable version. Eventually the specialist practitioners form a cohesive group or guild with its attendant political goals (religion).&lt;ref name="boyer"/&gt;

'''Foo Hai Ch'an Monastery''' ({{zh|s=Á¶èÊµ∑Á¶ÖÂØ∫}}), is a [[Buddhist]] monastery in [[Singapore]]. The foundation was originally set up by Venerable [[Hong Zong]] of [[Taiwan]]. The present premises are located, adjacent to [[Sri Sivan Temple]], in front of [[Paya Lebar MRT Station]], exit C at [[Geylang|Geylang East Avenue 2]], [[Singapore]].

==Overview==
Foo Hai Ch'an Monastery was founded in 1935 by [[Taiwan]]-born [[Japan]]-ordained Venerable [[Hong Zong]] who came to popularise Buddhism in [[Singapore]].

Built in [[Zen]]-style, the Monastery has several structures, statues, Bodhi tree and Buddha relics that are of religious importance and of interest to tourists.&lt;ref name=fhc1&gt;[http://heart-lotus.blogspot.sg/2016/04/blog-post.html Foo Hai Chan Monastery]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fhc2&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/interfaithtrail/the-trail-sites/foo-hai-chan-monastery Foo hai Chan Monastery details]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heng Ha Dharmapala Entrance===
The main entrance of the Monastery has two [[Dharmapala]] protectors, called Heng and Ha. Heng and Ha, the Chinese name of the Dharmapala protectors. During the Chinese adoption of Buddhism, under the influence of Taoism and folk religions, where even numbers are considered sacred, two larger-than-life Dharampala protectors, Heng and Ha, made from metal, were installed on the main entrance of the monastery.&lt;ref name=fhc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=fhc2/&gt;

===Bell and Drum Towers===
Inside the boundary wall from the main entrance are two towers, one each on the north and south corners of the platform housing the main monastery building, a Bell gong tower to the north side and drum tower to the south side.  In the morning, the gong is played 108 times, descending from louder to gentler sound, to announce the end of the night and to awaken from deep unconscious. In the evening, the gong is played 108 times, ascending from gentler to louder sound. The sounds are played to remind listeners of illusions.&lt;ref name=fhc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=fhc2/&gt;

===Main Monastery Building===
The multi-storey main monastery building has a large airy 15 m high prayer hall in the front, which houses a 4-storey high reception, office, administration, auditorium, meeting rooms and toilets at the back. The main hall houses 3.3 meters statue of Buddha and 9.9 meter tall statues of [[Guanyin]].

====Foo Hai Ch'an Guanyin====
Inside the main large prayer hall, there is a 9.9 m (32.5 feet) tall 1000-hands [[Guanyin]] (or Guan Yin) statue of Buddha, which is the [[South Asian]] adoption of the Indian-origin [[Bodhisattva]], the feminine representation of compassionate qualities of [[Buddha]].&lt;ref name=fhc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=fhc2/&gt;  There is a large altar in front of the deity, several ornate statues in the roof, and several rows for praying.

===Buddha Relic Foo Hai Ch'an Pagoda===
A five-story high pagoda, built in 2004 by the ''Siddhartha centre'' which donated Sg$6 million to Foo Hai Ch'an in 2004, lies in the central north direction.  Each floor houses decorated  statutes of Buddha in various styles; the top floor houses the sacred [[Relics associated with Buddha|Buddha relics]].&lt;ref name=fhc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=fhc2/&gt;

===Guest House and Teaching Centre===
Inside the main entrance, to the immediate right side, there is a five-storey above-ground teaching centre, library and guest house building with toilets.&lt;ref name=fhc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=fhc2/&gt;

===Singapore Bodhi Tree===
'''Singapore Bodhi Tree''' is a sacred [[Bodhi Tree]],&lt;ref name=fhc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=fhc2/&gt;  between the main monastery building and pagoda. It is a gift given to the monastery by the then visiting president of [[Sri Lanka]]. It comes from the cutting of [[Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi]] tree (planted at [[Anuradhapura]] in 288 BC, by king [[Ashoka]]'s eldest daughter [[Sangamitta]]) after taking a sapling cutting from the original [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] [[Bodhi Tree]] at [[Bodh Gaya]] in [[India]] under which Buddha attained the [[Gautama Buddha#Awakening|enlightenment]].

===Foo Hai Ch'an Columbarium===
'''Foo Hai Ch'an Columbarium''',&lt;ref name=fhc1/&gt;&lt;ref name=fhc2/&gt; housing urns containing ashes of cremated deceased people, lies in the basement under the pagoda and guest house building.

'''Francisco F√©lix de Souza''' (4 October 1754 &amp;ndash; 8 May 1849) was a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] born to [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] colonists and a slave trader who was deeply influential in the regional politics of pre-colonial [[West Africa]] (namely, current-day Nigeria, Benin, Ghana and Togo). He founded Afro-Brazilian communities in areas that are now part of those countries, and went on to become the "''chach√°''" of Ouidah (the slave trading hub for the region), a title that conferred no official powers but commanded local respect in the [[Kingdom of Dahomey]], where, after being jailed by King Adandonzan of Dahomey, he helped [[Ghezo]] ascend the throne in a coup d'etat. He became ''chacha'' to the new king, a curious phrase that has been explained as originating from his saying "ja ja", a Portuguese phrase meaning something will be done right away.

His early years in Africa are well documented in a long article (in Portuguese) by Alberto Costa e Silva entitled "The Early Years of Francisco F√©liz de Souza on the Slave Coast".&lt;ref&gt;(√Åfrica: Revista do Centro de Estudos Africanos. USP, S. Paulo, 22-23: 9-23, 1999/2000/2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Francisco F√©lix de Souza was a major slave trader and merchant who traded in palm oil, gold and slaves. He migrated from Brazil to what is now the African republic of [[Benin]].&lt;ref&gt;David Ross, ‚ÄúThe First Chacha of Whydah: Francisco F√©lix de Souza,‚Äù 1969&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alberto da Costa e Silva - ''Francisco F√©lix de Souza, mercador de escravos'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He has been called, "the greatest slave trader".&lt;ref name="ramer"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.livroraro.com/Bulletin60/Bulletin60/Bulletin60PartXIX.html |title=Bulletin60PartXIX|last=Ramer|first=Richard C.|date=February 2008|newspaper=Richard C. Ramer Old &amp; Rare Books|accessdate=2008-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trading [[slaves]] from what was then the [[Dahomey]] region, he was known for his extravagance and was reputed to have had at least 80 children with women in his [[harem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|2006|p=695}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Sousa continued to market slaves after the trade was abolished in most jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="ramer"/&gt; He was apparently so trusted by the locals in Dahomey that he was awarded the status of a [[chieftain]]."&lt;ref name="Curto235"/&gt; Although a Catholic, he practiced the [[West African Vodun|Vodun]] religion, which is consistent with his Afro-Brazilian background, and had his own family shrine.&lt;ref name="Curto235"/&gt; He was buried in Dahomey.&lt;ref name="Curto235"&gt;Jose C. Curto: ''Africa and The Americas: Interconnections During The Slave Trade'' (2005) p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and legacy==

De Sousa is regarded as the "father" of the city of Ouidah. The city has a statue of De Sousa, a plaza named after De Sousa, and a museum dedicated to the De Sousa family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/an-african-country-reckons-with-its-history-of-selling-slaves/2018/01/29/5234f5aa-ff9a-11e7-86b9-8908743c79dd_story.html|title=An African country reckons with its history of selling slaves|last=Sieff|first=Kevin|date=2018-01-29|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Edna Bay, De Sousa was "deeply influential as an intermediary between European and African cultures".&lt;ref name="Bay68"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bay|2008|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today he is known as a founding [[patriarchy|patriarch]] of the Afro-Brazilian communities in [[Ghana]], [[Togo]], Benin and [[Nigeria]]. The De Souza family has been very instrumental in fighting for the independence of Togo, Ghana, Nigeria and Benin. Figures like 
[[Paul-Emile de Souza]], a president of Benin, and [[Thomas Boni Yayi#Personal life|Chantal de Souza Boni Yayi]], a first lady of Benin, typify the class.

According to the de Souza family, Francisco F√©lix de Souza was the eighth generation descendant of [[Tom√© de Sousa]] (1503-1579), a Portuguese [[nobleman]] who was the first governor-general of the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese colony of Brazil]] from 1549-1553.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/2696754/Forgetting_and_Remembering_the_Atlantic_Slave_Trade_The_Legacy_of_Brazilian_Slave_Merchant_Francisco_F%C3%A9lix_de_Souza Ana Lucia Araujo, "Forgetting and Remembering the Atlantic Slave Trade: The Legacy of Brazilian Slave Merchant Francisco F√©lix de Souza," Crossing Memories: Slavery and African Diaspora, ed. Ana Lucia Araujo, Mariana P. Candido, Paul E. Lovejoy (Trenton, NJ: Africa World Press, 2011), 79-103].&lt;/ref&gt; If true, it would make the contemporary de Souzas members of the [[Portuguese nobility]] in addition to being an African [[chieftaincy]] family.

The protagonist of [[Bruce Chatwin]]'s novel ''[[The Viceroy of Ouidah]]'' is said to be based upon the life of Francisco F√©lix de Sousa.

[[Hinduism]] is a minority religion in [[French Guiana]], introduced and practiced mostly by the descendants of the [[Indo-Guyanese]], who in 2014 numbered around 360,000.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;As of 2010,Hinduism is followed by 1.6% of the population of [[French Guiana]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/french-guiana#/?affiliations_religion_id=0&amp;affiliations_year=2010&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
The [[Abolitionism#Second_abolition_(1848)_and_subsequent_events|abolition of slavery by France in 1848]] created a labor crisis in its three colonies in the Caribbean. A large number of Indian laborers were brought into French Guiana from neighboring [[British Guiana]], and while some of those had been converted to Protestantism most were Hindu, with perhaps 20% Muslim.&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tMG2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA318|page=318|title=The South America Handbook|editor1-first=Patrick|editor1-last=Heenan|editor2-first=Monique|editor2-last=Lamontagne|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781135973216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slavery in the Muslim world''' first developed out of the [[slavery]] practices of [[pre-Islamic Arabia]],&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;Lewis 1994, [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.html Ch.1]&lt;/ref&gt; and was at times radically different, depending on social-political factors such as the [[Arab slave trade]]. Throughout Islamic history, slaves served in various social and economic roles, from powerful [[Emir]]s to harshly treated workers. Early on in Muslim history they were used in plantation labor similar to that in the Americas, but this was abandoned after harsh treatment led to destructive slave revolts,&lt;ref name=RSIBS2001:4/&gt; the most notable being the [[Zanj Rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;Clarence-Smith (2006), pp.2-5&lt;/ref&gt;  Slaves were widely employed in irrigation, mining, pastoralism, but the most common use was as soldiers, guards and domestic workers.&lt;ref name=RSIBS2001:4/&gt; Some rulers relied on military and administrative slaves to such a degree that the slaves were sometimes in the position to seize power. Among black slaves, there were roughly two females to every one male.&lt;ref name=RSIBS2001:4/&gt; Two rough estimates by scholars of the number of slaves held over twelve centuries in the Muslim world are 11.5 million&lt;ref&gt;[Total of black slave trade in the Muslim world from Sahara, Red Sea and Indian Ocean routes through the 19th century comes to an estimated 11,500,000, "a figure not far short of the 11,863,000 estimated to have been loaded onto ships during the four centuries of the Atlantic slave trade." (Paul E. Lovejoy, Transformation in Slavery (CUP, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt; and 14 million,&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Mauvy estimates a total of 14 million black slaves were traded in Islam through the 20th Century, including 300,000 for part of the 20th century. (p.57, source: "Les Siecles obsurs de l'Afrique Noire (Paris: Fayard, 1970)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-2015&gt;{{cite news|last1=HOCHSCHILD|first1=ADAM|title=Human Cargo|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/01/03/04/reviews/010304.04hochsct.html|accessdate=1 September 2015|agency=New York Times|date=March 4, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other estimates indicate a number between 12 to 15 million of slaves until the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Beigbeder2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beigbeder |first=Yves |date=2006 |title=Judging War Crimes and Torture: French Justice and International Criminal Tribunals and Commissions (1940-2005) |location=[[Leiden]] |publisher=[[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]] |page=42 |isbn=978-90-04-15329-5 
|quote=Historian Roger Botte estimates that Arab slave trade of Africans until the 20th century has involved from 12 to 15 million persons, with the active participation of African leaders.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manumission]] of a slave was encouraged as a way of expiating sins.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Gordon 1987, page 40.&lt;/ref&gt; Many early converts to Islam, such as [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi]], were the poor and former slaves.&lt;ref&gt;The Qur'an with Annotated Interpretation in Modern English By Ali √únal Page 1323 [https://books.google.com/books?id=DyuqdDIjaswC&amp;pg=PA1323&amp;dq=Bilal+ibn+Rabah+al-Habashi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JQYUUdmuC-HN0QWIwYDIDQ&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Bilal%20ibn%20Rabah%20al-Habashi&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], Slaves and Slavery&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bilal b. Rabah, [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Islam'' (1977), p.36&lt;/ref&gt; In theory, slavery in Islamic law does not have a racial or color component, although this has not always been the case in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Lewis, ''Race and Color in Islam,'' Harper and Yuow, 1970, quote on page 38. The brackets are displayed by Lewis.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] declared that "no one has the right to enslave" another human being.&lt;ref&gt;http://hrlibrary.umn.edu/instree/cairodeclaration.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many slaves were often imported from outside the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml ''Slavery in Islam'']. 7 September 2009. BBC.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bernard Lewis]] maintains that though slaves often suffered on the way before reaching destination, they received well-treatment and some degree of acceptance as members of the household in the owners' houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=Bernard |authorlink= |title=Race and Slavery in the Middle East |url=https://sourcebooks.fordham.edu/halsall/med/lewis1.asp |year=1994 |publisher=Oxford Univ Press |location= |isbn= |page=|quote=ln later times, for which we have more detailed evidence, it would seem that while the slaves often suffered appalling privations from the moment of their capture until their arrival at their final destination, once they were placed with a family they were reasonably well treated and accepted in some degree as members of the household. In commerce, slaves were often apprenticed to their masters, sometimes as assistants, sometimes advancing to become agents or even business partners.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab slave trade was most active in West Asia, North Africa, and Southeast Africa. In the early 20th century (post [[World War I]]), slavery was gradually outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, largely due to pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France.&lt;ref name="eois"&gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery in the Ottoman Empire]] was abolished in 1924 when the [[Turkish Constitution of 1924|new Turkish Constitution]] disbanded the [[Imperial Harem]] and made the last concubines and eunuchs free citizens of the newly proclaimed republic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; [[Slavery in Iran]] was abolished in 1929. Among the [[Timeline of abolition of slavery and serfdom|last states to abolish slavery]] were [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Slavery in Yemen|Yemen]], which abolished slavery in 1962 under pressure from Britain; [[Oman]] in 1970, and [[Slavery in Mauritania|Mauritania]] in 1905, 1981, and again in August 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Martin A. Klein (2002), Historical Dictionary of Slavery and Abolition, Page xxii, {{ISBN|0810841029}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, slavery claiming the sanction of Islam is documented presently in the predominantly Islamic countries of [[the Sahel]]&lt;ref name=RSIBS2001:206&gt;[[#RSIBS2001|Segal, ''Islam's Black Slaves'', 1568]]: p.206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RSIBS2001:222&gt;[[#RSIBS2001|Segal, ''Islam's Black Slaves'', 2001]]: p.222&lt;/ref&gt;, and is also [[Slavery in 21st-century Islamism|practiced in territories controlled by Islamist rebel groups]], for instance [[Slavery in Libya|in Libya]].

==Slavery in pre-Islamic Arabia==
Slavery was widely practiced in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]], as well as in the rest of the ancient and [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] world. The minority were [[Demographics of Europe|European]] and [[People of the Caucasus|Caucasus]] slaves of foreign extraction, likely brought in by Arab caravaners (or the product of [[Bedouin]] captures) stretching back to biblical times. Native [[Arab]] slaves had also existed, a prime example being [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], later to become Muhammad's adopted son. Arab slaves, however, usually obtained as captives, were generally ransomed off amongst nomad tribes.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; The slave population increased by the custom of [[child abandonment]] (see also [[infanticide]]), and by the kidnapping, or, occasionally, the sale of small children.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Lewis (1992) p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Whether enslavement for debt or the sale of children by their families was common is disputed.  (Abd Brunschvig argues it was rare,&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; according to Jonathan E. Brockopp debt slavery was persistent.&lt;ref name="Brockopp"&gt;[[Encyclopedia of the Bible]], ''Slaves and Slavery''&lt;/ref&gt;) Free persons could sell their offspring, or even themselves, into slavery. Enslavement was also possible as a consequence of committing certain offenses against the law, as in the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Two classes of slave existed: a purchased slave, and a slave born in the master's home. Over the latter the master had complete rights of ownership, though these slaves were unlikely to be sold or disposed of by the master. Female slaves were at times forced into [[prostitution]] for the benefit of their masters, in accordance with Near Eastern customs.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mendelsohn (1949) pp. 54‚Äî58

==Slavery in Islamic Arabia==

===Early Islamic history===
[[W. Montgomery Watt]] points out that Muhammad's expansion of [[Pax Islamica]] to the Arabian peninsula reduced warfare and raiding, and therefore cut off the sources of enslaving freemen.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, ''Muhammad at Medina'', 1956, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Patrick Manning (professor)|Patrick Manning]], the Islamic legislations against the abuse of the slaves convincingly limited the extent of enslavement in Arabian peninsula and to a lesser degree for the whole area of the whole [[Umayyad Caliphate]] where slavery existed since the most ancient times.&lt;ref name=Manning1990-28&gt;Manning (1990) p.28&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bernard Lewis]], the growth of internal slave populations through natural increase was insufficient to maintain numbers right through to modern times, which contrasts markedly with rapidly rising slave populations in the New World. He writes that

# Liberation by freemen of their own offspring born by slave mothers was "the primary drain". 
# Liberation of slaves as an act of piety, was a contributing factor.  Other factors include:
# [[Castration]]: A fair proportion of male slaves were imported as [[eunuch]]s. Levy states that according to the Quran and Islamic traditions, such emasculation was objectionable. Jurists such as al-Baydawi considered castration to be mutilation, stipulating law enforcement to prevent it. However, in practice, emasculation was frequent.&lt;ref name="L77"&gt;Levy (1957) p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; In eighteenth century Mecca, the majority of eunuchs were in the service of the mosques.&lt;ref&gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, page 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, the process of castration (which included [[penectomy]]) carried a high risk of death.
# Liberation of military slaves: Military slaves that rose through the ranks were usually liberated at some stage in their careers.
# Restrictions on procreation: Among the menial, domestic, and manual worker slaves, casual sex was not permitted and marriage was not encouraged.
# High death toll: There was a high death toll among all classes of slaves. Slaves usually came from remote places and, lacking immunities, died in large numbers. Segal notes that recent slaves, weakened by their initial captivity and debilitating journey, would have been easy victim to climate changes and infection.&lt;ref name=RSIBS2001:62&gt;[[#RSIBS2001|Segal, ''Islam's Black Slaves'', 2001]]: p.62&lt;/ref&gt; Children were especially at risk, and the Islamic market demand for children was much greater than the American one. Many black slaves lived in conditions conducive to malnutrition and disease, with effects on their own [[life expectancy]], the fertility of women, and the [[infant mortality]] rate.&lt;ref name=RSIBS2001:62/&gt; As late as the 19th century, Western travellers in North Africa and Egypt noted the high [[Mortality rate|death rate]] among imported black slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Hansen |first = Suzy |year = 2001 |url = http://archive.salon.com/books/int/2001/04/05/segal/index.html |title = Islam's black slaves |work = Salon.com book review |publisher = Salon.com |accessdate = 2007-04-05 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070301113533/http://archive.salon.com/books/int/2001/04/05/segal/index.html |archivedate = 2007-03-01 |df =  }} - See under 'What about eunuchs?'&lt;/ref&gt;
# Another factor was the [[Zanj Rebellion]] against the [[plantation economy]] of ninth-century [[southern Iraq]].  Due to fears of a similar uprising among slave gangs occurring elsewhere, Muslims came to realize that large concentrations of slaves were not a suitable organization of labour and that slaves were best employed in smaller concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slavery from Roman times to the early transatlantic trade|url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennpress/book/15140.html|author=William D.

===Arab slave trade===

{{main|Arab slave trade|Barbary slave trade|Turkish Abductions}}

Bernard Lewis writes: "In one of the sad paradoxes of human history, it was the humanitarian reforms brought by Islam that resulted in a vast development of the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] inside, and still more outside, the Islamic empire." He notes that the Islamic injunctions against the enslavement of Muslims led to massive importation of slaves from the outside.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Patrick Manning, Islam by recognizing and codifying the slavery seems to have done more to protect and expand slavery than the reverse.&lt;ref name=Manning1990-28/&gt;

The 'Arab' slave trade is sometimes called the 'Islamic' slave trade. Bernard Lewis writes that "polytheists and idolaters were seen primarily as sources of slaves, to be imported into the Islamic world and molded in Islamic ways, and, since they possessed no religion of their own worth the mention, as natural recruits for Islam."&lt;ref&gt;Lewis (1990), page 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Manning states that religion was hardly the point of this slavery.&lt;ref name="Manning2"&gt;Manning (1990) p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Also, this term suggests comparison between Islamic slave trade and [[Christianity and slavery|Christian slave trade]]. Propagators of Islam in Africa often revealed a cautious attitude towards proselytizing because of its effect in reducing the potential reservoir of slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Gordon, ''Slavery in the Arab World''. New Amsterdam Press, New York, 1989. Originally published in French by Editions Robert Laffont, S.A. Paris, 1987, page 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arab or Islamic slave trade lasted much longer than Atlantic or European slave trade: "It began in the middle of the seventh century and survives today in Mauritania and Sudan. With the Islamic slave trade, we're talking of 14 centuries rather than four." Further, "whereas the gender ratio of slaves in the Atlantic trade was two males to every female, in the Islamic trade, it was two females to every male," according to [[Ronald Segal]]&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Ronald Segal on the subject of his book ''Islam's Black Slaves: The Other Black Diaspora''. Suzy Hansen, [http://archive.salon.com/books/int/2001/04/05/segal/index.html "Islam‚Äôs black slaves,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301113533/http://archive.salon.com/books/int/2001/04/05/segal/index.html |date=2007-03-01 }} ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', April 5, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 8th century, Africa was dominated by [[Arab]]-[[Berber people|Berbers]] in the north: Islam moved southwards along the [[Nile]] and along the desert trails. One supply of slaves was the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of [[Ethiopia]] which often exported [[Nilotic]] slaves from their western borderland provinces, or from newly conquered or reconquered Muslim provinces. Native Muslim Ethiopian [[sultanates]] (rulership) exported slaves as well, such as the sometimes independent sultanate (rulership) of [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]] .&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst (1997) p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time, until the early 18th century, the [[Crimean Khanate]] maintained a massive slave trade with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the Middle East. Between 1530 and 1780 there were almost certainly 1 million and quite possibly as many as 1.25 million white, European Christians enslaved by the Muslims of the [[Barbary Coast]] of North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm|title=Ohio State Research News with reference to "Christian Slaves, Muslim Masters: White Slavery in the Mediterranean, the Barbary Coast, and Italy, 1500-1800" (Palgrave Macmillan).|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220038/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/whtslav.htm|archivedate=2011-07-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the coast of the [[Indian Ocean]] too, slave-trading posts were set up by Muslim Arabs.&lt;ref name="fcamb"&gt;Holt ''et al.'' (1970) p.391&lt;/ref&gt; The archipelago of [[Zanzibar]], along the coast of present-day [[Tanzania]], is undoubtedly the most notorious example of these trading colonies. Southeast Africa and the Indian Ocean continued as an important region for the Oriental slave trade up until the 19th century.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt; [[David Livingstone|Livingstone]] and [[Henry Morton Stanley|Stanley]] were then the first Europeans to penetrate to the interior of the [[Congo River|Congo basin]] and to discover the scale of slavery there.&lt;ref name="fcamb" /&gt; The Arab [[Tippu Tib]] extended his influence and made many people slaves.&lt;ref name="fcamb" /&gt; After Europeans had settled in the [[Gulf of Guinea]], the trans-Saharan slave trade became less important. In Zanzibar, slavery was abolished late, in 1897, under Sultan [[Hamoud bin Mohammed of Zanzibar|Hamoud bin Mohammed]].&lt;ref&gt;Ingrams (1967) p.175&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of Africa had no direct contact with Muslim slave-traders.

;Roles
While slaves were sometimes employed for [[manual labour]] during the Arab slave trade, this was usually the exception rather than the norm. The vast majority of labour in the medieval Islamic world consisted of free, paid labour. The only known exceptions to this general rule was in the [[plantation economy]] of 9th-century [[southern Iraq]] (which led to the [[Zanj Revolt]]), in 9th-century [[Ifriqiya]] (modern-day [[Tunisia]]), and in 11th-century [[Bahrain]] (during the [[Qarmatians|Karmatian]] state).&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{Cite book|title=Slavery from Roman times to the early transatlantic trade|author=William D.

===Roles of slaves===
A system of plantation labor, much like that which would emerge in the Americas, developed early on, but with such dire consequences that subsequent engagements were relatively rare and reduced. Moreover, the need for agricultural labor, in an Islamic world with large peasant populations, was nowhere near as acute as in the Americas.&lt;ref name=RSIBS2001:4&gt;[[#RSIBS2001|Segal, ''Islam's Black Slaves'', 2001]]: p.4&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves in Islam were mainly directed at the service sector ‚Äî concubines and cooks, porters and soldiers ‚Äî with slavery itself primarily a form of consumption rather than a factor of production.&lt;ref name=RSIBS2001:4/&gt; The most telling evidence for this is found in the gender ratio; among black slaves traded in Islamic empire across the centuries, there were roughly two females to every male.&lt;ref name=RSIBS2001:4/&gt;
Almost all of these female slaves had domestic occupations. For some, this also included [[Islamic views on slavery#Sexual intercourse|sexual relations with their masters]]. This was a lawful motive for their purchase, and the most common one.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Brunschvig. 'Abd; Encyclopedia of Islam, page 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military service was also a common role for slaves. Barbarians from the "martial races" beyond the frontiers were widely recruited into the imperial armies. These recruits often advanced in the imperial and eventually metropolitan forces, sometimes obtaining high ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1990, page 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Women and slavery ==
[[File:A_slave_market_in_Cairo-David_Roberts.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|A slave market in Cairo. Drawing by [[David Roberts (painter)|David Roberts]], circa 1848.]]
In Classical Arabic terminology, female slaves were generally called ''jawƒÅri'' ({{lang-ar|ÿ¨ŸéŸàÿßÿ±}}, s. ''jƒÅriya'' {{lang-ar|ÿ¨ÿßÿ±ŸêŸäÿ©}}). Slave-girls specifically might be called ''imƒÅ‚Äô'' ({{lang-ar|ÿßŸêŸÖÿßÿ°}}, s. ''ama'' {{lang-ar|ÿßŸéŸÖÿ©}}), while female slaves who had been trained as entertainers or courtesans were usually called ''qiyƒÅn'' ({{lang-ar|ŸÇŸêŸäÿßŸÜ}}, IPA /qi'jaÀên/; singular ''qayna'', {{lang-ar|ŸÇŸéŸäŸÜÿ©}}, IPA /'qaina/).&lt;ref&gt;Fuad Matthew Caswell, ''The Slave Girls of Baghdad: The 'QiyƒÅn' in the Early Abbasid Era'' (London: I. B. Tauris, 2011), pp. ix-x, 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

When it comes to the rights of women within Islamic society, oftentimes, they were looked to have more freedoms than women from other countries ‚Äì for example the freedom to divorce ‚Äì and often saw marriage as a chance to change their social status. They included sometimes highly trained entertainers known as ''[[qiyan]]''. In other cases, many atrocities occurred against women who were enslaved.

Women in the [[Ottoman Empire]] were treated very similarly to those in [[Morocco]] and the [[Barbary States]].  Women were put into a subservient category because of their "putative physical and moral weaknesses", which "rendered them subject to men" (Zilfi 16). This was mostly because of "decontextualized scriptural snippets" from the Quran, which "played an important role in authorizing women's social marginalization" (Zilfi 16). [[Islamic law]] is primarily based on the Quran. Because of the way it is written, there is "a general acceptance of women and girls as sexual commodities" and that female slaves could be freed and married by their masters (Sexual Ethics and Islam‚Ä¶ 40). In addition, this interpretation of the [[Quran]] was often thought of as a major factor in shaping Muslim thinking on sex and marriage.

While the legal rights of Ottoman women were relatively the same, the customs of marriage were slightly different. Marriage was a chance to change your status ‚Äì "For slave women, emancipation sealed by marriage could make the difference between impoverished freedom and entitled socioeconomic standing" (Zilfi 162). There were two main possibilities when it came to slave marriages: they could be married off to another slave or to a free person for a price. However, no matter which happened, a slave is still a slave and that meant that "any property that they acquired in marriage rebounded to the slave owner" (Zilfi  162). Slave women could be sold, freed, and then married to their new master as in the case of Sehriban (Zilfi 167), who married a statesman named [[Ahmed Midhat Pasha]]. He paid quite an amount of currency for her. This was apparently the way to be as "harem-reared slave girls were molded into well-bred and indebted replicas of their wealthy and well-placed mistresses" and, thus, well-trained wives (Zilfi 168).

In the end, women in slavery (and many times women in general) were seen solely as a way to give pleasure to a man and create new life. Therefore, they were only offered the job of mother and wife (Blunt 92).

Some texts, written solely from European sources, definitely portray Muslim women and society in a completely negative way. While Mulai had only "four legitimate wives", he (Mulai) kept a vast harem. He was rumoured to only sleep with virgins (Bekkaoui 13). "The life of the women was unspeakably monotonous" (Blunt 92-3). T.P. Hughes wrote "there is absolutely no limit to the number of slave girls with whom a Muhammadan may cohabit, and it is the consecration of this illimitable indulgence which so popularizes the Muhammadan religion amongst uncivilized nations, and so popularizes slavery in the Muslim religion."&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, T.P., ''Dictionary of Islam'' p.600 {{ISBN|1298825962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choosing elite slaves for the grooming process ==
Choosing slaves to undergo the grooming process was highly selective in the Moroccan empire. There are many attributes and skills slaves can possess to win the favour and trust of their master.  When examining master/slave relationships we are able to understand that slaves with white skin were especially valued in Islamic societies.  Additionally, mode of acquisition as well as age when acquired heavily influenced slave value as well as could foster trusting master-slave relationships. Many times slaves acquired as adolescents or even young adults became trusted aides and confidants of their masters.  Furthermore, acquiring a slave during adolescence typically lead to opportunities for education and training, as slaves acquired in their adolescent years were at an ideal age to begin military training.  In Islamic societies it was normal to begin this process at the age of ten, lasting until the age of fifteen, at which point these young men would be considered ready for military service. 
Slaves with specialised skills were highly valued in Islamic slave societies.  Christian slaves were often required to speak and write in Arabic. Having slaves fluent in English and [[Arabic]] was a highly valued tool for diplomatic affairs. [[Bi-lingual]] slaves like [[Thomas Pellow]] used their translating ability for important manners of diplomacy.  Pellow himself worked as a translator for the ambassador in [[Morocco]].

===Rebellion===
In some cases slaves joined to rebels or even uprose against governors. The most renowned of these rebellions was the [[Zanj Rebellion]].

The Zanj Revolt took place near the city of [[Basra]], located in southern [[Iraq]] over a period of fifteen years (869-883 AD). It grew to involve over 500,000 slaves who were imported from across the Muslim empire and claimed over ‚Äútens of thousands of lives in lower Iraq‚Äù.&lt;ref name="Furlonge"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Revisiting the Zanj and Re-Visioning Revolt: Complexities of the Zanj Conflict - 868-883 Ad - slave revolt in Iraq|url=https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-76402507/revisiting-the-zanj-and-re-visioning-revolt-complexities|subscription=yes|author= Furlonge, Nigel D.|journal=Negro History Bulletin|year=1999|volume=62|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolt was said to have been led by [[Ali ibn Muhammad]], who claimed to be a descendent of Caliph [[Ali ibn Abu Talib]].&lt;ref name="Furlonge"/&gt; Several historians, such as Al-Tabari and Al-Masudi, consider this revolt one of the ‚Äúmost vicious and brutal uprising‚Äù out of the many disturbances that plagued the [[Abbasid]] central government.&lt;ref name="Furlonge"/&gt;

===Political power===
{{main|Ghilman|Mamluk}}
[[Image:Mamluke.jpg|thumb|A Mamluk cavalryman, drawn in 1810]]
[[Mamluk]]s were slave soldiers who were converted to Islam and served the Muslim [[caliph]]s and the [[Ayyubid]] sultans during the Middle Ages.  Over time, they became a powerful military [[caste]], often defeating the [[Crusades|Crusader]]s and, on more than one occasion, they seized power for themselves, for example ruling [[Egypt]] in the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] from 1250-1517.

==Slavery in India==
In the [[Muslim conquests]] in the 8th century, the armies of the Umayyad commander [[Muhammad bin Qasim]], enslaved tens of thousands of Indian prisoners, including both soldiers and civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Mirza Kalichbeg Fredunbeg, tr., The Chachnamah, an Ancient History of Sind, 1900, reprint (Delhi, 1979), pp. 154, 163. This thirteenth-century source claims to be a Persian translation of an (apparently lost) eighth-century Arabic manuscript detailing the Islamic conquests of Sind.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andre Wink, Al-Hind: the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, vol. 1, Early Medieval India and the Expansion of Islam, Seventh to Eleventh Centuries (Leiden, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 11th century Tarikh al-Yamini, the Arab historian [[Al-Utbi]] recorded that in 1001 the armies of [[Mahmud of Ghazna]] conquered [[Peshawar]] and [[Waihand]] (capital of Gandhara) after [[Battle of Peshawar (1001)|Battle of Peshawar]] (1001), "in the midst of the land of [[Hindustan]]", and captured some 100,000 youths.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad Qasim Firishta, Tarikh-i-Firishta (Lucknow, 1864).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andre Wink, Al-Hind: the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, vol. 2, The Slave Kings and the Islamic Conquest, 11th‚Äì13th centuries (Leiden, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Later, following his twelfth expedition into India in 1018‚Äì19, Mahmud is reported to have returned with such a large number of slaves that their value was reduced to only two to ten dirhams each. This unusually low price made, according to Al-Utbi, "merchants [come] from distant cities to purchase them, so that the countries of Central Asia, Iraq and Khurasan were swelled with them, and the fair and the dark, the rich and the poor, mingled in one common slavery". Elliot and Dowson refer to "five hundred thousand slaves, beautiful men and women.".&lt;ref&gt;Abu Nasr Muhammad al-Utbi, Tarikh al-Yamini (Delhi, 1847), tr. by James Reynolds, The Kitab-i-Yamini (London, 1858),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wink, Al-Hind, II&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henry M. Elliot and John Dowson, History of India as told by its own Historians, 8 vols (London, 1867‚Äì77), II,&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during the [[Delhi Sultanate]] period (1206‚Äì1555), references to the abundant availability of low-priced Indian slaves abound. Levi attributes this primarily to the vast human resources of India, compared to its neighbors to the north and west (India's [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] population being approximately 12 to 20 times that of [[Turan]] and [[Iran]] at the end of the 16th century).&lt;ref&gt;Dale, Indian Merchants,&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Delhi sultanate]] obtained thousands of slaves and eunuch servants from the villages of Eastern [[Bengal]] (a widespread practice which Mughal emperor [[Jahangir]] later tried to stop). Wars, famines, pestilences drove many villagers to sell their children as slaves. The Muslim conquest of [[Gujarat]] in Western India had two main objectives. The conquerors demanded and more often forcibly wrested both land owned by Hindus and Hindu women. Enslavement of women invariably led to their conversion to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Satish C. Misra, ''The Rise of Muslim Power in Gujarat'' (Bombay, 1963), p 205.&lt;/ref&gt; In battles waged by Muslims against Hindus in [[Malwa]] and [[Deccan plateau]], a large number of captives were taken. Muslim soldiers were permitted to retain and enslave POWs as plunder.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge History of India'' ed. Wolseley Haig, Vol. III pp.356, 449.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[Bahmani]] sultan, [[Alauddin Bahman Shah]] is noted to have captured 1,000 singing and dancing girls from Hindu temples after he battled the northern [[Carnatic region|Carnatic]] chieftains. The later Bahmanis also enslaved civilian women and children in wars; many of them were converted to Islam in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;''Cambridge History of India'' ed.

A member of the Ottoman slave class, called a ''[[Wiktionary:kul#Turkish|kul]]'' in [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]], could achieve high status. [[Kizlar Agha|Black castrated slaves]], were tasked to guard the [[Ottoman Imperial Harem|imperial harem]]s, while [[Kapi Agha|white castrated slaves]] filled administrative functions. [[Janissaries]] were the elite soldiers of the imperial armies collected in childhood as a "[[Dev≈üirme|blood tax]]", while [[galley slaves]] captured in [[slave raids]] or as [[prisoners of war]], manned the imperial vessels. Slaves were actually often at the forefront of Ottoman politics. The majority of officials in the Ottoman government were bought slaves, raised free, and integral to the success of the Ottoman Empire from the 14th century into the 19th. Many officials themselves owned a large number of slaves, although the [[Sultan of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] himself owned by far the largest amount.&lt;ref name="Dursteler2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Dursteler|title=Venetians in Constantinople: Nation, Identity, and Coexistence in the Early Modern Mediterranean|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LF8uer6PMfAC&amp;pg=PA72|year=2006|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8324-8|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; By raising and specially training slaves as officials in [[palace school]]s such as [[Enderun]], the Ottomans created administrators with intricate knowledge of government and fanatic loyalty.

==Slavery in Sultanates of Southeast Asia==
{{See also|Piracy in the Sulu Sea|Spanish expedition to Balanguingui}}
In the [[East Indies]], slavery was common until the end of the 19th century. The slave trade was centered on the Muslim Sultanates in the [[Sulu Sea]]: the [[Sultanate of Sulu]], the [[Sultanate of Maguindanao]], and the [[Confederation of Sultanates in Lanao]] (the modern [[Moro people]]). The economies of these sultanates relied heavily on the slave trade.&lt;ref name="warren2"/&gt; 
[[File:Iranun lanong warship by Rafael Monle√≥n (1890).jpg|left|250px|thumb||An [[Iranun people|Iranun]] ''[[lanong]]'' warship used for piracy and slave raids in the [[Sulu Sea]]]]
It is estimated that from 1770 to 1870, around 200,000 to 300,000 people were enslaved by [[Iranun people|Iranun]] and [[Banguingui]] slavers. These were taken from piracy on passing ships as well as coastal raids on settlements as far as the [[Malacca Strait]], [[Java]], the southern coast of [[China]] and the islands beyond the [[Makassar Strait]]. Most of the slaves were [[Tagalogs]], [[Visayans]], and "Malays" (including [[Bugis]], [[Mandarese people|Mandarese]], [[Iban people|Iban]], and [[Makassar people|Makassar]]). There were also occasional European and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] captives who were usually ransomed off through [[Tausug people|Tausug]] intermediaries of the [[Sulu Sultanate]].&lt;ref name="warren2"/&gt; 
[[File:Iranum pirate.png|thumb|upright|An [[Iranun people|Iranun]] pirate armed with a spear, a ''[[kampilan]]'' sword, and a ''[[kris]]'' dagger]]
The scale was so massive that the word for "pirate" in [[Malay language|Malay]] became ''Lanun'', an [[exonym]] of the Iranun people.  Male captives of the Iranun and the Banguingui were treated brutally, even fellow Muslim captives were not spared. They were usually forced to serve as [[galley slave]]s on the ''[[lanong]]'' and ''[[garay (ship)|garay]]'' warships of their captors. Female captives, however, were usually treated better. There were no recorded accounts of rapes, though some were starved for discipline. Within a year of capture, most of the captives of the Iranun and Banguingui would be bartered off in [[Jolo, Sulu|Jolo]] usually for rice, opium, bolts of cloth, iron bars, brassware, and weapons. The buyers were usually Tausug ''[[datu]]'' from the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] who had preferential treatment, but buyers also included European (Dutch and Portuguese) and Chinese traders as well as Visayan pirates (''renegados'').&lt;ref name="warren2"/&gt; 

The economy of the Sulu sultanates was largely run by slaves and the slave trade. Slaves were the primary indicators of wealth and status, and they were the source of labor for the farms, fisheries, and workshops of the sultanates. While personal slaves were rarely sold, they trafficked extensively in slaves purchased from the Iranun and Banguingui [[slave market]]s. By the 1850s, slaves constituted 50% or more of the population of the Sulu archipelago.&lt;ref name="warren2"/&gt; 

Chattel slaves (known as ''banyaga'', ''bisaya'', ''ipun'', or ''ammas'') were distinguished from the traditional debt bondsmen (the ''kiapangdilihan'', known as ''[[alipin]]'' elsewhere in the Philippines). The bondsmen were natives enslaved to pay for debt or crime. They were slaves only in terms of their temporary service requirement to their master, but retained most of the rights of the freemen, including protection from physical harm and the fact that they can not be sold. The ''banyaga'' on the other hand had little to no rights.&lt;ref name="warren2"/&gt; 

Most slaves were treated like serfs and servants. Educated and skilled slaves were largely treated well. Since most of the aristocratic classes in Sulu were illiterate, they were often dependent on the educated ''banyaga'' as scribes and interpreters. Slaves part of the labor force were often given their own houses and lived in small communities with slaves of similar ethnic and religious backgrounds. However harsh punishment and abuse was not uncommon despite Islamic laws, especially for slave laborers and slaves who attempt to escape.&lt;ref name="warren2"/&gt;  
[[File:Bombardment Balanguingui.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Spanish expedition to Balanguingui|Spanish warships bombarding]] Moro pirates in [[Balanguingui Island]] in 1848]]
Spanish authorities and native Christian Filipinos responded to the Moro slave raids by building watchtowers and forts across the Philippine archipelago. Many of which are still standing today. Some provincial capitals were also moved further inland. Major command posts were built in [[Manila City|Manila]], [[Cavite City|Cavite]], [[Cebu City|Cebu]], [[Iloilo City|Iloilo]], [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], and [[Iligan City|Iligan]]. Defending ships were also built by local communities, especially in the [[Visayas Islands]], including the construction of war "''barangayanes''" (''[[balangay]]'') that were faster than the Moro raiders and could give chase. As resistance against raiders increased, ''[[Lanong]]'' warships of the Iranun were eventually replaced by the smaller and faster ''[[garay (ship)|garay]]'' warships of the Banguingui in the early 19th century. The Moro raids were eventually subdued by several major naval expeditions by the Spanish and local forces from 1848 to 1891, including retaliatory bombardment and capture of Moro settlements. By this time, the Spanish had also acquired [[steamship|steam gunboat]]s (''vapor''), which could easily overtake and destroy the native Moro warships.&lt;ref name="warren"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Francis Warren|title =The Sulu Zone, 1768-1898: The Dynamics of External Trade, Slavery, and Ethnicity in the Transformation of a Southeast Asian Maritime State|publisher =NUS Press|year =2007|pages=257&amp;ndash;258|isbn =9789971693862}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="non"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barrows"&gt;{{cite book|author=David P.

[[File:Landing Balanguingui.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Spanish expedition to Balanguingui|Spanish and auxiliary Filipino troops landing]] at [[Balanguingui Island]]]]
The slave raids on merchant ships and coastal settlements disrupted traditional trade in goods in the Sulu Sea. While this was temporarily offset by the economic prosperity brought by the slave trade, the decline of slavery in the mid-19th century also led to the economic decline of the Sultanates of [[Sultanate of Brunei|Brunei]], Sulu, and Maguindanao. This eventually led to the collapse of the latter two states and contributed to the widespread poverty of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao|Moro region]] in the [[Philippines]] today. By the 1850s, most slaves were local-born from slave parents as the raiding became more difficult. By the end of the 19th century and the conquest of the Sultanates by the Spanish and the Americans, the slave population were largely integrated into the native population as citizens under the Philippine government.&lt;ref name="warren"/&gt;&lt;ref name="warren2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="non"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Domingo M.

The [[Sultanate of Gowa]] of the [[Bugis people]] also became involved in the Sulu slave trade. They purchased slaves (as well as opium and Bengali cloth) from the Sulu Sea sultanates then sold them in the [[slave market]]s in the rest of Southeast Asia. Several hundred slaves (mostly Christian Filipinos) were sold by the Bugis annually in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], [[Malacca]], [[Banten (town)|Bantam]], [[Chirebon]], [[Banjarmasin]], and [[Palembang]] by the Bugis. The slaves were usually sold to Dutch and Chinese families as servants, sailors, laborers, and concubines. The sale of Christian Filipinos (who were Spanish subjects) in Dutch-controlled cities led to formal protests by the Spanish Empire to the Netherlands and its prohibition in 1762 by the Dutch, but it had little effect due to lax or absent enforcement. The Bugis slave trade was only stopped in the 1860s when the Spanish navy from Manila started patrolling Sulu waters to intercept Bugis slave ships and rescue Filipino captives. Also contributing to the decline was the hostility of the [[Sama-Bajau people|Sama-Bajau]] raiders in [[Tawi-Tawi]] who broke off their allegiance to the Sultanate of Sulu in the mid-1800s and started attacking ships trading with the Tausug ports.&lt;ref name="warren2"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Francis Warren|title =Iranun and Balangingi: Globalization, Maritime Raiding and the Birth of Ethnicity|publisher =NUS Press|year =2002|pages=53&amp;ndash;56|isbn =9789971692421|url =https://nuspress.nus.edu.sg/products/iranun-and-balangingi}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[Singapore]] as late as 1891, there was a regular trade in Chinese slaves by Muslim slaveowners, with girls and women sold for concubinage.&lt;ref&gt;S.Hurgronje, Verspreide Geschriften (Bonn, 1923), II, II ff&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Egyptian invasion of Sudan 1820-24#Sudanese slaves in Egypt}}The strong abolitionist movement in the 19th century in England and later in other [[Western world|Western countries]] influenced slavery in Muslim lands. Though the "position of the domestic slave in Muslim society was in most respects better than in either [[classical antiquity]] or the nineteenth-century Americas", due to regulation by Sharia law,&lt;ref name="Lewis1"&gt;Bernard Lewis, (1992), pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt; the enlightened incentives and opportunities for slaves to be emancipated meant there was a strong market for new slaves and thus strong incentive to enslave and sell human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard  ''Race and Slavery in the Middle East'' (1990) p.9-11&lt;/ref&gt; Appalling loss of life and hardships often resulted from the processes of acquisition and transportation of slaves to Muslim lands and this drew the attention of European opponents of slavery. The continuing pressure from European countries eventually overcame the strong resistance of religious conservatives who were holding that forbidding what God permits is just as great an offence as to permit what God forbids. Slavery, in their eyes, was "authorized and regulated by the holy law".&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Bernard  ''Race and Slavery in the Middle East'' (1990) p.111, 149-156&lt;/ref&gt; Even masters persuaded of their own piety and benevolence sexually exploited their concubines, without a thought of whether this constituted a violation of their humanity.&lt;ref name=RSIBS2001:5&gt;[[#RSIBS2001|Segal, ''Islam's Black Slaves'', 2001]]: p.5&lt;/ref&gt; There were also many pious Muslims who refused to have slaves and persuaded others to do so.&lt;ref&gt;[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] (2004), p.182&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, the Ottoman Empire's orders against the traffic of slaves were issued and put into effect.&lt;ref name="Lewis1" /&gt;

According to Brockopp, in the 19th century, "Some authorities made blanket pronouncements against slavery, arguing that it violated the Qur æƒÅnic ideals of equality and freedom. The great slave markets of Cairo were closed down at the end of the nineteenth century and even conservative Qur æƒÅn interpreters continue to regard slavery as opposed to Islamic principles of justice and equality."&lt;ref name="Brockopp"/&gt;

According to a March 1886 article in ''The New York Times'',  the Ottoman Empire allowed a slave trade in girls to thrive during the late 1800s, while publicly denying it. Girl sexual slaves sold in the Ottoman Empire were mainly of three ethnic groups: [[Circassians|Circassian]], [[Syrian]], and [[Nubian people|Nubian]]. Circassian girls were described by the American journalist as fair and light skinned. They were frequently sent by Circassian leaders as gifts to the Ottomans. They were the most expensive, reaching up to 500 [[Turkish lira]] and the most popular with the Turks. The next most popular slaves were Syrian girls, with "dark eyes and hair", and light brown skin. Their price could reach to thirty lira. They were described by the American journalist as having "good figures when young". Throughout coastal regions in [[Anatolia]], Syrian girls were sold. The ''New York Times'' journalist stated Nubian girls were the cheapest and least popular, fetching up to 20 lira.&lt;ref&gt;(byline dated March 4) {{cite news |title=Slaves sold to the Turk|author=Wolf Von Schierbrand |authorlink=Wolf Curt von Schierbrand |newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 28, 1886 |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1886/03/28/106300694.pdf|accessdate=2011-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Murray Gordon said that, unlike Western societies which developed anti-slavery movements, no such organizations developed in Muslim societies. In Muslim politics, the state interpreted Islamic law. This then extended legitimacy to the traffic in slaves.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon 1989, page 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about the Arabia he visited in 1862, the English traveler W. G. Palgrave met large numbers of black slaves. The effects of slave concubinage were apparent in the number of persons of mixed race and in the emancipation of slaves he found to be common.&lt;ref&gt;In his narrative of ''A Years Journey Through Central and Eastern Arabia'' 5th Ed.

According to British explorer (and abolitionist) [[Samuel Baker]], who visited Khartoum in 1862 six decades after the British had declared slave trade illegal, slave trade was the industry "that kept Khartoum going as a bustling town".&lt;ref name=jok-quote-5&gt;quotes by Jok Madut Jok, (source: {{cite book | author=Jok, Madut Jok| title=War and Slavery in Sudan| publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press | year=2001| isbn=978-0-8122-1762-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wqzvlWdxThwC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=War+and+Slavery+in+Sudan#v=onepage&amp;q=War%20and%20Slavery%20in%20Sudan&amp;f=false | page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From Khartoum slave raiders attacked African villages to the south, looting and destroying so that "surviving inhabitants would be force to collaborate with slavers on their next excursion against neighboring villages," and taking back captured women and young adults to sell in slave markets.&lt;ref name=jok-quote-5/&gt;

===20th-century suppression and prohibition===

At [[Istanbul]], the sale of black and [[Circassians|Circassian]] women was conducted openly until the granting of the Constitution in 1908.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, slavery gradually became outlawed and suppressed in Muslim lands, due to a combination of pressure exerted by Western nations such as Britain and France, internal pressure from Islamic abolitionist movements, and economic pressures.&lt;ref name="eois"/&gt;

By the [[Treaty of Jeddah (1927)|Treaty of Jeddah]], May 1927 (art.7), concluded between the British Government and [[Ibn Sa'ud]] (King of [[Nejd]] and the [[Hijaz]]) it was agreed to suppress the slave trade in [[Saudi Arabia]].  Then by a decree issued in 1936 the importation of slaves into Saudi Arabia was prohibited unless it could be proved that they were slaves at that date.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of slavery in the Islamic world in modern times is controversial. Critics argue there is hard evidence of its existence and destructive effects. According to the Oxford Dictionary of Islam, slavery in central Islamic lands has been "virtually extinct" since the mid-20th century, though there are reports indicating that it is still practiced in some areas of Sudan and Somalia as a result of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Slavery|editor=John L.

===Islamist opinions===
Earlier in the 20th century, prior to the "reopening" of slavery by [[Salafi]] scholars like Shaykh al-Fawzan, Islamist authors declared slavery outdated without actually clearly supporting its abolition. This has caused at least one scholar (William Clarence-Smith&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staffinfo.cfm?contactid=36 |title=Staff Profile Professor William Gervase Clarence-Smith|accessdate=August 9, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060417083811/http://www.soas.ac.uk/staff/staffinfo.cfm?contactid=36 |archivedate=April 17, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) to bemoan the "dogged refusal of [[Abul A'la Maududi|Mawlana Mawdudi]] to give up on slavery"&lt;ref name=CS-maududi&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarence-Smith|first1=W.

[[Muhammad Qutb]], brother and promoter of the famous [[Sayyid Qutb]], vigorously defended Islamic slavery from Western criticism, telling his audience that "Islam gave spiritual enfranchisement to slaves" and "in the early period of Islam the slave was exalted to such a noble state of humanity as was never before witnessed in any other part of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Qutb, Muhammad, ''[http://www.islamicbulletin.org/free_downloads/new_muslim/islam_the_misunderstood_religion.pdf Islam, the Misunderstood Religion]'', islamicbulletin.org p.27-8&lt;/ref&gt; He contrasted the adultery, prostitution,&lt;ref name=IMRMQ41/&gt; and (what he called) "that most odious form of animalism" casual sex, found in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;Qutb, Muhammad, ''Islam, the Misunderstood Religion'', Markazi Maktabi Islami, Delhi-6, 1992 p.50&lt;/ref&gt; with (what he called) "that clean and spiritual bond that ties a maid [i.e. slave girl] to her master in Islam."&lt;ref name=IMRMQ41&gt;Qutb, Muhammad, ''[http://www.islamicbulletin.org/free_downloads/new_muslim/islam_the_misunderstood_religion.pdf Islam, the Misunderstood Religion]'', islamicbulletin.org p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

;Salafi support for slavery

In recent years, according to some scholars,&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Abou El Fadl and William Clarence-Smith&lt;/ref&gt; there has been a "reopening"&lt;ref&gt;Abou el Fadl, ''Great Theft'', HarperSanFrancisco, c2005. p.255&lt;/ref&gt; of the issue of slavery by some conservative [[Salafi]] Islamic scholars after its "closing" earlier in the 20th century when [[Majority Muslim countries|Muslim countries]] banned slavery.

In 2003, Shaykh [[Saleh Al-Fawzan]], a member of Saudi Arabia‚Äôs highest religious body, the [[Council of Senior Scholars (Saudi Arabia)|Senior Council of Clerics]], issued a fatwa claiming
‚ÄúSlavery is a part of Islam. Slavery is part of jihad, and jihad will remain as long there is Islam.‚Äù&lt;ref&gt;Shaikh Salih al-Fawzan "affirmation of slavery" was found on page 24 of "Taming a Neo-Qutubite Fanatic Part 1" when accessed on February 17, 2007 {{cite web|url=http://www.salafipublications.com/sps/downloads/pdf/GRV070005.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319010029/http://www.salafipublications.com/sps/downloads/pdf/GRV070005.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Muslim scholars who said otherwise were "infidels".

While [[Saleh Al-Fawzan]]'s fatwa does not repeal Saudi laws against slavery,{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} the fatwa carries weight among many [[Salafi]] Muslims. According to reformist jurist and author Khaled Abou El Fadl, it "is particularly disturbing and dangerous because it effectively legitimates the trafficking in and sexual exploitation of so-called domestic workers in the Gulf region and especially Saudi Arabia."&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists'', by Khaled Abou El Fadl, Harper San Francisco, 2005, p.255&lt;/ref&gt; Organized criminal gangs smuggle children into Saudi Arabia where they are enslaved, sometimes mutilated, and forced to work as beggars.

===Mauritania and Sudan===
In Mauritania slavery was abolished in the country's first constitution of 1961 after independence, and abolished yet again, by presidential decree, in July 1980. The "catch" of these abolitions was that slave ''ownership'' was not abolished. The edict "recognized the rights of owners by stipulating that they should be compensated for their loss of property". No financial payment was provided by the state, so that the abolition amounted to "little more than propaganda for foreign consumption". Religious authorities within Mauritania assailed abolition. One leader, El Hassan Ould Benyamine, imam of a mosque in Tayarat attacked it as &lt;blockquote&gt;"not only illegal because it is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran. The abolition also amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their goods, goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.` &lt;ref name="RSIBS2001:206"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"God created Me to Be a Slave," ''New York Times Magazine'', October 12, 1997, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1994-5 a Special Rapporteur of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights documented the physically and emotionally abuse of captives by the Sudanese Army and allied militia and army. The captives were "sold as slaves or forced to work under conditions amounting to slavery". The Sudanese government responded with "fury", accusing the author, Gaspar Biro of "harboring anti-Islam and Anti-Arab sentiments". In 1999 the UN Commission sent another Special Rapporteur who "also produced a detailed examination of the question of slavery incriminating the government of Sudan."{{sfn|Jok|2001|p=xi}} At least in the 1980s, slavery in Sudan was developed enough for slaves to have a market price‚Äîthe price of a slave boy fluctuating between $90 and $10 in 1987 and 1988.{{sfn|Jok|2001|p=2}}

===Saudi Arabia===

According to the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] as of 2005:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Saudi Arabia is a destination for men and women from South and East Asia and East Africa trafficked for the purpose of labor exploitation, and for children from Yemen, Afghanistan, and Africa trafficking for forced begging. Hundreds of thousands of low-skilled workers from India, Indonesia, the Philippines, [[Sri Lanka]], Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Eritrea, and Kenya migrate voluntarily to Saudi Arabia; some fall into conditions of [[involuntary servitude]], suffering from physical and [[sexual abuse]], non-payment or delayed payment of wages, the withholding of travel documents, restrictions on their [[freedom of movement]] and non-consensual contract alterations.

The Government of Saudi Arabia does not comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking and is not making significant efforts to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/tip/rls/tiprpt/2005/46616.htm|title=V.

===Libya and Algeria===

Libya is a [[European migrant crisis|major exit point]] for African migrants heading to Europe. [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM) published a report in April 2017 showing that many of the migrants from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] heading to Europe are sold as slaves after being detained by [[people smugglers]] or militia groups. African countries south of Libya were targeted for slave trading and transferred to Libyan slave markets instead. According to the victims, the price is higher for migrants with skills like painting and tiling.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39567632|title=African migrants sold in Libya 'slave markets', IOM says|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/10/libya-public-slave-auctions-un-migration|title=Migrants from west Africa being ‚Äòsold in Libyan slave markets‚Äô|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slaves are often [[ransom]]ed to their families and in the meantime until [[ransom]] can be paid tortured, forced to work, sometimes to death and eventually executed or left to starve if they can't pay for too long. Women are often raped and used as [[sex slave]]s and sold to [[brothel]]s and private Libyan clients.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nation.co.ke/news/africa/African-migrants-sold-as-slaves-in-Libya-/1066-3886812-5hy4xoz/index.html|title=African migrants sold as 'slaves'  in Libya|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boingboing.net/2017/04/11/international-organization-for.html|title=West African migrants are kidnapped and sold in Libyan slave markets / Boing Boing|website=boingboing.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many child migrants also suffer from abuse and [[child rape]] in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-39109585|title=Libya exposed as child migrant abuse hub|first=Paul|last=Adams|date=28 February 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alwaght.com/en/News/89562/Immigrant-Women,-Children-Raped,-Starved-in-Libya%E2%80%99s-Hellholes-Unicef|title=Immigrant Women, Children Raped, Starved in Libya's Hellholes: Unicef|date=28 February 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2017, hundreds of African migrants were being forced into slavery by human smugglers who were themselves facilitating their arrival in the country. Most of the migrants are from [[Nigeria]], [[Senegal]] and [[Gambia]]. They however end up in cramped warehouses due to the crackdown by the Libyan Coast Guard, where they are held until they are ransomed or are sold for labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-monday-edition-1.4410390/reporter-describes-surreal-experience-of-watching-a-migrant-slave-auction-in-libya-1.4410397|title=Reporter describes 'surreal' experience of watching a migrant slave auction in Libya|publisher=CBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libyan authorities of the [[Government of National Accord]] announced that they had opened up an investigation into the auctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2017/11/17/africa/libya-slave-auction-investigation/index.html |title= Libya opens investigation into slave auctions following CNN report |publisher= CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; A human trafficker told [[Al-Jazeera]] that hundreds of the migrants are bought and sold across the country every week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/11/african-refugees-bought-sold-murdered-libya-171129103602048.html|title= African refugees bought, sold and murdered in Libya |publisher= Al-Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dozens of African migrants headed for a new life in Europe in 2018 said they were sold for labor and trapped in slavery in Algeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN1IV1R5-OZATP

{{main|Slavery in 21st-century Islamism}}
In 2014, [[Islamic terrorist]] groups  in the Middle East ([[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] also known as Islamic State) and Northern Nigeria ([[Boko Haram]]) have not only justified the taking of slaves in war but actually enslaved women and girls.
[[Abubakar Shekau]], the leader of the Nigerian extremist group [[Boko Haram]]  said in an interview, "I shall capture people and make them slaves".&lt;ref name=CNNEssenceTerror&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/05/06/world/africa/nigeria-boko-haram-analysis/ |publisher=CNN |title=Boko Haram: The essence of terror |last=Lister |first=Tim |date=6 May 2014 |accessdate=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the digital magazine ''[[Dabiq (magazine)|Dabiq]]'', ISIS claimed religious justification for enslaving [[Yazidi]] women whom they consider to be from a heretical sect.

In response to [[Boko Haram]]'s Quranic justification for kidnapping and enslaving people and ISIS's religious justification for enslaving [[Yazidi]] women, 126 Islamic scholars from around the Muslim world signed an [[open letter]] in late September 2014 to the Islamic State's leader [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], rejecting his group's interpretations of the [[Quran|Qur'an]] and [[hadith]] to justify its actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Muslim Scholars Release Open Letter to Islamic State Meticulously Blasting Its Ideology|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/24/muslim-scholars-islamic-state_n_5878038.html|work=The Huffington Post|date=24 September 2013|author=Lauren Markoe|agency=Religious News Service|accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=christianpost-2014-09-25&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Samuel|title=International Coalition of Muslim Scholars Refute ISIS' Religious Arguments in Open Letter to al-Baghdadi|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/international-coalition-of-muslim-scholars-refute-isis-religious-arguments-in-open-letter-to-al-baghdadi-127032/|accessdate=18 October 2014|work=[[The Christian Post]]|date=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter accuses the group of instigating [[fitna (word)|fitna]] ‚Äî sedition ‚Äî by instituting slavery under its rule in contravention of the [[Islamic views on slavery#Modern interpretations|anti-slavery consensus]] of the [[ulama|Islamic scholarly community]].&lt;ref name=OpenLetToAlBagh&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Letter to Al-Baghdadi |url=http://lettertobaghdadi.com/index.php |date=September 2014 |accessdate=25 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140925193528/http://lettertobaghdadi.com/index.php |archivedate=25 September 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{islam by country}}

The history of '''Islam in [[Iraq]]''' goes back almost 1,400 years to the lifetime of [[Muhammad]] (died 632).

Iraq's Muslims follow two distinct traditions, [[Shia Islam|Shia]] and [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Islam. Arabic-speaking Shias are known as Iraqiyyuns, and Arabic-speaking Sunnis are known as Jaziran Arabs. Iraq is home to many religious cities important for both Shia and Sunni Muslims. [[Baghdad]] was a hub of [[Islam]]ic learning and scholarship for centuries and served as the capital of the [[Abassids]]. Baghdad also is home to two prominent Shia Imams in what is known as [[Kadhimiya]], Iraq. The city of [[Karbala]] has substantial prominence in Shia Islam as a result of the [[Battle of Karbala]], fought in October 10, 680.  Similarly, [[Najaf]] is renowned as the site of the tomb of [[Ali|Alƒ´ ibn Abƒ´ TƒÅlib]] (also known as "ImƒÅm Alƒ´"), whom the Shia consider to be the righteous caliph and first [[imam|imƒÅm]]. The city is now a great center of pilgrimage from throughout the Shi'a Islamic world and it is estimated that only [[Mecca]] and [[Medina]] receive more Muslim pilgrims.  The city of [[Kufa]] was home to the famed scholar [[Abu Hanifah]], whose school of thought is followed by many Sunni Muslims internationally. Kufa was also the capital of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] during the time of [[Ali]]. Likewise, [[Samarra]] is also home to the [[al-Askari Mosque]], containing the mausoleums of the [[Ali al-Hadi]] and [[Hasan al-Askari]], the tenth and eleventh [[Shia Imams]] respectively, as well as the [[maqam (shrine)|maqam]] (or "point") of [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who is the twelfth and final Imam of the Shia Madhhab. This has made it an important pilgrimage centre for Ja'farƒ´ Shia Muslims. In addition, some female relatives of Muhammad are buried in Samarra, making the city one of the most significant sites of worship for Shia Muslims and a venerated location for Sunni Muslims. Basra Iraq is also a prominent Shia area due to its significant role during the [[First Fitna]], where Ali defeated [[Aisha]] during the [[Battle of the Camel]].

[[File:Imam Husayn Shrine by Tasnimnews 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Imam Husayn Shrine]]]]

Smaller sects of Islam exist in the country, such as the small [[Shaykhism|Shaykhist]] community concentrated in [[Basra]] and Karbala.

The Muslim population of Iraq is approximately Shia 65% and Sunni 35%.&lt;ref name="CIATONGA"/&gt;  Iraqi Kurds are mostly Sunni, with about 2% being Shi'a Faili Kurds.{{fact|date=July 2017}} Most Kurds are located in the northern areas of the country, with most following the [[Shafi]] school of [[Sharia|Islamic law]] but with some being members of either the [[Qadiri]] or the [[Naqshbandi]] [[Sufi]] [[tariqah]].{{fact|date=July 2017}}

In addition to his books on the relationship between science, ethics and the humanities, he has written widely on the [[Catholic Church]] and the modern papacy.

==Early life==
John Cornwell was born in [[East Ham]], London, the son of Sidney Arthur Cornwell and Kathleen Egan Cornwell.

Raised as a [[Roman Catholic]], Cornwell entered the junior seminary, [[Cotton College]], in 1953 intending to become a priest.  He later wrote a memoir of his five years at Cotton.&lt;ref name="seminaryboy"&gt;{{cite book|title=Seminary Boy | last=Cornwell | first=John | publisher=Doubleday | location=New York | year=2006 | isbn=0-385-51486-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to the senior seminary, [[Oscott College]], [[Sutton Coldfield]], in 1958.

Cornwell studied English Language and Literature at [[St Benet's Hall, Oxford]] and was tutored by Jonathan Wordsworth at Exeter College. He graduated in 1964, and went on to [[Christ's College, Cambridge]] as a graduate student.

After Cambridge, Cornwell taught in East London schools, before becoming a teaching fellow in English and philosophy at [[McMaster University]], Ontario. From 1970 to 1976 he worked as a freelance journalist, mainly for The Guardian and ''[[The Observer]]'' Magazine, with periods in Italy and Latin America as a Foreign Correspondent. In 1973 he reported from Buenos Aires,  and in 1975 from Santiago, Chile,  and Buenos Aires. From 1976 to 1988 he was on the staff at ''The Observer'', serving on the Foreign desk and later as Editor and Manager of ''The Observer'' Foreign News Service,  which he took from hard copy to high speed wire delivery worldwide.  In 1982 he was appointed  New Media Publisher, responsible for developing seven parallel media businesses,  including creation of  UK‚Äôs first interactive electronic newspaper with Prestel,  joint venture book publishing, and educational resources. He was ''The Observer''‚Äôs delegate at the International Press Institute (1978-1988); investigator and raporteur on the 20th Century Fund Task Force convened in New York and Oxford in 1978-79  on the tensions between  Western free-enterprise media and government media organisations: findings and analysis published in his Free and Balanced Flow  (1979).

His first two books were novels:  ''The Spoiled Priest'', and ''Seven Other Demons''. Two decades later he published a third novel, ''Strange Gods''.  In 1973 he published a critical biography of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]], ''Coleridge, Poet and Revolutionary, 1772‚Äì1804''.

In 1982 he published ''Earth to Earth'',  the story of a farming family tragedy at [[Winkleigh]] in Devon for which he won the non-fiction Gold Dagger Award.

==''A Thief in the Night''==
His 1989 book ''A Thief in the Night'' investigated the 1978 death of [[Pope John Paul I]], which was surrounded by [[Pope John Paul I conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories]]. Though Cornwell sharply criticised Vatican prelates, he concluded that the Pope was not murdered but died of a [[pulmonary embolism]], possibly brought on by overwork and neglect.

==''Hitler's Pope''==
{{Main|Hitler's Pope}}

In 1999, Cornwell published ''[[Hitler's Pope]]'', in which he accuses [[Pope Pius XII]] of assisting in the legitimisation of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi regime]] in Germany through the pursuit of a [[Reichskonkordat]] in 1933 and of remaining silent, like the Allies, after  information about the [[Holocaust]] was released to the public in late 1942 and early 1943.

[[Owen Chadwick]] praised the book's scholarly approach and the abundance of new information Cornwell had managed to unearth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chadwick|first=Owen|title=Review of Hitler's Pope|url=http://www.thetablet.co.uk/article/6758|work=The Tablet|publisher=The Tablet|accessdate=23 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Cornwell stated that Pius XII "had so little scope of action that it is impossible to judge the motives for his silence during the war, while Rome was under the heel of Mussolini and later occupied by Germany ... But even if his prevarications and silences were performed with the best of intentions, he had an obligation in the postwar period to explain those actions".&lt;ref name="The Papacy"&gt;"[http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_PQSTTPS The Papacy]", ''The Economist'', 9 December 2004, p. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John Cornwell 2004 p. 193"&gt;John Cornwell, ''The Pontiff in Winter'' (2004), p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; He similarly stated in 2008 that Pius XII's "scope for action was severely limited", but that "[n]evertheless, due to his ineffectual and diplomatic language in respect of the Nazis and the Jews, I still believe that it was incumbent on him to explain his failure to speak out after the war. This he never did."&lt;ref name=TheBulletin&gt;''The Bulletin'' (Philadelphia, 27 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In a variety of broadcasts and subsequent print commentary Cornwell has continued to insist that Pacelli's principal failure (as Cardinal Secretary of State), through the Reichsconcordat (1933), was to act as a fellow traveller, taking benefits from  Hitler  on behalf of Pius XI and  the Catholic Church while patently distancing himself from Nazi ideology - the effect of which was to scandalise youth, demoralise opposition, and give Hitler credit in the eyes of the world.

In 2004, Cornwell followed up ''Hitler's Pope'' with ''Hitler's Scientists''.

==''A Pontiff in Winter''==
In 2004, Cornwell also published ''A Pontiff in Winter'', a work critical of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Reviews of the book were often fiercely divided. [[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]] in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said the book "dissects the record of John Paul II's pontificate with an informed, dispassionate and fully convincing authority".&lt;ref&gt;James Carroll, "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A43067-2005Jan27.html  The Pope and His Legacy]", ''The Washington Post'', 30 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[the Guardian]]'', Stephen Bates said: "John Cornwell has produced a devastating report. Catholics should read it, if not to change their views ‚Äì though perhaps it should ‚Äì then at least to inform them".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2005/feb/12/highereducation.news3&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Newman's Unquiet Grave: The Reluctant Saint''==
Published in 2010 by Continuum, this biography of Cardinal [[John Henry Newman]] coincided with renewed interest in the 19th century theologian and religious leader as a result of his [[beatification]] during the Papal visit by Pope Benedict XVI to England and Scotland. Philosopher [[Anthony Kenny]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' wrote that "''Newman's Unquiet Grave'' is a substantial achievement ... John Cornwell has taken on the task of writing a biography of Newman to make his life intelligible to the largely secular public which in a few weeks will watch on television the ceremony of his beatification. He has followed a ''via media'' between the [[hagiography]] of [[Meriol Trevor]] and the mockery of [[Lytton Strachey]], and he has produced a Life which is readable, sympathetic and judicious ... Altogether, he has succeeded in building up a vivid picture of Newman's personality."&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Kenny, [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article7164550.ece "Was Cardinal Newman a Saint?"], ''The Times Literary Supplement'', 28 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science, Ethics and Humanities==
As Research Fellow  (elected 1990, Fellow Commoner 1996) and Director of the ''Science and Human Dimension Project'' at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], Cornwell has brought together many scientists, philosophers, ethicists, authors and journalists to debate and discuss a range of topics. His books in the field of public understanding of science include ''Nature's Imagination'',  ''Consciousness and Human Identity'', and ''Explanations'',  all published by Oxford University Press. His journalism in this field has been published in a variety of outlets including ''Financial Times'', ''Sunday Times Magazine'',    ''The Observer'', ''New Statesman'', ''New Scientist'', ''Nature'', ''Prospect'', ''Times Literary Supplement'', ''The Tablet'', ''Brain'', ''New Scientist'', ''The Guardian'', and ''The Times''. Broadcast contributions to many BBC programmes, especially on culture, science and religion, including   "Hard Talk", "Choice", "Start the Week,"  "The Moral Maze" (e.g. witness on genetic determinism debate), "Today" (e.g. debate with Richard Dawkins);    "Beyond Belief" (on John Henry Newman‚Äôs Idea of a University), "Thought for the Day" (on  Darwin‚Äôs birthday), "Sunday", and various programmes in the BBC‚Äôs World Service.

==The Rustat Conferences==
In 2009, he was appointed founding Director of the Rustat Conferences, also based at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]]. This project brings together academics with those from politics, business, the media and education to discuss the vital issues of the day in a roundtable format. The first two meetings in 2009 discussed the global Economic Crisis, and the Future of Democracy. The third Rustat Conferences meeting addressed Infrastructure and the Future of Society ‚Äì infrastructure for energy security, cities of the future, and water.

'''Kenneth Scott Latourette''' (August 6, 1884 ‚Äì December 26, 1968) was an American [[sinologist|historian of China]], Japan, and [[world Christianity]].&lt;ref name="nyt1969"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1969/01/01/archives/dr-kenneth-latourette-is-dead-long-a-church-historian-at-yale.html?sq=kenneth%2520scott%2520latourette&amp;scp=8&amp;st=cse  "Dr. Kenneth Latourette Is Dead; Long a Church Historian at Yale; Professor at Divinity School Also Was an Authority on the World of the Orient,"] ''The New York Times.''  January 1, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt;   His formative experiences as Christian missionary and educator in early 20th century China shaped his life's work.  Although he did not learn the Chinese language, he became known for his magisterial scholarly surveys of the history of [[world Christianity]], the history of China, and of American relations with East Asia.{{Sfn | Kutcher | 1993}}

== Early life ==
Latourette was born in [[Oregon City, Oregon|Oregon City]], [[Oregon]], the son of DeWitt Clinton Latourette and Ella (Scott) Latourette. His mother and father both attended Pacific University in Forest Grove, Oregon, where they graduated in 1878.  DeWitt Clinton Latourette was a lawyer in Oregon City.

In 1904, Latourette was awarded a Bachelor of Science degree from [[Linfield College]] in Oregon.  He continued his education in New Haven, Connecticut at [[Yale University|Yale]], earning a BA in 1906, an MA in 1907 and PhD in 1909.&lt;ref name="busth1"&gt;[[Boston University School of Theology]] ([[Boston University School of Theology|BUSTH]]): Anderson, Gerald H. (1998). [http://digilib.bu.edu/mission/component/content/article/18-j2l/111-latourette-kenneth-scott-1884-1968.html "Latourette, Kenneth Scott,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216165002/http://digilib.bu.edu/mission/component/content/article/18-j2l/111-latourette-kenneth-scott-1884-1968.html |date=2009-02-16 }} in ''Biographical Dictionary of Christian Missions,'' pp. 384‚Äì85.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career==
From 1909 through 1910, Latourette served as a traveling secretary for the [[Student Volunteer Movement|Student Volunteer Movement for Foreign Missions]].&lt;ref name="busth1" /&gt;  In 1910, he joined the faculty of [[Yale-China Association|Yale-in China]]'s [[Yali School]] at [[Changsha]] in [[Hunan Province]]. He began to study the Chinese language, but in the summer of 1911 he contracted a severe case of amoeibic dysentery and was forced to return to the United States.{{sfnb|Hogg|1978}}

He welcomed student groups to meet in the living room and was known as "Uncle Ken." {{sfnb|Hogg|1978}}  He accepted appointment as the  D. Willis James Professor of Missions and World Christianity (1921‚Äì49), and he was later made the [[Sterling Professor|Sterling Professor of Missions and Oriental History]] (1949‚Äì53).&lt;ref name = "busth1" /&gt;  In 1938, he was named Chairman of the Department of Religion at Yale.  He took on greater responsibilities in 1946 as Director of Graduate Studies at the Yale Divinity School.&lt;ref name="nyt1969"/&gt;  From his retirement in 1953 until his death in 1968, he was Sterling Professor Emeritus at the Divinity School.

== Writings ==
Latourette was the author of over 80 books on Christianity, Oriental history and customs, and theological subjects.&lt;ref name="nyt1969"/&gt;

He also wrote and spoke out about issues of his time, as for example, when he warned his fellow Americans in 1943 about the unwanted consequences of revenge after Japan should eventually lose the war they started with the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F3081FFB35581B7B93C7A81789D95F478485F9  "Warns on Revenge After Japan Loses; Dr. K.S. Latourette Sees Peril in Depriving Our Foe of Way to Earn Livelihood,"] ''The New York Times.'' December 15, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Latourette later wrote extensively on China.

The single work for which Latourette is most remembered is the seven-volume ''"A History of the Expansion of Christianity".''&lt;ref&gt;Burger, Nash K. [https://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20912FE3855107B93C0A91783D85F478585F9  "In the Field of Religion,"] ''The New York Times.'' August 2, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt;  Latourette noted within Volume 4 that only 5% of Americans in 1790 had formal ties to churches or synagogues.

Latourette's papers are archived in the Divinity Library Special Collections of the Yale University Library.

'''Khordad Sal'''{{Pronunciation-needed}}&lt;!-- as IPA --&gt; is the birth anniversary (or birthdate) of [[Zoroaster]]. [[Zoroastrian]]s all over the world, especially the [[Parsi]]s of India, celebrate the day in a great glamor. Parties and [[ghambar]]s are held. Special prayers and jashan are also held throughout the entire day. Clean, [[rangoli]]-strewn homes, children with vermilion spots on their foreheads, new [[clothes]], fragrant flowers and delicious meals, all form part of the rituals. A grand feast is prepared to mark the occasion.

Since the Parsi community is especially tight-knit, its celebrations bring kith and kin together; so does Khordad Sal. The festival is also an opportunity for the Parsis to review their lives and actions, and make resolutions for the future.

'''Lhasa Newar''' (alternate name: '''Lhasa Newah''') ({{Lang-new|‡§≤‡•ç‡§π‡§æ‡§∏‡§æ ‡§®‡•á‡§µ‡§æ}}) refers to the expatriate [[Newar]] traders and artisans who traveled between the [[Kathmandu Valley]] and [[Tibet]] from centuries ago. The Nepalese merchants conducted trade between [[Nepal]], Tibet and [[Bengal]], [[India]] over the [[Silk Road]], and acted as a bridge for economic and cultural exchanges between [[South Asia]] and [[Central Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lewis|first=Todd T|title=Buddhism, Himalayan Trade, and Newar Merchants|url=http://buddhim.20m.com/8-4.htm/|accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turin|first=Mark|title=Banjas along the Barkhor|url=http://www.nepalitimes.com/issue/34/Review/9639|accessdate=19 September 2012|newspaper=Nepali Times|date=16 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the merchants, there were colonies of artisans in various parts of Tibet who were engaged in creating [[Buddhist]] art. They were major players in the exchange of art styles across the [[Himalaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lo Bue| first = Erberto F| title = Cultural Exchange and Social Interaction between Tibetans and Newars from the Seventh to the Twentieth Century| magazine =International Folklore Review| publisher =| year=1988| accessdate =}} Pages 86-114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Huc| first =M| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/3/3/2/6/33269/33269-h/33269-h.htm| title =Travels in Tartary, Thibet and China during the Years 1844-5-6. Volume 2| work = | publisher =London: Office of the National Illustrated Library | date=| accessdate = 31 October 2011}} Page 147.&lt;/ref&gt;

The thousand-year-old Lhasa Newar tradition came to an end after the caravan route linking India and Tibet through [[Sikkim]] was shut down by the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962. Subsequently, the merchants and craftsmen based in Tibet closed up shop and returned home to Nepal for the last time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/2013/06/2013623123438887107.html |title = Renewed Nepali trade route draws regional ire |last = Kaye|first = Melati |publisher = |date = 29 June 2013 |website = Al Jazeera |accessdate= 7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to folklore, [[Singha Sartha Aju]] was the first merchant to travel to Tibet. The history of the Lhasa Newars officially dates from the seventh century with the marriage of Nepalese Princess [[Bhrikuti]] with Tibetan King [[Songts√§n Gampo]]. The traders and artisans who accompanied Bhrikuti to Lhasa as part of her retinue established commercial and cultural ties between Nepal and Tibet.

In the 1640s, a treaty was negotiated under which Newar merchants were allowed to establish 32 business houses in Lhasa. It was also agreed that Nepal would mint coins for Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Leo E. (1971) ''Nepal: Strategy for Survival.'' University of California Press, Berkeley. {{ISBN|978-0-520-01643-9}}. Page 14.&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the number of traders had risen considerably. Eighteenth-century traveller [[Ippolito Desideri]] noted that merchants of Nepal were "numerous" in Lhas√°.&lt;ref&gt;Desideri, Ippolito and De Filippi, Filippo (reprinted 1996), ''An Account of Tibet: The Travels of Ippolito Desideri, 1712-1727'', Asian Educational Services. {{ISBN|978-81-206-1019-4}}. Pages 133, 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Newars were also organized into "pala" ({{Lang-new|‡§™‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ}}) societies which arranged the celebration of festivals and provided a place for get-togethers. The merchants celebrated [[Mohani]] and other feasts like they did in Kathmandu. There were 10 "palas" originally in Lhasa, and seven remained active until recent times‚ÄîChyatangya, Chhusingsyar, Ghorasyar, Jhwala, Lhakam, Kun and Tarunsyar. The Newars in Shigatse and other places in Tibet had their own "palas". Returning merchants and craftsmen were called "Lhasa Newars". Most of them were Buddhist Newars like the [[Uray (caste group)|Uray]], [[Bajracharya]], [[Shakya]] and Dhakhwa. There were also many [[Shrestha]]s and [[Maharjan]]s among them.

==Trade==

[[File:Ghorashar letterhead 1958.jpg|thumb|Letterhead of Ghorashar business house dated 1958.]]
Newar traders exported finished products from Nepal and India to Tibet and brought back goods from Tibet and other parts of [[Central Asia]]. Metal utensils, sacred statues and rice from Nepal, and textiles and other factory products from India were the main exports to Tibet. The Lhasa Newars brought back gold dust, wool, musk pods, pelts and yak tails which were forwarded to Kolkata.

Mule, donkey and yak caravans transported the trade goods over the Himalaya and across the Tibetan Plateau. In Nepal, porters carried the loads over the mountains on their backs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Hodgson| first = Brian Houghton| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://archive.org/details/essaysonlanguage00hodg| title = Essays on the Languages, Literature, and Religion of Nep√°l and Tibet | work = | publisher = London: Trubner &amp; Co| year=1874| accessdate = 1 November 2011}} Page 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trade route connecting India and Tibet goes over the Himalaya. The Lhasa Newars used the '''[[Zongga|Gyirong]]''' (Kyirong, [[Nepali language|Nepali]]: {{lang|ne|‡§ï‡•á‡§∞‡•Å‡§ô}}, {{transl|ne|''kerung''}})  and ''Kuti'' ([[Nepali language|Nepali]]: {{lang|ne|‡§ï‡•Å‡§§‡•Ä}}) ('''[[Nyalam Tong La]]''') passes to the north of Kathmandu to travel to Lhasa. From the 1930s, a new caravan route over the lower [[Nathu La]] and [[Jelep La]] passes on the border between Sikkim and Tibet became more popular. These passes were approached through [[Gangtok]] in Sikkim and [[Kalimpong]] in [[West Bengal]], India.

The Lhasa Newars lived in [[Lhasa]], [[Shigatse]] and [[Gyantse]] in Tibet and in [[Kolkata]] and Kalimpong in India for years at a time.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Sir Charles (1992), ''Tibet Past &amp; Present'', Motilal Banarsidass Publ. {{ISBN|978-81-208-1048-8}}.

A few business houses also maintained shops in [[Leh]], [[Ladakh]] which lies on the caravan route to [[Kashgar]] in Chinese Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tuladhar|first=Kamal Ratna|title=Long ago in Ladakh|url=http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2012/03/09/features/the-first-word--long-ago-in-ladakh/232460.html|accessdate=14 March 2012|newspaper=The Kathmandu Post|date=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kolkata was a center of wholesale trade.

==Art==
[[File:Kumbum eyes.jpg|thumb|Painted eyes and writing in Nepalese script below on the Kumbum Stupa in Gyantse.]]
Lhasa Newar artisans created statues, painted [[paubha]]s and frescoes and built temples in Tibet and other parts of Central Asia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Lo Bue| first = Erberto| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/33444121/Newar-Sculptors-and-Tibetan-Patrons-in-the-20th-Century| title = Newar Sculptors and Tibetan Patrons in the 20th Century| work =| publisher =Scribd| year=2011| accessdate = 1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were instrumental in the spread and development of Buddhist art throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lieberman|first=Marcia R.|title=The Artistry of the Newars|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/04/09/travel/the-artistry-of-the-newars.html|accessdate=1 November 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|publisher= |date=9 April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =| first =| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.tibetanart.com/NewarArt.asp| title =What is Newar Art?| work = Tibetan Buddhist &amp; Newar Tantric Art| publisher = | date=| accessdate = 31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jokhang]] Temple in Lhasa and the [[Kumbum]] Stupa in Gyantse are examples of their artistic legacy in Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Slusser| first =Mary Shepherd| authorlink = | coauthors = | url = http://www.asianart.com/articles/jokhang/index.html| title =The Lhasa gTsug lag khang ("Jokhang")| work = | publisher =Asianart.com| date=7 February 2006| accessdate = 31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Dagoba in [[Beijing]], [[China]], built by [[Arniko]] in the 13th century, is another specimen of the artistry of the Lhasa Newars.

Newar artists were the most sought after among the foreign artists living in Tibet. French missionary traveller [[√âvariste R√©gis Huc]] has written that it is they who construct for the Buddhist temples those fine roofs of gilt plates, which resist all the inclemencies of the seasons and always retain a marvellous freshness and glitter. They are so skilful at this class of work that they are sent to the very interior of Tartary to decorate the Lamaseries.&lt;ref&gt;√âvariste R√©gis Huc, Gabet (reprinted 2004), ''Travels in Tartary, Thibet and China, 1844-1846, Volume 2'', Routledge. {{ISBN|978-0-415-34484-5}}. Page 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newar artists gained importance after the destruction of Indian Buddhism in 1203 as they were the only remaining experts in traditional Buddhist art. Tibetan artists thus turned to them for inspiration and learned the Newar style, or Beri as it is now known. The style prevailed for more than four centuries, and reached its peak from 1360-1460 when it was adopted as Tibet's universal painting style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| url =http://rmanyc.org/exhibitions/view/682| title =The Nepalese Legacy in Tibetan Painting| work =| publisher =Rubin Museum of Art| year =| accessdate =16 November 2011| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20111120102024/http://www.rmanyc.org/exhibitions/view/682| archivedate =20 November 2011| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period from the 14th to the 16th centuries is considered a golden age of Nepalese art. During this time, Newar artists travelled widely and left their mark on the artistic styles of Tibet, Bhutan, [[China]] and Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| coauthors =| url =http://www.newarkmuseum.org/museum_pages.aspx?id=12506| title =From the Sacred Realm| work =| publisher =Newark Museum| year =2011| accessdate =16 November 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Lhasa Newars have been the subject of ballads, epic poetry and novels in [[Nepal Bhasa]] and other languages, mostly on the theme of loneliness and couples forced to endure long periods of separation.

* The best known epic is [[Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni (song)|Ji Waya La Lachhi Maduni]] ("It hasn't been a month since I came"), written in the late 18th century, about a trader who leaves for Tibet despite the pleas of his newly wedded wife. One day, a false message arrives that he has died in Tibet, and the wife burns herself on the funeral pyre in grief. Years later, the husband returns. Upon being told of her death, he goes away and becomes an ascetic.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. {{ISBN|81-208-0963-7}}. Page 84.&lt;/ref&gt; This poem was the source of "[[Muna Madan]]", a short epic story in the [[Nepali language]] composed by [[Laxmi Prasad Devkota]] in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Hutt, Michael (1991). ''Himalayan Voices: An Introduction to Modern Nepali Literature.'' University of California Press. {{ISBN|9780520070486}}.

* In the song "My beloved has gone abroad", a wife longs for her husband who has gone to Tibet on business. One day, she is elated to receive a message from Tibet, however, the message contains news of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. {{ISBN|81-208-0963-7}}. Page 59.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Another song, "Oh husband, how shall I live" was written towards the end of the 19th century. In this song, a woman expresses her sadness as her husband leaves for Tibet soon after their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Lienhard, Siegfried (1992). ''Songs of Nepal: An Anthology of Nevar Folksongs and Hymns.'' New Delhi: Motilal Banarsidas. {{ISBN|81-208-0963-7}}. Page 60.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Bhrikuti'', a novel by [[Dharma Ratna Yami]], was awarded the Shrestha Sirapa in 1959. Another novel ''Ang Lhamo'' recounts the saga of a Tibetan girl amid a backdrop of the Chinese entry into Tibet. The first edition, published in 1970 by Pasa Muna, was banned by the Nepalese government. A second edition appeared in 1992, published by Paleswan Pithana, Kathmandu.
* ''Mimmanahpau'' ("Unburnt Letter") by [[Chittadhar Hridaya]] is a novel in the form of a letter from a merchant in Lhasa to his wife in Kathmandu. The husband misses home so much that he regrets the life of a trader. Published in 1968, the novel has been translated into English by [[Kesar Lall]].&lt;ref&gt;Lall, Kesar (2002). ''Mimmanahpau: Letter from a Lhasa Merchant to his Wife by Chittadhar Hridaya.'' New Delhi: Robin Books. {{ISBN|81-87138-55-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the novel ''The Oriental Casebook of [[Sherlock Holmes]]'', the famed detective befriends Gorashar, a Newar merchant in Lhasa, and travels with him to Kathmandu during the course of his journeys in Asia to unravel varied mysteries.&lt;ref&gt;Riccardi, Ted (2003).

According to [[Thai folklore|local folklore]] the story is based on events that took place during the reign of [[Mongkut|King Rama IV]].&lt;ref name=BP-20160116&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yongcharoenchai|first1=Chaiyot|title=As cultures come together, it's all in bad spirits|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/special-reports/828500/as-cultures-come-together-it-all-in-bad-spirits|accessdate=19 January 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The legend==
The story is about a beautiful young woman named Nak, who lived on the banks of the Phra Khanong Canal, and her undying love for her husband, Mak.

With Nak pregnant, Mak is conscripted and sent to war (in some versions of the story the war is against the [[Shan people|Shan tribe]], while others are not specific), where he is seriously wounded. While he is being nursed back to health in central [[Bangkok]], Nak and their child both die during a difficult childbirth. When Mak returns home, however, he finds his loving wife and child waiting for him. Neighbors who try to warn him that he is living with a ghost are all killed.

One day, as Nak is preparing ''[[nam phrik]]'', she drops a [[Lime (fruit)|lime]] off the porch. In her haste to retrieve it, she stretches her arm to pick it up from the ground below. Mak sees it and at last realizes his wife is a ghost. Terrified, he tries to find a way to flee without alarming her. 

That night, Mak says he has to go downstairs to urinate. He then runs away into the night.

Discovering her husband has fled, Nak pursues him. Mak sees her and conceals himself behind a ''[[Blumea balsamifera]]'' ({{lang-th|‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏î}}; pronounced ''Nat'') bush.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thrai.sci.ku.ac.th/node/1049 ‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏î (Blumea balsamifera (L.) DC.)] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714185446/http://thrai.sci.ku.ac.th/node/1049 |date=2012-07-14 }} {{th icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to folklore, ghosts are afraid of the sticky ''Blumea'' leaves. Mak then runs to Wat Mahabut temple, which a ghost cannot enter, as it is holy ground. 

In her grief, Nak terrorizes the people of Phra Khanong, furious at them for causing Mak to leave her. However, Nak's ghost is captured by a powerful exorcist. Confining her in an earthen jar, he throws it into the canal.

There are differing versions of the rest of the story. In one, an old couple new to Phra Khanong finds the jar while fishing; in another two fishermen dredge up the jar. Nak is freed when they opened it.

Nak is conquered again by the venerable monk [[Somdej Toh|Somdet Phra Phutthachan (To Phrommarangsi)]]. The learned monk confines her spirit in the bone of her forehead and binds it in his waistband. Legend says the waistband is currently in the possession of the royal family. Admiral [[Abhakara Kiartivongse|Prince Abhakara Kiartivongse, Prince of Chumphon]], also claimed to have had the relic.&lt;ref&gt;‡πÄ‡∏à‡∏ô‡∏à‡∏ö ‡∏¢‡∏¥‡πà‡∏á‡∏™‡∏∏‡∏°‡∏•.

A shrine dedicated to Mae Nak is at Wat Mahabut. In 1997, the shrine was relocated to the nearby [[Suan Luang District]] of modern Bangkok.

==An alternative account==
Anek Nawikamul, a Thai historian, researched the story and found an article in the ''Siam Praphet'' newspaper written by K.S.R. Kularb, dated 10 March 10 1899. Kularb claimed the story of Mae Nak was based on the life of Amdaeng Nak (‡∏≠‡∏≥‡πÅ‡∏î‡∏á‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏Å, 'Mrs Nak'), daughter of a [[Tambon]] Phra Khanong leader named Khun Si. Amdaeng Nak died while she was pregnant. Her son, worried that his father might remarry and his inheritance shared with his step-mother, invented the ghost story. He dressed in women's clothing and threw rocks at passing boats to make people think Nak's ghost had done it. Kularb also suggested that Nak's husband was named ''Chum'', not Mak. No one knows how true this is, or even it was the same Nak, as it does not agree with the traditional tale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Legend of Mae Nak Prakanong|url=http://www.sarakadee.com/feature/1999/09/nang-nak.htm|website=Sarakadee|accessdate=19 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Thairath]]|language=Thai|first=‡∏Å‡∏¥‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏ô|last=‡∏õ‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏•‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÄ‡∏ä‡∏¥‡∏á|url=http://www.thairath.co.th/content/115908|title=‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏ú‡∏µ‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏Ñ|date=2010-10-04|accessdate=2017-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Mae Nak Shrine==
The shrine of Mae Nak stands next to Klong Phra Khanong, at Wat Mahabut, a large temple on Soi 77 off [[Sukhumvit Road]] (On Nut Road). The shrine is a low building under large trees with a roof that encompasses the tree trunks. The main shrine has several minor shrines around it.&lt;ref name=chart&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.manager.co.th/travel/viewnews.aspx?NewsID=9580000121184|work=Manager Online|author=‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏∏‡πà‡∏°‡∏•‡∏π‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏∏‡πà‡∏á|date=2015-10-30|title=‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡∏¢‡∏ß‡∏Æ‡∏≤‡πÇ‡∏•‡∏ß‡∏µ‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏ö‡∏ö‡πÑ‡∏ó‡∏¢‡πÜ ‡πÑ‡∏õ‡πÑ‡∏´‡∏ß‡πâ‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏û‡∏£ ‚Äú‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‚Äù ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡∏°‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏ö‡∏∏‡∏®‡∏¢‡πå|language=Thai|accessdate=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Offerings===
A statue of Mae Nak and her infant form the centerpiece of the shrine. Devotees often make offerings, accompanied by a request for help, generally by women seeking easy childbirth or for their husband to be exempted from military conscription.&lt;ref name=Thai/&gt;. Offerings are usually lengths of colored cloth, wrapped around the trunk of the [[Bo tree]]. Other offerings include fruit, [[Nelumbo nucifera|lotuses]], and incense sticks. 

Toys for her child and portraits of the ghost are displayed in the shrine's inner sanctum. A collection of fine dresses offered to her are displayed behind her statue.  

Offerings are also made at Phra Khanong Canal, where fish purchased live at markets are brought in buckets to the edge of the canal and freed. Stalls at the shrine sell toys, fish, lotus buds, incense sticks, and garlands for those who wish to make an offering.&lt;ref name=chart/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dek-d.com/board/view/2602542/|language=thai|work=dek-d.com|accessdate=2018-03-24|series=‡∏ï‡∏≥‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÇ‡∏Ç‡∏ô‡∏á |date=2012-10-13|author=No. 2602542|title=‡∏ú‡∏µ‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÇ‡∏Ç‡∏ô‡∏á ‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡πÉ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏£‡∏≠‡∏î‡∏à‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏Å‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏ì‡∏ë‡πå‡∏ó‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£ ‡∏´‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏¢‡∏Ñ‡∏ô‡∏ö‡∏≠‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏•‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ú‡∏µ‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏ä‡πà‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÑ‡∏î‡πâ‡∏à‡∏ô‡πÄ‡∏õ‡πá‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏µ‡πà‡πÄ‡∏•‡πà‡∏≤‡∏•‡∏∑‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ô‡∏ß‡πà‡∏≤‡∏ñ‡πâ‡∏≤‡πÑ‡∏°‡πà‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏≤‡∏Å‡πÄ‡∏õ‡πá‡∏ô‡∏ó‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏ï‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏õ‡∏Ç‡∏≠‡∏Å‡∏±‡∏ö‡∏ú‡∏µ‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏û‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÇ‡∏Ç‡∏ô‡∏á}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Thai|work=[[Pantip.com]]|date=2010-05-13|accessdate=2018-03-24|title=‡∏ñ‡∏≤‡∏°‡∏ó‡∏≤‡∏á‡πÑ‡∏õ‡∏ß‡∏±‡∏î‡πÅ‡∏°‡πà‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏Ñ‡∏´‡∏ô‡πà‡∏≠‡∏¢‡∏Ñ‡∏£‡∏±‡∏ö|url=http://topicstock.pantip.com/siam/topicstock/2007/05/F5405575/F5405575.html|author=hookman13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Thai&gt;{{cite web|work=Thairath|date=2016-02-14|accessdate=2018-03-24|title=‡∏õ‡∏≤‡∏è‡∏¥‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏¢‡πå‡πÅ‡∏´‡πà‡∏á‡∏£‡∏±‡∏Å.

==In popular culture==
Mae Nak's story has enjoyed sustained popularity because her undying devotion to her husband inspires people of all ages. [[Prince Damrong]], a son of King [[Mongkut]], revealed that when he was a child, he kept asking [[Wat Phra Kaeo]] visitors who was the most popular person in their opinion, and most people answered "Mae Nak".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.matichon.co.th/news/110826 | title = Pho Mak Thahan Ken? | script-title = ‡∏û‡πà‡∏≠‡∏°‡∏≤‡∏Å‡∏ó‡∏´‡∏≤‡∏£‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏ì‡∏ë‡πå | trans-title = Mister Mak Was a Recruit? | language = th | date = 2016-04-20 | accessdate = 2016-04-20 | location = Bangkok | publisher = Matichon }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2763">'''Mit√°kuye Oy√°s‚Äôi≈ã''' ('''All Are Related''') is a phrase from the [[Lakota language]].

The phrase translates in English as "all my relatives," "we are all related," or "all my relations."  It is a prayer of oneness and harmony with all forms of life: other people, animals, birds, insects, trees and plants, and even rocks, rivers, mountains and valleys.&lt;ref name=py/&gt;

In 1940, American scholar [[Joseph Epes Brown]] wrote a study of ''Mit√°kuye Oy√°s‚Äôi≈ã'' and its relevance in the [[Sioux]] ideology of "underlying connection" and "oneness." He noted how the phrase has been [[Cultural appropriation|misappropriated]] and misused as a slogan and salutation by peoples from outside the Lakota cultures.&lt;ref name=ja/&gt;

Francis White Bird asserts that only Lakota can use this phrase because it applies only to Lakota culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=White Bird|first1=Francis|title=Levels of Lakota language|url=http://www.lakotacountrytimes.com/common/PastArchives/1237.html|website=Lakota Country Times|publisher=Lakota Country Times|accessdate=25 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless it has become a sign of recognition by all peoples of native ancestry, especially those who are alienated from tribal tradition.

'''Nathan Adler''' (1741‚Äì1800) was a [[Jews of Germany|German]] [[kabbalist]] born in [[Frankfurt]], December 16, 1741.  As a precocious child he won the admiration of [[Chaim Joseph David Azulai]] (Chida), who, in 1752, came to Frankfurt to [[Halukka|solicit contributions for the poor]] of the [[Old Yishuv|Jewish communities]] in [[Eretz Yisrael]]. Adler attended the rabbinical school of [[Jacob Joshua]], author of ''Pene Yehoshua'', who was at that time rabbi at Frankfurt, but his principal teacher was [[Tevele Schiff|David Tevele Schiff]], afterward [[List of chief rabbis of the United Kingdom|chief rabbi of the United Kingdom]]. In 1761 he established a [[yeshivah]] himself, in which several prominent rabbis received their early teachings, notable among whom were [[Abraham Auerbach]], [[Abraham Bing]], rabbi in [[W√ºrzburg]],&lt;ref name=je/&gt; [[Sekl Loeb Wormser]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Scholem|first=Gershom|author-link=Gershom Scholem|encyclopedia=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|title=WORMSER, SECKEL|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0021_0_21110.html|access-date=Mar 17, 2015|year=2008|publisher=[[American‚ÄìIsraeli Cooperative Enterprise]]|publication-date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and especially [[Moses Sofer]] (Schreiber), rabbi in [[Presburg]].&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

Nathan Adler  devoted himself to the study of the [[Kabbalah|Kabbala]], and adopted the liturgical system of [[Isaac Luria]], assembling about himself a select community of kabbalistic adepts. He was one of the first Ashkenazim to adopt the [[Sephardi Hebrew|Sephardi pronunciation of Hebrew]], and gave hospitality to a Sephardi scholar for several months to ensure that he learnt that pronunciation accurately.  He prayed according to the [[History of the Jews in Syria#Aleppo|Halebi]] ritual, pronounced the priestly blessing every day, and in other ways approached the school of the [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]], who had at that time provoked the strongest censures on the part of the [[Talmudists]] of the old school. His followers claimed that he had performed miracles (Moses Sofer, ''·∏§atam Sofer, Ora·∏• ·∏§ayyim,'' 197), and turned visionaries themselves, frightening many persons with predictions of misfortunes which would befall them. Finally, the rabbis and congregational leaders intervened in 1779 and prohibited, under penalty of excommunication, the assemblies in Nathan Adler's house.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

Rabbi Nathan, however, paid no attention to these orders. He even excommunicated a man who had disregarded his orders, although this was contrary to the laws of the congregation. His doors remained open day and night, and he declared all his possessions to be common property, that thus he might prevent the punishment of those who might carry away by mistake anything with them. Moreover, he commanded Moses Sofer, who had quarreled with his father, never to speak to his parent again. When the same disciple reported to him that he had gone through the whole Talmud, he advised him to celebrate that event by a fast of three days.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

In spite of the continued conflict with the congregational authorities, the fame of Rabbi Nathan's piety and scholarship grew, and in 1782 he was elected rabbi of [[Boskowitz]] in [[Moravia]]. But his excessive and mystical piety having made enemies for him, he was forced to leave his congregation, and in 1785 returned to Frankfurt. As he still persisted in his former ways, the threat of excommunication was renewed in 1789, which act was not repealed until shortly before his death at Frankfurt on September 17, 1800. His wife, Rachel, daughter of Feist Cohen of [[Giessen]], survived him. He left no children, though [[Nathan Marcus Adler]], chief rabbi of London, was named after him.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

His mysticism seems to have been the cause of his repugnance to literary publications. The kabbalists claimed that real esoteric theology should never be published, but should only be orally transmitted to worthy disciples. In his copy of the [[Mishnah]] he wrote brief marginal notes, mostly cross-references. Some of them were collected and explained ingeniously by [[B. H. Auerbach]] under the title ''Mishnat Rabbi Natan''. One responsum is found among those of Moses Sofer on ''Yoreh De'ah,'' 261.&lt;ref name=je&gt;{{JewishEncyclopedia|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=A&amp;artid=828|title=Adler, Nathan|accessdate=Mar 17, 2015}}&lt;br /&gt;

{{quote box|width=22em|title=Quotation|quote=Madidastu Needu Bhikshe (Your reward will be as per your work), Kayakave Kailasa (Work is worship)}}
'''Nayakanahatti Thipperudra Swamy''', (c. 15th or 16th century),&lt;!--No evidence of date of birth --&gt; also referred as '''Tippeswamy''','''Thippeswamy''' or '''Thippeswami''', was an Indian Hindu spiritual Guru, and social reformer. He is revered by both his Hindu and Muslim devotees.

He preached that ''Kayakave Kailasa'' (Work is worship) and that ''Madidastu Needu Bhikshe'' (Your reward will be as per your work).

==Birth and Early life==

The details of his early life are not clearly documented. Though there are several legends and references to his origins and early life before arrival at Nayakanahatti (also spelled as Nayakanahatty), they are mostly constrained to oral history.

The date of his birth, place of birth and details of his parents or siblings are not known.

As for the time period of the Guru‚Äôs life in [[Nayakanahatti]]; the [http://www.karnatakatemplesyatra.kar.nic.in/homepage/index.jsp Temple Information System website] of the Hindu Religious Institutions &amp; Charitable endowments Department (Government of [[Karnataka]]) mentions a rough time period between the 15th and the 16th century, possibly 1570 - 1646 AD.

==Purpose of life==

Legend has it that Thipperudraswamy was an incarnation of one of the five Ganadheeswaras (Pancha Ganadheeshwara), who originally spread [[Shaivism]] (Worship of Shiva) as they were ordered by Lord [[Shiva]] himself. These five Gurus were reincarnated across various places in India at various periods of time, with an intention to spread Shiva Dharma in that specific area.

During Sri Guru Thipperudraswamy‚Äôs times, the other four Ganadheeshwaras were reincarnated as Sri Vrishabhendra Swamy of Sarasipur ([[Kottur]]), Sri Kolashanteshwara of [[Arasikere]], Sri Kempaiah Swamy of Harapura ([[Harpanahalli]]) and Sri Maddanaswamy of [[Kulahalli]].

Thipperudra Swamy‚Äôs purpose of life was to spread the word of Dharma and provide guidance and solace to fellow human beings.

==The legend behind the origins of his name ‚Äì Thippeswamy or Thipperudraswamy.==

The Guru‚Äôs original name was Rudraswamy. During the course of his travels across Southern India, he met one of the other reincarnated Ganadheeshwaras, Sri Kempaiah Swamy, who had forgotten his original purpose of life and was caught up in the mundane pleasures, problems and desires of human life.

With the intent to enlighten Kempaiah Swamy, Rudraswamy sat in meditation on a big mound of refuse and cow dung (referred to as ‚ÄòThippe‚Äô in the local languages). This foul smelling mound was intended to be composted for use as a fertilizer in the fields and such mounds can be seen even today in the fields of rural India.

Since the ‚ÄòThippe‚Äô was along the path that Kempaiah had to take to reach his fields, he could not help but notice the divine looking Sadhu seated on the foul heap of refuse. Slowly other passersby too noticed this Sadhu and began referring to him as ‚ÄòThippe‚Äô swamy ‚Äì the Swamy who was seated on the mound.
Though the locals started to stop by to pay their respects and leave food and other offerings for the meditating Sadhu, he continued to sit in silence for many days, undisturbed by the Sun, the Wind and the Rain.

Eventually, Kempaiah walked up to the seated Guru, paid his respects and was wondering as to why the Guru was seated on this mound of refuse, when there were plenty of shady trees around or caves in the nearby hills where the Swamy could have meditated.

Rudraswamy then opened his eyes and revealed his identity to Kempaiah. He stated that even though he was seated on the mound of refuse, he was not letting the smell or the dirt affect his senses and he continued with his original purpose of meditating on Shiva.

Kempaiah realized the [[allegory]] wherein he had been distracted from his original purpose of life by the pains and pleasures of normal human life and he remembered his true identity and purpose. Eventually Kempaiah Swamy let go of his worldly pursuits and went on to become the Sri Guru Kempaiah Swamy of Harapura ([[Harpanahalli]]).

==Arrival at Nayakanahatti==

Nayakanahatti is a small town located 35&amp;nbsp;km from the District headquarters, Chitradurga. Its original name was Nishadapura, however it slowly came to be referred as ‚ÄòNayakana Hatti‚Äô ‚Äì The Leader‚Äôs place; after Sri Guru Thipperudraswamy took up residence there.

One of the Guru‚Äôs early disciples, a trader named Phaniyappa, requested Thipperudraswamy to visit his town, Nishadapura. When Thipperudraswamy arrived, he wished to stay at the temple of a local deity.

As per legend, the local deity refused to allow the Guru to enter the temple and the doors could not be opened. Realizing the background, Thipperudraswamy prayed to the deity that though he could not stay in the temple premises, he should at least be allowed to keep his ‚ÄòBetta‚Äô (Walking stick) and ‚ÄòJolige‚Äô (Shoulder bag) in the temple for safekeeping, as they were his only essential worldly possessions.

The doors of the temple could then be opened and the Guru left his Betta and Jolige inside and walked away. Overnight the two objects expanded to become so large that they pushed out the statue of the local deity, who then left the place. The temple became the residence of the Guru Thipperudraswamy, who installed a [[Shivalinga]] there.

While the above legend can be discounted as a local myth, since the Guru Thipperudraswamy was spreading the worship of Shiva, at some point in his lifetime, the popularity of the previous local deity [[Mariamma]] seems to have waned and her temple were converted into the current Nayakanahatti Shiva temple.

==Teachings and Philosophy==

While Sri Guru Thipperudraswamy preached the worship of Shiva, the highlight of his teachings and philosophy seem to be the importance he gave to work.
He preached and practiced ‚ÄòKayakave Kailasa‚Äô ‚Äì work is worship. During his lifetime, apart from his religious work, he was also instrumental in the creation and expansion of water reservoirs around Nayakanahatti, some of which continue to store and provide water in the drought prone region.

He also preached ‚ÄòMadidastu Needu Bhikshe‚Äô (Your reward will be as per your work), whereby he paid men and women equal wages for their work on the reservoirs. He also started a custom of paying one and a half times the wages for any pregnant ladies working on the projects; with the logic that even the unborn child was involved in the effort and should be paid at least half the normal wages.

==Claimed miracles==

===Bringing a dead Buffalo back to life===

When the Guru was still new in Nayakanahatti, there was a noble widow in the village, with two young children. Her only source of income to feed her family was from selling the milk of a [[water buffalo]] she owned.  Even on days when she could not earn enough, she would not seek help from others. Preferring to go hungry and give her children water to try and quell their hunger.

One day, the buffalo fell ill and died. Without any other source of income and too self-respecting to beg help from anyone, she contemplated committing suicide along with her children, by jumping into a deep well. The next evening, she was walking towards a well outside the town along with her children who were excited to be going on a trip with their mother, blissfully unaware that this would be their last walk.

On the way, she encountered Guru Sri Thipperudraswamy sitting in discussion under a tree, with a group of people from the village. She stopped briefly to pay respect to the Guru and was turning around to continue on her journey.

The Guru called out to her and said ‚ÄúWe are feeling very hungry and thirsty sitting here all day, go and get us a pitcher of milk from your buffalo.‚Äù 
With a tear in her eye, the lady replied that her buffalo had died the previous day.

The Guru rebuked her with a smile and said ‚ÄúWhat do you mean the buffalo has died? It is hale and hearty and can give enough milk for your family and also for all of us. Don‚Äôt waste time, go quickly and fetch the milk.‚Äù

When the widow walked back to her house, she found the buffalo in full health and from that day onwards, the widow and her children did not face any paucity of food.

The episode is used to indicate that if you persist in the right path through difficult times, the Guru appreciates your efforts and you will be rewarded.

===Curing Hyder Ali's son Tipu Sultan===

When [[Hyder Ali]]‚Äôs son Sultan Sayyid was severely ill as a child and could not be cured for a long time, [[Hyder Ali]], who then happened to be engaged in the assault on the nearby [[Chitradurga fort]], prayed for his recovery at Thipperudraswamy‚Äôs [[Samadhi]].

When Sultan Sayyid eventually recovered, a grateful Hyder Ali had a structure built around the Guru‚Äôs Samadhi. The [[Indo-Saracenic]] style tomb existing on the Samadhi stands as a symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity; and is revered by believers from both religions.

The legend also mentions that [[Hyder Ali]] added the word 'Thippu' to Sultan Sayyid's name in honor Thipperudraswamy; and the boy was called 'Thippu Sultan' who would eventually go on to become the famous [[Tipu Sultan]].

While it is a historical fact that Hyder Ali donated various articles to the Nayakanahatti Temple and he got the structure constructed on the Guru's Samadhi, the part of the legend about how Tipu Sultan got his name may be contested as it is generally believed that Sultan Sayyid was called 'Tipu' after the saint Tipu Mastan Aulia of [[Arcot]].

===Construction of the water reservoir at Nayakanahatti===

When a severe drought hit the region around Nayakanahatti, the local farmers could do nothing but sit idle. With every passing week, their stores of grain and food diminished and even their cattle started to die due to lack of fodder and water.

Guru Sri Thipperudraswamy realized that there had to be a short-term fix and a long-term solution for the problem on hand. People immediately needed some regular work to earn a living till the rains arrived. Also, there was a need to store water from the rains and the small seasonal streams, to be used during the dry periods.

The Guru then requested the local [[Palegar]] (Administrator) to build a water reservoir in Nayakanahatti. Due to the drought, even the tax collections had fallen drastically and the Palegar expressed his inability to fund the reservoir construction. The Guru then assured the Palegar that if he could get the construction of the reservoir started, he would take care of the payments to the workers.

With the Guru‚Äôs blessings, a suitable location was finalized and the construction began in earnest. At the end of the first day, the Guru asked the laborers to make small mounds of earth. He then proceeded to touch each mound with his ‚ÄòBetta‚Äô ‚Äì walking stick.

When the workers dug up the mounds they had made, they found [[Gold]], [[Silver]] or [[Copper]] coins commensurate with the work that they had done during the day.

This miracle continued every evening for several months and the people of Nayakanahatti and the surrounding villages could earn enough to feed themselves and their families.

Some unscrupulous men tried to take advantage of the Guru‚Äôs largess by arriving just before the day ended, mingling with the crowd of workers and building their own mounds of earth. However, miraculously, only the people who actually worked on the reservoir would find the coins. The Guru had noticed this and proclaimed Madidastu Needu Bhikshe (Your reward will be as per your work).

When a woman working on the project found one and a half times the normal sum she was expecting, she mentioned this to the Guru that she had been paid more. The Guru then told the lady that she was pregnant and since her unborn child was also toiling with her on the project, it was but fair that the child too should get at least half the amount as would be paid to an adult worker.

The Nayakanahatti reservoir is still in use and continues to provide water for drinking and irrigation in the region.

==Jeeva [[Samadhi]]==

On Chitra [[nakshatra]] [[Phalguna]] [[Bahula]] day as per the [[Hindu Calendar]], Thipperudraswamy is said to have been entered Jeeva [[Samadhi]], i.e. he was buried alive as per his wishes. There is a temple car - [http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/rathotsava-draws-devotees/article1560260.ece Rathothsava festival] organized every year in the memory of the famous saint, which is attended by [http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/Lakhs-Throng-Nayakanahatti-Car-Fest/2015/03/10/article2706595.ece [[lakh]]s of people] from across [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]].

==The [[Temples]] or [[Matha]]'s of Nayakanahatti==

There are three Matha‚Äôs or Temples in Nayakanahatti.

===Olamatha or inner Matha also called Darbar Matha===

[[File:Nayakanahatti temple olamatha.jpg|thumb|The Olamatha - Nayakanahatti Shiva temple]]

The Olamatha, also referred to as Hirematha or Darbarmatha is the focal point of Nayakanahatti. It was the primary residence of the Guru Thipperudraswamy and he would normally entertain visitors here.

This structure was originally a temple of a local deity Maramma. After the Guru took up residence here, a Shivaling was installed here, converting it into a Shiva temple.

The temple has 18 stone pillars with various carvings and elegantly designed stone roof. The ‚ÄòRajagopura‚Äô at the entrance was added at a later date and is said to be around 200 years old.

===Horamatha or the outer Matha===

[[File:Nayakanahatti temple horamatha.jpg|thumb|The Horamatha, where Thipperudraswamy took up Jeeva Samadhi]]

The Horamatha, located in the outskirts of the town has the Jeeva Samadhi of the Guru Thipperudraswamy.

The Horamatha was originally built by Raja Bhichchugatti Bharamanna, the ruler [[Palegar]] of [[Chitradurga]] in the year 1721 AD. Subsequent additions were made to the Horamatha, including the [[Indo-Saracenic]] structure added by Hyder Ali.

The Sanctum of the temple is covered with a dome that is typically seen in Islamic structures such as [[Mosque]]s or [[Dargah]]s. The rest of the temple is built like a typical Hindu structure. This temple is therefore considered to be a symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity and visited by believers from both religions.

===Ekantha Matha===

The Ekantha matha, also called the Ekanthaswamy matha is located at a distance of 3 Kilometers from the Olamatha, on the route leading towards Challakere. This was a small place where the Guru would retreat for penance.

==A unique custom of burning dry coconut==
[[File:Nayakanahatti burnt coconut.jpg|thumb|Coconut Kernel (Copra) being burnt in an open metal tub at the Nayakanahatti temple.]]
A unique custom that is practiced in the Nayakanahatti temple is to burn dry coconut meat ([[copra]]) and consuming a portion of it as a 'prasad' - holy offering. The custom is attributed to Guru Thipperudraswamy's liking for the burnt coconut.

Local experts believe that the custom may have been originally started to burn dry [[coconut]] husks (Instead of the dried coconut meat, as it is done now.) over an enclosed low fire, which would then become [[activated charcoal]]. This activated charcoal was consumed by the devotees for its medicinal and purifying properties.

During the annual Jathra days, thousands of devotees would arrive at Nayakanahatti, leading to sanitation issues and there would be a general increase in caes of [[diarrhea]], [[indigestion]], [[food poisoning]] and [[flatulence]]. Activated charcoal may be an effective remedy for such cases.

Over the centuries, the purpose and reasons behind the old custom was forgotten and today devotees burn copra over a fire outside the temple as [[prasad]].

==In culture==

===Film and television===

Shree Guru Thipperudraswamy has been the subject of a full-length feature film in Kannada language.

[[File:Nayakanahatti chariot.jpg|thumb|The Temple Chariot at Nayakanahatti]]
An annual Jatra (Fair and Festival) and Rathotsava (Chariot festival) are held annually in Nayakanahatti, over a period of three to eight days in the Hindu calendar month of [[Phalguna]].

[[Lakhs]] of people from across [[Karnataka]], [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]] arrive to participate in the festivities.

The highlight of the festival is the [[Rathothsava]], where the wooden [[temple car]] is pulled by thousands of devotees through a predetermined route.

{{Odinani infobox}}
'''Odinani ''' ({{Lang-ig|·ªçÃÄd·ªãÃÄn√†n·ªãÃÄ}}) comprises the traditional religious practices and cultural beliefs of the [[Igbo people]] of southern [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="ndc"&gt;Afulezy, Uju [http://www.nigerdeltacongress.com/oarticles/on_odinani_the_igbo_religion.htm "On Odinani, the Igbo Religion"], ''Niger Delta Congress'', Nigeria, April 03, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Odinani has [[monotheism|monotheistic]] and [[panentheism|panentheistic]] attributes, having a single [[God]] as the source of all things. Although a pantheon of spirits exists, these are lesser spirits prevalent in Odinani expressly serving as elements of Chineke (or [[Chukwu]]), the supreme being or high god.&lt;ref name="kwenu-odinani"&gt;M. O. En√© [https://web.archive.org/web/20020819010001/http://www.kwenu.com/odinani/odinani.htm "The fundamentals of Odinani"], ''KWENU: Our Culture, Our Future'', April 03, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Chineke is a compound word encompassing the concept of ''ch√≠'' is the creator (''n√†'') is a verb meaning 'that' while  ''√©k√®'' means create. Chineke therefore means the Creator or the God that created all things. The concept of ''Ch√∫kw√∫'' ('supreme chi') was largely propagated by the [[Aro people|Aro-Igbo]] of [[Arochukwu]] in eastern [[Igboland]] who wielded much spiritual force over the eastern [[Niger Delta]] in the 18th century due to their operating of the [[Ibini Ukpabi]] oracle.

Lesser spirits known as ''√°gb√†r√†'' or ''√°l√∫s√≠'' operate below the high god Chineke and are parts of him divided by gender in his mind. These spirits represent natural forces; agbara as a divine force manifests as separate alusi in the Igbo pantheon. A concept of 'the eye of sun or god' (''√°ny√° √°nw·ª•ÃÅ'') exists as a feminine solar deity which forms a part of the solar veneration among the [[Nri-Igbo]] in northern Igboland. Alusi are mediated by ''dibia'' and other priests who do not contact the high god directly. Through ''√°f√†'', 'divination', the laws and demands of the alusi are communicated to the living. Alusi are venerated in community shrines around roadsides and forests while smaller shrines are located in the household for ancestral veneration. Deceased ancestors live in the spirit world where they can be contacted. Below the alusi are minor and more general spirits known as ''mm√∫·ªç'' loosely defined by their perceived malevolent or benign natures. These minor spirits are not venerated and are sometimes considered the lost souls of the dead.

The number of people practicing Igbo religion decreased drastically in the 20th century with the influx of Christian missionaries under the auspices of the British colonial government of Nigeria. In some cases Igbo traditional religion was syncretised with Christianity, but in many cases indigenous rites were demonised by Christian missionaries who pointed out the practice of [[human sacrifice]] and some other cultural practices that were illegal under the colonial government. Earlier missionaries referred to many indigenous religious practices as ''juju''. Igbo religion is most present today in harvest ceremonies such as [[New Yam Festival of the Igbo|new yam festival]] (''·ªãÃÅw√° j√≠'') and masquerading traditions such as mmanwu and [[Egbo|Ekpe]].

Remnants of Igbo religious rites spread among African descendants in the Caribbean and North America in era of the [[Igbo people in the Atlantic slave trade|Atlantic slave trade]]. Igbo ''·ªçÃÅb·ªãÃÄ√†'' was transferred to the former [[British Caribbean]] and [[Guyana]] as [[obeah]] and aspects of Igbo masquerading traditions can be found among the festivals of the [[Garifuna people]] and [[jonkonnu]] of the British Caribbean and [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite dictionary|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obeah |title=Obeah |publisher=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam Webster]] |accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Murder at Montpelier: Igbo Africans in Virginia |first=Douglas B. |last=Chambers |publisher=Univ.

== Etymology ==
''Odinani'' in northern Igbo dialects is the compound of the words ''·ªçÃÄ d·ªãÃÄ'' ('located') + ''n'' (''n√†'', 'within') + ''√†n·ªãÃÄ'' (the one god) [consisting of anu (E nu) above (the heavens) and Ana, below (the earth)].&lt;ref name="kwenu-odinani" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Chigekwu G. |last=Ogbuene |title=The concept of man in Igbo myths |publisher=Peter Lang |page=207 |year=1999 |isbn=0820447048}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="echema2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=Austin |last=Echema |title=Igbo Funeral Rites Today: Anthropological and Theological Perspectives |publisher=LIT Verlag M√ºnster |pages=21, 48 |location=footnotes |year=2010 |isbn=3643104197 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GbhrqpWxRI4C&amp;pg=PA48 |access-date=2015-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other dialectal variants include ''odinala'', ''odinana'', ''omenala'', ''omenana'', and ''omenani''.&lt;ref name="echema2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Sylvester |last=Okwunodu Ogbechie |title=Ben Enwonwu: the making of an African modernist |page=161 |publisher=University Rochester Press |year=2008 |isbn=1580462359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word odinani and all its variations is also associated with the culture and customary laws of the Igbo people. Many of the laws and culture were counterparts with religion such as taboos and laws concerning sacred spaces like a deities sacred forest. Since customary law is recognised in Nigeria, many in Igbo society find themselves syncretising these beliefs with other beliefs and religions.

==Beliefs==
[[File:-Remains of Long Juju Gorge, Arochuku-, late 19th century (imp-cswc-GB-237-CSWC47-LS2-041).jpg|thumb|alt=Magic lantern Image of the entrance to the cave of the Ibini Ukpabi oracle at [[Arochukwu]].|Entrance to the cave of the [[Ibini Ukpabi]] oracle at [[Arochukwu]], 1900s.]]
Odinani could loosely be described as a [[monotheism|monotheistic]] and [[panentheism|panentheistic]] faith with a strong central spiritual force at its head from  which all things are believed to spring; however, the contextual diversity of the system may encompass theistic perspectives that derive from a variety of beliefs held within the religion.&lt;ref name="echema2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ikenga International Journal of African Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yAcOAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=26 July 2013|year=1972|publisher=Institute of African Studies, University of Nigeria.|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Peter Chiehi·ª•ra |last=Uzor |title=The traditional African concept of God and the Christian concept of God: Chukwu b·ª• nd·ª•-- God is life, the Igbo perspective |publisher=Peter Lang |page=194 |year=2004 |isbn=3631521456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Cosmas Okechukwu |last=Obiego |title=African Image of the Ultimate Reality: An Analysis of Igbo Ideas of Life and Death in Relation to Chukwu-God |publisher=Peter Lang |page=88 |year=1984 |isbn=3820474609}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Charles A. |last=Ebelebe |title=Africa and the New Face of Mission: A Critical Assessment of the Legacy of the Irish Spiritans Among the Igbo of Southeastern Nigeria |publisher=Univiversity Press of America |page=24 |year=2009 |isbn=0761845968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;Benjamin Ray says of the position of African religions: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;But as we have seen, there are other elements [besides monotheistic ones] which tend towards polytheism or pantheism. What, we may ask, accounts for these different tendencies? As Evans-Pritchard and Peel suggest, they do not derive so much from different observers' standpoints as from the different standpoints within the religious systems themselves This, of course, does not mean that African religions consist of conflicting ‚Äúsystems‚Äù (monotheism, polytheism, pantheism, totemism), which lack any inherent unity. Rather, the totality of elements in each religious system can be viewed from different internal perspectives according to different contextual alignments. What is misleading is to seize upon one perspective or tendency and make it the dominant framework. This may satisfy the observer's own theological preferences, e.g., monotheism, but only at the expense of over-systematizing the contextual diversity of African religious thought.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The other ontological category consists of ''ndi mmadu'', 'visible beings', which include ''√°n·ª•ÃÅ'' animals, ''√≥s√≠s√≠'' plants, and the final class ''√πr√≤'' which consists of elements, minerals and inanimate beings.&lt;ref name="agbadiere"&gt;{{cite book |first=Joseph Th√©r√®se |last=Agbasiere |title=Women in Igbo Life and Thought |publisher=Psychology Press |pages=48‚Äì64 |year=2000 |isbn=0415227038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chukwu as the creator of everything visible and invisible and the source of lesser divinities is also referred to as Chineke. Chukwu is genderless&lt;ref name="cole1982"&gt;{{cite book |first=Herbert M. |last=Cole |title=Mbari: Art and the Life Among the Owerri Igbo |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1982 |isbn=0253303974}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is reached through various spiritual forces mainly under the spirit class of Alusi who are incarnations of the high god; no sacrifices, however, are given to Chukwu and no shrines and altars are erected for him.&lt;ref name="agbadiere"/&gt; If an Arushi is assigned to an individual, it becomes a chi, a personal guardian god. The chi manifests as mmuo, spirits, and as a persons spirit is earth bound it chooses sex, type, and lifespan before incarnation in the human world.&lt;ref name="wiredu"/&gt;

===Chi===
[[File:Chi shrine.jpg|thumb|alt=An interior photograph of a chi shrine with plates inset into the polished mud walls|Interior of a chi shrine at Nkarahia, southern Igboland, 1900s.]]
Chi is the personal spirit of a person ''·∏øm√∫·ªçÃÅ'', in Igbo culture it is this spirit which determines destiny. Hence the saying, ''onye kwe, Chi ya ekwe'' ("If a person agrees to a thing, his spirit agrees also"). Culturally, people are seen as the creators or makers of their own destiny.&lt;ref name="wiredu"&gt;{{cite book |first=Kwesi |last=Wiredu |title=A Companion to African Philosophy |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |page=420 |year=2008 |isbn= 0470997370}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Molefi K. |last1=Asante |first2=Emeka |last2=Nwadiora |title=Spear Masters: An Introduction to African Religion |publisher=University Press of America |page=108 |year=2007 |isbn=0761835741 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QS3Y93DBe4QC&amp;pg=PA108 |access-date=2015-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="okoh2012"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Okoh |title=Fostering Christian Faith in Schools and Christian Communities Through Igbo Traditional Values: Towards a Holistic Approach to Christian Religious Education and Catechesis in Igboland (Nigeria) |publisher=LIT Verlag M√ºnster |pages=37, 58 |year=2012 |isbn=3643901682 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=04VwpwD7R_AC&amp;pg=PA37 |access-date=2015-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The breath of life is in the heart, ''√≥b√¨''.&lt;ref name="okoh2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="udeani2007"&gt;{{cite book |first=Chibueze C. |last=Udeani |title=Inculturation as Dialogue: Igbo Culture and the Message of Christ |publisher=Rodopi |page=35 |year=2007 |isbn=9042022299 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VGjKp-7FyGIC&amp;pg=PA35 |access-date=2015-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ndukaihe2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=Vernantius Emeka |last=Ndukaihe |title=Achievement as Value in the Igbo/African Identity: The Ethics |publisher=LIT Verlag M√ºnster |pages=185‚Äì187 |year=2006 |isbn=3825899292 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ERM77W_wgZYC&amp;pg=PA187 |access-date=2015-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="uzukwu2012"&gt;{{cite book |first=Elochukwu Eugene |last=Uzukwu |title=God, Spirit, and Human Wholeness: Appropriating Faith and Culture in West African Style |publisher=Wipf and Stock |pages=63, 123 |year=2012 |isbn=1610971906 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HPdMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |access-date=2015-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chi refers to the light and the day in contrast to the dark. The universal ''chi'' indirectly in charge of everything is Chukwu who is the supreme being that is beyond the limits of time and space. Chukwu's name is a compound of the words ''ch√≠'' + ''√∫kw√∫'' ('great in size, supreme').&lt;ref name="agbadiere"/&gt; Chi is believed to be a spiritual connection between an individual and the high god and it dictates the trajectory of a person's spiritual journey on earth.

Amaury |last=Talbot |title=Some Beliefs of To-day and Yesterday (Niger-Delta Tribes.) |journal=Journal of the Royal African Society |volume=15 |issue=60 |date=July 1916 |pages=307‚Äì308 |publisher=The Royal African Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high god, Chukwu, is believed to assign chi before and at the time of an individuals birth. It is a guardian spirit providing care, guardianship, and providence, in this respect, the concept of chi is analogous to the concept of a [[guardian angel]] in Christianity, the [[Daemon (classical mythology)|daemon]] in [[ancient Greek religion]], and the [[Genius (mythology)|genius]] in [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]].&lt;ref name="agbadiere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="udeani2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ndukaihe2006"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Damian Ugwutikiri |last=Opata |title=Essays on Igbo World View |publisher=AP Express Publishers |page=62 |year=1998 |isbn=9782001155}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Chukwu who is genderless, chi can be masculine. A dibia can identify a person‚Äôs chi through divination (''√°f√†'') and advise adherents of ways to placate it. Chukwu is also referred to as Chineke which is a compound of the words ''ch√≠'' the divine masculine force and ''√©k√®'' the creative and divisive feminine force. Eke came out of the hands of Chi but are considered one; Chi created the world while Eke divided it incorporating a divisive trickster energy that introduced death and suffering.&lt;ref name="cole1982"/&gt; ''Chineke'' is also interpreted as ''ch√≠ ne k√©'', 'chi the creatrix', and ''ch√≠ nne √©k√©'', 'chi the creative mother'.&lt;ref name="Talbot1916"/&gt; Eke is ones ancestral guardian spirit. Chineke or Chukwu is high up away at the periphery of human life and remains a mystery to the people.&lt;ref name="cole1982"/&gt;  Households usually contain a chi shrine which could be focused on a tree. In marriage a woman takes her chi shrine along with all her belongings to her matrimonial home.&lt;ref name="agbadiere"/&gt; Around Nkarahia, in southern Igboland, there are the most elaborate chi shrines which are decorated with colourful china plates inset into the clay walls of the chi shrine building; the altars hold sacred emblems, while the polished mud benches hold offerings of china, glass, [[manillas]], and food.&lt;ref name="Talbot1916"/&gt; As a marker of personal fortune or misfortune, good acts or ill, chi can be described as a focal point for 'personal religion'.&lt;ref name="agbadiere"/&gt;

===Cosmology===
The community of visible interacting beings and the cosmos is referred to as ''·ª•ÃÄw√†'', which includes all living things ''√≠h·∫πÃÅ ndi d·ªãÃÅ ≈Ñd·ª•ÃÄ'', including animals and vegetation and their mineral elements which possess a vital force and are regarded as counterparts to invisible forces in the spirit world.&lt;ref name="agbadiere"/&gt; These living things and geomorphological features of the world therefore possess a guardian deity. Igbo cosmology presents a balance between the feminine and masculine, perhaps, with a preponderance of female representation in Igbo lore.&lt;ref name="agbadiere"/&gt; In Igbo cosmology, the world was divided into four corners by the high god corresponding to ''√®k√©'' ''√≥r√¨√®'' ''√†f·ªçÃÄ'' ''«πkw·ªçÃÅ'' which are the days of the week in the [[Igbo calendar]] regarded as market days.&lt;ref name="ukaegbu"&gt;{{cite journal |first=J·ªçn ·ªåf·ªçegbu |last=·ª§kaegbu |title=Igbo Identity and Personality Vis-√†-vis Igbo Cultural Symbols |publisher=Pontifical University of Salamanca |page=60 |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Israel |last1=Anyahuru |first2=Tom |last2=Ohiaraumunna |title=Musical Sense and Musical Meaning: An Indigenous African Perception |publisher=Rozenberg Publishers |page=56 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The universe is regarded as a composite of bounded spaces in an overlapping hemispherical structure, the total spaces are referred to as ''√©l√∫ n√† √†l√†''.&lt;ref name="agbadiere"/&gt; In one Igbo cosmological theory reported by W.R.G. Morton in the 1950s from an elder in Ibagwa Nike in northern Igboland, Chukwu sees that the sun travels across the world in the day time and then cuts into two in order for the moon to pass on a perpendicular route, and so the world is divided into four parts and four days.&lt;ref name="ukaegbu"/&gt; The quarterly division of the earth and the days makes the number four sacred (''≈Ñs·ªçÃÅ'') to the Igbo.&lt;ref name="ukaegbu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="morton"&gt;{{cite journal |first=W.

===Justice===
{{main article|Ogu na Ofo}}
Ofo and ogu is a law of [[retributive justice]]. It vindicates anyone that is wrongly accused of a crime as long as their "hands are clean". It is only a person who is on the righteous side of ''Ogu-na-Ofo'' that can call its name in prayer, otherwise such a person will face the wrath of Amadioha (the god of thunder and lightning).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Christopher I. |last=Ejizu |title=Ofo: Igbo Ritual Symbol |publisher=Fourth Dimension Publishers |year=1986 |isbn=9781562684}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kola nut]] is used in ceremonies honour Chukwu, chi, Arushi and ancestors and is used as a method of professing innocence when coupled with libations. The Igbo often make clay altars and shrines of their deities which are sometimes [[anthropomorphic]], the most popular example being the wooden statues of Ikenga. Typically, only men are allowed to make representational figures of supernatural forces.&lt;ref&gt;T. Phillips (ed.)

The Igbo have traditionally believed in [[reincarnation]], ''ilo-uwa''. People are believed to reincarnate into families that they were part of while alive.&lt;ref name="nnam2007"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nkuzi Michael |last=Nnam |title=Colonial Mentality in Africa |publisher=Hamilton Books |pages=69‚Äì70 |year=2007 |isbn=1461626307}}&lt;/ref&gt; People can usually reincarnate seven times, giving seven opportunities to enter the spirit world successfully as an ancestor. The person's cycle number on earth is unknown to them. Unlike in [[Hinduism]], humans can only reincarnate as humans.&lt;ref name="nnam2007"/&gt; Families hire fortune tellers to reveal the ancestral identity of the child in their former life, the baby is sometimes named after this relative.&lt;ref name="nnam2007"/&gt; The personality of the ancestor is not identical to the child's but rather the concept establishes a vital relationship with the child and characteristics of the ancestor.&lt;ref name="udoye"&gt;{{cite book|first=Edwin Anaegboka |last=Udoye |title=Resolving the Prevailing Conflicts Between Christianity and African (Igbo) Traditional Religion Through Inculturation |publisher=LIT Verlag M√ºnster |pages=45‚Äì53, 104 |year=2011 |isbn=364390116X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before a relative dies, it is said that the soon to be deceased relative sometimes give clues of who they will reincarnate as in the family. Once a child is born, he or she is believed to give signs of who they have reincarnated from. This can be through behaviour, physical traits and statements by the child. A diviner can help in detecting who the child has reincarnated from. It is considered an insult if a male is said to have reincarnated as a female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ancestors |first=William Hare |last=Newell |pages= 293‚Äì294 |isbn=90-279-7859-X |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1976 |chapter=Ancestoride!

====Ogbanje====
{{Main article|Ogbanje}}
An ogbanje is a reincarnating [[evil spirit]] that would deliberately plague a family with misfortune. In folklore, the ogbanje upon being born by the mother, under a certain amount of time (usually before [[puberty]]), would deliberately die and then come back and repeat the cycle, causing the family grief. This time period varies between minutes, hours, days and years. [[Igbo culture#Female circumcision|Female circumcision]] was sometimes thought to get rid of the evil spirit, whereas finding the evil spirits ''[[Iyi-uwa]]'', which they have dug somewhere secret, would ensure the ogbanje would never plague the family with misfortune again. The ''Iyi-uwa'' is a stone that the ogbanje's way of coming back to the world and also a way of finding its targeted family. The stone is deep enough to not have been planted physically by a child. The iyi-uwa is dug out by a priest and destroyed. Furthermore, female ogbanje die during pregnancies along with the baby, male ogbanje die before the birth of a wife's baby or the baby dies. The child is confirmed to no longer be an ogbanje after the destruction of the stone or after they successfully give birth to another baby.&lt;ref name="nnam2007"/&gt;

==Deities==

[[File:Pottery shrine piece, Ibo - African objects in the American Museum of Natural History - DSC05998.JPG|thumb|alt=An image of a pottery piece depicting three people seated representing the Igbo deity Ifejioku|Shrine representation of the alusi [[Ahia Njoku|Ifejioku]].]]

Chukwu's incarnations and ministers in the world (''·ª•ÃÄw√†'') are the [[Alusi]], supernatural forces that regulate human life. In southern Igbo dialects especially, √°gb√†r√† is the term for these forces. The alusi are regarded as channels to Chukwu. The alusi, who are also known as ''arushi'', ''anusi'', or ''arusi'' in differing dialects all spring from Ala the earth spirit who embodies the workings of the world. There are lesser alusi in Odinani, each of whom are responsible for a specific aspect of nature or abstract concept. According to Igbo belief, these lesser alusi, as elements of Chukwu, have their own specific purpose.&lt;ref name="Ilogu"&gt;{{cite book|title=Christianity and Ibo culture |first=Edmund |last=Ilogu |pages=34‚Äì36 |publisher=Brill |year=1974 |isbn=90-04-04021-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alusi manifest in natural elements and their shrines are usually found in forests in which they are based around specific trees. At shrines, ''√≠h√∫ mm√∫·ªçÃÅ'', an object such as a hung piece of cloth or a group of statues are placed at an alusi's group of trees to focus worship. Deities are described as 'hot' and often capricious so that much of the public approach shrines cautiously and are advised to avoid them at most times, priests are entrusted in the maintenance of most shrines.&lt;ref name="cole1982"/&gt; Many of these shrines are by the roadside in rural areas. Tender palm fronds symbolise spiritual power and are objects of sacralisation, shrines are cordoned off with omu to caution the public of the deities presence.&lt;ref name="kalu"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jacob K. |last1=Olupona |first2=Sulayman S. |last2=Nyang |first3=Ogbu U. |last3=Kalu |title=Religious Plurality in Africa: Essays in Honour of John S.

Other alusi figures may be found in and around peoples homes and the shrines of dibia, much of these are related to personal chi, cults, and ancestral worship.

Ala is at the head of the Igbo pantheon, maintaining order and carrying out justice against wrongdoers. Ala is the most prominent and worshipped alusi,&lt;ref name="udoye"/&gt; almost every Igbo village has a shrine dedicated to her called ''√≠h√∫ Ala'' where major decisions are taken.&lt;ref name="agbadiere"/&gt; Ala is believed to be involved in all aspects of human affairs including festivals and at offerings.

They are usually consulted at the shrine of a communities major deity. ''Dibia'' is a compound of the words ''di'' ('professional, master, husband') + ''·ªçÃÅb·ªãÃÄ√†'' ('doctoring, sciences').&lt;ref name="eltis"/&gt; The dibia are believed to be destined for spiritual work. The dibia sees the spiritual world at any time and interprets what messages being sent and sees the spiritual problems of living people. They are given the power by the spirit world to identify any alusi by name and the possible ways of placating and negotiating with the deity. Dibia are thought to be revealed to possess the power over one of three elements namely water (and large bodies of water), fire and vegetation. Dibia whose elements are vegetation can go on to become herbalists by their supposed instinctual knowledge of the health benefits of certain plants they are instinctually drawn to, fire element dibia can handle fire unscathed during their initiation, and water element dibia do not drown. Dibia can partially enter the spirit world and communicate this by rubbing chalk on one half of their face.&lt;ref name="udoye"/&gt; Dibia and obia practices were transported to the British Caribbean during the slave trade and became known as [[obeah]].&lt;ref name="rucker"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eltis"/&gt;

====Afa divination====
The name of divination in Igbo derives from ''√≠gb√° √°f√†'' or ''√°h√†'' meaning 'to name' coming from the diviners skill in rooting out problems hence naming them.&lt;ref name="achebe2011"&gt;{{cite book |first=Nwando |last=Achebe |title=The Female King of Colonial Nigeria: Ahebi Ugbabe |publisher=Indiana University Press |pages=54‚Äì55 |year=2011 |isbn=0253222486}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dibia or ''ogba afa'', 'interpreter of afa', is considered a master of esoteric knowledge and wisdom and igba afa is a way in which people can find out the cause of such things as misfortunes. The diviner interprets codes from ''√†l√† mmu·ªç'' the unseen by throwing divination seeds, cowries, and beads,&lt;ref name="achebe2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iroegbu2010"&gt;{{cite book |first=Patrick E. |last=Iroegbu |title=Healing Insanity: A Study of Igbo Medicine in Contemporary Nigeria |publisher=Xlibris Corporation |pages=344‚Äì346 |year=2010 |isbn=1450096298}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} or observing a divination board sometimes called ''osho'' which can be used in pronouncing curses on the evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Jude C.

Animals that are special in divination and sacrifice include a white he-goat, a white ram, a tortoise and male wall gecko. These animals are prized for their rarity, price and therefore the journey taken to obtain. Chameleons and rats are used for more stronger medicines and deadly poisons, and antidotes can include lambs, small chickens, eggs, and oils.&lt;ref name="agbadiere"/&gt; Nzu is used in rites from birth to death and is used to mark sacred buildings and spaces.&lt;ref name="agbadiere"/&gt; Agwu Nsi is the Igbo patron deity of health and divination and is related to insanity, confusion, and unusual human behaviour which is linked to possession of Agwu by the diviner.&lt;ref name="nwaorgu2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Iroegbu2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Patrick |last1=Iroegbu |first2=Christine E. |last2=Gottschalk-Batschkus |editor-first=Joy C. |editor-last=Green |title=Handbook of ethnotherapies |chapter=Igbo Medicine Practitioners and Ways of Healing Insanity in Southeastern Nigeria |publisher=BoD ‚Äì Books on Demand |page=157 |year=2002 |isbn=3831141843 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hyR_dqdZ5SQC&amp;pg=PA157 |access-date=2015-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Damian Ugwutikiri |last=Opata |title=Ajija: an Igbo agent of death and destruction |publisher=Great AP Express |page=28 |year=2009 |isbn=9788087744}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agwu can be manifested by other alusi so that there could be images of a divination Ikenga or ''Ikenga Agwu'' for instance.&lt;ref name="Iroegbu2010"/&gt;

===Ancestral veneration===
[[File:Igbo male figure.jpg|thumb|alt=An image of a brown wooden standing male figure partially painted with large black, yellow and white pigment, figure is in an exhibition case on a green background|A male ancestral figure.]]

The patriarchal head of the household is in charge of venerating the patriarchal ancestors through libations and offerings, through this the living maintain contact with the dead.

At the funeral of a mans father there is a hierarchy in Igbo culture of animals that will be killed and eaten in his honor. Usually this depended on the rarity and price of the animal, so a goat or a sheep were common and relatively cheaper, and therefore carried less prestige, while a cow is considered a great honor, and a horse the most exceptional. Horses cannot be given for women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Simon |last=Ottenberg |title=Igbo Religion, Social Life, and Other Essays |publisher=Africa World Press |page=348 |editor=Toyin Falola |year=2006 |isbn=1592214436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horses were more common among the northeastern Igbo due to [[tsetse fly]] zone that Igboland is situated in and renders it an unsuitable climate for horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Clive |last=Spinage |title=African Ecology: Benchmarks and Historical Perspectives |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |page=932 |year=2012 |isbn= 3642228712}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ian |last=Williams |title=Riding in Africa |year=2005 |publisher=Ian Williams |page=30 |isbn= 0595373011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Horse heads are traditionally decorated and kept in a reliquary and at shrines.

A number of major masking institutions exist around Igboland that honour ancestors and reflect the spirit world in the land of the living. Young women, for example, are incarnated in the society through the [[agbogho mmuo|√†gb·ªçÃÅgh·ªçÃÄ mm√∫·ªçÃÅ]] masking tradition in which mean represent ideal and benevolent spirits of maidens of the spirit world in the form of feminine masks.

====Mbari====
[[File:RAAI 645.3 (2).jpg|thumb|alt=An image of modelled figure in an mbari house|Scene in an mbari house, 1904.]]
Among a small area of the Urata-Igbo cultural area, near [[Owerri]], there is a tradition of building votive monument houses called ''·∏øb√†r√≠'' primarily dedicated to the ''√°gb√†r√†'' √Äl√† specific to the community and sometimes other community deities. The name joins the word ''·∏øb√†'' ('nation, town, society') + ''r√≠'' ('eat') in reference to the 'festival of life' held after its completion. These votive shrines are typically designed with four columns and a central volt, around the columns are modelled deities, spirits, and depictions of human life, the entire building built out of clay from termite mounds symbolically named ''j√≠'' ('yam') by the initiated spirit workers called ''≈Ñd√≠ mÃÄgb√®''. Ndi mgbe are secluded from the community for a couple of months during the rites of building the mbari to a deity. Mbari are requested by a deity who the diviner tells the community feels neglected and cannot feel pride in the face of other deities in the spirit world. A string of unusual and unfortunate events befalling the community is linked to the aggrieved deity. An mbari is commissioned and artists are chosen. After the completion of the mbari the spirit workers are reincorporated into the community and a feast is held for the opening of the mbari house where elders and the community come to exhibit the critique the expensive mbari. The mbari house is not a source of worship and is left to dilapidate, being reabsorbed by nature in symbolic sense related to Ala.&lt;ref name="cole1982"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mabri: Art as Process in Igboland |first=Herbert M. |last=Cole |url=http://africa.uima.uiowa.edu/topic-essays/show/14 |publisher=University of Iowa Museum of Art |access-date=2015-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
Before the twentieth century, circular stepped pyramids were built in reverence of Ala at the town of [[Nsude]] in northern Igboland. In total ten clay/mud pyramidal structures were still existing in 1935. The base section of a pyramid was 60&amp;nbsp;ft. in circumference and 3&amp;nbsp;ft. in height. The next stack was 45&amp;nbsp;ft. in circumference. Circular stacks continued, till it reached the top. The structures were temples for the god Ala/Uto who was believed to live at the top.  A stick was placed at the top to represent the god's residence.  The structures were laid in groups of five parallel to each other. Because it was built of clay/mud like the Deffufa of Nubia, time has taken its toll requiring periodic reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;Basden, G. S(1966). ''Among the Ibos of Nigeria, 1912.''

The '''One Australia Movement''' was a minor Australian political party that was active from 1986 to 1992. It was formally registered on 3 October 1986, having been founded earlier that year by [[Uniting Church of Australia|Uniting Church]] minister Cedric Jacobs. The party's policies included support for the [[Australian monarchy|monarchy]], a biblical system of morality, immigration reform and social security reform, and opposition to union strike movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaensch|first=Dean|authorlink=Dean Jaensch|last2=Mathieson|first2=David|year=1998|title=A Plague on Both Your Houses: Minor Parties in Australia|publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin]]|page=68|isbn=1-86448-421-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After unsuccessfully contesting the [[Australian federal election, 1987|1987 federal election]], running for the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] in [[Western Australia]], the party did not contest the [[Australian federal election, 1990|1990 federal election]] and was deregistered due to lack of members on 21 October 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[Australian Electoral Commission]].

In [[Scientology]], '''Operating [[Thetan]]''' ('''OT''') is a [[spirituality|spiritual]] state above [[Clear (Scientology)|Clear]]. It is defined as "knowing and willing cause over [[life]], [[thought]], [[matter]], [[energy]], [[space]] and [[time]] ([[MEST (Scientology)|MEST]])."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auditing.org/13-ot.htm The State of Operating Thetan] (Church of Scientology)&lt;/ref&gt; According to religious scholar [[J. Gordon Melton]], "[i]t's basically a variation of the [[Gnostic]] myth about souls falling into matter and the encumbrances that come with that".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Verini |first=James |date=2005-06-28 |title=Missionary Man: Tom Cruise and the Church of Scientology |work=[[Salon.com]] |publisher=[[Spiegel Online]] |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,362731,00.html |accessdate=2008-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Scientology doctrine defines OT as the "highest state there is." The OT is able to "control or operate thought, life, matter, energy, space, and time" whether he or she has a body and mind or not.&lt;ref&gt;''Technical Dictionary of Dianetics and Scientology''; L. Ron Hubbard; Bridge Publications; {{ISBN|0-88404-037-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070212000316/http://www.scientology.org/p_jpg/gloss.htm The Official Scientology and Dianetics Glossary] definition of pre-OT levels; accessed 2008-02-03 ([http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/glossary2.html mirror] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021202215/http://www.rehabilitatenz.co.nz/pages/glossary2.html |date=2007-10-21 }})&lt;/ref&gt; The state of Operating Thetan is represented by a symbol consisting of the letters OT with the T inside the O and each of the points of the T ending at the O's circumference, evoking not only the level's initials but also the medieval [[O-T map]] representing the known world and, metaphorically, the entirety of the observable universe, over which a fully developed OT is believed to have immediate control. Operating Thetan is a state of godliness in Scientology teaching, a state "in which one is ‚Äòat cause‚Äô over the confines of matter, energy, space and time [[MEST(Scientology)|(MEST)]]."&lt;ref name="Westbrook 2017"&gt;{{cite book |last=Westbrook |first=Donald A. |editor1-last=Lewis |editor1-first=James R. |editor2-last=Hellesoy |editor2-first=Kjersti |year=2017 |title=Handbook of Scientology |chapter=Researching Scientology and Scientologists in the United States: Methods and Conclusions |volume=Brill Handbooks on Contemporary Religion |publisher=Brill |isbn=9789004330542}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard also claimed that an Operating Thetan would be considered "beyond God." Scholar Hugh B. Urban writes that according to Hubbard, "the thetan has been deceived into worshiping such a god by mainstream religion and so forgotten its own godlike power to create and destroy universes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Urban |first=Hugh B. |year=2011 |title=The Church of Scientology: A History of a New Religion |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691146089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After having removed one's own ''[[reactive mind]]'' and thus attaining the state of Clear, Scientologists may then go on to the OT levels.&lt;ref name=wischart&gt;[http://www.whatisscientology.org/html/Part02/Chp06/pg0181_1.html www.whatisscientology.org], Grade chart of Scientology courses, training and processing&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Tampa Bay Times]], the Church claims that the OT is not dependent on the universe around him. Scientologists that are Operating Thetan claim that they have control over their lives and can "go exterior" from their bodies. The Church of Scientology claims that an OT is able to operate independently of his or her body. While there are 15 levels listed in Scientology teaching, the Church only offers eight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=31 December 2009|title=Climbing The Bridge: A journey to 'Operating Thetan' |website=tampabay.com |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/scientology/climbing-the-bridge-a-journey-to-operating-thetan/1062094 |accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[L. Ron Hubbard]], as scholar Donald A. Westbrook writes, the universe is in existence because of the "continual co-creation of omnipotent thetans" who work with each other in unison. Therefore, becoming an Operating Thetan as Scientology teaches "is to rediscover this true nature and recover unlimited spiritual potential, despite the encumbrances of the physical universe that were unwittingly created by thetans in the first place."&lt;ref name="Westbrook 2017"/&gt;

==Levels==

===OT I===
"This Solo-audited level is the first step a Clear takes toward full OT abilities, and that first step is a fresh causative OT viewpoint of the [[MEST (Scientology)|MEST]] universe and other beings."&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;''What is Scientology'' compiled by the staff of Church of Scientology International. c1998 published Bridge Publications Inc. {{ISBN|1-57318-078-5}} pg. 840-841&lt;/ref&gt; The cost to move to level OT I is $2,750.&lt;ref name=amicomau&gt;{{cite web |title=Chapter 7 OT -- Through the Wall of Fire and Beyond |work=The OT Levels |url=http://www.ami.com.au/~bradw/cos/Wakefield/us-07.html |accessdate=12 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228115311/http://www.ami.com.au/~bradw/cos/Wakefield/us-07.html |archive-date=28 December 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OT II===
"By confronting hidden areas of one's existence on the whole track [that is, by confronting past incarnations], vast amounts of energy and attention are released. Those on this Solo-audited level experience a resurgence of self-determinism and native ability. OT II unlocks the aberrative factors on the whole track that have allowed the thetan to lose his innate freedom and ability and one achieves the ability to confront the whole track."&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt; The cost to move from OT I to OT II is $5,225.&lt;ref name="amicomau"/&gt;

===OT III: The Wall of Fire===
{{main|Xenu}}
Hubbard announced discovering an important breakthrough within less than a month of founding the [[Sea Org]], the religious order of the church that consists of its most dedicated members. He described it as a "means of erasing those mental factors that stand in the way of peace and toleration of mankind." The new material made up the new Operating Thetan III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lewis |first=James R. |year=2009 |title=[[Scientology (James R. Lewis book)|Scientology]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-533149-4 |page=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"This Solo-audited level goes through what is called the 'Wall of Fire' that surrounds a previously impenetrable whole track mystery. What prevents a being from being himself? This level answers that question. Once complete, a being is free of the whole track overwhelm that has trapped him. Here he confronts and eradicates the fourth dynamic engram that has plagued this universe for millennia."&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt; The cost to move from OT II to OT III is $8,910.&lt;ref name="amicomau"/&gt;

Church dogma regards OT III as a dangerous process which can lead to [[pneumonia]], to lack of sleep or even to death if not run correctly. In ''Church of Scientology of California v. Kaufman'', it was noted that the defendant had been required to sign a waiver to the effect that "the Scientology Organization, its branches and members, and L. Ron Hubbard are not responsible for anything that might happen to my body or mind on OT III".&lt;ref&gt;''Church of Scientology of California v. Kaufman'', [1972] F.S.R. 591 per Goff J - in the Chancery Division of the High Court&lt;/ref&gt;

Within OT III is the secret doctrine of the church. Members must be invited to "do it", and they sign a contract of secrecy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lewis |first1=James R. |last2=Petersen |first2=Jesper |year=2014 |title=Controversial New Religions |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199315321 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=G93HAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257&amp;dq=scientology+beliefs#v=onepage&amp;q=scientology%20beliefs&amp;f=false |accessdate=2017-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OT IV: OT Drug Rundown===
"This level handles the hidden problems and stops in a being's universe caused by the effects of drugs and poisons on the whole track. This is the final polish that rids one of any last vestige of the effects of drugs on the spirit. Ministered at Advanced Organizations or [[Flag Building|Flag]]. Approximately 12¬Ω to 25 hours."&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt;

===OT V: New Era Dianetics for OTs===
"The Second Wall of Fire consists of 26 separate [[rundown (Scientology)|rundowns]] and has been described as dealing with 'living lightning, the very stuff of life itself.' This level addresses the last aspects of one's case that can prevent him from achieving total freedom on all dynamics. An audited level ministered at Advanced Organizations or [[Flag Building|Flag]]. Approximately 50 hours."&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt;

===OT VI: Hubbard Solo New Era Dianetics for OTs (Solo NOTs) Auditing Course===
"The training one receives before starting to solo audit on New OT VII is so powerful that it actually constitutes an entire OT level. On Solo NOTs one is dealing with complexities intended to crush one's true power and abilities as a thetan. Solo NOTs auditors acquire a wide range of auditing skills to handle the vast phenomena that can occur on OT VIII. Approximately 3‚Äì4 weeks with the new Solo Auditor Course done."&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt;

===OT VII: Hubbard Solo New Era Dianetics for OTs Auditing===
"On New OT VII one solo audits at home daily. This is a lengthy level, requiring a considerable amount of time to complete. It is the final pre-OT level, and culminates in attainment of the state of CAUSE OVER LIFE."&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt;

===OT VIII: Truth Revealed===
{{main|OT VIII}}
OT VIII, the highest level in Scientology is offered only aboard the [[Freewinds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Contemporary Ordered Religious Community: The Sea Org Organization |journal=The Journal of CESNUR |year=2018 |last=Melton |first=J. Gordon |volume=2 |issue=2 |issn=2532-2990 |accessdate=2018-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "This Solo-audited level addresses the primary cause of amnesia on the whole track and lets one see the truth of his own existence. This is the first actual OT level and brings about a resurgence of power and native abilities for the being himself. This may be done at the Flag Ship Service Organization."

==Beyond Operating Thetan==
Beyond the attainment of the state of Operating Thetan is that of [[Supernatural abilities in Scientology doctrine#Cleared Theta Clear|Cleared Theta Clear]], which Hubbard describes as such:
{{Quote|A thetan who is completely rehabilitated and can do everything a thetan should do, such as move [[MEST (Scientology)|MEST]] and control others from a distance, or create his own universe; a person who is able to create his own universe or, living in the MEST universe is able to create illusions perceivable by others at will, to handle MEST universe objects without mechanical means and to have and feel no need of bodies or even the MEST universe to keep himself and his friends interested in existence.|L. Ron Hubbard|Scientology 8-8008, p. 114 (1st ed), p. 151 (1990 ed.)}}

==Criticism==
A growing number of former Scientologists have made public allegations that the church encourages its members to complete very expensive courses and expect wonderful results; when the improvements fail to be realized, further courses are then promoted to facilitate the anticipated changes.  Criticism stems from a pattern of cycles wherein members continue to pay increasing amounts for these courses, while some even put their families into debt chasing the elusive life-changing results under the stewardship of the church.&lt;ref&gt;Atack, Jon [1990] ''A Piece of Blue Sky'', Carol Pub. Group, Chap 3, {{ISBN|0-8184-0499-X}}  http://www.xenu.net/archive/books/apobs/bs1-3.htm{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal issues and copyright===
In March 2008 [[WikiLeaks]] leaked the [[Church of Scientology]]'s ''Operating Thetan'' documents.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikinews:Church of Scientology's 'Operating Thetan' documents leaked online]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology portrayed hosting the documentation as a copyright violation implying that the collection is Church doctrine. A court found that it was legal to download, use, read, and practice these teachings outside the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Metz |first=Cade |date=8 April 2008 |title=Scientology threatens Wikileaks with injunction |work=The Register |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/08/church_of_scientology_contacts_wikileaks/ |accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 [[Scientology and the Internet#Notable legal actions|Zenon Panoussis]], a resident of Sweden, sent copies of NOTs documents to various government authorities, thereby making the documents public according to the Swedish principle of public access to official records. The Church of Scientology responded by ordering members to continuously borrow the available copies in order to prevent non-members from reading them. The Church of Scientology also sued Panoussis for copyright infringement, since he had made the documents available online without permission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Macavinta |first=Courtney

The '''Padhar''' ({{lang-sd|Ÿæ⁄å⁄ô}}) are a [[Hindu]] [[caste]] found in the state of [[Gujarat]] in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Three edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 1054-1060&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==
The Padhar are distributed in six villages in Surandarnagar and four villages in [[Ahmedabad district|Ahmadabad District]]. Their main villages are Shahpur, Sahiyal, Dharji, Devadthal, Nam Katechi, Ranagadh, Ralal, Parali, Parnala, Godi and Anandpur. They claim to have originated in [[Sindh]], and their existence is due to the grace of Hinglaj mata, a [[Hindu]] goddess. The Padhar have been given [[scheduled tribe]] status, and speak [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. According to some traditions, they were originally [[Koli people]], although this claim is denied by the Kolis.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Three edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 1054-1060&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The Padhar community consists of a number of clans, each of which are exogamous. Their main clans are the Domda, Bhuwatra, Samatiya, Pachani, Devthala, Lalni, Tanhada, Sapra, Kanotra, and Dharjiya. The Vatra, Pachani and Lalni clans do not intermarry, as they descend from common ancestor. They are strictly endogamous, and are a not share her daughter with dalit community. The Padhar are mainly small scale peasant farmer, with many are now landless. Many Padhar are fishermen, as their villages lie on the shores of Nal Sarovar lake. Other occupations include grass cutting, root digging which they sell to neighbouring villages. As the Nal Sarovar lake attracts tourists, many also rent out their boats to the tourists. They are also known for their folk dance form [[Padhar dance]].and they are not married her daughter with dalit.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Gujarat Volume XXI  Part  Three edited by R.B Lal, P.B.S.V Padmanabham, G Krishnan &amp; M Azeez Mohideen pages 1054-1060&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Political theology in sub-Saharan Africa''' deals with the relationship of [[theology]] and [[politics]] born from and/or specific to the circumstances of the region. Arising from the [[internal resistance to apartheid|anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa]] and [[nationalism|nationalist]] campaigns of the mid to late twentieth century elsewhere, the increasing numbers of [[Christianity|Christians]] in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] has led to an increased interest in Christian responses to the region's continuing issues of [[poverty]], [[Christianity and violence|violence]], and [[war]].{{sfn|Katongole|2010|pp=1‚Äì4, 22‚Äì23}} According to the Cameroonian theologian and sociologist [[Jean Marc Ela|Jean-Marc √âla]], [[Christianity in Africa|African Christianity]] "has to be formulated from the struggles of our people, from their joys, from their pains, from their hopes and from their frustrations today."{{sfn|Stinton|2004|p=25}} [[African theology]] is heavily influenced by [[liberation theology]], global [[black theology]], and [[postcolonial theology]].

== Hermeneutics ==
Much of African [[political theology]] owes to distinctively African readings of the [[Bible]]. African theologians [[biblical hermeneutics|interpret the Bible]] through the lens the African experience, [[oppression]] and [[poverty]] being frequent themes.

[[Itumeleng Mosala]] argues that the Bible itself must be understood has having arisen from the ideology of its compilers and that an uncritical acceptance of the Bible as the word of [[God in Christianity|God]] leads to a notion that it has no ideology itself. Mosala says that this idea is wrong and that the Bible's compilation makes it inherently ideological, reflecting that of its compilers, and that the ideology it presents is harmful to [[colonization|colonized]] peoples.{{sfn|Farisani|2010|p=510}} Mosala, like several others, also includes [[Marxist schools of thought|Marxist]] elements in his reading of the Bible.{{sfn|Copeland|2004|pp=280‚Äì283}}

The Tswana theologian [[Musa Dube]] employs a "[[decolonization|decolonizing]] feminist biblical practice" she calls "[[Rahab]]'s reading prism."{{sfn|Copeland|2004|pp=280‚Äì283}} Named for the prostitute who protected Israelite spies who came to investigate [[Battle of Jericho|Jericho]] before it was besieged by the Israelite army. Dube says her prism highlights "the historical fact of colonizing and decolonizing communities inhabiting the feminist space of liberation practice." She argues for a new reading of the Bible by colonized peoples in order to create new narratives that speak of equity and freedom. For her, the interests of the decolonizing project are a part of the [[feminism|feminist]] agenda.{{sfn|Kwok|2005|p=82}}

For some, the biblical text may be disregarded in favour of perceived direction from the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]].{{sfn|Abraham|2015|p=145}}

== Themes ==
Arising out of the distinctive African [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]], several themes are common among African theologians as concerns for a [[Christianity|Christian]] response in the [[public sphere]].

=== Christology ===
{{see also|Liberation theology}}
[[Jesse Mugambi|Jesse N. K. Mugambi]] and [[Laurenti Magesa]] have written that "theology is not Christian at all when it does not offer [[Jesus|Jesus Christ of Nazareth]] as the answer to the human quest", including [[politics]].{{sfn|Mugambi|Magesa|1989|p=x}} For many African theologians, Jesus is seen as a liberating figure, including liberation from inequality, oppression, and poverty in opposition to what [[Jean-Marc √âla]] identifies as a "Babylonian captivity" of Christianity to [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Latin]] philosophies and [[Christology|Christologies]] that do not relate to the African experience. Among these are the image of an "imperial" Christ used to justify oppression and a "slave-trader" Christ used to promote faith in a distant salvation rather than earthly liberation. √âla's use of the terms "imperial" and "slave-holder" in reference to Jesus are not literal but serve to show the effects of traditional readings which serve to keep subjugated peoples from attempting to free themselves out of a belief that a distant salvation will come.{{sfn|Stinton|2004|pp=192‚Äì205}}

=== Equality ===
Having been subjected and treated as less than human, African theologians seek to validate their humanity on par with that of others. For example, Ananias Mpunzi writes that "we have the task both of affirming the humanity of others and helping them to affirm it for themselves."{{sfn|Mpunzi|1974|p=131}}

=== Church and state ===
Though religious leaders like [[South Africa]]'s [[Desmond Tutu]] play important roles in several African states as public commentators on moral issues, only [[Zambia]] has declared itself to be officially a Christian nation. The Ugandan Catholic priest [[Emmanuel Katongole (theologian)|Emmanuel Katongole]] has written that the Christian gospel is deeply political and that the most urgent task for Christianity is to make politics work better, become more democratic and transparent, thus promoting stability and encouraging development.{{sfn|Katongole|2010|pp=1‚Äì4, 22‚Äì23}} √âla calls on the church to be the link between revelation and history, or to push for political change, shaping the world of today rather than waiting for an otherworldly salvation.{{sfn|Katongole|2010|pp=22‚Äì23}}

=== Reconciliation ===
{{see also|Reconciliation theology}}
After decades of colonial rule and mismanagement by postcolonial governments, many Africans became embittered. According to Emmanuel Katongole, Christianity must engage with that past in order to move forward. Opinions on how that is to be done vary. Katongole sees the way forward in overcoming tribal divisions, forgiveness, and working together, something he sees Christianity uniquely capable of doing.{{sfn|Katongole|2010|pp=1‚Äì4, 22‚Äì23}} Willa Boesek, on the other hand, writing shortly after the end of South African [[apartheid]] encouraged a righteous anger that could lead to change but differentiated it from hate-filled rage. He admonished victims to control their anger, urging them to not indict all white people for the oppression. At the same time, he urged white South African churches to help their members overcome their fear of blacks and to not expect immediate reconciliation. Bitterness, anger, and aggression were natural consequences of the situation in South Africa, he believed, "a kind of unnatural 'Christian' patience and reasonableness ''vis-√†-vis'' this history is not Christian at all, but a distorted ethos of submissiveness forced upon oppressed people".{{sfn|Copeland|2004|p=277}} Others, like Desmond Tutu in his [[Ubuntu theology]], press for a peaceful reconciliation.{{sfn|Battle|2009}}

=== Land, resources, and poverty ===
Under [[colonialism]], Africa's land and resources were expropriated by white settlers and colonial agents, leaving the indigenous inhabitants with little of the continent's wealth. The issue of land restoration and redistribution are common topics for African theologians in the postcolonial era. An oft-repeated refrain from the missionary enterprise is that white people came to Africa with the Bible and the people had the land. The white missionaries taught the people to pray and when they opened their eyes, the Africans had the Bible and the whites had the land.{{sfn|Copeland|2004|pp=280‚Äì283}} Boesak encouraged white churches in South Africa to examine their role in the historical appropriation of black land.{{sfn|Copeland|2004|p=277}} Itumeleng Mosala addresses land and poverty in his reading of the [[Book of Micah]], emphasizing the sin of Israel in neglecting the poor.{{sfn|Copeland|2004|pp=280‚Äì283}}

== Criticisms ==
As a [[contextual theology]], African political theology lacks universality. It has been criticized it for being provisional, tentative, halting, and imprecise. Shawn Copeland points out an insufficiently rigorous analysis of [[imperialism]], [[capitalism]], and [[democracy]]. She identifies gaps in the discussions within [[African theology]], specifically noting that a lack of theological critique in Zimbabwe and Nigeria "mock the rhetoric of [[black theology]] as public theology and further distort the church's ministerial [[praxis (process)|praxis]]."{{sfn|Copeland|2004|pp=280‚Äì283}}

'''PƒÅ≈õa''' ({{lang-sa|‡§™‡§æ‡§∂|pƒÅ≈õa}}, lit. "bondage", "fetter") is one of the three main components considered in [[Shaivism]]. It is defined as whole of the existence, manifest and unmanifest.&lt;ref&gt;Sivaya Subramuniyaswami, (2002), How to Become a Hindu: A Guide for Seekers and Born Hindus, Motilal Banarsidass Publ.,p.392, {{ISBN|9788120818118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[Shaiva Siddhanta]], Pati (the supreme being), Pashu ([[ƒÄtman (Hinduism)|atman]]s) and Pasha are eternal, self-consistent, neither distinguishable nor indivisible triad in the nature.&lt;ref&gt;Sujith Ravindran, (2010), MATURE MASCULINITY: Man's Inner Essence, p.35, {{ISBN|1456317784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tither==
The Shaivite three components are easily understandable as pashu (litt. cow), pasha (litt. rope) and pati (litt. cow-herd). All atmans or pashus are eternally tethered by pasha and they don't know their destination. There comes pati to rear them towards the [[Moksha]]. This pati differ from ordinary cowherd as he doesn't obtain any advantages either by growing or shepherding cattle. And pashus cannot realize anything with their limited movement caused by pasha.

In [[Hindu temple architecture]], a '''ratha''' is a facet or vertical offset projection on the plan of the sanctum and [[shikhara]] above, or other structure.  It is generally carried up from the bottom of the temple to the superstructure.&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tourism.oriyaonline.com/temple_architecture.html|title=Orissa Tourism - Temple Architecture of Orissa, Temples of Orissa, Orissa Temples,Architecture of Temples of Orissa,Oriya Culture,Temple Tours of Orissa,Orissa Tourism - tourism.oriyaonline.com|work=oriyaonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The corners of each ratha touch notional circles on the plan of the temple, centred on the [[murti]] image in the sanctum.  The sides are oriented along the main horizontal axis of the temple (normally running east-west) or at right angles to it, generating (except around the entrance to the sanctum) a multi-faceted plan that harmonizes the square and the circle, becoming more circular in overall shape as the number of rathas increases.   

In [[Sanskrit]], the word "ratha" means "cart" or "chariot", but the link with this meaning is not clear. A [[ratha]], meaning cart, is also the temple chariot used for processing the murti at festivals, and a "ratha temple" is one designed to resemble a cart, with wheels on the sides, and often horses. The most famous example is the [[Sun Temple, Konarak]].&lt;ref&gt;Harle, 252&lt;/ref&gt; 

The rathas (facets) are decorated with geometric figures or statues, such as statues of a gatekeeper watching outside or a niche with a statue of a deity.  Sometimes, the facet of the ratha is hollowed to the interior; these are rathas with recesses. If there is only one facet, this is a temple with three rathas (triratha): the wall and the facet on the left and on the right.

If there are a main facet and a secondary one, the temple has five rathas ([[pancharatha]]). There are also temples with seven rathas ([[saptaratha]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Architecture|title=Architecture|work=banglapedia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spiritualvedicnames.com/saptaratha/|title=Saptaratha|work=spiritualvedicnames.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nine rathas (navaratha).

{{Jainism}}
[[Jainism]] emphasises that '''ratnatraya''' (triple gems of Jainism) ‚Äî the right faith (''Samyak Darshana''), right knowledge (''Samyak Gyana'') and right conduct (''Samyak Charitra'') ‚Äî constitutes the path to liberation. These are known as the triple gems (or jewels) of Jainism and hence also known as ''Ratnatr
== The Path to liberation ==
The very first ''sloka'' (aphorism) of the Sacred [[Jain text]], [[Tattvartha sutra]] reads:{{quote|Right faith, right knowledge, and right conduct (together) constitute the path to liberation.|TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra (1-1){{sfn|Jain|2011|p=2}}}}

ƒÄcƒÅrya [[Pujyapada]] writes in ''[[SarvƒÅrthasiddhi]]'' (translated by Prof. S.A. Jain):{{quote|Perfect release from all karmas is liberation. The path to liberation is the method by which it can be attained. The singular ‚Äòpath‚Äô is used in order to indicate that all the three together constitute the path to liberation. This controverts the views that each of these singly constitutes a path. Hence it must be understood that these three‚Äî right faith, right knowledge and right conduct ‚Äî together constitute the direct path to liberation.{{sfn|S. A. Jain|1992|p=4}}}}

== The Three Jewels ==
[[File:MahaveeJi.jpg|thumb|The three [[Shikhara|shikhar]] (top) of a [[Jain temple]] represents ''Ratnatraya'' (three jewels)]]

=== Right Faith ===
[[File:Jain flag.jpg|thumb|In [[Jain flag]], three dots above ''swastika'' represents ''Ratnatraya'' ]]
[[File:Samyak Darsana Chart.jpg|thumb|300px|Chart showing Samyak Darsana as per Tattvarthasutra]]

Acharya [[Umaswami]] has written in ''TattvƒÅrthas≈´tra'' that '''Tattvarthasraddhanam Samyak-darshanam''' (1-2),&lt;ref name=TS&gt;Tattvartha Sutra&lt;/ref&gt; which means "Belief in substances ascertained as they are is right faith."{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=2}}

These seven substances also called ''[[Tattva (Jainism)|tattva]]'' are:{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=7}}-
#'''''jƒ´va'''''- the [[Soul (Jainism)|soul]] which is characterized by consciousness.
#'''''ajƒ´va'''''- the non-soul
#''[[Asrava|ƒÅsrava]]'' ‚Äì inflow of auspicious and evil karmic matter into the soul.
#bondage ([[Bandha (Jainism)|Bandha]])- mutual intermingling of the soul and ''karmas''
#''[[Samvara]]'' (stoppage)‚Äì obstruction of the inflow of karmic matter into the soul.
#''[[Nirjara]]''‚Äì gradual dissociation of karmic matter from the soul
#''[[moksha (Jainism)|Moksha]]'' (liberation)- complete annihilation of all karmic matter (bound with any particular soul)

Many disciplines of knowledge are developed based on certain fundamental givens, or axioms.  For example, [[Euclidean geometry]] is an [[axiomatic system]], in which all [[theorems]] ("true statements given the axioms") are derived from a finite number of axioms. [[Special theory of relativity]] bases itself on one of the fundamental principles called "The Principle of Invariant Light Speed".  It takes it as given that light in vacuum propagates with the constant speed in terms of any system of inertial coordinates, regardless of the state of motion of the light source. These seven fundamental concepts, provide the metaphysical structure of [[Jain philosophy]].&lt;ref name=MehtaTU&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.ibiblio.org/jainism/database/BOOK/arhat.doc |title= Path of Arhat - A Religious Democracy |author= Mehta, T.U |volume = 63 |publisher = Pujya Sohanalala Smaraka Parsvanatha Sodhapitha |year = 1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the human state of existence, right faith acquired from destruction as well as from destruction-cum- subsidence. An intelligent conviction and profound faith in the essential nature of the soul, of matter, and of their mutual relationships, actions and reactions, is a necessary condition for launching upon the path of liberation.&lt;ref name=JyotiPrasad&gt;Jyoti Prasad Jain Dr. Essence of Jainism, Shuchita Publications, Varanasi, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Jainism declares that a person with the right faith will have spiritual calmness (''Prasanna''), desire for liberation from the endless birth-life-death cycles (''Samvega''), without any attachment or aversion to anything (''Nirveda''), kindness (''Anukampa''), and belief in the ''tattvas'' (fundamental principles) described just above (''ƒÅstika'').

=== Right knowledge ===
Jain texts mention that knowledge is of five kinds ‚Äì sensory knowledge, scriptural knowledge, clairvoyance, telepathy, and omniscience.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=5}} Out of these, sensory knowledge, scriptural knowledge and clairvoyance may also be erroneous knowledge.{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=13}} Most of our knowledge is sensory-based (''mati'') and based on recorded knowledge developed by our ancestors in the form of books, articles, papers and other medium (''sruta''). Jain philosophers also include knowledge acquired directly without any medium. This is achieved by removing the karmic veil on the soul.
*A person who sees objects illuminated by coloured light may not be able to judge the true colour of the objects. However, the same person viewing these objects illuminated by sunlight will see the true nature of their colours, without difficulty. Similarly, proper knowledge is essential to provide the right guidance to the soul in its journey towards spiritual uplifting.
*The Jain theory of knowledge is a highly developed one based on comprehensive apprehension of reality in multitude of view points and relativity.&lt;ref name=JyotiPrasad/&gt;
*[[Anekantavada]], which literally means search of truth from different points of view, is the application of the principle of equality of souls in the sphere of thought. It is a jain philosophical standpoint just as there is the Advaitic standpoint of Sankara and the standpoint of the Middle Path of the Buddhists.&lt;ref name=Ramjee&gt;Singh Ramjee Dr. Jaina Perspective in Philosophy and Religion,Pujya Sohanalala Smaraka Parsvanatha Sodhapitha, Faridabad, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; This search leads to understanding and toleration of different and even conflicting views.  When this happens, prejudices subside and the tendency to accommodate increases.  The theory of [[Anekanta]] is therefore a unique experiment of non-violence at the root.&lt;ref name=MehtaTU/&gt;
*A derivation of this principle is the doctrine of [[Syadvada]] which highlights that every view is relative to its view point. For example, an object may seem heavy when carried on planet earth, yet lightweight when carried on the moon, where gravity is different.  It is a matter of our daily experience that the same object which gives pleasure to us under certain circumstances becomes boring under different situations.  Nonetheless relative truth is undoubtedly useful as it is a stepping stone to the ultimate realisation of reality.  The theory of [[Syadvada]] is based on the premise that every proposition is only relatively true.  It all depends on the particular aspect from which we approach that proposition. Jains therefore developed a logic that encompasses sevenfold predication so as to assist in the construction of proper judgement about any proposition.
*[[Syadvada]] provides Jainas with a systematic methodology to explore the real nature of reality and consider the problem in a non-violent way from different perspectives. This process ensures that each statement is expressed from seven different conditional and relative viewpoints or propositions, and thus it is known as theory of conditioned predication. These seven propositions are described as follows:
::1.SyƒÅd-asti ‚Äî "in some ways it is"
::2.SyƒÅd-nƒÅsti ‚Äî "in some ways it is not"
::3.SyƒÅd-asti-nƒÅsti ‚Äî "in some ways it is and it is not"
::4.SyƒÅd-asti-avaktavya ‚Äî "in some ways it is and it is indescribable"
::5.SyƒÅd-nƒÅsti-avaktavya ‚Äî "in some ways it is not and it is indescribable"
::6.SyƒÅd-asti-nƒÅsti-avaktavya ‚Äî "in some ways it is, it is not and it is indescribable"
::7.SyƒÅd-avaktavya ‚Äî "in some ways it is indescribable"

*This means, no model of reality is absolute including religious/spiritual/philosophical concepts.  However, each model provides insight into the working of the universe that are useful within the bounds of its framework and therefore useful under certain conditions.

=== Right conduct ===

Right conduct is the application of the knowledge developed, so as to exercise control over our inner desires and reach a stage where there is no attachment or aversion.

Right conduct includes:{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=57}}
* Five kinds of spiritual purity
# ''[[SƒÅmƒÅyika]]'' (equanimity),
# penalties for faults arising from inadvertence, or negligence, on account of which one loses equanimity,
# refraining from ''himsa'' (injury),
# control of passions, and
# contemplation of one's own soul

* Observance of [[Mahavrata]]s (five major vows) and seven supplementary vows.

The interesting aspect is that on this path there is a place for every one from the beginner to the most advanced seekers. Further, it encompasses all aspects of human life, namely social, personal, economic and spiritual leading to integrated development of the individual.

== Right Faith and Right Knowledge ==
Right view and right knowledge are inter-dependent. For instance, when the clouds disappear, both the heat and the light of the sun are manifested simultaneously. Similarly, when right faith is attained by the soul owing to the subsidence, destruction or destruction- cum-subsidence of faith-deluding karmas, right sensory knowledge and right scriptural knowledge are attained by the soul
at the same time by the removal of wrong sensory and wrong scriptural knowledge.{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=4}}

== Right Knowledge and Right Conduct ==
Right Knowledge must be accompanied by Right conduct which is necessary for the destruction of karmic bonds.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=182}} Without it there is no release from the cycle of transmigration, i.e., repeated births and deaths. Just like the light from millions of lamps is of no avail to a blind person, studying scriptures alone is of no use to a person who does not apply them.

=== Stages on the Path to liberation ===
{{main|gunasthana}}
[[File:Fourteen stages.JPG|thumb|Fourteen stages on the Path to liberation]]
Jainism acknowledges that the soul advances to its liberated stage in various steps, called ''Gunasthana''. Jain literature describes these states in detail. The following provides a concise summary on the various statuses of soul on its journey to spiritual advancement.

;Awakening - Developing right view
#Lowest stage with ignorance, delusion, and with intense attachments and aversions.  This is the normal condition of all souls involved in the ''samsara'', and is the starting point of spiritual evolution.
#Indifference to reality with occasional vague memory of spiritual insight.
#Fleeting moments of curiosity towards understanding reality.
#Awareness of reality with trust developed in the right view, combined with willingness to practice self-discipline. The soul may be able to subdue the four passions, namely anger, pride, deceit and greed.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=119}}

;Developing right view and discipline
5. The soul now begins to observe some of the rules of right conduct with a view to perfecting itself.  With the discipline of introductory or minor vows, the soul starts on the process of climbing the spiritual ladder.&lt;br /&gt;
6. Major vows taken up with firm resolve to control passions.  There may be failures due to lack of full control over passions or carelessness.

;Developing self discipline and knowledge
7. Intense practice of vows assisted in better self-control and virtually replaced carelessness with spiritual vigilance and vigor.&lt;br /&gt;
8. Closer to perfect self-control over actions, higher control over mind, thought and passions with the soul ready for reduction of the effects of conduct-deluding karma.&lt;br /&gt;
9. Higher control over removal of passions, and elimination of conduct-deluding karma begins.&lt;br /&gt;
10. Complete elimination of all passions except for subtle degree of attachment.

;Gaining absolute knowledge and bliss
11. Suppressed passions and lingering conduct-deluding karma may rise to drag the soul to lower stages; fleeting experiences of equanimity.&lt;br /&gt;
12. This is the point of no return. All passions as well as conduct-deluding karma are eliminated.  Permanent internal peace achieved.  No new bondage from this point onwards.&lt;br /&gt;
13. All inimical karma destroyed. Omniscience achieved and Arihant stage reached. However the perfected soul is still trapped in the physical body (with right knowledge attained).&lt;br /&gt;
14. This is the last stage on the Path, and is followed by the soul's destruction of the ''aghƒÅtiƒÅ karmas''. Those who pass this stage are called ''siddha'' and become fully established in Right Faith, Right Knowledge and Right Conduct.{{sfn|Champat Rai Jain|1917|p=121}}

{{Jainism}}

'''Sambhavanatha''' was the third [[Jainism|Jain]] ''[[tirthankara]]'' (omniscient teaching god) of the present age ([[Avasarpini]]). Sambhavanatha was born to King ''JitƒÅrƒ´'' and ''Queen Susena'' at [[Sravasti]]. His birth date was the fourteenth day of the Margshrsha shukla month of the Indian calendar. Like all ''[[Arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]'' (omniscient beings), Sambhavanatha at the end of his life destroyed all associated [[Karma in Jainism|karmas]] and attained ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (liberation).

==Life==
Sambhavanatha was the third ''[[tirthankara]]'' (omniscient [[Jain]] teacher) of the present age ([[Avasarpini]]).{{sfn|Tukol|1980|p=31}} He was born to King JitƒÅrƒ´ and Queen Susena at [[Sravasti]].{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2015|p=183}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Sravasti |url=http://www.asiexbrpatna.bih.nic.in/saravasti.htm |work=asiexbrpatna.bih.nic.in }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Ikshvaku dynasty]].{{sfn|Tukol|1980|p=31}} His height was 400 [[Dhanusha (unit)|dhanusa]] (1,200 meters).{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2015|p=183}} Sambavanatha is associated with Horse emblem, Sala tree,{{sfn|Krishna|Amirthalingam|2014|p=46}} Trimukha (three-faced) [[Yaksha]] and Prajnapthi &amp; Duritari [[Yakshi]].{{sfn|Tandon|2002|p=44}}

According to Jain text UttarapurƒÅ·πáa, Sambhavanatha possessed three [[Jain epistemology|types of knowledge]] from birth.{{sfn|Jain|2015|p=15}}

== Prayer ==
''Svayambhustotra'' by ''[[Acarya Samantabhadra]]'' is the adoration of twenty-four tirthankaras. Its five slokas ([[aphorism]]s) adore the qualities of ''SambhavanƒÅtha''.{{sfn|Vijay K. Jain|2015|p=16-19}}
{{quote|O Lord SambhavanƒÅtha! The worldly life appears to be transient, without a protector, sullied with the blemishes of pride and delusion, and tormented by birth, old-age and death.

The '''Sarb Hind Shiromani Akali Dal''' ('''SHSAD''') was a [[Sikh]] [[political party]] in [[India]], formed after a split in the [[Shiromani Akali Dal]].&lt;ref name="KaminskyLong2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arnold P.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26392">A '''secular religion''' is a communal [[belief system]] that often rejects or neglects the metaphysical aspects of the supernatural, commonly associated with traditional religion, instead placing typical religious qualities in earthly entities. Among systems that have been characterized as secular religions are [[capitalism]],&lt;ref&gt;Kojin Karatani, ''Transcritique: On Kant and Marx'' (MIT Press: 2003), p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=mR1HIJVoy6wC&amp;pg=PA212 212]&lt;/ref&gt; [[communism]], [[anarchism]], [[fascism]], [[nationalism]], [[Auguste Comte]]'s [[Religion of Humanity]] and the [[Cult of Reason]] and [[Cult of the Supreme Being]] that developed after the [[French Revolution]].

==Contemporary characterizations==
The term secular religion is often applied today to communal belief systems‚Äîas for example with the view of love as our postmodern secular religion.&lt;ref&gt;U. Beck/E. Beck-Gernsheim, ''The Normal Chaos of Love'' (1995) Chap. 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul Vitz]] applied the term to modern [[psychology]] in as much as it fosters a cult of the self, explicitly calling "the self-theory ethic [...] this secular religion".&lt;ref&gt;Paul C. Vitz, ''Psychology as Religion: The Cult of Self-worship'' (1994) p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; Sport has also been considered as a new secular religion, particularly with respect to [[Olympism]].&lt;ref name="PreussLiese"&gt;H. Preuss/ K. Liese, ''Internationalism in the Olympic Movement'' (2011) p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; For [[Pierre de Coubertin]], founder of the modern [[Olympic Games]], belief in them as a new secular religion was explicit and lifelong.&lt;ref&gt;B. W. Ritchie/D. Adair, ''Sport Tourism'' (2004) p. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political religion==
{{Politics}}
The theory of political religion concerns governmental [[ideology|ideologies]] whose cultural and political backing is so strong that they are said to attain power equivalent to those of a [[state religion]], with which they often exhibit significant similarities in both theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Emilio: ''Politics as Religion'' (2006) Princeton University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to basic forms of politics, like parliament and elections, it also holds an aspect of "sacralization" related to the institutions contained within the regime and also provides the inner measures traditionally considered to be religious territory, such as [[ethics]], [[Value (personal and cultural)|values]], [[symbol]]s, [[Mythology|myths]], [[ritual]]s, [[Archetype|archetypes]] and for example a national [[liturgy|liturgical]] calendar.

Political religious organizations, such as the Nazi Party, adhered to the idealization of cultural and political power over the country at large. The church body of the state no longer held control over the practices of religious identity. Because of this, Nazism was countered by many political and religious organizations as being a political religion, based on the dominance which the Nazi regime had (Gates and Steane).&lt;ref&gt;"Political Religion -the influence of Ideological and Identity Orientation" (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Political religions generally vie with existing traditional religions, and may try to replace or eradicate them. The term was given new attention by the political scientist [[Hans Maier (political scientist)|Hans Maier]].&lt;ref name="maier"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Maier |editor1-first=Hans |date=2004‚Äì2012 |origyear=1996-2003 |title=Totalitarismus und politische Religionen |trans-title=Totalitarianism and political religions (3 vols.) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wozo1W7giZQC&amp;dq |location= |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 9780714685298|accessdate= |page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Totalitarianism|Totalitarian societies]] are perhaps more prone to political religion, but various scholars have described features of political religion even in [[democracy|democracies]], for instance [[American civil religion]] as described by [[Robert Bellah]] in 1967.

The term is sometimes treated as synonymous with [[civil religion]], {{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} but although some scholars use the terms equivalently, others see a useful distinction, using "civil religion" as something weaker, which functions more as a socially unifying and essentially conservative force, whereas a political religion is radically transformational, even [[apocalypse|apocalyptic]].&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Emilio: ''Politics as Religion'' (2006) Princeton University Press, s.xxii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overview===
The term ''political religion'' is based on the observation that sometimes political ideologies or political systems display features more commonly associated with [[religion]]. Scholars who have studied these phenomena include [[William E. Connolly|William Connolly]] in [[political science]], [[Christoph Deutschmann]] in [[sociology]], [[Emilio Gentile]] in [[history]], [[Oliver O'Donovan]] in [[theology]] and others in [[psychology]]. A political religion often occupies the same ethical, psychological and sociological space as a traditional religion, and as a result it often displaces or co-opts existing religious organizations and beliefs. The most central marker of a political religion involves the ''sacralization'' of politics, for example an overwhelming religious feeling when serving one's country, or the devotion towards the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Benjamin Franklin: ''The Christian Life &amp; Character of the Civil Institutions of the United States; Developed in the Official and Historical Annals of the Republic'' (1864) Philadelphia: George W. Childs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Emilio: ''Politics as Religion'' (2006) Princeton University Press, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; Although a political religion may co-opt existing religious structures or symbolism, it does not itself have any independent [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[theocratic]] elements‚Äîit is essentially secular, using religious motifs and methods for political purposes, if it does not reject religious faith outright.&lt;ref&gt; For a compelling opinion on this important distinction, see Angela Astoria Kurtz, "God, not Caesar: Revisiting National Socialism as 'Political Religion'" in ''History of European Ideas'', Vol. 35; No. 2 (June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a political religion is considered to be [[Secularity|secular]], but more radical forms of it are also [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendental]].&lt;ref&gt; Angela Astoria Kurtz, "God, not Caesar:  Revisiting National Socialism as 'Political Religion'" in ''History of European Ideas'', Vol. 35; No. 2 (June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, Emilio: ''Politics as Religion'' (2006) Princeton University Press, p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of the theory===
The 18th-century philosopher [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] (1712‚Äì1778) argued that all societies need a religion to hold men together. Because Christianity tended to pull men away from earthly matters, Rousseau advocated a "civil religion" that would create the links necessary for political unity around the state. The Swiss Protestant theologian Adolf Keller (1872‚Äì1963) argued that [[Marxism]] in the [[Soviet Union]] had been transformed into a secular religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keller |first=Adolf |year= 1936 |title=Church and State on the European Continent |page=68 |location= London |publisher= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before emigrating to the United States, the German-born political philosopher [[Eric Voegelin]] wrote a book entitled ''The political religions''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Voegelin |first=Eric  |year= 1999 |origyear=1938 |title= Die politischen Religionen |trans-title= The political religions |series=The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin, volume 5 |url= |location= |publisher= University of Missouri Press |isbn= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other contributions on "political religion" (or associated terms such as "secular religion", "lay religion" or "public religion") were made by [[Luigi Sturzo]] (1871‚Äì1959), [[Paul Tillich]] (1886‚Äì1965), Gerhard Leibholz (1901‚Äì1982), [[Waldemar Gurian]] (1902‚Äì1954), [[Raymond Aron]] (1905‚Äì1983) and [[Walter Benjamin]] (1892‚Äì1940).&lt;ref name=gentile-chapter3-4&gt;Gentile, Emilio: ''Politics as Religion'' (2006) Princeton University Press, chapters 3-4
&lt;/ref&gt; Some saw such "religions" as a response to the existential void and [[nihilism]] caused by [[modernity]], [[mass society]] and the rise of a bureaucratic state, and in political religions "the rebellion against the religion of God" reached its climax.&lt;ref name=gentile-chapter3-4/&gt; They{{who|date=July 2015}} also described them as "pseudo-religions", "substitute religions", "surrogate religions", "religions manipulated by man" and "anti-religions".&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |title= Political Religion: A Concept and its Critics - A Critical Survey |first= Emilio |last= Gentile |journal= Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions |volume= 6 |number= 1 |page= 25 |doi= 10.1080/14690760500099770|year = 2005}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Yale political scientist [[Juan Linz]] and others have noted that the secularization of the twentieth century had created a void which could be filled by an ideology claiming a hold on ethical and identical matters as well, making the political religions based on totalitarianism, universalism and messianic missions (such as [[Manifest Destiny]]&lt;ref&gt;Gamble, Richard: ''Savior Nation: Woodrow Wilson and a gospel of service'' (2001) Humanitas vol.XIV, nro.1
&lt;/ref&gt;) possible.&lt;ref name="maier"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin, Roger p. 7"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;
Gentile, Emilio: ''Politics as Religion'' (2006) Princeton University Press, chapters 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[academic journal]] with the name ''Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions'' started publication in 2000. It was renamed ''[[Politics, Religion &amp; Ideology]]'' in 2011. It is published by [[Taylor &amp; Francis]].

===Typical aspects===
Key qualities often (not all are always present) shared by political religion include:
*Structural
** Differentiation between self and ''other'', and demonisation of ''other'' (in theistic religion, the differentiation usually depends on adherence to certain dogmas and social behaviours; in political religion, differentiation may be on grounds such as nationality, social attitudes, or membership in "enemy" political parties, instead).
** A transcendent leadership, either with [[messiah|messianic]] tendencies, often a charismatic figurehead.
** Strong, hierarchical organisational structures.
** The control of education, in order to ensure the security, continuation and the veneration of the existing system.
*Belief
** A coherent belief system for imposing symbolic meaning on the external world, with an emphasis on security through faith in the system.
** An intolerance of other ideologies of the same type.
** A degree of [[utopianism]].
** The belief that the ideology is in some way natural or obvious, so that (at least for certain groups of people) those who reject it are in some way "blind".
** A genuine desire on the part of individuals to convert others to the cause.
** A willingness to place ends over means‚Äîin particular, a willingness (for some) to use violence or/and fraud.
** Fatalism‚Äîa belief that the ideology will inevitably triumph in the end.

Not all of these aspects are present in any one ''political religion''; this is only a list of some common aspects.

===Suppression of religious beliefs===
Political religions compete with existing religions, and try, if possible, to replace or eradicate them.&lt;ref name="maier"/&gt;  Loyalty to other entities, such as a church or a deity are often viewed as interfering with loyalty to the political religion. The authority of potential religious leaders also presents a threat to the authority of the political religion.  As a result, some or all religious sects are either suppressed or banned. An existing sect may be converted into a [[state religion]], but dogma and personnel may be modified to suit the needs of the party or state. Where there is suppression of religious institutions and beliefs, this might be explicitly accompanied by [[atheism|atheistic]] doctrine as in [[state atheism]].

[[Juan Linz]] has posited the [[Separation of church and state#Friendly and hostile separation|friendly form of separation of church and state]] as the counterpole of political religion but describes the hostile form of separation of church and state as moving toward political religion as found in totalitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Maier |editor1-first=Hans |date=2004‚Äì2012 |origyear=1996-2003 |title=Totalitarismus und politische Religionen |trans-title=Totalitarianism and political religions (3 vols.) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wozo1W7giZQC&amp;dq |location= |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 9780714685298|accessdate= |pages=110‚Äì111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absolute loyalty===
[[Loyalty]] to the state or political party and acceptance of the government/party ideology are paramount. Dissenters may be expelled, ostracized, discriminated against, imprisoned, "re-educated", or killed. [[Loyalty oath]]s or membership in a dominant (or sole) political party may be required for employment, government services, or simply as routine.  Criticism of the government may be a serious crime.  Enforcements range from ostracism by one's neighbors to execution. In a fundamental political religion you are either with the system or against it.

===Cult of personality===
{{Main|Cult of personality}}
A political religion often elevates its leaders to near-godlike status.  Displays of leaders in the form of posters or statues may be mandated in public areas and even private homes. Children may be required to learn the state's version of the leaders' biographies in school.

===Myths of origin===
Political religions often rely on a [[myth of origin]] that may have some historical basis but is usually idealized and sacralized. Current leaders may be venerated as descendants of the original fathers. There may also be holy places or shrines that relate to the myth of origin.

==Historical cases==
===Revolutionary France ===
{{main|Cult of Reason|Cult of the Supreme Being}}
[[File:F√™te de l'Etre supr√™me 2.jpg|thumb|right|320px|''The Festival of the Supreme Being'',&lt;br /&gt; by [[Pierre-Antoine Demachy]].]]
Revolutionary France was well noted for being the first state to [[State atheism|reject religion altogether]]. Radicals intended to replace Christianity with a new state religion, or an atheistic ideology. [[Maximilien Robespierre]] rejected atheistic ideologies and intended to create a new religion. Churches were closed, and Catholic Mass was forbidden.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sullivan-county.com/identity/shanda.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Cult of the Supreme Being was well known for its derided festival, which led to the [[Thermidorian reaction]] and the fall of Robespierre.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, p. 345. (''A Cultural History of the French Revolution'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fascism===
{{main|Fascism|Fascist symbolism}}

====Italian fascism====
{{main|Italian fascism}}
According to [[Emilio Gentile]], "Fascism was the first and prime instance of a modern political religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674784758 |title=The Sacralization of Politics in Fascist Italy |publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This religion sacralized the state and assigned it the primary educational task of transforming the mentality, the character, and the customs of Italians. The aim was to create a '[[New Man (utopian concept)|new man]]', a believer in and an observing member of the cult of Fascism."&lt;ref name="gentile"&gt;Gentile, ''The Sacralization of Politics in Fascist Italy'', p.ix.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The argument &lt;nowiki&gt;[that fascism was a ‚Äòpolitical religion‚Äô]&lt;/nowiki&gt; tends to involve three main claims: I) that fascism was characterized by a religious form, particularly in terms of language and ritual; II) that fascism was a sacralized form of totalitarianism, which legitimized violence in defence of the nation and regeneration of a fascist 'new man'; and III) that fascism took on many of the functions of religion for a broad swathe of society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://staff.bath.ac.uk/mlsre/ReflectionsonFascismandReligion.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918095346/http://staff.bath.ac.uk/mlsre/ReflectionsonFascismandReligion.htm |archivedate=September 18, 2008 |title=Reflections on Fascism and Religion |first=Roger |last=Eatwell |journal=Totalitarian Movements and Politics Religions |volume=4 |number=3 |year=2003 |pages=145‚Äì166 |doi=10.1080/14690760412331329991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nazi Germany====
{{main|Nazism|Nazi mysticism}}

"Among committed [Nazi] believers, a mythic world of eternally strong heroes, demons, fire and sword‚Äîin a word, the fantasy world of the nursery‚Äîdisplaced reality."&lt;ref name="burleigh"&gt;Burleigh, ''The Third Reich'', (London: Macmillan, 2000) pp.8-9.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heinrich Himmler]] was fascinated by the occult, and sought to turn the [[SS]] into the basis of an official state cult.&lt;ref name="sscult"&gt;N. Goodrick-Clarke, ''The Occult Roots of Nazism'' (Wellingborough: the Aquarian Press, 1985), and P. Levenda, ''Unholy Alliance'' (New York: Continuum, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
In 1936 a Protestant priest referred explicitly to communism as a new secular religion.&lt;ref&gt;Gentile, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; A couple of years later, on the eve of World War II, [[F. A. Voigt]]  characterised both Marxism and [[National Socialism]] as secular religions, akin at a fundamental level in their authoritarianism and messianic beliefs&lt;ref&gt;F. A. Voigt, ''Unto Caesar'' (1938) p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in their [[Eschatology|eschatological]] view of human History.&lt;ref&gt;Voigt, pp. 17‚Äì20, p. 71 and pp. 98‚Äì9&lt;/ref&gt; Both, he considered, were waging religious war against the liberal enquiring mind of the European heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Voigt, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the social philosopher [[Raymond Aron]] would expand on the exploration of communism in terms of a secular religion;&lt;ref&gt;Aron, Raymond. ''The Opium of the Intellectuals''. London: Secker &amp; Warburg, 1957, pp. 265‚Äì294&lt;/ref&gt; while [[A. J. P. Taylor]], for example, would characterise it as "a great secular religion....the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' must be counted as a holy book in the same class as the Bible".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Chris Wrigley, ''A. J. P. Taylor'' (2006) pp. 229 and 202&lt;/ref&gt;

Klaus-Georg Riegel argued that "Lenin's utopian design of a revolutionary community of virtuosi as a typical political religion of an intelligentsia longing for an inner-worldly salvation, a socialist paradise without exploitation and alienation, to be implanted in the Russian backward society at the outskirts of the industrialised and modernised Western Europe."&lt;ref name="riegel"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Riegel |first=Klaus-Georg |date=June 2005 |title=Marxism‚ÄêLeninism as a political religion |url= |journal=Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=97‚Äì126 |doi= 10.1080/14690760500099788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern examples==
===North Korea===
{{main|Juche}}
The North Korean government has promulgated [[Juche]] as a political alternative to traditional religion. The doctrine advocates a strong nationalist propaganda basis and is fundamentally opposed to [[Christianity]] and [[Buddhism]], the two largest religions on the Korean peninsula. Juche theoreticians have, however, incorporated religious ideas into the state ideology.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  According to government figures, Juche is the largest political religion in [[North Korea]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The public practice of all other religions is overseen and subject to heavy surveillance by the state.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Turkmenistan===
During the long rule of president [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] large pictures and statues of him could be seen in public places in [[Turkmenistan]]. In an interview with the television news program "60 Minutes", Niyazov said the people of Turkmenistan placed them there voluntarily because they love him so much, and that he did not originally want them there. In addition, he granted himself the title "T√ºrkmenba≈üy", meaning "Leader of all Ethnic Turkmens" in the [[Turkmen language]]. A book purportedly authored by Niyazov, ''[[Ruhnama]]'' ("Book of the Soul") was required reading in educational institutions and was often displayed and treated with the same respect as the [[Qur'an]]. The study of Ruhnama in the academic system was scaled down but to some extent continued after Niyazov's death (in 2006), as of 2008.

===Lebanon===
Since its foundation in 1982, [[Hezbollah]], the Shi'a Islamist political party and paramilitary group has produced [[Hezbollah#Media operations|public media]] in order to maintain the Lebanese population under a permanent state of order.

[[File:Mel Sithamur Jain Math, Tamil Nadu.JPG|thumb|[[Mel Sithamur Jain Math]], the residence of [[Laxmisena]]]]
'''Tamil Jains''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]] '''Sama·πáar''', '''Nayi·πâƒÅr''', from [[Prakrit]] ''[[≈örama·πáa|sama·πáa]]'' "wandering renunciate") are [[Tamils]] from [[Tamil Nadu]], India, who practice [[Digambara|Digambara Jainism]] (Tamil {{IAST|''Cama·πáam''}}). They are a microcommunity of around 85,000 (around 0.13% of the population of Tamil Nadu). Tamil Jains are predominantly scattered in northern Tamil Nadu, largely in the districts of [[Madurai]], [[Viluppuram]], [[Kanchipuram]], [[Vellore]], [[Tiruvannamalai]], [[Cuddalore]] and [[Thanjavur]].
Early [[Tamil-Brahmi]] inscriptions in Tamil Nadu date to the 3rd century BCE and describe the livelihoods of Tamil Jains. ''Cama·πáar'' wrote much [[Tamil literature]], including the important [[Sangam literature]], such as the ''[[NƒÅla·π≠iyƒÅr]]'', the ''[[Silappatikaram]]'', the ''[[Manimekalai]]'' and the ''[[Cƒ´vaka CintƒÅma·πái]]''. Three of the five great epics of Tamil literature are attributed to Jains.&lt;ref&gt;Jaina Literature in Tamil, Prof. A. Chakravartis&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origins===
Some scholars believe that Jain philosophy must have entered [[South India]] some time in the sixth century BCE. Literary sources and inscription state that [[Bhadrabahu]] came over to [[Shravanabelagola]] with a 12,000-strong retinue of Jain sages when north India found it hard to negotiate with the 12-year long famine in the reign of [[Chandragupta Maurya]]. Even Chandragupta accompanied this constellation of sages. On reaching Shravanabelagola, Bhadrabahu felt his end approaching and decided stay back along with Chandragupta and he instructed the Jain saints to tour over the [[Chola dynasty|Chola-]] and [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyan]]-ruled domains.

According to other scholars, Jainism must have existed in [[South India]] well before the visit of Bhadrabhu and Chandragupta. There are plenty of caves as old as the fourth century found with Jain inscriptions and Jain deities around [[Madurai]], [[Tiruchirappalli|TiruchirƒÅppa·∏∑·∏∑i]], [[Kanyakumari]] and [[Thanjavur]].

A number of [[Tamil-Brahmi]] inscriptions have been found in [[Tamil Nadu]] that date from the second century BCE. They are regarded as associated with Jain monks and lay devotees.&lt;ref&gt;''Early Tamil Epigraphy from the Earliest Times to the 6th Century A.D.'', Iravatham Mahadeva, Harvard University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://jainsamaj.org/rpg_site/literature2.php?id=595&amp;cat=42 RECENT DISCOVERIES OF JAINA CAVE INSCRIPTIONS IN TAMILNADU, by Iravatham Mahadevan&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact origins of Jainism in Tamil Nadu is unclear. However, Jains flourished in Tamil Nadu at least as early as the [[Sangam period]]. Tamil Jain tradition places their origins are much earlier. The [[Ramayana]] mentions that [[Rama]] paid homage to [[Jain monasticism|Jaina monks]] living in [[South India]] on his way to [[Sri Lanka]]. Some scholars believe that the author of the oldest extant work of literature in Tamil (3rd century BCE), [[TolkƒÅppiyam]], was a Jain.&lt;ref name=Encyclopaedia&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Singh  | first = Narendra   | title = Encyclopaedia of Jainism  | publisher = Anmol Publications  | year = 2001  | page = 3144  | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=pHZwgrLlOkUC&amp;dq  | isbn = 978-81-261-0691-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tirukkural]] by [[Thiruvalluvar]] is considered by many to be the work of a Jain by scholars like V. Kalyanasundarnar, Vaiyapuri Pillai,&lt;ref&gt;Tirukkural, Vol. 1, S.M. Diaz, Ramanatha Adigalar Foundation, 2000,&lt;/ref&gt; Swaminatha Iyer,&lt;ref&gt;Tiruvalluvar and his Tirukkural, Bharatiya Jnanapith, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and P. S. Sundaram.&lt;ref&gt;The Kural, P. S. Sundaram, Penguin Classics, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; It emphatically supports strict [[vegetarianism]] (or [[veganism]]) (Chapter 26) and states that giving up animal sacrifice is worth more than thousand burnt offerings (verse 259).

[[Silappatikaram]], the earliest surviving epic in Tamil literature, was written by a Sama·πáa, [[Ilango Adigal]]. This epic is a major work in Tamil literature, describing the historical events of its time and also of then-prevailing religions, Jainism, Buddhism and [[Shaivism]]. The main characters of this work, [[Kannagi]] and [[Kovalan]], who have a divine status among Tamils, were Jains.

According to [[George L. Hart]], who holds the endowed Chair in Tamil Studies by [[University of California]], [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]], has written that the legend of the [[Tamil Sangams]] or "literary assemblies", was based on the Jain ''sangham'' at [[Madurai]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was a permanent Jaina assembly called a Sangha established about 604 A.D. in Madurai. It seems likely that this assembly was the model upon which tradition fabricated the Sangam legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tamil.berkeley.edu/html/chapter_1.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/19970709071128/http://tamil.berkeley.edu/html/chapter_1.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1997-07-09 |title=The Milieu of the Ancient Tamil Poems, Prof. George Hart |date=1997-07-09 |accessdate=2012-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jainism became dominant in Tamil Nadu in the fifth and sixth century CE, during a period known as the ''Kalabhra interregnum.{{sfn|John E. Cort|1998|p=187}}

===Decline===
Jainism began to decline around the 8th century A.D., with many Tamil kings embracing Hindu religions, especially [[Shaivism]]. Still, the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]], [[Pallava dynasty|Pallava]] and [[Pandya Dynasty|Pandya]] dynasties embraced Jainism. The Shaivite legend about the [[impalement of the Jains in Madurai]] claims that 8000 Jains were impaled after they lost a contest against the Saivites, Thirugnana Sambandhar was invited by the queen of Madurai to check the atrocities of Jains and their influence on the King; however, this legend is not mentioned in any Jain text&lt;ref name="Ashim1984"&gt;{{cite book | author=Ashim Kumar Roy | title=A history of the Jainas | url=http://www.jainworld.com/book/historyofjainism/ch9a.asp | accessdate=22 May 2013 | year=1984 | publisher=Gitanjali | chapter = 9. History of the Digambaras}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Paul Dundas]], the story represents the abandonment of Madurai by Jains for economic reasons or the gradual loss of their political influence.&lt;ref name="Paul2002"&gt;{{cite book | author=Paul Dundas | title=Jains | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ialKAbIyV4C&amp;pg=PA127 | accessdate=23 May 2013 | year=2002 | publisher=Routledge | isbn=978-0-415-26606-2 | page=127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indian Independence===
When India became independent in 1947, Madras Presidency became [[Madras State]], comprising present day Tamil Nadu, coastal Andhra Pradesh, South Canara district Karnataka, and parts of Kerala. The state was subsequently split up along linguistic lines. In 1969, Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning ''Tamil country''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tamiljains.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/features/magazine/tamil-jain/article5504164.ece Tamil Jain?] by Mahima Jain, The Hindu, 28 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archaeological evidences===
The ruins of Anandamangalam vestiges were discovered in ''Anandamangalam'', a small hamlet near ''Orathi'' village in [[Kancheepuram district]] of [[Tamil Nadu]]. The ruins had the rock-cut sculptures of ''[[yakshini]]'' (tutelary deity) [[Ambika (Jainism)|Ambika]] and [[tirthankara]] [[Neminatha]] and [[Parshvanatha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Bhaskaran|first=S.

==Lifestyle==
The occupation of the majority of the Tamil Jain families is agriculture. Many are teachers. A considerable number of them are settled in urban areas, they are employed in public and private sectors. A small population has settled overseas (US, Canada, UK, Australia and other places).

'''Cuisine:''' Tamil Jains are ardent vegetarians.  Until the turn of the 20th century, they were a self-sustained rural based farming community. They were landowners and used contract labourers for their agricultural activities.  Their household included large tracts of land, cattle, and milch cows. They had kitchen gardens growing vegetables for their daily need.  Dairy food such as milk, curd, butter and ghee were cooked in house.  Daily food was very simple consisting of a brunch with rice, cooked lentils (paruppu), ghee, vegetable sambar, curd, sun dried pickles of mango, lemon or citron, deep fried sun dried 'crispies' (vadavam) made from rice pie. Evening snacks of deep fired lentil preparations and before sunset dinner consisting either idli, dosa or rice with buttermilk and lentil chutney (thogaiyal). While seniors, people undergoing religious fast and ardent followers of religious principles avoided garlic, onions and tubers in their daily food, these were occasionally used by others in the household.

==Identity==
Tamil Jains are well assimilated in Tamil society, without any outward differentiation. Their physical features are similar to Tamils. Apart from certain religious adherences, practices and [[Jain vegetarianism|vegetarianism]], their culture is similar to the rest of Tamil Nadu. However, they name their children by the names of Tirthankaras and characters from Jaina literature.

==Lifetime ceremonies==

Ezhankaapu - on the seventh day of its birth, a new born baby is adorned with bracelets.
 
Kaathu Kutthal - ear piercing and adorning child with earrings. This ceremony is mostly performed in either Aarpakkam temple or Thirunarangkondai i.e.Thirunarungkundram. (Appandai Nathar is the deity).

==Other Ceremonies==
[[File:Gomateswara.jpg|thumb|[[Gommateshvara]], [[Karnataka]]]]
[[Upadesha|Upadesam]] - the formal induction into religious practices and adherences is called Upadesam.  This is done to both boys and girls, at around the age of 15.  After Upadesam, one is supposed to follow religious practices with vigor and seriousness.

[[Marriage]] - outwardly, Jain marriages resemble Hindu marriages.  However, the [[mantra]]s chanted are Jain. There is no Brahmin priest; instead there is a Sama·πáar called a ''Koyil Vaadhiyar'' or temple priest, who conducts the ceremonies.

[[Pilgrimage]] - most Jains go on pilgrimage to [[Tirtha (Jainism)|tirtha]]s and major [[Jain temples]] in [[North India]] - Sammed [[Shikharji]], [[Pawapuri|Pavapuri]], [[Champapuri]] and Urjayanta Giri - as well as places in [[South India]] such as [[Shravanabelagola]], Humcha or Hombuja [[Humbaj]], Simmanagadde in [[Karnataka]] and Ponnur Malai in [[Tamil Nadu]].

There are private amateur tour operators as well who take pilgrims to newly identified ancient Tamil jain sites in western Tamil Nadu (kongunadu) and northern Kerala (vayanadu).

Funeral rites - the dead are placed on a pyre and incinerated. Ashes are then disbursed in water courses and ceremonies are performed on 10th or 16th day.  Annual remembrance ceremonies similar to Hindu practice are not performed. But no festivities or functions are followed that year on the paternal side.

==Festivals==
*[[Akshaya Tritiya]] commemorates the first [[Tirthankara]], [[Rishabha (Jain tirthankar)|Rishabha]], partaking food after many long years of penance.
*Jinaratri commemorates Rishabha's [[moksha]].
*[[Mahavir Jayanti]] celebrates Tirtankara [[Mahavira]]'s birth.
*[[Diwali]] commemorates Mahavira's [[moksha]].
*[[Vasant Panchami]] honors the [[Jain Agamas]]
*[[Upaakarma]] commemorates the [[Chakravartin]] [[Jadabharata|Bharata]], son of Rishabha, acknowledging the true scholars by awarding them the [[Upanayana]].
*[[Karthikai Deepam]] at the onset of the month of [[Kartika (month)|Kartika]]
*[[Puthandu]] and [[Thai Pongal]] are the other common festivals celebrated along with other Tamils.

==Fastings and other religious practices==

[[Full Moon|Full moon days]], [[Chaturdashi|Chaturdasi]] (14th day of the fortnight), [[Ashtami]] (8th day of the fortnight) are days chosen for [[fasting]] and religious observations. Women take food only after reciting the name of a [[tirthankara]] five times.  People undertake such practices as a vow for certain period of time - sometimes even for years.  On completion, Udhyapana festivals (special prayer services) are performed, religious books and memorabilia are distributed. People who take certain vows eat only after sunrise and before sunset.

==Religious head==
===Bhattaraka Laxmisena===
{{Main article|Laxmisena|Jina Kanchi Jain Mutt}}
[[Bhattaraka Laxmisena]] of [[Jina Kanchi Jain Mutt]] or madam at Mel-Sithamoor (near [[Tindivanam]], [[Villupuram]] District) is the religious head of the community.  He performs the [[Upadesha|Upadesam]] ceremony (similar to Baptism) for Jain children.  In the past, this mutt had been the centre for religious study, guiding and helping the economic activities of its members, organising religious discourses, maintenance of temples and such activities.  The mutt was able to achieve such multifarious operations with the help and contributions of its members. At present the mutt is also maintaining A Gousala (Cows &amp; others).

The present finance position of the mutt is inadequate for even day-to-day maintenance.  Planting of coconut and mango trees has been started to increase the revenue of the fund for the purpose of day-to-day maintenance of the mutt.  The car ('[[Temple car|ther]]') in the mutt requires replacement of wooden wheels.

=== Swasthi Shree Dhavalakeerthi Bhattaraka Swamiji ===
{{Main article|Dhavalakeerthi|Arahanthgiri Jain Mutt}}
In addition to the above, a new mutt named [[Arahanthgiri Jain Math]] located at Thirumalai near Polur, [[Tiruvannamalai]] district, has been functioning from February 8, 1998 with the name [[Dhavalakeerthi]] Swamigal. Now in the mutt around 2300 students are studying from primary to higher secondary school including Jain philosophy with free boarding and lodging. Maintenance of the above is done through contributions from donors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.akalanka-educational-trust.com/about-us/about-swamiji.html |title=Swasthy Shree Dhavalakeerthi Swamiji |publisher=Akalanka-educational-trust.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104091256/http://www.akalanka-educational-trust.com/about-us/about-swamiji.html |archivedate=4 January 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Islam |beliefs}}
{{God}}
'''Tawhid''' ({{lang-ar|ÿ™Ÿàÿ≠ŸäÿØ}} ''{{transl|ar|taw·∏•ƒ´d}}'', meaning "oneness [of [[God in Islam|God]]]" also [[romanization of Arabic|romanized]] as ''tawheed'', ''touheed'', or ''tevhid''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ga9_AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA207|title=Sufis in Western Society: Global Networking and Locality|others=Dressler, Markus,, Geaves, Ron,, Klinkhammer, Gritt Maria,|isbn=9780415850902|publisher=Routledge|year=2009|location=London|oclc=824531805|page=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the indivisible oneness concept of [[monotheism]] in [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t125/e2356?_hi=0&amp;_pos=2 |title=From the article on Tawhid in Oxford Islamic Studies Online |publisher=Oxfordislamicstudies.com |date=2008-05-06 |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tawhid is the religion's central and single-most important concept, upon which a Muslim's entire faith rests. It unequivocally holds that [[God]] is One (''{{transl|ar|Al- æA·∏•ad}}'') and Single (''{{transl|ar|Al-WƒÅ·∏•id}}'');&lt;ref name="Allah in Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Allah |encyclopedia=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online |accessdate=2008-05-28 |location= |publisher= |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Allah}}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, the Islamic belief in God is considered [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icrs.ugm.ac.id/book/35/the-fundamentals-of-tawhid-islamic-monotheism.html |title=The Fundamentals of Tawhid (Islamic Monotheism) |publisher=ICRS (Indonesian Consortium of Religious Studies |date=2010-10-30 |accessdate=2015-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tawhid constitutes the foremost article of the Muslim [[Profession (religious)|profession of faith]].&lt;ref name="EoI"&gt;D. Gimaret, ''Tawhid'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]]&lt;/ref&gt; The first part of the [[shahada]] (the Islamic [[declaration of faith]]) is the declaration of belief in the oneness of God.&lt;ref name="Allah in Britannica"/&gt; To attribute divinity to anything or anyone else, is ''[[Shirk (Islam)|shirk]]'' - an unpardonable sin according to the [[Qur'an]], if repentance is not sought afterwards.&lt;ref name="Barlas96"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Kitab Al Tawheed|last = Wahhab|first = Abd Al|publisher = Darussalam|isbn = |location = |pages = |chapter = Chapter 4, Fear of Shirk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims believe that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawhid.&lt;ref name="Tariq Ramadan 2005, p. 203"&gt;Tariq Ramadan (2005), p. 203&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an uncompromising [[monotheism]] at the heart of the Islamic beliefs ([[aqidah]]) which is seen, from an Islamic standpoint, as distinguishing Islam from other [[major religion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Turner (2006), p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tawhid is analogous to the monotheistic concept of [[God in Judaism]], as declared in the [[Shema Yisrael]], the Jewish declaration of faith. Tawhid is also analogous to Christian [[Unitarianism]] adhered to by a minority of Christian denominations which reject a trinitarian position of [[God in Christianity]], which is in contrast to most Christian faiths that ascribe to the [[Trinity]] (God as three [[Hypostasis (philosophy)|persons]] in [[Homoousion|one being]]; the [[God the Father|Father]], [[God the Son|Son]], and [[Holy Spirit]]). Further Tawhid requires Muslims not only to avoid worshiping multiple gods, but also to relinquish to strive for money, social status or egoism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3VhMAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114|title=Fame Attack: The Inflation of Celebrity and Its Consequences|publisher=A&amp;C Black|publication-date=2012-01-05|last=Chris|first=Rojek|isbn=9781849668040|location=London|oclc=774293531|page=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an asserts the existence of a single and absolute truth that transcends the world; a unique, independent and indivisible being, who is independent of the entire creation.&lt;ref name="EncRel"&gt;Vincent J. Cornell, Encyclopedia of Religion, Vol 5, pp. 3561-3562&lt;/ref&gt; God, according to Islam, is a universal God, rather than a local, tribal, or parochial one‚ÄîGod is an absolute, who integrates all affirmative values and brooks no evil.&lt;ref name="Barlas96"&gt;[[Asma Barlas]] (2002), p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamic intellectual history can be understood as a gradual unfolding of the manner in which successive generations of believers have understood the meaning and implications of professing God's Unity. Islamic scholars have different approaches toward understanding it. Islamic [[Kalam|theology]], [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]], [[philosophy]], [[Sufism]], even to some degree the Islamic understanding of [[Islamic science|natural sciences]], all seek to explain at some level the principle of tawhid.&lt;ref&gt;Tabatabaei (1981), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

The classical definition of ''tawhid'' was limited to declaring or preferring belief in one God and the unity of God.&lt;ref name="Edward William Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon (Dictionary)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lane|first1=Edward |title=Al-Qamus: An Arabic Lexicon|date=1863|publisher=Williams and Norgate|location=London|pages=2926‚Äì2928 (Vol.8.)|accessdate=17 July 2015|ref=http://www.studyquran.co.uk/LLhome.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the monotheistic definition has persisted into modern Arabic, it is now more generally used to connote "unification, union, combination, fusion; standardization, regularization; consolidation, amalgamation, merger".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Wehr | first = Hans | title = A dictionary of modern written Arabic - Edited by Milton Cowan | publisher = Spoken Language Services | location = New York | page = 1055 | date = 1976 | url = https://archive.org/stream/Dict_Wehr.pdf/Wehr#page/n1072/mode/1up | isbn= 9780879500030}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
According to Edward Lane's Lexicon on classical Arabic, ''tawhid'' is an infinite noun that means "He asserted, or declared, God to be one; he asserted, declared, or preferred belief in the unity of God" and is derived from the Arabic verb ''wahhada'', which means "He made it one; or called it one". &lt;ref name="Edward William Lane's Arabic-English Lexicon (Dictionary)"/&gt; In modern Arabic, the verbs ''wahhada'' or ''yuwahhidu'' mean "to unite" or "bring together" something that which wasn't one, which reflects the struggle of monotheism against polytheism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Hans Wehr Dictionary Of Modern Written Arabic|publisher = Spoken Language Services Inc.|year = 1976|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 1055|edition = 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name of God in Islam ==
{{main|Name of God in Islam}}

In order to explain the complexity of the unity of [[God]] and of the divine nature, the Qur'an uses 99 terms referred to as "Excellent Names of God" (Sura 7:180).The divine names project divine attributes, which, in turn, project all the levels of the creation down to the physical plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gubR7WwQSZUC&amp;pg=PA101|title=The Split World of Gerard Manley Hopkins: An Essay in Semiotic Phenomenology|last=Dennis|first=Sobolev|isbn=0813219094|location=Washington, D.C.|oclc=961580704|page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the supreme name "Allah" and the neologism ''ar-Rahman'' (referring to the divine beneficence that creates and maintains the universe) and a few other specific names like al-Maalik al-Mulook ('King of Kings') in an authentic narration of [[Muhammad]], other names may be shared by both God and human beings. According to the Islamic teachings, the latter is meant to serve as a reminder of God's immanence rather than being a sign of one's divinity or alternatively imposing a limitation on God's transcendent nature. Attribution of divinity to a created entity, ''shirk'', is considered a denial of the truth of God and thus a major sin.&lt;ref name="EncRel" /&gt;

== ''Shirk'' ==
{{main|Shirk (Islam)}}

Associating others with God is known as ''shirk'' and is the antithesis of Tawhid. It is usually but not always in the form of [[idolatry]] and supplicating to others than Allah, or believing that they hold the same attributes as him in an equal or lesser degree. Shirk is divided into two categories:
* Greater shirk (''Shirk-al-Akbar''): open and apparent;
* Lesser shirk (''Shirk-al-Asghar''): concealed or hidden.

Greater Shirk consists of the above-mentioned deeds. A person commits lesser shirk (Shirk-al-Asghar) or hidden polytheism when he claims to believe in God but his thoughts and actions do not reflect his belief. There are also minor forms of Shirk, they must be avoided as well; these include committing a good deed to show off, making an [[oath]] in the name of anyone except God. Within Islam, shirk is an unforgivable crime; God may forgive any sin if one dies in that state except for committing shirk, [[repentance]] is required for its forgiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/20482 |title=How can we repent from shirk? |publisher=islamqa.info |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islamqa.info/en/ref/34171 |title=Will Allaah forgive someone who commits shirk? How can he strengthen his faith? |publisher=islamqa.info |accessdate=2014-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2017}}

== Discerning the unity of God ==
{{allah|all}}
According to [[Hossein Nasr]], [[Ali]], the first imam (Shia view) and fourth [[Rashidun|Rashid Caliph]] ([[Sunni]] view), is credited with having established [[Kalam|Islamic theology]]. His quotations contain the first rational proofs among Muslims of the Unity of God.{{sfn|Nasr|2006|p=120}}

Ali states that "God is One" means that God is away from likeness and numeration and he is not divisible even in imagination.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1988|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The first step of religion is to accept, understand and realize him as the Lord... The correct form of belief in his unity is to realize that he is so absolutely pure and above nature that nothing can be added to or subtracted from his being. That is, one should realize that there is no difference between his person and his attributes, and his attributes should not be differentiated or distinguished from his person.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Lakhani|Shah Kazemi|Lewisohn|2006|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Vincent J. Cornell, a scholar of [[Islamic studies]] quotes the following statement from Ali:
{{quote|To know God is to know his oneness. To say that God is one has four meanings: two of them are false and two are correct. As for the two meanings that are false, one is that a person should say "God is one" and be thinking of a number and counting. This is false because that which has no second cannot enter into the category of number. Do you not see that those who say that God is a third of a trinity fall into this infidelity? Another meaning is to say, "So-and-So is one of his people", namely, a species of this genus or a member of this species. This meaning is also false when applied to God, because it implies likening something to God, whereas God is above all likeness. As to the two meanings that are correct when applied to God, one is that it should be said that "God is one" in the sense that there is no likeness to him among things. Another is to say that "God is one" in the sense that there is no multiplicity or division conceivable in Him, neither outwardly, nor in the mind, nor in the imagination. God alone possesses such a unity.&lt;ref name="EncRel"/&gt;}}

== Arguments for the oneness of God ==

===Theological===
Theologians usually use reason and deduction to prove the existence, unity and oneness of God. They use a [[teleological argument]] for the existence of God as a creator based on perceived evidence of order, purpose, design, or direction‚Äîor some combination of these‚Äîin nature.

Another argument which is used frequently by theologians is [[Reductio ad absurdum]].

===God as the cause of causes===
{{main|Kalam cosmological argument}}
Against the [[polytheism]] of [[pre-Islamic Arabia]], the Qur'an argues that the knowledge of God as the creator of everything rules out the possibility of lesser gods since these beings must be themselves created. For the Qur'an, God is an immanent and transcendent deity who actively creates, maintains and destroys the universe. The reality of God as the ultimate cause of things is the belief that God is veiled from human understanding because of the secondary causes and contingent realities of things in the world.&lt;ref name="EncRel"/&gt; Thus the belief in the oneness of God is equated in the Qur'an with the "belief in the unseen" (Sura {{cite quran|2|3|style=nosup|expand=no}}).&lt;ref name="EncRel"/&gt; The Qur'an summarizes its task in making this "unseen", to a greater or lesser degree "seen" so that belief in the existence of God becomes a Master-Truth rather than an unreasonable belief. The Qur'an states that God's signals are so near and yet so far, demanding that its students listen to what it has to say with humility (Sura {{cite quran|50|33|style=nosup|expand=no}}, Sura {{cite quran|50|37|style=nosup|expand=no}}). The Qur'an draws attention to certain observable facts, to present them as "reminders" of God instead of providing lengthy  "theological" proofs for the existence and unity of God.&lt;ref&gt;Fazlur Rahman (1980), p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ash'ari]] theologians rejected [[Causality|cause and effect]] in essence, but accepted it as something that facilitates humankind's investigation and comprehension of natural processes. These medieval scholars argued that nature was composed of uniform atoms that were "re-created" at every instant by God. The laws of nature were only the customary sequence of apparent causes (customs of God), the ultimate cause of each accident being God himself.&lt;ref&gt;Robert G. Mourison (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

===God as the necessary existent===
{{Main|Proof of the Truthful}}
{{see also|Cosmological argument|ontological argument}}
An [[ontological argument]] for the [[Existence of God#Arguments for the existence of God|existence of God]] was first proposed by [[Avicenna]] (965-1037) in the ''Metaphysics'' section of ''[[The Book of Healing]]''&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Steve A.|date=October 1984|title=IBN Sƒ™NƒÄ'S FOURTH ONTOLOGICAL ARGUMENT FOR GOD'S EXISTENCE|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1478-1913.1984.tb03452.x|journal=The Muslim World|language=en|volume=74|issue=3-4|pages=161‚Äì171|doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.1984.tb03452.x|issn=0027-4909}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morewedge|first=Parviz|date=1970|title=Ibn Sina Avicenna and Malcolm and the Ontological Argument|url=https://academic.oup.com/monist/article-abstract/54/2/234/1032172?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Monist|language=en|volume=54|issue=2|pages=234‚Äì249|doi=10.5840/monist197054212|issn=0026-9662|jstor=27902176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other forms of the argument also appear in Avicenna's other works, and this argument became known as the [[Proof of the Truthful]].

[[Avicenna]] initiated a full-fledged inquiry into the question of [[being]], in which he distinguished between [[essence]] (''Mahiat'') and [[existence]] (''Wujud''). He argued that the fact of existence can not be inferred from or accounted for by the essence of existing things and that form and matter by themselves cannot interact and originate the movement of the universe or the progressive actualization of existing things. Existence must, therefore, be due to an [[Causality|agent-cause]] that necessitates, imparts, gives, or adds existence to an essence. To do so, the cause must be an existing thing and coexist with its effect.&lt;ref name="Islam in Britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| title=Islam |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-11-27|location=|publisher=|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the first attempt at using the method of [[a priori (philosophy)|a priori proof]], which utilizes [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] and [[reason]] alone. Avicenna's proof of God's existence is unique in that it can be classified as both a [[cosmological argument]] and an ontological argument. "It is ontological insofar as ‚Äònecessary existence‚Äô in intellect is the first basis for arguing for a [[Necessary Existent]]". The proof is also "cosmological insofar as most of it is taken up with arguing that [[contingent existents]] cannot stand alone and must end up in a Necessary Existent". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=Toby|last=Mayer|title=Ibn Sina's 'Burhan Al-Siddiqin'|url=https://academic.oup.com/jis/article-abstract/12/1/18/721290?redirectedFrom=fulltext|date=2001-01-01|journal=Journal of Islamic Studies|publisher=[[Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies]], Oxford Journals, [[Oxford University Press]]|volume=12|issue=1|pages=18‚Äì39|doi=10.1093/jis/12.1.18|issn=0955-2340}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another argument Avicenna presented for God's existence was the problem of the [[mind-body dichotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Forming the Mind: Essays on the Internal Senses and the Mind/Body Problem from Avicenna to the Medical Enlightenment|publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media]]|date=September 30, 2007|isbn=978-1-4020-6083-0|editor=Henrik Lagerlund|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6084-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Avicenna, the universe consists of a chain of actual beings, each giving existence to the one below it and responsible for the existence of the rest of the chain below. Because an actual infinite is deemed impossible by Avicenna, this chain as a whole must terminate in a being that is wholly simple and one, whose essence is its very existence, and therefore is self-sufficient and not in need of something else to give it existence. Because its existence is not contingent on or necessitated by something else but is necessary and eternal in itself, it satisfies the condition of being the necessitating cause of the entire chain that constitutes the eternal world of contingent existing things.&lt;ref name="Islam in Britannica"/&gt; Thus his [[Ontological argument|ontological system]] rests on the conception of [[God]] as the ''Wajib al-Wujud'' (necessary existent). There is a gradual multiplication of beings through a timeless emanation from God as a result of his self-knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Nasr |first=Seyyed Hossein | authorlink=Seyyed Hossein Nasr | title=Avicenna |year=2007| encyclopedia=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online | accessdate=2007-11-05|location=|publisher=|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9011433/Avicenna}}

===Indivisibility of God's sovereignty===
The Qur'an argues that there can be no multiple sources of divine sovereignty since "behold, each god would have taken away what [each] had created, And some would have Lorded it over others!"&lt;ref name="Barlas96"/&gt; The Qur'an argues that the stability and order prevailing throughout the universe shows that it was created and is being administered by only one God (Sura {{cite quran|28|70-72|style=nosup|expand=no}}).&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EoQP"/&gt;

The Qur'an in verse 21:22 states: "If there were numerous gods instead of one, [the heavens and the earth] would be in a sorry state". Later Muslim theologians elaborated on this verse saying that the existence of at least two gods would inevitably arise between them, at one time or another, a conflict of wills. Since two contrary wills could not possibly be realized at the same time, one of them must admit himself powerless in that particular instance. On the other hand, a powerless being can not by definition be a god. Therefore, the possibility of having more than one god is ruled out.&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EoQP"&gt;Mustansir Mir, ''Polytheism and Atheism'', [[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other arguments===
The Qur'an argues that human beings have an instinctive distaste for [[polytheism]]: At times of crisis, for example, even the [[idolatry|idolaters]] forget the false deities and call upon the one true God for help. As soon as they are relieved from the danger, they however start associating other beings with God. "So when they ride in the ships they call upon Allah, being sincerely obedient to Him, but when He brings them safe to the land, lo! they associate others (with Him)" (Sura {{cite quran|29|65|style=nosup|expand=no}}).&lt;ref name="EoQP"/&gt;

Next, the Qur'an argues that polytheism takes away from human dignity: God has honored human beings and given them charge of the physical world, and yet they disgrace their position in the world by worshipping what they carve out with their own hands.&lt;ref name="EoQP"/&gt;

Lastly, the Qur'an argues that monotheism is not a later discovery made by the human race, but rather there is the combined evidence of the prophetic call for monotheism throughout human history starting from [[Adam in Islam|Adam]]. The Qur'an suggests several causes for deviation from monotheism to polytheism: Great temporal power, regarded by the holder and his subjects as 'absolute' ‚Äî may lead the holder to think that he is God-like; such claims were commonly forced upon, and accepted by, those who were subject to the ruler. Also, certain natural phenomena (such as the sun, the moon and the stars) inspire feelings of awe, wonder or admiration that could lead some to regard these [[Astrolatry|celestial bodies as deities]]. Another reason for deviation from monotheism is when one becomes a slave to his or her base desires and passions. In seeking to always satisfy the desires, he or she may commit a kind of polytheism.&lt;ref name="EoQP"/&gt;

== Interpretations ==
{{see also|Early Islamic philosophy}}

Understanding of the meaning of Tawhid is one of the most controversial issues among Muslims. Islamic scholars have different approaches toward understanding it, comprising [[Athari|textualistic approach]], [[Kalam|theological approach]], [[Islamic philosophy|philosophical approach]] and [[Sufism]] and [[Irfan]]i approach. These different approaches lead to different and in some cases opposite understanding of the issue.

===Textualistic approach===
{{main|Athari}}
The Textualistists by reason of their conception of the divine Attributes, came to represent the divinity as a complex of names and qualifications alongside the divine essence itself. The Athari methodology of textual interpretation is to avoid delving into extensive theological speculation.&lt;ref name="Corbin 1993, p. 115"&gt;Corbin (1993), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to their belief in Tawheed-al-Asma was-Sifaat, or ''Belief in the Oneness of the Names and the Attributes of Allah'', they take a stance of affirmation of all the Divine Names and Attributes of Allah in a manner that suits His Majesty, as mentioned in the Qu‚Äôran and the Sunnah. This tenet is further divided into four aspects regarding the affirmation that it is without tashbih (establishing likeness), takyeef (speculating as to "how" they are manifested in the divine), ta'teel (negating/denying their apparent meaning) and ta'weel (giving it secondary/symbolic meaning which is different from the apparent meaning). This is strongly opposed to the extremes of either speculative philosophy as was warned against by the Imams of the Salaf, chiefly Imam [[Al-Shafi'i]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ibn Abil-'Izz |title=Sharh al 'Aqeedah at-Tahaawiyyah of Ibn Abil-'Izz, (p. 75); Sharhus-Sunnah (1/218) of Imaam al-Baghawee |publisher= |page= |quote=My ruling regarding the people of kalam is that they should be beaten with palm leaves and shoes and be paraded amongst the kinsfolk and the tribes with it being announced; This is the reward of the one who abandons the Book (Qur'aan) and the Sunnah and turns to theological rhetoric (kalaam). |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Imam [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]], or of anthropomorphism which was strongly refuted by Sheikh [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] in his monumental al`Aqeedat al`Wasatiyah who defined the aqeedah or 'creed' of the [[Salaf]] to be the balanced middle path far from the extremities of the various sects prevalent in the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ibn Taymiyyah |title=Sharh-Al-Aqeedat-Il-Wasitiyah |publisher=Dar us Salam Publications |page= |quote=The followers of Ahlus Sunnah wal Jama'ah occupy a moderate position between the Ahlut Ta'teel (Jahmiyyah) and Ahlut Tamtheel (Mushabbiha), and are moderate between the Jabariyah sect and the Qadariyah sect regarding the Acts of Allah, and are moderate about the Promises of Allah between the Murji'ah and the Wa'eediyah sects among Qadariyah and are moderate on matters of the Faith and names of the religion between the Harooriyah and Mu'tazilah, and between the Murji'ah and Jahmiyah and are moderate regarding the Companions of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him, between the Raafidah and the Khawarij. |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/24706466/Sharh-Al-Aqeedat-Il-Wasitiyah |isbn= |access-date=2017-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730083830/http://www.scribd.com/doc/24706466/Sharh-Al-Aqeedat-Il-Wasitiyah |archive-date=2013-07-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is generally summed and codified into the [[Athari]] school of theology.

===Theological viewpoints===
Certain theologians use the term Tawhid in a much broader meaning to denote the totality of discussion of God, his existence and his various attributes. Others go yet further and use the term to ultimately represent the totality of the "principles of religion". In its current usage, the expressions "Tawhid" or "knowledge of Tawhid" are sometimes used as an equivalent for the whole Kalam, the [[Islamic theology]].&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;

According to Sunni Islam, the orthodox understanding of theology is taken directly from the teachings of Muhammad with the understanding and methodology of his companions, sourced directly from the revealed scripture the [[Qur'an]]; being the main information source for understanding the oneness of God in Islam. All Muslim authorities maintain that a true understanding of God is impossible unless He introduces Himself due to the fact that God is beyond the range of human vision and senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|112|4|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, God tells people who He is by speaking through the [[Prophets of Islam|prophets]]. According to this view, the fundamental message of all of the prophets is: "There is no god but God." &lt;ref&gt;Chittick (2006), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; 

====Mu'tazili school====
{{main|Mu'tazili}}
The Mu'tazilis liked to call themselves the ''men of the tawhid'' (ahl al-tawhid). In Maqalat al-Islamiyin, [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari]] describes the Mu'tazilite conception of the tawhid as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), pp. 109 and 110&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;God is unique, nothing is like him; he is neither body, nor individual, nor substance, nor accident. He is beyond time. He cannot dwell in a place or within a being; he is not the object of any creatural attribute or qualification. He is neither conditioned nor determined, neither engendered nor engendering. He is beyond the perception of the senses. The eyes cannot see him, observation cannot attain him, the imagination cannot comprehend him. He is a thing, but he is not like other things; he is omniscient, all-powerful, but his omniscience and his all-mightiness cannot be compared to anything created. He created the world without any pre-established archetype and without an auxiliary.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to [[Henry Corbin]], the result of this interpretation is the negation of the divine attributes, the affirmation of the created Quran, and the denial of all possibility of the vision of God in the world beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Mu'tazilis believed that God is deprived of all positive attributes, in the sense that all divine qualifications must be understood as being the essence itself, and declaring that God is existing ubiquitously and in everything.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Islamic Studies Book 1|last = Philips|first = Abu Ameenah Bilal|publisher = |isbn = |location = |pages = 2|chapter = 1.1 The Categories of Tawheed}}&lt;/ref&gt; They resorted to [[Esoteric interpretation of the Qur'an|metaphorical interpretations of Qur'anic verses]] or Prophetic reports with seemingly [[anthropomorphic]] content, e.g., the hand is the metaphorical designation of power; the face signifies the essence; the fact that God is seated on the Throne is a metaphorical image of the divine reign, and so on.&lt;ref name="Corbin 1993, p. 115"/&gt;

====Ash'ari school====
{{main|Ash'ari}}
The solution proposed by [[Abu al-Hasan al-Ash'ari]] to solve the problems of tashbih and ta'til concedes that the divine Being possesses in a real sense the Attributes and Names mentioned in the Qur'an. Insofar as these Names and Attributes have a positive reality, they are distinct from the essence, but nevertheless they do not have either existence or reality apart from it. The inspiration of al-Ash'ari in this matter was on the one hand to distinguish essence and attribute as concepts, and on the other hand to see that the duality between essence and attribute should be situated not on the quantitative but on the qualitative level‚Äîsomething which Mu'tazilis thinking had failed to grasp.&lt;ref&gt;Corbin (1993), pp. 115 and 116&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ash'ari]] theology, which dominated Sunni Islam from the tenth to the nineteenth century, insists on ultimate divine transcendence and holds that divine unity is not accessible to human reason. Ash'arism teaches that human knowledge regarding it is limited to what was has been revealed through the prophets, and on such questions as God's creation of evil and the apparent anthropomorphism of God's attributes, revelation has to accepted ''bila kayfa'' (without [asking] how).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|author=Tamara Sonn|title=Taw·∏•ƒ´d|encyclopedia=The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World|editor=John L. Esposito|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=Oxford|year=2009|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001/acref-9780195305135-e-0788?rskey=y8ZWqZ|subscription=yes|isbn=9780195305135|doi=10.1093/acref/9780195305135.001.0001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Twelvers theology====
{{main|Theology of Twelvers}}
Twelvers theology is based on the [[Hadith]] which have been narrated from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], [[Ali|the first]], [[Imam Baqir|fifth]], [[Jafar al-Sadiq|sixth]], [[Musa al-Kazim|seventh]] and [[Imam Reza|eighth]] [[Twelve Imams|Imams]] and compiled by Shia scholars such as [[Al-Shaykh al-Saduq]] in ''al-Tawhid''.&lt;ref&gt;Tabatabaei (19981), pp. 23 and 24&lt;/ref&gt;{{verification needed|date=June 2015}}
According to Shia theologians, the attributes and [[99 Names of God|names of God]] have no independent and hypostatic existence apart from the being and essence of God. Any suggestion of these attributes and names being conceived of as separate is thought to entail [[polytheism]]. It would be even incorrect to say God knows by his knowledge which is in his essence but God knows by his knowledge which is his essence. Also God has no physical form and he is insensible.&lt;ref&gt;Momen (1985), p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Twelvers believe God is alone in being, along with his names, his attributes, his actions, his theophanies. The totality of being therefore is he, through him, comes from him, and returns to him. God is not a being next to or above other beings, his creatures; he is being, the absolute act of being (wujud mutlaq). For, if there were being other than he (i.e., creatural being), God would no longer be the Unique, i.e., the only one to be.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1988|p=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; As this Divine Essence is infinite, his qualities are the same as his essence, Essentially there is one Reality which is one and indivisible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|Dabashi|Nasr|1988|p=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The border between theoretical Tawhid and Shirk is to know that every reality and being in its essence, attributes and action are from him(from Him-ness), it is Tawhid. Every supernatural action of the prophets is by God's permission as Quran points to it. The border between the Tawhid and Shirk in practice is to assume something as an end in itself, independent from God, not as a road to God(to Him-ness).&lt;ref name="MM"&gt;{{harvnb|Motahari|1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophical viewpoints===
{{main|Islamic Philosophy|Avicennism}}
[[Al-Farabi]], [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi|Al-Razi]] and especially [[Avicenna]] put forward an interpretation of Tawhid in light of reason, with the Qur'an and Hadith serving as a basis. Before Avicenna the discussions among Muslim philosophers were about the unity of God as divine creator and his relationship with the world as creation. The earlier philosophers were profoundly affected by the emphasis of [[Plotinus]] on [[Divine simplicity]].&lt;ref&gt;

ŸéWhether this view can be reconciled with [[Islam]], particularly given the question of what role is left for God's will, was to become a subject of considerable controversy within intellectual Islamic discourse.

===Sufi and Irfani viewpoint===
{{main|Sufi cosmology|Sufi metaphysics}}
In Islamic mysticism ([[Sufism]] and [[Irfan]]), Tawhid is not only the affirmation in speech of God's unity, but also as importantly a practical and existential realization of that unity. This is done by rejecting the concepts tied to the world of multiplicity, to isolate the eternal from the temporal in a practical way. The ideal is a radical purification from all worldliness.&lt;ref name="Carl Ernst 1984, p. 29"&gt;[[Carl Ernst]] (1984), p. 29&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vincent J. Cornall, it is possible to draw up a [[monist]] image of God (''see [[Sufi metaphysics]]'') by describing the reality as a unified whole, with God being a single concept that would describe or ascribe all existing things: "He is the First and the Last, the Evident and the Immanent: and He has full knowledge of all things."(Sura {{cite quran|57|3|style=nosup|expand=no}})"&lt;ref name="EncRel"/&gt; However many Muslims criticize monism for it blurs the distinction between the creator and the creature, something incompatibility with the genuine and absolute monotheism of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Roger S. Gottlie (2006), p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

For Muslim mystics ([[sufis]]), the affirmation in speech of God's unity is only the first step of Tawhid. Further steps involve a spiritual experience for the existential realization of that unity. Categorizations of different steps of Tawhid could be found in the works of Muslims Sufis like [[Junayd Baghdadi]] and [[al-Ghazali]]. It involves a practical rejection of the concepts tied to the world of multiplicity.&lt;ref name="Carl Ernst 1984, p. 29"/&gt; Al-Junayd for example "distinguishes four steps, starting from the simple attestation of unicity which is sufficient for ordinary believers, and culminating in the highest rank reserved for the elite, when the creature totally ceases to exist before his Lord, thus achieving al-fanƒÅ fi al-tawhƒ´d [annihilation in unity]".&lt;ref name="EoI"/&gt;

====Annihilation and subsistence====
According to the concept of Fana, Annihilation and Subsistence, "Man's existence, or ego, or self-hood ... must be annihilated so that he can attain to his true self which is his existence and "subsistence" with God. All of man's character traits and habits, everything that pertains to his individual existence must become completely naughted and "obliterated" (mahw). Then God will give back to him his character traits and everything positive he ever possessed. But at this stage, he will know consciously and actually - not just theoretically - and with a through spiritual realization, that everything he is derives absolutely from God. He is nothing but a ray of God's Attributes manifesting the Hidden Treasure." &lt;ref&gt;[[William Chittick]] (1983), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

====Unity of existence====
{{main|Sufi metaphysics}}
The first detailed formulation of "Unity of Existence" (''wahdat al-wujud'') is closely associated to [[Ibn Arabi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wahdat al-Wuj√ªd|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ibn-arabi/#WahAlWuj|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widely different interpretations of the meaning of the "Unity of Existence" have been proposed throughout the centuries by critics, defenders, and Western scholars. Ibn Arabi himself didn't use the term "Unity of Existence" and similar statements had been made by those before him. For example, according to [[al-Ghazali]] "There is nothing in wujud [existence] except God...Wujud [Existence] only belongs to the Real One". Ghazali explains that the fruit of spiritual ascent of the Sufi is to "witness that there is no existence in the world save God and that 'All things are perishing except his face' (Qur'an 28:88)" &lt;ref&gt;Amin Banani, Richard G. Hovannisian, Georges Sabagh (1994), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EoIMW"&gt;[[William Chittick]], ''Wahdat Al-Wujud'', Encyclopedia of Islam and the Muslim World, p. 727&lt;/ref&gt;

Many authors consider being or existence to be the proper designation for the reality of God. While all Muslims believe the reality of God to be one, critics hold that the term "existence" (wujud) is also used for the existence of things in this world and that the doctrine blurs the distinction between the existence of the creator and that of the creation. Defenders argued that Ibn Arabi and his followers are offering a "subtle metaphysics following the line of the Asharite formula: "The attributes are neither God nor other than God." God's "signs" (ayat) and "traces" (athar)‚Äîthe creatures‚Äîare neither the same as God nor different from him, because God must be understood as both absent and present, both transcendent and immanent. Understood correctly, wahdat al-wujud elucidates the delicate balance that needs to be maintained between these two perspectives."&lt;ref name="EoIMW"/&gt; Shah Wali Allah of Delhi argued that the Ibn Arabi's "unity of being" was experiential and based on a subjective experience of illumination or ecstasy, rather than an ontological reality.&lt;ref&gt;John Esposito (1998), p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!----
===Consensus on Tanzih===
{{main|Tanzih}}
There is consensus among Hadith, Islamic scholars, philosophers and Sufis in one important issue, which is called [[Tanzih]](transcendence).

Qur'an says, "There is nothing whatever like unto Him."(Sura {{cite quran|42|11|style=nosup|expand=no}}))

[[Muhammad]], the Prophet of Islam, says, "Didn't know the God whoever resemble him to his creatures."&lt;ref&gt;"ŸÖÿß ÿπÿ±ŸÅ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ŸÖŸÜ ÿ¥ÿ®ŸáŸá ÿ®ÿÆŸÑŸÇŸá"  al-Saduq (1386), Al-Tawhid, Tehran, p. 50 &lt;/ref&gt;

 Ali, one the earliest and prominent companions, says

Avicenna who tried to posit the existence of God through philosophical way says &lt;blockquote&gt;So it's clear that [[the First]](al-Awwal) doesn't have any type, essence, quality, quantity, place, time, similar, partner and opposite, he's exalted and majestic. He doesn't have any restriction and there isn't any arguments for [or against] [[existence of God|him]].&lt;ref&gt;¬´ŸÅŸÇÿØ Ÿàÿ∂ÿ≠ ÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿßŸàŸÑ ŸÑÿß ÿ¨ŸÜÿ≥ ŸÑŸá Ÿà ŸÑÿß ŸÖÿßŸáŸäÿ© ŸÑŸá Ÿà ŸÑÿß ŸÉŸäŸÅŸäÿ© ŸÑŸá Ÿà ŸÑÿß ŸÉŸÖŸäÿ© ŸÑŸá Ÿà ŸÑÿß ÿßŸäŸÜ ŸÑŸá Ÿà ŸÑÿß ŸÖÿ™Ÿâ ŸÑŸá Ÿà ŸÑÿß ŸÜÿØŸÑŸá Ÿà ŸÑÿß ÿ¥ÿ±ŸäŸÉ ŸÑŸá Ÿà ŸÑÿß ÿ∂ÿØŸÑŸáÿå ÿ™ÿπÿßŸÑŸâ Ÿà ÿ¨ŸÑŸàÿßŸÜŸá ŸÑÿß ÿ≠ÿØ ŸÑŸá Ÿà ŸÑÿß ÿ®ÿ±ŸáÿßŸÜ ÿπŸÑŸäŸá¬ª.

== Influences on the Muslim culture ==

The Islamic doctrine of Tawhid puts forth a God whose rule, will or law are comprehensive and extend to all creatures and to all aspects of the human life. Early Muslims understood religion to thus cover the domains of state, law and society.&lt;ref name="Esp24"&gt;[[John Esposito]] (1998), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that the entirety of the Islamic teaching rests on the principle of Tawhid.&lt;ref name="Tariq Ramadan 2005, p. 203"/&gt; In the following, we provide a few examples of the influences of Tawhid on the Muslim culture:

===Interpersonal relationship===
According to the Qur'an, one consequence of properly conceived relationship between God and man as the served and servant, is the proper relationship among humans. In order to achieve the former, the Qur'an consistently "reminds" men of two points: 1. That God is one; everything except God (including the entirety of nature) is contingent upon God. 2. With all His might and glory, God is essentially the all-merciful God.&lt;ref&gt;Fazlur Rahman (1980), p. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Good and evil===
According to the Qur'an, Allah is the progenitor of all things, both good and evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|4|78|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt; As is written in the Qur'an, all of humanity is created at the will of Allah, both the good and the evil; and that their natures have been predisposed as such since the beginning of creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|28|68|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Quran|37|96|s=r}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Qur'an, Satan deviated from the oneness of Allah in the story of [[The Creation of Adam|creation of man]] by permitting his own hierarchical value system to supersede Allah's will: Allah asked the angels to bow to Adam, who he had created from clay. Satan refused, saying that "I am better than him; you created me from fire and created him from clay". The Medieval [[List of Muslim scholars|Muslim scholar]], [[Al-Ghazali]] pointing out that the only legitimate "preference principle" in the sight of Allah is piety, writes: "Every time a rich man believes that he is better than a poor one, or a white man believes that he is better than a black one, then he is being arrogant. He is adopting the same hierarchical principles adopted by Iblis [Satan] in his jahl [ignorance], and thus falling into shirk [opposite of Tawhid]." &lt;ref&gt;Azizah Al-Hibri (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Secularism]]===
In many jurisdictions of the world, the laws and the general attitude of the population hold that the sphere of public life should be [[secular state|secular]], and that belief in and practice of religion should remain in the sphere of private life. One motive for adopting this stance has been to reduce the effects of conflict between followers of different religions or between adherents of secularism and those of a religion. In public life, this view insists that the authority of the state prevails over any religious authorities.

For some Islamic thinkers, these propositions infringe the doctrine of Tawhid, and are therefore anathema. If the cosmos is a unified and harmonious whole, centered around the omnipotent and omnipresent God, they hold that recognising any other authority as superior is wrong. According to one writer: "Traditionally, a Muslim is not a nationalist, or citizen of a nation-state; he has no political identity, only a religious membership in the [[Ummah|Umma]]. For a traditional Muslim, Islam is the sole and sufficient identification tag and [[nationalism]] and nation-states are obstacles".&lt;ref&gt;Ozay Mehmet (1990), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the idea of creating a wholly Islamic state, or a revived caliphate. 

In practice, nearly all Muslims live their daily lives under some national jurisdiction and accept at least part of the constraints this involves.

===Islamic art===
The desire to preserve the unity and transcendence of God led to the prohibition of Muslims from creating representation or visual depictions of God, or of any Prophet including Muhammad. Representations in art of the human form are a disputed matter in [[fiqh]]. The key concern is that the use of statues or images may lead to idolatry. The dominant forms of expression in the Islamic art, thus, became calligraphy and arabesque.&lt;ref name="Esp24"/&gt;

'''·π¨hƒÅnissaro Bhikkhu''' (also known as '''Ajahn Geoff'''; born {{birth date|1949|12|28|df=y}}) is an American [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monk]]. Belonging to the [[Thai Forest Tradition]], for 22 years he studied under the forest master [[Ajahn Fuang Jotiko]] (himself a student of [[Ajahn Lee]]). Since 1993 he has served as abbot of the [[Metta Forest Monastery]] in [[San Diego County, California]] ‚Äî the first monastery in the Thai Forest Tradition in the US ‚Äî which he cofounded with [[Ajahn Suwat Suvaco]].{{sfn|Roether|1995}}

·π¨hƒÅnissaro Bhikkhu is perhaps best known for his translations of the ''[[Dhammapada]]'' and the ''[[Sutta Pitaka]]'' - almost 1000 [[sutra|suttas]] in all - providing the majority of the sutta translations for the reference website [[Access to Insight]],&lt;ref name="ati-faq"&gt;{{cite web | title = Access to Insight: Translators | url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/translators.html | website = Access to Insight (Legacy Edition) | accessdate = September 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for his translations from the [[dhamma]] talks of the Thai forest ajahns.

== Biography ==
{{Western Buddhism}}
{{Expand section|date=January 2016}}

===Early life===
·π¨hƒÅnissaro Bhikkhu was born Geoffrey DeGraff in 1949 and was introduced to the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]'s teaching on the [[Four Noble Truths]] as a high schooler, during a plane ride from the Philippines.&lt;ref name="orloff-2004"/&gt; Tricycle writes: "he grew up 'a very serious, independent little kid", spending his early childhood on a potato farm on Long Island, New York, and later living in the suburbs of Washington, D.C.{{sfn|Tricycle|1998}}

===Time at Oberlin===
At Oberlin College in the early 1970s, "he eschewed campus political activism because 'I didn't feel comfortable following a crowd.' For him, the defining issue of the day wasn't Vietnam, but a friend's attempted suicide."{{sfn|Tricycle|1998}} ·π¨hƒÅnissaro took a religious studies class when he found out there was meditation involved. ·π¨hƒÅnissaro writes: "I saw it as a skill I could master, whereas Christianity only had prayer, which was pretty hit-or-miss."{{sfn|Tricycle|1998}}

===First trip to Thailand===
After graduating in 1971 with a degree in European Intellectual History from [[Oberlin College]],{{cn|date=July 2017}} he traveled on a university fellowship to Thailand.{{cn|date=July 2017}} After a two-year search ·π¨hƒÅnissaro found a forest teacher ‚Äî [[Ajahn Fuang Jotiko]], a [[Kammatthana]] monk who studied under [[Ajahn Lee|Ajahn Lee Dhammadaro]] ‚Äî who insisted that his scholarly American student put his books aside.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

After a brief stay with the teacher was cut short by malaria, he returned to the U.S. to weigh the merits of academia and monasticism.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

===Return to Thailand===
·π¨hƒÅnissaro states that when he returned to Thailand he originally planned on becoming a monk tentatively for five years. When he said that he wanted to be ordained, Ajahn Fuang made him promise to either "succeed in the meditation or die in Thailand. There was to be no equivocating."{{sfn|Roether|1995}} ·π¨hƒÅnissaro felt certain upon hearing this.

===Time with Ajahn Fuang===
By ·π¨hƒÅnissaro's third year ordained as a monk, he became Ajahn Fuang's attendant. Ajahn Fuang's case of [[psoriasis]] deteriorated. It reached a point where Taan Geoff had to be at his side constantly.

·π¨hƒÅnissaro writes: "When I talked with Ajahn Fuang about going back to the West, about taking the tradition to America, he was very explicit. 'This will probably be your life's work,' he said. He felt, as many teachers have, that the forest tradition would die out in Thailand but would then take root in the West."{{sfn|Roether|1995}}

===Posting at Wat Metta===
Before Ajahn Fuang's death in 1986, he expressed his wish for Ajahn Geoff to become abbot of Wat Dhammasathit. 
·π¨hƒÅnissaro says that in spite of Ajahn Fuang's wish there were a lot of people maneuvering to become abbot.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} After Ajahn Fuang died, Wat Dhammasathit had already come far from the outlying forest hermitage that Taan Geoff had once arrived at. ·π¨hƒÅnissaro said: "Ajahn Fuang said to keep moving; this is not a tradition that works well in big groups." Taan Geoff declined the offer of abbot of Wat Dhammasathit, which came with strings attached, and no authority since he was a Westerner in a monastery founded by and for Thai monks.

Instead of taking that position, he travelled to [[San Diego County]] in 1991, upon request of [[Ajahn Suwat Suvaco]], where he helped start [[Metta Forest Monastery]].&lt;ref name="orloff-2004"/&gt; He became abbot of the monastery in 1993.&lt;ref name="bullitt-2008"&gt;{{cite web | title = Contributing Authors and Translators: Biographical Notes | url = http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/index.html#than | website = Access to Insight (Legacy Edition) | accessdate = August 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Ajahn Geoff became the first American-born, non-Thai [[bhikkhu]] to be given the title, authority, and responsibility of Preceptor (Upajjhaya) in the Dhammayut Order. He also serves as Treasurer of that order in the United States.

===Classical Buddhist modernism===

====Views on commentarial meditation practice====
·π¨hƒÅnissaro rejects the practice of [[kasina]] outlined in the [[Visuddhimagga]], and warns against forms of "deep jhana" practiced by contemporary meditation teachers who draw from the commentaries. ·π¨hƒÅnissaro calls these meditations "wrong concentration", and says that they have no basis in the [[Pali Canon]], which he argues should be considered ultimately authoritative.{{sfn|Quli|2008}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jhanas, Concentration, and Wisdom|url=http://www.dhammatalks.net/Books/Bhikkhu_Thanissaro_Jhanas_Concentration_Wisdom.htm|publisher=DhammaTalks.net|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forest as teacher and Buddhist counterculture===
·π¨hƒÅnissaro talks about the importance of the forest to give rise to the qualities of mind necessary to succeed in Buddhist practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Customs of the Noble Ones|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/customs.html|publisher=Access to Insight|accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Roether writes:

{{blockquote|Like Thoreau, Thanissaro Bhikkhu has founded a kind of Walden as the Abbot of the [[Metta Forest Monastery]] near San Diego, the first Thai forest tradition monastery in this country. Just as the utopian movement in America was sparked by the advent of the industrial revolution, the forest tradition of Theravada Buddhism was developed in Thailand around the turn of the century by Ajahn Mun Bhuridatto in reaction to the increasing urbanization of the Buddhist monastic communities there. Forest monks abandoned the heavy social demands of the city and devoted themselves to meditation instead.{{sfn|Roether|1995}}}}

'''''The Future of an Illusion''''' ({{lang-de|Die Zukunft einer Illusion}}) is a 1927 work by [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of [[psychoanalysis]], in which Freud discusses religion's origins, development, and its future. He provides a psychoanalysis of [[religion]], which he views as a false [[belief system]].

==Summary==
Freud defines religion as an illusion, consisting of "certain dogmas, assertions about facts and conditions of external and internal reality which tells one something that one has not oneself discovered, and which claim that one should give them credence." Religious concepts are transmitted in three ways and thereby claim our belief. "Firstly because our primal ancestors already believed them; secondly, because we possess proofs  which have been handed down to us from antiquity, and thirdly because it is forbidden to raise the question of their authenticity at all."  Psychologically speaking, these beliefs present the phenomena of wish fulfillment, "fulfillments of the oldest, strongest, and most urgent wishes of mankind." (Ch. 6 pg.38).

Among these are the necessity to cling to the existence of the father, the prolongation of earthly existence by a future life, and the immortality of the human soul. To differentiate between an illusion and an error, Freud lists scientific beliefs such as "''[[Aristotle]]'s belief that vermin are developed out of dung''" (pg.39) as errors, but "''the assertion made by certain nationalists that the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Germanic]] race is the only one capable of civilization''" is an [[illusion]], simply because of the wishing involved. Put forth more explicitly, "''what is characteristic of illusions is that they are derived from human wishes''." (pg. 39)

Freud adds, however, that, "Illusions need not necessarily be false." (pg.39)  He gives the example of a middle-class girl having the illusion that a prince will marry her.  While this is unlikely, it is not impossible.  The fact that it is grounded in her wishes is what makes it an illusion.

Freud explains religion in a similar term to that of [[totemism]]. The individual is essentially an enemy of society&lt;ref&gt;Freud uses the German word ''Kultur''. It has been translated sometimes as "culture" and sometimes as "civilization", denoting as it does a concept intermediate between these and at times inclusive of both.&lt;/ref&gt; and has instinctual urges that must be restrained to help society function. "Among these instinctual wishes are those of incest, cannibalism, and lust for killing." (pg. 10)

Freud's view of [[human nature]] is that it is anti-social, rebellious, and has high sexual and [[death drive|destructive tendencies]]. The destructive nature of humans sets a pre-inclination for disaster when humans must interact with others in society. "''For masses are lazy and unintelligent; they have no love for instinctual renunciation, and they are not to be convinced by argument of its inevitability; and the individuals composing them support one another in giving free rein to their indiscipline''." (pg. 7)

So destructive is human nature, he claims, that "''it is only through the influence of individuals who can set an example and whom masses recognize as their leaders that they can be induced to perform the work and undergo the renunciations on which the existence of [[civilization]] depends''." (pg. 8) All this sets a terribly [[Bellum omnium contra omnes|hostile society]] that could implode if it were not for civilizing forces and developing government.

He elaborates further on the development of religion, as the emphasis on acquisition of wealth and the satisfaction of instinctual drives (sex, wealth, glory, happiness, immortality) moves from "the material to the mental." As compensation for good behaviors, religion promises a reward.

In Freud's view, religion is an outshoot of the [[Oedipus complex]], and represents man's helplessness in the world, having to face the ultimate fate of death, the struggle of civilization, and the forces of nature. He views God as a manifestation of a childlike "longing for [a] father." (pg. 18)

Freud's description of religious belief as a form of illusion is based on the idea that it is derived from human wishes with no basis in reality. He says, "Thus we call a belief an illusion when a wish-fulfillment is a prominent factor in its motivation, and in doing so we disregard its relations to reality, just as the illusion itself sets no store by verification."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Future of an Illusion|last = Sigmund|first = Freud|publisher = W.W. Norton and Company|year = 1990|isbn = 0-393-00831-2|location = 500 Fitth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10110|pages = 40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Freud's words "The gods retain the threefold task: they must exorcise the terrors of nature, they must reconcile men to the cruelty of Fate, particularly as it is shown in death, and they must compensate them for the sufferings and privations which a civilized life in common has imposed on them." (pg. 19)

==Reception==
Freud sent a copy of ''The Future of an Illusion'' to his friend [[Romain Rolland]]. While Rolland generally agreed with Freud's assessment of religion, he questioned whether Freud had discovered the true source of religious sentiment, which he ascribed to an [[Oceanic feeling|"oceanic" feeling]].&lt;ref&gt;Gay, Peter. ''Freud: A Life for Our Time''. Papermac, 1995, p. 544.&lt;/ref&gt; The psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]], the founder of [[analytical psychology]], wrote in ''[[Symbols of Transformation]]'' that ''The Future of an Illusion'' "gives the best possible account" of Freud's earlier views, "which move within the confines of the outmoded rationalism and scientific materialism of the late nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl. ''Symbols of Transformation: An Analysis of the Prelude to a Case of Schizophrenia''. Princeton University Press, 1990, p. xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; The critic [[Harold Bloom]], writing in ''[[The American Religion]]'' (1992), calls ''The Future of an Illusion'' "one of the great failures of religious criticism." Bloom believes that Freud underestimated religion and was therefore unable to criticize it effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold. ''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation''. Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, some scholars see Freud's arguments as a manifestation of the [[genetic fallacy]], in which a belief is considered false or inverifiable based on its origin.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the American Academy of Religion 1978 XLVI(3):351-368; {{doi|10.1093/jaarel/XLVI.3.351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''U-Vistract''' is a [[pyramid scheme]] created by [[Noah Musingku]] in [[Papua New Guinea]] (PNG) around 1999 as a means of providing a [[sovereign wealth fund|sovereign wealth source]] for an independent [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]]. Eventually, it was established, and expelled, from [[Australia]], PNG, [[Solomon Islands]], but continues to exist in some form in the island [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] under the rule of Musingku as [[Noah Musingku|King David Peii II]].

==Description==
U-Vistract is considered by many to be a [[Ponzi scheme]]. The founders have stated that the plan has always been to back the assets of the plan with the in-ground natural resources, including copper, silver, gold, zinc and other products.

==Formation of U-Vistract==
In 1997, seven years after the unilateral [[declaration of independence]], the [[Bougainville Revolutionary Army]] was fully in control of the island, but its leadership was starting to split into different factions. [[Francis Ona]] continued in full control of the army, and intended to achieve full independence. His co-president in the [[Bougainville Interim Government]], [[Joseph Kabui]], was seeking rapprochement with PNG and formation of an [[Autonomous Bougainville Government]], while the army General [[Sam Kauona]] had his own path. Musingku met with each of them as a mediator, and by 19 December had signed agreements with each. They realized that it would be impossible to join the three parties together without a source of funding, and that it would be impossible to achieve political independence without financial sovereignty.&lt;ref name=7-10&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%207.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706151616/http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%207.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Papala Chronicles Issue 7 p 10&lt;/ref&gt; As Musingku‚Äôs wrote,

:‚Äô‚ÄôIn other words, [[Bougainville Island|Bougainville]] needed to create her own independent and sovereign system in order to be free from the control of the other international financial and governing structure. Also, it was very clear that the funds we needed to work with in uprooting, pulling down, destroying and overthrowing the existing foreign control system could not be earned through the conventional system. A new international system needed to be established whose control and coordination would not be based overseas but right here on our own soil.‚Äô‚Äô&lt;ref name=7-10/&gt;

Thus began the creation of the U-Vistract System. At first, the ‚ÄúU-Vistract Mission‚Äù was established as a Christian mission program in Australia. After Musingku was arrested and publicly denigrated&lt;ref name=15-9&gt;[http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%2015.pdf] Papala Chronicles Issue 15 p 9&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] (ASIC) for an unlicensed securities and investment program, churches continued to invest.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On October 19th 1999 in one of my trips to [[Australia]] the ASIC placed me under house-arrest‚Ä¶.After a heavy interrogatory session they demanded me to shut down all my operations in the country. The ASIC publicized the matter in the media to let the world of Australia know about the so-called illegal operations. However, U-Vistract grew even stronger, gaining momentum almost overnight. The number of my agencies grew in Kempsey, Sydney, Brisbane, Gold coast, etc."&lt;ref name=15-9/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From Australia, Musingku took his U-Vistract program to Pt Moresby, Papua New Guinea. While in Pt Moresby, he attempted to set up a bank in the old Hawaiian Bank building, but he was shut down by the PNG government and forced to leave to the Solomon Islands. He began again to set up his system, but the Australian police in the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands ([[RAMSI]]) forced him out. In 2003 he travelled to Ona‚Äôs headquarters in Guava, [[Panguna]], Bougainville, and established a bank there. Two years later he was able to travel to his ancestral village of Tonu, where he established his bank headquarters in an old cattle farm owned by the paramount chief. This, he said, was the manger from which would issue salvation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%2014.pdf] Papala Chronicles Issue 14 p 9&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Throughout the process we were on the lookout for an ideal government that would allow us to fit our system into it without unnecessary restrictions, terms or conditions. Our search around the world could not locate any such government. ''
:''The answer was right here on Bougainville. However, it could not be the Autonomous government as she was already defiled with a foreign partner. Meekamui was clearly the only one that fitted our descriptions and expectations.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%202.pdf] Papala Chronicles Issue 2&lt;/ref&gt;

:''All other governments including Australia, PNG, Solomon Islands, etc, could not fit into this description as they already had other software programs &lt;ref &lt;ref group="nb"&gt;&gt; Musingku refers to nations as hardware, and their forms of government as software&lt;/ref&gt; fitted into them. Australia repelled us in 2000. PNG pushed us out in 1999 and again in 2002.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%208.pdf] Papala Chronicles Issue 8 p.&amp;nbsp;9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion==
:The PNG government under advice from its foreign controllers such as the [[World Bank]] and [[International Monetary Fund]] had tried everything possible to block our way forward,&lt;ref name=issue3&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%203.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706145122/http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%203.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Papala Chronicles Issue 3&lt;/ref&gt;

:Others merely saw us as nobodies, pyramid schemes, conmen, and cargo/religious cults, etc. They did not realize that we were busy growing and extending our branches around the world, establishing a new international system of governance, monetary and banking.&lt;ref name=issue3/&gt;

U-V was established in several countries besides Bougainville. In 2002, it was already in 4 nations, including PNG.&lt;ref name=issue3/&gt; Its branches were considered to be branches of a government, with governors of different districts and regions in foreign nations. Along with a system of banks, branches and governorships in several countries, U-Vistract established an ‚Äúalternate UN‚Äù called ‚Äò‚Äô‚ÄôRoyal Assembly of Nations and Kingdoms‚Äô‚Äô‚Äô. Emissaries were sent from U-Vistract and RAONK to several nations, including Papua New Guinea, [[Fiji]], Solomon Islands, the UK and Netherlands.

==Implementation and operation==
Initially, deposits were made in several currencies into bank accounts. Later, accounts were offered in ordinary and several high-yield investment categories.

In 2005 in Bougainville, the U-Vistract system began using bank cards to allow members to purchase goods in ‚ÄúU-Vistract‚Äôs Royal International Trade and Commerce System‚Äù. Merchants were promised reimbursement for member purchases.

: ‚ÄúBased on your bulging balances and bank statements, we will arrange with them a similar transaction program. If you want a car, truck or similar we will make similar arrangements with those who are registered with our system overseas and import your vehicles for you. Once you have decided on your choice we will arrange with suppliers and import them for you‚Äù, the King said. Similar arrangements can be done for clients wanting housing and building supplies who will pick from different housing designs and once they have made their choice, the U-Vistract system will import these items for them direct from suppliers and warehouses and credit their accounts from the clients‚Äô accounts with the RIBM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%209.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706154154/http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%209.pdf |archivedate=6 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }} Papala Chronicles Issue 9 p 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement==
:''U-Vistract was a financial lending pyramid scheme into which approximately 60,000 Bougainvilleans invested.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/jul2000/png-j06.shtml] McKenzie, Stan, World Socialist Website, ‚Äò‚ÄôPapua New Guinea fast money schemes: a financial house of cards collapses‚Äô‚Äô, accessed 16 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monitor.upeace.org/archive.cfm?id_article=748 Peace and Conflict Monitor]&lt;/ref&gt;

:W''ithin a few years, some 70,000 Papua New Guineans had deposited K350 million into U-Vistract alone. U-Vistract also attracted followers in Australia, Solomon Islands and Fiji. In Australia, a small number of Queensland investors contributed some AUD500,000 between July and October 1999‚Ä¶ This drew the attention of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), which stopped the further spread of the scheme and required U-Vistract to return the money to its investors ''(ASIC, 1999).&lt;ref name="SSGM"&gt;[http://www.csrm.uq.edu.au/docs/SSGM_09_05_bainton_cox.pdf] (Australian Securities and Investments Commission 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Initially, U-Vistract had support from the PNG Government, led by Prime Minister Bill Skate. Skate‚Äôs Treasurer, Iairo Lasaro, exempted U-Vistract and nine other fast money schemes from the requirements of the Financial Institutions Act. Skate and his Deputy are said to have been large investors in U-Vistract and Money Rain. Many Papua New Guineans believe it was their extravagant investments (of public money) that exhausted the schemes‚Äô capacity to pay‚Ä¶.;;

:''Musingku defied court orders and continued to operate. He was declared bankrupt (Post- Courier, 15 June 2000) and subsequently charged with contempt of court for continuing to solicit deposits. Musingku attempted to set up another money scheme, the ‚ÄúRoyal Reserve Bank of Papala‚Äù, but police and BPNG officials raided the new pseudo-bank and closed it down. In 2002, Musingku fled to Bougainville and thence to Solomon Islands.''

One U-Vistract official said that ‚Äúonly born-again Christians would be paid‚Äù since only they could handle wealth morally.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.csrm.uq.edu.au/docs/SSGM_09_05_bainton_cox.pdf] (Post-Courier, 31 May 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present status==
In 2010, the International Bank of Me‚Äôekamui,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibom.biz] www.ibom.biz&lt;/ref&gt; one of Musingku‚Äôs bank group, established relations with a group of companies and individuals engaged in commerce outside of the usual financial system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialhope.info www.financialhope.info]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zcash.org www.zcash.org]&lt;/ref&gt; This group has provided billions of dollars in capital to U-Vistract through IBOM, and provided the means for capitalization of the in-ground assets that Bougainville contains, while IBOM has provided access to the international banking system.

A new, gold backed currency is pending issuance. It will be a gold-backed ‚ÄúKina‚Äù (not PNG Kina) worth 1 gm of gold. Currently, the exchange is the UVD at 10 USD to 1 UVD,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibom.biz/public%20docos/Issue%204.pdf] Papala Chronicles Issue 4&lt;/ref&gt; now at 1&amp;nbsp;mg gold. This issue will include bills with the likenesses of Muskingku/King David, as well as Jesus Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/uvistract-conman-offers-jesus-money-20090708-dcuu.html U-Vistract conman offers 'Jesus money']&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Bougainvillians believed that Noah Muskingku is a Self -Proclaimed King who hides from the Legitimate Government Authority as he had deceived the ordinary people of PNG and other nations to invest in his failed financial scheme. His lust to form his own Government has no foundation as he only depends on the current government to provide goods and service to his people.

'''Varsken''' ([[Middle Persian]]: ''Vazgƒìn'') was an [[Iranian people|Iranian]] prince from the [[Mihranids|Mihranid family]] of [[Gardman]], who served as the [[viceroy]] of [[Gugark]] from 470 to 482. He was the son and successor of [[Arshusha II]]. Varsken was a highly regarded man among the Iranians, and played a leading role in the [[Sasanians]] effort to [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrianize]] [[Caucasus]], which even made him murder his own wife [[Shushanik]] and attack [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]], which resulted in his death at the hands of the troops of the [[Chosroid Dynasty|Chosroid]] ruler [[Vakhtang I of Iberia|Vakhtang I]] in 482.

== Origins ==
Varsken belonged to the Mihranid family of Gardman. The family claimed [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian Persian]] descent, but were in reality a branch of the [[Seven Parthian clans|Parthian]] [[House of Mihran|Mihranid family]] of [[Ray, Iran|Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bosworth|1986|pp=520‚Äì522}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chamont|1985|pp=806‚Äì810}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the family of Varsken originally practiced [[Zoroastrianism]], it converted to [[Christianity]] during the family's service in Caucasus.

== Biography ==
[[Image:Historical regions of Greater Armenia.png|right|thumb|Map of Greater Armenia, which includes [[Gugark]]]]
Varsken's mother was Anushvram Artsruni, an [[Armenians|Armenian]] noblewomen from the [[Artsruni|Artsruni family]], who was the sister-in-law of the Armenian aristocrat [[Hmayeak Mamikonian]], himself brother of the Armenian rebel and martyr [[Vardan Mamikonian]]. Varsken's father, Arshusha II, was a hostage of the [[Sasanian]] court at [[Ctesiphon]], and could not participate in the Christian Armenian rebellion in 451, led by Vardan Mamikonian. After the defeat of the Armenian rebels at [[Battle of Avarayr|Avarayr]], Hmayeak Mamikonian was killed at [[Tao (historical region)|Tao]]. Hmayeak's sons, [[Vahan Mamikonian]], Vasak, [[Vard Mamikonian|Vard]] and Artaxias, were then taken hostage and sent to Ctesiphon, where they met Arshusha II.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grousset|1947|pp=193‚Äì202}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D√©d√©yan|2007|pp=189‚Äì190}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Arshusha was later able to buy his freedom back. He then freed the sons of Hmayeak, and took them back to [[Persian Armenia|Armenia]] with their mother. Later, Arshusha organized the wedding of his son Varsken with [[Shushanik]], daughter of Vardan Mamikonian.&lt;ref name="D√©deyan191"&gt;{{harvnb|D√©d√©yan|2007|p=191}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grousset|1947|p=213}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the death of his Arsusha, Varsken went to Ctesiphon with the Sasanian [[shah]] [[Peroz I]], and converted to the family's former religion, Zoroastrianism. He shortly married a daughter of Peroz and was given the governorship of [[Caucasian Albania]].{{sfn|Toumanoff|1963|p=262}} He later went back to Armenia, where he tried to force his first wife, Shushanik, to convert to Zoroastrianism, but the latter refused.

Varsken then threatened her to send her on a donkey to Ctesiphon, where she would get executed. Shushanik, however, once again refused, and eventually died from the violence inflicted by her husband.&lt;ref name="D√©deyan191" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grousset216"&gt;{{harvnb|Grousset|1947|p=216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Varsken later sought to conquer [[Kingdom of Iberia|Iberia]], and was given support by Peroz. In 482, Varsken invaded Iberia, but he was defeated and killed by its ruler [[Vakhtang I of Iberia|Vakhtang I]].&lt;ref name="Grousset216" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|D√©d√©yan|2007|p=192}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

' Vimalamitra' was more known to the Bhutanese and Tibetans as 'Penchen Vimalamitra' meaning 'the Great Pandita'. He was one of the eight teachers of the great Indian adept Guru [[Padmasambhava]]. Centuries later he was adopted as a literary character of [[Terma (religion)|terma]] and was attributed various works. Chatral Sangye Dorji (1913-2016) was said to have received a mala rosary from a man who was at the time dressed as an Indian Sadhu. It was only later that Rinpoche told his attendants that he received a mala on that day from Vimalamitra in real. The attendants were curious and went back to the place where they met a sadhu only to be left lost and I found. The sadhu was not to be found anywhere. One scholar remarked that the historical Vimalamitra "would have been astonished to find himself the focus of such a tradition."&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Ronald M. ''Tibetan Renaissance'', p. 229.

'''Vohu Manah''' ([[Avestan]]: ê¨¨ê¨äê¨µê¨é ê¨®ê¨Äê¨•ê¨Äê¨µ ''vohu manah'') &lt;!-- as IPA --&gt; is the [[Avestan language]] term for a [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] concept, generally translated as "Good Purpose", "Good Mind", or "Good Thought", referring to the good moral state of mind that enables an individual to accomplish his duties. Its Middle Persian equivalent, as attested in the [[Pahlavi script]] texts of Zoroastrian tradition, is '''Wahman''', which is a borrowing of the Avestan language expression and has the same meaning, and which continues in [[New Persian]] as '''Bahman''' and variants. Manah is cognate with the Sanskrit word Manas suggesting some commonality between the ideas of the [[Gathas]] and those of the [[Rigveda]]. The opposite of Vohu Manah is [[Aka Manah]], "evil purpose" or "evil mind".

The term is a compound of the words ''vohu'' "good" and ''manah'' "mind, thought, purpose", cognate with the [[Vedic Sanskrit|Vedic]] words [[wikt:‡§µ‡§∏‡•Å#Sanskrit|''v√°su'']] and [[wikt:‡§Æ‡§®‡§∏‡•ç#Sanskrit|''m√°nas'']], both with the same meaning. Both of these derive from [[Proto-Indo-Iranian language|Proto-Indo-Iranian]] [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-Iranian/Hw√°su≈°|''*Hw√°su≈°'']] and [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-Iranian/m√°nas|''*m√°nas'']], in turn from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/h‚ÇÅw√©sus|''*h‚ÇÅw√©sus'']] and [[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Indo-European/m√©nos|''*m√©nos'']].

In the [[Gathas]], the oldest texts of the [[Avesta]] and considered to be composed by [[Zoroaster]] himself, the term 'Vohu Manah' is not unambiguously used as a proper name and frequently occurs without the "Good" (''Vohu-'') prefix.

In the post-Gathic texts that expound the principles of Zoroastrian [[cosmogony]], Vohu Manah is an [[Amesha Spenta]], one of six "divine sparks" of [[Ahura Mazda]] that each represent one facet of creation. In the case of Vohu Manah, this is all animal creation, with a particular stress on [[Cattle in religion|cattle]]. Vohu Manah is of neutral gender in Avestan grammar but in Zoroastrian tradition is considered masculine.

In the [[Zoroastrian calendar]], the second day of each month as well as the eleventh month of each year are dedicated to Vohu Manah. In the [[Iranian calendar|Iranian civil calendar]], which inherits the names of the months from the Zoroastrian calendar, the 11th month is likewise named Bahman.

The [[Achaemenid]] emperor [[Artaxerxes II]] (as it is rendered in Greek) had 'Vohu Manah' as the second part of his throne name, which when "translated" into Greek appeared as 'Mnemon'. New Persian ''Bahman'' remains a theophoric in present-day Iranian and Zoroastrian tradition.

[[File:White horse from air.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Bronze Age|3,000-year-old]] [[Uffington White Horse]] [[hill figure]] in England.]]
'''White horses''' have a special significance in the [[mythology|mythologies]] of cultures around the world. They are often associated with the [[sun chariot]],&lt;ref name="Tresidder"&gt;''The Complete Dictionary of Symbols'' by Jack Tresidder, Chronicle Books, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-8118-4767-4}}, page 241. [https://books.google.com/books?id=MV25OktTqLIC&amp;dq Google books copy]&lt;/ref&gt; with warrior-heroes, with fertility (in both [[mare]] and [[stallion]] manifestations), or with an [[end time|end-of-time]] saviour, but other interpretations exist as well. Both [[white (horse)|truly white horses]] and the more common [[gray (horse)|grey horses]], with completely white hair coats, were identified as "white" by various religious and cultural traditions.

==Portrayal in myth==
[[Image:Kalki Avatar.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Hindu world saviour [[Kalki]] with his white Horse.  Punjab Hills, Guler, c. 1765.]]
 
From earliest times, white horses have been mythologised as possessing exceptional properties, transcending the normal world by having wings (e.g. [[Pegasus]] from Greek mythology), or having horns (the [[unicorn]]). As part of its legendary dimension, the white horse in myth may be depicted with seven heads ([[Uchaishravas]]) or eight feet ([[Sleipnir]]), sometimes in groups or singly. There are also white horses which are divinatory, who prophesy or warn of danger.

As a rare or distinguished symbol, a white horse typically bears the hero- or god-figure in ceremonial roles or in triumph over negative forces. [[Herodotus]] reported that white horses were held as [[sacred animals]] in the [[Achaemenid]] court of [[Xerxes the Great]] (ruled 486‚Äì465 BC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archaeology.about.com/b/2008/07/20/white-horses-and-genetics.htm |title=White Horses and Genetics |publisher=Archaeology.about.com |date= |accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in other traditions the reverse happens when it was sacrificed to the gods.

In more than one tradition, the white horse carries [[patron saints]] or the world saviour in the end times (as in [[Hindu eschatology|Hinduism]], [[Christian eschatology|Christianity]], and [[Islamic eschatology|Islam]]), is associated with the sun or sun chariot ([[Ossetia]]) or bursts into existence in a fantastic way, emerging from the sea or a lightning bolt.

Though some mythologies are stories from earliest beliefs, other tales, though visionary or metaphorical, are found in liturgical sources as part of preserved, on-going traditions (see, for example, "Iranian tradition" below).

==Mythologies and traditions==

===European===

====Celtic====
In [[Celtic mythology]], [[Rhiannon]], a mythic figure in the [[Mabinogion]] collection of legends, rides a "pale-white" horse.&lt;ref&gt;''The Four Branches of the Mabinogi: The Mabinogi of Pwyll'' by Will Parker (Bardic Press: 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-9745667-5-7}}. [http://www.mabinogi.net/pwyll.htm online text]. Retrieved November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, she has been linked to the Romano-Celtic fertility horse goddess [[Epona]] and other instances of the veneration of horses in early Indo-European culture.&lt;ref name="Hyland"&gt;[[Ann Hyland|Hyland, Ann]] (2003) ''The Horse in the Ancient World''. Stroud, Sutton Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7509-2160-9}}. Page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The-Winged-Horse.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bellerophon]] riding Pegasus]]
White horses are the most common type of [[hill figure]] in England. Though many are modern, the [[Uffington White Horse]] at least dates back to the [[Bronze Age]].

In Scottish folklore, the [[kelpie]] or [[each uisge]], a deadly supernatural water demon in the shape of a horse, is sometimes described as white, though other stories say it is black.

====Greek====
In [[Greek mythology]], the white winged horse [[Pegasus]] was the son of [[Poseidon]] and the [[gorgon]] [[Medusa]].  Poseidon was also the creator of horses, creating them out of the breaking waves when challenged to make a beautiful land animal.

====Norse====
[[File:Ardre Odin Sleipnir.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Tj√§ngvide image stone]] is thought to show Odin entering [[Valhalla]] riding on [[Sleipnir]].]]
In [[Norse mythology]], [[Odin]]'s eight-legged horse [[Sleipnir]], "the best horse among gods and men", is described as grey.&lt;ref name=FAULKES&gt;Faulkes, Anthony (Trans.) (1995). ''Edda'', page 36. [[Everyman's Library|Everyman]]. {{ISBN|0-460-87616-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sleipnir is also the ancestor of another grey horse, [[Grani]], who is owned by the hero [[Sigurd]].&lt;ref name=MORRIS&gt;[[William Morris|Morris, William]] (Trans.) and [[Eir√≠kr Magn√∫sson|Magn√∫sson, Eir√≠kr]] (Trans.) (2008). ''The Story of the Volsungs'', page 54. Forgotten Books. {{ISBN|1-60506-469-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Slavic====
In [[Slavic mythology]], the war and fertility deity [[Svantovit]] owned an oracular white horse; the historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]], in descriptions similar to those of [[Tacitus]] centuries before, says the priests divined the future by leading the white stallion between a series of fences and watching which leg, right or left, stepped first in each row.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veneti.info/en/articles/columns/203-the-trinity-j- The Trinity-–¢—Ä–æ—ò—Å—Ç–≤–æ-–¢—Ä–∏–≥–ª–∞–≤] @ veneti.info, quoting Saxo Grammaticus in the "Gesta Danorum".&lt;!-- still looking for a copy of the original. This site quotes it as follows: "The simulacrum of god Svetovit kept in his right hand a horn and in his left an arch... A white horse was dedicated to him, who could have been mounted or led to pasture by the temple priest only. The horse was also used for presages. When the people wanted to know the oracle concerning the next war, pales in three rows and in equal interwalls were set up before the temple. Then, after the prayers, the horse was led through the rows. If it began to step forward with the right foot, the prediction was propicious. When it only one-time made a step with the left foot, the prediction was inauspicious...." --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finno-Ugric====
One of the titles of God in [[Hungarian mythology]] was [[Had√∫r]], who, according to an unconfirmed source, wears pure copper and is a metalsmith. The Hungarian name for God was, and remains "Isten" and they followed Steppe [[Tengriism]].{{cn|date=October 2015}} The ancient [[Magyars]] sacrificed white stallions to him before a battle.&lt;ref name="Kover"&gt;''Peeps at Many Lands ‚Äì Hungary'' by H. T. Kover, READ BOOKS, 2007, {{ISBN|978-1-4067-4416-3}}, page 8. [https://books.google.com/books?id=zqYux2DF6AcC Google books copy]&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, there is a story (mentioned for example in ''[[Gesta Hungarorum]]'') that the Magyars paid a white horse to [[Moravia]]n chieftain [[Svatopluk I]] (in other forms of the story, it is instead the [[Bulgars|Bulgarian]] chieftain [[Salan]]) for a part of the land that later became the [[Kingdom of Hungary]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} 
Actual historical background of the story is dubious because Svatopluk I was already dead when the first Hungarian tribes arrived. On the other hand, even [[Herodotus]] mentions in his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' an Eastern custom, where sending a white horse as payment in exchange for land means [[casus belli]]. This custom roots in the ancient Eastern belief that stolen land would lose its fertility.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Iranian===
In [[Zoroastrianism]], one of the three representations of [[Tishtrya]], the [[Hypostasis (linguistics)|hypostasis]] of the star [[Sirius]], is that of a white stallion (the other two are as a young man, and as a bull). The divinity takes this form during the last 10 days of every month of the [[Zoroastrian calendar]], and also in a [[Cosmogony|cosmogonical]] battle for control of rain. In this latter tale (''[[Yasht]]'' 8.21‚Äì29), which appears in the [[Avesta]]'s hymns dedicated to Tishtrya, the divinity is opposed by [[Apaosha]], the demon of drought, which appears as a black stallion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brunner|first=Christopher J.|chapter=Ap≈ç≈°|title=Encyclopaedia Iranica|volume=2|year=1987|location=New York|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|pages=161‚Äì162|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

White horses are also said to draw divine chariots, such as that of [[Aredvi Sura Anahita]], who is the Avesta's divinity of the waters. Representing various forms of water, her four horses are named "wind", "rain", "clouds" and "sleet" (''[[Yasht]]'' 5.120).
&lt;!-- I've also removed a statement about the Saoshyant riding a white horse. If verifiable, such a statement could read: In Zoroastrian eschatology, the [[Saoshyant]] is said to ride a white horse during the final renovation of the world.--&gt;
&lt;!-- There was previously some stuff here about Raksh being white. That is not so. In Book 5 of the Shahnameh, which is where Raksh is described, the colt is said to be "the color of rose leaves upon a saffron field". If some source can be verified to interpret that as "white", then the statement could read: In Book 5 of the ''[[Shahnameh]]'', an Islamic-era text that preserves pre-Islamic oral tradition, [[Raksh]], the horse of the hero [[Rostam]], is described as "the color of rose leaves upon a saffron field". This has been interpreted to mean "white".[ref] --&gt;

===Hindu===

White horses appear many times in [[Hindu mythology]] and stand for the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kak |first1=Subhash |title=The A≈õvamedha: The Rite and Its Logic |date=2002 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishe |isbn=9788120818774 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ORuGLCLc7OkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=a%C5%9Bvamedh%C3%A1&amp;pg=PP11#v=onepage&amp;q=a%C5%9Bvamedh%C3%A1&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Vedas|Vedic]] [[horse sacrifice]] or ''[[Ashvamedha]]'' was a fertility and kingship ritual involving the sacrifice of a sacred grey or white stallion.&lt;ref name="Dallapiccola"&gt;''[[Dictionary of Hindu Lore and Legend]]'' by Anna L. Dallapiccola. Thames and Hudson, 2002. {{ISBN|0-500-51088-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar rituals may have taken place among Roman, Celtic and Norse people, but the descriptions are not so complete.

In the [[Puranas]], one of the precious objects that emerged while the [[Deva (Hinduism)|devas]] and [[asura|demons]] were [[Samudra manthan|churning the milky ocean]] was [[Uchaishravas]], a snow-white horse with seven heads.&lt;ref name="Dallapiccola"/&gt;Turaga was another divine white horse that emerged out of the ocean and taken by the sun god [[Surya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dalal |first1=Roshen |title=Hinduism: An Alphabetical Guide |date=2010 |publisher=Penguin Books India |isbn=9780143414216 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=DH0vmD8ghdMC&amp;lpg=PA426&amp;dq=white%20horse%20hinduism&amp;pg=PA424#v=onepage&amp;q=white%20horse%20hinduism&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=bigelow |first1=mason |title=Isles of Wonder: the cover story |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=9781326407360 |url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=uzM1DwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA401&amp;dq=uchchaihshravas&amp;pg=PA401#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uchaishravas was at times ridden by [[Indra]], lord of the devas.

The chariot of the solar deity [[Surya]] is drawn by seven horses, alternately described as all white, or as the colours of the rainbow.

[[Hayagriva]] the [[Avatar]] of [[Vishnu]] is worshipped as the God of knowledge and wisdom, with a human body and a horse's head, brilliant white in colour, with white garments and seated on a white lotus. [[Kalki]], the tenth [[Dasavatara|incarnation of Vishnu]] and final world saviour, is predicted to appear riding a white horse, or in the form of a white horse.&lt;ref name="Dallapiccola"/&gt;

===Buddhist===
[[Kanthaka]] was a white horse that was a royal servant and favourite horse of Prince Siddhartha, who later became [[Gautama Buddha]]. Siddhartha used Kanthaka in all major events described in [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] texts prior to his renunciation of the world. Following the departure of Siddhartha, it was said that Kanthaka died of a broken heart.&lt;ref name="encyc"&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Buddhism| last = Malasekera| first = G.

===Abrahamic===

====Jewish====
The [[Book of Zechariah]] twice mentions coloured horses; in the first passage there are three colours (red, dappled, and ''white''), and in the second there are four teams of horses (red, black, ''white'', and finally dappled) pulling chariots. The second set of horses are referred to as "the four spirits of heaven, going out from standing in the presence of the Lord of the whole world." They are described as patrolling the earth and keeping it peaceful.

====Christian====

In the [[New Testament]], the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]] include one seated on a white horse&lt;ref&gt;New Testament: Book of Revelation, Ch 6:2 (NIV)&lt;/ref&gt; and one on a pale horse ‚Äì the "white" horse carried the rider Conquest (traditionally, Pestilence) while the "pale" horse carried the rider Death.&lt;ref&gt;New Testament: Book of Revelation, Ch 6:8 (NIV)&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Greek word ''chloros'', translated as ''pale,'' is often interpreted as sickly green or ashen grey rather than white. Later in the [[Book of Revelation]], Christ rides a white horse out of [[heaven]] at the head of the armies of heaven to judge and make war upon the earth.&lt;ref&gt;New Testament: Book of Revelation, Ch 19:11-6 (NIV)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic culture]] tells of a white creature named ''[[Buraq|Al-Buraq]]'' who brought [[Muhammad]] to [[Jerusalem]] during the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]]. Al-Buraq was also said to transport [[Abraham]] ([[Abraham in Islam|Ibr√¢h√Æm]]) when he visited his wife [[Hagar]] ([[Hagar in Islam|HƒÅjar]]) and son [[Ishmael]] ([[Ishmael in Islam|Ism√¢'√Æl]]). According to tradition, Abraham lived with one wife ([[Sarah]]) in [[Syria]], but Al-Buraq would transport him in the morning to [[Mecca|Makkah]] to see his family there, and then take him back to his Syrian wife in the evening. ''Al-BurƒÅq'' ({{lang-ar|ÿßŸÑÿ®Ÿèÿ±ÿßŸÇ}} ''al-BurƒÅq'' "lightning") isn't mentioned in the ''[[Quran]]'' but in some ''[[hadith]]'' ("tradition") literature.&lt;ref&gt;

====Korean====
A huge white horse appears in [[Korean mythology]] in the story of the kingdom of [[Silla]]. When the people gathered to pray for a king, the horse emerged from a bolt of lightning, bowing to a shining egg. After the horse flew back to heaven, the egg opened and the boy [[Hyeokgeose of Silla|Park Hyeokgeose]] emerged. When he grew up, he united six warring states.

The city of [[Pangantucan, Bukidnon|Pangantucan]] has as its symbol a white stallion who saved an ancient tribe from massacre by uprooting a bamboo and thus warning them of the enemy's approach.

The city of [[Hanoi]] honours a white horse as its [[patron saint]] with a temple dedicated to this revered spirit, the ''White Horse'' or ''Bach Ma Temple'' ( "bach" means ''white'' and "ma" is ''horse''). The 11th-century king, L√Ω C√¥ng U·∫©n (also known as King [[L√Ω Th√°i T·ªï]]) had a vision of a white horse representing a [[dryad|river spirit]] which showed him where to build his citadel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thingsasian.com/stories-photos/1067 |title=1995 article with images by Barbara Cohen |publisher=Thingsasian.com |date= |accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mythological symbolism of white horses has been picked up as a [[trope (literature)|trope]] in literature, film, and other storytelling. For example, the [[Prince Charming|heroic prince]] or [[Knight-errant|white knight]] of [[fairy tales]] often rides a white horse. [[Unicorn]]s are (generally white) horse-like creatures with a single horn. And the English [[nursery rhyme]] "[[Ride a cock horse to Banbury Cross]]" refers to a lady on a white horse who may be associated with the Celtic goddess [[Rhiannon]].&lt;ref name="Banbury"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kton.demon.co.uk/banbury.htm |title='&amp;#39;A Possible Solution to the Banbury Cross Mystery'&amp;#39; |publisher=Kton.demon.co.uk |date= |accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "white [[palfrey]]" appears in the fairy tale "[[Virgilius the Sorcerer]]" by [[Andrew Lang]]. It appears in ''[[The Violet Fairy Book]]'' and attributes more than usual magical powers to the ancient Roman poet [[Virgil]] (see also [[Virgil#Mysticism and hidden meanings]]).

The British author [[G. K. Chesterton]] wrote an epic poem titled ''Ballad of the White Horse.'' In Book I, "The Vision of the King," he writes of earliest England, invoking the white horse hill figure and the gods:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Before the gods that made the gods&lt;br&gt;
Had seen their sunrise pass,&lt;br&gt;
The White Horse of the White Horse Vale&lt;br&gt;
Was cut out of the grass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infomotions.com/etexts/gutenberg/dirs/etext99/botwh10.htm |title=Chesterton, G.K.'&amp;#39;Ballad of the White Horse'&amp;#39; (1929) (need additional citation material |publisher=Infomotions.com |date=31 December 2001 |accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The white horse is a recurring motif in [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen's]] play ''[[Rosmersholm]]'', making use of the common [[Norse mythology|Norse]] folklore that its appearance was a portent of death. The basis for the superstition may have been that the horse was a form of [[Church Grim]], buried alive at the original consecration of the church building (the doomed protagonist in the play was a pastor), or that it was a materialisation of the ''fylgje'', an individual's or family's [[Tutelary deity|guardian spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Holtan|first=Orley|title=Mythic Patterns in Ibsen's Last Plays|year=1970|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0-8166-0582-8|pages=55‚Äì6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
