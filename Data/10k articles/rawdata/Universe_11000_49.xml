      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1896">'''5083 aluminium alloy''' is an [[aluminium alloy]] with magnesium and traces of manganese and chromium. It is highly resistant to attack by [[seawater]] and [[industrial chemicals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azom.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=2804 |title=Aluminium Alloys - Aluminium 5083 Properties, Fabrication and Applications, Supplier Data by Aalco |publisher=azom.com |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alloy 5083 retains exceptional strength after welding. It has the highest strength of the non-heat treatable alloys, but is not recommended for use in temperatures in excess of 65°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aalco.co.uk/datasheets/Aluminium-Alloy_5083-0~H111_149.ashx |title=5083 - '0' - H111 Sheet and Plate  |publisher=aalco.co.uk |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anodizing==
For AA 5083 alloy, the stages of porous structure development are substantially identical with that of pure aluminum, although an increase in oxide growth rate and high conductance of the oxide film were observed.

==Applications==
Alloy 5083 is commonly used in:
* [[Shipbuilding]]
* [[Railroad car]]s
* [[Drilling rig]]s
* [[Coachwork]]
* [[Pressure vessel]]s
* [[Aluminum armor]]

Uses requiring a weldable moderate-strength alloy having good corrosion resistance are commonly utilizing alloy 5083.

The '''750 GeV diphoton excess''' in [[particle physics]] was an anomaly in data collected at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) in 2015, which could have been an indication of a new particle or [[Resonance (particle physics)|resonance]].&lt;ref name='1606.03833'&gt;

Indeed, a [[Bayesian statistics|Bayesian analysis]] of the anomaly found that whilst data collected in 2015 constituted “substantial” evidence for the digamma on the [[Bayes factor|Jeffreys’ scale]], data collected in 2016 combined with that collected in 2015 was evidence against the digamma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fowlie|first1=Andrew|title=Bayes-factor of the ATLAS diphoton excess|journal=The European Physical Journal Plus|date=2016|volume=132|issue=1|doi=10.1140/epjp/i2017-11340-1|arxiv=1607.06608|issn=2190-5444|bibcode = 2017EPJP..132...46F }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== December 2015 data ==

On December 15, 2015, the [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]] and [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]] collaborations at [[CERN]] presented results from the second operational run of the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at the [[center of mass]] energy of 13 TeV, the highest ever achieved in proton-proton collisions. Among the results, the [[invariant mass]] distribution of pairs of high-energy photons produced in the collisions showed an excess of events compared to the [[Standard Model]] prediction at around 750&amp;nbsp;GeV/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The [[statistical significance]] of the deviation was reported to be 3.9 and 3.4 [[standard deviation]]s (locally) respectively for each experiment.&lt;ref name='1606.03833' /&gt;&lt;ref name='1606.04093' /&gt;

The excess could have been explained by the production of a new particle (the digamma) with a mass of about 750&amp;nbsp;GeV/''c''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; that decayed into two photons. The [[Cross section (physics)|cross-section]] at 13&amp;nbsp;TeV centre of mass energy required to explain the excess, multiplied by the [[branching fraction]] into two photons, was estimated to be
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(pp\to \digamma) \times {\rm Br}(\digamma\to \gamma\gamma)\approx 5\,{\rm fb}&lt;/math&gt;

(fb=[[Barn (unit)|femtobarns]])

This result, while unexpected, was compatible with previous experiments, and in particular with the LHC measurements at a lower centre of mass energy of 8&amp;nbsp;TeV.

== August 2016 data ==

Analysis of a larger sample of data, collected by ATLAS and CMS in the first half 2016, did not confirm the existence of the [[Digamma|Ϝ]] particle, which indicates that the excess seen in 2015 was a statistical fluctuation.&lt;ref name='CMS-PAS-EXO-16-027'/&gt;&lt;ref name='ATLAS-CONF-2016-059'/&gt;

== Implications for particle physics research ==

The non-observation of the 750 GeV bump in follow-up searches by the ATLAS and CMS experiments had a significant impact on the particle physics community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Horizon: Inside CERN |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07nsxkk |website=BBC |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the initial significance being lower than the discovery threshold of five sigma, many physicists treated the initial excess as tantamount to a discovery, as evidenced by the extreme interest particularly by the theory community, leading to the authorship of over 500 articles. The event highlighted the desire in the community for the LHC to discover a fundamentally new particle, and the difficulties in searching for a signal which is unknown a priori.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=And so to bed for the 750 GeV bump |url=https://physicsworld.com/a/and-so-to-bed-for-the-750-gev-bump/ |website=PhysicsWorld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon hearing about his invention, the prime minister of Pakistan, [[Raja Pervaiz Ashraf]], formed a committee consisting of three people.

[[Samar Mubarakmand]] was supportive of this idea and seemed enthusiastic at first,&lt;ref name="Bad Science"/&gt; but when Agha Waqar was called by [[Pakistan Television Corporation]] to take the demo of this Water Kit, he failed to give a demonstration in the live program in his car, claiming he had not fit the Water kit in his car for the TV program. Mubarakmand then told him that in his opinion, [[calcium carbide]] is added in water to produce the fuel for the engine.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} In that case, the calcium carbide is the energy source, not the water.

==Criticism==
[[Atta ur Rahman (scientist)|Atta ur Rahman]], a scientist and a former minister of Science and Technology, called for a technical investigation of Ahmed's car by top engineering universities when he appeared on [[Geo TV]]'s ''Capital Talk''. He told the host, [[Hamid Mir]], that such inventions don't work and if they were to work, they would violate the law of [[conservation of energy]]. Ahmed replied to this criticism by stating that he had already made long drives with the car, done demonstrations for politicians and media personalities. He even challenged Rahman to check and verify his water fueled car himself. By the end of the show, everyone agreed that the car should be tested by independent sources.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Rahman showed similar concerns in another show by Talat Hussain Syed, ''News Night with Talat'', for Dawn News.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=News Night With Talat |url=http://dawnnews.tv/current-affairs/news-night-with-talat |series= News Night With Talat] |credits= |network= |station= |city= |began= |ended= |season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcripturl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
While speaking to Express Tribune, Rahman stated he suspected this invention to be a scam. He repeated that such an invention would have to violate the laws of thermodynamics to work.&lt;ref name="ET: Water World" /&gt;

On 11 August 2012, Rahman reported that the vehicle was to be fully inspected by engineers at the [[National University of Sciences and Technology, Pakistan|National University of Science &amp; Technology]], but Ahmed never showed up for the appointment. This caused Rehman to further accuse Ahmed of fraud, stating "Agha Waqar Ahmad did a disappearing act and never turned up for the appointment. The fraud had been exposed and escape was the only route available to him".&lt;ref name=thenews_waterscam&gt;{{cite news|last=Rahman|first=Atta-ur|title=The water car scam|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-9-126017-The-water-car-scam|accessdate=11 August 2012|newspaper=The News|date=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pervez Hoodbhoy]], a nuclear physicist, wrote in [[The Express Tribune]] that Ahmed's coverage in the media, along with endorsement by government authorities and scientists, has exposed the ignorance and self-delusion of such entities. He criticized politicians and media for hailing Ahmed as a national hero and for promoting pseudo-scientific theories related to water-fueled cars. He insisted any technology should comply with basic principles of Science before getting any government funding.&lt;ref name=Hoodbhoy /&gt;
It is worth mentioning that before Agha Waqar Ahmed, another Pakistani known as Doctor Ghulam Sarwar had claimed in December 2011 that he had invented a car that only runs on water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewspakistan.com/water-running-car-kit-launched-dr-ghulam-sarwar-launch-pakistan.php|title=New Water Running Car Kit Launched by Dr Ghulam Sarwar Launch, The News Pakistan|work=The News Pakistan - Latest Breaking News - Sports News - Headlines News - World Entertainment|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720083146/http://www.thenewspakistan.com/water-running-car-kit-launched-dr-ghulam-sarwar-launch-pakistan.php|archivedate=20 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other skeptics have also weighed in on Ahmed's invention, mainly due to its violation of second law of thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="Scienceless kit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bad Science" /&gt; On 6 August 2012, a physics teacher, Ranomal Malani, challenged Ahmed to demonstrate his kit publicly. If he succeeds, Malani has promised a pay out of five million [[rupees]]. Ahmed accepted the challenge.&lt;ref name=Challenge&gt;{{cite web |title=Agha Waqar accepts Physics teacher's challenge to run car on water |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/418245/mnas-brother-challenges-agha-waqar-to-run-car-on-water/ |accessdate=8 August 2012 |date=2 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Talat Hussain (news executive)|Talat Hussain]], who covered Ahmed's invention on his show, did a follow up show on 3 August 2012 to address the skeptics. His guests consisted of a panel of scientists, a Ph.D student and a reporter for [[KTN News]]. Ahmed was notable by his absence. The scientists reiterated the problem of water-kit's incompatibility with the second law of thermodynamics. One of the guests, Javed Ahmed Chatta, said he was present at one of the demonstrations and showed his skepticism; however, his concerns were ignored by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=News Night with Talat  |url=http://dawnnews.tv/current-affairs/news-night-with-talat |series=News Night with Talat|credits= |network=Dawn News |station= |city= |began= |ended= |season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= |time=6:26 |transcript= |transcripturl= |language=Urdu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another guest, Adeel Ghayur, stated that even if the apparent violation of natural laws was ignored the cost to operate such a car would be impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=News Night with Talat |url=http://dawnnews.tv/current-affairs/news-night-with-talat |series= News Night with Talat |credits= |network=Dawn News |station= |city= |began= |ended= |season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= |time=28:13 |transcript= |transcripturl= |language=Urdu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Barcarena water contamination''' by toxic metal waste was detected in the rivers near [[Barcarena, Pará|Barcarena]], [[Pará]], [[Brazil]], on February 16, 2018 by Brazilian authorities. Preliminary investigations indicated that the cause was the leakage of toxic waste from a [[Tailings dam|tailing dam]] due to excessive rain.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; The tailing dam is part of the [[Alunorte]] [[aluminium]] [[refinery]], owned by the [[Norway|Norwegian]] [[Norsk Hydro]]. Additionally, the company's CEO acknowledged improper discharge of rain and surface water into the local rivers.&lt;ref name=ebc01&gt;{{cite web | url = http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/en/geral/noticia/2018-03/norway-mining-giant-apologizes-toxic-leak | title =  Norway mining giant apologizes for toxic leak | publisher = [[Agência Brasil]] | author = Renata Martins | date = 2018-03-20 | accessdate = 2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bröderna Ivarsson i Osby.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The BRIO building in central Osby.]]
'''BRIO''' is a wooden [[toy]] company founded in [[Sweden]]. The company was founded in the small town of [[Boalt]], [[Scania]] in 1884 by basket maker Ivar Bengtsson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brio.knex.com/AboutBrio/ About Brio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218200705/http://brio.knex.com/AboutBrio/ |date=December 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time the company was based in [[Osby]], Scania, in southern Sweden. In 1908 Ivar's three sons took over and founded BRIO, which is an acronym for '''BR'''öderna ("the brothers") '''I'''varsson [at] '''O'''sby. In 2006 the company moved its headquarters to [[Malmö]].

==Lekoseum==
In 1984, the company started the BRIO Lekoseum (from Swedish "leka", to play), a toy [[museum]] featuring the company's products and those of other companies (such as [[Barbie dolls]] and [[Märklin]] model railways), at the headquarters in Osby. Children can play with many of the toys. Since the late summer of 2014 the museum has been run as an independent foundation, hence the official name is now only Lekoseum.

==Products==

BRIO is best known for their [[wooden toy train]]s, sold in Europe since 1958. Most are non-motorized and suitable for younger children.  The cars connect with magnets and are easy to manipulate; in recent years, the range has been extended with battery powered, remote control, and 'intelligent track'-driven engines.  BRIO licenses ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine]]'' wooden trains in some parts of Europe, but [[Mattel]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hitentertainment.com/corporate/newsdetail.aspx?nid=87 "Mattel acquires HiT Entertainment"]&lt;/ref&gt; holds the ''Thomas the Tank Engine'' license in the United States.  Many competitors, such as [[Whittle Shortline]], make products that are compatible with BRIO.

BRIO also sells BRIO-Mech construction kits.  Long, thin wooden slats with evenly spaced holes are connected together with various fasteners made of colorful plastic.  Young children can build sturdy and elaborate constructions.

BRIO also sold ''[[Theodore Tugboat]]'' toys. Released were the tugboats, the Dispatcher, Benjamin Bridge, Chester the Container Ship, and Barrington and Bonavista barges. These toys were discontinued in 2000, a year before the show was cancelled.

During the 1960s BRIO manufactured [[dollhouses]] and dollhouse furniture. Some of this furniture is highly sought after by collectors as it comprises miniature replicas of items by Danish designer [[Arne Jacobsen]]. Pieces include the [[egg chair|'egg' chair]], the [[Model 3107 chair|'series 7' chair]], and the [[Swan (chair)|'swan' couch]].

Additionally, the Alga subsidiary was one of five companies who at one time produced the physical skill game ''[[Crossbows and Catapults]]''.

== Recent company history ==
Plantoys of Thailand had a joint venture with BRIO in 2001-2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playthings.com/article/CA225766.html?q=plan+toy Note] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090812010731/http://www.playthings.com/article/CA225766.html?q=plan+toy |date=August 12, 2009 }} at the www.playthings.com site on the joint venture plans of Brio and Plan Toys from 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; being present in the Brio catalogs of the time. 
In 2004 the Swedish [[investment company]] [[Proventus]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proventus.se/projects/presentprojects/brio.html Brio profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227015756/http://www.proventus.se/projects/presentprojects/brio.html |date=February 27, 2009 }} on the Proventus website.&lt;/ref&gt; became the major shareholder of Brio with more than 40% of the votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://brio.knex.com/AboutBrio/newsContent.php?b=10 "Proventus new principal shareholder in Swedish toy maker BRIO"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230172338/http://brio.knex.com/AboutBrio/newsContent.php?b=10 |date=December 30, 2008 }} from 6 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/18/business/worldbusiness/18toys.html?pagewanted=print New York Times article of September 18, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; BRIO of Sweden moved most of their production to three factories in [[Guangdong Province]], China.

The "Financial Statement January - December 2008" presented on February 17, 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businesswire.com/news/google/20090216005807/en English version] of the report at "Business Wire"&lt;/ref&gt; speaks of financial problems concerning the company's liquidity. On the 11th of March 2009 the company stated "BRIO financially reconstructed – shareholders’ equity strengthened by more than SEK 300 million".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cisionwire.com/brio-ab/brio-financially-reconstructed---shareholders--equity-strengthened-by-more-than-sek-300-million |title=Brio - press release |publisher=Cision Wire |date= |accessdate=2009-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090708093516/http://www.cisionwire.com/brio-ab/brio-financially-reconstructed---shareholders--equity-strengthened-by-more-than-sek-300-million |archivedate=2009-07-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

BRIO was acquired by the [[Ravensburger|Ravensburger Group]] on January 8, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/ravensburger-acquires-renowned-swedish-toy-company-brio-287891001.html |title=Brio - press release |publisher=PR Newswire |date=2015-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dark earth''' in [[archaeology]] is an [[archaeological horizon]], as much as {{convert|1|m|feet|0}} thick, indicating settlement over long periods of time. The material is high in organic matter, including charcoal, which gives it its characteristic dark colour; it may also contain fragments of pottery, tile, animal bone and other artefacts. It is interpreted as soil enriched with the sooty remains of thatched roofs from houses without chimneys, with other waste materials. In some areas it appears to give the soil added fertility.
[[Image:Scotland Skye Trotternish.jpg|thumb|350px|Restored blackhouse in a museum on [[Trotternish]], [[Isle of Skye|Skye]]. There is no chimney on this house and the thatch becomes impregnated with soot. When the roof is replaced, the waste thatch can add fertility to the soil, resulting in dark earth.]]

London's dark earth was originally called 'black earth' by archaeologists. It was renamed dark earth because of confusion with the ''[[chernozem]]'' (black earth soils in [[Russia]]; in these, the dark colour is traditionally (not universally)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The contentious nature of soil organic matter | first1 = J. | last1 = Lehmann |last2 = Kleber | first2 = M. | journal = Nature | volume = 528 | issue = 7580 | date = 2015-12-03 | doi = 10.1038/nature16069 | pmid=26595271 | pages=60–8| bibcode=2015Natur.528...60L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eckm07&gt;{{citation|first1=Eileen |last1=Eckmeier |first2=Renate |last2=Gerlach |first3=Ernst |last3=Gehrt |first4=Michael W.I. |last4=Schmidt |title=Pedogenesis of Chernozems in Central Europe — A review |journal=Geoderma |volume=139 |issue=3–4 |year=2007 |pages=288–299 |doi=10.1016/j.geoderma.2007.01.009 |url=http://www.geo.unizh.ch/~mschmidt/downloads/Eckmeier_Geoderma_2007.pdf |bibcode=2007Geode.139..288E }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Schmidt |first1=M.W.I. |last2=Skjemstad |first2=J.O. |last3=Jäger |first3=C. |year=2002 |title=Carbon isotope geochemistry and nanomorphology of soil black carbon: Black chernozemic soils in central Europe originate from ancient biomass burning |journal=Global Biogeochemical Cycles |volume=16 |issue=4 |doi=10.1029/2002GB001939 |quote=These data challenge the common paradigm that chernozems are zonal soils with climate, parent material and bioturbation dominating soil formation, and introduce fire as a novel, important factor in the formation of these soils |bibcode=2002GBioC..16.1123S |pages=70–1–70–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Eckmeier|first=E.|title=Detecting prehistoric fire-based farming using biogeochemical markers|year=2007|publisher=University of Zurich, Faculty of Science.|doi=10.5167/uzh-3752|quote=It is now an open question as to whether Neolithic settlers did indeed prefer to grow crops where Chernozems occurred or if Neolithic burning formed the chernozemic soils. |url=http://www.zora.uzh.ch/3752}}&lt;/ref&gt; thought to come from [[humus]], rather than [[soot]]).

==Charred material as agricultural improver==
In the [[Hebrides]], it was customary to remove the thatch from the [[Blackhouse|"black houses"]] every spring, and spread it on the fields as fertilizer, improved by the soot which it retained. On [[Achill Island]], special smoke huts were built in the fields, stone structures with sod roofs. From October to May smoky fires burned inside them, and in spring the sods were spread on the fields.&lt;ref&gt;The book of masonry stoves. David Lyle. Brick House Publishing Co, Inc. Andover, Massachusetts, 1984. {{ISBN|0-931790-57-3}} (paperback edition) p.23&lt;/ref&gt; In the Amazon basin, there are very extensive areas of dark soil, known as [[terra preta]], enriched by small particles of soot, and these areas are much more fertile than the natural soil.

==Major areas of dark earth==

===Roman Britain===
In [[England]], dark earth covers many areas that were built up in the Roman period, especially [[Londinium]]. In some cases, it may represent open spaces on the edge of urban centres, but can also be found in more rural settings in and around foci of settlement. In the example of London, deposits underlying the ancient city's dark earth are often dated to between the 2nd to 5th century, the middle and later Roman period. Overlying deposits are frequently dated to the 9th century when Saxon London was repopulated and began to expand. The dark earth shows little evidence of any depositional structure or 'horizons', although [[Fill (archaeology)#Tip lines|tip lines]] are sometimes recorded.

Archaeologists have debated what London's dark earth layer may indicate about human use of the city. It has been taken as evidence of refuse disposal or gardening ''during'' the Roman period on the site of previous buildings. In this case it might be evidence of a decline of [[Londinium]]'s population, or of its partial displacement outside the city walls. However, late Roman cemeteries around London do not show a population decline compared with earlier London.

Alternatively, dark earth might have formed only ''after'' abandonment at the end of the Roman period. In this interpretation, dark earth would consist of urban deposits of smoke-impregnated thatch, decayed weeds, timber, and earth floors, reworked and homogenized by worm action,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webmesh.co.uk/darwinworms3.htm Darwin on earthworms]&lt;/ref&gt; or by agricultural (ploughing), which mixed building materials from the abandoned Roman cities with material deposited later.

===Sweden===
In [[Sweden]], dark earth covering {{convert|40|hectare|acre|-1}} has been found in [[Uppåkra]] (in southernmost Sweden, former Denmark), where city-like settlement existed from about the year 1 until 1000 C.E. when the settlement shifted to modern day [[Lund]]. Dark earth over {{convert|7|hectare|acre|0}} has been found in the Viking city of [[Birka|Björkö]] (today called Birka), in central Sweden, close to modern [[Stockholm]]. Dark earth has also been found in [[Köpingsvik]], on the island of [[Öland]] close to the southern Sweden east coast.

'''Essential Energy''' is a [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned]] electricity infrastructure company which owns, maintains and operates the electrical distribution networks for much of  [[New South Wales]], covering 95 percent of the state geography.&lt;ref name=energynetwork&gt;{{cite web|last=Essential Energy|title=Essential Energy - Our Energy Network|url=http://www.essentialenergy.com.au/content/Our-energy-network|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also owns the reticulated water network in [[Broken Hill, New South Wales|Broken Hill]] through Essential Water, formerly Australian Inland Energy and Water.&lt;ref name=waternetwork&gt;{{cite web|last=Essential Water|title=Essential Water - About Us|url=http://www.essentialwater.com.au/content/about-us|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Essential Energy was formed from the previously state-owned energy business, [[Country Energy]], when the retail division of the company, along with the Country Energy brand, was sold by the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]] in 2011 to [[Origin Energy]].

'''External ballistics''' or '''exterior ballistics''' is the part of [[ballistics]] that deals with the behavior of a [[projectile]] in flight.  The projectile may be powered or un-powered, guided or unguided, spin or fin stabilized, flying through an atmosphere or in the vacuum of space, but most certainly flying under the influence of a gravitational field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/801509.pdf Design for Control of Projectile Flight Characteristics, AMCP 706-242, US Army Materiel Command, 1966]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gun-launched projectiles may be unpowered, deriving all their velocity from the [[propellant]]'s ignition until the projectile exits the [[gun barrel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Army |date=February 1965 |title=Interior Ballistics of Guns |series=Engineering Design Handbook: Ballistics Series |id=AMCP 706-150 |publisher=United States Army Materiel Command |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/462060.pdf |doi= |pages=1{{hyphen}}2&lt;!--hyphenated page--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, exterior ballistics analysis also deals with the trajectories of rocket-assisted gun-launched projectiles and gun-launched rockets; and rockets that acquire all their trajectory velocity from the interior ballistics of their on-board propulsion system, either a rocket motor or air-breathing engine, both during their boost phase and after motor burnout.  External ballistics is also concerned with the free-flight of other projectiles, such as [[ball]]s, [[arrow]]s etc.

==Forces acting on the projectile==
When in flight, the main or major [[force]]s acting on the [[projectile]] are [[gravity]], [[drag (physics)|drag]], and if present, [[wind]]; if in powered flight, thrust; and if guided, the forces imparted by the control surfaces.

In small arms external ballistics applications, gravity imparts a downward acceleration on the projectile, causing it to drop from the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]]. [[drag (physics)|Drag]], or the air resistance, decelerates the projectile with a force proportional to the square of the velocity. Wind makes the projectile deviate from its trajectory. During flight, gravity, drag, and wind have a major impact on the path of the projectile, and must be accounted for when predicting how the projectile will travel.

For medium to longer ranges and flight times, besides gravity, air resistance and wind, several intermediate or meso variables described in the [[External ballistics#External factors|external factors]] paragraph have to be taken into account for small arms. Meso variables can become significant for firearms users that have to deal with angled shot scenarios or extended ranges, but are seldom relevant at common hunting and target shooting distances.

For long to very long small arms target ranges and flight times, minor effects and forces such as the ones described in the [[External ballistics#Long range factors|long range factors]] paragraph become important and have to be taken into account. The practical effects of these minor variables are generally irrelevant for most firearms users, since normal group scatter at short and medium ranges prevails over the influence these effects exert on projectile [[trajectories]].

At extremely long ranges, [[artillery]] must fire projectiles along trajectories that are not even approximately straight; they are closer to [[parabola|parabolic]], although air resistance affects this. Extreme long range projectiles are subject to significant deflections, depending on circumstances, from the line toward the target; and all [[External ballistics#External factors|external factors]] and [[External ballistics#Long range factors|long range factors]] must be taken into account when aiming. In [[super gun]] artillery cases, like the [[Paris gun]], very subtle relativistic effects that are not covered in this article can further refine aiming solutions.

In the case of [[ballistic missile]]s, the altitudes involved have a significant effect as well, with part of the flight taking place in a near-vacuum well above a rotating earth, steadily moving the target from where it was at launch time.

===Stabilizing non-spherical projectiles during flight===
Two methods can be employed to stabilize non-spherical projectiles during flight:
* Projectiles like [[arrow]]s or arrow like [[sabot]]s such as the [[M829 (munition)|M829 Armor-Piercing, Fin-Stabilized, Discarding Sabot (APFSDS)]] achieve stability by forcing their [[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]] (CP) behind their [[center of Mass]] (CM) with tail surfaces. The CP behind the CM condition yields stable projectile flight, meaning the projectile will not overturn during flight through the atmosphere due to aerodynamic forces.
* Projectiles like small arms bullets and artillery shells must deal with their CP being in front of their CM, which destabilizes these projectiles during flight. To stabilize such projectiles the projectile is spun around its longitudinal (leading to trailing) axis. The spinning mass creates gyroscopic forces that keep the bullet's length axis resistant to the destabilizing overturning torque of the CP being in front of the CM.

==Main effects in external ballistics==

===Projectile/bullet drop and projectile path===
[[File:M855 drop during 25-meter zeroing trajectory M16A2 M4.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Typical trajectory graph for a [[M4 carbine]] and [[M16A2 rifle]] using identical [[5.56×45mm NATO|M855]] cartridges with identical projectiles. Though both trajectories have an identical  25 m near zero, the difference in muzzle velocity of the projectiles gradually causes a significant difference in trajectory and far zero. The 0 inch axis represents the line of sight or horizontal sighting plane.]]

The effect of [[gravity]] on a projectile in flight is often referred to as projectile drop or bullet drop. It is important to understand the effect of gravity when [[Calibration|zeroing]] the sighting components of a gun. To plan for projectile drop and compensate properly, one must understand [[parabola|parabolic]] shaped [[trajectories]].

====Projectile/bullet drop====
In order for a projectile to impact any distant target, the barrel must be inclined to a positive elevation angle relative to the target. This is due to the fact that the projectile will begin to respond to the effects of gravity the instant it is free from the mechanical constraints of the bore. The imaginary line down the center axis of the bore and out to infinity is called the line of departure and is the line on which the projectile leaves the barrel. Due to the effects of gravity a projectile can never impact a target higher than the line of departure. When a positively inclined projectile travels downrange, it arcs below the line of departure as it is being deflected off its initial path by gravity. Projectile/Bullet drop is defined as the vertical distance of the projectile below the line of departure from the bore. Even when the line of departure is tilted upward or downward, projectile drop is still defined as the distance between the bullet and the line of departure at any point along the trajectory. Projectile drop does not describe the actual trajectory of the projectile.
Knowledge of projectile drop however is useful when conducting a direct comparison of two different projectiles regarding the shape of their trajectories, comparing the effects of variables such as velocity and drag behavior.

====Projectile/bullet path====
For hitting a distant target an appropriate positive elevation angle is required that is achieved by angling the line of sight from the shooter's eye through the centerline of the sighting system downward toward the line of departure. This can be accomplished by simply adjusting the sights down mechanically, or by securing the entire sighting system to a sloped mounting having a known downward slope, or by a combination of both. This procedure has the effect of elevating the muzzle when the barrel must be subsequently raised to align the sights with the target. A projectile leaving a muzzle at a given elevation angle follows a [[ballistic trajectory]] whose characteristics are dependent upon various factors such as muzzle velocity, gravity, and aerodynamic drag. This ballistic trajectory is referred to as the bullet path.  If the projectile is spin stabilized, aerodynamic forces will also predictably arc the trajectory slightly to the right, if the rifling employs "right-hand twist."  Some barrels are cut with left-hand twist, and the bullet will arc to the left, as a result.  Therefore, to compensate for this path deviation, the sights also have to be adjusted left or right, respectively.  A constant wind also predictably affects the bullet path, pushing it slightly left or right, and a little bit more up and down, depending on the wind direction.  The magnitude of these deviations are also affected by whether the bullet is on the upward or downward slope of the trajectory, due to a phenomenon called "yaw of repose," where a spinning bullet tends to steadily and predictably align slightly off center from its point mass trajectory.  Nevertheless, each of these trajectory perturbations are predictable once the projectile aerodynamic coefficients are established, through a combination of detailed analytical modeling and test range measurements.

Projectile/bullet path analysis is of great use to shooters because it allows them to establish [[ballistic table]]s that will predict how much vertical elevation and horizontal deflection corrections must be applied to the sight line for shots at various known distances. The most detailed ballistic tables are developed for long range artillery and are based on six-degree-of-freedom trajectory analysis, which accounts for aerodynamic behavior along the three axial directions—elevation, range, and deflection—and the three rotational directions—pitch, yaw, and spin.  For small arms applications, trajectory modeling can often be simplified to calculations involving only four of these degrees-of-freedom, lumping the effects of pitch, yaw and spin into the effect of a yaw-of-repose to account for trajectory deflection.  Once detailed range tables are established, shooters can relatively quickly adjust sights based on the range to target, wind, air temperature and humidity, and other geometric considerations, such as terrain elevation differences.

Projectile path values are determined by both the sight height, or the distance of the line of sight above the bore centerline, and the range at which the sights are zeroed, which in turn determines the elevation angle. A projectile following a ballistic trajectory has both forward and vertical motion. Forward motion is slowed due to air resistance, and in point mass modeling the vertical motion is dependent on a combination of the elevation angle and gravity. Initially, the projectile is rising with respect to the line of sight or the horizontal sighting plane. The projectile eventually reaches its apex (highest point in the trajectory parabola) where the vertical speed component decays to zero under the effect of gravity, and then begins to descend, eventually impacting the earth. The farther the distance to the intended target, the greater the elevation angle and the higher the apex.

The projectile path crosses the horizontal sighting plane two times. The point closest to the gun occurs while the bullet is climbing through the line of sight and is called the near zero. The second point occurs as the projectile is descending through the line of sight. It is called the far zero and defines the current sight in distance for the gun. Projectile path is described numerically as distances above or below the horizontal sighting plane at various points along the trajectory. This is in contrast to projectile drop which is referenced to the plane containing the line of departure regardless of the elevation angle. Since each of these two parameters uses a different reference datum, significant confusion can result because even though a projectile is tracking well below the line of departure it can still be gaining actual and significant height with respect to the line of sight as well as the surface of the earth in the case of a horizontal or near horizontal shot taken over flat terrain.

====Maximum point-blank range and battle zero====
Knowledge of the projectile drop and path has some practical uses to shooters even if it does not describe the actual trajectory of the projectile. For example, if the vertical projectile position over a certain range reach is within the vertical height of the target area the shooter wants to hit, the point of aim does not necessarily need to be adjusted over that range; the projectile is considered to have a sufficiently flat [[point-blank range]] trajectory for that particular target.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.cheaperthandirt.com/maximum-point-blank-range-and-the-battlesight-zero/ Maximum Point Blank Range and the Battlesight Zero]&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as "battle zero", maximum point-blank range is also of importance to the military. Soldiers are instructed to fire at any target within this range by simply placing their weapon's sights on the center of mass of the enemy target. Any errors in range estimation are tactically irrelevant, as a well-aimed shot will hit the torso of the enemy soldier. The current trend for elevated sights and higher-velocity cartridges in assault rifles is in part due to a desire to extend the maximum point-blank range, which makes the rifle easier to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ar15.com/content/page.html?id=599 |title=An Improved Battlesight Zero for the M4 Carbine and M16A2 Rifle |accessdate=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ar15.com/content/webPDF/TM9-1005-319-10.pdf |title=TM 9-1005-319-10 (2010) - Operator's Manual for Rifle, 5.56 MM, M16A2/M16A3/M4 (Battlesight Zero pages 48-55)|accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russianoptics.net/400mzero.html|title=Using a 400 meter zero with 5.45×39|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drag resistance===
[[File:Photography of bow shock waves around a brass bullet, 1888.jpg|thumb|[[Schlieren Photography|Schlieren photo]]/[[Shadowgraph]] of the [[detached shock|detached shock or bow shockwave]] around a bullet in supersonic flight, published by [[Ernst Mach]] in 1888.]]

[[Mathematical model]]s, such as computational fluid dynamics, are used for calculating the effects of drag or air resistance; they are quite complex and not yet completely reliable, but research is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a417123.pdf Prediction of Projectile Performance, Stability, and Free-Flight Motion Using Computational Fluid Dynamics, Weinacht, US Army Research Laboratory, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; The most reliable method, therefore, of establishing the necessary projectile aerodynamic properties to properly describe flight trajectories is by empirical measurement.

===Fixed drag curve models generated for standard-shaped projectiles===
[[File:G1 Shape Standard Projectile Measurements in Calibers.png|thumb|G1 shape standard projectile. All measurements in calibers/diameters.]]

Use of ballistics tables or ballistics software based on the [[Ballistic coefficient#The Mayevski.2FSiacci Method|Mayevski/Siacci]] method and [[Ballistic coefficient#The G Model|G1 drag model]], introduced in 1881, are the most common method used to work with external ballistics. Projectiles are described by a [[ballistic coefficient]], or BC, which combines the air resistance of the bullet shape (the [[drag coefficient]]) and its [[sectional density]] (a function of mass and bullet diameter).

The deceleration due to [[drag (physics)|drag]] that a projectile with mass ''m'', velocity ''v'', and diameter ''d'' will experience is proportional to 1/BC, 1/''m'', ''v²'' and ''d²''. The BC gives the ratio of ballistic efficiency compared to the standard G1 projectile, which is a fictitious projectile with a flat base, a length of 3.28 calibers/diameters, and a 2 calibers/diameters radius tangential curve for the point.
The G1 standard projectile originates from the "C" standard reference projectile defined by the German steel, ammunition and armaments manufacturer [[Krupp]] in 1881. The G1 model standard projectile has a BC of 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chuckhawks.com/bc_not_exist.htm|title=Ballistic Coefficients Do Not Exist!|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French Gâvre Commission decided to use this projectile as their first reference projectile, giving the G1 name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lima-wiederladetechnik.de/Weite-Schuesse/Weite-Schuesse-3.htm Weite Schüsse - drei (German)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524043934/http://www.lima-wiederladetechnik.de/Weite-Schuesse/Weite-Schuesse-3.htm |date=2008-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exteriorballistics.com/ebexplained/4th/30.cfm|title=exterior ballistics|first=305|last=Spin|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sporting bullets, with a [[caliber|calibre]] ''d'' ranging from 0.177 to 0.50&amp;nbsp;inches (4.50 to [[.50 BMG|12.7 mm]]), have G1 BC’s in the range 0.12 to slightly over 1.00, with 1.00 being the most aerodynamic, and 0.12 being the least. [[Very-low-drag bullet]]s with BC's ≥ 1.10 can be designed and produced on CNC precision lathes out of mono-metal rods, but they often have to be fired from custom made full bore rifles with special barrels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lima-wiederladetechnik.de/Englisch/LM-Class-Bullets.htm LM Class Bullets, very high BC bullets for windy long Ranges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219154147/http://www.lima-wiederladetechnik.de/Englisch/LM-Class-Bullets.htm |date=2008-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sectional density]] is a very important aspect of a projectile or bullet, and is for a round projectile like a bullet the ratio of frontal surface area (half the bullet diameter squared, times [[pi]]) to bullet mass. Since, for a given bullet shape, frontal surface increases as the square of the calibre, and mass increases as the cube of the diameter, then sectional density grows linearly with bore diameter. Since BC combines shape and sectional density, a half [[scale model]] of the G1 projectile will have a BC of 0.5, and a quarter scale model will have a BC of 0.25.

Since different projectile shapes will respond differently to changes in velocity (particularly between [[supersonic]] and [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] velocities), a BC provided by a bullet manufacturer will be an average BC that represents the common range of velocities for that bullet. For [[rifle]] bullets, this will probably be a [[supersonic]] velocity, for pistol bullets it will probably be subsonic. For projectiles that travel through the [[supersonic]], [[transonic]] and subsonic flight regimes BC is not well approximated by a single constant, but is considered to be a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''BC(M)'' of the [[Mach number]] M; here M equals the projectile velocity divided by the [[speed of sound]]. During the flight of the projectile the M will decrease, and therefore (in most cases) the BC will also decrease.

Most ballistic tables or software takes for granted that one specific drag function correctly describes the drag and hence the flight characteristics of a bullet related to its ballistics coefficient. Those models do not differentiate between [[wadcutter]], flat-based, spitzer, boat-tail, [[very-low-drag bullet|very-low-drag]], etc. bullet types or shapes. They assume one invariable drag function as indicated by the published BC.

Several drag curve models optimized for several standard projectile shapes are however available. The resulting fixed drag curve models for several standard projectile shapes or types are referred to as the:
[[File:G7 Shape Standard Projectile Measurements in Calibers.png|thumb|G7 shape standard projectile. All measurements in calibers/diameters.]]
* G1 or Ingalls (flatbase with 2 caliber (blunt) nose ogive - by far the most popular)
* G2 (Aberdeen J projectile)
* G5 (short 7.5° boat-tail, 6.19 calibers long [[Nose cone design#Tangent ogive|tangent ogive]])
* G6 (flatbase, 6 calibers long [[Nose cone design#Secant ogive|secant ogive]])
* G7 (long 7.5° boat-tail, 10 calibers tangent ogive, preferred by some manufacturers for very-low-drag bullets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://02b0516.netsolhost.com/blog1/?p=62|title=A Better Ballistic Coefficient|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802154317/http://02b0516.netsolhost.com/blog1/?p=62|archivedate=2 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* G8 (flatbase, 10 calibers long secant ogive)
* GL (blunt lead nose)

How different speed regimes affect .338 calibre rifle bullets can be seen in the .338 Lapua Magnum product brochure which states Doppler radar established G1 BC data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapua.com/uploads/media/338LapuaMagnum2009.pdf .338 Lapua Magnum product brochure from Lapua]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapua.com/uploads/media/338LapuaMagnum300grScenar2009.pdf 300 grs Scenar HPBT brochure from Lapua]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The reason for publishing data like in this brochure is that the Siacci/Mayevski G1 model can not be tuned for the drag behavior of a specific projectile whose shape significantly deviates from the used reference projectile shape. Some ballistic software designers, who based their programs on the Siacci/Mayevski G1 model, give the user the possibility to enter several different G1 BC constants for different speed regimes to calculate ballistic predictions that closer match a bullets flight behavior at longer ranges compared to calculations that use only one BC constant.

The above example illustrates the central problem fixed drag curve models have. These models will only yield satisfactory accurate predictions as long as the projectile of interest has the same shape as the reference projectile or a shape that closely resembles the reference projectile. Any deviation from the reference projectile shape will result in less accurate predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.precisionshooting.com.au/downloads/ballisticcoefficients-explained(4).pdf|title=Ballistic Coefficients - Explained|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029190631/http://www.precisionshooting.com.au/downloads/ballisticcoefficients-explained(4).pdf|archive-date=29 October 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ojs.unsw.adfa.edu.au/index.php/juer/article/viewFile/890/571 The mathematical modelling of projectile trajectories under the influence of environmental effects, Ryan F.

The problem that the actual drag curve of a projectile can significantly deviate from the fixed drag curve of any employed reference projectile systematically limits the traditional drag resistance modeling approach. The relative simplicity however makes that it can be explained to and understood by the general shooting public and hence is also popular amongst ballistic software prediction developers and bullet manufacturers that want to market their products.

===More advanced drag models===
 	
====Pejsa model====
Another attempt at building a ballistic calculator is the model presented in 1980 by Dr. [[Arthur J. Pejsa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.sprintmail.com/~pejsa/aboutartpejsa.htm About Art Pejsa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829171747/http://home.sprintmail.com/~pejsa/aboutartpejsa.htm |date=2008-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Pejsa claims on his website that his method was consistently capable of predicting (supersonic) rifle bullet trajectories within 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm (0.1&amp;nbsp;in) and bullet velocities within 0.3&amp;nbsp;m/s (1&amp;nbsp;ft/s) out to 914 m (1,000 yd) in theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | last1=Pejsa | first1=Arthur | title=Pejsa Rifle Ballistics: Art Pejsa's Rifle ballistics software and books | url=http://www.pejsa.com | website=Pejsa Ballistics | publisher=Pejsa Ballistics | accessdate=31 July 2018 | ref=pejsa-com | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120208053310/http://home.sprintmail.com/~pejsa/indexballistics.htm | archivedate=8 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pejsa model is a [[Closed-form expression|closed-form solution]].

The Pejsa model can predict a projectile within a given flight regime (for example the supersonic flight regime) with only two velocity measurements, a distance between said velocity measurements, and a slope or deceleration constant factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Pejsa’s Handbook of New, Precision Ballistics | author= Arthur J Pejsa |publisher = Kenwood Publishing| year = 2002 | page = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The model allows the drag curve to change slopes(true/calibrate) or [[curvature]] at three different points.&lt;ref name ="sixtyFive"&gt;{{cite book | title = New Exact Small Arms Ballistics | author= Arthur J Pejsa |publisher = Kenwood Publishing| year = 2008 | pages = 65–76 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Down range velocity measurement data can be provided around key inflection points allowing for more accurate calculations of the projectile retardation rate, very similar to a Mach vs CD table. The Pejsa model allows the slope factor to be tuned to account for subtle differences in the retardation rate of different bullet shapes and sizes. It ranges from 0.1 (flat-nose bullets) to 0.9 ([[very-low-drag bullet]]s). If this slope or deceleration constant factor is unknown a default value of 0.5 is used. With the help of test firing measurements the slope constant for a particular bullet/rifle system/shooter combination can be determined. These test firings should preferably be executed at 60% and for extreme long range ballistic predictions also at 80% to 90% of the supersonic range of the projectiles of interest, staying away from erratic transonic effects. With this the Pejsa model can easily be tuned. A practical downside of the Pejsa model is that accurate projectile specific down range velocity measurements to provide these better predictions can not be easily performed by the vast majority of shooting enthusiasts.

An average retardation coefficient can be calculated for any given slope constant factor if velocity data points are known and distance between said velocity measurements is known. Obviously this is true only within the same flight regime. With velocity actual [[speed]] is meant, as velocity is a vector quantity and speed is the magnitude of the velocity vector. Because the [[power function]] does not have constant [[curvature]] a simple [[chord (geometry)|chord]] average cannot be used. The Pejsa model uses a weighted average retardation coefficient weighted at 0.25 range.The closer velocity is more heavily weighted. The retardation coefficient is measured in feet whereas range is measured in yards hence 0.25 * 3.0 = 0.75, in some places 0.8 rather than 0.75 is used. The 0.8 comes from rounding in order to allow easy entry on hand calculators. Since the Pejsa model does not use a simple chord weighted average, two velocity measurements are used to find the chord average retardation coefficient at midrange between the two velocity measurements points, limiting it to short range accuracy. In order to find the starting retardation coefficient Dr. Pejsa provides two separate equations in his two books. The first involves the power function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = New Exact Small Arms Ballistics | author= Arthur J Pejsa |publisher = Kenwood Publishing| year = 2008 | page = 63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second equation is identical to the one used to find the weighted average at R / 4; add N * (R/2) where R is the range in feet to the chord average retardation coefficient at midrange and where N is the slope constant factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Pejsa’s Handbook of New, Precision Ballistics | author= Arthur J Pejsa |publisher = Kenwood Publishing| year = 2002 | page = 34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the starting retardation coefficient is found the opposite procedure is used in order find the weighted average at R / 4; the starting retardation coefficient minus N * (R/4). In other words, N is used as the slope of the chord line. Dr. Pejsa states that he expanded his drop formula in a power series in order to prove that the weighted average retardation coefficient at R / 4 was a good approximation. For this Dr. Pejsa compared the power series expansion of his drop formula to some other unnamed drop formula’s power expansion to reach his conclusions. The fourth term in both power series matched when the retardation coefficient at 0.25 range was used in Pejsa’s drop formula. The fourth term was also the first term to use N. The higher terms involving N where insignificant and disappeared at N = 0.36, which according to Dr. Pejsa was a lucky coincidence making for an exceedingly accurate linear approximation, especially for N’s around 0.36. If a retardation coefficient function is used exact average values for any N can be obtained because from calculus it is trivial to find the [[Mean#Mean of a function|average of any integrable function]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Pejsa’s Handbook of New, Precision Ballistics | author= Arthur J Pejsa |publisher = Kenwood Publishing| year = 2002 | page = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Pejsa states that the retardation coefficient can be modeled by C * V&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; where C is a fitting coefficient which disappears during the derivation of the drop formula and N the slope constant factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = New Exact Small Arms Ballistics | author= Arthur J Pejsa |publisher = Kenwood Publishing| year = 2008 | pages = 131–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The retardation coefficient equals the velocity squared divided by the retardation rate A. Using an average retardation coefficient allows the Pejsa model to be a [[closed-form expression]] within a given flight regime.

In order to allow the use of a G1 ballistic coefficient rather than velocity data Dr. Pejsa provided two reference drag curves. The first reference drag curve is based purely on the Siacci/Mayevski retardation rate function. The second reference drag curve is adjusted to equal the Siacci/Mayevski retardation rate function at a projectile velocity of 2600 fps (792.5&amp;nbsp;m/s) using a [[.30-06 Springfield#History|.30-06 Springfield Cartridge, Ball, Caliber .30 M2]] {{convert|152|gr}} rifle [[spitzer bullet]] with a slope or deceleration constant factor of 0.5 in the supersonic flight regime. In other flight regimes the second Pejsa reference drag curve model uses slope constant factors of 0.0 or -4.0. These deceleration constant factors can be verified by backing out Pejsa's formulas (the drag curve segments fits the form V&lt;sup&gt;(2 - N)&lt;/sup&gt; / C and the retardation coefficient curve segments fits the form V&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; / (V&lt;sup&gt;(2 - N)&lt;/sup&gt; / C) = C * V&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt; where C is a fitting coefficient). The empirical test data Pejsa used to determine the exact shape of his chosen reference drag curve and pre-defined mathematical function that returns the retardation coefficient at a given Mach number was provided by the US military for the Cartridge, Ball, Caliber .30 M2 bullet. The calculation of the  retardation coefficient function also involves air density, which Pejsa did not mention explicitly. The Siacci/Mayevski G1 model uses the following deceleration parametrization (60&amp;nbsp;°F, 30 inHg and 67% humidity, [[Density of air|air density]] ρ = 1.2209&amp;nbsp;kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfxyz.nl/docs/bfxaboutdragfunctions.shtml|title=Pejsa and regular drag functions|first=Robert|last=Meijer|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Pejsa suggests using the second drag curve because the Siacci/Mayevski G1 drag curve does not provide a good fit for modern spitzer bullets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = New Exact Small Arms Ballistics | author= Arthur J Pejsa |publisher = Kenwood Publishing| year = 2008 | pages = 33–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To obtain relevant retardation coefficients for optimal long range modeling Dr. Pejsa suggested using accurate projectile specific down range velocity measurement data for a particular projectile to empirically derive the average retardation coefficient rather than using a reference drag curve derived average retardation coefficient. Further he suggested using ammunition with reduced propellant loads to empirically test actual projectile flight behavior at lower velocities. When working with reduced propellant loads utmost care must be taken to avoid dangerous or catastrophic conditions (detonations) with can occur when firing experimental loads in firearms.&lt;ref name ="sixtyFive" /&gt;

====Manges model====
Although not as well known as the Pejsa model, an additional alternative ballistic model was presented in 1989 by Colonel Duff Manges (U S Army Retired) at the American Defense Preparedness (ADPA) 11th International Ballistic Symposium held at the Brussels Congress Center, Brussels, Belgium, May 9–11, 1989.  A paper titled "Closed Form Trajectory Solutions for Direct Fire Weapons Systems" appears in the proceedings, Volume 1, Propulsion Dynamics, Launch Dynamics, Flight Dynamics, pages 665-674. Originally conceived to model projectile drag for [[Rheinmetall 120 mm gun#Ammunition|120 mm tank gun ammunition]], the novel drag coefficient formula has been applied subsequently to ballistic trajectories of center-fired rifle ammunition with results comparable to those claimed for the Pejsa model.

The Manges model uses a first principles theoretical approach that eschews "G" curves and "ballistic coefficients" based on the standard G1 and other similarity curves.  The theoretical description has three main parts. The first is to develop and solve a formulation of the two dimensional differential equations of motion governing flat trajectories of point mass projectiles by defining mathematically a set of quadratures that permit closed form solutions for the trajectory differential equations of motion.  A sequence of successive approximation drag coefficient functions is generated that converge rapidly to actual observed drag data.  The vacuum trajectory, simplified aerodynamic, d'Antonio, and Euler drag law models are special cases. The Manges drag law thereby provides a unifying influence with respect to earlier models used to obtain two dimensional closed form solutions to the point-mass equations of motion.  The third purpose of this paper is to describe a least squares fitting procedure for obtaining the new drag functions from observed experimental data.  The author claims that results show excellent agreement with six degree of freedom numerical calculations for modern tank ammunition and available published firing tables for center-fired rifle ammunition having a wide variety of shapes and sizes.

A Microsoft Excel application has been authored that uses least squares fits of wind tunnel acquired tabular drag coefficients.  Alternatively, manufacturer supplied ballistic trajectory data, or Doppler acquired velocity data can be fitted as well to calibrate the model.  The Excel application then employs custom macroinstructions to calculate the trajectory variables of interest. A modified 4th order [[Runge–Kutta methods|Runge-Kutta integration algorithm]] is used.  Like Pejsa, Colonel Manges claims center-fired rifle accuracies to the nearest one tenth of an inch for bullet position, and nearest foot per second for the projectile velocity.

====Six degrees of freedom model====
There are also advanced professional ballistic models like [http://www.prodas.com/ PRODAS] available. These are based on [[six degrees of freedom]] (6 DoF) calculations. 6 DoF modeling accounts for x, y, and z position in space along with the projectiles pitch, yaw, and roll rates. 6 DoF modeling needs such elaborate data input, knowledge of the employed projectiles and expensive data collection and verification methods that it is impractical for non-professional ballisticians,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2012armaments/Wednesday13615siewert.pdf |title=Test Options &amp; Analysis Techniques:Aerodynamic Coefficients: What’s Important &amp; How Can I Measure Them?

Semi-empirical aeroprediction models have been developed that reduced extensive test range data on a wide variety of projectile shapes, normalizing dimensional input geometries to calibers; accounting for nose length and radius, body length, and boattail size, and allowing the full set of 6-dof aerodynamic coefficients to be estimated.  Early research on spin-stabilized aeroprediction software resulted in the SPINNER computer program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/get-tr-doc/pdf?AD=AD0915628 SPIN-73 An Updated Version of the Spinner Computer Program, White, 1973]&lt;/ref&gt;  The FINNER aeroprediction code calculates 6-dof inputs for fin stabilized projectiles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA109180 Aerodynamic Design Manual for Tactical Weapons, NSWC 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;  Solids modeling software that determines the projectile parameters of mass, center of gravity, axial and transverse moments of inertia necessary for stability analysis are also readily available, and simple to computer program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA278638 Improved Solids Modeling for Axisymmetric Projectile Design, 1988]&lt;/ref&gt;   Finally, algorithms for 6-dof numerical integration suitable to a 4th order Runge-Kutta are readily available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/452106.pdf Six Degree of Freedom Digital Simulation Model for Unguided Fin-Stabilized Rockets]&lt;/ref&gt; All that is required for the amateur ballistician to investigate the finer analytical details of projectile trajectories, along with bullet nutation and [[precession]] behavior, is computer programming determination. Nevertheless, for the small arms enthusiast, aside from academic curiosity, one will discover that being able to predict trajectories to 6-dof accuracy is probably not of practical significance compared to more simplified point mass trajectories based on published bullet ballistic coefficients.  6 DoF is generally used by the aerospace and defense industry and military organizations that study the ballistic behavior of a limited number of (intended) military issue projectiles. Calculated 6 DoF trends can be incorporated as correction tables in more conventional ballistic software applications.

Though 6 DoF modeling and software applications are used by professional well equipped organizations for decades, the computing power restrictions of [[mobile computing|mobile computing devices]] like (ruggedized) [[personal digital assistant]]s, [[tablet computer]]s or [[smartphone]]s impaired field use as calculations generally have to be done on the fly. In 2016 the Scandinavian ammunition manufacturer [[Nammo|Nammo Lapua Oy]] released a 6 DoF calculation model based ballistic free software named Lapua Ballistics. The software is distributed as a [[mobile app]] only and available for Android and iOS devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lapua.com/en/resources/lapua-ballistics-app.html|title=Lapua Ballistics App - Resources - Nammo Lapua|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The employed 6 DoF model is however limited to Lapua bullets as a 6 DoF solver needs bullet specific drag coefficient (Cd)/Doppler radar data and geometric dimensions of the projectile(s) of interest. For other bullets the Lapua Ballistics solver is limited to and based on G1 or G7 ballistic coefficients and the Mayevski/Siacci method.

====Artillery software suites====
Military organizations have developed ballistic models like the NATO Armament Ballistic Kernel (NABK) for [[fire-control system]]s for artillery like the [[SG2 Shareable (Fire Control) Software Suite (S4)]] from the NATO Army Armaments Group (NAAG).

===Doppler radar-measurements===
For the precise establishment of drag or air resistance effects on projectiles, [[Doppler radar]] measurements are required. Weibel 1000e or Infinition BR-1001 [[Doppler radar]]s are used by governments, professional ballisticians, defence forces and a few ammunition manufacturers to obtain real-world data of the flight behavior of projectiles of their interest. Correctly established state of the art Doppler radar measurements can determine the flight behavior of projectiles as small as airgun pellets in three-dimensional space to within a few millimetres accuracy. The gathered data regarding the projectile deceleration can be derived and expressed in several ways, such as ballistic coefficients (BC) or [[drag coefficient]]s (C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;).  Because a spinning projectile experiences both precession and nutation about its center of gravity as it flies, further data reduction of doppler radar measurements is required to separate yaw induced drag and lift coefficients from the zero yaw drag coefficient, in order to make measurements fully applicable to 6-dof trajectory analysis.

The initial rise in the BC value is attributed to a projectile's always present yaw and precession out of the bore. The test results were obtained from many shots not just a single shot. The bullet was assigned 1.062 for its BC number by the bullet's manufacturer Lost River Ballistic Technologies.

This tested bullet experiences its maximum drag coefficient when entering the transonic flight regime around Mach 1.200.

With the help of Doppler radar measurements projectile specific drag models can be established that are most useful when shooting at extended ranges where the bullet speed slows to the transonic speed region near the speed of sound. This is where the projectile drag predicted by mathematic modeling can significantly depart from the actual drag experienced by the projectile. Further Doppler radar measurements are used to study subtle in-flight effects of various bullet constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hornady.com/assets/files/resources/ELD-X_ELD-Match_Technical_Details.pdf |title=A Technical Discussion of the ELD-X™ (Extremely Low Drag – eXpanding) &amp; ELD™ Match (Extremely Low Drag Match) Bullets with Heat Shield™ Tip, Dave Emary, October 2015 |access-date=2015-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106022324/http://www.hornady.com/assets/files/resources/ELD-X_ELD-Match_Technical_Details.pdf |archive-date=2015-11-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Governments, professional ballisticians, defence forces and ammunition manufacturers can supplement Doppler radar measurements with measurements gathered by telemetry probes fitted to larger projectiles.

===General trends in drag or ballistic coefficient===
In general, a pointed projectile will have a better [[drag coefficient]] (C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) or [[ballistic coefficient]] (BC) than a round nosed bullet, and a round nosed bullet will have a better C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; or BC than a flat point bullet. Large radius curves, resulting in a shallower point angle, will produce lower drags, particularly at supersonic velocities. [[Hollow point bullet]]s behave much like a flat point of the same point diameter. Projectiles designed for supersonic use often have a slightly tapered base at the rear, called a '''boat tail''', which reduces air resistance in flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chuckhawks.com/8mm_lebel.htm |title=The 8x50R Lebel (8mm Lebel) |author=Chuck Hawks}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Cannelures''', which are recessed rings around the projectile used to crimp the projectile securely into the case, will cause an increase in drag.

Analytical software was developed by the [[Ballistic Research Laboratory|Ballistics Research Laboratory]] - later called the [[United States Army Research Laboratory|Army Research Laboratory]] - which reduced actual test range data to parametric relationships for projectile drag coefficient prediction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA098110 MC DRAG - A Computer Program for Estimating the Drag Coefficients of Projectiles, McCoy, US Army Ballistic Research Laboratory, 1981]&lt;/ref&gt;  Large caliber artillery also employ drag reduction mechanisms in addition to streamlining geometry. [[Rocket-assisted projectile]]s employ a small rocket motor that ignites upon muzzle exit providing additional thrust to overcome aerodynamic drag.  Rocket assist is most effective with subsonic artillery projectiles.  For supersonic long range artillery, where base drag dominates, [[base bleed]] is employed.  Base bleed is a form of a gas generator that does not provide significant thrust, but rather fills the low-pressure area behind the projectile with gas, effectively reducing the base drag and the overall projectile drag coefficient.

===Transonic problem===
A projectile fired at [[supersonic]] muzzle velocity will at some point slow to approach the speed of sound. At the [[transonic]] region (about [[Mach number|Mach]] 1.2–0.8) the centre of pressure (CP) of most non spherical projectiles shifts forward as the projectile decelerates. That CP shift affects the (dynamic) stability of the projectile. If the projectile is not well stabilized, it cannot remain pointing forward through the transonic region (the projectile starts to exhibit an unwanted [[precession]] or coning motion called limit cycle yaw that, if not damped out, can eventually end in uncontrollable tumbling along the length axis). However, even if the projectile has sufficient stability (static and dynamic) to be able to fly through the transonic region and stays pointing forward, it is still affected. The erratic and sudden CP shift and (temporary) decrease of dynamic stability can cause significant dispersion (and hence significant accuracy decay), even if the projectile's flight becomes well behaved again when it enters the [[Speed of sound|subsonic]] region. This makes accurately predicting the ballistic behavior of projectiles in the transonic region very difficult. 

Because of this, marksmen normally restrict themselves to engaging targets close enough that the projectile is still supersonic.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Most spin-stabilized projectiles that suffer from lack of dynamic stability have the problem near the speed of sound where the aerodynamic forces and moments exhibit great changes. It is less common (but possible) for bullets to display significant lack of dynamic stability at supersonic velocities.

Since dynamic stability is mostly governed by transonic aerodynamics, it is very hard to predict when a projectile will have sufficient dynamic stability (these are the hardest aerodynamic coefficients to calculate accurately at the most difficult speed regime to predict (transonic)). The aerodynamic coefficients that govern dynamic stability: pitching moment, Magnus moment and the sum of the pitch and angle of attack dynamic moment coefficient (a very hard quantity to predict).
In the end, there is little that modeling and simulation can do to accurately predict the level of dynamic stability that a bullet will have downrange. If a projectile has a very high or low level of dynamic stability, modeling may get the answer right. However, if a situation is borderline (dynamic stability near 0 or 2) modeling cannot be relied upon to produce the right answer. This is one of those things that have to be field tested and carefully documented.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015 the American ballistician Bryan Litz introduced the "Extended Long Range" concept to define rifle shooting at ranges where supersonic fired (rifle) bullets enter the transonic region. According to Litz, "Extended Long Range starts whenever the bullet slows to its transonic range. As the bullet slows down to approach Mach 1, it starts to encounter transonic effects, which are more complex and difficult to account for, compared to the supersonic range where the bullet is relatively well-behaved."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bulletin.accurateshooter.com/2015/08/new-video-series-from-applied-ballistics/|title=New Video Series from Applied Ballistics «  Daily Bulletin|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021000721/http://bulletin.accurateshooter.com/2015/08/new-video-series-from-applied-ballistics/|archive-date=21 October 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambient [[air density]] has a significant effect on dynamic stability during transonic transition. Though the ambient air density is a variable environmental factor, adverse transonic transition effects can be negated better by a projectile traveling through less dense air, than when traveling through denser air. Projectile or bullet length also affects limit cycle yaw. Longer projectiles experience more limit cycle yaw than shorter projectiles of the same diameter. Another feature of projectile design that has been identified as having an effect on the unwanted limit cycle yaw motion is the chamfer at the base of the projectile. At the very base, or heel of a projectile or bullet, there is a {{convert|0.25|to|0.50|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} chamfer, or radius. The presence of this radius causes the projectile to fly with greater limit cycle yaw angles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enu.kz/repository/2009/AIAA-2009-3851.pdf The Effect of Boattail Geometry on the Yaw Limit Cycle of Small Caliber Projectiles by Bradley E.

Silton and Paul Weinacht US Army Research Laboratory Aberdeen Proving Ground, MD 21005-5066]&lt;/ref&gt; In general faster spinning projectiles experience less limit cycle yaw.

====Research into guided projectiles====
To circumvent the transonic problems encountered by spin-stabilized projectiles, projectiles can theoretically be guided during flight. The [[Sandia National Laboratories]] announced in January 2012 it has researched and test-fired 4-inch (102&amp;nbsp;mm) long prototype dart-like, self-guided bullets for small-caliber, smooth-bore firearms that could hit laser-designated targets at distances of more than a mile (about 1,610 meters or 1760 yards). These projectiles are not spin stabilized and the flight path can be course adjusted with an electromagnetic actuator 30 times per second. The researchers also claim they have video of the bullet radically pitching as it exits the barrel and pitching less as it flies down range, a disputed phenomenon known to long-range firearms experts as “going to sleep”. Because the bullet’s motions settle the longer it is in flight, accuracy improves at longer ranges, Sandia researcher Red Jones said. “Nobody had ever seen that, but we’ve got high-speed video photography that shows that it’s true,” he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://share.sandia.gov/news/resources/news_releases/bullet/|title=Sandia National Laboratories: News Releases  : Sandia’s self-guided bullet prototype can hit target a mile away|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Sandia  is seeking a private company partner to complete testing of the prototype and bring a guided bullet to the marketplace, the future of this technology remains uncertain.

===Testing the predictive qualities of software===
Due to the practical inability to know in advance and compensate for all the variables of flight, no software simulation, however advanced, will yield predictions that will always perfectly match real world trajectories. It is however possible to obtain predictions that are very close to actual flight behavior.

====Empirical measurement method====
Ballistic prediction computer programs intended for (extreme) long ranges can be evaluated by conducting field tests at the supersonic to subsonic transition range (the last 10 to 20% of the supersonic range of the rifle/cartridge/bullet combination). For a typical .338 Lapua Magnum rifle for example, shooting standard 16.2&amp;nbsp;gram (250 gr) Lapua Scenar GB488 bullets at 905&amp;nbsp;m/s (2969&amp;nbsp;ft/s) muzzle velocity, field testing of the software should be done at ≈ 1200–1300 meters (1312 - 1422 yd) under [[International Standard Atmosphere]] sea level conditions ([[air density]] ρ = 1.225&amp;nbsp;kg/m³). To check how well the software predicts the trajectory at shorter to medium range, field tests at 20, 40 and 60% of the supersonic range have to be conducted. At those shorter to medium ranges, transonic problems and hence unbehaved bullet flight should not occur, and the BC is less likely to be transient. Testing the predictive qualities of software at (extreme) long ranges is expensive because it consumes ammunition; the actual muzzle velocity of all shots fired must be measured to be able to make statistically dependable statements. Sample groups of less than 24 shots may not obtain the desired statistically significant [[confidence interval]].

====Doppler radar measurement method====
Governments, professional ballisticians, defence forces and a few ammunition manufacturers use Doppler radars and/or telemetry probes fitted to larger projectiles to obtain precise real world data regarding the flight behavior of the specific projectiles of their interest and thereupon compare the gathered real world data against the predictions calculated by ballistic computer programs. The normal shooting or aerodynamics enthusiast, however, has no access to such expensive professional measurement devices. Authorities and projectile manufacturers are generally reluctant to share the results of Doppler radar tests and the test derived [[drag coefficient]]s (C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) of projectiles with the general public.

In January 2009 the Scandinavian ammunition manufacturer Nammo/Lapua published Doppler radar test-derived drag coefficient data for most of their rifle projectiles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101229203547/http://www.lapua.com/uploads/media/LapuaBulletsDragCoefficient.pdf Lapua Bullets Drag Coefficient Data for QuickTARGET Unlimited]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapua.com/uploads/media/LapuaBulletsCD-Data.zip Lapua bullets CD data (zip file)]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015 the US ammunition manufacturer Berger Bullets announced the use of Doppler radar in unison with PRODAS 6 DoF software to generate trajectory solutions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barnesbullets.com/files/2015/01/Use-of-Doppler-Radar-to-Generate-Trajectory-Solutions-Rev-1-6-15-V2.pdf Use of Doppler Radar to Generate Trajectory Solutions]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016 US ammunition manufacturer [[Hornady]] announced the use of Doppler radar derived drag data in software utilizing a modified point mass model to generate trajectory solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hornady.com/ballistics-resource/4dof-overview|title=Hornady® 4DOF Ballistic Calculator Overview|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160823235813/http://www.hornady.com/ballistics-resource/4dof-overview|archive-date=2016-08-23|dead-url=yes|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hornady.com/support/faqs/4dof-ballistic-calculator|title=4DOF Ballistic Calculator|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hornady.com/assets/files/faqs/AxialFormFactor.pdf |title=Drag Variability and the use of the “Axial Form Factor” in the Hornady 4DOF™ Trajectory Calculator |access-date=2016-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019035255/http://www.hornady.com/assets/files/faqs/AxialFormFactor.pdf |archive-date=2016-10-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hornady.com/assets/files/4dof/Hornady_4DOF_Technical_Paper.pdf |title=Hornady® 4DOF™ (Four Degree of Freedom) Ballistic Calculator Technical Document |access-date=2016-10-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019033631/http://www.hornady.com/assets/files/4dof/Hornady_4DOF_Technical_Paper.pdf |archive-date=2016-10-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
With the measurement derived C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; data engineers can create algorithms that utilize both known mathematical ballistic models as well as test specific, tabular data in unison. When used by predictive software like [[QuickLOAD|QuickTARGET Unlimited]], Lapua Edition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapua.com/en/customer-center/lapua-ballistics/download-lapua-edition.html QuickTARGET Unlimited, Lapua Edition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701181622/http://www.lapua.com/en/customer-center/lapua-ballistics/download-lapua-edition.html |date=2012-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lapua Ballistics&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lapua.com/en/customer-center/lapua-ballistics/lapua-ballistics-software.html Lapua Ballistics freeware exterior ballistic software for mobile phones] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701033430/http://www.lapua.com/en/customer-center/lapua-ballistics/lapua-ballistics-software.html |date=2012-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Hornady 4DOF the Doppler radar test-derived drag coefficient data can be used for more accurate external ballistic predictions.

Some of the Lapua-provided drag coefficient data shows drastic increases in the measured drag around or below the Mach 1 flight velocity region. This behavior was observed for most of the measured small calibre bullets, and not so much for the larger calibre bullets. This implies some (mostly smaller calibre) rifle bullets exhibited more limit cycle yaw (coning and/or tumbling) in the transonic/subsonic flight velocity regime.
The information regarding unfavourable transonic/subsonic flight behavior for some of the tested projectiles is important. This is a limiting factor for extended range shooting use, because the effects of limit cycle yaw are not easily predictable and potentially catastrophic for the best ballistic prediction models and software.

Presented C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; data can not be simply used for every gun-ammunition combination, since it was measured for the barrels, [[angular velocity|rotational (spin) velocities]] and ammunition lots the Lapua testers used during their test firings. Variables like differences in rifling (number of grooves, depth, width and other dimensional properties), twist rates and/or muzzle velocities impart different rotational (spin) velocities and rifling marks on projectiles. Changes in such variables and projectile production lot variations can yield different downrange interaction with the air the projectile passes through that can result in (minor) changes in flight behavior. This particular field of external ballistics is currently (2009) not elaborately studied nor well understood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&amp;AD=ADA505719 EFFECT OF RIFLING GROOVES ON THE PERFORMANCE OF SMALL-CALIBER AMMUNITION Sidra I.

The table shows the Doppler radar test derived drag coefficients (C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) prediction method and the 2017 Lapua Ballistics 6 DoF App predictions produce similar results. The 6 DoF modeling estimates bullet stability ((S&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) and (S&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;)) that gravitates to over-stabilization for ranges over {{convert|2400|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} for this bullet. At {{convert|2400|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} the total drop predictions deviate 47.5&amp;nbsp;cm (19.7&amp;nbsp;in) or 0.20 [[Milliradian|mil]] (0.68 [[Minute of arc|moa]]) at 50° latitude and up to {{convert|2700|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} the total drop predictions are within 0.30 mil (1 moa) at 50° latitude. The 2016 Lapua Ballistics 6 DoF App version predictions were even closer to the Doppler radar test predictions.

The traditional Siacci/Mayevski G1 drag curve model prediction method generally yields more optimistic results compared to the modern Doppler radar test derived drag coefficients (C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) prediction method.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; data is used by engineers to create algorithms that utilize both known mathematical ballistic models as well as test specific, tabular data in unison to obtain predictions that are very close to actual flight behavior.&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|300|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} range the differences will be hardly noticeable, but at {{convert|600|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} and beyond the differences grow over 10&amp;nbsp;m/s (32.8&amp;nbsp;ft/s) projectile velocity and gradually become significant.
At {{convert|1500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} range the projectile velocity predictions deviate 25&amp;nbsp;m/s (82.0&amp;nbsp;ft/s), which equates to a predicted total drop difference of 125.6&amp;nbsp;cm (49.4&amp;nbsp;in) or 0.83 mil (2.87 moa) at 50° latitude.

The Pejsa drag model closed-form solution prediction method, without slope constant factor fine tuning, yields very similar results in the supersonic flight regime compared to the Doppler radar test derived drag coefficients (C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) prediction method. At {{convert|1500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} range the projectile velocity predictions deviate 10&amp;nbsp;m/s (32.8&amp;nbsp;ft/s), which equates to a predicted total drop difference of 23.6&amp;nbsp;cm (9.3&amp;nbsp;in) or 0.16 mil (0.54 moa) at 50° latitude.

The G7 drag curve model prediction method (recommended by some manufacturers for very-low-drag shaped rifle bullets) when using a G7 ballistic coefficient (BC) of 0.377 yields very similar results in the supersonic flight regime compared to the Doppler radar test derived drag coefficients (C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;) prediction method. At {{convert|1500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} range the projectile velocity predictions have their maximum deviation of 10&amp;nbsp;m/s (32.8&amp;nbsp;ft/s). The predicted total drop difference at {{convert|1500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} is 0.4&amp;nbsp;cm (0.16&amp;nbsp;in) at 50° latitude. The predicted total drop difference at {{convert|1800|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} is 45.0&amp;nbsp;cm (17.7&amp;nbsp;in), which equates to 0.25 mil (0.86 moa).

Decent prediction models are expected to yield similar results in the supersonic flight regime. The five example models down to {{convert|1200|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} all predict supersonic Mach 1.2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; projectile velocities and total drop differences within a 51&amp;nbsp;cm (20.1&amp;nbsp;in) bandwidth. In the transonic flight regime at {{convert|1500|m|yd|0|abbr=on}} the models predict projectile velocities around Mach 1.0 to Mach 1.1 and total drop differences within a much larger 150&amp;nbsp;cm (59&amp;nbsp;in) bandwidth.

==External factors==

===Wind===
Wind has a range of effects, the first being the effect of making the projectile deviate to the side (horizontal deflection). From a scientific perspective, the "wind pushing on the side of the projectile" is not what causes horizontal wind drift. What causes wind drift is drag. Drag makes the projectile turn into the wind, much like a weather vane, keeping the centre of air pressure on its nose. This causes the nose to be cocked (from your perspective) into the wind, the base is cocked (from your perspective) "downwind." So, (again from your perspective), the drag is pushing the projectile downwind in a nose to tail direction.

Wind also causes aerodynamic jump which is the vertical component of cross wind deflection caused by lateral (wind) impulses activated during free flight of a projectile or at or very near the muzzle leading to dynamic imbalance.&lt;ref name="arl.army.mil"&gt;[http://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/2004/ARL-TR-3206.pdf The Effects of Aerodynamic Jump Caused by a Uniform Sequence of Lateral Impulses - Gene R. Cooper, July 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of aerodynamic jump is dependent on cross wind speed, the gyroscopic stability of the bullet at the muzzle and if the barrel twist is clockwise or anti-clockwise. Like the wind direction reversing the twist direction will reverse the aerodynamic jump direction.

A somewhat less obvious effect is caused by head or tailwinds. A headwind will slightly increase the [[relative velocity]] of the projectile, and increase drag and the corresponding drop. A tailwind will reduce the drag and the projectile/bullet drop. In the real world, pure head or tailwinds are rare, since wind is seldomly constant in force and direction and normally interacts with the terrain it is blowing over. This often makes ultra long range shooting in head or tailwind conditions difficult.

===Vertical angles===
The [[Vertical (angles)|vertical angle]] (or [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]]) of a shot will also affect the trajectory of the shot. Ballistic tables for small calibre projectiles (fired from pistols or rifles) assume a horizontal line of sight between the shooter and target with gravity acting perpendicular to the earth. Therefore, if the shooter-to-target angle is up or down, (the direction of the gravity component does not change with slope direction), then the trajectory curving acceleration due to gravity will actually be less, in proportion to the cosine of the slant angle. As a result, a projectile fired upward or downward, on a so-called "slant range," will over-shoot the same target distance on flat ground. The effect is of sufficient magnitude that hunters must adjust their target hold off accordingly in mountainous terrain. A well known formula for slant range adjustment to horizontal range hold off is known as the [[Rifleman's rule]]. The Rifleman's rule and the slightly more complex and less well known Improved Rifleman's rule models produce sufficiently accurate predictions for many small arms applications. Simple prediction models however ignore minor gravity effects when shooting uphill or downhill. The only practical way to compensate for this is to use a ballistic computer program. Besides gravity at very steep angles over long distances, the effect of air density changes the projectile encounters during flight become problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exteriorballistics.com/ebexplained/article1.html|title=Understanding Uphill and Downhill Shots in Long Range Shooting: A Primer|author=|first=|last=|publisher=backcountrymaven.com|date=16 May 2013|accessdate=28 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The mathematical prediction models available for inclined fire scenarios, depending on the amount and direction (uphill or downhill) of the inclination angle and range, yield varying accuracy expectation levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exteriorballistics.com/ebexplained/article1.html|title=INCLINED FIRE|author=William T. McDonald|first=|last=|publisher=Exterior Ballistics.com|date=June 2003|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Less advanced ballistic computer programs predict the same trajectory for uphill and downhill shots at the same vertical angle and range. The more advanced programs factor in the small effect of gravity on uphill and on downhill shots resulting in slightly differing trajectories at the same vertical angle and range. No publicly available ballistic computer program currently (2017) accounts for the complicated phenomena of differing air densities the projectile encounters during flight.

===Ambient air density===
Air [[pressure]], [[temperature]], and [[humidity]] variations make up the ambient [[air density]]. Humidity has a counter intuitive impact. Since [[water vapor]] has a density of 0.8&amp;nbsp;grams per litre, while dry air averages about 1.225&amp;nbsp;grams per litre, higher humidity actually decreases the air density, and therefore decreases the drag.  (An easy way to remember that water vapor reduces air density is to observe that clouds float.)

==Long range factors==

===Gyroscopic drift (Spin drift)===
Gyroscopic drift is an interaction of the bullet's mass and aerodynamics with the atmosphere that it is flying in.
Even in completely calm air, with no sideways air movement at all, a spin-stabilized projectile will experience a spin-induced sideways component, due to a gyroscopic phenomenon known as "yaw of repose." For a right hand (clockwise) direction of rotation this component will always be to the right. For a left hand (counterclockwise) direction of rotation this component will always be to the left.
This is because the projectile's longitudinal axis (its axis of rotation) and the direction of the velocity vector of the center of gravity (CG) deviate by a small angle, which is said to be the equilibrium [[flight dynamics|yaw]] or the yaw of repose. The magnitude of the yaw of repose angle is typically less than 0.5 degree.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nennstiel-ruprecht.de/bullfly/fig25.htm Nenstiel The yaw of repose angle of a M80 bullet (7.62 x 51 Nato) fired at 32°]&lt;/ref&gt; Since rotating objects react with an angular velocity vector 90 degrees from the applied torque vector, the bullet's axis of symmetry moves with a component in the vertical plane and a component in the horizontal plane; for right-handed (clockwise) spinning bullets, the bullet's axis of symmetry deflects to the right and a little bit upward with respect to the direction of the velocity vector, as the projectile moves along its ballistic arc. As the result of this small inclination, there is a continuous air stream, which tends to deflect the bullet to the right. Thus the occurrence of the yaw of repose is the reason for the bullet drifting to the right (for right-handed spin) or to the left (for left-handed spin). This means that the bullet is "skidding" sideways at any given moment, and thus experiencing a sideways component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nennstiel-ruprecht.de/bullfly/longr.htm#header_longranges|title=longr|first=Ruprecht|last=Nennstiel|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedballisticsllc.com/spindrift.html|title=Articles - Applied Ballistics LLC|publisher=|accessdate=12 January 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160107040743/http://www.appliedballisticsllc.com/spindrift.html|archivedate=7 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following variables affect the magnitude of gyroscopic drift:
* Projectile or bullet length: longer projectiles experience more gyroscopic drift because they produce more lateral "lift" for a given yaw angle.
* Spin rate: faster spin rates will produce more gyroscopic drift because the nose ends up pointing farther to the side.
* Range, time of flight and trajectory height: gyroscopic drift increases with all of these variables.
* density of the atmosphere: denser air will increase gyroscopic drift.

Doppler radar measurement results for the gyroscopic drift of several US military and other [[very-low-drag bullet]]s at 1000 yards (914.4 m) look like this:

The table shows that the gyroscopic drift cannot be predicted on weight and diameter alone.  In order to make accurate predictions on gyroscopic drift several details about both the external and internal ballistics must be considered.  Factors such as the twist rate of the barrel, the velocity of the projectile as it exits the muzzle, barrel harmonics, and atmospheric conditions, all contribute to the path of a projectile.

===Magnus effect===
[[File:Sketch of Magnus effect with streamlines and turbulent wake.svg|thumb|The Magnus effect]]

Spin stabilized projectiles are affected by the [[Magnus effect]], whereby the spin of the bullet creates a force acting either up or down, perpendicular to the sideways vector of the wind.
In the simple case of horizontal wind, and a right hand (clockwise) direction of rotation, the Magnus effect induced pressure differences around the bullet cause a downward (wind from the right) or upward (wind from the left) force viewed from the point of firing to act on the projectile, affecting its point of impact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nennstiel-ruprecht.de/bullfly/fig9.htm Nenstiel The Magnus effect]&lt;/ref&gt; The vertical deflection value tends to be small in comparison with the horizontal wind induced deflection component, but it may nevertheless be significant in winds that exceed 4&amp;nbsp;m/s (14.4&amp;nbsp;km/h or 9&amp;nbsp;mph).

====Magnus effect and bullet stability====
The Magnus effect has a significant role in bullet stability because the Magnus force does not act upon the bullet's center of gravity, but the center of pressure affecting the ''yaw'' of the bullet. The Magnus effect will act as a ''destabilizing'' force on any bullet with a center of pressure located ''ahead'' of the center of gravity, while conversely acting as a ''stabilizing'' force on any bullet with the center of pressure located ''behind'' the center of gravity. The location of the center of pressure depends on the flow field structure, in other words, depending on whether the bullet is in supersonic, transonic or subsonic flight. What this means in practice depends on the shape and other attributes of the bullet, in any case the Magnus force greatly affects stability because it tries to "twist" the bullet along its flight path.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nennstiel-ruprecht.de/bullfly/fig10.htm Nenstiel The Magnus force]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nennstiel-ruprecht.de/bullfly/fig11.htm Nenstiel The Magnus moment]&lt;/ref&gt;

Paradoxically, [[very-low-drag bullet]]s due to their length have a tendency to exhibit greater Magnus destabilizing errors because they have a greater surface area to present to the oncoming air they are travelling through, thereby reducing their aerodynamic efficiency. This subtle effect is one of the reasons why a calculated C&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; or BC based on shape and sectional density is of limited use.

===Poisson effect===
Another minor cause of drift, which depends on the nose of the projectile being above the trajectory, is the Poisson Effect. This, if it occurs at all, acts in the same direction as the gyroscopic drift and is even less important than the Magnus effect. It supposes that the uptilted nose of the projectile causes an air cushion to build up underneath it. It further supposes that there is an increase of friction between this cushion and the projectile so that the latter, with its spin, will tend to roll off the cushion and move sideways.

This simple explanation is quite popular. There is, however, no evidence to show that increased pressure means increased friction and unless this is so, there can be no effect. Even if it does exist it must be quite insignificant compared with the gyroscopic and Coriolis drifts.

Both the Poisson and Magnus Effects will reverse their directions of drift if the nose falls below the trajectory. When the nose is off to one side, as in equilibrium yaw, these effects will make minute alterations in range.

===Coriolis drift===
&lt;!--- this subsection is linked to from the article Coriolis force.  Please do not change the title of this subsection without either adding an appropriate anchor or making the appropriate amendments to all articles which link to this subsection ----&gt;
The [[Coriolis effect]] causes Coriolis drift in a direction perpendicular to the Earth's axis; for most locations on Earth and firing directions, this deflection includes horizontal and vertical components. The deflection is to the right of the trajectory in the northern hemisphere, to the left in the southern hemisphere, upward for eastward shots, and downward for westward shots.  The vertical Coriolis deflection is also known as the [[Eötvös effect]]. Coriolis drift is not an aerodynamic effect; it is a consequence of the rotation of the Earth.

The magnitude of the Coriolis effect is small. For [[small arms]], the magnitude of the Coriolis effect is generally insignificant (for high powered rifles in the order of about {{convert|10|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} at {{convert|1000|m|yd|0|abbr=on}}), but for ballistic projectiles with long flight times, such as extreme long-range rifle projectiles, [[artillery]], and [[rockets]] like [[intercontinental ballistic missiles]], it is a significant factor in calculating the trajectory. The magnitude of the drift depends on the firing and target location, [[azimuth]] of firing, projectile velocity and time of flight.

====Horizontal effect====
Viewed from a non-rotating reference frame (i.e. not one rotating with the Earth) and ignoring the forces of gravity and air resistance, a projectile moves in a straight line.  When viewed from a reference frame fixed with respect to the Earth, that straight trajectory appears to curve sideways.  The direction of this horizontal curvature is to the right in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern hemisphere, and does not depend on the azimuth of the shot. The horizontal curvature is largest at the poles and decreases to zero at the equator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://bryanlitz.bravehost.com/GyroCor.html |title=Gyroscopic Drift and Coreolis Acceleration by Bryan Litz |access-date=2008-06-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114233524/http://bryanlitz.bravehost.com/GyroCor.html |archive-date=2007-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vertical (Eötvös) effect====
The Eötvös effect changes the perceived gravitational pull on a moving object based on the relationship between the direction and velocity of movement and the direction of the Earth's rotation.&lt;ref name="The Eötvös effect"&gt;[http://www.cleonis.nl/physics/phys256/eotvos.php The Eötvös effect]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Geophysics |edition=illustrated |first1=William |last1=Lowrie |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-521-46728-4 |page=45 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vR2RJSIGVoC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=7vR2RJSIGVoC&amp;pg=PA45 Extract of page 45]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Eötvös effect is largest at the equator and decreases to zero at the poles. It causes eastward-traveling projectiles to deflect upward, and westward-traveling projectiles to deflect downward. The effect is less pronounced for trajectories in other directions, and is zero for trajectories aimed due north or south. In the case of large changes of momentum, such as a spacecraft being launched into Earth orbit, the effect becomes significant. It contributes to the fastest and most fuel-efficient path to orbit: a launch from the equator that curves to a directly eastward heading.

==Equipment factors==
Though not forces acting on projectile trajectories there are some equipment related factors that influence trajectories. Since these factors can cause otherwise unexplainable external ballistic flight behavior they have to be briefly mentioned.

===Lateral jump===
Lateral jump is caused by a slight lateral and rotational movement of a gun barrel at the instant of firing. It has the effect of a small error in bearing. The effect is ignored, since it is small and varies from round to round.

===Lateral throw-off===
Lateral throw-off is caused by mass imbalance in applied spin stabilized projectiles or pressure imbalances during the [[Transitional ballistics|transitional flight phase]] when a projectile leaves a gun barrel off axis leading to static imbalance. If present it causes dispersion. The effect is unpredictable, since it is generally small and varies from projectile to projectile, round to round and/or gun barrel to gun barrel.

==Maximum effective small arms range==
The maximum practical range&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The [http://www.snipersparadise.com/ballistics/bulletbasics.htm snipershide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107104656/http://www.snipersparadise.com/ballistics/bulletbasics.htm |date=2007-11-07 }} website defines effective range as: The range in which a competent and trained individual using the firearm has the ability to hit a target sixty to eighty percent of the time. In reality, most firearms have a true range much greater than this but the likelihood of hitting a target is poor at greater than effective range. There seems to be no good formula for the effective ranges of the various firearms. {{cite web |url=http://www.snipersparadise.com/ballistics/bulletbasics.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071107104656/http://www.snipersparadise.com/ballistics/bulletbasics.htm |archivedate=November 7, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of all [[small arms]] and especially high-powered [[sniper rifle]]s depends mainly on the aerodynamic or ballistic efficiency of the spin stabilised projectiles used. Long-range shooters must also collect relevant information to calculate elevation and windage corrections to be able to achieve first shot strikes at point targets. The data to calculate these fire control corrections has a long list of variables including:&lt;ref&gt;The US Army Research Laboratory did a study in 1999 on the practical limits of several sniper weapon systems and different methods of fire control. [http://www.arl.army.mil/arlreports/1999/ARL-TR-2065.pdf Sniper Weapon Fire Control Error Budget Analysis - Raymond Von Wahlde, Dennis Metz, August 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;
* ballistic coefficient or test derived drag coefficients (Cd)/behavior of the bullets used
* height of the sighting components above the rifle bore axis
* the zero range at which the sighting components and rifle combination were sighted in
* bullet mass
* actual [[muzzle velocity]] (powder temperature affects muzzle velocity, primer ignition is also temperature dependent)
* range to target
* supersonic range of the employed gun, cartridge and bullet combination
* inclination angle in case of uphill/downhill firing
* target speed and direction
* [[wind]] speed and direction (main cause for horizontal projectile deflection and generally the hardest ballistic variable to measure and judge correctly. Wind effects can also cause vertical deflection.)
* air [[pressure]], [[temperature]], [[altitude]] and [[humidity]] variations (these make up the ambient [[air density]])
* [[Earth's gravity]] (changes slightly with [[latitude]] and [[altitude]]) 
* [[gyroscopic]] drift (horizontal and vertical plane gyroscopic effect — often known as [[magnus effect|spin drift]] - induced by the barrel's twist direction and twist rate)
* [[Coriolis effect]] drift ([[latitude]], direction of fire and [[Northern Hemisphere|northern or southern hemisphere]] data dictate this effect)
* [[Eötvös effect]] (interrelated with the Coriolis effect, latitude and direction of fire dictate this effect)
* aerodynamic jump (the vertical component of cross wind deflection caused by lateral (wind) impulses activated during free flight or at or very near the muzzle leading to dynamic imbalance)&lt;ref name="arl.army.mil"/&gt;
* lateral throw-off (dispersion that is caused by mass imbalance in the applied projectile or it leaving the barrel off axis leading to static imbalance)
* the inherent potential accuracy and adjustment range of the sighting components
* the inherent potential accuracy of the rifle
* the inherent potential accuracy of the ammunition
* the inherent potential accuracy of the computer program and other firing control components used to calculate the trajectory

The ambient air density is at its maximum at Arctic sea level conditions. Cold [[gunpowder]] also produces lower pressures and hence lower muzzle velocities than warm powder. This means that the maximum practical range of rifles will be at it shortest at Arctic sea level conditions.

The ability to hit a point target at great range has a lot to do with the ability to tackle environmental and meteorological factors and a good understanding of exterior ballistics and the limitations of equipment. Without (computer) support and highly accurate [[laser rangefinder]]s and meteorological measuring equipment as aids to determine ballistic solutions, long-range shooting beyond 1000 m (1100 yd) at unknown ranges becomes guesswork for even the most expert long-range marksmen.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;An example of how accurate a long-range shooter has to establish sighting parameters to calculate a correct ballistic solution is explained by these test shoot results. A .338 Lapua Magnum rifle sighted in at 300 m shot 250 [[grain (measure)|grain]] (16.2 g) Lapua Scenar bullets at a measured muzzle velocity of 905 m/s. The [[air density]] ρ during the test shoot was 1.2588 [[kilogram per cubic metre|kg/m³]]. The test rifle needed 13.2 mils (45.38 [[minute of arc|MOA]]) elevation correction from a 300 m zero range at 61 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] latitude ([[acceleration of free fall|gravity]] changes slightly with latitude) to hit a human torso sized target dead centre at 1400 m. The ballistic curve plot showed that between 1392 m and 1408 m the bullets would have hit a 60 cm (2 ft) tall target. This means that if only a 0.6% ranging error was made a 60 cm tall target at 1400 m would have been completely missed. When the same target was set up at a less challenging 1000 m distance it could be hit between 987 m and 1013 m, meaning a 1.3% ranging error would just be acceptable to be able to hit a 2 MOA tall target with a .338 Lapua Magnum sniper round. This makes it obvious that with increasing distance apparently minor measuring and judgment errors become a major problem.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Using ballistics data==
Here is an example of a ballistic table for a .30 calibre Speer 169 grain (11 g) pointed boat tail match bullet, with a BC of 0.480. It assumes sights 1.5&amp;nbsp;inches (38&amp;nbsp;mm) above the bore line, and sights adjusted to result in point of aim and point of impact matching 200&amp;thinsp;yards (183&amp;thinsp;m) and 300&amp;thinsp;yards (274&amp;thinsp;m) respectively.

This table demonstrates that, even with a fairly aerodynamic bullet fired at high velocity, the "bullet drop" or change in the point of impact is significant. This change in point of impact has two important implications. Firstly, estimating the distance to the target is critical at longer ranges, because the difference in the point of impact between 400 and {{convert|500|yd|abbr=on}} is 25–32&amp;thinsp;in (depending on zero), in other words if the shooter estimates that the target is 400&amp;thinsp;yd away when it is in fact 500&amp;thinsp;yd away the shot will impact 25–32&amp;thinsp;in (635–813&amp;thinsp;mm) below where it was aimed, possibly missing the target completely. Secondly, the rifle should be zeroed to a distance appropriate to the typical range of targets, because the shooter might have to aim so far above the target to compensate for a large bullet drop that he may lose sight of the target completely (for instance being outside the field of view of a telescopic sight). In the example of the rifle zeroed at {{convert|200|yd|abbr=on}}, the shooter would have to aim 49&amp;thinsp;in or more than 4&amp;thinsp;ft (1.2&amp;thinsp;m) above the point of impact for a target at 500&amp;thinsp;yd.

The '''Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems ISE''' (or Fraunhofer ISE) is an institute of the [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft]]. Located in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg, Germany]], The Institute  performs applied scientific and engineering [[research and development]]  for all areas of [[solar energy]]. Fraunhofer ISE has three external branches in Germany which carry out work on solar cell and semiconductor material development: the Laboratory and Service Center (LSC) in [[Gelsenkirchen]], the Technology Center of Semiconductor Materials (THM) in Freiberg, and the Fraunhofer Center for Silicon Photovoltaics (CSP) in [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]].&lt;ref name= "bwi"&gt;{{cite web|title=Photovoltaic Guide|url=http://www.bw-i.de/fileadmin/user_upload/redbw-i/Informationsmaterialien/Brancheninformationen/Photovoltaik.pdf|publisher=Baden-Württemberg International, Agency for International Economic and Scientific Cooperation|accessdate=13 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006, Prof. Dr. Eicke R. Weber is the director of Fraunhofer ISE. With over 1,100 employees, Fraunhofer ISE is the largest institute for applied solar energy research in Europe. The 2012 Operational Budget including investments is 74.3 million euro.&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;

==History==
Fraunhofer ISE was founded in 1981 by Prof. [[Adolf Goetzberger]] in Freiburg, Germany. It was the first non-university establishment for applied solar energy research in Europe.  The first areas of focus were the fluorescent collector FLUKO, transparent insulation and the initial steps towards high efficiency silicon and III-V solar cells, silicon thin film solar cells and material research.&lt;ref name=Janzing&gt;{{cite book|last=Janzing|first=Bernward|title=Solare Zeiten|date=2011|publisher=Bernward Janzing|location=Freiburg/Germany|isbn=978-3-9814265-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in 1983, the first fully electronic so-called "ISE inverter"  was developed for use in autonomous photovoltaic systems. {{citation needed |date=June 2012}} In 1986,  the first serial product using fluorescent collectors as a power supply was produced.{{citation needed |date=June 2012}} Within the PV small device program, numerous other successful products were developed. When the clean room was put into operation in 1989, the production of high efficiency solar cells began. In 1998, selective solar absorber coatings, which were developed at Fraunhofer ISE for solar thermal collectors, were put into industrial-scale production.{{citation needed |date=June 2012}}

In 2011 Fraunhofer ISE celebrated its 30th anniversary. Since its founding, the scientists have received many prestigious prizes and awards for their research results in the field.{{which|date=June 2012}}

==Research and Development==
The solar energy research at Fraunhofer ISE establishes the technical prerequisites for an efficient and environmentally friendly energy supply for industrial as well as threshold and developing countries.  The institute is committed to moving away from fossil fuels and nuclear power and moving towards a 100% renewable energy supply with the aim of providing affordable solutions for the energy transformation.

To this purpose, the institute develops materials, components, systems and processes for basic research and beyond. The areas of expertise include the development of production techniques and prototypes, setting up and monitoring demonstration systems and operating indoor and outdoor testing and calibration centers.&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;

The various areas of research at Fraunhofer ISE are categorized into the following business areas:

'''Energy Efficient Buildings''' &lt;br /&gt; At Fraunhofer ISE, energy-efficient buildings are one of the main areas of research. Teaming up with architects, expert planners and the industry, the researchers at Fraunhofer ISE optimize the performance of existing building and develop the buildings of tomorrow with consideration to the economic aspects, the energy efficiency and the user comfort. Through its involvement in the [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA), the Institute contributes in the establishment of the international boundary conditions for the realization of these concepts. In this business area, many disciplines come together: from material research and coating development through to component and system development and finally the required tests.&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;

'''Applied Optics and functional Surfaces''' &lt;br /&gt; Solar energy systems convert solar radiation incident on the earth into thermal, electrical or chemical energy. In order to better transmit, reflect, absorb, filter, redirect or concentrate the incoming radiation, Fraunhofer ISE develops optical components and systems. This business area serves as an interdisciplinary field and serves many areas of solar technology: windows and facades, solar thermal collectors, concentrator systems for photovoltaics and solar power plants as well as photovoltaic module technology.&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;

'''Solar Thermal Systems''' &lt;br /&gt; This business area covers the markets of low and high temperature applications. Solar thermal collectors and collector systems with flat or evacuated tube collectors find numerous applications in the practice.  These include process water and solar heating systems, cooling and ventilation systems and sea water desalination systems. Also façade-integrated collectors are implemented. With linear concentrating collectors, operating temperatures from 150&amp;nbsp;°C to over 400&amp;nbsp;°C are achieved. Both trough and parabolic collectors are not only used for solar thermal power production in large power plants, but also in simpler and more cost-effective plants for the production of process heat, process steam and driving heat for absorption chillers.&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;

'''Silicon Photovoltaics''' &lt;br /&gt; Especially due to the market introduction programs in Japan and Germany, the role of photovoltaics is gaining more and more on importance. More than 85% of the solar cells produced worldwide are based on crystalline silicon. The price-performance ratio, long-term stability and the cost-reduction potential indicate that this top performer in the terrestrial photovoltaic market will retain its place as market leader longer than just the next decade. Fraunhofer ISE's expertise ranges over the entire value chain of crystalline silicon photovoltaics, starting from material development and crystallization, through to solar cell processing and photovoltaic module technology.&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;

'''Photovoltaic Modules and Systems''' &lt;br /&gt; Module technology converts solar cells into a robust product for reliable operation in PV power plants. Fraunhofer ISE supports the product development concentrating on increasing efficiencies, reducing costs and achieving the highest reliability. Over and above, the Institute offers its services for quality assurance of modules and power plants.&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;

'''Alternative Photovoltaic Technologies''' &lt;br /&gt; In addition to silicon photovoltaics, the solar cell research at Fraunhofer ISE also extends to other photovoltaic technologies: With III-V based semiconductors like gallium indium phosphide, aluminum gallium arsenide or gallium arsenide, the highest efficiencies can be reached today. The technology of the dye solar cells has developed well beyond the laboratory stage and organic solar cells are attractive especially due to the expected low manufacturing costs.&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;

'''Renewable Power Supply''' &lt;br /&gt; The construction of grid-connected systems is the largest market for the photovoltaic branch today. The Institute provides consultancy services for system planning, characterizes solar modules and carries out the technical analysis and performance testing of photovoltaic systems.&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;

Off-grid power supplies also are a focus of the ongoing research at the institute. People living in remote rural areas, the countless number of telecommunication systems, environmental measurement technology as well as portable electronic devices require an autonomous power supply, independent of the grid. Fraunhofer ISE develops renewable energy systems for this purpose.&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;

Fraunhofer ISE also performs research in the area of power electronics and controls. This includes inverter development and testing in a modern power electronics laboratory as well as research in the field of energy management including smart metering and smart grids.&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;

In future, vehicles will run partly or completely on electricity and draw their energy from the grid (electric and plug-in). Fraunhofer ISE is working at the interface between the vehicles and the grid on concepts for an environmentally acceptable power supply and the optimal integration of the vehicles into the electricity grid, including metering and billing systems.&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;

'''Hydrogen Technology''' &lt;br /&gt; In a fuel cell, hydrogen reacts with oxygen and sets useful energy free in the form of electricity and heat.  Since hydrogen does not exist in its pure form in nature, it must be produced from one of its many chemical compounds. At Fraunhofer ISE in the area of hydrogen technology, the research focuses on innovative technologies for hydrogen generation and on processes for the highly efficient conversion of hydrogen into electricity and heat using the most modern equipment. Together with partners from industry and science, components and complete fuel cell systems are developed for autonomous, portable as well as mobile applications.&lt;ref name="bwi" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;&lt;ref name=faz&gt;{{cite book|last=Franke|first=Wolf D|title=Kompendium Erneuerbare Energien|publisher=FAZ-Inst. für Management-, Markt- und Medieninformationen, 2009|location=Frankfurt am Main/Germany|isbn=978-3-89981-215-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spin-Offs==
To date, seven spin-off companies have been founded from the applied research results at Fraunhofer ISE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spin-offs - Fraunhofer ISE|url=https://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/en/about-us/spin-offs.html|website=www.ise.fraunhofer.de|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are the following:

* In 1999, PSE AG was founded to provide services and expertise on solar energy. In addition to compiling studies and reports, the company provides measurement and control technology and custom-made laboratory equipment.
* In 2001,  Holotools GmbH (now temicon GmbH - holotools) was founded to develop and manufacture functional surfaces for the management of light. One particular expertise, for example, is the production of large-area homogeneous microstructures for optical surfaces.
* In 2002, SorTech AG (renamed Fahrenheit AG as of March 2017) was spun off to exploit heat sources for producing cold, thus using low temperature heat as an energy source instead of electricity. As a result, Fahrenheit advanced the underlying technology, adsorption cooling, and produces chillers which use residual heat from a variety of sources to economically generate cold.
* Soitec Solar, founded in 2005, brought an innovative photovoltaic technology using concentrated sunlight to the market. With this technology, photovoltaic power stations from 100&amp;nbsp;kW up to several megawatts are further developed, manufactured, and installed.
* In 2014, Enit Energy IT Systems GmbH was spun off to develop and market energy management systems for medium-sized enterprises. These systems help customers gain more transparency about their electricity, heat and gas consumption. In addition, the company’s products enable intelligent system control and more efficient operation.

==Staff, Infrastructure and Financing==
The laboratory has a   staff of 1139, of whom 439 hold permanent positions. (as of 04/2012).

The research institute has a net floor area of 21,000 m² which contains offices, laboratories and test fields. New labs and office space are presently under construction.

The 2011 operational budget   totaled €61.3 million. Just five percent of the operational budget was basic funding, 90% from German federal funds and 10% from German state funds. About 50% was from contract research with industry; the  remainder stemmed from public and other sources. In 2011, annual investments amounted to €7.7 million. (as of 04/2012)&lt;ref name=ise /&gt;

In mathematics, an '''F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set''' (said '''F-sigma set''')  is a [[countable]] [[union (set theory)|union]] of [[closed set]]s. The notation originated in [[France]] with F for ''[[wikt:fermé#French|fermé]]'' (''[[French language|French]]'': closed) and σ for ''[[wikt:somme#French|somme]]'' (''French'': sum, union).&lt;ref name="ramtihs"&gt;{{citation|title=Real Analysis: Measure Theory, Integration, and Hilbert Spaces|first1=Elias M.|last1=Stein|first2=Rami|last2=Shakarchi|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|year=2009|isbn=9781400835560|page=23|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2Sg3Vug65AsC&amp;pg=PA23}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[metrizable]] spaces, every [[open set]] is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Infinite Dimensional Analysis: A Hitchhiker's Guide|first1=Charalambos D.|last1=Aliprantis|first2=Kim|last2=Border|publisher=Springer|year=2006|isbn=9783540295877|page=138|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vyXtR3vUhoC&amp;pg=PA138}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The complement of an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set is a [[G-delta set|G&lt;sub&gt;&amp;delta;&lt;/sub&gt; set]].&lt;ref name="ramtihs"/&gt; In a metrizable space, any closed set is a G&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; set.

The union of countably many F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; sets is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set, and the intersection of finitely many F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; sets is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set.  F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; is the same as &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\Sigma}^0_2&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Borel hierarchy]].

== Examples ==

Each closed set is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set.

The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; of rationals is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set. The set &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\setminus\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; of irrationals is not a F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set.

In a Tychonoff space, each countable set is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set, because a point &lt;math&gt;{x}&lt;/math&gt; is closed.

For example, the set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of all [[Point (geometry)|point]]s &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; in the [[Cartesian plane]] such that &lt;math&gt;x/y&lt;/math&gt; is [[rational number|rational]] is an F&lt;sub&gt;σ&lt;/sub&gt; set because it can be expressed as the union of all the [[line (mathematics)|line]]s passing through the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] with rational [[slope (mathematics)|slope]]:

:&lt;math&gt; A = \bigcup_{r \in \mathbb{Q}} \{(ry,y) \mid y \in \mathbb{R}\},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt;, is the set of rational numbers, which is a countable set.

*[[G-delta set|G&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; set]] — the [[duality (mathematics)|dual]] notion.

      <comment>/* Fischer–Tropsch process */ CO2 is removed, who cares about how</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15226">'''Gas to liquids''' ('''GTL''') is a [[oil refinery|refinery]] process to convert [[natural gas]] or other gaseous [[hydrocarbon]]s into longer-chain hydrocarbons, such as gasoline or diesel fuel. [[Methane]]-rich gases are converted into liquid [[synthetic fuel]]s. Two general strategies exist: (i) direct partial combustion of methane to methanol and (ii) [[Fischer–Tropsch process|Fischer-Tropsch]]-like processes that convert carbon monoxide and hydrogen into hydrocarbons. Strategy ii is followed by diverse methods to convert the hydrogen-carbon monoxide mixtures to liquids. Direct partial combustion has been demonstrated in nature but not replicated commercially.  Technologies reliant on partial combustion have been commercialized mainly in regions where natural gas is inexpensive.&lt;ref name="hook"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höök|first1=Mikael|last2=Fantazzini|first2=Dean|last3=Angelantoni|first3=André|last4=Snowden|first4=Simon|title=Hydrocarbon liquefaction: viability as a peak oil mitigation strategy|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A|date=2013|volume=372|issue=2006|doi=10.1098/rsta.2012.0319|PMID = 24298075|url = http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:670680|accessdate = 2009-06-03|bibcode=2013RSPTA.37220319H}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |last=Kaneko |first=Takao |last2=Derbyshire |first2=Frank |last3=Makino |first3=Eiichiro |last4=Gray |first4=David |last5=Tamura |first5=Masaaki |date=2001 |publisher=Wiley-VCH |isbn=9783527306732 |location=Weinheim |chapter=Coal Liquefaction |doi=10.1002/14356007.a07_197}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motivation for GTL is to produce liquid fuels, which are more readily transported than methane.  Methane must be cooled below its [[critical temperature]] of -82.3&amp;nbsp;°C in order to be liquified under pressure.  Because of the associated cryogenic apparatus, [[LNG tanker]]s are expensive, not to mention potentially dangerous. Methanol is a conveniently handled combustable liquid, but its [[energy density]] is half of that of gasoline.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.afdc.energy.gov/fuels/fuel_properties.php&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Methanier aspher LNGRIVERS.jpg|thumb|300px|Expensive [[LNG tanker]]s are required to transport methane.]]

==Fischer–Tropsch process==
{{Main|Fischer–Tropsch process}}
[[File:GTL process.GIF|thumb|350px|GTL process using the [[Fischer Tropsch]] method]]
The Fischer–Tropsch process starts with partial oxidation of [[methane]] (natural gas) to [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[hydrogen gas]] and water. The ratio of [[carbon monoxide]] to hydrogen is adjusted using the [[water gas shift reaction]], while the excess [[carbon dioxide]] is removed. Removing the water yields [[synthesis gas]] (syngas). Syngas is allowed to react over an iron or cobalt catalyst to produce liquid hydrocarbons, including alcohols.

==Methane to methanol process==
Methanol is made from [[methane]] (natural gas) in a series of three reactions:
;[[Fossil fuel reforming|Steam reforming]]
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CO + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{pad|2em}} Δ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;H = +206 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
;[[Water gas shift reaction|Water shift reaction]]
:CO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; {{pad|2.5em}} Δ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;H = -41 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
;Synthesis
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH {{pad|3.5em}} Δ&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;H = -92 kJ mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

The methanol thus formed may be converted to gasoline by the '''Mobil process''' and methanol-to-olefins.

==Methanol to gasoline (MTG) and methanol to olefins==
In the early 1970s, [[Mobil]] developed an alternative procedure in which natural gas is converted to syngas, and then [[methanol]]. The methanol reacts in the presence of a [[zeolite]] catalyst to form [[alkanes]]. In terms of mechanism, methanol is partially [[dehydration reaction|dehydrated]] to give [[dimethyl ether]]:
:2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The mixture of dimethyl ether and methanol is then further dehydrated over a zeolite catalyst such as [[ZSM-5]], which in practice is polymerized and hydrogenated to give a gasoline with hydrocarbons of five or more carbon atoms making up 80% of the fuel by weight.  The Mobile MTG process is no longer practiced. A more modern implementation of MTG is the Topsøe integrated gasoline synthesis (TIGS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Olsbye, U.; Svelle, S.; Bjorgen, M.; Beato, P.; Janssens, T. V. W.; Joensen, F.; Bordiga, S.; Lillerud, K. P.|title=Conversion of Methanol to Hydrocarbons: How Zeolite Cavity and Pore Size Controls Product Selectivity|journal=Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.|year=2012|volume=51|pages=5810–5831|doi=10.1002/anie.201103657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methanol can can be converted to olefins using zeolite and SAPO-based [[heterogeneous catalyst]]s. Depending on the catalyst pore size, this process can afford either C2 or C3 products, which are important monomers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Tian, P.; Wei, Y.; Ye, M.; Liu, Z.|title=Methanol to Olefins (MTO): From Fundamentals to Commercialization|journal=ACS Catal.|year=2015|volume=5|pages=1922–1938|doi=10.1021/acscatal.5b00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=New Trends in Olefin Production|authors=Ismaël Amghizar, Laurien A.

==Syngas to gasoline plus process (STG+)==
{{Main|Syngas to gasoline plus}}
[[File:STG+ Process.jpg|thumb|350px|The STG+ Process]]
A third gas-to-liquids process builds on the MTG technology by converting natural gas-derived syngas into drop-in gasoline and jet fuel via a thermochemical single-loop process.&lt;ref name="Bridge2Biofuels"&gt;LaMonica, Martin. [http://www.technologyreview.com/view/428356/natural-gas-tapped-as-bridge-to-biofuels/ Natural Gas Tapped as Bridge to Biofuels] ''MIT Technology Review'', 27 June 2012. Retrieved: 7 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The STG+ process follows four principal steps in one continuous process loop. This process consists of four [[Packed bed|fixed bed reactors]] in series in which a [[syngas]] is converted to synthetic fuels. The steps for producing high-octane synthetic gasoline are as follows:&lt;ref name="STG+ White Paper"&gt;[http://www.primusge.com/press-room/white-papers/ Introduction to Primus' STG+ Technology] ''Primus Green Energy'', undated. Retrieved: 5 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

#[[Methanol|Methanol Synthesis]]: Syngas is fed to Reactor 1, the first of four reactors, which converts most of the syngas (CO and {{chem2|H2}}) to methanol ({{chem2|CH3OH}}) when passing through the catalyst bed.
#[[Dimethyl ether|Dimethyl Ether]] (DME) Synthesis: The methanol-rich gas from Reactor 1 is next fed to Reactor 2, the second STG+ reactor. The methanol is exposed to a [[Catalysis|catalyst]] and much of it is converted to DME, which involves a dehydration from methanol to form DME ({{chem2|CH3OCH3}}).
#Gasoline synthesis: The Reactor 2 product gas is next fed to Reactor 3, the third reactor containing the catalyst for conversion of DME to hydrocarbons including paraffins ([[alkane]]s), [[Aromaticity|aromatics]], naphthenes ([[cycloalkane]]s) and small amounts of olefins ([[alkene]]s), mostly from {{chem2|C6}} (number of carbon atoms in the hydrocarbon molecule) to {{chem2|C10}}.
#Gasoline Treatment: The fourth reactor provides [[transalkylation]] and [[hydrogenation]] treatment to the products coming from Reactor 3.  The treatment reduces [[durene]] (tetramethylbenzene)/isodurene and trimethylbenzene components that have high freezing points and must be minimized in gasoline.  As a result, the synthetic gasoline product has high octane and desirable viscometric properties.
#Separator: Finally, the mixture from Reactor 4 is condensed to obtain gasoline. The non-condensed gas and gasoline are separated in a conventional condenser/separator. Most of the non-condensed gas from the product separator becomes recycled gas and is sent back to the feed stream to Reactor 1, leaving the synthetic gasoline product composed of paraffins, aromatics and naphthenes.

==Biological gas-to-liquids (Bio-GTL)==
With methane as the predominant target for GTL, much attention has focused on the three enzymes that process methane. These enzymes support the existence of [[methanotroph]]s, microorganisms that metabolize methane as their only source of carbon and energy. Aerobic methanotrophs harbor enzymes that oxygenate of methane to methanol.  The relevant enzymes are [[methane monooxygenase]]s, which are found both in soluble and particulate (i.e. membrane-bound) varieties.  They catalyze the oxygenation according to the following stoichiometry:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NADPH  +  H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  →  CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  +  NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

Anaerobic methanotrophs rely on the bioconversion of methane using the enzymes called [[methyl-coenzyme M reductase]]s.  These organisms effect reverse [[methanogenesis]].  Strenuous efforts have been made to elucidate the mechanisms of these methane-converting enzymes, which would enable their catalysis to be replicated in vitro.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Lawton, T. J.; Rosenzweig, A. C.|title=Biocatalysts for methane conversion: big progress on breaking a small substrate|journal=Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol.|year=2016|volume=35|pages=142–149|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.10.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biodiesel]] can be made from {{CO2}} using the microbes [[Moorella thermoacetica]] and [[Yarrowia lipolytica]]. This process is known as biological gas-to-liquids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/113/14/3717.full Microbes paired for biological gas-to-liquids (Bio-GTL) process]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial uses==
Using gas-to-liquids processes, refineries can convert some of their gaseous waste products ([[flare gas]]) into valuable [[fuel oil]]s, which can be sold as is or blended only with [[diesel fuel]]. The [[World Bank]] estimates that over {{convert|150|e9m3}} of natural gas are [[Flared gas|flared]] or vented annually, an amount worth approximately $30.6&amp;nbsp;billion, equivalent to 25% of the United States' gas consumption or 30% of the European Union's annual gas consumption,&lt;ref&gt;[http://go.worldbank.org/ESORQZPSJ0 World Bank, GGFR Partners Unlock Value of Wasted Gas"], ''World Bank'' 14 December 2009. Retrieved 17 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; a resource that could be useful using GTL.  Gas-to-liquids processes may also be used for the economic extraction of gas deposits in locations where it is not economical to build a pipeline. This process will be increasingly significant as [[crude oil]] resources are [[Peak Oil|depleted]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3734">In [[fluid dynamics]], the derivation of the '''[[Hagen–Poiseuille flow]] from the Navier–Stokes equations''' shows how this [[fluid flow|flow]] is an exact solution to the [[Navier–Stokes equations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Frank M.|title=Fluid Mechanics|edition=5|year=2003|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{cite book | author=Bird, Stewart, Lightfoot | title=Transport Phenomena | year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Derivation==
The [[laminar flow]] through a pipe of uniform (circular) cross-section is known as Hagen–Poiseuille flow. The equations governing the Hagen–Poiseuille flow can be derived directly from the [[Navier–Stokes equations#Representations|Navier–Stokes momentum equations in 3D cylindrical coordinates]] by making the following set of assumptions:

# The flow is steady ( &lt;math&gt; \partial(...)/\partial t = 0 &lt;/math&gt; ).
# The radial and swirl components of the fluid velocity are zero ( &lt;math&gt; u_r = u_\theta = 0 &lt;/math&gt; ).
# The flow is axisymmetric ( &lt;math&gt; \partial(...)/\partial \theta = 0 &lt;/math&gt; ).
# The flow is fully developed (&lt;math&gt; \partial u_z/\partial z = 0 &lt;/math&gt; ). However, this can be proved via mass conservation, and the above assumptions.

Then the angular equation in the momentum equations and the [[continuity equation]] are identically satisfied. The first momentum equation reduces to &lt;math&gt; \partial p/\partial r = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the [[pressure]] &lt;math&gt; p &lt;/math&gt; is a function of the axial coordinate &lt;math&gt; z &lt;/math&gt; only. The third momentum equation reduces to:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r \frac{\partial u_z}{\partial r}\right)= \frac{1}{\mu} \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.
:The solution is 
:&lt;math&gt; u_z = \frac{1}{4\mu} \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}r^2 + c_1 \ln r + c_2 &lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt; u_z &lt;/math&gt; needs to be finite at &lt;math&gt; r = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; c_1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;. The no slip [[boundary condition]] at the pipe wall requires that &lt;math&gt; u_z = 0&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; r = R &lt;/math&gt; (radius of the pipe), which yields 

:&lt;math&gt; c_2 =  -\frac{1}{4\mu} \frac{\partial p}{\partial z}R^2.&lt;/math&gt; 

Thus we have finally the following [[Parabola|parabolic]] [[velocity]] profile: 

:&lt;math&gt; u_z = -\frac{1}{4\mu} \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} (R^2 - r^2). &lt;/math&gt;

The maximum velocity occurs at the pipe centerline (&lt;math&gt; r=0 &lt;/math&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt; {u_z}_{max}=\frac{R^2}{4\mu} \left(-\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}\right). &lt;/math&gt;

The average velocity can be obtained by integrating over the pipe [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]]:
: &lt;math&gt; {u_z}_\mathrm{avg}=\frac{1}{\pi R^2} \int_0^R u_z \cdot 2\pi r dr = 0.5 {u_z}_\mathrm{max}. &lt;/math&gt;

The Hagen–Poiseuille equation relates the pressure drop &lt;math&gt; \Delta p&lt;/math&gt; across a circular pipe of length &lt;math&gt; L &lt;/math&gt; to the
average flow velocity in the pipe &lt;math&gt; {u_z}_\mathrm{avg} &lt;/math&gt; and other parameters. Assuming that the pressure decreases linearly across the length 
of the pipe, we have &lt;math&gt; - \frac{\partial p}{\partial z} = \frac{\Delta  p}{L} &lt;/math&gt; (constant). Substituting this and the expression for &lt;math&gt; {u_z}_\mathrm{max} &lt;/math&gt; into the expression for &lt;math&gt; {u_z}_\mathrm{avg} &lt;/math&gt;, and noting that the pipe diameter &lt;math&gt; D = 2R &lt;/math&gt;, we get: 
: &lt;math&gt; {u_z}_{avg} = \frac{D^2}{32 \mu}  \frac{\Delta p}{L}. &lt;/math&gt;
Rearrangement of this gives the Hagen–Poiseuille equation:
: &lt;math&gt; \Delta p  = \frac{32 \mu L ~{u_z}_\mathrm{avg}}{D^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

The '''Henry Seth Taylor steam buggy''' is the first known car built in [[Canada]]. It was built by Henry Seth Taylor, a watchmaker and jeweller in [[Stanstead, Quebec|Stanstead]], [[Quebec]] in 1867. It was unveiled at the Stanstead Fall Fair that year.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/autos/story/20150212-old-gold-the-henry-seth-taylor-steam-buggy |title=Old gold: The Henry Seth Taylor steam buggy |last1=Schultz |first1=Jonathan |last2= |first2= |date=February 12, 2015 |website=BBC Autos |publisher=BBC |access-date=February 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca/edu/ViewLoitDa.do;jsessionid=B5086890A2F909D2AC1506313FF3759E?method=preview&amp;lang=EN&amp;id=19537 |title=Henry Seth Taylor Steam Buggy, 1867

==Description==
[[File:Henry Seth Taylor Steam Buggy detail 3.JPG|thumbnail|right|Detail of the wheel and hoses under the vehicle.]]
The Buggy was modeled after a US-built steam car Taylor had seen in 1864. It was designed by Taylor to have a coal-fired boiler for the carriage. Fully pressurized, the steam was used to move a piston attached to the rear axle, producing forward motion. The vehicle does not have a reverse gear or brakes. It was able to travel at a sustained {{Convert|20|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The vehicle features thin strips of metal bent around the edge of the wheels in place of rubber tires. It is powered by a two-cylinder boiler mounted behind the driver. Steam is generated in the vertical coal-fired boiler, which is connected by rubber hoses to a six-gallon water tank located between the front wheels. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autofocus.ca/news-events/auto-retro/the-story-of-canada-s-first-car |title=The story of Canada’s first car
 |last1= Bubbers|first1=Matt |last2= |first2= |date=November 9, 2012 |website=AutoFocus.ca |publisher=Bell Media |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vehicle lacks a coal box, but has a storage nook for lump coal or wood under the driver’s perch.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

The vehicle weighs {{Convert|500|lbs}}. The boiler (as designed) can withstand {{Convert|60|lbs}} of pressure. It was the only example built, not having been meant for mass production; rather, it was exhibited as a curiosity at fairs around the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Forani |first=Jonathan |date=February 19, 2015 |title=In the beginning, there was Henry — Taylor, not Ford |url=https://www.thestar.com/autos/toronto_auto_show/2015/02/19/in-the-beginning-there-was-henry-taylor-not-ford.html |newspaper=The Toronto Star |location=Toronto |access-date=February 24, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and preservation==
The vehicle lay disassembled in a barn where the wood from the carriage body and wheels had rotted away; it was discovered in the 1950s and was purchased and later restored by American collector Richard Stewart. In 1983, it was purchased from Stewart by the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum]] in [[Ottawa]], where it has remained since.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; The original brass-work around the cylinders and the oil caps were found to be in "fantastic condition", but the boiler has been replaced two times.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

The vehicle is featured on a 43-cent stamp issued by [[Canada Post]] in 1993, as part of the '''Historic Land Vehicles''' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colnect.com/en/stamps/stamp/178100-Henry_Seth_Taylor_Steam_Buggy_1867-Historic_Land_Vehicles_Personal_Vehicles-Canada |title=Stamp catalog : Stamp ‹ Henry Seth Taylor Steam Buggy, 1867 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2015 |website=colnect.com |publisher= |access-date=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kota Damansara Community Forest Park''' ('''KDCFP''') is a secondary forest located in [[Selangor]], [[Malaysia]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 1. ''A Step Beyond The City''. [[Malaysian Nature Society]]. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It was part of a defunct '''Sungai Buloh Forest Reserve''' gazetted in 1898 which contained {{convert|3900|acre|km2|0}} of protected [[primary forest]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 2, 5. ''A Step Beyond The City''. [[Malaysian Nature Society]]. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This made it as the oldest forest reserve in [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. The forest reserve was degazetted a number of times and subsequent development brought down the size of the reserve to a {{convert|857|acre|km2|1|sing=on}}.

Logging activities especially has turned the area into a [[secondary forest]]. This results in the abundance of [[pioneer plant]]s as well as rare species of plant such as [[Begonia aequilateralis]].&lt;ref&gt;Page 8. ''A Step Beyond The City''. [[Malaysian Nature Society]]. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being a secondary forest, a number of primary forest species such as [[Shorea|meranti]] are observable at the park. Furthermore, KDCFP is a [[dipterocarp]] forest typically found in [[tropical]] countries such as Malaysia. The area is a combination of flat land and low elevation hill.&lt;ref&gt;Page 5. ''A Step Beyond The City''. [[Malaysian Nature Society]]. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The trademark of KDCFP is an [[artificial lake]]. The lake was created in early 2000s due to the building of a road that blocked a small stream that flows through the park. This has introduced aquatic flora and fauna attributable to slow-flowing water body to the area.&lt;ref&gt;Page 11. ''A Step Beyond The City''. [[Malaysian Nature Society]]. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current development==
[[Kota Damansara]] is a developing area and there are efforts to develop the area.&lt;ref&gt;Chun Wai, Wong. ''A grave matter''. [[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]]. April 8, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The local residents and the [[Malaysian Nature Society]] with aid from the [[United Nations Development Program]] through the [[Small Grants Programme|Small Grants Program]] are trying to protect the area from further development projects.

'''Lake Monoun''' is a &lt;!-- crater? --&gt;[[lake]] in [[West Province, Cameroon]], that lies in the [[Oku Volcanic Field]] {{coord|5.58|N|10.59|E}}. On August 15, 1984, the lake exploded in a [[limnic eruption]], which resulted in the release of a large amount of [[carbon dioxide]] that killed 37&amp;nbsp;people. At first, the cause of the deaths was a mystery, and causes such as terrorism were suspected. Further investigation and a similar event two years later at [[Lake Nyos]] led to the currently accepted explanation.

==Disaster==
Several people reported hearing a loud noise on August 15, 1984 around 22:30. A gas cloud reportedly emanated from a crater in the eastern part of the lake. The resulting deaths of residents in a low-lying area are believed to have occurred between 03:00 and dawn. The victims were said to have skin burns, which reports later clarified as "skin damage" such as discoloration. Survivors reported that the whitish, smoke-like cloud smelled bitter and acidic. Vegetation was flattened around the eastern part of the lake, probably by a tsunami.

Although Lake Monoun is near the center of a [[volcanic field]] that includes at least 34 recent craters, the subsequent investigation found that the event was not caused by an eruption or sudden ejection of volcanic gas from the lake. Rather, emission of carbon dioxide in a limnic eruption is thought to be to blame. The cloud's smell and skin damage to victims were not fully explained. Some theories attribute the skin problems to a combination of preexisting conditions and routine postmortem effects like [[livor mortis]], although there is no clear consensus.

Among the victims were some of the riders in a truck carrying twelve people. The truck's engine stopped working, and the people inside the truck got out and were killed. Two people sitting on top of the truck survived, because their elevated position allowed them to breathe - carbon dioxide is heavier than air (oxygen and nitrogen) which causes it to stay close to the ground.

Two years later, on 21 August 1986, a similar and even more deadly event occurred at Lake Nyos, about {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} NNW, killing about 1746 people and more than 3,000 livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=1986: Hundreds gassed in Cameroon lake disaster|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/21/newsid_3380000/3380803.stm|accessdate=9 June 2016|agency=bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|date=21 August 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Lake Nyos and [[Lake Kivu]], Lake Monoun is one of three lakes in the world known to have high concentrations of gas dissolved deep below the surface and which have the right conditions for a limnic eruption.

==Degassing==
In 2003, a venting pipe was inserted into the lake, in an effort to prevent the disaster from recurring. Initially a pump was needed to pull water from the bottom, but as carbon dioxide began to come out of [[solution]] it created [[buoyancy]] in the water in the pipes, allowing the pump to be turned off.

However, a study in September 2005 by George Kling and other researchers at the University of Michigan found that gas was not being removed from the lake quickly enough to ensure that the disaster never happens again. Kling recommended the lowering of the existing pipe and the addition of a new one in order to release more carbon dioxide.

==Research and development==
In November 2010, Lehigh expanded its in-house capabilities with the launch of the Application &amp; Development Center (ADC), a dedicated research and development facility staffed by a team of industry professionals. The stated mission of the ADC is to develop new applications for MRP and to accelerate adoption of existing MRP applications by improving understanding of MRP chemistry, providing expert advice for new material formulations that incorporate MRP, and developing new materials based on MRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lehigh Launches its Application &amp; Development Center|url=http://www.lehightechnologies.com/index.php/news_events/press_releases/lehigh_launches_its_application_development_center/|publisher=Lehigh Technologies|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2014, Lehigh announced an expansion of its ADC that includes the hiring of new technical staff and investment in new mixing and analytical equipment. According to Lehigh, this expansion improves the ADC’s ability to develop functional materials based on MRP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Lehigh invests in mixing equipment, hires tech manager|url=http://www.rubbernews.com/article/20140121/NEWS/140129981/lehigh-invests-in-mixing-equipment-hires-tech-manager|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=Rubber News|date=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investors==
Since 2008, Lehigh has raised more than $50&amp;nbsp;million from investors that include [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], [[Index Ventures]], Leaf Clean Energy and NGP Energy Technology Partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fehrenbacher|first=Katie|title=Kleiner, Index Invest $34.5M in Rubber Recycler Lehigh|url=http://gigaom.com/2008/06/23/kleiner-index-invest-345m-in-rubber-recycler-lehigh/|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=GigaOM|date=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Karkaria|first=Urvaksh|title=Lehigh Technologies raised $5M from green tech venture firm|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/blog/atlantech/2012/07/lehigh-technologies-raised-5m-from.html|accessdate=30 May 2014|newspaper=Atlanta Business Chronicle|date=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==
{{Main|Micronized rubber powder}}

Lehigh has commercialized a proprietary cryogenic turbo mill technology that transforms end-of-life tires and post-industrial rubber materials into micronized rubber powders. Lehigh produces MRP from [[vulcanization|vulcanized]] [[elastomer]]ic material, most often end-of-life tire material. However, it can also be produced from post-industrial nitrile rubber, [[EPDM rubber|ethylene propylene diene monomer (EPDM)]], [[butyl]], and natural rubber compounds.

===Products===
Lehigh's MRPs are available in two product lines, PolyDyne and MicroDyne. Industries incorporating MRP into their products include tire, automotive, construction, industrial components and consumer products. It is also used as an additive in tires, plastics, asphalt, coatings, and sealants. MRP can also be incorporated into prime or recycled grade polypropylene (PP), high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and nylons. Additionally, the incorporation of MRPs in thermoplastic elastomers (TPE) and thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPV) makes it a feasible ingredient for automotive and building and construction applications.

The particle size distributions of Lehigh's MRP typically range from 830&amp;nbsp;[[µm]] (20 [[mesh (scale)|mesh]]) to 50&amp;nbsp;µm (300 mesh), and its MRP is free of foreign particulates, such as metal and fiber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Coren|first=Michael J.|title=Tires Are Being Turned Into The Newest Renewable Resource--All It Takes Is Some Freezing And Fine Chopping |url=http://www.fastcoexist.com/1681040/tires-are-being-turned-into-the-newest-renewable-resource-all-it-takes-is-some-freezing-and-|accessdate=15 July 2014|newspaper=Fast Company|date=20 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-Generation Technology===
Lehigh claims that its cryogenic turbo mill technology represents an evolution over previous post-manufactured rubber technologies. The most common rubber processing technology converts end-of-life tire and post-industrial rubber material into rubber chips that are typically one inch or larger in size. These chips are then used in tire-derived fuel and civil engineering projects. A second-generation processing technology converts end-of-life tire and rubber material into [[crumb rubber]], also known as ground tire rubber (GTR). GTR typically comprises chips between one inch and 30 mesh in size, with the associated fiber and steel mostly removed. This material is used in asphalt, as garden mulch and in playgrounds.

Because of the material's smaller size, Lehigh markets its micrometer-scale MRP as a third-generation rubber processing technology. MRP's size and composition enables it to be incorporated into advanced and higher-value applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Micronized Rubber Powder|url=http://lehightechnologies.com/index.php/what_we_do/what_is_micronized_rubber_powder|publisher=Lehigh Technologies|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sustainability==
Lehigh's MRP is used as a compound extender to replace natural rubber and synthetic polymers, as well as to act as a process aid in material production. Lehigh claims that because it replaces commodity-priced rubber- and oil-based feedstocks, MRP can reduce formulation costs. The company has asserted that MRP can offer up to 50 percent cost savings over virgin raw materials in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why use Micronized Rubber Powder|url=http://www.lehightechnologies.com/index.php/what_we_do/why_use_micronized_rubber/|publisher=Lehigh Technologies|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is derived from end-of-life materials, MRP can also improve the sustainability, and in some cases the performance, of the compounds in which it is used. For example, Lehigh has stated that the smaller particle sizes of MRP increase the impact strength of certain plastic compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Valk|first=Vincent|title=Lehigh Technologies: Specialty chemicals from scrap |url=http://www.chemweek.com/sections/specialty_chemicals/Lehigh-Technologies-Specialty-chemicals-from-scrap_62315.html|accessdate=15 July 2014|newspaper=IHS Chemical Week|date=7 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in all applications the particle size and loading levels depend on the target application.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1786">'''Lerwick District Heating and Energy Recovery Plant''' is a [[district heating]] scheme based in [[Lerwick]], [[Shetland]] and operated by the [[Shetland Islands Council]]. There is an additional input of heat from a private [[biomass]] plant. The main offices are located close to the [[Lerwick Power Station]] along with a 12&amp;nbsp;MWh heat accumulator. Heat is not provided from the power station as it is due to be closed.

==Heat distribution==
The [[district heating]] scheme has over 30&amp;nbsp;km of mains pipes connecting to 1,200 properties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sheap-ltd.co.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; These properties range from hospitals, schools, leisure centre, industry, retail to housing.

==Energy recovery plant==
The [[Incinerator|energy recovery plant]] burns 22,000&amp;nbsp;tonnes of waste per year from Shetland, Orkney and offshore and heats water for the district heating scheme.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shetland.gov.uk/waste/Energyrecovery.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future plans==
It is hoped that heat will be available from the proposed new power station due to be built by 2019.{{fact|date=February 2016}} However this cannot be guaranteed as there is a possibility that an interconnector cable, [[Shetland HVDC Connection]] will be laid to Shetland from the Scottish Mainland over 100&amp;nbsp;km away. The power station would still have to be built for security of supply. In the meantime a 2&amp;nbsp;MW electric powered heat pump to abstract heat from the sea is being planned for 2016. Another possibility being considered is electric boilers powered by wind turbines which could help grid stabilization.{{fact|date=February 2016}}

The '''Linkou Power Plant''' ({{zh|t=林口發電廠|p=Línkǒu Fādiànchǎng}}) is a [[coal-fired power plant]] in [[Linkou District]], [[New Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=156594&amp;CtNode=103&lt;/ref&gt; With the previous total installed capacity of 600 MW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalenergyobservatory.org/form.php?pid=4050 |title=Linkou (Lin-Kou) Coal Power Station Taiwan - GEO |publisher=Globalenergyobservatory.org |date=2010-02-15 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the power plant used to be the smallest coal-fired power plant in Taiwan. The power plant is currently undergoing retrofitting to increase its installed generation capacity to 2.4 GW.

==Events==

===1968===
The power plant began its operation on 18 July 1968 after a successful train run of its first 300 MW giant [[electric generator]] which started two weeks before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=156594&amp;CtNode=122|title=Linkou Thermal Power Plant Is Operational - Taiwan Today|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014===
On 1 September 2014, the current two unit generators were decommissioned.&lt;ref name="taipeitimes.com"/&gt;

===2016===
On 6 October 2016, the plant completed its refurbishment of its old two units and commissioned the new one [[Supercritical steam generator|supercritical]] unit of 800 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taiwantoday.tw/news.php?post=107040&amp;unit=8,32|first=Pat|last=Gao|date=1 January 2017|title=New Energy Model|publisher=Taiwan Today|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2017/04/14/2003668681|date=14 April 2017|first1=Wei-han|last1=Chen|title=Public-private funds to target pollution|publisher=Taipei Times|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017===
On 24 March 2017, the second of the 800 MW unit was commissioned.

==Future expansion==
One 800 MW ultra [[Supercritical steam generator|supercritical coal-fired]] unit is currently being built by [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]] and [[CTCI Corporation]] at the plant. The unit is expected to be commissioned in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.taipower.com.tw/e_content/content/report/..%5C..%5C..%5CUpFile%5CCompanyENFile%5C2013Taipower_English_EBook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://energyasia.com/public-stories/taiwan-ctci-japans-mhi-to-build-three-coal-fired-power-plants-for-taiwan-power-company/ |title=TAIWAN: CTCI, Japan’s MHI to build three coal-fired power plants for Taiwan Power Company |publisher=EnergyAsia |date=2011-09-09 |accessdate=2014-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd. |url=http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/news/story/1109011450.html |title=MHI Receives Order for 3 Coal-fired Supercritical Power Generation Units &amp;#124; Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Ltd |publisher=Mhi.co.jp |date=2011-09-01 |accessdate=2014-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204000643/http://www.mhi.co.jp/en/news/story/1109011450.html |archivedate=2013-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LPS.svg|thumb|200px|Structure of a lipopolysaccharide]]

'''Lipopolysaccharides''' ('''LPS'''), also known as lipoglycans and '''endotoxins''', are large [[molecule]]s consisting of a [[lipid]] and a [[polysaccharide]] composed of O-antigen, outer core and inner core joined by a [[covalent bond]]; they are found in the [[Bacterial outer membrane|outer membrane]] of [[Gram-negative bacteria]].

The term ''lipooligosaccharide'' ("LOS") is used to refer to a low-molecular-weight form of bacterial lipopolysaccharides.

==Discovery==
The toxic activity of LPS was first discovered and termed "endotoxin" by [[Richard Friedrich Johannes Pfeiffer]], who distinguished between [[exotoxins]], which he classified as a toxin that is released by bacteria into the surrounding environment, and endotoxins, which he considered to be a toxin kept "within" the bacterial cell and released only after destruction of the bacterial cell wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Parija SC | url =  https://books.google.com/books?id=HcgGLfxDJSQC | title = Textbook of Microbiology &amp; Immunology | publisher = Elsevier | location = India | date = Jan 1, 2009 | isbn = 8131221636}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84}}    Subsequent work showed that release of LPS from [[gram negative]] microbes does not necessarily require the destruction of the bacterial cell wall, but rather, LPS is secreted as part of the normal physiological activity of [[membrane vesicle trafficking]] in the form of [[Bacterial outer membrane vesicles | bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs)]], which may also contain other virulence factors and proteins.&lt;ref name="pmid20825345"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kulp A, Kuehn MJ | title = Biological functions and biogenesis of secreted bacterial outer membrane vesicles | journal = Annu. Rev. Microbiol. | volume = 64 | issue = | pages = 163–84 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20825345 | pmc = 3525469 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.091208.073413 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the term 'endotoxin' is mostly used synonymously with LPS,&lt;ref name="lipopolysaccharide"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rietschel ET, Kirikae T, Schade FU, Mamat U, Schmidt G, Loppnow H, Ulmer AJ, Zähringer U, Seydel U, Di Padova F | title = Bacterial endotoxin: molecular relationships of structure to activity and function | journal = FASEB J. | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 217–25 | year = 1994 | pmid = 8119492 | doi =  | url = http://www.fasebj.org/content/8/2/217.long | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131125215711/http://www.fasebj.org/content/8/2/217.long | archivedate = 2013-11-25 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; although there are a few endotoxins that are not related to LPS, such as the so-called [[delta endotoxin]] proteins secreted by ''[[Bacillus thuringiensis]]''.

== Functions in bacteria ==
LPS is the major component of the outer membrane of [[Gram-negative bacteria]], contributing greatly to the structural integrity of the bacteria, and protecting the membrane from certain kinds of chemical attack. LPS also increases the negative charge of the [[cell membrane]] and helps stabilize the overall membrane structure. It is of crucial importance to many Gram-negative bacteria, which die if it is mutated or removed; however, it appears that LPS is nonessential in at least some Gram-negative bacteria, such as ''Neisseria meningitidis'', ''Moraxella catarrhalis'', and ''Acinetobacter baumannii''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang G, Meredith TC, Kahne D | year = 2013 | title = On the essentiality of lipopolysaccharide to Gram-negative bacteria | journal = Curr. Opin. Microbiol. | volume = 16 | issue = 6| pages = 779–785 | pmc=3974409 | pmid=24148302 | doi=10.1016/j.mib.2013.09.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; LPS induces a strong response from normal animal [[immune system]]s. It has also been implicated in non-pathogenic aspects of bacterial ecology, including surface adhesion, [[bacteriophage]] sensitivity, and interactions with predators such as [[amoebae]].

LPS is required for the proper conformation of [[Omptin]] activity; however, smooth LPS will sterically hinder omptins.

==Composition==
[[File:Kdo2-lipidA.png|thumb|right|300px|The saccharolipid Kdo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-Lipid A. [[3-Deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid|Kdo]] residues in {{red|red}} (core), glucosamine residues in {{blue|blue}}, acyl chains in black and phosphate groups in {{green|green}}.]]

It comprises three parts: 
# O antigen (or O polysaccharide)
# [[Core oligosaccharide]]
# [[Lipid A]]

=== O-antigen ===
A repetitive [[glycan]] [[polymer]] contained within an LPS is referred to as the O [[antigen]], O [[polysaccharide]], or O side-chain of the bacteria.
The O antigen is attached to the core oligosaccharide, and comprises the outermost domain of the LPS molecule. The composition of the O chain varies from strain to strain. For example, there are over 160 different O antigen structures produced by different ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' strains.&lt;ref name="pmid12045108"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Raetz CR, Whitfield C | title = Lipopolysaccharide endotoxins | journal = Annu. Rev. Biochem. | volume = 71 | issue = | pages = 635–700 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12045108 | pmc = 2569852 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.biochem.71.110601.135414 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence or absence of O chains determines whether the LPS is considered rough or smooth. Full-length O-chains would render the LPS smooth, whereas the absence or reduction of O-chains would make the LPS rough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rittig MG, Kaufmann A, Robins A, Shaw B, Sprenger H, Gemsa D, Foulongne V, Rouot B, Dornand J | title = Smooth and rough lipopolysaccharide phenotypes of Brucella induce different intracellular trafficking and cytokine/chemokine release in human monocytes | journal = J. Leukoc. Biol. | volume = 74 | issue = 6 | pages = 1045–55 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12960272 | doi = 10.1189/jlb.0103015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria with rough LPS usually have more penetrable cell membranes to hydrophobic antibiotics, since a rough LPS is more [[hydrophobic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tsujimoto H, Gotoh N, Nishino T | title = Diffusion of macrolide antibiotics through the outer membrane of Moraxella catarrhalis | journal = J. Infect. Chemother. | volume = 5 | issue = 4 | pages = 196–200 | year = 1999 | pmid = 11810516 | doi = 10.1007/s101560050034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; O antigen is exposed on the very outer surface of the bacterial cell, and, as a consequence, is a target for recognition by host [[antibody|antibodies]].

===Core===
{{main|Core oligosaccharide}}
The Core domain always contains an oligosaccharide component that attaches directly to [[lipid A]] and commonly contains [[sugar]]s such as [[heptose]] and [[3-Deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid]] (also known as KDO, keto-deoxyoctulosonate).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hershberger C, Binkley SB | title = Chemistry and metabolism of 3-deoxy-D-mannooctulosonic acid. I. Stereochemical determination | journal = J. Biol. Chem. | volume = 243 | issue = 7 | pages = 1578–84 | year = 1968 | pmid = 4296687 | url = http://www.jbc.org/cgi/reprint/243/7/1578?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=&amp;fulltext=3-Deoxy-D-mannooctulosonic+Acid+&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;volume=243&amp;issue=7&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT }}&lt;/ref&gt; The LPS Cores of many bacteria also contain non-carbohydrate components, such as phosphate, amino acids, and ethanolamine substituents.

===Lipid A===
{{main|Lipid A}}
Lipid A is, in normal circumstances,  a [[phosphorylated]] [[glucosamine]] [[disaccharide]] decorated with multiple [[fatty acids]]. These hydrophobic fatty acid chains anchor the LPS into the bacterial membrane, and the rest of the LPS projects from the cell surface. The lipid A domain is responsible for much of the toxicity of [[Gram-negative bacteria]]. When bacterial cells are [[lysis|lysed]] by the [[immune system]], fragments of membrane containing lipid A are released into the circulation, causing fever, diarrhea, and possible fatal endotoxic shock (also called [[septic shock]]). The Lipid A moiety is a very conserved component of the LPS.&lt;ref name="pmid11948150"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tzeng YL, Datta A, Kolli VK, Carlson RW, Stephens DS | title = Endotoxin of Neisseria meningitidis composed only of intact lipid A: inactivation of the meningococcal 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid transferase | journal = J.

==Lipooligosaccharides==

Lipooligosaccharides (LOS) are glycolipids found in the outer membrane of some types of [[Gram-negative bacteria]], such as ''[[Neisseria]]'' spp. and ''[[Haemophilus]]'' spp. The term is synonymous with the low molecular weight form of bacterial LPS.&lt;ref name="Moran_et_al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Moran AP, Prendergast MM, Appelmelk BJ | title = Molecular mimicry of host structures by bacterial lipopolysaccharides and its contribution to disease | journal = FEMS Immunol. Med. Microbiol. | volume = 16 | issue = 2 | pages = 105–15 | year = 1996 | pmid = 8988391 | doi = 10.1016/s0928-8244(96)00072-7 | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8988391 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160923115811/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=8988391 | archivedate = 2016-09-23 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; LOS plays a central role in maintaining the integrity and functionality of the outer membrane of the [[Gram negative]] cell envelope.
Lipooligosaccharides play an important role in the pathogenesis of certain bacterial infections because they are capable of acting as [[immunostimulant|immunostimulators]] and immunomodulators.&lt;ref name="Moran_et_al" /&gt; Furthermore, LOS molecules are responsible for the ability of some bacterial strains to display molecular [[mimicry]] and [[antigenic variation|antigenic diversity]], aiding in the evasion of host immune defenses and thus contributing to the [[virulence]] of these bacterial [[strain (biology)|strains]].

Chemically, lipooligosaccharides lack O-antigens and possess only a lipid A-based outer membrane-anchoring moiety, and an oligosaccharide core.&lt;ref name="Kilar_et_al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kilár A, Dörnyei Á, Kocsis B | title = Structural characterization of bacterial lipopolysaccharides with mass spectrometry and on- and off-line separation techniques | journal = Mass Spectrom Rev | volume = 32 | issue = 2 | pages = 90–117 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23165926 | doi = 10.1002/mas.21352 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'', the [[lipid A]] portion of the molecule has a symmetrical structure and the inner core is composed of [[3-Deoxy-D-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid|3-deoxy-D-manno-2-octulosonic acid]] (KDO) and [[heptose]] (Hep) moieties. The outer core oligosaccharide chain varies depending on the bacterial [[strain (biology)|strain]].&lt;ref name="Moran_et_al" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kilar_et_al" /&gt;
The term lipooligosaccharide is used to refer to the low molecular weight form of bacterial lipopolysaccharides, which can be categorized into two forms: the high molecular weight (Mr, or smooth) form possesses a high molecular weight, repeating [[polysaccharide]] O-chain, while the low molecular weight (low-Mr or rough) form, lacks the O-chain but possesses a short oligosaccharide in its place.&lt;ref name="Moran_et_al" /&gt;

==LPS modifications==
The making of LPS can be modified in order to present a specific sugar structure. Those can be recognised by either other LPS (which enables to inhibit LPS toxins) or glycosyltransferases that use those sugar structure to add more specific sugars. 
It has recently been shown that a specific enzyme in the intestine ([[alkaline phosphatase]]) can detoxify LPS by removing the two phosphate groups found on LPS carbohydrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bates JM, Akerlund J, Mittge E, Guillemin K | title = Intestinal alkaline phosphatase detoxifies lipopolysaccharide and prevents inflammation in zebrafish in response to the gut microbiota | journal = Cell Host Microbe | volume = 2 | issue = 6 | pages = 371–82 | year = 2007 | pmid = 18078689 | pmc = 2730374 | doi = 10.1016/j.chom.2007.10.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This may function as an adaptive mechanism to help the host manage potentially toxic effects of gram-negative bacteria normally found in the small intestine. A different enzyme may detoxify LPS when it enters, or is produced in, animal tissues.  Neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells produce a lipase, acyloxyacyl hydrolase (AOAH), that inactivates LPS by removing the two secondary acyl chains from lipid A.  If they are given LPS parenterally, mice that lack AOAH develop high titers of non-specific antibodies, develop prolonged hepatomegaly, and experience prolonged endotoxin tolerance. LPS inactivation may be required for animals to restore homeostasis after parenteral LPS exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Munford R, Lu M, Varley AW | title=Kill the Bacteria...and Also Their Messengers?|journal=Advances in Immunology|date=2009|volume=103| pages=29–48 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2776(09)03002-8|pmid=19755182| pmc=2812913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological effects on hosts infected with gram-negative bacteria==

===Immune response===

LPS acts as the prototypical endotoxin because it binds the [[cluster of differentiation|CD14]]/[[TLR 4|TLR4]]/[[Lymphocyte antigen 96|MD2]] [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] complex in many cell types, but especially in [[monocytes]], [[dendritic cells]], [[macrophage]]s and [[B cell]]s, which promotes the secretion of pro-[[inflammation|inflammatory]] [[cytokine]]s, [[nitric oxide]], and [[eicosanoids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Abbas|first=Abul|title=Basic Immunology|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-1-4160-2974-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the cellular [[stress response]], [[superoxide]] is one of the major [[reactive oxygen species]] induced by LPS in various cell types that express TLR ([[toll-like receptor]]).

LPS is also an exogenous [[Pyrogen (fever)|pyrogen]] (fever-inducing substance).

Being of crucial importance to Gram-negative bacteria, these molecules make candidate targets for new [[antimicrobial]] agents.

Some researchers doubt reports of generalized toxic effects attributed to all lipopolysaccharides, in particular, for [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stewart I, Schluter PJ, Shaw GR | title = Cyanobacterial lipopolysaccharides and human health - a review | journal = Environ Health | volume = 5 | issue =  | pages = 7 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16563160 | pmc = 1489932 | doi = 10.1186/1476-069X-5-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

LPS function has been under experimental research for several years due to its role in activating many [[transcription factor]]s. LPS also produces many types of mediators involved in [[septic shock]]. Humans are much more sensitive to LPS than other animals (e.g., mice). A dose of 1&amp;nbsp;µg/kg induces shock in humans, but mice will tolerate a dose up to a thousand times higher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Warren HS, Fitting C, Hoff E, Adib-Conquy M, Beasley-Topliffe L, Tesini B, Liang X, Valentine C, Hellman J, Hayden D, Cavaillon JM | title = Resilience to bacterial infection: difference between species could be due to proteins in serum | journal = J.

Said et al. showed that LPS causes an [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]]-dependent inhibition of [[CD4 T-cell]] expansion and function by up-regulating [[PD-1]] levels on [[monocytes]] which leads to IL-10 production by monocytes after binding of PD-1 by [[PD-L1]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Said EA, Dupuy FP, Trautmann L, Zhang Y, Shi Y, El-Far M, Hill BJ, Noto A, Ancuta P, Peretz Y, Fonseca SG, Van Grevenynghe J, Boulassel MR, Bruneau J, Shoukry NH, Routy JP, Douek DC, Haddad EK, Sekaly RP | title = Programmed death-1-induced interleukin-10 production by monocytes impairs CD4+ T cell activation during HIV infection | journal = Nat.

Endotoxins are in large part responsible for the dramatic clinical manifestations of infections with pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria, such as ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'', the pathogens that causes [[meningococcal disease]], including [[meningococcemia]], [[Waterhouse–Friderichsen syndrome]], and [[meningitis]].

[[Bruce Beutler]] was awarded a portion of the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his work demonstrating that [[TLR4]] is the LPS receptor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Poltorak A, He X, Smirnova I, Liu MY, Van Huffel C, Du X, Birdwell D, Alejos E, Silva M, Galanos C, Freudenberg M, Ricciardi-Castagnoli P, Layton B, Beutler B | title = Defective LPS signaling in C3H/HeJ and C57BL/10ScCr mice: mutations in Tlr4 gene | journal = Science | volume = 282 | issue = 5396 | pages = 2085–8 | year = 1998 | pmid = 9851930 | doi = 10.1126/science.282.5396.2085 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2011/press.html|title=The 2011 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine - Press Release|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180323183552/https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2011/press.html|archivedate=23 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portions of the LPS from several bacterial strains have been shown to be chemically similar to human host cell surface molecules; the ability of some bacteria to present molecules on their surface which are chemically identical or similar to the surface molecules of some types of host cells is termed molecular [[mimicry]].&lt;ref name="Chastain_and_Miller"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chastain EM, Miller SD | title = Molecular mimicry as an inducing trigger for CNS autoimmune demyelinating disease | journal = Immunol.

Recently, a new study published has discovered that LPS can be sensed directly by hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) through the bonding with TLR4, causing them to proliferate in reaction to a systemic infection. This response activate the TLR4-TRIF-ROS-p38 signaling within the HSCs and through a sustained TLR4 activation can cause a proliferative stress, leading to impair their competitive repopulating ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takizawa|first=Hitoshi|last2=Fritsch|first2=Kristin|last3=Kovtonyuk|first3=Larisa V.|last4=Saito|first4=Yasuyuki|last5=Yakkala|first5=Chakradhar|last6=Jacobs|first6=Kurt|last7=Ahuja|first7=Akshay K.|last8=Lopes|first8=Massimo|last9=Hausmann|first9=Annika|date=2017-08-03|title=Pathogen-Induced TLR4-TRIF Innate Immune Signaling in Hematopoietic Stem Cells Promotes Proliferation but Reduces Competitive Fitness|journal=Cell Stem Cell|volume=21|issue=2|pages=225–240.e5|doi=10.1016/j.stem.2017.06.013|issn=1875-9777|pmid=28736216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infection in mice using ''[[S. typhimurium]]'' showed similar results, validating the experimental model also in vivo.

===Effect of variability on immune response===
[[File:Toll-like receptor pathways revised.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|[[Toll-like receptor]]s of the [[innate immune system]] recognize LPS and trigger an [[immune response]].]]

O-antigens (the outer carbohydrates) are the most variable portion of the LPS molecule, imparting the antigenic specificity. In contrast, lipid A is the most conserved part. However, lipid A composition also may vary (e.g., in number and nature of [[acyl]] chains even within or between genera). Some of these variations may impart antagonistic properties to these LPS. For example, [[Rhodobacter sphaeroides]] diphosphoryl lipid A (RsDPLA) is a potent antagonist of LPS in human cells, but is an agonist in hamster and equine cells.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

It has been speculated that conical Lipid A (e.g., from ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'') are more agonistic, less conical lipid A like those of ''Porphyromonas gingivalis'' may activate a different signal ([[TLR2]] instead of TLR4), and completely cylindrical lipid A like that of ''Rhodobacter sphaeroides'' is antagonistic to TLRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Netea MG, van Deuren M, Kullberg BJ, Cavaillon JM, Van der Meer JW | title = Does the shape of lipid A determine the interaction of LPS with Toll-like receptors? | journal = Trends Immunol. | volume = 23 | issue = 3 | pages = 135–9 | year = 2002 | pmid = 11864841 | doi = 10.1016/S1471-4906(01)02169-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Seydel U, Oikawa M, Fukase K, Kusumoto S, Brandenburg K | title = Intrinsic conformation of lipid A is responsible for agonistic and antagonistic activity | journal = Eur.

Normal human blood [[serum (blood)|serum]] contains anti-LOS antibodies that are bactericidal and patients that have infections caused by serotypically distinct strains possess anti-LOS antibodies that differ in their specificity compared with normal serum.&lt;ref name="Yamasaki_et_al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yamasaki R, Kerwood DE, Schneider H, Quinn KP, Griffiss JM, Mandrell RE | title = The structure of lipooligosaccharide produced by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, strain 15253, isolated from a patient with disseminated infection.

Chem. | volume = 269 | issue = 48 | pages = 30345–51 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7982947 | doi = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences in humoral immune response to different LOS types can be attributed to the structure of the LOS molecule, primarily within the structure of the oligosaccharide portion of the LOS molecule.&lt;ref name="Yamasaki_et_al" /&gt;
In ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'' it has been demonstrated that the antigenicity of LOS molecules can change during an infection due to the ability of these bacteria to synthesize more than one type of LOS,&lt;ref name="Yamasaki_et_al" /&gt; a characteristic known as [[phase variation]]. Additionally, ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'', as well as ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'',&lt;ref name="Moran_et_al" /&gt; are capable of further modifying their LOS ''in vitro'', for example through [[sialic acid|sialylation]] (modification with sialic acid residues), and as a result are able to increase their resistance to [[complement system|complement]]-mediated killing &lt;ref name="Yamasaki_et_al" /&gt; or even down-regulate complement activation&lt;ref name="Moran_et_al" /&gt; or evade the effects of [[bactericide|bactericidal]] antibodies.&lt;ref name="Moran_et_al" /&gt; Sialylation may also contribute to hindered [[neutrophil]] attachment and [[phagocytosis]] by immune system cells as well as a reduced oxidative burst.&lt;ref name="Moran_et_al" /&gt; ''[[Haemophilus somnus]]'', a pathogen of cattle, has also been shown to display LOS phase variation, a characteristic which may help in the evasion of [[bovine]] host immune defenses.&lt;ref name="Howard_et_al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howard MD, Cox AD, Weiser JN, Schurig GG, Inzana TJ | title = Antigenic diversity of Haemophilus somnus lipooligosaccharide: phase-variable accessibility of the phosphorylcholine epitope | journal = J.

Taken together, these observations suggest that variations in bacterial surface molecules such as LOS can help the pathogen evade both the [[humoral immunity|humoral]] (antibody and complement-mediated) and the [[cell-mediated immunity|cell-mediated]] (killing by neutrophils, for example) host immune defenses.

===non-canonical pathways of LPS recognition===
Recently, it was shown that in addition to [[TLR4]] mediated pathways, certain members of the family of the [[Transient receptor potential channel|transient receptor potential ion channels]] recognize LPS&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boonen|first=Brett|last2=Alpizar|first2=Yeranddy|last3=Meseguer|first3=Victor|last4=Talavera|first4=Karel|last5=Boonen|first5=Brett|last6=Alpizar|first6=Yeranddy A.|last7=Meseguer|first7=Victor M.|last8=Talavera|first8=Karel|date=2018-08-11|title=TRP Channels as Sensors of Bacterial Endotoxins|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2072-6651/10/8/326|journal=Toxins|language=en|volume=10|issue=8|pages=326|doi=10.3390/toxins10080326}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Health effects==

===Endotoxemia===

The presence of endotoxins in the blood is called endotoxemia. It can lead to [[septic shock]], if the immune response is severely pronounced.&lt;ref name="pmid20519895"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Opal SM | title = Endotoxins and other sepsis triggers | journal = Contrib Nephrol | volume = 167 | issue = | pages = 14–24 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20519895 | doi = 10.1159/000315915 | series = Contributions to Nephrology | isbn = 978-3-8055-9484-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, endotoxemia of intestinal origin, especially, at the [[host-pathogen interface]], is considered to be an important factor in the development of alcoholic hepatitis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ceccanti M, Attili A, Balducci G, Attilia F, Giacomelli S, Rotondo C, Sasso GF, Xirouchakis E, Attilia ML | title = Acute alcoholic hepatitis | journal = J. Clin. Gastroenterol. | volume = 40 | issue = 9 | pages = 833–41 | year = 2006 | pmid = 17016141 | doi = 10.1097/01.mcg.0000225570.04773.5d }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which is likely to develop on the basis of the [[small bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome]] and an increased [[intestinal permeability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parlesak A, Schäfer C, Schütz T, Bode JC, Bode C | title = Increased intestinal permeability to macromolecules and endotoxemia in patients with chronic alcohol abuse in different stages of alcohol-induced liver disease | journal = J. Hepatol. | volume = 32 | issue = 5 | pages = 742–7 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10845660 | doi = 10.1016/S0168-8278(00)80242-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lipid A]] may cause uncontrolled activation of mammalian immune systems with production of [[inflammation|inflammatory]] mediators that may lead to [[septic shock]].&lt;ref name="Kilar_et_al" /&gt; This [[inflammation|inflammatory]] reaction is mediated by [[TLR 4|Toll-like receptor 4]] which is responsible for immune system cell activation.&lt;ref name="Kilar_et_al" /&gt; Damage to the [[endothelial]] layer of blood vessels caused by these [[inflammation|inflammatory]] mediators can lead to capillary leak syndrome, dilation of blood vessels and a decrease in cardiac function and can lead to [[septic shock]].&lt;ref name="Stephens_et_al"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Stephens DS, Greenwood B, Brandtzaeg P | title = Epidemic meningitis, meningococcaemia, and Neisseria meningitidis | journal = Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9580 | pages = 2196–210 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17604802 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61016-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pronounced complement activation can also be observed later in the course as the bacteria multiply in the blood.&lt;ref name="Stephens_et_al" /&gt; High bacterial proliferation triggering destructive endothelial damage can also lead to [[disseminated intravascular coagulation]] (DIC) with loss of function of certain internal organs such as the kidneys, [[adrenal gland]]s and lungs due to compromised blood supply. The skin can show the effects of vascular damage often coupled with depletion of coagulation factors in the form of [[petechiae]], [[purpura]] and [[ecchymosis|ecchymoses]]. The limbs can also be affected, sometimes with devastating consequences such as the development of [[gangrene]], requiring subsequent [[amputation]].&lt;ref name="Stephens_et_al" /&gt; Loss of function of the adrenal glands can cause [[adrenal insufficiency]] and additional [[bleeding|hemorrhage]] into the adrenals causes [[Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome]], both of which can be life-threatening.
It has also been reported that [[Neisseria gonorrhoeae|gonococcal]] LOS can cause damage to human [[fallopian tube]]s.&lt;ref name="Yamasaki_et_al" /&gt;

===Auto-immune disease===
The [[molecular mimicry]] of some LOS molecules is thought to cause autoimmune-based host responses, such as flareups of [[multiple sclerosis]].&lt;ref name="Moran_et_al" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chastain_and_Miller"/&gt;  Other examples of bacterial mimicry of host structures via LOS are found with the bacteria ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' and ''[[Campylobacter jejuni]]'', organisms which cause gastrointestinal disease in humans, and ''[[Haemophilus ducreyi]]'' which causes [[chancroid]]. Certain ''C. jejuni'' LPS serotypes (attributed to certain tetra- and pentasaccharide moieties of the core oligosaccharide) have also been implicated with [[Guillain–Barré syndrome]] and a variant of Guillain–Barré called [[Guillain–Barré syndrome#Classification|Miller-Fisher syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Moran_et_al" /&gt;

===Link to obesity===

Bacterial genera associated with endotoxin-related obesity effects: ''[[Escherichia]]'', ''[[Enterobacter]]''

==Laboratory research and biotechnology production systems==

Lipopolysaccharides are frequent contaminants in [[plasmid]] [[DNA]] prepared from bacteria or proteins expressed from bacteria, and ''must'' be removed from the DNA or protein to avoid contaminating experiments and to avoid toxicity of products manufactured using [[industrial fermentation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wicks|first1=Ian P.|last2=Howell|first2=Meredith L.|last3=Hancock|first3=Tuesday|last4=Kohsaka|first4=Hitoshi|last5=Olee|first5=Tsaiwei|last6=Carson|first6=Dennis A.|title=Bacterial Lipopolysaccharide Copurifies with Plasmid DNA: Implications for Animal Models and Human Gene Therapy|journal=Human Gene Therapy|date=March 1995|volume=6|issue=3|pages=317–323|doi=10.1089/hum.1995.6.3-317|pmid=7779915}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, [[ovalbumin]] is frequently contaminated with endotoxins. Ovalbumin is one of the extensively studied proteins in animal models and also an established model allergen for airway hyper-responsiveness (AHR). Commercially available ovalbumin that is contaminated with LPS can fully activate endothelial cells in an in-vitro assay of the first step of inflammation, and it falsifies research results, as it does not accurately reflect the effect of sole protein antigen on animal physiology.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

In pharmaceutical production, it is necessary to remove all traces of endotoxin from drug product containers, as even small amounts of endotoxin will cause illness in humans.  A [[depyrogenation]] oven is used for this purpose.  Temperatures in excess of 300&amp;nbsp;°C are required to break down this substance. A defined endotoxin reduction rate is a correlation between time and temperature. Based on primary packaging material as syringes or vials, a glass temperature of 250&amp;nbsp;°C and a holding time of 30 minutes is typical to achieve a reduction of endotoxin levels by a factor of 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=16 December 2014|title=The Detection of Endotoxins Via the LAL Test, the Chromogenic Method|url=http://www.wakopyrostar.com/blog/post/the-detection-of-endotoxins-via-the-lal-test-the-chromogenic-method/|accessdate=14 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329083636/http://www.wakopyrostar.com/blog/post/the-detection-of-endotoxins-via-the-lal-test-the-chromogenic-method|archivedate=29 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard [[assay]] for detecting presence of endotoxin is the [[Limulus Amebocyte Lysate]] (LAL) assay, utilizing blood from the [[Horseshoe crab]] (''Limulus polyphemus'').&lt;ref name="pmid24019589"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Iwanaga S | title = Biochemical principle of Limulus test for detecting bacterial endotoxins | journal = Proc.

However, due to the dwindling population of horseshoe crabs, and the fact that there are factors that interfere with the LAL assay, efforts have been made to develop alternative assays, with the most promising ones being [[ELISA]] tests using a [[recombinant protein|recombinant]] version of a protein in the LAL assay, Factor C.&lt;ref name="pmid11451451"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ding JL, Ho B | title = A new era in pyrogen testing | journal = Trends Biotechnol. | volume = 19 | issue = 8 | pages = 277–81 | year = 2001 | pmid = 11451451 | doi = 10.1016/s0167-7799(01)01694-8 | url = http://www.horseshoecrab.org/research/sites/default/files/TIBTECH-rFC.pdf | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140102191953/http://www.horseshoecrab.org/research/sites/default/files/TIBTECH-rFC.pdf | archivedate = 2014-01-02 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[chemistry]], '''molybdenum bronze''' is a generic name for certain [[mixed oxide]]s of [[molybdenum]] with the generic formula {{chem|A|''x''|Mo|''y''|O|''z''}} where A may be [[hydrogen]], an [[alkali metal]] cation (such as [[lithium|Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[sodium|Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]], [[potassium|K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]]), and [[thallium|Tl&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]].  These compounds form deeply coloured plate-like crystals with a metallic sheen, hence their name.  These bronzes derive their metallic character partially occupied 4d-bands.&lt;ref name=Onoda/&gt; The oxidation state in K&lt;sub&gt;0.28&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are K&lt;sup&gt;+1&lt;/sup&gt;, O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;, and Mo&lt;sup&gt;+5.72&lt;/sup&gt;.  MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is an insulator, with an unfilled 4d band.

These compounds have been much studied since the 1980s due to their markedly [[anisotropic]] electrical properties, reflecting their layered structure.  The electrical [[resistivity]] can vary considerably depending on the direction, in some cases by 200:1 or more.  They are generally [[non-stoichiometric compound]]s.  Some are metals and some are semiconductors.

==Preparation ==
The first report of a "molybdenum bronze" was by Alfred Stavenhagen and E. Engels in 1895.  They reported that electrolysis of molten {{chem|Na|2|MoO|4}} and {{chem|MoO|3}} gave indigo-blue needles with metallic sheen, which they analysed by weight as {{chem|Na|2|Mo|5|O|7}}.&lt;ref name=Stavenhagen/&gt; The first unambiguous synthesis of alkali molybdenum bronzes was reported only in 1964, by Wold and others.&lt;ref name=Wold/&gt;  They obtained two potassium bronzes, "red" {{chem|K|0.26|MoO|3}} and "blue" {{chem|K|0.28|MoO|3}}, by electrolysis of molten {{chem|K|2|MoO|4}}+{{chem|MoO|3}} at 550 [[celsius|°C]] and 560&amp;nbsp;°C, respectively.  Sodium bronzes were also obtained by the same method. It was observed that at a slightly higher temperature (about 575&amp;nbsp;°C and above) only {{chem|MoO|2}} is obtained.&lt;ref name=Wold/&gt;&lt;ref name=GreenMoTu/&gt;

Another preparation technique involves crystallization from the melt in a temperature gradient.  This report also called attention to the marked anisotropic resistivity of the purple lithium bronze {{chem|Li|0.9|Mo|6|O|17}} and its metal-to-insulator transition at about 24 [[kelvin|K]].&lt;ref name=Greenblatt/&gt;

Hydrogen bronzes {{chem|H|''x''|MoO|3}} were obtained in 1950 by Glemser and Lutz, by ambient-temperature reactions.&lt;ref name=Glemser/&gt; The hydrogen in these compounds can be replaced by alkali metals by treatment with solutions of the corresponding halides.  Reactions are conducted in an [[autoclave]] at about 160&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Chin/&gt;
:[[File:KMoO3Bronze.JPG|thumb|Crystals of K&lt;sub&gt;0.28&lt;/sub&gt;MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, also called "potassium-molybdenum blue bronze".]]

== Classification ==
Molybdenum bronzes are classified in three major families:&lt;ref name=GreenMoTu/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chin/&gt;
* '''Red bronzes''' with limiting composition {{chem|A|0.33|MoO|3}}, that is, {{chem|AMo|3|O|9}}:&lt;ref name=Chin/&gt;
** [[Lithium molybdenum red bronze]] {{chem|Li|0.33|MoO|3}} Reau and others.&lt;ref name=Chin/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tsai/&gt;
** [[Potassium molybdenum red bronze]] {{chem|K|0.26|Mo|1.02|O|3}}&lt;ref name=Wold/&gt; or {{chem|K|0.3|MoO|3}}&lt;ref name=Tsai/&gt;&lt;ref name=WhSchnee/&gt;
** [[Cesium molybdenum red bronze]] {{chem|Cs|0.33|MoO|3}}&lt;ref name=Tsai/&gt;
** [[Potassium molybdenum red bronze]] {{chem|K|0.23|Mo|1.01|O|3}} a semi-conductor.&lt;ref name=Wold/&gt;
* '''Blue bronzes''', with limiting composition {{chem|A|0.30|MoO|3}}, that is, {{chem|A|3|Mo|10|O|30}}.&lt;ref name=Chin/&gt; Their  electronic  properties generally do not depend  on the metal A.&lt;ref name=Onoda/&gt;
** [[Potassium molybdenum blue bronze]] {{chem|K|0.28|Mo|1.02|O|3}}&lt;ref name=Wold/&gt; or {{chem|K|0.3|MoO|3}}&lt;ref name=Tsai/&gt;&lt;ref name=WhSchnee/&gt;
** [[Rubidium molybdenum blue bronze]] {{chem|Rb|0.3|MoO|3}}&lt;ref name=Wold/&gt;&lt;ref name=WhSchnee/&gt;
** [[Thallium molybdenum blue bronze]] {{chem|Tl|0.3|MoO|3}}&lt;ref name=Collins/&gt;
* '''Purple bronzes''', generally with limiting formula {{chem|A|0.9|Mo|6|O|17}}.  Their  electronic depend strongly on the metal A.&lt;ref name=Onoda/&gt;
** [[Lithium molybdenum purple bronze]] {{chem|Li|0.9|Mo|6|O|17}}
** [[Sodium molybdenum purple bronze]] {{chem|Na|0.9|Mo|6|O|17}} 
** [[Potassium molybdenum purple bronze]] {{chem|K|0.9|Mo|6|O|17}}
** [[Rubidium molybdenum purple bronze]] {{chem|Rb|0.9|Mo|6|O|17}}
** [[Thallium molybdenum purple bronze]] {{chem|Cs|0.9|Mo|6|O|17}}&lt;ref name=Wangbo/&gt;

The hydrogen molydbdenum bronzes have similar appearances but different compositions:
* [[Hydrogen molybdenum orthorombic blue bronze]] {{chem|H|''x''|MoO|3}}, 0.23 &amp;lt; x &amp;lt; 0.4 &lt;ref name=Birtill/&gt;
* [[Hydrogen molybdenum monoclinic blue bronze]] {{chem|H|''x''|MoO|3}}, 0.85 &amp;lt; x &amp;lt; 1.4 &lt;ref name=Birtill/&gt;
* [[Hydrogen molybdenum red bronze]] {{chem|H|''x''|MoO|3}}, 1.55 &amp;lt; x &amp;lt; 1.72 &lt;ref name=Birtill/&gt;
* [[Hydrogen molybdenum green bronze]] {{chem|H|2|MoO|3}} or {{chem|MoO|2}}.{{chem|H|2|O}}  &lt;ref name=Glemser/&gt;&lt;ref name=Birtill/&gt;

Other molybdenum bronzes with anomalous electrical properties have been reported, which do not fit in these families.  These include 
* [[Tetragonal]] {{chem|KMo|4|O|6}}&lt;ref name=Ramanuja/&gt;&lt;ref name=Andrade/&gt;
* {{chem|K|''x''|MoO|2−δ}}.&lt;ref name=Alves/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7721">'''Musser Lumber Company''' was a US lumber company, and one of [[Iowa]]'s pioneer lumber concerns. In its day, it was one of the most complete and modern lumber mills on the [[Mississippi River]], employing about 400 men during the working season, and between 200 and 300 men in the logging end of the business.{{sfn|National Lumberman|1916|p=77}}

==History==
The Musser Lumber Company of [[Muscatine, Iowa]], was incorporated in February, 1881, with a capital stock of $200,000. Peter Musser was elected president; Richard Musser, vice-president; P. M. Musser, secretary and treasurer; and C. R. Fox, yard and planing mill superintendent. This company was an outgrowth of the pioneer lumber firm of R. Musser &amp; Company, which was established by Peter and Richard Musser and Edward Hoch in 1855. These gentlemen began by buying rafts of lumber in the river, which they yarded and sold by retail and Wholesale. They also established a lumber yard at Iowa City in 1856, where Peter Musser resided, it being managed by that gentleman until he went to [[California]], in April, 1864. Hoch continued in the firm for three years until 1858, when he retired, and the firm became R. Musser &amp; Company. In 1864, P. M. Musser bought into the business, without any change of firm name; he assumed charge of the [[Iowa City]] yard, which he conducted until 1873, when he and John Porter purchased the interest of R. Musser &amp; Company in the branch yard at Iowa City. They carried on under the firm name of Musser &amp; Porter, with P. M. Musser still retaining his interest in the business in Muscatine. In 1870, having returned from California, Peter Musser joined his brother, Richard, together with C. R. Fox, a former employee, and P. M. Musser, in the organization of the firm of Musser &amp; Company for the purpose of building and operating a saw mill and carrying on the lumber business at Muscatine. In the spring of 1871, they completed their mill at a point on the Mississippi River, since known as [[Musserville]], which was included in the corporate limits of the city of Muscatine, and began the manufacture of lumber. The mill cut about {{convert|11000000|feet}} of lumber a year. In 1873, Richard Musser retired from the business, selling his interest to P. M. Musser, and the firm became P. M. Musser &amp; Company. Three years later, Richard Musser renewed his connection with the company, and the firm name of Musser &amp; Company was again adopted.{{sfn|Hotchkiss|1898|p=617-618}}

In 1877, the company enlarged their mill, putting in improved machinery and increasing its capacity materially. Four years later, the proprietors decided to organize under an act of incorporation, which was done in February, 1881, under the name of the Musser Lumber Company, the incorporators being the original proprietors, R. Musser, P. Musser, P. M. Musser and C. R. Fox of Muscatine, and John Musser of [[Adamstown, Pennsylvania]], and the officers elected being the same as given above. During the same year, the company rebuilt and enlarged the mill, which they fitted with the most modern and improved machinery, making it one of the most complete and capacious saw mills on the Mississippi River, with capacity for manufacturing {{convert|50000000|feet}} of lumber, {{convert|12000000|feet}} of lath and {{convert|12000000|feet}} of shingles for the working season. The power was furnished by two engines, the combined force of which equaled 500 horse-power. In 1882, the company erected a planing mill, detached from the saw mill, which afforded facilities for dressing lumber and the manufacture of flooring, siding and boards. The business of this company was strictly wholesale, and their trade was principally located in the states of [[Iowa]], [[Nebraska]], [[Kansas]], [[Missouri]], [[Colorado]] and Dakota. The number of people employed at their mills and yards was about 300.{{sfn|Hotchkiss|1898|p=617-618}}

The Musser Lumber Company owned large tracts of pine lands along the [[Chippewa River (Wisconsin)|Chippewa]] in [[Wisconsin]] and in the [[Minnesota]] lumber region; their logs were cut by contract and were rafted by the Chippewa Logging Company and the Mississippi River Logging Company, two large lumber corporations, of which the Musser Lumber Company was one of the incorporators,. For about 12 years, this company owned and operated its own rafting steamers, it having operated the “Silver Wave” and “Le Clare Belle" during all that time, and the steamer, “Musser,” for two years. All were sold during the season of 1888 to Capt. S. R. Van Sant. The company’s plant covered an area of thirty-five acres, and the yards were stocked according to the season of the year, in the amount of {{convert|8000000|-|25000000|feet}} of lumber and a proportionate amount of lath and shingles. To convey an idea of the growth of the business from the date of its origin with the firm of Hoeh &amp; Musser, it was reported that the amount of business done the first year was about US$100,000, while the 1898 annual business of the company exceeded $750,000. This corporation had its own system of water-works, which was established in 1872, and in which a Duplex pump and Cameron pump, was used. This company also had one of Barry’s Niagara rotary hydrants, which could throw a three-inch stream a distance of about {{convert|400|feet}} and to a height of {{convert|200|feet}}, and thus the supply of water and force was equal to emergencies which might arise.{{sfn|Hotchkiss|1898|p=617-618}}

The Mussers were also the original incorporators of the Mississippi River Logging Company and Chippewa Lumber and Boom Company; they were also largely interested in the Musser-Sauntry Land, Logging and Manufacturing Company of [[Stillwater, Minnesota]], among the largest pine land owners and logging companies in the world.{{sfn|Hotchkiss|1898|p=618}}

The aggregate cut of the mills at Muscatine was reported in 1875 at 38,000,000 feet, with 21,000,000 shingles; that of 1880 at 55,000,000 feet, with 18,000,000 shingles, while that of 1897 reached 110,000,000 feet of lumber, 30,000,000 shingles and 25,000,000 lath.{{sfn|Hotchkiss|1898|p=618}}

The Musser Lumber Company, one of Iowa's pioneer lumber concerns, closed up its business at Muscatine on November 28, 1916. Following a  meeting of the directors of the lumber concern, it was decided to dissolve the company and formal announcement of the dissolution was made on that date by P. M. Musser, president and treasurer. The officers of the company up to the time of the dissolution were: P. M. Musser, president and treasurer; William Musser, vice-president, and R. Drew Musser, secretary.{{sfn|National Lumberman|1916|p=77}}

The '''nationalization of the Iranian oil industry''' ({{lang-fa|ملی شدن صنعت نفت}}) was a movement in the [[National Consultative Majlis|Iranian parliament (Majlis)]] to nationalize [[Iran]]'s oil industry. The legislation was passed on March 15, 1951 and was verified by the Majlis on March 17, 1951. The legislation led to the nationalization of the [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (AIOC). The movement was led by [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]], a member of the Majlis for the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] and future prime minister of Iran. The movement to nationalize the oil industry was the reaction to the following concessions made by Iran to foreign powers: The [[Reuter concession]] of 1872, proceeding letter,&lt;sup&gt;[[D'Arcy Concession]]?]&lt;/sup&gt; the 1933 agreement between the Iranian government and AIOC, and the Gas-golshaian&lt;sup&gt;[?]&lt;/sup&gt; contract. According to the political scientist [[Mark J. Gasiorowski]], the oil nationalization movement had two major consequences: the establishment of a democratic government and the pursuit of Iranian national sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Fadaee"/&gt;

== Background ==
From the time of the discovery of oil in Iran, foreign powers used force and exploited the weakness of the Iranian state to coerce it into concessions which allowed foreign companies to control oil extraction. The nationalization of the oil industry was the response to these foreign interventions. Particularly the following concessions:

# [[Reuter concession]]
# Proceeding letter&lt;sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[D'Arcy Concession]]?]&lt;/sup&gt;
# 1933 Agreement
# Gas-golshaian&lt;sup&gt;[?]&lt;/sup&gt; contact

The competition to gain more control of the Iranian oil industry increased during [[World War II]] when the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] all became involved in Iranian affairs. When faced with demands from the oil companies of these three countries, the Iranian government announced that the issue would be decided after the war as the economic conditions of the countries were not clear. The government refused all these demands after the war ended.&lt;ref name="ijsr"&gt;{{cite web|last1=GOLSHANI|first1=ALIREZA|last2=JADIDI|first2=ALI|title=COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE IRAN OIL NATIONALIZATION MOVEMENT AND THE NUCLEAR ENERGYWITHIN ROUZCRONCE AND KAPLUN' S THEORY|url=http://www.ijsr.in/upload/2107421897Microsoft%20Word%20-%20paper%2016.pdf|website=ijsr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rahimiyan&lt;sup&gt;[Full Name?]&lt;/sup&gt;, the member from [[Quchan County|Quchan]] in the 14th Majlis was the first who introduced a plan to nationalize the oil industry. However, this plan was never discussed.&lt;ref name="ijsr"/&gt; On October 23, 1949, at home of [[Mohammad Mosaddegh]] and in the presence of twelve experts&lt;sup&gt;[who?]&lt;/sup&gt; the [[National Front (Iran)|National Front]] (political party) was established. It consisted of various political efforts whose joint objective was the protection of the rights of Iranian oil industry.&lt;ref name="ijsr"/&gt;

== Movement ==
{{Main|Mohammad Mosaddegh}}
[[File:Iranian Oil Nationalization Rally.jpg|thumb|People rallies in support of nationalization]]
Mosaddegh (16 June 1882 – 5 March 1967) was an Iranian politician and the leader of the movement to nationalize Iran's oil industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hilsum|first1=Lindsey|title=Patriot of Persia: Muhammad Mossadegh and a Very British Coup by Christopher de Bellaigue – review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/feb/05/patriot-persia-bellaigue-mossadegh-review|website=Theguardian|accessdate=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated in Europe, and joined politics after the [[Persian Constitutional Revolution|Iranian Constitutional Revolution]] of 1905-1907. He held multiple posts such as member of parliament, governor of the [[Fars Province|Fars province]], finance minister, foreign minister, and prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ADST|title=The CIA's Coup Against Iran's Mohammad Mossadegh|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/adst/the-cias-coup-against-ira_b_8001782.html|website=huffingtonpost|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the election of the 14th Majlis in 1943, he was elected member for [[Tehran]]. Before gaining recognition as the leader of the national oil movement, he played a large role in the trans-Iranian railway project and the re-organization of the courts and the Justice Department.&lt;ref name="Fadaee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fadaee|first1=Simin|title=Social Movements in Iran: Environmentalism and Civil Society|date=March 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415693578|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jwwHLeYoorQC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=Oil+Nationalization+Movement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=kIeoXa5hHg&amp;sig=AiM5DJEYjAwnIHX_x-RagA5oxUo&amp;hl=fa&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiojfjAqv7KAhXDSBQKHXHmC-w4ChDoAQgiMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=Oil%20Nationalization%20Movement&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Event ==
{{See also| Anglo-Persian Oil Company }}
The 16th Majlis consisted of some members from National Front such as Mosaddegh. In November 1950, the rejection of the oil supplemental agreement was offered from oil committee of Majlis which was chaired by Mosaddegh. The prime minister at the time, [[Haj Ali Razmara]], opposed the measure. On March 7, 1951, Razmara was murdered by [[Khalil Tahmasebi]], a member of [[Fada'iyan-e Islam]].&lt;ref name="Inc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Inc|first1=Ibp|title=Iran Country Study Guide|date=2015|publisher=International Business Publications|isbn=978-1514513675|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1HORBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=Nationalization+of+Iran%27s+oil+industry&amp;hl=fa&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLo6rhzK7LAhWJUBQKHQgABqYQ6AEISDAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Nationalization%20of%20Iran%27s%20oil%20industry&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of Razmara, the Majlis began the process of nationalizing the Iranian oil industry.&lt;ref name="Fadaee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Vassiliou"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vassiliou|first1=M. S.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Petroleum Industry|date=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0810859937|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bBvz_YxlB-AC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=Nationalization+of+Iran%27s+oil+industry&amp;hl=fa&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLo6rhzK7LAhWJUBQKHQgABqYQ6AEIKDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Nationalization%20of%20Iran's%20oil%20industry&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, 1951, legislation to nationalize the oil industry was passed by the Majlis with a majority of votes. On March 17 the Majlis verified the nationalization of Iran oil industry and the AIOC was nationalized.&lt;ref name="Fadaee"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ijsr" /&gt;

== Aftermath ==
{{see also| 1953 Iranian coup d'état}}
In April, Mosaddegh was selected as prime minister by Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] under immense pressure from the Majlis.&lt;ref name="Inc"/&gt;

In the aftermath of March 1951, the economic crisis worsened and Iranian oil was not bought by other countries. The [[Abadan Refinery]], at the time one of the largest oil refineries in the world, was closed. The nationalization of the Iranian oil industry continued even through strong opposition from the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

In the first year of the nationalization, the only foreign sale of Iranian Oil were 300 barrels to an Italian merchant ship. Foreign oil companies prevented any impacts of the Iranian withdrawal from being felt by consumer countries by increasing output elsewhere. Oil production was expanded by [[BP]] and [[ARAMCO]] in [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Kuwait]] and [[Iraq]]. Oil production in the [[Middle East]] increased by around 10% annually in 1951, 1952 and 1953. The loss of oil exports had bad effect on the Iranian economy. With oil production decreasing from 242 million barrels in 1950 to 10.6 million barrels in 1952.&lt;ref name="McKern"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKern|first1=Bruce|title=Transnational Corporations and the Exploitation of Natural Resources, Volume 10|date=1993|publisher=Routledge; Set Only edition|isbn=978-0415085434|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ieO4zYcOkg8C&amp;pg=PA300&amp;dq=Nationalization+of+Iran%27s+oil+industry&amp;hl=fa&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLo6rhzK7LAhWJUBQKHQgABqYQ6AEIXzAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Nationalization%20of%20Iran's%20oil%20industry&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1953, the government of Mosaddegh was overthrown by a military [[coup detat]] orchestrated by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|United States Central Intelligence Agency]] and the [[Secret Intelligence Service|British Secret Intelligence Service]]. Mosaddegh was sentenced to three years in prison and then kept under house arrest until his death in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;The Modern Middle East:A Political History Since the First World War, University of California Press, 2011-01-03, By Mehran Kamrava, page 148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=The Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica|title=Mohammad Mosaddeq|url=http://www.britannica.com/biography/Mohammad-Mosaddeq|website=Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the coup the Iranian oil crisis ended and the AIOC did not succeed to stop production. The National Iranian oil company as an international consortium was founded and the AIOC was made a member. With the nationalization of the oil industry, British and American political influence continued for years after coup.&lt;ref name="Fadaee" /&gt;

[[File:Polymer-Chip-Capacitors.jpg|thumb|right|Rectangular shaped polymer aluminum (black) and tantalum (brown) electrolytic chip capacitors]]
[[File:Polymer-V-Chip-Capacitors-zylindrisch.jpg|thumb|right| Cylindrical (wound) polymer aluminum electrolytic capacitors]]
A '''polymer capacitor''', or more accurately a '''polymer electrolytic capacitor''', is an [[electrolytic capacitor]] (e-cap) with a solid [[electrolyte]] of a [[conductive polymer]]. There are four different types:
* Polymer [[tantalum capacitor|tantalum electrolytic capacitor]] (Polymer Ta-e-cap)
* Polymer [[aluminum electrolytic capacitor]] (Polymer Al-e-cap)
* Hybrid polymer capacitor (Hybrid polymer Al-e-cap)
* Polymer [[Niobium capacitor|niobium electrolytic capacitors]]

Polymer Ta-e-caps are available in rectangular surface-mounted device ([[Surface-mount technology|SMD]]) chip style. Polymer Al-e-caps and hybrid polymer Al-e-caps are available in rectangular surface-mounted device (SMD) chip style, in cylindrical SMDs (V-chips) style or as radial leaded versions (single-ended).

Polymer electrolytic capacitors are characterized by particularly low internal [[equivalent series resistance]]s (ESR) and high ripple current ratings. Their electrical parameters have similar temperature dependence, reliability and service life compared to solid tantalum capacitors, but have a much better temperature dependence and a considerably longer service life than aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes. In general polymer e-caps have a higher leakage current rating than the other solid or non-solid electrolytic capacitors.

Polymer electrolytic capacitors are also available in a hybrid construction. The hybrid polymer aluminum electrolytic capacitors combine a solid polymer electrolyte with a liquid electrolyte. These types are characterized by low ESR values but have low leakage currents and are insensitive to transient,&lt;ref name="NIC"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=NIC Components Corp. |title=Hybrid Construction, Aluminum Electrolytic Capacitors |url=http://www.niccomp.com/help/presentations/NIC-NSPE-HybridAlumEcap-0910.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; however they have a temperature-dependent service life similar to non-solid e-caps.

Polymer electrolytic capacitors are mainly used in [[Power supply|power supplies]]  of integrated electronic circuits as buffer, bypass and decoupling capacitors, especially in devices with flat or compact design. Thus they compete with [[MLCC capacitor]]s, but offer higher capacitance values than MLCC, and they display no [[Microphonics|microphonic]] effect (such as class 2 and 3 [[ceramic capacitor]]s).

==History==
Aluminum [[electrolytic capacitor#History|electrolytic capacitors]] (Al-e-caps) with liquid [[electrolyte]]s were invented in 1896 by [[Karol Pollak|Charles Pollak]].

[[Tantalum capacitor|Tantalum electrolytic capacitors]] with solid [[manganese dioxide]] (MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) electrolytes were invented by [[Bell Laboratories]] in the early 1950s, as a miniaturized and more reliable low-voltage support capacitor to complement the newly invented [[transistor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=R. L. |last1=Taylor |first2=H. E. |last2=Haring |title=A metal semi-conductor capacitor |journal=J. Electrochem. Soc.|volume= 103 611 |date=November 1956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=D. A. |last1=McLean |first2=F. S. |last2=Power |title=Proc. Inst. Radio Engrs |volume=44 |year=1956 |p=872}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Tantalum capacitor#History|Tantalum capacitor]]. The first Ta-e-caps with MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes had 10 times better [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]] and a higher ripple current load than earlier types Al-e-caps with liquid electrolyte. Additionally, unlike standard Al-e-caps, the [[equivalent series resistance]] (ESR) of Ta-caps is stable in varying temperatures.

[[File:Electrolytes-electric conductivity.jpg|thumb|Conductivities of some electrolytes]]

During the 1970s, the increasing digitization of electronic circuits came with decreasing operating voltages, and increasing switching frequencies and ripple current loads. This had consequences for power supplies and their electrolytic capacitors. Capacitors with lower [[equivalent series resistance|ESR]] and lower [[equivalent series inductance]] (ESL) for bypass and decoupling capacitors used in power supply lines were needed.&lt;ref name="Mosley"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.passivecomponentmagazine.com/capacitor-impedance-needs-for-future-microprocessors |title=Capacitor Impedance Needs For Future Microprocessors |first=Larry E. |last=Mosley |publisher=Intel Corporation CARTS USA |date=2006-04-03|location= Orlando, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[Polymer capacitor#Role of ESR, ESL and capacitance|Role of ESR, ESL and capacitance]].

A breakthrough came in 1973, with the discovery by A. Heeger and F. Wudl&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=F. |last=Wudl |title=From organic metals to superconductors: managing conduction electrons in organic solids |journal=Accounts of Chemical Research |volume=17 |issue=6 |year=1984 |pp= 227–232 |doi=10.1021/ar00102a005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  of an organic conductor, the charge-transfer salt TCNQ. TCNQ ([[7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane]] or N-n-butyl isoquinolinium in combination with TTF ([[Tetrathiafulvalene]])) is a chain molecule of almost perfect one-dimensional structure that has a 10-fold better conductivity along the chains than does MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and has a 100-fold better conductivity than non-solid electrolytes.

[[File:Al-Elkos-OSCON-Wiki-P1040347-07-02-18.jpg|150px|thumb|left|OS-CON capacitors with solid TCNQ electrolyte had a typical lilac insulation sleeve]]

The first Al-e-caps to use the charge transfer salt TTF-TCNQ as a solid organic electrolyte was the OS-CON series offered in 1983 from [[Sanyo]]. These were wound, cylindrical capacitors with 10x increased electrolyte conductivity compared with MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/studium/studienberatung/docs/diplom-vorstellung-gesamt.pdf?1359123049 |last=Kuch |title=Investigation of charge transfer complexes:TCNQ-TTF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.produktinfo.conrad.com/datenblaetter/400000-424999/420946-da-01-en-SMD_OSCON_SVP_4V_330uF.pdf |publisher=Sanyo |year=2007 |title=OS-CON Technical Book Ver. 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These capacitors were used in devices for applications that required the lowest possible ESR or highest possible ripple current. One OS-CON e-cap could replace three more bulky "wet" e-caps or two Ta-caps.&lt;ref name="Part3"&gt;J. Both, "Electrolytic Capacitors from the Postwar Period to the Present", IEEE Electrical Insulation Magazine, Vol.32, Issue:2, pp.8-26, March–April 2016, {{ISSN|0883-7554}}, {{doi|10.1109/MEI.2016.7414227}} [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7414227&amp;filter%3DAND%28p_IS_Number%3A7414222%29]&lt;/ref&gt; By 1995, the Sanyo OS-CON became the preferred decoupling capacitor for Pentium processor-based IBM personal computers.
The Sanyo OS-CON e-cap product line was sold in 2010 to Panasonic. Panasonic then replaced the TCNQ salt with a conducting polymer under the same brand.

The next step in ESR reduction was the development of [[conducting polymer]]s by [[Alan J.

In 1988 the first polymer electrolyte e-cap, "APYCAP" with PPy polymer electrolyte, was launched by the Japanese manufacturer Nitsuko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APYCAP Series, Function Polymer Capacitor |publisher=Nitsuko |year=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The product was not successful, in part because it was not available in SMD versions.

In 1991 Panasonic launched its polymer Al-e-cap series "SP-Cap",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panasonic.com/industrial/electronic-components/parametric-search.aspx?src=/www-ctlg/ctlg/qABE0000_AM.html|title=Electronic Components - Panasonic Industrial Devices|author=|date=|work=panasonic.com|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These e-caps used PPy polymer electrolyte and reached ESR values that were directly comparable to [[Ceramic capacitor|ceramic multilayer capacitors]] (MLCCs). They were still less expensive than tantalum capacitors and with their flat design useful in compact devices such as [[laptop]]s and [[cell phone]]s they competed with tantalum chip capacitors as well.

Tantalum electrolytic capacitors with PPy polymer electrolyte cathode followed three years later. In 1993 [[NEC]] introduced its SMD polymer Ta-e-caps called "NeoCap". In 1997 Sanyo followed with the "POSCAP" polymer tantalum chips.

A new conductive polymer for tantalum polymer capacitors was presented by [[KEMET Corporation|Kemet]] at the "1999 Carts" conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newark.com/pdfs/techarticles/kemet/Replacing-MnO2-with-Conductive-Polymer-in-Tantalum-Capacitors.pdf |first=John |last=Prymak |title=Replacing MnO2 with Polymers, 1999 CARTS}}&lt;/ref&gt; This capacitor used the newly developed organic conductive polymer PEDT ([[Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)]]), also known as [[PEDOT]] (trade name Baytron®).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=F. |last1=Jonas |first2=H.C. |last2=Starck |publisher=Baytron |title=Basic chemical and physical properties, Präsentation 2003 |url=http://www.hcstarck.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later at the 2001 APEC Conference, Kemet introduced PEDOT polymer aluminum e-caps to the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=John |last=Prymak |publisher=Kemet |title=Performance Improvements with Polymer (Ta and Al) |year=2001 |url=http://canada.newark.com/pdfs/techarticles/kemet/Performance-Improvements-with-Polymer-Ta-and-Al.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  PEDOT polymer has a higher temperature stability, and as PEDOT:PSS solution this electrolyte could be inserted only by dipping instead of in-situ polymerization like for PPy which makes the production faster and cheaper.&lt;ref name=Part3 /&gt; Its AO-Cap series included SMD capacitors with stacked anode in "D" size with heights from 1.0 to 4.0&amp;nbsp;mm, in competition to the Panasonic SP-Caps using PPy at that time.

Around the turn of the millennium hybrid polymer capacitors were developed, which have in addition to the solid polymer electrolyte a liquid electrolyte connecting the polymer layers covering the dielectric layer on the anode and the cathode foil.&lt;ref name="NIC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="understanding"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://na.industrial.panasonic.com/blog/understanding-polymer-and-hybrid-capacitors|title=Understanding Polymer &amp; Hybrid Capacitors [Whitepaper] - Panasonic Industrial Devices|author=|date=|work=panasonic.com|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The non-solid electrolyte provide oxygen for self-healing purposes to reduce the leakage current. In 2001, [[NIC Components|NIC]] launched a hybrid polymer e-cap to replace a polymer type at lower price and with lower leakage current. As of 2016 hybrid polymer capacitors are available from multiple manufacturers.

== Application basics ==

===Role of ESR, ESL and capacitance===

The predominant application of all electrolytic capacitors is in [[Power supply|power supplies]]. They are used in input and output smoothing capacitors, as [[decoupling capacitor]]s to circulate the harmonic current in a short loop, as [[bypass capacitor]]s to shunt  [[Alternating current|AC]] [[Noise (electronics)|noise]] to the ground by bypassing the power supply lines, as backup capacitors to mitigate the drop in line voltage during sudden power demand or as [[filter capacitor]] in [[low-pass filter]] to reduce switching noises.&lt;ref name="NCC"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Nippon Chemi-Con |title=Conductive Polymer Aluminum Solid Capacitors, Application Note  Rev. 03 |date=July 2009|url=http://www.chemi-con.co.jp/e/catalog/pdf/Application_Note_NPCAP_090716e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these applications, in addition to the size, are the capacitance, the impedance ''Z'', the ESR, and the inductance ESL important electrical characteristics for the functionality of these capacitors in the circuits.

[[File:Power line voltage drop.jpg|thumb|center|400px|For a sudden power demand of a subsequent circuit, the supply voltage drops by ESL, ESR and capacitance charge loss]]

The change to digital electronic equipment led to the development of switching power supplies with higher frequencies and "on-board" [[Switched-mode power supply|DC/DC converter]], lower supply voltages and higher supply currents. Capacitors for this applications needed lower ESR values, which at that time with Al-e-caps could only be realized with larger case sizes or by replacement with much more expensive solid Ta-caps.

The reason how the ESR influences the functionality of an [[integrated circuit]] is simple. If the circuit, f. e. a [[microprocessor]], has a sudden power demand, the supply voltage drops by ESL, ESR and capacitance charge loss. Because in case of a sudden current demand the voltage of the power line drops:
:Δ''U'' = ESR × ''I''.

For example:&lt;ref name=Mosley /&gt;

Given a supply voltage of 3&amp;nbsp;V, with a tolerance of 10% (300&amp;nbsp;mV) and supply current of a maximum of 10&amp;nbsp;A, a sudden power demand drops the voltage by

: ESR = ''U''/''I'' = (0.3&amp;nbsp;V)/(10&amp;nbsp;A) = 30&amp;nbsp;mΩ.

This means that the ESR in a [[CPU]] power supply must be less than 30&amp;nbsp;mΩ, otherwise the circuit malfunctions.
Similar rules are valid for capacitance and ESL. The specific capacitance could be increased over the years by higher etched anode foils respectively by smaller and finer tantalum powder grains by a factor of 10 to 15 and could follow the trend of miniaturizing. The ESL challenge has led to the stacked foil versions of polymer Al e-caps. However, for lowering the ESR only the development of new, solid conductive materials, first TCNQ, after that the conductive polymers, which led to the development of the polymer electrolyte capacitors with their very low ESR values, the ESR challenge of digitization of electronic circuits could be accepted.

==Electrolytic capacitors - basics==
{{Main|Electrolytic capacitor}}

===Anodic oxidation===
 [[File:Anodic oxidation.jpg|thumb|right|Basic principle of anodic oxidation (forming), in which, by applying a voltage with a current source, an oxide layer is formed on a metallic anode]]

Electrolytic capacitors use a chemical feature of some special metals, earlier called "valve metals", that by [[anodizing|anodic]] [[oxidation]] form an insulating oxide layer. By applying a positive voltage to the anode (+) material in an electrolytic bath an oxide barrier layer with a thickness corresponding to the applied voltage can be formed. This oxide layer acts as the dielectric in an e-cap. To increase the capacitors capacitance the anode surface is roughened and so the oxide layer surface also is roughened.  To complete a capacitor a counter electrode has to match the rough insulating oxide surface. This is accomplished by the electrolyte, which acts as the cathode (-) electrode of an electrolytic capacitor.
The main difference between the polymer capacitors is the anode material and its oxide used as the dielectric:

* Polymer [[tantalum capacitor|tantalum electrolytic capacitors]] use high purity sintered [[tantalum]] powder as an anode with [[tantalum pentoxide]] (Ta&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) as a dielectric and
* Polymer [[aluminum electrolytic capacitor]]s use a high purity and electrochemically etched (roughened) [[aluminum]] foil as an anode with [[aluminum oxide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) as the dielectric

The properties of the aluminum oxide layer compared with tantalum pentoxide dielectric layer are given in the following table:

[[Image:Parallel plate capacitor.svg|thumb|right|A dielectric material is placed between two conducting plates (electrodes), each of area '''''A''''', and with a separation of '''''d'''''.]]
Every e-cap in principle forms a "plate capacitor" whose capacitance is an increasing function of the electrode area A, the permittivity ε of the dielectric material and the thickness of the dielectric (d).
:&lt;math&gt;C = \varepsilon \cdot \frac{A}{d}&lt;/math&gt;
Capacitance is proportional to the product of the area of one plate multiplied by the permittivity and divided by the dielectric thickness.

The dielectric thickness is in the range of [[Meter|nanometers]] per volt. On the other hand, the breakdown voltage of these oxide layers is quite high. Using etched or sintered anodes, with their much higher surface area compared to a smooth surface of the same size or volume, e-caps can achieve a high volumetric capacitance. The latest developments in high etched or sintered anodes increases the capacitance value, depending on the rated voltage, by a factor of up to 200 for Al-e-caps or Ta-e-caps compared with smooth anodes.&lt;ref name=Voltage&gt;{{cite web|first=A. |last=Albertsen |publisher=Jianghai Europe |title=Keep your distance – Voltage Proof of Electrolytic Capacitors |url=http://jianghai-europe.com/wp-content/uploads/3-Jianghai-Europe-E-Cap-Voltage-Proof-AAL-2012-10-30.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KDK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kdk.com/e/productinfo/specifications/c-03-02-03-e.pdf |publisher=KDK |title=Specifications for Etched Foil for Anode, Low Voltage}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Horacek &gt;{{cite web|first1=I. |last1=Horacek |first2=T. |last2=Zednicek |first3=S. |last3=Zednicek |first4=T. |last4=Karnik |first5=J. |last5=Petrzilek |first6=P. |last6=Jacisko |first7=P. |last7=Gregorova |publisher=AVX |title=High CV Tantalum Capacitors - Challenges and Limitations |url=http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/High_CV_Tantalum_Capacitors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Because the forming voltage defines the oxide thickness, the desired voltage tolerance can be easily produced. Therefore, the volume of a capacitor is defined by the product of capacitance and voltage, the so-called "CV product".

Comparing the dielectric constants of tantalum and aluminum oxides, Ta2O5 has permittivity approximately 3-fold higher than Al2O3. Ta-caps therefore theoretically can be smaller than Al-caps with the same capacitance and rated voltage. 
For real tantalum electrolytic capacitors, the oxide layer thicknesses are much thicker than the rated voltage of the capacitor actually requires. This is done for safety reasons to avoid shorts coming from field crystallization. For this reason the real differences of sizes that derive from the different permittivities, are partially ineffective.&lt;ref name="FC-Study"&gt;{{cite web|first1= T. |last1=Zednicek |publisher=AVX |title= A Study of Field Crystallization in Tantalum Capacitors and its effect on DCL and Reliability |url=http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/FieldCrystallization.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrolytes===
The most important electrical property of an [[electrolyte]] in an electrolytic capacitor is its electrical [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductivity]]. The electrolyte forms the counter electrode, of the e-cap, the [[cathode]]. The roughened structures of the [[anode]] surface continue in the structure of the oxide layer, the dielectric, the cathode must adapt precisely to the roughened structure. With a liquid, as in the conventional "wet" e-caps that is easy to achieve. In polymer e-caps in which a solid conductive polymer forms the electrolyte, this is much more difficult to achieve, because its conductivity comes by a chemical process of polymerization. However, the benefits of a solid polymer electrolyte, the significantly lower ESR of the capacitor and the low temperature dependence of the electrical parameters, in many cases justify the additional production steps as well as higher costs.

====Conducting salt TCNQ electrolyte====
 [[File:Tetracyanoquinodimethane Formula V.1.svg|thumb|right|80px| Structural formula of TCNQ]]

Electrolytic capacitors with the charge transfer salt [[tetracyanoquinodimethane]] TCNQ as electrolyte, formerly produced by [[Sanyo]] with the trade name "OS-CON", in the true sense of the term "polymer" were not "polymer capacitors". TCNQ electrolytic capacitors are mentioned here to point out the danger of confusion with 'real' polymer capacitors, which are sold nowadays under the same trade name OS-CON. The original OS-CON capacitors with TCNQ electrolyte sold by the former manufacturer Sanyo has been discontinued  with the integration of Sanyo capacitor businesses by Panasonic 2010.&lt;ref name=Pan&gt;{{cite web |title=Panasonic Announces that it Makes SANYO its Wholly-owned Subsidiary through Share Exchange |url=http://panasonic.net/sanyo/news/2010/12/21-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Panasonic keep the trade name OS-CON but change the TCNQ electrolyte into a conductive polymer electrolyte (PPy).&lt;ref name=OSCON&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panasonic.com/industrial/includes/pdf/OS-CON_NPI_Sheet.pdf|title=Electronic Components - Panasonic Industrial Devices|author=|date=|work=panasonic.com|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrolytic capacitors with TCNQ electrolyte are not available anymore.

====Polymer electrolyte====
Polymers are formed by a [[chemical reaction]], [[polymerization]]. In this reaction monomers are continuously attached to a growing polymer strand.&lt;ref&gt;Young, R. J. (1987) ''Introduction to Polymers'', Chapman &amp; Hall {{ISBN|0-412-22170-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/P04740.html International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry, ''et al.'' (2000) ''IUPAC Gold Book'', '''Polymerization''']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="clayden_organic"&gt;Clayden, J., Greeves, N. and Warren, S. (2000). [https://books.google.com/books?id=kQgu2j_ber0C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Organic chemistry''], Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0198503466}} pp. 1450–1466&lt;/ref&gt; Usually polymers are electrically insulators, at best, semiconductors. For use as an electrolyte in e-caps, electrical [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductive]] polymers are employed. The conductivity of a polymer is obtained by [[Conjugated system|conjugated double bonds]] which permit free movement of [[charge carrier]]s in the [[Doping (semiconductor)|doped state]]. As charge carriers serve [[electron hole]]s. That means, the conductivity of conducting polymers, which is nearly comparable with metallic conductors, only starts when the polymers are doped oxidatively or reductively.

A polymer electrolyte must be able to penetrate the anode's finest pores to form a complete, homogeneous layer, because only anode oxide sections covered by the electrolyte contribute to the capacitance. For this the precursors of the polymer has to consist of very small base materials that can penetrate even the smallest pores. The size of this precursors are the limiting factor in the size of the pores in the etched aluminum anode foils or of the size of tantalum powder. The rate of polymerization must be controlled for capacitor manufacturing. Too rapid polymerization does not lead to a complete anode coverage, while too slow polymerization increases production costs. Neither the precursors nor the polymer or its residues may attack the anodes oxide chemically or mechanically. The polymer electrolyte must have high stability over a wide temperature range over long times. The polymer film is not only the counter electrode of the e-cap it also protects the dielectric even against external influences such as the direct contact of graphite in this capacitors, which are provided with a cathode contact via graphite and silver.

====Polypyrrole PPy ====

[[File:Pyrrole Electro-polymerisation.png|thumb|Pyrrole can be polymerized electrochemically to control the rate of polymerizion.&lt;ref name=RussChemRev /&gt;]]

[[Polypyrrole]] (PPy) is a conducting polymer formed by [[Oxidation|oxidative]] polymerization of [[pyrrole]]. A suitable oxidizing agent is [[iron (III) chloride]] (FeCl3). Water, methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile and other polar solvents may be used for the synthesis of PPy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Machida|first=S.|last2=Miyata|first2=S.|last3=Techagumpuch|first3=A.|date=1989-09-01|title=Chemical synthesis of highly electrically conductive polypyrrole|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0379677989907984|journal=Synthetic Metals|volume=31|issue=3|pages=311–318|doi=10.1016/0379-6779(89)90798-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a solid conducting polymer electrolyte It reaches conductivities up to 100&amp;nbsp;[[Siemens (unit)|S]]/m. Polypyrrole was the first conductive polymer used in polymer Al-e-caps as well as in polymer Ta-e-caps.

The problem with the polymerization of PPy was the rate of polymerization. When pyrrole is mixed with the desired oxidizing agents at room temperature, the polymerization reaction begins immediately. Thus polypyrrole begins to form, before the chemical solution can get into the anode pores. The polymerization rate can be controlled by cryogenic cooling or by electrochemically polymerization.

The cooling method requires a very great technical effort and is unfavorable for mass production. In the electrochemical polymerization at first an auxiliary electrode layer on the dielectric has to be applied and to be connected to the anode.&lt;ref name="PEDOT" /&gt; For this purpose, ionic dopants are added to the basic substances of the polymer, forming a conductive surface layer on the dielectric during the first impregnation. During subsequent impregnation cycles, the in-situ polymerization can be time-controlled by the current flow after applying a voltage between the anode and cathode. With this method a fine and stable polypyrrole film on the dielectric oxide layer of the anode can be realized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Masashi |last=Oshima |publisher=Rubycon |title=Conductive Polymer Aluminum for Electrolytic Capacitor Technology |url=http://www.passivecomponentmagazine.com/conductive-polymer-aluminum-for-electrolytic-capacitor-technology/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, both methods of in situ polymerization are complex and require multiple repetition polymerization steps that increase manufacturing costs.

The polypyrrole electrolyte has two fundamental disadvantages. It is toxic in the production of capacitors and becomes unstable at the higher soldering temperatures required for soldering with lead-free solders.&lt;ref name="PEDOT" /&gt;

PEDOT is polarized by the oxidation of EDOT with catalytic amounts of [[iron (III) sulfate]]. The re-oxidation of iron is given by [[Sodium persulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Rubycon |title=Conductive Polymer Aluminum Solid Electrolytic Capacitors "PZ-CAP" Introduction |url=http://www.rubycon.co.jp/de/products/topics/img/t005_13.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages of PEDOT are [[Transparency and translucency|optical transparency]] in its [[Electrical conduction|conducting]] state, non toxic, stable up to temperatures of 280&amp;nbsp;°C and a conductivity up to 500&amp;nbsp;[[Siemens (unit)|S]]/m.&lt;ref name="PEDOT" /&gt; Its heat resistance allows polymer capacitors to be manufactured that withstand the higher temperatures required for lead-free soldering. Additional this capacitors have better ESR values as polymer e-caps with PPy electrolyte.&lt;ref name="PEDOT" /&gt;

The difficult methods of in situ polymerization of PEDOT in the anodes of the capacitors initially were at first the same as with polypyrrole. This changed with the development of pre-polymerized dispersions of PEDOT in which the capacitor anodes simple could be dipped and then dried at room temperature. For this purpose, the PEDOT chemicals  is added with [[sodium]] [[polystyrene sulfonate]] (PSS) and dissolved in water.&lt;ref name=Merker&gt;U. Merker, K. Reuter, K. Wussow, S. Kirchmeyer, and U.

PEDOT:PSS dispersions are available in different variants. For capacitors with high capacitance values with high-roughened aluminum anode foils or fine-grained tantalum powders, dispersions having very small particle sizes are offered. The average size of these pre-polymerized particles is about 30&amp;nbsp;nm, small enough to penetrate the finest anode capillaries. Another variant of a PEDOT:PSS dispersion has been developed with larger pre-polymerized particles leading to a relatively thick polymer layer in order to make an enveloping protection of the capacitive cell of rectangular Ta and Al polymer capacitors against mechanical and electrical stress.&lt;ref name="PEDOT" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Clevius /&gt;

Hybrid polymer aluminum electrolytic capacitors combine a coating of the roughened and oxidized aluminum anode structure with a conductive polymer together with a liquid electrolyte. The liquid electrolyte is soaked in the separator (spacer) and achieves with its ion conductivity the electrical contact between the both polymer layers covering the dielectric and on the cathode foil. The liquid electrolyte can supply the oxygen for self-healing processes of the capacitor, which reduces the leakage current, so that values such as in conventional "wet" the electrolytic capacitor can be achieved. In addition the safety margin for the required oxide thickness for a desired rated voltage can be reduced.

The detrimental effects of the liquid electrolyte on ESR and temperature characteristics are relatively low. By using appropriate organic electrolytes and a good sealing of the capacitors a long service life can be achieved.&lt;ref name="NIC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=understanding /&gt;

==Types and styles==
Based on the used anode metal and the combination of a polymer electrolyte together with a liquid electrolyte, there are three different types:
*Polymer [[Tantalum capacitor|tantalum electrolytic capacitor]]
*Polymer [[aluminum electrolytic capacitor]]
*Hybrid polymer aluminum electrolytic capacitor

These three different types or families, are produced in two different styles,
* Rectangular SMD chip, usually molded with a plastic case, available with sintered tantalum anode or with stacked aluminum anode foils and 
* Cylindrical style with a wound cell in a metal case, available as cylindrical SMDs (V-chips) style or as radial leaded versions (single-ended)

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Rectangular chip style===

In the early 1990s polymer Ta-caps coincided with the emergence of flat devices such as mobile phones and laptops using SMD assembly technology. The rectangular base surface achieves the maximum mounting space, which is not possible with round base surfaces. The sintered cell can be manufactured so that the finished component has a desired height, typically the height of other components. Typical heights range from about 0.8 to 4&amp;nbsp;mm.

====Polymer tantalum chip capacitors====
Polymer tantalum electrolytic capacitors are essentially [[tantalum capacitor]]s in which the electrolyte is a conductive polymer instead of manganese dioxide, see also [[tantalum capacitor#Materials, production and styles]]
Tantalum capacitors are manufactured from a powder of relatively pure elemental [[tantalum]] metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcstarck.com/tantalum_capacitor_powder|title=Tantalum capacitor powder product information - H.C. Starck|author=|date=|work=hcstarck.com|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=H. |last1=Haas |first2=H. C. |last2=Starck |title=Magnesium Vapour Reduced Tantalum Powders with Very High Capacitances |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/265797735_Magnesium_Vapour_Reduced_Tantalum_Powders_with_Very_High_Capacitances}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AVX-Basic&gt;{{cite web|first=J. |last=Gill |publisher=AVX |title=Basic Tantalum Capacitor Technology |url=http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/3_Basic.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The powder is compressed around a tantalum wire, the anode connection, to form a “pellet”. This pellet/wire combination is subsequently vacuum [[sintering|sintered]] at high temperature (typically 1200 to 1800&amp;nbsp;°C) which produces a mechanically strong anode pellet. During sintering, the powder takes on a sponge-like structure, with all the particles interconnected into a monolithic spatial lattice. This structure is of predictable mechanical strength and density, but is also highly porous, producing a large anode surface area.

The [[dielectric]] layer is then formed over all the tantalum particle surfaces of the anode by the electrochemical process of [[anodizing|anodization]] or forming. To achieve this, the “pellet” is submerged into a very weak solution of acid and DC voltage is applied. The total dielectric thickness is determined by the final voltage applied during the forming process. Thereafter, the oxidized sintered block is impregnated with the precursors of the polymer, to achieve the polymer electrolyte, the counter electrode. This polymerized pellet now is successively dipped into conducting [[graphite]] and then [[silver]] to provide a good connection to the conducting polymer. This layers achieves the cathode connection of the capacitor. The capacitive cell then is generally molded by a synthetic resin.

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Polymer tantalum electrolytic capacitors have ESR values that are approximately only 1/10 of the value of tantalum electrolytic capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte of the same size. By a multi-anode technique in which several anode blocks are connected in parallel in one case, the ESR value can be reduced again. The advantage of the multi-anode technology in addition to the very low ESR values is the lower inductance ESL, whereby the capacitors are suitable for higher frequencies.

The disadvantage of all polymer tantalum capacitors is the higher leakage current, which is approximately by a factor of 10 higher compared to the capacitors with manganese dioxide electrolyte. Polymer SMD Tantalum Electrolytic Capacitors are available up to a size of 7.3x4.3x4.3&amp;nbsp;mm (length × width × height) with a capacity of 1000&amp;nbsp;µF at 2.5&amp;nbsp;V. They cover temperature ranges from −55&amp;nbsp;°C to +125&amp;nbsp;°C and are available in rated voltage values from 2.5 to 63&amp;nbsp;V.

====New designs – lowering ESR and ESL====
[[File:Multi-Anoden-Konstruktion.jpg|thumb|right|The multi-anode construction has several sintered tantalum anodes which are connected in parallel, whereby both ESR and ESL will be reduced.]]
Lowering ESR and ESL remains a major research and development objective for all polymer capacitors. Some constructive measures can have also a major impact on the electrical parameters of capacitors. Smaller ESR values can be achieved for example by parallel connection of several conventional capacitor cells in one case. Three parallel capacitors with an ESR of 60&amp;nbsp;mΩ each have a resulting ESR of 20&amp;nbsp;mΩ. This technology is called “multi-anode” construction and will be used at polymer tantalum capacitors.&lt;ref name="Multianode"&gt;{{cite web|authors=Reed/Marshall |publisher=Kemet |title=Stable, Low-ESR Tantalum Capacitors |year=2000  |url=https://www.newark.com/pdfs/techarticles/kemet/Stable-Low-ESR-Tantalum-Capacitors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LowProf"&gt;{{cite web|first1=T. |last1=Zedníček |first2=L. |last2=Marek |first3=S. |last3=Zedníček |publisher=AVX |title=New Low Profile Low ESL Multi-Anode "Mirror" Tantalum Capacitor |url=http://www.interstatemarketing.com/Papers/TechArticles/Tant-Niobium/newlowpro.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this construction up to six individual anodes in one case are connected. This design is offered as polymer tantalum chip capacitors as well as lower expensive tantalum chip capacitors with MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte. Multi-anode polymer tantalum capacitors have ESR values on the single-digit milliohm range.

One another simple constructive measure changes the parasitic inductance of the capacitor, the ESL. Since the length of the leads inside the capacitor case has a large amount of the total ESL the inductance of the capacitor can be reduced by reducing the length of the internal leads by asymmetric sintering of the anode lead. This technique is called “face-down” construction. Due to the lower ESL of this face-down construction the resonance of the capacitor is shifted to higher frequencies, which take into account the faster load changes of digital circuits with ever-higher switching frequencies.&lt;ref name="facedown"&gt;{{cite web |first1=E. |last1=Chen |first2=K. |last2=Lai |first3=J. |last3=Prymak |first4=M. |last4=Prevallet |publisher=Kemet |title=Facedown Termination for Higher C/V – Lower ESL Conductive-Polymer SMT Capacitors CARTS Asia |date=October 2005 |url=http://www.kemet.com/Lists/TechnicalArticles/Attachments/170/2005%20CARTS%20Asia%20KEMET%20Facedown%20Termination.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ta-face down design.jpg|thumb|center|400px|In the "face-down" construction of tantalum chip capacitors, the internal current path is constructively reduced, which reduce the parasitic impedance (ESL) with the result, that the resonance shifts to higher frequencies. Simply said, the capacitor gets "faster"]].

Polymer tantalum chip capacitors with these new design enhancements, that both the ESR and the ESL decreased reaching properties, approaching ever closer to those of MLCC capacitors.

====Polymer aluminum chip capacitors====
Rectangular polymer Al-caps have one or more layered aluminum anode foils and a conductive polymer electrolyte. The layered anode foils are at one side contacted with each other, this block is anodically oxidized to achieve the dielectric, and the block is impregnated with the precursors of the polymer to achieve the polymer electrolyte, the counter electrode. Like for polymer tantalum capacitors this polymerized block now is successively dipped into conducting [[graphite]] and then [[silver]] to provide a good connection to the conducting polymer. This layers achieves the cathode connection of the capacitor. The capacitive cell then generally is molded by a synthetic resin.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;gallery perrow="3" caption="Basic construction of a polymer aluminum capacitor with layered anode stripes" mode="packed" heights="120px"&gt;

File:Polymer-Aluminium-Quader.jpg |Rectangular polymer aluminum chip capacitor. The external appearance has no indication of the used internally anode material.
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;
The layered anode foils in the rectangular shaped polymer Al-chip-e-caps are electrically parallel connected single capacitors. Thus, the ESR and ESL values are connected in parallel reducing ESR and ESL correspondingly, and allowing them to operate at higher frequencies.

These rectangular polymer Al-chip-e-caps are available in the "D"-case with 7,3x4,3&amp;nbsp;mm and heights of round 2...4&amp;nbsp;mm. They provide a competitive alternative to Ta-caps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Pansonic |title=Al-Polymer-e-caps, series TPC, 330&amp;nbsp;µF, 6,3&amp;nbsp;V, 7,3x4,3x1,9&amp;nbsp;mm, ESR=40&amp;nbsp;mΩ, rippel current=1900&amp;nbsp;mA is comparable with Kemet, Ta-Polymer-e-cap, series T545, 330&amp;nbsp;µF, 6,3&amp;nbsp;V, 7,3x4,3x2,0&amp;nbsp;mm, ESR=45&amp;nbsp;mΩ, rippel current=2000&amp;nbsp;mA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparing mechanical comparable polymer Al-chip-e-caps and polymer Ta-chip-e-caps shows that the different permittivities of aluminum oxide and tantalum pentoxide have little impact on the specific capacity due to different safety margins in oxide layers. Polymer Ta-e-caps use an oxide layer thickness that corresponds to approximately four times the rated voltage, while the polymer Al-e-caps have about twice the rated voltage.

===Cylindrical (radial) style===
Cylindrical polymer aluminum capacitors based on the technique of wound aluminum electrolytic capacitors with liquid electrolytes. They are available only with aluminum as anode material.

They are intended for larger capacitance values compared to rectangular polymer capacitors. Due to their design, they may vary in height on a given surface mounting area so that larger capacitance values can be achieved by a taller case without increasing the mounting surface. This is primarily useful for [[printed circuit boards]] without a height limit.

====Cylindrical polymer aluminum capacitors====
Cylindrical polymer Al-e-caps are made of two aluminum foils, an etched and formed anode and a cathode foil that are mechanically separated by a separator and wound together. The winding is impregnated with the polymer precursors to achieve the polymerized conducting polymer to form cathode the polymer electrode, electrically connected to the cathode foil. The winding then is built into an aluminum case and sealed with a rubber sealing. For the SMD version (Vertical chip= V-chip) the case is provided with a bottom plate.

&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The cylindrical polymer Al-e-caps are less expensive than corresponding polymer tantalum capacitors for a given CV value  (capacitance × rated voltage). They are available up to a size of 10×13&amp;nbsp;mm (diameter × height) with a CV value of 3900&amp;nbsp;µF/2.5&amp;nbsp;V&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Nichicon |title=Series PLG, 3900&amp;nbsp;µF/2,5&amp;nbsp;V, 10x12,7&amp;nbsp;mm, ESR=8&amp;nbsp;mΩ, ripple current=7&amp;nbsp;A (105&amp;nbsp;°C, 100&amp;nbsp;kHz) |url=http://www.nichicon-us.com/english/products/solid/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can cover temperature ranges from -55&amp;nbsp;°C to +125&amp;nbsp;°C and are available in nominal voltage values from 2.5 to 200&amp;nbsp;V&lt;ref name="200V" /&gt; respectively 250&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref name=Beryl /&gt;

Unlike "wet" Al-e-caps, the cases of polymer Al capacitors do not have a vent (notch) in the bottom of the case, since a short circuit does not form gas, which would increase pressure in the case. Therefore, a predetermined breaking point is not required.

====Hybrid polymer aluminum capacitors====
[[File:E-cap-construction-principle-3-hybrid-polymer.png|thumb|Cross-sectional view of the capacitive cell of a hybrid polymer aluminum capacitor, polymer electrolyte in the pores of the aluminum foils and liquid electrolyte as the electrical connection between the polymer layers.]]

Hybrid polymer capacitors are available only in the cylindrical style construction thus corresponds to the above-described cylindrical polymer Al-e-caps leaded in the radial (single-ended) design or with a base plate in the SMD version (V-chip). The difference is that the polymer only covers the surface of the roughened structure of the dielectric Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the surface of the cathode foil as thin layers. With this especially the high-ohmic parts in the small pores of the anode foil can be made low-ohmic to reduce the capacitors ESR. As electrical connection between both polymer layers serve a liquid electrolyte like in conventional wet Al-e-caps impregnating the separator. The small distance the non-solid electrolyte conduct increases the ESR a little bit, however in fact not dramatically.  Advantage of this construction is that the liquid electrolyte in operation delivers the oxygen which is necessary for self-healing of the dielectric layer in the presence of any small defects.

The current that flows through a small defect results in selective heating, which normally destroys the overlying polymer film, isolating, but not healing, the defect. In hybrid polymer capacitors liquid can flow to the defect, delivering oxygen and healing the dielectric by generating new oxides, decreasing the leakage current. Hybrid polymer Al-e-caps have a much lower leakage current than standard polymer Al-e-caps.

==Comparison of the polymer families==

===Comparison of benchmarks===

===Comparison of electrical parameters===
Electrical properties of polymer capacitors can best be compared, using consistent capacitance, rated voltage and dimensions. The values for the ESR and the ripple current are the most important parameters for the use of for polymer capacitors in electronic equipment. The leakage current is significant, because it is higher than that of e-caps with non-polymer electrolytes. The respective values of Ta-e-caps with MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte and wet Al-e-caps are included.

==Electrical characteristics==

=== Series-equivalent circuit ===
[[File:Electrolytic capacitor model.svg|thumb|Series-equivalent circuit model of an electrolytic capacitor]]

The electrical characteristics of capacitors are harmonized by the international generic specification IEC 60384-1. In this standard, the electrical characteristics of capacitors are described by an idealized series-equivalent circuit with electrical components which model all ohmic losses, capacitive and inductive parameters of electrolytic capacitors:

* ''C'', the capacitance of the capacitor
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;ESR&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series resistance]] which summarizes all ohmic losses of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESR"
* ''L''&lt;sub&gt;ESL&lt;/sub&gt;, the [[equivalent series inductance]] which is the effective self-inductance of the capacitor, usually abbreviated as "ESL".
* ''R''&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt;, the resistance representing the [[Leakage (electronics)|leakage current]] of the capacitor

===Rated capacitance, standard values and tolerances===
 [[File:E-cap-capacitance versus temperature.jpg|thumb|Typical capacitance capacitor as a function of temperature for a polymer Al-e-cap and two non-solid Al-e-caps]]

The capacitance value of polymer electrolytic capacitors depends on measuring frequency and temperature. Electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolytes show a broader aberration over frequency and temperature ranges than polymer capacitors.

The standardized measuring condition for polymer Al-e-caps is an AC measuring method with 0.5&amp;nbsp;V at a frequency of 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz and a temperature of 20&amp;nbsp;°C. For polymer Ta-e-caps a DC bias voltage of 1.1 to 1.5&amp;nbsp; V for types with a rated voltage ≤2.5&amp;nbsp;V, or 2.1 to 2.5&amp;nbsp;V for types with a rated voltage of &gt;2.5&amp;nbsp;V, may be applied during the measurement to avoid reverse voltage.

The capacitance value measured at the frequency of 1&amp;nbsp;kHz is about 10% less than the 100/120&amp;nbsp;Hz value. Therefore, the capacitance values of polymer e-caps are not directly comparable and differ from those of [[film capacitor]]s or [[ceramic capacitor]]s, whose capacitance is measured at 1&amp;nbsp;kHz or higher.

The basic unit of a polymer electrolytic capacitor's capacitance is the [[Farad|microfarad]] (μF). The capacitance value specified in manufacturers data sheets is called the rated capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; or nominal capacitance C&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is given according to IEC 60063 in values corresponding to the [[E-series of preferred numbers|E series]]. These values are specified with a capacitance tolerance in accordance with IEC 60062 preventing overlaps.

The actual measured capacitance value must be within the tolerance limits.

===Rated and category voltage===
[[File:Rated-Category.png|thumb|right|Relation between rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and category voltage U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;  and rated temperature T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and category temperature T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;]]

Referring to IEC 60384-1, the allowed operating voltage for polymer e-caps is called the "rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;". The rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously at any temperature within the rated temperature range T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;.

The voltage proof of electrolytic capacitors decreases with increasing temperature. For some applications it is important to use a higher temperature range. Lowering the voltage applied at a higher temperature maintains safety margins. For some capacitor types therefore the IEC standard specifies a "temperature derated voltage" for a higher temperature, the "category voltage U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;". The category voltage is the maximum DC voltage or peak pulse voltage that may be applied continuously to a capacitor at any temperature within the category temperature range T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;. The relation between both voltages and temperatures is given in the picture at right.

Applying a higher voltage than specified may destroy electrolytic capacitors.

Applying a lower voltage may have a positive influence on polymer electrolytic capacitors. For hybrid polymer Al-e-caps a lower applied voltage in some cases can extend the lifetime.&lt;ref name=Voltage /&gt; For polymer Ta-e-caps lowering the voltage applied increases the reliability and reduces the expected failure rate.&lt;ref name="AVX-Reliability"&gt;{{cite web |first=Ch. |last=Reynolds |publisher=AVX |title= Technical Information, Reliability Management of Tantalum Capacitors |url=http://www.mouser.com/pdfDocs/AVX_rmtant.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rated and category temperature===
The relation between rated temperature T&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and rated voltage U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; as well as higher category temperature T&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; and derated category voltage U&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is given in the picture at right.

===Surge Voltage ===

Polymer e-cap oxide layers are formed for safety reasons at a higher voltage than the rated voltage, called a surge voltage. Therefore, it is allowed to apply a surge voltage for short times and a limited number of cycles.

The surge voltage indicates the maximum peak voltage value that may be applied during their application for a limited number of cycles.&lt;ref name=Voltage /&gt; The surge voltage is standardized in IEC 60384-1.

For polymer Al-e-caps the surge voltage is 1.15 times the rated voltage. For polymer Ta-e-caps the surge voltage can be 1.3 times the rated voltage, rounded off to the nearest volt.&lt;ref name=AVX-Basic /&gt;

The surge voltage applied to polymer capacitors may influence the capacitor's failure rate.&lt;ref name=surge&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyocera.co.jp/prdct/electro/pdf/technical/surgtant.pdf |first=J. |last=Gill |publisher=AVX |title= Surge in Solid Tantalum Capacitors}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Teverovsky&gt;{{cite web |first=A. |last=Teverovsky |series=Perot Systems Code 562 |publisher=NASA GSFCE |title=Effect of Surge Current Testing on Reliability of Solid Tantalum Capacitors |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080039306.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web |first1=D. |last1=Liu |first2=M.

===Transient Voltage===

[[Transient (oscillation)|Transients]] are fast and high [[voltage spike]]s. Polymer electrolytic capacitors, aluminum as well as tantalum polymer capacitors can not withstand transients or peak voltages higher than surge voltage. Transients for this type of e-caps may destroy the components.&lt;ref name=AVX-Basic /&gt;&lt;ref name=surge /&gt;&lt;ref name=Teverovsky /&gt;

Hybrid polymer Al-e-caps are relatively insensitive to high and short- term transient voltages higher than surge voltage, if the frequency and the energy content of the transients are low.&lt;ref name="NIC" /&gt;&lt;ref name="understanding" /&gt; This ability depends on rated voltage and component size. Low energy transient voltages lead to a voltage limitation similar to a [[zener diode]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Imam |first=A.M. |title=Condition Monitoring of Electrolytic Capacitors for Power Electronics Applications, Dissertation |publisher=Georgia Institute of Technology |year=2007 |url=https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/14472/imam_afroz_m_200705_phd.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An unambiguous and general specification of tolerable transients or peak voltages is not possible. In every case transients arise, the application must be individually assessed.

===Reverse voltage===

Polymer electrolytic capacitors, tantalum as well as aluminum polymer capacitors are polarized capacitors and generally requires the anode electrode voltage to be positive relative to the cathode voltage. Nevertheless, they can withstand for short instants a type dependent reverse voltage for a limited number of cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=I. |last1=Bishop |first2=J. |last2=Gill |publisher=AVX Ltd. |title=Reverse Voltage Behavior of Solid Tantalum Capacitors |url=http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/17_Reverse.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=P. |last1=Vasina|first2= T. |last2=Zednicek|first3= Z. |last3=Sita |first4=J. |last4=Sikula |first5=J. |last5=Pavelka |publisher=AVX |title=Thermal and Electrical Breakdown Versus Reliability of Ta2O5 Under Both – Bipolar Biasing Conditions |url=http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/Tantalum-NiobiumCapacitors/thermele.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reverse voltage higher than the type-dependent threshold level applied for a long time to the polymer electrolyte capacitor leads to short-circuit and to destruction of the capacitor.

To minimize the likelihood of a polarized electrolytic being incorrectly inserted into a circuit, polarity has to be very clearly indicated on the case, see the section on "Polarity marking" below.

===Impedance and ESR===
See also: [[Electrolytic capacitor#Impedance]] and [[Electrolytic capacitor#ESR and dissipation factor tan δ]]

The [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] is the [[Complex number|complex]] [[ratio]] of the voltage to the current in an [[Alternating current|AC]] [[Electronic circuit|circuit]], and expresses as [[Electrical resistance|AC resistance]] both magnitude and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] at a particular frequency. In the data sheets of polymer electrolyte capacitors only the impedance magnitude ''|Z|'' is specified, and simply written as ''"Z"''. Regarding the IEC 60384-1 standard, the impedance values of polymer electrolytic capacitors are measured and specified at 100&amp;nbsp;kHz.

In the special case of [[resonance]], in which the both reactive resistances ''X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' have the same value (''X&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;=X&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;''), the impedance will be determined by only [[equivalent series resistance]] ''ESR'', which summarizes all resistive losses of the capacitor. At 100&amp;nbsp;kHz the impedance and the ESR have nearly the same value for polymer e-caps with capacitance values in the µF range. With frequencies above the resonance the impedance increases again due to ''ESL'' of the capacitor, turning the capacitor into an inductor.

[[File:Polymer-caps-Impedance-ESR-comparization.jpg|thumb|center|400px|Typical impedance characteristics over the frequency for 100&amp;nbsp;µF e-caps with different electrolytes compared with a 100&amp;nbsp;µF class-2 MLCC [[ceramic capacitor]].]]
[[File:Polymer-ESR-Elko-Kurven.svg|thumb|Typical curve of the &lt;math&gt;ESR&lt;/math&gt; as a function of temperature &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; for polymer capacitors ({{legend2|#ff0000}}) and "wet" Al-e-caps ({{legend2|#32cd32}})]]

Impedance and ESR, as shown in the curves, as shown in the curves, heavily depend on the used electrolyte. The curves show the progressively lower impedance and ESR values of "wet" Al-e-caps and  MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Ta-e-caps, Al/TCNQ and tantalum polymer e-caps. The curve of a ceramic Class 2 MLCC capacitor, with still lower Z and ESR values is also shown, but whose capacitance is voltage-dependent.

An advantage of the polymer e-caps over non-solid Al-e-caps is low temperature dependence and almost linear curve of the ESR over the specified temperature range. This applies both to polymer tantalum, polymer aluminum, as well as for hybrid polymer aluminum e-caps.

Impedance and ESR are also dependent on design and materials of the capacitors. Cylindrical Al-e-caps with the same capacitance as rectangular Al-e-caps have higher inductance than rectangular Al-e-caps with layered electrodes and therefore they have a lower resonant frequency.  This effect is amplified by multi-anode construction, in which individual inductances are reduced by their parallel connection&lt;ref name="Multianode" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LowProf" /&gt; and the "face-down" technique.&lt;ref name="facedown" /&gt;

===Ripple current===
[[File:rippelstrom_mit_Schaltplan.png|thumb|250px|The superimposed (DC biased) AC ripple current flow across the smoothing capacitor C1 of a power supply causes internal heat generation corresponding to the capacitor's ''ESR''.]]

A "ripple current" is the [[root mean square]] (RMS) value of a superimposed AC current of any frequency and any waveform of the current curve for continuous operation within the specified temperature range. It arises mainly in power supplies (including [[Switched-mode power supply|switched-mode power supplies]]) after rectifying an AC voltage and flows as charge and discharge current through the decoupling or smoothing capacitor.&lt;ref name="NCC" /&gt;

Ripple currents generates heat inside the capacitor body. This dissipation power loss ''P&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;'' is caused by ''ESR'' and is the squared value of the effective (RMS) ripple current ''I&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''.

: &lt;math&gt;P_{L} = I_R^2 \cdot ESR&lt;/math&gt;

This internally generated heat, additional to the ambient temperature and other external heat sources, leads to a higher capacitor body temperature with a temperature difference of ''Δ T'' against the ambient. This heat has to be distributed as thermal losses ''P&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;'' over the capacitor's surface ''A'' and the thermal resistance ''β'' to the ambient.

: &lt;math&gt; P_{th} = \Delta T \cdot A \cdot \beta&lt;/math&gt;

This heat is distributed to the ambient by [[thermal radiation]], [[convection]], and [[thermal conduction]]. The temperature of the capacitor, which is the net balance between heat produced and distributed, must not exceed the capacitor's maximum specified temperature.

The ripple current for polymer e-caps is specified as a maximum effective (RMS) value at 100&amp;nbsp;kHz at upper rated temperature. Non-sinusoidal ripple currents have to be analyzed and separated into their individual single frequencies by means of [[Fourier analysis]] and summarized by squared addition to calculate a RMS value.&lt;ref name=VishayIAC&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Vishay BCcomponents |title=Introduction Aluminum Capacitors, Revision: 10-Sep-13 1 Document Number: 28356 |url=http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126094004/http://www.vishay.com/docs/28356/alucapsintroduction.pdf |archivedate=2016-01-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_R=\sqrt{{i_1}^2 + {i_2}^2  +  {i_3}^2 + {i_n}^2 }&lt;/math&gt;

Typically, the ripple current value is calculated for a core temperature rise of 2 to 6&amp;nbsp;°C against ambient, depending on type and manufacturer.&lt;ref&gt;Ripple Current Confusion, Edward Chen, Mike Prevallet, John Prymak, KEMET Electronics Corp [http://www.kemet.com/Lists/TechnicalArticles/Attachments/161/2004%20Article%20-%20Ripple%20Current%20Confusion.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The ripple current can be increased at lower temperatures. Because ESR is frequency dependent and rises in low-frequency range, the ripple current must be reduced at lower frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;Nippon-Chemi-Con, Lifetime Estimation of Conductive Polymer Aluminum Solid Capacitors [http://www.chemi-con.co.jp/e/catalog/pdf/al-e/al-sepa-e/001-guide/al-lifetimecp-e-160401.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

In polymer Ta-e-caps the heat generated by the ripple current influences the reliability of the capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=I. |last=Salisbury |publisher=AVX |title=Thermal Management of Surface Mounted Tantalum Capacitors |url=http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/19_Thermal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://escies.org/download/webDocumentFile?id=62190|first=R.W. |last=Franklin |publisher=AVX |title=Ripple Rating of Tantalum Chip Capacitors}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Vishay |title=Application Notes, AC Ripple Current, Calculations Solid Tantalum Capacitors |url=http://www.vishay.com/docs/40031/apprippl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newark.com/pdfs/techarticles/kemet/Ripple-Current-Capabilities-Technical-Update.pdf |publisher=KEMET |title=Ripple Current Capabilities, Technical Update |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exceeding the limit can result in catastrophic failures with short circuits and burning components.

The heat generated by the ripple current also influences the lifetime of aluminum and tantalum electrolytic capacitors with solid polymer electrolytes.&lt;ref name="NCC" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Vitoratos&gt;{{cite journal|first1=E. |last1=Vitoratos |first2=S. |last2=Sakkopoulos |first3=E. |last3=Dalas |first4=N. |last4=Paliatsas |first5=D. |last5=Karageorgopoulos |first6=F. |last6=Petraki |first7=S. |last7=Kennou |first8=S.A. |last8=Choulis |title=Thermal degradation mechanisms of PEDOT:PSS |journal=Organic Electronics |volume=10 |issue=1 |date=February 2009 |pp= 61–66 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1566119908001791 |doi=10.1016/j.orgel.2008.10.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ripple current heat affects the lifetimes of all three polymer e-cap types.&lt;ref name="NCC" /&gt;

===Current surge, peak or pulse current===
Polymer tantalum electrolytic capacitors are sensitive to peak or pulse currents.&lt;ref name=surge /&gt;&lt;ref name=Teverovsky /&gt; Polymer Ta-e-caps which are exposed to surge, peak or pulse currents, for example, in highly inductive circuits, require a voltage derating. If possible the voltage profile should be a ramp turn-on, as this reduces the peak current experienced by the capacitor.

Hybrid polymer Al-e-caps have no restrictions on current surge, peak or pulse currents. However, the summarized currents must not exceed the specified ripple current.

===Leakage current===
[[File:Leakage current curves.svg|thumb|right|general leakage behavior of electrolytic capacitors: leakage current &lt;math&gt;I_{leak}&lt;/math&gt; as a function of time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; depending of the kind of electrolyte
{{legend|#ff0000|non solid, high water conent}}
{{legend|#2330ff|non solid, organic}}
{{legend|#2cbc32|solid, polymer}}
]]

The [[Leakage (electronics)|DC leakage current]] (DCL) is a unique characteristic for electrolytic capacitors other conventional capacitors do not have. It is the [[direct current|DC]] current that flows when a DC voltage of correct polarity is applied. This current is represented by the resistor ''R&lt;sub&gt;leak&lt;/sub&gt;'' in parallel with the capacitor in the series-equivalent circuit of e-caps. The main causes of DCL for solid polymer capacitors are f. e. points of electrical dielectric breakdown after soldering, unwanted conductive paths due to impurities or due to poor anodization, and for rectangular types bypassing of dielectric due to excess MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, due to moisture paths or cathode conductors (carbon, silver).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interstatemarketing.com/Papers/TechArticles/Tant-Niobium/leakage.pdf |first=R.W. |last=Franklin |publisher=AVX |title=An Exploration of Leakage Current}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Datasheet leakage current specification is given by multiplication of the rated capacitance value ''C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' with the value of the rated voltage ''U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' together with an added figure, measured after 2 or 5 minutes, for example a formula for non-solid Al-e-caps:

:&lt;math&gt;I_\mathrm{Leak} = 0{.}01\,\mathrm{{A}\over{ V \cdot F}} \cdot U_\mathrm R \cdot C_\mathrm R + 3\,\mathrm{\mu A}&lt;/math&gt;

Leakage current in solid polymer e-caps generally drops very fast but then remain on the reached level. The value depends on the voltage applied, temperature, measuring time and influence of moisture caused by case sealing conditions.

Polymer e-caps have relatively high leakage current values. This leakage current cannot be reduced by "healing" in the sense of generating new oxide, because under normal conditions polymer electrolytes cannot deliver oxygen for forming processes. Annealing of defects in the dielectric layer only can be carried out through local overheating and polymer evaporation. 
The leakage current values for polymer electrolyte capacitors are between ''0.2&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' to  ''0.04&amp;nbsp;C&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'', depending on the manufacturer and series. Thus the value of the leakage current for polymer capacitors is higher than for "wet" Al-e-caps and MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Ta-e-caps.

This higher leakage of current disadvantage of solid polymer Al-e-caps is avoided by hybrid Al-e-caps. Their liquid electrolyte provides the oxygen that is necessary for the reforming of oxide defects, so that the hybrids achieve the same values as wet Al-e-caps.&lt;ref name="understanding" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NCC" /&gt;

===Dielectric absorption (soakage)===
{{main|Dielectric absorption}}

Dielectric absorption occurs when a capacitor that has remained charged for a long time discharges only incompletely when briefly discharged. Although an ideal capacitor would reach zero volts after discharge, real capacitors develop a small voltage from time-delayed dipole discharging, a phenomenon that is also called [[dielectric relaxation]], "soakage" or "battery action".

For polymer tantalum as well as aluminum electrolytic capacitors no figures for dielectric absorption are available.

==Reliability and lifetime==

===Reliability (failure rate)===
{{Main|Reliability engineering}}
[[File:Elko-Badewannenkurve-english.png|thumb|right|250px| [[Bathtub curve]] with times of "early failures", "random failures", and "wear-out failures". The time of random failures is the time of constant failure rate]]

The [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] of a component is a property that indicates how reliably this component performs its function in a time interval. It is subject to a [[stochastic process]] and can be described qualitatively and quantitatively, but is not directly measurable. The reliability of electrolytic capacitors is empirically determined by identifying the [[failure rate]] in production accompanying [[endurance test]]s. Reliability normally is shown as a [[bathtub curve]] and is divided into three areas: early failures or infant mortality failures, constant random failures and wear out failures. Failures totalized in a failure rate are short circuit, open circuit, and degradation failures (exceeding electrical parameters). For polymer Ta-e-caps the failure rate is also influenced by the circuit series resistor, which is not required for polymer Al-e-caps.

Billions of test unit-hours are needed to verify failure rates in the very low level range which are required today to ensure the production of large quantities of components without failures. This requires about a million units tested over a long period, which means a large staff and considerable financing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niccomp.com/Products/smt/NTCRel-FR71399.pdf |publisher=NIC |title=Failure Rate Estimation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tested failure rates are often complemented with feedback from the field from large users (field failure rate), which mostly lowers failure rate estimates

For historical reasons the failure rate units of Ta-e-caps and Al-e-caps are different. For Al-e-caps the [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] prediction is generally expressed in a [[failure rate]] [[Lambda|''λ'']], with the unit  [[Failures in time|'''F'''ailures '''I'''n '''T'''ime]] ('''FIT''') at standard operating conditions 40&amp;nbsp;°C and 0.5&amp;nbsp;U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; during the period of constant random failures. This is the number of failures that can be expected in one billion (10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) component-hours of operation (e.g., 1000 components for 1&amp;nbsp;million hours, or 1&amp;nbsp; million components for 1000 hours which is 1&amp;nbsp;ppm/1000 hours) at the standard operating conditions. This failure rate model implicitly assumes that failures are random. Individual components fail at random times but at a predictable rate. The reciprocal  value of FIT is [[Mean Time Between Failures|'''M'''ean '''T'''ime '''B'''etween '''F'''ailures]] (MTBF).

For Ta-e-caps the failure rate "F&lt;sub&gt;Ta&lt;/sub&gt;" is specified with the unit  "n&amp;nbsp;% failures per 1000 hours" at 85&amp;nbsp;°C, U = U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; and a circuit  resistance of 0.1&amp;nbsp;Ω/V. This is the failure percentage that can be expected in 1000 hours of operation at much more demanding  operational conditions compared with the “FIT” model. 
The failure rates “λ” and  "F&lt;sub&gt;Ta&lt;/sub&gt;" depend on operational conditions including temperature, voltage applied, and various environmental factors such as humidity, shocks or vibrations and of the capacitance value of the capacitor.&lt;ref name="AVX-Reliability"/&gt; Failure rates are an increasing function of temperature and applied voltage.

Solid Ta-e-caps and "wet" Al-e-caps failure rates can be recalculated with acceleration factors standardized for industrial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IEC/EN 61709, Electric components. Reliability. Reference conditions for failure rates and stress models for conversion|url=http://www.beuth.de/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; or military&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyspec.com/MIL-HDBK/MIL-HDBK-0200-0299/MIL-HDBK-217F_NOTICE-2_14590/|title=MIL-HDBK-217 F NOTICE-2 RELIABILITY PREDICTION ELECTRONIC|author=|date=|work=everyspec.com|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; contexts. The latter is established in industry and  often used for industrial applications. However, for polymer Ta-e-caps and polymer Al-e-caps  no acceleration factors had been published as of 2016. An example of a recalculation from a tantalum capacitor failure rate ''F&lt;sub&gt;Ta&lt;/sub&gt;'' into a failure rate ''λ'' therefore only can be given by comparing standard capacitors. Example:

A failure rate ''F&lt;sub&gt;Ta&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.1%/1000&amp;nbsp;h at 85&amp;nbsp;°C and ''U=&amp;nbsp;U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' shall be recalculated into a failure rate ''λ'' at 40&amp;nbsp;°C and ''U'' = 0,5&amp;nbsp;''U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''.

The following acceleration factors from MIL-HDBK 217F are used:
:''F&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;'' = voltage acceleration factor, for ''U'' = 0,5&amp;nbsp;''U&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' is ''F&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.1
:''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' = temperature acceleration factor, for ''T'' = 40&amp;nbsp;°C is ''F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.1
:''F&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' = acceleration factor for the series resistance ''R&lt;sub&gt;V&lt;/sub&gt;'', at the same value it is = 1
It follows
: ''λ'' = ''F&lt;sub&gt;Ta&lt;/sub&gt; x F&lt;sub&gt;U&lt;/sub&gt; x F&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; x F&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''  
: ''λ'' = (0.001/1000&amp;nbsp;h) × 0.1 × 0.1 × 1 = 0.00001/1000&amp;nbsp;h = 1•10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;/h = 1&amp;nbsp;FIT''

As of 2015 the published failure rate figures for polymer tantalum as well as for polymer aluminum capacitors are in the range of 0.5 to 20&amp;nbsp;FIT. These reliability levels within the calculated lifetime are comparable with other electronic components and achieve safe operation for decades under normal conditions.

===Lifetime, service life===
The [[Service life|life time]], [[service life]], load life or useful life of electrolytic capacitors is a special characteristic of non-solid electrolytic capacitors, whose liquid electrolyte can evaporate over the time leading to wear-out failures. Solid tantalum capacitors with MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte have no wear-out mechanism so that the constant failure rate least up to the point all capacitors have failed. They do not have a lifetime specification like non-solid Al-e-caps.

However, polymer tantalum as well as polymer aluminum electrolytic capacitors do have a life time specification. The polymer electrolyte has a small conductivity deterioration by a thermal degradation mechanism of the conductive polymer. The electrical conductivity decreases as a function of time, in agreement with a granular metal type structure, in which aging is due to the shrinking of the conductive polymer grains.&lt;ref name=Vitoratos /&gt;

The time of the capacitors functionality (useful life, load life, service life) is tested with a time [[Accelerated aging|accelerating]] endurance test according to [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC 60384-24/-25/-26]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=International Electrotechnical Commission [www.iec.ch] or Beuth Verlag |title=IEC 60384-24/-25/-26|url=http://www.beuth.de/en/}}&lt;/ref&gt; with rated voltage at the upper category temperature. Test conditions for passing the test are
* no short circuit or open circuit
* reduction of capacitance by less than 20% 
* increase of ESR, impedance or loss factor less than factor of 2

The specified limits for polymer capacitor degradation failures are much closer than for non-solid Al-e-caps. That means, the life time behavior of polymer e-caps are much more stable than for wet Al-e-caps.

The lifetime specification for polymer capacitors is specified in similar terms to non-solid Al-e-caps with a time in hours at maximum voltage and temperature, for example: 2000h/105&amp;nbsp;°C. This value can be used for an estimation of an operational life time at individual conditions by a formula called "20-degree-rule":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher==Nichicon |title=Technical Guide, Calculation Formula of Lifetime |url=http://www.nichicon.co.jp/english/products/pdf/2012fpcap_catalog_05.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Estimating of Lifetime Fujitsu Media Devices Limited |url=http://bbs.dianyuan.com/bbs/u/68/1111231219375672.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111421/http://bbs.dianyuan.com/bbs/u/68/1111231219375672.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.low-esr.com/endurance.asp |title=NIC Technical Guide, Calculation Formula of Lifetime |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915011312/http://low-esr.com/endurance.asp |archivedate=2013-09-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;L_x =L_\text{Spec}\cdot 10^\frac{T_0-T_A}{20}&lt;/math&gt;

* '''''L&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = life time to be estimated
* '''''L&lt;sub&gt;Spec&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = specified life time (useful life, load life, service life)
* '''''T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = upper category temperature (°C)
* '''''T&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''''' = temperature (°C) of the e-cap case or ambient temperature near the capacitor

This rule characterizes the change of thermic polymer reactions speed within the specified degradation limits. According to this formula the theoretical expected service life of a 2000&amp;nbsp;h/105&amp;nbsp;°C polymer capacitor, which is operated at 65&amp;nbsp;°C, can be calculated (better estimated) with about 200,000 hours or approximately 20 years.

For hybrid polymer Al-e-caps the 20-degree rule does not apply. The expected life of these polymer hybrid e-caps can be calculated using the [[Aluminum electrolytic capacitor#Lifetime, service life|10-degree rule]]. For above conditions e-caps with a liquid electrolyte can expect a life time of 32,000 hours or approximately 3.7 years.

===Failure modes, self-healing mechanism and application rules===

====Field crystallization====
Polymer capacitors, tantalum as well as aluminum, are reliable at the same high level as other electronic components with very low failure rates. However, all tantalum electrolytic capacitors, including polymer tantalum, have a unique failure mode called “field crystallization".&lt;ref name="Goudswaard"&gt;{{cite web |first1=B. |last1=Goudswaard |first2=F.

Field crystallization is the major reason for degradation and catastrophic failures of solid tantalum capacitors.&lt;ref name="How Far"&gt;{{cite web |first=Y. |last=Pozdeev-Freeman |publisher=Vishay |title=How Far Can We Go with High CV Tantalum Capacitors |journal=PCI |date=January–February 2005 |p=6 |url=http://old.passivecomponentmagazine.com/files/archives/2005/PCI_05_01Jan-Feb.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160124104649/http://old.passivecomponentmagazine.com/files/archives/2005/PCI_05_01Jan-Feb.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-01-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 90% of the today's rare failures Ta-e-caps are caused by shorts or increased leakage current due to this failure mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elna-america.com/tech_tan_failurerates.php |publisher=ELNA |title=Failure Rates of Tantalum Chip Capacitors}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extremely thin oxide film of a tantalum electrolytic capacitor, the dielectric layer, must be formed as an amorphous structure. Changing the amorphous structure into a crystallized structure increases conductivity, reportedly by 1,000 times, and also increases the oxide volume.&lt;ref name="FC-Study" /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=D. |last=Liu |publisher=MEI Technologies, Inc. |title=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Failure Modes in Capacitors When Tested Under a Time-Varying Stress |url=https://nepp.nasa.gov/files/21705/11_005_gsfc_Liu_Failure_Modes_in_Capacitors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Self-Healing Effects-Al-Ta-Polymer-E-Caps2.jpg|thumb|250px| After application of a voltage at weakened spots in the oxide of the capacitor a localized higher leakage current is formed, which leads to a local heating of the polymer, whereby the polymer either oxidized and becomes highly resistive or evaporates.]]

Field crystallization followed by a [[dielectric breakdown]] is characterized by a sudden rise in leakage current, within a few milliseconds, from nano-ampere magnitude to ampere magnitude in low-impedance circuits. Increasing current flow can be accelerate as an “avalanche effect” and rapidly spread through the metal/oxide. This can result in various degrees of destruction ranging from rather small, burned areas on the oxide to zigzag burned streaks covering large areas of the pellet or complete oxidation of the metal.&lt;ref name=VIS-DC &gt;{{cite web|publisher=Vishay |title=DC Leakage Failure Mode,  |url=http://www.vishay.com/docs/49268/tn0003.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=self-healing&gt;{{cite web|first1=J. |last1=Gill |first2=T. |last2=Zednicek |publisher=AVX |title=Voltage Derating Rules for Solid Tantalum and Niobium Capacitors |url=http://www.avx.com/docs/techinfo/VoltageDeratingRulesforSolidTantalumandNiobiumCapacitors.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the current source is unlimited a field crystallization may cause a capacitor [[short circuit]]. However, if the current source is limited in solid MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Ta-e-caps a self-healing process take place oxidizing MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  into insulating Mn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

In polymer Ta-e-caps combustion is not a risk. Field crystallization may occur, however. In this case, the polymer layer is selectively heated and burned away by the increasing leakage current so that the faulty point is isolated. Since the polymer material does not provide oxygen, the leakage current can not accelerate. However, the faulty area no longer contributes to the capacitors capacitance.

====Self-healing====
Polymer Al-e-caps exhibit the same self-healing mechanism as polymer Ta-e-caps. After application of a voltage at weakened spots in the oxide a localized higher leakage current is formed, which leads to a local heating of the polymer, whereby the polymer either oxidized and becomes highly resistive or evaporates. Also hybrid polymer Al-e-caps show this self-healing mechanism. However, to the faulty spot liquid electrolyte can flow and can deliver oxygen to build up new dielectric oxide. This is the reason for relatively low leakage current values for the hybrid polymer capacitors.

====Application rules====
The many different types of polymer electrolytic capacitors show differences in electrical long-term behavior, their inherent failure modes, and their self-healing mechanism. To ensure save operation, manufacturers recommend different application rules, oriented on type behavior, see following table:

===Imprinted markings===

Polymer electrolytic capacitors, given sufficient space, have coded imprinted markings to indicate
* manufacturer's name or trademark;
* manufacturer's type designation;
* polarity 
* rated capacitance;
* tolerance on rated capacitance
* rated voltage 
* climatic category or rated temperature;
* year and month (or week) of manufacture;

For very small capacitors no marking is possible.

The code of the markings vary by manufacturer.

===Standardization===
[[Electronic component]]s and related technologies standardization follows the rules given by the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iec.ch/|title=Welcome to the IEC - International Electrotechnical Commission|author=IEC - International Electrotechnical Commission|date=|work=iec.ch|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]], non-governmental international [[standards organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webstore.iec.ch/?ref=menu |title=IEC Webstore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beuth.de/de/|title=Beuth Verlag - Normen und Fachliteratur seit 1924|author=|date=|work=beuth.de|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of the characteristics and the procedure of the test methods for [[capacitor]]s for use in electronic equipment are set out in the '''Generic specification''':

* IEC/EN 60384-1 - Fixed capacitors for use in electronic equipment

The tests and requirements to be met by polymer tantalum and polymer aluminum electrolytic capacitors for use in electronic equipment for approval as standardized types are set out in the following '''sectional specifications''':

* IEC/EN 60384-24—''Surface mount fixed tantalum electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte''
* IEC/EN 60384-25—''Surface mount fixed aluminium electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte''
* IEC/EN 60384-26—''Fixed aluminium electrolytic capacitors with conductive polymer solid electrolyte''

=== Technological competition ===
The ESR and ESL characteristics of polymer electrolytic capacitors are converging to those of MLCC capacitors. Conversely, the specific capacitance of Class 2-MLCC capacitors is approaching that of tantalum chip capacitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=R. |last1=Hahn |first2=M. |last2=Randall |first3=J. |last3=Paulson |publisher=Kemet |title=The Battle for Maximum Volumetric Efficiency – Part 1:When Techniques Compete, Customers Win |url=http://www.kemet.com/Lists/TechnicalArticles/Attachments/58/2007%20CARTS-Europe%20The%20Battle%20for%20Max%20CV%20-%20Part%201.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=R. |last1=Hahn |first2=M. |last2=Randall |first3=J. |last3=Paulson |publisher=Kemet |title=The Battle for Maximum Volumetric Efficiency – Part 2: Advancements in Solid Electrolyte Capacitors |url=http://www.kemet.com/Lists/TechnicalArticles/Attachments/57/2007%20CARTS-Europe%20The%20Battle%20for%20Max%20CV%20-%20Part%202.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, apart from this increasing comparability there are arguments in favor of or against certain types of capacitors. Many capacitor manufacturers compose these crucial arguments of their technologies against the competition in presentations and articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AN-1099 Application Note, Capacitor Selection Guidelines for Analog Devices, Inc. |publisher=LDOs |first=Glenn |last=Morita |url=http://www.analog.com/static/imported-files/application_notes/AN-1099.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; f.&amp;nbsp;e.:

'''Polypropylene''' ('''PP'''), also known as '''polypropene''', is a [[thermoplastic]] [[polymer]] used in a wide variety of applications. It is produced via [[chain-growth polymerization]] from the [[monomer]] [[propylene]].

Polypropylene belongs to the group of [[polyolefin]]s and is [[Crystallization of polymers#Degree of crystallinity|partially crystalline]] and [[Chemical polarity#Nonpolar molecules|non-polar]]. Its properties are similar to [[polyethylene]], but it is slightly harder and more heat resistant. It is a white, mechanically rugged material and has a high chemical resistance.&lt;ref name="Ullmanns"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|authors=Kenneth S. Whiteley, T. Geoffrey Heggs, Hartmut Koch, Ralph L. Mawer, Wolfgang Immel|title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|encyclopedia=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2005|publisher=Wiley-VCH|place=Weinheim|doi=10.1002/14356007.a21_487|chapter=Polyolefins|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polypropylene is the second-most widely produced [[Commodity plastics|commodity plastic]] (after [[polyethylene]]) and it is often used in [[packaging and labeling]]. In 2013, the global market for polypropylene was about 55 million [[tonne]]s.&lt;ref name=ceresana&gt;{{cite web|title = Market Study: Polypropylene (3rd edition) |publisher = Ceresana|url = http://www.ceresana.com/en/market-studies/plastics/polypropylene/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Phillips Petroleum]] chemists [[J. Paul Hogan]] and [[Robert Banks (chemist)|Robert Banks]] first polymerized propylene in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1021/cen-v065n010.p030 |title=Discoverers of Polypropylene Share Prize |journal=Chemical &amp; Engineering News |volume=65 |issue=10 |pages=30 |year=1987 |last1=Stinson |first1=Stephen }}&lt;/ref&gt; Propylene was first polymerized to a crystalline isotactic polymer by [[Giulio Natta]] as well as by the German chemist Karl Rehn in March 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GjtJfmxvSWgC&amp;pg=PA76|page=76|title=Polymer Pioneers: A Popular History of the Science and Technology of Large Molecules|author=Morris, Peter J. T. |publisher=Chemical Heritage Foundation|year=2005|isbn=978-0-941901-03-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This pioneering discovery led to large-scale commercial production of isotactic polypropylene by the Italian firm [[Montecatini (company)|Montecatini]] from 1957 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg19426014.900-this-week-50-years-ago.html This week 50 years ago] in [[New Scientist]] 28 April 2007, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;  Syndiotactic polypropylene was also first synthesized by Natta and his coworkers.

After polyethylene, polypropylene is the most important plastic with revenues expected to exceed US$145 billion by 2019. The sales of this material are forecast to grow at a rate of 5.8% per year until 2021.&lt;ref name=ceresana/&gt;

=={{anchor|Properties}}Chemical and physical properties==
[[Image:Polypropene migrograph.png|thumb|[[Micrograph]] of polypropylene]]

Polypropylene is in many aspects similar to [[polyethylene]], especially in [[Dissolution (chemistry)#Polymers|solution behaviour]] and electrical properties. The [[methyl group]] improves mechanical properties and thermal resistance, although the chemical resistance decreases.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tripathi|first1=D. |title= Practical guide to polypropylene|date=2001 |publisher=RAPRA Technology |location=Shrewsbury |isbn=978-1859572825}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}} The properties of polypropylene depend on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution, crystallinity, type and proportion of comonomer (if used) and the iso[[tacticity]].&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt; In isotactic polypropylene, for example, the methyl groups are oriented on one side of the carbon backbone. This [[stereochemistry|arrangement]] creates a greater degree of crystallinity and results in a stiffer material that is more resistant to creep than both atactic polypropylene and polyethylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.porex.com/technologies/materials/porous-plastics/polypropylene/|title=Polypropylene Plastic Materials &amp; Fibers by Porex|last=|first=|date=|website=www.porex.com|publisher=|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical properties===
The density of (PP) is between 0.895 and 0.92 g/cm³. Therefore, PP is the [[Commodity plastics|commodity plastic]] with the lowest density. With lower density, [[Injection moulding|moldings parts]] with lower weight and more parts of a certain mass of plastic can be produced. Unlike polyethylene, crystalline and amorphous regions differ only slightly in their density. However, the density of polyethylene can significantly change with fillers.&lt;ref name="guide" /&gt;{{rp|24}}

The [[Young's modulus]] of PP is between 1300 and 1800 N/mm².

Polypropylene is normally tough and flexible, especially when [[copolymer]]ized with [[ethylene]]. This allows polypropylene to be used as an [[engineering plastic]], competing with materials such as [[acrylonitrile butadiene styrene]] (ABS). Polypropylene is reasonably economical.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Polypropylene has good resistance to [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]].&lt;ref name="Maier" /&gt;{{rp|3070}}

===Thermal properties===
The melting point of polypropylene occurs in  a range, so the melting point is determined by finding the highest temperature of a [[differential scanning calorimetry]] chart. Perfectly isotactic PP has a melting point of {{convert|171|C|abbr=on}}. Commercial isotactic PP has a melting point that ranges from {{convert|160|to|166|C|F|abbr=on}}, depending on [[atactic]] material and crystallinity. [[Syndiotactic]] PP with a crystallinity of 30% has a melting point of {{convert|130|C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Maier"&gt;{{Cite book|last = Maier|first = Clive|last2 = Calafut|first2 = Teresa|title = Polypropylene: the definitive user's guide and databook|page = 14|publisher = William Andrew|year = 1998|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AWaSJd9Non8C&amp;pg=PA14|isbn = 978-1-884207-58-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below 0&amp;nbsp;°C, PP becomes brittle.&lt;ref name=Kaiser2011p247&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaiser |first1=Wolfgang |title=Kunststoffchemie für Ingenieure von der Synthese bis zur Anwendung |trans-title=Plastics chemistry for engineers from synthesis to application |language=de |year=2011 |publisher=Hanser |location=München |isbn=978-3-446-43047-1 |edition=3rd |page=247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thermal expansion of polypropylene is very large, but somewhat less than that of polyethylene.&lt;ref name=Kaiser2011p247/&gt;

===Chemical properties===
Polypropylene at room temperature is resistant to fats and almost all organic [[solvent]]s, apart from strong oxidants. [[Oxidizing acid|Non-oxidizing acids]] and [[base (chemistry)|bases]] can be stored in [[container]]s made of PP. At elevated temperature, PP can be dissolved in nonpolar solvents such as [[xylene]], [[tetralin]] and [[decalin]]. Due to the tertiary carbon atom PP is chemically less resistant than PE (see [[Markovnikov rule]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nuyken |first1=von Sebastian |last2=Koltzenburg |first2=Michael |last3=Maskos |first3=Oskar |title=Polymere: Synthese, Eigenschaften und Anwendungen |trans-title=Polymers: synthesis, properties and applications |language=de |year=2013 |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-642-34772-6 |edition=1st }}{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most commercial polypropylene is [[isotactic]] and has an intermediate level of [[crystal]]linity between that of [[low-density polyethylene]] (LDPE) and [[high-density polyethylene]] (HDPE). Isotactic &amp; atactic polypropylene is soluble in P-xylene at 140&amp;nbsp;°C. Isotactic precipitates when the solution is cooled to 25&amp;nbsp;°C and atactic portion remains soluble in P-xylene.

The melt flow rate (MFR) or [[melt flow index]] (MFI) is a measure of molecular weight of polypropylene. The measure helps to determine how easily the molten raw material will flow during processing. Polypropylene with higher MFR will fill the plastic mold more easily during the injection or blow-molding production process. As the melt flow increases, however, some physical properties, like impact strength, will decrease.

There are three general types of polypropylene: [[homopolymer]], random copolymer, and [[block copolymer]]. The [[comonomer]] is typically used with [[ethylene]]. Ethylene-propylene rubber or [[EPDM]] added to polypropylene homopolymer increases its low temperature impact strength. Randomly polymerized ethylene monomer added to polypropylene homopolymer decreases the polymer crystallinity, lowers the melting point and makes the polymer more transparent.

==== Molecular structure - Tacticity ====
[[File:Polypropylene tacticity de.svg]]

&lt;small&gt;Polypropylene can be categorized as atactic polypropylene (PP-at), syndiotactic polypropylene (PP-st) and isotactic polypropylene (PP-it). In case of atactic polypropylene, the methyl group (-CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is randomly aligned, alternating (alternating) for syndiotactic polypropylene and evenly for isotactic polypropylene. This has an impact on the crystallinity (amorphous or semi-crystalline) and the thermal properties (expressed as [[glass transition point]] T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and [[melting point]] T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;/small&gt;

The term [[tacticity]] describes for polypropylene how the methyl group is oriented in the polymer chain. Commercial polypropylene is usually isotactic. This article therefore always refers to isotactic polypropylene, unless  stated otherwise. The tacticity is usually indicated in percent, using the isotactic index (according to DIN 16774). The index is measured by determining the fraction of the polymer insoluble in boiling [[heptane]]. Commercially available polypropylenes usually have an isotactic index between 85 and 95%. The tacticity effects the polymers [[Physical property|physical properties]]. As the [[methyl group]] is in isotactic propylene consistently located at the same side, it forces the macromolecule in a [[Helix|helical shape]], as also found in [[starch]]. An isotactic structure leads to a [[semi-crystalline polymer]]. The higher the isotacticity (the isotactic fraction), the greater the crystallinity, and thus also the softening point, rigidity, e-modulus and hardness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/568032693|title=Practical guide to polypropylene|last=Devesh.|first=Tripathi,|date=2002|publisher=Rapra Technology Ltd|isbn=978-1859573457|location=Shawbury, U.K.|oclc=568032693}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22}}

Atactic polypropylene, on the other hand, lacks any regularity which makes it unable to crystallize and [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]].

====  Crystal structure of polypropylene ====
Isotactic polypropylene has a high [[Crystallization of polymers#Degree of crystallinity|degree of crystallinity]], in industrial products 30 - 60%. Syndiothactic polypropylene is slightly less crystalline, atactic PP is [[Amorphous solid|amorphous]] (not crystalline).&lt;ref name="Domininghaus"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/706947259|title=Kunststoffe : Eigenschaften und Anwendungen|last=Hans.|first=Domininghaus,|date=2011|publisher=Springer Berlin|isbn=9783642161728|edition=8., bearb.

===== Isotactic polypropylene (iPP) =====
Isotactic polypropylene can exist in various crystalline modifications which differ by the molecular arrangement of the polymer chains. The crystalline modifications are categorized into the α-, β- and γ-modification as well as mesomorphic (smectic) forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/macp.1964.020750113 |title=Crystalline forms of isotactic polypropylene |year=1964 |last1=Jones |first1=A.

The degree of order of the mesomorphic phase ranges between the crystalline and the amorphous phase, its density is with 0.916 g·cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; comparatively. The mesomorphic phase is considered as cause for the transparency in rapidly cooled films (due to low order and small crystallites).&lt;ref name="Domininghaus" /&gt;

===== Syndiotactic polypropylene (sPP) =====
Syndiotactic polypropylene was discovered much later than isotactic PP and could only be prepared by using [[metallocene catalysts]]. Syndiotactic PP has a lower melting point, with 161 to 186&amp;nbsp;°C, depending on the degree of tacticity.&lt;ref name=DerosaAuriemma2006&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.progpolymsci.2005.11.002 |title=Structure and physical properties of syndiotactic polypropylene: A highly crystalline thermoplastic elastomer |journal=Progress in Polymer Science |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=145–237 |year=2006 |last1=Derosa |first1=C |last2=Auriemma |first2=F }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1021/bk-1992-0496.ch008 |chapter=Structure and Morphology of Highly Stereoregular Syndiotactic Polypropylene Produced by Homogeneous Catalysts |title=Catalysis in Polymer Synthesis |volume=496 |pages=104–20 |series=ACS Symposium Series |year=1992 |last1=Galambos |first1=Adam |last2=Wolkowicz |first2=Michael |last3=Zeigler |first3=Robert |isbn=978-0-8412-2456-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0032-3861(94)90978-4 |title=Crystallization, melting and morphology of syndiotactic polypropylene fractions: 1.

===== Atactic polypropylene (aPP) =====
Atactic polypropylene is amorphous and has therefore no crystal structure. Due to its lack of crystallinity, it is readily soluble even at moderate temperatures, which allows to separate it as by-product from isotactic polypropylene by [[Extraction (chemistry)|extraction]]. However, the aPP obtained this way is not completely amorphous but can still contain 15% crystalline parts. Atactic polypropylene can also be produced selectively using metallocene catalysts, atactic polypropyleneproduced this way has a considerably higher molecular weight.&lt;ref name="Domininghaus" /&gt;

Atactic polypropylene has lower density, melting point and softening temperature than the crystalline types and is tacky and rubber-like at room temperature. It is a colorless, cloudy material and can be used between -15 and +120&amp;nbsp;°C. Atactic polypropylene is used as a sealant, as an [[Insulating materials|insulating material]] for [[automobiles]] and as an additive to [[Asphalt|bitumen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Kunststoffchemie für Ingenieure: von der Synthese bis zur Anwendung |trans-title=Plastics chemistry for engineers: from synthesis to application |language=de |last=Wolfgang |first=Kaiser |date=2007 |publisher=Hanser |isbn=978-3-446-41325-2 |edition=2nd |location=München |oclc=213395068 |page=251 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Degradation====
[[Image:Failedrope1.jpg|thumb|300px|Effect of UV exposure on polypropylene rope]]
Polypropylene is liable to chain degradation from exposure to temperatures above 100&amp;nbsp;°C. Oxidation usually occurs at the [[tertiary carbon]] centers leading to chain breaking via reaction with [[oxygen]]. In external applications, degradation is evidenced by cracks and [[crazing]]. It may be protected by the use of various [[polymer stabilizers]], including UV-absorbing additives and [[anti-oxidant]]s such as phosphites (e.g. [[tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl)phosphite]]) and hindered phenols, which prevent [[polymer degradation]].&lt;ref name=Ullmanns/&gt;

Microbial communities isolated from soil samples mixed with starch have been shown to be capable of degrading polypropylene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8285678 |pmc=182519 |year=1993 |author1=Cacciari |first1=I |title=Isotactic polypropylene biodegradation by a microbial community: Physicochemical characterization of metabolites produced |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |volume=59 |issue=11 |pages=3695–700 |last2=Quatrini |first2=P |last3=Zirletta |first3=G |last4=Mincione |first4=E |last5=Vinciguerra |first5=V |last6=Lupattelli |first6=P |last7=Giovannozzi Sermanni |first7=G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Polypropylene has been reported to degrade while in human body as implantable mesh devices. The degraded material forms a tree bark-like layer at the surface of mesh fibers.&lt;ref name="Iakovlev et al 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/jbm.b.33502 |title=Degradation of polypropylenein vivo: A microscopic analysis of meshes explanted from patients |journal=Journal of Biomedical Materials Research Part B: Applied Biomaterials |volume=105 |issue=2 |pages=237–48 |year=2017 |last1=Iakovlev |first1=Vladimir V |last2=Guelcher |first2=Scott A |last3=Bendavid |first3=Robert }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optical properties===
PP can be made [[translucent]] when uncolored but is not as readily made transparent as [[polystyrene]], [[acrylic glass|acrylic]], or certain other plastics. It is often [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] or colored using pigments.

==Production==
Polypropylene is produced by the [[chain-growth polymerization]] of [[propene]]:

[[File:Polypropylène.png|frameless|467x467px]]

The industrial production processes can be grouped into gas phase polymerization, [[bulk polymerization]] and [[slurry]] polymerization. All state-of-the-art processes use either gas-phase or bulk reactor systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Gahleitner|first=Markus|title=Polypropylene|date=2014-03-26|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/14356007.o21_o04.pub2|work=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|pages=1–44|publisher=Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

*In gas-phase and slurry-reactors, the polymer is formed around heterogeneous catalyst particles. The gas-phase polymerization is carried out in a [[fluidized bed reactor]], [[propene]] is passed over a bed containing the [[Heterogeneous catalysis|heterogeneous (solid) catalyst]] and the formed polymer is separated as a fine powder and then converted into [[Pelletizing|pellets]]. Unreacted gas is recycled and fed back into the reactor.
*In bulk polymerization, liquid propene acts as a solvent to prevent the precipitation of the polymer. The polymerization proceeds at 60 to 80&amp;nbsp;°C and 30-40 atm are applied to keep the propene in the liquid state. For the bulk polymerization, typically [[Chemical reactor#CSTR (continuous stirred-tank reactor)|loop reactor]]s are applied. The bulk polymerization is limited to a maximum of 5% ethen as comonomer due to a limited solubility of the polymer in the liquid propene.
*In the slurry polymerization, typically C4 - C6 alkanes ([[butane]], [[pentane]] or [[hexane]]) are utilized as [[Chemically inert|inert]] diluent to [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspend]] the growing polymer particles. Propene is introduced into the mixture as a gas.

The properties of PP are strongly affected by its [[tacticity]], the orientation of the [[methyl group]]s ({{chem|CH|3}}) relative to the methyl groups in neighboring monomer units (see [[Polypropylene#Molecular structure - Tacticity|above]]). The tacticity of polypropylene can be chosen by the choice of an appropriate catalyst.

===Catalysts===
The properties of PP are strongly affected by its [[tacticity]], the orientation of the [[methyl group]]s ({{chem|CH|3}} in the figure) relative to the methyl groups in neighboring monomer units.  A [[Ziegler-Natta catalyst]] is able to restrict linking of monomer molecules to a specific orientation, either isotactic, when all methyl groups are positioned at the same side with respect to the backbone of the polymer chain, or syndiotactic, when the positions of the methyl groups alternate. Commercially available isotactic polypropylene is made with two types of Ziegler-Natta catalysts. The first group of the catalysts encompasses solid (mostly supported) catalysts and certain types of soluble [[metallocene]] catalysts. Such isotactic macromolecules coil into a [[Helix|helical]] shape; these helices then line up next to one another to form the crystals that give commercial isotactic polypropylene many of its desirable properties.

[[Image:Syndiotactic polypropene.png|thumb|right|A ball-and-stick model of syndiotactic polypropylene.]]

Another type of [[metallocene]] catalysts produce syndiotactic polypropylene.&lt;ref name=DerosaAuriemma2006/&gt; These macromolecules also coil into helices (of a different type) and crystallize.  Atactic polypropylene is an amorphous rubbery material. It can be produced commercially either with a special type of supported Ziegler-Natta catalyst or with some metallocene catalysts.

Modern supported Ziegler-Natta catalysts developed for the polymerization of propylene and other 1-alkenes to isotactic polymers usually use {{chem|TiCl|4}} as an active ingredient and {{chem|MgCl|2}} as a support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kissin, Y.

These catalysts are activated with special cocatalysts containing an organoaluminum compound such as Al(C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and the second type of a modifier. The catalysts are differentiated depending on the procedure used for fashioning catalyst particles from MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and depending on the type of organic modifiers employed during catalyst preparation and use in polymerization reactions. Two most important technological characteristics of all the supported catalysts are high productivity and a high fraction of the crystalline isotactic polymer they produce at 70–80&amp;nbsp;°C under standard polymerization conditions. Commercial synthesis of isotactic polypropylene is usually carried out either in the medium of liquid propylene or in gas-phase reactors.

Commercial synthesis of syndiotactic polypropylene is carried out with the use of a special class of metallocene catalysts. They employ bridged bis-metallocene complexes of the type bridge-(Cp&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)(Cp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)ZrCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; where the first Cp ligand is the cyclopentadienyl group, the second Cp ligand is the fluorenyl group, and the bridge between the two Cp ligands is -CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-, &gt;SiMe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or &gt;SiPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Benedikt, G.

==Industrial processes==
Traditionally, three manufacturing processes are the most representative ways to produce polypropylene.&lt;ref name="Technology Economics Program"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.magcloud.com/browse/issue/411008|title= Polypropylene Production via Gas Phase Process, Technology Economics Program|publisher=by Intratec, {{ISBN|978-0-615-66694-5}}, Q3 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrocarbon slurry or suspension: Uses a liquid inert hydrocarbon diluent in the reactor to facilitate transfer of propylene to the catalyst, the removal of heat from the system, the deactivation/removal of the catalyst as well as dissolving the atactic polymer. The range of grades that could be produced was very limited. (The technology has fallen into disuse).

Bulk slurry (or bulk): Uses liquid propylene instead of liquid inert hydrocarbon diluent. The polymer does not dissolve into a diluent, but rather rides on the liquid propylene. The formed polymer is withdrawn and any unreacted monomer is flashed off.

Gas phase: Uses gaseous propylene in contact with the solid catalyst, resulting in a [[fluidized-bed]] medium.

==Manufacturing from polypropylene==
Melting process of polypropylene can be achieved via [[extrusion]] and [[Molding (process)|molding]]. Common extrusion methods include production of melt-blown and spun-bond fibers to form long rolls for future conversion into a wide range of useful products, such as face masks, filters, diapers and wipes.

The most common shaping technique is [[injection molding]], which is used for parts such as cups, cutlery, vials, caps, containers, housewares, and automotive parts such as batteries. The related techniques of [[blow molding]] and [[injection-stretch blow molding]] are also used, which involve both extrusion and molding.

The large number of end-use applications for polypropylene are often possible because of the ability to tailor grades with specific molecular properties and additives during its manufacture. For example, [[antistatic]] additives can be added to help polypropylene surfaces resist dust and dirt. Many physical finishing techniques can also be used on polypropylene, such as [[machining]]. [[Surface finishing|Surface treatments]] can be applied to polypropylene parts in order to promote adhesion of printing ink and paints.

Expanded Polypropylene (EPP) has been produced through both solid and melt state processing. EPP is manufactured using melt processing with either chemical or physical blowing agents. Expansion of PP in solid state, due to its highly crystalline structure, has not been successful. In this regard, two novel strategies were developed for expansion of PP. It was observed that PP can be expanded to make EPP through controlling its crystalline structure or through blending with other polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pen.10664 |title=Effect of the crystallinity and morphology on the microcellular foam structure of semicrystalline polymers |journal=Polymer Engineering &amp; Science |volume=36 |issue=21 |pages=2645–62 |year=1996 |last1=Doroudiani |first1=Saeed |last2=Park |first2=Chul B |last3=Kortschot |first3=Mark T }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/pen.10289 |title=Processing and characterization of microcellular foamed high-density polythylene/isotactic polypropylene blends |journal=Polymer Engineering &amp; Science |volume=38 |issue=7 |pages=1205–15 |year=1998 |last1=Doroudiani |first1=Saeed |last2=Park |first2=Chul B |last3=Kortschot |first3=Mark T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP)===
{{anchor|BOPP}}

When polypropylene film is extruded and stretched in both the machine direction and across machine direction it is called ''biaxially oriented polypropylene''. Biaxial orientation increases strength and clarity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.granwell.com/bopp/ Biaxially Oriented Polypropylene Films].  Granwell.  Retrieved: 2012-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt; BOPP is widely used as a packaging material for packaging products such as snack foods, fresh produce and confectionery. It is easy to coat, print and laminate to give the required appearance and properties for use as a packaging material.  This process is normally called [[converting]]. It is normally produced in large rolls which are slit on [[Roll slitting|slitting machines]] into smaller rolls for use on packaging machines.

==Applications==
&lt;!-- (e.g., [[rope]]s, thermal underwear and carpets)
loudspeakers, 
[[polymer banknote]]s
Polypropylene has a relatively slippery "low energy surface" that means that many common glues will not form adequate joints. Joining of polypropylene is often done using welding processes.
--&gt;

As polypropylene is resistant to fatigue, most plastic [[living hinge]]s, such as those on flip-top bottles, are made from this material. However, it is important to ensure that chain molecules are oriented across the hinge to maximise strength.

Polypropylene is used in the manufacturing [[piping]] systems; both ones concerned with high-purity and ones designed for strength and rigidity (e.g. those intended for use in potable plumbing, [[hydronic heating]] and cooling, and [[reclaimed water]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1520/F2389-17A |title=Specification for Pressure-rated Polypropylene (PP) Piping Systems }}&lt;/ref&gt; This material is often chosen for its resistance to corrosion and chemical leaching, its resilience against most forms of physical damage, including impact and freezing, its environmental benefits, and its ability to be joined by [[heat fusion]] rather than gluing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://contractormag.com/news/green-pipe-mine-2345 Green pipe helps miners remove the black] Contractor Magazine, 10 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achrnews.com/Articles/Feature_Article/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000690490 Contractor Retrofits His Business]. the News/ 2 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esmagazine.com/Articles/Case_In_Point/BNP_GUID_9-5-2006_A_10000000000000691766 What to do when the piping replacement needs a replacement?] Engineered Systems. 1 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many plastic items for medical or laboratory use can be made from polypropylene because it can withstand the heat in an [[autoclave]]. Its heat resistance also enables it to be used as the manufacturing material of consumer-grade [[kettle]]s{{Citation needed|date=February 2012|reason=A PP kettle could not be used on a stovetop}}. Food containers made from it will not melt in the dishwasher, and do not melt during industrial hot filling processes. For this reason, most plastic tubs for dairy products are polypropylene sealed with aluminum foil (both heat-resistant materials). After the product has cooled, the tubs are often given lids made of a less heat-resistant material, such as LDPE or polystyrene. Such containers provide a good hands-on example of the difference in modulus, since the rubbery (softer, more flexible) feeling of LDPE with respect to polypropylene of the same thickness is readily apparent. Rugged, translucent, reusable [[plastic container]]s made in a wide variety of shapes and sizes for consumers from various companies such as [[Rubbermaid]] and [[Sterilite]] are commonly made of polypropylene, although the lids are often made of somewhat more flexible LDPE so they can snap onto the container to close it. Polypropylene can also be made into disposable bottles to contain liquid, powdered, or similar consumer products, although HDPE and [[polyethylene terephthalate]] are commonly also used to make bottles. Plastic pails, car batteries, wastebaskets, pharmacy prescription bottles, cooler containers, dishes and pitchers are often made of polypropylene or HDPE, both of which commonly have rather similar appearance, feel, and properties at ambient temperature.  A diversity of medical devices are made from PP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collinet|first=Pierre|last2=Belot|first2=Franck|last3=Debodinance|first3=Philippe|last4=Duc|first4=Edouard Ha|last5=Lucot|first5=Jean-Philippe|last6=Cosson|first6=Michel|date=2006-08-01|title=Transvaginal mesh technique for pelvic organ prolapse repair: mesh exposure management and risk factors |journal=International Urogynecology Journal|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=315–320|doi=10.1007/s00192-005-0003-8|issn=0937-3462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:PolypropyleneItemsForLaboratoryUse.jpg|thumb|Polypropylene items for laboratory use, blue and orange closures are not made of polypropylene.]]

A common application for polypropylene is as biaxially oriented polypropylene (BOPP). These BOPP sheets are used to make a wide variety of materials including clear [[Plastic bag|bags]]. When polypropylene is biaxially oriented, it becomes crystal clear and serves as an excellent packaging material for artistic and retail products.

Polypropylene, highly colorfast, is widely used in manufacturing carpets, rugs and mats to be used at home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fibersource.com/f-tutor/olefin.htm Rug fibers]. Fibersource.com. Retrieved on 2012-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Polypropylene is widely used in ropes, distinctive because they are light enough to float in water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contractorsrope.com/braided-polypropylene-rope.html Braided Polypropylene Rope is Inexpensive and it Floats]. contractorrope.com. Retrieved on 2013-02-28.&lt;/ref&gt; For equal mass and construction, polypropylene rope is similar in strength to polyester rope. Polypropylene costs less than most other synthetic fibers.

Polypropylene is also used as an alternative to [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC) as insulation for electrical cables for [[Low Smoke Zero Halogen|LSZH]] cable in low-ventilation environments, primarily tunnels. This is because it emits less smoke and no toxic halogens, which may lead to production of acid in high-temperature conditions.

Polypropylene is also used in particular roofing membranes as the waterproofing top layer of single-ply systems as opposed to modified-bit systems.

Polypropylene is most commonly used for plastic moldings, wherein it is injected into a mold while molten, forming complex shapes at relatively low cost and high volume; examples include bottle tops, bottles, and fittings.

It can also be produced in sheet form, widely used for the production of stationery folders, packaging, and storage boxes. The wide color range, durability, low cost, and resistance to dirt make it ideal as a protective cover for papers and other materials. It is used in [[Rubik's Cube]] stickers because of these characteristics.

The availability of sheet polypropylene has provided an opportunity for the use of the material by designers. The light-weight, durable, and colorful plastic makes an ideal medium for the creation of light shades, and a number of designs have been developed using interlocking sections to create elaborate designs.

Polypropylene sheets are a popular choice for [[trading card]] collectors; these come with pockets (nine for standard-size cards) for the cards to be inserted and are used to protect their condition and are meant to be stored in a binder.

Expanded polypropylene (EPP) is a [[Polymeric foam|foam]] form of polypropylene. EPP has very good impact characteristics due to its low stiffness; this allows EPP to resume its shape after impacts. EPP is extensively used in model [[aircraft]] and other radio controlled vehicles by hobbyists. This is mainly due to its ability to absorb impacts, making this an ideal material for RC aircraft for beginners and amateurs.

Polypropylene is used in the manufacture of loudspeaker drive units. Its use was pioneered by engineers at the [[BBC]] and the patent rights subsequently purchased by [[Mission Electronics]] for use in their [[Mission Freedom Loudspeaker]] and [[Mission 737 Renaissance]] loudspeaker.

Polypropylene fibres are used as a [[concrete]] additive to increase strength and reduce cracking and [[spalling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.14359/4439 |title=Properties of Polypropylene Fiber Reinforced |year=1993 |author1=Bayasi, Ziad  |author2=Zeng, Jack  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Materials Journal |volume=90 |issue=6 |pages=605–610}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some areas susceptible to earthquake, e.g. California, PP fibers are added with soils to improve the soils strength and damping when constructing the foundation of structures such as buildings, bridges, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/17486025.2015.1029013 |title=Effect of fibre inclusion on dynamic properties of clay |year=2015 |author1=Amir-Faryar, Behzad  |author2=Aggour, M. Sherif  |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Geomechanics and Geoengineering: An International Journal |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polypropylene is used in [[polypropylene drum]]s.

In June 2016, a study showed that a mixture of polypropylene and durable [[Oleophobic|superoleophobic]] surfaces created by two engineers from [[Ohio State University]] can repel liquids such as shampoo and oil. This technology could make it easier to remove all of the liquid contents from polypropylene bottles, particularly those that have high surface tension such as shampoo or oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/27/science/shampoo-bottle-nonstick.html|title=Bottles That Could Make Every Drop of Shampoo Count|last=Yin|first=Steph|date=2016-06-26|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clothing===
[[File:Textielmuseum-cabinet-03.jpg|thumb|Various polypropylene yarns and textiles]]
Polypropylene is a major polymer used in [[nonwovens]], with over 50% used{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} for diapers or sanitary products where it is treated to absorb water (hydrophilic) rather than naturally repelling water (hydrophobic). Other interesting non-woven uses include filters for air, gas, and liquids in which the fibers can be formed into sheets or webs that can be pleated to form cartridges or layers that filter in various efficiencies in the 0.5 to 30 [[micrometre]] range. Such applications occur in houses as water filters or in air-conditioning-type filters. The high surface-area and naturally oleophilic polypropylene nonwovens are ideal absorbers of oil spills with the familiar{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} floating barriers near oil spills on rivers.

Polypropylene, or 'polypro', has been used for the fabrication of cold-weather base layers, such as long-sleeve shirts or long underwear. Polypropylene is also used in warm-weather clothing, in which it transports sweat away from the skin. Polyester has replaced polypropylene in these applications in the U.S. military, such as in the [[Extended Cold Weather Clothing System|ECWCS]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081217143906/http://peosoldier.army.mil/factsheets/SEQ_CIE_ECWCS.pdf Generation III Extended Cold Weather Clothing System (ECWCS)]. PM Soldier Equipment. October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Although polypropylene clothes are not easily flammable, they can melt, which may result in severe burns if the wearer is involved in an explosion or fire of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps11992/2002/fsmnov02.pdf USAF Flying Magazine. Safety. Nov. 2002]. access.gpo.gov&lt;/ref&gt; Polypropylene undergarments are known for retaining body odors which are then difficult to remove. The current generation of polyester does not have this disadvantage.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[fashion designer]]s have adapted polypropylene to construct jewelry and other [[fashion accessory|wearable items]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

===Medical===
Its most common medical use is in the synthetic, nonabsorbable [[surgical suture|suture]] [[Prolene]], manufactured by [[Ethicon Inc.]]

Polypropylene has been used in [[hernia]] and pelvic organ prolapse repair operations to protect the body from new hernias in the same location. A small patch of the material is placed over the spot of the hernia, below the skin, and is painless and rarely, if ever, rejected by the body. However, a polypropylene mesh will erode the tissue surrounding it over the uncertain period from days to years.

A notable application was as a transvaginal mesh, used to treat vaginal prolapse and concurrent urinary incontinence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collinet|first=Pierre|last2=Belot|first2=Franck|last3=Debodinance|first3=Philippe|last4=Duc|first4=Edouard Ha|last5=Lucot|first5=Jean-Philippe|last6=Cosson|first6=Michel|date=2006-08-01|title=Transvaginal mesh technique for pelvic organ prolapse repair: mesh exposure management and risk factors|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00192-005-0003-8|journal=International Urogynecology Journal|language=en|volume=17|issue=4|pages=315–320|doi=10.1007/s00192-005-0003-8|issn=0937-3462}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the above-mentioned propensity for polypropylene mesh to erode the tissue surrounding it, the FDA has issued several warnings on the use of polypropylene mesh medical kits for certain applications in pelvic organ prolapse, specifically when introduced in close proximity to the vaginal wall due to a continued increase in number of mesh-driven tissue erosions reported by patients over the past few years.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/medicaldevices/safety/alertsandnotices/ucm262435.htm UPDATE on Serious Complications Associated with Transvaginal Placement of Surgical Mesh for Pelvic Organ Prolapse: FDA Safety Communication], FDA, July 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  On 3 January 2012, the FDA ordered 35 manufacturers of these mesh products to study the side effects of these devices.

===Niche===
Very thin sheets (~2–20&amp;nbsp;µm) of polypropylene are used as a [[dielectric]] within certain high-performance [[Pulsed power|pulse]] and low-loss [[Radio frequency|RF]] [[capacitors]].

Expanded polypropylene (EPP) [[Polymeric foam|foams]] is a structural material in hobbyist [[radio control]] [[model aircraft]]. Unlike expanded polystyrene foam (EPS) which is friable and breaks easily on impact, EPP foam is able to absorb kinetic impacts very well without breaking, retains its original shape, and exhibits memory form characteristics which allow it to return to its original shape in a short amount of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Sadighi| first=Mojtaba| author2=Salami, Sattar Jedari| title=An investigation on low-velocity impact response of elastomeric &amp; crushable foams|journal=Central European Journal of Engineering| date=2012| volume=2| issue=4| pages=627–637| doi=10.2478/s13531-012-0026-0|bibcode=2012OEng....2..627S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the cathedral on [[Tenerife]], [[La Laguna Cathedral]], was repaired in 2002–2014, it turned out that the vaults and dome were in a rather bad condition. Therefore, these parts of the building were demolished, and replaced by constructions in polypropylene. This was reported as the first time this material was used in this scale in buildings.{{Citation needed|reason=Reported by the en-wp and es-wp articles; but badly sourced in these.|date=July 2015}}

Under the trade name Ulstron polypropylene rope is used to manufacture scoop nets for whitebait.  It has also been used for sheets of yacht sails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nacsan.co.nz/products/whitebait-nets/netting/ "whitebait netting"]. ''www.nacsan.co.nz''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Product leaflet for Vivacity 650 yacht, 1970s&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recycling==
Polypropylene is recyclable and has the number "5" as its [[resin identification code]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wasteonline.org.uk/resources/InformationSheets/Plastics.htm Plastics recycling information sheet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722003753/http://www.wasteonline.org.uk/resources/InformationSheets/Plastics.htm |date=2010-07-22 }}, Waste Online&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Symbol_Resin_Code_5_PP.svg|50px]]

==Repairing==
Many objects are made with polypropylene precisely because it is resilient and resistant to most solvents and glues.  Also, there are very few glues available specifically for gluing PP. However, solid PP objects not subject to undue flexing can be satisfactorily joined with a [[Epoxy resin|two part epoxy]] glue or using hot-glue guns.  Preparation is important and it is often helpful to roughen the surface with a file, emery paper or other abrasive material to provide better anchorage for the glue.  Also it is recommended to clean with mineral spirits or similar alcohol prior to gluing to remove any oils or other contamination.  Some experimentation may be required.  There are also some industrial glues available for PP, but these can be difficult to find, especially in a retail store.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

PP can be melted using a speed welding technique. With speed welding, the plastic welder, similar to a soldering iron in appearance and wattage, is fitted with a feed tube for the plastic weld rod. The speed tip heats the rod and the substrate, while at the same time it presses the molten weld rod into position. A bead of softened plastic is laid into the joint, and the parts and weld rod fuse. With polypropylene, the melted welding rod must be "mixed" with the semi-melted base material being fabricated or repaired.  A speed tip "gun" is essentially a soldering iron with a broad, flat tip that can be used to melt the weld joint and filler material to create a bond.

==Safety==

===Health concerns===
The advocacy organization [[Environmental Working Group]] classifies PP as of low to moderate hazard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cosmeticdatabase.com/ingredient.php?ingred06=705094 POLYPROPYLENE || Skin Deep® Cosmetics Database | Environmental Working Group]. Cosmeticdatabase.com. Retrieved on 2012-05-31.&lt;/ref&gt;
PP is [[Wet processing engineering#Solution dyeing|dope-dyed]]; no [[water]] is used in its dyeing, in contrast with [[cotton]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapagain, A.K. ''et al.''

==Combustiblity==
Like all organic compounds, polypropylene is combustible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/978-94-011-4421-6_34| chapter = Fire hazard with polypropylene| title = Polypropylene| volume = 2| pages = 247| series = Polymer Science and Technology Series| year = 1999| last1 = Shields| first1 = T.

A '''power conditioner''' (also known as a '''line conditioner''' or '''power line conditioner''') is a device intended to improve the [[power quality|quality of the power]] that is delivered to electrical load equipment.  The term most often refers to a device that acts in one or more ways to deliver a [[voltage]] of the proper level and characteristics to enable load equipment to function properly. In some uses, power conditioner refers to a [[voltage regulator]] with at least one other function to improve power quality (e.g. [[power factor]] correction, noise suppression, transient impulse protection, etc.)

The terms "power conditioning" and "power conditioner" can be misleading, as the word "power" here refers to the [[electricity]] generally rather than the more technical [[electric power]].  

Conditioners specifically work to smooth the [[sinusoidal]] [[Alternating current|A.C.]] wave form and maintain a constant [[voltage]] over varying loads.

==Types==
An '''AC power conditioner''' is the typical power conditioner that provides "clean" AC power to sensitive electrical equipment. Usually this is used for home or office applications and has up to 10 or more receptacles or outlets and commonly provides [[surge protection]] as well as noise filtering.

'''Power line conditioners''' take in power and modify it based on the requirements of the machinery to which they are connected. Attributes to be conditioned are measured with various devices, such as, [[Phasor measurement unit]]s. [[Voltage spike]]s are most common during electrical storms or malfunctions in the main power lines. The surge protector stops the flow of electricity from reaching a machine by shutting off the power source.

The term "Power Conditioning" has been difficult to define historically. However, with the advances in power technology and recognition by IEEE, NEMA, and other standards organizations, a new actual engineering definition has now been developed and accepted to provide an accurate depiction of this definition.

"Power Conditioning" is the ability to filter the AC line signal provided by the power company.
"Power Regulation" is the ability to take a signal from the local power company, turn it into a DC signal that will run an oscillator, which generates a single frequency sine wave, determined by the local area needs, is fed to the input stage of power amplifier, and is then output as specified as the ideal voltage present at any standard wall outlet.

== Design ==
A good quality power conditioner is designed with internal filter banks to isolate the individual power outlets or receptacles on the power conditioner.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}} This eliminates interference or "cross-talk" between components. For example, if the application will be a [[home cinema|home theater]] system, the noise suppression rating listed in the technical specifications of the power conditioner will be very important.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} This rating is expressed in decibels (db). The higher the db rating, the better the noise suppression. 

Active power filters (APF) are filters which can perform the job of harmonic elimination. Active power filters can be used to filter out harmonics in the [[power system]] which are significantly below the switching frequency of the filter. The active power filters are used to filter out both higher and lower order harmonics in the [[power system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=He, Jinwei, Beihua Liang, Yun Wei Li, and Chengshan Wang|title=Simultaneous Microgrid Voltage and Current Harmonics Compensation Using Coordinated Control of Dual-Interfacing Converters|journal=IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics |date=7 June 2016|volume=32|issue=4|pages=2647–2660|doi=10.1109/TPEL.2016.2576684|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7484692/|accessdate=22 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main difference between active power filters and passive power filters is that APFs mitigate harmonics by injecting active power with the same frequency but with reverse phase to cancel that harmonic, where passive power filters use combinations of [[resistor]]s (R), [[inductor]]s (L) and [[capacitor]]s (C) and does not require an external power source or active components such as transistors. This difference makes it possible for APFs to mitigate a wide range of harmonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jain, S. K., P. Agrawal, and H. O. Gupta

The power conditioner will also have a "joule" rating. A joule is a measurement of energy or heat required to sustain one watt for one second, known as a [[watt second]]. Since electrical surges are momentary spikes, the joule rating indicates how much electrical energy the suppressor can absorb at once before becoming damaged itself. The higher the joule rating, the greater the protection.

== Uses ==
Power conditioners vary in function and size, generally according to their use. Some power conditioners provide minimal [[voltage regulation]] while others protect against six or more [[power quality]] problems. Units may be small enough to mount on a [[printed circuit board]] or large enough to protect an entire factory. 

Small power conditioners are rated in [[volt-ampere]]s (V·A) while larger units are rated in kilovolt-amperes (kV·A).

Ideally electric power would be supplied as a [[sine wave]] with the amplitude and frequency given by national standards (in the case of mains) or system specifications (in the case of a power feed not directly attached to the mains) with an [[Electrical impedance|impedance]] of zero ohms at all frequencies. 

No real life power feed will ever meet this ideal. Deviations may include:
* Variations in the peak or RMS voltage are both important to different types of equipment.
* When the RMS voltage exceeds the nominal voltage by 10 to 80% for 0.5 cycle to 1 minute, the event is called a "swell".
* A "dip" (in British English) or a "sag" (in American English – the two terms are equivalent) is the opposite situation: the RMS voltage is below the nominal voltage by 10 to 90% for 0.5 cycle to 1 minute.
* Random or repetitive variations in the RMS voltage between 90 and 110% of nominal can produce a [[Flicker (light)|flicker]] in lighting equipment.  A precise definition of such voltage fluctuations that produce flicker has been subject to ongoing debate in more than one scientific community for many years.
* Abrupt, very brief increases in voltage, called "spikes", "impulses", or "surges", generally caused by large inductive loads being turned off, or more severely by lightning.
* "[[Undervoltage]]" occurs when the nominal voltage drops below 90% for more than 1 minute. The term "brownout" in common usage has no formal definition but is commonly used to describe a reduction in system voltage by the utility or system operator to decrease demand or to increase system operating margins.
* "[[Overvoltage]]" occurs when the nominal voltage rises above 110% for more than 1 minute.
* Variations in the frequency
* Variations in the wave shape – usually described as harmonics
* Nonzero low-frequency impedance (when a load draws more power, the voltage drops)
* Nonzero high-frequency impedance (when a load demands a large amount of current, then stops demanding it suddenly, there will be a dip or spike in the voltage due to the inductances in the power supply line)

'''Refinaria de Paulínia''' or simply '''REPLAN''' is a petroleum refinery located in the city of [[Paulínia]] in the [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo state]], in [[Brazil]]. REPLAN is the largest refinery of the Brazilian company [[Petrobras]], with a capacity of about {{convert|360000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}, which accounts for about 20% of Brazilian overall petroleum refining capacity. About 80% of the processed petroleum is produced in Brazil, mostly from the [[Campos Basin]].

==In popular culture==

The REPLAN refinery was destroyed in the Tom Clancy novel Dead or Alive, by terrorists hoping to undermine a deal between the United States and Petrobras to ship oil to the United States at sub-OPEC prices.

[[File:Plain quarter sawn.png|thumb|right|Rip cuts produce [[lumber]] of different cuts such as [[Quarter sawing|''quarter sawn'']] (A), ''flat'' or ''plain sawn'' (B), or [[Rift sawing|rift sawn]] (other image).]]
[[image:riftsawn.svg|thumb|The rift sawn rip cuts are perpendicular to the center of the log]]
In [[woodworking]], a '''rip-cut''' is a type of cut that severs or divides a piece of wood parallel to the [[Wood grain|grain]]. The other typical type of cut is a ''cross-cut'', a cut perpendicular to the grain. Unlike cross-cutting, which shears the wood fibers, a rip saw works more like a series of [[chisel]]s, lifting off small splinters of wood. The nature of the wood grain requires the shape of the saw teeth to be different thus the need for both [[rip saw]]s and [[crosscut saw]]s; however some circular saw blades are ''combination blades'' and can make both types of cuts. A rip cut is the fundamental type of cut made at a [[sawmill]].

==Definitions==
''Rip cut'' comes from ''rip'': to split or saw timber in the direction of the grain, and ''cut'': to divide with a sharp-edged instrument.&lt;ref name="OED" &gt;"Rip v. 2." def. 2.a., "cut v." def. 7.a., "rive v.1." def. 4 and "kerf" def 2.a. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
Wood may also be [[wood splitting|split]] along the grain (riven), but the split will follow the grain and usually not be flat. [[Wood#Knots|Knots]] also prevent riving thus the need for rip cuts. A ''kerf'' is the opening in the wood made by the saw.

==Handsaws==
Types of [[hand saw]]s used to make rip cuts are [[Rip_saw|rip saws]], [[frame saw]]s some of which are [[whipsaw]]s, and veneer saws.

==Power saws==
Rip cuts are commonly made with a [[table saw]], but other types of power saws can also be used, including a [[radial arm saw]], [[band saw]], and hand held circular saw. In sawmills the [[head saw]] is the first rip-saw a log goes through, which is sometimes a gang-saw, and then the cants may be resawn using other saws and then edged in a [[Lumber edger|edger]] and sometimes cut to length by a [[crosscut saw]]. Also, smaller [[portable sawmill]]s and [[chainsaw mill]]s use rip-cuts to produce lumber. Each time a piece of wood is rip cut it takes time and the kerf material turns into sawdust and loses value so the number and width of each rip cut influence the economics of the operation: This gives band saws an advantage over circular saws and chainsaws.

==Types of cuts==
The types of rip-cuts influence the quality of the lumber. Plain-sawn is the most common type of cut where a log is repeatedly run through a saw and much of the lumber has [[wood grain]] nearly parallel to the width of the boards. [[Quarter sawing|Quarter sawn]] and [[Rift sawing|rift-sawn]] wood is more time consuming and wasteful to produce but is higher quality. 

As a general rule, tools which work well for rip cutting do not work well for crosscutting. Most woodworkers thus have a table saw, which is used for rip cutting, and a separate chop or [[Miter saw#Power miter saw|miter saw]], which is used for crosscutting. Crosscut power-saws should never be used for ''ripping'' a board because it is very dangerous. [[Circular saw]] blades designed for rip cutting have a smaller number of larger teeth than similar blades designed for cross cutting. There are combination blades for table saws that can be used for ripping and cross cutting but should not be used for non through cuts such as [[Dado (joinery)|dados]] and [[rabbet]]s. If you use a radial arm saw to rip you need a blade with a negative hook angle for the teeth to keep the saw from lifting the board off the saw and kicking back.

The '''Roll Out Solar Array''', known as '''ROSA''', is a [[solar array]] designed by [[NASA]].&lt;ref name="ROSA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Roll Out Solar Array|url=http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/nasa-tests-flexible-solar-array-on-space-station/article19113641.ece|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new type of solar array provides much more energy than the old solar arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rory Barrett|first1=Douglas Campbell|title=Development of a Passively Deployed Roll-Out Solar Array|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=dHt_AQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Roll+Out+Solar+Array%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj80Ird2O3UAhVELY8KHVq0CSoQ6AEIJzAA|publisher=Defense Technical Information Center, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional solar panels used to power satellites can be bulky with heavy panels folded together using mechanical hinges. When launching into space, mass and volume are everything, and ROSA is 20 percent lighter and four times smaller in volume than rigid panel arrays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Converting Sunlight into Electricity: Deployable Space Systems Inc|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-485987901.html|website=HighBeam|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a flexible and rollable solar array like a measuring tape wound on its spool. The new solar array design rolls up to form a compact cylinder for launch with significantly less mass and volume, potentially offering substantial cost savings as well as an increase in power for satellites. Being smaller and lighter than the traditional solar panels, ROSA has a center wing made of a flexible material which support the strings of [[photovoltaic]] cells that churn out electrical energy. Both the sides of the wing have a narrow arm that extends through the length of the wing to provide support to the array, called a high strain composite boom. The booms look like split tubes made of a stiff [[composite material]], flattened and rolled up lengthwise.The array does not need any motor to unfurl.This is achieved using the energy stored in the booms that is released as each boom transitions from a coil shape to a straight support arm. Those solar wings are then deployed due to strain energy in rolled booms that are present at the two ends of the structure.

==Patent==
Brian R Spence,and Stephen F White are the first persons to come up with the idea of Roll Out Solar Array on Jan 21st, 2010.&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;{{cite web|title=Directionally controlled elastically deployable roll-out solar array|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US8683755#backward-citations|website=www.google/patents|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They received a patent for this work on April 1 of 2014&lt;ref name="patent" /&gt;

==History==
NASA tested the ROSA technology in vacuum chambers on earth several years ago, but still decided to test it in space on June 18 of 2017. Over the weekend of June 17–18, 2017, engineers on the ground remotely operated the International Space Station’s robotic [[Canadarm2]] to extract the Roll Out Solar Array (ROSA) experiment from the SpaceX Dragon resupply ship. After the observation the mechanism was not planned to be retrieved back to earth. The solar array unfurled June 18, extending by tensioning booms on both sides of the 1.6-meter-wide wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Clark|first1=Stephen|title=Prototype solar array jettisoned as Dragon capsule prepares for trip home|url=https://spaceflightnow.com/2017/06/30/prototype-solar-array-jettisoned-as-dragon-capsule-prepares-for-trip-home/|accessdate=8 February 2018|publisher=SpaceFlightNow|date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA decided to conduct continuous tests for a week and observe its consequences. Engineers observed the behavior of the solar array as it was exposing it to extreme temperature swings through the ISS's orbit. Vibrations and oscillations were also mechanically introduced to assay the array’s response to structural loads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Samantha|first1=Mathewon|title=NASA Tests Flexible Roll-Out Solar Array on Space Station|url=https://www.space.com/37250-roll-out-solar-arrays-on-space-station.html|website=space.com|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent to the experiments, ground controllers were unable to lock the solar panel in its stowed configuration. The solar array was therefore jettisoned from the International Space Station.&lt;ref name="Jettison"&gt;{{cite web|title=Jettison of ROSA|url=https://www.space.com/37320-rosa-roll-out-solar-array-jettisoned.html|website=space.com|accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
ROSA being very compact in size and due to its large power generation capacity it is reliable for future missions and majorly for [[interplanetary spaceflight|interplanetary]] travels which need a huge amount of energy.

'''The Royd Moor [[wind farm|Wind Farm]]''' is located at [[Penistone]], [[Barnsley]], [[South Yorkshire]], [[England]], and consists of thirteen 500&amp;nbsp;kW [[wind turbine|turbines]]. The site is located approximately 6&amp;nbsp;km north west of [[Penistone]], above the [[A628 road|A628]] trunk road between [[Barnsley]] and [[Manchester]]. The turbines are set in two parallel, staggered rows of six and seven,&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8549">The method of screening has been linked to the early Egyptians who used the process to separate basic minerals by using a mesh that had equal openings. This idea fell down through the ages and developed into a series of European patents around 1924, when the thought of electrically heating the wire cloth for screens was considered. This was the first attempt at eliminating screen blinding (when the material being processed ([[clay]], [[dirt]], etc.) clogs the holes in the screen) by using heat, and it proved that the [[surface tension]] from blinding was reduced when heat was introduced.

The first commercially available screen heating system was developed in 1947 by F.R. Hannon &amp; Sons (now [[Hanco International]] ([http://www.hanco.com]), and Thomas W. Hannon obtained a patent for his electrically heated screen construction and method [http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=02812062&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft1.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D2,812,062.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F2,812,062%2526RS%3DPN%2F2,812,062&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page][http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=04148724&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft1.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO2%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-bool.html%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526co1%3DAND%2526d%3DPTXT%2526s1%3D%252522hannon%25253B%252BThomas%252BW%252522.INNM.%2526OS%3DIN%2F%2526RS%3D&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page][http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=02825461&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft1.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D2,825,461.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F2,825,461%2526RS%3DPN%2F2,825,461&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page][http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=03195725&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft1.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D3,195,725.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F3,195,725%2526RS%3DPN%2F3,195,725&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page]. This was just in time, as industries were beginning to expand in coming out of World War II. The first applications of the screen heating system were limited almost exclusively to the clay industry, though it did not take long for other applications, in a variety of industries, to be identified.

Another significant invention for screen heating was created by Thomas W. Hannon (for [[Hanco International]]). This was for screen-related clamp bars (also known as a Wedge Grip), that are used when mounting a screen on frame members. The clamp bars secured a screen to a tensioning rail, which in turn increased the [[electrical connection]] between the two components. ([http://patft1.uspto.gov])

In the years following, [[copper]] and copper cables were implemented in an attempt to improve the system. Silicon-bonded [[fiberglass]] was also added to the insulation of screen boxes. For a short period, flexible [[Shunt (electrical)|shunts]] were also used, but a major deficiency was found in attaching the stationary [[transformer]] to a screen that vibrated.




== The Invention of the Flux-Power Screen Heating System ==

In exploring ways to properly attach a transformer to a vibrating screen, [[Hanco International]] ([http://www.hanco.com]) pioneered the Flux-Power Screen Heating System [http://www.hanco.com/HancoScreenHeating.html]. The invention came to be in 1961, created by Thomas W. Hannon ([http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=03154757&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft1.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D3,154,757.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F3,154,757%2526RS%3DPN%2F3,154,757&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page]), and it was unlike anything of its time. The design eliminated the use of physical connections as seen in earlier screen heating systems. Omitting the mechanical connection also deletes the possibility of primary winding failures that come with [[short circuit]]s on the secondary of the transformer while eliminating wear and fatigue on the screen, itself. This design also allowed for the transformer to be encapsulated and protected from the elements and [[dust]].

When processing basic [[mineral deposits]] ([[clay]], [[shale]], [[limestone]], etc.), Flux-Powered Screen Heating Systems are ideal. Heating the screen lessens surface tension from moisture which is a main reason for stickiness against cloth mediums. Introducing heat allows maximum contact and keeps the screen clear, allowing finer material separations and more precise sizing. This, in turn, adds to efficiency.

Flux-Powered Screen Heating Systems have been used and proven effective in screening [[fertilizer]]s (in handling phosphoric, [[potash]] and [[sulfate]] rock), foods, chemicals, and in recovering coal for power.

[[File:Space Electric Vehicles and Habitat Demonstration Unit.jpg|thumb|The two rover prototypes docked to the Habitat Demonstration Unit during DesertRATS 2010]]
The '''Space Exploration Vehicle''' ('''SEV''') is a [[modular design|modular]] vehicle concept developed by [[NASA]]. It would consist of a pressurized cabin that can be mated either with a wheeled [[chassis]] to form a [[Rover (space exploration)|rover]] for planetary surface exploration (on the [[Moon]] and elsewhere) or to a flying platform for open space missions such as servicing satellites and missions to [[Near-Earth object|near-Earth asteroids]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/SEV.html NASA's Space Exploration Vehicle (SEV)]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept evolved from the '''Lunar Electric Rover''' (LER) concept, which in turn was a development of the '''Small Pressurized Rover''' (SPR) concept.&lt;ref name="drats-2008"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/analogs/desert_rats_2008.html |title=Three Days in the Desert Tests Lunar "RV" |publisher=NASA |date=December 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept vehicles of the Lunar Electric Rover (and later, the SEV) were tested during the [[Desert Research and Technology Studies]] in 2008,&lt;ref name="drats-2008"/&gt; 2009,&lt;ref name="drats-2009"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/analogs/desert_rats_2009.html |title=Desert RATS 2009 14-Day Analog Mission |publisher=NASA |date=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/analogs/desertrats/desert_rats_2010.html |title=Desert RATS 2010 Complete 13th Annual Field Test |publisher=NASA |date=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/analogs/desertrats/desert_rats_2011.html |title=Desert RATS 2011 |publisher=NASA |date=July 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/analogs/desertrats/drats2011_wrapup-report.html |title=Desert RATS 2011: Wrap-up Report |publisher=NASA |date=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/analogs/desertrats/dratskennedy.html |title=D-RATS Set Sights on Asteroid |publisher=NASA |date=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the LER concept vehicles took part in the [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|presidential inauguration parade of Barack Obama]] in 2009.

Development of the SEV has continued, producing variants called the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle (MMSEV) and in 2013 a cabin for a possible lunar lander called the Alternate MMSEV (AMMSEV).&lt;ref name=AMMSEV&gt;{{cite paper |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20140004223.pdf |title=An Alternate Configuration of the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle |publisher=NASA |first=Robert L. |last=Howard, Jr. |date=January 22, 2014 |id=JSC-CN-30087}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEV is developed together with other projects under the Advanced Explorations Systems Program. The program's budget for FY 2010 was $152.9 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.govbudgets.com/Program/Exploration_Systems/Exploration_Research_and_Development/Advanced_Explorations_Systems/ |title=NASA's Budget: Advanced Explorations Systems Program}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The SEV is the size of a small [[pickup truck]], it has 12 wheels, and can house two [[astronauts]] for up to two weeks.&lt;ref name="NASALER"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/exploration/home/LER.html |title=NASA's New Lunar Electric Rover (LER) |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEV consists of a [[chassis]] and [[Cabin (ship)|cabin]] module.&lt;ref name="LERFactSheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/284669main_LER_FactSheet_web.pdf |title=Lunar Electric Rover Concept |publisher=NASA |accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SEV will allow the attachment of tools such as cranes, cable reels, backhoes and [[winch]]es.&lt;ref name="LERFactSheet"/&gt; Designed for 2, this vehicle is capable of supporting 4 in an emergency.&lt;ref name="LERFactSheet"/&gt; With wheels that can pivot 360 degrees, the SEV is able to drive in any direction.&lt;ref name="LERFactSheet"/&gt; Astronauts can enter and exit without [[space suits]] directly from an airlock docking hatch, or through a [[suitport]] without the need to depressurize the habitat module.&lt;ref name="LERFactSheet"/&gt;

The pressurized module contains a small bathroom with privacy curtains and a shower head producing a water mist for sponge baths.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/lunar-rover5.htm |title=How Lunar Rovers Work |publisher=howstuffworks |accessdate=2009-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also contains cabinets for tools, workbench areas and two crew seats that can fold back into beds.&lt;ref name="howstuffworks"/&gt;

==Project info==
Sripada Yellampalli irrigation project foundation was laid by Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy on 28 July 2004.

The project is designed to utilize about 63 tmc of water at a cost of Rs. 900 crores in the first phase. In the second phase, about 49.5 tmc would be lifted to the upland regions of Karimnagar, Adilabad, Nizamabad, Warangal and Medak districts. 6 tmc water allotted for NTPC Ramagundam project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/07/29/stories/2004072907420400.htm|title=YSR lays stone for Yellampalli project|work=The Hindu|accessdate=15 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the flood gates are installed, the project could would store about 20 [[Tmcft]] of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/10/23/stories/2010102360170300.htm|title=White paper sought on Yellampalli |work=The Hindu|accessdate=15 September 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110084352/http://www.hindu.com/2010/10/23/stories/2010102360170300.htm|archivedate=10 November 2012|date=23 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project operational requirement is 163 [[Megawatt|MW]] power and 469 million [[KWh]] of electrical energy annually to pump the water.
The project would supply water for NTPC power project reservoir in [[Ramagundam]] Mandal in Karimnagar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/08/16/stories/2010081650970500.htm|title=Trial run for supply of water to NTPC in Nov. |work=The Hindu|accessdate=15 September 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203062852/http://www.hindu.com/2010/08/16/stories/2010081650970500.htm|archivedate=3 February 2011|date=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is started on 2005 near Mormoor and Yellampalli village at [[Ramagundam]] and its mainly supplying drinking water to [[Ramagundam]] city and [[Hyderabad]] city.

'''Tannins''' (or '''tannoids''') are a class of [[astringent]], [[polyphenol]]ic [[biomolecule]]s that bind to and [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitate]] [[protein]]s and various other organic compounds including [[amino acid]]s and [[alkaloid]]s.

The term ''tannin'' (from [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] ''tanner'', from [[Medieval Latin]] ''tannāre'', from ''tannum'', [[oak]] [[Bark (botany)|bark]]) refers to the use of oak and other bark in [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] animal [[Hide (skin)|hides]] into [[leather]]. By extension, the term ''tannin'' is widely applied to any large [[polyphenol]]ic compound containing sufficient [[hydroxyl]]s and other suitable groups (such as [[carboxyl]]s) to form strong complexes with various [[macromolecule]]s.

The tannin compounds are widely distributed in many species of plants, where they play a role in protection from [[predation]], and perhaps also as [[pesticides]], and might help in regulating plant growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Katie E. Ferrell |author2=Thorington, Richard W. |title=Squirrels: the animal answer guide |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |year=2006 |page=91 |isbn=0-8018-8402-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[astringency]] from the tannins is what causes the dry and puckery feeling in the mouth following the consumption of unripened fruit, red wine or tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=McGee, Harold |title=On food and cooking: the science and lore of the kitchen |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |year=2004 |page=714 |isbn=0-684-80001-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the destruction or modification of tannins with time plays an important role when determining harvesting times.

Tannins have [[molecular weight]]s ranging from 500 to over 3,000&lt;ref name="Bate-Smith"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bate-Smith and Swain |chapter=Flavonoid compounds |editor1=Florkin M. |editor2=Mason H.

== Structure and classes of tannins ==
There are three major classes of tannins: Shown below are the base unit or monomer of the tannin. Particularly in the flavone-derived tannins, the base shown must be (additionally) heavily hydroxylated and polymerized in order to give the high molecular weight [[polyphenol]] motif that characterizes tannins. Typically, tannin molecules require at least 12 hydroxyl groups and at least five phenyl groups to function as protein binders.&lt;ref name="ref 1"&gt;[http://pharmaxchange.info/notes/cognosy/tannins.html Notes on Tannins from PharmaXChange.info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104040231/http://pharmaxchange.info/notes/cognosy/tannins.html |date=4 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Ellagic acid]], [[gallic acid]], and [[pyrogallic acid]] were first discovered by chemist [[Henri Braconnot]] in 1831.&lt;ref name=Grasser&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/synthetictannins032496mbp|title=Synthetic Tannins|isbn=9781406773019|author1=Grasser|first1=Georg|year=1922|others=F.

At these times, molecule formulas were determined through [[combustion analysis]]. The discovery in 1943 by Martin and Synge of [[paper chromatography]] provided for the first time the means of surveying the phenolic constituents of plants and for their separation and identification. There was an explosion of activity in this field after 1945, including prominent work by [[Edgar Charles Bate-Smith]] and [[Tony Swain (chemist)|Tony Swain]] at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref name=Haslam&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haslam|first=Edwin|title=Vegetable tannins – Lessons of a phytochemical lifetime|journal=Phytochemistry|year=2007|issue=22–24|pages=2713–2721|doi=10.1016/j.phytochem.2007.09.009|pmid=18037145|volume=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Edwin Haslam]] proposed a first comprehensive definition of plant polyphenols based on the earlier proposals of Bate-Smith, Swain and Theodore White, which includes specific structural characteristics common to all phenolics having a tanning property. It is referred to as the White–Bate-Smith–Swain–Haslam (WBSSH) definition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Quideau|first=Stéphane|url=http://www.groupepolyphenols.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=53&amp;Itemid=59&amp;b528026c36a38313c3bc0e90a25fbe0c=7012a845601d61b99d4b8fbc24b709de|title=Why bother with Polyphenols|publisher=Groupe Polyphenols|date=22 September 2009|accessdate=21 August 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310221945/http://www.groupepolyphenols.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=53&amp;Itemid=59&amp;b528026c36a38313c3bc0e90a25fbe0c=7012a845601d61b99d4b8fbc24b709de|archivedate=10 March 2012|df=dmy-all}}{{Self-published inline|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Tannins are distributed in species throughout the [[plant kingdom]]. They are commonly found in both [[gymnosperm]]s as well as [[angiosperm]]s. Mole studied the distribution of tannin in 180 families of [[dicotyledon]]s and 44 families of [[monocotyledon]]s (Cronquist). Most families of dicot contain tannin-free species (tested by their ability to precipitate proteins). The best known families of which all species tested contain tannin are: [[Aceraceae]], [[Actinidiaceae]], [[Anacardiaceae]], [[Bixaceae]], [[Burseraceae]], [[Combretaceae]], [[Dipterocarpaceae]], [[Ericaceae]], [[Grossulariaceae]], [[Myricaceae]] for dicot and [[Najadaceae]] and [[Typhaceae]] in Monocot. To the family of the oak, [[Fagaceae]], 73% of the species tested (N = 22) contain tannin. For those of acacias, [[Mimosaceae]], only 39% of the species tested (N = 28) contain tannin, among [[Solanaceae]] rate drops to 6% and 4% for the [[Asteraceae]]. Some families like the [[Boraginaceae]], [[Cucurbitaceae]], [[Papaveraceae]] contain no tannin-rich species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Simon Mole |title=The Systematic Distribution of Tannins in the Leaves of Angiosperms: A Tool for Ecological Studies |journal=Biochemical Systematics and Ecology |volume=21 |issue=8 |pages=833–846 |year=1993|doi=10.1016/0305-1978(93)90096-A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most abundant polyphenols are the [[condensed tannin]]s, found in virtually all families of plants, and comprising up to 50% of the dry weight of leaves. Tannins of tropical woods tend to be of a cathetic nature rather than of the gallic type present in temperate woods.&lt;ref&gt;Tannin in Tropical Woods. Doat J, Bois. For Tmp., 1978, volume 182, pages 34-37&lt;/ref&gt;

There may be a loss in the bio-availability of still other tannins in plants due to birds, pests, and other pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Kadam, S. S. |author2=Salunkhe, D. K. |author3=Chavan, J. K. |title=Dietary tannins: consequences and remedies |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |year=1990 |page=177 |isbn=0-8493-6811-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Localization in plant organs ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Tannins are found in leaf, bud, seed, root, and stem tissues. An example of the location of the tannins in stem tissue is that they are often found in the growth areas of trees, such as the secondary phloem and xylem and the layer between the cortex and epidermis. Tannins may help regulate the growth of these tissues.

=== Cellular localization ===
In all vascular plants studied so far, tannins are manufactured by a [[chloroplast]]-derived [[organelle]], the [[tannosome]].&lt;ref&gt;"The tannosome is an organelle forming condensed tannins in the chlorophyllous organs of Tracheophyta". Jean-Marc Brillouet, Charles Romieu, Benoît Schoefs, Katalin Solymosi, Véronique Cheynier, Hélène Fulcrand, Jean-Luc Verdeil and Geneviève Conéjéro, Annals of Botany, September 11, 2013, {{doi|10.1093/aob/mct168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tannins are mainly physically located in the [[vacuole]]s or surface wax of plants. These storage sites keep tannins active against plant predators, but also keep some tannins from affecting plant metabolism while the plant tissue is alive; it is only after cell breakdown and death that the tannins are active in metabolic effects.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Tannins are classified as [[ergastic substance]]s, i.e., non-protoplasm materials found in cells. Tannins, by definition, precipitate proteins. In this condition, they must be stored in organelles able to withstand the protein precipitation process. [[Idioblast]]s are isolated plant cells which differ from neighboring tissues and contain non-living substances. They have various functions such as storage of reserves, excretory materials, pigments, and minerals. They could contain oil, latex, gum, resin or pigments etc. They also can contain tannins. In Japanese persimmon (''[[Diospyros kaki]]'') fruits, tannin is accumulated in the vacuole of tannin cells, which are idioblasts of parenchyma cells in the flesh.&lt;ref&gt;Identification of Molecular Markers Linked to the Trait of Natural Astringency Loss of Japanese Persimmon (''Diospyros kaki'') Fruit. Shinya Kanzaki, Keizo Yonemori and Akira Sugiura, ''J. Amer. Soc. Hort. Sci.'', 2001, 126(1), pages 51–55 ([http://journal.ashspublications.org/content/126/1/51.full.pdf+html article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904065618/http://journal.ashspublications.org/content/126/1/51.full.pdf+html |date=4 September 2015 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presence in soils ===
{{see also|Soil pH}}
The [[convergent evolution]] of tannin-rich plant communities has occurred on nutrient-poor acidic soils throughout the world. Tannins were once believed to function as anti-herbivore defenses, but more and more ecologists now recognize them as important controllers of decomposition and nitrogen cycling processes. As concern grows about global warming, there is great interest to better understand the role of polyphenols as regulators of carbon cycling, in particular in northern boreal forests.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Leaf litter and other decaying parts of kauri (''[[Agathis australis]]''), a tree species found in New Zealand, decompose much more slowly than those of most other species. Besides its acidity, the plant also bears substances such as waxes and phenols, most notably tannins, that are harmful to [[microorganism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Verkaik, Anne G. Jongkindet, Frank Berendse "Short-term and long-term effects of tannins on nitrogen mineralisation and litter decomposition in kauri (''Agathis australis'' (D. Don) Lindl.) forests".  ''Plant And Soil'' 2006; Volume 287, Numbers 1–2, pages 337–345 {{doi|10.1007/s11104-006-9081-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Presence in water and wood ===
The [[Leaching (chemistry)|leaching]] of highly [[water]] [[Solubility|soluble]] tannins from decaying vegetation and leaves along a stream may produce what is known as a [[blackwater river]]. Water flowing out of [[bog]]s has a characteristic brown color from dissolved [[peat]] tannins. The presence of tannins (or [[humic acid]]) in [[Water well|well water]] can make it smell bad or taste bitter, but this does not make it unsafe to drink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ns.ca/nse/water/docs/droponwaterFAQ_HumicSubstances.pdf Tannins, lignins and humic acids in well water on www.gov.ns.ca] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130517071315/http://www.gov.ns.ca/nse/water/docs/droponwaterFAQ_HumicSubstances.pdf |date=17 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tannins leaching from an unprepared driftwood decoration in an aquarium can cause pH lowering and coloring of the water to a tea-like tinge. A way to avoid this is to boil the [[wood]] in water several times, discarding the water each time. Using peat as an [[Substrate (aquarium)|aquarium substrate]] can have the same effect. Many hours of boiling the driftwood may need to be followed by many weeks or months of constant soaking and many water changes before the water will stay clear. Adding [[Sodium bicarbonate|baking soda]] to the water to raise its [[pH level]] will accelerate the process of leaching, as the more [[Alkalinity|alkaline]] solution can draw out [[tannic acid]] from the wood faster than the pH-neutral water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aqualifesupport.com/getArticle.php?ArtID=413 Preparing Driftwood for Your Freshwater Aquarium] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707154303/http://www.aqualifesupport.com/getArticle.php?ArtID=413 |date=7 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Softwood]]s, while in general much lower in tannins than hardwoods,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/lgx433067q0nj328/|title=Polyflavonoid tannins ? a main cause of soft-rot failure in CCA-treated timber|first1=A.|last1=Pizzi|first2=W.

== Extraction ==
There is no single protocol for [[Extraction (chemistry)|extracting]] tannins from all plant material. The procedures used for tannins are widely variable.&lt;ref name=Hagerman1988&gt;''The Tannin Handbook'', Ann E. Hagerman, 1988 ([http://www.users.muohio.edu/hagermae/ book] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128054221/http://www.users.muohio.edu/hagermae/ |date=28 January 2014 }})&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that [[acetone]] in the extraction solvent increases the total yield by inhibiting interactions between tannins and [[protein]]s during extraction&lt;ref name=Hagerman1988/&gt; or even by breaking hydrogen bonds between tannin-protein complexes.&lt;ref&gt;"Condensed tannins". Porter L. J., 1989, in ''Natural Products of Woody Plants I'', Rowe J. W. (ed), Springer-Verlag: Berlin, Germany, pages 651–690&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tests for tannins ==
There are three groups of methods for the analysis of tannins: precipitation of proteins or alkaloids, reaction with phenolic rings, and depolymerization.&lt;ref&gt;Quantitative Methods for the Estimation of Tannins in Plant Tissues. Augustin Scalbert, Plant Polyphenols, Basic Life Sciences, 1992, Volume 59, pages 259-280, {{doi|10.1007/978-1-4615-3476-1_15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alkaloid precipitation ===
Alkaloids such as [[caffeine]], [[cinchonine]], [[quinine]] or [[strychnine]], precipitates polyphenols and tannins. This property can be used in a quantitation method.&lt;ref&gt;Plant Polyphenols: Synthesis, Properties, Significance. Richard W. Hemingway, Peter E. Laks, Susan J. Branham (page 263)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goldbeater's skin test ===
When [[goldbeater's skin]] or ox skin is dipped in [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]], rinsed in water, soaked in the tannin solution for 5 minutes, washed in water, and then treated with 1% [[Iron(II) sulfate|FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] solution, it gives a blue black color if tannin was present.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

=== Ferric chloride test ===
[[Ferric chloride test|Use of ferric chloride (FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) test]]s for [[natural phenol|phenolics]] in general. Powdered plant leaves of the test plant (1.0&amp;nbsp;g) are weighed into a beaker and 10&amp;nbsp;ml of distilled water are added. The mixture is boiled for five minutes. Two drops of 5% FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are then added. Production of a greenish precipitate was an indication of the presence of tannins.&lt;ref&gt;"Antibacterial activity of leave extracts of ''Nymphaea lotus'' (Nymphaeaceae) on Methicillin resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|MRSA]]) and Vancomycin resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' (VRSA) isolated from clinical samples".

O., ''Annals of Biological Research'', 2010, 1 (2), pages 174–184&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a portion of the water extract is diluted with distilled water in a ratio of 1:4 and few drops of 10% ferric chloride solution is added. A blue or green color indicates the presence of tannins (Evans, 1989).&lt;ref&gt;"Phytochemical Analysis and Antimicrobial Activity Of ''Scoparia dulcis'' and ''Nymphaea lotus''".

;Hide-powder method
400&amp;nbsp;mg of sample tannins are dissolved in 100&amp;nbsp;ml of distilled water. 3&amp;nbsp;g of slightly chromated hide-powder previously dried in vacuum for 24h over CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are added and the mixture stirred for 1 h at ambient temperature. The suspension is filtered without vacuum through a sintered glass filter. The weight gain of the hide-powder expressed as a percentage of the weight of the starting material is equated to the percentage of tannin in the sample.

;Stiasny's method
100&amp;nbsp;mg of sample tannins are dissolved in 10&amp;nbsp;ml distilled water. 1&amp;nbsp;ml of 10M HCl and 2&amp;nbsp;ml of 37% formaldehyde are added and the mixture heated under reflux for 30 min. The reaction mixture is filtered while hot through a sintered glass filter. The precipitate is washed with hot water (5× 10&amp;nbsp;ml) and dried over CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The yield of tannin is expressed as a percentage of the weight of the starting material.

=== Reaction with phenolic rings ===
The bark tannins of ''[[Commiphora angolensis]]'' have been revealed by the usual color and precipitation reactions and by quantitative determination by the methods of Löwenthal-Procter and of Deijs&lt;ref name=Cardoso&gt;Chemical study of bark from Commiphora angolensis Engl. Cardoso Do Vale, J., Bol Escola Farm Univ Coimbra Edicao Cient, 1962, volume 3, page 128 ([http://eurekamag.com/research/024/318/chemical-study-bark-commiphora-angolensis-engl.php abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607001810/http://eurekamag.com/research/024/318/chemical-study-bark-commiphora-angolensis-engl.php |date=7 June 2014 }})&lt;/ref&gt; ([[formalin]]-[[hydrochloric acid]] method).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Deijs |first1=W.

Colorimetric methods have existed such as the Neubauer-Löwenthal method which uses [[potassium permanganate]] as an oxidizing agent and [[Indigo dye|indigo]] [[sulfate]] as an indicator, originally proposed by Löwenthal in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Löwenthal |first1=J. |title=Ueber die Bestimmung des Gerbstoffs |journal=Zeitschrift für Analytische Chemie |date=December 1877 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=33–48 |doi=10.1007/BF01355993|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty is that the establishing of a titer for tannin is not always convenient since it is extremely difficult to obtain the pure tannin. Neubauer proposed to remove this difficulty by establishing the titer not with regard to the tannin but with regard to crystallised [[oxalic acid]], whereby he found that 83&amp;nbsp;g oxalic acid correspond to 41.20&amp;nbsp;g tannin. Löwenthal's method has been criticized. For instance, the amount of indigo used is not sufficient to retard noticeably the oxidation of the non-tannins substances. The results obtained by this method are therefore only comparative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spiers |first1=C.

==== Fruit juices ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2017}}
Although citrus fruits do not themselves contain tannins, orange-colored juices often contain food dyes with tannins. Apple juice, grape juices and berry juices are all high in tannins. Sometimes tannins are even added to juices and ciders to create a more astringent feel to the taste.

==== Beer ====
In addition to the [[alpha acid]]s extracted from [[hops]] to provide bitterness in [[beer]], condensed tannins are also present. These originate both from the malt and hops. Especially in Germany, trained brewmasters consider the presence of tannins as a flaw. In some styles, the presence of this astringency is acceptable or even desired, as, for example, in a [[Flanders red ale]].{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

In lager type beers, the tannins can form a precipitate with specific haze-forming proteins in the beer resulting in turbidity at low temperature. This chill haze can be prevented by removing part of the tannins or part of the haze-forming proteins. Tannins are removed using [[Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone|PVPP]], haze-forming proteins by using [[silica]] or tannic acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.natural-specialities.com/natural-specialities/PDF/Applications/BR02%20overview%20fact%20sheet%20version%202.1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714155948/http://www.natural-specialities.com/natural-specialities/PDF/Applications/BR02%20overview%20fact%20sheet%20version%202.1.pdf |archivedate=14 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Properties for animal nutrition ==
Tannins have traditionally been considered [[Antinutrient|antinutritional]], but it is now known that their beneficial or antinutritional properties depend upon their chemical structure and dosage. The new technologies used to analyze molecular and chemical structures have shown that a division into condensed and hydrolyzable tannins is too simplistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Muller-Harvey I. |author2=McAllan A. B. |title=Tannins: Their biochemistry and nutritional properties |journal=Adv. Plant Cell Biochem. Biotechnol. |volume=1 |pages=151–217 |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have demonstrated that products containing [[chestnut]] tannins included at low dosages (0.15–0.2%) in the diet of chickens may be beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Schiavone A. |author2=Guo K. |author3=Tassone S. |title=Effects of a natural extract of chestnut wood on digestibility, performance traits, and nitrogen balance of broiler chicks |journal=Poult.

Some studies suggest that chestnut tannins have positive effects on [[silage]] quality in the [[Baler#Silage or haylage bales|round bale silages]], in particular reducing [[Non-protein nitrogen|NPN]]s (non protein nitrogen) in the lowest wilting level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Tabacco E. |author2=Borreani G. |author3=Crovetto G.

Condensed tannins inhibit herbivore digestion by binding to consumed plant proteins and making them more difficult for animals to digest, and by interfering with protein absorption and digestive enzymes (for more on that topic, see [[plant defense against herbivory]]). Many tannin-consuming animals secrete a tannin-binding protein ([[mucin]]) in their saliva. Tannin-binding capacity of salivary mucin is directly related to its proline content. Salivary [[proline-rich protein]]s (PRPs) are sometimes used to inactivate tannins. One reason is that they inactivate tannins to a greater extent than do dietary proteins resulting in reduced fecal nitrogen losses. PRPs additionally contain non-specific nitrogen and non-essential amino acids making them more convenient than valuable dietary protein.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

[[Histatin]]s, another type of [[salivary protein]]s, also precipitate tannins from solution,  thus preventing alimentary adsorption.&lt;ref&gt;Salivary proteins as a defense against dietary tannins. Shimada T. Journal of Chemical Ecology 2006 Jun;32(6):1149-63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tannin production began at the beginning of the 19th century with the industrial revolution, to produce tanning material for the need for more leather. Before that time, processes used plant material and were long (up to six months).{{cn|date=October 2017}}

There was a collapse in the vegetable tannin market in the 1950s–1960s, due to the appearance of [[synthetic tannin]]s, which were invented in response to a scarcity of vegetable tannins during World War II. At that time, many small tannin industry sites closed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iufro.org/download/file/2480/95/10700-mangrove-ecosystems.doc "The Status of Mangrove Ecosystems: Trends in the Utilisation and Management of Mangrove Resources". D. Macintosh and S. Zisman]{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetable tannins are estimated to be used for the production of 10–20% of the global leather production.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The cost of the final product depends on the method used to extract the tannins, in particular the use of solvents, alkali and other chemicals used (for instance [[Glycerite|glycerin]]). For large quantities, the most cost-effective method is [[hot water extraction]].

[[Tannic acid]] is used worldwide as clarifying agent in alcoholic drinks and as aroma ingredient in both alcoholic and soft drinks or juices. Tannins from different botanical origins also find extensive uses in the wine industry.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

=== Uses ===

Tannins are an important ingredient in the process of tanning leather. [[Tanbark]] from [[oak]], [[mimosa]], chestnut and [[quebracho tree]] has traditionally been the primary source of [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] tannin, though inorganic [[Leather tanning|tanning agents]] are also in use today and account for 90% of the world's leather production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Marion Kite |author2=Roy Thomson |title=Conservation of leather and related materials |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=62zZy2B4ehQC |year=2006 |publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann |isbn=978-0-7506-4881-3 |page=23 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216170048/https://books.google.com/books?id=62zZy2B4ehQC |archivedate=16 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tannins produce different colors with [[ferric chloride]] (either blue, blue black, or green to greenish-black) according to the type of tannin. [[Iron gall ink]] is produced by treating a solution of tannins with [[iron(II) sulfate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lemay|first1=Marie-France|title=Iron Gall Ink|url=https://travelingscriptorium.library.yale.edu/2013/03/21/iron-gall-ink/|website=Traveling Scriptorium: A Teaching Kit|publisher=Yale University|accessdate=18 January 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215082127/https://travelingscriptorium.library.yale.edu/2013/03/21/iron-gall-ink/|archivedate=15 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tannin is a component in a type of industrial [[particleboard]] [[adhesive]] developed jointly by the Tanzania Industrial Research and Development Organization and Forintek Labs Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0958-9465(02)00072-0 |author1=Bisanda E.

[[Condensed tannin]]s, e.g., quebracho tannin, and [[Hydrolyzable tannin]]s, e.g., chestnut tannin, appear to be able to substitute a high proportion of synthetic phenol in phenol-formaldehyde resins for wood [[particleboard]].{{cn|date=October 2017}}

Tannins can be used for production of anti-[[corrosion|corrosive]] primer, sold under brand-name "Nox Primer" for treatment of rusted steel surfaces prior to painting, rust converter to transform oxidized steel into a smooth sealed surface and rust inhibitor.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The use of [[resin]]s made of tannins has been investigated to remove [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[methylmercury]] from solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Torres J. |author2=Olivares S. |author3=De La Rosa D. |author4=Lima L. |author5=Martínez F. |author6=Munita C.

'''UniStar Nuclear Energy''' is a wholly owned subsidiary of EDF ([[Électricité de France]]), formed in 2007 to develop new nuclear energy facilities in the United States.

'''Unistar''' has one project under development, Calvert Cliffs Unit 3 in Maryland - the reference plant for the [[Areva]], U.S. EPR design. The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] is currently reviewing UniStar's Combined License (COL) application for this facility. UniStar is also assisting [[PPL Corporation]] with the development of their Bell Bend Unit 1 project, which is also a U.S. EPR design.

Created in 2005 by [[Constellation Energy]] and [[Areva]], '''UniStar Nuclear''' became '''UniStar Nuclear Energy''' in August 2007 - a joint  venture by [[Constellation Energy]] and [[Électricité de France|EDF]]. In 2010, [[Électricité de France|EDF]] acquired 100 percent of UniStar Nuclear Energy.

In 2008, UniStar also submitted a Combined Operating License Application for a new nuclear unit in Oswego NY, to be named Nine Mile Point Unit 3. UniStar failed to acquire the land rights from Constellation Energy (and other parties) and subsequently terminated the NMP3 project in 2013.

In February 2014, after significant staff reductions the prior year, UniStar vacated its Baltimore MD office and moved remaining staff to the EDF North America Headquarters in Chevy Chase MD.

UniStar continues to pursue the a COL for the Calvert Cliffs Unit 3 project, however continued delays by AREVA to obtain the U.S. NRC approval of the U.S. EPR design (i.e. Design Certification) have delayed the project.

The '''Special Envoy for Eurasian Energy''' is a diplomatic position within the [[United States Department of State]]. The [[envoy (title)|envoy]] is "engage directly with senior [[Europe]]an, [[Central Asian]], [[Russia]]n and other political and business leaders to support the continued development and diversification of the [[energy]] sector."&lt;ref name=white&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/03/20080331-3.html Statement by the Press Secretary - March 31, 2008] The White House&lt;/ref&gt;  The position is currently filled by [[Richard Morningstar]].

==C. Boyden Gray==
The legislation calling for the position was drafted in 2007.  In February 2008, responding to questions on the issue at a briefing before the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations|Senate Foreign Relations Committee]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] reaffirmed that the State Department was looking to appoint a special energy coordinator for the Central Asian and [[Caspian region]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.america.gov/st/texttrans-english/2008/February/20080213182036eaifas0.4781916.html Rice's Opening Remarks at Senate Foreign Relations Committee] America.gov&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/080213/rice_energy.html Rice: US Naming Special Energy Envoy] Yahoo! Finance&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thomas R. Pickering]] was reportedly high on the list, but he withdrew himself from consideration in early 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurasianet.org/departments/insight/articles/eav012908a.shtml US Diplomats Set Their Sights On Turkmenistan's Berdymukhamedov] Eurasianet&lt;/ref&gt;  On 31 March 2008 the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] named [[C. Boyden Gray]] as the first envoy to this position.&lt;ref name=white/&gt;

On 14 November 2008, Gray became part of the presidential delegation assigned to attend the [[Baku Energy Summit]] in [[Baku]], [[Oil industry in Azerbaijan|Azerbaijan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/11/20081110-6.html Personnel Announcement], a November 10, 2008 [[White House]] news release&lt;/ref&gt;  The delegation also included [[Ambassadors of the United States|Ambassador to Azerbaijan]] [[Anne E. Derse]] and [[United States Secretary of Energy|Secretary of Energy]] [[Samuel Bodman]]. After change of the United States Administration, Gray resigned from this position on 20 January 2009.

==Richard Morningstar==
[[Richard Morningstar|Richard L. Morningstar]] was named to the position on 20 April 2009.  He led the United States delegation to the energy conference in Sofia on 24–25 April 2009.&lt;ref name=reuters260409&gt;

'''White gas''' is a common name for a number of flammable substances:

#As a generic term for camp stove and lantern fuel, its most popular current usage
#Pure [[gasoline]] (without additives), commonly used when leaded gasoline was the norm to prevent fouling in situations where the properties of the lead additive were not required
#[[Fuel dyes|Un-dyed]] gasoline

White gas should not be confused with '''[[white spirit]]''', which is more akin to [[kerosene]].
