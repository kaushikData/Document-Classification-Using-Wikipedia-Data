'''Anatoly Yemelianovich Slivko''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: Анатолий Емельянович Сливко; December 28, 1938 – September 16, 1989) was a [[USSR|Soviet]] [[serial killer]], convicted of the killing of 7 people in and around [[Nevinnomyssk]] between 1964 and 1985.

Over a two decade-long period, Slivko [[molested]] young boys at his youth club after tricking them into [[unconsciousness]], killing some of them in an attempt to recreate the violent death of a teenage boy he had witnessed in 1961, which had [[sexual arousal|sexually aroused]] him.

Slivko was [[Capital punishment in the Soviet Union|executed]] by [[Execution by shooting#Soviet Bloc|shooting]] on 16 September 1989.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunting The Devil'' pp. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Anatoly Yemelianovich Slivko was born on 28 December 1938 in [[Izerbash]], [[Dagestan ASSR]], [[Soviet Union]]. Slivko lived in [[Stavropol]] and was a married father of two children, although he had known since the onset of puberty that his sexual orientation had been homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, Slivko witnessed a traffic accident in which a drunken motorcyclist had swerved into a group of pedestrians, fatally injuring a boy in his early teens who was wearing a [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Young Pioneers]] uniform.&lt;ref&gt;''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; For reasons Slivko would later insist he never could explain, this scene had sexually excited him. He later recalled the accident vividly: "The boy had experienced [[Convulsion|convulsions]] in his death throes as the smell of gasoline and fire permeated the air."&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1963, Slivko exploited his position at the children's club he ran to relive the fantasies of this accident.&lt;ref&gt;''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Once or twice a year, he would form a close friendship with a boy who was usually aged between 12 and 15 and never older than 17.{{refn|group=n|Following his arrest, Slivko stated to investigators he never selected a youth older than 17 both because the boy killed in the 1961 traffic accident which had sparked his fantasies had been in his early teens, and out of concerns regarding the victim's physical strength.&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;}} The boy would be short for his age and would be wearing the Young Pioneers uniform - just like the boy Slivko had seen die in the traffic accident. Slivko would gain the boy's confidence and tell him of an experiment he knew which involved a controlled hanging into [[unconsciousness]], to stretch the [[Vertebral column|spine]], after which, the boy was assured, Slivko would revive him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to each boy undertaking this "experiment", Slivko would purchase a new uniform for the victim to wear and shine his shoes. In addition, to prevent [[vomiting]], the victim was required not to eat for several hours before the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;''Born to Kill in the USSR'' [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qX0gAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA325&amp;dq=Born+to+Kill+in+the+USSR&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAGoVChMIwq-XvcDtyAIVgi4aCh1mFA6o#v=onepage&amp;q=slivko&amp;f=false p. 67]&lt;/ref&gt; Once the boy was unconscious, Slivko would strip him naked, caress and fondle him, take films in which he would arrange the body in suggestive positions, and [[masturbate]].

== Murders ==
Over the course of 22 years, Slivko persuaded 43 boys to take part in this contrived experiment. In 36 cases, following his established ritual of [[photography]], filming, and repeated masturbation, Slivko revived these boys. Cautioned by Slivko into silence, these individuals resumed their lives unaware of what had happened to them whilst they had been unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; However, in seven cases, Slivko's behavior became violent: once these victims were unconscious, he [[dismembered]] their bodies, poured [[gasoline]] on their limbs and torso, and set the remains on fire to remind himself of the traffic accident which had sparked his arousal.

Slivko typically retained the victim's shoes as a memento. As with his surviving victims, he both photographed and filmed the entire process, and with both the boys he subsequently revived and his murder victims,&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; he would take the films and photographs he had taken of the entire process to his home and subsequently develop these materials in a home laboratory.&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' p. 132&lt;/ref&gt;

The pictures and films served as stimuli for Slivko's masturbatory fantasies for months or years until he needed fresher stimuli and killed again.&lt;ref&gt;''Hunting the Devil'' p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 1964, Slivko killed his first victim, a 15-year-old runaway boy named Nikolai Dobryshev.&lt;ref&gt;''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Slivko claimed this particular victim was killed unintentionally, being unable to revive Dobryshev once he was unconscious. He dismembered the boy's body and [[Burial|buried]] him, also destroying the film and photographs he had taken of this particular victim. In May, 1965, Slivko killed his second victim, Aleksei Kovalenko. Slivko began operating a club for boys named ''Chergid'' in 1966, after his first club had been destroyed in a fire.

Eight years later, on November 14, 1973, a 15-year-old boy named Aleksander Nesmeyanov disappeared in [[Nevinnomyssk]]. Two years later, on May 11, 1975, an 11-year-old boy named Andrei Pogasyan disappeared. Pogasyan's mother told the police that a man had made some video recordings in a nearby forest and that her son was going to participate, but the police didn't do anything to prevent this because they knew Slivko and that he had won awards for some of his videos. In the winter of 1975, a prison inmate claimed he knew where Aleksander Nesmeyanov was buried, but the police searched the area and found nothing, proving the claim was false. In 1980, a 13-year-old boy named Sergei Fatsiev, who along with Nesmeyanov and Pogasyan was a member of Chergid, disappeared. The next victim was a fifteen-year-old named Vyacheslav Khovistik, who was killed in 1982.

On July 23, 1985, Slivko killed his final victim, a 13-year-old boy named Sergei Pavlov, who disappeared after telling a neighbor he was going to meet the leader of Chergid.

== Arrest and execution ==
In November 1985, a [[prosecutor]] Tamara Languyeva (Russian: Тамара Лангуева), investigating the disappearance of Sergei Pavlov, took an interest in the Chergid club's activities. However, she had no evidence that there was anything illegal in the way the club was run. The prosecutor interrogated many boys who had been to the club, who said they had suffered “temporary [[amnesia]]”, and that Slivko had practiced many experiments with them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1tv.ru/sprojects_edition/si5937/fi26843&lt;/ref&gt; Following a long inquiry, Anatoly Slivko was arrested at his Stavropol home in December 1985. He would later be formally accused of seven murders, seven counts of [[sexual abuse]], and seven counts of [[necrophilia]]. In January and February 1986, Slivko led investigators to the whereabouts of the bodies of six of his victims, although he was unable to locate the body of his first victim. In June 1986, he was [[death penalty|sentenced to death]]. He was held on [[death row]] in [[Novocherkassk]] prison for three years.

In 1989, he was asked by the police to help arrest a then-unidentified serial killer in of the [[Rostov oblast]] who had a killed a minimum of 29 victims by the time of this interview.&lt;ref&gt;''The Worst People in History'' p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Although Slivko did provide some insight into how offenders such as himself were able to function, much of the actual advice he provided to police would prove to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;''The Killer Department'' pp. 133-134&lt;/ref&gt; The then-unidentified serial killer, [[Andrei Chikatilo]], was arrested in 1990 and would be convicted of killing 52 women and children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&amp;dat=19921015&amp;id=rrE0AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qn0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4816,1957003&amp;hl=en/|title=Soviet serial killer is sentenced to life term|publisher=The Prescott Courier|date=15 October 1992|access-date=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 1989, just hours after he was interviewed by the police, Anatoly Slivko was [[death penalty|executed]] by [[Execution by shooting|shooting]].&lt;ref&gt;''Born to Kill in the USSR'' p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Lieutenant General '''Apparanda Chengappa Aiyappa''' [[MBE]] (also known as A.C. Iyappa) was a [[World War II]] hero and the first Indian Signal officer in chief (Head of the [[Indian Army Corps of Signals]]).  He was also the first chief of the [[Bharat Electronics Limited]] (BEL).

==Early years==
Iyappa was born on 2 September 1913 &lt;ref&gt;Indian Amy List October 1939 page 221F&lt;/ref&gt; during the [[British Raj]], into the wealthy and influential Apparanda family which belonged to the [[Kodava people|Kodava]] community of [[Kodagu]]. He studied in [[Bishop Cotton Boys' School]], [[Bangalore]] and later in [[Stamford School]], Lincolnshire in [[England]]. After college he went on to join the [[Indian Military Academy]] and from there got a commission into the [[British Indian Army]].

== Brief history of Signals in India ==
At the turn of the 20th century there was no organised signal service in existence in India. As far back as 1857, there is a record of a signals service in India, though it was not until 1911, as a result of the recommendations of Headlam Committee in 1910, that Signals in India came into being on a separate establishment under the auspices of the Corps of Sappers and Miners. The Corps was raised with a signal company for each division and a nucleus of a wireless company for the line of communication.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Other/227-Corps-Of-Signals.html Corps Of Signals, Indian Army] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115042705/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/LAND-FORCES/Units/Other/227-Corps-Of-Signals.html |date=15 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the recommendation of various committees, two Divisional Signals Companies (31 and 32) under Northern Army, were raised on 15 February 1911 at Fatehgarh, with Lieutenant Colonel S H Powell being conferred Commandant Designate. Two more Signal Coy (33 and 34) under Southern Army at Ahmednagar and One Wireless Company (40) at Roorkee, were raised on 1 March 1911. 
Composition of each Divisional Signal Company: 
:British Officer: 5
:Indian Officer: 2
:Soldier Rank (British): 44
:Soldier Rank (Indian): 78

When the post World War I re-organization of the Indian Army was carried out, the Indian Signals Corps was formed as a separate corps on 17 April 1920.

On India attaining independence in 1947, the Corps was completely Indianised and on 26 January 1950, on India attaining full sovereignty, the Indian Signal Corps was redesignated as the [[Indian army#Regimental organisation|Corps of Signals]]. It is presently stationed at [[Jabalpur]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdajabalpur.nic.in/cos.htm Controller of Defence Accounts, Jabalpur] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203232328/http://cdajabalpur.nic.in/cos.htm |date=3 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military career ==
On 7 July 1935 he was commissioned from [[Indian Military Academy]] on to the Indian Land Forces, Special List and on 12 August 1935 he was attached to the 1st battalion 7th Rajput Regiment and the Indian Signal Corps. He was promoted Lieutenant, Indian Land Forces, Special List on 2 December 1936. He was appointed to the Indian Army 23 November 1937. In early 1939 he was permanently appointed to the Indian Signal Corps.&lt;ref&gt;Indian Army list (various issues between 1936 - 1939)&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
As a Captain he saw action in the [[Malayan Campaign]] in 1941 against the Japanese in [[World War II]] as Commander of a Signals Company under the [[6th Indian Infantry Brigade]]. He was held as a [[Prisoner of War|prisoner of war]] and mistreated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epaper.timesofindia.com/Default/Scripting/ArticleWin.asp?From=Archive&amp;Source=Page&amp;Skin=TOINEW&amp;BaseHref=TOIBG/2010/10/31&amp;PageLabel=6&amp;EntityId=Ar00600&amp;ViewMode=HTML&amp;GZ=T ''Times of India'']&lt;/ref&gt; He was awarded the [[MBE]] (Member of the Order of the British Empire) in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/37558/supplements/2209&lt;/ref&gt; After independence, he was promoted to Colonel and became Commander of the Signals Regiment under the [[4th Infantry Division (India)|4th Infantry Division]] stationed in the forward areas of Punjab. Iyappa later became the Director of Signals and Signal Officer-in-Chief in 1954 as a Major General. He was the first Indian Signal officer in chief; he became the Master General of Ordnance in the rank of Lt General, and was also the first Indian to be Colonel Commandant of the Corps of Signals.  Afterwards he was deputed to [[Bharat Electronics Limited]] (BEL) where he became chairman and held the post until 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coorgcreek.com/famouscoorgs.htm Famous Coorgs]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bharat Electronics Limited ==
Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) was set up at Bangalore, by the Government of India under the Ministry of Defence in 1954 to meet the specialised electronic needs of the [[Indian Defence Services]]. Over the years, it has grown into a multi-product, multi-technology, multi-unit company serving the needs of customers in diverse fields in India and abroad. BEL is among an elite group of public sector undertakings which have been conferred the Navratna status by the Government of India. When it was first set up, the Government of India made Iyappa its first chairman; he remained in this position for 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bel-india.com/index.aspx BEL India web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
Today there is a park named after him (General Iyappa Park) near BEL circle in Bangalore.&lt;ref&gt;[http://maps.google.co.in/maps?hl=en&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=541&amp;q=iyappa+park&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wl Google map]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Berta Hoerner Hader''' (August 1, 1890 – February 6, 1976) and '''Elmer Stanley Hader''' (September 7, 1889 – September 7, 1973) were an [[American people|American]] couple who jointly illustrated more than 70 [[children's books]], about half of which they also wrote. They won the annual [[Caldecott Medal]] for ''[[The Big Snow]]'' (1948), recognizing the year's "most distinguished American picture book for children".

==Biography==
Berta Hoerner was born in [[San Pedro, Coahuila]], [[Mexico]], where her parents Albert and Adelaide unsuccessfully tried to grow cotton with Albert's brother. The family moved 100&amp;nbsp;km to the east, to the resort town of [[Parras]], Mexico, when Berta was three, then soon-after to [[Amarillo, Texas]], where her father ran a grocery store. Her father died when Berta was five, and the family soon moved to the northeast of the United States. Berta, perhaps inspired by her mother's colorful sketches of Mexican life, took art classes and read extensively while still in elementary school, winning literary and artistic prizes for her work. The family again moved in 1909, this time to Seattle, Washington. While Berta's mother worked for [[Charity Organization Society]] and Washington's Home, Berta continued painting and reading, and eventually attended the [[University of Washington]] School of Journalism (1909–1912). She also apprenticed at Western Engraving Company, where she learned printing design, fashion design, illustration, and printing skills. Berta's supervisor, Eva Shepard, moved to San Francisco, and handed over her fashion work in Seattle to Berta. When Ms. Shepard then took a position in New York, Ms. Shepard asked Berta to take over her free-lance fashion illustration business in San Francisco. Berta agreed and, to further her training, she spent the summer of 1915 attending art school in Carmel, California. In the fall she moved to San Francisco, took over Eva Shepard's fashion illustration work, and attended the [[California School of Design]], where she studies from 1915-1918. While in San Francisco, Berta befriended [[Rose Wilder Lane]] (daughter of then-unknown writer Laura Ingalls Wilder), with whom she later rented a Telegraph Hill studio (1413 Montgomery Street). Berta first met her future husband Elmer at this studio. Berta had also befriended Bessie "Mother" Beatty during her time in San Francisco. After Ms. Beatty's adventures covering the Russian Revolution (''[[The Red Heart of Russia]]'', 1918), she invited Berta to New York City to do fashion design illustration for ''[[McCall's]]'', where Ms. Beatty had become an editor.

Elmer Hader was born in [[Pajaro, California]], but spent much of his youth in San Francisco. At the age of 16, as a member of the National Guard, he helped restore order to San Francisco after the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake|1906 earthquake]]. He worked briefly in a survey party up the American River (near Sacramento, California), then returned to San Francisco to work as a firefighter on the [[State Belt Railroad]] (a dock-side railroad that acted as a shuttle for goods and people&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanfranciscotrains.org/sbrr_history.html San Francisco Trains - Welcome!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;), where his father worked as an engineer. Elmer used his earnings from this job to pay for his first term at California School of Design. He then obtained scholarships to finish at the school (1907–1910). Elmer was also involved in theatre, and was supported by two theatrical groups, including his time in Paris at the [[Académie Julian]] from 1912-1914. He was so successful at vaudeville routines in France and the U.S. (on the [[Pantages circuit]]), in which he would do a "Painting a Minute" act and, later, a living statue routine (in which individuals were made up to appear to be statues), that he considered dropping his long-term goal of becoming an artist. He did not. He returned to San Francisco, set up a studio in his parents attic, painted, taught art, and arranged exhibits. Elmer was the first artist showcased in a one-man one themed show at the Palace of Fine Arts. He was drafted into the U.S. Army and returned to France in 1918 as a member of the Camouflage Corps, just at the time that Berta was asked by Ms. Beatty to come to New York to work in fashion design illustration at ''McCalls''.

When Elmer and Berta met in San Francisco, they had both been part of a broad network of artists and intellectuals in the area. They became good friends, and, rather than return to San Francisco, Elmer went directly to New York when he was demobilized in February 1919. Berta was working for ''McCall's''. The two married in July of that year, then lived briefly in Greenwich Village. Seeking a more rustic setting, they left the city to rent the Lyall Cottage in [[Grand View-on-Hudson, New York|Grand View-on-Hudson]], a small town in rural [[Rockland County, New York]] on the west bank of the Hudson River. This would become the area where they would spend the rest of their lives. Their home, which took more than twenty years to construct, was largely built by the Haders and their friends, and the house became an art project in its own right. Elmer went so far as to extract the stones used to build the house from the earth himself. The Haders had a son in the early 1920s, Hamilton (named after the author Hamilton Williamson), who died from meningitis not long before he turned three. They retreated to a friend's home in Maine to grieve and heal. They returned to New York to continue work on their home and to continue their artistic careers contributing artwork to many magazines, creating broadsides, pamphlets, painting miniatures (Berta) and portraits (Elmer).

==Career==
The two used their talents and Berta's connections to prepare children's sections for ''Good Housekeeping'', ''McCall's'', ''Pictorial Review'', ''Asia'', ''Century'', and ''The Christian Science Monitor''. They did pictures and cut-outs, often featuring children dressed in national costumes. In ''Berta and Elmer Hader's Picture Book of Mother Goose'', the couple collated pen-and-ink and color drawings they had done for ''Monitor'' and ''Good Housekeeping'' to great acclaim. When the US Postal Service dis-allowed the sending of magazines with cut-out segments in 1926, the Haders switched gears, gaining a contract with MacMillan for a series of children's books. They began writing the stories for some of the books in this period. Demand for their product soared, and they worked incessantly from 1927–1931, illustrating, in some cases writing, producing, and helping to sell thirty-four titles. They stayed busy for the rest of their lives, producing another seventy or so books before they retired in 1964. One book in particular, ''Billy Butter'' (1936), so impressed writer John Steinbeck that he requested Elmer Hader do the cover to ''The Grapes of Wrath'' (1939). Hader eventually did covers for two other Steinbeck works, ''East of Eden'' (1952) and ''The Winter of Our Discontent'' (1961).

The Haders were early champions of conservation, animal protection, and pacifism. This made its way into their work, particularly with titles such as ''The Runaways'' (1956) and ''Two Is Company, Three's a Crowd'' (1965?). In the early 1950s, Berta became a community activist, ignited by the seemingly lost cause of having the location of the proposed [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955–2017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]] moved to a less sensitive area than its planned path through her village. Though ''The New York Times'' accused her of "blocking progress," the [[New York State Thruway Authority]] eventually relented,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nycroads.com/crossings/tappan-zee/ Tappan Zee Bridge (I-87 and I-287)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the massive 4,88&amp;nbsp;km-long bridge was built several kilometers to the north at Nyack, where the bridge still stands today.

Berta and Elmer travelled extensively in Mexico, Jamaica, and the far northeast of the United States, some of which made its way into their work. 'The Story of Pancho and the Bull with the Crooked Tail" (1942), ''Jamaica Johnny'' (1943), and ''Tommy Thatcher Goes to Sea'' (1950) are all informed by their travels. Elmer died on his 84th birthday at his home in Grand-View-on-Hudson. Berta remained at the home until shortly before she died 1976 February 6 at the age of 85.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2377">'''Car of the Carians''' ({{lang-el|Κάρ}}), according to [[Herodotus]], was the brother of [[Lydus]] and [[Mysus]]. He was regarded as the eponymous and ancestral hero of the [[Carians]] who would have received their name from the king. He may or may not be the same as [[Car (Greek mythology)#Car of Megara|Car of Megara]] &lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 607. ''CAR (Καρ), a son of [[Phoroneus]], and king of [[Megara]], from whom the acropolis of this town derived its name [[Caria]]. (Paus. i. 39. § 4, 40. § 5).  His tomb was shown as late as the time of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], on the road from Megara to [[Corinth]], (i. 44. § 9).  Another mythical personage of the name of Car, who was a brother of [[Lydus]] and [[Mysus]], and was regarded as the ancestral hero of the [[Carians]], is mentioned by [[Herodotus]], (i. 171.) [L. S.]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Car of the Carians==
[[Herodotus]] mentions Car, brother of [[Lydus]] and [[Mysus]]; the three brothers were believed to have been the ancestral heroes and eponyms of the [[Caria]]ns, the [[Lydia]]ns and the [[Mysia]]ns respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]], ''Histories'', 1. 171&lt;/ref&gt; This Car was credited by [[Pliny the Elder]] with inventing the [[auspice|auspicia]].&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'', 7. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

Car was also said to have founded the city [[Alabanda]], which he named after [[Alabandus]], his son by [[Callirhoe (daughter of Meander)|Callirhoe]] (the daughter of the river god [[Meander (mythology)|Maeander]]).  In turn, Alabandus's name is said to have been chosen in commemoration of his Car's victory in a horse fight— according to the scholar [[Stephanus of Byzantium]], "Alabandos" was the [[Carian language|Carian]] word for "winner in a horse fight".&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. ''Alabanda''&lt;/ref&gt; Another son of Car, [[Idrieus]], had the city [[Idrias]] named after himself.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. ''Idrias''&lt;/ref&gt;

The tomb of Car was in the Carian city [[Souangela]], giving that city its name— according to Stephanus, "Souangela" meant "tomb of the king" in Carian.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] s. v. ''Souaggela''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Farrar is a director of New Zealand Domain Name Registry Ltd (.nz Registry Services),&lt;ref name=".nz Registry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzrs.net.nz|accessdate=8 November 2006|title=New Zealand Domain Name Registry}}&lt;/ref&gt; and manages his own [[market research]] company [http://www.curia.co.nz/ Curia].

Previously Farrar worked as a staff member of the [[Leader of the Opposition (New Zealand)|Leader of the Opposition]] (1999–2004), a staff member at National Party Head Office (1999 and 2004), a staff member in Ministerial Services under [[Jim Bolger]] (1996–1997) and in the [[Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet (New Zealand)|Prime Minister's Office]] under [[Jenny Shipley]] (1997–1999).{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Farrar writes weekly columns for the ''[[National Business Review]]'' and the iPredict futures site, and is a regular commentator on [[Radio New Zealand]] and [[Newstalk ZB]].

The ''[[New Zealand Listener]]'' 2009 [[New Zealand Listener Power List|Power List]] named Farrar the fourth most powerful person in the New Zealand media, saying "Kiwiblog has become part of the daily routine for Beltway insiders and others with an interest in politics and public policy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=December 2009|title=2009 Power List|publisher=[[The New Zealand Listener]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political involvement==

===Taxpayers' Union===
In 2013, Farrar, with Jordan Williams, established the fiscally conservative lobby group, the New Zealand Taxpayers' Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.taxpayers.org.nz/who_we_are | title=Who We Are | publisher=Taxpayers' Union | accessdate=26 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Union is based on the [[TaxPayers' Alliance|United Kingdom TaxPayers Alliance]] and resulted from both Farrar and Williams' interaction with that group's founder, Matthew Elliot, through the [[International Young Democrat Union]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2013/10/the_new_zealand_taxpayers_union.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Young Nationals ===
Farrar is an honorary life member of the [[New Zealand Young Nationals|Young Nationals]], due to his many years of service to the organisation.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

He survived some media calls for his resignation as National Secretary when he was arrested for his part in a joke press release, along with fellow Young National Michael P Moore, announcing that maverick National MP [[Michael Laws]] had been assassinated and that the Prime Minister was one of over 10,000 suspects. The joke press-release was made with the [[New Zealand Police]] logo. Farrar and Moore were subsequently arrested, but not convicted of any crime as they chose to participate in a diversion scheme for first time offenders of minor crime. The infamous fax and related media items are now displayed at the Backbencher Bar on [[Molesworth Street in Wellington]], across the road from Parliament.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Campaign manager===
At the [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005 general election]] Farrar was the volunteer campaign manager for National's {{NZ electorate link|Wellington Central}} candidate [[Mark Blumsky]]. Blumsky was defeated in his attempt to become an electorate MP, but succeeded in entering parliament via the party list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10426858|work=New Zealand Herald|accessdate=20 December 2007|date=4 March 2007|first=Deborah|last=Coddington|title=Making a difference, one issue at a time}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political views===
Farrar professes a [[classical liberalism|classical liberal]] approach to politics, that is often compromised by his party affiliation with the [[liberal conservative]] National Party (for instance over state security powers vs individual rights &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2014/05/the_campbell_live_dotcom_conspiracy_episode.html|title=The Campbell Live Dotcom conspiracy episode|work=Kiwiblog.co.nz}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and identifies as a moderate of the center-right on the political spectrum. He was a co-chair of National's Classical Liberal Policy Advisory Group at its formation in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=National Party Board approves Classical Liberal Policy Advisory Group |url= http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PA0405/S00280.htm |publisher=New Zealand National Party |date=13 May 2004 |accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He supported the legalisation of [[prostitution in New Zealand|prostitution]] and of [[civil union in New Zealand|civil unions in New Zealand]]. Farrar supports a [[Republicanism in New Zealand|New Zealand republic]], and is on the National Council of the [[Republican Movement of Aotearoa New Zealand|New Zealand Republican Movement]]. Economically his views are more in keeping with those of parties to the right of the National Party, such as the [[market fundamentalism]] of the minority&lt;ref&gt;2014 NZ Election, Party results. http://www.electionresults.govt.nz/electionresults_2014/partystatus.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] party.

Farrar has appeared before Parliamentary select committees on a range of issues, including the [[Electoral Finance Act 2007|Electoral Finance Bill]]. He often publishes his submissions on his blog.&lt;ref name="efb_sub"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiwiblog.co.nz/2007/09/my_submission_on_the_electoral_finance_bill.html |title=My submission on the Electoral Finance Bill|date=10 September 2007|publisher=Kiwiblog|author=David Farrar|authorlink=David Farrar (blogger)|accessdate=23 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:AselAsleh.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Picture of Asleh at [[Seeds of Peace]]]]

The '''death of Asel Asleh''' occurred on 2 October 2000 when a [[Arab citizens of Israel|Palestinian-Israeli]] (Arab citizen of Israel) and peace activist was killed at the onset of the [[Second Intifada]] by the [[Israel security forces]]. Asleh was 17 years old at the time of his death.

==Background==
'''Asel Asleh''' ({{lang-ar|أسيل عاصلة}}, {{lang-he-n|אסיל עאסלה}}; May 6, 1983&amp;nbsp;– October 2, 2000) was from the village of [[Arraba, Israel|Arraba]] in the [[Lower Galilee]]. He had been a member of the international conflict resolution organization [[Seeds of Peace]] since 1997. Prior to his death, Asleh described himself as "a Palestinian-Israeli".&lt;ref&gt;[https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70D10F93D5F0C7A8EDDA10894D1494D81 In Search of Peace On Common Ground] New York Times, August 29, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; He had many [[Judaism|Jewish]] friends and was killed while wearing the Seeds of Peace T-shirt.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/06/15/world/police-killings-of-israeli-arabs-being-questioned-by-inquiry-809918.html?n=Top%2FReference%2FTimes+Topics%2FSubjects%2FA%2FArabs Police Killings of Israeli Arabs Being Questioned by Inquiry] New York Times, 15 June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Killing==
Asleh attended a protest in his village on 2 October. Trying to disperse the protest, an [[Israeli Security Forces]] unit shot [[Lachrymatory agent|tear-gas]] and live ammunition at the protesters. The precise actions which led to the death of Asleh were unclear; the police officers stated that they did not know how he was killed, while his cousin said that he had seen a gun pointed at Asleh and then he heard three shots. A physician who treated the youth commented that Asleh was shot in the neck at point-blank range, and that crucial time had been lost when the police delayed the arrival of an ambulance.&lt;ref name="query.nytimes.com"/&gt; Officers said he was already shot when they found him lying in the olive grove. Eventually, Asleh died at [[Medical Center Of The Galilee|Nahariya Hospital]]. The examination by the Or Commission reached a very advanced stage but ended when the Asleh family refused to allow the exhumation of Asel's body to extract the bullets which killed Asleh for tests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/suspect-1.202642 Suspect] Haaretz Print Edition, 18 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Or Commission, the October 2000 events and further investigations==
Including Asleh, 13 Arab citizens of Israels were killed. Asel's father successfully led a campaign to investigate the death of his son and others killed in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2058163/ Ned Lazarus] Slate.com, November 9, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the [[October 2000 events]] were investigated by the Israeli-government appointed [[Or Commission]]. The Or Commission heavily condemned Israeli police for being unprepared for the protests and possibly using excessive force to disperse the protesters. Asel's father, Hassan, is head of the [[Committee of the Victims’ Families]], which has sought to keep pressure on the official responsible for the death of Asleh and the other twelve killed in October 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adalah.org/eng/pressreleases/pr.php?file=08_01_29 Adalah: We will Seek the Establishment of an Independent, Impartial Investigatory Committee with the Participation of International Experts in Response to AG Mazuz's Decision to Close the October 2000 Killings Cases] Adalah, 29 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, Israeli newspaper [[Haaretz]] reported that the main suspect in Asleh's killing refused a lie detector test six times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/main-suspect-in-october-2000-killing-refused-lie-detector-test-six-times-1.202675 Main suspect in October 2000 killing refused lie detector test six times] Haaretz, 18 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; On October 24, 2000, three weeks after Asleh's death, [[United Kingdom]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Richard Burden]] opened a debate on the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]] by noting Asleh's recent death and the lack of autopsy and investigation to that point.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epolitix.com/mpwebsites/mpspeeches/mpspeechdetails/newsarticle/the-middle-east-situation///mpsite/richard-burden/ The Middle East situation] Epolitix, October 24, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further protests==
In February 2008, members of [[Seeds of Peace]] led a protest in front of Israel's Ministry of Justice demanding that it reopen the investigation into the October 2000 events, specifically the death of former Seed Asleh. The protesters also sent letters to Attorney General [[Menahem Mazuz]] and Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] asking if the victims had been Jews if the case would be reopened.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=91162 Seeds of Peace alumni rally for October riots victims] Jerusalem Post, February 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 2010, 6,000 Arab citizens of Israel and supporters led a procession marking the 10 year anniversary of Asleh and the 12 other Arabs killed in October 2000.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4896">The '''Detroit Sleeper Cell''' is a group of men of [[Middle East|Middle-Eastern]] descent who the [[United States Department of Justice]] believed were plotting an attack on [[Disneyland]].

==Trial==
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage =  | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_xmYtqUPqE The Detroit Sleeper Cell, Retro Report Voices], 11:43, [[Retro Report]]&lt;ref name="retro1"&gt;{{cite web | title =The Sleeper Cell That Wasn’t | work = | publisher =[[Retro Report]] | date = | url =https://www.retroreport.org/video/the-sleeper-cell-that-wasnt/ | accessdate =December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}
While on a trip to Disneyland, the four men recorded a home video. The Justice Department believed that this recording was [[reconnaissance]] for a future terror attack.  This video, combined with the testimony of self-described con-artist [[Youssef Hmimssa]], and what the defense called [[doodle]]s in a day planner, but the prosecution called terror plans, led to the conviction of two men on June 3, 2003.{{r|Wapo051119}}
	
The prosecution claimed the five were "[[Takfiris]]" &amp;mdash; followers of a radical [[Islam]]ic sect that allowed [[mujahideen]] to drink alcohol, use narcotics, and refrain from praying, in order to blend into Western societies, so they could mount clandestine attacks on them.&lt;ref name=FIndLaw&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/terrorism/uskoubriti82802ind.pdf USA v. Karim Kobrouti et al.], ''[[Findlaw]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Youssef Hmimssa]], who pleaded guilty to multiple charges of credit card fraud and identity theft, agreed to testify against the four men, in a deal that would allow him to consolidate his other charges, and avoid further charges, reducing his sentence to between 37 and 46 months in prison.&lt;ref name=metrotimes060703&gt;[http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=4801 Cell phony - Government’s star witness says he’s a scam artist, not a terrorist.], ''[[Metro Times]]'', April 16, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Defense attorneys Joseph A. Niskar, James C. Thomas, James Gerometta, Richard Helfrick, William Swor, Margaret Raben, and Robert Morgan were assigned to represent each individual member of the group. However, the attorneys argued the case together.

==Post-trial==
Later, the conviction of the two men was overturned by information indicating that the prosecution had withheld important information from the defense. In the Justice Department's filing they claimed there was "no reasonable prospect of winning," and "In its best light, the record would show that the prosecution committed a pattern of mistakes and oversights that deprived the defendants of discoverable evidence (including impeachment material) and created a record filled with misleading inferences that such material did not exist".&lt;ref name = Usatoday040901&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2004-09-01-terror-doj_x.htm Judge throws out terror convictions], ''[[USA Today]], September 1, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

A federal grand jury is investigating whether the prosecution withheld information from the defense and deceived the jury.  [[Richard Convertino]], the lead prosecutor in the case, sued [[Attorney General]] [[John D. Ashcroft]], accusing Ashcroft and others of mismanagement and retaliation, but the lawsuit was thrown out by a judge.&lt;ref name=Wapo051119&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/11/19/AR2005111900952.html Detroit 'Sleeper Cell' Prosecutor Faces Probe: Grand Jury Considering Indictment for Misconduct], ''[[Washington Post]]'', November 19, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Don Davis''' (April 10, 1933&amp;nbsp;– February 4, 2016) was an American gun retailer, the owner of Don's Guns and Galleries, a [[firearm]]s retailer in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]].  He claimed to be the largest independent gun dealer in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;"As Expiration Looms, Gun Ban's Effect Is Debated", ''[[The New York Times]]'', 10 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and his store has been called the largest public display of firearms in America.&lt;ref&gt;"To protest killings, owner of gun shop burns assault rifles", ''Post Tribune (IN)'', 31 October 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
For a while, he operated multiple 24-hour stores in the Indianapolis area.

On October 8, 1997, Davis' [[Greenwood, Indiana]] store was robbed, and an employee shot and killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-10-08/news/9710080030_1_weapons-pistols-gun-store |title=Murder Suspect Eludes Cops |website=Articles.chicagotribune.com |date=1997-10-08 |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after the incident, he closed all except for the Lafayette Road [[Flagship#Flagship as a metaphor|flagship store]], which reduced its business hours. On September 17, 2012, a customer visiting the store to utilize its indoor [[shooting range]] intentionally shot a store employee twice. The employee immediately returned fire, killing his attacker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Jefferson |url=http://www.wthr.com/story/19562707/two-shot-at-dons-guns |title=Two shot at Don's Guns; one dead - 13 WTHR Indianapolis |website=Wthr.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was named among the top five dealers who sell guns to criminals by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], ranked at #4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wthr.com/Global/story.asp?S=4942752 |title=Don's Guns named among top five dealers selling guns to criminals - 13 WTHR Indianapolis |website=Wthr.com |date=2006-05-24 |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the problem is not with his selling the guns, which requires [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] screening, but with those who purchase them and privately resell them, which he describes as a major [[wikt:loophole|loophole]] in the [[Gun law in the United States|gun control laws]]. Some area residents feel that Davis catered to a less-than-upstanding clientele, largely profiting from inflated prices for people that have been described as dubious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gunnuts.net/2008/01/28/indy-gun-shop-series-dons-guns/ |title=Indy Gun Shop Series: Don’s Guns – Gun Nuts Media |website=Gunnuts.net |date=2008-01-28 |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was a vocal proponent of the [[Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act|Brady Bill]], who went so far as to burn all of his military-style semiautomatic firearms on national television while the bill was being debated in Congress. He later called the bill largely ineffective, because of its wording, which does not ban guns by type or firing capacity, but rather by specific technical attributes.&lt;ref&gt;"High Demand for Assault Weapons", ''Indianapolis Star'', 19 August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was locally known for his late night [[television commercial]]s. ''Indianapolis Magazine'' voted them as the worst Indianapolis-based commercials in 1984 and 1985. He traditionally ended them with his slogan, "I don't want to make any money.  I just love to sell guns, heh-heh-heh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lgACjBJ4JJc |title=Don's Guns Garage band commercial |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-05-24 |accessdate=2016-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis was interviewed by [[NPR]]'s [[Michele Norris]] on ''[[All Things Considered]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

The '''Eight Witnesses''' were one of the two groups of witnesses who made a statement stating that they had seen the [[golden plates]] which [[Joseph Smith]], Jr. said was his source material for the [[Book of Mormon]]. The other group of [[Book of Mormon witnesses]] who said they saw the plates are called the [[Three Witnesses]].

==Testimony==
The testimony of the Eight Witnesses was first published at the end of the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon and has been printed in nearly every edition since, although most subsequent editions moved the statement to the front of the book and included minor grammatical corrections.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, unto whom this work shall come: That Joseph Smith, Jun., the translator of this work, has shewn unto us the plates of which hath been spoken, which have the appearance of gold; and as many of the leaves as the said Smith has translated we did handle with our hands; and we also saw the engravings thereon, all of which has the appearance of ancient work, and of curious workmanship. And this we bear record with words of soberness, that the said Smith has shewn unto us, for we have seen and hefted, and know of a surety that the said Smith has got the plates of which we have spoken. And we give our names unto the world, to witness unto the world that which we have seen. And we lie not, God bearing witness of it.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike the Three Witnesses, the Eight testified that they both saw and handled the plates. Another difference is that the Eight testified that they were shown the plates by [[Joseph Smith]] rather than by an angel as had the Three Witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;According to Terryl Givens, Joseph invited the Eight "to a family prayer spot in the woods" and "matter-of-factly displayed to them the golden plates," whereas the Three were shown the plates "by an angel of God [who] came down from heaven." [[Terryl Givens]], ''By the Hand of Mormon'' (Oxford University Press, 2002), 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Setting==

Toward the end of June 1829, at the [[Peter Whitmer, Sr.]] home in [[Fayette, New York]], Joseph Smith, Jr. (with [[Oliver Cowdery]] as scribe) finished the translation of the Book of Mormon. Near the end of translation process, a prophecy was translated from the [[Second Book of Nephi]] that three, and "a few" others, might see the golden plates. Subsequently, on June 28, 1829, near the Whitmer farm,&lt;ref name=Anderson2012&gt;{{citation |first= Gale Yancey |last= Anderson |date=Spring 2012 |title= Eleven Witnesses Behold the Plates |journal= [[Journal of Mormon History]] |volume= 38 |issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|152}} the Three Witnesses had their experience. Thereafter, the Smith and Whitmer families traveled to the [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]] home in [[Palmyra (town), New York|Palmyra, New York]]. On July 2, 1829, near the Smith home, the Eight Witnesses saw and handled the golden plates.&lt;ref name=Anderson2012 /&gt;{{rp|156}}

==About the witnesses==

The Eight Witnesses were all members of the Whitmer or Smith families: [[Christian Whitmer]], [[Jacob Whitmer]], [[Peter Whitmer, Jr.]], [[John Whitmer]], [[Hiram Page]], [[Joseph Smith, Sr.]], [[Hyrum Smith]], and [[Samuel H. Smith (Latter Day Saints)|Samuel H. Smith]]. Joseph Smith, Sr. was Joseph Smith's father, and Hyrum and Samuel were his brothers. Christian, Jacob, Peter Jr. and John were [[David Whitmer]]'s brothers, and Hiram Page was his brother-in-law.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Lyman Bushman]], ''[[Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling]]'' (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2005) p. 79: "Critics pointed out how many of the witnesses were members of the Smith and Whitmer families, implying that they signed out of loyalty or from a self-serving motive .... The witnesses were no substitute for making the plates accessible to anyone for examination, but the testimonies showed Joseph—and God—answering doubters with concrete evidence, a concession to the needs of post-Enlightenment Christians."&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the familiar relationship among the witnesses, satirist [[Mark Twain]] wrote, "I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire Whitmer family had testified."&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=y589pE4d9FcC&amp;pg=PA113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Split with Smith===
In 1838, the living members of Whitmer family (Christian Whitmer and Peter Whitmer, Jr. died in 1835 and 1836, respectively) became estranged from Smith during a leadership struggle in [[Far West, Missouri]], and all were excommunicated along with other dissenters and fled Caldwell County after receiving an ultimatum from the [[Danites]].&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, 337, 339, 350–51. On June 17, [[Sidney Rigdon]] "preached [[Salt sermon|a vitriolic sermon]] based on the theme of salt losing its savor and being cast out and trodden underfoot .... Soon after the sermon, eighty-three prominent members in Far West, many of them probably Danites by then, signed an ultimatum demanding the departure of the offenders .... Fearing for their property and perhaps their lives, the dissenters fled." (355–51) In 1847, David, John, and Jacob Whitmer and Hiram Page were baptized into the newly formed [[Church of Christ (Whitmerite)|Church of Christ]] founded by [[William E. M'Lellin]]. In 1831, Joseph Smith received a revelation from God that John Whitmer should "write and keep a regular history" of the church (D&amp;C 47). Whitmer did eventually write such a history, but one which concluded with a detailed description of what Whitmer considered the mistreatment that he and his family had received in Caldwell County. See Bruce N. Westerngren, ''From Historian to Dissident: The Book of John Whitmer'' (Salt Lake City: Signature Books, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; Following the death of Smith, none of the Whitmers joined the group that was led by [[Brigham Young]] and would become [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]].

Yet despite the estrangement of the Whitmer family, there is little evidence that any of the Eight Witnesses denied his testimony to the authenticity of Book of Mormon or the gold plates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Givens |first=Terryl |title=The Book of Mormon: A Very Short Introduction |year=2009 |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=99}}; {{Citation |last=Remini |first=Robert |title=Joseph Smith |year=2002 |publisher=Penguin Group |pages=67–68}}. One third-hand source, the former Mormon leader Stephen Burnett, said in 1838 that [[Martin Harris (Latter Day Saints)|Martin Harris]] had told him that "the eight witnesses never saw [the plates] &amp; hesitated to sign that instrument for that reason, but were persuaded to do it." Stephen Burnett letter to Lyman E. Johnson dated April 15, 1838. Typed transcript from Joseph Smith Papers, Letter book, April 20, 1837 – February 9, 1843, microfilm reel 2, pp. 64–66, LDS Church archives&lt;/ref&gt;

Von Bodmann joined the [[Nazi Party]] in May 1932 (membership number 1,098,482) and the SS itself in 1934 (member number 267,787). From October 1939 to June 1940 and from July 1941 to January 1942 he served with the 79th SS-Standarte in [[Ulm]] in the Second Bataillon as a physician.&lt;ref name="Lasik"&gt;Aleksander Lasik, 'Die Organisationsstruktur des KL Auschwitz', in: Aleksander Lasik, [[Franciszek Piper]], Piotr Setkiewicz, Irena Strzelecka, ''Auschwitz 1940-1945.

Von Bodmann was appointed camp physician at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in February 1942 and the following year held a similar position at [[Majdanek concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="Lasik"/&gt; He subsequently filled the same role at [[Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp]] and from September 1943 at [[Vaivara concentration camp]].&lt;ref name="Klee"/&gt; At some point he also worked at [[Neuengamme concentration camp]] although the exact dates are unknown.&lt;ref name="Klee"/&gt; Eyewitnesses claimed that at Auschwitz von Bodmann killed inmates personally by injecting [[Phenol]] into their veins and also stated that he carried out similar procedures at other camps.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Klee, ''Auschwitz, die NS-Medizin und ihre Opfer''., Frankfurt am Main, 1997, p. 410&lt;/ref&gt; Von Bodmann's departure from Auschwitz, where he had no superiors and as such acted largely as he pleased, was hastened when he contracted [[typhus]] not long after arriving.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hermann Langbein]], ''People in Auschwitz'', UNC Press Books, 2004, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt;

He left the camps in September 1944 when he was sent to work for [[SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt]] and then to the [[Hauptamt Volksdeutsche Mittelstelle]]. His final assignment was as troop physician to the [[5th SS Panzer Division Wiking]].&lt;ref name="Lasik"/&gt; He was taken as a prisoner of war and held in a military hospital where he killed himself just after the end of the [[Second World War]].&lt;ref name="Klee"/&gt;

'''Gary J. Aguirre''' is an American [[lawyer]], former investigator with the [[United States Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) and [[whistleblower]].

After working in a law firm briefly, he became a [[public defender]], then worked as a [[trial lawyer]] in California. Having reached his professional and financial goals, he took an extended break in 1995. In 2000, he decided to go into public service and went back to law school, focusing on international and securities law.

After earning his second law degree, he applied for a job with the SEC, where he became the lead investigator on an [[insider trading]] case involving [[Pequot Capital Management]]. Suspecting the leaked information came from [[John J. Mack]], a [[Wall Street]] titan and major contributor to the 2004 campaign of President [[George W. Bush]], Aguirre wanted to [[subpoena]] Mack, but supervisors told him Mack had too much "political clout" and would not be pursued. Aguirre complained to a superior about the preferential treatment being given Mack and was fired without warning. A Senate investigation later found his termination to have been an illegal reprisal.&lt;ref name="sen"&gt;[http://finance.senate.gov/library/prints/download/?id=f9d94204-7602-49f7-8bab-cb932c05310e "The Firing of an SEC Attorney and the Investigation of Pequot Capital Management."] Report by the United States Senate Committees on Finance and Judiciary.

== Enters private practice ==
Aguirre is a lawyer in [[San Diego]], California. He was admitted to the [[State Bar of California]] on December 23, 1966.&lt;ref name="aguirre-compl"&gt;Gary Aguirre v. Securities and Exchange Commission, Case 1:08-cv-01872-ESH, Second Amended Complaint. [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]]. Filed April 1, 2009, pp. 2–4&lt;/ref&gt; He became an [[Associate attorney|associate]] at [[Brobeck, Phleger &amp; Harrison]], then one of [[San Francisco]]'s largest firms. In his spare time, worked on [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s presidential campaign.&lt;ref name="walbert"&gt;Claude Walbert, "Coming Home: Gary Aguirre's return to San Diego". ''San Diego Lawyer'' (September/October 2007) pp.&amp;nbsp;16–20.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 28, 1968, Kennedy sent him a letter that spoke of the special role lawyers played in bringing about orderly change to the nation. Just eight days after sending the letter, Kennedy was [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|assassinated]].&lt;ref name="walbert" /&gt;

After a year, Aguirre left Brobeck to become a public defender in [[Fresno County]], where he found both the trial experience&lt;ref name="walbert" /&gt; and public service he was seeking. Later moving back to private practice in San Diego, he made a name for himself&lt;ref name="walbert" /&gt; by proving that [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]] (PSA) was [[Legal liability|liable]]&lt;ref&gt;Ted Vollmer, "PSA Ruled Liable for Crash Damage Claims", ''[[Los Angeles Times]] San Diego County Edition'' (August 15, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt; for a [[PSA Flight 182|mid-air plane crash over San Diego in 1978]], then the worst aviation disaster in U.S. history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patriotledger.com/entertainment/x1902441264/PLANE-CRASH-INSPIRES-FILM "Hull filmmaker's documentary on plane crash opens Wednesday"] ''The Patriot Ledger'' (April 6, 2010) Retrieved February 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, Aguirre pioneered construction-defect [[litigation]], a branch of [[class-action]] law&lt;ref name="sandoval"&gt;Ricardo Sandoval, [http://aguirrelawfirm.com/global_pictures/Attachment_1.pdf "When the roof falls in"] (PDF) ''California Lawyer'' (September 1992) Retrieved February 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; previously considered by San Diego lawyers to be too difficult for [[plaintiff]]s to win.&lt;ref name="walbert" /&gt; In 1983, ''[[San Diego Magazine]]'' called him "a legal fireball" for his case proving PSA's liability and for his case against the [[Johns-Manville|Manville]] Corporation, which had national importance.&lt;ref name="sandie83"&gt;"83 San Diegans to Watch in '83".

=== Manville ===
In the early 1970s, Manville Corporation, a [[Dow Jones]] company&lt;ref name="jm-hist"&gt;[http://www.jm.com/corporate/56.htm Johns Manville company history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217012736/http://www.jm.com/corporate/56.htm |date=2011-02-17 }} Johns Manville. Received March 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; sold a [[stucco]]-like product for use on exterior walls. Within a short time, the product was found to be defective and deteriorate rapidly, causing significant damage to homes and buildings.&lt;ref name="ABA"&gt;Lynne Reaves, [https://books.google.com/books?id=4UNsogHmxZoC&amp;pg=PA31 "A bond in time"] ''[[ABA Journal]]'' (July 1984). Retrieved February 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Manville pulled the product off the market in 1974, just four years after it was introduced.&lt;ref name="wsj-82" /&gt;

In the course of preparing his case, Aguirre began monitoring Manville in October 1981, when the company undertook a reorganization that moved 75% of its assets to four of five new companies it created.&lt;ref name="keller1"&gt;Larry Keller, "Aguirre Against Ch. 11 for Manville", ''[[San Diego Daily Transcript]]'' (October 28, 1982). Front page.&lt;/ref&gt; The board of directors and officers remained in the same positions, so nothing essential changed; except the assets were diverted.&lt;ref name="keller1" /&gt; Aguirre became convinced Manville was trying to put its assets beyond the reach of [[unsecured creditor]]s&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;Michael A. Hiltzik, "A Hunch Could Pay Off in Manville Case", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' (December 15, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; and when he went to trial, he accurately predicted the company would file between 45 and 60 days.&lt;ref name="wsj-82" /&gt;

The three-month-long trial concluded with Aguirre winning a $6 million award against Manville, at that time, the largest amount in San Diego [[Superior Court]] history.&lt;ref name="keller3"&gt;Larry Keller, "Manville Ordered To Pay $6 Million For Faulty Stucco", ''San Diego Transcript'' (July 2, 1982).&lt;/ref&gt; The amount was later increased to $7.5 million when delay [[damages]] were added.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Keller, "Plaintiffs Get $7.5 Million", ''San Diego Daily Transcript''&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 1982, the day after winning his lawsuit against Manville, Aguirre went back to court to ask that Manville be required to post a $9 million bond to guarantee his clients' [[Judgment (law)|judgment]] in case of a bankruptcy filing, arguing that Manville was on the verge of filing a [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy.&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;At the beginning of the trial in March, Aguirre predicted Manville would declare [[bankruptcy]] in 45 to 60 days and asked the judge then to guarantee his clients' [[Judgment (law)|judgment]]. The request was denied because at the time, Manville seemed financially sound with $2.2 billion in assets; also, no Dow Jones company had ever declared bankruptcy. (See Raymond A. Joseph, "Rescon Walls Cause Trouble for Manville", ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', December 28, 1982; and Michael A. Hiltzik, "A Hunch Could Pay Off in Manville Case", ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', December 15, 1982.)&lt;/ref&gt; Agreeing with Aguirre's argument, the judge ordered Manville to post a bond.&lt;ref name="wsj-82" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sddt"&gt;"Was Aguirre Prophetic on Manville Filing?"

Retrieved March 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On April 28, 2008, the [[United States District Court for the District of Columbia]], citing the Senate report extensively, ruled in his favor, forcing the SEC to turn over documents to Aguirre.&lt;ref name="aguirre1" /&gt; The Court wrote of "the importance of understanding the dispute between the parties, as well as plaintiff's legal argument that the public interest in disclosure of the withheld records outweighs any privacy interest" under exemptions claimed by the SEC and relied heavily on the Senate report.&lt;ref name="aguirre1" /&gt; It noted how the SEC resisted deposing Mack and didn't considering him a potential [[insider trading|tipper]] until after a front-page article in ''The New York Times'' revealed the derailed investigation&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; and then did not depose him until the [[statute of limitations]] for civil and criminal penalties had run out.&lt;ref name="aguirre1" /&gt;&lt;ref group=note&gt;The district court wrote, "The evidentiary standard is easily met in this case.

Rep. 37.) When the SEC accords special treatment to prominent figures, it "undermines public confidence [in] the integrity of its investigations and exacerbates the problems associated with 'regulatory capture.'"

SEC management conducted a suspicious "re-evaluation" of plaintiff, even though his regular evaluation had just been completed a month earlier, and according to the Senate Report, the re-evaluation "appears both improper and retaliatory," and the negative comments were "unsupported."

In 2007, Senators [[Chuck Grassley]] and [[Arlen Specter]] urged the SEC to reopen the case against Pequot, but it remained closed. Making extensive use of the documents released by the SEC to him, Aguirre uncovered incriminating evidence proving Pequot had engaged in insider trading of [[Microsoft]] and he shared this evidence with the SEC in a 16-page letter to SEC chairman [[Christopher Cox]], dated January 2, 2009.&lt;ref name="gap" /&gt;&lt;ref name="paltrow"&gt;Scot J. Paltrow, [http://www.portfolio.com/news-markets/top-5/2009/01/07/Pequot-Investigation-Reopened/ "Pequot Probe Reopened"] Portfolio.com (January 7, 2009). Retrieved March 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, the SEC re-opened the investigation,&lt;ref name="paltrow" /&gt; but no charges were filed in the weeks or months following, though when it did finally file charges, they closely followed the evidence as stated in Aguirre's letter.&lt;ref name="gap" /&gt;

On April 1, 2009, Aguirre filed a second lawsuit against the SEC&lt;ref name="aguirre-compl" /&gt; for unlawful disclosure of his records under the [[Privacy Act of 1974]], for violating the [[due process#Incorporation of the Bill of Rights into due process|due process]] clause of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] and for [[injunctive relief]] under the Privacy Act and FOIA.&lt;ref name="aguirre2" /&gt; On December 2, 2009, in an interim decision on Aguirre's FOIA case, the Court again ruled in his favor.&lt;ref name="aguirre2" /&gt; On May 26, 2010, Aguirre filed papers in this case, seeking an order directing the SEC to release additional Pequot records to him on the grounds that under the FOIA, the SEC had to turn the records over to him because it had filed no case against Pequot or anyone else.&lt;ref name="gap" /&gt; Early the next morning,&lt;ref name="gap" /&gt; on May 27, 2010, the SEC filed charges against Pequot, Samberg and Zilkha and announced a settlement with Pequot.&lt;ref name="wapo" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2010/2010-88.htm "SEC Charges Pequot Capital Management and CEO Arthur Samberg With Insider Trading"] U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission press release (May 27, 2010).

A month later, the SEC agreed to pay Aguirre $755,000, an amount equal to four years and ten months of lost salary and attorney's fees.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The SEC nearly settled with Aguirre in May 2009, but just as both sides appeared on the verge of agreeing to the details and amount of the settlement, in an e-mail dated two hours after a ''Forbes'' article was published which quoted Aguirre criticizing the SEC, the SEC's deputy general counsel, Mark Cahn, wrote, "After careful consideration, we cannot agree to your proposed terms."

Aguirre represents [[Darcy Flynn]], an SEC lawyer who also became a whistleblower after [[Robert Khuzami]] asked his staff in an e-mail on May 18, 2011 to report any questionable behavior on the part of lawyers representing clients. Though Khuzami had meant lawyers outside the SEC, Flynn reported activity that had taken place within the SEC.&lt;ref name="taibbi" /&gt; Early in Flynn's 13-year career at the SEC, he worked on a case where investigators thought they had clear evidence of fraud against Deutsche Bank. In an interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', CEO Rolf Breuer had denied the bank was involved in talks to acquire [[Bankers Trust]], causing Bankers Trust stock to drop, which could lower the cost of a merger. SEC investigators began looking into the matter, collecting sworn testimony and documents that proved Breuer had lied. Deutsche Bank hired former SEC enforcement director [[Gary Lynch]] to persuade the SEC not to pursue the case, which had to be approved by superiors before proceeding.&lt;ref name="taibbi" /&gt; Approval to go forward with the case was approved by every level and lacked only the signature of [[Richard H.

[[File:Henry Andres Burgevine.jpg|right|thumb|Henry Andres Burgevine.]]
'''Henry Andres Burgevine''' ({{zh|c=白齊文}}) (1836&amp;ndash;1865) was an American sailor of French ancestry, [[mercenary]] and soldier of fortune, who became famous for his military victories for [[Qing Dynasty|Imperial China]] during the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. 

==Family==
According to Caleb Carr in his biography of Frederick Townsend Ward, Burgevine was the child of a [[France|French]] officer who had served under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and who had moved to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[North Carolina]] where he became an instructor in [[French language|French]] at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]. His father, after having been caught (at what?) by the President of the University, then died in a brawl in [[South Carolina]]. Burgevine then lived with his grandparents and sister in [[Ashford, North Carolina]].

==Career==
At age 7 Burgevine moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] with his mother and became a Congressional and then a Senatorial page until 1853. After travels in India, Hawaii and Australia, he then returned to Washington and then enlisted in the [[French Army]] for the duration of the [[Crimean War]], where he was decorated for bravery. 

In the early stages of the Taiping Rebellion he sided with the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] Army, serving as the deputy commander of [[Ever Victorious Army]], and succeeding the commander, [[Frederick Townsend Ward]] to command the Ever Victorious Army after Ward's death. Burgevine's assignment was against Ward's will, who wished his loyal Filipino subordinate Macanaya to succeed him as the commander, but the imperial Chinese court selected Burgevine instead.  However, Burgevine betrayed the Qing Dynasty by later defecting and joining [[Li Shixian]]'s army. He was later repatriated to the [[United States]] but he returned to China after completing half of his journey. On his return Qing police arrested him once again. In 1865 he drowned along with 10 Qing police in [[Xiamen]]'s sea on the way to [[Shanghai]], China, although some historians believed  that Burgevine was murdered on [[Li Hongzhang]]'s orders.

[[Schutzstaffel|SS]]-[[Sturmbannführer]] '''Herman Brunner''' is a recurrent supporting character from the [[Poles|Polish]] popular TV series ''[[Stawka większa niż życie|More Than Life at Stake]]'' (''Stawka większa niż życie''). He is played by [[Emil Karewicz]].

== Biography ==
A [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (sometimes incorrectly linked to [[Gestapo]]) officer in [[General Government|occupied]] [[Poland]] during [[World War II]], Brunner is a ruthless [[Nazi]] official, who sometimes works with main character, [[Lieutenant]] (later [[Captain (land and air)|Captain]]) [[Hans Kloss (fictional character)|Hans Kloss]] of [[Abwehr]], who is really [[Major]] Stanislaw Kolicki of Polish intelligence. Brunner looks after his own interests and is not a fanatic. (Near end of the war he tries to kidnap a renowned German professor, a specialist in rocket technology, in order to sell him to the western allies in exchange for his own safety and other benefits). Nothing is known about his background.

Although he appeared in just 5 of 18 episodes, Brunner became as popular a character as Kloss, sometimes even more popular. Despite his multiple sinister acts (in addition to his work in a repressive regime, he was also involved in an armed robbery, which left the wife of a high ranking [[NSDAP]] official dead), Brunner in part was a likeable character, due to his rascal-like sense of humor, and his lack of obvious involvement in violence on screen.

Many of Brunner's lines in the series are still widely known and quoted in Poland, for example:
* ''I hate to watch a man being beaten... unless I am beating him myself.''
* ''Hello Hans, I knew I would find you here.''
* ''Remember I'm always your friend, Hans.''
* ''Brunner senses women and alcohol from a kilometer away.''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8111">'''Insulinde''' (1907–1919), a direct successor of the ''[[Indische Party]]'' (IP) and later renamed the ''Nationale Indische Party'' (NIP), was a political organization that represented efforts by some [[Indo people|Indo Eurasians]] to identify and cooperate with the Indigenous educated élite of the [[Dutch East Indies]] in an effort to establish an independent dominion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lowensteyn.com/indonesia/socialist.html#63  Lowensteijn, Peter ‘’Indonesia between 1908 – 1928’’ (Lowensteyn, 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation was mainly led by Indo-European and Javanese activists, but had a considerable membership in the South Moluccas. It was considered part of the more radical political wing in the colony, for which it faced much oppression from the colonial authorities.

==Foundation==
''Insulinde'' was the direct successor of the [[Indische Party]] (IP), with a strong [[Indo people|Indo-European (Eurasian)]] following and was based in [[Semarang]]. When the 3 founders of the IP ([[Ernest Douwes Dekker|E.F.E. Douwes Dekker]], [[Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo]] and [[Ki Hajar Dewantara|Soewardi Soerjaningrat]]) were exiled to the Netherlands in 1913, the IP secretary became chairman of the newly established ‘’Insulinde’’.  The ‘’Insulinde’’ leadership was immediately put under strict police surveillance, but retained a strong core following. 6 September, the founding day of the IP and coincidentally also the day the 3 IP founders sailed into exile was proclaimed 'IP Day' by ‘’Insulinde’’.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelis Dijk, C., van Dijk, K. ‘’The Netherlands Indies and the Great War 1914-1918’’ (Publisher: KITLV Press, 2007)  P.59-61&lt;/ref&gt;

Still many former IP members were scared off by the harsh measures of the colonial authorities and refrained from joining ‘’Insulinde’’. Its magazine ‘De Express‘ lost subscriptions and came into financial difficulties. Only to be saved by the IP's so called TADO ‘’Tot Aan De Onafhankelijkheid’’, (Until The Independence) fund. The three former leaders of the IP, branded "embittered extremists" by the colonial government, were held in great esteem by the Insulinde members. During the 1913 Dutch imperial festivities Indo-Europeans of the ‘’Indische’’ party drove through white (totok) neighbourhoods in the big cities waving the IP banner.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelis Dijk, C., van Dijk, K. ‘’The Netherlands Indies and the Great War 1914-1918’’ (Publisher: KITLV Press, 2007)  P.59-64&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insulinde Magazine==
August 1914 Insulinde published its bi-weekly Dutch &amp; Malay language paper, named ‘De Goentoer’ (The Thunder), edited by Javanese Insulinde member Darnakoesoemo, a close friend of IP leader [[Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo|Tjipto]].&lt;ref&gt;Cornelis Dijk, C., van Dijk, K. ‘’The Netherlands Indies and the Great War 1914-1918’’ (Publisher: KITLV Press, 2007) P.495&lt;/ref&gt; To the great dismay of the authorities It still called for independence of the Dutch East Indies, “free of foreign tyranny” and defended the interests of indigenous and Indo people alike.

Contributors Darnakoesoemo and fellow Javanese [[Marco Kartodikromo]] aka Mas Marco, were considered “extremely dangerous” and were prosecuted for subversive activity by the authorities for which they served time. Mas Marco went to the Netherlands for 5 months after his sentence in 1916. In the Netherlands he was surprised and impressed, as other indigenous exiles and student activists were before him, by the much greater levels of freedom of speech and political freedom granted there.

Once back in the Dutch East Indies his writing became even more “radical”, and he was sentenced to a relatively heavy prison term of two years. The ’’Insulinde’’ party founded a committee and fund to support Mas Marco, his family and other persecuted activists.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelis Dijk, C., van Dijk, K. ‘’The Netherlands Indies and the Great War 1914-1918’’ (Publisher: KITLV Press, 2007)  P.467&lt;/ref&gt;

==Insulinde &amp; the ISDV==
Dutch communist leader [[Henk Sneevliet]] co-founder of the ISDV, who had arrived in Java in 1913 initially believed ‘’Insulinde’‘ could be an effective vehicle to disseminate the socialist ideals and agenda in the colony. Some members of the [[ISDV]] (predecessor of the Indonesian Communist Party) however felt that Insulinde was waging a “race struggle” rather than a “class struggle” and called [[Ernest Douwes Dekker|E.F.E. Douwes Dekker]],  a “nationalist anarchist” rather than a “social democrat”.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelis Dijk, C., van Dijk, K. ‘’The Netherlands Indies and the Great War 1914-1918’’ (Publisher: KITLV Press, 2007) P.485&lt;/ref&gt;

In its political struggle Insulinde was allied to the Sarekat Islam and ISDV, organizing protest rallies and meetings attended by thousands. Cooperation with the ISDV was ended in 1917 on the grounds that Insulinde believed that the Dutch leadership of that party was trying to drive a wedge between the Indigenous and Indo people.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelis Dijk, C., van Dijk, K. ‘’The Netherlands Indies and the Great War 1914-1918’’ (Publisher: KITLV Press, 2007) P.480&lt;/ref&gt;

In the end both the authorities and public opinion considered the Marxist aims of the ISDV to uproot and transform world order, more dangerous and extreme than Insulinde's aim for independence.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelis Dijk, C., van Dijk, K. ‘’The Netherlands Indies and the Great War 1914-1918’’ (Publisher: KITLV Press, 2007)  P.481&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rise==
Under the guidance of former IP leader [[Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo|Tjipto]], who due to health reasons had returned early from exile, the party flourished. In 1917 Insulinde gained a large majority at the council elections of the colonial capital Batavia. In both Semarang and Ambon city Ambonese political activists joined the party. Insulinde was the first political organization obtaining a serious foothold in the Moluccas. By June 1919 Insulinde had a membership of 17,000 members and was well represented in the [[Volksraad (Dutch East Indies)]] where it maintained close ties with [[Budi Utomo]] and the [[Sarekat Islam]].

==Renamed NIP==
With the return from exile of the other two former IP leaders Douwes Dekker and [[Ki Hajar Dewantara|Soewardi Soerjaningrat]] the party decided to rekindle the IP's nationalist flame and renamed itself the Nationale Indische Party (NIP), National Indies Party in 1919. Again the colonial authorities thwarted any possibility for the NIP to become a mass movement by arresting NIP leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Bosma U., Raben R. ''Being "Dutch" in the Indies: a history of creolisation and empire, 1500–1920'' (University of Michigan, NUS Press, 2008) {{ISBN|9971-69-373-9}} P.333 [https://books.google.com/books?id=47wCTCJX9X4C&amp;dq=Carel+Pieter+Brest+van+Kempen&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s]&lt;/ref&gt;

When NIP membership numbers dropped, many of its Indo-European members joined the 1919 established [[Indo Europeesch Verbond|Indo European Alliance]] (IEV), founded by Douwes Dekker's former colleague, friend and associate [[Karel Zaalberg]].

The ''National Indies Party'' (NIP) became a predecessor of [[Sukarno]]'s ''Indonesian National Party'' (PNI).

He received an education in Journalism and Communication at [[Wright State University]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=ashoka&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashoka.org/fellow/2550|title=Javed Abidi Profile at 'Ashoka: Innovators for the Public'|publisher=|accessdate=5 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He set up the [[disability]] wing of the [[Rajiv Gandhi Foundation]] in India, after being invited to do so by [[Sonia Gandhi]].&lt;ref name=ashoka/&gt;

==Early life==
Abidi was born on 11 June 1965&lt;ref&gt;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/jnudpa/-OWJT9xwlyc&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Aligarh, Uttar Pradesh]]. He was born with [[spina bifida]]. Abidi first had surgery at the age of eight to treat his spina bifida. As a result, he suffered nerve damage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He required another surgery at the age of 10 after an injury from a fall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He moved with his family to the [[United States]]. After their move to the United States, Abidi received medical care at the [[Boston Children's Hospital]] and the [[Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago]]. Abidi began using a wheelchair at age fifteen.

Abidi studied at Wright State University. In 1989, he moved to India to pursue a career in journalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/How-Change-World-Entrepreneurs-Updated/dp/0195334760|title=How to Change the World: Social Entrepreneurs and the Power of New Ideas, Updated Edition|first=David|last=Bornstein|date=17 September 2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=5 March 2018|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in disability awareness==
In 1993, he started working for Sonia Gandhi, creating and building the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation's Disabilities Unit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.147.244.195/~neilpete/index.php/2010/01/javed-abidi-giving-visibility-and-hope-to-indias-disabled/]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Javed Abidi joined a small advocate group called the Disability Rights Group and started raising awareness for the disabled people of India. A large pro-disability rights movement arose, with the goal of getting the [[Parliament of India]] to implement a bill of rights for the disabled. Javed Abidi led a protest before Parliament on 19 December 1995. The protest pushed Parliament into passing the [[Persons with Disabilities Act]]&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/a/nileshsingit.org/indian-disability-laws/disability-legislation-in-india&lt;/ref&gt; on 22 December 1995. In 2004, his letter to Chief Justice of India addressed the accessibility of polling booths for persons with disabilities. [[Supreme Court of India]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Will India’s elections ever be disabled-friendly?|url=http://www.dnis.org/print_features.php?features_id=96|newspaper=D.N.I.S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in the NCPEDP==
The [[Rajiv Gandhi Foundation]] created the [[National Centre for Promotion of Employment for Disabled People]] in 1995 and appointed Abidi as its director. Abidi collaborated with business executives from [[IBM]], [[Apple Inc.]], [[Oracle Corporation]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Microsoft]], and [[Hewlett-Packard]] to employ disabled individuals in these companies and in the high-tech industry in general. In 2000,  Abidi urged the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] to install wheelchair ramps at various prominent monuments, including the [[Red Fort]], [[Qutub Minar]], [[Humayun's Tomb]], and [[Jantar Mantar]]. The impetus for the ramps was to accommodate [[Stephen Hawking]] while he visited these sites. For the next two years, Abidi and the NCPEDP focused on accessibility for the disabled, publishment of disability issues, and work opportunities for the disabled.

==Death==
Abidi died on 4 March 2018 from a chest infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-43283337|title=Tributes paid to India disability activist|date=2018-03-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2018-03-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Henry Wilson''' (December 15, 1871 &amp;ndash; July 3, 1956), was a [[civil engineer]], [[insurgent]], co-founder of the [[Democratic Party of Hawaii]], and [[Mayor of Honolulu|Mayor]] of [[Honolulu, Hawaii]] three times:  from 1920 to 1927, from 1929 to 1931, and from 1946 to 1954.

==Early years==
Wilson was born in [[Honolulu]], [[Hawaii]] in 1871. His father was [[Charles B. Wilson]] (1850–1926), whose ethnic background was [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Tahitians|Tahitian]]. C.B. Wilson was superintendent of the water works and fire chief under [[Kalākaua|King Kalākaua]], and was Marshal of the Kingdom under [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH0169/b46db112.dir/Wilson,%20Charles%20B.jpg |title=Wilson, Charles B. office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate=2010-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306202740/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH0169/b46db112.dir/Wilson%2C%20Charles%20B.jpg |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
His mother was three quarters of European descent and one quarter [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian]] Eveline M. "Kitty or Kittie" Townsend, granddaughter of Captain [[Henry Blanchard]] of the ship ''Thaddeus'' which had brought the first missionaries of the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]] to Hawaii in 1820.

Wilson attended the Fort Street School and St. Alban's College. After graduating, he worked odd jobs on the West Coast, Hawaii, and Alaska. A construction job that he took in 1890 with [[Oahu Railway and Land Company|Oahu Railway &amp; Land]] led him to pursue civil engineering as a career.  With financial support from the Queen, he enrolled at [[Stanford University]] in 1891. However, lack of funds after the overthrow of the monarchy in 1893 forced him to leave Stanford in 1894. While on the [[Contiguous United States|mainland]] he was approached by revolutionaries looking for suppliers for the [[1895 Counter-Revolution in Hawaii]], and attempt to restore the monarchy. He took part in the [[Arms trafficking|smuggling of guns and ammunition]] to [[Maui]] as part of the arms buildup by rebel forces. After the failed revolution he spoke little about his role in fearing he would be arrested for treason. He admitted he smuggled guns and was of rank to participate in planning his mission. He planned to [[Landing operation|land a ship]] of insurgents from Maui to attack Honolulu, but was the mission was aborted after the revolution was exposed and martial law was activated.

In 1896 he once again joined Oahu Railway &amp; Land and worked on a survey for a carriage road over the [[Nuuanu Pali|Nu{{okina}}uanu Pali]]. Armed with this knowledge, he and fellow Stanford student Louis Whitehouse bid for and won the contract to build the road, completing the road in January 1898.

==Political career==
Wilson served as roads engineer for both Maui and Honolulu counties. He was in a meeting on April 30, 1900 that organized the [[Democratic Party of Hawaii]]. He married [[hula]] practitioner [[Kini Kapahu]] on May 8, 1909. They moved to [[Molokaʻi]] and lived in the Pelekunu Valley before returning to Honolulu in 1919.&lt;ref name="WiWH"&gt;{{cite book|first=Gillian S. |last=Holmes|editor1-last=Commire|editor1-first=Anne|title=Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia|date=2002|publisher=Yorkin Publications|location=Waterford, Connecticut|isbn=0-7876-4074-3|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-2591309931.html|chapter=Wilson, Kini (1872–1962)|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first political campaign was for a seat in the Territorial Senate in 1918, which he lost.  However, upon the death of Mayor [[Joseph J. Fern]] in 1920, Wilson was selected by the Board of Supervisors to succeed him.

Wilson served three times as mayor, from 1920 to 1927, 1929 to 1931, and from 1946 to 1954, a total of 19 years. As mayor, Wilson oversaw the completion of [[Honolulu Hale]], which was completed in 1929 and consolidated the functions of the city's government. He also served on some territorial commissions, including coordinating the state holiday, [[Kamehameha Day]], until 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH019b/0e4d1cfe.dir/Wilson,%20John%20H.jpg  |title= Wilson, John H. office record |work=state archives digital collections |publisher=state of Hawaii |accessdate=2010-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following World War II Wilson considered retirement he had been ''de facto'' leader of the Democratic Party of the original five founders only two remained. [[David Kawānanakoa]] died in 1908, [[John S. McGrew]] died in 1911, and [[Charles J. McCarthy]] died in 1929. [[Delbert E. Metzger]] was a [[Federal Judge]] and powerful Democrat but his judicial career reduced his participation in politics this left Wilson as leader. Wilson preferred to leave the party in good hands. An ambitious detective named [[John A. Burns]] emerged as a successor Wilson could pass the torch to.

In his 80s, Wilson was once again a revolutionary as a key member of a [[nonviolent revolution]] called the [[Democratic Revolution of 1954 (Hawaii)|Democratic Revolution of 1954]] that brought his party to power. The early Democrats held a dislike toward [[Asian-American]]s as threats to Hawaiians and the social demographics of Hawaii. But unlike his colleagues, Wilson himself an early Democrat and part-Hawaiian, allowed passage of [[442nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|442nd]] veterans into the party, such as [[Daniel Inouye]] and [[Spark Matsunaga]]. He lived long enough to see the party that had overthrown the monarchy be dethroned themselves, and to some extent accomplishing what he failed in 1895. During this turbulent time Democrats were divided between [[right-wing]] "Walkouts" led by [[Ingram Stainback]] and the [[left-wing]] "Standpats" led by Burns, Wilson was a Standpat. A damaging letter written by Wilson criticizing non-Hawaii-born Democrats alluding to Stainback was considered the major factor in his loss to Republican [[Neal Blaisdell]].

During the late 1950s, Wilson advocated that the territorial government build a tunnel through the Ko{{okina}}olau Mountains from Honolulu to Kaneohe through Kalihi Valley.  The territorial government, however, opted to build the tunnel through the Nu{{okina}}uanu Pali.  The city eventually proceeded with plans to build a second set of tunnels through Kalihi Valley, which opened in 1961, five years after Wilson's death.  The tunnels were named the John H. Wilson Tunnels in his honor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10591">'''Konda''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Конда}}, {{floruit}} March 1804–d. May/June 1807) was an Ottoman Greek mercenary in [[Alija Gušanac]]'s [[Dahije]] detachment in the [[Sanjak of Smederevo]] who switched sides to the Serb rebels during the [[First Serbian Uprising]], proclaimed a hero for his efforts in the [[Siege of Belgrade (1806)]].

Konda, an Orthodox Christian, was according to his contemporary, Triantafyllos Doukas, born in the frontier of [[Ioannina]] in [[Epirus]] (now [[Greece]]).{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|p=102}} According to some, he was [[Greek-Aromanian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mitološki zbornik|volume=7-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PSQkAQAAIAAJ|year=2002|publisher=Centar za mitološki studije Srbije|page=35|quote=Многи Грко-Цинцари су дошли у Србију са Гушанцем као крхалије, па су касније пришли устаницима.

In March 1804, with Gušanac's forces, Konda had gone to the [[Morava (river)|Morava]], around [[Ćuprija]], and from there to the city of Belgrade where he stayed until prior to autumn 1806.{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|p=102}} At that time, he had the rank of ''[[bölükbaşı]]'' (captain).{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|p=102}} Konda joined the Serb rebels three months prior to the siege of Belgrade which took place on 30 November (St. Andrew's Day).{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|p=102}} He received the rank of ''[[bimbaša]]'' (major) in the rebel army, hence, is known as '''Konda Bimbaša''' (Конда Бимбаша) in historiography.
 [[File:Siege of Belgrade (30 Nov. 1806).jpg|thumb|Illustration of Belgrade during the siege. The Sava Gate, taken over by Konda and Uzun-Mirko, is the southernmost gate, by the Sava river.]]
The plan of penetrating the town of Belgrade, through taking over the Sava, Varoš, Stambol and Vidin gates (see [[Gates of Belgrade]]), was presented by Konda to Karađorđe. Konda, well aware of the functioning of the Ottoman guard, took the leadership over volunteers to take over the Sava gate, accompanied by [[Uzun-Mirko]]. Karađorđe decided with the commanders that the attack be carried out on St. Andrew Day, during [[Eid al-Fitr]], when the attention of the guards was lower. Rebel colons were set on each gate, to storm after the gate was taken, commanded by [[Miloje Petrović]], [[Sima Marković]], [[Vasa Čarapić]], [[Stanoje Glavaš]] and [[Vule Ilić]]. At the estimated time, Konda, Uzun-Mirko, Petar Sremac, Nikola Stambolija, Karlovalija, Dragić and Mladen headed out, followed by a detachment of volunteers, and then the main colon of Miloje Petrović. Since they arrived unnoticed at the gate, Konda and Uzun-Mirko first climbed the rampart and jumped over the palisade and headed towards the guards on a bypassing road. Met by an Ottoman patrol, they presented themselves as krdžalije, then proceeded to the town gates and guards where they divided into two groups. Uzun-Mirko and Konda attacked the guards, and the rest broke into the gate locks with axes. In the fight, Uzun-Mirko received two wounds, and Konda five, but they kept on. Even though shots were fired, the Turks in the town and at the rest of the gates did not suspect that a Serbian attack was in question, but that shots were fired for the holiday. After taking over the first gates, commandos went toward the Varoš Gate, at which time the Turks were alarmed. Most of the Turks tried to reach the Upper Fortress ([[Kalemegdan]]), while the resistance was provided by the krdžalije. Uzun-Mirko and Konda also fought on the Varoš Gate, while Vasa Čarapić died taking over the Stambol Gate, and Stanoje Glavaš and Vule Ilić penetrated through the Vidin Gate, after which the rebels easily took over the town towards Kalemegdan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kosta Protić|title=Ratni događaji iz Prvog srpskog ustanka 1804—1813 pod voždom Karađorđem Petrovićem|location=Beograd|year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another account, mentioned by Petar Jokić, Konda and Uzun-Mirko first entered a [[caravanserai]] (inn) prior to the attack, as they knew Turkish they were unsuspicious; their fighters, not knowing that their leaders were not present, while approaching the rampart entered a conflict with Turks, at which time Konda and Uzun-Mirko fought the Turks in the inn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kazivanja o srpskom ustanku 1804|editor=Dragana Samardžić|location=Beograd|year=1980|page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking over Belgrade, Konda looked after his wounds in the former shelter of ''dahija'' [[Aganlija]].{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|p=103}} After recuperating, he returned to the battlefield.{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|p=103}} Konda fell at the [[Battle of Loznica (1807)]] (as mentioned by Doukas and [[Dositej Obradović]]).{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|p=105}} M. Đ. Milićević at first supported this in his work ''Kneževina Srbija'', but then changed it and claimed that Konda survived the battle, in his work ''Pomenik''.{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|pp=103–104}}

According to Andra Gavrilović, Konda's identity was confused with that of another rebel, Jovča Mihailović "Konda" ({{floruit}} 1807–13), and possibly more individuals; in that way "the hero of Belgrade" became a legendary person.{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|pp=108, 110}} Milićević included a story in which Konda died after 1820. "Konda" fought at Užice and Loznica (1807),{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|p=103}} and lived in Belgrade in 1808 according to two contemporary documents,{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|p=110}} and was mentioned as organizing war necessarities along with Raka Levajac in 1812,{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|p=107}} and left Serbia for Austria in 1813 following the suppression of the revolt, and after a short while moved to [[Bessarabia]] where he lived as an outlaw.{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|pp=108–109}} Gavrilović was the first to critically study Milićević's accounts on Konda.{{sfn|Perović|1954a|p=329}} R. Perović also mentioned a story that Konda was an Orthodox named Toma and was born in [[Lom, Bulgaria|Lom-Palanka]], in the Vidin Pashaluk,{{sfn|Perović|1954b|p=54}}&lt;!-- КОНДА БИМБАША Овај врли јунак и витез Конда, бимбаша звани, уколико сам ја дознати могао, родом је из Лом-Паланке, Видинског пашалука, вере је православне и назван је у светом крштењу Тома. У ...--&gt; similarly found in Milićević's account on the birthplace of "Konda".{{sfn|Gavrilović|1904|p=102}}

In composer Svetomir Nastasijević's opera ''The First Uprising'', written in 1954, Konda is included among the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Светомир Настасијевић|title=Први устанак (либрето)|url=http://www.rastko.rs/muzika/delo/10570}}&lt;/ref&gt; A street in Belgrade bears his name (''Kondina ulica'').

George Keister (b. 1847), professor of Hebrew and Church History in [[United Theological Seminary]], [[Dayton, Ohio]], from 1875. They had no children. The early death, in August 1880,{{sfn|Bonebrake Theological Seminary|1913|p=44}} of her husband opened the way to her broader usefulness in church work. The church of her choice, the United Brethren in Christ, organized the Woman's Missionary Association in 1875, of which she was corresponding secretary for the first year. The work of the society grew and, in 1881, it called for the full time of one woman as its corresponding secretary and to establish and edit its organ, the ''Woman's Evangel''. Keister was the available woman well-qualified for the responsible position. She was unanimously elected, holding the position in 1875-76 and 1881-1893.{{sfn|Frey|2007|p=74}} Besides the work on the paper, much of her time was spent giving public addresses.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=430}}

Keister traveled a lot. One year, she traveled in association work over {{convert|12000|miles}} in the United States. Twice, she went on short trips abroad, first in 1884, when the illness of her sister studying in Germany called her there, and again in 1888, when she was one of two delegates sent by the Woman's Missionary Association to the World's Missionary Conference in London.{{sfn|Willard|Livermore|1893|p=431}}

On June 14, 1893, she married William P. Harford (1834-1910).{{sfn|Fire Underwriters' Association of the Northwest|1911|p=184}}

She has produced three television specials for PBS and won the [[Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award]] in 2002 in the entertainment category.

Ma was a [[Muslim]] and was born in [[Zhejiang]]'s [[Kuaiji Commandery]], an area within the modern borders of [[Shaoxing]]. He knew several Classical Chinese and Buddhist texts. He learned Arabic to be able to translate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jJY3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA849&amp;dq=hui+muslims+chinese+new+year&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NCeOTc6qLpS80QHZ3aWjCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hui%20muslims%20chinese%20new%20year&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Islam, Volumes 1–5|author=Sir H.

In the 1413 expedition (the 4th), he visited [[Champa]], [[Java (island)|Java]], [[Sumatra]], [[Palembang]], [[Siam]], [[Kochi, India|Kochi]] and [[Ormus|Hormuz]].

In the 1421 expedition, he visited [[Malacca]], [[Sultanate of Deli|Aru]], [[Sumatra]], [[Trincomalee]], [[Ceylon]], Kochi, [[Kozhikode|Calicut]], [[Zufar]] and Hormuz.

In the 1431 expedition, he visited [[Bengal]], [[Chittagong]], [[Sonargaon]], [[Gauḍa (city)|Gaur]] and Calicut. From Calicut, he was sent by Eununch [[Hong Bao]] as emissary to [[Mecca]].

During his expeditions, Ma Huan took notes about the geography, politics, weather conditions, environment, economy, local customs, even method of punishment for criminals. Returned home on his first expedition, he began writing a book about his expedition, the first draft of which was ready around 1416. He expanded and modified his draft during later expeditions, the final version was ready around 1451. The title of his book was ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'' (The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores).

During the [[Ming dynasty]] and [[Qing dynasty]], there were many printed and handcopied editions. The latest authentic text of a printed version was edited and annotated by historian {{ill|Feng Chengjun|zh|馮承鈞}}. A newer edition, based on Ming dynasty handcopied editions, was recently published by Ocean Publishing House in China.

An annotated English translation by [[J.V.G. Mills]] (1887–1987) was published by the [[Hakluyt Society]] in 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2053070 Book review by Jung-pang Lo]&lt;/ref&gt; and reprinted in 1997 by The White Lotus Press in Bangkok. Mills's translation was based on the edition by Feng Cheng jun.

The ''Yingya Shenglan'' is considered by sinologists worldwide as a primary source for the history of Ming dynasty naval exploration, history of [[South East Asia]] and [[history of India]].

Some scholars who have done research work on Ma Huan are J.J.L. Duyvendak, F. Hirth, [[Paul Pelliot]], [[Feng Chengjun]], [[Xiang Da]], [[J.V.G. Mills]].

'''Marassa Jumeaux''' are the divine twins in [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]]. They are children, but more ancient than any other [[loa]]. "Love, truth and justice. Directed by reason. Mysteries of liaison between earth and heaven and they personify astronomic-astrological learning. They synthesize the vodou Loa as personification of divine power and the human impotence. Double life, they have considerable power which allow them manage people through the stomach. They are children mysteries."&lt;ref&gt;Rigaud, Milo. ''Voodoo Diagrams &amp; Rituals'', Trilingual edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marassa are somewhat different from standard Loa, both on a level above them, and counted in their number, they are both twins, and yet they number three, they are male and female, and both male and both female - an example of the Haitian worldview's capacity to retain two seemingly contradictory concepts. In some houses they are not channelled through possession in Vodou ritual, but served first after Legba. 

The Marassa are commonly [[syncretism|syncretised]] with the Catholic [[Saints Cosmas and Damian]].

The '''Meratus Dayak''' inhabit the [[Meratus Mountains]] of [[South Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]]. The [[Banjar people|Banjar]] Kuala people would refer the Meratus people as '''Urang Baiju''' or '''Dayak Baiju''', as they consider them to be the same as the [[Ngaju people]]. While the [[Banjar people|Banjar]] Hulu Sungai people would call the Meratus people as '''Urang Bukit''', '''Dayak Bukit''' or '''Dayak Buguet'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=|title=The Monthly Repository (And Review)|year=1822|publisher=Universitas Oxford|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johannes Jacobus Ras|title=[[Hikayat Banjar|Hikajat Bandjar]]: A Study In Malay Historiography|year=1966|publisher=Hans Ras|oclc=1207982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Naming==
A Meratus Dayak's name changes over the course of his or her life. Children have "body names" (''ngaran badan'') that are not usually used after adolescence. When they have children, men and women acquire [[teknonym]]s (''ngaran ba'anak''). For a man this name is ''Ma'' X or ''Pa'an'' X, where X is the name of one of his children, or sometimes another word. For a woman it is ''Induan'' X or ''Dun'' X, depending on which part of the Meratus area she lives in. Older men become ''Awat'' X (grandfather of X) and older women become ''Apih'' X.&lt;ref name="Tsing"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anna Lowenhaupt Tsing|title=In the Realm of the Diamond Queen: Marginality in an Out-of-the-way Place|year=1993|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-6910-0051-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
Local Meratus Dayak dialects are closely related linguistically to both [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] (the national language), and to the [[Banjar language|Banjar]] language. Most Meratus Dayak can speak Banjar and Indonesian since government administrators conduct business in Indonesian and trade with the [[Banjar people]] is conducted in Banjar.

==Sub-ethnics==
The Meratus people are divided into several sub-ethnics including:-
* Dayak Pitap people
* Dayak Alai people
** Dayak Labuhan people
** Dayak Atiran people
** Dayak Kiyu people
** Dayak Juhu people
* Dayak Hantakan (Dayak Bukit) people
* Dayak Labuan Amas people
* Dayak Loksado (Dayak Amandit) people
* Dayak Harakit (Dayak Tapin) people
* Dayak Paramasan people
* Dayak Kayu Tangi people
* Dayak Bangkalaan people
* Dayak Sampanahan people
* Dayak Riam Adungan people
* Dayak Bajuin people
* Dayak Sembamban Baru people
* and many more

==Culture==
===Dance===
* Gintur Dadas dance, a ritualistic dance practiced by the Dayak Meratus Halong people to summon ancestral spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kalsel.prokal.co/read/news/5824-inilah-tarian-khas-dayak-meratus-halong-tarian-memanggil-roh.html |title=Inilah Tarian Khas Dayak Meratus Halong, Tarian Memanggil Roh |author= |publisher=Pro Kalsel |date=13 October 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Batandik, a dance performed to summon ancestral spirits during the Aruh Baharin ritual.&lt;ref name="TMDB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalgeographic.co.id/berita/2015/11/tarian-mistik-dayak-balanghan/1 |title=Tarian Mistik Dayak Balanghan |author=Ahmad Fauzi |publisher=National Geographic Indonesia |date=27 November 2015 |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rituals===
* Aruh Baharin, a ritual also practiced by the Buddhist majority Dayak Balanghan people to close the paddy farming season after the completion of harvesting the field.&lt;ref name="TMDB"/&gt;

==Economy==
Meratus Dayak are primarily farmers, and rice is the main crop. [[Rice cultivation]] occurs in [[swidden]]s (cleared portions of the forest). Swiddens are usually cultivated for a few years, then the forest is allowed to regenerate when the farmers move to a different swidden location to farm. The farmers may return to a swidden, although there is usually at least 15 years between leaving and returning to a swidden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/umum/13/11/02/mvn57k-menanam-padi-di-meratus-panen-hari-ini-untuk-kebutuhan-belasan-tahun-nanti |title=Menanam Padi di Meratus, Panen Hari Ini untuk Kebutuhan Belasan Tahun Nanti |author=Priyantono Oemar |publisher=Republika |date=2 November 2013 |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meratus people also collect forest products and trade with Banjar at markets outside the mountains. In these transactions Banjar typically act as middle men between the Meratus and other traders.

==Social organization==
Most Meratus live and farm in ''umbun'' which are also considered the primary [[social unit]]s among the Meratus Dayak. ''Umbun'' are founded by a man and a woman, usually a married couple, but sometimes also a brother and sister, a widow and her adult son, or other male-female pairs. ''Umbun'' also embrace a variety of dependents who have not yet founded their own ''umbun'', including children and recently married, disabled, and widowed adults. The founding pair is responsible for the ''umbun''.&lt;ref name="Tsing"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor T. King; William D. Wilder|title=The Modern Anthropology of South-East Asia: An Introduction|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=0-4152-9751-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some Meratus have also been moved into villages by government resettlement programs. The Meratus are classified as a "semi-nomadic" isolated tribe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handcraftedfilms.net/the-dayak-meratus/ |title=The Dayak Meratus |author=Tim Lewis |publisher=Handcrafted Films |date=4 March 2011 |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are the target of government development programs as such.

On November 16, 2006, the [[interior minister]] of [[Iraq]], [[Jawad al-Bolani]], a [[Shi'ite]], announced that Dhari was wanted on a charge of inciting violence. "The government's policy is that anyone who tries to spread division and strife among the Iraq people will be chased by our security agencies." Muhammad replied on [[Al Jazeera]] television and stated, "The decisions of this government are worthless because it only rules the [[Green Zone]]."{{Citation needed|date= February 2012}}

[[Nani (actor)|Nani]] is an Indian film actor and producer who works predominantly in [[Telugu cinema]] and appears in a few [[Tamil language]] films. He made his acting debut with [[Mohan Krishna Indraganti]]{{'s}} 2008 comedy film ''[[Ashta Chamma]]'', an Indian adaptation of [[Oscar Wilde]]{{'s}} play ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2008/sep/01slid1.htm |title=Taking on Oscar Wilde! |last=Rajamani |first=Radhika |date=5 September 2008 |publisher=[[Rediff.com]] |archive-url=https://archive.is/20170715175152/http://specials.rediff.com/movies/2008/sep/01slid1.htm |archive-date=15 July 2017 |access-date=15 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''Ashta Chamma''{{'s}} commercial success,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/money/report/tollywood-gives-case-study-to-isb/20090813.htm |title=Tollywood gives case study to ISB |last=Mohan |first=B Krishna |date=13 August 2009 |publisher=Rediff.com |archive-url=https://archive.is/20170721104429/http://www.rediff.com/money/report/tollywood-gives-case-study-to-isb/20090813.htm |archive-date=21 July 2017 |access-date=21 July 2017 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nani played the lead roles in three Telugu films in the next two years: ''[[Ride (2009 film)|Ride]]'' (2009), ''[[Snehituda...]]'' (2009) and ''[[Bheemili Kabaddi Jattu]]'' (2010).

[[Bengali people|Bengali]] author and statesman [[Rabindranath Tagore]] was a poet, [[Brahmo]] philosopher, and cultural reformer. He lived during the long period of Indian independence and was acquainted with several political leaders in Asia.

== Politics ==
[[File:Gandhi Shantiniketan 1940.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Tagore (at right, on the dais) hosts [[Mahatma Gandhi]] and wife [[Kasturba Gandhi|Kasturba]] at [[Santiniketan]] in 1940.]]

Tagore's politics exhibited a marked ambivalence—on the one hand, he denounced European imperialism,&lt;ref name="Dutta_1997_127"&gt;{{Harv|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=127}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutta_1997_210"&gt;{{Harv|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=210}}.&lt;/ref&gt; occasionally voicing full support for Indian nationalists;&lt;ref name="Dutta_1995_304"&gt;{{Harv|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=304}}.&lt;/ref&gt; on the other hand, he also shunned the [[Swadeshi movement]], denouncing it in his acrid September 1925 essay ''[[The Cult of the Charkha]]'' (an allusion to elements of [[Gandhism#Inspiring Struggle for Freedom|Gandhism]] and the [[Non-Cooperation Movement]]).&lt;ref name="Dutta_1995_261"&gt;{{Harv|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in reaction to a July 22, 1904 suggestion by the British that Bengal should be partitioned, an upset Tagore took to delivering a lecture—entitled "Swadeshi Samaj" ("The Union of Our Homeland")—that instead proposed an alternative solution: a self-help based comprehensive reorganization of rural Bengal.&lt;ref name="Chakravarty_1961_181"&gt;{{Harv|Chakravarty|1961|p=181}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he viewed British control of India as a "political symptom of our social disease", urging Indians to accept that "there can be no question of blind revolution, but of steady and purposeful education".&lt;ref name="Dutta_1997_239-240"&gt;{{Harv|Dutta|Robinson|1997|pp=239–240}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with this, Tagore denounced nationalism, deeming it among humanity's greatest problems. "A nation," he wrote, "... is that aspect which a whole population assumes when organized for a mechanical purpose", a purpose often associated with a "selfishness"  that "can be a grandly magnified form" of personal selfishness. During his extensive travels, he formed a vision of East-West unity. Subsequently, he was shocked by the rising nationalism found in Germany and other nations prior to the World War II. Tagore thus delivered a series of lectures on nationalism; although well-received throughout much of Europe, they were mostly ignored or criticized in Japan and the United States.

Yet Tagore wrote songs lionizing the [[Indian independence movement]]. On 30 May 1919, he renounced the knighthood that had been conferred upon him by Lord Hardinge in 1915 in protest against the [[Amritsar massacre]] (Jallianwallah Bagh), when British soldiers killed at least 379 unarmed civilians.&lt;ref name="Dutta_1995_215-216"&gt;{{Harv|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=215–216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also instrumental in resolving a dispute between Gandhi and [[B. R. Ambedkar|Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar]]; it involved Ambedkar's insistence on separate electorates for untouchables and Gandhi's announcement—in protest against the concession—of a fast "unto death" beginning on 20 September 1932.&lt;ref name="Dutta_1995_306-307"&gt;{{Harv|Dutta|Robinson|1995|pp=306–307}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dutta_1995_339"&gt;{{Harv|Dutta|Robinson|1995|p=339}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tagore also lashed out against the orthodox rote-oriented educational system introduced in India under the Raj.{{Ref_label|Education|λ|none}} He lampooned it in his short story "The Parrot's Training", where a bird—which ultimately dies—is caged by tutors and force-fed pages torn from books.&lt;ref name="Dutta_1997_267"&gt;{{Harv|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=267}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tagore_1918"&gt;{{Harv|Tagore|Pal|1918}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These views crystallised in his experimental school at Santiniketan, (শান্তিনিকেতন, "Abode of Peace"), founded in 1901 on the site of a [[West Bengal]] estate inherited from his father. Established in the traditional ''[[brahmacharya]]'' structure—whereby students live under a ''[[guru]]'' in a self-sustaining community—became a magnet for talented scholars, artists, linguists, and musicians from diverse backgrounds. Tagore spent prodigious amounts of energy fundraising for Santiniketan, even contributing all his Nobel Prize money.&lt;ref name="Roy_1977_175"&gt;{{Harv|Roy|1977|p=175}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Tagore's school is a Central University under the [[Government of India]].

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''λ.'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;{{Note_label|Education|λ|none}} Indeed, Tagore stated that “I suppose it was fortunate for me that I never in my life had what is called an education, that is to say, the kind of school and college training which is considered proper for a boy from a respectable family".&lt;ref name="Chakravarty_1961_83"&gt;{{Harv|Chakravarty|1961|p=83}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomatic career and previous postings==
With almost three decades of experience at the [[Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], Prosor has carved out an international reputation as one of Israel’s most distinguished diplomats. His overseas service also includes roles in Washington, Bonn, and London.

In 1986, he joined the staff of the Foreign Ministry and began fulfilling his duties in Israel's diplomatic missions throughout the world. During his service as a spokesman for the embassy in Bonn, he was one of the first Israeli representatives to establish ties with East Germany and, after its unification with West Germany, he worked to establish relations with the new federal states in its territory. He later served as the spokesman for the Israeli embassy in London. 

He became a political advisor to the Israeli Embassy in Washington (1998–2002) and participated in the Israeli delegation to the negotiations prior to the signing of the Wye Agreement and took part in the Camp David delegation in 2000. 

In the headquarters of the Foreign Ministry, he worked in the Western European Division, served as the spokesman for the ministry and served as the Head of the Foreign Ministry's diplomatic staff, as well as the Deputy Director-General of the Foreign Ministry.

Between 2004 and 2007 Prosor served as the Director General of the [[Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], overseeing the work of the Foreign Ministry during the [[disengagement from Gaza]] in 2005.

From 2007 and 2011, he served as [[List of Israeli ambassadors to the United Kingdom|Israel’s Ambassador to the United Kingdom]], where he earned plaudits for his articulate and forthright defense of Israel's position, publishing numerous articles throughout the British press and appearing on television outlets including the [[BBC]] and [[Sky News]]. He also addressed a wide range of audiences throughout the country, including universities and think tanks.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Finally, Prosor served as [[Permanent Representative of Israel to the United Nations|Israel's Permanent Representative]] to the [[United Nations]] from 2011 to 2015.

[[File:Prosor2.jpg|thumb|Ambassador Prosor Presents his credentials to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon]] Since becoming Israel’s Permanent Representative to the [[United Nations]], Prosor has continued to be an outspoken proponent for the State of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-1000656396 Ron Prosor profile], globes.co.il; accessed 12 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; A prolific writer and commentator, Prosor has published in leading international publications, including ''The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Newsweek and more''.&lt;ref&gt;"Tolerating Hamas Invites a Mideast War", ''The Wall Street Journal''; retrieved 8 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/israel/7474344/Commentary-The-response-to-Israels-announcement-is-disproportionate.html "The response to Israel's announcement is disproportionate"], telegraph.co.uk; accessed 2 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign policy positions==
Prosor is known as an outspoken diplomat and delivers speeches on a wide range of topics. He frequently publishes articles on a variety of international publications on Israel’s domestic policy and international status. He often attacks Hamas and seeks to raise awareness among the international community on the necessity to stop funding Hamas terrorist activities. In summer 2014, during the most recent conflict in Gaza, Prosor publicly accused Qatar of supporting terrorism.&lt;ref name="youtube1" /&gt;

===Israeli domestic policy===
He faults the Palestinian Authority for being unwilling to negotiate with Israel,&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mfa.gov.il/MFA/InternatlOrgs/Speeches/Pages/Amb-Prosor-addresses-UNGA-on-the-Question-of-Palestine-24-Nov-2014.aspx |title=Amb Prosor addresses UNGA on the Question of Palestine 24 Nov 2014 |publisher=Mfa.gov.il |date=2014-11-24 |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the European states which unilaterally recognized a Palestinian state, thus sending the message that "the Palestinian Authority can sit in a government with terrorists and incite violence against Israel without paying any price."&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"/&gt;

Moreover, Prosor defends a two-state solution&lt;ref name="voanews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/israel-un-ambassador-ron-prosor-speech-text/1555643.html |title=Full text of Israeli Amb. Ron Prosor's speech to the UN General Assembly |publisher=Voanews.com |date=2012-11-29 |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and calls on the international community to "encourage the Palestinians to enter into direct negotiations without preconditions in order to achieve a historical peace process in which a demilitarized Palestinian state will recognizes the Jewish state."&lt;ref name="voanews1"/&gt;

===Recognition of Israel===
On several occasions, Prosor has framed the recognition of Israel's statehood as an existential right for Israel and the Jewish people.&lt;ref name="theguardian1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Ron Prosor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/apr/20/taboo-arabs-israel-jewish-character |title=A taboo that harms Arabs too |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Prosor, failing to recognize Israel is the greatest obstacle to peace in the region.&lt;ref name="voanews1"/&gt; Therefore, he stressed the necessity for Arab states and the Palestinian Authority to recognize Israel.&lt;ref name="voanews1"/&gt;

In his speech to the UN General Assembly in November 2014, Prosor accused the international community of fueling the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by not understanding the history of the region.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"/&gt; He also blamed the Arab States for their wars against Israel, and concluded his address by acknowledging the necessity for the international community to choose between recognizing Israel as the nation-state of the Jewish people or allowing Palestine to deny Israel’s rightful claim to its land.&lt;ref name="autogeneratedil"/&gt;

In an op-ed published in the ''New York Times'' in March 2015, Prosor faulted the UN for singling out Israel on a variety of issues, for example, human rights, while not addressing more oppressive regimes.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/01/opinion/united-in-ignominy.html?_r=0|title=United in Ignominy|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He indeed accused the UN of tolerating "repressive regimes that violate human rights and undermine international security" to control the organization.&lt;ref name="nytimes1" /&gt; 

===Palestine and Hamas===
Prosor condemns Hamas’ brutal practices – from jailing women who remove their veils, to throwing political opponents from buildings, and promoting genocide in school and on TV, while pretending to be "moderate" and "reforming."&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/6088655/Hamas-is-leading-Palestine-down-the-road-of-carnage.html |title=Hamas is leading Palestine down the road of carnage |publisher=Telegraph |date= |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also complains about weapons smuggling over the Egyptian border, as well as other black market items.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt; Each of his commentaries lambastes Hamas for its use of rocket attacks and small-arms fire, which frequently kill civilians and destroy homes and buildings.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt;

In an article that appeared on ''The Telegraph'' in 2009, Prosor emphasized the failure of the international community to counter Hamas’ fundamentalism and violence against both Palestinians and Israelis.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt; He further argued that extremist regimes like Hamas pose a threat to the prosperity and stability of the Middle East.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt;

===Qatari financing and support of terrorism===
Interviewed in July 2014 by CBS reporter Pamela Falk on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in Gaza, Prosor claimed that Hamas’ "terror tunnels" were funded by Qatari money, and stressed the necessity to demilitarize the military infrastructure of Hamas towards the reconstruction of Gaza.&lt;ref name="youtube1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcFLIUHiQb4 |title=Israel's UN ambassador shares roadblocks to halting hostilities with Hamas |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-07-28 |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prosor compared Qatar’s support for Hamas to Iranian military support of terrorism against Israel and more generally in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="youtube1"/&gt; He further noted that Qatar’s and Egypt's support for Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood stood in contrast to other Arab nations and deepened cleavages in the region.&lt;ref name="youtube1"/&gt;

Furthermore, in his "Club Med for Terrorists" op-ed published in August 2014 in the ''New York Times'' entitled, "Club Med for Terrorists" Prosor alleged that Qatar sought to improve its global image by funding prominent foreign universities in Doha and hosting the 2022 World Cup while simultaneously supporting Hamas, al-Qaeda, and the Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/25/opinion/qatar-club-med-for-terrorists.html?_r=0|title=Qatar Club Med for Terrorists|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed that "hundreds of millions of dollars" of Qatari funds "funneled" to Gaza have ended up in the hands of Hamas, and noted that Qatar "harbors leading Islamist radicals," including Sheikh [[Yusuf al-Qaradawi]] (spiritual leader of the Muslim Brotherhood), Abdul Rahman Omeir al-Naimi (designated by the US as a terrorist financier of al-Qaeda), and Khaled Meshal (the leader of Hamas).&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;

In particular, Prosor denounced Qatar’s intention to play "a starring role in any cease-fire agreement between Hamas and Israel".&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt; In fact, the diplomat argued that Qatar threatened to expel Khaled Meshal – whose uncompromising refusal to recognize Israel has been an obstacle to reaching a peace deal – if "Hamas accepted Egyptian proposals for a long-term cease-fire in Gaza."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jack Khoury |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/1.611625 |title=Report: Qatar Threatened to Expel Meshal if He Agreed to Cairo Truce Draft Diplomacy and Defense Haaretz Daily Newspaper Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2014-08-20 |accessdate=2015-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prosor concluded the op-ed by calling on Western nations to confront Qatar and demand that it stops financing Hamas.&lt;ref name="nytimes2"/&gt;

'''Salama Hijazi ''' (الشيخ سلامة حجازي), born 1852, died October 4, 1917 was an Egyptian singer. He was a pioneer of [[musical theatre]] in [[Egypt]] in the first half of the 20th century.

Born Salama Ibrahim Hijazi, he was known as Sheikh Salama. In 1852 in Shiben El Kom, El Mnofia, he recited the [[Qur'an]], after memorising the entire book.

Many famous singers in Egypt, such as Munira Mahdia and [[Mohamed Abdel Wahab]], have sung his music. He promoted [[Sayed Darwish]], who considered him an inspiration.

[[Iskandar Farah]] and Salama founded a theater company in 1891.

In 1914, with [[George Abiad]], he helped in the formation of a new group and they worked together until his death, despite being paralyzed at the end of his days he continued to appear on stage. He has been credited with many forms of musical theatre and operetta music.

'''Simón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar Palacios Ponte y Blanco'''{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=9}} ({{IPA-es|siˈmon boˈliβaɾ|lang|Simon Bolivar-es.ogg}};&lt;ref&gt;In isolation, ''Simón'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|siˈmon|}}, and that is the pronunciation in the recording.&lt;/ref&gt; 24 July 1783 – 17 December 1830), generally known as '''Simón Bolívar''' and also colloquially as ''[[libertadores|El Libertador]]'',&lt;ref&gt;''El Libertador: Writings of Simón Bolívar'', ed. [[David Bushnell]]. New York: Oxford University Press 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Venezuelan]] military and political leader who liberated what are currently the republics of [[Venezuela]], [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]] and [[Peru]]  as sovereign states, independent of the [[Spanish Empire]].

Bolívar was born into a wealthy, aristocratic [[Criollo people|Criollo]] family and, as was common for the heirs of upper-class families in his day, was sent to be educated abroad at a young age, arriving in [[Spain]] when he was 16 and later moving to [[France]]. While in [[Europe]], he was introduced to the ideas of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], which later motivated him to overthrow the reigning Spanish in colonial South America. Taking advantage of the disorder in Spain prompted by the [[Peninsular War]], Bolívar began his [[Spanish American wars of independence|campaign for independence]] in 1808.&lt;ref name=LITofPROP&gt;{{cite book|last1=ed|first1=Thomas Riggs,|title=The literature of propaganda.|date=2013|publisher=St. James Press|location=Detroit [u.a.]|isbn=9781558628595|pages=153–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign for the independence of [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]] was consolidated with the victory at the [[Battle of Boyacá]] on 7 August 1819. Later he established an organized national congress within three years. Despite a number of hindrances, including the arrival of an unprecedentedly large Spanish expeditionary force, the revolutionaries eventually prevailed, culminating in the [[Patriot (Spanish American Independence)|patriot]] victory at the [[Battle of Carabobo]] in 1821, which effectively made Venezuela an independent country.

Following this triumph over the [[Monarchy of Spain|Spanish monarchy]], Bolívar participated in the foundation of the first union of independent nations in Latin America, [[Gran Colombia]], of which he was president from 1819 to 1830. Through further military campaigns, he ousted Spanish rulers from Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia, the last of which was named after him. He was simultaneously president of Gran Colombia (present-day Venezuela, Colombia, Panama and Ecuador) and Peru, while his second-in-command, [[Antonio José de Sucre]], was appointed president of Bolivia. Bolívar aimed at a strong and united Spanish America able to cope not only with the threats emanating from Spain and the European Holy Alliance but also with the emerging power of the [[United States]]. At the peak of his power, Bolívar ruled over a vast territory from the [[Argentina|Argentine]] border to the [[Caribbean Sea]].

Bolívar is viewed as a [[Father of the Nation|national icon]] in much of modern South America, and is considered one of the great heroes of the [[Hispanic]] independence movements of the early 19th century, along with [[José de San Martín]], [[Francisco de Miranda]] and others. Towards the end of his life, Bolívar despaired of the situation in his native region, with the famous quote "all who served the revolution have plowed the sea".&lt;ref name=Arana/&gt;{{rp|450}} In an address to the Constituent Congress of the Republic of Colombia, Bolívar stated "Fellow citizens! I blush to say this: Independence is the only benefit we have acquired, to the detriment of all the rest."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in [[Jeremy Adelman]], "Independence in Latin America" in ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History'', José C. Moya, ed. New York: Oxford University Press 2011, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family history==

===Origin of Bolívar surname===
[[File:Casa natal del Libertador.JPG|thumb|The [[Birthplace of Simón Bolívar]] in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]] (now a museum)]]
[[File:Juan Vicente Bolívar.jpg|thumb|An 18th-century portrait of Juan Vicente Bolívar y Ponte, the father of Simón Bolívar]]

The surname ''Bolívar'' originated with [[Spanish nobility|aristocrats]] from [[Cenarruza-Puebla de Bolívar|La Puebla de Bolívar]], a [[Ziortza-Bolibar|small village]] in the [[Basque Country (historical territory)|Basque Country]] of Spain.&lt;ref name="guiabizkaia" /&gt; Bolívar's father came from the female line of the Ardanza family.&lt;ref name="geneall" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lahAbout" /&gt; His maternal grandmother was descended from families from the [[Canary Islands]].{{efn|name=Guanche blood}}

===16th century===
The Bolívars settled in Venezuela in the [[16th century]]. Bolívar's first South American ancestor was Simón de Bolívar (or Simon de Bolibar; the [[Spanish orthography|spelling]] was not standardized until the [[19th century]]), who lived and worked in [[Captaincy General of Santo Domingo|Santo Domingo]] (the present-day [[Dominican Republic]]) from 1559 to 1560 and where his son Simón de Bolívar y Castro was born. When the governor was reassigned to Venezuela by the Spanish Crown in 1569, Simón de Bolívar went with him. As an early settler in Spain's [[Venezuela Province]], he became prominent in the local society, and he and his descendants were granted [[Plantation|estates]], [[encomienda]]s, and positions in the local [[cabildo (council)|cabildo]].{{sfn|Slatta|de Grummond|2003|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sEWHt-o8IdkC&amp;pg=PA10 10–11]}}

When [[Caracas Cathedral]] was built in 1569, the Bolívar family had one of the first dedicated side chapels. The majority of the wealth of Simón de Bolívar's descendants came from the estates. The most important was a sugar [[plantation]] with an [[encomienda]] that provided the labor needed to run the estate.{{sfn|Masur|1969|pp=21–22}} Another portion of the Bolívars' wealth came from [[silver]], [[gold]], and [[copper]] mines. Small gold deposits were first mined in Venezuela in 1669, leading to the discovery of much more extensive copper deposits. From his mother's side (the Palacios family), Bolívar inherited the [[Aroa copper mines]] at [[Yaracuy|Cocorote]]. [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[African diaspora|African]] slaves provided the majority of the labor in these mines.{{sfn|Thornton|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=AVZDHeVEeywC&amp;pg=PA277 277]}}

===17th century===
Toward the end of the [[17th century]], copper mining became so prominent in Venezuela that the metal became known as ''cobre Caracas'' ("Caracas copper"). Many of the mines became the property of the Bolívar family. Bolívar's grandfather, Juan de Bolívar y Martínez de Villegas, paid 22,000 [[ducat]]s to the monastery at [[Santa Maria de Montserrat]] in 1728 for a title of nobility that had been granted by King [[Philip V of Spain]] for its maintenance. The crown never issued the [[Letters patent|patent of nobility]], and so the purchase became the subject of [[lawsuit]]s that were still in progress during Bolívar's lifetime, when independence from Spain made the point moot. (If the lawsuits had been successful, Bolívar's older brother, Juan Vicente, would have become the [[Marquess]] of [[Villa de Cura|San Luis]] and [[Viscount]] of Cocorote.) Bolívar ultimately devoted his personal fortune to the revolution. Having been one of the wealthiest persons within the Spanish American world at the beginning of the revolution, he died in poverty.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;

===Ancestry===
Bolívar's family tree has many relatives from two branches: the Palacios family and the Bolívar family. Enrique de la Concha Arnal, a genealogist at the ''Instituto Venezolano de Genealogía'', researched his ancestry,&lt;ref&gt;Concha Arnal, Enrique de la (2014).

==Early life==

===Childhood===
[[File:Simón Bolívar, 1800.jpg|thumb|Simón Bolívar at the age of 17, in 1801]]

Simón Bolívar was born in [[Birthplace of Simon Bolivar|a house]] in [[Caracas]], [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]], on 24 July 1783.&lt;ref name=Arana&gt;Arana, M., 2013, ''Bolivar'', New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, {{ISBN|9781439110195}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} He was baptized as Simón José Antonio de la Santísima Trinidad Bolívar y Palacios. His mother was María de la Concepción Palacios y Blanco, and his father was [[Colonel]] Don Juan Vicente Bolívar y Ponte. He had two older sisters and a brother: María Antonia, Juana, and Juan Vicente. Another sister, María del Carmen, died at birth.{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=9}}

When Bolívar was an infant, he was cared for by Doña Ines Manceba de Miyares and the family's slave, Hipólita. A couple of years later, he returned to the care of his parents, but this experience would have a major effect on his life. His father died before Bolívar's third birthday,{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=9}} and his mother died when he was almost nine.

After his mother's death, Bolívar was placed in the custody of an instructor, Miguel José Sanz, but this relationship did not work out and he was sent back home. He went on to receive private lessons from the renowned professors [[Andrés Bello]], Guillermo Pelgrón, Jose Antonio Negrete, Fernando Vides, Father Andújar, and Don [[Simón Rodríguez]], formerly known as Simón Carreño. Don Simón Rodríguez became Bolívar's teacher, friend and mentor. He taught him how to swim and ride horses, as well as about liberty, human rights, politics, history, and [[sociology]].{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=10}} Later in life, Rodríguez was pivotal in Bolívar's decision to start the revolution, instilling in him the ideas of liberty, enlightenment, and freedom.{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=10}} In the meantime, Bolívar was mostly cared for by his nurse, the slave Hipólita, whom he later called "the only mother I have known".{{sfn|Lynch|2007|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=zHWkaLOfoVQC&amp;pg=PA16 16]}}

===Youth===
When Bolívar was fourteen, Don Simón Rodríguez was forced to leave the country after being accused of involvement in a conspiracy against the Spanish government in Caracas. Bolívar then entered the military academy of the Milicias de Aragua.{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=10}} In 1800, he was sent to Spain to follow his military studies in [[Madrid]], where he remained until 1802. Back in Europe in 1804, he lived in France and traveled to different countries. While in [[Paris]], Bolívar witnessed the coronation of [[Napoleon I|Napoleon]] in [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre Dame]], an event that left a profound impression on him. Even if he disagreed with the crowning, he was highly sensitive to the popular veneration inspired by the hero.{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=10}}

==Political and military career==
{{main|Military career of Simón Bolívar}}

===Venezuela and New Granada, 1807–1821===
====Prelude, 1807–1810====
[[File:Simón Bolívar, 1812.jpg|thumb|Bolívar in 1812]]

Bolívar returned to Venezuela in 1804. After a [[Coup d'état|coup]] on 19 April 1810, Venezuela achieved ''de facto'' independence when the [[Supreme Junta|Supreme Junta of Caracas]] was established and the colonial administrators deposed. The Supreme Junta sent a delegation to [[Great Britain]] to get British recognition and aid. This delegation presided by Bolívar also included two future Venezuelan notables [[Andrés Bello]] and Luis López Méndez. The trio met with [[Francisco de Miranda]] and persuaded him to return to his native land.

====First Republic of Venezuela, 1811–1812====
In 1811, a delegation from the Supreme Junta, also including Bolívar, and a crowd of commoners enthusiastically received Miranda in [[La Guaira]].&lt;ref&gt;Crow (1992:431).&lt;/ref&gt;  During the insurgence war conducted by Miranda, Bolívar was promoted to colonel and was made commandant of [[Puerto Cabello]] the following year, 1812. As [[Royalist (Spanish American independence)|Royalist]] Frigate Captain [[Domingo de Monteverde]] was advancing into republican territory from the west, Bolívar lost control of [[San Felipe Castle]] along with its ammunition stores on 30 June 1812. Bolívar then retreated to his estate in [[San Mateo, Aragua|San Mateo]].

Miranda saw the republican cause as lost and signed a capitulation agreement with Monteverde on 25 July, an action that Bolívar and other revolutionary officers deemed [[treason]]ous. In one of Bolívar's most morally dubious acts, he and others arrested Miranda and handed him over to the Spanish Royal Army at the port of La Guaira.&lt;ref&gt;Masur (1969), 98–102; and Lynch, ''Bolívar: A Life'', 60–63.&lt;/ref&gt; For his apparent services to the Royalist cause, Monteverde granted Bolívar a passport, and Bolívar left for [[Curaçao]] on 27 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curacao-art.com/galleries/octagon-museum/|title=Octagon Museum - Curaçao Art|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must be said, though, that Bolívar protested to the Spanish authorities about the reasons why he handled Miranda, insisting that he was not lending a service to the Crown but punishing a defector. In 1813, he was given a military command in [[Tunja]], [[United Provinces of New Granada|New Granada]] (modern-day [[Colombia]]), under the direction of the [[United Provinces of New Granada|Congress of United Provinces of New Granada]], which had formed out of the [[military junta|junta]]s established in 1810.

====Second Republic of Venezuela (1813–1814) and exile====
[[File:Simón Bolívar, 1816.jpg|thumb|Bolívar in 1816, during his stay in [[Haiti]]]]

This was the beginning of the [[Admirable Campaign]]. On 24 May, Bolívar entered [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]], where he was proclaimed ''El Libertador'' ("The Liberator").&lt;ref name="Bushnell, David 1970" /&gt; This was followed by the occupation of [[Trujillo, Trujillo|Trujillo]] on 9 June. Six days later, and as a result of Spanish massacres on independence supporters,  Bolívar dictated his famous "[[Decree of War to the Death]]", allowing the killing of any Spaniard not actively supporting independence. Caracas was retaken on 6 August 1813, and Bolívar was ratified as ''El Libertador'', establishing the [[Second Republic of Venezuela]]. The following year, because of the rebellion of [[José Tomás Boves]] and the fall of the republic, Bolívar returned to New Granada, where he commanded a force for the United Provinces.

His forces entered [[Bogotá]] in 1814 and recaptured the city from the dissenting republican forces of [[Free and Independent State of Cundinamarca|Cundinamarca]]. Bolívar intended to march into [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] and enlist the aid of local forces in order to capture the Royalist town of [[Santa Marta]]. In 1815, however, after a number of political and military disputes with the government of Cartagena, Bolívar fled to [[Colony of Jamaica|Jamaica]], where he was denied support. After an assassination attempt in Jamaica,&lt;ref name="murder attempt"&gt;Simón Bolívar has been indirectly saved by his French friend [[Benoît Chassériau]] who 10 December 1815 a few hours before the assassination attempt, visited him and gave him money to seek alternative accommodation. Thus, the Liberator left the room where [[José Antonio Páez]] had slept for several nights and depended on the guesthouse Rafael Pisce at the corner of Prince and White streets. The same night, Pio the servant of Bolivar and Paez plunged his murderous knife into the neck of Captain Felix Amestoy, thinking it was the Liberator.

====Campaigns in Venezuela, 1816–1818====

In 1816, with Haitian soldiers and vital material support, Bolívar landed in Venezuela and fulfilled his promise to Pétion to free Spanish America's slaves on 2 June 1816.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|186}}

In July 1817, on a second expedition, he captured [[Ciudad Bolívar|Angostura]] after defeating the counter-attack of [[Miguel de la Torre]].&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|192–201}} However, Venezuela remained a captaincy of Spain after the victory in 1818 by [[Pablo Morillo]] in the [[Second Battle of La Puerta]] ([[:es:Segunda Batalla de La Puerta|es]]).&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|212}}

====Liberation of New Granada and Venezuela, 1819–1821====
[[File:Congreso de Cúcuta.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Bolívar and [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] during the [[Congress of Cúcuta]], October 1821]]

On 15 February 1819, Bolívar was able to open the Venezuelan [[Congress of Angostura|Second National Congress]] in Angostura, in which he was elected president and [[Francisco Antonio Zea]] was elected vice president.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|222–25}} Bolívar then decided that he would first fight for the independence of New Granada, to gain resources of the vice royalty, intending later to consolidate the independence of Venezuela.&lt;ref&gt;Batallas de Venezuela: 1810–1824. p. 124. Edgar Esteves González&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign for the independence of New Granada was consolidated with the victory at the [[Battle of Boyacá]] on 7 August 1819.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|233}}  Bolívar returned to Angostura, where congress passed a law forming a greater [[Gran Colombia|Republic of Colombia]] on 17 December, making Bolívar president and Zea vice president, with [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] vice president on the New Granada side, and [[Juan Germán Roscio]] vice president on the Venezuela side.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|246–47}}

[[File:Batalla de Carabobo.gif|thumb|250px|[[Battle of Carabobo]], 24 June 1821]]

Morillo was left in control of Caracas and the coastal highlands.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|248}} After the restoration of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Cádiz Constitution]], Morillo ratified two treaties with Bolívar on 25 November 1820, calling for a six-month armistice and recognizing Bolívar as president of the republic.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|254–55}}  Bolívar and Morillo met in [[San Fernando de Apure]] on 27 November, after which Morillo left Venezuela for Spain, leaving La Torre in command.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|255–57}}

From his newly consolidated base of power, Bolívar launched outright independence campaigns in Venezuela and [[Ecuador]]. These campaigns concluded with the victory at the [[Battle of Carabobo]], after which Bolívar triumphantly entered Caracas on 29 June 1821.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|267}} On 7 September 1821, [[Gran Colombia]] (a state covering much of modern Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela) was created, with Bolívar as president and Santander as vice president.

===Ecuador and Peru, 1822–1825===
Bolívar followed with the Battle of Bombona and the [[Battle of Pichincha]], after which he entered [[Quito]] on 16 June 1822.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|287}} On 26 and 27 July 1822, Bolívar held the [[Guayaquil Conference]] with the Argentine General [[José de San Martín]], who had received the title of "Protector of Peruvian Freedom" in August 1821 after partially liberating Peru from the Spanish.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|295}} Thereafter, Bolívar took over the task of fully liberating Peru.

[[File:Batalla de Junín.jpg|thumb|250px|Battle of Junín, 6 August 1824]]

The Peruvian congress named him dictator of Peru on 10 February 1824, which allowed Bolívar to reorganize completely the political and military administration. Assisted by Antonio José de Sucre, Bolívar decisively defeated the Spanish [[cavalry]] at the [[Battle of Junín]] on 6 August 1824. Sucre destroyed the still numerically superior remnants of the Spanish forces at [[Battle of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]] on 9 December 1824.

Writing to [[United States Secretary of State]] [[John Quincy Adams]] in 1824, United States Consul in Peru [[William Tudor (1779–1830)|William Tudor]] stated:&lt;ref name="WWbol"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quiroz|first1=Alfonso W.|title=Corrupt Circles: A History of Unbound Graft in Peru|date=2008|publisher=[[Woodrow Wilson Center Press]]|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9780801891281|edition=1|pages=88–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|text=Unfortunately for Peru, the invaders who came to proclaim liberty and independence were cruel, rapacious, unprincipled and incapable. Their mismanagement, their profligacy, and their thirst for plunder soon alienated the affections of the inhabitants.}}

Even though Bolívar condemned the corrupt practices of the Spanish, he ordered some churches being stripped of their decorations.&lt;ref&gt;Rumazo González (2006), p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 19, 1824, José Gabriel Pérez wrote to Antonio José de Sucre about the orders given to him by Bolívar;&lt;ref&gt;Letter from José Gabriel Pérez to Antonio José de Sucre. Trujillo, March 19, 1824. ''Archivo del Libertador'', [http://www.archivodellibertador.gob.ve/escritos/buscador/spip.php?article4650 Document 9135.]&lt;/ref&gt; Pérez talked about "all the ordinary and extraordinary means" that should be applied to assure the subsistence of the patriot army. Indeed, Pérez said that Bolívar issued instructions to take from churches "all golden and silver jewels" in order to coin them and pay war expenditures. Days later, Bolívar himself said to Sucre that there would be a complete lack of resources, unless severe actions would be taken against "the jewels of the churches, everywhere".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from Simón Bolívar to Antonio José de Sucre. Trujillo, March 21, 1824. ''Archivo del Libertador'', [http://www.archivodellibertador.gob.ve/escritos/buscador/spip.php?article4764 Document 9151.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Lieutenant Juan Pablo Santa Cruz, an associate of General [[Antonio Gutiérrez de la Fuente]], illegally appropriated the livestock and goods of citizens for his own gain. Prefect of Cusco, [[Agustín Gamarra]], used loot to present Bolívar 80 gold and 500 silver medals honoring him.&lt;ref name="WWbol"/&gt;

===Consolidation of the independence, 1825–1830===
====Republic of Bolivia====
On 6 August 1825, at the Congress of Upper Peru, the "Republic of Bolivia" was created.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|346}} Bolívar is thus one of the [[List of countries named after people|few people to have a country named after him]]. Bolívar returned to Caracas on 12 January 1827, and then back to Bogotá.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|369, 378, 408}}

Bolívar had great difficulties maintaining control of the vast Gran Colombia. In 1826, internal divisions sparked dissent throughout the nation, and regional uprisings erupted in Venezuela. The new South American union had revealed its fragility and appeared to be on the verge of collapse. To preserve the union, an amnesty was declared and an arrangement was reached with the Venezuelan rebels, but this increased the political dissent in neighboring New Granada. In an attempt to keep the nation together as a single entity, Bolívar called for a constitutional convention at [[Ocaña, Colombia|Ocaña]] in March 1828.{{sfn|Petre|1910|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=TasLAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA381 381–82]}}

====Struggles inside Gran Colombia====
Bolívar thought that a federation like the one founded in the United States was unworkable in the Spanish America.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|106, 166}} For this reason, and to prevent a break-up, Bolívar sought to implement a more centralist model of government in Gran Colombia, including some or all of the elements of the [[Tricameralism#Bolívar's tricameralism|Bolivian constitution]] he had written, which included a [[President for Life|lifetime presidency]] with the ability to select a successor (although this presidency was to be held in check by an intricate system of balances).&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|351}}

This move was considered controversial in New Granada and was one of the reasons for the deliberations, which met from 9 April to 10 June 1828. The convention almost ended up drafting a document which would have implemented a radically federalist form of government, which would have greatly reduced the powers of a central administration. The federalist faction was able to command a majority for the draft of a new constitution which has definite federal characteristics despite its ostensibly centralist outline. Unhappy with what would be the ensuing result, pro-Bolívar delegates withdrew from the convention, leaving it moribund.&lt;ref name="Bushnell, David 1954"&gt;Bushnell, David (1954) ''The Santander Regime in Gran Colombia''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two months after the failure of this congress to write a new constitution, Bolívar was declared president-liberator in Colombia's "Organic Decree".&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|394}} He considered this a temporary measure, as a means to reestablish his authority and save the republic, although it increased dissatisfaction and anger among his political opponents.&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|408}} An assassination attempt on 25 September 1828 failed (in Spanish it is indeed known as the ''Noche Septembrina''), thanks to the help of his lover, [[Manuela Sáenz]].&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|399–405}} Bolívar afterward described Manuela as "Liberatrix of the Liberator".&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|403}} Dissent continued, and uprisings occurred in New Granada, Venezuela, and Ecuador during the next two years.&lt;ref name="Bushnell, David 1954" /&gt;

Bolivar initially tried to forgive those who were considered conspirators, members of the "Santander" faction. Eventually it was decided to submit them to martial justice, after which those accused of being directly involved were executed, some without having their guilt fully established. Santander, who had known in advance of the conspiracy and had not directly opposed it because of his differences with Bolivar, was condemned to death. Bolivar, though, commuted the sentence.

After the facts, Bolivar, who suffering from tuberculosis, continued to govern in a rarefied environment, cornered by fractional disputes. Uprisings occurred in New Granada, Venezuela, and Ecuador during the following two years. The separatists accused him of betraying republican principles and of wanting to establish a permanent dictatorship.&lt;ref name="Bushnell, David 1954" /&gt; Gran Colombia declared war against Peru when president General La Mar invaded Guayaquil. He was later defeated by Marshall [[Antonio José de Sucre]] in the [[Battle of the Portete de Tarqui]], 27 February 1829. Sucre was killed on 4 June 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Monroy |first=Ramón Rocha |url=http://www.bolpress.com/art.php?Cod=2009060501 |title=Ultimas cartas de Sucre |publisher=Bolpress |date=June 5, 2009 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Juan José Flores]] wanted to separate the southern departments (Quito, Guayaquil, and Azuay), known as the District of Ecuador, from Gran Colombia to form an independent country and become its first President. Venezuela was proclaimed independent on 13 January 1830 and [[José Antonio Páez]] maintained the presidency of that country, banishing Bolivar.

====Dissolution of Gran Colombia====
For Bolívar, Hispanic America was the fatherland. He dreamed of a united Spanish America and in the pursuit of that purpose he not only created Gran Colombia but also the Confederation of the Andes whose aim was to unite the aforementioned with Peru and Bolivia. Moreover, he promoted a network of treaties keeping the newly liberated South American countries together. Nonetheless, he was unable to control the centrifugal process which pushed outwards all directions.

On 20 January 1830, as his dream fell apart, Bolívar delivered his final address to the nation, announcing that he would be stepping down from the presidency of Gran Colombia. In his speech, a distraught Bolívar urged the people to maintain the union and to be wary of the intentions of those who advocated for separation. (At the time, "Colombians" referred to the people of Gran Colombia (Venezuela, New Granada, and Ecuador), not modern-day Colombia):
{{cquote|Bogotá, 20 January 1830.
Simón Bolívar

Colombians! Today I cease to govern you. I have served you for twenty years as soldier and leader. During this long period we have taken back our country, liberated three republics, fomented many civil wars, and four times I have returned to the people their omnipotence, convening personally four constitutional congresses. These services were inspired by your virtues, your courage, and your patriotism; mine is the great privilege of having governed you.

The constitutional congress convened on this day is charged by Providence with the task of giving the nation the institutions she desires, following the course of circumstances and the nature of things.

Fearing that I may be regarded as an obstacle to establishing the Republic on the true base of its happiness, I personally have cast myself down from the supreme position of leadership to which your generosity had elevated me.

Colombians! I have been the victim of ignominious suspicions, with no possible way to defend the purity of my principles. The same persons who aspire to the supreme command have conspired to tear your hearts from me, attributing to me their own motives, making me seem to be the instigator of projects they themselves have conceived, representing me, finally, as aspiring to a crown which they themselves have offered on more than one occasion and which I have rejected with the indignation of the fiercest republican. Never, never, I swear to you, has it crossed my mind to aspire to a kingship that my enemies have fabricated in order to ruin me in your regard.

Do not be deceived, Colombians! My only desire has been to contribute to your freedom and to be the preservation of your peace of mind. If for this I am held guilty, I deserve your censure more than any man. Do not listen, I beg you, to the vile slander and the tawdry envy stirring up discord on all sides. Will you allow yourself to be deceived by the false accusations of my detractors? Please don't be foolish!

Colombians! Gather around the constitutional congress. It represents the wisdom of the nation, the legitimate hope of the people, and the final point of reunion of the patriots. Its sovereign decrees will determine our lives, the happiness of the Republic, and the glory of Colombia. If dire circumstances should cause you to abandon it, there will be no health for the country, and you will drown in the ocean of anarchy, leaving as your children's legacy nothing but crime, blood, and death.

Fellow Countrymen! Hear my final plea as I end my political career; in the name of Colombia '''I ask you, beg you, to remain united''', lest you become the assassins of the country and your own executioners.

Bolívar ultimately failed in his attempt to prevent the collapse of the union. Gran Colombia was dissolved later that year and was replaced by the republics of Venezuela, New Granada, and Ecuador. Ironically, these countries were established as [[centralized government|centralist nations]], and would be governed for decades this way by leaders who, during Bolívar's last years, had accused him of betraying republican principles and of wanting to establish a permanent dictatorship. These separatists, among them [[José Antonio Páez]] and [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], had justified their opposition to Bolívar for this reason and publicly denounced him as a monarch. Some of them had in the past been accused of plotting against Bolívar's life (Santander, who governed the second [[centralisation|centralist government]] of [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]], was associated with the [[:es:Conspiracion Septembrina|September Conspiracy]]).

[[José María Obando]], who led the first dictatorship of [[Republic of New Granada|New Granada]], had been linked to the assassination of [[Antonio José de Sucre]] in 1830. Sucre was regarded by some as a political threat because of his popularity after he led a resounding patriot victory at the [[Battle of Ayacucho]], ending the war against the Spanish Empire in South America. Bolívar also considered him his direct successor and had attempted to make him vice president of Gran Colombia after [[Francisco de Paula Santander]] was exiled in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Robert. “Bolivar: The Liberator of Latin America”. Skyhorse, 2013, Ch. 24 [https://books.google.co.ve/books?id=XHw0MPck-xcC&amp;pg=PT332&amp;lpg=PT332&amp;dq=antonio+jose+de+sucre+successor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=auUqKrEJVl&amp;sig=c_FX6Ut2nDz_f9ONohFWeOcChlM&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=antonio%20jose%20de%20sucre%20successor&amp;f=false "Bolivar: The Liberator of Latin America"]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath====
For the rest of the 19th century and into the early 20th century, the political environment of Latin America was fraught with civil wars and characterized by a sociopolitical phenomenon known as ''[[caudillo|caudillismo]]'', which became very common in Venezuela, especially after 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cardoza Sáez|first=Ebert|date=2015|title=El caudillismo y militarismo en Venezuela. Orígenes, conceptualización y consecuencias|url=http://www.redalyc.org/resumen.oa?id=20041006012|journal=Procesos Históricos|issue=28|issn=1690-4818}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, such struggles already existed shortly after the patriot victory over the loyalists because the former Spanish colonies created new nations that proclaimed their own autonomous states, which produced military confrontations with political conspirations that sent some of the former independence heroes into exile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pares.mcu.es/Bicentenarios/portal/triunfoIndependencia.html|title=Triunfo de la Independencia|date=2015-12-04|website=pares.mcu.es|language=es|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, there were attempts by the Spanish monarchy to reconquer their former settlements in the Americas through expeditions that would help the remaining loyalist forces and advocates. However, the attempts generally failed in Venezuela, Perú and Mexico; thus, the loyalist resistance forces against the republic were finally defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pares.mcu.es/Bicentenarios/portal/resistenciaReconquista.html|title=Resistencias e intentos de reconquista|date=2015-12-04|website=pares.mcu.es|language=es|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main characteristic of ''caudillismo'' was the arrival of authoritarian but charismatic political figures who would typically rise to power in an unconventional way, often legitimizing their right to govern through undemocratic processes. These ''caudillos'' maintained their control primarily on the basis of their personalities, as well as skewed interpretations of their popularity and what constituted a majority among the masses. On his deathbed, Bolívar envisaged the emergence of countless ''caudillos'' competing for the pieces of the great nation he once dreamed about.

==Final months and death==
[[File:La Muerte del Libertador - Antonio Herrera Toro.jpg|thumb|Bolívar's death, by Venezuelan painter [[Antonio Herrera Toro]]|alt=|left|200x200px]]

Saying that "all who served the revolution have plowed the sea",&lt;ref name=Arana/&gt;{{rp|450}} Bolívar finally resigned the presidency on 27 April 1830, intending to leave the country for exile in Europe.&lt;ref name=Arana/&gt;{{rp|435}} He had already sent several crates containing his belongings and writings ahead of him to Europe,&lt;ref name="Bolívar, Simón 1983" /&gt; but he died before setting sail from Cartagena.[[File:Simón Bolívar - José María Espinosa, 1830.jpg|thumb|Sketch of Bolívar at age 47 made from life by José María Espinosa in 1830|alt=|225x225px]]

On 17 December 1830, at the age of 47, Simón Bolívar died of [[tuberculosis]]{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=19}} in the [[Quinta de San Pedro Alejandrino]] in [[Santa Marta]], [[Gran Colombia]] (now [[Colombia]]). On his deathbed, Bolívar asked his [[aide-de-camp]], General [[Daniel Florence O'Leary|Daniel F. O'Leary]], to burn the remaining extensive archive of his writings, letters, and speeches. O'Leary disobeyed the order and his writings survived, providing historians with a wealth of information about Bolívar's liberal philosophy and thought, as well as details of his personal life, such as his long love affair with [[Manuela Sáenz]]. Shortly before her own death in 1856, Sáenz augmented this collection by giving O'Leary her own letters from Bolívar.&lt;ref name="Bolívar, Simón 1983" /&gt;
[[File:Traslado de los restos de Simón Bolívar.jpg|left|thumb|200x200px|The transfer of Bolívar's remains from Santa Marta to Caracas]]
Bolívar's remains were buried in the cathedral of [[Santa Marta]]. Twelve years later, in 1842, at the request of President [[José Antonio Páez]], they were moved from Santa Marta to Caracas, where they were buried in the cathedral of Caracas together with the remains of his wife and parents. In 1876, he was moved to a monument set up for his interment at the [[National Pantheon of Venezuela]]. The ''Quinta'' near Santa Marta has been preserved as a museum with numerous references to his life.&lt;ref name="findagrave" /&gt; In 2010, symbolic remains of Bolívar's later-years lover, [[Manuela Sáenz]], were also interred in Venezuela's National Pantheon.{{sfn|BBC, Grant|5 July 2010}}

On January 2008, then-[[President of Venezuela]] [[Hugo Chávez]] set up a commission&lt;ref name="WaPo Forero 23 February 2008" /&gt; to investigate theories that Bolívar was the victim of an assassination. On several occasions, Chávez has claimed that Bolívar was in fact poisoned by "New Granada traitors".&lt;ref name="COHAforum" /&gt; In April 2010, infectious diseases specialist Paul Auwaerter studied records of Bolívar's symptoms and concluded that he might have suffered from chronic [[arsenic poisoning]], but that both acute poisoning and murder were unlikely.&lt;ref name="2010PAresearch" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Telegraph Allen 7 May 2010" /&gt; In July 2010, Bolívar's body was ordered to be exhumed to advance the investigations.&lt;ref name="msnbc James 16 July 2010" /&gt; In July 2011, international forensics experts released their report, claiming there was no proof of poisoning or any other unnatural cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Girish Gupta |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Americas/Latin-America-Monitor/2011/0726/Venezuela-unable-to-determine-cause-of-Bolivar-s-death |title=Venezuela unable to determine cause of Bolivar's death.

==Private life==
===Marriage===
[[File:Matrimonio Maria Teresa del Toro.jpg|thumb|Bolívar marries María Teresa del Toro in 1802.]]

In 1799, following the early deaths of his father Juan Vicente (dead since 1786) and his mother Concepción (who died in 1792), Bolívar traveled to Mexico, France, and Spain, at the age of 16 years, to complete his education. While in [[Madrid]] during 1802 and after a two-year courtship, he married [[:es:María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alaiza|María Teresa Rodríguez del Toro y Alaiza]], who was to be his only wife. She was related to the aristocratic families of the [[:es:marquesado del Toro|marquis del Toro]] of [[Caracas]] and the marquis de Inicio of Madrid.{{sfn|Arismendi Posada|1983|p=10}}

Eight months after returning to Venezuela with him, she died from [[yellow fever]] on 22 January 1803. Bolívar was so devastated by this loss that his relatives feared for his life. He swore never to marry again, a promise he kept. Many years later Bolívar would refer to the death of his wife as the turning point of his life. Indeed, in 1828, he told Luis Perú de Lacroix the following words:

{{cquote
|You then [...] got married at the age of 45; [...] I was not even 18 years old when I did the same, and I was not even nearly 19 years old when I was widowed; I loved my wife a lot in Madrid, and her death made me swear not to get married again, and I kept my word. Look the way things are: if I were not widowed, my life would have maybe been different; I would not be the General Bolívar nor the Libertador, though I agree that my temper is not suitable for being the landlord of San Mateo.&lt;ref&gt;Lacroix (2009), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Not surprisingly, Spanish historian [[Salvador de Madariaga]] refers to the death of Bolivar's wife as one of the key moments in Hispanic America's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Madariaga|first=Salvador|authorlink=Salvador de Madariaga|title=Bolívar|url=|accessdate=|year=1959|publisher=Editorial Sudamericana|isbn=|editor=|location=Buenos Aires|edition=3.ª|page=|language=es|chapter=|oclc=803116575}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1804, he traveled again to Europe in an attempt to ease his pain and began falling into a dissolute life. It was then that he met again with his old teacher Simón Rodríguez in Paris, who little by little was able to transform his acute depression into a sense of commitment towards a greater cause: the independence of Venezuela. He lived in [[First French Empire|Napoleonic France]] for a while and undertook the [[Grand Tour]].{{sfn|Lynch|2006|p=}} During this time in Europe, Bolívar met [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in Rome. Humboldt later wrote: "I was wrong back then, when I judged him a puerile man, incapable of realizing so grand an ambition."&lt;ref name="Arana" /&gt;{{rp|64}}

===Affairs and lovers===
[[File:Manuela Sáens Thorne.jpg|thumb|[[Manuela Sáenz]], lover of Bolívar who rescued him from an assassination attempt]]

It is well known that Bolívar had several love affairs during his lifetime; most of them were ephemeral and did not last long. Some of them were during his presence in Europe, after his short marriage that ended in 1803. Historians, scholars and biographers often agree with the names of the most prominent women who stood with Bolívar, either at war or at peace: Josefina "Pepita" Machado, Fanny du Villars and Manuela Sáenz.

[[Manuela Sáenz]] was the most important of those women, mainly because she was Bolívar's lover in later life during his presidency in Gran Colombia, but also due the fact that she became a trustworthy confidant and advisor. Moreover, Manuela saved Bolívar's life during the September Conspiracy of 1828, in which the Libertador was close to being killed in Bogotá. That is, Manuela managed to divert the assassins by urging Simón to leap through the window thus giving Bolívar time to escape from his room safely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Selected Writings of Bolívar|last=Lecuna|first=Vicente|publisher=The Colonial Press Inc.|year=1951|isbn=|location=New York|pages=707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolívar and Manuela met in Quito, on June 22, 1822. They had a long-term relationship that was controversial at the time due the fact that Manuela was already married to James Thorne although she had been estranged from him since 1822 because of their irreconcilable differences .&lt;ref&gt;Masur (1948), pp. 430–33.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Manuela was emotionally tied to Bolívar, whose death in 1830 made her try to commit suicide when she learned of the Libertador's physical disappearance.

Notwithstanding this mutual love, Bolívar and Manuela did not always have a face to face relationship although they sometimes lived in the same South American cities, for example, in Bogota during his political issues in 1828. They did show their romance through written correspondence. A few of their letters to each other have been found, but most of them have been denounced as forgeries by [[Heinz Dieterich]], Carlos Álvarez Saá, and a book edited by ''Fundación Editorial El Perro y la Rana'' publishing house in 2007 .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arteenlared.com/lecturas/articulos/manuelita-saenz-apocrifa.html|title=Manuelita Sáenz Apócrifa|last=Lovera De-Sola|first=R.J.|date=2011-07-02|website=www.arteenlared.com|publisher=|language=es-es|access-date=2017-01-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161116024319/http://www.arteenlared.com/lecturas/articulos/manuelita-saenz-apocrifa.html|archivedate=16 November 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptions of Bolívar==
===Ducoudray Holstein===
In his ''Memoirs of Simón Bolívar'', [[Henri La Fayette Villaume Ducoudray Holstein]] (who himself has been called a "not-always-reliable and never impartial witness"&lt;ref name="Slatta, Richard W. 2003"&gt;Slatta, Richard W. ''Simón Bolívar's Quest for Glory''. Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) described the young Bolívar as he was attempting to seize power in Venezuela and New Granada in 1814–1816. Ducoudray Holstein joined Bolívar and served on his staff as officer and Bolívar's confident during this period.

He describes Bolívar as a coward who repeatedly abandoned his military commission in front of the enemy, and also as a great lover of women, being accompanied at all times by two or more of his mistresses during the military operations. He would not hesitate to stop the fleet transporting the whole army and bound for [[Isla Margarita|Margarita Island]] during two days in order to wait for his mistress to join his ship. According to Ducoudray Holstein, Bolívar behaved essentially as an opportunist preferring intrigues and secret manipulation to an open fight. He was also deemed incompetent in military matters, systematically avoiding any risks and permanently anxious for his own safety.

In the ''Diario de Bucaramanga'', Bolívar's opinion of Ducoudray is presented when [[Louis Peru de Lacroix]] asked who had been Bolívar's ''aides-de-camp'' since he had been general; he mentioned [[Charles Eloi Demarquet]] and Ducoudray. Bolívar confirmed the first but denied the second, saying that he had met him in 1815 and accepted his services, even admitting him to his General Staff, but "I never trusted him enough to make him my ''aide-de-camp''; to the contrary, I had a very unfavorable idea of his person and his services", and that Ducoudray's departure after only a brief stay had been a "real pleasure."&lt;ref name="Diario de Bucaramanga, 2009"&gt;

===Karl Marx===
{{Quote box|width=300px|align=right|quote="Moreover a longish article on Bolívar elicited objections from Dana because, he said, it is written in a 'partisan style', and he asked me to cite my authorities. This I can, of course, do, although it is a singular demand. As regards the 'partisan style', it is true that I departed somewhat from the tone of a cyclopedia. To see the dastardly, most miserable and meanest of [[wikt:blackguard|blackguard]]s described as Napoleon I was altogether too much. Bolívar is a veritable Soulouque"|source=Karl Marx&lt;ref name="marx"/&gt;}}

In an unsympathetic biography titled ''Bolívar y Ponte, Simón'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marx|first1=Karl|title=Bolivar y Ponte|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1858/01/bolivar.htm|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in the [[New American Cyclopedia]], [[Karl Marx]] criticized much of Bolívar's life. Marx begins by saying that Bolívar was born to a family of "creole nobility in Venezuela" and that similar to the "custom of wealthy Americans of those times, at the early age of 14 he was sent to Europe". At several points in Marx's piece, he complains that Bolívar abandoned his troops multiple times. Marx also explains how Bolívar had to be persuaded by his cousin Ribas to return to fight against the Spanish after staying at Cartagena. Marx then explains that after arriving in Caracas in 1813, Bolívar's "dictatorship soon proved a military anarchy, leaving the most important affairs in the hands of favorites, who squandered the finances of the country, and then resorted to odious means in order to restore them". At the conclusion of the biography, Marx uses Ducoudray Holstein's description of Bolívar.&lt;ref name="marx"&gt;{{cite web| url         = http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1858/01/bolivar.htm| title       = Bolivar y Ponte | date        = 1858| first       = Karl| last        = Marx| authorlink  = Karl Marx| publisher   = marxists.org| accessdate  = 18 August 2010}} First published in the New American Cyclopedia, Vol. III, 1858.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Beddow and Thibodeaux, Marx dismissed Bolívar as a "falsifier, deserter, conspirator, liar, coward and looter", and a "false liberator who merely sought to preserve the power of the old Creole nobility to which he belonged".&lt;ref name=MARXbolivar&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beddow|first1=D.

==Relatives==
Bolívar had no children, possibly because of infertility caused by having contracted [[measles]] and [[mumps]] as a child. His closest living relatives descend from his sisters and brother. One of his sisters died in infancy. His sister Juana Bolívar y Palacios married their maternal uncle, Dionisio Palacios y Blanco, and had two children, Guillermo and Benigna. Guillermo Palacios died fighting alongside his uncle Simón in the battle of La Hogaza on 2 December 1817. Benigna had two marriages, the first to Pedro Briceño Méndez and the second to Pedro Amestoy.&lt;ref name="De-Sola Ricardo 1999 v1" /&gt; Their great-grandchildren, Bolívar's closest living relatives, Pedro, and [[Eduardo Mendoza Goiticoa]] lived in [[Caracas]] as of 2009.

His eldest sister, María Antonia, married Pablo Clemente Francia and had four children: Josefa, Anacleto, Valentina, and Pablo. María Antonia became Bolívar's [[agent (law)|agent]] to deal with his properties while he served as president of Gran Colombia and she was an executrix of his will. She retired to Bolívar's estate in [[Libertador Municipality (Venezuelan Capital District)|Macarao]], which she inherited from him.&lt;ref name="De-Sola Ricardo-dict" /&gt;

His older brother, Juan Vicente, who died in 1811 on a diplomatic mission to the United States, had three children born out of wedlock whom he recognized: Juan, Fernando Simón, and Felicia Bolívar Tinoco. Bolívar provided for the children and their mother after his brother's death. Bolívar was especially close to Fernando and in 1822 sent him to study in the United States, where he attended the [[University of Virginia]]. In his long life, Fernando had minor participation in some of the major political events of Venezuelan history and also traveled and lived extensively throughout Europe. He had three children, Benjamín Bolívar Gauthier, Santiago Hernández Bolívar, and Claudio Bolívar Taraja. Fernando died in 1898 at the age of 88.&lt;ref name="Fuentes Carvallo-dict" /&gt;

==Personal beliefs==
===Politics===
Simón Bolívar was an admirer of both the [[American Revolution|American]] and the [[French Revolution]]s.&lt;ref name=Arana/&gt;{{rp|35, 52–53}} Bolívar even enrolled his nephew, Fernando Bolívar, in a private school in Philadelphia, [[Germantown Academy]], and paid for his education, including attendance at Thomas Jefferson's [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref name=Arana/&gt;{{rp|71–72, 369}} Bolívar differed, however, in political philosophy from the leaders of the revolution in the United States on two important matters. First of all, he was staunchly anti-slavery, despite coming from an area of Spanish America that relied heavily on slave labor. Second, while he was an admirer of the American independence, he did not believe that its governmental system could work in Latin America.{{sfn|Bushnell|Langley|2008|p=}} Thus, he claimed that the governance of heterogeneous societies like Venezuela "will require a firm hand".{{sfn|Bushnell|Langley|2008|p=100}}

Bolívar felt that the U.S. had been established in land especially fertile for democracy. By contrast, he referred to Spanish America as having been subject to the "triple yoke of ignorance, tyranny, and vice".&lt;ref name=Arana/&gt;{{rp|224}} If a republic could be established in such a land, in his mind, it would have to make some concessions in terms of liberty. This is shown when Bolívar blamed the fall of the [[First Republic of Venezuela|first republic]] on his subordinates trying to imitate "some ethereal republic" and in the process, not paying attention to the gritty political reality of South America.{{sfn|Bushnell|Langley|2008|p=136}}

Among the books accompanying him as he traveled were [[Adam Smith]]'s ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]'', [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Letters on the English|Letters]]'' and, when he was writing the Bolivian constitution, [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]''.{{sfn|Lynch|2006|p=33}} His Bolivian constitution placed him within the camp of what would become Latin American conservatism in the later nineteenth century. The Bolivian constitution intended to establish a [[President for Life|lifelong presidency]] and a hereditary senate, essentially recreating the [[Constitution of the United Kingdom|British unwritten constitution]], as it existed at the time.

===Freemasonry===
Similarly to some others in the history of American Independence ([[George Washington]], [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Miguel Hidalgo]], [[José de San Martín]], [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], [[Toussaint Louverture|Toussaint L'Ouverture]], [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], [[Antonio Nariño]], and [[Francisco de Miranda]]), Simón Bolívar was a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]]. He was initiated in 1803 in the Masonic [[Lautaro Lodge|Lodge Lautaro]], which operated in [[Cádiz]], [[Spain]].,&lt;ref name="CAlodges" /&gt; becoming involved with the [[Knights Templar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stjohnslodgedc.org/famous-masons | title = Famous Freemasons in the course of history | website = Unmerged Lodge St. John's No. 11 F.A.A.M., Washington D.C. | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151116030150/http://www.stjohnslodgedc.org/famous-masons | archive-date = Nov 16, 2015 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this lodge that he first met some of his revolutionary peers, such as [[José de San Martín]]. In May 1806 he was conferred the rank of Master Mason in the "Scottish Mother of St. Alexander of Scotland" in Paris. During his time in London, he frequented "The Great American Reunion" lodge in London, founded by Francisco de Miranda. In April 1824, Simón Bolívar was given the 33rd degree of Inspector General Honorary.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

He founded the [[Masonic Lodge]] No. 2 of Peru, named "Order and Liberty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/textfiles/famous.html | title = List of notable freemasons | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180926124632/http://freemasonry.bcy.ca/textfiles/famous.html | archive-date = Sep 25, 2018 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.businessinsider.com/the-most-influential-freemasons-2014-3?IR=T#earl-warren--sequoia-lodge-no-349-oakland-1919-12 | title = 17 Of The Most Influential Freemasons Ever | website = businessinsider.com | date = Mar 20, 2014 | access-date = Sep 30, 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151122015117/https://www.businessinsider.com/the-most-influential-freemasons-2014-3?IR=T | archive-date = Nov 22, 2015 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
===Political legacy===

Due to the historical relevance of Bolívar as a key element during the process of independence in [[Hispanic America]], his memory has been strongly attached to sentiments of nationalism and patriotism, being a recurrent theme of rhetoric in politics. Since the image of Bolívar became an important part to the national identities of Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia, his mantle is often claimed by Hispanic American politicians all across the political spectrum.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Monuments and physical legacy===
{{refimprove section|date=December 2017}}&lt;!--only 2nd paragraph has a citation--&gt;
The nations of [[Bolivia]] and the [[Venezuela|Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela]], and their respective currencies (the [[Bolivian boliviano]] and the [[Venezuelan bolívar]]), are all named after Bolívar. Additionally, most cities and towns in Venezuela are built around a main square known as [[Plaza Bolívar (disambiguation)|Plaza Bolívar]], as is the case with [[Bogotá]]. In this example, most governmental buildings and public structures are located on or around the plaza, including the [[National Capitol]] and the Palace of Justice. Besides [[Quito]] and [[Carácas]], there are monuments to Bolívar in the Latin American capitals of [[Lima]], [[Buenos Aires]], [[Havana]],  [[México City]], [[Panama City]], [[Paramaribo]], [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], [[Santo Domingo]] and [[Sucre]]. In Bogotá, the [[Simón Bolívar Park]] has hosted [[List of events held at Simón Bolívar Park|many concerts]].

Outside of Latin America, the variety of monuments to Simón Bolívar are a continuing testament to his legacy. These include statues in many capitals around the world, including [[Algiers]], [[Ankara]], [[Bucharest]], [[London]], [[Minsk]], [[New Delhi]], [[Ottawa]], [[Paris]], [[Prague]], [[Port-au-Prince]], [[Rome]], [[Sofia]], [[Tehran]], [[Vienna]] and [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Several cities in Spain, especially in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]], have constructed monuments to Bolívar, including a large monument in [[Bilbao]] and a comprehensive Venezuelan government-funded museum in [[Cenarruza-Puebla de Bolívar]], his ancestral hometown. An imposing bronze equestrian statue of Simón Bolívar at the entrance to [[Central Park]] at the [[Avenue of the Americas]] in New York City also celebrates Bolívar's contributions to Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/centralpark/monuments/132 |title=Central Park Monuments – Simon Bolivar Monument : NYC Parks |publisher=Nycgovparks.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bolivar Peninsula, Texas|Bolivar Peninsula]] in Texas, [[Bolivar County, Mississippi]], [[Bolivar, New York]], [[Bolivar, West Virginia]] and [[Bolivar, Tennessee]] are also named in his honor.

Monuments to Bolívar's military legacy also comprise one of Venezuelan Navy's [[Simón Bolívar (barque)|sail training barques]], which is named after him, and the {{USS|Simon Bolivar|SSBN-641|6}}, a ''Benjamin Franklin''-class fleet ballistic missile submarine which served with the U.S. Navy between 1965 and 1995.

Minor planet [[712 Boliviana]] discovered by [[Max Wolf]] is named in his honor. The name was suggested by [[Camille Flammarion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_713 |title=(712) Boliviana In: Dictionary of Minor Planet Names |publisher=Springer |date=2003 |ISBN=978-3-540-29925-7 |doi=10.1007/978-3-540-29925-7_713}}

==In popular culture==
Bolívar has been depicted or mentioned in countless works of literature, film, and other media, and continues to be a part of the popular culture in many countries. He is the central character in [[Gabriel García Márquez]]'s 1989 novel ''[[The General in His Labyrinth]]'', in which he is portrayed in a less heroic but more humane manner than in most other parts of his legacy. Bolívar's life was also the basis of the 2013 film ''[[The Liberator (film)|Libertador]]'', starring [[Édgar Ramírez]] and directed by Alberto Arvelo.  In an episode of [[The Ministry of Time]], "Tiempo de ilustrados (Time of the Enlightened)", the time agents help him win the heart of his future wife. Later in the second season (episode 10) the time agents will find him again in 1828 (two years before his death) to avoid his murder, planned by Santander’s followers.

She has five children, Darren (b. 1991), Ryan (b. 1999), Kile (2001&amp;ndash;2012), Usher V (b. 2007), Naviyd Eli (b. 2008); two of whom are with [[Atlanta]]-based clothier Ryan Glover, whom she had been dating since 1998. They married in 2002 and separated and divorced on March 13, 2007&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://platformlaunchaction.blogspot.com/2007/03/tameka-fosters-divorce-finalized.html|title=URBAN-HOOPLA.COM|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Foster became involved romantically with singer [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], who had hired her as a stylist. He proposed to her in January 2007 and announced their engagement in February. They married on August 3, 2007 in a private ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Natalie | last = Finn | url = http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=688e9f23-5672-4ba7-81b1-765a58951938&amp;entry=index | title = Usher Takes the Plunge|accessdate=2008-04-26|date=2007-08-04|publisher=E! | archivedate = June 29, 2011 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629185315/http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b55827_Usher_Takes_the_Plunge.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Foster and Usher's first child, son Usher Raymond V, was born in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jem|last=Aswad|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1575151/20071127/usher.jhtml|title=Usher, Tameka Raymond Welcome Baby Boy|accessdate=2008-01-19|date=2007-11-28|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, Foster gave birth to their second son, Naviyd Ely Raymond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dyball|first=Rennie|date=2008-12-11|title=Usher Welcomes Baby No. 2|work=People|publisher=Time, Inc|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20245927,00.html|accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Foster suffered from [[cardiac arrest]] in a [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]] hospital. She had flown to Brazil to get [[liposuction]] and she was put in a [[induced coma|medically induced coma]] to aid her recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/64557/usher|title=Usher’s Wife Suffers Heart Attack|accessdate=2009-02-13|date=2009-02-13|publisher=[[idiomag]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Usher filed for divorce, citing [[irreconcilable differences]] when claiming to have lived separately from Foster for nearly a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/usher/45275|title=Usher to divorce Tameka Foster|date=2009-06-11|work=[[NME]]|publisher= IPC Media |accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lehner, Maria (June 13, 2009).

Accessed 2009-06-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Foster's family spoke against the claims, stating Usher had been living in their Atlanta home until March 2009. The divorce was finalized on November 4 of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur54245.cfm|title=Black Entertainment News - EURWeb.com|first=Electronic Urban|last=Report|website=EURweb}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--The divorce was finalized November 4, 2009.

Hubbard.&lt;ref name=essence /&gt; Shortly afterward he was declared [[brain dead]],&lt;ref name=essence /&gt; and died July 21, 2012, of heart failure, after initial reports had said he was taken off life support.&lt;ref name=wsb&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wsbtv.com/news/news/local/sources-ushers-stepson-pulled-life-support/nPzfq/ | date = July 21, 2012 | title = Sources: Usher's stepson died of heart failure | publisher= [[WSB-TV]] / ''[[The Atlanta Journal Constitution]]'' | accessdate= August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 24, 2012, ex-husband Usher was awarded primary physical custody of their two sons, with the couple to share legal custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2012-08-24/news/sns-ap-us-people-usher-20120824_1_tameka-raymond-usher-raymond-iv-custody-decision | title = R&amp;B singer Usher wins primary physical custody of 2 sons, ending legal fight with ex-wife | publisher = [[Associated Press]] via the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' | date = August 24, 2012| first = Jonathan, Jr. | last= Landrum | accessdate = August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1626">'''Thiota''' (died after 847) was a heretical [[Christian]] [[prophet]]ess of the ninth century. She was originally from [[Alemannia]] and in 847 she began prophesying that the world would end that year.

Her story is known from the ''[[Annales Fuldenses]]'' which record that she disturbed the diocese of [[Solomon I, Bishop of Constance|Bishop Salomon]], that is, the [[Diocese of Constance]], before arriving in [[Mainz]]. A large number of men and women were persuaded by her "presumption" as well as even some clerics. In fear, many gave her gifts and sought prayers. Finally, the bishops of [[Gallia Belgica]] ordered her to attend a synod in St Alban's church in Mainz. She was eventually forced to confess that she had only made up her predictions at the urging of a priest and for lucrative gain. She was publicly flogged and stripped of her ministry, which the Fuldensian annalist says she had taken up "unreasonably ... against the customs of the church." Shamed, she ceased to prophesy thereafter.

[[File:Vasilisa.jpg|right|thumb|Vasilisa at the Hut of Baba Yaga, by [[Ivan Bilibin]]]]
'''Vasilisa''' ({{lang-ru|Василиса Прекрасная}}) is a Russian [[fairy tale]] collected by [[Alexander Afanasyev]] in ''[[Narodnye russkie skazki]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Afanasyev, ''Narodnye russkie skazki'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/babayaga/index.html  "Vasilissa the Beautiful"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==

By his first wife, a merchant had a single daughter, who was known as Vasilisa the Beautiful.  When the girl was eight years old, her mother died.  On her deathbed, she gave Vasilisa a tiny wooden [[doll]] with instructions to give it a little to eat and a little to drink if she were in need, and then it would help her.  As soon as her mother died, Vasilisa gave it a little to drink and a little to eat, and it comforted her.

After a time, her father remarried; the new wife was a woman with two daughters.  Vasilisa's [[Stepfamily#In fiction|stepmother]] was very cruel to her, but with the help of the doll, she was able to perform all the tasks imposed on her.  When young men came wooing, the stepmother rejected them all because it was not proper for the younger to marry before the older, and none of the suitors wished to marry Vasilisa's stepsisters.

One day the merchant had to embark on a journey.  His wife sold the house and moved them all to a gloomy hut by the forest.  One day she gave each of the girls a task and put out all the fires except a single candle.  Her older daughter then put out the candle, whereupon they sent Vasilisa to fetch light from [[Baba Yaga]]'s hut.  The doll advised her to go, and she went.  While she was walking, a mysterious man rode by her in the hours before dawn, dressed in white, riding a white horse whose equipment was all white; then a similar rider in red. She came to a house that stood on chicken legs and was walled by a fence made of human bones.  A black rider, like the white and red riders, rode past her, and night fell, whereupon the eye sockets of the [[Human skull symbolism|skull]]s began to glow.  Vasilisa was too frightened to run away, and so Baba Yaga found her when she arrived in her [[Mortar and pestle|mortar]].
[[File:Bilibin. Baba Yaga.jpg|left|thumb|Baba Yaga in her mortar, by [[Ivan Bilibin]]]]
Baba Yaga said that Vasilisa must perform tasks to earn the fire, or be killed.  She was to clean the house and yard, wash Baba Yaga's laundry, and cook her a meal. She was also required to separate grains of rotten corn from sound corn, and separate poppy seeds from grains of soil.  Baba Yaga left, and Vasilisa despaired, as she worked herself into exhaustion. When all hope of completing the tasks seemed lost, the doll whispered that she would complete the tasks for Vasilisa, and that the girl should sleep.

At dawn, the white rider passed; at or before noon, the red. As the black rider rode past, Baba Yaga returned and could complain of nothing.  She bade three pairs of disembodied hands seize the corn to squeeze the oil from it, then asked Vasilisa if she had any questions.

Vasilisa asked about the riders's identities and was told that the white one was [[Day]], the red one the [[Sun]], and the black one [[Night]]. But when Vasilisa thought of asking about the disembodied hands, the doll quivered in her pocket. Vasilisa realized she should not ask, and told Baba Yaga she had no further questions. In return, Baba Yaga enquired as to the cause of Vasilisa's success. On hearing the answer "by my mother's blessing", Baba Yaga, who wanted nobody with any kind of blessing in her presence, threw Vasilisa out of her house, and sent her home with a skull-lantern full of burning coals, to provide light for her step-family.

Upon her return, Vasilisa found that, since sending her out on her task, her step-family had been unable to light any candles or fire in their home. Even lamps and candles that might be brought in from outside were useless for the purpose, as all were snuffed out the second they were carried over the threshold. The coals brought in the skull-lantern burned Vasilisa's stepmother and stepsisters to ashes, and Vasilisa buried the skull according to its instructions, so no person would ever be harmed by it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Santo|first=Suzanne Banay|title=Returning: A Tale of Vasilisa and Baba Yaga|date=2012|publisher=Red Butterfly Publications|location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|isbn=9781475236019|pages=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later, Vasilisa became an assistant to a maker of cloth in Russia's capital city, where she became so skilled at her work that the [[czar|Tsar]] himself noticed her skill; he later married Vasilisa.

==Variants==
In some versions, the tale ends with the death of the stepmother and stepsisters, and Vasilisa lives peacefully with her father after their removal.  This lack of a wedding is unusual in a tale with a grown heroine, although some, such as ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'', do feature it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maria Tatar]], ''Off with Their Heads!'' p. 199 {{ISBN|0-691-06943-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
The white, red, and black riders appear in other tales of [[Baba Yaga]] and are often interpreted to give her a mythological significance.

In common with many folklorists of his day, [[Alexander Afanasyev]] regarded many tales as primitive ways of viewing nature.   In such an interpretation, he regarded this fairy tale as depicting the conflict between the sunlight (Vasilisa), the storm (her stepmother), and dark clouds (her stepsisters).&lt;ref&gt;Maria Tatar, p 334, ''The Annotated Classic Fairy Tales'', {{ISBN|0-393-05163-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clarissa Pinkola Estés]] interprets the story as a tale of female liberation, Vasilisa's journey from subservience to strength and independence.  She interprets Baba Yaga as the "wild feminine" principle that Vasilisa has been separated from, which, by obeying and learning how to nurture, she learns and grows from.&lt;ref&gt;

==Related and eponymous works==
[[Edith Hodgetts]] included an English translation of this story in her 1890 collection ''Tales and Legends from the Land of the Tzar.''

[[Aleksandr Rou]] made a film entitled ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful (1939 film)|Vasilisa the Beautiful]]'' in 1939, however, it was based on a different tale – ''[[The Frog Tsarevna]]''.&lt;ref&gt;James Graham, "[http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html Baba Yaga in Film] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109100659/http://www.endicott-studio.com/crossroads/crBabaYagaF.html |date=2013-01-09 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;  American author [[Elizabeth Winthrop]] wrote a children's book – ''Vasilissa the Beautiful: a Russian Folktale'' (HarperCollins, 1991), illustrated by Alexander Koshkin. There is also a Soviet cartoon – ''[[Vasilisa the Beautiful (1977 film)|Vasilisa the Beautiful]]'', but it is also based on the Frog Tsarevna tale.

Vasilisa appears in the 2007 [[comic book]] ''[[Hellboy: Darkness Calls]]'' to assist Hellboy against [[Koschei| Koschei the Deathless]] with her usual story of the Baba Yaga . The book also includes other characters of slavic folklore, such as a [[Domovoi]] making an appearance.

The novel ''Vassa in the Night'' by Sarah Porter is based on this folktale with a modern twist.&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Sarah (2016). ''Vassa in the Night''. Tor Teen, New York. {{ISBN|9780765380548}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book &lt;i&gt;Vasilisa the Terrible: A Baba Yaga Story&lt;/i&gt; flips the script by painting Vasilisa as a villain and Baba Yaga as an elderly woman who is framed by the young girl.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, April A. (2018). ''Vasilisa the Terrible: A Baba Yaga Story''. {{ISBN|9781980441618}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Goodreads | url = https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38841999-vasilisa-the-terrible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Laura Frankos]]' short story [[Did You Say Chicks?!|"Slue-Foot Sue and the Witch in the Woods"]] (1998) is a satirical pastiche of the story of Vasilisa, subverting convention by supplanting Vasilisa with the Texan [[fakelore]] heroine [[Slue-Foot Sue]].

In 2014, Wael joined [[Google Ventures]] as an Entrepreneur in Residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://fortune.com/2014/05/28/egyptian-democracy-activist-wael-ghonim-joins-google-ventures/ |title=Egyptian democracy activist Wael Ghonim joins Google Ventures |work=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2014, he announced his resignation from Google Ventures, in order to work at a start-up company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Terdiman |first1=Daniel |title=Wael Ghonim, famous Egyptian protester, departs Google Ventures for startup life |url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/12/23/wael-ghonim-famous-egyptian-protester-quits-google-ventures-for-startup-life/ |publisher=VentureBeat |accessdate=26 March 2015 |date=23 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in the Egyptian Revolution of 2011==
In 2010, Wael Ghonim founded a Facebook page titled "We Are All Khaled Said", supporting Khaled Said, a young Egyptian who was tortured to death by police in Alexandria. Wael Ghonim used this page in moving and integrating the anti-government protests of the 25th of Jan revolution. He first made an announcement on the page on 14 January, asking members if they were going to plan on taking to the streets on 25 January and do what Tunisia did? In less than 2 hours he published an event titled "25 يناير على التعذيب والفساد والظلم والبطالة" ["January 25: Revolution against Torture, Corruption, Unemployment and Injustice"]. This was the first invitation and many others followed. He anonymously collaborated with activists on the ground to announce the locations for the protest.

The page also organized interesting activities such as the Silent Stands and the Police Communication Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/110524/20110209/wael-ghonim-google-marketing-executive-egypt-protests-detained-released-face-protestors-facebook-twi.htm |title=Google man Wael Ghonim emerges as the face of Egypt protests |publisher=[[International Business Times]] |date=2011-02-09 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anarchitext.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anarchitext.wordpress.com/2011/03/27/wael-ghonim/ |title=Wael Ghonim " AnarchitexT |publisher=Anarchitext.wordpress.com |date=2011-03-27 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Ghonim persuaded Google to allow him to return to Egypt, citing "personal issues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12400529 |title=Profile: Egypt's Wael Ghonim |publisher=BBC News |date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He came to Egypt to partake in the Egyptian revolution,&lt;ref name="anarchitext.wordpress.com" /&gt; but he disappeared on 27 January during the [[2011 Egyptian protests|nationwide unrest in Egypt]]. His family told [[Al-Arabiya]] and other international media that he was missing. [[Google]] also issued a statement confirming the disappearance. Many bloggers like [[Chris DiBona]] and [[Habib Haddad]] campaigned in an attempt to identify his whereabouts.

On 5 February 2011, Mostafa Alnagar, a major Egyptian opposition figure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Al-Anani |first=Khalil |url=http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=21203 |title=The Young Brotherhood in Search of a New Path |publisher=Ikhwahweb: The [[Muslim Brotherhood]] Official English Website |date=6 October 2009 |accessdate=2011-02-13 |quote=[Y]oung Brotherhood bloggers started engaging in auto-critique and openly began criticizing the movement's leadership, its organizational structures, and its rigid and out-dated political and religious discourse. Amwaj Fi Bahr al-Taghyir (Waves in the Sea of Change) is the most prominent of these blogs, and was established by the 29-year-old dentist and reformist Mustafa al-Naggar. During the 2005 elections, Naggar participated in the Brotherhood's electoral campaign in the hopes of mobilizing people in support of Islamist candidates. However, he has since expressed disappointment over the Brothers' poor showing in the elections, and his writing has begun to focus increasingly on how to transform the Brotherhood into a more open movement and a more effective political party. Naggar has been especially critical of the Brotherhood's political platform, released in August 2007, and he has also attacked the approach of the older generation in dealing with local and regional issues. Naggar's blog additionally serves as a clearinghouse for links to other blog-based critiques of the Brotherhood.}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that Wael Ghonim was alive and detained by the authorities and to be released "within hours".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/t/confirmation-rt-fustat-mo_33997531130101761.html |title=Confirmation??

On 7 February, Ghonim was released after 11 days in detention. Upon his release, he was greeted with cheers and applause when he stated: "We will not abandon our demand and that is the departure of the regime."&lt;ref&gt;May, Theodore, [https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-02-08-egypt-protests_N.htm "Regime won't halt, but rallies must, Egypt's VP says"], ''USA Today'', 9 February 2011. Retrieved 2011-02-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same day, Ghonim appeared on the Egyptian channel DreamTV on the ''10:00 pm'' programme hosted by [[Mona El-Shazly]]. In the interview he praised the protesters and mourned the dead as the host read their names and showed their pictures, eventually rising, "overwhelmed", and walking off camera. The host followed.&lt;ref name="NYT01"&gt;{{cite news |last=Fahim |first=Kareem |author2=Mana El-Naggar |author3=Liam Stack |author4=[[Ed Ou]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/09/world/middleeast/09ghonim.html |title=Emotions of a Reluctant Hero Galvanize Protesters |newspaper=The New York Times |date=9 February 2011 |page=A14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Subtitled Video of Wael Ghonim's Emotional TV Interview |last=Mackey |first=Robert |newspaper=The New York Times |url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/08/subtitled-video-of-wael-ghonims-emotional-tv-interview/ |date=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interview, he also urged that they deserved attention more than he did, and calling for the end of the [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] regime, describing it again as "rubbish".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/middle-east/2011/02/06/live-blog-feb-7-egypt-protests |title=Live blog Feb 7 – Egypt protests |publisher=Al Jazeera Blogs |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://en.news.maktoob.com/20090000569988/Google_Exec_held_in_Egypt_protests_has_been_freed/Article.htm |title=Google: Exec held in Egypt protests has been freed, United States General News |publisher=Maktoob News |year= |accessdate=2011-02-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110210054802/http://en.news.maktoob.com/20090000569988/Google_Exec_held_in_Egypt_protests_has_been_freed/Article.htm |archivedate=10 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming a symbol of the revolution in Egypt,&lt;ref name="CNN-20110209-revolution"&gt;{{cite news |last=Husain |first=Ed |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/02/09/husain.ghonim/ |title=Ghonim electrified Egypt's revolution |publisher=CNN |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110213074347/http://edition.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/02/09/husain.ghonim/ |archivedate=13 February 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ghonim stated that he is "ready to die" for the cause.&lt;ref name="CNN-20110209-ready"&gt;{{cite news |last=King |first=John |url=http://johnkingusa.blogs.cnn.com/2011/02/09/ghonim-im-ready-to-die/ |title=Ghonim: 'I'm ready to die' |publisher=CNN |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end, he gathered himself for a few seconds and tried to make the most of the platform [El-Shazly] had given him. "I want to tell every mother and every father who lost a child, I am sorry, but this is not our mistake," he said. "I swear to God, it's not our mistake. It's the mistake of every one of those in power who doesn't want to let go of it."&lt;ref name="NYT01" /&gt;

On 9 February, Ghonim addressed the crowds in [[Tahrir Square]], telling the protesters: "This is not the time for individuals, or parties, or movements. It's a time for all of us to say just one thing: Egypt above all."&lt;ref name="Casavaria-20110209"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2011/feb/09/wael-ghonim-tahrir-square-video |title=Wael Ghonim addresses thousands in Tahrir Square (video) |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=9 February 2011 |accessdate=9 February 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wael Ghonim also made an appearance on ''[[60 Minutes]]'', sitting down with Harry Smith. During his interview he said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our revolution is like Wikipedia, okay? Everyone is contributing content, [but] you don't know the names of the people contributing the content. This is exactly what happened. Revolution 2.0 in Egypt was exactly the same. Everyone contributing small pieces, bits and pieces. We drew this whole picture of a revolution. And no one is the hero in that picture."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/ghonim-our-revolution-wikipedia |title=Ghonim: "Our Revolution Is Like Wikipedia" |publisher=techPresident |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The scholar [[Fouad Ajami]] writes about the revolution:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"No turbaned ayatollah had stepped forth to summon the crowd. This was not Iran in 1979. A young Google executive, Wael Ghonim, had energized this protest when it might have lost heart, when it could have succumbed to the belief that this regime and its leader were a big, immovable object. Mr. Ghonim was a man of the modern world. He was not driven by piety. The condition of his country—the abject poverty, the crony economy of plunder and corruption, the cruelties and slights handed out to Egyptians in all walks of life by a police state that the people had outgrown and despaired of—had given this young man and others like him their historical warrant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704132204576136442019920256?mod=WSJ_Opinion_LEADTop |work=The Wall Street Journal |first=Fouad |last=Ajami |title=Egypt's 'Heroes With No Names' |date=2011-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Philanthropy==
In 2012, following a book deal he signed, Ghonim decided to donate its proceeds, worth $2.5 million USD, to charity work in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://act.mtv.com/posts/wael-ghonims-new-book-revolution-2-0-will-benefit-charity-work-in-egypt |title=Wael Ghonim's New Book Revolution 2.0 Will Benefit Charity Work In Egypt |publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded [[Tahrir Academy]], a nonprofit online collaborative learning platform, which aims at transforming young Egyptians' characters. The goal is future leaders who are critical thinkers. He currently serves as the Chairperson of the foundation.&lt;ref name="Nabadat – Tahrir Academy"/&gt; In 2015, the Academy halted its activities because it was no longer able to secure funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.madamasr.com/en/2015/08/13/feature/politics/tahrir-academy-ngo-halts-its-activities/|title=Tahrir Academy NGO halts its activities|work=Mada Masr|access-date=2018-01-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--
== International Monetary Fund (IMF) annual meeting ==
Wael Ghonim attended the International Monetary Fund (IMF) meeting in 2011, stating that "I feel like Joe the Plumber", referring to the conservative activist who became a shorthand for populist outrage during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. "When I was coming here, a lot of people were criticizing me for it. The perception is that the IMF was part of the problem. It made these regimes survive and put these countries into debt." Ghonim said he had come to the IMF to represent "people like me who don't understand economics", to which IMF chief [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] replied, "Wael, you understand a lot more than you say."

According to Ghonim, the kind of macroeconomic discussions at the panel were far from the mindset of activists in Tahrir Square:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Honestly, we were just thinking of how to get rid of the nightmare, not to start dreaming. I went to the street because of two things: I hate it when I see people eating from the trash. I work for a corporation, I'm well paid, and a lot of us just sympathized with those people, but they're not willing to pay the price of really helping them out. It's not just me; it's thousands of Egyptians. One of my friends who lost his eye [during the protests] actually drives a Ferrari. He went on the day of 25th. The second was dignity. We wanted our dignity back. And dignity does have an economic aspect."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also took issue with Strauss-Kahn's characterization of "mistakes" made by the international community during the Mubarak era:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's such an understatement to say mistake. To me, what was happening was a crime. The way the international community was dealing with the injustice and dictators in the region was basically a crime—partners in crime.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ghonim continued his criticism of the IMF's aid to the Mubarak regime and expressed a hope that the days of Egypt relying on international aid would soon be over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Joshua Keating |url=foreignpolicy.com/2011/04/15/wael-the-plumber-egypts-google-revolutionary-mixes-it-up-at-the-imf/ |title=Wael the Plumber: Egypt's Google revolutionary mixes it up at the IMF |publisher=FP |date=15 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role after the revolution==
In April 2011 Ghonim announced he was taking a "long term [[sabbatical]]" from Google in order to start a "technology focused [[NGO]] to help fight poverty &amp; foster education in Egypt".&lt;ref name="cnnngo" /&gt;

In May 2011 Ghonim said that he has signed a "Revolution 2.0" book deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Egypt uprising figure Wael Ghonim signs book deal |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13351284 |publisher=BBC News |date=10 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; All proceeds from the book will go to the [[NGO]] he started in Egypt to fight poverty and provide education.

== Awards ==
Wael Ghonim topped ''Time'' magazine's yearly list of the world's 100 most influential people.
On 26 April, he arrived in New York to be honored at the 2011 Time 100 Gala ceremony where he began his speech with a moment of silence to mark those killed in protests around the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Richard Stengel |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2069043,00.html |title=A TIME Gala and A Royal Wedding |work=Time |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/10559/Egypt/Politics-/Wael-Ghonim-tops-Times--most-influential-.aspx |title=Wael Ghonim tops Time's 100 most influential – Politics – Egypt |publisher=Ahram Online |date=2011-04-21 |accessdate=2011-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine's annual report stated Ghonim as the primary contributor to the promotion and coordination of the movement of Egyptian youth through "Facebook", adding that Ghonim came to international fame via commercial news outlets word of mouth after his leadership of the Egyptian revolution.&lt;ref name="Bhoyrul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/8600263-arabian-business-wael-ghoneims-second-most-influential-arabs|title="Arabian Business": Wael Ghoneim's second most influential Arabs|author=Mohamed Abd el Fattah|date=27 March 2011|publisher=Allvoices.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403121531/http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/8600263-arabian-business-wael-ghoneims-second-most-influential-arabs|archivedate=3 April 2011|accessdate=2011-07-08}} &lt;!-- The formatting renders this article unreadable; try copying all and pasting into a plain-text editor such as Notepad --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==

== Criticism ==
Ghonim's social media feeds and public statements have been attracting increasing criticism. Shortly before the resignation of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Ghonim presented a deal to the Egyptian people according to which Mubarak could have remained in Cairo with an "honorary status". He later appeared on Al Arabiya TV and called the rumor Mubarak-regime propaganda, and added: "I am stronger than Hosni Mubarak. I am stronger than Omar Sulaiman."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20031473-503543.html |work=CBS News |title=Ghonim: Mubarak Must Go "Immediately" |deadurl=yes |date=2011-02-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104085421/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20031473-503543.html |archivedate=4 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 18 May 2011, a major campaign on Twitter gained momentum with the hashtag #unfollowedghonimbecause, criticising Ghonim for various failings and an exaggerated focus on the Egyptian economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Curt Hopkins |date=20 May 2011 |title=#unfollowedghonimbecause: Egyptians Use Twitter to Criticize Revolutionary Leader |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/unfollowedghonimbecause_egyptians_use_twitter_to_c.php |publisher=readwrite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also been criticised for failing to publicly remedy doubts about the genesis of the We are all Khalid Said Facebook page, which is believed to have had at least one more initiator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Belabbes Benkredda |date=24 May 2011 |title=A Tale Of The Lone Hero |publisher=The European |url=http://theeuropean-magazine.com/273-benkredda-belabbes/274-the-rise-of-wael-ghonim |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327193843/http://theeuropean-magazine.com/273-benkredda-belabbes/274-the-rise-of-wael-ghonim |archivedate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the above criticism, some of Ghonim's supporters have launched a Facebook page, trying to declare him the spokesperson for the Egyptian revolutionaries—a role that, at any rate, Ghonim has consistently rejected. More than 400,000 people have joined the page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/Authorize.Ghoneim |title=Facebook page Authorize. Ghoneim |publisher=Facebook |accessdate=2011-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629083559/https://www.facebook.com/Authorize.Ghoneim |archivedate=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, more than 360,000 people joined his personal page on Facebook and more than 3,000,000 people joined the "We are all Khaled Saeed" page, which is run by him and another administrator, revealed to be [[AbdelRahman Mansour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Linda Herrera |date=25 January 2013 |title=Meet AbdelRahman Mansour Who Made 25 January A Date to Remember |publisher=[[Jadaliyya]] |url= http://www.jadaliyya.com/pages/index/9772/meet-abdelrahman-mansour-who-made-25-january-a-dat}}&lt;/ref&gt;
