'''Agbirigba''' is a [[cant (language)|cant]] (or [[argot]]) based on the Ogbakiri dialect of the Nigerian language [[Ikwerre language|Ikwerre]] of [[Port Harcourt]]. There are about thirty speakers, from a persecuted section of the community.&lt;ref name=AAN&gt;[http://www.rci.rutgers.edu/~akinlabi/Agbirigba-Akinlabi-Ndimele.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Agbirigba is unintelligible to other speakers of Ikwerre, but the rule for its derivation is simple: the consonant ''t'' is added before every CV syllable (or, more accurately, every CV [[mora (linguistics)|mora]]). Some speakers add an [[epenthetic]] vowel to break up the resulting consonant cluster.

==Derivation==
The addition of the ''t'' results in [[consonant cluster]]s that do not occur in Ikwerre or other local languages. Some speakers pronounce Agbirigba with the resulting clusters. For speakers to break them up with vowels, the vowels are all [[high vowel|high]] (one of the four vowels {{IPA|/i ɪ u ʊ/}}), and match the subsequent vowel in [[Advanced tongue root|ATR]], [[back vowel|backness]], [[nasal vowel|nasality]] and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]]. 

An NCV sequence becomes NtCV. For example, ''m̀fù'' 'horn' becomes ''ǹtfù'' or ''ǹtùfù''. 

There are some complications to this: if the following vowel is /a/, with no ATR quality for the epenthetic vowel to match, then the epenthetic vowel will be /i/ or /u/ depending on, apparently, whether the following consonant is coronal or velar, and if the tone of the following syllable (whether CV or CVV) is complex (rising or falling), then the first element of that tone will move to the epenthetic vowel.

;Examples

*''ńkétʃí vò ré ídʒí'' "Nkechi bought a yam"
becomes:
*''ńtkéttʃí tvò tré ítdʒí''
or 
*''ńtíkétítʃí tùvò tíré ítídʒí''

Here all the vowels are ATR, so the epenthetic vowels are /i/ or /u/ depending on whether the following vowel is front (/e/ or /i/) or back (/o/ or /u/). There is no t before the word-initial syllabic nasal in ''Nkechi'' or word-initial vowel in ''iji'', as neither is a CV syllable.

*''ŋ́gɔ́zɪ́ wṹ lêm'' "Ngozi died"
becomes:
*''ńtgɔ́tzɪ́ twṹ tlêm''
or 
*''ńtʊ́gɔ́tɪ́zɪ́ tṹwṹ tílèm''

Here we have some RTR and nasal vowels. With the high&amp;ndash;low tone on ''lêm'', the high element shifts to the epenthetic vowel for ''tílèm''.

'''Amauta''' (meaning "master" or "wise one" in [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]) was a title for teachers in the [[Inca empire]], especially of children of the nobility.

According to Fray Martin de Murua, a missionary in Peru, education in the Inca empire was instituted in schools called ''Yachaywasi'' or "Houses of Knowledge" in [[Cuzco]]. Students were children of the Inca nobility, the future rulers. The subjects were the moral standards, religious and government tenets, math, science, the [[Quechua language]], history, medicine, religious philosophy and cosmological ideas of the earth and the universe.

The original ''Yachaywasi'' was constructed and inaugurated by [[Inca Roca]]. More schools like this were built as the empire grew, and were the centers of teaching the primary ideologies, histories and philosophies of the empire. The amautas maintained this knowledge through an oral tradition and passed it on to future generations.

{{nihongo|'''Amezaiku'''|飴細工}} is Japanese candy craft artistry. An artist takes multi-colored [[taffy (candy)|taffy]] and, using their hands and other tools such as tweezers and scissors, creates a sculpture. Amezaiku artists also paint their sculpted candy with edible dyes to give the finished work more character. Animals and insects are common amezaiku shapes created to appeal to children. Intricate animal characters are created with expert speed. Some amezaiku artists are also [[busking|street performers]] who perform magic tricks and tell stories along with their candy craft entertainment.

== History ==
During the [[Heian period]], the art of amezaiku was used in Japan for candy offerings made at temples in [[Kyoto]].&lt;ref name=jgov_pr/&gt; The amezaiku craft spread beyond the temple during the [[Edo period]], when many forms of [[misemono|street performance]] flourished in Japan&lt;ref name=about_kyoto/&gt; and when its base ingredient, ''[[mizuame]]'', became widely available.&lt;ref name=Wetherille/&gt; In [[Edo]] it emerged in its present artistic form.&lt;ref name="Amezaiku.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EncycJpnCult/&gt;

== Methods ==
The candy base is prepared beforehand, using a starchy syrup recipe that requires careful monitoring to ensure proper consistency and appearance. The mixture is kneaded and pulled by hand, and formed into a large ball to be stored until ready to use. At the stall, the candy ball is heated to make it pliable again. The artist puts their hand into the hot mass to pinch up the material necessary; this too is a skill, as the artist must learn to tolerate the painful heat of the medium. The hot candy is quickly rolled and mounted on a stick, then pulled, twisted and clipped into form, usually an animal of some kind and often intricate. Speed is necessary to the art since the sculpture must be completed before the candy cools and hardens again.&lt;ref name=kiritani/&gt;

One method formerly used in sculpting amezaiku was blowing into the candy by means of a straw, similar to glass-blowing. This practice was eventually prohibited in Japan as unhygienic, although other means of introducing blown air may be used.&lt;ref name=kiritani/&gt;

In [[Ireland|Irish]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[civil engineering]], a '''banksman''' is the person who directs the operation of a crane or larger vehicle from the point near where loads are attached and detached. The term 'dogman' may be used in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], while 'spotter' is the more common term in [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Scott|first= John|title=Dictionary Of Civil Engineering|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|edition=3rd|date=1992|pages=401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary==
Crane or large vehicle drivers do not always have clear visibility of the loading area, especially when [[tower crane]]s are employed. The banksman is in charge of the crane movements from the point of loading and unloading. They may use a system of hand signals or a radio link.

A banksman may also be responsible for directing the movement and loading/unloading of lorries, or directing the movement of other plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Banksmen and signallers|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/construction/faq-banksmen.htm|publisher=Health and Safety Executive|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A banksman may also control the movements of an excavator, by carefully monitoring the bucket for any obstructions or underground services.

==Usage timeline ==

*1825: the man stationed at the bank or top of a pit who unhooked and emptied the laden [[Corf (mining)|corve]]s [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/corves] into carts or wagons, from a frame or stage.
*1849: the man who drew the full tubs from the cages at the surface, when wound up by the engine, and replaced them with empty ones; he also put the full tubs to the weighing machine, and thence to the skreens, upon which he teemed the coals. It was also his duty to keep an account of the quantity of coals and stones drawn each day. 
*1894: person who controlled the unloading and loading of the cage at the pit top, and signalled the descent of the workmen.

The '''Black Flash''' is a [[fictional]] [[comic book]] [[fictional character|character]] from [[DC Comics]]. Created by writers [[Grant Morrison]] and [[Mark Millar]], and artist [[Ron Wagner]], the character had cameos in ''The Flash'' (vol. 2) #138 (June 1998),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=61784 |title='&amp;#39;Flash'&amp;#39; #138 at the Grand Comics Database |publisher=Comics.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; before appearing in full in ''The Flash'' #141 (September 1998).

==Fictional character background==
=== Original depiction ===
The Black Flash essentially fulfills the same role as [[Death (DC Comics)|Death]] for those who possess super-speed in the DC Universe, returning the speedster to their power source: the [[Speed Force]]. It is reportedly seen before the deaths of [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]] and [[Johnny Quick]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} [[Max Mercury]], having had several near-death experiences, has also seen the Black Flash.

It is not clear whether the Black Flash exists because speedsters are simply too fast for traditional Death to capture, or as some sort of bizarre side-effect to their Speed Force connection.

It came for [[Wally West]] to draw back to the Speed Force, but instead took [[Linda Park (comics)|Linda Park]]. Having seen portents of Wally's death, Max Mercury and [[Jesse Quick]] intercepted Wally before reaching the museum where Linda was waiting, with Linda thus being struck by the lightning that was meant to kill Wally. It later returns to try to take Wally again, freezing time except for those who possess a connection to the Speed Force. Max Mercury, [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], and Jesse Quick all attempt to assist Wally by distracting the Black Flash; Wally finally defeats the Black Flash by racing the creature to the end of time, to a point where Death would have no meaning, causing the creature to dissipate.

The Black Flash appears to [[Bart Allen]] when the Flash loses his powers while battling the Rogues at the [[Getty Center]]. Despite a clash with [[Inertia (DC Comics)|Inertia]] (another possible candidate for the Black Flash), Bart is killed shortly thereafter by the panicked Rogues when it appears Bart would win, even without powers.

Most recently, the Black Flash is revealed to represent the dark aspect of the Speed Force, which is responsible for the empowerment of Wally's children. His connection to death is limited to those connected to the Speed Force. While an issue{{Issue|date=April 2009}} of ''[[Captain Atom]]'' suggests Death of the Endless, the Black Racer, and Nekron are all aspects of the same force, [[Neil Gaiman]] (creator of Death of the Endless) disagrees with this idea, stating that his creation is the ultimate personification of Death{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}.

During the ''[[Final Crisis]]'', Wally theorizes that the [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]] pursuing himself and Barry is in fact the Black Flash.

A charred corpse, appearing to be the Black Flash, was found in [[Iowa]] by two boys in ''[[The Flash: Rebirth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash: Rebirth'' #1 (April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Barry Allen ===
Later when discovering the body, '''[[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]''' is transformed into the next Black Flash, but the state is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash: Rebirth'' #2 (May 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; It's revealed that Professor Zoom has altered the Speed Force which results in Barry's Black Flash transformation.&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash: Rebirth'' #3 (June 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Flash: Rebirth'' #4 (August 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eobard Thawne ===
The broken-necked corpse of '''[[Eobard Thawne]]''' is reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. Equipped with a [[Power ring (weapon)|black power ring]], Thawne declared himself as the Black Flash,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Blackest Night: The Flash]]'' #1 (December 2009). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #2 (January 2010). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night: The Flash'' #3 (February 2010). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; until Thawne's corpse is brought back to life.&lt;ref&gt;[[Johns, Geoff]] (w). [[Reis, Ivan]] (p), Albert, Oclair (i). ''[[Blackest Night]]'' #8 (March 2010). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;
==Other versions==
* The [[Ame-Comi Girls]] universe version of Black Flash is [[Jesse Quick]]. &lt;ref&gt;''Ame-Con Girls: Featuring Duela Dent'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;
* A demonic Black Flash (also known as the [[Speed Demon (comics)|Speed Demon]] and [[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]]) appears in ''[[Smallville (TV Series)|Smallville]]'' [[Smallville Season 11|season 11 comics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville Season 11 #9''&lt;/ref&gt;  This version seeks to siphon off [[Bart Allen|Bart Allen/Impulse]]'s speed but comes into conflict with Impulse and [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Superman]]. It's learned that the Black Flash needs the souls of both Impulse and the retired [[Jay Garrick]] as they belong to the Speed Force. As Bart is the fastest usurping Jay as he's given up trying to battle the Black Flash, the demon craves his speed more. In the final battle over [[Las Vegas]], Impulse gives the demon his full speed and that ends up killing them both, leaving the classic Flash symbol in the desert.&lt;ref&gt;''Smallville Season 11 #12''&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==
===Television===
* A different depiction of Black Flash appears on the live-action series ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/25/the-flash-the-race-of-his-life-review|title=The Flash: "The Race of His Life" Review|date=May 24, 2016|accessdate=July 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]''.&lt;ref name="BlackFlashArrowverse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvline.com/2017/01/08/the-flash-black-flash-returns-teddy-sears-season-3/|title=The Flash's Zoom to Resurface as Black Flash, on Multiple CW Shows|publisher=TV Line|last=Mitovich|first=Matt|date=January 8, 2017|accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Time Wraiths transform '''[[Hunter Zolomon]]''' ([[Teddy Sears]]) into a Grim Reaper-esque enforcer for the Speed Force. 

===Video Games===
* The Black Flash appears in ''[[Justice League Heroes: The Flash]]'' for the [[Game Boy Advance]]. When the player dies, the [[Wally West|Flash]] is chased by the Black Flash. If the player avoids being caught, the Flash is rewarded with a chance at continuing the game, coming back with low health and without losing the current life. After each death, escape from the Black Flash becomes increasingly difficult.
* The Eobard Thawne version of Black Flash is featured in ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]'' as a playable alternate skin for the [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] as part of a limited exclusive challenge. 
* The Black Flash (identified as the '''[[Black Racer (DC Comics)|Black Racer]]''') is mentioned in ''[[Injustice 2]]''. In the Reverse-Flash's fight dialogue, the Black Flash is mentioned when the Reverse-Flash faces his own doppelganger, [[Deadshot]] and [[Doctor Fate]] in battle; the Reverse-Flash says "the Black Flash is coming".

'''Boonwurrung''' (also [[anglicised]] as ''Bunurong, Bun wurrung'', among other spellings)&lt;ref&gt;Other spellings and names include ''Boonerwrung, Boon Wurrung, Putnaroo, Thurung, Toturin,'' and ''Gippsland dialect'' (AusAnthrop Australian Aboriginal tribal database, [http://www.ausanthrop.net/resources/ausanthrop_db/detail.php?id_search=65 ''Detailed record of the Bunurong''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707022245/http://www.ausanthrop.net/resources/ausanthrop_db/detail.php?id_search=65 |date=July 7, 2010 }}, AusAnthrop anthropological research, resources and documentation on the Aborigines of Australia. Retrieved May 30, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[indigenous Australian language]] traditionally spoken by the [[Bunurong people|Boonwurrung people]] of the [[Kulin]] Nation of Central [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] prior to [[European settlement of Australia|European settlement]].  The last remaining traditional native speakers died in the early 20th century, however there is an active revival movement underway in the Boonwurrung community.

== Geographic distribution ==
Boonwurrung was spoken by six clans along the coast from the [[Werribee River]], across the [[Mornington Peninsula]], [[Western Port Bay]] to [[Wilsons Promontory]].

== Related languages ==
Boonwurrung is closely related to the [[Woiwurrung language]], with which it shares over 90% of its vocabulary, and to a lesser degree with [[Taungurong language|Taungurong]] spoken north of the [[Great Dividing Range]] in the area of the [[Goulburn River]].  Woiwurrung, Taungurong and Boonwurrung have been considered by linguists to be dialects of a single Central Victorian language, whose range stretched from almost [[Echuca]] in the north, to [[Wilsons Promontory]] in the south.&lt;ref&gt;[Wathawurrung and the Colac Languages of Southern Victoria, Barry J. Blake (1998) in Pacific Linguistics, Research School of Pacific and Asian Studies, Australian National University]&lt;/ref&gt;

R. Brough Smyth wrote in 1878 that "''The dialects of the Wooeewoorong or Wawoorong tribe (River Yarra) and the Boonoorong tribe (Coast) are the same.  Twenty-three words out of thirty are, making allowances for differences of spelling and pronunciation, identical; five have evidently the same roots, and only two are widely different".''&lt;ref&gt;[The Aborigines of Victoria, with Notes Relating to the Habits of the Natives of other Parts of Australia and Tasmania, compiled from various sources for the Government of Victoria by R. Brough Smyth (1878)]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|camaieu}}
'''Camaïeu''' (also called ''en camaïeu'') is a technique that employs two or three [[tint]]s of a single [[color]], other than gray, to create a [[monochromatic]] image without regard to local or realistic color. When a picture is monochromatically rendered in gray, it is called [[grisaille]]; when in yellow, [[cirage]].{{ref|reference1}}

The term is also applied to monochrome painting in enamels. This technique uses a buildup of white enamel to create highlights and light areas. However, instead of using a black background, as in grisaille, transparent enamel is laid in first, beneath the whites. This technique is frequently used on [[snuffbox]]es, watches and medallions.

''{{lang|fr|Camaïeu}}'' can also refer, following the French usage, to [[chiaroscuro]] [[woodcut]] [[old master print|prints]] that imitate highlighted drawing on tinted paper. However, the correct term in English for these is ''chiaroscuro woodcuts''.

This French word once was synonymous with ''[[cameo (carving)|cameo]]'', but its meaning became restricted in the early eighteenth century.{{ref|reference2}}

Camaïeu is also a registered trademark of a manufacturer.

'''''Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Akumajō Dracula: Sōgetsu no Jūjika'''''|悪魔城ドラキュラ 蒼月の十字架|literally ''Devil's Castle Dracula: Cross of the Blue Moon''}}&lt;ref name="translation"&gt;{{cite video game |title=Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles |developer=[[Konami]] |publisher=Konami|date=2007-10-23|quote='''Japanese:''' 悪魔城の城主、邪心の神、ドラキュラ伯爵の復活であった。 '''Konami translation by Ken Ogasawara:''' Dracula, lord of darkness, master of the devil's castle, walks among us.}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} is an [[action-adventure game]] developed and published by [[Konami]]. It is part of Konami's ''[[Castlevania]]'' [[video game series]] and the first ''Castlevania'' game released on the [[Nintendo DS]]. The game is the sequel to ''[[Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow]]'' and incorporates many elements from its predecessor. ''Dawn of Sorrow'' was commercially successful. It sold more than 15,000 units in its first week in Japan and 164,000 units in the United States during the three months after its initial release.&lt;ref name="GAFJapanSales"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesarefun.com/news.php?newsid=5491 |title=GAF – News – Japan: Weekly software sales for 8/22 – 8/28 |publisher=gamesarefun.com |author=Freund, Josh |date=2005-08-31 |accessdate=2007-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071128052932/http://www.gamesarefun.com/news.php?newsid=5491 |archivedate=2007-11-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DoSSalesFigures"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rpgamer.com/editor/2006/q2/041706bb.html |title=RPGamer – Editorials – Crunching Numbers: DS vs. GBA |publisher=RPGamer |author=Boulette, Bryan |accessdate=2007-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080407135754/http://www.rpgamer.com/editor/2006/q2/041706bb.html |archivedate=2008-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dawn of Sorrow'' continues the story of ''Aria of Sorrow''. Dracula has been completely defeated, and his powers assumed by his reincarnation, [[Soma Cruz]]. With the help of his allies, Soma avoids becoming the new dark lord. A cult forms to bring forth a new dark lord by killing Soma. Soma and his allies move to ensure a new dark lord is not created.

''Dawn of Sorrow'' incorporates many features from earlier ''Castlevania'' games: the combination of elements from [[platform game]]s and [[role-playing video game]]s, the "Tactical Soul" system featured in ''Aria of Sorrow'' and a dark, gothic atmosphere.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/castlevania/review.html |title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Review |author=Mueller, Greg |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=2005-10-05 |accessdate=2007-06-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021052510/http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/castlevania/review.html |archivedate=2007-10-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/655/655830p1.html |title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Review |author=Harris, Craig |publisher=IGN |date=2005-10-04 |accessdate=2007-06-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070517120846/http://ds.ign.com/articles/655/655830p1.html |archivedate=2007-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dawn of Sorrow'' also introduces new gameplay elements, like the "Magic Seal" system, which requires the use of the [[Nintendo DS#Input and output|DS stylus]] to draw a pattern to defeat powerful enemies,&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview" /&gt; a distinctive [[anime]] character design,&lt;ref name="IgarashiInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.showJapanPage&amp;Japan_ID=57 |title=TGS2005 – Koji Igarashi |author=Barres, Nick Des |publisher=playonline.com |accessdate=2007-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928131358/http://www.playmagazine.com/index.php?fuseaction=SiteMain.showJapanPage&amp;Japan_ID=57 |archivedate=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a multiplayer mode, where two players compete for fastest times on a prerendered level.&lt;ref name="IGNReview" /&gt; The game received high scores from many [[video game journalism|video game publications]], and was considered one of the best games on the Nintendo DS for 2005. The game was re-released in Japan on June 29, 2006, and later in North America during 2007 as part of the "Konami the Best" line.&lt;ref name="DoSReleaseSummary"/&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:DawnofSorrowGameplay.jpg|thumb|right|An image of gameplay, with the primary character, [[Soma Cruz]], using the Flame Demon soul. The upper screen shows the character's statistics and information on the enemy.]]
During the game, the player controls the onscreen character from a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies. Like previous games in the series, and most [[role-playing game]]s, characters [[Levels up|level up]] each time they earn a set number of [[experience point]]s from defeating enemies; each level gained increases the character's [[statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]], thus improving their performance in battle. Statistic examples include [[hit point]]s, the amount of damage a character can receive; [[magic point]]s, which determine the number of times a character can use magical attacks; strength, the power of a character's physical attacks; and intelligence, the power of a character's magical spells.&lt;ref name="GUIDE10"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon encountering an enemy, the player can use a variety of weapons to attack and defeat the enemy. Despite the game being set in 2036, the weapon choices are largely [[medieval]], including [[sword]]s, [[axe]]s, and [[spear]]s, although [[handgun]]s and a [[rocket-propelled grenade]] are available.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; These weapons differ in their damage output, their range, and the speed of the attack.&lt;ref name="1UPReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3144293|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051214082600/http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3144293|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2005-12-14|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow DS Review|author=Parish, Jeremy|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|date=2005-10-03|accessdate=2007-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dawn of Sorrow'', like most games in the ''Castlevania'' series, is set in a castle, which is subdivided into various areas.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt;  Areas of the castle differ in their composition, including monsters and terrain features. In addition, each area has its own unique piece of [[theme music]] that plays while the player is in that area.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; The character moves around the environment based on the player's choices; however, the items the player has restricts the areas the character can move into, like most [[platform game]]s.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; Progression, however, is not linear, as players are free to explore the parts of the castle they have access to, and can backtrack or move forward as they see fit.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt;

===Tactical Soul===
The primary method for the player to gain additional abilities in the game is the absorption of souls via the Tactical Soul system originally featured in ''Aria of Sorrow''.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt; Except for human enemies and the game's final opponent, the player can absorb all enemies' souls. The chances for absorbing a soul varies on the enemy, as certain enemies will release souls more regularly than others.&lt;ref name="GUIDE14"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can absorb multiple copies of the same soul; many of these souls will increase in effectiveness depending on the number of the same soul a player possesses.&lt;ref name="1UPReview"/&gt; Souls provide a variety of effects and are separated into four categories: Bullet, Guardian, Enchant, and Ability souls. The player can have only one type of Bullet, Guardian, and Enchant soul equipped at any given time. However, when the player acquires the "Dopplegänger" soul, they can have two different weapon and soul setups, and switch between them at will.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt; Players can trade souls wirelessly using two ''Dawn of Sorrow'' game cards.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;

Bullet souls are often projectiles and consume a set amount of magic points upon use.&lt;ref name="GUIDE12"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guardian souls provide continuous effects including transforming into mythical creatures, defensive abilities, and the summoning of [[familiar spirit|familiar]]s.&lt;ref name="GUIDE12"/&gt; The movement and attacking of familiars can be directly controlled with the [[Nintendo DS#Input and output|stylus]].&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; Guardian souls continually drain magic points so long as they are activated.&lt;ref name="GUIDE12"/&gt; Several Guardian souls can be used in with Bullet souls to execute special attacks called Tactical Soul combos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Official Strategy Guide| publisher = DoubleJump Publishing| year = 2005| first1 = Alicia| last1 = Ashby| first2 = Thomas| last2 = Wilde| pages = 246–247| chapter = Hidden Stuff| isbn = 0-9741700-7-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Enchant souls offer statistical bonuses and resistance against several forms of attack. They are passive, and require no magic points to remain active.&lt;ref name="GUIDE13"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ability souls give the player new abilities and are required to move into certain areas of the castle. They are always active, and therefore not equipped—nor do they consume magic points.&lt;ref name="GUIDE13"/&gt; Some examples include the abilities to break ice blocks with the stylus and to double-jump.&lt;ref name="GUIDE13"/&gt;

Souls can also be spent to permanently transform a character's weapon.&lt;ref name="GameSpyReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/castlevania/655359p1.html |title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Review |author=Leeper, Justin |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |date=2005-10-04 |accessdate=2007-01-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205070229/http://ds.gamespy.com/nintendo-ds/castlevania/655359p1.html |archivedate=2008-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Yoko Belnades]]' shop, the player can remove certain souls from their inventory to change their weapon into a stronger form.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; Certain weapons can only be acquired by using souls to strengthen a lesser form of the weapon.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; Souls are also used in the "Enemy Set" mode, where a player builds a custom scenario.&lt;ref name="GUIDE20"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The player can place monsters inside rooms if they have acquired the monster's soul in the main game, but boss enemies cannot be added to any scenario, even if the player has the boss' soul.&lt;ref name="GUIDE20"/&gt; Two players using two Nintendo DS consoles can compete in these scenarios, with the winner being the one with the fastest time completing the course.&lt;ref name="GameSpyReview"/&gt;

===Magic Seal===
[[File:MagicSeal.jpg|thumb|right|A Magic Seal presented after reducing a boss's health to zero.]]
The Magic Seal system is a new feature introduced in ''Dawn of Sorrow'' that uses of the [[Nintendo DS#Input and output|DS touchscreen]].&lt;ref name="GameSpyReview"/&gt; Once the player reduces the hit points of a "[[boss (video games)|boss]]" enemy to zero, a circle will appear, and the game will automatically draw a pattern connecting any number of smaller circles on the circumference of the larger circle.&lt;ref name="GUIDE6"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, the player is prompted to draw the same pattern on the touchscreen in a set amount of time.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; If the player fails to draw the pattern accurately within the time limit, the boss will regain health and the battle will resume.&lt;ref name="GUIDE7"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; If successful, the boss will be defeated.&lt;ref name="GUIDE7"/&gt; More powerful boss enemies require higher level Magic Seals, which have more intricate and complex patterns as the level increases and are found over the course of the game.

===Julius Mode===
After the player completes the game with either the bad ending or the best ending, Julius Mode, similar to that in ''Aria of Sorrow'' is unlocked.&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt; In storyline terms, Julius Mode follows the assumption that Soma succumbed to his dark power and became the new dark lord.&lt;ref name="JuliusArikadoComments"&gt;'''Julius Belmont:''' "So...Soma has become the dark lord. I have no other choice...The battles of the past are to be waged once again..." / '''Genya Arikado:''' "I had assumed that he would have equipped the talisman from Mina... It would have protected him. But alas, I will have to unleash my power..." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new game can then be started from the main menu in Julius Mode.&lt;ref name="GUIDE4"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Konami|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow North American instruction manual|year=2005|publisher=Konami|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Julius Mode the playable characters include [[Julius Belmont]], [[Yoko Belnades]], and [[Alucard (Castlevania)|Alucard]].&lt;ref name="YahooGamesReview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videogames.yahoo.com/ds/castlevania-dawn-of-sorrow/review-400663|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Review &amp;#124; Nintendo DS Game Reviews|publisher=[[Yahoo!

Although these abilities remain static throughout the entire game, the characters' statistics can improve by acquiring enough experience points to level up.&lt;ref name="YahooGamesReview"/&gt; The castle layout and enemies are the same except for the final battle, which is against Soma.&lt;ref name="FinalBattle"&gt;'''Julius Belmont:''' "Soma... It's time I fulfilled my promise to you." / '''Yoko Belnades:''' "I'm sorry, Soma. I will free you from your torment." / '''Alucard:''' "Soma...I never wanted it to end this way...But I can't allow you to wreak havoc anymore..." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==

===Setting===
''Dawn of Sorrow'' is set in the [[fictional universe]] of the ''Castlevania'' series. The primary premise of the series is the struggle of the vampire hunters of the [[List of Castlevania characters|Belmont clan]] against the vampire [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]] and his legacy. Before the events of ''[[Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow]]'', Dracula was permanently defeated and his castle sealed within a solar eclipse.&lt;ref name="GameSpyAriaImpressions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/castlevania-aria-of-sorrow/5542p1.html |title=GameSpy: Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow Preview |author=Nutt, Christian |publisher=[[GameSpy]] |date=2003-01-18 |accessdate=2007-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210105825/http://gba.gamespy.com/gameboy-advance/castlevania-aria-of-sorrow/5542p1.html |archivedate=February 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With Dracula dead, a prophecy relating to who would inherit his powers drove the events of ''Aria of Sorrow'', with the protagonist, [[Soma Cruz]], realizing that he was Dracula's reincarnation.&lt;ref name="DracProphecy"&gt;'''Soma:''' "So...you are trying to tell me now that Dracula has been resurrected?" / '''Graham:''' "No. Dracula perished in 1999.

But vampire hunters destroyed him completely. They ended his regeneration cycle by sealing his castle...the symbol of his demonic power, inside the darkness of an eclipse." / '''Soma:''' "And that eclipse is where we are now?" / '''Graham:''' "Yes, but there's still more to the story." / '''Soma:''' "There's more?" / '''Graham:''' "In the year 2035, a new master will come to the castle, and he will inherit ALL of Dracula's powers." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2003-05-06 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Game Boy Advance }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GameSpotHandsOn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/castlevania/news.html?page=1&amp;sid=6124597|title=Castlevania for DS (working title) Exclusive E3 2005 Hands-On|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|author=Shoemaker, Brad|date=2005-05-16|accessdate=2007-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soma manages to escape his fate of becoming the new dark lord with the help of his allies.&lt;ref name="GameSpotHandsOn"/&gt; ''Dawn of Sorrow'' takes place one year after the events of ''Aria of Sorrow'', when Soma believes that his inherited powers have been lost.&lt;ref name="DoSBeginning"&gt;'''Mina Hakuba:''' "And what was it called?

===Characters===
{{Main article|List of Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow characters}}
The primary playable character in ''Dawn of Sorrow'' is [[Soma Cruz]], the [[reincarnation]] of [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]], the longtime [[antagonist]] of the ''Castlevania'' series.&lt;ref name="OfficialCastlevaniaWebsite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.konami-data.com/officialsites/castlevania|title=Official ''Castlevania'' website|publisher=[[Konami]]|accessdate=2007-06-09 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070929060549/http://www.konami-data.com/officialsites/castlevania &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mina Hakuba]], the daughter of the priest of the Hakuba [[Shinto shrine|shrine]] supports him in his quest; [[List of Castlevania: Aria of Sorrow and Dawn of Sorrow characters#Genya Arikado|Genya Arikado]], a mysterious government agent dealing primarily with the supernatural; [[Julius Belmont]], the latest member of the [[List of Castlevania characters|Belmont clan]] of vampire hunters featured in the series; [[Yoko Belnades]], a [[witchcraft|witch]] in the service of the [[Roman Catholic Church]]; and [[Hammer (Castlevania)|Hammer]], a [[vendor]] of military material who retains a large information network.&lt;ref name="OfficialCastlevaniaWebsite" /&gt;

A cult dedicated to the resurrection of the dark lord serves as the game's [[antagonist]]s. [[Celia Fortner]] is a shadow priestess heading the cult.

By shattering Dracula's soul." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Story===
One year after the events in ''Aria of Sorrow'', Soma is living peacefully, and believes that his powers have been lost.&lt;ref name="DoSBeginning"/&gt; A woman who identifies herself as Celia Fortner, appears and summons several monsters. Arikado arrives to help Soma defeat the monsters, after which Soma absorbs their souls. Celia retreats, proclaiming that she will destroy Soma. Soma expresses disbelief at the return of his powers, but Arikado reveals that his powers were never lost, only dormant.&lt;ref name="PowerRetention"&gt;'''Soma Cruz:''' "Yeah, I'm fine. But that power...It returned! Arikado, what's going on?" / '''Genya Arikado:''' "The power didn't "return." It was always with you. You just never had a need for it since you fled the castle. And that set free all the souls that you had gained dominance over." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; He informs Soma that Celia is the head of a cult that seeks the resurrection of the dark lord.&lt;ref name="ArikadoCultGoal"&gt;'''Genya Arikado:''' "They want to resurrect the lord of darkness. Like some sought to do with Dracula." / '''Soma Cruz:''' "I guess they don't like the fact that I didn't become the 'lord of darkness'." / '''Genya Arikado:''' "Not only that, they intend to create a new lord by eliminating you." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; He leaves, instructing Soma not to pursue Celia.

Soma, however, uses information acquired from Hammer to locate the cult's base, a facsimile of Dracula's castle.&lt;ref name="FoundCultBase"&gt;'''Soma Cruz:''' "So, the cult's base is here. Hammer's info wasn't so iffy after all." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hammer arrives, and as he has left the military, agrees to help Soma by opening up a shop in the village outside the castle.&lt;ref name="HammerVendorAgain"&gt;'''Hammer:''' "Aw, man... Well, since I'm here, I'd better make the best of it. I guess I'm back in business, and you're my customer!" {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; After entering the castle, Soma encounters Yoko and Julius Belmont. As Julius leaves, Soma escorts Yoko to a safe location. During this time, she instructs him in the use of a Magic Seal, which is necessary to defeat certain monsters in the castle.&lt;ref name="MagicSealUse"&gt;'''Yoko Belnades:''' "The cult leader appears to create gates that draw the power of darkness. Monsters exposed to that power are said to be invincible." '''Soma Cruz:''' "So how am I supposed to destroy them?" / '''Yoko Belnades:''' "That's where this Magic Seal comes in." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Soma travels farther into the castle, he meets Celia, who is flanked by two men, Dmitrii Blinov and Dario Bossi. Celia explains their nature as the "dark lord's candidates", who can become the dark lord by destroying Soma.&lt;ref name="CeliaPlan" /&gt; He later encounters Dmitrii and is able to defeat him. Soma gains dominance over his soul, although he acquires no abilities.&lt;ref name="SomaAbsorbDmitrii"&gt;'''Soma Cruz:''' "Unh! What was that? Did I gain dominance over a human soul? No, I gained no power... But...what was that light?" {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Soma travels further, he comes upon Dario. Soma bests him, and Celia teleports Dario away from harm.

Soma meets Arikado, who is initially angered by Soma's presence, but accepts the situation. He gives Soma a letter and a talisman from Mina. Soma briefs Arikado on the current situation, and Arikado leaves to locate Dario. Soma comes upon Dario and Julius who is later defeated due to his inability to use the Magic Seals.&lt;ref name="JuliusNoSeal"&gt;'''Julius Belmont:''' "Watch it. He's tough. Especially for me, since I can't use Magic Seals." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dario retreats, instructing Soma to fight him in the castle's throne room. Soma does so, lambasting Dario for only desiring power, and promising to defeat him.&lt;ref name="SomaNoble"&gt;'''Soma Cruz:''' "Was there ever any doubt? Power is nothing if you don't know how to use it. I'll never lose to a fool dominated by his own power like you." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the battle begins, Soma uses one of his souls to transport himself into the mirror in the room, revealing Aguni, the flame demon sealed within Dario's soul. Soma defeats Aguni, leaving Dario powerless. As Dario flees, Celia arrives, and instructs Soma to come to the castle's center.

Upon arriving, Soma is forced to watch Celia kill Mina. Furious, he begins to succumb to his dark power.&lt;ref name="SomaEnraged"&gt;'''Soma Cruz:''' "If it means getting Mina's revenge, I'll do it. Make me the dark lord." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; The talisman that Mina gave Soma is able to slow the transformation, enabling Arikado to arrive in time to inform Soma that the "Mina" who Celia killed was a [[doppelgänger]].&lt;ref name="MinaDoppelganger"&gt;'''Genya Arikado:''' "That Mina is a fake!" / '''Celia Fortner:''' "Arikado!

Ah, but you haven't won just yet..." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; This aborts the transformation, but a soul leaves Soma and enters the doppelgänger, which takes on the appearance of Dmitrii. Dmitrii says that when Soma defeated him he allowed himself to be absorbed, wishing to use his powers to copy Soma's ability to dominate the souls of Dracula's minions. He then leaves with Celia to absorb the souls of many powerful demons and monsters in an attempt to increase his power.&lt;ref name="DmitriiPloy"&gt;'''Genya Arikado:''' "You copied the power of dominance from Soma?" / '''Dmitrii Blinov:''' "Ah, so you understand.

Dmitrii, using Celia as a sacrifice, seals Arikado's powers, and engages Soma. However, his soul is unable to bear the strain of controlling the demons he has absorbed, and they erupt out of him, combining into one gargantuan creature called Menace. Soma manages to defeat it, but the souls that composed the demon begin to fall under Soma's dominance. He becomes overwhelmed and rejects them, fleeing from the castle with Arikado. Soma is conflicted over the present situation. He believes that it was his responsibility to become the dark lord, and that the events of the game were the result of him not accepting this responsibility. Arikado convinces him that his fate is not fixed.&lt;ref name="SomaFate"&gt;'''Soma Cruz:''' "Then that means there will always be a need for a dark lord. All because I ducked out from becoming the next in line!" / '''Genya Arikado:''' "Don't misconstrue me! Perhaps there is a need for the dark lord...But there is no reason at all for you to become the dark lord." / '''Soma Cruz:''' "But if it weren't for me, none of this would have happened!" / '''Genya Arikado:''' "You're neither a god nor a demon. You're only human. You have no chance at ever achieving perfection. Or are you saying you want to be the dark lord?" / '''Soma Cruz:''' "No...Of course not." {{cite video game|title=Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow |developer=Konami |date=2005-10-04 |publisher=Konami Tokyo |platform=Nintendo DS }}&lt;/ref&gt; Soma then shares a tender moment with Mina, much to the amusement of his onlooking friends.

The production of ''Dawn of Sorrow'' was announced on January 6, 2005, as the first ''Castlevania'' game to be released for the [[Nintendo DS]].&lt;ref name="DoSAnnounce"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/castlevania/news.html?sid=6115833 |title=Konami's Renowned Castlevania Series to Make its Debut on Nintendo DS System |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=2005-01-06 |accessdate=2007-10-18 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525094655/http://www.gamespot.com/ds/action/castlevania/news.html?sid=6115833 |archivedate=2011-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Longtime ''Castlevania'' producer [[Koji Igarashi]] was in charge of the production.&lt;ref name="DoSAnnounce"/&gt; The choice to develop the game for the Nintendo DS instead of the [[Sony]] [[PlayStation Portable]] was due to ''Aria of Sorrow''{{'}}s success on [[Nintendo]]'s [[Game Boy Advance]], and Igarashi's observations of both consoles during the 2005 [[E3 Media and Business Summit]].&lt;ref name="IgarashiInterviewGameInformer2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200501/N05.0131.1731.49293.htm|title=Castlevania: The Koji Igarashi Interview|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|author=Berghammer, Billy|date=2005-01-31|accessdate=2007-10-27| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070228203954/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200501/N05.0131.1731.49293.htm| archivedate = February 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that it was a waste to use the storyline with [[Soma Cruz]] and the Tactical Soul system in only one game, contributing to his desire to make a sequel.&lt;ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200507/N05.0728.1537.09250.htm|title=Castlevania Mania: The Koji Igarashi Interview|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|author=Berghammer, Billy|date=2005-07-28|accessdate=2007-10-18| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070301095625/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200507/N05.0728.1537.09250.htm| archivedate = March 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original design team from ''Aria of Sorrow'', as well as personnel from [[Konami Computer Entertainment Tokyo|Konami Tokyo]], were involved in the production of ''Dawn of Sorrow''.&lt;ref name="IgarashiInterview"/&gt; Igarashi intended to include a [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] Japanese worker in the game. This worker would be a manager in a Japanese firm and have a family. However, the development team's opposition to this idea forced him to drop it.&lt;ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview"/&gt;

The use of the technical features of the Nintendo DS was one of the production team's principal concerns during development.&lt;ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview"/&gt; The DS touch screen was a primary point of interest. Several functions such as picking up items on the screen and moving them were originally intended to be incorporated into the game.&lt;ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview"/&gt; However, scheduling problems forced the development team to abandon many of these ideas.&lt;ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview"/&gt; Igarashi's primary concern with using the touch screen was that it would detract from "the ''Castlevania'' pure action gameplay", since the player would have to slow down play to use the stylus.&lt;ref name="ChatofRuinIgarashiInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200606/N06.0622.1901.28664.htm|title=Castlevania’s Koji Igarashi: Chat of Ruin|publisher=[[Game Informer]]|author=Vore, Bryan|date=2006-06-22|accessdate=2007-10-18| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071013123406/http://gameinformer.com/News/Story/200606/N06.0622.1901.28664.htm| archivedate = October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nintendo DS#Input and output|DS microphone]] was looked at during development, but Igarashi noted that although he found humorous uses for it, it was never seriously considered for inclusion in the game.&lt;ref name="CastlevaniaManiaIgarashiInterview"/&gt;

For the graphical representations of the game's enemies, Igarashi had sprites from earlier ''Castlevania'' games such as ''[[Castlevania: Symphony of the Night]]'' reused, and the development team redesigned them for use on the Nintendo DS.&lt;ref name="IgarashiInterview"/&gt; Unlike most recent ''Castlevania'' games, [[Ayami Kojima]] did not participate in designing the characters for ''Dawn of Sorrow''.&lt;ref name="IgarashiInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StrategyInterview"&gt;{{cite book| title = Castlevania: Dawn of Sorrow Official Strategy Guide| publisher = DoubleJump Publishing| year = 2005| first1 = Alicia| last1 = Ashby| first2 = Thomas| last2 = Wilde| page = 249| chapter = Fan Interview| isbn = 0-9741700-7-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the characters were drawn in a distinctive [[anime]] style, influenced by producer [[Koji Igarashi]] who wanted to market the game to a younger audience.&lt;ref name="IgarashiInterview"/&gt; ''Aria of Sorrow''{{'}}s sales figures did not meet expectations, and as a result, Igarashi consulted Konami's sales department. The staff concluded that the demographics of the Game Boy Advance did not line up with the series' target age group.&lt;ref name="StrategyInterview"/&gt; Igarashi believed that the Nintendo DS inherently attracted a younger audience, and he was working to court them with the anime style.&lt;ref name="StrategyInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GamasutraInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20050815/sheffield_01.shtml |title=Gamasutra – Interview – "Whip Smart: Konami's Koji Igarashi On Mastering Castlevania" |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |author=Sheffield, Brandon |date=2005-08-15 |accessdate=2007-10-19 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103010246/http://www.gamasutra.com/features/20050815/sheffield_01.shtml |archivedate=2007-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Igarashi considered the anime style a litmus test for whether future ''Castlevania'' games would incorporate it.&lt;ref name="IgarashiInterview1UP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&amp;cId=3138794|title=A new art style for Castlevania|author=Payton, Ryan|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|date=2005-11-03|accessdate=2007-06-04|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927201503/http://www.1up.com/do/feature?pager.offset=3&amp;cId=3138794|archivedate=2007-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kojima's hiatus from ''Dawn of Sorrow'' allowed her to concentrate upon her character designs for ''[[Castlevania: Curse of Darkness]]''.&lt;ref name="IgarashiInterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="StrategyInterview"/&gt;

''Dawn of Sorrow'' has received critical acclaim from many [[video game journalism|video game publications]], with several hailing it as the best Nintendo DS game of 2005. 

Japanese gaming publication ''[[Famitsu]]'' gave it a 33 out of 40 score.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.famitsu.com/cominy/?m=pc&amp;a=page_h_title&amp;title_id=4503|title=悪魔城ドラキュラ 〜蒼月の十字架〜 [DS] / ファミ通.com|website=www.famitsu.com|access-date=2018-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many reviewers noted that despite being highly similar to ''Aria of Sorrow'', it managed to define itself as a standalone title. ''[[GameSpot]]'' commented that ''Dawn of Sorrow'' succeeded in continuing 2D games as a definite genre, and that it "keeps that flame burning as bright as ever".&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; ''GameSpot'' also considered it for the accolade of best Nintendo DS game of 2005, with the prize ultimately going to ''[[Mario Kart DS]]''.&lt;ref name="GameSpotBestDS2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/pages/features/bestof2005/index.php?day=5&amp;page=2 |title=GameSpot's Best of 2005 – Platform Awards |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |accessdate=2007-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930220941/http://www.gamespot.com/pages/features/bestof2005/index.php?day=5&amp;page=2 |archivedate=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Editors at [[IGN]] awarded ''Dawn of Sorrow'' the prize of best adventure game on the DS for 2005.&lt;ref name="IGNBestDSAdventure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bestof.ign.com/2005/ds/2.html |title=IGN.com presents The Best of 2005 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=2007-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205205547/http://bestof.ign.com/2005/ds/2.html |archivedate=February 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gameplay, and the Tactical Soul system in particular, received praise from reviewers. The sheer depth of the abilities of the numerous souls found in the game was lauded, and IGN believed that the ability to have two customizable "profiles" of different abilities was "an extremely handy idea".&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;  The relative difficulty of the game and its length was also brought into question, with ''GameSpot'' noting that the game could be finished in five hours and "is fairly easy as far as ''Castlevania'' games go".&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt;

''GameSpot'' extolled the game's animation and graphics, describing the backgrounds as "intricate and gorgeous" and the individual animation, especially of enemies, as one of the game's "highlights".&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; IGN echoed this assessment, calling the animation "stunning and fluid", and noted the differences in graphics between ''Aria of Sorrow'' and ''Dawn of Sorrow'', stating that the latter was on a "broader and more impressive scale".&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt; Reviewers lambasted the use of an anime style of drawing the characters, as opposed to the traditional [[Gothic art|gothic]] presentation of illustrator [[Ayami Kojima]] in earlier ''Castlevania'' games. [[GameSpy]] deplored the "shallow, lifeless anime images" used for the characters and Kojima's absence from the production.&lt;ref name="GameSpyReview"/&gt; IGN believed the new images were "down to the level of 'generic Saturday morning Anime' quality".&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt; The audio by Michiru Yamane and Masahiko Kimura was highly regarded, with GameSpot stating that it was "head and shoulders above [''Aria of Sorrow'']".&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; IGN noted that the DS dual speaker system presented the audio "extraordinarily well".&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt; In the review from [[1UP.com]], the game's score was compared to the soundtrack of ''Symphony of the Night'', with "excellent" sound quality and "exceptional" compositions.&lt;ref name="1UPReview"/&gt;

The functionality associated with the Nintendo DS, namely the touch screen and the Magic Seal system, was subject to criticism from reviewers. GameSpot noted that it was difficult to use the stylus immediately after the game prompted the player to draw the Magic Seal, thus forcing the player to use their fingernail on the touch screen.&lt;ref name="GameSpotReview"/&gt; Other functions using the touch screen, including clearing ice blocks, were viewed as trivial, with GameSpy calling it a "gimmick".&lt;ref name="GameSpyReview"/&gt; However, IGN dismissed the lack of DS functionality as a major issue, claiming that it "doesn't hurt the product in the slightest".&lt;ref name="IGNReview"/&gt;

In 2010, the game was included as one of the titles in the book ''[[Quintessence Editions Ltd.|1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die|last=Mott |first=Tony |authorlink= |year=2010 |publisher=[[Quintessence Editions Ltd.]]|location=London |isbn=978-1-74173-076-0 |page=600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cleavage''' is the exposed area between a woman’s [[breasts]] lying over the [[Human sternum|sternum]], and refers ''only'' to what is visible with clothing (or dense, nontransparent [[body art]]) that includes a low-cut [[neckline]].&lt;ref&gt;Kenny, Erin ; Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter. [https://books.google.com/books?id=VAUmDwAAQBAJ Beauty around the World: A Cultural Encyclopedia]. Santa Barbara, CA: [[ABC-CLIO]], 2017, p. 81, {{ISBN|978-1-61069-944-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, display of cleavage is considered aesthetic or erotic, and may be associated with garments with low necklines that expose or highlight cleavage, such as [[ball gown]]s, [[evening gown]]s, lingerie, and [[swimwear]]. In these cultures women have, throughout history, sought to enhance their [[physical attractiveness]] and femininity, within the context of changing fashions and cultural-specific [[Norm (social)|norms]] of [[modesty]] of the time and place. The methods practised in appropriate contexts have included the accentuation and partial display of breasts, including cleavage. In some cultures any display of cleavage may be culturally [[taboo]] (e.g. ''juyub'' in Islam,) illegal or otherwise socially disapproved.

The [[Anatomical terminology|anatomical term]] for the area that constitutes a cleavage is [[intermammary cleft]], intermammary sulcus or sulcus intermammarius.

[[Décolletage]] is the upper part of a woman's torso, between her waist and neck, comprising her neck, shoulders, back and chest, that is exposed by the neckline of her clothing. However, the term is most commonly applied to a neckline that reveals or emphasizes cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Barnhart|editor1-first=Robert K.|title=Barnhart Concise Dictionary of Etymology|year=1994|publisher=HarperCollins|location=New York|isbn=978-0-06-270084-1|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the side of the breasts are uncovered, it is known as "side cleavage", "sidewinders" or "sideboob".&lt;ref name="Dun"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunlap|first1=Elizabeth|title=The glossary: can't pronounce the ingredient, the makeup artist's name, or even the product?

Gabriele Hackworthy, fashion director at ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'', said, "The look is unlikely to fade fast, with [[Yves Saint Laurent (brand)|Yves Saint Laurent]] and [[Roberto Cavalli]] both pushing the silhouette next season."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Imogen|first1=Fox|title=The side cleavage: a new trend is born|url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/shortcuts/2012/may/29/side-cleavage-new-trend-born|newspaper=The Guardian|date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Staff writer|title=Trend Watch: The Side Cleavage|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-style/news/trend-watch-the-side-cleavage-2011276|website=Us Weekly|date=June 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the lower part of the breasts is uncovered, it is called "underboob".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/mar/16/thailand-warns-underboob-trend-breaks-computer-laws|title=Thailand warns women who post 'underboob' photos face five years in jail|last=Reuters|date=2015-03-16|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-03-09|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-style/news/kylie-jenner-works-underboob-in-skintight-jumpsuit-photos-w208727|title=Kylie Jenner's Underboob Is Out of Control in This Jumpsuit|work=Us Weekly|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==

=== Western culture ===
{{See also|Dress code|Breast fetishism}}

Many people in [[Western culture]], both male and female, consider breasts an important female [[secondary sex characteristic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html |title=Secondary Characteristics |work=hu-berlin.de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927075821/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/ATLAS_EN/html/secondary_characteristics.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an important aspect of femininity. [[Décolletage]] that exposes cleavage is used by many women to enhance their [[physical attractiveness|physical]] and [[sexual attractiveness]] and to improve their sense of femininity. Display of cleavage with a low neckline is often regarded as a form of feminine [[flirting]] or [[seduction]], as much as for its aesthetic or erotic effect. Most men derive [[erotic pleasure]] from seeing a woman's cleavage,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey, Alfred C.]] et al. ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]''.  Saunders, 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; and some people derive pleasure in their female partner exposing cleavage. When cleavage is enhanced with a push-up bra or exposed by a low neckline it can draw attention.&lt;ref name="scoop"&gt;Dr. Ted Eisenberg and Joyce K. Eisenberg, '' The Scoop on Breasts: A Plastic Surgeon Busts the Myths'', Incompra Press, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-9857249-3-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During adolescence, some girls become fixated on breast shape and cleavage.&lt;ref name="Ashlea"&gt;Ashlea Worrel, ''An Examination of Women's Body Image and Sexual Satisfaction'', page 15, ProQuest, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-549-65144-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of tight clothing and the display of cleavage have been attributed as causes of an increase in [[breast fetishism]], and atypical [[paraphilia]].&lt;ref name="ggf2003"&gt;{{harvnb|Glazier|Flowerday|2003|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western and some other societies, there are differences of opinion as to how much cleavage exposure is acceptable in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Salmansohn |first=Karen |title=The Power of Cleavage |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/karen-salmansohn/the_power_of_cleavage_b_70260.html  |publisher=The Huffington Post |date=October 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary Western society, the extent to which a woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context. Displaying cleavage or any part of female breast may be considered inappropriate or even prohibited by [[dress code]]s in some settings, such as workplaces, churches, and schools, while in some spaces showing as much cleavage as possible can be permissible or even encouraged. The exposure of [[nipple]]s or [[areolae]] is almost always considered immodest and in some instances is viewed as [[lewd]] or [[indecent exposure|indecent]] behavior.&lt;ref&gt;D. Leder, ''The Body in Medical Thought and Practice'', page 223, Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 1992, {{ISBN|978-0-7923-1657-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian [[James Laver]] argued that the changing standards of revealing cleavage is more prominent in evening wear than in day wear in the Western world.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Michael ''Fashion classics from Carlyle to Barthes'', page 732, Berg Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-606-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modesty considerations ===
{{See also|Modesty}}

There is historical evidence that some cultures strongly discouraged cleavage or any hint of a bosom.&lt;ref name="harari"&gt;Herbert Harari and Robert Malcolm Kaplan, ''Social Psychology: Basic and Applied'', page 271, Brooks/Cole Publishing Company, 1982, {{ISBN|978-0-8185-0481-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[History of the Puritans under James I|Early English Puritans]] used a tight bodice to flatten breasts completely, while 17th century [[Spaniard]]s put lead plates across the chests of young girls to prevent their bosoms from developing.&lt;ref name="harari" /&gt;

In the [[Quran]], the holy book of [[Islam]], it is stated, "Let them draw their [[Khimar]] (shawl/head veil) over their ''juyub'' (breast-line/cleavage)".&lt;ref&gt;[[An-Nur]]:&lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/024-qmt.php Ayat 31] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818132125/http://www.usc.edu/org/cmje/religious-texts/quran/verses/024-qmt.php |date=2016-08-18 }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The ''ayat'' refers to the women's clothes worn, parted in the front to expose the breasts, at the time when it was cited.&lt;ref&gt;L.S.

=== Theories ===
{{See also|Evolutionary psychology}}

The cleavage area between the breasts is perhaps the epicentre and stimulation of interest{{Clarify|reason=interest in what?|date=November 2018}}. Breast and [[buttock cleavage]]s, sharing a similarity between their appearances, are considered sexual in some cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Asa Berger, ''Media and Society: A Critical Perspective'', page 194, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4422-1780-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; British [[zoologist]] and [[ethologist]] [[Desmond Morris]] theorizes that cleavage is a sexual signal that imitates the image of the cleft between the buttocks.&lt;ref&gt;Morris (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; Swelling of the anterior is a sign of mating-readiness in ape species. Among humans the female genitalia is regressed and the upright posture reduces visibility of the buttocks, but the breasts are significantly enlarged. Theorists{{Who|date=November 2018}} hypothesize that with these evolutionary changes, the measure of mating-readiness and attractiveness in females has shifted from swagging buttocks to the pendulous shape of breasts and cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Curtis, ''Steal This Book Too!'', page 287, Authorhouse, May 2004, {{ISBN|978-1-4184-1875-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Evolutionary psychology|Evolutionary psychologists]] theorize that humans' permanently enlarged breasts, in contrast to other primates' breasts, which only enlarge during [[ovulation]], allowed females to "solicit male attention and investment even when they are not really fertile",&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Charles B. and Krebs, Dennis (eds.) "How Mate Choice Shaped Human Nature", ''Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology: Ideas, Issues, and Applications'', Lawrence Erlbaum Associates (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; though Morris notes that in recent years there has been a trend toward reversing breast augmentations.&lt;ref&gt;Morris (1997) pp. 236,240&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris (2004), pp. 156-159&lt;/ref&gt; According to social historian David Kunzle, waist confinement and décolletage are the primary [[sexualization]] devices of Western costume.&lt;ref&gt;Craik, Jennifer. ''The Face of Fashion'', page 122, Routledge, 1993, {{ISBN|0-203-40942-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the 21st century, some of the attention given to cleavage and breasts started to shift to buttocks, especially in the media.&lt;ref&gt;Boye De Mente, ''The Origins of Human Violence'', page 61, Cultural-Insight Books, 2010, {{ISBN|978-1-4528-5846-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antiquity ===
In 2600 BCE, princess [[Nofret]] of the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt]] was depicted in a V-neck gown with a plunging neckline that exposed ample cleavage. In 1600 BCE, [[Snake Goddess]] figurines were sculpted in [[Minos]] with open dress-fronts, revealing entire breasts.&lt;ref name=olson&gt;James S. Olson, ''Bathsheba's Breast: Women, Cancer, and History'', page 324, JHU Press, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-8064-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient Greek goddess [[Hera]] wore an early version of a push-up bra, described in the ''[[Iliad]]'' as festooned with "brooches of gold" and "a hundred tassels", to increase her cleavage to divert [[Zeus]] from the [[Trojan War]].&lt;ref name=divide&gt;Daphne Merkin, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/style/tmagazine/TW1792179.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0 The Great Divide]", ''New York Times'', August 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Décolletage was often a feature of the dress of the late Middle Ages. This continued through the [[Victorian period]]. Gowns that exposed a woman's neck and top of her chest were very common and uncontroversial in Europe from at least the 11th century until the Victorian period in the 19th century. Ball or evening gowns especially featured low square décolletage designed to display and emphasize cleavage.&lt;ref name="Gernsheimpp"&gt;Gernsheim, Alison. ''Victorian and Edwardian Fashion.

In the 14th century, necklines were lowered, clothes were tightened and breasts were once again flaunted. In 1450, [[Agnès Sorel]], mistress to [[Charles VII of France]], is credited with starting a fashion when she wore deep low square décolleté gowns with [[toplessness|fully bared breasts]] in the French court.&lt;ref name="histoire_mode"&gt;Monique Canellas-Zimmer, ''Histoires de mode'', Les Dossiers d'Aquitaine – 2005, {{ISBN|9782846221191}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other aristocratic women of the time who were painted with breasts exposed included [[Simonetta Vespucci]], whose [[Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci (Piero di Cosimo)|portrait with exposed breasts]] was painted by [[Piero di Cosimo]] in c.1480.

In many European societies between the Renaissance and the 19th century, wearing low-cut dresses that exposed breasts was more acceptable than today; with a woman's bared legs, ankles, or shoulders being considered to be more risqué than exposed breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Cunnington, C.

During the 16th century, women's fashions with exposed breasts were common in society, from queens to common prostitutes, and emulated by all classes. [[Anne of Brittany]] has also been painted wearing a dress with a square neckline. Low square décolleté styles were popular in England in the 17th century and even [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]] and [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], wife of [[Charles I of England]], were depicted with fully bared breasts; and architect [[Inigo Jones]] designed a [[masque]] costume for Henrietta Maria that fully revealed both of her breasts.&lt;ref name="Nigel Llewellyn 1660" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsandevents.warwick.ac.uk/index.cfm?page=pressrelease&amp;id=1858 |title=Historian Reveals Janet Jackson's 'Accidental' Exposing of Her Breast was the Height of Fashion in the 1600s|date=5 May 2004|publisher=University of Warwick |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20040803155530/http://www.newsandevents.warwick.ac.uk/index.cfm?page=pressrelease&amp;id=1858 |archivedate = 3 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1795–1820 in fashion|fashions of the period 1795–1820]], many women wore dresses that bared necks, bosoms and shoulders. [[Anne of Austria]] was known for wearing, along with female members of her court, very tight [[bodice]] and [[corset]]s that forced breasts together to make deeper cleavages, very low necklines that exposed breasts visible almost in entirety above the [[areola]] and pendants lying on the cleavage to highlight it.&lt;ref name=olson /&gt;

=== Modern period ===
[[Image:Sargent MadameX.jpeg|thumb|This portrait by [[John Singer Sargent]] of [[Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau]] depicting her cleavage caused considerable controversy when it was displayed at the 1884 [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] art exhibition in Paris.]]

During the [[Victorian morality|Victorian]] period, social attitudes required women to cover their bosom in public. For ordinary wear, high collars were the norm. Towards the end of the Victorian period (end 19th century) the full collar was the fashion, though some décolleté dresses were worn on formal occasions (see [[1880s in fashion]]).

During the French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], there was a debate as to whether a woman's breasts were merely a sensual enticement or rather a natural gift to be offered from mother to child. In [[Alexandre Guillaume Mouslier de Moissy]]'s 1771 play ''The True Mother'' (''La Vraie Mère''), the title character rebukes her husband for treating her as merely an object for his sexual gratification: "Are your senses so gross as to look on these breasts – the respectable treasures of nature – as merely an embellishment, destined to ornament the chest of women?"&lt;ref&gt;[[Schama, Simon]]. ''[[Citizens: A Chronicle of the French Revolution]]'', p. 147. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1989. {{ISBN|0-394-55948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly a century later, also in France, a man from the provinces who attended a Court ball at the [[Tuileries]] in [[Paris]] in 1855 was deeply shocked by the décolleté dresses and is said to have exclaimed in disgust: "I haven't seen anything like that since I was weaned!"&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1884 ''[[Portrait of Madame X]]'', a portrait painting by [[John Singer Sargent]] of American-born Paris socialite, [[Virginie Amélie Avegno Gautreau]], was criticized&lt;ref name="Elaine Kilmurray 1998, p. 114"&gt;Richard Ormand and Elaine Kilmurray, ''Sargent: The Early Portraits'', New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998, p. 114, {{ISBN|0-300-07245-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; for depicting her in a sleek black dress displaying what was considered scandalous cleavage and her right shoulder strap fallen off her shoulder. The controversy was so great that he reworked the painting to move the shoulder strap from her upper arm to her shoulder, and Sargent left Paris for London in 1884.&lt;ref name="Fairbrother 2001 139, Note 4"&gt;{{cite book |last=Fairbrother |first=Trevor |title=John Singer Sargent: The Sensualist |year=2001 |isbn= 978-0-300-08744-4 |page=139, Note 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitiesweb.org/human.php?s=g&amp;p=a&amp;a=i&amp;ID=424 "Sargent's Portraits"], an article including a mention of the scandal caused by the portrayal of cleavage in [[John Singer Sargent]]'s "[[Portrait of Madame X]]".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1908, a single pad made of rubber or a "bust form" was advertised that was to be worn inside the front of the bodice to make cleavage virtually undetectable.&lt;ref&gt;Sherrie A. Inness, ''Delinquents and Debutantes: Twentieth-century American Girls' Cultures'', page 117, New York University Press, 1998, {{ISBN|978-0-8147-3765-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clergymen all over the world became shocked when dresses to be worn with modest round or V-shaped necklines became fashionable around 1913. In the [[German Empire]], for example, all [[Roman Catholic]] bishops joined in issuing a pastoral letter attacking the new fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Gernsheim, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Fashions became more restrained in terms of décolletage, while exposure of the leg became more accepted in Western societies during [[World War I]] and remained so for nearly half a century.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Kim K. P.; Torntore, Susan J. and Eicher, Joanne Bubolz. ''Fashion foundations'', p. 716, Berg Publishers, 2003, {{ISBN|1-85973-619-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th century===
In 1953, Hollywood film ''[[The French Line]]'' was found objectionable under the [[Hays Code]] because of [[Jane Russell]]'s "breast shots in bathtub, cleavage and breast exposure" while some of her décollete gowns were thought "...intentionally designed to give a bosom peep-show effect beyond even extreme decolletage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doherty|first=Thomas|title=Hollywood's Censor: Joseph I. Breen and the Production Code Administration|year=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-231-14358-5|edition=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But other actresses defied the then standards. For example, [[Gina Lollobrigida]] raised eyebrows with her famous low-cut dress in 1960, and other celebrities, performers and models followed suit, and the public was not far behind. Low-cut styles of various depths are now common in many situations. During the 1950s, Hollywood and the fashion industry successfully promoted large cloven bustlines (and [[falsies]]). In the late 1960s, erogenous attention began to shift from the large bust to the trim lower torso, reasserting the need to diet, especially as new clothing fashions — brief, sheer, and close fitting — prohibited heavy reliance on foundation lingerie. Legs were relatively less emphasized as elements of beauty.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Mazur, "U.S. trends in feminine beauty and overadaptation", ''Journal of Sex Research'', pp. 281-303, Volume 22, Issue 3, 1986, The Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality, Pennsylvania, USA. DOI: 10.1080/00224498609551309&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1960s onward, however, changes in fashions were towards increasing displays of cleavage in films and television, with Jane Russell and [[Elizabeth Taylor]] being the biggest stars who led the fashion,&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Baker, ''Fashions of a Decade'', page 51, Infobase Publishing, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-4381-1891-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in everyday life low-cut dress styles became very common, even for casual wear.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Koestenbaum, ''Cleavage: essays on sex, stars, and aesthetics'', page 125, Ballantine Books, 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-345-43460-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wonderbra was created in 1964 by Louise Poirier for Canadelle, a Canadian lingerie company. It had 54 design elements that lift and support the bustline while creating a deep plunge and push-together effect.

The ideal of breasts and cleavage has also evolved in the later half of the 20th century, with shapes enhanced by use of a variety of [[#Cleavage enhancement|methods and techniques]]. In the 1950s the preferred shape was pointy, echoing the [[Science fiction|sci-fi]] look of the times; in the 1960s it was elegantly sloped in alignment with [[Hippie chic]] of the times; and from the 1990s a buffed, pumped and engorged look has become the preference.&lt;ref&gt;A.A. Gill, ''To America with Love'', page 113, Simon and Schuster, 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-4165-9621-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 21st century===
[[File:Zoë Bell 07.jpg|thumb|upright|Actress [[Zoë Bell]] in a low-cut dress at a film premiere in USA, 2006]]

21st century women's fashions, especially at formal occasions, has increasingly included low-cut dress designs which expose cleavage. Such dress designs have been most noticeable at various awards presentations, such as those seen at the 2016 [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/celebrity-style/red-carpet/it-was-all-about-cleavage-on-the-oscars-red-carpet-this-year/news-story/3e8b2386e2b8a2474f07963b25f589f5 |title=It was all about cleavage on the Oscars red carpet this year |publisher=News.com.au |date=2016-03-01 |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams |first=Zoe |url=http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/news/features/2016/02/cleavage-controversy-at-the-sag-awards |title=Susan Sarandon and Sarah Silverman's cleavage cause controversy at the SAG awards |work=Glamour |location=UK |date=2016-02-06 |accessdate=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such low-cut dresses still attract comment, though less controversy. It was also noticeable in the 2013 film ''[[American Hustle]]'', as well as in films which expose cleavage in a low-cut bra or swimsuit.

Display of cleavage can still be controversial. In the United States, in two separate incidents in 2007, [[Southwest Airlines]] crews asked travelers to modify their clothing, to wear sweaters or to leave the airplane because the crew did not consider the amount of cleavage displayed acceptable.&lt;ref name="Woman told she was too Hot to Fly"&gt;NBC News.

{{Main|Cleavage enhancement}}
Various methods have been used by women in history to enhance their [[physical attractiveness]] and femininity including the accentuation and display of breasts within the context of fashions and norms of modesty of the time and place.

[[Corset]]s that enhanced cleavage were introduced in the mid-16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Condra, Jill. ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Clothing Through World History,'' page 152, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2008, {{ISBN|0-313-33664-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 18th century, cleavage-enhancing corsets grew more dramatic in pushing the breasts upward.&lt;ref&gt;Spooner, Catherine. ''Fashioning Gothic Bodies,'' page 28, Manchester University Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-7190-6401-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tight lacing of corsets worn in the 19th and early 20th centuries emphasized both cleavage and the size of the bust and hips. Especially evening or ball gowns were designed to display and emphasize the décolletage.&lt;ref name="Gernsheimpp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesmondMorris"/&gt;

When corsets became unfashionable, [[brassiere]]s and padding helped to project, display and emphasize the breasts. In 1893, New Yorker Marie Tucek was granted a patent for a "breast supporter," described as a modification of the corset, and was very similar to a modern [[push-up bra]] designed to support the breasts. It consisted of a plate made of metal, cardboard or other stiff material shaped to fit against the torso under the breasts, following the contour of the breasts.

According to Hughes, the resultant amount was "the length of the actual cleavage is five and one-quarter inches."&lt;ref name=divide /&gt; Several brassiere manufacturers, among them [[Wonderbra]] and [[Victoria's Secret]], produce push-up and other types of bras that enhance cleavage. [[Frederick's of Hollywood]] introduced a design called Hollywood Extreme Cleavage Bra that helped give the impression of a spherical cleavage like augmented breasts that was popularized by stars like [[Pamela Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;Jene Luciani, ''The Bra Book'', pp=103, 140, BenBella Books Inc., 2013, {{ISBN|978-1-935251-92-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taping ===
Many women, such as beauty pageant participants and [[transgender]] people, create cleavage by using tape underneath and across their breast, bending forward, tightly pulling them together and up.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Banet-Weiser, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=BsZHUu3gmV0C&amp;pg=PA24&amp;dq=breast+cleavage+taping&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9Ys9VLOkI4KVuASCvICYAQ&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=breast%20cleavage%20taping&amp;f=false The Most Beautiful Girl in the World: Beauty Pageants and National Identity],'' page 73, University of California Press, (1999) {{ISBN|978-0-520-21789-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=apaige&gt;Andy Paige, ''Style on a Shoestring,'' page 24, McGraw Hill Professional, 2009, {{ISBN|978-0-07-159506-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;IV2"&gt;JoAnn Roberts, ''Art and Illusion: A Guide to Crossdressing'' (Vol. 2), Creative Design Services, 1994, {{ISBN|1-880715-08-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Types of tape used include surgical micropore tape and athletic tape. Some also use a strip of [[moleskin]] under the breasts with tape at the ends to hold it in place. Use of the wrong techniques or tape with too strong an adhesive can cause injuries such as rashes, blisters and skin being torn off.&lt;ref name=apaige /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;IV2" /&gt;

=== Surgery ===
{{Main|Breast augmentation}}

Bigger breasts are easier to push together to accent the hollow between them.&lt;ref name="scoop"/&gt; Some flat-chested women feel self-conscious about their small breasts and want to improve their sexual attractiveness by seeking [[breast augmentation]].&lt;ref name=brett&gt;{{cite news|last=Brett|first=Samantha|title=The Great Cleavage Conundrum: should men look if it's on display?|url=http://www.northernargus.com.au/blogs/national-comment/the-great-cleavage-conundrum-should-men-look-if-its-on-display/2459026.aspx?storypage=0|accessdate=17 February 2012|newspaper=Northern Argus|date=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plastic surgeon Gerard H. Pitman says, "you can't have cleavage with an A cup. You have to be at least a B or a C."&lt;ref name=divide /&gt; A similar statement was made for non-surgical cleavage enhancement as well (i.e. lingerie manufacturers [[Frederick's of Hollywood]] promises "high-rise cleavage to small busts" and Curvees in Etam claims to give girls with a B cup an "exciting C cup cleavage").&lt;ref name=anxiety&gt;Kristina Roberts Ellis, ''Bodies of Thought, Sites of Anxiety'', pages 82-83, ProQuest, 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-549-98382-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breast surgery for emplacing [[breast implant]]s can be done for three purposes:

# primary reconstruction to replace breast tissues damaged by [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] ([[blunt trauma|blunt]], [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]], [[blast injury|blast]]), disease (breast cancer) and failed anatomic development ([[tuberous breast]] deformity).
# revision and reconstruction to revise (correct) the outcome of a previous breast reconstruction surgery.
# primary augmentation to aesthetically augment the size, form and feel of the [[breast]]s.

For [[breast reconstruction]] and for the augmentation and enhancement of the aesthetics — size, shape, and texture — of a woman's breasts, there are two types of breast implant devices in practice: saline implants filled with sterile [[saline (medicine)|saline solution]] and silicone implants filled with viscous [[silicone]] gel.

If a surgeon attempts to create or increase cleavage by loosening the medial borders of the breasts, it could result in [[symmastia]], a confluence of the breast tissue of both breasts across the midline anterior to the [[Human sternum|sternum]], creating a lack of defined cleavage.&lt;ref&gt;Iliana E. Sweis, ''Outsmarting Mother Nature,'' page 163, ABC-CLIO, 2010, {{ISBN|978-0-313-38614-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Procedures are generally followed during [[breast reconstruction]] to preserve a natural cleavage of breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Jay R. Harris, Marc E. Lippman, C. Kent Osborne and Monica Morrow, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=GLc8xYe239kC&amp;pg=PT1448&amp;lpg=PT1448&amp;dq=intermammary+succulus+pathology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zb2PvcRnK1&amp;sig=AkGgy-yKvAl3pgJSsUB4nENhuXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iLhVVKfFA8TguQT7s4CYAg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Diseases of the Breast],'' Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2012, {{ISBN|978-1-4511-4870-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise ===
Regular exercise of the muscles and fibres of the pectoral complex, which lies just under the fatty tissues of the breast, helps prevent droopiness and can create the illusion of larger and firmer breasts and an enhanced cleavage.&lt;ref name=bmars&gt;Brigitte Mars, ''Beauty by Nature'', page 136, Book Publishing Company, 2006, {{ISBN|978-1-57067-193-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Lydon, ''Look Hot, Live Long'', page 198, Basic Health Publications, Inc., 2003, {{ISBN|978-1-59120-024-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joyce L.

=== Make up ===
Making cleavage appear deeper and the breasts look fuller alongside the cleavage with makeup is achieved using [[shading]] effects. The middle of the cleavage is made to look deeper by using a darker makeup colour than the base colour of the skin, while the most prominent areas of the breasts (either side of the cleavage) are made to look larger or more protruding by the use of a paler colour.&lt;ref&gt;''Art and Illusion: A Guide to Crossdressing'' Third Edition, Vol. 2 – Fashion &amp; Style", JoAnn Roberts, Creative Design Services, 1994, {{ISBN|1-880715-08-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Making Faces", Kevyn Aucoin, Prion Books Limited, 1997, {{ISBN|1-85375-355-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korea has an ancient history of cosmetics use, and today it is an important industry in South Korea.

== History ==
[[File:Cosmetic box, stoneware with celadon glaze, Goryeo Dynasty.jpg|thumb|Goryeo Dynasty cosmetic box]]

===Ancient times===
Records of the use of cosmetics in Korea date back to the time of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]], and the use of makeup flourished during the [[Goryeo kingdom]].{{cn|date=July 2017}} Cosmetics were made from lotions extracted from plants, including gourd stems; [[Mung bean|Ground mung bean]] contains [[saponin]] and was helpful for cleansing. [[Castor oil]]s and [[camellia oil]]s were used as hair oil. They had a pleasant smell and were not sticky. To moisturise and add gloss to the skin, safflower oil was used. [[Apricot]] and [[peach]] oils were used to remove freckles and liver spots. A powder called 'mibun' or 'baekbun' was made from ground rice and [[millet]] blended with water or oil.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/culture/2013/01/135_129776.html|title=Tracing history of cosmetics|website=the koreatimes|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scents were added to extracts from grains and other plants, for example from dried clove buds. Perfume was also used to relieve stresses and tiredness. The ''[[Gyuhap Chongseo]]'', an ancient women's encyclopedia, includes various methods for making perfume.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to ''Gyuhap Chongseo'', eyebrows were the central feature of a woman's face.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The work describes ten popular eyebrow shapes. Crescent or willow leaf shapes were most popular. Plant ash was the basic raw material used for eyebrow ink, with which women drew their eyebrows in various shapes. The primary colors were black, blue, and dark brown.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Yeonji'' is the Korean name of rouge, which was used to colour the lips and cheeks. It could be made from [[safflower]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the [[Joseon period]], luxurious makeup was forbidden because of Confucianism. Upper-class women tended to copy the makeup and style of [[gisaeng]] during this period.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Modern times===

Following the [[Kanghwa Treaty|Treaty of Kanghwa]] in 1876, Korean ports opened to foreign trade and Western styles began to influence the country. New makeup styles and products became popular, stimulating Korea's cosmetics culture and enabling mass production and consumption.

''Bakgabun'', which means Park's powder, was the first mass-produced cosmetics item in Korea. It was the first Korean face powder and was a bestseller from 1916 to 1930. However, because of its lead content, sales then fell rapidly and similar products were quickly launched.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As a result of the dominance of Japanese cosmetic brands, Korean cosmetics failed to develop in the 1920s. After the country was no longer under Japanese control, the [[Korean War]] that began in 1950 further disrupted the economy. Finally, around 1961, the Korean cosmetics industry began to prosper after the passage of a law banning sales of other countries' products.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Cosmetics and skincare in Korean culture==
Korean people focus on skin care under the influence of TV programs, [[advertisements]] and tradition. Koreans highly value even, radiant skin,&lt;ref name="way"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lee|first1=Sue|title=The Korean way to pretty skin|url=http://www.guampdn.com/story/life/2015/10/05/korean-skin-care/73071930/|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Korean women tend to vary their beauty care regimen with the season. They use different kinds of [[moisturizer]]s such as cream for tightening pores ([[BB cream]], blemish balm or beauty balm) and lotions for lightening the skin ([[CC cream]], colour correction or colour control).&lt;ref name="way" /&gt;

Koreans generally apply makeup every day because it offers [[sunscreen|sun protection]], a major concern.&lt;ref name=routine&gt;{{cite news |first=Bridget |last=March |url=http://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/beauty-hair/beauty-trends/a42942/korean-skincare-routine-explained/ |title=The Korean skincare routine, explained |newspaper=UK Cosmospolitan |date=22 June 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bb"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shaw Brown|first1=Genevieve|title=Move Over BB Cream, Here Comes CC|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Travel/move-bb-cream-cc/story?id=18816958|website=abc news|accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A big focus of Korean skincare is skin lightening,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Eric P. H. |last1=Li |author2=Hyun Jeong Min |first3=Russell W. |last3=Belk |url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/v35/naacr_vol35_273.pdf |title=Skin Lightening and Beauty in Four Asian Cultures |journal=Advances in Consumer Research |volume=35 |year=2008 |pages=444–49 |publisher=Association for Consumer Research, University of Minnesota Duluth }}&lt;/ref&gt;  which is why many Korean cosmetic products have brightening properties. Skin brightening is not the same as skin bleaching, also known as [[Skin whitening|skin whitening]], which is a reduction of [[melanin]] in the skin. Instead, skin lightening is focused on treating [[Hyperpigmentation|hyperpigmentation]].

[[File:Innisfree store Myeong-dong.JPG|thumb|upright|Innisfree store, [[Myeong-dong]]]]
In order to achieve a perfectly even skin tone, Korean women go so far as to perform a daily 8 to 10-step skincare routine. Traditionally, these extensive routines include [[Cosmetics|makeup remover]], double cleansing (i.e. consecutive oil and water-based cleansing), [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|exfoliator]], [[Toner (skin care)|toner]], essence (lightweight hydrating concentrates), treatments (boosters, serums, ampoules), sheet masks (thin cotton sheets doused in a liquid-based formula that claims to moisturize, brighten, and even treat fine lines), eye cream, [[moisturizer]] and [[sunscreen]].&lt;ref name=routine/&gt;

Korean men are also interested in skincare. Some use BB or CC cream. Cosmetics manufactured specifically for men in South Korea focus on soothing the skin after daily shaving.&lt;ref name="men"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fujita |first1=Akiko |title=South Korean Men Cosmetics-Crazed |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/lifestyle/2013/05/south-korean-men-cosmetics-crazed/|website=ABC news |date=May 2013 |accessdate=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Korea is home to several large cosmetic brands, many of which export their products worldwide.&lt;ref name="amore"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chung|first1=Grace|title=How South Korea's AmorePacific Became One Of The World's Most Innovative Companies|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/gracechung/2015/08/19/how-south-koreas-amorepacific-became-one-of-the-worlds-most-innovative-companies/#f4109e689cfd|website=Forbes|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tony"&gt;{{cite web|title=Top cosmetics company Tony Moly goes global|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=3019027|website=Korea joongang Daily|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="in-cos"&gt;{{cite web|title=97% visitor increase makes in-cosmetics Korea a dazzling success|url=http://news.in-cosmetics.com/2016/10/97-visitor-increase-makes-in-cosmetics-korea-a-dazzling-success/|website=in-cosmetics|accessdate=15 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They include:

'''''Country Life''''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] weekly [[Perfect bound|perfect-bound]], glossy [[magazine]], based in [[London]] at 110 [[Southwark Street]] (until March 2016 when it became based in [[Farnborough, Hampshire]]), and owned by [[TI Media]].

At this time it was owned by [[Edward Hudson (magazine owner)|Edward Hudson]], the owner of [[Lindisfarne Castle]] and various [[Edwin Lutyens|Lutyens]]-designed houses including [[The Deanery]] in [[Sonning]].    

At that time [[golf]] and [[horse racing|racing]] served as its main content, as well as the property coverage, initially of manorial estates, which is still such a large part of the magazine.  [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], the late Queen Mother, used to appear frequently on its front cover. Now the magazine covers a range of subjects in depth, from gardens and gardening to country house architecture, fine art and books, and property to rural issues, luxury products and interiors.   

The [[Book frontispiece|frontispiece]] of each issue usually features a portrait photograph of a young woman of society, or, on occasion, a man of society.

In 2016, in its 119th year, Country Life was the subject of a three-part documentary series made by Spun Gold and which aired on BBC Two on consecutive Friday nights in March. The magazine has also celebrated its best-ever selling issue - the double issue from Christmas 2015 - and a 6th ABC increase in a row, which is an achievement no other weekly magazine publishing original content can claim.  

In 1997, the centenary of the magazine was celebrated by a special issue, the publishing of a book by Sir [[Roy Strong]], the airing of a BBC2 TV programme on a year in the life of the magazine, and staging a Gold Medal winning garden at the [[Chelsea Flower Show]]. In 1999, the magazine launched a new website.

In 2007, the magazine celebrated its 110th anniversary with a special souvenir issue on 4 January.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.countrylife.co.uk/magazine/issue/903 Country Life, 4 January 2007, issue cover] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928000627/http://www.countrylife.co.uk/magazine/issue/903 |date=28 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting on Wednesday 7 May 2008 the magazine is issued each Wednesday, having been on sale each Thursday for the past 111 years, with the earlier day being achieved using electronic publishing technology.

== Topics ==
The first several dozen pages of each issue are devoted to colour [[advertisements]] for upmarket residential property, which are one of the best-known attractions of the magazine, and popular with everyone from the super rich looking for a country house or estate to those who can only aspire to own such a property.

The magazine covers the pleasures and joys of [[rural]] life.  It is primarily concerned with rural communities and their environments as well as the concerns of country dwellers and [[landowner]]s and has a diverse readership which, although mainly UK based is also international.  Much of its success has historically been built on its coverage of [[country house]] architecture and gardening at a time when the architectural press largely ignored this building type. An extensive photographic archive has resulted, now of great importance to architectural historians.  

The other rural pursuits and interests covered include [[hunting]], [[shooting]], [[farming]], [[equestrianism|equestrian]] news and [[gardening]] and there are regular news and opinion pieces as well as a firm engagement with rural politics. There are reviews of [[book]]s, [[food]] and [[wine]], [[art]] and [[architecture]] (also many offers) and [[antique]]s and [[craft]]s.  Illustrative material includes the ''Tottering-by-Gently'' [[cartoon]] by [[Annie Tempest]].  The property section claims to have more prime agents than anywhere else. In addition. monthly luxury and interiors sections offer readers some informed ideas about the latest in jewellery, style and travel, and interiors. 

Recent feature articles have included [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] guest-editing an issue of ''Country Life'' in 2013, a historic revelation which revealed the true face of [[Shakespeare]] for the first time in 2015, and in 2016 an exclusive on where the [[Great Fire of London]] really began in 1666. There was a special commemorative issue in June 2016 on the occasion of the Queen's 90th birthday, and a Best of Britain celebrating the very best of what the [[United Kingdom]] has to offer, from craftsmen to landscapes.

== BBC Documentary ==
In March 2016, ''Country Life'' was featured in a three-part documentary series produced by  Spun Gold which aired on BBC2 called ''Land of Hope and Glory, British Country Life''. The films sought to show some elements of modern rural life which although feature often in ''Country Life'' magazine, are rarely seen in the mass media. 

Topics covered included the beauty of the countryside and the centuries and traditions of the people who live there as well as some of the challenges faced by those who live and work exclusively on the land, from property owners to farmers and those employed in country pursuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2086">The '''Croatian Heritage Foundation''' ({{lang-hr|Hrvatska matica isljenika}}) is an organization which works with [[Croatia]]n [[emigrants]]. It helps connect [[diaspora]] groups back to the country. The foundation organizes several programs within Croatia and around the world ranging from language to folklore. It publishes its own monthly magazine, ''Matica'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.matis.hr/index.php/en/activities/publishing/matica-monthly-magazine | title=Matica-monthly magazine | publisher=Croatian Heritage Foundation | work=matis.hr | accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the ''Croatian Emigrant Almanac'' ({{lang|hr|Hrvatski iseljenički zbornik}}), printed in Croatian, English and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.matis.hr/index.php/en/activities/publishing/croatian-emigrant-almanac | title=The Croatian Emigrant Almanac | publisher=Croatian Heritage Foundation | work=matis.hr | accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large part of the foundation's work deals with preventing the assimilation of diaspora Croats into other cultures. This is significant because of the relatively large population of Croats living outside of the country. The CHF runs branches in [[Pula]], [[Rijeka]], [[Zadar]], [[Split (city)|Split]], [[Dubrovnik]] and [[Vukovar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.matis.hr/index.php/en/about-us/constitution | title=Constitution | publisher=Croatian Heritage Foundation | work=matis.hr | accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Design theory''' is a subfield of [[design research]] concerned with various theoretical approaches towards understanding and delineating design principles, design knowledge, and design practice.

== History ==

Design theory has been approached and interpreted in many ways, from personal statements of design principles, through constructs of the [[philosophy of design]] to a search for a [[design science]].

The essay "Ornament and Crime" by [[Adolf Loos]] from 1908 is one of the early 'principles' design-theoretical texts. Others include Le Corbusier's ''Vers une architecture'',&lt;ref name="Corbusier 1923"&gt;Le Corbusier, ''Vers une architecture" (1923)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Papanek]]'s ''Design for the real world'' (1972).

In a 'principles' approach to design theory, the [[De Stijl]] movement promoted a geometrical abstract, "ascetic" form of purism that was limited to functionality. This modernist attitude underpinned the [[Bauhaus]] movement. Principles were drawn up for design that were applicable to all areas of modern aesthetics.

For an introduction to the philosophy of design see the article by Per Galle&lt;ref name="Galle Philosophy Intro"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Galle|first1=Per|title=Philosophy of Design|url=https://kadk.dk/cephad-centre-philosophy-design/philosophy-design-introduction|website=KADK|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Royal Danish Academy.

An example of early design science was Altshuller's ''Theory of inventive problem solving'', known as [[TRIZ]], from Russia in the 1940s. Herbert Simon's 1969 ''The sciences of the artificial'' began a more scientific basis to the study of design. &lt;ref name="simon1996"&gt;{{cite web|author=Simon|title='The Sciences of the Artificial|publisher=MIT Press|year=1996|isbn=0-262-69191-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the further development of fields such as [[design methods]], [[design research]], [[design science]] and [[design thinking]] has promoted a wider understanding of design theory.

'''Elfdalian''' or '''Övdalian''' (''{{lang|ovd|Övdalsk}}'' or ''{{lang|ovd|Övdalską}}'' in Elfdalian, ''{{lang|sv|Älvdalska}}'' or ''{{lang|sv|Älvdalsmål}}'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]]) is a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]] spoken by up to 3,000 people&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alvdalen.se/sv/Alvdalska/Vad-ar-Alvdalska/|title=Vad är Älvdalska?|last=Barke|first=Anders|date=|website=Älvdalens kommun|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=November 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; who live or have grown up in the parish of [[Älvdalen]] (''{{lang|ovd|Övdaln}}''), which is located in the southeastern part of [[Älvdalen Municipality]] in northern [[Dalarna]], [[Sweden]].

Like all other modern North Germanic languages, Elfdalian developed from [[Old Norse]], a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and inhabitants of their overseas settlements during the [[Viking Age]] until about 1300. It developed in relative isolation since the Middle Ages and is considered to have remained closer to Old Norse than the other [[Dalecarlian dialects]].

==Classification==
Elfdalian belongs to the Northern branch/Upper Siljan branch of the [[Dalecarlian dialects]] or vernaculars, which in their turn evolved from [[Old Norse]], from which Dalecarlian vernaculars might have split as early as in the eighth or ninth century,&lt;ref&gt;[[Lars Levander|Levander, Lars]], ''Dalmålet'', vol. 1, 1925, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., approximately when the [[North Germanic languages]] split into Western and Eastern branches. 
Elfdalian (and other [[Dalecarlian dialects|Dalecarlian language varieties]]) is traditionally placed among the [[East Scandinavian]] languages, together with [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Danish language|Danish]], based on a number of features&lt;ref&gt;Garbacz, Piotr (2008). [https://www.hf.uio.no/iln/om/organisasjon/tekstlab/aktuelt/arrangementer/arkiv/alvdalska.pdf Älvdalska – ett mindre känt nordiskt språk]. s. 1. Oslo universitet&lt;/ref&gt; that Elfdalian has in common with them. According to Lars Levander,&lt;ref&gt;Levander, Lars (1925), Dalmålet. Beskrivning och historia., "1", Uppsala&lt;/ref&gt; the [[West Scandinavian]] features that simultaneously do occur in Elfdalian are archaic traits that once were common in many Scandinavian dialects and have been preserved in the most conservative tongues east and west of [[Skanderna|Kölen.]]

==Characteristics==
Archaisms:
* Lack of syllable lengthening.
* The voiced fricatives {{IPAslink|ð}},  {{IPAslink|ɣ}} and /β/ are retained.
* The nominative, accusative and [[dative case]] are retained.
* Proto-Germanic, Proto-Norse and Old Norse nasal vowels are retained.
* The [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] [[voiced labio-velar approximant]] {{IPAslink|w}} is retained: e.g. ''{{lang|ovd|wattn}}'' ('water'), ''{{lang|ovd|will}}'' ('wants'), ''{{lang|ovd|wet}}'' ('knows') – compare English ''water'', ''will'', and ''wit''.

Innovations and unique developments:
* More frequent assimilation of pre-Norse ''mp'', ''nt'' and ''nk'' to ''pp'', ''tt'' and ''kk'', as in West Norse dialects.
* ''a'' &gt; ''o'' before Pre-Norse ''nk'' (but not ''kk'').
* Old Norse ''ei'', ''ey'' and ''au'' develop into ''ie'', ''ä'' and ''o'' respectively.
* Diphthongization of Old Norse long high vowels ''í'', ''ý'', ''ú'' to closing diphthongs ''ai'', ''åy'', ''au'', and of the long rounded mid vowels ''ó'', ''œ'' to opening diphthongs ''uo'', ''yö''.
* Vowel harmony (present also in other dialects of central Scandinavia).
* Loss of ''h''. Compare Elfdalian ''{{lang|ovd|aus}}'' with Swedish ''{{lang|sv|hus}}'' (or English ''house'') and Elfdalian ''{{lang|ovd|imil}}'' with Swedish ''{{lang|sv|himmel}}''.

==Phonology==
Elfdalian is comparable to Swedish and Norwegian in number and quality of vowels, but also has nasal vowels. It has retained the [[Old Norse]] [[Dental fricative|dental]], velar and labial voiced fricatives. [[Alveolo-palatal consonant|Alveolo-palatal]] [[affricate consonant]]s occur in all {{lang|ovd|Uvǫ Silan}} (Swedish ''{{lang|sv|Ovansiljan}}'', north of [[Siljan (lake)|Siljan]]) dialects. The realization of ‹r› is [r], an apical alveolar trill. Unlike many variants of Norwegian and Swedish, Elfdalian does not assimilate /rt, rd, rs, rn, rl/ into [[retroflex consonant]]s. Stress is generally on the first syllable of a word.

===Nasal vowels===
Nasal vowels are a unique feature of Elfdalian, having been lost from all other descendants of Old Norse at some point of their history. They have several origins, belonging to different layers of history, but most involve loss of a nasal consonant, with lengthening and nasalisation of a preceding vowel.
* Late Proto-Germanic loss of ''*n'' before ''*h''. The ''*h'' was lost in early Norse, but the nasalisation remained: ''{{lang|ovd|gą̊tt}}'' "doorway" (Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|ganhtiz}}'').
* Old Norse loss of nasal consonants before ''*s'': ''{{lang|ovd|gą̊ss}}'' "goose" (Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|gans-}}''), ''{{lang|ovd|įster}}'' "lard" ({{lang-gml|inster}}).
* Old Norse loss of ''*n'' before ''*l'' and ''*r'': ''{{lang|ovd|ųor}}'' "our" (Proto-Norse *''{{lang|non|unzraz}}'').
* Old Norse loss of word-final ''*n'' but only monosyllables: ''{{lang|ovd|ą̊}}'' "on" (Proto-Germanic ''*an''), ''{{lang|ovd|sją̊}}'' "to see" (Proto-Norse *''{{lang|non|sehwą}}''), ''{{lang|ovd|tųo}}'' "two (accusative)" (Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|twanz}}'') and the prefix ''{{lang|ovd|ųo-}}'' "un-" (Proto-Germanic ''{{lang|gem-x-proto|un-}}'').
* Central Scandinavian loss of word-final ''-n'' (in cases that it had been preserved in Old Norse generally). The change affected neither Standard Swedish nor did final geminate ''-nn''.  It occurred in primarily the definite noun suffix of feminine nouns but also ''{{lang|ovd|ą̊}}'' "she" and a few other words.
* Secondary post-Norse loss of ''n'' before ''s'': ''{{lang|ovd|rįesa}}'' "to wash" ({{lang-non|hreinsa}}), ''{{lang|ovd|wįster}}'' "left" (Old Norse ''{{lang|non|vinstri}}'').
* Spontaneous (non-etymological) nasality: ''{{lang|ovd|rįesa}}'' "to travel" (from {{lang-nds|rēsen}}), ''{{lang|ovd|kęse}}'' "cheese" ({{lang-non|kæsir}}, from {{lang-la|caseus}}).
* Before nasal consonants. Then, nasalisation is allophonic and is not indicated in the orthography.

==Grammar==
In common with some other [[Dalecarlian dialects|Dalecarlian]] [[vernacular]]s spoken north of the [[Siljan (lake)|Lake Siljan]], Elfdalian retains numerous old grammatical and phonological features that have not changed considerably since [[Old Norse]], and it is considered to be the most conservative and best preserved vernacular within the Dalecarlian branch. Having developed in relative isolation since the Middle Ages, quite a few linguistic innovations are also present in the language.

===Morphology===
Elfdalian has a morphological structure inherited from its Old Norse ancestor. Verbs are conjugated according to person and number and nouns have four [[grammatical case|cases]], similar to modern [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[German language|German]]. The Old Norse three-gender system has been retained. Like the other North Germanic languages, nouns have definite and indefinite forms rather than a separate definite article (as in English). The length of the root syllable plays a major role in the Elfdalian declensional and conjugational system. The declension of ''{{lang|ovd|warg}}'', "wolf" (long-syllabic, strong masculine noun) was as follows in what is sometimes called "Classic Elfdalian" (as described by Levander 1909):

{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center

|-

| {{lang|ovd|wardjemes}}
| —
| {{lang|ovd|wargumes}}
|}

Many speakers retain the distinct dative case, used especially after prepositions and also certain verbs (such as ''{{lang|ovd|jåpa}}'', "help").&lt;ref name="dahl"&gt;{{cite book |last=Dahl |first=Östen |editor=Geoffrey Sampson |first2=Gil |last2=David |first3=Peter |last3=Trudgill |title=Language Complexity as an Evolving Variable |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KopbpgAJ87UC&amp;pg=PA55 |accessdate=6 March 2013 |year=2009 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780191567667| pages=50–63 |chapter=Testing the Assumption of Complexity Invariance: The Case of Elfdalian and Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction between nominative and accusative has been lost in full nouns,{{clarify|reason=Is the spelling difference not reflective of pronunciation?|date=January 2016}} and the inherited genitive been replaced by new forms created by attaching ''{{lang|ovd|-es}}'' to the dative (see Dahl &amp; Koptjevskaja-Tamm 2005), a trend well underway even in Classic Elfdalian.

===Syntax===
Unlike other Swedish vernaculars, the syntax of Elfdalian was investigated in the early 20th century (Levander 1909). Although Elfdalian syntax has attracted increased attention, a majority of its syntactic elements are still unresearched. In May–June 2007, a group of linguists from the pan-Scandinavian NORMS network&lt;ref&gt;[http://norms.uit.no/ Nordic Center of Excellence in Microcomparative Syntax] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103224430/http://norms.uit.no/ |date=2007-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted fieldwork in Älvdalen especially aimed at investigating the syntactic properties of the language.

Presented with the help of generative syntax, the following features have been identified:

* Only first and second person plural pronouns (Rosenkvist 2006, 2010) can be dropped grammatically.
* First person plural pronouns may be dropped only if they appear directly in front of the finite verb. [[Raising (linguistics)|Verb raising]] occurs, although there is variation between generations (Garbacz 2006, 2010)
* Multiple subjects which seem to occur in clauses with the adverbial ''{{lang|ovd|sakta}}'', "actually", or the verb ''{{lang|ovd|lär}}'' "is possible" (Levander 1909:109).

: ''{{lang|ovd|Du ir sakt du uvendes duktin dalsk.}}''
: literally: "You are {{sc|advl}} you very good speak-Övdalian"
: "You are actually very good at speaking Övdalian"

This has recently been studied more closely from a generative perspective by Rosenkvist (2007).

Other syntactic properties are negative concord, stylistic inversion, long distance reflexives, verb controlled datives, agent-verb word order in coordinated clauses with deleted subjects, etc. Some of these properties are archaic features that existed in [[Old Swedish]], whereas others are innovations, but none of them have been studied in any detail.

==Writing systems==
In [[Älvdalen]], Germanic [[runes]] survived in use longer than anywhere else. The last record of the Elfdalian Runes is from 1929; these runes are a variant of the [[Dalecarlian runes]]. Älvdalen can be said to have had its own alphabet during the 17th and 18th century.

Due to the great phonetic differences between Swedish and Elfdalian, the use of Swedish orthography for Elfdalian has been unpredictable and varied, e.g. as applied in the Prytz's play from 1622, which contains long passages in Elfdalian, or in the Elfdalian material published in the periodical ''Skansvakten''.

A first attempt to create a separate Elfdalian orthography was made in 1999 by Bengt Åkerberg. Åkerberg's orthography was applied in some books and used in language courses. This orthography is based on Loka dialect and is highly phonetic, involving a great deal of diacritics (Sapir 2006).

===Råðdjärum's orthography===
In March 2005, a uniform standard orthography for Elfdalian was presented by {{lang|ovd|Råðdjärum}} (lit. "Let us confer"), The Elfdalian Language Council, and accepted by ''{{lang|ovd|Ulum Dalska}}'' (lit. "Let us speak Dalecarlian"), The Organization for the Preservation of Elfdalian. The new orthography has already been applied by Björn Rehnström in his book ''{{lang|ovd|Trair byönner frą̊ Övdalim}}'' 'Three Bears from Älvdalen' published in 2007. Råðdjärum's orthography was also used in Bo Westling's translation of {{lang|fr|[[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry|Saint-Exupéry]]}}'s ''[[The Little Prince]]'', ''{{lang|ovd|Lisslprinsn}}''.

===Elfdalian alphabet===
{{main|Elfdalian alphabet}}
The Elfdalian alphabet consists of the following letters:

: Aa Ąą Bb Dd Đð Ee Ęę Ff Gg Hh Ii Įį Jj Kk Ll Mm Nn Oo Ǫǫ Pp Rr Ss Tt Uu Ųų Vv Ww Yy Y̨y̨ Zz Åå Ą̊ą̊ Ää Öö

Besides letters occurring in the Swedish alphabet, Elfdalian has letters with [[ogonek]], denoting [[nasal vowel]]s: Ąą, Ęę, Įį, Ǫǫ, Ųų, Y̨y̨ and Ą̊ą̊. Additionally, it uses the letter [[eth]] ({{ipa|Ð}}, {{IPA|ð}}) for the [[voiced dental fricative]].

==Language status==
As of 2009, Elfdalian had around 2,000 speakers and is in danger of [[language death]]. However, it is possible that it will receive an official status as a [[minority language]] in Sweden, which would entail numerous protections and encourage its use in schools and by writers and artists. The Swedish Parliament was due to address this issue in 2007, but apparently has not yet done so.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multietn.uu.se/information/elfdalian_english.html Uppsala University, Second Conference on Elfdalian, Älvdalen 12–14 June 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302044736/http://www.multietn.uu.se/information/elfdalian_english.html |date=2 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Council of Europe]] has urged the Swedish government to reconsider the status of Elfdalian on four different occasions, most recently in October 2011. The Committee of Experts now encourages the Swedish authorities to investigate the status of Elfdalian through an independent scientific study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/education/minlang/report/EvaluationReports/SwedenECRML4_en.pdf |title=Report of the Committee of Experts on Sweden |publisher=[[Council of Europe]] |date=October 2011 |page=9 |format=PDF |accessdate=May 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preservation and standardization===
''{{lang|ovd|Ulum Dalska}}'', The Organization for the Preservation of Elfdalian, was established in 1984 with the aim of preserving and documenting the Elfdalian language. In 2005, ''{{lang|ovd|Ulum Dalska}}'' launched a process aimed at bringing about an official recognition of Elfdalian as a language by the Swedish authorities.

''{{lang|ovd|Råðdjärum}}'', The Elfdalian Language Committee was established in August 2004 within ''{{lang|ovd|Ulum Dalska}}'', its first task being to create a new standard orthography for Elfdalian. In March 2005, the new orthography created by ''{{lang|ovd|Råðdjärum}}'' was accepted by the ''{{lang|ovd|Ulum Dalska}}'' at their annual meeting. ''{{lang|ovd|Råðdjärum}}'' consists of five permanent members: linguist [[Östen Dahl]], dialectologist Gunnar Nyström, teacher Inga-Britt Petersson, linguist and coordinator of the committee Dr. Yair Sapir, and linguist Lars Steensland.

As an initiative from ''{{lang|ovd|Ulum Dalska}}'' to encourage children to speak Elfdalian, all school children in Älvdalen who finish the ninth grade and can prove that they can speak Elfdalian receive a 6,000 [[Swedish krona|SEK]] [[stipend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Björn |last=Rehnström|title=Får 6000 för att prata älvdalska |url=http://www.dt.se/nyheter/alvdalen/1.3461598-far-6000-for-att-prata-alvdalska |newspaper=[[Dalarnas Tidningar]] |date=25 April 2013 |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An online version of Lars Steensland’s 2010 Elfdalian dictionary was published in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://älvdalsk.ordbok.gratis Elfdalian–Swedish dictionary.] Retrieved 1 October 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, [[Sveriges Radio|Swedish Radio]] reported that the Älvdalen City Council had decided that, starting in autumn 2016, the local [[kindergarten]] would operate solely through the medium of Elfdalian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sverigesradio.se/sida/artikel.aspx?programid=161&amp;artikel=6391217 |title=Barn i förskolan ska språkbada i älvdalska |trans-title=Children in preschool should be immersed in Elfdalian |publisher=[[Sveriges Radio]] |date=16 March 2016 |accessdate=9 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-35831359|title=Swedish nursery to teach rare Viking-era language|date=17 March 2016|publisher=British Broadcasting Corp.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New organisms named after Elfdalian==
A new genus ''Elfdaliana'' of deep-sea [[nudibranch]] molluscs has been named recently after the Elfdalian language in reference to evolutionary basal characters of the new genus never before reported for this family just as Elfdalian preserves ancestral features of Old Norse.&lt;ref name="Martynov A., Korshunova T. 2015."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Martynov |first1=Alexander |last2=Korshunova |first2=Tatiana |title=A new deep-sea genus of the family Polyceridae (Nudibranchia) possesses a gill cavity, with implications for the cryptobranch condition and a ‘Periodic Table’ approach to taxonomy |journal=Journal of Molluscan Studies |date=March 2015 |pages=1–15 |doi=10.1093/mollus/eyv003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Empty''''' is a cult, [[Australian]] "creative" magazine, concerned largely with printed design work, photography, illustration and film, created for the professional creative community.

The magazine is published by [[Sydney]]-based [[Design is Kinky]] studio, curators of the [[Semi-Permanent]] design festival, a fixture in design culture's global landscape, which occurs annually in Australia.

The magazine acts largely as a gallery of artwork, both domestic and international. It also features cultural commentary and interviews with artists, animators, other magazines, and so on. Notable interviewees have included [[Mark Andrews (writer)|Mark Andrews]], head of story on [[The Incredibles]] (cover story, issue 2, late-2004) and [[Dan Houser]] of [[Rockstar Games]] (issue 3, early-2005). 

''Empty'' was launched in April 2004 and is published somewhat arbitrarily, but usually occurs on a bi-monthly basis.

The magazine features little to no advertising whatsoever.

Current editor is [[Andrew Johnstone]], creator of ''Empty'' and the above-mentioned [[Design is Kinky]] and [[Semi-Permanent]].

The magazine enjoys newsstand distribution, but at this time is distributed only within Australia.

'''Fenqing''' ({{zh|t=憤青|s=愤青|p=Fènqīng}}), or '''FQ''' (abbreviation), which is itself an abbreviation for ''Fennu Qingnian'' ({{zh|t=憤怒青年|s=愤怒青年|p=Fènnù Qīngnián}}), means literally "angry youth". It mainly refers to Chinese youth who display a high level of [[Chinese nationalism]].&lt;ref name=ces1&gt;Chinese Education &amp; Society, V39#3 (May–June 2006), P3-9&lt;/ref&gt; This term first appeared in [[Hong Kong]] in the 1970s, referring to those young people who were not satisfied with Chinese society and sought reform.&lt;ref name="cnorg"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/2005/Nov/149085.htm|title=Unease over China's angry youth|last=Rui|first=Zhang|date=November 17, 2005|publisher=[[China.org.cn]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has now evolved into a term used predominantly in [[Internet slang]]. Whether ''fenqing'' is [[derogatory]] or not usually depends on the person. Chinese critics often refer to them using the homophone characters "{{lang|zh|粪青}}"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2008/07/28/080728fa_fact_osnos?currentPage=6|title= Angry Youth|accessdate=2009-03-16 |work= |publisher= ''The New Yorker''|date= 2008-07-28|quote= Young patriots are so polarizing in China that some people, by changing the intonation in Chinese, pronounce “angry youth” as “shit youth.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are pronounced identically but translate to "shit-youth". This is often changed further to ''fènfèn'' ({{lang|zh|粪粪}}) as a [[derogatory]] nickname.

The phenomenon of ''fenqing'' arose after the "[[reform and opening up]]" of the [[Politics of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]], during the period of fast economic development that occurred in China.&lt;ref name="ces1" /&gt; Some people argue {{Who|date=May 2011}} that ''fenqing'' are a natural reaction to recent [[neoconservatism in Japan]] and the [[neoconservatism in the United States]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} ''Fenqing'' and these foreign neo-conservative elements intensely dislike each other, but all of them share certain similarities: distrust of foreign powers, support for the [[military]] and boundary disputes, etc.&lt;ref name="ces1" /&gt; However, ''fenqing'' are not to be confused with [[Neoconservatism in China|Chinese neoconservatives]], who espouse a more pragmatic and gradualist approach to political reforms and favor the development of an "East Asian Community" with Japan and Korea, an idea that is anathema to the ''fenqing'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2008/03/08/the-rise-of-china-s-neocons.html|title=World View: The Rise of China’s Neocons|date=8 March 2008|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a group, ''fenqing'' are very diverse in their opinions. However, they are usually [[nationalistic]] and [[patriotic]],  are often left-wing in political ideology, and tend to defend [[Mao Zedong]]'s controversial actions during the [[Great Leap Forward]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.cri.cn/6909/2009/05/09/45s483256.htm|title=Angry Youth and China's Future |last=Daming|first=Tang|date=May 9, 2009|publisher=[[China Radio International]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''fenqing'' are very much concerned with political issues, especially in domestic policy relating to [[Tibet]] and foreign policy relating to [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], or the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=ces1/&gt;

They often harbour negative attitudes towards [[Japan]] due to the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|invasion and occupation of China]] by [[Imperial Japan]], and support aggressive political stances towards Japan.&lt;ref name="cnorg"/&gt; For example, many believe that the [[List of war apology statements issued by Japan|Japanese government's apologies]] for [[Japanese war crimes]] are insincere and inadequate (some even believe no apologies will ever be adequate). More recent incidents, such a former Japanese prime minister's patronage of the [[Yasukuni Shrine]], territorial disputes surrounding the [[Senkaku Islands]] (known as Diaoyu in China), and the [[Japanese history textbook controversies|revisions of history textbooks]] by [[uyoku dantai]] (Japanese right-wing extremists), lead these young people to conclude that the Japanese government is again seeking to expand militarily. These [[anti-Japanese sentiment]]s are not necessarily only directed against the Japanese government and military, but often fiercely towards the [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]], economy, and [[Japanese people|people]].

''Fenqing'' also refers to "20-somethings often use the Internet to publicly express their views on politics and society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-05/27/content_7948026.htm|title=Post-80s: The vexed generation?|last=Linyan|first=Wang|date=May 27, 2009|publisher=''[[China Daily]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
[[File:愤青抵制日货.jpg|thumb|Boycott of Japanese Goods]]
Some support [[Chinese boycotts of Japanese products]], for historical reasons and in response to the events described above.&lt;ref name="cnorg" /&gt; They may dislike Chinese [[Japanophile]]s and other Chinese who are more Westernized and free-market oriented, calling them [[Hanjian]] ("Chinese traitors"). 

Some ''fenqing'' view Taiwan as a part of China, and believe that [[Taiwan independence]] should be prevented by any means necessary. Many tend to consider war to be feasible, if not immediately necessary. A few may even favor the use of nuclear weapons against Taiwan.{{By whom|date=November 2011}}

Some view American or Western attention to issues such as [[Human rights in the People's Republic of China|human rights]], [[Falun Gong]], Tibet, etc. as attempts to undermine the rise of China. Most support the ideal of [[democracy]], but view Western attempts to spread democracy as self-serving, subversive propaganda. However, only a few truly believe in [[communism]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In May,1999, China's embassy's was bombed in the Republic of Yugoslavia by American army. This event irritated the “angry youth” and they made remonstration to it. Chinese hackers attacked many American websites. In the demonstrations, the most eye-catching slogans calling for a boycott included ‘Burn all McDonald’s in China’ and ‘Damage American intellectual property by practical action: free provision of pirated software’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Zayiza Mei Shiguan You Shenme Liaobuqi (What a Big Deal to Destroy the American Embassy?|last = Sang|first = w.|date = 1999|journal = Mingpao Monthly|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001, hackers in both countries began their fight again. Most of the “angry youth” believe that the United States doesn’t want China to develop.

Some have the view that the Chinese Communist government is invincible and justified at all cases. They may unconditionally defend all action by the [[Communist Party of China]], or by [[Mao Zedong]] against countries they feel that "threaten China's rise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/focus/2009/09/2009923112053530390.html|title=The meaning of Mao  |last=Gardner|first=Dinah|date=September 30, 2009|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others simply defend the Chinese government because they believe it to be better than an alternative government which they believe would be dominated by Westerners.

Some{{who|date=November 2011}} are very passionate about irredentist claims. In addition to the official claims made by the [[People's Republic of China]], such as Taiwan, [[Arunachal Pradesh]], the [[Senkaku Islands]], and the [[South China Sea Islands]], some ''fenqing'' also make irredentist claims to [[Outer Mongolia]], [[Tuva]], [[Outer Manchuria]], the [[Hukawng Valley]] of northern [[Myanmar]], parts of [[Central Asia]] east of [[Lake Balkhash]], [[Bhutan]], [[Ladakh]], and [[Sikkim]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

They generally abhor political corruption within the government and government organizations. Many ''fenqing'' care greatly about the poor and believe they are the voice of the poor, advocating social security policies, and despise what they call the "elites" of China. Most ''fenqing'' are highly skeptical about the free market and often blame it as the source of corruption, social inequalities and the weakening of the central government. They also generally perceive the government as being too nice or ineffectual in a variety of issues, such as the Taiwan Straits, relations with Japan or the U.S., and Tibetan and Xinjiang independence.  For some{{who|date=November 2011}} their role models are [[Lu Xun]] and the activists of the [[May Fourth Movement]]. Some ''fenqing'' believe if Lu Xun were still alive today, he would continue fiercely criticizing the government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The Chinese Communist party does not officially espouse [[Han chauvinism]]. It espouses [[Zhonghua minzu]] nationalism, which emphasizes assimilation into a modern nation of multiethnic origins, and emphasizes the Zhonghua nation's modern-era struggles against the "Imperialists": the West and Japan,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and the historical multiethnic Zhonghua nation's insistence on unity under a single imperial state.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Militant nationalist websites, whether Zhonghua or Han, are often suppressed by the government because they appear to be elevating popular discussions into political levels. The government simply has a habit of clamping down on any kind of political discussions to prevent them from becoming ideologies that can replace official Zhonghua-Marxo-Capitalism.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Zhonghua nationalist websites tend to style themselves as "ultra-left socialist", venerating Mao as an anti-colonial icon over his capitalist successors, and identify Japan and US as their prime enemies,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and focus very heavily on the goal of militarily invading Taiwan. Uyghurs and Tibetans are discussed as if they are mainly law-abiding Zhonghua citizens, with a minority elements instigated by overseas "separatist exiles".{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

'''Garden furniture''', also called '''patio furniture''' or '''outdoor furniture''', is a type of [[furniture]] specifically designed for outdoor use.  It is typically made of [[Weathering|weather-resistant]] materials such as aluminium which does not rust. The oldest surviving examples of garden furniture were found in the gardens of [[Pompeii]].

==Types of furniture==
[[Image:2007Computex NYNY Intel Umbrellas.jpg|thumb|right|An area of typical patio furniture, including [[umbrellas]], in [[Taiwan]].]]
{{main article|List of furniture types}}
*Wooden furniture
*Bamboo furniture
*Wicker or rattan furniture
*Metal furniture
*Plastic furniture (a.k.a. acrylic furniture)
*Glass furniture
*Concrete furniture

=== Seating ===
Garden furniture is often sold as a ''patio set'' consisting of a [[Table (furniture)|table]], four or six [[chair]]s, and a [[Umbrella|(parasol)]].  A [[picnic table]] is used for the purpose of eating a meal outdoors. Long chairs, referred to as ''[[chaise longue]]'', are also common items. Recently seating furniture has been used for conversation areas using items like [[couches]].

=== Temperature control ===
{{See also|Outdoor fireplace}}
The British 'garden parasol' or American 'garden umbrella' is the term for a specialised&lt;!-- This spelling is correct as British English --&gt; type of [[umbrella]] designed to provide shade from the sun. Parasols are either secured in a weighted base or a built-in mount in the paving. Some are movable around outdoor tables and seating, others centred&lt;!-- This spelling is correct as British English --&gt; through a hole mid-table.

[[Patio heater]]s are used to enable people to sit outside at night or in cold weather. They can be permanently mounted on eaves and patio roofs, or portable and self-supporting.  They can operate on electricity, [[propane]], bottled [[butane]] (small units), or  natural gas. The latter can be plumbed into permanent locations or attached to 'quick-connect' outlets.

Modular outdoor fire pits and portable fire bowls have become widely available in many materials to extend outdoor living. The tall clay ''[[Chimenea]]s'' of North America are an example.

=== Accessories ===
Current garden accessories include items like birdbaths, plant stands, planter boxes and trellises to add detail to an outdoor space.

==Materials==
[[File:Green garden furniture from plastics in Czech Republic.jpg|thumb|Green [[plastic]] garden furniture]]
The most commonly sold types of patio sets are made of plastic, wood, aluminium, [[wicker]], and [[wrought iron]].

[[File:Teak bench designed by Edwin Lutyens.jpg|thumb|upright|A classic bench design by [[Edwin Lutyens]]]]
Wooden garden furniture can suffer through exposure to the elements and therefore needs to be periodically [[Wood preservation|treated]]. [[Teak]] is a commonly used material for outdoor furniture. It naturally contains [[silica]], which makes it resistant to [[Fungus|fungal decay]], many of the effects of water (such as rot, swelling and warping), as well as chemicals.  It is also resistant to fire, acid and alkalis.

When Teak weathers it loses its original look but gains a majestic, almost silver glow. Many owners prefer the aged look of teak and because of its resistance to rotting and infestation, it can be appreciated without upkeep. 
Aluminium garden furniture is robust and long-lasting. However, if the protective coating is compromised it will corrode. Plastic garden furniture is naturally waterproof, so it can be left out year-round. Waterproof outdoor furniture pieces are usually made of materials such as Mahogany, Teak, Cast Aluminum, PE Wicker, Plastic and PVC Wicker.{{cn|date=March 2016}} These materials are durable and can withstand the elements of wind, rain and sun exposure.

[[Wicker]] outdoor living furniture was originally made from the stems of any one of 600 species of [[Arecaceae|palm]]s found in tropical regions all over the world.  The palm stems were tightly woven into interlocking panels, and formed into the desired structure. Now, most modern wicker furniture is made from [[synthetic resin]], increasing the life expectancy and reducing manufacturing costs. Today's resin furniture is often made of recycled plastic and incredibly durable, usually carrying warranties of 20 years or longer. It can be moulded to resemble real wood or wicker.

In the [[Germanic languages]], a '''strong verb''' is a verb that marks its past tense by means of changes to the stem vowel ([[Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]). The majority of the remaining verbs form the past tense by means of a [[dental consonant|dental]] [[suffix]] (e.g. ''-ed'' in English), and are known as ''[[Germanic weak verb|weak verb]]s''.

In modern English, strong verbs include ''sing'' (present ''I sing'', past ''I sang'', past participle ''I have sung'') and ''drive'' (present ''I drive'', past ''I drove'', past participle ''I have driven''), as opposed to weak verbs such as ''open'' (present ''I open'', past ''I opened'', past participle ''I have opened''). Not all verbs with a change in the stem vowel are strong verbs, however; they may also be irregular weak verbs such as ''bring, brought, brought'' or ''keep, kept, kept''. The key distinction is that most strong verbs have their origin in the sound system of Indo-European, whereas weak verbs use a dental ending (in English usually ''-ed'' or ''-t'') that was introduced later, during the development of the Germanic languages.

The "[[strong inflection|strong]]" vs. "[[Weak inflection|weak]]" terminology was coined by the German philologist [[Jacob Grimm]] in the 1800s, and the terms "strong verb" and "weak verb" are direct translations of the original German terms "starkes Verb" and "schwaches Verb".

==Origin and development==

Strong verbs have their origin in the ancestral [[Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) language. In PIE, vowel alternations called ''[[Proto-Indo-European ablaut|ablaut]]'' were frequent and occurred in many types of word, not only in verbs. The vowel that appeared in any given syllable is called its "grade". In many words, the basic vowel was *''e'' (e-grade), but, depending on what syllable of a word the stress fell on in PIE, this could change to *''o'' (o-grade), or disappear altogether (zero grade). Both ''e'' and ''o'' could also be lengthened to ''ē'' and ''ō'' (lengthened grade). Thus ablaut turned short ''e'' into the following sounds:

{| class="wikitable"
| zero
| short
| long
|-
| rowspan=2 | Ø
| e
| ē
|-
| o
| ō
|}

As the Germanic languages developed from PIE, they dramatically altered the Indo-European verbal system. PIE verbs had no [[Grammatical tense|tense]], but could occur in three distinct ''aspects'': the [[aorist]], present and perfect aspect. The aorist originally denoted events without any attention to the specifics or ongoing nature of the event ("ate", [[perfective aspect]]). The present implied some attention to such details and was thus used for ongoing actions ("is eating", [[imperfective aspect]]). The perfect was a [[stative verb]], and referred not to the event itself, but to the state that resulted from the event ("has eaten" or "is/has been eaten"). In Germanic, the aorist eventually disappeared and merged with the present, while the perfect took on a past tense meaning and became a general past tense. The strong Germanic present thus descends from the PIE present, while the past descends from the PIE perfect. The inflexions of PIE verbs also changed considerably.

In the course of these changes, the different root-vowels caused by PIE ablaut became markers of tense. Thus in Germanic, *''bʰer-'' became {{wikt-lang|gem-pro|*beraną}} in the infinitive (e-grade); *''bar'' in the past singular (o-grade); *''bērun'' in the past plural (ē-grade); and *''buranaz'' in the past participle (zero-grade).

In [[Proto-Germanic]], the system of strong verbs was largely regular. As [[sound change]]s took place in the development of Germanic from PIE, the vowels of strong verbs became more varied, but usually in predictable ways, so in most cases all of the [[principal parts]] of a strong verb of a given class could be reliably predicted from the infinitive. Thus we can reconstruct Common Germanic as having seven coherent classes of strong verbs. This system continued largely intact in the first attested Germanic languages, notably [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old English]], [[Old High German]] and [[Old Norse]].

===Gradual disappearance===

Germanic strong verbs, mostly deriving directly from PIE, are slowly being supplanted by or transformed into weak verbs.

As well as developing the strong verb system, Germanic also went on to develop two other classes of verbs: the weak verbs and a third, much smaller, class known as the [[preterite-present verb]]s, which are continued in the English auxiliary verbs, e.g. ''can/could, shall/should, may/might, must''. Weak verbs originally derived from other types of word in PIE and originally occurred only in the present aspect. They did not have a perfect aspect, meaning that they came to lack a past tense in Germanic once the perfect had become the past. Not having a past tense at all, they obviously also had no vowel alternations between present and past. To compensate for this, a new type of past tense was eventually created for these verbs by adding a ''-d-'' or ''-t-'' suffix to the stem. This is why only strong verbs have vowel alternations: their past tense forms descend from the original PIE perfect aspect, while the past tense forms of weak verbs were created later.

The development of weak verbs in Germanic meant that the strong verb system ceased to be productive: no new strong verbs developed. Practically all new verbs were weak, and few new strong verbs were created. Over time, strong verbs tended to become weak in some languages, so that the total number of strong verbs in the languages was constantly decreasing.

The coherence of the strong verb system is still present in modern [[German language|German]], [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]]. For example, in German and Dutch, strong verbs are consistently marked with a past participle in ''-en'', while weak verbs have a past participle in ''-t'' in German and ''-t'' or ''-d'' in Dutch. In English, however, the original regular strong conjugations have largely disintegrated, with the result that in modern English grammar, a distinction between strong and weak verbs is less useful than a distinction between "regular" and "irregular" verbs. Thus the verb ''to help'', which used to be conjugated ''help-holp-holpen'', is now ''help-helped-helped''. The reverse phenomenon, whereby a weak verb becomes strong by analogy, is rare (one example in American English, considered informal by some authorities, is ''sneak, snuck, snuck.'' Another is the humorous past tense of "sneeze" which is "snoze"&lt;ref&gt;1957, S. Lee Crump, Boys' Life - Aug 1957 - Page 62:
I sneezed a sneeze into the air; / It fell to earth I know not where. / But hard and cold were the looks of those / In whose vicinity I snoze. cited at http://www.engyes.com/en/dic-content/Anagrams/snoze&lt;/ref&gt;).

Some verbs, which might be termed "semi-strong", have formed a weak preterite but retained the strong participle, or rarely vice versa. This type of verb is most common in Dutch:
* ''lachen lachte'' (formerly ''loech'') ''gelachen'' ("to laugh")
* ''vragen vroeg'' (formerly ''vraagde'') ''gevraagd'' ("to ask")
Examples in English are ''swell, swelled, swollen''

== Conjugation ==

As an example of the conjugation of a strong verb, we may take the Old English class 2 verb {{wikt-lang|ang|bēodan}}, "to offer" (cf. English "bid").

This has the following forms:

While the inflections are more or less regular, the vowel changes in the stem are not predictable without an understanding of the Indo-European ''ablaut'' system, and students have to learn four or five "[[principal parts]]" by heart – the number depends on whether one considers the third-person singular present tense as a principal part. If we choose to use all five, then for this verb they are ''bēodan, bīett, bēad, budon, boden''. The list of five principal parts includes:
# The infinitive: ''bēodan''. The same vowel is used through most of the present tense.
# The present tense 3rd singular: ''bīett''. The same vowel is used in the 2nd singular.
# The preterite 1st singular (from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] perfect): ''bēad'', which is identical to the 3rd singular.
# The preterite plural: ''budon''. The same vowel is used in the 2nd singular.
# The past participle (from the PIE verbal noun): ''boden''. This vowel is used only in the participle.

Strictly speaking, in this verb ''ablaut'' causes only a threefold distinction: parts 1 and 2 are from the e-grade, part 3 from the o-grade, and parts 4 and 5 from the zero grade. The other two distinctions are caused by different kinds of regressive [[metaphony]]: part 2, when it is distinct at all, is always derived from part 1 by [[Germanic umlaut|Umlaut]]. In some verbs, part 5 is a discrete ablaut grade, but in this class 2 verb it is derived from part 4 by an [[a-mutation]].

==Strong verb classes==

Germanic strong verbs are commonly divided into 7 classes, based on the type of vowel alternation. This is in turn based mostly on the type of consonants that follow the vowel. The Anglo-Saxon scholar [[Henry Sweet]] gave names to the seven classes:

I. The "drive" conjugation

II. The "choose" conjugation

III. The "bind" conjugation

IV. The "bear" conjugation

V. The "give" conjugation

VI. The "shake" conjugation

VII. The "fall" conjugation

However, they are normally referred to by numbers alone.

In [[Proto-Germanic]], the common ancestor of the Germanic languages, the strong verbs were still mostly regular. The classes continued largely intact in [[Old English]] and the other older historical Germanic languages: [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Old High German]] and [[Old Norse]]. However, idiosyncrasies of the phonological changes led to a growing number of subgroups. Also, once the ablaut system ceased to be productive, there was a decline in the speakers' awareness of the regularity of the system. That led to anomalous forms and the six big classes lost their cohesion. This process has advanced furthest in English, but in some other modern Germanic languages (such as German), the seven classes are still fairly well preserved and recognisable.

The reverse process in which anomalies are eliminated and subgroups reunited by the force of analogy is called "[[morphological leveling|levelling]]", and it can be seen at various points in the history of the verb classes.

In the later Middle Ages, German, Dutch and English eliminated a great part of the old distinction between the vowels of the singular and plural preterite forms. The new uniform preterite could be based on the vowel of the old preterite singular, on the old plural, or sometimes on the participle. In English, the distinction remains in the verb "to be": ''I was, we were''. In Dutch, it remains in the verbs of classes 4 &amp; 5 but only in [[vowel length]]: ''ik brak'' (I broke - short ''a''), ''wij braken'' (we broke - long ''ā''). In German and Dutch it also remains in the present tense of the [[Preterite-present verb|preterite presents]]. In [[Limburgish]] there is a little more left. E.g. the preterite of to help is ''(weer) hólpe'' for the plural but either ''(ich) halp'' or ''(ich) hólp'' for the singular.

In the process of development of English, numerous sound changes and analogical developments have fragmented the classes to the extent that most of them no longer have any coherence: only classes 1, 3 and 4 still have significant subclasses that follow uniform patterns.

For a treatment of the classes one at a time showing how the forms evolved in the various Germanic languages, one can consult an older version of this Wikipedia article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Germanic_strong_verb&amp;oldid=571100317|title=Germanic strong verb|date=1 September 2013|publisher=|via=Wikipedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before looking at the seven classes individually, the general developments that affected all of them will be noted. The following phonological changes that occurred between Proto-Indo-European and Proto-Germanic are relevant for the discussion of the ''ablaut'' system.

* The development of [[grammatischer Wechsel]] as a result of [[Verner's law]] (the voicing of fricatives after an unstressed vowel). This created variations in the consonant following the ''ablaut'' vowel.
* When the zero grade appears before ''l'', ''r'', ''m'' or ''n'', the vowel ''u'' was inserted, effectively creating a new "u-grade".
* ''o'' → ''a'' (also ''oy'' → ''ai'', ''ow'' → ''au'').
* ''e'' → ''i'' when ''i'', ''ī'' or ''j'' followed in the next syllable. This change is known as [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]], and was extended to affect other vowels in most later languages.
* ''ey'' → ''ī'' as a result of the above.
* ''e'' → ''i'' before ''m'' or ''n'' followed by another consonant. This had the effect of splitting class 3 into 3a and 3b.

For the purpose of explanation, the different verb forms can be grouped by the vowel they receive, and given a "principal part" number:

# All forms of the present tense, including the [[indicative mood]], [[subjunctive mood]], [[imperative mood]], the infinitive and present participle.
# The singular forms of the past tense in the indicative mood.
# All other past tense forms, which includes the past dual and plural in the indicative mood, and all forms of the past subjunctive mood.
# The past participle, alone.

In West Germanic, the 2nd person singular past indicative deviates from this scheme and uses the vowel of Part 3.  Its ending is also an ''-i'' of unclear origin, rather than the expected ''-t'' &amp;lt; PIE *''-th₂e'' of North and East Germanic, which suggests that this state of affairs is an innovation.

===Classes 1 to 6===

The first 5 classes appear to continue the following PIE ablaut grades:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Class
! Part 1
! Part 2
! Part 3
! Part 4
|-
| 1, 2, 3
| rowspan="3" | e
| rowspan="3" | o
| colspan="2" | zero
|-
| 4
| ē
| zero
|-
| 5
| ē
| e
|}

Except for the apparent ē-grade in part 3 of classes 4 and 5, these are in fact straightforward survivals of the PIE situation.

The standard pattern of PIE is represented in Germanic by classes 1, 2 and 3, with the present (part 1) in the e-grade, past indicative singular (part 2) in the o-grade, and remaining past (part 3) and past participle (part 4) in the zero grade. The differences between classes 1, 2, and 3 arise from semivowels coming after the root vowel, as shown in the table below.

As can be seen, the e-grade in part 1 and o-grade in part 2 are shared by all of these five classes. The difference between them is in parts 3 and 4:

* In classes 1 and 2, the semivowel following the vowel was converted in the zero grade into a full vowel.
* In class 3 and the past participle of class 4, there was no semivowel but there were PIE syllabic resonants which developed in Germanic to ''u'' plus resonant; thus ''u'' became the Germanic sign of these parts.  There is some evidence that this may have been the original behaviour of the past nonsingular / nonindicative of class 4 as well: to wit, [[preterite-present]]s whose roots have the class 4 shape show ''u'' outside the present indicative singular, such as *''man-'' ~ *''mun-'' "to remember", *''skal-'' ~ *''skul-'' "to owe".
* In class 5, the zero grade of the past participle had probably been changed to e-grade already in PIE, because these verbs had combinations of consonants that were [[phonotactics|phonotactically]] illicit as a word-initial cluster, as they would be in the zero grade.
* The *ē in part 3 of classes 4 and 5 is not in fact a PIE lengthened grade but arose in Germanic.  Ringe suggests that it was analogically generalised from the inherited part 3 of the verb *''etaną'' "to eat" before it had lost its reduplicant syllable, PIE *''h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;eh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;d-'' regularly becoming Germanic *''ēt-''.

Class 6 appears in Germanic with the vowels ''a'' and ''ō''.  PIE sources of the ''a'' vowel included ''*h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e'', ''*o'', and a laryngeal between consonants;&lt;ref&gt;Examples: ''*aka-'' &lt; ''*h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ego-'' ("to drive"), ''*mala-'' &lt; ''*molh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;o-'' ("to grind"), ''*habja-'' ("to lift") &lt; ''*kh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;pio-'' ("to seize"). See Ringe 2006, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; possibly in some cases the ''a'' may be an example of the [[Indo-European ablaut#a-grade|a-grade]] of ablaut, though the existence of such a grade is controversial.  It is not clear exactly how the ''ō'' is to be derived from an earlier ablaut alternant in PIE, but believable sources include contraction of the reduplicant syllable in PIE *''h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''-initial verbs, or o-grades of verbs with interconsonantal laryngeal.  In any event, within Germanic the resulting ''a'' ~ ''ō'' behaved as just another type of vowel alternation.

In [[Proto-Germanic]], this resulted in the following vowel patterns:

* Class 2b is of unknown origin, and does not seem to reflect any PIE ablaut pattern.
* In class 3, there are also a few cases where the vowel is followed, at least in Proto-Germanic, by two consonants, neither of which is a nasal or a liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Ringe, Don. 2006. A Linguistic History of English. From Proto-Indo-European to Proto-Germanlic. pp. 226, 243.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples: *''brestaną'' "to burst", *''þreskaną'' "to thresh" *''fehtaną'' "to fight". All but one have a nasal or a liquid ''in front'' of the vowel.  This will have become syllabic and resulted regularly in ''u'' before the nasal or liquid, which was then metathesised on the analogy of the remaining principle parts.  E.g. part 3 of *''brestaną'' will have been *''bʰr̥st-'' &amp;gt; *''burst-'', reformed to *''brust-''.
* Similarly, class 6 includes some cases where the vowel is followed by two obstruents, like *''wahsijaną'' "to grow".
* In classes 5, 6 and 7, there is also a small subgroup called "j-presents". These form their present tense with an extra ''-j-'', which causes [[Germanic umlaut|umlaut]] in the present where possible. In West Germanic, it also causes the [[West Germanic gemination]].

===Class 7===

The forms of class 7 were very different and did not neatly reflect the standard ablaut grades found in the first 5 classes. Instead of (or in addition to) vowel alternations, this class displayed [[reduplication]] of the first consonants of the stem in the past tense.

It is generally believed that reduplication was once a feature of all Proto-Indo-European perfect-aspect forms. It was then lost in most verbs by Proto-Germanic times due to [[haplology]]. However, verbs with vowels that did not fit in the existing pattern of alternation retained their reduplication. Class 7 is thus not really one class, but can be split into several subclasses based on the original structure of the root, much like the first 5 classes. The first three subclasses are parallel with classes 1 to 3 but with ''e'' replaced with ''a'': 7a is parallel to class 1, class 7b to class 2, and class 7c to class 3.

The following is a general picture of the Proto-Germanic situation as reconstructed by [[Jay Jasanoff]].&lt;ref name="Jasanoff 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jasanoff |first1=Jay |year=2008 |title=From Reduplication to Ablaut: The Class VII Strong Verbs of Northwest Germanic |url=http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~jasanoff/pdf/From%20Reduplication%20to%20Ablaut.pdf |accessdate=26 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier reconstructions of the 7th class were generally based mostly on Gothic evidence.

The situation sketched above did not survive intact into any of the Germanic languages. It was changed significantly, but rather differently in Gothic on one hand, and in the Northwest Germanic languages on the other.

====Gothic====

Reduplication was retained in Gothic, with the vowel ''ai'' inserted. However, as in all other strong verbs, consonant alternations were almost entirely eliminated in favour of the voiceless alternants. The present and past singular stem was extended to the plural, leaving the reduplication as the only change in the stem between the two tenses. The vowel alternation was retained in a few class 7d verbs, but eliminated otherwise by generalising the present tense stem throughout the paradigm. The verb ''lētan'' "to allow" retained the past form ''lailōt'' with ablaut, while ''slēpan'' "to sleep" had the past tense form ''saislēp'' without it. The form ''saizlēp'', with [[Verner's law|Verner-law]] alternation, is occasionally found as well, but it was apparently a relic formation with no other examples of alternation elsewhere.

====Northwest Germanic====

In the Northwest Germanic languages, which include all modern surviving Germanic languages, class 7 was drastically remodelled. Reduplication was almost eliminated, except for a few relics, and new ablaut patterns were introduced. Many attempts were made to explain this development. [[Jay Jasanoff|Jasanoff]] posits the following series of events within the history of Northwest Germanic:&lt;ref name="Jasanoff 2008"/&gt;

# Root-initial consonant clusters were transferred to the beginning of the reduplicating syllable, to preserve the same word onset across the paradigm. The clusters were simplified and reduced medially. (Compare Latin ''scindō'' ~ ''scicidī'' and ''spondeō'' ~ ''spopondī'', which show the same development)
#: *hlaupaną: *'''h'''e'''hl'''aup, *'''h'''e'''hl'''upun  &gt; *'''hl'''e'''l'''aup, *'''hl'''e'''l'''upun
#: *stautaną: *'''st'''e'''st'''aut, *'''st'''e'''st'''utun  &gt; *'''st'''e'''z'''aut, *'''st'''e'''z'''utun
#: *blōtaną: *'''b'''e'''bl'''ōt, *'''b'''e'''bl'''utun &gt; *'''bl'''e'''l'''ōt, *'''bl'''e'''l'''utun
#: *grōaną: *'''g'''e'''gr'''ō, *'''g'''e'''gr'''ōun &gt; *'''gr'''e'''r'''ō, *'''gr'''e'''r'''ōun
#: *swōganą: *'''s'''e'''zw'''ōg, *'''s'''e'''zw'''ōgun &gt; *'''sw'''e'''w'''ōg, *'''sw'''e'''u'''gun (English {{wikt-lang|en|sough}})
# Root compression:
## Based on the pattern of verbs such as singular *''lelōt'', *''rerōd'' ~ plural *''leltun'', *''rerdun'', as well as verbs like singular *''swewōg'' ~ plural *''sweugun'', the root vowel or diphthong was deleted in the past plural stem. The [[Germanic spirant law]] caused devoicing in certain consonants where applicable.
##: *haitaną: *hegait, *hegitun &gt; *hegait, *hehtun
##: *bautaną: *bebaut, *bebutun &gt; *bebaut, *beftun ("to {{wikt-lang|en|beat|i=-}}")
##: *hlaupaną: *hlelaup, *hlelupun &gt; *hlelaup, *hlelpun
##: *stautaną: *stezaut, *stezutun &gt; *stezaut, *stestun
##: *blōtaną: *blelōt, *blelutun &gt; *blelōt, *bleltun
## In class 7c verbs, this resulted in consonant clusters that were not permissible (e.g. **''hegldun''); these clusters were simplified by dropping the root-initial consonant(s).
##: *haldaną: *hegald, *heguldun &gt; *hegald, *heldun
##: *fanhaną: *febanh, *febungun &gt; *febanh, *fengun
# The present plural stem of class 7c verbs no longer appeared to be reduplicated because of the above change, and was extended to the singular. This created what appeared to be a new form of ablaut, with ''a'' in the present and ''e'' in the past plural.
#: *haldaną: *hegald, *heldun &gt; *held, *heldun
#: *fanhaną: *febanh, *fengun &gt; *feng, *fengun
# This new form of ablaut was then extended to other classes, by alternating *a with *e in classes 7a and 7b, and *ā with *ē in class 7d (after Proto-Germanic *ē had become *ā in Northwest Germanic). In class 7a, this resulted in the vowel *ei, which soon merged with *ē (from Germanic *ē&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).
#: *haitaną: *hegait, *hehtun &gt; *heit, *heitun &gt; *hēt, *hētun
#: *hlaupaną: *hlelaup, *hlelpun &gt; *hleup, *hleupun
#: *lātaną: *lelōt, *leltun &gt; *lēt, *lētun
# It is at this point that North and West Germanic begin to diverge.
#* In West Germanic, class 7e took *eu as the past stem vowel, by analogy with existing verbs with initial *(s)w- such as *wōpijaną, *weup(un) and *swōganą, *swewg(un).
#*: *blōtaną: *blelōt(un) &gt; *bleut(un)
#*: *hrōpaną: *hrerōp(un) &gt; *hreup(un) ("to cry, {{wikt-lang|en|roop|i=-}}")
#*: *grōaną: *grerō(un) &gt; *greu, *gre(u)wun
#* In North Germanic, class 7e instead took *ē as the past stem vowel, probably by analogy with class 7c which also had a long stem vowel.
#*: *blōtaną: *blelōt(un) &gt; *blēt(un)

Stages 4 and 5 were not quite complete by the time of the earliest written records. While most class 7 verbs had replaced reduplication with ablaut entirely, several vestigial remains of reduplication are found throughout the North and West Germanic languages. Various other changes occurred later in the individual languages. *e in class 7c was replaced by *ē (&gt; ia) in Old High German and Old Dutch, but by *eu (&gt; ēo) in Old English.

The following "Late Proto-Northwest-Germanic" can be reconstructed as descendants of the earlier Proto-Germanic forms given above. Note that ē became ā in Northwest Germanic.

==Proto-Germanic==
The Proto-Germanic language most likely used more than 500 strong roots. Although some roots are speculative, the language can be reconstructed with the following strong roots based on the work of Elmar Seebold (1970), Robert Mailhammer (2007) and Guus Kroonen (2013).
Proto-Germanic had aorist-present roots, a remnant of the [[aorist aspect]] found in [[Proto-Indo-European]]. These verbs used the former aorist as a present tense form. The aorist had a zero-grade vowel, like parts 3 and 4 of the perfect. So these verbs have an anomalous vowel in the present tense, they decline regularly otherwise.

==Gothic==

Being the oldest Germanic language with any significant literature, it is not surprising that Gothic preserves the strong verbs best. However, some changes still occurred:

* ''e'' &gt; ''i'', eliminating the distinction between the two vowels, except in the reduplicated syllable where ''e'' (spelled {{angbr|ai}}) was retained in all cases.
* ''i'' &gt; ''e'' (spelled {{angbr|''ai''}}) and  ''u'' &gt; ''o'' (spelled {{angbr|''au''}}) when followed by ''r'', ''h'' or ''ƕ''.
* Consonant alternations are almost entirely eliminated by generalising the voiceless alternant across all forms.

Also, long ''ī'' was spelled {{angbr|''ei''}} in Gothic.

==West Germanic==

Changes that occurred in the West Germanic languages:

* ē &gt; ā
* [[a-mutation]]: ''u'' &gt; ''o'' when ''a'' follows in the next syllable. This affected the past participles of classes 2-4. However, an intervening ''m'' or ''n'' + consonant blocked this, so the past participle of class 3a kept ''u''.
* Extension of umlaut to back vowels, causing it to apply also to verbs of class 6.
* The perfective prefix ''ga-'' came to be used (but neither exclusively nor invariably) as a marker of the participle. In English this prefix disappeared again in the Middle Ages.

===Old English===

The following changes occurred from West Germanic to '''Old English''':
* ''ai'' &gt; ''ā''
* ''eu'' &gt; ''ēo''
* ''au'' &gt; ''ēa''
* ''a'' &gt; ''æ'' except when a back vowel followed in the next syllable
* ''ā'' &gt; ''ǣ''
* [[Breaking (linguistics)|Breaking]] before certain consonants: ''æ'' &gt; ''ea'' and ''e'' &gt; ''eo''
* West Saxon Palatalisation: ''i &gt; ie'' after ''g''

The following are the paradigms for Old English:

With j-presents (and other anomalies):

* ''{{wt|ang|scieppan}} scōp scōpon scapen'' ("to create, shape")
* ''{{wt|ang|swerian}} swōr swōron sworen'' ("to swear")
The verb "to stand" follows class 6, but has an anomalous loss of its ''-n-'' in the past:
* ''{{wt|ang|standan}} stōd stōdon standen''
Some relics of class 7 reduplication remain in Old English, mostly in texts from Anglia (infinitive and past singular shown):
* ''bēatan beoft'' ("to beat")
* ''hātan hēht'' ("to call")
* ''lācan leolc'' ("to move about, leap")
* ''lǣtan leort'' ("to let")
* ''on-drǣdan on-dreord'' ("to dread")
* ''rēdan reord'' ("to advise")
* ''spātan speoft'' ("to spit")

Changes that occurred from Old English to '''Modern English''':

* ā &gt; ō
* [[Great Vowel Shift]]
* The old second-person singular ("thou") form acquires the ending "-st" in the past, but the second-person singular falls out of common use and is replaced with the second-person plural.
* Elimination of almost all verb inflection in strong verbs, except for the third-person singular present ending ''-s'' (and the second-person ending "-(e)st", when used).
* Either the past singular form or the past plural form is generalised to the other number. As a result, only one form exists for all past tense forms and parts 2 and 3 are no longer distinguished.
* Combined with the above, all consonant alternations are eliminated by generalising the consonant of the present. Only ''be'' preserves the alternation: ''wa'''s''''' versus ''we'''r'''e''.

In Modern English, generally speaking, the verb classes have disintegrated and are not easily recognisable.
&lt;br&gt;For the principal parts of all English strong verbs see: 
''[[wikt:Appendix:Irregular verbs:English|Wiktionary appendix: Irregular English verbs]]''.

====Class 1====
Class 1 is still recognisable, as in most other Germanic languages. The modern past is taken from either the old past singular (''ride rode ridden'') or the old past plural (''bite bit bitten''). In the case of ''shine shone shone'', the past participle has also assimilated to the past singular.

Class 1 verbs in modern English (excluding derived verbs such as ''abide'' and ''override'') are ''bide, bite, chide, drive, hide, ride, rise, rive, shine, shit/shite, shrive, slide, smite, stride, strike, strive, thrive, write''.

However, although most of these verbs have uniformity in their infinitive vowel, they no longer form a coherent class in further inflected forms – for example, ''bite'' (''bit, bitten''), ''ride'' (''rode, ridden''), ''shine'' (''shone, shone''), and ''strike'' (''struck, struck/stricken'', with ''struck'' and ''stricken'' used in different meanings) all show different patterns from one another – but ''bide, drive, ride, rise, smite, stride, strive, write'' do form a (more or less) coherent subclass. Most of these verbs are descended from Old English class 1 verbs. However:
*''strive'' is a French loan-word which is class 1 by analogy to ''drive''. (By coincidence it is ultimately descended from an [[Frankish language|Old Frankish]] class 1 verb.)
*''thrive'' is a class 1 verb formed by analogy to ''drive'', its Old English ancestor being weak and descended from Old Norse ''þrífa'' (itself a class 1 strong verb, meaning "to grasp").
*''hide'' is a class 1 verb whose Old English ancestor, ''hȳdan'', was weak.

In American English, the past tense of the verb ''dive'' is usually ''dove'', as though it is in Class 1, but the past participle is still ''dived''.

====Class 2====
Class 2 has become a small group and has become rather irregular. It includes ''choose, cleave, fly, freeze'' and ''shoot'' (whose usual passive participle is ''shot'' rather than {{wikt-lang|en|shotten}}). The verb ''bid'' (in the sense of "to offer") was in Class 2, but now the past and past participle are ''bid''. The obsolete verb {{wikt-lang|en|forlese}} is now used only as the passive participle ''forlorn''. This group does not form a coherent class, as each verb has different irregularities from each other verb.

====Class 3====
Class 3 in English is still fairly large and regular. The past is formed either from the old past singular or from the past plural. Many of the verbs have two past forms, one of which may be dialectal or archaic (''begin, drink, ring, shrink, sing, slink, spin, spring, stink, swing, swim'' and ''wring''). However, there are some anomalies. The class 3 verbs in modern English are:
*With nasal, normal past in ''a'': ''begin, drink, ring, run, shrink, sing, sink, spring, stink, swim, wring'' (''wring'' may have either past form)
*With nasal, normal past in ''u'' or ''ou'': ''bind, cling, find, fling, grind, sling, slink, spin, sting, string, swing, win, wind, wring''
*With ll: ''swell'' (but past is now ''swelled'')
*With original "Germanic ''h''": ''fight''
English ''fling'' does not go back to Old English, and may be a loan-word from Norse. It seems to have adopted class 3 forms by analogy with ''cling'' etc. Similarly ''ring, string''.

====Class 4====
The verb ''come'' is anomalous in all the West Germanic languages because it originally began with ''qu-'', and the subsequent loss of the ''w'' sound coloured the vowel of the present stem.
*''{{wt|ang|cuman}} cymþ cōm cōmon cumen'' ("to come")
Also anomalous:
*''{{wt|ang|niman}} nimþ nōm nōmon numen'' ("to take")

In '''Modern English''', regular class 4 verbs have all kept the ''–n'' in the participle, though eliminating the medial ''e'' after ''r'', this class exhibits near homogeneity of vowel pattern:
*''break broke broken''
but several verbs have archaic preterites that preserve the "a" of Middle English (''bare, brake, gat, sware, tare'', and ''spake'' or [[Scots language|Scots]] ''spak''). The preterite of Middle English ''comen'' was either ''cam'' or ''com'' (or with ''-en'' in the plural).

Class 4 verbs in English (not including derivatives such as ''beget'') are ''bear, break, get, shear, speak, steal, swear, tear, tread, wake, weave''; and without the ''-n'' and of irregular vowel progression: ''come''. ''Get, speak, tread'' and ''weave'' were originally of class 5, whereas ''swear'' was originally class 6. ''Wake'' was also originally class 6, and in fact retains the "a" of the present tense – the preterite ''woke'' (Middle English ''wook'') only conforms to the modern class 4 preterite, not to the historic class 4 preterite in "a".

====Class 5====
In Modern English this group has lost all group cohesion.
*''eat ate eaten''
*''give gave given''
*''lie lay lain''
*''see saw seen''
*''sit sat sat''
Class 5 verbs in Modern English:
''bid'' (in the sense of "to command" or "to invite"), ''eat, forbid, give, lie'' (= lie down), ''see, sit''. The verb ''quethe'' is only used poetically now. ''Get, speak, tread'', and ''weave'', which come from Class 5 verbs, are now Class 4.

The verb ''{{wikt-lang|en|forbid}}'' comes from a Class 2 verb in Old English. The preterite can be ''forbad'' or ''forbade''

The preterite ''ate'' is pronounced "et" in some British dialects.

Although the verb ''to be'' is suppletive and highly irregular, its past follows the pattern of a class 5 strong verb, with [[grammatischer Wechsel]] (the alternation of "s" and "r" in "was" versus "were"), and has uniquely retained the singular/plural distinction of both ablaut grade and consonant in the modern languages. Old English: ''{{lang|ang|wæs/wǣron}}'', English: ''was/were''. For full paradigms and historical explanations see [[Indo-European copula]].

====Class 6====
Class 6 has disintegrated as well. The verbs ''shake'', ''take'' and ''forsake'' come closest to the original vowel sequence. The consonant anomaly in ''stand'' is still visible, and is extended to the participle.
*''shake shook shaken''
*''stand stood stood''
Class 6 verbs in modern English: ''draw, forsake, lade, shake, shape, shave, slay, stand, take''. The verb {{wikt-lang|en|heave}} is in this class when used in a nautical context. Like most other classes in Modern English, this class has lost cohesion and now forms principal parts according to many different patterns. Two preterites (''drew'' and ''slew'') are now spelled with "ew", which is similar in sound to the "oo" of the others that still use a strong form. ''Swear'' is now class 4. The adjective ''graven'' was originally a past participle of the now obsolete verb ''grave''. Note that ''lade, shape, shave, wax'' are now weak outside of their optionally strong past participle forms (''laden, shapen'', ''shaven'', and ''waxen'' respectively). ''Fare'' has archaic past tense ''fore'' and rare past participle ''faren'', but is normally weak now.

====Class 7====
In '''Modern English''' this class has lost its homogeneity:
*''fall fell fallen''
*''hang hung hung'' (Note that, in the transitive sense of hanging someone by the neck, ''hang'' usually has regular weak conjugation ''hanged'')
*''hold held held'' (the original past participle is preserved in the adjective ''beholden'')
*''throw threw thrown''
The following modern English verbs descend from class 7 verbs, and still retain strong-verb endings: ''beat, blow, fall, hew, grow, hang, hold, know, throw''. (''Hew'' can be a preterite or present, although the usual preterite is ''hewed''.) The verb ''let'' can be considered Class 7, though the past participle now lacks the ending ''-en''. The verbs ''mow'' and ''sow'' retain the strong-verb participles ''mown'' and ''sown'' but the preterites are now ''mowed'' and ''sowed''. (The verb ''sew'' was always weak, even though one can say ''sewn'' for the past participle.) Archaic English still retains the reduplicated form ''hight'' ("called", originally a past tense, usually with a passive meaning, but later also used as a passive participle). The verb ''crow'' was also in class 7, as in the [[King James Version]] "while he yet spake, the cock crew".

====Other====
A few English verbs have become "strong" but do not belong to any class:
*''dig, dug, dug''
*''dive, dove, dived'' (Only in American English. Like Class 1 in first two forms.)
*''sneak, snuck, snuck'' (Non-standard American English. ''Sneaked'' is also still used.)
*''spit, spat, spat'' (''Spit, spit, spit'' is also used.)
*''stick, stuck, stuck''
*''strike, struck, struck'' (''Strike'' is also Class 1 but with an unusual past: ''strike, struck, stricken''.)

===Dutch===

'''Old Dutch''' is attested only fragmentarily, so it is not easy to give forms for all classes. Hence, Middle Dutch is shown here in that role instead. The situation of Old Dutch generally resembled that of Old Saxon and Old High German in any case.

Changes from West Germanic to Old Dutch:
* ''ai'' &gt; ''ē'' (but sometimes ''ei'' is preserved)
* ''au'' &gt; ''ō''
* ''eu'' &gt; ''iu'' 
* ''ē'' &gt; ''ie''
* ''ō'' &gt; ''uo'' (later becomes {{IPA|/uə/}}, spelled &lt;oe&gt; in Middle Dutch)

From Old Dutch to '''Middle Dutch''':
* ''u'' &gt; ''o''
* ''ū'' &gt; ''ȳ'' (spelled &lt;uu&gt;)
* ''iu'' &gt; ''ȳ'' (northern dialects)
* ''iu'' &gt; ''io'' &gt; ''ie'' (southern dialects)
* Lengthening of vowels in open syllables: ''e'' &gt; ''ē'', ''o'' &gt; ''ō'', ''a'' &gt; ''ā'', although it continues to be written with a single vowel. ''i'' is lengthened to ''ē'', and short ''y'' (from umlaut of ''u'') to ''ue'' {{IPA|/øː/}}.
* Unlike most other languages, umlaut does not affect long vowels or diphthongs except in the eastern dialects.
* Because of the combined effect of the two above points, umlaut is eliminated as a factor in verb conjugation.

From Middle Dutch to '''Modern Dutch''':
* Diphthongisation of long high vowels: {{IPA|/iː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɛi/}}, {{IPA|/yː/}} &gt; {{IPA|/œy/}} (spelled &lt;ij&gt; and &lt;ui&gt;)
* Monophthongisation of opening diphthongs: {{IPA|/iə/}} &gt; {{IPA|/i/}}, {{IPA|/uə/}} &gt; {{IPA|/u/}} (still spelled &lt;ie&gt; and &lt;oe&gt;)

====Class 1====
This class is well preserved and has the most strong verbs.
: Regular class 1 roots:
:* Historically strong: ''bijten, blijken, blijven, drijven, '''ver'''dwijnen, glijden, grijpen, kijken, kijven, knijpen, krijgen, krijten, lijden, mijden, nijgen, nijpen, rijden, rijgen, rijten, rijven, rijzen, schijnen, schijten, schrijden, schrijven, slijpen, slijten, smijten, snijden, splijten, stijgen, strijden, strijken, (aan)tijgen, vijzen,  wijken, wijten, wrijten, wrijven, zijgen, zwijgen, '''be'''zwijken'';
:* Historically weak: ''hijgen, hijsen, krijsen, kwijten, lijken, prijzen, spijten, stijven, vrijen, wijzen, zijpen'';
:* Dialectically or Archaicly strong:'' drijten ''(Archaic)'', mijgen/ miegen ''(Archaic)'', pijpen ''(In the sense of playing a flute or bagpipe)'';
:* Three verbs with 'ei' have also joined this class by analogy, as 'ij' and 'ei' are pronounced the same: ''breien, '''uit'''scheiden, zeiken'';

====Class 2====
Class 2b has grown by moving older class 2a verbs into it. In most dialects the historical "eu" merged with "ū", as both developed into "ȳ" and later into "ui". For those dialects class 2a essentially merged into the 2b class. In the southern dialects "eu" merged with "io" which became modern day "ie". The modern Dutch language has been influenced by both dialects and thus preserves both classes, although the 2a class has considerably shrunk in size. 
: Regular class 2a roots: 
:* Historically strong: ''bieden, '''be'''driegen, '''ver'''drieten,  gieten, kiezen, klieven, liegen, '''ver'''liezen, '''ge'''nieten, rieken, schieten,   vlieden, vliegen, vlieten, vriezen, zieden''; 
: Regular class 2b roots:
:* Historically strong: ''buigen, duiken, druipen, kluiven, kruipen, (ont)luiken, ruiken, schuiven, sluipen, sluiken, sluiten, snuiten, snuiven, spruiten, spuiten, stuiven, zuigen, zuipen'';
:* Historically weak: ''fluiten, pluizen, schuilen, wuiven''. 
:* Dialectically or Archaicly strong: ''fuiven ''(Flemish)'', gluipen ''(Informal)'', kruien ''(Archaic)'', ruilen ''(Southern dialects)'';
: Anomalous roots: 
:* The verb ''spugen'' can also be declined with a class 2 past tense and participle. 
:* The verb ''tijgen'' has a class 2 past tense and participle when it means 'to pull'.

====Class 3====
Class 3a and 3b have generalised part 3 to part 2, eliminating the ''-a-'' from this class. Some 3b verbs have a past in ''-ie-'' like class 7: ''helpen - hielp - geholpen''. This can be considered a new "class 3 + 7"
: Regular class 3a roots: 
:* Historically strong: ''binden, blinken, dingen, dringen, drinken, dwingen, '''be'''ginnen / '''ont'''ginnen, glimmen, klimmen, klinken, krimpen, schrikken, schrinken (rare), slinken, spinnen, springen, stinken, '''ver'''slinden, vinden, winden, winnen, wringen, zingen, zinken, zinnen, '''ver'''zwinden'';
: Regular class 3b roots:
:* Historically strong: ''bergen, delven, gelden, kerven, melken, schelden, smelten, vechten, vlechten, zwelgen, zwellen, zwelten'';
:* Three verbs of another class have joined with 3b: ''treffen'', ''trekken'' (both class 5)'', zwemmen'' (class 3a)
:* Historically weak: ''schenden, schenken,  zenden''; The verbs became strong by reinterpreting the [[Rückumlaut]] that was present in some Old and Middle Dutch weak verbs as a strong vowel alternation.
: Class 3 + 7 roots: ''(be)derven, helpen, sterven, werpen, werven, zwerven'';
: Anomalous roots:
:* The verb ''worden'' (to become) also belonged to class 3b, but the past and present vowels appear to have been swapped: ''worden werd geworden''.
:* Semi-strong with a weak past tense and a strong participle: ''barsten'', the verb changed the older vowels 'e' and 'o' into 'a': ''barsten - barstte - gebarsten''  

====Class 4====
Class 4 and 5 verbs still show the distinction in vowel between the past singular and plural, although this is not obvious due to the rules of [[Dutch orthography]]: ''ik nam'' ("I took") has the plural ''wij namen'' (not ''*nammen''), that is, the 'short' vowel {{IPA-nl|ɑ|}} of the singular is replaced by the 'long' {{IPA-nl|aː|}} in the plural. (Note the relationship of consonant doubling to vowel length, which is explained at [[Dutch orthography]]). The pattern is therefore: ''breken brak (braken) gebroken'' ("to break")
: Regular class 4 roots: 
:* Historically strong: ''breken, nemen, spreken, steken, stelen, '''be'''velen''; 
: Anomalous roots:
:* The present tense vowel of the verb ''komen'' was influenced by a preceding ''w'', which was subsequently lost. The etymological ''w'' is retained in the past, unlike English or German: ''komen - kwam - kwamen - gekomen''. 
:* The verbs ''scheren'', ''wegen'' and ''zweren'' ("to hurt, to sore") replaced the past tense vowel with that of the participle. Thus they decline with a long 'o' in the past tense.  
:* Semi-strong with a weak past tense and a strong participle: ''wreken, '''ver'''helen'' (''helen'' is a weak verb however);

====Class 5====
: Regular class 5 roots: 
:* Historically strong: ''eten, '''ver'''geten, geven, lezen, meten, '''ge'''nezen, treden, vreten''; 
: Anomalous roots: 
:* ''zien'' ("to see") has experienced a loss of the original {{IPA|/h/}}, with a resulting assimilation of the stem vowel to the vowel of the inflection, and shows Grammatischer Wechsel between this original {{IPA|/h/}} and a {{IPA|/g/}} in the past: ''zien zag zagen gezien''. 
:* The preterite of ''wezen/zijn'' ("to be") still shows both (quantitative) ablaut and grammatischer Wechsel between the singular and plural: ''was/waren''. 
:* Old j-presents are preserved: ''bidden, liggen, zitten''. These have a short 'i' in part 1 because of the gemination of the consonants, they retain the long 'e' vowel in part 4.
:* Semi-strong with a weak past tense and a strong participle: ''weven'';

====Class 6====
Class 6 has become very small, many of its verbs have gone weak or have become semi-strong. 
: Regular class 6 roots: 
:* Historically strong: ''dragen, graven, varen''. 
: Anomalous roots: 
:* The verb ''slaan'' (to hit) like the verb ''zien'' has experienced a loss of the original {{IPA|/h/}}, with a resulting assimilation of the stem vowel to the vowel of the inflection, and shows Grammatischer Wechsel between this original {{IPA|/h/}} and a {{IPA|/g/}} in the past: ''slaan - sloeg - sloegen - geslagen''. 
:* The suppleted past tense of the verb 'staan' (to stand) also belonged to this class, it now declines with a short 'o': ''staan - stond - stonden - gestaan'' 
:* The three inherited j-presents historically decline with 'e'-'oe'-'oe'-'a(a)'. In the modern language they decline irregularly, two have taken 'ie' in the past tense, all three have taken separate vowels in the participle: ''scheppen - schiep - geschapen'' ("to create"), ''heffen - hief - geheven'' ("to lift, raise"), ''zweren - zwoer - gezworen'' ("to swear an oath").
:* Semi-strong roots with a strong past tense and a weak participle: ''jagen, klagen'' (Flemish, colloquially)'', vragen, waaien''. 
:* Semi-strong roots with a weak past tense and a strong participle: ''lachen, laden, malen, varen'' ("to fare" The sense "to travel by boat" has a class 6 past ''voer'')

====Class 7====
Class 7 has shrunk in the modern language, like class 6 many of its verbs have become semi-strong. (The verbs with * are nowadays mostly semi-strong)
: Class 7a has disappeared. The verb ''heten'' ("to call") has become semi-strong. One relic still remains, but is now declined like a class 1 verb: ''uitscheiden'' - ''scheed uit'' - ''uitgescheden'' ("to secrete")
: Class 7b: ''lopen, stoten*'' 
: Class 7c: ''gaan, houden, houwen, vallen, hangen, vangen, wassen*''
:* One verb displays [[L-vocalization]]: ''houden - hield - gehouden'' ("to hold")
:* As in German, two anomalous class 7c verbs have formed new present stems, and shortened the vowel in the past tense: ''vangen - ving - gevangen'' ("to catch") and ''hangen - hing - gehangen'' ("to hang"). The suppleted past tense of the verb 'gaan' ("to go") also belongs to this class and is declined: ''gaan - ging - gegaan'' 
: Class 7d: ''blazen, slapen, laten, raden*''
: Class 7e: ''roepen''
: Semi-strong roots with a weak past tense and a strong participle: 
:* ''bakken, bannen, braden, brouwen, heten, raden, scheiden'' (''uitscheiden'' has the past ''scheed uit'')'', spannen, stoten, vouwen'' (the past had -ield-, like ''houden'')'', wassen, zouten'' (the past had -ielt-, like ''houden'')

====Other====
A special case is ''hoeven'', which is a weak verb that can decline a strong participle in some circumstances, even though the verb was never strong to begin with.

====Afrikaans====

The distinction between strong and weak verbs has been lost in [[Afrikaans]], as the original past tense has fallen out of use almost entirely, being replaced with the old perfect tense using the past participle. For example, the ancestral [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''hij zong'' has become ''hy het gesing'' ("he sang/has sung/had sung). One relic of a strong verbs remains, however: ''wees was gewees'' ("to be").

===German===

From West Germanic to '''Old High German''':
* [[High German consonant shift]]
* ''ē'' &gt; ''ia''
* ''ai'' &gt; ''ei'', then ''ei &gt; ē'' before ''r'', '' h'' and ''w''
* ''au'' &gt; ''ou'', then ''ou &gt; ō'' before dentals (''þ'', ''d'', ''t'', ''n'', ''l'', ''s'', ''z'', ''r'') and ''h''.
* ''e &gt; i'' before ''u''

* Class 1 has two subclasses, depending on the vowel in the past singular:
** 1a ''rītan rītu reit ritum giritan'' ("to ride")
** 1b ''līhan līhu lēh ligum giligan'' ("to loan" - note [[grammatischer Wechsel]].)
* Class 2b verbs are rare, unlike in the more northern languages.
* A few relics of reduplication remain:
** ''ana-stōzan ana-sterōz'' ("to strike")
** ''pluozan pleruzzun'' ("to sacrifice"), in Upper German with the change b &gt; p
** ''ki-scrōtan ki-screrōt'' ("to cut"), in Upper German with the change g &gt; k
** ''būan biruun'' ("to dwell"); this was not a class 7 strong verb originally

Changes from Old High German to '''Modern German''':
* ''io'', ''ia'', ''ie'' &gt; ''ī'' (spelled &lt;ie&gt;)
* ''ei, ī &gt; ai'' (retaining the spelling &lt;ei&gt;)
* ''ou, ū &gt; au''
* ''ȳ &gt; ɔy'' (spelled &lt;eu&gt; or &lt;äu&gt;)
* ''i &gt; ī'' (spelled &lt;ie&gt;) before a single consonant.
* Alternations between past singular and plural are eliminated by generalising part 3 or part 2. If part 3 is generalised in verbs with alternations of the ''s-r'' type, it is not just generalised to the past singular but also to the present.

The classes are still well preserved in modern German.

====Class 1====
In class 1, part 3 is generalised, eliminating the older ''-ei-'' or ''-e-''. However, a new subdivision arises because the ''i'' of the past tense forms is lengthened to ''ie'' before a single consonant. ''reiten ritt geritten'' ("to ride") versus ''leihen lieh geliehen'' ("to loan"). Class 1 verbs in modern German are:
* Class 1 with a long vowel in past tense and participle ('''aɪ̯-i:-i:''') : ''bleiben, gedeihen, leihen, meiden, reiben, scheiden, scheinen, schreiben, schreien, schweigen, speiben, speien, steigen, treiben, verzeihen, weisen'' (also the originally weak verb ''preisen'' by analogy).
* Class 1 with a short vowel in past tense and participle ('''aɪ̯-ɪ-ɪ''') : ''beißen, bleichen, gleichen, gleiten, greifen, leiden, pfeifen, reißen, reiten, scheißen, schleichen, schleifen, schleißen, schmeißen, schneiden, schreiten, spleißen, streichen, streiten, weichen'' (also the originally weak verb ''kneifen'' by analogy). 
The verbs ''leiden''and ''schneiden'' preserved the verner alternation: "lei'''d'''en - li'''tt''' - geli'''tt'''en, schnei'''d'''en - schni'''tt''' - geschni'''tt'''en".

====Class 2====
In class 2, part 2 is generalised, eliminating older ''-u-''. Class 2b verbs are rare, as in Old High German. 
* Class 2a with a long vowel in past tense and participle ('''i:-o:-o:''') : ''biegen, bieten, fliegen, fliehen, frieren, klieben, schieben, stieben, verlieren, wiegen, ziehen''. 
The verb ''ziehen'' has preserved the verner alternation: "zie'''h'''en - zo'''g''' - gezo'''g'''en"
* Class 2a with a short vowel in past tense and participle ('''i:-ɔ-ɔ''') : ''fließen, genießen, gießen, kriechen, riechen, schießen, schliefen, schließen, sieden, sprießen, triefen''. 
The verb ''sieden'' has preserved the verner alternation: "sie'''d'''en - so'''tt''' - geso'''tt'''en".
* Class 2b: ''saufen, saugen''.
* Two anomalous class 2 verbs in modern German are ''lügen'' ("to tell a lie") and ''trügen'' ("to deceive"). This no doubt arises from a desire to disambiguate Middle High German ''liegen'' from ''ligen'' (class 5), which would have sounded the same after vowel lengthening. ''Trügen'' would have followed in its wake, because the two words form a common rhyming collocation.

====Class 3====
In class 3, part 2 is generalised. The ''o'' of the 3b participle has been passed by analogy to some 3a verbs, and also to the past of some verbs of both groups: ''beginnen begann begonnen'', ''bergen barg geborgen'' ("to rescue"), ''quellen quoll gequollen'' ("to well up"). Thus, there are now 5 subgroups:
* 3a regular ('''ɪ-a-ʊ''') : ''binden, dringen, finden, gelingen, klingen, ringen, schlingen, schwinden, schwingen, singen, sinken, springen, stinken, trinken, winden, wringen, zwingen''.
* 3a with substitution of o in participle ('''ɪ-a-ɔ''') : ''beginnen, gewinnen, rinnen, schwimmen, sinnen, spinnen''.
* 3a with substitution of o in preterite and participle ('''ɪ-ɔ-ɔ''') : ''glimmen, klimmen''.
* 3b regular ('''ɛ-a-ɔ''') : ''bergen; bersten, gelten, helfen, schelten, sterben, verderben, werben, werden, werfen''.
* 3b with substitution of o in preterite ('''ɛ-ɔ-ɔ''') : ''dreschen, fechten, flechten, melken, quellen, schmelzen, schwellen''.

====Class 4====
In class 4, part 2 is generalised, eliminating older ''-u-'' here also. Example: ''nehmen nahm genommen'' ("to take").
* Class 4 with long vowels in present tense ('''eː-a:-o:''') : ''befehlen, gebären, stehlen''. 
* Class 4 with long vowels and substitution with o in preterite ('''eː-o:-o:''') : ''scheren''. 
* Class 4 with a long vowel in present tense and short in the participle ('''eː-a:-ɔ''') : ''nehmen''.
* Class 4 with short vowels in present tense and participle ('''ɛ-a:-ɔ''') : ''brechen, schrecken, sprechen, stechen, treffen''.
* Anomalous: ''kommen'' ("to come") still has the anomalous ''o'' in the present stem (although some dialects have regularised it to ''kemmen''): ''kommen kam gekommen''
* The preterite of ''sein'' ("to be") is Old High German: ''was/wârum'', but levelled in modern German: ''war/waren''.

====Class 5====
Class 5 is little changed from Old High German. 
* Class 5 with long vowels in present tense and participle ('''eː-a:-e:''') : ''geben, genesen, geschehen, lesen, sehen, treten''. 
* Class 5 with short vowels in present tense and participle ('''ɛ-a:-ɛ''') : ''essen, messen, vergessen''. 
: The verb ''essen'' ("to eat") had a past participle ''giezzan'' in OHG; in MHG this became ''geezzen'' which was contracted to ''gezzen'' and then re-prefixed to ''gegezzen''.
* j-presents: ''bitten, liegen, sitzen''. 

====Class 6====
Class 6 is also preserved. In Modern German the ''uo'' is monophthongised to ''u''.
* Class 6 with long vowels in present tense and participle ('''aː-u:-a:''') : ''fahren, fragen, graben, laden, schlagen, tragen''.
* Class 6 with short vowels in present tense and participle ('''a-u:-a''') : ''backen, schaffen, wachsen, waschen''.
: ''backen'' and ''fragen'' are usually weak nowadays.
* The j-presents ''heben, schwören'' have taken an ''o'' in the preterite and participle, perhaps by analogy with class 2: ''heben hob gehoben''. The verb ''schwören'' has changed ''e'' to ''ö''. 
* The past tense and participle of ''stehen'' (''stand'', older ''stund'', ''gestanden''), which derive from a lost verb ''*standen'', also belong to this class.

====Class 7====
In class 7, the various past tense vowels have merged into a single uniform ''-{{sic|i|e|hide=y}}-''. Two verbs have back-formed new present stems from the past stem, and have eliminated ''grammatischer Wechsel'' and shortened the vowel in the past tense: ''fangen fing gefangen'' ("to catch"), ''hängen hing gehangen'' ("to hang")
* Class 7 verbs in modern German are: ''blasen, braten, fallen, halten, heißen, lassen, laufen, raten, rufen, schlafen, stoßen''; 
* Anomalous: ''fangen, hängen''.
* The past tense and participle of German ''gehen'', ''ging'' ''gegangen'', derive from a lost verb ''*gangen'' which belongs to this class. (The verb still exists in other languages, such as the verb ''gang'' used in Scotland and northern England.)

=== Low German ===

The following changes occurred from West Germanic to Old Saxon:
* ''ai'' &gt; ''ē'' 
* ''au'' &gt; ''ō''
* ''eu'' &gt; ''io''

From Old Saxon to Middle Low German:
* ''u'' &gt; ''o''
* ''io'' &gt; ''e''
As in Middle Dutch Lengthening of vowels in open syllables: ''e'' &gt; ''ē'', ''o'' &gt; ''ō'', ''a'' &gt; ''ā'', ''ö'' &gt; ''ȫ'', ü &gt; ''ǖ''. ''i'' Is often lengthened to ''ē''.

{{cleanup|reason=name references, sources.
There is no single Modern Low German, and some sources gives different forms than this. E.g. see
* Alfred v. d. Velde: ''Zu Fritz Reuter! Praktische Anleitung zum Verständniß des Plattdeutschen an der Hand des ersten Kapitels des Fritz Reuter'schen Romanes: "Ut mine Stromtid". Zweite Auflage.'' Leipzig, 1881, p. 60-63
* Julius Wiggers: ''Grammatik der plattdeutschen Sprache. In Grundlage der Mecklenburgisch-Vorpommerschen Mundart. Zweite Auflage.'' Hamburg, 1858, p. 57 ff.
Some differences:
* They have ''böd, böden'' instead of ''bood, boden'', ''föll, föllen'' instead of ''full, fullen'', ''stürw, stürwen, storwen'' instead of ''storv, storven, storven''.
* They have ''spreken'' with ''sprök'' (thus not "4 regular (e-o-a)")
|date=June 2016}}
From Middle Low German to Modern Low German:
* ''ā'' &gt; ''ē''
* ''ō'' &gt; ''ā'' except before ''r''
* ''a'' &gt; ''o'' in preterite forms
* ''e'' &gt; ''a''/''ö'' when followed by two different consonants

Most classes are quite well preserved, although the cohesion of some has been lost substantially or even entirely.
* Class 1 verbs in Low German are ''bieten, blieven, blieken, diegen/diehen, drieven, glieden, griepen, kieken, lieden, lieken, mieden, rieten, schienen, schieten, schrieden, schrien/schriegen, schrieven, slieken, sliepen, slieten, smieten, snieden, splieten, stiegen, strieden, strieken, swiegen, verdwienen, wieken, wiesen, wrieven'' and the originally weak verbs ''glieken'', ''kniepen'', ''priesen'' by analogy. Some other verbs take either strong or weak past endings: ''piepen'', ''riesen'' and ''spieten''.
* In class 2, part 2 is generalised, eliminating older -u-. Unlike in German but as in Dutch and English, class 2b has grown by moving older class 2a verbs into it. They are ''beden, bedregen, kesen, legen, flegen, fleten, freren/fresen, geneten, geten, krepen, reken, scheten, spreten, tehn, verleren/verlesen''; with ū-present: ''bugen, krupen, schuven, snuven, sluten, supen, sugen, stuven''. The verbs ''rüken'' and ''stöven'' show anomalous infinitive forms. Some verbs can take either strong or weak past endings: ''duken'' and ''schulen''.
* In class 3, the form of the past participle seems to have been generalised to preterite forms. There are now 5 subgroups + two olders subgroups reduced to one verb each:
** 3a regular (i-u-u): ''binnen, dringen, drinken, dwingen, finnen, gelingen, klingen, ringen, slingen, swinnen, swingen, singen, sinken, springen, stinken, wringen''. Verbs that may take either strong or weak past endings: ''blinken, glimmen'' and ''klimmen''.
** 3a with ü-infinitive (ü-u-u): ''begünnen, swümmen''
** 3b regular (a-o-o): ''bargen, basten/barsten, starven, verdarven, warpen, warrn, warven''
** 3b with ö-infinitive (ö-o-o): ''hölpen, smölten''
** 3b with e-infinitive and -u- past forms because of phonetical influence of -ll- (e-u-u): ''gellen, schellen, swellen''
** 3b with e-infinitive (e-o-o): ''fechten''
** 3b with e-infinitive and different preterite and past participle forms (e-o-a) due to analogy with class 4 verbs: ''befehlen''.
* In class 4, parts 2 and 3 seem to have merged into -ē-, but due to the influence of past participle forms mostly with a -ō- sound (nowadays written -ā-) a new ending -ō- has arisen:
** 4 regular (e-o-a): ''breken, schrecken'' (with vowel lengthening: ''schrook, schraken''), spreken, stehlen''.
** 4 with two possible preterite forms (e-o/e-a): ''nehmen, steken''
** 4 with a-infinitive (a-o-a): ''drapen''
:The verb ''kamen'' still shows the -u- infinitive which became -a-: ''kamen, keem, kamen''. The verb to be, ''wesen'', levelled its old preterite forms ''was''/''weren'' into ''weer''/''weren'', although ''was'' still appears in some dialects.
* In class 5 too the -ē- forms of past participle seem to have influenced the preterite forms. Class 5 regular verbs (ē-ē-ē) include: ''eten, geven, schehn'' (preterite ''scheh'' or ''scheeg'')'', lesen'' (nowadays mostly a weak verb)'', meten, sehn'' (preterite ''seeg'') ''and vergeten''. Verbs with j-presents: ''bidden'' (sometimes confused with ''beden'')'', liggen, sitten''.
:The verb ''treden'' is anomalous as it has kept the -a- infinitive forms in the preterite and with the variation in vowel length, thus it has ''tradd'', ''traddst'', ''tradd'' in the singular with  {{IPA-de|a|}} but ''traden'' in the plural with {{IPA-de|ɒː|}}. However, normal class 5 preterite forms ''treed, treedst, treed, treden'' may also be found.
* Class 6 is preserved as well however it has lost its cohesion. Regular class 6 verbs (ā-ō-ā) are ''graven'' and ''slaan'' (with anomalous infinitive and past participle ''slaan'' from earlier ''slagen''). The 3 inherited j-presents have chosen differents paths to make their past forms: ''heven'' is now similar to a class 5 verb and has ''heev'' in the preterite and ''heven'' in the past participle, ''schapen'' is a weak verb with strong past participle ''schapen'' and ''swören'' kept its preterite ''swoor'' as well as its past participle ''sworen'' - even though it may found with weak past forms.
:The verb ''fohren'' is now merging with ''föhren'' and takes weak past endings. The verb ''dregen'' has an anomalous infinitive in -ē- but has kept its class 6 past forms ''droog'', ''drogen'' (preterite) and ''dragen'' (past participle). The verb laden has gone weak but has ''laden'' beside ''laadt'' in the past participle. The past tense of ''stahn'' (''stunn''), which derives from Middle Low German ''standen'', also belongs to this class.
:Finally the verb ''waschen'' shows preterite ''wusch'' and past participle ''wuschen'', just like ''fallen, fangen'' and ''hangen'', they seem to make a new strong verb class.
* In class 7, the various past tense forms have merged into a uniform -ee-. 
** 7a (ē-ē-ē) has one single verb: ''heten'' since ''scheden'' has gone weak. 
** 7b (ō-ē-ō) also includes one verb: ''lopen'', ''stoten'' has gone weak but it kept its strong past participle ''stoten''. 
** 7c has lost cohesion. 7c verb ''holen'' (from Old Saxon ''haldan'') has regular ''heel'' in the past tense and past participle ''holen'', but ''fallen, fangen, hangen'' and ''gahn'' (from Old Saxon ''gangan'') show ''full'' and ''fullen'', ''fung'' and ''fullen'', ''hung'' and ''hungen'', ''gung/güng'' (but past participle''gahn'') in the preterite and past participle, all with a short -u-. Class 6 verb ''waschen'' has also joined this "new class" and has preterite and past participle ''wusch'' and ''wuschen''. 
** 7d (ā-ē-ā) verbs include: ''laten'' and ''slapen'', ''raden'' and ''braden'' are semi-strong as they still have their strong past participles ''raden'' and ''braden'' (though a weak form ''braadt'' may be encountered). ''Blasen'' has gone weak.
** 7e (ō-ē-ō) is reduced to one single verb: ''ropen''. This subgroup had become similar to 7b already in Old Saxon.

==North Germanic==

Changes from Proto-Germanic to '''[[Old Norse]]''':
* ē &gt; ā
* [[a-mutation]]: ''u'' &gt; ''o'' when ''a'' follows in the next syllable. This affected the past participles of classes 2-4. However, an intervening ''m'' or ''n'' + consonant blocked this, so the past participle of class 3a kept ''u''.
* Extension of umlaut to back vowels, causing it to apply also to verbs of class 6.
* ''v-'' is lost before ''u'' or ''o''.
* ''-n'' is lost from the infinitive and many inflectional endings.
* Voiced plosives (but not fricatives) are devoiced word-finally. In Old West Norse, this later causes loss of a preceding nasal.
* Breaking of ''e'' to ''ja'' in most environments, and of ''eu'' to ''jū''/''jō''.

'''Kimchi''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɪ|m|tʃ|iː}}; {{lang-ko|김치|gimchi}}, {{IPA-ko|kim.tɕʰi|IPA}}), a staple in [[Korean cuisine]], is a traditional [[banchan|side dish]] made from salted and [[Fermentation in food processing|fermented]] vegetables, most commonly [[napa cabbage]] and [[Korean radish]]es, with a variety of seasonings, including ''[[gochugaru]]'' (chili powder), [[scallion]]s, [[garlic]], [[ginger]], and ''[[jeotgal]]'' (salted seafood).&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/kimchi|title=Kimchi|date=1 October 2008|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chin"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.saveur.com/article/Kitchen/The-Art-of-Kimchi|title=The Art of Kimchi|last=Chin|first=Mei|date=14 October 2009|work=[[Saveur]]|access-date=9 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are hundreds of varieties of kimchi made with different vegetables as the main ingredients.&lt;ref name="McAninch"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.saveur.com/article/Kitchen/A-World-of-Kimchi|title=A World of Kimchi|last=McAninch|first=David|date=14 October 2009|work=[[Saveur]]|access-date=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pettid"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wzJ7_WcLJSwC&amp;pg=PA47|title=Korean Cuisine: An Illustrated History|last=Pettid|first=Michael J.|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]|year=2008|isbn=978-1-86189-348-2|location=London|pages=47–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, kimchi was traditionally stored underground in jars to keep cool during warm months, and remain unfrozen throughout the winter months, during which time it was a vital source of vegetables.&lt;ref name="Chin" /&gt; With the rise of technology, [[kimchi refrigerators]] are more commonly used to store kimchi.

== Etymology ==

=== ''Ji'' ===
The term ''ji'' ({{lang|ko|지}}), which has its origins in archaic Korean ''dihi'' ({{lang|ko|디히}}), has been used to refer to kimchi since ancient times.&lt;ref name="Lee"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/opinion/column/125949.html|title=[고장말탐험] ‘김치’와 ‘지’|last=이|first=태영|date=23 May 2006|work=[[The Hankyoreh]]|access-date=27 March 2017|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[sound change]] can be roughly described as:&lt;ref name="Hong_G"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hong|first=Giok|year=2016|title=Study on the Lexicon Related to Gimchi: Based on Survey of Ethnic Living Words in 2008|url=http://scholar.dkyobobook.co.kr/searchExtDetail.laf?barcode=4010025044040&amp;vendorGb=01&amp;academyCd=20198|journal=The Journal of Korean Dialectology|volume=24|issue=24|pages=61–99|doi=10.19069/kordialect.2016.24.061|issn=1738-8686|via=[[Kyobo Scholar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Gimchi'' ===
''Gimchi'' ({{lang|ko|김치}}) is the accepted word in both [[North Korean standard language|North]] and [[South Korean standard language|South Korean]] standard languages. Earlier forms of the word include ''timchɑi'' ({{script/Korean|{{lang|ko|팀}}}}), a [[Middle Korean]] transcription of the [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] word {{lang|ko-Hant|[[wikt:沈|沈]][[wikt:菜|菜]]}} (literally "submerged vegetable").

The [[Aspirated consonant|aspirated]] first consonant of ''timchɑi'' became unaspirated in ''dimchɑi'', then underwent [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] in ''jimchɑi''. The word then became ''jimchui'' with the loss of the vowel ''ɑ'' ({{script/Korean|{{lang|ko|ㆍ}}}}) in Korean language, then ''gimchi'', with the depalatalized word-initial consonant. In Modern Korean, the [[hanja]] characters {{lang|ko-Hant|沈菜}} are pronounced ''chimchae'' ({{lang|ko|침채}}), and are not used to refer to kimchi, or anything else. The word ''gimchi'' is not considered as a [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean word]].&lt;ref name=SKLD /&gt;&lt;!-- The headword in Standard Korean Language dictionary dose not contain hanja characters.--&gt; Older forms of the word are retained in many regional dialects: ''jimchae'' (Jeolla, [[Hamgyŏng dialect]]s),&lt;ref name="SKLD_jimchae"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stdweb2.korean.go.kr/search/View.jsp?idx=317715|title=jimchae|website=[[Standard Korean Language Dictionary]]|publisher=[[National Institute of Korean Language]]|language=ko|script-title=ko:짐채|access-date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''jimchi'' ([[Chungcheong dialect|Chungcheong]], [[Gangwon dialect|Gangwon]], [[Gyeonggi dialect|Gyeonggi]], Gyeongsang, Hamgyŏng, Jeolla dialects),&lt;ref name="SKLD_jimchi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stdweb2.korean.go.kr/search/View.jsp?idx=317716|title=jimchi|website=[[Standard Korean Language Dictionary]]|publisher=[[National Institute of Korean Language]]|language=ko|script-title=ko:짐치|access-date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''dimchi'' (P'yŏngan dialect).&lt;ref name="SKLD_dimchi"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stdweb2.korean.go.kr/search/View.jsp?idx=96720|title=dimchi|website=[[Standard Korean Language Dictionary]]|publisher=[[National Institute of Korean Language]]|language=ko|script-title=ko:딤치|access-date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English word "kimchi" perhaps originated from ''kimch'i'', the [[McCune–Reischauer]] transcription of the Korean word ''gimchi'' ({{lang|ko|김치}}).

== History ==
The origin of kimchi dates back at least to the early period of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] (37 BC‒7 AD).&lt;ref name="Bayor"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YN9jC2_7UHYC&amp;pg=PA1349|title=Multicultural America: An Encyclopedia of the Newest Americans|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|year=2011|isbn=9780313357862|editor-last=Bayor|editor-first=Ronald H.|location=Santa Barbara, CA|pages=1349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fermented foods were widely available, as the ''[[Records of the Three Kingdoms]]'', a [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Chinese]] historical text published in 289 AD, mentions that "The ''[[Goguryeo]]'' people [referring to the Korean people] are skilled in making fermented foods such as wine, soybean paste, and salted and fermented fish" in the section named ''[[Dongyi]]'' in the ''[[Book of Wei]]''.&lt;ref name="Hui"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dVpQVJ46C5gC&amp;pg=PA190|title=Handbook of Vegetable Preservation and Processing|publisher=[[Marcel Dekker]]|year=2004|isbn=978-0824743017|editor-last=Hui|editor-first=Y.

The pickling of vegetables was an ideal method, prior to refrigerators, that helped to preserve the lifespan of foods.

[[File:Korean.Folk.Village-Minsokchon-02.jpg|thumb|Drying chili peppers for kimchi]]
Kimchi varieties are determined by the main vegetable ingredients and the mix of seasoning used to flavor the kimchi.

=== Vegetables ===

Cabbages ([[napa cabbage]]s, [[bomdong]], [[headed cabbage]]s) and radishes ([[Korean radish]]es, [[ponytail radish]]es, [[gegeol radish]]es, [[yeolmu radish]]es) are the most commonly used kimchi vegetables.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/kimchi|title=Kimchi|date=1 October 2008|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|access-date=23 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chin" /&gt; Other kimchi vegetables include: [[chamchwi|aster]], [[doraji|balloon flower root]]s, [[ueong|burdock]] roots, [[celery]], [[chamnamul]], [[cilantro]], [[garden cress|cress]], [[crown daisy greens]], [[cucumber]], [[eggplant]], [[garlic chives]], [[garlic]] scapes, [[ginger]], [[Korean angelica-tree]] shoots, [[Korean parsley]], [[Korean wild chive]], [[lotus root]]s, [[mustard greens]], onions, [[Kkaennip|perilla leaves]], potatoes, [[Cucurbita moschata|pumpkin]]s, [[mucheong|radish greens]], [[rapeseed]] leaves, [[Allium × proliferum|scallion]]s, [[soybean sprout]]s, [[spinach]], [[sugar beet]]s, [[sweet potato]] vines, and [[tomato]]es.&lt;ref name="KAC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cooks.org.kp/cooking_house.php?tID=9&amp;cID=1|title=Kimchi, sikhae|website=[[Ch'osŏn Ryori]]|publisher=[[Korean Association of Cooks]]|language=ko-KP|script-title=ko:김치, 식해|access-date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seasonings ===

[[Brining salt]] (with a larger grain size compared to [[kitchen salt]]) is used mainly for initial salting of kimchi vegetables. Being minimally processed, it serves to help develop flavours in fermented foods.&lt;ref name="Parks"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://modernfarmer.com/2014/12/shaking-salt/|title=Shaking Up Salt|last=Parks|first=Cara|date=16 December 2014|newspaper=Modern Farmer|access-date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly used seasonings include ''[[gochugaru]]'' (chili powder), [[scallion]]s, [[garlic]]s, [[ginger]], and ''[[jeotgal]]'' (salted seafood)&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chin" /&gt; ''Jeotgal'' can be replaced with raw seafood in colder Northern parts of the [[Korean peninsula]].&lt;ref name="Doo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&amp;MAS_IDX=101013000729133|title=kimchi|website=[[Doopedia]]|publisher=[[Doosan Corporation]]|script-title=ko:김치|access-date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; If used, milder ''[[saeu-jeot]]'' (salted shrimp) or ''[[jogi-jeot]]'' (salted croaker) is preferred and the amount of ''jeotgal'' is also reduced in Northern and Central regions.&lt;ref name="Doo" /&gt; In Southern Korea, on the other hand, generous amount of stronger ''[[myeolchi-jeot]]'' (salted anchovies) and ''[[galchi-jeot]]'' (salted [[Trichiurus lepturus|hairtail]]) is commonly used.&lt;ref name="Doo" /&gt; Raw seafood or ''[[daegu-agami-jeot]]'' (salted cod gills) are used in the East coast areas.&lt;ref name="Doo" /&gt;

Kimchi is a traditional Korean dish consisting of pickled vegetables, which is mainly served as a side dish with every meal, but also can be served as a main dish.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Tourism Organization. (2015). Kimchi.&lt;/ref&gt; Kimchi is mainly recognized as a spicy fermented cabbage dish globally.&lt;ref name="btpickle-201309"/&gt;  Variations are not limited, as Koreans "can make kimchi out of anything edible; a concept which extends toward infinite possibilities...."&lt;ref name="kimchi-types"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cured, Smoked, and Fermented: Proceedings of the Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery 2010|editor-last=Saberi |editor-first=Helen|year=2011 |chapter=Kimchi: Ferment at the Heart of Korean Cuisine, from Local Identity to Global Consumption |last=di Schino |first=June |publisher=Prospect Books|isbn=978-1-903018-85-9|location=Devon, UK |page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variations of kimchi continue to grow, and the taste can vary depending on the region and season &lt;ref&gt;Kimchi. (2016). Funk &amp; Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia, 1p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kimchi can be categorized by main ingredients, regions or seasons. Korea's northern and southern sections have a considerable temperature difference.&lt;ref name="yahookorea"&gt;[http://kr.dictionary.search.yahoo.com/search/dictionaryp?&amp;p=%EA%B9%80%EC%B9%98&amp;subtype=enc&amp;pk=11788300&amp;field=id "Kimchi." Yahoo Korean Encyclopedia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124003032/http://kr.dictionary.search.yahoo.com/search/dictionaryp |date=24 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are over 180 recognized varieties of kimchi.&lt;ref name="Korea Tourism Organization"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/SH/whatToBuy/whatToBuy.jsp?action=item&amp;cid=995700 |website=english.visitkorea.or.kr |title=Kimchi |accessdate=1 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common kimchi variations are
* ''[[Baechu-kimchi]]'' ({{lang|ko|배추김치}}) spicy napa cabbage kimchi, made from whole cabbage leaves
* ''baechu-geotjeori'' ({{lang|ko|배추겉절이}}) unfermented napa cabbage kimchi
* ''[[Bossam-kimchi]]'' ({{lang|ko|보쌈김치}}) wrapped kimchi
* ''[[Baek-kimchi]]'' ({{lang|ko|백김치}}) white kimchi, made without chili pepper
* ''[[Dongchimi]]'' ({{lang|ko|동치미}}) a non-spicy watery kimchi
* ''[[Nabak-kimchi]]'' ({{lang|ko|나박김치}}) a mildly spicy watery kimchi
* ''[[Chonggak-kimchi]]'' ({{lang|ko|총각김치}}) cubed [[chonggak radish|chonggak "ponytail" radish]], a popular spicy kimchi
* ''[[Kkakdugi]]'' ({{lang|ko|깍두기}}) spicy cubed [[Korean radish]] strongly-scented kimchi containing fermented shrimp
* ''[[Oi-sobagi]]'' ({{lang|ko|오이소박이}}) cucumber kimchi that can be stuffed with seafood and chili paste, and is a popular choice during the spring and summer seasons
* ''[[Pa-kimchi]]'' ({{lang|ko|파김치}}) spicy green onion kimchi
* ''[[Yeolmu-kimchi]]'' is also a popular choice during the spring and summer, and is made with [[yeolmu radish]]es, and does not necessarily have to be fermented.
* ''[[Gat-kimchi]]'', made with [[Indian mustard]]
Kimchi from the northern parts of Korea tends to have less salt and red chili and usually does not include brined seafood for seasoning. Northern kimchi often has a watery consistency. Kimchi made in the southern parts of Korea, such as [[Jeolla-do]] and [[Gyeongsang-do]], uses salt, chili peppers and ''[[myeolchijeot]]'' ({{lang|ko|멸치젓}}, brined [[anchovy]] allowed to ferment) or ''[[saeujeot]]'' ({{lang|ko|새우젓}}, brined shrimp allowed to ferment), ''myeolchiaekjeot'' ({{lang|ko|멸치액젓}}), ''kkanariaekjeot'' ({{lang|ko|까나리액젓}}), liquid anchovy [[jeot]], similar to [[fish sauce]] used in Southeast Asia, but thicker.

''[[Saeujeot]]'' ({{lang|ko|새우젓}}) or ''myeolchijeot'' is not added to the kimchi spice-seasoning mixture, but is simmered first to reduce odors, eliminate tannic flavor and fats, and then is mixed with a thickener made of rice or wheat starch ({{lang|ko|풀}}). This technique has been falling into disuse in the past 40 years.

=== Color ===
[[White kimchi]] are neither red in color nor spicy. It includes white [[Baechu-kimchi|napa cabbage kimchi]] and other varieties such as white [[Korean radish|radish]] kimchi (''[[dongchimi]]''). Watery white kimchi varieties are sometimes used as an ingredient in a number of dishes such as cold noodles in ''dongchimi'' [[brine]] (''dongchimi-guksu'').

=== Age ===
* ''[[Geotjeori]]'' ({{lang|ko|겉절이}}) are fresh, unfermented kimchi.
* ''[[Mugeun-ji]]'' ({{lang|ko|묵은지}}), also known as ''mugeun-kimchi'' ({{lang|ko|묵은김치}}), aged kimchi 

===Region===
[[File:Kimchi jar.JPG|thumb|Traditional [[onggi|jar]]s used for storing kimchi, gochujang, [[doenjang]], soy sauce and other pickled banchan]]
This regional classification dates back to 1960s and contains plenty of historical facts, but the current kimchi-making trends in Korea are generally different from those mentioned below.&lt;ref name="yahookorea"/&gt;
* ''[[Pyongan Province|Pyongan-do]]'' (North Korea, outside of Pyongyang) Non-traditional ingredients have been adapted in rural areas due to severe food shortages.
* ''[[Hamgyeong-do]]'' (Upper Northeast): Due to its proximity to the ocean, people in this particular region use fresh fish and oysters to season their kimchi.
* ''[[Hwanghae-do]]'' (Midwest): The taste of kimchi in Hwanghae-do is not bland but not extremely spicy. Most kimchi from this region has less color since red chili flakes are not used. The typical kimchi for Hwanghae-do is called hobakji (호박지). It is made with pumpkin (''bundi'').
[[File:Korean.food-kimchi-02.jpg|thumb|right|''Kimchi buchimgae'', a savoury Korean pancake with kimchi]]
* ''[[Gyeonggi-do]]'' (Lower Midwest of Hwanghae-do)
* ''[[Chungcheong-do]]'' (Between Gyeonggi-do and Jeolla-do): Instead of using fermented fish, people in the region rely on salt and fermentation to make savory kimchi. Chungcheong-do has the most varieties of kimchi.
* ''[[Gangwon-do (South Korea)]]/[[Kangwon-do (North Korea)]]'' (Mideast): In Gangwon-do, kimchi is stored for longer periods. Unlike other coastal regions in Korea, kimchi in this area does not contain much salted fish.
* ''[[Jeolla-do]]'' (Lower Southwest): Salted [[yellow corvina]] and salted [[butterfish]] are used in this region to create different seasonings for kimchi.
* ''[[Gyeongsang-do]]'' (Lower Southeast): This region's cuisine is saltier and spicier. The most common seasoning components include [[myeolchijeot]] ({{lang|ko|멸치젓}}) which produce a briny and savory flavor.
* ''Foreign countries'': In some places of the world people sometimes make kimchi with western [[cabbage]] and many other alternative ingredients such as [[broccoli]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=North Texas Traditional Living |website=Making Kimchi |url=http://www.traditionaltx.us/Heidi%27s%20kimchi%20recipe.pdf |accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=TreeLight |website=Ultimate Kimchi |url=http://www.treelight.com/health/nutrition/UltimateKimchi.html  | accessdate= 14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season===
Different types of kimchi were traditionally made at different times of the year, based on when various vegetables were in season and also to take advantage of hot and cold seasons before the era of refrigeration. Although the advent of modern refrigeration — including [[Kimchi refrigerator|kimchi refrigerators]] specifically designed with precise controls to keep different varieties of kimchi at optimal temperatures at various stages of fermentation — has made this seasonality unnecessary, Koreans continue to consume kimchi according to traditional seasonal preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tdctrade.com/imn/02031402/food19.htm|title=High-tech kimchi refrigerators keep Korea's favorite food crisp|publisher=Hong Kong Trade Development Council|date= 14 March 2002|accessdate= 14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Korean-Dongchimi-01.jpg|thumb|''[[Dongchimi]] ({{lang|ko|동치미}})'' is largely served during winter.]]

; Spring
After a long period of consuming ''[[gimjang]] kimchi'' ({{lang|ko|김장김치}}) during the winter, fresh [[potherb]]s and vegetables were used to make kimchi. These kinds of kimchi were not fermented or even stored for long periods of time but were consumed fresh.

; Summer
[[File:Yeolmukimchi 3.jpg|thumb|left|yeolmukimchi]]
[[Yeolmu radish]]es and cucumbers are summer vegetables made into kimchi, ''[[yeolmu-kimchi]]'' ({{lang|ko|열무김치}}) which is eaten in several bites. Brined fish or shellfish can be added, and freshly ground dried chili peppers are often used.

; Autumn
''[[Baechu]] kimchi'' is prepared by inserting blended stuffing materials, called ''sok'' (literally ''inside''), between layers of salted leaves of uncut, whole [[Napa cabbage]]. The ingredients of ''sok'' ({{lang|ko|속}}) can vary, depending on the different regions and weather conditions. Generally, ''baechu kimchi'' used to have a strong salty flavor until the late 1960s, before which a large amount of ''[[myeolchijeot]]'' or ''[[saeujeot]]'' had been used.

''[[Gogumasoon]] Kimchi'' is made from sweet potato stems.&lt;!-----
In the summer months when they often eat kimchi made materials lack access until the fall.
Mangeun not only it can be eaten in a day.

-----&gt;

; Winter
Traditionally, the greatest varieties of kimchi were available during the winter. In preparation for the long winter months, many types of [[gimjang|kimjang]] kimchi ({{lang|ko|김장 김치}}) were prepared in early winter and stored in the ground in large kimchi pots. Today, many city residents use modern [[kimchi refrigerator]]s offering precise temperature controls to store kimjang kimchi. November and December are traditionally when people begin to make kimchi; women often gather together in each other's homes to help with winter kimchi preparations.{{r|nyt2010}} "Baechu kimchi" is made with salted [[baechu]] filled with thin strips of [[Korean radish|radish]], parsley, pine nuts, pears, chestnuts, shredded red pepper, [[Umbilicaria esculenta|manna lichen]] ({{Korean|석이 버섯||seogi beoseot}}), garlic, and ginger.

===Korean preference===
A 2004 book about vegetable preservation said that the preference of kimchi preparation in Korean households from the most prepared type of kimchi to less prepared types of kimchi was: baechu kimchi, being the most prepared type of kimchi, then [[Kkakdugi|kaktugi]], then [[dongchimi]] and then chonggak kimchi. The book said that baechu kimchi comprises more than seventy percent of marketed kimchi and radish kimchi comprises about twenty percent of marketed kimchi.&lt;!--This information is in the second-to-last paragraph of page 191.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Hui2004"&gt;Hui et al.

Some Koreans believe that kimchi helps them cope with their fast-paced lives.&lt;ref name="Choe" /&gt; Kimchi is made of various vegetables and contains a high concentration of [[dietary fiber]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mykoreandiet.com/healthy-korean-food/kimchi-nutritional-value.html |title=Kimchi Nutritional Value |publisher= |accessdate=13 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2004issue2/vj2004issue2kimchi.htm |title=Kimchi by Nancy Berkoff, RD, EdD, CCE |publisher= |accessdate=13 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019083945/http://www.vrg.org/journal/vj2004issue2/vj2004issue2kimchi.htm |archivedate=19 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; while being low in calories. One serving also provides over 50% of the daily recommended amount of [[vitamin C]] and [[carotene]]. Most types of kimchi contain onions, garlic, ginger, and chili peppers, all of which are [[wikt:salutary|salutary]]. The vegetables used in kimchi also contribute to its overall nutritional value. Kimchi is rich in vitamin A, thiamine (B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), riboflavin (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), calcium, and iron,&lt;ref name="Asianinfo"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.asianinfo.org/asianinfo/korea/food.htm#KIM%20CHI |website=Asianinfo.com |title=Food in Korea |accessdate= 30 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tour2korea"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.visitkorea.or.kr/enu/OO/OO_EN_13_1_2.jsp?cid=347478 |website=Tour2korea.com |title=Kimchi |accessdate=30 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and contains [[lactic acid bacteria]], among those the typical species ''[[Lactobacillus kimchii]]''.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/50/5/1789.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=19 November 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409085855/http://ijs.sgmjournals.org/cgi/reprint/50/5/1789.pdf |archive-date=9 April 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jung-Sook Leea, Gun-Young Heoa, Jun Won Leea, Yun-Jung Oha, Jeong A Parka, Yong-Ha Parka, Yu-Ryang Pyunb and Jong Seog Ahn (15 July 2005).

During the [[2003 SARS outbreak]] in Asia, many people believed that kimchi could protect against infection. While there was no scientific evidence to support this belief, kimchi sales rose by 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4347443.stm | publisher = [[BBC News]] | title = Korean Dish 'May Cure Bird Flu' | date = 14 March 2005 | accessdate = 4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jun/17/entertainment/et-magnier17 | work= [[Los Angeles Times]] | title=In an Age of SARS, Koreans Tout Kimchi Cure | author = Magnier, Mark | date= 17 June 2003 | accessdate= 7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, kimchi may also contribute to [[stomach cancer]], which is the most common form of cancer in South Korea. In 2011, three Korean scientists reported that, "Kimchi, which is allegedly believed to have anti-carcinogenic properties, accounts for approximately 20% of sodium intake [in South Korea]. Case-control studies on the intake level of kimchi and gastric cancer risk generally showed an increased risk among subjects with high or frequent intakes of kimchi."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shin|first=Aesun|last2=Kim|first2=Jeongseon|last3=Park|first3=Sohee|date=September 2011|title=Gastric Cancer Epidemiology in Korea|journal=Journal of Gastric Cancer|volume=11|issue=3|pages=135–140|doi=10.5230/jgc.2011.11.3.135|issn=2093-582X|pmc=3204471|pmid=22076217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dishes made with kimchi==
[[File:Korean.food-Kimchijeon-01.jpg|thumb|[[Kimchibuchimgae]]]]
Kimchi is known to be a traditional side dish as it is almost always served along with other side dishes in most Korean family households and restaurants. Kimchi can be eaten alone or with white rice, but it is also included in recipes of other traditional dishes, including porridges, soups, and rice cakes. Kimchi is also the basis for many derivative dishes such as kimchi stew ({{Korean|김치찌개||[[kimchijjigae|gimchijjigae]]|labels=no}}), kimchi pancake ({{Korean|김치전||[[kimchibuchimgae|gimchibuchimgae]]|labels=no}}), kimchi soup ({{Korean|김칫국||[[Guk#Overview|gimchiguk]]|labels=no}}), and kimchi fried rice ({{Korean|김치볶음밥||[[kimchibokkeumbap|gimchibokkeumbap]]|labels=no}}). 
Army base stew ({{Korean|hangul=부대찌개||[[Budae-jjigae]]|labels=no}}) is a popular dish made with spam, sausage, and kimchi. It originated after the Korean war with ingredients that would be scrounged from the army.

==Production==
South Korea consumes 1.85 million metric tons of kimchi annually, or nearly 80 pounds a person. It imports a significant fraction of that, mostly from China, and runs a $47.3 million kimchi trade deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Huang|first1=Echo|title=The kimchi you eat outside of Korea is probably made in China|url=https://qz.com/1183632/the-kimchi-you-eat-outside-of-korea-is-probably-made-in-china/|accessdate=19 January 2018|work=[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]|date=19 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent history==

===1996 Japanese kimchi dispute===
In 1996, Korea protested against Japanese commercial production of kimchi arguing that the Japanese-produced product (''kimuchi'') was different from kimchi (in particular, Japanese kimuchi was not fermented so it was salted but sweet cabbage). Korea lobbied for an international standard from the [[Codex Alimentarius]], an organization associated with the World Health Organization that defines voluntary standards for food preparation for international trade purposes.&lt;ref name=LAT/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;Sims, Calvin (February 2000) [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/05/business/cabbage-cabbage-not-kimchi-lovers-koreans-take-issue-with-rendition-their.html "Cabbage Is Cabbage? Not to Kimchi Lovers; Koreans Take Issue with a Rendition of Their National Dish Made in Japan"].  ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Codex Alimentarius published a voluntary standard defining kimchi as "a fermented food that uses salted napa cabbages as its main ingredient mixed with seasonings, and goes through a lactic acid production process at a low temperature", but which neither specified a minimum amount of fermentation nor forbade the use of any additives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codexalimentarius.net/download/standards/365/CXS_223e.pdf |title=Codex standard for kimchi |publisher=The Codex Alimentarius Commission |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1998 to 2007 motherland tours===
South Korea developed programs for adult [[International adoption of South Korean children|Korean adoptees]] to return to South Korea and learn about what it means to be Korean. One of these programs was learning how to make kimchi.&lt;ref&gt;In a video that was published to YouTube on 29 July 2013, Eleana J. Kim who is Assistant Professor of Anthropology as the [[University of Rochester]] talked about the international adoption of South Korean children. Kim's name and title appear at the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irn1yXF_1H4&amp;t=35m11s 35:11 mark of the video]. From [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irn1yXF_1H4&amp;t=26m56s the 26:56 mark of the video to the 28:09 mark of the video], Kim said, "''Another aspect of the Korean adoptee experience that I explore in my book is their relationship to South Korea, and the South Korean state, and, uh, one of the things that the South Korean government, um, was, in a way, uh, um, compelled, to do, in the late nineteen nineties was to, recognize, adoptees, overseas adoptees, as Koreans, in some way. So, um, by nineteen ninety eight, adult Korean adoptees, who were living in Korea, petitioned the South Korean state to recognize them as overseas Koreans, &lt;i&gt;[[Korean diaspora|Hanguggye dongpo]]&lt;/i&gt;, so that meant that they would be, uh, eligible for a special visa status, that would allow them to return to South Korea for extended periods of time, and, in line with this, this is an image from the overseas Korean foundation, uh, summer cultural program for overseas adoptees, and so, they developed these programs to help adult adoptees return to Korea and learn something about what it means to be Korean, so these programs are typically focused on traditional Korean culture, um, you know, adoptees dressing up in [[hanbok]] and learning how to make kimchi, um, such as these images here."&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 kimchi ingredient price crisis===
Due to heavy rainfall shortening the harvesting time for cabbage and other main ingredients for kimchi in 2010, the price of kimchi ingredients and kimchi itself rose greatly. Korean and international newspapers described the rise in prices as a national crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/17204655|title=Of cabbages and Kims|newspaper=The Economist|issn=0013-0613|access-date=2016-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some restaurants stopped offering kimchi as a free side dish, which ''The New York Times'' compared to an American hamburger restaurant no longer offering free [[ketchup]].&lt;ref name="nyt2010"&gt;{{cite news |author=McDonald, Mark |title=Rising Cost of Kimchi Alarms Koreans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/15/world/asia/15kimchi.html?_r=2&amp;src=me&amp;ref=general |accessdate=16 October 2010 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=14 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the kimchi price crisis, the South Korean government announced the temporary reduction of tariffs on imported cabbage to coincide with the Kimjang season.&lt;ref name="EconomistOct72010"&gt;{{cite news |title=South Korea's Kimchi Crisis |url=http://www.economist.com/node/17204655?story_id=17204655 |work=[[The Economist]] |date=7 October 2010 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 effective ban of Korean kimchi exports to China===
Since 2012, the Chinese government has effectively banned Korean kimchi exports to China through government regulations. Ignoring the standards of Kimchi outlined by the Codex Alimentarius, China defined kimchi as a derivative of one of its own cuisines, called [[pao cai]].&lt;ref name="seoul.co.kr"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20130720011020 |title=對중국 수출 '0'... 한국 김치가 운다 |publisher=seoul.co.kr }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to significantly different preparation techniques from pao cai, kimchi has significantly more lactic acid bacteria through its fermentation process, which exceeds China's regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?aid=2014011481381 |title=수입만 하고 수출 못하는 韓·中 '김치무역' 바꿀 것 |date=15 January 2014 |publisher=Hankyung.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115104/http://www.hankyung.com/news/app/newsview.php?aid=2014011481381 |archivedate=24 September 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2012, commercial exports of Korean kimchi to China has reached zero, the only minor amounts of exports accounting for Korean kimchi exhibition events held in China.&lt;ref name="seoul.co.kr"/&gt;

===Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity===
Kimchi-related items have been inscribed on [[UNESCO]]'s [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] by both South and North Korea. This makes kimchi the second intangible heritage that was submitted by two different countries, the other one being the folk song "[[Arirang]]" which was also submitted by both the Koreas.&lt;ref name="worl_UNES"&gt;{{Cite web |title=UNESCO Adds N. Korea's Kimchi-Making to Cultural Heritage List |publisher=KBS |date=3 December 2015 |accessdate=3 December 2015 |url=http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/news/news_In_detail.htm?No=115259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Submitted by South Korea (inscribed 2013)====
Kimjang, the tradition of making and sharing of kimchi that usually takes place in late autumn, was added to the list as "Kimjang, making and sharing kimchi in the Republic of Korea". The practice of Kimjang reaffirms Korean identity and strengthens family cooperation. Kimjang is also an important reminder for many Koreans that human communities need to live in harmony with nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/kimjang-making-and-sharing-kimchi-in-the-republic-of-korea-00881 |title=2003 Convention |publisher=UNESCO - Intangible Heritage Section }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Submitted by North Korea (inscribed 2015)====
North Korean kimchi-making was inscribed on the list in December 2015&lt;ref name="worl_UNES"/&gt; as "Tradition of kimchi-making in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea".&lt;ref name="unes_Trad"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Tradition of kimchi-making in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea |publisher=Culture Sector - UNESCO |accessdate=3 December 2015 |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/tradition-of-kimchi-making-in-the-democratic-people-s-republic-of-korea-01063 }}&lt;/ref&gt; North Korean kimchi tends to be less spicy and red than South Korean kimchi.&lt;ref name="yout_Nort"&gt;{{Cite video |title=North Koreans Want UNESCO Recognition for Their Kimchi Variation |publisher=[[Voice of America]] |work=YouTube |date=2 December 2015 |accessdate=3 December 2015 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7uPJB__JuF0 |time=1:10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 kimchi-making class for Vietnamese brides===
A 2014 article in ''[[Tuổi Trẻ]]'' said that around 40 Vietnamese brides who had already married or who were going to marry Korean men spent two hours in a class in 2014 to make kimchi and [[gimbap|kimbap]] at the Kim &amp; Kim Company’s factory in the [[Tân Bình District|Tân Bình]] Industrial Zone of [[Ho Chi Minh City]].&lt;!--This information is mostly in the first paragraph except the location of the class being in the Kim &amp; Kim Company’s factory in the Tân Bình Industrial Zone which was in the fourth paragraph. The article said that the class took place on "September 6" in the first paragraph which meant September 6, 2014, since the date of the article is September 12, 2014.--&gt; The event was arranged by the Kim &amp; Kim Company and the Korean Language Education Center in Ho Chi Minh City.&lt;!--This information is in the first paragraph. The word "arranged" is a rewording of the source text's word "organized".--&gt; The class is a free class that has been taught to 30 to 35 women once a month.&lt;!--This information is in the fifth paragraph from the bottom that starts with "The free class has". The word "taught" is a rewording of the source text's word "held".--&gt; Han Ji-sook, the director of the Korean Language Education Center in Ho Chi Minh City, said, "Kimchi is important for Korean people, so anyone who visits the country will experience kimchi or kimchi-making. Especially for the wives of Korean men, it's important to know how to make kimchi."&lt;!--This quote is in the twelfth paragraph. That paragraph is a quote from Han Ji-sook as indicated by the phrase "she added" after the quote. Han Ji-sook's name is introduced in the previous paragraph as well as her being the director of the Korean Language Education Center in Ho Chi Minh City.--&gt; Kim Tae-kon, director of the Kim &amp; Kim Company, said, "All of these Vietnamese women who are going to live in Korea must eat kimchi every day, three meals a day. I'm pleased to give them the chance to learn how to make kimchi."&lt;!--This quote is in the seventh paragraph, and Kim Tae-kon being the director of the Kim &amp; Kim Company is in the previous paragraph.--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pham, T. &amp; Nguyen, D. (2014). Vietnamese brides learn to make kimchi. [[Tuổi Trẻ]].

===Boycott in China===
A 2017 article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that [[anti-Korean sentiment in China]] has risen after South Korea's acceptance of the deployment of [[Terminal High Altitude Area Defense|THAAD]] in South Korea,&lt;!--This information is in the paragraph that starts with "A wave of anti-South Korean". The phrase "South's embrace" in that paragraph is a link to another New York Times article. In the other New York Times article it said that South Korea was allowing the US to use land in South Korea to put THAAD in the paragraph of that linked-to article that starts with "Under its deal" and the paragraph after that one.--&gt; Government-run Chinese news media has encouraged the boycott of South Korean goods,&lt;!--This is in the paragraph that starts with "The government-controlled". The phrase "government-run" is a rewording of the source text's phrase "government-controlled". The word "encouraged" is a rewording of the source text's word "urged". The phrase "South Korean goods" is a rewording of the source text's phrase "South Korean products".--&gt; and Chinese nationalists have vowed to not eat kimchi.&lt;!--This information is in the paragraph that starts with "Frustrated nationalists".--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernández, Javier C., Guo, Owen &amp; McMorrow, Ryan.

The '''Kwomtari languages''' are a small [[language family]] of [[Papua New Guinea]].

==Classification==
The family consists of at least the two relatively closely related languages Kwomtari and Nai.  

===Baron===
Baron adds the highly divergent language Guriaso:

*Kwomtari stock
**[[Guriaso language|Guriaso]]
**Kwomtari–Nai family (Nuclear Kwomtari)
***[[Kwomtari language|Kwomtari]]
***[[Nai language|Nai]] ({{sm|aka}} Biaka)

Guriaso shares a small number of cognates with Kwomtari–Nai. Baron (1983) says the evidence is convincing once a correspondence between {{IPA|/ɾ~l/}} and {{IPA|/n/}} (from {{IPA|*ɾ}}) is established:

{| class="IPA wikitable"
|-
! Gloss !! Guriaso !! Kwomtari
|-
! Verb suffixes&lt;br&gt;(1pl, 2pl, 3pl)
| -nɔ, -mɛ, -no || -ɾe, -mo, -ɾe*
|-
! dog
| map || mau
|-
! ear
| mətɛnu || futɛne
|-
! crocodile 
| mɔməni || maməle
|-
! small
| tɔkəno || tɔkweɾo 
|-
! nose 
| apədu || tipu**
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Compare Biaka {{IPA|-ɾo, -mo, -na}}.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Metathesis (linguistics)|Metathesis]] of /p/ and /t/.

===Usher===
Usher further classifies [[Yale language|Yale]] (Nagatman) with Guriaso, and adds [[Busa language (Papuan)|Busa]], all under the name "Senu River".&lt;ref&gt;[https://sites.google.com/site/newguineaworld/families/senu-river NewGuineaWorld Senu River]&lt;/ref&gt;

;Senu River (Kwomtari–Busa)
*Kwomtari–Nai
*Guriaso–Yale
*Odiai (Busa)

===Confusion from Laycock===
There has been confusion over the membership of the Kwomtari family, apparently due to a misalignment in the publication (Loving &amp; Bass 1964) of the data used for the initial classification. (See Baron 1983.) Because of this, Laycock classified the Kwomtari languages as part of a spurious [[Kwomtari–Fas languages|Kwomtari–Fas]] family, which confusingly was also often called "Kwomtari" in the literature. However, Baron sees no evidence that the similarities are due to relationship. Usher likewise discounts the inclusion of the Fas languages. See [[Kwomtari–Fas languages]] for details.

A '''linguistic map''' is a [[thematic map]] showing the geographic distribution of the speakers of a [[language]], or [[isogloss]]es of a [[dialect continuum]] of the same language. A collection of such maps is a '''linguistic atlas'''.

The earliest such [[atlas]] was the ''Sprachatlas des Deutschen Reiches'' of [[Georg Wenker]] and [[Ferdinand Wrede]], published beginning in 1888, followed by the ''[[Atlas Linguistique de la France]]'', of [[Jules Gilliéron]] between 1902 and 1910, and the ''AIS - Sprach- und Sachatlas Italiens und der Südschweiz'' of [[Karl Jaberg]] and [[Jakob Jud]], published 1928–1940. The first linguistic atlas of the US was published by [[Hans Kurath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Mandatory tipping''' (also known as a '''mandatory gratuity''' or an '''autograt'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last =  | first =  | title = "autograt" definition from Double-Tongued Dictionary | url = http://www.doubletongued.org/index.php/dictionary/autograt/ | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 28 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Tip (gratuity)|tip]] which is added automatically to the customer's bill, without the customer determining the amount or being asked. It may be implemented in several ways, such as applying a fixed percentage to all customer's bills, or to large groups, or on a customer by customer basis.&lt;ref name="pqarchiver"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/USAToday/access/887933271.html?dids=887933271:887933271&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Aug+26%2C+2005&amp;author=Laura+Bly&amp;pub=USA+TODAY&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=D.1&amp;desc=The+tipping+point+%3B+Will+mandatory+service+charges+replace+voluntary+gratuities%3F | title = Will mandatory service charges replace voluntary gratuities? | publisher = USA Today.com |accessdate = 2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some economists have argued that tipping is economically inefficient, and suggested that mandatory gratuity might solve some of this issue. {{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source;|date=August 2015}}

==General discussion==
Some bars in [[New York City]]'s borough of [[Manhattan]] have instituted mandatory tipping. Mandatory tipping is considered an oxymoron, as tipping is by definition a voluntary act on the part of the customer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2010/11/01/high-end-manhattan-bars-institute-mandatory-tipping/| title = High-End Manhattan Bars Institute Mandatory Tipping | publisher = CBS New York |accessdate = 2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC has reported that some find the practice bothersome; particularly those who are not aware that the tipping is used to subsidize the sub-standard pay at the workplace.&lt;ref name="hardrockwages"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7513273.stm | work=BBC News | title=Hard Rock wages 'below minimum' | date=July 18, 2008 | accessdate=April 2, 2010 | first=Martin | last=Shankleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; One waiter in [[London|London, England]] has criticized the low wages to the popular press.&lt;ref name="hardrockwages"/&gt;

Mandatory tipping and voluntary tipping are illegal in some cases: [[Australia]]n casino employees,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelaw.tas.gov.au/tocview/index.w3p;doc_id=94%2B%2B1993%2BAT%40EN%2B20070406010000 Tasmanian Gaming Control Act 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; and US government employees, for example. Tipping is not generally part of [[Japan]]ese culture, and can be confusing or offensive.&lt;ref name="travel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/content/607597/425829.html |title=What to tip when travelling |date=August 30, 2005 |agency=[[Australian Associated Press|AAP]] |work=[[Television New Zealand]] |accessdate=October 19, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510091858/http://tvnz.co.nz/content/607597/425829.html |archivedate=May 10, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tipping in [[China]] is frowned upon, except for those living in the semi-westernized regions of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/04/27/DDGPLIFCD11.DTL A few tips on handling gratuities worldwide]&lt;/ref&gt;

Slightly less authoritative sources are appellate court decisions, with the U.S. Supreme Court at the top. Appellate courts regard mandatory gratuities as income for servers rather than a tip, thus affecting taxation. However, court cases have yet to set a precedent that failing to pay "mandatory gratuity" is illegal. &lt;ref&gt;A [https://scholar.google.com/advanced_scholar_search Google Scholar] search of the exact phrase "mandatory gratuity" among all legal opinions and journals [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=50&amp;as_epq=mandatory+gratuity&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_sdtf=&amp;as_sdts=5&amp;btnG=Search+Scholar&amp;hl=en found 17 hits] (excluding two articles), and all of those cases regarded mandatory gratuities as mandatory.&lt;/ref&gt;

Restaurant customers who pay the food portion of their bill but not the mandatory gratuity have at times been arrested, charges are generally dropped.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/Theft-Charges-Dropped-Against-No-Tip-Couple--71865807.html NBC10 Philadelphia: Theft Charges Dropped Against No-Tip Couple (November 24, 2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes_2004-09-15"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/15/nyregion/15tipper.html?_r=2 New York Times: Charges were dropped yesterday against a Long Island man who was arrested last week for failing to leave a required 18 percent gratuity at Soprano's Italian and American Grill in Lake George, N.Y. (September 25, 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cruise lines charge their patrons $10/day in mandatory tipping; this does not include extra gratuities for alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref name="pqarchiver"/&gt;

Judith Martin in her 2005 manners book opines that [[fast food]] restaurants will never charge mandatory tipping for their customers, despite the presence of [[tip jar]]s,&lt;ref name="missmanners"&gt;"Miss Manners Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior, Freshly Updated" by Judith Martin, p. 762. 2005. {{ISBN|0-393-05874-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="emilypost"&gt;[http://www.emilypost.com/surveys/results/poll5.htm Emily Post Institute—Tip Jar Survey Results] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208123200/http://www.emilypost.com/surveys/results/poll5.htm |date=2008-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and considers tipping for non-table services to be inappropriate.&lt;ref name="missmanners"/&gt;&lt;ref name="emilypost"/&gt;

Ian Ayres, Fredrick E. Vars &amp; Nasser Zakariya published a paper suggesting that tipping contributed to [[Racism|racial prejudice]], since ethnic minorities would often be less able to pay a large tip. Another paper by Yoram Margalioth of [[Tel Aviv University]] argued that there was a [[negative externality]] associated with tipping, and that the practice facilitated [[Tax avoidance and tax evasion|tax evasion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Case Against Tipping|journal=University of Pennsylvania Journal of Business and Employment Law|date=|first=Yoram|last=Margalioth|coauthors=|volume=117|issue=9|pages=|id= |url=|format=|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other American studies have contributed to the thesis that tipping is racially discriminatory, finding that ethnic minority servers and taxicab drivers received lower tips on average than their white counterparts. In the study of the servers, an attempt by the author to isolate other possible contributing factors, such as poor service, found that "After controlling for these other variables … the server race effect is comparable across customer race."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://freakonomics.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/the-racial-tipping-point/ |title=The Racial Tipping Point |accessdate=2008-03-22 |last=Ayres |first=Ian |date=2008-03-20 |work=Freakonomics Blog |publisher=[[New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Labour laws==
===Canada===
[[Quebec]] and [[Ontario]] allow employers to pay lower [[minimum wage]]s to workers who would reasonably be expected to be receiving tips.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930180934/http://www.gov.mb.ca/labour/labmgt/resbr/wages/minwage.html Minimum Wage Rates Across Canada]." ''Manitoba Labour and Immigration''.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ontario]], the [[minimum wage]] is $14.00 per hour, with exceptions for students under 18 years old and employed for not more than 28 hours a week, who are paid $13.15 per hour; and both liquor and restaurant servers, who are paid $12.20 per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/page/minimum-wage-increase|title=Minimum wage increase|accessdate=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 13, 2010, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported since 2009, it has become common for restaurant servers to give part of their tips to the business they work for.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/article/794726--restaurant-bosses-take-bigger-share-of-the-tip?bn=1|title=Restaurant bosses take bigger share of the tip|publisher=Toronto Star|first=Raveena|last=Aulakh|date=2010-04-13|accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers who receive tips are legally required to report the income to the [[Canada Revenue Agency]] and pay [[income tax]] on it. In Quebec, the provincial government automatically taxes servers 8% of their sales whether a gratuity was received or not.  In other provinces, however, many workers have been known to [[Unreported employment|report no income]] from tips at all or, perhaps more commonly, to "lowball" the figure. In response, the CRA has said that it will closely check the tax returns of individuals who would reasonably be expected to be receiving tips to ensure that the tips are reported realistically.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, D.L. "[http://www.halifaxlive.com/artman/publish/printer_tax_230505_112.shtml Revenue Canada to Tax Wait Staff's Tips] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060526/http://www.halifaxlive.com/artman/publish/printer_tax_230505_112.shtml |date=2007-09-28 }}." ''HalifaxLive.com''. 2005-05-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to guidelines established by the [[Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association]], autograts and any tip pool controlled and distributed by the restaurant is legally subject to income tax and other mandatory deductions before being paid to the servers. All other gratuities are deemed direct tips and it is the server's responsibility to declare them as taxable income when filing for income tax.

[[File:Mobfooty.jpg|thumb|225px|An illustration of so-called "mob football", a variety of medieval football.]]

"'''Medieval football'''" is a modern term used for a wide variety of localised [[football]] games which were invented and played in [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]]. Alternative names include '''folk football''', '''mob football''' and '''Shrovetide football'''. These games may be regarded as the ancestors of [[Football#Establishment of modern codes|modern codes of football]], and by comparison with later forms of football, the medieval matches were chaotic and had few rules.

The Middle Ages saw a rise in popularity of games played annually at [[Shrovetide]] throughout Europe, particularly in [[Great Britain]]. The games played in England at this time may have arrived with the [[Roman Britain|Roman occupation]] but there is little evidence to indicate this. Certainly the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] played ball games, in particular [[Harpastum]]. There is also one reference to ball games being played in southern Britain prior to the [[Norman Conquest]]. In the ninth century [[Nennius]]'s ''[[Historia Britonum]]'' tells that a group of boys were playing at ball (''pilae ludus'').&lt;ref name=Magoun&gt;Magoun, Francis Peabody (1929). "Football in Medieval England and Middle-English literature." ''The American Historical Review'', vol 35, No. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of this account is either [[Southern England]] or [[Wales]]. References to a ball game played in northern [[France]] known as ''[[La Soule]]'' or ''Choule'', in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ruff | first = Julius  | title = Violence in Early Modern Europe 1500–1800 | publisher = Cambridge University Press  | year = 2001  | page = 170  | isbn = 978-0-521-59894-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; date from the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Jules Jusserand|Jusserand, Jean-Jules]].

These archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played between neighbouring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated [[pig's bladder]] by any means possible to markers at each end of a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it did not lead to manslaughter or murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/Britain-home-of-football.html |title=History of Football – Britain, the home of Football |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes instead of markers, the teams would attempt to kick the bladder into the balcony of the opponents' church. A legend that these games in England evolved from a more ancient and bloody ritual of kicking the "[[Danelaw|Dane]]'s head" is unlikely to be true. These antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the [[Highway Act 1835]] was passed banning the playing of football on public highways.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1835/50/pdfs/ukpga_18350050_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, games continued to be played in some parts of the United Kingdom and still survive in a number of towns, notably the [[Ba game]] played at Christmas and New Year at [[Kirkwall]] in the [[Orkney Islands]] Scotland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Spooner |title=Take Me Out To The Ball Game |newspaper=The Independent |date=22 January 2006 |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/uk/take-me-out-to-the-ball-game-524254.html |accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Uppies and Downies]] over Easter at Workington in Cumbria, and the [[Royal Shrovetide Football]] Match on [[Shrove Tuesday]] and [[Ash Wednesday]] at [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire|Ashbourne]] in [[Derbyshire]], England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/derby/hi/people_and_places/history/newsid_8322000/8322713.stm |publisher=BBC |title=The history of Royal Ashbourne Shrovetide Football| date=24 December 2009 |accessdate=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Few images of medieval football survive. One engraving from the early fourteenth century at [[Gloucester Cathedral]], England, clearly shows two young men running vigorously towards each other with a ball in mid-air between them. There is a hint that the players may be using their hands to strike the ball. A second medieval image in the [[British Museum]], London clearly shows a group of men with a large ball on the ground. The ball clearly has a seam where leather has been sewn together. It is unclear exactly what is happening in this set of three images, although the last image appears to show a man with a broken arm. It is likely that this image highlights the dangers of some medieval football games.&lt;ref name=Marples&gt;Marples, Morris (1954). ''A History of Football'', Secker and Warburg, London&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the very early references to the game speak simply of "ball play" or "playing at ball". This reinforces the idea that the games played at the time did not necessarily involve a ball being kicked.

==History==

===9th to 13th centuries===
The earliest account of ball games being played in post-classical Europe comes from the 9th-century ''[[Historia Brittonum]]'', attributed to the monk [[Nennius]]. The text, written in [[Wales]], mentions a group of boys "playing at ball" (pilae ludus).&lt;ref&gt;[[s: History of the Britons|''Historia Brittonum'']], ch. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest reference from France which provides evidence of the playing of ball games (presumably [[La soule]]) comes in 1147.  This refers to the handing over of "seven balloons of greatest dimension". An early description of ball games that are likely to be football in England was given by [[William FitzStephen]] (c. 1174 – 1183). He described the activities of London youths during the annual festival of [[Shrove Tuesday]]:

{{quote|After lunch, all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously: you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trytel.com/~tristan/towns/florilegium/introduction/intro01.html#p25|title=Florilegium urbanum - Introduction - FitzStephen's Description of London|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The earliest confirmation that such ball games in England involved kicking comes from a verse about [[Little Saint Hugh of Lincoln]]. This was probably written in the thirteenth century, being recorded by [[Matthew Paris]], although the precise date is not known: "Four and twenty bonny boys, were playing at the ball.. he kicked the ball with his right foot".

In about 1200 "ball" is mentioned as one of the games played by King Arthur's knights in "Brut", written by [[Layamon]], an English poet from [[Worcestershire]].&lt;ref name=Magoun/&gt; This is the earliest reference to the [[English language]] "ball". Layamon states: "some drive balls (balles) far over the fields". Records from 1280 report on a game at [[Ulgham]], near [[Ashington]] in [[Northumberland]], in which a player was killed as a result of running against an opposing player's dagger. This account is noteworthy because it is the earliest reference to an English ball game that definitely involved kicking; this suggests that kicking was involved in even earlier ball games in England. In Cornwall in 1283 [[plea rolls]] No. 111. mention a man named Roger who was accused of striking a fellow player in a game of ''soule'' with a stone, a blow which proved fatal.&lt;ref&gt;''Medieval Cornwall'' by [[Leonard Elliott Elliot-Binns|L. E. Elliot-Binns]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===14th century===
The earliest reference to ball games being played by university students comes in 1303 when "Thomas of [[Salisbury]], a student of [[Oxford University]], found his brother Adam dead, and it was alleged that he was killed by Irish students, whilst playing the ball in the High Street towards Eastgate".&lt;ref name=Marples/&gt;

In 1314, comes the earliest reference to a game called football when [[Nicholas de Farndone]], [[Lord Mayor of the City of London]] issued a decree on behalf of King [[Edward II of England|Edward II]] banning football. It was written in the [[French language|French]] used by the English upper classes at the time. A translation reads: "[f]orasmuch as there is great noise in the city caused by hustling over large foot balls [''rageries de grosses pelotes de pee''] in the fields of the public from which many evils might arise which God forbid: we command and forbid on behalf of the king, on pain of imprisonment, such game to be used in the city in the future."

Another early account of kicking ball games from England comes in a 1321 [[Dispensation (canon law)|dispensation]], granted by [[Pope John XXII]] to William de Spalding of [[Shouldham]]:
"To William de Spalding, canon of Scoldham of the order of Sempringham. During the game at ball as he kicked the ball, a lay friend of his, also called William, ran against him and wounded himself on a sheathed knife carried by the canon, so severely that he died within six days. Dispensation is granted, as no blame is attached to William de Spalding, who, feeling deeply the death of his friend, and fearing what might be said by his enemies, has applied to the pope."

Banning of ball games began in France in 1331 by [[Philip VI of France|Philip VI]], presumably the ball game known as La soule.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

[[File:Youths playing ball Gloucester Cathedral.jpg|right|thumb|Youths playing ball depicted on a misericord at Gloucester Cathedral.]]
In the mid-fourteenth century a [[misericord]] at [[Gloucester cathedral]], England shows two young men playing a ball game. It looks as though they are using their hands for the game; however, kicking certainly cannot be excluded. It is notable for the fact that most other medieval images of ball games in England show large balls. This picture clearly shows that small balls were also used.

King [[Edward III of England]] also issued such a declaration, in 1363: "[m]oreover we ordain that you prohibit under penalty of imprisonment all and sundry from such stone, wood and iron throwing; handball, football, or hockey; coursing and cock-fighting, or other such idle games". It is noteworthy that at this time football was already being differentiated in England from handball, which suggests the evolution of basic rules. Between 1314 and 1667, football was officially banned in England alone by more than 30 royal and local laws. (See the article [[Attempts to ban football games]] for more details.)

Likewise [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] offered an allusion to the manner in which contemporary ball games may have been played in fourteenth-century England. In the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' (written some time after 1380) he uses the following line: "rolleth under foot as doth a ball".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext00/cbtls12.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

English Theologian [[John Wycliffe]] (1320–1384) referred to football in one of his sermons: "and now þei clouten þer shone wiþ censuris, as who shulde chulle a foot-balle"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/selectenglishwo00wyclgoog#page/n304/mode/2up Sermon XIX // Select English Works of John Wyclif. Edited by Thomas Arnold. – Vol. II. – Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1871. – 423 pp. - P. 280.]&lt;/ref&gt; It may be the earliest use of the word ''football'' in English.

===15th century===
That football was known at the turn of the century in Western England comes from about 1400 when the West Midland Laud Troy War Book states in English: "Hedes reled aboute overal As men playe at the fote-ball"&lt;ref name=Magoun/&gt;

Two references to football games come from [[Sussex]] in 1403 and 1404 at [[Selmeston]] and [[Chidham]] as part of baptisms. On each occasion one of the players broke his leg&lt;ref name=Marples36&gt;Marples, Morris (1954). ''A History of Football'', Secker and Warburg, London, p36&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Henry IV of England]] provides the first documented use of the English word "football" when in 1409 he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for "foteball".&lt;ref name=Magoun/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1409 on 4 March eight men were compelled to give a bond of £20 to the London city chamberlain for their good behaviour towards "the kind and good men of the mystery of Cordwainers" undertaking not to collect money for a football (pro pila pedali).

In 1410 King Henry IV of England found it necessary to impose a fine of 20S on mayors and bailiffs in towns where misdemeanours such as football occurred. This confirms that football was not confined to London.&lt;ref name=Marples36/&gt;

The Accounts of the [[Worshipful Company of Brewers]] between 1421 and 1423 concerning the hiring out of their hall include reference to "by the "ffooteballepleyers" twice... 20 pence" listed in English under the title "crafts and fraternities".&lt;ref name=Magoun/&gt; This reference suggests that bans against football were unsuccessful and the listing of football players as a "fraternity" is the earliest allusion to what might be considered a football club.

The earliest reference to football or kicking ball games in [[Scotland]] was in 1424 when King [[James I of Scotland]] also attempted to ban the playing of "fute-ball".

In 1425 the prior of [[Bicester]], England, made a payment on St Katherine's day "to sundry gifts to football players (ludentibus ad pilam pedalem)" of 4 denarii. It is noteworthy that at this time the prior was willing to give his patronage to the game despite its being outlawed.&lt;ref name=Marples/&gt;

In about 1430 Thomas Lydgate refers to the form of football played in [[East Anglia]] known as [[Camp Ball]]: "Bolseryd out of length and bread, lyck a large campynge balle"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/fll/11330392/articulos/EIUC9494110047A.PDF |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304132416/http://www.ucm.es/BUCM/revistas/fll/11330392/articulos/EIUC9494110047A.PDF |archivedate=4 March 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1440 the game of [[Camp Ball]] was confirmed to be a form of football when the first ever English-Latin dictionary, ''[[Promptorium parvulorum]]'' offers the following definition of camp ball: "Campan, or playar at foott balle, pediluson; campyon, or champion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/spe/spe10.htm|title=Sports and Pastimes of the People of England: II. Rural Exercises Generally Practised: Chapter III|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1472 the rector of [[Swaffham]], [[Norfolk]] bequeathed a field adjoining the church yard for use as a "camping-close" or "camping-pightel" specifically for the playing of the East Anglian version of football known as [[Camp Ball]].&lt;ref&gt;Marples, Morris (1954). ''A History of Football'', Secker and Warburg, London, p37&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1486 comes the earliest description of "a football", in the sense of a ball rather than a game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football "football"] at ''EtymOnline.com''&lt;/ref&gt; This reference is in Dame [[Juliana Berners]]' ''Book of [[St Albans]]''. It states: "a certain rounde instrument to play with ...it is an instrument for the foote and then it is calde in Latyn 'pila pedalis', a fotebal."&lt;ref name=Magoun/&gt; It is noteworthy that it was considered socially acceptable for a football to be included in medieval English [[Heraldry]].

There is an account from 11 April 1497 of a sum of money "giffen [given] to Jame Dog [James Doig] to b[u]y fut ballis to the [[James IV of Scotland|King]]".[http://www.doig.net/DOIGK.htm]. It is not known if he himself played with them.

The earliest and perhaps most important description of a football game comes from the end of the 15th century in a Latin account of a football game with features of modern [[soccer]]. It was played at [[Cawston, Nottinghamshire|Cawston]], [[Nottinghamshire]], England. It is included in a manuscript collection of the miracles of King [[Henry VI of England]]. Although the precise date is uncertain it certainly comes from between 1481 and 1500. This is the first account of an exclusively "kicking game" and the first description of [[dribbling]]: "[t]he game at which they had met for common recreation is called by some the foot-ball game. It is one in which young men, in country sport, propel a huge ball not by throwing it into the air but by striking it and rolling it along the ground, and that not with their hands but with their feet... kicking in opposite directions" The chronicler gives the earliest reference to a football field, stating that: "[t]he boundaries have been marked and the game had started.&lt;ref name=Magoun/&gt; Nevertheless the game was still rough, as the account confirms: "a game, I say, abominable enough . . . and rarely ending but with some loss, accident, or disadvantage of the players themselves."

Medieval sport had no referee.&lt;ref&gt;Olmert, Michael (1996). ''Milton's Teeth and Ovid's Umbrella: Curiouser &amp; Curiouser Adventures in History'', p.85. Simon &amp; Schuster, New York. {{ISBN|0-684-80164-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===16th century===
In 1510 comes the next description of early football by [[Alexander Barclay]], a resident of the South East of England:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
They get the bladder and blowe it great and thin, with many beanes and peason put within, It ratleth, shineth and soundeth clere and fayre, While it is throwen and caste up in the eyre, Eche one contendeth and hath a great delite, with foote and hande the bladder for to smite, if it fall to the ground they lifte it up again... Overcometh the winter with driving the foote-ball.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first record of a pair of football boots occurs when [[Henry VIII of England]] ordered a pair from the Great Wardrobe in 1526. The royal shopping list for footwear states: "45 velvet pairs and 1 leather pair for football".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/feb/18/britishidentity.arts "Who's the fat bloke in the number eight shirt?" ''The Guardian''] Accessed 2010–06–13&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately these are no longer in existence. It is not known for certain whether the king himself played the game, but if so this is noteworthy as his son Edward VI later banned the game in 1548 it because it incited riots.

The reputation of football as a violent game persists throughout most accounts from 16th-century England. In 1531, Sir Thomas Elyot noted in his ''Boke named The Governour'' the dangers of football, as well as the benefits of [[archery]] ("shooting"):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some men wolde say, that in mediocritie, whiche I haue so moche praised in shootynge, why shulde nat boulynge, claisshe, pynnes, and koytyng be as moche commended? Verily as for two the laste, be to be utterly abiected of al noble men, in like wise foote balle, wherin is nothinge but beastly furie and extreme violence; wherof procedeth hurte, and consequently rancour and malice do remaine with them that be wounded; wherfore it is to be put in perpetuall silence. In class she is emploied to litle strength; in boulyng oftentimes to moche; wherby the sinewes be to moche strayned, and the vaines to moche chafed. Wherof often tymes is sene to ensue ache, or the decreas of strength or agilitie in the armes: where, in shotyng, if the shooter use the strength of his bowe within his owne tiller, he shal neuer be therwith grieued or made more feble.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although many sixteenth-century references to football are disapproving or dwell upon their dangers there are two notable departures from this view. First, Sir [[Thomas Elyot]] (although previously a critic of the game) advocates "footeball" as part of what he calls vehement exercise in his Castell of Helth published in 1534.&lt;ref&gt;Marples, Morris (1954). ''A History of Football'', Secker and Warburg, London, p66&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly English headmaster [[Richard Mulcaster]] provides in his 1581 publication the earliest evidence of organised, refereed football for small teams playing in formation.

The first reference to football in Ireland occurs in the ''[[Statute of Galway]]'' of 1527, which allowed the playing of football and archery but banned " 'hokie' — the [[hurling]] of a little ball with sticks or staves" as well as other sports. (The earliest recorded football match in Ireland was one between [[County Louth|Louth]] and [[County Meath|Meath]], at [[Slane]], in 1712.)

The oldest surviving ball that might have been used for football games dates to about 1540 and comes from Scotland. It is made from leather and a pig's bladder. It was discovered in 1981 in the roof structure of the Queen's Chamber, [[Stirling Castle]]. Whilst other uses for the ball, such as pallone, have been suggested, most notably by the [[National Museum of Scotland]], due to its size (diameter 14–16&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homecomingscotland2009.com/whats-on/oldest_football.html VisitScotland official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712214438/http://www.homecomingscotland2009.com/whats-on/oldest_football.html |date=12 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), staff at the Stirling Smith Museum and researchers at the Scottish Football Museum have attributed its use to football, citing the description of the ball used in the Carlisle Castle game of 1568.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithartgallery.demon.co.uk/collections.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720001436/http://www.smithartgallery.demon.co.uk/collections.html |archivedate=20 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inglis Simon; A Load of Old Balls, English Heritage, 2005, P20.&lt;/ref&gt;

The violence of early football in Scotland is made clear in this sixteenth-century poem on the "beauties of football":

{{quote|text=
&lt;poem&gt;Bruised muscles and broken bones
Discordant strife and futile blows
Lamed in old age, then cripled withal
These are the beauties of football
&lt;/poem&gt;|sign=Anonymous|source=translated from old Scots
}}

The earliest specific reference to football (pila pedalis) at a university comes in 1555 when it was outlawed at [[St John's College, Oxford]]. Similar decrees followed shortly after at other [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|Oxford Colleges]] and at [[Cambridge University]].

Another reference occurred in 1555, when Antonio Scaino published his treatise ''Del Giuoco della Palla'' (''On the Game of the Ball'').  It was mostly concerned with a medieval predecessor of tennis, but near the end, Scaino included a chapter titled, "Del Giuoco del Calcio" ("On the Game of Football"), for comparison.  According to Scaino, the game was popular with students.  It could be played with any number of players.  The only rules seem to be that weapons could not be brought onto the field, and the ball could not be thrown by hand.  The goal was for each team to try to cross the ball across a marked space at the opposite end of the field.  To start, the ball was placed in the middle of the field and kicked by a member of the team that was chosen by lots.  Scaino remarks that its chief entertainment for the spectators was to see "the players fall in great disarray &amp; upside down."&lt;ref&gt;Scaino, Antonio.  ''Trattato del Giuoco della Palla''.  Trans. P. A. Negretti.  London:  Raquetier Productions Ltd., 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1568 Sir [[Francis Knollys (the elder)|Francis Knollys]] described a football game played at [[Carlisle Castle]], [[Cumbria]], England by the retinue of Mary Queen of Scots: `20 of her retinue played at football before her for two hours very strongly, nimbly, and skilfully". According to contemporary sources and detailed publications Mary's retinue was predominantly Scottish, made up primarily by nobles who had followed her south in the aftermath of the Battle of Langside.&lt;ref&gt;Letter written by Sir Francis Knollys to Secretary Cecil, on 2 June 1568, and published in Anderson, James; Collections Relating to the History of Mary Queen of Scotland, Vol IV, Part I.

P827.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first official rules of [[Calcio Fiorentino]] (Florentine kick) were recorded in 1580, although the game had been developing around Florence for some time before that date. The game involved teams of 27 kicking and carrying a ball in a giant sandpit set up in the Piazza Santa Croce in the centre of Florence, both teams aiming for their designated point on the perimeter of the sandpit.&lt;ref&gt;Halpern, J. Balls and Blood, Sports Illustrated. Vol 109, No. 4: August 4, 2008, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1586, men from a ship commanded by English explorer [[John Davis (English explorer)|John Davis]], went ashore to play a form of football with [[Inuit]] (Eskimo) people in [[Greenland]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Hakluyt, [http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hakluyt/northwest/chapter8.html Voyages in Search of The North-West Passage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012191427/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/h/hakluyt/northwest/chapter8.html |date=12 October 2008 }}, ''[[University of Adelaide]]'', December 29, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Wales]], the game of ''[[cnapan]]'' was described at length by [[George Owen of Henllys]], an eccentric historian of [[Pembrokeshire]], in 1603:&lt;ref name="Celt"&gt;{{cite book |title=Sport in the making of Celtic cultures  |last=Jarvie |first=Grant |year=1999 |publisher=[[Leicester University Press]] |location=London |series=Sport and nation |isbn=0-7185-0129-2 |pages=58 and 73 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1EQyBEgYU5AC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=Cnapan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fdhPTd36B427hAeljsnyDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Cnapan&amp;f=false |accessdate=7 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hen rygbi"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of traditional British rural sports |last1=Collins |first1=Tony |authorlink1=Tony Collins (historian) |last2=Martin |first2=John |last3=Vamplew |first3=Wray |year=2005 |publisher=[[Routledge]] |location=Abingdon, Oxfordshire |series=Sports reference |isbn=0-415-35224-X |pages=66–67 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWu6sLJn7-kC&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=Cnapan&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5cxPTaq4PIyxhAemqKH5Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Cnapan&amp;f=false |accessdate=7 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;''"This game... is thought to be of great antiquity and is as followeth. The ancient Britons being naturally a warlike nation did no doubt for the exercise of their youth in time of peace and to avoid idleness devise games of activity where each man might show his natural prowess and agility...... About one or two of the clock afternoon begins the play, in this sort, after a cry made both parties draw to into some plain, all first stripped bare saving a light pair of breeches, bare-headed, bare-bodied, bare legs and feet....The foot company thus meeting, there is a round ball prepared of a reasonable quantity so as a man may hold it in his hand and no more, this ball is of some massy wood as box, yew, crab or holly tree and should be boiled in tallow for m make it slippery and hard to hold. This ball is called cnapan and is by one of the company hurling bolt upright into the air, and at the fall he that catches it hurls it towards the country he plays for, for goal or appointed place there is none neither needs any, for the play is not given over until the cnapan be so far carried that there is no hope to return it back that night, for the carrying of it a mile or two miles from the first place is no losing of the honour so it be still followed by the company and the play still maintained, it is oftentimes seen the chase to follow two miles and more..."''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The earliest account of a ball game that involves passing of the ball comes from [[Richard Carew (antiquary)|Richard Carew]]'s 1602 account of [[Cornish Hurling]] which states "Then must he cast the ball (named Dealing) to some one of his fellowes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.classic-literature.co.uk/british-authors/16th-century/richard-carew/the-survey-of-cornwall/ebook-page-63.asp|title=Richard Carew - The Survey of Cornwall Page 63|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carew also offers the earliest description of a goal (they pitch two bushes in the ground, some eight or ten foote asunder; and directly against them, ten or twelue score off,
other twayne in like distance, which they terme their Goales") and of goal keepers ("There is assigned for their gard, a couple of their best stopping Hurlers").

The first direct reference to ''scoring a goal'' is in [[John Day (dramatist)|John Day]]'s play ''[[The Blind Beggar of Bethnal Green]]'' (performed circa 1600; published 1659): "I'll play a gole at [[Camping (game)|camp-ball]]" (an extremely violent variety of football, which was popular in [[East Anglia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/spe/spe10.htm|title=Sports and Pastimes of the People of England: II. Rural Exercises Generally Practised: Chapter III|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly in a poem in 1613, [[Michael Drayton]] refers to "when the Ball to throw, And drive it to the Gole, in squadrons forth they goe".
In 1615 [[James I of England]] visited [[Wiltshire]] and the villagers "entertained his Majesty with a foot-ball match"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/nhwil10.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402233131/http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/docs/books/gutenberg/etext04/nhwil10.txt |archivedate=2 April 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oliver Cromwell]] who left [[Cambridge University]] in 1617 was described by [[James Heath (historian)|James Heath]] as "one of the chief matchmakers and players of football" during his time at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivercromwell.org/quotes2.htm|title=Oliver Cromwell - Quotes about Oliver Cromwell|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1623 [[Edmund Waller]] refers in one of his poems to "football" and alludes to teamwork and passing the ball: "They ply their feet, and still the restless ball, Toss'd to and fro, is urged by them all".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gutenberg.org/files/12322/12322-8.txt&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1650 [[Richard Baxer]] gives an interesting description of football in his book Everlasting Rest: "Alas, that I must stand by and see the Church, and Cause of Christ, like a Football in the midst of a crowd of Boys, tost about in contention from one to another.... and may drive it before him. ... But to be spurned about in the dirt, till they have driven it on to the goal of their private interests".&lt;ref name=Marples/&gt; This is noteworthy as it confirms that passing of the ball from one player to another was part of football games.

The first study of football as part of early sports is given in [[Francis Willughby]]'s Book of Games,
&lt;!-- [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN1859284604&amp;id=P-io9DcBllkC&amp;pg=PA168&amp;lpg=PA168&amp;vq=football&amp;dq=willughby+book+of+sports&amp;sig=qfpFofLjtqtwe0Y13Av4KZHvSA8] --&gt;
written in about 1660. This account is particularly noteworthy as he refers to football by its correct name in English and is the first to describe the following: modern goals and a pitch ("a close that has a gate at either end. The gates are called Goals"), tactics ("leaving some of their best players to guard the goal"), scoring ("they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win") and the way teams were selected ("the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness"). He is the first to describe a law of football: "They often break one another's shins when two meet and strike both together against the ball, and therefore there is a law that they must not strike higher than the ball". His account of the ball itself is also very informative: "They blow a strong bladder and tie the neck of it as fast as they can, and then put it into the skin of a bull's cod and sew it fast in". He adds: "The harder the ball is blown, the better it flies. They used to put quicksilver into it sometimes to keep it from lying still". His book includes the first (basic) diagram illustrating a football pitch.

==Present day games==

===England===
* [[Alnwick]] in [[Northumberland]]: the [[Scoring the Hales]] game survives and begins with the [[Duke of Northumberland]] dropping a ball from the battlements of Alnwick Castle.
* [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire|Ashbourne]] in [[Derbyshire]] (known as [[Royal Shrovetide Football]])
* [[Atherstone Ball Game]] in [[Warwickshire]]. The Shrove Tuesday Ball Game is played annually along the line of an old Roman road that runs through the town known as Long Street. The game has been played for over 800 years dating back the reign of [[John, King of England|King John]] 1166–1216
* [[Corfe Castle (village)|Corfe Castle]] in [[Dorset]] [[The Shrove Tuesday Football Ceremony of the Purbeck Marblers]]
* [[Haxey]] in [[Lincolnshire]] (the [[Haxey Hood]], actually played on [[Epiphany (feast)|Epiphany]]). In 1752 the [[Julian calendar]] was changed for the [[Gregorian calendar]]. To achieve this the days between 2 and 14 September were omitted that year. In some villages people thought it was not possible to remove 11 days from a year so refused to accept the new calendar. As a result, Christmas Day was celebrated on 5 January in those villages. The Haxey Hood is played the following day on what would have been the [[Saint Stephen|feast of Stephan]] or [[Boxing Day]] if 11 days had not been removed from the calendar. 
* [[Hurling the Silver Ball]] takes place at [[St Columb Major]] in [[Cornwall]]: A "Town against Country" match takes place on Shrove Tuesday and a return match is played the following Saturday. Another version of Cornish Hurling takes place at [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]]; this game used to involve men who lived at the top of town against those at the bottom end. Nowadays it is a much gentler version for children only. This version takes place on Feast Monday, normally February.
* [[Bottle-kicking]], [[Hallaton]], [[Leicestershire]]. A game played on [[Easter Monday]] which shares common elements with medieval ball games played during celebrations marked by the Christian calendar.
* [[Sedgefield]] [[Sedgefield Ball Game|Ball Game]] played in [[County Durham]] on Shrove Tuesday. 
* [[Workington]] in [[Cumbria]] holds three [[Uppies and Downies]] matches over the Easter period. There are no rules, except those suggested by cunning and skill, while brute force is of the greatest importance. The goals are about a mile apart. The Uppies attempt to hail the ball at the gates of [[Workington Hall]] while the Downies hail at the capstan at the harbour side.

===Scotland===
In Scotland the [[Ba game|Ba' game]] ("Ball Game") can be found at:
* [[Duns]], [[Berwickshire]]
* [[Hobkirk]], [[Scottish borders]]. Handba' game played the Monday before or after Shrove Tuesday. 
* [[Jedburgh]], [[Roxburghshire]]
* [[Scone, Perthshire]]
* [[Kirkwall]], [[Orkney]]

===Europe===

*''[[La Soule]]'' in Normandy and Brittany, France.
*[[Lelo burti]], a [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n game similar to rugby.

** [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[Twickenham]], [[Bushey]] and [[Hampton Wick]], all near London. "The custom was to carry a foot-ball from door to door and beg money:—at about 12 o'clock the ball was turned loose, and those who could would kick it. In the town of Kingston, all the shops are purposely kept shut upon that day, there were several balls in the town, and of course several parties. The game would last about four hours, when the parties retire to the public-houses, and spend the money they had collected on refreshments."[https://web.archive.org/web/20080105043230/http://www.uab.edu/english/hone/etexts/edb/day-pages/046-february15.html The Every-Day Book]

** [[Great Torrington|Torrington]] in [[Devon]] had [[Hurling the Silver Ball|Out-Hurling]]. "Once played on Trinity Monday, The sport of 'Out-hurling' was included in the 1922 Great Torrington Revel' Day. The publication Devon and Cornwall Notes and Queries 1922, volume 12, carried an account of the game, and noted that it had previously been a regular sport, and involved a small ball which was thrown 'over-hand', and a pitch approximately half a mile long (adjoining a brook)."[https://web.archive.org/web/20070502184910/http://users.senet.com.au/~dewnans/folklore__customs_and_traditions.html Folklore, Culture, Customs and Language of Devon]

The connection with megalithic art infers these carved stone balls had significant cultural importance to the pre-Celtic people who made them. They thought in a symbolic way and displayed ceremonial behaviour we may look upon today as religious. No written records exist for the [[Neolithic British Isles|Neolithic people]] of Britain and Ireland. From reading the [[archaeology]] it has not been possible to determine whether these [[Prehistoric Britain|peoples]] understood the concept of a ball game. However, as playing ball games feature in later religious festivities including [[Christmastide]] which coincides with [[Yule]]tide, the winter solstice and the [[The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles|Pagan]] rebirth of the sun the possibility cannot be ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/Britain-home-of-football.html|title=History of Football - Britain, the home of Football - FIFA.com|first=|last=FIFA.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mexicana Universal''' is a national [[beauty pageant]] in [[Mexico]] held annually since 1994. It is currently responsible for selecting the country's delegates to [[Miss Universe]] and [[Miss International]] as well as minor pageant as [[Reina Hispanoamericana]].

In association with [[Televisa]], the Nuestra Belleza México pageant and organization of the same name is directed by the nation's first Miss Universe titleholder, [[Lupita Jones]] ([[Miss Universe 1991|1991]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esmas.com/nuestrabellezav2/biografia/ Nuetra Belleza Mexico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125092335/http://www.esmas.com/nuestrabellezav2/biografia/ |date=25 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has produced one Miss Universe ([[Miss Universe 2010|2010]]) – the second title for Mexico in that event, and two Miss International winners, [[Miss International 2007|2007]] and [[Miss International 2009|2009]].

==Contestants==
Aspiring hopefuls, ranging from 18 to 23 years of age and a minimum height of {{height|m=1.68|precision=0}}, must fulfill the organization's additional requirements and  	
consequently vie in their respective [[Political divisions of Mexico|state]] pageants for eligibility to participate in Nuestra Belleza México.&lt;ref name="FAQ"&gt;[http://www.esmas.com/nuestrabellezav2/faqs/ Nuestra Belleza Mexico – FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; Contestants are permitted to compete for their sub-national beauty titles more than once. However, this can no longer be done once they have taken part in the national event. They may also choose to represent a different state, as long as they provide proof of having resided in it for at least the last twelve months before registration.

As of the year [[Nuestra Belleza México 2000|2000]]'s edition of the pageant, it is not uncommon for some states to have more than one delegate competing simultaneously. This occurs when non-winning hopefuls from select subdivisions are invited (designated) by the organization to partake in the nationwide competition, taking into consideration their potential, and to possibly make up for other states which may lack representation. Usually three or four are designated annually.&lt;ref name=FAQ/&gt;

Once in the national concentration, the participants engage in various events and appearances prior to the crucial preliminary competition from which a number of semi-finalists are chosen, only to be announced during the final competition. Additionally, five special awards given through sub-challenges enable the recipients an automatic pass to the semi-finals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esmas.com/nuestrabellezav2/premios_especiales/ Nuestra Belleza Mexico – Premios Especiales]&lt;/ref&gt; During the crowning night, the semi-finalists are evaluated by a panel of judges while vying in swimsuit and evening gown, with eliminations taking place after each of these rounds. The remaining contestants are subsequently interviewed, and the runners-up and winners are respectively announced at the conclusion of the Nuestra Belleza México telecast.

If any of the titleholders is unable to fulfill her duties, the next in turn, known as the ''suplente'' (substitute), assumes the right to represent the country abroad. The pageant, which sees over thirty of the country's most beautiful young women going head to head each year, is held a year prior to when the winners compete internationally, giving them sufficient time to prepare for their corresponding beauty events.

==Titleholders==
Below are the names of the annual titleholders of Nuestra Belleza México, the states they represented and the venue which played host to their crowning, in ascending order. Titleholders whose names appear highlighted went on to win a major international pageant. For further details, see the [[Nuestra Belleza México#Representatives at major international pageants|representatives at major international pageants]] section.

===Replaced delegates===
The Nuestra Belleza México contestants below were slated to participate in an international pageant, but were unable to go through with it for one reason or another. And thus, they were eventually replaced.

==State Tally==
Anyone who follows the [[Olympic Games]] or other sporting events will be familiar with the concept of the Medal Table, which ranks countries based on their first (gold), second (silver) and third (bronze) place finishes. Below is a similar table of the top rankings for the Nuestra Belleza Mexico pageant, but of the thirty-two Mexican states, based on all results from the first event in 1994 to the most recent competition.

'''''Misunderstood''''' ({{lang-it|'''Incompreso'''}}) is a 1966 Italian [[drama film]] directed by [[Luigi Comencini]]. It was entered into the [[1967 Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="festival-cannes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/2787/year/1967.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Misunderstood |accessdate=8 March 2009|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Duncombe is the UK Consul General in [[Florence]], Italy.  He becomes a widower when his two sons, Andrew and Miles, are still children.  Andrew, the eldest, apparently reacts with adult maturity to the loss of his mother, looking after little Miles, an attempt to find a way out of such premature heart-crushing loss.  Miles constantly blames Andrew for his mischievous behavior but his brother valiantly takes said blame as his personality is that of a grown up, or at least that is what he tries to be.  The father, given his mandate, is often absent, both physically and emotionally, especially toward Andrew.  It will be at the end that Duncombe will acknowledge his mistakes when finding himself at a father's point of no return.

[[File:Virgin Atlantic Varga Girl.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Virgin Atlantic A340-600 G-VGAS nose art]]

'''Nose art''' is a decorative [[painting]] or design on the [[fuselage]] of an [[aircraft]], usually on the front fuselage.

While begun for practical reasons of identifying friendly units, the practice evolved to express the individuality often constrained by the uniformity of the military, to evoke memories of home and peacetime life, and as a kind of psychological protection against the stresses of war and the probability of death. The appeal, in part, came from nose art not being officially approved, even when the regulations against it were not enforced.&lt;ref name="parentseyes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ethell, Jeffrey L. The History of Aircraft Nose Art: World War I to Today. Osceola, Wisconsin: Motorbooks International, 1991, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its individual and unofficial nature, it is considered [[folk art]], inseparable from work as well as representative of a group.&lt;ref name="parentseyes"/&gt; It can also be compared to sophisticated [[graffiti]]. In both cases, the artist is often [[Anonymity|anonymous]], and the art itself is [[ephemeral]]. In addition, it relies on materials immediately available.&lt;ref name="parentseyes"/&gt;

Nose art is largely a military tradition, but civilian airliners operated by the [[Virgin Group]] feature "Virgin Girls" on the nose as part of their [[Aircraft livery|livery]]. In a broad sense, the tail art of several airlines such as the [[Eskimo]] of [[Alaska Airlines]] can be called "nose art", as are the tail markings of present-day [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] squadrons. There were exceptions, including the [[VIII Bomber Command]], [[301st Air Refueling Wing|301st Bomb Group]] B-17F "Whizzer", which had its girl-riding-a-bomb on the dorsal fin.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers, Peter M.

==History==
{{repetition|section|date=September 2015}}
[[File:FBaracca 1.jpg|thumb|Count [[Francesco Baracca]] and his [[Société Pour L'Aviation et ses Dérivés|SPAD]] [[SPAD S.VII|S.VII]], with the ''cavallino rampante'' that inspired the [[Ferrari]] emblem]]
[[File:94th Aero Squadron - Capt Edward V Rickenbacker.jpg|thumb|[[Eddie Rickenbacker]] with SPAD XIII (note the "Hat in the Ring" 94th Aero Squadron insignia), France, 1918]]
[[File:95th Aero Squadron - SPAD XIII.jpg|thumb|right|Spad XIII pursuit aircraft of the 95th Aero Squadron with the "Kicking Mule" insignia, France, 1918]]

Placing personalized decorations on fighting aircraft began with [[Italy|Italian]] and [[Germany|German]] pilots. The first recorded piece of nose art was a sea monster painted on an Italian [[flying boat]] in 1913. This was followed by the popular practice of painting a mouth beneath the [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]]'s spinner, begun by German pilots in [[World War I]].  The ''cavallino rampante'' (prancing horse) of the Italian [[Flying ace|ace]] [[Francesco Baracca]] was another well-known image. Nose art of that era was often conceived and produced not by the pilots, but rather by the aircraft ground crews.

Other World War I examples included the "Hat in the Ring" of the American [[1st Operations Group#1st Pursuit Group|94th Aero Squadron]] (attributed to Lt. Johnny Wentworth)&lt;ref name="afhra"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afhra.af.mil/|title=Air Force Historical Research Agency - Home|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the "Kicking Mule" of the [[1st Operations Group#1st Pursuit Group|95th Aero Squadron]]. This followed the official policy, established by the [[American Expeditionary Forces]]' (AEF) Chief of the Air Service, [[Brigadier General]] [[Benjamin Foulois]], on 6 May 1918, requiring the creation of distinct, readily identifiable squadron insignia.&lt;ref name="afhra"/&gt; What is perhaps the most famous of all nose art, the shark-face insignia made famous by the First [[American Volunteer Group]] (AVG, the [[Flying Tigers]]), first appeared in World War I on a British [[Sopwith Dolphin]] and a German [[Roland C.II]], though often with an effect more comical than menacing.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Richard. Sharkmouth, 1916-1945. New York: Arco, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Three decades later, the British pilots spotted it on German planes during World War II.&lt;ref name="Eisel, Braxton"&gt;Eisel, Braxton. ''[http://www.afhso.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-101028-007.pdf The Flying Tigers: Chennault's American Volunteer Group in China]''. Washington, D.C.: Air Force History and Museums Program, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The AVG in China decided to paint shark mouths on their P-40Bs after seeing a color photo in a newspaper of a shark mouth painted on a [[No. 112 Squadron RAF]] P-40 fighter in [[North African Campaign|North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rossi |first=Dick |url=http://www.flyingtigersavg.22web.org/tiger2.htm |title=A Flying Tigers Story |date=1980s |work=The Flying Tigers - American Volunteer Group - Chinese Air Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British version itself was inspired by "sharkmouth" nose art (without any eyes) on the [[Messerschmitt|Bf 110]] heavy fighters of [[Zerstörergeschwader 76|ZG 76]].

[[File:Hells Angels, Flying Tigers 1942.jpg|thumb|Hell's Angels, the 3rd Squadron of the 1st American Volunteer Group "Flying Tigers", 28 May 1942]]

While World War I nose art was usually embellished or extravagant [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] insignia, true nose art appeared during [[World War II]], which is considered by many observers to be the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of the genre, with both [[Axis powers|Axis]] and [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] pilots taking part. At the height of the war, nose-artists were in very high demand in the [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] and were paid quite well for their services while AAF commanders tolerated nose art in an effort to boost aircrew morale. The U.S. Navy, by contrast, prohibited nose art, the most extravagant being limited to a few simply-lettered names, while nose art was uncommon in the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] or [[Royal Canadian Air Force|RCAF]].

The work was done by professional civilian artists as well as talented amateur servicemen. In 1941, for instance, the [[39th Pursuit Squadron]] commissioned a [[Bell Aircraft]] artist to design and paint the "[[P-39 Airacobra|Cobra]] in the Clouds" [[logo]] on their aircraft.&lt;ref name="histsum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cobraintheclouds.com/39thorganization/39thhistory.html|title=Military Flying, CHOCKIE 39th History|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most enduring nose art of World War II was the shark-face [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]], which first appeared on the [[Messerschmitt Bf 110|Bf 110s]] of [[Luftwaffe]] [[Zerstörergeschwader 76|76th Destroyer Wing]] over [[Crete]], where the twin-engined Messerschmitts outmatched the [[Gloster Gladiator]] biplanes of [[RAF]] [[No. 112 Squadron RAF|112 Squadron]]. The Commonwealth pilots were withdrawn to Egypt and refitted with [[Curtiss P-40|Curtiss Tomahawks]] off the same assembly line building fighter aircraft for the AVG Flying Tigers being recruited for service in [[China]]. In November 1941, AVG pilots saw a 112 Squadron Tomahawk in an illustrated weekly and immediately adopted the shark-face motif for their own planes. This work was done by the pilots and ground crew in the field.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Daniel. Flying Tigers: Claire Chennault and His American Volunteers, 1941-1942. Washington, DC: Harper Collins-Smithsonian Books, 2007, pp. 82-83.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the insignia for the "Flying Tigers" - a winged Bengal Tiger jumping through a stylized V for Victory symbol - was developed by graphic artists from the Walt Disney Company.&lt;ref name="Eisel, Braxton" /&gt;

The 75th Expeditionary Fighter Squadron moved.jpg|thumb|left|A-10 Thunderbolt II with shark mouth themed nose art, Kandahar Airfield, Afghanistan, 2011]]
Similarly, when in 1943 the [[39th Fighter Squadron]] became the first American [[Squadron (aviation)|squadron]] in their [[theatre (warfare)|theatre]] with 100 kills, they adopted the shark-face for their [[P-38 Lightning]]s.&lt;ref name="histsum"/&gt; The shark-face is still used to this day, most commonly seen on the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] (with its gaping maw leading up to the muzzle of the aircraft's GAU-8 Avenger 30mm cannon), especially those of the [[23d Fighter Group]], the AVG's descendent unit, and a testament to its popularity as a form of nose art.

The largest known work of nose art ever depicted on a WWII-era American combat aircraft was on a [[B-24J Liberator]], tail number ''44-40973'', which had been named "The Dragon and his Tail" of the [[USAAF]] [[Fifth Air Force]] [[64th Bombardment Squadron|64th Bomb Squadron]], [[43d Bombardment Group|43d Bomb Group]], in the [[South West Pacific theatre of World War II|Southwest Pacific]], flown by a crew led by Joseph Pagoni, with Staff Sergeant Sarkis Bartigan as the artist.  The dragon artwork ran from the nose just forward of the cockpit, down the entire length of the fuselage's sides, with the dragon's body depicted directly below and just aft of the cockpit, with the dragon holding a nude woman in its forefeet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kensmen.com/64b2.html|title=From the 64th Squadron Briefing Room|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kensmen.com/64b14.html|title=From the 64th Squadron Briefing Room|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Starcer]] was the resident artist for the [[91st Bombardment Group|91st Bomb Group (Heavy)]], one of the initial six groups fielded by the [[Eighth Air Force]]. Starcer painted over a hundred pieces of renowned B-17 nose art, including [[Memphis Belle (aircraft)|"Memphis Belle"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.91stbombgroup.com/nose_artists/starcer.html|title=Tony Starcer - Nose Artist - 91st BG|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usaaf-noseart.co.uk/starcer-tony.htm|title=USAAF Nose Art Research Project - Named planes of the USAAF during WWII|author=Mark Bowden|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A commercial artist named Brinkman, from [[Chicago]] was responsible for the [[Zodiac#Western zodiac|zodiac]]-themed nose art of the [[B-24 Liberator]]-equipped [[834th Bombardment Squadron|834th Bomb Squadron]], based at [[RAF Sudbury]], England.&lt;ref name="Valant"&gt;Valant, Gary M. Classic Vintage Nose Art. Ann Arbor, Michigan: Lowe and B. Hould, 1997, pp. 13-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemporary research demonstrates that bomber crews, which suffered high casualty rates during World War II, often developed strong bonds with the planes they were flying, and affectionately decorated them with nose art.&lt;ref&gt;Pfau, Ann Elizabeth. Miss Yourlovin: GIs, Gender and Domesticity During World War II. New York, N.Y.: Columbia University Press, 2008. Available at Gutenberg-e, a program of the American Historical Association and Columbia University Press: [http://www.gutenberg-e.org/pfau/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also believed by the flight crews that the nose art was bringing luck to the planes.&lt;ref&gt;Polmar, Norman, and Thomas B. Allen. World War II: The Encyclopedia of the War Years, 1941-1945. New York: Random House, 1996, p. 595.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artistic work of [[Alberto Vargas]]'s pin-up girls from ''Esquire'' Magazine was often duplicated, or adapted,  by air force crews and painted on the nose of American and allied aircraft during World War II.

[[File:KC-135E Stratotanker with patriotic nose art-1447cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Boeing KC-135E Stratotanker, based with Sioux City Air National Guard, 2007.]]
Some World War II era nose art was commemorative or intended to honor certain people such as the [[B-29 Superfortress]], "The [[Ernie Pyle]]".&lt;ref&gt;Superfort "Ernie Pyle", Gift of Plane Plane Workers, Here En Route to Japan [http://www.chassis-plans.com/Wing-Tips-Article_Ernie_Pyle_B29.pdf PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Korean War]], nose art was popular with units operating [[A-26 Invader|A-26]] and [[B-29]] bombers, [[C-119 Flying Boxcar]] transports, as well as USAF [[Ground-attack aircraft|fighter-bombers]].&lt;ref
name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Warren E. Heavy Hauler. ''Wings of Fame, The Journal of Classic Combat Aircraft'',  Volume 20. London, United Kingdom: Aerospace Publishing Ltd., 2000, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to changes in military policies and changing attitudes toward the representation of women, the amount of nose art declined after the [[Korean War]].

During the [[Vietnam War]], [[Lockheed AC-130|AC-130 gunships]] of the [[List of United States Air Force special operations squadrons|U.S. Air Force Special Operations Squadrons]] were often given names with accompanying nose art - for example, "Thor", "Azrael - Angel of Death", "Ghost Rider", "War Lord" and "The Arbitrator." &lt;ref&gt;[[Lars Olausson|Olausson, Lars]]. Lockheed Hercules Production List - 1954-2011 - 27th ed. Såtenäs, Sweden, April 2009. (Self-published.)&lt;/ref&gt; The unofficial gunship badge of a flying skeleton with a [[Minigun]] was also applied to many aircraft until the end of the war and was later adopted officially.

Nose art underwent a revival during the [[Gulf War]] and has become more common since [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] and the [[Iraq War]] began. Many crews are merging artwork as part of camouflage patterns. The United States Air Force had unofficially sanctioned the return of the pin-up (albeit fully clothed) with the [[Strategic Air Command]] permitting nose art on its bomber force in the Command's last years. The continuation of historic names such as "[[Memphis Belle (aircraft)|Memphis Belle]]" was encouraged.

==Regional variation==

Source material for American nose art was varied, ranging from [[Pin-up girl|pinups]] such as [[Rita Hayworth]] and [[Betty Grable]] and [[cartoon]] characters such as [[Donald Duck]], [[Bugs Bunny]], and [[Popeye]] to patriotic characters ([[Yankee Doodle]]) and fictional heroes ([[Sam Spade]]). Lucky symbols such as [[dice]] and [[playing cards]] also inspired nose art, along with references to mortality such as the [[Death (personification)|Grim Reaper]].&lt;ref name="parentseyes"/&gt; Cartoons and pinups were most popular among American artists, but other works included animals, nicknames, hometowns, and popular song and movie titles. Some nose art and slogans imposed contempt to the enemy, especially to enemy leaders.

The farther the planes and crew were from headquarters or from the public eye, the racier the art tended to be.&lt;ref name="parentseyes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/militarynoseart/|title=Military Aircraft Nose Art|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, nudity was more common in nose art on aircraft in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific]] than on aircraft in [[European Theatre of World War II|Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohan, Phil. "Risque Business." Air and Space, 5 (Apr.-May 1990), p.65.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-382-0211-011, Flugzeug Messerschmitt Me 110.jpg|thumb|"Sharkmouth" [[Messerschmitt|Bf 110]]C of [[Zerstörergeschwader 76|ZG 76]], May 1940 ]]
''Luftwaffe'' aircraft did not often display nose art, but there were exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;Ketley, Barry. Luftwaffe emblems. Manchester: Flight Recorder Publications, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Mickey Mouse]] adorned a [[Condor Legion]] Bf-109 during the Spanish Civil War and one Ju 87A was decorated with a large pig inside a white circle during the same period. [[Adolf Galland]]'s Bf-109E-3 of [[Jagdgeschwader 26|JG 26]] also had a depiction of Mickey Mouse, holding a [[Candlestick telephone|contemporary telephone]] in his hands, in mid-1941. A Ju 87B-1 (''Geschwaderkennung'' of S2+AC) of Stab II/St. G 77, piloted by Major Alfons Orthofer and based in Breslau-Schöngarten (today [[Copernicus Airport Wrocław]]) during the [[invasion of Poland]], was painted with a shark's mouth, and some Bf 110s were decorated with furious wolf's heads, stylistic [[wasp]]s (as with [[SKG 210]] and [[ZG 1]]), or as in the case of [[ZG 76]], the very shark mouths that inspired both the RAF's 112 Squadron and in turn the Flying Tigers in China, on their noses or engine covers. Another example was [[Erich Hartmann]]'s Bf-109G-14, "Lumpi", with an eagle's head. The fighter wing [[Jagdgeschwader 54]] was known as the ''Grünherz'' (Green Hearts) after their fuselage emblem, a large green heart. The Geschwader was originally formed in [[Thuringia|Thüringen]], nicknamed "the green heart of Germany". Perhaps the flashiest Luftwaffe nose art was the red and white [[Viperidae|viper]] snake insignia running through the whole fuselage of certain [[Ju 87]] Stukas that served with the II ''Gruppe'', and especially the 6. ''Staffel'' of [[Sturzkampfgeschwader 2|StG 2]] in North Africa, the only known artwork on an Axis-flown combat aircraft that could have rivaled the length of that on "The Dragon and his Tail" B-24.

The [[Soviet Air Force]] also decorated their planes with historical images, mythical beasts, and patriotic [[slogan]]s.

The attitude of the [[Finnish Air Force]] to the nose art varied by unit. Some units disallowed nose art, while others tolerated it. Generally, the Finnish airforce nose art was humorous or satirical, such as the "horned Stalin" on Maj. Maunula's [[Curtiss P-36]].

The [[Japan Air Self-Defense Force]] has decorated fighter aircraft with [[Valkyrie]]-themed characters under the names ''Mystic Eagle'' and ''Shooting Eagle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rose-ridge.com/NOSE%20ART%20WORKS.htm|title=NOSEART-WORKS|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2011, the [[Japan Ground Self-Defense Force]] has [[AH-1 Cobra|AH-1S Cobra]] anti-tank helicopters and [[Kawasaki OH-1]] observation helicopter named ''Ita-Cobra'' and ''Ita-Omega'' respectively, decorated in the theme of 4 [[Kisarazu]] (木更津) sisters (Akane (木更津茜), Aoi (木更津葵), Wakana (木更津若菜), Yuzu (木更津柚子)).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otakumode.com/news/51a149bf8ccdf39e1300d1e4/The-Four-Sisters-of-the-Fourth-Anti-Tank-Helicopter-Squad-are-Celebrated-One-Last-Time!|title=The Four Sisters of the Fourth Anti-Tank Helicopter Squad are Celebrated One Last Time!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aoi-chan first appeared in 2011, followed by the other three sisters in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.vice.com/article/the-japanese-military-is-getting-offensively-cute|title=The Japanese Military Is Getting Offensively Cute|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rocketnews24.com/2012/10/19/japans-armed-forces-show-their-playful-side-moe-style-attack-helicopter-wows-crowds/|title=Japan’s Armed Forces Show Their Playful Side: Moé-Style Attack Helicopter Wows Crowds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canadian Forces]] were reported having nose art on [[CH-47 Chinook|CH-47D Chinook]] and [[CH-146 Griffon]] helicopters in [[Canada's role in the invasion of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/04/canadian-chopper-crews-revive-nose-art.html|title=Canadian chopper crews revive nose-art tradition in Afghanistan ~ ASIAN DEFENCE|publisher=|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Famous examples==
[[Adolf Galland]] was famous for painting [[Mickey Mouse]] on his aircraft, and the mascot was adopted by his ''Gruppe'' during the early airwar phase of [[World War II]].

[[Werner Mölders]] flew a yellow-nosed [[Messerschmitt Bf 109 variants#F-0, F-1, F-2|Bf 109F-2]] while with [[JG 51]] during June 1941.

Other fighter aces and their nose art have become synonymous.

* [[Don Gentile]]'s [[P-51 Mustang|P-51]]C named "Shangri-La", with an eagle sporting boxing gloves.
* [[John D. Landers]]' P-51D, which sported a distinctive black-and-white checkerboard with red trim.
* [[Chuck Yeager]]'s series of aircraft named "Glamorous Glennis", with bright letter art.
* [[Ian Gleed]]'s [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricanes]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfires]] featured Figaro the Cat, from the 1940 Disney animated movie ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]''.
* [[Pierre Clostermann]]'s [[Hawker Tempest]] ''Le Grand Charles'' featured the [[Cross of Lorraine]].
* [[Johnnie Johnson (RAF officer)|Johnny Johnson]]'s [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire IX]] featured the Canadian [[maple leaf]].
* [[Erich Hartmann]]'s [[Bf 109]]s featured a distinctive "black tulip" design on the very front of the [[cowling]], immediately behind the spinner.
* [[James MacLachlan]], who flew with an artificial arm, had his [[Hawker Hurricane]] adorned with a picture of his amputated arm giving a [[V sign]]
* [[Brendan Finucane]]'s Spitfires wore a shamrock with a "B" within it. Ireland's top ace in World War Two who also was the youngest wing commander in Royal Air Force history.

The markings of aces were often adopted by their squadrons, such as Galland's Mickey Mouse and Hartmann's black tulip (still in use until recently on the aircraft of [[Taktisches Luftwaffengeschwader 71 "Richthofen"|JG 71 "Richthofen"]] - not known to be in use on the unit's  new Eurofighter Typhoons).

[[Ted W. Lawson]], who (along with journalist [[Bob Considine]]) famously wrote about the 1942 [[Doolittle Raid]] in ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'', piloted a [[B-25 Mitchell]] bomber nicknamed ''The Ruptured Duck'', after a minor training accident in which the [[Tailstrike|aircraft tail scraped the ground]] during takeoff; this was decorated by a [[caricature]] of an angry Donald Duck figure with crutches and wearing a pilot's headphones.

==Similar art==
Designs similar to aviation nose art could be found during World War II on some British torpedo boats, and German and US submarines.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Bans==
The British [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|MoD]] banned the use of [[pin-up girl|pin-up women]] in nose art on Royal Air Force aircraft in 2007, as commanders decided the images (many containing naked women), were inappropriate and potentially offensive to female personnel, although there were no documented complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-460054/PC-brigade-ban-pin-ups-RAF-jets--case-offend-women-Muslims.html PC brigade ban pin-ups on RAF jets - in case they offend women and Muslims] Mail Online, Jun 26 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the United States Air Force Air Mobility Command ordered that all nose art should be gender-neutral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deseretnews.com/article/300875/MILITARY-AIRPLANES-GET-NEW-GENDER-NEUTRAL-LOOK.html Military Airplanes Get New Gender-neutral Look], Steve Fide, Dezeret news, July 20, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>Changed interior to exterior.  The nerve is on the outside of the leg, not the inside.  The inside is the femoral nerve.</comment>

A '''peroneal strike''' is a temporarily disabling [[strike (attack)|blow]] to the [[common peroneal nerve]] of the leg, just above the [[knee]]. The attacker aims roughly a [[hand]] span above the exterior side of the knee, towards the back of the leg. This causes a temporary loss of [[motor control]] of the leg, accompanied by [[numbness|numbness and a painful tingling sensation]] from the point of impact all the way down the leg, usually lasting anywhere from 30 seconds to 5 minutes in duration.

The strike is commonly made with the knee, a [[Club (weapon)|baton]], or [[shin kick]], but can be done by anything forcefully impacting the nerve. The technique is a part of the [[pressure point]] control tactics used in [[martial art]]s and by [[law enforcement agent]]s.

This strike is similar to and utilizes the same nerve as the childhood [[prank]] of "dead-legging" someone. Repeated strong peroneal strikes can cause nerve damage and have a high chance of damaging the surrounding tissues due to the spontaneous nature of the technique and the nerve location.{{Citation needed|reason=Please give a reliable source for this assertion. Pressure Point Control Tactics/Training (PPCT) which is "Legally and medically acceptable" and deemed safe uses this nerve motor point.|date=August 2011}}

The peroneal strike was used against [[detainee]]s during the 2002 [[Bagram torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal.&lt;ref&gt;Rashid, Ahmed. ''Descent into Chaos: The U.S. and the Disaster in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Central Asia''. 2008. New York: Viking Penguin, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

(2010). Photovoice: A review of the literature in health and public health. Health Education &amp; Behavior, 37(3), 424-451.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Photovoice was developed in 1992 by Caroline C. Wang of the [[University of Michigan]], and Mary Ann Burris, Program Officer for Women's Health at the Ford Foundation headquartered in Beijing, China. The idea was built on the foundation that images and words together can effectively express communities and individual's needs, problems, and desires.&lt;ref name="Nykiforuk 103–124"/&gt; In addition, the concept was strongly influenced by [[documentary photography]], the concept [[empowerment]], [[feminist theory]], [[Paulo Freire]]'s [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]] to promote health education and his idea of [[critical consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, N., &amp; Bernstein, E. (1988). Empowerment Education: Freire's Ideas Adapted to Health Education. Health Education &amp; Behavior, 15(4), 379-394. {{doi|10.1177/109019818801500402}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strack RW, Magill C., &amp; McDonagh, K.|first=|date=|title=Engaging youth through Photovoice|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/R_Strack_Engaging_2004.pdf|journal=Health Promotion Practice|volume=5|pages=49–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photovoice was first used to empower the silenced rural women in Yunnan Province, China to influence the policies and programs affecting them.&lt;ref&gt;Wang, C., &amp; Burris, M. A. (1994). Empowerment through Photo Novella: Portraits of Participation. Health Education &amp; Behavior, 21(2), 171-186. {{doi|10.1177/109019819402100204}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Since then, the method has been used in different settings and populations, such as by refugees in San Diego seeking in–person medical interpretation options, by homeless adults in [[Ann Arbor]], [[Michigan]], by Dr. Claudia Mitchell to support community health workers and teachers in rural [[South Africa]], and by Dr. Laura S. Lorenz of the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University in her work with brain injury survivors.&lt;ref name="photovoice with brain injury survivors"&gt;Lorenz, LS (2010) "Brain Injury Survivors: Narratives of Rehabilitation and Healing." Disability in Society, Ronald J. Berger, Series Editor. Boulder, CO and London: Lynne Rienner Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://libres.uncg.edu/ir/uncg/f/R_Strack_Engaging_2004.pdf|title=Engaging Youth through Photovoice |last=Strack |first=Robert |date= |website= |archive-url= |archive-date= |dead-url= |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern implementation==
In the 21st century, some university professors have used the photovoice model to teach social work students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=08ef2abd-236a-4cf8-87b0-615ee0f10996%40sessionmgr4001&amp;vid=3&amp;hid=4101 | title=Using Photo Voice to Teach Social Issues With Undergraduate Social Work Students | author=Oden, Melissa | journal=Texas Public Health Journal |date=September 2013 | volume=65 | issue=4 | pages=7–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photovoice has also been used in conjunction with collaging, drawing, and mapping in participatory studies which focus on the voice of participants and aim to make the familiar strange.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;Mannay, D. 2013. ‘Who put that on there... why why why?:’ Power games and participatory techniques of visual data production. Visual Studies, 28 (2), pp.136-146 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1472586X.2013.801635&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it has been used as a tool to engage children and youth, giving them a safe environment and opportunity to communicate their concerns and coping strategies to policymakers and service providers.&lt;ref&gt;Skovdal, M. (2011) “Picturing the coping strategies of caregiving children in Western Kenya: from images to action.” American Journal of Public Health 101(3): 452-453&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In other words, photovoice is used at all levels as a tool for self-development, sharing awareness, advocacy, research, needs assessment, monitoring, etc. So the use of photovoice allows one to capture and widen their perspective on all levels of various issues.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Variants==
Also known as "participatory photography" or "photo novella", photovoice is considered a sub–type of "[[participatory art|participatory visual methods]]" or '''picturevoice''' which includes techniques such as photo-elicitation and digital storytelling. These techniques allow research participants to create visuals that capture their individual perspectives as part of the research process.&lt;ref name="sophe"&gt;"Picturevoice: Health Communication Through Art." Presentation. [[Society for Public Health Education]] 60th Annual Meeting. Philadelphia, PA. November 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="participatory visual methods"&gt;Lorenz, LS and B Kolb (2009). Involving the public through participatory visual research methods. Health Expectations, Volume 12, Issue 3, pp 262-274.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is found in [[Project Lives]], a participatory photography project used to create a new image of project housing dwellers, published in April 2015. Two other forms of picturevoice include '''paintvoice''', stemming from the work of Michael Yonas, and '''comicvoice''', which has been pioneered by John Baird's ''[[Create a Comic Project]]'' since 2008, and to a lesser extent by Michael Bitz's ''[[Comic Book Project]]''.&lt;ref name="apha"&gt;"Healthy Holidays: Lessons Learned from a Community Education Event." Presentation. [[American Public Health Association]] 137th Annual Meeting. Philadelphia, PA. November 11, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCA1"&gt;"Comicvoice: Community education through sequential art." Pop Culture Association - American Culture Association, St. Louis, MO. (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==International development==
In international research, photovoice has been seen to allow participants from the developing world to define how they want to be represented to the international community. The individuals are facilitated and given control to tell their stories and perspectives which empower them to be engaged and maintain a firm sense of authorship over their representations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This helps to convey a stereotype-free picture of what it means to live in a [[developing country]] to those supporting (i.e. funders and voters of the [[developed country]]) and doing international development (i.e. [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] and [[Government agency|government agencies]]).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Skovdal, M., Cornish, F., (2015) "Qualitative Research for Development: A guide for practitioners" Rugby, UK: Practical Action Publishing (Chapter 6 - Photovoice: Methodology and Use)&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, photovoice allows the community to monitor the impact of the change created by development programs.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; This can help inform the outside agency about the process, true impacts (what is/isn't working and why), and complex reality,&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://photovoice.org/matt-daw-participation-in-development/|title=PhotoVoice   » Participation in Development|website=photovoice.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus accompany wider and deeper research and analysis to improve the development progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://photovoice.org/international-projects/|title=PhotoVoice   » International Projects|website=photovoice.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Antoninus Pius Coin pieta.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|''Pietas'', as a virtue of the emperor [[Antoninus Pius]], represented by a woman offering a sacrifice on the reverse of this [[sestertius]]]]

'''''Pietas''''', translated variously as "duty", "religiosity"&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Williams, "Religion and Roman Coins," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt; or "religious behavior",&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Belayche, "Religious Actors in Daily Life: Practices and Related Beliefs," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; "loyalty",&lt;ref&gt;Frank Bernstein, "Complex Rituals: Games and Processions in Republican Rome," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; "devotion", or "[[filial piety]]" (English "piety" derives from the Latin), was one of the chief [[virtue]]s among the [[ancient Roman]]s. It was the distinguishing virtue of the [[Founding of Rome|founding]] hero [[Aeneas]], who is often given the [[adjective|adjectival]] epithet ''pius'' ("religious") throughout [[Virgil]]'s epic ''[[Aeneid]]''. The sacred nature of ''pietas'' was embodied by the divine personification Pietas, a goddess often pictured on Roman coins. The Greek equivalent is ''[[eusebeia]]'' (εὐσέβεια).&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Rufus Fears]], "The Cult of Virtues and Roman Imperial Ideology," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), pp. 864–865.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cicero]] defined ''pietas'' as the virtue "which admonishes us to do our duty to our country or our parents or other blood relations."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De inventione'' 2.22.66 ''(pietatem,  quae erga patriam aut parentes aut alios sanguine coniunctos officium conservare moneat)'', as quoted by [[Hendrik Wagenvoort]], ''Pietas: Selected Studies in Roman Religion'' (Brill, 1980), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; The man who possessed ''pietas'' "performed all his duties towards the deity and his fellow human beings fully and in every respect," as the 19th-century classical scholar [[Georg Wissowa]] described it.&lt;ref&gt;As quoted by Wagenvort, ''Pietas,'' p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As virtue==
''Pietas erga parentes'' ("''pietas'' toward one's parents") was one of the most important aspects of demonstrating virtue. ''Pius'' as a ''[[cognomen]]'' originated as way to mark a person as especially "pious" in this sense: announcing one's personal ''pietas'' through official nomenclature seems to have been an innovation of the [[Roman Republic|late Republic]], when [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius]] claimed it for his efforts to have his father, [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Numidicus|Numidicus]], recalled from exile.&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pietas'' extended also toward "parents" in the sense of "ancestors," and was one of the basic principles of [[mos maiorum|Roman tradition]], as expressed by the care of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Heid, "The Romanness of Roman Christianity," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 408.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pietas'' as a virtue resided within a person, in contrast to a virtue or gift such as ''[[Victoria (mythology)|Victoria]],'' which was given by the gods. ''Pietas,'' however, allowed a person to recognize the divine source of benefits conferred.&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," p. 878.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded use of ''pietas'' in English occurs in Anselm Bayly’s ''The Alliance of Music, Poetry, and Oratory'', published in 1789.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary. Oxford English Dictionary Online. Web. 28 Jan. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iconography==
[[File:Herennia1.1.jpg|thumb|250px|Denarius of Herennius, depicting Pietas and an act of ''pietas''.]]
Pietas was represented on coin by cult objects, but also as a woman conducting a sacrifice by means of fire at an altar.&lt;ref&gt;Belayche, "Religious Actors in Daily Life," p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; In the imagery of sacrifice, [[libation]] was the fundamental act that came to symbolize ''pietas''.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Scheid]], "Sacrifices for Gods and Ancestors," in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pietas'' is first represented on Roman coins on ''[[denarius|denarii]]'' issued by [[Marcus Herennius]] in 108 or 107 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt; Pietas appears on the obverse as a divine [[personification]], in [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] form; the quality of ''pietas'' is represented by a son carrying his father on his back; the symbolism of which would be echoed in [[Virgil]]'s [[Aeneid]], with [[Aeneas]] carrying his father [[Anchises]] out of the burning [[Troy]].&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt; Pietas is among the virtues that appear frequently on Imperial coins, including those issued under [[Hadrian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Rufus Fears]], "The Theology of Victory at Rome: Approaches and Problem," ''Aufstieg und Niedergang der römischen Welt'' II.17.2 (1981), p. 813.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the symbols of ''pietas'' was the stork, described by [[Petronius]] as ''pietaticultrix'', "cultivator of ''pietas''." The stork represented filial piety in particular, as the Romans believed that it demonstrated family loyalty by returning to the same nest every year, and that it took care of its parents in old age. As such, a stork appears next to Pietas on  [[:File:Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius.jpg|a coin issued by Metellus Pius]] (on whose ''cognomen'' see [[#As virtue|above]]).&lt;ref&gt;Pliny, ''Natural History'' 10.63; Anna Clark, ''Divine Qualities: Cult and Community in Republican Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 2007), pp. 154–155; Catherine Connors, ''Petronius the Poet'' (Cambridge University Press, 1998), p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As goddess==
[[Image:Bronze-Flavia Maximiana Theodora-trier RIC 65.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Flavia Maximiana Theodora]] on the obverse, on the reverse Pietas holding infant to her breast.]]
Pietas was the divine presence in everyday life that cautioned humans not to intrude on the realm of the gods.&lt;ref&gt;As expressed by Cicero, ''[[De Legibus]]'' 2.22; Belayche, "Religious Actors in Daily Life," p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt; Violations of ''pietas'' required a ''[[piaculum]]'', expiatory rites.&lt;ref&gt;Belayche, "Religious Actors in Daily Life," p. 286.&lt;/ref&gt;

A temple to Pietas was vowed ''([[votum]])'' by [[Manius Acilius Glabrio (consul 191 BC)|Manius Acilius Glabrio]] at the [[Battle of Thermopylae (191 BC)|Battle of Thermopylae in 191 BC]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 40.34.4; Fears, "The Theology of Victory at Rome," pp. 741–742, and "The Cult of Virtues," p. 835.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a miraculous legend ''([[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#miraculum|miraculum]]),''&lt;ref&gt;[[Pliny the Elder]], ''Natural History'' 7.121; [[Valerius Maximus]] 5.4.7, as cited by Fears, "The Theology of Victory," p. 742, note 10.&lt;/ref&gt; a poor woman who was starving in prison was saved when her daughter gave her breast milk (compare [[Roman Charity]]). Caught in the act, the daughter was not punished, but recognized for her ''pietas''. Mother and daughter were set free, and given public support for the rest of their lives. The site was regarded as sacred to the goddess Pietas ''(consecratus deae)'' because she had chosen to manifest her presence there.&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Theology of Victory," p. 742; "The Cult of Virtues," p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt; The story exemplified ''pietas erga parentes'', the proper devotion one ought to show to one's parents.&lt;ref&gt;Fears, "The Cult of Virtues," p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imperial women portrayed as Pietas===
Pietas was often depicted as goddess on the reverse of Roman Imperial coins, with women of the imperial family on the obverse,&lt;ref&gt;Roman Coins Issued During the Reign of Emperor Hadrian, [http://www.dig4coins.com/articles/ancient-coins/roman-coins-issued-during-the-reign-of-emperor-hadrian-ad-117-to-138 Dig4Coins.com].&lt;/ref&gt; as an appropriate virtue to be attributed to them. Women of the Imperial family might be portrayed in art in the goddess's guise.

[[File:Nanjing - Chaotian Palace - Bixie.jpg|right|thumb|260x260px|A Chinese '''''Pixiu''''', part [[Chinese dragon]], part [[lion]] and with feathered [[wing]]s, [[Chaotian Palace]], [[Nanjing]].]]

'''Pixiu''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:貔貅|貔貅]]|p=píxiū|w='''P'i-hsiu'''}}), is a [[Chinese myth]]ical [[Hybrid (mythology)|hybrid]] creature, commonly, but incorrectly referred to in the West by the Greek word "chimera", and considered a powerful protector of practitioners of [[Feng Shui]]. It resembles a strong, winged [[lion]]. '''''Pixiu''''' is an earth and sea variation, particularly an influential and auspicious creature for wealth. It is said to have a voracious appetite towards only gold, silver and jewels. Therefore, traditionally to the Chinese, '''''Pixiu''''' has always been regarded as an auspicious creature that possessed mystical powers capable of drawing ''Cai Qi'' (財氣 wealth) from all directions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tianlu.sg/yutianlu_eng.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/13Traditions2337.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, according to [[Chinese zodiac]], it is especially helpful for those who are going through a bad year.

There are two different types of '''''Pixiu''''', a male and a female. The physical difference is seen by their [[antler]]s. The one with two antlers is the female of the species and is called a ''"'''Bìxié'''"''  and the one with one antler is the male of the species and is called a "'''''Tiān lù'''''".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

*'''''Bìxié''''' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:辟邪|辟邪]]|p=bìxié|w=pi-hsieh}}; lit. "to ward off evil spirits") - The female of the species; wards off evil. It is also believed that '''''Bìxié''''' has the ability of assisting anyone who is [[suffering]] from bad Feng Shui that is due to having offended the [[Tai Sui|Grand Duke Jupiter]] (also called as [[Tai sui|''Tai Sui'']] (太岁)).
*'''''Tiān lù''''' ({{zh|t=天祿|p=tiānlù|w=t'ien-lu}}) - The male of the species; in charge of wealth. '''''Tiān lù''''' is said to go out into the world in search of gold and other forms of wealth and, bringing it home to its Master, the '''''Bìxié''''' is then said to hold onto it, guarding it within the home of the Master. Displaying '''''Tiān lù''''' at home or in the office is said to prevent wealth from flowing away. 

'''''Pixiu''''' craves the smell of gold and silver and it likes to bring his master [[money]] in his mouth. [[Statue]]s of this creature are often used to attract [[wealth]] in [[feng shui]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=29 Chinese Mysteries|last=Bates|first=Roy|publisher=TuDragon Books Ltd|year=2008|isbn=|location=Beijing, China|pages=48, 49|chapter=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, '''''Pixiu''''' are also a popular design on [[jade]] [[pendant]]s. It was also featured as a design on the sword of Fa Mulan's character in the 1998 Disney animated feature ''Mulan''.

==Characteristics==
[[Image:Pixiu3.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Pixiu&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Funerary Sculpture of a Chimera (Bixie) LACMA AC1997.1.1.jpg|thumb|A sculpture of a Chinese '''''Pixiu''''' '''''''“'''Bìxié"'''''''''' − a female Pixiu with two antlers. [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] (LACMA)]]
Fierce looking and covered with whitish-grey [[fur]], '''''Pixiu'',''' are a type of auspicious, winged animal, written about in ancient Chinese history and heralded through the millennia by fantastic stories of powerful and grandiose feats of victory in battle.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Their fantastic legend has been passed down through two-thousand years of Chinese lore. They have the powerful head of a [[Chinese dragon]], the bold body of a [[lion]] and, historically, depending on whether it is a male or female, sports on its head either one antler (male) or two antlers (female). In modern times, the historical physical appearance of this legendary creature has been somewhat lost and, as time has passed, it is now more commonly depicted with only one antler, which would be a male according to the ancient descriptions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Ancient Chinese descriptions, depictions and stone carvings of '''''Pixiu''''' from the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD) show the male with a single [[antler]] and the female with two. As with the [[Fenghuang|Chinese Phoenix]], the common image today is a representation of a single sex with one antler (male). '''''Pixiu''''' have protruding eyes and sharp teeth. Its strong body resembles a [[Chinese lion]] and its feet have [[paw]]s and [[claw]]s. There is one ancient, stone sculpture variation found with hooves, but all '''''Pixiu''''' always have wings. Many have a bifurcated (split) tail that hangs low and downward, covering their buttocks and rectums, a representative metaphor that they hold gold inside their stomachs but will not let it out.

Looking at the posture of '''''Pixiu''''', the creature seems to project a sense of strength, elegance and mobility. Likewise it has a big, opened mouth ready to gobble up gold and fortunes for its master. Because of this, a '''''Pixiu''''' statue is often employed in the home as a way of receiving and keeping fortunes and wealth.

Imperial '''''Pixiu''''' used during the Qing dynasty developed the physical characteristic of a fatter, more rotund body, indicating a stomach that could be loaded with unlimited amounts of gold and all forms of wealth and good fortune.

Due to their similar appearances, the '''''Pixiu''''' is often confused with [[Imperial guardian lions|fu dog]]s or ''"Qilin"'', but '''''Pixiu''''' can easily be distinguished apart from those two animals by its pair of feathered wings with which it can fly between Heaven and Earth.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[File:Tomb Yongning of the Ts'en Dynasty.JPG|thumb|Pixiu are a type of ancient mythological, guardian animal species that have '''feathered wings''', a head like a dragon and a body like a lion (sometimes described as a body like a horse). The male Pixiu of this winged, mythological animal species is called a ''“Tiān lù"''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=29 Chinese Mysteries|last=Bates|first=Roy|publisher=TuDragon Books Ltd|year=2008|isbn=|location=Beijing, China|pages=49|chapter=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he bears a single antler on his head; ''Pixiu'' females, also with wings, are called ''“Bìxié”''.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; They look exactly like their winged male counterparts, except they grow '''two'''&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; antlers on their heads rather than one.

One story of the '''''Pixiu''''' tells that it violated a law of [[Heaven]] by defecating on the floor of Heaven. When it was found out, it was punished by a spanking executed by the [[Jade Emperor]]. The spanking was hard enough to cause its rectum to be permanently sealed. The [[Jade Emperor]] further declared that the diet of the '''''Pixiu''''' would be restricted to gold, silver and jewels. This is why '''''Pixiu''''' can eat [[gold]], silver and jewels but cannot expel it. This is one of the origins of the status of '''''Pixiu''''' statues as a symbol of the acquisition and preservation of wealth.

Another story says that '''''Pixiu''''', was the well-behaved, youngest son of the Dragon King and was spoiled by its parents. One day '''''Pixiu''''' was playing on the Dragon King's desk and accidentally broke a very important seal that represented the power of the Dragon King. The Dragon King became very angry and used magic to turn '''''Pixiu''''' into an animal. He then sealed his rectum and declared that from then on, '''''Pixiu''''' could only eat things that represented wealth, such as gold, silver and jewels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=29 Chinese Mysteries|last=Bates|first=Roy|publisher=TuDragon Books Ltd|year=2008|isbn=|location=Beijing, China|pages=51|chapter=Chapter 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''''Pixiu''''''' was reputed as a very fierce creature. The large [[canine tooth|fang]]s, visible in the creatures' snarling mouths, are used to attack demons and evil spirits, draining their essence and converting it to wealth. '''''Pixiu''''' also guard against disease caused by these same evil spirits. It is written that '''''Pixiu''''' patrols the Heavens to keep demons at bay and to protect their owners from all harm.&lt;ref name="Bates 2008 49"/&gt;

It was believed that the ferociously devoted Pixiu would always and constantly guard its Master, even after he passed from this life into the next world. It was also believed that Pixiu would help their Masters ascend to heaven by flying them up to Heaven while they rode on their strong backs.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== History ==
'''''"Pixiu"''''' appear to have their origin in the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD) where they are found mentioned and were originally called '''''"táo bá"''''' in the [[Book of Han]], an ancient written account of the history of China. 
[[File:Ming Dynasty wood carving books in Tian Yi Chamber colllection.JPG|left|thumb|350x350px|Book of Han, Tian Yi Chamber Library Collection. The [[Tian Yi Ge]], [[Ningbo]], [[Zhejiang]] Province, [[China]] is the oldest library in China; Photo supplied by Wikipedia User:Gisling]]
The Book of Han was completed in the year 111 A.D. In Chapter 96, it is written, &lt;blockquote&gt;''"In the country of Wū Gē Shān Lí there exist creatures called "táo bá" (meaning "selected peach"), lions and rhinoceros."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Han |title=Book of Han |volume= Volume 96}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}} -from the section entitled Accounts of the Western Regions.'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;An annotation is also found therein where the female and male '''''"táo bá"''''' are further described as having '''antlers like a deer''', but the male, which was referred to as '''''“Tiān lù"''''', has only '''one antler''' and the female, referred to as ''“'''Bìxié"''''', has '''two antlers'''.

In tribute to the legend of the ferocity and prowess of the '''''Pixiu''''' in [[battle]], the '''''Pixiu''''' became synonymous with the [[army]] in ancient [[China]]. In fact, the word ''"pixiu"'', interpreted as meaning "fierce beast" and also "brave warrior", was used as a symbol on battle flags and banners.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/13Traditions1548.html|title=Tianlu and Bixie|last=|first=|date=|website=http://www.cultural-china.com/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170412192128/http://traditions.cultural-china.com/en/13Traditions1548.html|archive-date=2017-04-12|dead-url=yes|access-date=March 18, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] of the Han dynasty, in ancient China, declared that the wonderful, magnificent and devoted Pixiu, who obtained and guarded the Master's gold, would be forever known as the "Treasure of the Emperor".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pi Xiu Celestial Coming with Fortune|last=Li|first=Jinn|publisher=Estalontech (PublishDrive)|year=2015|isbn=9789634280958|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that the Emperor declared that only Royal persons could possess a Pixiu and it was strictly forbidden for all others to own one, including officials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This law was kept through to the end of the Qing dynasty.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Chinese Architecture ==

During China's history, '''''Pixiu''''' were commonly displayed in ancient architecture to ward off ''Yin Qi'' (陰氣) and to harness auspicious ''[[Qi]]''.
The statues of a '''''Pixiu''''' are commonly found on the four corners of the roofs of houses, palaces and halls of the most important people such as the [[Emperor of China|Chinese Emperor]]. The '''''Pixiu''''' sits behind the dragon, the phoenix, the winged horse, the sea horse, etc., in a guarding manner. 
[[File:Tomb of Xiao Rong - P1200114.JPG|thumb|330x330px|A very large pair of winged, stone Pixiu guarding a tomb in China.]]

In ancient China, stone statues of '''''Pixiu (Bixie)''''' were also used as tomb guardians of Han dynasty emperors and other royal persons.

==Feng Shui==
'''''Pixiu''''' (aka ''"Pi Yao"'' in some modern cultural translations) is the heavenly variation of a particularly powerful and auspicious creature of good fortune. They are said to have the power to assist anyone suffering from bad [[Feng shui|''Feng Shui'']] due to having offended the [[Grand Duke Jupiter]] ([[Tai Sui]]). In 2005, the Grand Duke resided in the West, so those born in the [[Rabbit (zodiac)|year of the Rabbit]] will have been in conflict with him. Practitioners of Feng Shui should ensure that they display the '''''Pixiu''''' (Pi Yao) in the West to appease Tai Sui. The '''''Pixiu''''' (Pi Yao) should also be displayed in homes for those enduring a period of bad luck soon after moving into a new home or soon after undertaking renovations. In 2006, ''[[Tai Sui]]'' moved to the Northwest. His exact position in 2006 is West-Northwest.

*'''''Pixiu''' (aka "Pi Yao''" in some modern cultural translations) - must be placed facing out of the house. 
*Displaying '''''Pixiu''' (Pi Yao)'' at the affected area of the house or office can avoid misfortune and disasters. 
*For displaying towards openings or entrance, a pair of '''''Pixiu''' (Pi Yao)'' is needed.
*'''''Tiān lù''''' (male ''Pixiu'' with one antler) and '''''Bìxié''''' (female ''Pixiu'' with two antlers) - are utilized for attracting and keeping wealth; you may place them in the desired wealth area, such as an attractive wealth area or an accumulative wealth area. 
*Do not place '''''Pixiu''''' facing directly on any person like a confronting position. 
*Ideally, '''''Pixiu''''' should not be place on the floor and they should never be placed above eye level.
*One cannot touch the mouth of '''''Pixiu''''' because the touching of their mouths would ruin the wealth.

'''Prison violence''' is a daily occurrence due to the diverse inmates with varied [[criminal]] backgrounds in [[Penitentiary|penitentiaries]]. The three different types of attacks are [[inmate]] on inmate, inmate on guard, and self-inflicted. These attacks can either be impulsive and spontaneous or well-planned out and premeditated.&lt;ref name=Morgan&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morgan Jr.|first1=William J.|title=The Major Causes of Institutional Violence|journal=American Jails|date=December 2009|volume=23|issue=5|pages=63, 65–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Factors such as [[Gangs|gang]] rivalries, [[Prison overcrowding|overcrowding]], minor disputes, and [[prison design]] contribute to the violent attacks that transpire.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  Prisons are trying to avoid, or at least better deal with these situations by being proactive. They are taking steps like placing violent convicts and gang leaders into [[solitary confinement]], balancing the cells by critically examining each inmate to see where they are likely to reside peacefully, reducing blind spots, and training as well as educating the officers.&lt;ref name="La Vigne"&gt;{{cite web|last1=La Vigne|first1=Nancy G.|last2=Debus-Sherrill|first2=Sara|last3=Brazzell|first3=Diana|last4=Downey|first4=P. Mitchell|title=Preventing Violence and sexual Assault in Jail: A situational Crime Prevention Approach|publisher=Urban Institute|accessdate=1 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acts of violence ==
Prison [[violence]] is inflicted onto either another [[Prisoner|inmate]], a [[prison guard]], or themselves. In 1999, it was reported that one in five inmates, or twenty percent of inmates, at fourteen [[state prisons]] had been physically assaulted by another inmate.&lt;ref name="La Vigne" /&gt;  Prison violence can consist of inmates fighting with their fists, homemade [[Weapon|weapons]], or being [[rape]]d.  The attacks that are implemented onto anyone but the self are either instrumental or expressive.

* '''Instrumental violence''' is premeditated; it is planned out, calculated, and then implemented. More commonly executed by males,&lt;ref name=Morgan/&gt; this act typically establishes power and is, “…justified and rationalized by the inmate population by creating peer admiration, fear, protection…”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  Typically, surviving in prison involves establishing strength and power, which is why instrumental violence is so commonly used.

* '''Expressive violence''' is a spontaneous attack typically carried out by women.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  In this tactic, the attacker lashes out suddenly due to intense feelings of danger, fear, anger or resentment, resulting in the sudden jump into action.  It can be concluded that expressive violence is a more responsive attack that occurs when the perpetrator feels provoked or threatened, whereas instrumental violence is carefully planned out and driven by vengeance.

* '''[[Self-harm]]''' is a purely [[psychological]] act.  Many people that get sentenced to prison often suffer from or develop [[mental disorders]] such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[anxiety]], and need psychiatric attention.&lt;ref name="La Vigne"/&gt;  Due to influences such as their surroundings, the harsh treatment they receive from officers and inmates, and their sentencing time, self-harm and [[suicide]] rates are believed to be higher in prison populations than any non-incarcerated population.&lt;ref name="La Vigne"/&gt;

== Where violence occurs ==
Prison violence is capable of occurring anywhere throughout a prison. Any inmate is capable of acting rash and snapping at any given moment, that an outbreak can occur anywhere and at any time.  Oftentimes, an inmate will look for a place that offers a sufficient amount of time to commit their act proficiently.  If they are outside of their cell, they have the chance to smuggle out a homemade weapon by placing it up their [[rectum]].&lt;ref name=Wood&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wood|first1=Graeme|title=How Gangs Took Over Prisons|journal=Atlantic Media Company|date=October 2014|volume=314|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these acts can occur anywhere, a very common place inmates search for is a blind spot.

=== Blind spots ===
Prisons are covered with guards standing watch, [[CCTV]], or a combination of the two.  Neither of these can possibly cover every inch of a prison’s ground, which is why “…blind spots…allow inmates to conceal illicit activity from security staff”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  Therefore, inmates purposefully look for these blind spots to commit violent acts undetected by prison guards.  The inmate’s goal is to know that they are going to be able to complete the act of violence to the degree that they desire without guards noticing and intervening.  Inmates look for places that give them more time to complete their attacks.

== Causes of violence ==
The perpetrators of violent attacks are convicted criminals, some of whom in prison for committing crimes that left multiple people brutally beaten and left for dead, so violence is in many of these individual’s nature.  These people, “…settle disputes and seek power in the way they are accustomed- through violence”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  This natural fire in their bellies is undoubtedly a huge factor that goes into why prison violence occurs, but the physical design of the prison can serve as another factor. A prison can either have indirect or direct supervision.  Both types of supervision have their strengths, but also detrimental weaknesses.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;

=== Indirect supervision ===
Indirect supervision is when a correctional officer is placed in an enclosed booth and must constantly watch over the inmates through a [[bird’s eye view]].  The physical interactions that officers have with the inmates is minimal, for most of the communication comes through an [[intercom]] system.  Inmates are placed in their own cells and officers have physical barriers to ensure their own safety.  When havoc is wreaked, a call for a response team is placed over the intercom.  This type of supervision is strong, but has some drawbacks, such as the creation of blind spots.  These are created through indirect supervision because the guards standing watch can have objects blocking tiny spots or they may just not be looking in the right direction at the right time.  Indirect supervision is an impersonal and more distant form of supervision that helps with officer safety, but leaves blind spots for “…inmates to conceal illicit activity from security staff”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;

=== Direct supervision ===
Direct supervision is a more personal type of design because officers are assigned a cell block to patrol. Through this layout, the guards actually speak to cellmates one-on-one.  The minor altercations that take place throughout the day is directly handled by the patrol officer, but this single officer cannot prevent a violent attack from happening. As soon as their back is turned or their attention is focused on someone else, the perpetrator can still commit their violence.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  In this form of supervision officers are left more vulnerable, but it also leads to, “…decreased tension and stress of staff and inmates…”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  Direct supervision is more of a hands-on form of management, where “…major incidents are not as numerous and minor incidents result in higher numbers…”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;

=== Overcrowding ===
[[prison overcrowding|Overcrowding]] is a huge problem many prisons face &lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt; because handling so many short-fused inmates at once can lead to many altercations.  The combination of “…overcrowding, inadequate supervision, and inmate access to weapons- can create opportunities for…offenses”.&lt;ref name="La Vigne" /&gt;  Trying to assert authority and strict rules on these violent offenders is extremely difficult due to the fact that these people do not respond well to restrictions and being told what to do.  Having to focus on so many dangerous people at once is just not possible because there will always be someone not being watched over at any given moment; this is most likely when inmates choose to strike.  Overcrowding is a very common issue in American prisons that leads to prison violence because the prisons will be understaffed.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;

=== Staffing levels ===
Prison violence and [[prison suicide]] in [[England]] and [[Wales]] have been increasing year on year while staffing levels have been falling.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-37702964 Are prisons becoming more dangerous places?] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Reduction in the number of staff is blamed for this and the [[Ministry of Justice]] has admitted that staff cuts are a factor.&lt;ref name="Guardian27/10/2016"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2016/oct/27/prison-violence-staff-cuts-moj-deaths-assaults Prison violence epidemic partly due to staff cuts, MoJ admits] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  It was felt urgent action was needed.  The government has provided money for increased staff but staffing levels are set to remain below 2010 levels.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37789042 Prison violence in England and Wales up yet again] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37842500 Truss to hold talks with prison officers over violence] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilserviceworld.com/articles/news/ministry-justice-urged-get-grip-prison-staffing-amid-rising-violence Ministry of Justice urged to "get a grip" on prison staffing amid rising violence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/nov/02/prisons-in-england-and-wales-given-boost-of-2500-new-staff-to-tackle-violence Prisons in England and Wales to get 2,500 extra staff to tackle violence] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Day, of the [[Prison Reform Trust]] spoke of a “hidden emergency unfolding in our prison system” and said increasing prison violence should not become the new normal the lives of people living and working in prisons depended on that.  [[Frances Crook]], of the [[Howard League for Penal Reform]], said: 
{{quote|Cutting staff and prison budgets while allowing the number of people behind bars to grow unchecked has created a toxic mix of violence, death and human misery … Today’s figures show that we cannot wait for legislation – bold and radical action is needed now to stop the death toll rising further.&lt;ref name="Guardian27/10/2016"/&gt;}}

== Weapons used ==
Most inmates look to get into an altercation armed with some sort of homemade weapon.  The weapons they use to attack their victims are made to be very destructive and can easily be both hidden and accessed.  They use objects such as shanks, [[Club (weapon)|clubs]], [[dagger]]s, [[razors]], and saps to serve as weapons.&lt;ref name=Lincoln&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lincoln|first1=J.M.|last2=Chen|first2=L-H|last3=Mair|first3=J.S.|last4=Biermann|first4=P.J.|last5=Baker|first5=S.P.|title=Inmate-made weapons in prison facilities: assessing the injury risk|journal=Brief Report|date=29 March 2006|pages=196–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A shank is a homemade knife,&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt; and is used to stab the person they are planning on fighting with, typically created by sharpening a common object.  Clubs are considered “…objects such as pitchers, hot pots, and broom handles…”.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;  They are put into use by throwing or hitting their target with these objects.  A sap is typically a [[padlock]] enclosed in a sock,&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt; but really any hard object can be placed inside.  Their prey is hit, typically over the head, with this weapon.  [[Razor blades]] are very commonly used to commit prison violence.  When an inmate knows there is a possibly of facing an attack, they will often place razors inside their mouths (in their cheeks) so that they can spit the razor out of their mouth and slash up the other person’s face.  Since this tactic has been caught onto, many times a person will first punch whomever they are fighting in the face so that if a razor is in there, their whole mouth will get cut up.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt;  An inmate can choose the shank, club, dagger, razor, or sap as their weapon of choice to either do harm or protect themselves.   When it comes to creating these weapons, prisoners really do serve as craftsmen and make weapon-making into an art of the sort.

== Weapon creation ==
The prison store, supplies provided by prisons, and objects visitors bring&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt; are typically where the weapon creation process begins.  They get a hold of items, “…such as disposable razors and [[toothbrushes]]”.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;  Then, these materials get manipulated and transformed into a weapon of destruction. They may sharpen it or harden it using other items.  In other instances, “Items that appear innocuous have been converted into weapons”.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.correctionsone.com/officer-safety/articles/8691247-What-are-the-most-dangerous-makeshift-prison-weapons/|title=What are the most dangerous makeshift prison weapons?|newspaper=CorrectionsOne|access-date=2017-02-14|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inmates also use everyday items in their natural form in dangerous ways that is clearly not used as they were originally intended.  Often, when an inmate uses this form to create their weapons, it is used on officers because the items do not look questionable so it is easy to catch the corrections officer off guard.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;  Some will, “…fashion the metal post of a bunk bed or the edge of a cell door into a spear…that could be flung from inside a cell and penetrate a man’s neck or liver”,&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; which is called the bone crusher.  Some inmates will go to great lengths to create weapons and many different ways to create these weapons has been discovered.

== Security threat groups ==
Officers call prison gangs STGs, or [[Prison gang|security threat groups]].  These groups are highly dangerous and take part in a huge majority of attacks that occur in prisons.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  Originally, “The early formation of STGs was based on racial/ethnic ideologies and protection from other groups.  Later they developed the intent to commit acts of violence and form crime syndicates”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  These gangs’ sole purpose is to have control and dominance, which is gained through violent attacks.  Often, these attacks are committed onto rivals and people issued in the Bad News List.  The Bad News List can be presumed as a factor for prison violence.   This list is circulated among a gang and once a name is found on this list, it is inevitable that they will be attacked.  A person is typically place on the Bad News List if they, “…stole from an affiliate on the outside, or because you failed to repay a drug debt, or because you’re suspected of ratting someone out”.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt;  The people on the list will be attacked on sight, but once their debts are paid, they are immediately removed from the Bad News List.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt;  Most, if not all, gang prison violence is instrumental and is very intricately planned out.  Gang members will often send out or receive encoded, in depth letters on violent attacks that are ordered to take place, other times, “…gang members used the drainage pipes of their in-cell toilets to communicate clandestinely across cellblocks…”.&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt;  It has become clear that, “Extensive communication systems coordinated between inmates, criminal activity, and street gangs are common”,&lt;ref name=Wood /&gt; and a vast majority of the prison violence that occurs begins with these communication systems.  Security threat groups are at the heart of many of the altercations that take place within prison walls and they remorselessly commit these vicious acts simply because they are ordered to do so.

== Violence against prison guards ==
Inmates often feel animosity and a sense of hatred towards prison guards due to the treatment they receive and the power the guards have over them.  In 1999, more than 2,400 correctional officers required medical attention after being assaulted by an inmate, and according to a 2002-2003 study, most guards were assaulted through the use of clubs.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;  Along with these clubs, inmates tend to use weapons of opportunity when attacking an officer.  A weapon of opportunity is any typical, everyday object that is not considered a weapon until used in a destructive way.&lt;ref name=Lincoln /&gt;  The reason for this hostility, and ultimately inmate attacks on guards can be placed onto the way the incarcerated are treated.

Inmates are often humiliated and have extreme force placed upon them.   There are no excuses that can be made in an officer’s offense to defend these actions, unless their life was put into jeopardy.  Implementing these uncalled for actions reasonably cause animosity between the inmates and guards.  There are cases where if an inmate disobeys an order, “…groups of officers…approach his cell, dressed in protective gear and armed with shield, [[Taser]]s, and other weapons.  If the inmate refuses to comply, the officers will flood his cell with chemical agents…they have reportedly thrown stinger grenades, which spray rubber pellets into a concentrated area…and violently subdue him”.&lt;ref name=Jeffreys&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Derek S.|title=Cruel but Not Unusual|journal=Commonweal|date=13 June 2014|volume=141|issue=11|pages=20–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Correctional and Detention personnel use force as a last resort, in the above scenario; entry into an inmate's cell would need to be necessary before force could be justified. For example, if an inmate has a court hearing and has barricaded himself in his cell, refusing to come out or comply with the officials orders force might be used. Another instance would be if the inmate needed to be transferred to another facility and refuses to comply with the directives to move.

== Violence prevention measures ==
Preventing all prison violence is an impossible task because it is impossible to be prepared for any and every situation.  Nevertheless, prisons are taking measures to avoid, or at least limit, this violence.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  They are doing things such as balancing the cells, reducing blind spots, and training officers.  When prisons receive new inmates, they search the background of the individual; they look into things like any possible gang affiliation and any history of [[racism]] or anger issues.  After piecing this information together, the officers will place them in a cell block that they feel is most appropriate and that will cause the least arousal between the new inmate and the ones already housed there.  Reducing the blind spots is a difficult task to complete because it is impossible to watch every inch of the prison at once, but by watching over as much as possible at a time does reduce the chances of violence occurring.  Training officers is the third measure being taken.  If officers treat the inmates properly and not be rash and assert violence on them so quickly, the inmates may feel more respected and not look to retaliate.  Also with the training, officers are learning how to deal with minor altercations more effectively, as in without force and violence unless necessary.  Also, the correction officers are learning about the psychology of the inmates.  These officers are becoming aware of the psychological differences and hardships the incarcerated tend to face and how to properly deal with them.&lt;ref name="La Vigne" /&gt;  If all of these precautionary measures are taken, then prison violence rates can definitely lower, although completely vanishing is something not likely.

=== Supermax facilities ===
A [[Supermax prison|supermax]] is a separate facility within a prison where inmates are placed, “…for violent/predatory behavior within other institutions.  They may be identified as gang leaders, or considered high risk for escape. Inmates incarcerated in the supermax facility do not have the freedoms allowed inmates in general population because of their security status/institutional disciplinary record”.&lt;ref name=Morgan /&gt;  These inmates are placed in a cell for twenty three hours a day and have limitation than the typical convict possess.  This prevention measure works because it takes the biggest threats and influences, such as gang members, out of the picture.  An issue that arises with this is that, “…some prisoners subjected to isolation become so damaged that they pose a renewed threat to staff and inmates when they return to the general prison population”.&lt;ref name="Jeffreys"/&gt;  This means that the already dangerous and threatening inmates can return to the regular prison population with a new, stronger desire to retaliate and cause prison violence.&lt;ref name="Jeffreys"/&gt; The supermax facility serves as a good method to eradicate the influence of the most dangerous of inmates, but risks the return of a vengeful inmate.

There are a number of '''Spanish units of measurement''' of [[length]] or [[area]] that are now virtually obsolete (due to [[metrication]]).  They include the '''vara''', the '''cordel''', the '''league''' and the '''labor'''. The units of area used to express the area of land are still encountered in some transactions in land today. For example, the 'vara' is still used in Costa Rica when ordering lumber.

==Vara (unit of length)==
[[File:50 Vara Plot in San Francisco CA.jpg|thumb|This street block is made up of six (2 X 3) 50 vara plots.  The California vara is 33 inches, so 50 vara results in 137.6 foot plots. Subplots are within the original boundary lines.  San Francisco business district was originally called 50 Vara District.  This example is bounded by Union, Kearny, Filbert and Montgomery streets.]]
A '''vara''' (meaning "rod" or "pole", abbreviation: '''var''') is an old [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[length]].  Varas are a [[surveying]] unit that appear in many deeds in the southern [[United States]], and varas were also used in many parts of [[Latin America]].  It varied in size at various times and places; the Spanish unit was set at about {{convert|835.905|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} in 1801. In Argentina, the vara measured about {{convert|866|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}, and typical urban lots are {{convert|8.66|m|ft|2|abbr=on}} wide (10 Argentine varas). At some time a value of {{convert|33|in|mm|1}} was adopted in California.
[[File:Thomas Bros. logo on San Francisco map.jpg|thumb|]]
In [[Texas]], a vara was defined as {{convert|33+1/3|in|mm|2}}, or 1 yard&amp;nbsp;= 1.08 vara.  The vara and the corresponding unit of [[area]], the square vara, were introduced in the 19th century to measure Spanish land grants. In [[Texas]], [[Stephen F. Austin]]'s early surveying contracts required that he use the vara as a standard unit. The vara can be seen in many deeds as late as the mid to late 1900s. {{convert|1|acre|ha|3|lk=on}} is equivalent to 5,645.376 Texan square varas.  A league is equivalent to 5,000 varas squared or {{convert|4428.4|acre|ha|2}}.

To convert varas to feet, take the varas and divide by 0.36.

Standardization of measurement in [[Texas]] came with the introduction of varas, cordels, and leagues.

A measure of 100 varas by 100 varas (Spanish) is almost 7000 square meters, and is known traditionally throughout Latin America as a ''manzana'' (''i.e.'', a "city block"). As well, lumber is still measured in Costa Rica using a system based on 4 vara, or 11 feet, for both round and square wood. With square wood, using inches, the width is multiplied by the depth to get a measurement which they call ''pulgadas'', or inches. The lumber is charged 'per inch', which is a measurement 11/12 of a [[board foot]].

==Labor (unit of area)==
A '''labor''' ({{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|b|ɔr}} in West [[Texas]]) is a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[area]], used to express the area of land, that is equal to 1 million square varas.  A labor is equivalent to about {{convert|177.1|acre|ha|2|lk=on}}. It was used in the archaic system of old Spanish land grants affecting Texas and parts of adjoining states.  The labor is often used as an approximate equivalent to a ''quarter-section'' (that is, one quarter of a [[square mile]] of land). It is still encountered in modern real estate transactions.

==League (unit of area)==
A '''[[League (unit)#Spain|league]]''' can also be a [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[area]], used to express the area of land, that is equal to 25 million square varas. A (square) league is equivalent to about {{convert|4428.4|acre|ha|2|lk=on}}. It was used in the archaic system of old Spanish land grants affecting [[Texas]] and parts of adjoining states and this use of league is used throughout the [[Texas Constitution]].

A common Texas land grant size, discussed in [[James A. Michener]]'s ''[[Texas (novel)|Texas]]'', was a "labor and a league:" a labor of good [[riparian]] land and a (square) league of land away from the river.

The (square) league is still encountered in modern real estate transactions.

==Palmo and coto (unit of length)==
The ''palmo'' ("palm") measured the distance between the tip of the thumb and the tip of the pinky finger with all fingers splayed. Its standardized value is {{convert|20.873|cm|in|4|abbr=on|lk=on}} (9 ''pulgadas''). Half of a palmo in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] was called the ''coto'', described as six fingers and defined as {{convert|10.4365|cm|in|5|abbr=on}}. The [[Roman foot|ancient Romans]] had a similar, smaller unit called the ''palmus'', which was {{convert|7.3925|cm|in|5|abbr=on}}.

== Local units ==
Although some standardisation was achieved with the law of 1801, particularly in defining the league as 6666⅔ ''varas'' long, varying measures continued to be used in various cities and regions.&lt;ref&gt;Detailed tables in: Instituto Geográfico y Estadístico; [http://www.saber.es/web/biblioteca/libros/pesas-medidas-legales-sistema-metrico-decimal/pesas-medidas-legales-sistema-metrico-decimal.pdf ''Equivalencias entre las pesas y medidas usadas antiguamente en las diversas provincias de España y las legales del Sistema Métrico Decimal'']; Madrid; 1886.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5856">'''The D-Word''' is a worldwide [[online community]] for professionals in the [[documentary film]] industry. Discussions include creative, business, technical, and social topics related to documentary filmmaking.

The name "D-Word" is defined as "industry euphemism for documentary", as in: "We love your film but we don't know how to sell it. It's a d-word."&lt;ref name="dword"&gt;[http://www.d-word.com The D-Word] official website&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The D-Word is the longest-running online platform in the documentary industry. It was established in 1999 in [[New York City]] by filmmaker [[Doug Block]] and writer and [[online community]] builder Dan Richards&lt;ref&gt;DO YOU KNOW THE D-WORD? [http://www.filmthreat.com/news/550/]&lt;/ref&gt; as a result of Block's feature documentary, ''[[Home Page (documentary)|Home Page]]'', and encouraged by protagonists of this film, [[Justin Hall]] and [[Howard Rheingold]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | author = Hudson, David
  | title = A Search for Ourselves and the Future
  | publisher = Spiegel Online 32/1998
  | url = http://www.spiegel.de/international
  | date = 1998-08-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Block continues to be a co-host of The D-Word, together with documentary makers Ben Kempas (between 2001-2014);  [[John Burgan]] (between 2005-2018); Marjan Safinia (from 2009); Erica Ginsberg (from 2011); Niam Itani (from 2013); and Paul Szynol (between 2016-2018). The site's bespoke platform software was designed and written by co-host and webmaster [[Peter Gerard]].

Members of The D-Word engaged in two collaborative projects, composed of short films themed around ''Essays on Docs'', a reflection on filmmaking, as well as ''War and Peace'', the community's reaction to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. A novelty at the time, these films were streamed online and presented at industry events like the [[International Documentary Filmfestival Amsterdam]].

{{As of|2018|05}}, according to the website's database, The D-Word has more than 15,900 members in 127 countries.

== Characteristics ==
For her dissertation on the success of an online community, Lara Celini chose The D-Word as the case study: "The D-Word Community provides an interesting example of an online community that harnesses the power of the technology to help meet the demands of today’s fast-paced, international media environment, connecting documentary professionals on a level that was never previously possible without huge expenses and co-ordination."&lt;ref name="celini"&gt;{{cite paper
  | author = Celini, Lara 
  | title = What makes an online community successful? A Case Study of The D-Word Community
  | publisher = [[University of Stirling]]
  | date = 2005
  | version = Dissertation
  | accessdate = 2005-08-04 
  | location = Stirling
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celini found the facilitation of moderated ongoing conversations to be a key factor for the success of The D-Word, making it unique in comparison to simple [[bulletin board]]s or [[email list]]s.

== Membership ==
Members of The D-Word are professionals in various fields of the documentary film industry. Some are very experienced filmmakers, including nominees for the [[Academy Awards]], such as [[James Longley (Documentary Film Maker)|James Longley]] for ''[[Iraq in Fragments]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/BasicSearch?action=searchLink&amp;displayType=3&amp;BSFilmID=38864 Academy Awards database] James Longley&lt;/ref&gt;

Membership in The D-Word is free but not automatic. Applicants submit a request to the hosts who will consider each application based on the applicant's track record, references, and location.&lt;ref name="dword"/&gt;

The D-Word has been criticized for this restrictive approach and for the use of an outdated conferencing platform.&lt;ref name="celini"/&gt; The hosts reacted to this by adding public discussions and building their own [[internet forum]] software (developed and maintained by co-host [[Peter Gerard]]) tailored to the needs of the membership.

== Public discussions ==
In addition to the private community, The D-Word hosts week-long public discussions, moderated by the hosts, featuring guest experts from the documentary world. Past guests include [[Anand Patwardhan]], [[Albert and David Maysles|Albert Maysles]], [[Sandi Simcha DuBowski]], [[Ross McElwee]]. These discussions remain archived on the public part of the site.&lt;ref name="forum"&gt;[http://d-word.com] public discussions&lt;/ref&gt;

The D-Word's public discussions have explored topics such as "Reaching a Wider Audience" with [[Lance Weiler]]; a conference on the use of [[social networks]] like [[MySpace]] by filmmakers; a panel on new online distribution platforms for documentaries, and reactions by broadcasters to the [[broadband]] developments. Other conferences have focused on ethical issues in documentary practice (with [[Patricia Aufderheide]] of the Center for Social Media).

== Partnerships ==
The D-Word works closely with documentary organisations like the [[European Documentary Network]]. In the past, public discussions were supported by the [[Independent Feature Project]] in New York.

Members regularly attend '''International Face 2 Face''' meetings at industry events such as the [[Sheffield International Documentary Festival]], the [[International Documentary Film Festival Amsterdam]] (IDFA) or [[Silverdocs]], close to Washington DC.

==Plot==
A captive woman, forced to breed [[mutant]] children, gives birth to a stillborn. She is then killed by mutant leader Papa Hades ([[Michael Bailey Smith]]) for being unable to provide healthy offspring. Later, scientists working in an area in the New Mexico desert, designated Sector 16, are attacked by the mutant Letch.

A group of National Guardsmen in training are sent into the desert to resupply the scientists, who were working for the [[United States Department of Defense]] on installing a [[surveillance]] system (implied to be a result of the events in the first film). The soldiers arrive to find the camp apparently abandoned, and outside radio contact impossible due to the topography. When the radio operator, Spitter ([[Eric Edelstein]]), picks up a faint distress call, Sergeant Jeffrey “Sarge” Millstone ([[Flex Alexander]]) organizes a search and rescue mission, leaving behind Napoleon ([[Michael McMillian]]) and  Amber ([[Jessica Stroup]]).

The search party discovers the mutilated body of a scientist in the hills, while Amber and Napoleon pull another dying scientist out of the portable toilet. On her way to join the group, Amber is attacked by the mutant Stabber (Tyrell Kemlo), but a returning Mickey ([[Reshad Strik]]) wards him off. Just as Napoleon catches up, Mickey is pulled into a bolt-hole and killed. At the same time, the remaining troops are attacked by Letch, and Sarge is accidentally killed by Spitter's friendly fire. Napoleon and Amber reunite with the group, and Spitter is killed by an unseen mutant sabotaging his [[rappelling]] gear as the others try to lower him down the hill. With their remaining gear stolen, they are forced to try to find another way down.

The remaining troops soon locate their commanding officer, who has clearly become unhinged from recent events. He warns them of the mutants' plans to capture women for breeding and kill everyone else. He then commits suicide after telling them the only way down the hill is through the mining caves. After the group kills Stabber, Missy is captured and taken into the mining caves by Chameleon. Chameleon attempts to rape her, but Missy fights him off, only to be captured by Hades, who scares Chameleon away and savagely rapes Missy himself. The remaining troops attempt to rescue Missy, with the exception of Stump (Ben Crowley), who is killed by Letch while attempting to climb down the hill without ropes. After being separated from Crank ([[Jacob Vargas]]) and Delmar ([[Lee Thompson Young]]),  Napoleon and Amber cross paths with Chameleon, who they manage to kill. They later locate a non-violent mutant named Hansel (David Reynolds), while escaping Grabber (Gaspar Szabo). Grabber is killed by Crank after shooting Delmar. After reuniting with Napoleon and Amber, Delmar dies from his wounds, and Hansel leads Napoleon, Amber, and Crank to the exit. Along the way Crank is killed by a trapped crate of dynamite that he attempts to take with him, incidentally triggering an explosion.

After killing Letch, Napoleon and Amber find the captive Missy, and all three fight Hades, whom they manage to kill as well. The three leave the mines, but a text blended into the screen states that the National Guard trainees remain missing and Sector 16 is still not acknowledged to exist. As the survivors prepare to depart, they are watched by an unknown mutant using their surveillance equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fandango.com/thehillshaveeyes2_98802/movieoverview|title=The Hills Have Eyes 2|work=[[Fandango (company)|Fandago]]|publisher=[[NBCUniversal]] ([[Comcast]]) (70%) [[Warner Bros.]] ([[Time Warner]]) (30%)|location=[[Los Angeles]]|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
''The Hills Have Eyes 2'' began filming in the summer of 2006 in [[Ouarzazate]], [[Morocco]], where the [[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|previous movie]] was filmed.  The alternative title was The Hills Have Eyes 2: The Hills Still Have Eyes.

Writer Wes Craven's initial inspiration for the film came during a casual conversation with producer Peter Locke. Craven envisioned that the previous film's character, Brenda ([[Emilie de Ravin]]), traumatized by her suffering during the events of ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'', joins the National Guard to overcome her fears. Barely finished with basic training, Brenda receives a call from her sergeant, who explains that they are sending a team back to the New Mexico desert to eradicate the remaining mutants. Her sergeant and the team need her, for she is the only one left alive who knows the mutants' location. Because of de Ravin's involvement in the television show ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', her schedule was unable to accommodate the filming of the sequel. [[Wes Craven]] replaced her character, but retained much of the original concept, including the group of National Guard soldiers in training.&lt;ref name="THHE2"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Carolyn|first=Axelle|title=The Hills Have Eyes 2- Military Fright|work=[[Fangoria]]|publisher=The Brooklyn Company, Inc.|location=United States|date=February 2007|asin=B001QL5G42|url=|volume=28|issue=260|issn=0164-2111|oclc=4618144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A one-minute [http://www.foxatomic.com/#PAGE_100:movie=/content/movies/trl_hhe2_v01r01.flv teaser trailer] was released on December 12, 2006. The teaser featured "Insect Eyes," a song by indie folk recording artist [[Devendra Banhart]]. In addition to that, a series of clips with an introduction by [[Wes Craven]] and a small gallery can be found on the [http://www.foxatomic.com Fox Atomic] website. Also on Fox Atomic is a soundless clip of the mutant Grabber attacking Amber.

Craven originally looked at Michael J. Bassett, the director of ''[[Deathwatch (2002 film)|Deathwatch]]'', to take over the directing role, but ultimately chose Martin Weisz after scheduling conflicts with Bassett. ''The Hills Have Eyes 2'' had a budget of [[USD|$]]15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/governmentFilingsNews/idUKN2528049220070325?sp=true|title=Four turtles overtake "300" soldiers at box office|first=Dean|last=Goodman|work=[[Reuters]]|publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]|location=[[London]]|date=March 25, 2007|accessdate=August 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The total gross at the [[box office]] of ''The Hills Have Eyes 2'' was $37.6 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=hillshaveeyes207.htm|title=The Hills Have Eyes 2 (2007)|work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|location=United States|accessdate=January 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critic Matt Seitz of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote in his review: "[[Wes Craven]]’s 1977 film, ''The Hills Have Eyes'', in which suburbanites battled mutant cannibals, was a pulpy parable of the thin line separating civilization from savagery. The 2006 remake ''[[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|The Hills Have Eyes]]'' was basically the same movie with glossier production values and a less satirical, more bludgeoning approach to violence. This follow-up — in which [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] trainees are trapped on a former atomic test site and are stalked by flesh-eating freaks headquartered in a warrenlike mountain hideout — is essentially a catalog of transgressive images, lighted and edited like a heavy-metal video."&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|first=Matt Zollier|last=Seitz|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/24/movies/24eyes.html|title=Forget the Eyes. The Teeth and Tongues Are Worse.|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=[[The New York Times Company]]|location=[[New York City]]|date=March 24, 2007|accessdate=January 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott Tobias of ''[[The A.V. Club]]'' wrote in his review: "The premise for ''The Hills Have Eyes 2'', the quickie follow-up to [[Alexandre Aja]]'s skillful but gratuitous [[The Hills Have Eyes (2006 film)|2006 remake of Craven's original]], seems like a perfect opportunity to give the mutants their due, since it deploys a group of military people back to the scene of the crime. And yet it stupidly does the opposite, reducing the mutants to mine-dwelling freaks who murder and rape because, well, that's what they do. After a prologue so repugnant that it's unworthy of description, the film touches down in [[New Mexico]]'s "Sector 15", where a handful of military technicians are busy installing a top-secret surveillance system. When a group of National Guard trainees are dispatched to the site to deliver equipment, they're shocked to discover the men either missing or dead, and they start combing the surrounding hills on a search-and-rescue mission. What they don't realize is that the mutants are luring them into various traps designed to kill the men and abduct the women for (ugh) breeding purposes. So it's up to these unseasoned and often downright inept soldiers to fight their way out of trouble. Directed by music-video veteran [[Martin Weisz]]—in the future, can producers please look elsewhere for talent?—''The Hills Have Eyes 2'' assembles the most motley group of incompetents this side of a [[Police Academy (franchise)|''Police Academy'' movie]], yet somehow misses the laughs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/review/the-hills-have-eyes-2-3538|title=The Hills Have Eyes 2|first=Scott|last=Tobias|work=[[The A.V.

'''Transnational organized crime''' ('''TOC''') is [[organized crime]] coordinated [[transnational crime|across national borders]], involving groups or networks of individuals working in more than one country to plan and execute illegal business ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measures to Control Transnational Organized Crime, Summary|author=Yuriy A. Voronin|year=2000|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/184773.pdf|website=National Criminal Justice Reference Service (NCJRS)|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=February 28, 2017|id=
Document No. NCJ 184773}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to achieve their goals, these criminal groups use systematic violence and corruption. The most commonly seen transnational organized crimes are [[money laundering]]; [[human smuggling]]; [[cyber crime]]; and [[Human trafficking|trafficking of humans]], drugs, weapons, kidnapping, people smuggling, [[Poaching|endangered species]], body parts, or [[nuclear material]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

==History==
Prior to [[World War I]], several organizations were created to formalize international police cooperation, but most quickly failed, primarily because public police institutions were not sufficiently detached from the political centers of their respective states to function autonomously as expert bureaucracies.&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite web|title=Bureaucratization and Social Control: Historical Foundations of International Police Cooperation|jstor=3115142}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, the First International Criminal Police Congress was held in Monaco, which saw police officers, lawyers and magistrates from 24 countries meeting to discuss arrest procedures, identification techniques, centralized international criminal records and extradition proceedings. This organization appeared poised to avoid the political forces that ended earlier organizations, but the outbreak of World War I disorganized the Congress.&lt;ref name=unodc&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Criminal Police|url=https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/data-and-analysis/bulletin/bulletin_1951-01-01_3_page003.html|website=UNODC|publisher=UNODC|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, a second International Criminal Police Congress was held in Vienna, on the initiative of Mr. Hans Schober, President of the Austrian police. Schober, eager to avoid the politics that doomed previous international police efforts, noted that ''"ours is not a political but a cultural goal. It only concerns the fight against the common enemy of humankind: the ordinary criminal."''&lt;ref name=JSTOR /&gt; This second Congress created the International Criminal Police Commission (ICPC), which served as the direct forerunner of Interpol.&lt;ref name=Interpol&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Interpol|url=http://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/History|website=Interpol|publisher=Interpol|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founding members included police officials from Russia, Austria, Germany, Belgium, Poland, China, Egypt, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Romania, Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fairtrials.net/documents/Interpol_-_FAQs.pdf |title=Interpol: Frequently Asked Questions |date=November 2011 |publisher=[[Fair Trials International]] |format=PDF |accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1926, the ICPC's General Assembly, held in Berlin, proposed that each country establish a central point of contact within its police structure: the forerunner of the National Central Bureau (NCB).&lt;ref name=Interpol /&gt; In 1938, the Nazis assumed control of the ICPC and most countries stop participating, effectively causing the ICPC to cease to exist as an international organization.

After World War II, Belgium led the rebuilding of the organization, with a new headquarters in Paris and a new name - [[Interpol]]. The United Nations did not recognize Interpol as an intergovernmental organization until 1971.&lt;ref name=Interpol /&gt; On June 17, 1971, President Nixon declared ''"America's public enemy number one in the United States is drug abuse. In order to fight and defeat this enemy, it is necessary to wage a new, all-out offensive."'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks About an Intensified Program for Drug Abuse Prevention and Control. June 17, 1971|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=3047|website=The American Presidency Project|publisher=The American Presidency Project|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this declaration, the United States began the [[War on Drugs]]. At the time, the flow of illicit narcotics into its borders was deemed a major risk to the health and safety of Americans, and as a result, enormous resources were spent in the effort to curtail both the supply of and demand for illegal drugs. In the three decades that followed President Nixon's declaration, drug trafficking served as the dominant form of what the United States and many of its allies viewed as transnational organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wechsler|first1=William|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/html/pdf/WechslerPrepared20120426.pdf|website=Washington Institute|publisher=The Washington Institut for Near East Policy|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, that viewpoint has changed. The character of transnational organized crime has changed in three major ways since the war on drugs began. Drug trafficking has become more diversified, criminal networks have harnessed new methods of conducting business, and the structure of criminal networks has changed. Organized crime has gone global, giving way to the term transnational organized crime. Global governance has failed to keep pace with economic globalization. [[Antonio Maria Costa]], former Executive Director of the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], effectively summarized the change in TOC over the last quarter century by saying, "as unprecedented openness in trade, finance, travel and communication has created economic growth and well-being, it has also given rise to massive opportunities for criminals to make their business prosper."&lt;ref name=unodc /&gt;

==Effects==
Transnational organized crime is widely opposed on the basis of a number of negative effects. It can undermine democracy, disrupt [[free market]]s, drain national assets, and inhibit the development of stable societies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} In doing so, it has been argued{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}, national and international criminal groups threaten the security of all nations. The victims of these transnational crime networks are governments that are unstable or not powerful enough to prevent them, with the networks conducting illegal activities that provide them with profits. Transnational organized crimes interrupt peace{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} and stability{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} of nations worldwide, often using [[bribery]], violence, or terror to meet their needs.

TOC is insufficiently understood, according to the Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.&lt;ref name=unodc /&gt; In the most recent full-scale United Nations assessment of TOC, conducted in 2010, the Executive Director states, ''"there is a lack of information on transnational criminal markets and trends. The few studies that exist have looked at sections of the problem, by sector or country, rather than the big picture. Without a global perspective there cannot be evidence-based policy."''&lt;ref name=unodc /&gt; In response to the threat, law enforcement agencies have created a number of effective approaches for '''combating''' this transnational organized crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effectively Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/organized-crime/pages/effective-practices.aspx#note1|website=National Institute of Justice|publisher=Office of Justice Programs|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Louise I. Shelley (Director of the [[Terrorism, Transnational Crime and Corruption Center]] at [[George Mason University]]) has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Transnational crime will be a defining issue of the 21st century for policymakers - as defining as the Cold War was for the 20th century and colonialism was for the 19th. Terrorists and transnational crime groups will proliferate because these crime groups are major beneficiaries of globalization. They take advantage of increased travel, trade, rapid money movements, telecommunications and computer links, and are well positioned for growth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.american.edu/traccc/] (This article incorporates text from the [[U.S. Department of State]] that is believed to be in the [[public domain]].)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Combating transnational organized crime==
Most illicit trafficking begins or ends in the world's greatest economic powers, such as the [[G8|G8 (forum)]]. In other words, the world’s largest trading partners are also the world’s greatest markets for illicit goods and services. Many of these world powers have recently taken steps to combat TOC in a large, collective, international effort with partners and allies. Several organizations around the world have initiated efforts to combat TOC whose success or failure have yet to be determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime/strategy|website=White House|publisher=National Security Council|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the UN Asia and Far East Institute (UNAFEI), combating transnational organized crime relies first and foremost on effective investigative techniques and prosecutorial tools. Three techniques in particular stand out as the most important in combating transnational organized crime: [[electronic surveillance]], [[undercover operation]]s, and the use of [[confidential informant]]s (CIs),&lt;ref name=unafei&gt;{{cite web|title=Effective Methods to Combat Transnational Organized Crime in Criminal Justice Processes |url=http://www.unafei.or.jp/english/pdf/PDF_rms/no58/58-05.pdf|website=UNAFEI|author=Ohr, Bruce G. |publisher=United Nations|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with electronic surveillance being the single most important and effective law enforcement tool against TOC.&lt;ref name=unafei /&gt; Electronic surveillance provides reliable, often irrefutable evidence of crimes through a participant's own words or image. This form allows law enforcement to learn of conspirators' plans before they are carried out and is particularly helpful in combating TOC because it enables law enforcement in any country to obtain evidence of co-conspirators in other countries. Obtaining evidence of conspiratorial planning internationally would otherwise be very difficult.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

After electronic surveillance, the second most important tool is undercover operations,&lt;ref name=unafei /&gt; Through undercover operations, law enforcement agents can infiltrate the highest levels of organized crime by posing as criminals themselves when real criminals discuss their plans and seek assistance in committing crimes. Over time, agents can gain the confidence of criminals and induce them to reveal information on past or ongoing criminal activities.{{citation needed |date=October 2016}} followed by CIs refers to individuals who are not willing to testify but who provide information or assistance to law enforcement in exchange for money or lenient treatment for their own crimes and with the promise of confidentiality.&lt;ref name=unafei /&gt; In many cases,{{which|date=October 2016}} CIs are engaged in criminal activity themselves and can therefore provide valuable direct evidence regarding the criminal activities being conducted by their criminal associates. Such evidence frequently enables law enforcement officers to obtain warrants authorizing electronic surveillance. In rare cases, the court may order the disclosure of a CIs identity to a defendant, such as when the informant can provide evidence that may exculpate the defendant.{{citation needed |date=October 2016}}

==Enforcement in the United States==

===Tools of Prosecution=== 
The following are some of the methods used by authorities in the US to combat transnational organised crime:
* [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]]
* [[United States Organized Crime Strike Force|Organized Crime Strike Force Units]]
* [[Legal immunity|Immunity System]]{{clarify|date=October 2016}}
* [[Witness Protection|Witness Protection Programs]]
* [[Forfeiture (law)|Forfeiture]]{{dubious|date=October 2016}}
* [[Sentence (law)|Sentences]]

===White House Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime===
In May 2010, the [[White House]] released its [[National Security Strategy (United States)|National Security Strategy]], detailing the need to aggressive combat transnational organized crime. This strategy document states, ''"Combating transnational criminal and trafficking networks requires a multidimensional strategy that safeguards citizens, breaks the financial strength of criminal and terrorist networks, disrupts illicit trafficking networks, defeats transnational criminal organizations, fights government corruption, strengthens the rule of law, bolsters judicial systems, and improves transparency. While these are major challenges, the United States will be able to devise and execute a collective strategy with other nations facing the same threats."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NATIONAL SECURITY  STRATEGY: May 2010|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf|website=The White House|publisher=The White House|accessdate=4 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150927091224/https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/rss_viewer/national_security_strategy.pdf|archivedate=27 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, the [[White House]] released its '''Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime''', which reflects this change and sets forth a strategy "''to build, balance, and integrate the tools of American power to combat transnational organized crime and related threats to national security—and to urge our foreign partners to do the same.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime: Executive Summary|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime/summary|website=White House|publisher=National Security Council|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy document set out five overarching policy objectives consistent with the vision and priorities of the National Security Strategy:

# ''Protect Americans and our partners from the harm, violence, and exploitation of transnational criminal networks.'' 
# ''Help partner countries strengthen governance and transparency, break the corruptive power of transnational criminal networks, and sever state-crime alliances.'' 
# ''Break the economic power of transnational criminal networks and protect strategic markets and the U.S. financial system from TOC penetration and abuse.'' 
# ''Defeat transnational criminal networks that pose the greatest threat to national security, by targeting their infrastructures, depriving them of their enabling means, and preventing the criminal facilitation of terrorist activities.''
# ''Build international consensus, multilateral cooperation, and public-private partnerships to defeat transnational organized crime.''

===Enforcement agencies of the United States===

====National Guard====
In keeping with the [[U.S. National Security Council]]'s strategy to combat transnational organized crime, the [[National Guard Bureau]] established the CTOC [[Center of Excellence|Center of Excellence (COE)]] to educate and train [[Unified Combatant Command|Combatant Commands]], military services, [[List of federal agencies in the United States|federal agencies]], state and local law enforcement, and community leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CTOC Center of Excellence|url=http://ctoc.gov|website=CTOC Center of Excellence|publisher=National Guard Burea|accessdate=2 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151031024757/http://ctoc.gov/|archivedate=31 October 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach the United States takes in CTOC is the use of multijurisdictional task forces that combine investigative resources from several agencies so that the strength and sophistication of a task force's capabilities are greater than any single agency. Collaboration among law enforcement agencies is a key element in discovering possible links between local crimes and crimes with a transnational component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Effectively Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.nij.gov/topics/crime/organized-crime/pages/effective-practices.aspx#note1|website=Office of Justice Programs|publisher=National Institute of Justice|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Guard Bureau uses such an organization in CTOC. Its [[Multijurisdictional Counterdrug Task Force Training]] (MCTFT) program and its Western Regional Counterdrug Training Center provide the core of National Guard Bureau training and collaboration among law enforcement agencies at all levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MCTFT|url=http://mctft.org|website=MCTFT|publisher=National Guard Bureau|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States Southern Command====
{{main|United States Southern Command}} As the lead U.S. agency responsible for directing illicit trafficking detection and monitoring activities, [[U.S. Southern Command]] (SOUTHCOM) conducts operational and tactical activities in support of whole-of-government efforts to combat transnational organized crime in the maritime approaches to Central America. SOUTHCOM focuses on strengthening the security capacities of U.S. partners in Central America.&lt;ref name=ussouthcom&gt;{{cite web|title=Countering Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.southcom.mil/ourmissions/Pages/Countering%20Transnational%20Organized%20Crime.aspx|website=USSOUTHCOM|publisher=USSOUTHCOM|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another primary focus of SOUTHCOM CTOC efforts is supporting the interdiction of drug trafficking. SOUTHCOM collaborates with other agencies and nations to support CTOC efforts through detection &amp; monitoring, information sharing, and partner nation capacity building.&lt;ref name=ussouthcom /&gt;

====Department of Homeland Security====
Charged with securing the United States, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) plays an integral role in the U.S. efforts to combat transnational organized crime both at home and with partners abroad. DHS leverages and deploys numerous CTOC resources, while working closely with other federal, state and local agencies, foreign governments and partners in the private sector. Once TOC threats are identified, DHS works with partners to interdict them through strengthened interdiction, investigations, and prosecutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=https://www.dhs.gov/blog/2011/07/25/combating-transnational-organized-crime|website=Department of Homeland Security|publisher=Department of Homeland Security|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Department of State====
The [[Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs]] (INL), an agency of the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], conducts CTOC operations at home and abroad by delivering justice and fairness and by strengthening police, courts, and corrections systems. These efforts reduce the amount of crime and illegal drugs reaching U.S. shores.&lt;ref name=DOS&gt;{{cite web|title=DoS CTOC efforts|url=https://www.state.gov/j/inl/|website=Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=2 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

INL CTOC efforts include helping foreign governments build effective law enforcement institutions that combat transnational organized crime, everything from money laundering, cybercrime, and intellectual property theft to trafficking in goods, people, weapons, drugs, or endangered wildlife. INL combats corruption by helping governments build transparent and accountable public institutions—a cornerstone of strong, stable, and fair societies that offer a level playing field for U.S. businesses abroad.&lt;ref name=DOS /&gt;

====Department of Treasury====
Established in 1990, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) provides investigative support to law enforcement, intelligence, and regulatory agencies, cooperating globally with counterpart financial intelligence units (FIUs), and uses its regulatory authorities to make it more difficult for organized criminal groups to move money through the financial system. FinCEN supports the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Department of the Treasury]]'s efforts to promote the adoption of international standards involving anti-money laundering and the counter-financing of terrorism (AML/CFT), including through the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) where FinCEN led the delegation from 1994 through 1998. The National Security Council identified FinCEN as one of 34 Federal entities that it considered as having a significant role in the fight against international crime as noted in an August 2001 Government Accountability Office report.

In 2012, the Department of Treasury imposed sanctions on four key transnational organized crime groups: [[Camorra]] from [[Italy]], [[Brothers' Circle]] from [[Russia]], the [[Yamaguchi-gumi]] ([[Yakuza]]) from Japan, and [[Los Zetas]] from [[Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cohen|first=David|title=Combating Transnational Organized Crime|url=http://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Combating-Transnational-Organized-Crime.aspx|publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]]|accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Drug Enforcement Administration====
The strength and sophistication of a task force's capabilities will be stronger than any single agency's if the task force is multijurisdictional, combining investigative resources from several agencies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/nsc/transnational-crime&lt;/ref&gt; The key element in finding out possible links between local crimes and crimes with transnational component is collaboration among law enforcement agencies. To illustrate further, Operation Trifecta, a 19-month transnational investigation led by the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), involved 9 Federal agencies and 67 State and local law enforcement agencies from 8 States. In 2003, it led to the arrests of some 240 individuals charged with transnational drug trafficking.

====Federal Bureau of Investigation====
Law enforcement agencies such as the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) are employed by nation-states to counteract international organized crime. Serious international crime—such as crimes against humanity—may be investigated by the International Criminal Court, but that Court does not have the power to take suspects into custody, instead relying on the support of law enforcement and military force in relevant countries.

==International Enforcement Agencies==

===United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime===
On November 15, 2000, the [[United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime]] (UNTOC) was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and is appointed to serve as the most significant mechanism for fighting TOC internationally. The first of its kind, the convention identified TOC as criminal actions that cannot be sufficiently combated by pacts tailored to a single commercial enterprise.&lt;ref name=UNTOC&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Regime for Transnational Crime|url=http://www.cfr.org/transnational-crime/global-regime-transnational-crime/p28656|website=Council on Foreign Relations|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ad Hoc Committee was established by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] to deal with this problem by taking a series of measures against transnational organized crime. These include the creation of domestic criminal offences to combat the problem, and the adoption of new, sweeping frameworks for mutual legal assistance, extradition, law-enforcement cooperation, and technical assistance and training.

{{citation needed span|text=A recent report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime highlighted that Southeast Asia produced an estimated 48 tons of heroin in 2011. The vast majority of this cultivation – roughly twice that of Afghanistan, which arguably receives much greater attention – has occurred in the fragile state of Myanmar. The UN report estimated that the revenue generated from this trade to be worth $16.3 billion during the same period.

The revenues generated from such trafficking often lie at the root of instability and violence in the region. Additionally, the same routes used to smuggle drugs will likely be used to transport weapons and militants in the event that the current conflict expands. Reconciling the numerous armed ethnic groups that exist within Myanmar continues to be a challenge for the nascent government. A strong drug trade will only complicate negotiations between government officials and these groups.|date=October 2016}}

Combating TOC internationally proves difficult because so many governments and economies benefit enormously from TOC. For example, the Russia government benefits from money gained through cybercrime and through ties between TOC and it energy exporters. China’s economy also benefits from cybercrime as well as from counterfeiting. West African and Latin American politicians are either coerced by or maintain financially beneficial relationships with drug traffickers.&lt;ref name=UNTOC /&gt;

UNTOC ability to help combat CTOC is compounded by its inability to directly assist countries that are incapable of adhering to the convention’s guidelines. Most countries agreed for a necessary, innovative, and more strategic approach at the 2010 conference of parties, yet to date no significant employment of tactics or policy has been determined. Voluntary contributions account for nearly all of UNODC’s funding and the organization suffers from chronic funding and staffing shortages. This limits UNODC’s overall effectiveness.&lt;ref name=UNTOC /&gt;

The UN General Assembly has also issued many resolutions to combat TOC; however, most have been ineffective because of their vagueness and irrelevancy.&lt;ref name=UNTOC /&gt;

===Interpol===
The idea of the organization known today as [[Interpol]] was born at the first International Criminal Police Congress, held in Monaco in 1914. It was officially created in 1923 with the name, International Criminal Police Commission, and renamed in 1956 with the name, Interpol. Today, it is the largest international police organization in the world and is made up of 190 member nations. Each member nation staffs a national central bureau that communicates and cooperates with other member nations. Its mission is ''""Preventing and fighting crime through enhanced cooperation and innovation on police and security matters"''.&lt;ref name=Interpol2&gt;{{cite web|title=Interpol Overview|url=http://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/Overview|website=Interpol|publisher=Interpol|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the organization Interpol exists to coordinate intelligence efforts between national law enforcement agencies, it is not an international police force{{clarify|date=October 2016}}, and indeed no such international law enforcement body with universal jurisdiction exists.

The agency's number one priority is to maintain a secure global police information system between the National Central Bureaus of each member nation. In addition to this priority, Interpol provides round-the-clock support to police and law enforcement agencies of all member nations. It also continuously attempts to innovate and enhance the tools used to fight crime and it assists in the identification of crimes and criminals.  Finally, it delivers high-level training, certification and accreditation to law enforcement personnel.&lt;ref name=Interpol2 /&gt;

Like most international CTOC organizations, Interpol suffers from continuously high levels of underfunding. In 2010, it operated on roughly $75 million budget. Since it holds no authority to conduct independent investigations or to arrest suspects, it is only as strong as the host country's police force.&lt;ref name=Interpol2 /&gt;

===World Bank===
With a membership of 188 nations, the [[World Bank]] is nearly the same size as Interpol (190) and although CTOC is not its primary mission, the World Bank does attempt to combat TOC by conducting assessments of anti-money laundering provisions and carrying out anti-corruption efforts. Its efforts are hindered, however, by the lack of concrete mandates and authorities. In a 2009 World Bank paper entitled, "Slavery and Human Trafficking International Law and the Role of the World Bank", the author states that "the World Bank’s mandate appears to permit preventive action", thereby lending doubt whether or not the World Bank is even permitted by UN mandate to involve itself in the fight against human trafficking.&lt;ref name=WorldBank&gt;{{cite web|title=Slavery and Human Trafficking  International Law and the  Role of the World Bank|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/SOCIALPROTECTION/Resources/SP-Discussion-papers/Labor-Market-DP/0904.pdf|website=World Bank|publisher=World Bank|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing the detrimental impact on its mission{{clarify|date=October 2016}}, the World Bank made a $1.5 billion pledge in 2011 to help combat TOC in the coming years.&lt;ref name=UNTOC /&gt;

In another CTOC initiative, the World Bank is partnered with the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] in the Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative (StAR). This initiative helps to recover corruption related proceeds by creating an effective and collaborative environment for global law enforcement policy development.&lt;ref name=WorldBank /&gt;

===International Monetary Fund===
The [[International Monetary Fund]] also conducts assessments of anti-money laundering provisions in countries.&lt;ref name="UNTOC"/&gt;

===Europol===
[[Europol]] is the law enforcement agency of the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]] whose main goal is to help achieve a safer Europe for the benefit of all EU citizens. The organization does so by assisting the EU Member States in their fight against serious international crime and terrorism.&lt;ref name=Europol&gt;{{cite web|title=About Europol|url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/content/page/about-europol-17|website=Europol|publisher=Europol|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Europol officers hold no authority to conduct arrests but they support EU law enforcement colleagues by gathering, analyzing and disseminating information and coordinating operations. Europol uses the information to prevent, detect and investigate offenses, and to track down and prosecute those who commit them. Europol experts and analysts take part in Joint Investigation Teams which help solve criminal cases on the spot in EU countries.&lt;ref name=Europol /&gt;

===Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering===
The [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering|Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF)]], an initiative of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), is an inter-governmental body established in 1989 by the Ministers of its Member jurisdictions. The objectives of the FATF are to ''"set standards and promote effective implementation of legal, regulatory and operational measures for combating money laundering, terrorist financing and other related threats to the integrity of the international financial system."'' To this end, the FATF developed a number of recommendations that have been recognized by law enforcement agencies around the world as the standard in the combating of TOC; specifically in the fight against money laundering, terror financing, and the proliferation of [[weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref name=FATF&gt;{{cite web|title=Who is FATF|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/pages/aboutus/|website=FATF|publisher=FATF|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help combat CTOC, the FATF maintains a policy that has proven successful thus far, in which it "names and shames" that jurisdictions that choose to not cooperate with FATF. It also enlists the help of cooperating countries in the crafting of legislative frameworks used in the effort to combat money laundering.&lt;ref name=FATF/&gt;

[[File:Guildhall Museum Collection- Drusilla Dunford Money Table Sampler 3304.JPG|thumb|A [[Sampler (needlework)|sampler]] in the [[Rochester Guildhall|Guildhall Museum]] of [[Rochester, Medway|Rochester]] illustrates the conversion between pence and shillings and shillings and pounds.]]
'''£sd''' (occasionally written '''Lsd''', spoken as "pounds, shillings and pence" or pronounced /ɛlɛsˈdiː/ ell-ess-dee) is the popular name for the pre-decimal [[currency|currencies]] once common throughout Europe, especially in the [[British Isles]] and hence in several countries of the [[British Empire]] and subsequently the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]]. The abbreviation originates from the Latin currency denominations ''[[libra (weight)|librae]]'', ''[[solidus (coin)|solidi]]'', and ''[[denarius|denarii]]''.&lt;ref&gt;C. H. V. Sutherland, ''English Coinage 600-1900'' (1973, {{ISBN|0-7134-0731-X}}), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], which was one of the last to abandon the system, these were referred to as ''[[pound sterling|pounds]]'', ''[[shilling]]s'', and ''[[pence]]'' (''pence'' being the plural of ''penny'').

This system originated in the classical [[Roman Empire]]. It was re-introduced into Western Europe by [[Charlemagne]], and was the standard for many centuries across the continent. In Britain, it was King [[Offa of Mercia]] who adopted the Frankish silver standard of ''librae, solidi'' and ''denarii'' in the late 8th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodgkin|first=Thomas|title=The history of England … to the Norman conquest|year=1906|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|location=London, New York and Bombay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAUPAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA234&amp;dq&amp;q=&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the system was used in much of the [[British Commonwealth]] until the 1960s and 1970s, with [[Nigeria]] being the last to abandon it in the form of the [[Nigerian pound]] on 1 January 1973.

Under this system, there were 12 pence in a shilling and 20 shillings, or 240 pence, in a pound. The [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|penny]] was subdivided into 4 [[British farthing coin|farthings]] until 31 December 1960, when they ceased to be legal tender in the UK, and until 31 July 1969 there were also [[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|halfpennies]] ("ha'pennies") in circulation. The advantage of such a system was its use in [[Mental calculation|mental arithmetic]], as it afforded many [[divisor|factor]]s and hence fractions of a pound such as tenths, eighths, sixths and even sevenths and ninths if the [[Guinea (British coin)|guinea]] (worth 21 shillings) was used. When dealing with items in dozens, multiplication and division are straightforward; for example, if a dozen eggs cost four shillings, then each egg was priced at fourpence.

As countries of the British Empire became independent, some abandoned the £sd system quickly, while others retained it almost as long as the UK itself. Australia, for example, only changed to using a decimal currency on 14 February 1966. Still others, notably [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[decimalisation|decimalised]] only when the UK did. The UK abandoned the old penny on [[Decimal Day]], 15 February 1971, when one pound sterling became divided into 100 [[Penny (British decimal coin)|new pence]]. This was a change from the system used in the earlier wave of decimalisations in Australia, [[New Zealand]], [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]], in which the pound was replaced with a new major currency called either the "dollar" or the "rand". The British [[Shilling (United Kingdom)|shilling]] was replaced by a [[Five pence (British coin)|5 new pence coin]] worth one-twentieth of a pound.

For much of the 20th century, £sd was the monetary system of most of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, the major exceptions being [[Canadian dollar|Canada]] and [[Indian rupee|India]].

Historically, similar systems based on [[Roman coinage]] were used elsewhere; e.g., the division of the ''[[livre tournois]]'' in [[France]] and other [[Pre-decimal currency|pre-decimal currencies]] such as [[Spain]], which had 20 [[maravedí]]s to 1 [[Spanish real|real]] and 20 reals to 1 duro or 5 [[Spanish peseta|pesetas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Walkingame | first = Francis | author-link =| last2 =  | first2 = | author2-link =  | title = The Tutor's Assistant | page = 96 | year =1874| url = | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

In the classical [[Roman Empire]], standard coinage was established to facilitate business transactions. 12 [[Denarius|denarii]] were rated equal to 1 gold [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] – a 4th-century Roman coin that was rare but which still circulated; and, since 240 denarii were cut from one [[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Mass and coins|Roman ''libra'']] of silver,&lt;!-- valued at 1 gold solidus, NOTE TO EDITORS: this phrase is logically inconsistent, can someone please check it out - should be 20 I imagine --&gt; 240 denarii therefore equalled one pound (''livre'' in France, ''peso'' in Spain, etc.). Following the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], new currencies were introduced in Western Europe though (Eastern) Roman currencies remained popular. In the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern Roman Empire]], the currencies gradually evolved away from the solidi and denarii.

In the eighth century, [[Charlemagne]] re-introduced and refined the system by decreeing that the [[Commodity money|money]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] should be the [[silver]] [[denarius]], containing 22.5 grains of silver. As in the old Roman Empire, this had the advantage that any quantity of money could then be determined by counting ([[Bank teller|telling]]) coins rather than by weighing silver or gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Different monetary systems based on units in ratio 20:1 &amp; 12:1 (L:S &amp; S:D) were widely used in Europe in medieval times.&lt;ref name=Spufford1986&gt;{{cite book |url= |title=Handbook of medieval exchange; Introduction |author=Peter Spuffords |year=1986 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The English name ''pound'' is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] adaptation of the Latin phrase ''libra pondo'' 'a pound weight'.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', ''s.v.'' 'pound'&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing conventions and pronunciations==
[[File:Drury Lane Notice Board VA.jpg|thumb|Notice board displaying the entry prices for the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, around 1946]]
There were several ways to represent amounts of money in writing, with no formal convention:

£2.3s.6d. (two pounds, three shillings and sixpence)
&lt;br&gt;Unless there was cause to be punctilious, spoken: "two pound(s), three and six". Whether "pound" or "pounds" was used depended upon the speaker, varying with class, region and context.

*1/– (one shilling, colloquially "a bob"; the slash sign derives from the older style of a [[long s]] for [[Solidus (coin)|"solidus"]], which is also one name for the sign itself; the '–' is used in place of '0', meaning "zero pence").&lt;ref name="OxfordDictionariesSolidus"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/solidus?q=solidus|title=solidus: definition of solidus in Oxford dictionary (British &amp; World English)|accessdate=2014-06-10|deadurl=no|archivedate=2014-06-10|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140610111151/https://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/solidus?q=solidus|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fowler | first= Francis George| title= The concise Oxford dictionary of current English| page = 829 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=p35JAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA829&amp;dq="long+s"+shilling}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*11d. (elevenpence)
*{{frac|1|1|2}}d (a penny halfpenny, three halfpence – note that the ''lf'' in ''halfpenny'' and ''halfpence'' was always silent; they were pronounced "hayp'ny" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|p|n|i}} &lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/halfpenny|title=halfpenny - definition of halfpenny in English from the Oxford dictionary|work=oxforddictionaries.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "haypence" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|eɪ|p|ən|s}}&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|work=[[The Chambers Dictionary]]|page=755| title=half|year=1993|ISBN=0550102558}}&lt;/ref&gt; – hence the occasional spellings ''ha'penny'' and ''ha'pence'')
*2/– (two shillings, or one [[Two shillings (British coin)|florin]], colloquially "two-bob bit")
*2/6 (two shillings and six pence, usually said as "two and six" or a "half-crown"; the value could also be spoken as "half a crown", but the coin was always a half-crown)
*4/3 ("four and threepence", the latter word pronounced "thruppence" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|r|ʌ|p|ən|s}}, "threppence" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|r|ɛ|p|ən|s}} or "throopence", -oo- as in "foot" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|θ|r|ʊ|p|ən|s}}, or "four-and-three")
*5/– (five shillings, one [[Crown (British coin)|crown]], "five bob", a dollar)
*£1.10s.– (one pound, ten shillings; one pound ten, "thirty bob")
*£1/19/{{frac|11|3|4}}d. (one pound, nineteen shillings and elevenpence three farthings: a [[psychological pricing|psychological price]], one farthing under £2)
*£14.8s.2d (fourteen pounds, eight shillings and twopence – pronounced "tuppence" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ʌ|p|ən|s}} – in columns of figures. Commonly read "fourteen pound(s) eight and two")

[[Halfpenny (British pre-decimal coin)|Halfpennies]] and [[Farthing (British coin)|farthings]] (quarter of a penny) were represented by the appropriate symbol ({{frac|1|4}} for farthing, {{frac|1|2}} for halfpenny, or {{frac|3|4}} for three farthings) after the whole pence.

A convention frequently used in retail pricing was to list prices over one pound all in shillings, rather than in pounds and shillings; for example, £4-18-0 would be written as 98/– (£4.90 in decimal currency). This is still seen in [[Beer in Scotland#Shilling categories|shilling categories of Scottish beer]], such as 90/– beer.

Sometimes, prices of luxury goods and furniture were expressed by merchants in [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]], although the guinea coin had not been struck since 1799. A guinea was 21 shillings (£1.05 in decimal currency). Professionals such as lawyers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Palmer|title=The Attorney and Agents new Table of Costs in the Courts of Kings Bench and Common Pleas, Fifth edition enlarged: to which is added a table of all the stamp duties|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_UZfAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA461|year=1823|pages=461}}&lt;/ref&gt; and physicians, art dealers, and some others stated their fees in guineas rather than pounds, while, for example, salaries were stated in pounds per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://eandt.theiet.org/content/articles/2011/12/faraday-a-man-of-contradictions/ |title=Faraday - a man of contradictions |website=Engineering and Technology|date=12 December 2011|author= Christine Evans-Pughe |accessdate= 3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, at some auctions, the purchaser would bid and pay in guineas but the seller would receive the same number of pounds; the commission was the same number of shillings. [[Tattersalls]], the main auctioneer of racehorses in the United Kingdom and Ireland, continues this tradition of conducting auctions in guineas.

A [[Threepence (British coin)|threepenny bit]] (pronounced thrupney bit) was known as a "tickey" in [[Union of South Africa|South Africa]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bEAEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA51&amp;lpg=PA51&amp;dq=tickey+south+africa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=G1jskMkXTE&amp;sig=9EhjqMqJNppOKwIfHvA2wCOEYE8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwwv656vbKAhVCVhQKHTrjCr8Q6AEIqQEwEg#v=onepage&amp;q=tickey%20south%20africa&amp;f=false Hear the Tickey Bottle Tinkle], ''The Rotarian'', June 1954&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Southern Rhodesia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YKQNAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=tickey+southern+rhodesia&amp;dq=tickey+southern+rhodesia&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwinroPr6vbKAhUILZoKHbliA8UQ6AEILjAC ''Southern Rhodesia, Past and Present''], Chronicle Stationery and Book Store, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia it was known as a tray (also spelt trey), or a tray bit, from the French "trois" meaning three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Slang Terms for Money|url=https://www.australian-coins.com/collecting-coins/slang-terms-for-money/|website=The Australian Coin Collecting Blog|accessdate=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fourpence was often known as a "[[Groat (coin)|groat]]", although the coin of that name was withdrawn in the 19th century.

A [[Sixpence (British coin)|sixpenny bit]] was a "tanner", known in Australia as a "zack". One [[Shilling (British coin)|shilling]] was a "bob", and a [[Pound sterling|pound]] a "nicker" or a "quid". The term "quid" is said to originate from the [[Latin]] phrase [[quid pro quo]]. A pound note was also sometimes called simply "a note" (e.g., "You owe me 50 notes").

A ten-shilling note was sometimes known as "half a bar".

A two-shillings-and-sixpence piece, in use until the introduction of decimal currency, was known as "[[Half crown (British coin)|half a crown]]" or  "a half crown". [[Crown (British coin)|Crown]] coins (with a value of five shillings) were latterly issued only as commemorative pieces.

A two-shilling piece known as a [[Two shillings (British coin)|florin]] (an early attempt at decimalisation, being {{frac|£|1|10}}, and equal to 10 new pence after decimalisation) was in everyday use; it was referred to as "two bob", a "two-shilling bit", or a "two-bob-bit".

==In popular culture==

The currency of [[Lancre]], a kingdom in the fictional world of [[Discworld]], is a parody of the £sd system.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

The currency of knuts, sickles and galleons in the [[Harry Potter]] books is also a parody of the £sd system, with 29 knuts to a sickle and 17 sickles to a galleon.

[[LSD|Lysergic acid diethylamide]] was sometimes called "pounds, shillings and pence" during the 1960s, because of the abbreviation LSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=Paul|title=Slang: The Authoritative Topic-By-Topic Dictionary of American Lingoes from All Walks of Life|year=1998|publisher=Pocket Books|page=134|isbn=0-671-54920-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English rock group [[The Pretty Things]] released a 1966 single titled "£.s.d." that highlighted the [[double entendre]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theprettythings.com/disco.html The Pretty Things discography&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chemical Defence Experimental Establishment]] called the first field trial with LSD as a chemical weapon "Moneybags" as a pun.&lt;ref name="Roberts2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andy Roberts|title=Albion Dreaming: A popular history of LSD in Britain (Revised Edition with a new foreword by Dr. Sue Blackmore)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2caIAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52|date=30 September 2008|publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd|isbn=978-981-4328-97-5|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The score of 26 at [[darts]] (one dart in each of the top three spaces) was sometimes called "half-a-crown" as late as the 1990s, though this did start to confuse the younger players. 26 is also referred to as "Breakfast", since 2/6 or half a crown was the standard cost for breakfast pre-decimalisation.

== Today ==
Even today, and for all time,&lt;ref name=BOExcg /&gt; bank notes that are no longer legal tender, including those that were issued pre-decimalisation, are exchangeable for their face value (regardless of the possible greater worth if sold or auctioned) if they are taken directly (or posted) to the Bank of England building in Threadneedle Street, London.&lt;ref name=BOExcg&gt;{{Cite web | author=Bank of England | title=Exchanging withdrawn Bank of England banknotes | url=http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/banknotes/Pages/about/exchanges.aspx | access-date=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last £sd coins to cease being legal tender in the UK after decimal day were the Sixpence (withdrawn 1980), the Shilling (withdrawn 1991) and the Florin (withdrawn 1993). In Australia, as of 2018, these coins can still be found in circulation occasionally as 5, 10 and 20 cent coins. The last £sd bank note to cease to be legal tender anywhere in the world was the Isle of Man ten shilling note, which ceased to be legal tender there in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.im/news/2013/aug/01/withdrawal-of-plastic-manx-1-note/|title=Withdrawal of Manx Plastic £1 note|publisher=Isle of Man Government|accessdate=2 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
