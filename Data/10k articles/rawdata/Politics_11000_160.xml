'''Ahmed al-Gizawi''' ({{lang-ar|أحمد الجيزاوي}}), also known as '''Ahmed Mohammed Tharwat Al-Sayyid''', is an [[Egypt]]ian human rights lawyer and activist. His arrest in [[Saudi Arabia]] in April 2012 caused heavy protests in Egypt.&lt;ref name="BBC-SAE"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17881733 Egyptian protests over detained lawyer shut Saudi embassy], ''[[BBC News]]'', 28 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reuters=SAE"&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/28/us-saudi-egypt-idUSBRE83R09220120428 Saudi recalls ambassador, shuts embassy in Egypt], ''[[Reuters]]'', 28 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest==
On 17 April 2012, al-Gizawi was detained shortly after his arrival in Saudi Arabia, which some believe was because he had filed a lawsuit in a South Cairo court against Saudi monarch King Abdullah Bin Abdel Aziz Al-Saud on behalf of Egyptian citizens held without charge in Saudi prisons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/40577/Egypt/Politics-/ElGizawi-case-to-be-transferred-to-Saudi-pretrial-.aspx  El-Gizawi case to be transferred to Saudi pre-trial committee", ''Ahram Online'' (1 May 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt;  According to al-Gizawi's wife, he had arrived for a pilgrimage, not knowing he had been sentenced [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] to a year in prison and 20 lashes for insulting the king.  

However, Ahmed Kattan, the Saudi Ambassador to Egypt, in a statement released by the Saudi Embassy, said "The whole story is a complete fabrication." Kattan added, "No Saudi court has passed a sentence or one of flogging against the detained Egyptian ..."  He also said "Saudi laws and regulations do not permit the authorities to put a non-Saudi citizen on trial in absentia for acts committed outside its territory."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2012/1095/eg6.htm |title="Could be whipped", ''Al Ahram'' No. 1095 (25 April – 1 May 2012) |access-date=2 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429231534/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2012/1095/eg6.htm |archive-date=29 April 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Saudi officials said that al-Gizawi had been arrested at the [[King Abdulaziz International Airport]] near [[Jeddah]] on 17 April for possession of 21,000 [[Alprazolam|Xanax]] [[anti-anxiety]] pills, which are banned in the country.&lt;ref name="Reuters=SAE"/&gt; They expressed doubt that he intended to go on a [[pilgrimage]] ([[Umrah]]), as he was not wearing the typical white pilgrim dress ([[Ihram]]).&lt;ref name="BBC-SAE"/&gt; 

==Protests==
Protesting al-Gizawi's detention, around 1,000 Egyptians demonstrated in front of the Saudi embassy in [[Cairo]] on 27 April, demanding release of al-Gizawi and of the other Egyptians held in Saudi jails.&lt;ref name="Reuters=SAE"/&gt; Following the protests, Saudi authorities announced the closure of the Saudi embassy and other consulates in Egypt.  Egypt's head of military council, [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]], said he was working to heal the rift with Saudi Arabia over the surprise Saudi decision.&lt;ref name="Reuters=SAE"/&gt; Many observers said that it is the worst falling-out between the two countries since Saudi Arabia severed ties after Egypt signed a peace deal with Israel in 1979.&lt;ref name="BBC-SAE"/&gt; A Saudi spokesperson said threats to the Saudi embassy in Cairo had led to the suspension of diplomatic and consular services for Egyptian workers and Muslim pilgrims headed for Islam's holiest sites, located in western Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2012/04/2012428145141344663.html|title=Saudi closes embassy in Egypt over protests |publisher=Al Jazeera|date=28 April 2012|accessdate=30 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaeda operates as a [[Social network|network]] of [[Islamic extremist]]s and [[Salafi jihadism|Salafist jihadists]]. The organization has been designated as a [[List of designated terrorist groups|terrorist group]] by the [[United Nations Security Council]], the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), the [[European Union]], the United States, the United Kingdom, Russia, India, and various other countries (see [[#Designation as a terrorist group|below]]). Al-Qaeda has mounted attacks on civilian and military targets in various countries, including the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]], the [[September 11 attacks]], and the [[2002 Bali bombings]]. The United States government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the "[[War on Terror]]", which sought to undermine Al-Qaeda and its allies. The deaths of key leaders, including that of [[death of Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Laden]], have lead al-Qaeda's operations to shift from the [[Wikt:top-down|top down]] organization and planning of attacks, to the planning of attacks which are carried out by associated groups and ''[[Lone wolf (terrorism)|lone-wolf]]'' operators. Al-Qaeda characteristically employs attacks which include [[suicide attack]]s and the simultaneous bombing of several [[Target of opportunity|targets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=107–108, 185, 270–271}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activities which are ascribed to Al-Qaeda involve the actions of those who have made a [[Promise#Islam|pledge]] of [[loyalty]] to bin Laden, or to the actions of "al-Qaeda-linked" individuals who have undergone [[Terrorist training camp|training in one of its camps]] in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq or Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=270}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda [[ideologues]] envision the removal of all foreign influences in [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]], and the creation of a new [[Caliphatism|caliphate]] ruling over the entire [[Muslim world]].&lt;ref name="spiegel1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/al-qaidas-ideology.html|title=al Qaida's Ideology|publisher=MI5|accessdate=May 19, 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090228214557/http://www.mi5.gov.uk/output/al-qaidas-ideology.html |archivedate=February 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21525400|title=Dreaming of a caliphate|date=August 6, 2011|newspaper=The Economist|accessdate=May 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Belief#Religion|beliefs]] ascribed to al-Qaeda members is the [[Wikt:conviction#Noun|conviction]] that a [[Christianity and Judaism|Christian–Jewish]] alliance is [[Conspiracy (civil)|conspiring]] to destroy [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;Fu'ad Husayn 'Al-Zarqawi, "The Second Generation of al-Qa'ida, Part Fourteen," ''Al-Quds al-Arabi'', July 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Salafist jihadism|Salafist jihadists]], members of al-Qaeda believe that the killing of [[non-combatants]] is [[Social control|religiously sanctioned]]. This belief ignores the aspects of [[Religious text#Islam|religious scripture]] which forbid the murder of non-combatants and [[Internecine war|internecine fighting]].&lt;ref name="Moghadam"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ranstorp&gt;{{cite book|last=Ranstorp|first=Magnus|title=Unconventional Weapons and International Terrorism|year=2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-48439-8|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda also opposes what it regards as [[man-made law]]s, and wants to replace them with a strict form of [[sharia law]].&lt;ref name="LT246"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lawrence Wright|title=The Looming Tower: Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11|publisher=Knopf|year=2006|page=246|isbn=0-375-41486-X|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaeda has carried out many attacks on targets which it considers ''[[kafir]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jihadi Terrorism and the Radicalisation Challenge: p.219, Rik Coolsaet – 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda is also responsible for instigating [[sectarian violence among Muslims]].&lt;ref&gt;Dragons and Tigers: A Geography of South, East, and Southeast Asia&amp;nbsp;– (2011)&amp;nbsp;– Barbara A. Weightman&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda's leaders regard [[Liberal movements within Islam|liberal Muslims]], [[Shia Islam|Shias]], [[Sufism|Sufis]] and other [[sects]] as [[Bid'ah|heretical]] and its members and sympathizers have attacked their [[mosque]]s and gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;Security strategy and transatlantic relations (2006) Roland Dannreuther&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of sectarian attacks include the [[2007 Yazidi communities bombings|Yazidi community bombings]], the [[23 November 2006 Sadr City bombings|Sadr City bombings]], the [[Ashoura massacre]] and the [[18 April 2007 Baghdad bombings|April 2007 Baghdad bombings]].&lt;ref&gt;Jihad and Just War in the War on Terror (2011) Alia Brahimi&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of bin Laden in 2011, the group has been led by Egyptian [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]].

==Organization==
Al-Qaeda's philosophy calls for the [[centralization]] of decision making, while allowing for the [[decentralization]] of execution.&lt;ref&gt;al-Hammadi, Khalid, "The Inside Story of al-Qa'ida", part 4, ''Al-Quds al-Arabi'', March 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, after the [[War on Terror]], al-Qaeda's leadership has become isolated. As a result, the leadership has become decentralized, and the organization has become regionalized into several al-Qaeda groups.&lt;ref&gt;J. Feiser – {{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FH13Ak05.html |title=Evolution of the al-Qaeda brand name |work=Asia Times |date=August 13, 2004 |accessdate=March 22, 2010 |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050423141837/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/FH13Ak05.html |archivedate=April 23, 2005 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/satran/files/twq06spring_atran.pdf|title=The Moral Logic and Growth of Suicide Terrorism&amp;nbsp;– Spring 2006|format=PDF|accessdate=March 22, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623022648/http://www.sitemaker.umich.edu/satran/files/twq06spring_atran.pdf|archive-date=June 23, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many terrorism experts do not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by al-Qaeda's leadership. However, bin Laden  held considerable ideological sway over some [[Muslim extremists]] before his death. Experts argue that al-Qaeda has fragmented into a number of disparate regional movements, and that these groups bear little connection with one another.&lt;ref name="FT Threat"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Blitz|first=James|journal=Financial Times|title=A threat transformed|date=January 19, 2010|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/af31e344-0499-11df-8603-00144feabdc0.html|accessdate=January 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This view mirrors the account given by Osama bin Laden in his October 2001 interview with [[Tayseer Allouni]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... this matter isn't about any specific person and... is not about the al-Qa'idah Organization. We are the children of an Islamic Nation, with Prophet Muhammad as its leader, our Lord is one... and all the true believers [mu'mineen] are brothers. So the situation isn't like the West portrays it, that there is an 'organization' with a specific name (such as 'al-Qa'idah') and so on. That particular name is very old. It was born without any intention from us. Brother Abu Ubaida... created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious, arrogant, brutal, terrorizing Soviet empire... So this place was called 'The Base' ['Al-Qa'idah'], as in a training base, so this name grew and became. We aren't separated from this nation. We are the children of a nation, and we are an inseparable part of it, and from those public *** which spread from the far east, from the Philippines, to Indonesia, to Malaysia, to India, to Pakistan, reaching Mauritania... and so we discuss the conscience of this nation.&lt;ref name=islamicawakening&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamicawakening.com/viewarticle.php?articleID=977&amp;pageID=64 |title=A Discussion on the New Crusader Wars: Tayseer Allouni with Usamah bin Laden |publisher=IslamicAwakening.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621142756/http://www.islamicawakening.com/viewarticle.php?articleID=977&amp;pageID=64 |archivedate=June 21, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Bruce Hoffman]], however, sees al-Qaeda as a cohesive network that is strongly led from the Pakistani tribal areas.&lt;ref name="FT Threat"/&gt;

===Leadership===
[[File:Hamid Mir interviewing Osama bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri 2001.jpg|thumb|Al-Zawahiri and Bin Laden in 2001 interview with Hamid Mir in Kabul]]

====Osama bin Laden (1988 – May 2011) ====
[[Osama bin Laden]] was the Senior Operations Chief of al-Qaeda prior to his assassination on May 1, 2011, by US forces. [[Atiyah Abd al-Rahman]] was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on August 22, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/us-official-al-qaidas-no-2-leader-atiyah-abd-al-rahman-killed-in-pakistan/2011/08/27/gIQABVppiJ_story.html|title=Al Qaidas No. 2 leader Atiyah Abd al-Rahman killed in Pakistan|work=The Washington Post|first=Dan|last=Balz|date=August 27, 2011}} {{Dead link|date=November 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden was advised by a [[shura|Shura Council]], which consists of senior al-Qaeda members. The group was estimated to consist of 20–30 people. One such member is thought to have been [[Sayed Tayib al-Madani]].

====After May 2011====
[[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] had been al-Qaeda's Deputy Operations Chief and assumed the role of commander after bin Laden's death. Al-Zawahiri replaced [[Saif al-Adel]], who had served as interim commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2011/06/16/world/middleeast/AP-ML-Al-Qaida-Zawahri.html|title=Al-Qaida Says Al-Zawahri Has Succeeded Bin Laden|agency=Associated Press|work=The New York Times |date=June 16, 2011|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2012, Pakistani intelligence officials announced that al-Rahman's alleged successor [[Abu Yahya al-Libi]] had been killed in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/world/asia/qaeda-deputy-killed-in-drone-strike-in-pakistan.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Drone Strike Killed No. 2 in Al Qaeda, U.S. Officials Say|date=June 5, 2012|work=The New York Times|first1=Declan|last1=Walsh|first2=Eric|last2=Schmitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nasir al-Wuhayshi]] was said to have become second in command in 2013. He was the leader of [[al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP), until he was killed in a US airstrike in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/17/world/middleeast/al-qaeda-arabian-peninsula-yemen-nasser-al-wuhayshi-killed.html?_r=0 Al Qaeda Confirms U.S. Strike Killed Nasser al-Wuhayshi, Its Leader in Yemen], ''The New York Times'', Kareem Fahim, June 16, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Committees}}&lt;!-- Linked from Abu-Zaid al Kuwaiti --&gt;Al-Qaeda's network was built from scratch as a conspiratorial network which drew upon the leadership of a number of regional nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gunaratna|2002|p=54}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization divided itself into several committees, which include:
* The Military Committee, which is responsible for training operatives, acquiring weapons, and planning attacks.
* The Money/Business Committee, which funds the recruitment and training of operatives through the ''[[hawala]]'' banking system. US-led efforts to eradicate the sources of [[terrorist financing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|White House|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; were most successful in the year immediately following the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Basile|2004|p=177}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Qaeda continues to operate through unregulated banks, such as the 1,000 or so ''hawaladars'' in Pakistan, some of which can handle deals of up to {{US$|10}}&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wechsler|2001|p=135}}; cited in {{Harvnb|Gunaratna|2002|p=63}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee also procures false passports, pays al-Qaeda members, and oversees profit-driven businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Businesses are run from below, with the council only being consulted on new proposals and collecting funds.&lt;br /&gt;See:
* {{Harvnb|Hoffman|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[9/11 Commission Report]]'', it was estimated that al-Qaeda required $30&amp;nbsp;million-per-year to conduct its operations.
* The Law Committee reviews [[Sharia law]], and decides upon courses of action conform to it.
* The Islamic Study/''[[Fatwā|Fatwah]]'' Committee issues religious edicts, such as an edict in 1998 telling Muslims to kill Americans.
* The Media Committee ran the now-defunct newspaper ''Nashrat al Akhbar'' ({{lang-en|Newscast}}) and handled [[public relations]].
* In 2005, al-Qaeda formed [[As-Sahab]], a media production house, to supply its video and audio materials.

===Command structure===
Al-Qaeda is not [[Military operation|operationally]] managed by Ayman al-Zawahiri. Several operational groups exist, which consult with the leadership in situations where attacks are in preparation.&lt;ref&gt;C. Glenn – [https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/al-qaeda-v-isis-leaders-structure ''The Islamists''] [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars|The Wilson Centre]] September 28, 2015 Accessed June 15, 2017 – "... Zawahiri does not claim to have direct hierarchical control over al Qaeda's vast, networked structure. Al Qaeda's core leadership seeks to centralize the organization's messaging and strategy rather than to manage the daily operations of its franchises.  But formal affiliates are required to consult with al Qaeda's core leadership before carrying out large-scale attacks."&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked in 2005 about the possibility of al-Qaeda's connection to the [[July 7, 2005 London bombings]], [[Metropolitan Police Commissioner]] [[Sir Ian Blair]] said: "Al-Qaeda is not an organization. Al-Qaeda is a way of working... but this has the hallmark of that approach... al-Qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training... to provide expertise... and I think that is what has occurred here."&lt;ref name="foxnewsblair"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Cops: London Attacks Were Homicide Blasts|date=July 15, 2005|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,162476,00.html|publisher=Fox News Channel|accessdate=June 15, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 13, 2005, ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper, reported that the July 7 bombers had acted independently of an al-Qaeda terror mastermind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=London bombings: the truth emerges|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article305547.ece|first=Jason|last=Bennetto|author2=Ian Herbert|work=The Independent|location=UK|date=August 13, 2005|accessdate=December 3, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026100045/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/crime/article305547.ece|archivedate=October 26, 2006|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nasser al-Bahri, who was Osama bin Laden's bodyguard for four years in the run-up to 9/11 wrote in his memoir a highly detailed description of how the group functioned at that time. Al-Bahri described al-Qaeda's formal administrative structure and vast arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Bahri, Nasser, ''Guarding bin Laden: My Life in al-Qaeda''. p. 185. Thin Man Press. London. {{ISBN|9780956247360}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, author [[Adam Curtis]] argued that the idea of al-Qaeda as a formal organization is primarily an American invention. Curtis contended the name "al-Qaeda" was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin Laden and the four men accused of the [[1998 US embassy bombings]] in East Africa. Curtis wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The reality was that bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned Islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy. But there was no organization. These were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and assistance. He was not their commander. There is also no evidence that bin Laden used the term "al-Qaeda" to refer to the name of a group until after September 11 attacks, when he realized that this was the term the Americans had given it.&lt;ref name="The Power of Nightmares"&gt;[https://archive.org/details/ThePowerOfNightmares ''The Power of Nightmares''], BBC Documentary.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During the 2001 trial, the [[United States Department of Justice|US Department of Justice]] needed to show that bin Laden was the leader of a criminal organization in order to charge him [[trial in absentia|''in absentia'']] under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]]. The name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of [[Jamal al-Fadl]], who said he was a founding member of the group and a former employee of bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McCloud|first=Kimberly|title=WMD Terrorism and Usama bin Laden|url=http://cns.miis.edu/reports/binladen.htm|work=CNS Reports|publisher=James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies|accessdate=May 4, 2011|author2=Osborne, Matthew|date=March 7, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110506145417/http://cns.miis.edu/reports/binladen.htm|archivedate=May 6, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Questions about the reliability of al-Fadl's testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty, and because he was delivering it as part of a [[plea bargain]] agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack US military establishments.&lt;ref name="first informant"&gt;{{Harvnb|McGeary|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/LAW/02/13/Embassy.bombings.trial/ |title=Witness: Bin Laden planned attack on U.S. embassy in Saudi Arabia

&lt;blockquote&gt;There were selective portions of al-Fadl's testimony that I believe was false, to help support the picture that he helped the Americans join together. I think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was. It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.&lt;ref name="The Power of Nightmares"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Field operatives===
[[File:Hamid Mir interviewing Osama bin Laden.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Pakistani journalist [[Hamid Mir]] interviewing [[Osama bin Laden]] in Afghanistan, 1997.]]

The number of individuals in the group who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown. Documents captured in the raid on bin Laden's compound in 2011 show that the core al-Qaeda membership in 2002 was 170.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/9243503/Secret-Osama-bin-Laden-files-reveal-al-Qaeda-membership.html Secret Osama bin Laden files reveal al Qaeda membership], ''The Telegraph'' accessed July 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, it was estimated that al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 different countries.&lt;ref name="Cassidy"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cassidy|2006|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; {{as of|2009}}, it was believed that no more than 200–300 members were still active commanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2211994/|title=The Terrorists-Are-Dumb Theory: Don't mistake these guys for criminal masterminds|first=Timothy|last=Noah|authorlink=Timothy Noah|work=Slate|date=February 25, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227091408/http://www.slate.com/id/2211994/|archivedate=February 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2004 BBC documentary ''[[The Power of Nightmares]]'', al-Qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin Laden and a small clique of close associates. The lack of any significant numbers of convicted al-Qaeda members, despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al-Qaeda existed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gerges|first=Fawaz A|title=The Far Enemy: Why Jihad Went Global|publisher=Cambridge University Press
|date=September 5, 2005|isbn=0-521-79140-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurgent forces===
According to author Robert Cassidy, al-Qaeda maintains two separate forces which are deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan. The first, numbering in the tens of thousands, was "organized, trained, and equipped as insurgent combat forces" in the Soviet–Afghan war.&lt;ref name="Cassidy"/&gt; The force was composed primarily of foreign ''mujahideen'' from Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Many of these fighters went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global ''jihad''. Another group, which numbered 10,000 in 2006, live in the West and have received rudimentary combat training.&lt;ref name="Cassidy"/&gt;

Other analysts have described al-Qaeda's rank and file as being "predominantly Arab" in its first years of operation, but that the organization also includes "other peoples" {{as of|2007|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/article/1710 Jihad's New Leaders] by Daveed Gartenstein-Ross and Kyle Dabruzzi, ''Middle East Quarterly'', Summer 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that 62% of al-Qaeda members have university education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=c841b52c-b2e7-4e41-b27e-33d10245b935&amp;k=0|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929120758/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=c841b52c-b2e7-4e41-b27e-33d10245b935&amp;k=0|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 29, 2007|title=Today's jihadists: educated, wealthy and bent on killing?|publisher=Canada.com|date=July 3, 2007|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financing===

In the 1990s, financing for al-Qaeda came partly from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden.&lt;ref name="Forbes_May_5_2011"&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/2001/09/14/0914whoisobl.html Who is Bin Laden?]. Retrieved May 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources of income included the [[heroin trade]] and donations from supporters in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf states]].&lt;ref name="Forbes_May_5_2011"/&gt; A [[WikiLeaks]]-released 2009 memo from the US Secretary of State asserted that the primary source of funding of Sunni terrorist groups worldwide was Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lichtbau and Eric Schmitt [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/06/world/middleeast/06wikileaks-financing.html Cash Flow to Terrorists Evades U.S. Efforts] ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the first pieces of evidence regarding Saudi Arabia's support for al-Qaeda was the so-called "[[The Golden Chain|Golden Chain]]", a list of early al-Qaeda funders seized during a 2002 raid in Sarajevo by Bosnian police.&lt;ref name="history commons"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historycommons.org/searchResults.jsp?searchtext=al-qaeda%20saudi%20arabia&amp;events=on&amp;entities=on&amp;articles=on&amp;topics=on&amp;timelines=on&amp;projects=on&amp;titles=on&amp;descriptions=on&amp;dosearch=on&amp;search=Go|title=History Commons|publisher=|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hand-written list was validated by al-Qaeda defector Jamal al-Fadl, and included the names of both donors and beneficiaries.&lt;ref name="history commons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/United_States_of_America_v._Usama_bin_Laden/Day_2_6_February_2001 United States of America v. Usama bin Laden]. Wikisource. Retrieved June 10, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Osama bin-Laden's name appeared seven times among the beneficiaries, while 20 Saudi and Gulf-based businessmen and politicians were listed among the donors.&lt;ref name="history commons" /&gt;  Notable donors included Adel Batterjee, and Wael Hamza Julaidan. Batterjee was designated as a terror financier by the US Department of the Treasury in 2004, and Julaidan is recognized as one of al-Qaeda's founders.&lt;ref name="history commons" /&gt;

The most prominent Saudis who supported al-Qaeda include Saudi billionaire [[Saleh Kamel]], [[Sulaiman Abdul Aziz Al Rajhi]] and Ahmad Turki Yamani. Kamel served as CEO of Dallah Al-Baraka, and was accused of funding and supporting al-Qaeda operations. Rajhi was a founder of the SAAR Foundation, and was the CEO of Al-Rajhi Bank, where he was investigated several times by US authorities for his role in financing terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118530038250476405|title=U.S. Tracks Saudi Bank Favored by Extremists|first=Glenn R.|last=Simpson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmad Turki Yamani was the son of a former Saudi Chief of Justice and former Saudi Minister of Petroleum.&lt;ref name="history commons" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB108778058589742584|title=A Sprawling Probe of Terror Funding Centers in Virginia|first=Glenn R.  |last=Simpson| authorlink=Glenn R.

Omar al-Bayoumi, who was associated with the 9/11 attacks, received a stipend from a financial group which Kamel directed.&lt;ref name="history commons" /&gt; Further, Kamel invested in a Sudanese bank which held accounts under the names of senior al-Qaeda affiliates.&lt;ref name="history commons" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB100576435457804240|title=U.S. Probes Saudi Conglomerate For Links to Islamic Militants|first1=Glenn R.|last1=Simpson|first2=Rick|last2=Wartzman|date=November 3, 2001|publisher=|accessdate=June 21, 2016|via=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the ''Wall Street Journal'', the Saudi al-Baraka Bank was also suspected of providing banking services to al-Qaeda operatives.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

Documents seized during the 2002 Bosnia raid showed that al-Qaeda widely exploited charities to channel financial and material support to its operatives across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB104794563734573400|title=List of Early al Qaeda Donors Points to Saudi Elite, Charities|first=Glenn R. |last=Simpson|date=March 19, 2003|publisher=|accessdate=June 21, 2016|via=Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, this activity exploited the International Islamic Relief Organization (IIRO) and the Muslim World League (MWL). The IIRO had ties with al-Qaeda associates worldwide, including al-Qaeda's deputy Ayman al Zawahiri. Zawahiri's brother worked for the IIRO in Albania and had actively recruited on behalf of al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name="steve emerson"&gt;Emerson, Steve (2006). ''Jihad Incorporated: A Guide to Militant Islam in the US''.

====Allegations of Qatari support====

{{see also|Qatar and state-sponsored terrorism|2017 Qatar diplomatic crisis}}
Several Qatari citizens have been accused of funding al-Qaeda. This includes [[Abd Al-Rahman al-Nuaimi]], a Qatari citizen and a human-rights activist who founded the Swiss-based [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) [[Alkarama]]. On December 18, 2013, the [[US Treasury]] designated Nuaimi as a terrorist for his activities supporting al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name="treasury press"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2249.aspx|title=Treasury Designates Al-Qa'ida Supporters in Qatar and Yemen|publisher=|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US Treasury has stated that Nuaimi "has facilitated significant financial support to al-Qaeda in Iraq, and served as an interlocutor between al-Qaeda in [[Iraq]] and Qatar-based donors".&lt;ref name="treasury press" /&gt;

Another Qatari citizen, Kalifa Mohammed Turki Subayi, was sanctioned by the US Treasury on June 5, 2008, for his activities as a "Gulf-based al-Qaeda financier". Subayi's name was added to the [[UN Security Council]]'s Sanctions List in 2008 on charges of providing financial and material support to al-Qaeda senior leadership.&lt;ref name="fiscal times qatar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="un press"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11790.doc.htm|title=Security Council Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee Amends One Entry on Its Sanctions List – Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|publisher=|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subayi allegedly moved al-Qaeda recruits to South Asia-based training camps.&lt;ref name="fiscal times qatar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="un press" /&gt; He also financially supported Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, a Pakistani national and senior al-Qaeda officer who is believed to be the mastermind behind the [[September 11]] attack according to the [[September 11 Commission]] report.&lt;ref name="9-11commission.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf|title=The 9/11 Commission Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qataris provided support to al-Qaeda through the country's largest NGO, the [[Qatar Charity]]. Al-Qaeda defector al-Fadl, who was a former member of Qatar Charity, testified in court that Abdullah Mohammed Yusef, who served as Qatar Charity's director, was affiliated to al-Qaeda and simultaneously to the [[National Islamic Front]], a political group that gave al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden harbor in [[Sudan]] in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="auto" /&gt;

Legal proceedings from the trial ''United States vs. Enaam M. Arnaout'' revealed that [[Qatar]] Charity was cited by [[Bin Laden]] in 1993 as one of the charities used to channel financial support to al-Qaeda operatives overseas.&lt;ref name="enaam arnaout"&gt;''[http://www.investigativeproject.org/documents/case_docs/2517.pdf United States vs. Enaam M. Arnaout]''&lt;/ref&gt; The same documents also report Bin Laden's complaint that the failed assassination attempt of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak had compromised the ability of al-Qaeda to exploit charities to support its operatives to the extent that it was capable of before 1995.&lt;ref name="enaam arnaout" /&gt;
Qatar Charity's track record of terror financing includes support to members of al-Qaeda in Chechnya.

==Strategy==
{{Update section|date=August 2016}}

On March 11, 2005, ''[[Al-Quds Al-Arabi]]'' published extracts from [[Saif al-Adel]]'s document "Al Qaeda's Strategy to the Year 2020".&lt;ref name=Atwan&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ypICzykNXiAC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;sig=vF2xfwHZ76rhNWD74T2nSmonrdc&amp;ei=GJo7TOLyJYH88AbAu4GPBw&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBA |first=Abdel Bari |last=Atwan |title=The Secret History of Al Qaeda |page=221 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=0-520-24974-7 |via=Google Books |date=March 11, 2005 |accessdate=May 8, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512042028/https://books.google.com/books?id=ypICzykNXiAC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;sig=vF2xfwHZ76rhNWD74T2nSmonrdc&amp;ei=GJo7TOLyJYH88AbAu4GPBw&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwBA |archivedate=May 12, 2011 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/programs/gta/single/?tx_ttnewstt_news&amp;#93;=181&amp;tx_ttnewsbackPid&amp;#93;=238&amp;no_cache=1|title=single – The Jamestown Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=April 12, 2016}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abdel Bari Atwan]] summarizes this strategy as comprising five stages to rid the [[Ummah]] from all forms of oppression:
# Provoke the United States and the West into invading a Muslim country by staging a massive attack or string of attacks on US soil that results in massive civilian casualties.
# Incite local resistance to occupying forces.
# Expand the conflict to neighboring countries, and engage the US and its allies in a long war of attrition.
# Convert al-Qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control, and via these franchises incite attacks against the US and countries allied with the US until they withdraw from the conflict, as happened with the [[2004 Madrid train bombings]], but which did not have the same effect with the [[July 7, 2005 London bombings]].
# The US economy will finally collapse by the year 2020, under the strain of multiple engagements in numerous places. This will lead to a collapse in the worldwide economic system, and lead to global political instability. This will lead to a global jihad led by al-Qaeda, and a [[Wahhabi]] [[Caliphate]] will then be installed across the world.

Atwan noted that, while the plan is unrealistic, "it is sobering to consider that this virtually describes the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|downfall of the Soviet Union]]."&lt;ref name=Atwan/&gt;

According to [[Fouad Hussein]], a Jordanian journalist and author who has spent time in prison with Al-Zarqawi, Al Qaeda's strategy consists of seven phases and is similar to the plan described in Al Qaeda's Strategy to the year 2020. These phases include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Musharbash|first1=Yassir|title=The Future of Terrorism: What al-Qaida Really Wants|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/the-future-of-terrorism-what-al-qaida-really-wants-a-369448.html|accessdate=January 15, 2015|work=Der Spiegel|date=August 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# "The Awakening." This phase was supposed to last from 2001 to 2003. The goal of the phase is to provoke the United States to attack a Muslim country by executing an attack on US soil that kills many civilians.
# "Opening Eyes." This phase was supposed to last from 2003 to 2006. The goal of this phase was to recruit young men to the cause and to transform the al-Qaeda group into a movement. Iraq was supposed to become the center of all operations with financial and military support for bases in other states.
# "Arising and Standing up", was supposed to last from 2007 to 2010. In this phase, al-Qaeda wanted to execute additional attacks and focus their attention on Syria. Hussein believed that other countries in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] were also in danger.
# Al-Qaeda expected a steady growth among their ranks and territories due to the declining power of the regimes in the Arabian Peninsula. The main focus of attack in this phase was supposed to be on oil suppliers and [[cyberterrorism]], targeting the US economy and military infrastructure.
# The declaration of an Islamic Caliphate, which was projected between 2013 and 2016. In this phase, al-Qaeda expected the resistance from Israel to be heavily reduced.
# The declaration of an "Islamic Army" and a "fight between believers and non-believers", also called "total confrontation".

According to the seven-phase strategy, the war is projected to last less than two years.

According to Charles Lister of the [[Middle East Institute]] and Katherine Zimmerman of the [[American Enterprise Institute]], the new model of al-Qaeda is to "socialize communities" and build a broad territorial base of operations with the support of local communities, also gaining income independent of the funding of sheiks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-35967409 BBC] April 6, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
The English name of the organization is a simplified [[Romanization of Arabic|transliteration]] of the Arabic noun ''{{transl|ar|DIN|al-qāʿidah}}'' ({{wikt-lang|ar|القاعدة}}), which means "the foundation" or "the base". The initial ''al-'' is the Arabic [[definite article]] "the", hence "the base".&lt;ref&gt;Arabic Computer Dictionary: English-Arabic, Arabic-English By Ernest Kay, Multi-lingual International Publishers, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Arabic, ''al-Qaeda'' has four syllables ({{IPA|/alˈqaː.ʕi.da/}}).&lt;!-- This is a phonemic transcription that differs somewhat from the transcription system described at [[Help:IPA for Arabic]]. --&gt; However, since two of the Arabic consonants in the name are not [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] found in the English language, the common naturalized [[English phonology|English pronunciations]] include {{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|k|aɪ|d|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|æ|l|ˈ|k|eɪ|d|ə}} and {{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|l|k|ɑː|ˈ|iː|d|ə}}. Al-Qaeda's name can also be [[transliteration|transliterated]] as ''al-Qaida'', ''al-Qa'ida'', or ''el-Qaida''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ibb7.ibb.gov/pronunciations/sounds/2930.ra |title=Listen to the U.S. pronunciation |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211020849/http://ibb7.ibb.gov/pronunciations/sounds/2930.ra |archivedate=December 11, 2005 |format=[[RealPlayer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden explained the origin of the term in a videotaped interview with [[Al Jazeera]] journalist [[Tayseer Alouni]] in October 2001:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The name 'al-Qaeda' was established a long time ago by mere chance. The late Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri established the training camps for our ''mujahedeen'' against Russia's terrorism. We used to call the training camp al-Qaeda. The name stayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/02/05/binladen.transcript/index.html|title=Transcript of Bin Laden's October interview|publisher=CNN|date=February 5, 2002|accessdate=October 22, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206081331/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/02/05/binladen.transcript/index.html|archivedate=December 6, 2006|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It has been argued that two documents seized from the [[Sarajevo]] office of the [[Benevolence International Foundation]] prove that the name was not simply adopted by the ''mujahideen'' movement and that a group called al-Qaeda was established in August 1988. Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group, and contain the term "al-Qaeda".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergen|2006|p=75}}. Wright indirectly quotes one of the documents, based on an exhibit from the "Tareek Osama" document presented in &lt;span class="plainlinks"&gt;[http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/bif/usarnaout10603prof.pdf ''United States v.

Former British Foreign Secretary [[Robin Cook]] wrote that the word al-Qaeda should be translated as "the database", because it originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of ''mujahideen'' militants who were recruited and trained with CIA help to defeat the Russians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Robin Cook|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development|title=Robin Cook: The struggle against terrorism cannot be won by military means|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=July 8, 2005|accessdate=May 8, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514051125/http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/jul/08/july7.development|archivedate=May 14, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2002, the group assumed the name ''Qa'idat al-Jihad'' ({{lang|ar|قاعدة الجهاد}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|qāʿidat al-jihād}}''), which means "the base of Jihad". According to [[Al-Ahram Center for Political and Strategic Studies|Diaa Rashwan]], this was "apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of Egypt's [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad|al-Jihad]], which was led by [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], with the groups Bin Laden brought under his control after his return to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/619/op13.htm After Mombassa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514233523/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2003/619/op13.htm |date=May 14, 2013 }}", ''[[Al-Ahram Weekly|Al-Ahram Weekly Online]]'', January 2–8, 2003 (Issue No. 619).

==Ideology==
{{Islamism sidebar}}
{{See also|Qutbism}}
The radical [[Islamist]] movement developed during the [[Islamic revival]] and the rise of the [[Islamism|Islamist movement]] after the [[Iranian revolution]].

Some have argued that the writings of Islamic author and thinker [[Sayyid Qutb]], inspired the al-Qaeda organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=332}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s and 1960s, Qutb preached that because of the lack of ''[[sharia]]'' law, the [[Muslim world]] was no longer [[Muslim]], and had reverted to the pre-Islamic ignorance known as ''[[jahiliyyah]]''. To restore Islam, Qutb argued that a [[vanguard]] of righteous Muslims was needed in order to establish "true [[Islamic state (government)|Islamic states]]", implement ''sharia'', and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences. In Qutb's view, the enemies of Islam included "[[Jews|world Jewry]]", which "plotted [[List of conspiracy theories#Antisemitism|conspiracies]]" and opposed Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Qutb|2003|pp=63, 69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of [[Mohammed Jamal Khalifa]], a close college friend of bin Laden: &lt;blockquote&gt;Islam is different from any other [[religion]]; it's a way of life. We [Khalifa and bin Laden] were trying to understand what Islam has to say about how we eat, who we marry, how we talk. We read Sayyid Qutb. He was the one who most affected our generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=79}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Qutb also influenced bin Laden's mentor, Ayman al-Zawahiri.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/qutb_milest_influence_obl.html|title=How Did Sayyid Qutb Influence Osama bin Laden?|publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zawahiri's uncle and maternal family patriarch, Mafouz Azzam, was Qutb's student, protégé, personal lawyer, and an executor of his estate. Azzam was one of the last people to see Qutb alive before his execution.&lt;ref&gt;Mafouz Azzam; cited in {{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work ''Knights under the Prophet's Banner.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gemsofislamism.tripod.com/milestones_qutb.html#footnote_24|title=Sayyid Qutb's Milestones (footnote 24)|publisher=Gemsofislamism.tripod.com|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Qutb's argued that many Muslims were not true Muslims. Some Muslims, Qutb argued, were [[apostate]]s. These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries, since they failed to enforce ''sharia'' law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/07spring/eikmeier.htm |title=Qutbism: An Ideology of Islamic-Fascism |first=DALE C. |last=EIKMEIER |work=Parameters |date=Spring 2007 |pages=85–98 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609120804/http://www.carlisle.army.mil/usawc/parameters/07spring/eikmeier.htm |archivedate=June 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Afghan Arabs|Afghan jihad]] against the pro-Soviet government further developed the [[Salafi jihadism|Salafist Jihadist]] movement which inspired Al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kepel|first1=Gilles|title=Jihad: The Trail of Political Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tttzgNKFAI8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;ei=0kg-VY2TEsnooASpqIDIAw&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAQ |date=2002|publisher=Harvard University Press.|ref=GKJTPI2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious compatibility==
[[Abdel Bari Atwan]] wrote that:
{{quote|While the leadership's own theological platform is essentially Salafi, the organization's umbrella is sufficiently wide to encompass various schools of thought and political leanings. Al-Qaeda counts among its members and supporters people associated with [[Wahhabism]], [[Shafi'i]]sm, [[Maliki]]sm, and [[Hanafi]]sm. There are even some Al-Qaeda members whose beliefs and practices are directly at odds with Salafism, such as [[Mohammad Yunus Khalis|Yunis Khalis]], one of the leaders of the Afghan mujahedin. He was a mystic who visited the tombs of saints and sought their blessings – practices inimical to bin Laden's Wahhabi-Salafi school of thought. The only exception to this pan-Islamic policy is [[Shia Islam|Shi'ism]]. Al-Qaeda seems implacably opposed to it, as it holds Shi'ism to be heresy. In Iraq it has openly declared war on the Badr Brigades, who have fully cooperated with the US, and now considers even Shi'i civilians to be legitimate targets for acts of violence.&lt;ref name=AbdelBariAtwan&gt;Abdel Bari Atwan.

==History==

''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2009 described five distinct phases in the development of al-Qaeda: its beginnings in the late 1980s, a "wilderness" period in 1990–1996, its "heyday" in 1996–2001, a network period from 2001 to 2005, and a period of fragmentation from 2005 to 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Jason Burke  |author2=Paddy Allen |lastauthoramp=yes |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2009/sep/10/al-qaida-five-ages-terror-attacks|title=The five ages of al-Qaida|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=March 22, 2010|date=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jihad in Afghanistan===
{{Main|Soviet–Afghan War|Jihadism}}

[[File:Afghan Muja crossing from Saohol Sar pass in Durand border region of Pakistan, August 1985.png|thumb|upright|[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]-funded and [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]]-trained Afghan [[mujahideen]] fighters crossing the [[Durand Line]] border to fight Soviet forces and the Soviet-backed [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] in 1985.]]

The origins of al-Qaeda can be traced to the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet War in Afghanistan]] (December 1979 – February 1989).&lt;ref name="AntiSoviet"/&gt; The [[United States]] viewed the conflict in Afghanistan, in terms of the [[Cold War]], with [[Marxist]]s on one side and the native Afghan ''mujahideen'' on the other. This view lead to a [[CIA]] program called [[Operation Cyclone]], which channeled funds through Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] agency to the Afghan Mujahideen.&lt;ref name="1986-1992-CIA-AND-BRITISH-RECRUIT-AND-TRAIN-MILITANTS-WORLDWIDE-TO-HELP-FIGHT-AFGHAN-WAR"&gt;{{cite web|title=1986–1992: CIA and British Recruit and Train Militants Worldwide to Help Fight Afghan War|url=http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=a86operationcyclone|publisher=Cooperative Research History Commons|accessdate=January 9, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818210324/http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=a86operationcyclone|archivedate=August 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US government provided substantial financial support to the Afghan Islamic militants. Aid to [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]], an Afghan ''mujahideen'' leader and founder of the [[Hezb-e Islami]], amounted to more than $600&amp;nbsp;million. In addition to American aid, Hekmatyar was the recipient of Saudi aid.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Peter L., ''Holy war, Inc.: inside the secret world of Osama bin Laden'', New York: Free Press, 2001. pp. 68–x69&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, after the US had withdrawn support, Hekmatyar "worked closely" with bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;Bergen, Peter L., ''Holy war, Inc.: Inside the Secret World of Osama bin Laden'', New York: Free Press, 2001., pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, a growing number of Arab ''mujahideen'' joined the ''jihad'' against the [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghan Marxist regime]], which was facilitated by international Muslim organizations, particularly the [[Maktab al-Khidamat]] (MAK).&lt;ref name="MAKTAB-AL-KHIDAMAT-GLOBALSECURITY"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maktab al-Khidamat|url=http://www.globalsecurity.o|date=January 11, 2006|accessdate=February 11, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070214205625/http://www.globalsecurity.org/security/profiles/maktab_al-khidamat.htm|archivedate=February 14, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, MAK was established in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan, by bin Laden and [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam]], a Palestinian Islamic scholar and member of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. MAK organized [[al-Qaeda safe house|guest houses]] in Peshawar, near the Afghan border, and gathered supplies for the construction of paramilitary training camps to prepare foreign recruits for the Afghan war front. MAK was funded by the Saudi government as well as by individual Muslims including Saudi businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}} Bin Laden also became a major financier of the ''mujahideen'', spending his own money and using his connections to influence public opinion about the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gunaratna|2002|p=19}}.

[[File:Omar Abdel-Rahman.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Omar Abdel-Rahman]]]]

From 1986, MAK began to set up a network of recruiting offices in the US, the hub of which was the [[Al Kifah Refugee Center]] at the Farouq Mosque on [[Brooklyn]]'s Atlantic Avenue. Among notable figures at the Brooklyn center were "double agent" [[Ali Mohamed]], whom FBI special agent Jack Cloonan called "bin Laden's first trainer",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline//////torture/interviews/cloonan.html Cloonan ''Frontline'' interview], PBS, July 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and "Blind Sheikh" [[Omar Abdel-Rahman]], a leading recruiter of ''mujahideen'' for Afghanistan. Azzam and bin Laden began to establish camps in Afghanistan in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sageman|2004|p=35}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

MAK and foreign ''mujahideen'' volunteers, or "Afghan Arabs", did not play a major role in the war. While over 250,000 Afghan ''mujahideen'' fought the Soviets and the communist Afghan government, it is estimated that were never more than 2,000 foreign ''mujahideen'' on the field at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=137}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, foreign ''mujahideen'' volunteers came from 43 countries, and the total number that participated in the Afghan movement between 1982 and 1992 is reported to have been 35,000.&lt;ref name="THE-WAR-ON-TERROR-AND-THE-POLITICS-OF-VIOLENCE-IN-PAKISTAN"&gt;{{cite web

The Soviet Union withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989. [[Mohammad Najibullah]]'s Communist Afghan government lasted for three more years, before it was overrun by elements of the ''mujahideen''.

===Expanding operations===
Toward the end of the [[Red Army|Soviet military]] mission in Afghanistan, some foreign ''mujahideen'' wanted to expand their operations to include Islamist struggles in other parts of the world, such as Palestine and [[Kashmir]]. A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed, to further those aspirations. One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda.

Research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed on August 11, 1988, when a meeting between leaders of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]], [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]], and bin Laden took place. An agreement was reached to link bin Laden's money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="RebellionWright"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Notes indicate al-Qaeda was a formal group by August 20, 1988. A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (''[[Bay'at|bayat]]''&amp;thinsp;) to follow one's superiors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|pp=133–34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir, bin Laden's former bodyguard, [[Nasser al-Bahri]], gives the only publicly available description of the ritual of giving ''bayat'' when he swore his allegiance to the al-Qaeda chief.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Bahri, Nasser, ''Guarding bin Laden: My Life in al-Qaeda''. p. 123. Thin Man Press. London. {{ISBN|9780956247360}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wright, the group's real name wasn't used in public pronouncements because "its existence was still a closely held secret."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=260}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Azzam was assassinated in 1989 and MAK broke up, significant numbers of MAK followers joined bin Laden's new organization.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In November 1989, [[Ali Mohamed]], a former special forces sergeant stationed at [[Fort Bragg]], North Carolina, left military service and moved to California. He traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and became "deeply involved with bin Laden's plans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=181}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Ali Mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin Laden's relocation to Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Osama bin Laden: The Past|url=http://www.iacsp.com/itobli3.html|accessdate=January 12, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070218211532/http://www.iacsp.com/itobli3.html|archivedate=February 18, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gulf War and the start of US enmity===
{{Main|Gulf War}}

Following the Soviet Union's withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. The [[Iraqi invasion of Kuwait]] in August 1990 had put the Kingdom and its ruling [[House of Saud]] at risk. The world's most valuable oil fields were within striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam's call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.

In the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia's own forces were outnumbered. Bin Laden offered the services of his ''mujahideen'' to [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]] to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army. The Saudi monarch refused bin Laden's offer, opting instead to allow US and allied forces to deploy troops into Saudi territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Jehl|first=Douglas|title=A Nation Challenged: Holy war lured Saudis as rulers looked away|work=The New York Times|date=December 27, 2001|pages=A1, B4|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/27/world/a-nation-challenged-saudi-arabia-holy-war-lured-saudis-as-rulers-looked-away.html|accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deployment angered bin Laden, as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the "land of the two mosques" ([[Mecca]] and [[Medina]]) profaned sacred soil. After speaking publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops, he was banished and forced to live in exile in Sudan.

===Sudan===
From around 1992 to 1996, al-Qaeda and bin Laden based themselves in Sudan at the invitation of Islamist theoretician [[Hassan al-Turabi]]. The move followed an Islamist coup d'état in Sudan, led by Colonel [[Omar al-Bashir]], who professed a commitment to reordering Muslim political values. During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established training camps.

A key turning point for bin Laden, occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the [[Oslo Accords]]. The Oslo Accords set a path for peace between Israel and [[Palestinians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|p=52}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, a young schoolgirl was killed in an unsuccessful attempt on the life of the Egyptian prime minister, [[Atef Sedki]]. Egyptian public opinion turned against Islamist bombings, and the police arrested 280 of al-Jihad's members and executed 6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=186}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to bin Laden's continuous verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, on March 5, 1994, Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan demanding bin Laden's passport. Bin Laden's Saudi citizenship was also revoked. His family was persuaded to cut off his stipend, $7&amp;nbsp;million a year, and his Saudi assets were frozen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=195}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OSAMA-BIN-LADEN-A-CHRONOLOGY-OF-HIS-POLITICAL-LIFE"&gt;{{cite web|title=Osama bin Laden: A Chronology of His Political Life|publisher=[[PBS]]|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline///shows/binladen/etc/cron.html|accessdate=January 12, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205100703/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/etc/cron.html|archivedate=December 5, 2006|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His family publicly disowned him.

In June 1995, an [[Attempted assassination of President Hosni Mubarak|attempt to assassinate Egyptian president Mubarak]] led to the expulsion of [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] (EIJ), and in May 1996, of bin Laden from Sudan.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

According to [[Pakistani-American]] businessman [[Mansoor Ijaz]], the Sudanese government offered the [[Clinton Administration]] numerous opportunities to arrest bin Laden. Ijaz's claims appeared in numerous [[op-ed]] pieces, including one in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2001/dec/05/opinion/oe-ijaz05|title=Clinton Let Bin Laden Slip Away and Metastasize|work=Los Angeles Times |date=December 5, 2001|access-date=March 22, 2010|first=Mansoor|last=Ijaz}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' co-written with former Ambassador to Sudan [[Timothy M.

The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin.

===Refuge in Afghanistan===
{{Main|Taliban's rise to power|Afghan training camp}}

After the fall of the Afghan communist regime in 1992, Afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for four years and plagued by constant infighting between various ''mujahideen'' groups.{{Citation needed|date=May 2015}} This situation allowed the Taliban to organize. The Taliban also garnered support from graduates of Islamic schools, which are called ''madrassa''. According to [[Ahmed Rashid]], five leaders of the Taliban were graduates of [[Darul Uloom Haqqania]], a madrassa in the small town of Akora Khattak.&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Rashid|2002"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rashid|2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The town is situated near Peshawar in Pakistan, but the school is largely attended by [[Afghan refugees]].&lt;ref name="Harvnb|Rashid|2002" /&gt; This institution reflected [[Salafi]] beliefs in its teachings, and much of its funding came from private donations from wealthy Arabs. Four of the Taliban's leaders attended a similarly funded and influenced madrassa in Kandahar. Bin Laden's contacts were laundering donations to these schools, and Islamic banks were used to transfer money to an "array" of charities which served as front groups for al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Napoleoni|2003|pp=121–23}}; {{Harvnb|Akacem|2005}} "Napoleoni does a decent job of covering al-Qaida and presents some numbers and estimates that are of value to terrorism scholars"&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the ''mujahideen'' who later joined the Taliban fought alongside Afghan warlord [[Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi]]'s Harkat i Inqilabi group at the time of the Russian invasion. This group also enjoyed the loyalty of most Afghan Arab fighters.

The continuing lawlessness enabled the growing and well-disciplined Taliban to expand their control over territory in Afghanistan, and it came to establish an enclave which it called the [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan]]. In 1994, it captured the regional center of Kandahar, and after making rapid territorial gains thereafter, the Taliban captured the capital city [[Kabul]] in September 1996.

In 1996, Taliban-controlled Afghanistan provided a perfect staging ground for al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kronstadt|Katzman|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While not officially working together, Al-Qaeda enjoyed the Taliban's protection and supported the regime in such a strong symbiotic relationship that many Western observers dubbed the Taliban's Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan as, “the world’s first terrorist-sponsored state.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/DIM-2017-U-016117-2Rev.pdf|title=Al-Qaeda Core: A Case Study, p. 11|last=|first=|date=|website=cna.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010011216/https://www.cna.org/cna_files/pdf/DIM-2017-U-016117-2Rev.pdf|archive-date=2018-10-10|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, at this time, only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.

While in Afghanistan, the Taliban government tasked al-Qaeda with the training of [[055 Brigade|Brigade 055]], an elite element of the Taliban's army. The Brigade mostly consisted of foreign fighters, veterans from the Soviet Invasion, and adherents to the ideology of the mujahideen. In November 2001, as [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Operation Enduring Freedom]] had toppled the Taliban government, many Brigade 055 fighters were captured or killed, and those that survived were thought to have escaped into Pakistan along with bin Laden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101011105-181591,00.html|work=Time|first=Daniel|last=Eisenberg|title=Secrets of Brigade 055|date=October 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2008, some sources reported that the Taliban had severed any remaining ties with al-Qaeda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Robertson, Nic|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/10/06/afghan.saudi.talks/?iref=mpstoryview|title=Sources: Taliban split with al Qaeda, seek peace|publisher=CNN|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, there is reason to doubt this.&lt;ref&gt;Roggio, Bill [http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2008/10/taliban_have_not_spl.php Taliban have not split from al Qaeda: sources] October 7, 2008 ''The Long War Journal''&lt;/ref&gt; According to senior US military intelligence officials, there were fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remaining in Afghanistan in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Partlow, Joshua.

===Call for global Salafi jihadism===
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}

In 1994, the Salafi groups waging [[Salafi jihadism]] in Bosnia entered into decline, and groups such as the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]] began to drift away from the Salafi cause in Europe. Al-Qaeda stepped in and assumed control of around 80% of the terrorist [[Clandestine cell system|cells]] in Bosnia in late 1995. At the same time, al-Qaeda ideologues instructed the network's recruiters to look for ''[[Jihadi international]]'' Muslims who believed that extremist-''jihad'' must be fought on a global level. Al-Qaeda also sought to open the "offensive phase" of the global Salafi ''jihad''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sageman|2004|pp=48, 51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnian Islamists in 2006 called for "solidarity with Islamic causes around the world", supporting the insurgents in Kashmir and Iraq as well as the groups fighting for a Palestinian state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Trofimov|2006|p=282}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fatwas===
In 1996, al-Qaeda announced its ''jihad'' to expel foreign troops and interests from what they considered Islamic lands. Bin Laden issued a ''fatwa'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bin Laden's Fatwa|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html|publisher=[[Al-Quds Al-Arabi|Al Quds Al Arabi]]|date=August 1996|accessdate=January 9, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070108175653/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1996.html|archivedate=January 8, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; which amounted to a public declaration of war against the US and its allies, and began to refocus al-Qaeda's resources on large-scale, propagandist strikes.

On February 23, 1998, bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, a leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, along with three other Islamist leaders, co-signed and issued a ''fatwa'' calling on Muslims to kill Americans and their allies.&lt;ref&gt;Summary taken from bin Laden's May 26, 1998, interview with American journalist [[John Miller (journalist)|John Miller]]. Most recently broadcast in the documentary ''Age of Terror'', part 4, with translations checked by Barry Purkis (archive researcher).&lt;/ref&gt; Under the banner of the World Islamic Front for Combat Against the Jews and Crusaders, they declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he ruling to kill the Americans and their allies – civilians and military – is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque [in Jerusalem] and the holy mosque [in Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in accordance with the words of Almighty Allah, 'and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together,' and 'fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ict.org.il/articles/fatwah.htm|title=Text of Fatwah Urging Jihad Against Americans|accessdate=May 15, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422210853/http://www.ict.org.il/articles/fatwah.htm|archivedate=April 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Neither bin Laden nor al-Zawahiri possessed the traditional Islamic scholarly qualifications to issue a ''fatwa''. However, they rejected the authority of the contemporary ''[[ulema]]'' (which they saw as the paid servants of ''[[jahiliyya]]'' rulers), and took it upon themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Benjamin|Simon|2002|p=117}}. "By issuing fatwas, bin Laden and his followers are acting out a kind of self-appointment as alim: they are asserting their rights as interpreters of Islamic law."&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|reason=questionable statement as at least one of the other signers of the fatwa may have indeed been able to issue such an edict&amp;nbsp;– bin Laden and al-Zawahiri were co-signers|date=May 2009}}

Bruce Riedel, a former CIA analyst and National Security Council official for South Asia, said that Pakistan should be warned that it will be placed on the list of [[State Sponsors of Terrorism]], and wrote that "Zawahiri made the tape in his hideout in Pakistan, no doubt, and many Indians suspect the ISI ([[Inter-Services Intelligence|Inter Services Intelligence]]) is helping to protect him".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/al-qaeda-launches-india-wing-pakistan-army-isi-targeting-india-to-hit-nawaz-sharif_1465727.html|title=Al Qaeda launches India wing: `Pakistan Army, ISI targeting India to hit Nawaz Sharif'|work=Zee News|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/india/al-qaeda-wing-in-india-threatening-video-pakistan-isi-exposed-indian-ib-report-1515097.html|title=al-Qaeda's wing in India: Pakistan's ISI exposed over threatening video|work=news.oneindia.in|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.oneindia.in/feature/danger-from-isis-al-qaeda-what-india-should-do-1516217.html|title=Danger from ISIS and Al Qaeda: What India should do|work=news.oneindia.in|accessdate=October 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Al-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major terrorist attacks, four of them in its jihad against America. In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities.

Al-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks, and very rarely makes wire transfers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Eichenwald|first=Kurt|authorlink=Kurt Eichenwald|title=A Nation Challenged: The Money; Terror Money Hard to Block, Officials Find|work=The New York Times|date=December 10, 2001|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/10/world/a-nation-challenged-the-money-terror-money-hard-to-block-officials-find.html?scp=1&amp;sq=A+NATION+CHALLENGED%3A+THE+MONEY%3B+Terror+Money+Hard+to+Block%2C+Officials+Find&amp;st=cse&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=May 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992===
On December 29, 1992, al-Qaeda's launched its first terrorist attack. Two bombs were detonated in [[Aden]], Yemen. The first target was the Movenpick Hotel and the second was the parking lot of the Goldmohur Hotel.

The bombings were an attempt to eliminate American soldiers on their way to Somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort, [[Operation Restore Hope]]. Internally, al-Qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the Americans away, but in the US, the attack was barely noticed. No American soldiers were killed because no soldiers were staying in the hotel which was bombed. However, an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker were killed in the bombing. Seven others, mostly Yemenis, were severely injured.&lt;ref name="wright174"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wright|2006|p=174}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Two fatwas are said to have been appointed by al-Qaeda's members, [[Mamdouh Mahmud Salim]], to justify the killings according to Islamic law. Salim referred to a famous fatwa appointed by [[Ibn Taymiyyah]], a 13th-century scholar much admired by Wahhabis, which sanctioned resistance by any means during the Mongol invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jansen|1997}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2009}}

In 1996, bin Laden personally engineered a plot to assassinate United States President [[Bill Clinton]] while the president was in [[Manila]] for the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]]. However, intelligence agents intercepted a message before the motorcade was to leave, and alerted the [[U.S. Secret Service|US Secret Service]]. Agents later discovered a bomb planted under a bridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Osama bin Laden came within minutes of killing Bill Clinton |author=Tom Leonard|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=December 25, 2009|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/6867331/Osama-bin-Laden-came-within-minutes-of-killing-Bill-Clinton.html|accessdate=December 25, 2009|location=London|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225150252/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/6867331/Osama-bin-Laden-came-within-minutes-of-killing-Bill-Clinton.html|archivedate=December 25, 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 1998, al-Qaeda [[1998 U.S. embassy bombings|bombed the US embassies in East Africa]], killing 224 people, including 12 Americans. In retaliation, a barrage of [[cruise missile]]s launched by the US military devastated an al-Qaeda base in [[Khost]], Afghanistan. The network's capacity was unharmed. In late 1999 and 2000, Al-Qaeda planned [[2000 millennium attack plots|attacks to coincide with the millennium]], masterminded by [[Abu Zubaydah]] and involving [[Abu Qatada]], which would include the bombing of Christian holy sites in Jordan, the bombing of [[Los Angeles International Airport]] by [[Ahmed Ressam]], and the bombing of the {{USS|The Sullivans|DDG-68}}.

On October 12, 2000, al-Qaeda militants in Yemen [[USS Cole bombing|bombed]] the [[Guided missile destroyer|missile destroyer]] ''[[USS Cole (DDG-67)|USS Cole]]'' in a suicide attack, killing 17 US servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore. Inspired by the success of such a brazen attack, al-Qaeda's command core began to prepare for an attack on the US itself.

===September 11 attacks===

[[File:FEMA - 4235 - Photograph by Andrea Booher taken on 09-28-2001 in New York.jpg|thumb|upright|Aftermath of the September 11 attacks]]

The September 11 attacks were the most devastating terrorist acts in American history, killing 2,977 people, including 2,507 civilians, 343 firefighters, 72 law enforcement officers, and 55 military personnel. Two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, a third into the Pentagon, and a fourth, originally intended to target either the [[United States Capitol]] or the [[White House]], crashed in a field in Stonycreek Township near [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]]. It was also the deadliest foreign attack on American soil since the [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor]] on December 7, 1941.

The attacks were conducted by al-Qaeda, acting in accord with the [[Fatawā of Osama bin Laden#1998 Fatwa|1998 ''fatwa'']] issued against the US and its allies by persons under the command of bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/irp/world/para/docs/980223-fatwa.htm|title=Jihad Against Jews and Crusaders|accessdate=June 16, 2010|date=February 23, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence points to suicide squads led by al-Qaeda military commander [[Mohamed Atta]] as the culprits of the attacks, with bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], and [[Hambali]] as the key planners and part of the political and military command.

Messages issued by bin Laden after September 11, 2001, praised the attacks, and explained their motivation while denying any involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/|title=Bin Laden says he wasn't behind attacks|publisher=CNN|accessdate=July 6, 2006|date=September 17, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060705161654/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/16/inv.binladen.denial/|archivedate=July 5, 2006|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bin Laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and Islamist Muslims, such as the general perception that the US was actively oppressing Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Esposito|2002|p=22}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bin Laden asserted that America was massacring Muslims in "[[Palestinian National Authority|Palestine]], [[Chechnya]], [[Kashmir]] and Iraq" and that Muslims should retain the "right to attack in reprisal." He also claimed the 9/11 attacks were not targeted at people, but "America's icons of military and economic power," despite the fact he planned to attack in the morning when most of the people in the intended targets were present and thus generating the maximum number of human casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Hamid Miir 'Osama claims he has nukes: If U.S. uses N-arms it will get the same response' "Dawn: the Internet Edition" November 10, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence has since come to light that the original targets for the attack may have been nuclear power stations on the east coast of the US The targets were later altered by al-Qaeda, as it was feared that such an attack "might get out of hand".&lt;ref name="AL-QAIDA-LEADERS-SAY-NUCLEAR-POWER-STATIONS-WERE-ORIGINAL-TARGETS"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Al-Qaida leaders say nuclear power stations were original targets|url=https://www.theguardian.com/afghanistan/story/0,1284,788431,00.html|work=The Guardian|location=UK|date=September 9, 2002|accessdate=January 11, 2007 |first=Giles|last=Tremlett|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122160702/http://www.guardian.co.uk/afghanistan/story/0%2C1284%2C788431%2C00.html|archivedate=January 22, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Al-Qaeda-SCALED-BACK-10-PLANE-PLOT"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Al Qaeda Scaled Back 10-Plane Plot|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45853-2004Jun16_2.html|work=The Washington Post|date=June 17, 2004|accessdate=January 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==War on Terror==
{{Main|War on Terror|List of wars and battles involving al-Qaeda}}
[[File:US 10th Mountain Division soldiers in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|US troops in Afghanistan]]

In the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks, the US government [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|responded]], and began to prepare its [[Military of the United States|armed forces]] to overthrow the Taliban, which it believed was harboring al-Qaeda. The US offered Taliban leader [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]] a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were paramilitary officers from the CIA's elite [[Special Activities Division]] (SAD).

The [[Taliban]] offered to turn over bin Laden to a [[neutral country]] for trial if the US would provide evidence of bin Laden's complicity in the attacks. US President [[George W. Bush]] responded by saying: "We know he's guilty. Turn him over",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20011015-NEWS-310159983|title=US Jets Pound Targets Around Kabul|work=[[The Portsmouth Herald]]|date=October 15, 2001|accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] warned the Taliban regime: "Surrender bin Laden, or surrender power".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2001/10/02/blair_war011002.html|title=Blair to Taliban: Surrender bin Laden or surrender power|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=October 3, 2001|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon thereafter the US and its allies invaded Afghanistan, and together with the [[Northern Alliance|Afghan Northern Alliance]] removed the Taliban government as part of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]]. As a result of the US [[special forces]] and [[close air support|air support]] for the Northern Alliance ground forces, a number of Taliban and [[Derunta training camp|al-Qaeda training camps]] were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted. After being driven from their key positions in the [[Tora Bora]] area of Afghanistan, many al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged [[Gardez]] region of the nation.

By early 2002, al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared to be a success. Nevertheless, a significant [[Taliban insurgency]] remained in Afghanistan.

Debate continued regarding the nature of al-Qaeda's role in the 9/11 attacks. The [[United States State Department|US State Department]] released a [[Videos of Osama bin Laden#December 13, 2001|videotape]] showing bin Laden speaking with a small group of associates somewhere in Afghanistan shortly before the Taliban was removed from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2001/b12132001_bt630-01.html|title=U.S. Releases Videotape of Osama Bin Laden|accessdate=July 4, 2006|date=December 13, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625223529/http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/2001/b12132001_bt630-01.html|archivedate=June 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although its authenticity has been questioned by a couple of people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/september11/story/0,11209,619188,00.html|author=Morris, Steven|title=US urged to detail origin of tape|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=July 11, 2006|date=December 15, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the tape definitively implicates bin Laden and al-Qaeda in the September 11 attacks.

In September 2004, the [[9/11 Commission]] officially concluded that the attacks were conceived and implemented by al-Qaeda operatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/|title=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States|accessdate=April 27, 2006|date=September 20, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427220632/http://www.9-11commission.gov/|archivedate=April 27, 2006|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2004, bin Laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in a [[2004 Osama bin Laden video|videotape]] released through Al Jazeera, saying he was inspired by Israeli attacks on high-rises in the 1982 [[1982 Lebanon War|invasion of Lebanon]]: "As I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/79C6AF22-98FB-4A1C-B21F-2BC36E87F61F.htm|title=Full transcript of bin Ladin's speech|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=July 12, 2006|date=November 1, 2004|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060711055450/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/79C6AF22-98FB-4A1C-B21F-2BC36E87F61F.htm|archivedate=July 11, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 2004, the US government proclaimed that two-thirds of the most senior al-Qaeda figures from 2001 had been captured and interrogated by the CIA: [[Abu Zubaydah]], [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]] and [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]] in 2002;&lt;ref name="martinez interrogations"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shane|first=Scott|title=Inside the interrogation of a 9/11 mastermind|work=The New York Times|date=June 22, 2008|pages=A1, A12–A13|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/washington/22ksm.html|accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]] in 2003; and [[Saif al Islam el Masry]] in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} [[Mohammed Atef]] and several others were killed. &lt;!-- Despite this, the US government continues to warn that the organization is not yet defeated and battles between US forces and al-Qaeda-related groups continue.

By the end of 2008, the Taliban had severed any remaining ties with al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/10/06/afghan.saudi.talks/?iref=mpstoryview|title=Sources: Taliban split with al Qaeda, seek peace|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to senior US military intelligence officials, there are fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remaining in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/10/AR2009111019644.html|title=In Afghanistan, Taliban leaving al-Qaeda behind|first=Joshua|last=Partlow|date=November 11, 2009|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Al-Qaeda involvement in Africa]] has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa, while supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia. From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan.

Islamist rebels in the [[Sahara]] calling themselves [[al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] have stepped up their violence in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;

===Europe===
{{Main|Al-Qaeda involvement in Europe}}

Prior to the [[September 11 attacks]], [[Al Qaeda in Bosnia and Herzegovina|al-Qaeda]] was present in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and its members were mostly veterans of the [[Bosnian mujahideen|El Mudžahid]] detachment of the Bosnian Muslim [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Three al-Qaeda operatives carried out the [[Mostar car bombing]] in 1997. The operatives were closely linked to and financed by the [[Saudi High Commission for Relief of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] founded by then-prince King [[Salman of Saudi Arabia]].

Before the 9/11 attacks and the US invasion of Afghanistan, westerners who had been recruits at al-Qaeda training camps were sought after by al-Qaeda's military wing. Language skills and knowledge of Western culture were generally found among recruits from Europe, such was the case with [[Mohamed Atta]], an Egyptian national studying in Germany at the time of his training, and other members of the [[Hamburg Cell]]. [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Mohammed Atef]] would later designate Atta as the ringleader of the [[9/11 hijackers]]. Following the attacks, Western intelligence agencies determined that al-Qaeda cells operating in Europe had aided the hijackers with financing and communications with the central leadership based in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="9-11commission.gov"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2001/sep/30/terrorism.september113|title=Last words of a terrorist &amp;#124; The Observer|work=The Guardian|accessdate=November 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Islamists carried out a series of bombings in [[Istanbul]] killing fifty-seven people and injuring seven hundred. Seventy-four people were charged by the Turkish authorities. Some had previously met bin Laden, and though they specifically declined to pledge allegiance to al-Qaeda they asked for its blessing and help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=View all comments that have been posted about this article.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/12/AR2007021201715_pf.html|title=Washington Post&amp;nbsp;– Al-Qaeda's Hand in Istanbul Plot|work=The Washington Post |accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3735645/|title=Msn News&amp;nbsp;– Bin Laden allegedly planned attack in Turkey&amp;nbsp;– Stymied by tight security at U.S. bases, militants switched targets|publisher=MSNBC|date=December 17, 2003|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was convicted and sentenced to 12-and-a-half years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Whitlock|first=Craig|authorlink=Craig Whitlock|title=Briton Used Internet As His Bully Pulpit|work=The Washington Post|date=August 8, 2005|page=A1|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/07/AR2005080700890.html|accessdate=September 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Babar Ahmad Indicted on Terrorism Charges|publisher=United States Attorney's Office District of Connecticut|date=October 6, 2004|url=http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/Press2004/20041006.html|accessdate=May 29, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060526115318/http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/ct/Press2004/20041006.html|archivedate=May 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-28335976|title=British cyber-jihadist Babar Ahmad jailed in US|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=July 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Online communications====
In 2007, al-Qaeda released ''[[Mujahedeen Secrets]]'', encryption software used for online and cellular communications. A later version, ''[[Mujahideen Secrets 2]]'', was released in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nytimes.com/2013/09/30/us/qaeda-plot-leak-has-undermined-us-intelligence.html|work=The New York Times|first1=Eric|last1=Schmitt|first2=Michael S.|last2=Schmidt|title=Qaeda Plot Leak Has Undermined U.S. Intelligence|date=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aviation network===
Al-Qaeda is believed to be operating a clandestine aviation network including "several [[Boeing 727]] aircraft", [[turboprops]] and [[executive jet]]s, according to a 2010 [[Reuters]] story. Based on a US [[Department of Homeland Security]] report, the story said that al-Qaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from South America to various unstable countries in West Africa. A Boeing 727 can carry up to 10 tons of cargo. The drugs eventually are smuggled to Europe for distribution and sale, and the weapons are used in conflicts in Africa and possibly elsewhere. Gunmen with links to al-Qaeda have been increasingly [[kidnapping]] Europeans for ransom. The profits from the drug and weapon sales, and kidnappings can, in turn, fund more militant activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gaynor|first=Tim|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE60C3E820100113?type=politicsNews|title=Al Qaeda linked to rogue aviation network|agency=Reuters  |date=January 13, 2010|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alleged CIA involvement==
{{Main|Allegations of CIA assistance to Osama bin Laden}} Experts debate the notion al-Qaeda attacks were an indirect result from the American CIA's [[Operation Cyclone]] program to help the Afghan [[Islamic mujahid movement|mujahideen]]. [[Robin Cook]], British Foreign Secretary from 1997 to 2001, has written that al-Qaeda and bin Laden were "a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies", and that "Al-Qaida, literally 'the database', was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/terrorism/story/0,12780,1523838,00.html |title=The struggle against terrorism cannot be won by military means |author=Cook, Robin |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=July 8, 2005 |date=July 8, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050710025703/http://www.guardian.co.uk/terrorism/story/0%2C12780%2C1523838%2C00.html |archivedate=July 10, 2005 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Munir Akram]], [[Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations]] from 2002 to 2008, wrote in a letter published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on January 19, 2008:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The strategy to support the Afghans against Soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies, including the C.I.A. and Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. After the Soviet withdrawal, the Western powers walked away from the region, leaving behind 40,000 militants imported from several countries to wage the anti-Soviet jihad. Pakistan was left to face the blowback of extremism, drugs and guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/19/opinion/lweb22pakistan.html?_r=1&amp;ref=opinion|accessdate=October 17, 2009|title=Pakistan, Terrorism and Drugs|department=Opinion|work=The New York Times|first=Munir|last=Akram|date=January 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A variety of sources, including [[CNN]] journalist [[Peter Bergen]], [[Inter-Services Intelligence|Pakistani ISI]] Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, and CIA operatives involved in the Afghan program, such as [[Vincent Cannistraro]], deny that the CIA or other American officials had contact with the foreign mujahideen or bin Laden, let alone armed, trained, coached or indoctrinated them.

Bergen and others argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language, customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Coll|2005|pp=145–46, 155–56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergen further argues that foreign mujahideen had no need for American funds since they received several million dollars per year from internal sources. Lastly, he argues that Americans could not have trained the mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan, and that the Afghan Arabs were almost invariably militant Islamists reflexively hostile to Westerners whether or not the Westerners were helping the Muslim Afghans.

According to Bergen, who conducted the first television interview with bin Laden in 1997: the idea that "the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden... [is] a folk myth. There's no evidence of this... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently... The real story here is the CIA didn't really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/bergen.answers/index.html|title=Bergen: Bin Laden, CIA links hogwash|author=Bergen, Peter|publisher=CNN|accessdate=August 15, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821221916/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/asiapcf/08/15/bergen.answers/index.html|archivedate=August 21, 2006|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jason Burke also wrote:{{quote|Some of the $500 million the CIA poured into Afghanistan reached [Al-Zawahiri's] group. Al-Zawahiri has become a close aide of bin Laden...

==Broader influence==
[[Anders Behring Breivik]], the perpetrator of the [[2011 Norway attacks]], was inspired by Al-Qaeda, calling it "the most successful revolutionary movement in the world." While admitting different aims, he sought to "create a European version of Al-Qaida."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2112701,00.html |title=Breivik Studied al-Qaeda Attacks |newspaper=Time |date=April 20, 2012 |accessdate=May 8, 2012 |last=Ritter |first=Karl |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525123005/http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0%2C8599%2C2112701%2C00.html |archivedate=May 25, 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/21/world/europe/norway-anders-breivik-studied-al-qaeda.html|title=Norway: Militant Studied Al Qaeda|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 20, 2012|accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{main|Khawarij}}

[[Islamic extremism]] dates back to the [[Kharijites]] of the 7th century. From their essentially political position, the Kharijites developed extreme doctrines that set them apart from both mainstream Sunni and Shiʿa Muslims. The Kharijites were particularly noted for adopting a radical approach to [[Takfir]], whereby they declared other Muslims to be unbelievers and therefore deemed them worthy of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/another-battle-with-islams-true-believers/article20802390/|title=Another battle with Islam's 'true believers'|work=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=November 17, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802045255/http://www.quilliamfoundation.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/publications/free/the-balance-of-islam-in-challenging-extremism.pdf |archivedate=August 2, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawacitizen.com/news/national/fruits-of-the-tree-of-extremism|title=Imam Mohamad Jebara: Fruits of the tree of extremism|author=Mohamad Jebara More Mohamad Jebara|work=Ottawa Citizen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a number of sources, a "wave of revulsion" has been expressed against al-Qaeda and its affiliates by "religious scholars, former fighters and militants" who are alarmed by al-Qaeda's takfir and its killing of Muslims in Muslim countries, especially in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergen|Cruickshank|2008}}; {{Harvnb|Wright|2008}}. Quotes taken from {{Harvnb|Riedel|2008|pp=106–07}} and {{Harvnb|Bergen|Cruickshank|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Noman Benotman]], a former Afghan Arab and a militant member of the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]] (LIFG), went public with an open letter of criticism to Ayman al-Zawahiri in November 2007, after persuading the imprisoned senior leaders of his former group to enter into peace negotiations with the Libyan regime. While Ayman al-Zawahiri announced the affiliation of the group with al-Qaeda in November 2007, the Libyan government released 90 members of the group from prison several months after "they were said to have renounced violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/AA64F530-BCA8-40B0-8226-22154CCD1032.htm|title=Libya releases scores of prisoners |publisher=English.aljazeera.net|date=April 9, 2008|accessdate=March 22, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080718232829/http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/AA64F530-BCA8-40B0-8226-22154CCD1032.htm |archivedate=July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, on the anniversary of the September 11 attacks,&lt;ref name="RebellionWright"/&gt; the Saudi sheikh [[Salman al-Ouda]] delivered a personal rebuke to bin Laden. Al-Ouda, a religious scholar and one of the fathers of the Sahwa, the fundamentalist awakening movement that swept through Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, is a widely respected critic of jihadism.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Al-Ouda addressed al-Qaeda's leader on television asking him:
&lt;blockquote&gt;My brother Osama, how much blood has been spilt? How many innocent people, children, elderly, and women have been killed... in the name of al-Qaeda? Will you be happy to meet God Almighty carrying the burden of these hundreds of thousands or millions [of victims] on your back?&lt;ref name=theunraveling&gt;{{Harvnb|Bergen|Cruickshank|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Pew polls, support for al-Qaeda had dropped in the Muslim world in the years before 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2008/05/taking_stock_in_the_war_on_ter.html|title=Taking Stock of the War on Terror|publisher=Realclearpolitics.com|date=May 22, 2008|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support of suicide bombings in Indonesia, Lebanon, and Bangladesh, dropped by half or more in the last five years.{{when|date=August 2018|need a specific year, "last" becomes outdated.}} In Saudi Arabia, only 10&amp;nbsp;percent had a favorable view of al-Qaeda, according to a December&amp;nbsp;2017 poll by Terror Free Tomorrow, a Washington-based [[think tank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/12/17/saudi.poll/index.html|title=December 18, 2007 Poll: Most Saudis oppose al Qaeda|publisher=CNN |date=December 18, 2007|accessdate=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the imprisoned [[Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif]], an influential Afghan Arab, "ideological godfather of al-Qaeda", and former supporter of takfir, withdrew his support from al-Qaeda with a book ''[[Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif#Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World|Wathiqat Tarshid Al-'Aml Al-Jihadi fi Misr w'Al-'Alam]]'' ({{lang-en|Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World}}).

Although once associated with al-Qaeda, in September 2009 [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group|LIFG]] completed a new "code" for jihad, a 417-page religious document entitled "Corrective Studies". Given its credibility and the fact that several other prominent Jihadists in the Middle East have turned against al-Qaeda, the LIFG's reversal may be an important step toward staunching al-Qaeda's recruitment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/11/09/libya.jihadi.code/ "New jihad code threatens al Qaeda"], Nic Robertson and Paul Cruickshank, [[CNN]], November 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other criticisms===
Bilal Abdul Kareem, an American journalist based in Syria created a documentary about [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabab]], al-Qaeda's affiliate in Somalia. The documentary included interviews with former members of the group who stated their reasons for leaving al-Shabab. The members made accusations of segregation, lack of religious awareness and internal corruption and favoritism. In response to Kareem, the [[Global Islamic Media Front]] condemned Kareem, called him a liar, and denied the accusations from the former fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jihadology.net/2017/06/06/new-release-from-the-global-islamic-media-front-lies-in-disguise-a-response-from-the-deep-heart-of-a-mujahid-of-the-lions-of-islam-in-somalia/|title=New release from the Global Islamic Media Front: "Lies in Disguise: A Response From the Deep Heart of a Mujāhid of the Lions of Islām in Somalia"|date=June 6, 2017|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2014 after the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] declared that they had restored the [[Caliphate]], an audio statement was released by the then-spokesman of the group [[Abu Muhammad al-Adnani]] claiming that "the legality of all emirates, groups, states, and organizations, becomes null by the expansion of the Caliphate's authority". The speech included a religious refutation of Al-Qaeda for being too lenient regarding [[Shiites]] and their refusal to recognize the authority [[Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]], al-Adnani specifically noting: "It is not suitable for a state to give allegiance to an organization". He also recalled a past instance in which [[Osama bin Laden]] called on al-Qaeda members and supporters to give allegiance to [[Abu Omar al-Baghdadi]] when the group was still solely operating in Iraq, as the [[Islamic State of Iraq]], and condemned [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] for not making this same claim for Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and that Zawahiri was encouraging factionalism and division between former allies of ISIL such as the [[al-Nusra Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.siteintelgroup.com/Jihadist-News/isis-spokesman-declares-caliphate-rebrands-group-as-islamic-state.html|title=ISIS Spokesman Declares Caliphate, Rebrands Group as "Islamic State"|first=|last=SITE|website=news.siteintelgroup.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jihadology.net/2014/06/29/al-furqan-media-presents-a-new-audio-message-from-the-islamic-states-shaykh-abu-mu%E1%B8%A5ammad-al-adnani-al-shami-this-is-the-promise-of-god/|title=al-Furqān Media presents a new audio message from the Islamic State's Shaykh Abū Muḥammad al 'Adnānī al-Shāmī: "This Is the Promise Of God"|date=June 29, 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in February 2017, it has been reported that more than 100 male residents of the [[Chechen Republic]], a part of the [[Russian Federation]], have been [[Forced disappearance|forcibly disappeared]], being abducted, held prisoner and tortured by authorities targeting them based on their perceived [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name="uawire.org"/&gt; An unknown number of the men, whom authorities detained on suspicion of being gay or bisexual, have reportedly died after being held in what [[human rights]] groups and eyewitnesses have called [[concentration camp]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Lydia |title=Chechnya detains 100 gay men in first concentration camps since the Holocaust |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/chechnya-detains-100-gay-men-first-concentration-camps-since-holocaust-1616363|accessdate=16 April 2017 |work=International Business Times UK |date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Advocate"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Reynolds |first1=Daniel |title=Report: Chechnya Is Torturing Gay Men in Concentration Camps |url=http://www.advocate.com/world/2017/4/10/report-chechyna-torturing-gay-men-concentration-camps |accessdate=16 April 2017 |work=The Advocate |date=10 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As news spread of Chechen authorities' actions, which have been described as part of a systematic anti-[[LGBT]] [[purge]], Russian and international activists scrambled to evacuate survivors of the camps and other vulnerable Chechens but met with difficulty obtaining visas to conduct them safely beyond Russia.&lt;ref name="bbc_ponniah"&gt;{{cite web |title=Chechen gay men hopeful of finding refuge in five countries |author= Ponniah, Kevin |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39974512 |work=BBC News |date=19 May 2017 |accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reports of the persecution met with a variety of reactions worldwide. The [[Head of the Chechen Republic]] [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] denied not only the occurrence of any persecution but also the existence of gay men in Chechnya, adding that such people would be killed by their own families.&lt;ref name="Walker2April"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chechen police 'kidnap and torture gay men' - LGBT activists  |work=BBC News |author=Peter, Laurence |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-39566136 |date=11 April 2017 |accessdate=31 May 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials in Moscow were sceptical, although in late May the Russian government reportedly agreed to send an investigative team to Chechnya.&lt;ref name="guardian_walker26may"&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia investigates 'gay purge' in Chechnya |author=Walker, Shaun |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/may/26/russia-investigates-gay-purge-in-chechnya |newspaper=The Guardian |date=26 May 2017 |accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous national leaders and other public figures in [[Western world|the West]] condemned Chechnya's actions, and protests were held in Russia and elsewhere.

==Background==
The status of [[LGBT rights in Chechnya|LGBT rights in the Chechen Republic]] has long been a concern among human rights organizations (including Amnesty International) and it has been described as "especially bleak" within the context of the [[Russian Federation]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="Savelau16April"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Savelau|first1=Dmitry|title=Gay men in Chechnya are some of the most disempowered people in the world today|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/chechnya-russian-media-gay-rights-international-support-lgbt-long-way-to-go-a7681041.html|accessdate=16 April 2017|work=The Independent|date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also singled out for criticism by human rights organisations such as [[Amnesty International]] before the 2017 crackdown.&lt;ref name="AmnestyRep1997"&gt;{{cite book|title=Breaking the Silence: Human Rights Violations Based on Sexual Orientation|publisher=Amnesty International|year=1997|page=34|isbn=1873328125}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chechnya is a predominantly [[Muslim]], ultra-[[conservative]] society in which [[homophobia]] is widespread and [[homosexuality]] is [[taboo]], and where having a gay relative is seen as a "stain on the entire extended family".&lt;ref name="WalkerApril2017"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walker|first1=Shaun|title=Chechens tell of prison beatings and electric shocks in anti-gay purge: 'They called us animals'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/13/they-called-us-animals-chechens-prison-beatings-electric-shocks-anti-gay-purge|accessdate=16 April 2017|work=The Guardian|date=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal [[LGBT rights in Russia|Russian LGBT laws]] apply in Chechnya, which is a part of the [[Russian Federation]]. However, in Chechnya, as in other regions of southern Russia, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] "has empowered local leaders to enforce their interpretation of traditional values, partly in an effort to co-opt religious [[Islamic extremism|extremism]], which has largely been driven underground".&lt;ref name="ChanNYTApril2017"&gt;{{cite news      | last = Chan   | first = Sewell   | title = U.N.

Although homosexuality was legalized in Russia in 1993,&lt;ref name=RUS33940&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia: Update to RUS13194 of 16 February 1993 on the treatment of homosexuals|publisher=Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada|date=29 February 2000|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/3ae6ad788c.html|accessdate=21 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1996 Chechnya's separatist president [[Aslan Maskhadov]] adopted [[sharia law]] in his [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]], and article 148 of the Chechen penal code made all "[[sodomy]]" punishable by [[caning]] after the first two offences and punishable by execution after the third offence,&lt;ref name="AmnestyRep1997" /&gt; although the [[Capital punishment in Russia|death penalty in Chechnya]] has not been carried out since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bright|first1=Arthur|title=India uses death penalty: 5 other places where it's legal but rare|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2012/0829/India-uses-death-penalty-5-other-places-where-it-s-legal-but-rare/Russia|accessdate=16 April 2017|work=Christian Science Monitor|date=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chechnya returned to direct Russian rule in 2000, formally complying with its federal laws and human right statutes.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} De facto, it retains some autonomy, and the current [[Head of the Chechen Republic]], Ramzan Kadyrov, "has brought Islam to the fore of Chechnya's daily life, and gay people who reveal their sexuality are often discriminated against and shunned by their families".&lt;ref name="theindependentosborne"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osborne|first1=Samuel|title=Gay men being tortured and murdered in Chechen prisons, claim detainees|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/gay-men-chechnya-prisons-detain-torture-murdered-killed-detain-russia-region-a7669911.html|accessdate=April 10, 2017|work=The Independent|date=April 7, 2017|quote=He has brought Islam to the fore of Chechnya's daily life, and gay people who reveal their sexuality are often discriminated against and shunned by their families.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A spokesperson for Russian President Vladimir Putin endorsed Chechen leaders' claims that anti-gay persecution is not occurring in the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |title=Russia backs Chechnya government's denials over killing and torture of gay men

==Large-scale raids and killings==
The detentions began in February 2017 after a Chechen man who had allegedly committed a drug-related offense was stopped by police&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Putin's Monster  |author=Knight, Amy |url=http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/05/19/putins-monster-ramzan-kadyrov/ |work=The New York Review of Books |date=19 May 2017 |accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report reveals the full brutality of anti-gay purges in Chechnya  |author= Andreevskikh , Olga |url=http://theconversation.com/report-reveals-the-full-brutality-of-anti-gay-purges-in-chechnya-78373 |work=The Conversation |date=30 May 2017 |accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and arresting officers  discovered contact information for other gay men on his phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=This New Report Shows How Bad Chechnya's Gay Crackdown Really Is |author= Armitage, Susie |url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/susiearmitage/this-new-report-shows-how-bad-chechnyas-gay-crackdown |work=BuzzFeed News |date=26 May 2017 |accessdate=31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second wave of detentions began after the LGBT rights organization [[Gayrussia.ru]] applied for permits to hold [[gay pride parade]]s in four cities within [[Kabardino-Balkaria]] in Russia's predominantly Muslim [[North Caucasus]] region, although not within Chechnya itself. The application in this district was denied by the Kabardino-Balkar authorities. An anti-gay demonstration followed, along with posts on social media calling for gay people to be murdered by various methods.&lt;ref name="KramerNYT" /&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] reported in 2017 that "it is difficult to overstate just how vulnerable LGBT people are in Chechnya, where homophobia is intense and rampant. LGBT people are in danger not only of persecution by the authorities but also of falling victim to '[[honour killings]]' by their own relatives for tarnishing family honor."&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Lokshina, [https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/04/anti-lgbt-violence-chechnya Anti-LGBT Violence in Chechnya] [[Human Rights Watch]] (April 4, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Kadyrov has encouraged [[extrajudicial killing]]s by family members as an alternative to law enforcement – in some cases, gay men in prison have been released early specifically to enable their murder by relatives.&lt;ref name="IBTimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/deadly-anti-lgbt-crisis-unfolding-chechnya-1616551|title='People are being tortured and killed': Chechnya's deadly anti-LGBT crisis|first=Lydia|last=Smith|date=11 April 2017|accessdate=12 April 2017|website=International Business News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Chechnya)|Chechen police]] and military have conducted [[entrapment]] schemes, in which a victim is lured on a [[Dating|date]], beaten and humiliated. A recording is produced, and blackmail money is solicited in return for silence. Law enforcement agencies in Chechnya already keep lists of "suspects".&lt;ref name="uawire.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://uawire.org/news/homosexual-men-from-Chechnya-confirm-existence-of-special-prisons-in-the-republic|title=Information uncovered about a second prison for homosexuals in the Russian republic of Chechnya|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a source from Radio Liberty, raids on gays began in December 2016, subsided briefly, and resumed on a large scale in February 2017. The first gay men who were detained via entrapment were tortured in attempts to reveal the names of their acquaintances.

All of the correspondence in their phones was checked, adding to the "suspect" list. This resulted in the number of victims growing exponentially. According to ''Novaya Gazeta'', at the end of February, the police detained and checked the phone of a person who was in a state of intoxication. The phone had "pictures and videos with explicit content" and "dozens of contacts of local homosexuals". The detainee was sent to a "secret prison".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Расправы над чеченскими геями (18+)|url=https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2017/04/04/72027-raspravy-nad-chechenskimi-geyami-publikuem-svidetelstva|accessdate=18 December 2017|work=Новая газета|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, a "wave of persecution" began in Chechnya as an attempt to purge the country of those who are homosexual or are perceived to be homosexual.&lt;ref name="uawire.org" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/world/gay-men-sent-to-concentrationstyle-camps-during-purge-in-chechnya-a3512611.html|title=Gay men 'sent to concentration-style camps during purge in Chechnya'|date=11 April 2017|publisher= The Evening Standard |accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/chechen-authorities-rounding-killing-gay-men-prophylactic-purge/story?id=46541508|title=Authorities rounding up, killing gay men in 'prophylactic purge,' Russian paper says|first= |last= |date=4 April 2017|publisher= ABC News |accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chechen police are reportedly pressuring parents in the region to kill their children who they suspect of being homosexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pasha-Robinson|first1=Lucy|title=Chechen authorities tell parents: 'Kill your gay sons or we will', survivor claims|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/chechnya-parents-kill-gay-sons-russia-region-government-chechen-leader-ramzan-kadyrov-a7714591.html|accessdate=3 May 2017|work=[[The Independent]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="attitudestroudewill"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stroude|first1=Will|title=CHECHEN AUTHORITIES 'SUMMON PARENTS TO PRISON CAMPS TO KILL THEIR GAY SONS'|url=http://attitude.co.uk/chechen-authorities-summoning-parents-to-prison-camps-to-kill-their-gay-sons/|accessdate=May 3, 2017|work=Attitude|date=May 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate this, police have reportedly been releasing detainees into the custody of their families and [[outing]] them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=French president calls on Putin to protect gay Chechens |author= Burrows, Emma |url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/05/29/europe/macron-putin-russia |work=CNN |date=29 May 2017 |accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisonment and torture==

According to independent media and human rights groups, gay men are sent to clandestine camps in [[Chechnya]], which one eyewitness described to ''Novaya Gazeta'' as a "closed prison, the existence of which no one officially knows".&lt;ref name="Advocate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="novayagazeta.ru"&gt;https://www.novayagazeta.ru/articles/2017/04/04/72027-raspravy-nad-chechenskimi-geyami-publikuem-svidetelstva&lt;/ref&gt; Around 100 men have been imprisoned and at least three people have already died. Some of the guards in these allegedly unofficial jails are accused of releasing the prisoners to their relatives if their relatives promise to kill them (at least one man was reported by a witness as having died after returning to his family).&lt;ref name="novayagazeta.ru"/&gt; One location of a secret prison is allegedly in the southern city of [[Argun, Chechen Republic|Argun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-4411232/Chechen-man-reveals-anti-gay-abuse.html|title=Chechen families encouraged to MURDER gay relatives|publisher=|accessdate=16 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another prison is located in [[Tsotsin-Yurt]], south of the [[Chechnya|Chechen]] capital [[Grozny]].&lt;ref name="uawire.org"/&gt;

According to escapees interviewed in the Russian newspaper ''Novaya Gazeta'' and the British-owned ''[[The Guardian]]'', 30 to 40 people are detained in one room (two to three metres big), and often kept for months on end without trial. Witnesses report they are also beaten (with polypropylene pipes below the waist), and [[torture]]d with electricity. In addition to physical torture, individuals report being mocked, humiliated and insulted, as well as being forced to clean the prison and spat in the face.&lt;ref name="WalkerApril2017" /&gt;&lt;ref name="novayagazeta.ru"/&gt; In some cases the process of torture ends in the death of the person being tortured.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/chechnya-gay-men-concentration-camps-torture-detain-nazi-ramzan-kadyrov-chechen-russia-region-a7677901.html|title=People are being beaten and forced to 'sit on bottles' in anti-gay 'camps' in Chechnya|date=2017-04-11|work=The Independent|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/04/10/chechnya-has-opened-concentration-camps-for-gay-men/|title=Chechnya has opened concentration camps for gay men|work=PinkNews|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2017, it was reported that the building in Argun had been buried under demolition rubble and that prisoners had been moved to a new, unknown location. Investigators say that prisoners are likely to have been moved to a Special Police Force training base in Terek, about {{convert|60|km}} 60 in Argun, but they have been denied entry, because 'training is taking place'.&lt;ref name =gaystar23may&gt;{{cite news     | last = Morgan  | first = Joe  | title = Chechnya gay concentration camp destroyed, prisoners moved to unknown location  | publisher = Gay Start News  | date = May 23, 2017  | url = http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/chechnya-gay-concentration-camp-destroyed-prisoners-moved-unknown-location/  | accessdate = 31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =pinknews25may&gt;{{cite news      | last = Butterworth   | first = Benjamin   | title = Chechnya's gay concentration camp has been destroyed and moved to new location   | publisher =  Pink News   | date = May 25, 2017   | url = http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2017/05/25/chechnyas-gay-concentration-camp-has-been-destroyed-and-moved-to-new-location/   | accessdate = 31 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Confirmation===

Human Rights Watch has confirmed that authorities have "rounded up dozens of men on suspicion of being gay and that they are currently torturing and humiliating the victims. Some of the men have [[Forced disappearance|forcibly disappeared]]. At least three men have died since this brutal campaign began."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lokshina |first=Tanya |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2017/04/04/anti-lgbt-violence-chechnya |title=Anti-LGBT Violence in Chechnya |date=4 April 2017 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An investigation by Radio Svoboda ([[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]) claimed that prisoners are being released to their families if their families promise to murder them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://uawire.org/news/homosexual-men-from-Chechnya-confirm-existence-of-special-prisons-in-the-republic "Information uncovered about a second prison for homosexuals in the Russian republic of Chechnya"].&lt;/ref&gt;

A 7 April 2017 press statement by the United States Department of State expressed concern "about the situation in the Republic of Chechnya, where there have been numerous credible reports indicating the detention".&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite press release   | title = The United States Concerned by Reports of Detentions and Deaths of LGBTI Individuals in Chechnya, Russia   | publisher = The United States Department of State   | date = April 7, 2017   | url = https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2017/04/269628.htm   | accessdate =16 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lengthy analysis published on 26 May by Human Rights Watch reported the presence of leading government officials at the camps while detainees were being tortured.&lt;ref name="longarms"&gt;{{cite web |title="They Have Long Arms and They Can Find Me": Anti-Gay Purge by Local Authorities in Russia's Chechen Republic |url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2017/05/26/they-have-long-arms-and-they-can-find-me/anti-gay-purge-local-authorities-russias |work=Human Rights Watch |date=26 May 2017 |accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report, which includes graphic descriptions of the ordeals faced by several survivors of the camps, suggested that several victims of the camps were still being detained at the time of its publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Chechnya gay purge: Victims tell of being stripped naked, beaten with pipes and electrocuted |author=Batchelor, Tom |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/chechnya-anti-gay-purge-victims-stripped-naked-beaten-electrocuted-torture-detain-human-rights-watch-a7757786.html |newspaper=The Independent |date=26 May 2017 |accessdate=27 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, a journalist with [[VICE News]] visited a now-abandoned detention center in Argun believed to be the site of one of the camps, and interviewed the local minister of internal affairs, who also acts as prison warden. The warden denied that abuse had taken place, and said, "My officers would not even want to touch such people, if they exist, let alone beating or torturing them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vice Explores Chechen Prison, But Officials Still Deny Antigay Persecution |author= Ring, Trudy |url=https://www.advocate.com/world/2017/6/21/vice-explores-chechen-prison-officials-still-deny-antigay-persecution |work=The Advocate |date=21 June 2017 |accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shown footage of the detention center, a man who described being electrocuted by his captors identified  it as the site where he was held, and also identified the warden as one of his tormentors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inside the Chechen prison where gay men say they were tortured |author= Hassan, Hind |url=https://news.vice.com/story/chechnya-prison-gay-men-tortured |work=VICE News |date=20 June 2017 |accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"We don't have any gays," he said. "If there are any, take them to Canada. To purify our blood, if there are any here, take them."

On 13 April 2017, a panel of five experts that advises the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] called on Chechnya to "put an end to the persecution of people perceived to be gay or bisexual in the Chechen Republic who are living in a climate of fear fueled by homophobic speeches by local authorities".&lt;ref name="ChanNYTApril2017" /&gt; Also on 13 April, the director of the human rights office at the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] said that Moscow must "urgently investigate the alleged disappearance, torture and other ill-treatment" of gay men in Chechnya.&lt;ref name="Nordwall16April"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nordwall|first1=Smita|title=Russia Urged to End Torture, Killing of Gays in Chechnya|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-urged-end-torture-killing-gays-chechnya/3809377.html|accessdate=16 April 2017|work=VOA|date=13 April 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lilianne Ploumen]], [[Minister for Development Cooperation (Netherlands)|Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation]], has called for a statement of condemnation from the 32 members ([[Argentina]], [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[Costa Rica]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Ecuador]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Honduras]], [[Italy]], [[Mexico]], [[Montenegro]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Norway]], [[Portugal]], [[Serbia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Ukraine]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], and [[Uruguay]]) of the Equal Rights Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web     | last =    | first =    | title = Dutch aid minister calls for action over Chechnya anti-gay violence   | publisher = DutchNews.nl   | date =  April 18, 2017   | url = http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2017/04/dutch-aid-minister-calls-for-action-over-chechnya-anti-gay-violence/   | accessdate = 20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement released on 15 April, the Government of Canada called the "persecution of LGBTQ2 people in Chechnya reprehensible", calling upon Russia to investigate and ensure the safety of those at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release  | title = Canada calls persecution of LGBTQ2 people in Chechnya reprehensible   | publisher =  Government of Canada  | date =  April 15, 2017  | url = https://www.canada.ca/en/global-affairs/news/2017/04/canada_calls_persecutionoflgbtq2peopleinchechnyareprehensible.html   | accessdate = 19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a spokesperson for the [[United States National Security Council]], the topic of anti-gay persecution did not arise at a May 10 meeting between U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] and Lavrov. A White House spokesperson said that she was "not 100 percent sure" whether Trump had been briefed on the issue. As of May 10, neither Trump nor U.S. Secretary of State [[Rex Tillerson]] had made any public comment on the matter.&lt;ref name="blade"&gt;{{ cite news|title=White House 'not aware' if Trump briefed on Chechnya anti-gay abuses |author=Johnson, Chris|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/05/10/white-house-not-aware-trump-briefed-chechnya-anti-gay-abuses/|newspaper=The Washington Blade |date=10 May 2017|accessdate=11 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testifying before members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] on June 14, Tillerson reported that he had not discussed the matter during a meeting with Lavrov and did not know if Trump had raised it with Putin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tillerson: I haven't raised Chechnya anti-gay abuses with Russia |author= Johnson, Chris |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/06/15/tillerson-i-havent-raised-with-russia-anti-gay-abuses-in-chechnya/ |work=The Washington Blade |date=15 June 2017 |accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A spokesperson for the Russian Embassy in [[Israel]] blamed reports of anti-gay persecution in Chechnya on a "propaganda campaign against Russia". In a May 11 letter published in the newspaper ''[[Haaretz]]'', press attaché Dmitry Alushkin asserted that "authorized official government bodies of the Russian Federation" had conducted an investigation and that "[there] are no victims of persecution, threats or violence". He criticized Israeli citizens for spreading "factually incorrect information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/letters/1.788394|title=Haaretz Reported on Abuse of Gay Men in Chechnya.

In a meeting with Putin on 29 May, French president [[Emmanuel Macron]] pressed the Russian leader on the plight of LGBT Chechens and promised constant vigilance on the issue. According to Macron, Putin reported having taken steps to ascertain "the complete truth on the activities of local authorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=French president calls on Putin to protect gay Chechens |last1= Rubin |first1= Alissa J. |last2= Breeden |first2= Aurelien |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/world/europe/emmanuel-macron-putin-france-russia.html |work=The New York Times |date=29 May 2017 |accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 20, 2017, the [[United States Treasury Department]] announced it was imposing sanctions on Kadyrov and a Chechen law enforcement official, Ayub Katayev, citing "gross violations of internationally recognized human rights". The measures, applied under the [[Magnitsky Act]], restrict travel and freeze assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. Sanctions Chechen Leader Over Antigay Persecution |author= Ring, Trudy |url=https://www.advocate.com/world/2017/12/20/us-sanctions-chechen-leader-over-antigay-persecution |work=The Advocate |date=20 December 2017 |accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for Russian president Putin called the sanctions "illegal" and indicated that Moscow would enact similar restrictions on U.S. officials in response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kremlin Says Sanctions Against Kadyrov 'Illegal,' Vows Response |author= Ring, Trudy |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-chechnya-kremlin-says-us-kadyrov-sanctions-illegal-vows-response/28930921.html |work=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=21 December 2017 |accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 20, 2018, the [[United States Department of State]] released the [[Country Reports on Human Rights Practices]] of 2017. The report on Russia said the following about the situation of LGBTI people in Chechnya from December 2016 to December 2017.&lt;ref name="RUSSIA 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT"&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/277455.pdf RUSSIA 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT ]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''EXECUTIVE SUMMARY'''&lt;br /&gt;The most significant human rights issues included extrajudicial killings, including of LGBTI persons in Chechnya; enforced disappearances; torture that was systematic and sometimes resulted in death and sometimes included punitive psychiatric incarceration; harsh and life-threatening conditions in prisons; arbitrary arrest and detention; lack of judicial independence; political prisoners; severe interference with privacy; severe restrictions on freedom of expression and the media, including the use of “antiextremism” and other vague laws to prosecute peaceful dissent; and violence against journalists and bloggers; blocking and filtering of internet content and use of cyberattacks to disrupt peaceful internet discussion; severe restrictions on the rights of peaceful assembly; increasingly severe restriction on freedom of association, including laws on “foreign agents” and “undesirable foreign organization”; restrictions on freedom of movement of those charged with political offenses; refoulement; severe restriction on the right to participate in the political process, including restrictions on opposition candidates’ ability to seek public office and conduct political campaigns, and on the ability of civil society to monitor election processes; widespread corruption at all levels and in all branches of government; thousands of fatal incidents of domestic violence to which the government responded by reducing the penalty for domestic violence, and honor killings and other harmful traditional practices against women in parts of the North Caucasus; thousands of fatal incidents of child abuse; trafficking in persons; institutionalization in harsh conditions of a large percentage of persons with disabilities; and state-sponsored as well as societal violence against LGBTI persons, especially in Chechnya.&lt;ref name="RUSSIA 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''a. Arbitrary Deprivation of Life and Other Unlawful or Politically Motivated Killings'''&lt;br /&gt;On April 1, the independent newspaper ''Novaya Gazeta'' reported that, during an “antigay purge” that took place from December 2016 through March, local Chechen security services kidnapped, held prisoner, and tortured more than 100 male residents in Chechnya based on their suspected sexual orientation, resulting in at least three deaths. Multiple independent human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch, the Russia LGBT Network, and Memorial, subsequently confirmed ''Novaya Gazeta''’s allegations. On April 19, following international condemnation, the government authorized a “preinvestigative check” of the allegations by the Investigative Committee. Chechen officials denied the killings had taken place, while simultaneously making statements that condoned extrajudicial killings of LGBTI persons. In May Human Rights Ombudswoman Tatyana Moskalkova also began an investigation and requested the Investigative Committee to look into the fate of individual alleged victims, based on information provided to her by nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). On July 6, she received an interim response from the Investigative Committee that did not confirm any violence against the LGBTI community in Chechnya, citing a lack of specific information on the victims. She publicly noted her dissatisfaction with the response and traveled to Chechnya in September. According to ''Novaya Gazeta'' and credible NGO reports, during her visit to Chechnya, local authorities misled her and attempted to cover up the killings. On October 16, a surviving victim of the “antigay purge,” Maksim Lapunov, filed a complaint with the Investigative Committee in which he alleged torture and provided information about extrajudicial killings. On November 1, Moskalkova stated she would ensure that Lapunov’s allegations were properly investigated, stating, “I believe there are grounds to open a criminal case and provide state protection to Maxim Lapunov.” On December 27, ''Novaya Gazeta'' published a report that included interviews with 12 victims of the purge, describing in detail their arrests, imprisonment, and torture at the hands of authorities. According to ''Novaya Gazeta'', by the end of the year, the Russia LGBT Network had evacuated 106 persons from Chechnya, all of whom left Russia.&lt;ref name="RUSSIA 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''g. Abuses in Internal Conflict'''&lt;br /&gt;On April 1, ''Novaya Gazeta'' reported that Chechen security services kidnapped, secretly held prisoner, and tortured more than 100 male residents in Chechnya based on their suspected sexual orientation, resulting in at least three deaths (see section 1.a.).&lt;ref name="RUSSIA 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''a. Freedom of Expression, Including for the Press'''&lt;br /&gt;Journalists reporting on the North Caucasus remained particularly vulnerable to physical attacks or prosecution for their reporting. Following their exposé of the large-scale violations of human rights against gay men in Chechnya, Chechen officials made threats against the independent newspaper ''Novaya Gazeta'', which first broke the story. At an April 3 gathering of some 15,000 men at a mosque, Chechen presidential adviser Adam Shahidov called ''Novaya Gazeta'' journalists “enemies of our faith and our motherland” and threatened “vengeance.” A resolution adopted at the gathering included a promise that “retribution will catch up with the hatemongers wherever and whoever they are, without a statute of limitations,” which ''Novaya Gazeta'' believed to constitute a call to violence against its journalists. On April 15, ''Novaya Gazeta'' journalist Elena Milashina announced that the she had left the country following threats against her life. On April 19, ''Novaya Gazeta'' reported that it received an envelope mailed from Chechnya containing an unidentified white powder.&lt;ref name="RUSSIA 2017 HUMAN RIGHTS REPORT" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Acts of Violence, Discrimination, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity'''&lt;br /&gt;During the year there were reports of both societal and government violence motivated by the sexual orientation or gender identity of the victim. Human rights activists and NGOs reported torture and killings of LGBTI persons in the North Caucasus by security services (see section 1.a. for information on Chechnya).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Aptheker v. Secretary of State''''', 378 U.S. 500 (1964),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Aptheker v. Secretary of State|volume=378|page=500|pin=|year=1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was a landmark [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case on the [[right to travel]] and passport restrictions as they relate to [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] [[due process]] rights and [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] [[free speech]], [[freedom of assembly]] and [[freedom of association]] rights.  It is the first case in which the US Supreme Court considered the constitutionality of personal restrictions on the right to travel abroad.

In ''Aptheker'', the petitioner challenged Section 6 of the [[Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950]], which made it a crime for any member of a Communist organization to attempt to use or obtain a passport.

== Background ==
Appellants [[Herbert Aptheker]] and [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]] were native born citizens and residents of the United States and had held valid passports. Aptheker was editor of ''[[Political Affairs (magazine)|Political Affairs]]'', the 'theoretical organ' of the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party in the United States]] and appellant Flynn was chairman of the Party. On January 22, 1962, the Acting Director of the Passport Office notified appellants that their passports were revoked because the Department of State believed that their use of the passports would violate § 6 of the Subversive Activities Control Act of 1950 which provided that it was unlawful for any member of a Communist party to apply for or to renew a US passport or to use such a passport.

Appellants requested and received hearings to review the revocations of their passports. The examiners recommended that the passport revocations be sustained. Both appellants appealed to the Board of Passport Appeals which recommended affirmance of the revocations. The Secretary of State subsequently approved the recommendations of the Board.

Appellants thereupon filed separate complaints seeking declaratory and injunctive relief in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The complaints asked that judgments be entered declaring § 6 unconstitutional and ordering the Secretary of State to issue passports to appellants. Appellant-plaintiffs alleged that § 6 was unconstitutional as, ''inter alia'', "a deprivation without due process of law of plaintiff's constitutional liberty to travel a road, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States."

The three-judge District Court rejected appellants' contentions, sustained the constitutionality
of § 6 of the Control Act, and granted the Secretary's motion for summary judgment, concluding that the enactment by Congress of § 6 was a valid exercise of the power of Congress to protect and preserve the Government against the threat posed by the world Communist movement and that the regulatory scheme bore a reasonable relation thereto.

In the US Supreme Court, appellants attacked § 6, both on its face and as applied, as an unconstitutional deprivation of the liberty guaranteed in the Bill of Rights. The Government, while conceding that the right to travel is protected by the Fifth Amendment, contended that the Due Process Clause does not prevent the reasonable regulation of liberty and that § 6 was a reasonable regulation because of its relation to the danger the world Communist movement presented for national security.  Alternatively, the Government argued that 'whether or not denial of passports to some members of the Communist Party might be deemed not reasonably related to national security, surely Section 6 was reasonable as applied to the top-ranking Party leaders involved here.

== Opinion of the Court ==
Justice Goldberg held, with Justices Black and Douglas concurring, that § 6 of the Control Act too broadly and indiscriminately restricted the right to travel and thereby abridged the liberty guaranteed by the Fifth Amendment and that § 6 of the Control Act was unconstitutional on its face.  As to the government's alternative theory, the clarity and preciseness of the provision in question made it impossible to narrow its indiscriminately cast and overly broad scope without substantial judicial rewriting which was beyond the power of the Court in this case.

=== Majority ===
The Court began with ''[[Kent v. Dulles]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Kent v. Dulles|link=|volume=357|page=116|pin=|year=1958}}.&lt;/ref&gt; reaffirming that the right to travel abroad was 'an important aspect of the citizen's 'liberty" guaranteed in the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  It then cited ''[[NAACP v. Alabama]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=NAACP v. Alabama|volume=357|page=449|pin=|year=1958}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[NAACP v. Button]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=NAACP v. Button|volume=371|page=415|pin=|year=1963}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in support of the "well-established principles by which to test whether the restrictions here imposed [were] consistent with the liberty guaranteed in the Fifth Amendment."  It enumerated these principles by citing ''[[Shelton v. Tucker]]'' via ''NAACP v. Alabama'' "'(E)ven though the governmental purpose be legitimate and substantial, that purpose cannot be pursued by means that broadly stifle fundamental personal liberties when the end can be more narrowly achieved. The breadth of legislative abridgment must be viewed in the light of less drastic means for achieving the same basic purpose.'"

It then considered the congressional purpose underlying § 6 of the Control Act, noting that the legislation in question flowed from the congressional desire to protect national security which it held was obviously and unarguably within the Congress' Constitutional power.  But it concluded that the legislation was indiscriminate due to an absence of criteria linking the bare fact of membership in a Communist organization to the individual's knowledge, activity or commitment. The provision swept within its prohibition both knowing and unknowing members, citing ''[[Wieman v. Updegraff]]'': 'Indiscriminate classification of innocent with knowing activity must fall as an assertion of arbitrary power.'&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Wieman v. Updegraff|volume=344|page=183|pin=191|year=1952}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The irrebuttable presumption of Section 6 that individuals who are members of the specified organizations will, if given passports, engage in activities inimical to the security of the United States also rendered irrelevant the member's degree of activity in the organization and his commitment to its purpose, citing ''Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Schware v. Board of Bar Examiners|volume=353|page=246|pin=|year=1957}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court further noted that section 6 excluded other considerations which might more closely relate the denial of passports to the stated purpose of the legislation, such as the purposes for which an individual wishes to travel or the security-sensitivity of the areas in which he wishes to travel. In determining whether there has been an abridgment of the Fifth Amendment's guarantee of liberty, the Court recognized the danger of punishing a member of a Communist organization 'for his adherence to lawful and constitutionally protected purposes, because of other and unprotected purposes which he does not necessarily share, citing ''[[Noto v. United States]]''.  And it noted that Congress had within its power 'less drastic' means of achieving the congressional objective of safeguarding the nation's security.

The Court then considered the government's alternate theory, rejecting it because the law was clear and precise and could not be judicially rewritten to take in only top party members.  The Court concluded that "since freedom of travel is a constitutional liberty closely related to rights of free speech and association, we believe that appellants in this case should not be required to assume the burden of demonstrating that Congress could not have written a statute constitutionally prohibiting their travel."

=== Concurrence ===
In a concurring opinion, Justice Black expressed his opinion that the whole act, including Section 6, was a [[bill of attainder]].  He held it appropriate "to point out that the Framers thought that the best way to promote the internal security of our people is to protect their First Amendment freedoms of speech, press, religion and assembly, and that we cannot take away the liberty of groups whose views most people detest without jeopardizing the liberty of all others whose views, though popular today, may themselves be detested tomorrow."

Justice Douglas, also concurring, opined that "Freedom of movement is kin to the right of assembly and to the right of association. These rights may not be abridged," citing ''[[De Jonge v. Oregon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=De Jonge v. Oregon|volume=299|page=353|pin=|year=1937}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  "War may be the occasion for serious curtailment of liberty. Absent war, I see no way to keep a citizen from traveling within or without the country, unless there is power to detain him. ''[[Ex parte Endo]]'', 323 U.S. 283, 65 S.Ct. 208, 89 L.Ed. 243. And no authority to detain exists except under extreme conditions, e.g., unless he has been convicted of a crime or unless there is probable cause for issuing a warrant of arrest by standards of the Fourth Amendment."  "We cannot exercise and enjoy citizenship in world perspective without the right to travel abroad; and I see no constitutional way to curb it unless, as I said, there is the power to detain."

=== Dissent ===
Justice Clark wrote the minority opinion which was joined by Justices Harlan and White.  The minority objected to the refusal of the majority to consider the government's alternate theory, citing ''[[United States v. Raines]]'', 362 U.S. 17, distinguishing the Court's thinking in First Amendment cases in ''[[Thornhill v. Alabama|Thornhill]]'' and ''[[NAACP v. Button|Button]]'' and Fifth Amendment cases in ''Kent''.  The minority would hold that as applied to the prosecution of the Communist Party's top dignitaries, the section was clearly constitutional, noting that Aptheker and Flynn fail the majority's criteria for "indiscriminate" because each clearly knew of their party membership and each was committed to its causes.  Neither desired to travel to some innocent destination.   Consequently, the Court should not reject the law on the hypothetical but should rather hold the law constitutional as applied.

He would also find the section valid on its face, holding that the remedy adopted by the Congress had a [[rational basis]] because it was reasonably related to national security and reasonably tailored to accomplish the purpose.  He rejected the "loose generalization" that individual guilt might be conclusively presumed from membership in the Party" because the matter could not be held in isolation but need be considered relative to the subject matter involved and legislative findings.

Justice White, without elaboration, would hold Section 6 constitutional as applied but did not join Justice Clark in his facial analysis.

{{History of Bangladesh}}

The Bengali '''Language Movement''' ({{lang-bn|ভাষা আন্দোলন}} ''Bhasha Andolôn'') was a political movement in former [[East Bengal]] &lt;!-- Please note that East Bengal was the administrative division of the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] corresponding to today's Bangladesh from 1947 to 1955 --&gt; (currently [[Bangladesh]]) advocating the recognition of the [[Bengali language]] as an [[official language]] of the then-[[Dominion of Pakistan]] in order to allow its use in government affairs, the continuation of its use as a medium of education, its use in media, currency and stamps, and to maintain its writing in the [[Bengali script]].

When the Dominion of Pakistan was formed by the [[partition of India]] in 1947, it was composed of various ethnic and linguistic groups, with the geographically non-contiguous East Bengal province (that was [[One Unit|renamed]] in 1956 as [[East Pakistan]]) having a mainly [[Bengali people|Bengali]] population. In 1948, the [[Governor-General of Pakistan|Government of the Dominion of Pakistan]] ordained [[Urdu]] as the sole national language, sparking extensive protests among the Bengali-speaking majority of East Bengal. Facing rising sectarian tensions and mass discontent with the new law, the government outlawed public meetings and rallies. The students of the [[University of Dhaka]] and other political activists defied the law and organised a protest on 21 February 1952. The movement reached its climax when police killed student demonstrators on that day. The deaths provoked widespread civil unrest. After years of conflict, the central government relented and granted official status to the Bengali language in 1956.

The Language Movement catalysed the assertion of Bengali national identity in East Bengal and later East Pakistan, and became a forerunner to Bengali nationalist movements, including the [[6 Point Movement|6-Point Movement]] and subsequently the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] and [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. In Bangladesh, 21 February (''Ekushey February'') is observed as [[Language Movement Day]], a national holiday. The [[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]] monument was constructed near Dhaka Medical College in memory of the movement and its victims. In 1999, [[UNESCO]] declared 21 February as [[International Mother Language Day]],&lt;ref&gt;Glassie, Henry and Mahmud, Feroz.2008.Living Traditions. Cultural Survey of Bangladesh Series-II. Asiatic Society of Bangladesh. Dhaka. International Mother Language Day&lt;/ref&gt;  in tribute to the Language Movement and the ethno-linguistic rights of people around the world.

==Background==
The current nations, Pakistan and Bangladesh, were part of an undivided India during the British colonial rule. From the mid-19th century, the [[Urdu]] language had been promoted as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of [[Islam in India|Indian Muslims]] by political and religious leaders, such as [[Khwaja Salimullah|Sir Khwaja Salimullah]], [[Sir Syed Ahmed Khan]], [[Nawab Viqar-ul-Mulk]] and [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]].&lt;ref name="urducontrov"&gt;{{cite web

While the use of Urdu grew common with Muslims in northern India, the Muslims of [[Bengal]] (a province in the eastern part of British Indian sub-continent) primarily used the Bengali language.

As early as the late 19th century, social activists such as the [[Islamic feminism|Muslim feminist]] [[Roquia Sakhawat Hussain]] were choosing to write in Bengali to reach out to the people and develop it as a modern literary language.  Supporters of Bengali opposed Urdu even before the [[partition of India]], when delegates from Bengal rejected the idea of making Urdu the lingua franca of Muslim India in the 1937 [[Lucknow]] session of the [[All-India Muslim League|Muslim League]]. The Muslim League was a [[British India]]n political party that became the driving force behind the creation of [[Pakistan]] as a [[Muslim]] state separate from British India.&lt;ref name="tariqcontrov"&gt;{{cite journal

==Early stages of the movement==
[[Image:Partition of India.PNG|thumb|Britain's holdings on the [[Indian subcontinent]] were granted independence in 1947 and 1948, becoming four new independent states: the [[Dominion of India]], the [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–1962|Union of Burma]] (now Myanmar), [[Dominion of Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]), the [[Kingdom of Sikkim]] (now part of India), and the [[Dominion of Pakistan]] (including [[East Bengal]], from 1956 [[East Pakistan]], 1971-today [[Bangladesh]]).]]

After the partition of India in 1947, Bengali-speaking people in [[East Bengal]], the non-contiguous eastern part of the [[Dominion of Pakistan]], made up 44 million of the newly formed Dominion of Pakistan's 69 million people.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"&gt;{{cite book |last=Al Helal |first=Bashir |year=2012 |chapter=Language Movement |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Language_Movement |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307033428/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Language_Movement |archivedate=7 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dominion of Pakistan's government, civil services, and military, however, were dominated by personnel from the western wing of the Dominion of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="JSToldenburg"&gt;{{cite journal

Students from Dhaka rallied under the leadership of [[Principal Abul Kashem|Abul Kashem]], the secretary of [[Tamaddun Majlish]], a Bengali Islamic cultural organisation. The meeting stipulated Bengali as an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan and as a medium of education in East Bengal.&lt;ref name="umarharv1"&gt;{{Harv|Umar|1979|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Pakistan Public Service Commission]] removed Bengali from the list of approved subjects, as well as from currency notes and stamps. The central education minister Fazlur Rahman made extensive preparations to make Urdu the only state language of the Dominion of Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=227–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Public outrage spread, and many Bengali students met on the University of Dhaka campus on 8 December 1947 to formally demand that Bengali be made an official language. To promote their cause, Bengali students organised processions and rallies in Dhaka.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;

Leading Bengali scholars argued why Urdu should not be the only state language. The writer [[Abul Mansur Ahmed]] said if Urdu became the state language, the educated society of East Bengal would become 'illiterate' and 'ineligible' for government positions.&lt;ref name="umarharvmansur"&gt;{{Harv|Umar|1979|pp=30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Rastrabhasa Sangram Parishad]] (National Language Action Committee), an organisation in favour of Bengali as a state language was formed towards the end of December 1947. Professor [[Nurul Huq Bhuiyan]] of the Tamaddun Majlish  convened the committee.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sri"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ekusher Shongkolon '80|year=1980 |publisher=[[Bangla Academy]] |location=Dhaka |language=bn |pages=102–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Parliament member [[Shamsul Huq]] convened a new committee to push for Bengali as a state language.

[[File:Quaid-delivering-speech copy2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] on 21 March 1948 told at a public meeting that ''State language of Pakistan is going to be Urdu and no other language.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://jinnah.pk/2009/09/27/national-consolidation/# |title=NATIONAL CONSOLIDATION |access-date=21 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521104719/http://jinnah.pk/2009/09/27/national-consolidation/# |archive-date=21 May 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Students of the [[University of Dhaka]] and other colleges of the city organised a general strike on 11 March 1948 to protest the omission of Bengali language from official use, including coins, stamps and recruitment tests for the navy. The movement restated the demand that Bengali be declared an official language of the Dominion of Pakistan. Political leaders such as Shamsul Huq, [[Shawkat Ali]], [[M Sirajul Islam]], [[Kazi Golam Mahboob]], [[Oli Ahad]], Abdul Wahed and others were arrested during the rallies. Rally leader [[Mohammad Toaha]] was hospitalised after attempting to snatch a rifle from a police officer. Student leaders, including [[Abdul Matin (language activist)|Abdul Matin]] and [[Abdul Malek Ukil]] took part in the procession.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"/&gt;

In the afternoon of 11 March, a meeting was held to protest police brutality and arrests. A group of students marching towards the chief minister [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]]'s house was stopped in front of the [[Dhaka High Court]]. The rally changed its direction and moved in the direction of the Secretariat building. Police attacked the procession injuring several students and leaders, including [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]].&lt;ref name="helal263"&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=263–265}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continuing strikes were observed the following four days. Under such circumstances, the chief minister Nazimuddin signed an accord with the student leaders agreeing to some terms and conditions, without complying to the demand that Bengali be made a state language.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;

In the height of civic unrest, [[Governor-General of Pakistan]] [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] arrived in Dhaka on 19 March 1948. On 21 March, at a civic reception at [[Suhrawardy Udyan|Racecourse Ground]], he claimed that the language issue was designed by a "[[fifth column]]" to divide Pakistani Muslims.&lt;ref name="choudhury"&gt;{{cite journal

==Events of 1952==

[[Image:1952 Bengali Language movement.jpg|thumb|Procession march held on 21 February 1952 in [[Dhaka]]]]
The Urdu-Bengali controversy was reignited when Jinnah's successor, governor-general [[Khawaja Nazimuddin]], staunchly defended the "Urdu-only" policy in a speech on 27 January 1952.&lt;ref name="helal263" /&gt; On 31 January, the ''[[Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod]]'' (All-Party Central Language Action Committee) was formed in a meeting at the Bar Library Hall of the University of Dhaka, chaired by [[Maulana Bhashani]].&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Umar|2004|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The central government's proposal of writing the Bengali language in [[Arabic script]] was vehemently opposed at the meeting. The action committee called for an all out protest on 21 February, including strikes and rallies.&lt;ref name="helal263" /&gt; In an attempt to prevent the demonstration, the government imposed [[Section 144]] in Dhaka, thereby banning any gathering.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"/&gt;

===21 February===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Meeting at Amtala on Ekushey February.JPG|thumb|Meeting on the University of Dhaka premises on 21 February 1952]] --&gt;
At nine o'clock in the morning, students began gathering on the University of Dhaka premises in defiance of Section 144. The university vice-chancellor and other officials were present as armed police surrounded the campus. By a quarter past eleven, students gathered at the university gate and attempted to break the police line. Police fired [[tear gas]] shells towards the gate to warn the students.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt; A section of students ran into the Dhaka Medical College while others rallied towards the university premises cordoned by the police. The vice-chancellor asked police to stop firing and ordered the students to leave the area. However, the police arrested several students for violating section 144 as they attempted to leave. Enraged by the arrests, the students met around the [[East Bengal Legislative Assembly]] and blocked the legislators' way, asking them to present their insistence at the assembly. When a group of students sought to storm into the building, police opened fire and killed a number of students, including [[Abdus Salam (language martyr)|Abdus Salam]], [[Rafiq Uddin Ahmed]], [[Abul Barkat]] and [[Abdul Jabbar (activist)|Abdul Jabbar]].&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the news of the killings spread, disorder erupted across the city. Shops, offices and public transport were shut down and a general strike began.&lt;ref name="UStudies" /&gt; At the assembly, six legislators including [[Manoranjan Dhar]], Boshontokumar Das, Shamsuddin Ahmed and [[Dhirendranath Datta]] requested that chief minister [[Nurul Amin]] visit wounded students in hospital and that the assembly be adjourned as a sign of mourning.&lt;ref name="bashir377393"&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=377–393}}&lt;/ref&gt; This motion was supported by some treasury bench members including [[Maulana Abdur Rashid Tarkabagish]], Shorfuddin Ahmed, Shamsuddin Ahmed Khondokar and Mosihuddin Ahmed.&lt;ref name="bashir377393" /&gt; However, Nurul Amin refused the requests.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bashir377393" /&gt;

===22 February===
Disorder spread across the province as large processions ignored [[section 144]] and condemned the actions of the police.&lt;ref name="helal263" /&gt; More than 30,000 people congregated at Curzon Hall in Dhaka. During the continued protests, police actions led to the death of four more people. This prompted officers and clerks from different organisations, including colleges, banks and the radio station, to boycott offices and join the procession.&lt;ref name="UStudies" /&gt; Protesters burned the offices of two leading pro-government news agencies, the ''Jubilee Press'' and the ''Morning News''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Continued unrest===

Through the night of 23 February, students of Dhaka Medical College worked on the construction of a ''Shaheed Smritistombho'', or Monument of Martyrs. Completed at dawn on 24 February, the monument had a handwritten note attached to it with the words ''"Shaheed Smritistombho"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/arts-entertainment/its-true-3041|title=IT'S TRUE!|date=2015-02-21|work=The Daily Star|access-date=2018-01-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inaugurated by the father of the slain activist Sofiur Rahman, the monument was destroyed on 26 February by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shaheed_Minar|title=Shaheed Minar|last=Rafique|first=Ahmed|date=|website=en.banglapedia.org|publisher=Banglapedia|language=en|access-date=2018-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 February, industrial workers in the town of [[Narayanganj]] observed a general strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Umar|2004|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; A protest followed on 29 February whose participants faced severe police beating.&lt;ref name="umarnarayan"&gt;{{Harv|Umar|1979|pp=417–418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reaction in West Pakistan===
Although the Language Movement is considered to have laid the foundations for [[ethnic nationalism]] in many of the Bengalis of East Bengal and later East Pakistan, it also heightened the cultural animosity between the authorities of the two wings of Pakistan.&lt;ref name="B2g" /&gt;&lt;ref name="uddin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BH"&gt;{{cite web

This kind of thinking also provoked considerable opposition in the western wing, wherein there existed several linguistic groups.&lt;ref name="JSToldenburg" /&gt; As late as in 1967, military dictator Ayub Khan said, "East Bengal is ... still under considerable Hindu culture and influence."&lt;ref name="JSToldenburg" /&gt;

==Events after 1952==
[[Image:21feb1956 Shaheed Minar Dhaka.jpg|right|thumb|Foundation of the Shaheed Minar laid down in Dhaka by Abul Barkat's family members.]]
The ''Shorbodolio Kendrio Rashtrobhasha Kormi Porishod'', with support from the [[Bangladesh Awami League|Awami Muslim League]], decided to commemorate 21 February as ''Shohid Dibosh'' . On the first anniversary of the protests, people across East Bengal wore black badges in solidarity with the victims. Most offices, banks and educational institutions were closed to observe the occasion. Student groups made agreements with college and police officials to preserve law and order. More than 100,000 people assembled at a public meeting held in Dhaka, where community leaders called for the immediate release of Maulana Bhashani and other political prisoners.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia" /&gt; However, West Pakistani politicians such as Fazlur Rahman aggravated sectional tensions by declaring that anyone who wanted Bengali to become an official language would be considered an "enemy of the state". Bengali students and civilians disobeyed the restrictions to celebrate the anniversary of the protests. Demonstrations broke out on the night of 21 February 1954 with various halls of the University of Dhaka raising black flags in mourning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=604–609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Front in 1954===
Political tensions came to a head as elections to the provincial assembly of East Bengal were held in 1954. The ruling Muslim League denounced the opposition [[United Front (East Pakistan)|United Front]] coalition, which—led by [[A. K. Fazlul Huq]] and the Awami League—wanted greater provincial autonomy. Several United Front leaders and activists were arrested.&lt;ref name="Helal601603"&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=600–603}}&lt;/ref&gt; A meeting of parliament's Muslim League members, chaired by prime minister [[Muhammad Ali Bogra]], resolved to give official recognition to Bengali. This decision was followed by a major wave of unrest as other ethnic groups sought recognition of other regional languages. Proponents of Urdu such as [[Maulvi Abdul Haq]] condemned any proposal to grant official status to Bengali. He led a rally of 100,000 people to protest against the Muslim League's decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The United Front ministry ordered the creation of the [[Bangla Academy]] to promote, develop, and preserve Bengali language, literature, and heritage.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia2"&gt;{{cite book |last= Al Helal |first=Bashir|year=2012 |chapter=Bangla Academy |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Bangla_Academy |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the United Front rule was temporary, as [[Governor General of Pakistan|Governor General]] [[Malik Ghulam Muhammad|Ghulam Muhammad]] cancelled the government and started Governor's rule on 30 May 1954.&lt;ref name="Helal601603" /&gt; The United Front again formed the ministry on 6 June 1955 after the governor's regime ended. The Awami League did not participate in this ministry though.&lt;ref name="bashir608613"&gt;{{Harv|Al Helal|2003|pp=608–613}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the return of the United Front to power, the anniversary on 21 February 1956 was observed for the first time in a peaceful atmosphere. The Government supported a major project to construct a new Shaheed Minar. The session of the constituent assembly was stopped for five minutes to express condolence for the students slain in the police shootings. Major rallies were organised by Bengali leaders and all public offices and businesses remained closed.&lt;ref name="bashir608613" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Constitutional reform===
On 7 May 1954, the constituent assembly resolved, with the Muslim League's support, to grant official status to Bengali.&lt;ref name="Pakspace" /&gt; Bengali was recognised as the second official language of Pakistan on 29 February 1956, and article 214(1) of the constitution of Pakistan was reworded to "The state language of Pakistan shall be Urdu and Bengali."

However, the military government formed by [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] made attempts to re-establish Urdu as the sole national language. On 6 January 1959, the military regime issued an official statement and reinstated the official stance of supporting the 1956 constitution's policy of two state languages.&lt;ref name="lambert"&gt;{{cite journal

===Assam===
Outside East Bengal, movement for equal status of Bengali also took place in the Indian state of [[Assam]]. On 19 May 1961, 11 Bengalis were killed in police firing in [[Silchar]] Railway Station, Assam, while demanding state recognition of Bengali language. Subsequently, Bengali was given co-official status in the three Bengali-majority districts of Assam.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sarkar |first=Gautam |date=20 May 2008 |title=Court route for language status |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080520/jsp/jharkhand/story_9294570.jsp |newspaper=The Telegraph |location=Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shaheed Minar 1963.png|thumb|The second Shaheed Minar (martyrs' monument) completed in 1963]]
Although the question of official languages was settled by 1956, the military regime of Ayub Khan promoted the interests of [[West Pakistan]] at the expense of [[East Pakistan]]. Despite forming the majority of the national population, the East Pakistani population continued to be under-represented in the civil and military services, and received a minority of state funding and other government help. This was mainly due to lack of [[democracy|representative government]] in the fledgling state. Mainly due to regional economic imbalances sectional divisions grew, and support for the Bengali ethnic nationalist Awami League,&lt;ref name="uddin" /&gt; which invoked the [[Six point movement|6-point movement]] for greater provincial autonomy. One demand was that East Pakistan be called ''Bangladesh'' (Land/Country of Bengal), which subsequently led to the Bangladesh Liberation War.&lt;ref name="B2g" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JSToldenburg" /&gt;

The Language Movement had a major cultural impact on Bengali society. It has inspired the development and celebration of the Bengali language, literature and culture. 21 February, celebrated as Language Movement Day or ''Shohid Dibosh'' (Martyrs' Day), is a major national holiday in Bangladesh. A month-long event called the [[Ekushey Book Fair]] is held every year to commemorate the movement. ''[[Ekushey Padak]]'', one of the highest civilian awards in Bangladesh, is awarded annually in memory of the sacrifices of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Khan |first=Sanjida |year=2012 |chapter=National Awards |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=National_Awards |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Songs such as [[Abdul Gaffar Choudhury]]'s ''[[Ekusher Gaan]]'', set to music by Shaheed [[Altaf Mahmud]], as well as plays, works of art and poetry played a considerable role in rousing the people's emotions during the movement.&lt;ref name="cultureimp"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aminzade |first=Ronald |authorlink= |author2=Douglas McAdam |author3=Charles Tilly |date=17 September 2001 |chapter=Emotions and Contentious Politics |title=Silence and Voice in the Study of Contentious Politics |url=https://books.google.com/?id=h8PNEOZRRt8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bangladesh+language+movement |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |page=42 |isbn=0-521-00155-2 |accessdate=2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the events of February 1952, poems, songs, novels, plays, films, cartoons and paintings were created to capture the movement from varied point of views. Notable artistic depictions include the poems ''Bornomala, Amar Dukhini Bornomala'' and ''February 1969'' by [[Shamsur Rahman (poet)|Shamsur Rahman]], the film ''[[Jibon Theke Neya]]'' by [[Zahir Raihan]], the stage play ''Kobor'' by [[Munier Chowdhury]] and the novels ''Ekushey February'' by Raihan and ''Artonaad'' by [[Shawkat Osman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Islam |first=Rafiqul |title=Amar Ekushey O Shaheed Minar|year=2000 |publisher=Poroma |location=Dhaka |language=bn |isbn=984-8245-39-1 |pages=62–85  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years after the first monument was destroyed by the police, a new ''[[Shaheed Minar, Dhaka|Shaheed Minar]]'' (Monument of Martyrs) was constructed in 1954 to commemorate the protesters who lost their lives. Work on a larger monument designed by the architect [[Hamidur Rahman (artist)|Hamidur Rahman]] began in 1957 with the support of the United Front ministry. Hamidur Rahman's model consisted of a large complex in the yard of the Dhaka Medical College Hostel. The design included a half-circular column  symbolizing a mother with her martyred sons standing at the dais in the centre of the monument. Although the imposition of martial law in 1958 interrupted the work, the monument was completed and inaugurated on 21 February 1963 by [[Abul Barkat]]'s mother, Hasina Begum. Pakistani forces demolished the monument during the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, but the Bangladeshi government reconstructed it in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Imam |first=Jahanara |authorlink=Jahanara Imam |title=Ekattorer Dingulee|year=1986 |publisher=Shondhani Prokashani |location=Dhaka |language=bn |isbn=984-480-000-5 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ekushey Television]], the first private terrestrial TV channel of Bangladesh was named after the Event of 21 February.

The states of [[West Bengal]] and [[Tripura]] in [[India]] also follow and celebrate the Day by paying tribute to the unsung heroes. Moreover, all the bengalees in India and abroad celebrate the Day for the sacrifice of lives just for the sake of the [[First language]].

===Worldwide===
Bangladesh officially sent a proposal to UNESCO to declare 21 February as [[International Mother Language Day]]. The proposal was supported unanimously at the 30th General Conference of UNESCO held on 17 November 1999.&lt;ref name="UN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmo.gov.bd/21february/imld_back.htm|title=International Mother Language Day – Background and Adoption of the Resolution|work=Government of Bangladesh|accessdate = 2007-06-21| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070520205804/http://www.pmo.gov.bd/21february/imld_back.htm| archivedate=20 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BPF's work includes:&lt;br&gt;
1 Sparking conversation at the intersection of Buddhism and social justice;&lt;br&gt;
2 Training Buddhist political activists;&lt;br&gt;
3 Mobilizing people to action from a Buddhist perspective;&lt;br&gt;
4 Building a network of radical Buddhist activists.}}

BPF is currently led by codirectors Katie Loncke and Dawn Haney and a national board of seven individuals.

==About==
The Buddhist Peace Fellowship is a [[grassroots]] movement established in 1978 by [[Robert Baker Aitken]] and [[Anne Hopkins Aitken]], along with Nelson Foster and others, on the front porch of their Maui Zendo in [[Hawaii]]. Sitting around a table, the assembled group discussed [[nuclear weapons]] and [[militarism]] within the [[United States]] in the years following the [[Vietnam War]], finding that these issues must be addressed with compassion from a [[Buddhist]] perspective in order to bring about peace.&lt;ref name="queen"/&gt; Original members were centered primarily in Hawaii or the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], and by 1979 the group had roughly fifty members. To stay connected, the group formulated a newsletter spearheaded by Nelson Foster which evolved into ''Turning Wheel''—the quarterly magazine published by the BPF.&lt;ref name="prebish"&gt;{{cite book| last =Prebish| first =Charles S.| year =1999| title =Luminous Passage: The Practice and Study of Buddhism in America| pages= 108–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Turning Wheel Media is an online home for activists and thinkers, writers and readers, a place to bring Buddhist teachings into conversation with the world. By the late 1980s the association had hundreds of members, and the headquarters had moved to office space in [[Berkeley, California]]. During this time much of their work was geared toward [[human rights]] efforts in areas of the world such as [[Cambodia]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Bangladesh]], working particularly hard at freeing Buddhist prisoners of the [[Unified Buddhist Church of Vietnam]]. This period in BPF history also was marked by the hiring of a coordinator and the development of national chapters.&lt;ref name="prebish"/&gt;

BPF went through a turbulent period after longtime executive director Alan Senauke left at the end of 2001. After two executive directors who served less than a year and a period of no clear leadership, board member Maia Duerr was asked to lead the organisation in 2004. During her three-year tenure, the BPF stabilised its finances, and considerable effort were made to bolster its nationwide outreach and include chapters in decision-making processes. Also during this period, Duerr led two "Buddhist Peace Delegations" to Washington, D.C., to call for an end to war in Iraq. Since 2012, Co-Directors Katie Loncke and Dawn Haney have supported the organisation's "Radical Rebirth" as one focused on present-day issues of racial justice, climate change, and militarisation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Buddhist Peace Fellowship appeals to Westerners who have embraced Buddhism and who also believe that their chosen path must address the pressing issues of the day. More a religious movement than a political one, the BPF is fuelled by an expressed need to modify or extend traditional spiritual practice.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Many individual activists from different traditions network through the Buddhist Peace Fellowship (BPF), an organisation that facilitates individual and group social engagement in the United States and Asia and often works together with the International Network of Engaged Buddhists (INEB). The BPF is the largest and most effective of the engaged Buddhist networks.

==Current Projects==

===Turning Wheel Media===
Turning Wheel Media is the online version of BPF's award-winning magazine, Turning Wheel. It provides a platform for lively debate, lifts up Buddhist perspectives on current events, guides inspired readers to groups already taking action, and brings Buddhist teachings into conversation with the world. 

===The System Stinks: Curriculum for Buddhist Activists===
Designed to help promote collective liberation and subvert the highly individualistic bent of much mainstream dharma these days, in 2013 Buddhist Peace Fellowship began offering The System Stinks — a collection of Buddhist social justice media named for the favourite protest sign of one of BPF's founders, Robert Aitken, Roshi. In 2013, the curriculum covered a systemic take on The Five Precepts - violence, theft, sexual misconduct, lying, and intoxication. In 2014, The System Stinks reviewed the Buddha's core teachings on The Four Noble Truths, from seasoned practitioners like Mushim Ikeda, Maia Duerr, Zenju Earthlyn Manuel, and Alan Senauke, as well as newcomers like Funie Hsu and Faith Adiele. Starting in 2015, The System Stinks will cover teachings on The Three Dharma Seals - impermanence, non-self, and liberation.

==Former Projects==

===Buddhist Alliance for Social Engagement===
The Buddhist Alliance for Social Engagement (BASE) is an extension of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship established in 1995,&lt;ref name="jones"&gt;{{cite book| last =Jones| first =Ken|authorlink=Ken Jones (Buddhist)| year =2003| title =The New Social Face of Buddhism: A Call to Action|url =http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=0861713656&amp;=Search&amp;qt=owc_search| pages= 201–202}}&lt;/ref&gt; offering training and internship programs based on the model set forward by the [[Jesuit Volunteer Corps]] for [[social worker]]s, activists and human service workers. It has chapters in various cities in the [[United States]], including [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boston, Massachusetts]], aiming to help professionals integrate their work with Buddhist practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Mink| first =Gwendolyn| authorlink =|author2=O'Connor, Alice| year =2004| title =Poverty in the United States: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, and Policy| pages= 121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind BASE was originally conceived of by [[Robert Baker Aitken]] during discussions at a BPF meeting held in [[Oakland, California]] in 1992, although it was [[Diana Winston]] who ultimately saw this vision through. She was somewhat disheartened to find that many of the BPF members were not actively engaged in meditation, so she set out to develop a "training program that would integrate Buddhist practice, social engagement, and community life into one organic whole."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Queen| first =Christopher| year =2000| title =Engaged Buddhism in the West| pages= 86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
BASE is meant to provide for lay American Buddhists the kind of institutional support for the cultivation of socially engaged Buddhism available to Asian monks and nuns who are part of a monastic sangha. But it is also inspired by the BASE community of Latin America, which was founded in the 1970s as a vehicle for Catholic liberation theology...BASE emphasised social engagement as a path of Buddhist practice, not simply as a mode of Buddhist social service.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
BASE participants combine weekly meetings for meditation and study with fifteen to thirty hours a week working in hospices, homeless shelters, prisons, medical clinics, and activist organizations.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Buddhist Peace Fellowship Prison Project===
Another outgrowth of the BPF is the Buddhist Peace Fellowship Prison Project, a committee within BPF which works with prisoners and their families and other religious groups in an effort to address violence within the [[criminal justice system]]. They oppose the implementation of [[capital punishment]] and also offer prisons information on [[chaplaincy]] opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Queen| first =Christopher| year =2000| title =Engaged Buddhism in the West| page= 358}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee's founding director was Diana Lion, who also has served as associate director of the Buddhist Peace Fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Gregory| first =Peter N.|author2=Mrozik, Susanne| year =2007| title =Women Practicing Buddhism: American Experiences| page= 101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
...the BPF Prison project...is attempting to transform the prison system through reforming the prison-industrial complex, abolishing the death penalty, and bringing the teachings of "dharma" to those persons confined in prisons and jails...

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Buddhist AIDS Project===
In 1993 the Buddhist AIDS Project (BAP), based in [[San Francisco, California]] was founded, a [[non-profit]] affiliate of the BPF run entirely by [[volunteerism|volunteers]], serving individuals with [[HIV/AIDS]], those who are [[HIV positive]], their families, and their [[caregiver]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Irwin| first =Alexander C.| authorlink =|author2=Irwin, Alec |author3=Millen, Joyce |author4= Fallows, Dorothy | year =2003| title =Global AIDS: Myths and Facts : Tools for Fighting the AIDS Pandemic| page= 200}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buddhistaidsproject.org Buddhist aids project]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activist activities==
On [[Hiroshima Day]] of August 6, 2005 the [[Tampa, Florida]] chapter of BPF organised The Hiroshima Memorial in conjunction with [[Pax Christi]], designed to raise consciousness about the issue of nuclear war. The two groups released "peace lanterns" into the air and participants held [[vigil]]s and various talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Moore| first =Waveney Ann| authorlink =| title =In peace, they honour Hiroshima: Saturday marks 60 years since the first atomic bomb fell upon the Japanese city| work =| publisher =[[St. Petersburg Times]]| date =2005-08-04| url =http://www.sptimes.com/2005/08/04/Southpinellas/In_peace__they_honor_.shtml| doi =| accessdate = 2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Hiroshima Day of August 6, 2006, the Buddhist Peace Fellowship of [[Santa Cruz, California]] used the occasion to protest the [[Iraq War]]. Participants of the group "displayed a three foot tall, hundred foot long, scroll listing 40,000 names of Iraqi civilians killed in the war. There was also a pair of booths created which listed the names, photos, and brief stories, of over 2,000 US and coalition soldiers who also died in the war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| authorlink =| title =Hiroshima Day: Buddhist Peace Fellowship Displays Names of Iraq War Dead| work =| publisher =Santa Cruz Indymedia| date =2006-08-06| url =http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2006/08/06/18295168.php| format =| doi =| accessdate = 2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007 the [[Milwaukee]] chapter of BPF organised a silent "lakefront demonstration" to lend their support to the [[Buddhist]]s of [[Myanmar]] protesting the oppression of the [[military junta]] there. Plans were made to sneak photographs and information on the Milwaukee event into Myanmar, to let protesters know that there are outsiders standing with them in solidarity. Some members reported being told that their phones were likely [[covert listening device|bugged]] in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Heinen| first =Tom| authorlink =| title =Myanmar is march's focus: Demonstrations help solidarity, organisers say| work =| publisher =[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]| date =2007-10-19| url =http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=676813| format =| doi =| accessdate = 2008-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catalan Solidarity for Independence''' ([[Catalan language|Catalan]]: ''Solidaritat Catalana per la Independència'', ''SI''; {{IPA-ca|suliðəɾiˈtat kətəˈlanə pəɾ lə jndəpənˈdɛnsi.ə|IPA}}) is an [[electoral coalition]] in [[Catalonia]], founded in the summer of 2010 as an outcome of the grassroots [[social movement]] that initiated and organized the [[Catalan independence referendums, 2009–2011|Catalan independence referendums of 2009 and 2010]]. It was organized as a common political platform for [[Catalan independentism]], dissatisfied with what they considered a pragmatist and conformist policy of other Catalan parties (including the independentist [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]) towards the issue of independence.

Currently, it is the second largest independentist political force in Catalonia after Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya. It had 4 representatives in the [[Catalan Parliament]] until the [[Catalan parliamentary election, 2012|2012 parliamentary election]].

It was formed on 20 July 2010 by former [[FC Barcelona]] president [[Joan Laporta]], the jurist [[Alfons López Tena]] (former activist of the [[Democratic Convergence of Catalonia]]) and the Catalan MP [[Uriel Bertran]] (former [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya|ERC]] member) as an umbrella group for various supporters of [[Catalan independence]] and the creation of a [[sovereign state]] for Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naciodigital.cat/noticia/16737/laporta/tena/uriel/presenten/gran/coalicio/independentista Laporta, Tena i Uriel presenten la «gran coalició independentista»], Nació Digital.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://avui.elpunt.cat/noticia/article/3-politica/17-politica/197335.html Laporta, Tena i Bertran invoquen l'esperit de Solidaritat Catalana], El Punt.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalia.info/en/news/784 Former FC Barcelona’s President Joan Laporta proposes an inclusive Catalan pro-independence coalition], Nationalia.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cataloniadirect.info/2010/07/laporta-lopez-tena-bertran-catalan-coalition-independence/ Laporta, López Tena and Bertran create a coalition for Catalonia’s independence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808083237/http://www.cataloniadirect.info/2010/07/laporta-lopez-tena-bertran-catalan-coalition-independence/# |date=8 August 2010 }}, Catalonia Direct.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.demotix.com/news/394184/laporta-launches-new-alliance-catalan-independence Laporta launches new alliance for Catalan independence], Demotix.&lt;/ref&gt; It was named after [[Catalan Solidarity (1906)|Catalan Solidarity]], a political coalition of all pro-Catalan parties which existed between 1906 and 1909.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Catalan Solidarity for Independence was formed as an [[electoral coalition]] of six [[Political party|political parties]] (''Democràcia Catalana'', ''Solidaritat per la Independència'', ''Partit Republicà Català'', ''Els Verds-Alternativa Verda'', ''Catalunya Nació Independència'' and ''Partit Socialista d'Alliberament Nacional'') to stand for the [[Catalonian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 parliamentary election in Catalonia]]. Negotiations to incorporate the group [[Reagrupament|Realignment for Independence]] failed due to a disagreement regarding the compilation of electoral list, and divergence in both tactical and strategic considerations.

Its slogans are: "Catalonia the next state of Europe" and "Let's make independence possible".

Many public figures have supported the movement, for example [[Hèctor López Bofill]], [[Toni Strubell i Trueta|Toni Strubell]], [[Isabel-Clara Simó]], [[Carles Solà]] and [[Josep Guia]].

In the [[Catalonian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 Catalan elections]], it won 3.28% of the vote and 4 deputies in the [[Parliament of Catalonia]], among them the three co-founders. Three were elected in the [[Province of Barcelona|constituency of Barcelona]], and one in the [[Province of Girona|constituency of Girona]].

In 2011, the party's co-founder [[Joan Laporta]] left the group. The new party leader was Alfons López Tena.

[[File:Mauerkreuze am Checkpoint Charlie.jpg|thumb|The [[Freedom Memorial]]]]
The '''Checkpoint Charlie Museum''' ({{lang-de|Das Mauermuseum – Museum Haus am Checkpoint Charlie}}) is a private museum in [[Berlin]].  It is named after the [[Checkpoint Charlie|famous crossing point]] on the [[Berlin Wall]], and was created to document the so-called "best border security system in the world" (in the words of [[East Germany|East German]] general [[Heinz Hoffmann]]).  On display are the photos and related documents of successful escape attempts from [[East Germany]], together with the escape apparatus: hot-air balloons, getaway cars, chairlifts, and a mini-[[U-Boat]]. The museum researches and maintains a [[list of deaths at the Berlin Wall]]. It is operated by the ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August'' (August 13th Working Group), and the director is [[Alexandra Hildebrandt]].

==History==
The ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August'' is an [[Voluntary association|association]] named after the date the Berlin Wall was constructed. It was formed with the purpose to fight against human rights violations as a result of the wall, and to create solutions through activities such as press conferences, publishing, and exhibitions.&lt;ref name="FirmenWissen 2018"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.firmenwissen.de/az/firmeneintrag/10969/2010178455/ARBEITSGEMEINSCHAFT_13_AUGUST.html |title=Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August, Berlin - Firmenauskunft |website=FirmenWissen |access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum project began as an exhibition by founding director and human rights activist [[Rainer Hildebrandt]]. According to Hildebrandt: "The first exhibition opened on the 19 October 1962 in an apartment with only two and a half rooms in famous [[Bernauer Straße]]. The street was divided along its whole length; the buildings in the east had been vacated and their windows were bricked up. We suggested that tourists be thankful to those border guards who do not shoot to kill".&lt;ref name=odf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mauermuseum.de/english/frame-index-mauer.html |title=Origins - Development - Future |website=Mauermuseum - Museum Haus am Checkpoint Charlie |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924095303/http://www.mauermuseum.de/english/frame-index-mauer.html |archive-date=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14th June 1963, the museum opened in its permanent location on [[Friedrichstraße]], known as ''Haus am Checkpoint Charlie''.&lt;ref name=odf/&gt; The ''Arbeitsgemeinschaft 13. August e.

The '''Convention on the recognition of decisions recording a sex reassignment ({{Lang-fr|Convention relative à la reconnaissance des décisions constatant un changement de sexe}})''' is a multilateral convention, drafted by the [[International Commission on Civil Status]] which provides the acceptance in other countries of decisions by the authorities (courts or administrative divisions) on a [[sex change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciec1.org/SITECIEC/PAGE_Conventions/TAkAAFXGJwJUbHBrTE9OUXJFCAA|title=Convention on the recognition of decisions recording a sex change|publisher=[[International Commission on Civil Status]]|accessdate=10 February 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725171143/http://www.ciec1.org/Conventions/Conv29Angl.pdf|archivedate=25 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sex changes of [[nationality|nationals]] or residents are recognized in the other member states if the sex change has been performed physically (and is recorded as such). This is registered in a change of the [[birth certificate]].

== Member states and signatories ==

The '''Edict of Cyrus''' is part of the [[Hebrew Bible|biblical]] narrative about the [[Return to Zion|return from]] [[Babylonian captivity]]. The [[edict]] is thrice mentioned in the [[Hebrew Bible]], each time with minor textual variations and additions. It is presented as authorizing and encouraging the [[Jews]] exiled by [[Nebuchadnezzar II|Nebuchadnezzar]] to relocate to the [[Land of Israel]] and actively engage in rebuilding the [[Temple in Jerusalem|temple]] destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar. The historical background of the narrative is confirmed by archaeology, but the edict as such is not corroborated by any finds; its existence as one single legal act, rather than a general policy of repatriation, is contested.

==Historicity==
The [[Cyrus Cylinder]], an ancient clay cylinder on which is written a declaration in the name of [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]] referring to restoration of temples and repatriation of exiled peoples, has often been taken as corroboration of the authenticity of the biblical decrees attributed to Cyrus,&lt;ref name="Becking"&gt;
{{cite book |last=Becking |first=Bob |authorlink= |editor1-last=Lipschitz |editor1-first=Oded |editor2-last=Oeming |editor2-first=Manfred|chapter="We All Returned as One!": Critical Notes on the Myth of the Mass Return |title=Judah and the Judeans in the Persian Period |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1zi2i_C1aNkC&amp;pg=PA8#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Cyrus%20cylinder%22%20Jerusalem&amp;f=false |accessdate= |year=2006 |publisher=Eisenbrauns |location=Winona Lake, IN |page=8|isbn=978-1-57506-104-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; but other scholars point out that the cylinder's text is specific to Babylon and Mesopotamia and makes no mention of Judah or Jerusalem.
&lt;ref name="Becking"/&gt; Professor [[Lester L. Grabbe]] asserted that the "alleged decree of Cyrus" regarding Judah, "cannot be considered authentic", but that there was a "general policy of allowing deportees to return and to re-establish cult sites". He also stated that archaeology suggests that the return was a "trickle" taking place over decades, rather than a single event.&lt;ref name="Grabbe355"&gt;

==Biblical narrative==
===Initial edict===

The initial text (based on the view that the book of Ezra is a continuum of the text of [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]]) of Cyrus's edict:

{{quote|And in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, at the completion of the word of the Lord in the mouth of [[Jeremiah]], the Lord aroused the spirit of Cyrus the king of Persia, and he issued a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying:

So said Cyrus the king of Persia: All the kingdoms of the earth has the Lord God of the heavens delivered to me, and He commanded me to build Him a House in Jerusalem, which is in Judea. Who among you is of all His people, may the Lord his God be with him, and he may ascend.|[[Books of Chronicles|2 Chronicles]] 36:22-23}}

The second mentioning as found in the book of Ezra:

{{Quote|And in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, at the completion of the word of the Lord from the mouth of Jeremiah, the Lord aroused the Spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, and he spread a proclamation (lit. voice) throughout his kingdom, and also in writing, saying:

"So said Cyrus, the king of Persia; All the kingdoms of the earth gave to me, the Lord, God of heaven, and He commanded me to build Him a House in Jerusalem, which is in Judea. Whomever is amongst you of all His people, (may his) God be with him, and he should ascend to Jerusalem, which is in Judea. And he should build the House of the Lord, God of Israel -He is the God Who is in Jerusalem.. And whoever remains from all the places where he resides, they should promote him -the people of his residence- with silver and with gold and with possessions and with cattle, with the donation to the House of God, which is in Jerusalem.|Book of Ezra 1:1-4}}

===Challenged by Cuthim===

The book of Ezra relays how the people of [[Kutha|Cutha]], known in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as "Cuthim" and quoted as the "adversaries" of the returning exiles, initiated a request to join in the [[Second Temple]] construction, when rebuffed by [[Zerubbabel]] and his companions, they spitefully composed a letter of complaint to Artaxerxes of Persia:

{{quote|And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the dwellers of Judea and Jerusalem. Then Rehum the secretary and Shimshai the scribe and the rest of their companies, the [[Dinite]]s, the [[Apharesattechites]], the [[Tarpel]]ites, the [[Apharesites]], the [[Archevites]], the [[Babylonia]]ns, the [[Shushan]]chites, the [[Dehite]]s, the [[Elam]]ites.  And the rest of the nations whom the great and honored Asenappar exiled and settled in the cities of Samaria and the rest of the other side of the river and Ke'eneth. This is the meaning of the letter that they sent to him, to Artaxerxes the king: "Your servants are the people of the other side of the river and Ke'eneth. Let it be known to the king that the Jews who ascended from you upon us have come to Jerusalem, the rebellious and sinful city they are building, and the walls they have completed, and the walls they have joined. Now let it be known to the king that if this city is built and the walls are founded, they will not give the king's due, the head tax, or the meal tax they will not give, and the tax of the kings will suffer. Now, in view of this, that we wish to destroy the Temple, and it is improper for us to witness the king's disgrace, we have therefore sent and notified the king. That one should search in the annals of your fathers, and you will find in the annals, and you will know that this city is a rebellious city, and it injures kings and countries, and they have made rebellion in its midst since days of yore; because of this, this city was destroyed. We make known to the king that if this city is built, and its walls founded, because of this, you will have no part in the other side of the river.|Book of Ezra 4:6-16}}

The commentary work of [[Malbim|Rabbi Meïr Weiser]] (b. Mar. 7, 1809; d. [[Kiev]] Sept. 18, 1879) advances the notion that the party of Mithredath Tabeel took advantage of the document's translation protocol of Cyrus the Great's government. Essentially the protocol that each country of his kingdom was entitled to speak their unique language and pen texts to the king in their native tongue and have the presiding local officers of Artaxerxes of Persia translate the document.

Rabbi Weiser continues that Mithredath Tabeel presented a substantial bribe to Rehum the secretary and Shimshai the scribe, to compose a letter containing a plausible ambiguity while inciting that the post-exile temple builders have varied the kings edict by actively engaging in the construction and fortification of the walls of Jerusalem in an attempt to rebel against the foreign king's rule.

The ploy of Mithredath Tabeel and company was successful in leading to a 14-year cessation of all temple building activity in Jerusalem.

===Darius reconfirms edict===
Following a second letter sent by the Persian governor asking the king for a decision, the Edict is found in the archives and the king gives his orders accordingly.
{{quote|Then [[Darius I|King Darius]] gave an order, and they searched in the library in which the archives were stored in Babylon. And there was found in a pouch in the citadel of the province of Media one scroll, and so was written therein a memorandum:
In the first year of King Cyrus, King Cyrus gave an order regarding the House of God in Jerusalem, that the House should be built, a place where they offer up sacrifices, and its walls should be founded, its height sixty cubits and its width sixty cubits. Three rows of marble and a row of new wood, and the expenditures shall be given from the royal house.
5. And also the vessels of the House of God, of gold and silver, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the Temple that is in Jerusalem and brought to Babylon, let them be given over and brought to the Temple that is in Jerusalem to its place, and they shall be deposited in the House of God.
 
"Now Tattenai, the governor of the other side of the river, Shethar-Bozenai, and their companies, the Apharsechites, who are on the other side of the river, distance yourselves from there. Leave the work of this House of God; [to] the governors of the Jews, and [to] the elders of the Jews, [I command] this House of God they shall build in its place. And from me shall be issued an order regarding what you shall do with these elders of the Jews to build this House of God, and from the king's property from the taxes of the other side of the river [it shall] quickly [be built.] The expenses shall be given to these men so that they should not be disrupted. And what they require, and young bulls, and rams, and lambs for burnt offerings to the God of the heavens, wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the statement of the priests who are in Jerusalem, let it be given to them daily without delay. That they should offer up pleasing sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the lives of the king and his children.
 
And an order is issued by me that whatever person disobeys this order, a beam shall be torn from his house, and a gallows [shall be made], upon which to place him, and his house shall be made a dung heap because of this. And God, Who caused His name to rest there, will cast down any king or people that lays a hand to alter and destroy this House of God, which is in Jerusalem; I, Darius, have issued an edict; it shall be swiftly executed."|Book of Ezra 6:1-12}}

The '''Democratic Socialist Party''' ({{lang-ar|'''الحزب الديموقراطي الاشتراكي'''}}) ({{lang-fr|Parti Socialiste Démocratique}}) is a [[political party]] in [[Morocco]].

==History and profile==
The party was founded in 1996&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organizations|url=http://www.maroc.ma/en/content/organisations|publisher=Maroc|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a split from the [[Organisation de l'Action Démocratique Populaire]]  over the constitutional referendum held in September 1996.

In the [[Moroccan parliamentary election, 2002|parliamentary election]] held on 27 September 2002, the party won 6 out of 325 seats. In the next [[Moroccan parliamentary election, 2007|parliamentary election]], held on 7 September 2007, the party did not win any seats, as it merged with the USFP in 2005.

'''Ethyl pentanoate''', also commonly known as ethyl valerate, is an [[organic compound]] used in flavors.  It is an [[ester]] with the molecular formula C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  This colorless liquid is poorly soluble in water but [[miscible]] with organic solvents.

As is the case with most volatile esters, it has a pleasant aroma and taste.  It is used as a [[food additive]] to impart a fruity flavor, particularly of apple.

'''Focal socialisation agency''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29|or]] '''focal socialization agency''') in [[sociology]] is the name given to the [[Agency (sociology)|agency]] which is most influential in process of [[socialisation]] upon an individual. Typically the first focal socialisation agency is the [[Sociology of the family|family]] but is usually succeeded in this role by the [[sociology of education|education system]] upon the entering of education.

Hardware backdoors are intended to undermine security in [[smartcard]]s and other [[cryptoprocessor]]s unless investment is made in anti-backdoor design methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1 = Waksman | first1 = Adam | title = Tamper Evident Microprocessors | volume = | pages = | periodical = Proceedings of the IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy | location = Oakland, California | url = http://www.cs.columbia.edu/~waksman/PDFs/Oakland_2010.pdf | year = 2010 | issn = | doi = | isbn = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have also been considered for [[car hacking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Craig|title=The Car Hacker's Handbook: A Guide for the Penetration Tester|publisher=No Starch Press|isbn=9781593277031|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ao_QCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA95|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Severity==
Hardware backdoors are considered highly problematic because:&lt;ref name=ExtremeTech1/&gt;
# They can’t be removed by conventional means such as [[antivirus software]]
# They can circumvent other types of security such as [[disk encryption]]
# They can be injected at manufacturing time where the user has no degree of control

* In 2012 two mobile phones developed by Chinese device manufacturer ZTE have been found to carry a backdoor to instantly gain root access via a password that has been hard-coded into the software.

* Documents revealed during [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|the surveillance disclosures]] initiated by [[Edward Snowden]] showed that the [[Tailored Access Operations]] (TAO) unit and other NSA employees intercepted servers, routers, and other network gear being shipped to organizations targeted for surveillance to install covert implant firmware onto them before delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photos of an NSA "upgrade" factory show Cisco router getting implant|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/05/photos-of-an-nsa-upgrade-factory-show-cisco-router-getting-implant/|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSA's Secret Toolbox: Unit Offers Spy Gadgets for Every Need|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/nsa-secret-toolbox-ant-unit-offers-spy-gadgets-for-every-need-a-941006.html|publisher=SPIEGEL ONLINE|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tools include custom BIOS exploits that survive the reinstallation of operating systems and USB cables with spy hardware and radio transceiver packed inside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Your USB cable, the spy: Inside the NSA’s catalog of surveillance magic|url=https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/12/inside-the-nsas-leaked-catalog-of-surveillance-magic/|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2016 it was reported that [[University of Michigan]] Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science built a hardware backdoor that leverages "analog circuits to create a hardware attack" so that after the capacitors store up enough electricity to be fully charged, it would be switched on, to give an attacker complete access to whatever system or device − such as a PC − that contains the backdoored chip. In the study that won  the "best paper" award at the IEEE Symposium on Privacy and Security they also note that microscopic hardware backdoor wouldn't be caught by practically any modern method of hardware security analysis, and could be planted by a single employee of a chip factory&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greenberg|first1=Andy|title=This ‘Demonically Clever’ Backdoor Hides In a Tiny Slice of a Computer Chip|url=https://www.wired.com/2016/06/demonically-clever-backdoor-hides-inside-computer-chip/|publisher=WIRED|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Storm|first1=Darlene|title=Researchers built devious, undetectable hardware-level backdoor in computer chips|url=http://www.computerworld.com/article/3079417/security/researchers-built-devious-undetectable-hardware-level-backdoor-in-computer-chips.html|publisher=Computerworld|accessdate=22 January 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In September 2016 Skorobogatov showed how he had removed a NAND chip from an [[iPhone 5C]] - the main memory storage system used on many Apple devices - and cloned it so that he can try out more incorrect combinations than allowed by the attempt-counter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hardware hack defeats iPhone passcode security|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-37407047|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 January 2017|date=19 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}}16 July 1953) was an [[English people|Anglo]]-[[French people|French]] writer and historian. He was one of the most prolific writers in England during the early twentieth century. He was known as a writer, orator, poet, sailor, satirist, man of letters, soldier and political activist. His [[Catholic faith]] had a strong impact on his works. He was President of the [[Oxford Union]] and later [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for Salford from 1906 to 1910. He was a noted disputant, with a number of long-running feuds, but also widely regarded as a humane and sympathetic man. Belloc became a [[naturalised]] British subject in 1902, while retaining his French citizenship.

His poetry encompassed comic verses for children and religious poetry. His widely sold ''[[Cautionary Tales for Children]]'' included "Jim, who ran away from his nurse, and was eaten by a lion" and "Matilda, who told lies and was burnt to death".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetry-archive.com/b/matilda.html "Matilda,"] 1907, in the ''Poetry Archive''.&lt;/ref&gt; He also collaborated with [[G.

== Family and career ==
[[File:Hilaire Belloc Portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Hilaire Belloc portrait, c. 1903]]

Belloc was born in [[La Celle-Saint-Cloud]], France to a French father, Louis Belloc (1830-1872) and an English mother. His sister [[Marie Adelaide Belloc Lowndes]] also grew up to be a writer.

His mother [[Bessie Rayner Parkes]] (1829–1925) was a writer, activist, and a major force in efforts to gain greater equality for women, being a co-founder of the ''[[English Woman's Journal]]'' and the [[Langham Place Group]]. Belloc himself campaigned against women's suffrage; he was a member of the [[Women's National Anti-Suffrage League]]. Her father was [[Joseph Parkes]] (1796–1865), a prosperous solicitor and a liberal with [[Radicalism (historical)|Radical]] sympathies. Her mother, Elizabeth Rayner Priestley (1797–1877), was born in the United States, a granddaughter of the polymath [[Joseph Priestley]].  In 1867, Bessie married attorney Louis Belloc, son of the French painter [[Jean-Hilaire Belloc]]. In 1872, five years after they wed, Louis died, but not before being wiped out financially in a stock market crash. The young widow then brought her children back to England.

Hilaire Belloc grew up in England, and would spend most of his life there. His boyhood was spent in [[Slindon]], West Sussex, for which he often felt homesick in later life, as evidenced in poems such as "West Sussex Drinking Song", "The South Country", and even the more melancholy, "Ha'nacker Mill". After being educated at [[John Henry Newman]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Brickel, Alfred G. [https://archive.org/stream/americancatholic47philuoft#page/154/mode/2up "Hilaire Belloc and Cardinal Newman,"] ''The American Catholic Quarterly Review,'' Vol. XLVII, N°.185, 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Oratory School|Oratory School]] in [[Edgbaston]], Birmingham, Belloc served his term of [[military service]], as a French citizen, with an artillery regiment near [[Toul]] in 1891. Belloc proceeded to [[Balliol College, Oxford]], as a history scholar. He went on to obtain [[first-class honours]], and never lost his love for Balliol, as is illustrated by his verse, "Balliol made me, Balliol fed me/ Whatever I had she gave me again".

He was powerfully built, with great stamina, and walked extensively in Britain and Europe. While courting his future wife Elodie Hogan (1868–1914), an American whom he first met in 1890, the impecunious Belloc walked a good part of the way from the [[Midwestern United States|midwest of the United States]] to her home in [[northern California]], "paying" for lodging at remote farm houses and ranches by sketching the owners and reciting poetry. The couple married in 1896.

In 1906, he purchased land and a house called King's Land at [[Shipley, West Sussex]], where he brought up his family and lived until shortly before his death. Elodie and Belloc had five children before her 1914 death from [[influenza]]. After her death, Belloc wore mourning for the remainder of his life, keeping her room exactly as she had left it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Point'' (August 1958).&lt;/ref&gt;

His son Louis was killed in 1918 while serving in the [[Royal Flying Corps]] in northern France. Belloc placed a memorial tablet at the nearby [[Cambrai Cathedral]]. It is in the same side chapel as the noted [[icon]] Our Lady of Cambrai.

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] his son Peter Gilbert Marie Sebastian Belloc died at age 36 of [[pneumonia]] on 2 April 1941. He fell ill while on active service with the 5th Battalion of the [[Royal Marines]] in [[Scotland]]. He is buried in [[West Grinstead]] at Our Lady of Consolation and St. Francis churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cwgc.org/find-war-dead/casualty/2723988/belloc,-peter-gilbert-marie-sebastian/|title=Casualty Record – Peter Gilbert Marie Sebastian Belloc|last=|first=|date=|website=Commonwealth War Graves Commission|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=THE LIFE OF HILAIRE BELLOC|last=SPEAIGHT|first=ROBERT|publisher=FARRAR, STRAUS &amp; CUDAHY|year=1957|isbn=|location=NEW YORK|pages=522}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/lifeofhilairebel00spea/lifeofhilairebel00spea_djvu.txt|title=THE LIFE OF HILAIRE BELLOC|last=|first=|date=|website=Archive.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, Belloc was invited to be a visiting professor at [[Fordham University]] by university president Robert Gannon. Belloc delivered a series of lectures at Fordham which he completed in May of that year. While pleased to accept the invitation, the experience left him physically exhausted and he considered stopping the lectures early.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/5332/New_history_describes_founding_rise_and_secularization_of_Fordham_University.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/%E2%80%98-catholic-room&lt;/ref&gt;

Belloc suffered a [[stroke]] in 1941 and never recovered from its effects. He died on 16 July 1953 at Mount Alvernia Nursing Home in  Guildford, Surrey, from burns and shock following a fall he had while placing a log into a fireplace at King's Land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Volume 5|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=30|isbn=0-19-861355-5}}Article by Bernard Berganzi.&lt;/ref&gt; He is buried at the [[Shrine Church of Our Lady of Consolation and St Francis|Shrine of Our Lady of Consolation]] of [[West Grinstead]], where he had regularly attended Mass as a parishioner.
&lt;ref&gt;His estate was [[probate]]d at [[pound sterling|£]]7,451.&lt;/ref&gt; At his funeral Mass, homilist Monsignor [[Ronald Knox]] observed, "No man of his time fought so hard for the good things."  Boys from the Choir and Sacristy of Worth Preparatory School sang and served at the Mass.

Recent biographies of Belloc have been written by [[A. N. Wilson]] and [[Joseph Pearce]], and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] political philosopher [[James V. Schall|James Schall]]'s ''Remembering Belloc'' was published by St. Augustine Press in September 2013.

===Political career===
An 1895 graduate of [[Balliol College, Oxford]], Belloc was a noted figure within the University, being [[President of the Oxford Union]], the undergraduate debating society. He went into politics after he became a naturalised British subject. A great disappointment in his life was his failure to gain a [[fellow]]ship of [[All Souls College]], Oxford in 1895. This failure may have been caused in part by his producing a small statue of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary|Virgin]] and placing it before him on the table during the interview for the fellowship.

From 1906 to 1910 he was a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] Member of Parliament for [[Salford South (UK Parliament constituency)|Salford South]]. During one campaign speech he was asked by a heckler if he was a "papist." Retrieving his rosary from his pocket he responded, "Sir, so far as possible I hear Mass each day and I go to my knees and tell these beads each night. If that offends you, then I pray God may spare me the indignity of representing you in Parliament." The crowd cheered and Belloc won the election.

His only period of steady employment was from 1914 to 1920 as editor of ''[[Land and Water]]'', a journal devoted to the progress of the war. Otherwise he lived by his writing and was often impecunious.

===In controversy and debate===

Belloc first came to public attention shortly after arriving at Balliol College, Oxford as a recent French army veteran. Attending his first debate of the [[Oxford Union]] Debating Society, he saw that the affirmative position was wretchedly and half-heartedly defended. As the debate drew to its conclusion and the division of the house was called, he rose from his seat in the audience, and delivered a vigorous, impromptu defence of the proposition. Belloc won that debate from the audience, as the division of the house then showed, and his reputation as a debater was established. He was later elected president of the Union. He held his own in debates there with [[F. E. Smith]] and [[John Buchan]], the latter a friend.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]], who was a contemporary at Oxford, described his "...resonant, deep pitched voice..." as making an "...unforgettable impression".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francis West, ''Gilbert Murray'', p. 107, describes [[Gilbert Murray|Murray]]'s impression on an occasion in 1899: ''In July [...] [Murray] attended a meeting on the principles of Liberalism, at which Hilaire Belloc spoke brilliantly although Murray could not afterwards remember a word that he had said.''&lt;/ref&gt;

He was at his most effective in the 1920s, on the attack against [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The Outline of History]]'', in which he criticised Wells' secular bias and his belief in [[evolution by means of natural selection]], a theory that Belloc asserted had been completely discredited. Wells remarked that "Debating Mr. Belloc is like arguing with a hailstorm". Belloc's review of ''Outline of History'' famously observed that Wells' book was a powerful and well-written volume, "up until the appearance of Man, that is, somewhere around page seven." Wells responded with a small book, ''Mr. Belloc Objects''.&lt;ref&gt;Wells, H. G., ''Mr. Belloc Objects, to the Outline of History'', Watts &amp; Company, London, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; Not to be outdone, Belloc followed with, "Mr. Belloc Still Objects."

[[G. G. Coulton]], a keen and persistent opponent, wrote on ''Mr. Belloc on Medieval History'' in a 1920 article. After a long simmering feud, Belloc replied with a booklet, ''The Case of Dr. Coulton'', in 1938.

His style during later life fulfilled the nickname he received in childhood, ''Old Thunder''. Belloc's friend, [[Arthur Stanley, 5th Baron Sheffield|Lord Sheffield]], described his provocative personality in a preface to ''The Cruise of the Nona.''&lt;ref&gt;''Time and again I have seen him throw out a sufficiently outrageous theory in order to stimulate his company, and, be it said, for the pleasure of seeing how slowly he might be dislodged from a position he had purposely taken up knowing it to be untenable.... Of course Belloc was prejudiced, but there were few who knew him who did not love his prejudices, who did not love to hear him fight for them, and who did not honor him for the sincerity and passion with which he held to them. Once the battle was joined all his armoury was marshalled and flung into the fray. Dialectic, Scorn, Quip, Epigram, Sarcasm, Historical Evidence, Massive Argument, and Moral Teaching --of all these weapons he was a past master and each was mobilised and made to play its proper part in the attack. Yet he was a courteous and a chivalrous man. A deeply sensitive man, his was the kindest and most understanding nature I have ever known. In spite of a rollicking and bombastic side he was as incapable of the least cruelty as he was capable of the most delicate sympathy with other people's feelings. As he himself used to say of others in a curiously quiet and simple way, "He is a good man. He will go to Heaven."''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hobbies===
During his later years, he would sail when he could afford to do so and became a well-known yachtsman. He won many races and was on the French sailing team. In the early 1930s, he was given an old Jersey pilot [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]], called ''Jersey''. He sailed this for some years around the coasts of England, with the help of younger men. One of them, Dermod MacCarthy, wrote a book about his time on the water with Belloc, called ''Sailing with Mr Belloc''.&lt;ref&gt;Sailing with Mr Belloc by Dermod MacCarthy : Vintage/Ebury (A Division of Random House Group), 20 October 1986 (reprint) : {{ISBN|9780002727754}} / 0002727757&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writing ==
{{see also|Hilaire Belloc bibliography}}

The prolific author of more than 150 books,&lt;ref&gt;Michael H. Markel, ''Hilaire Belloc'', Twayne Publishers (1975), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Perkins, ''A History of Modern Poetry: From the 1890s to the High Modernist Mode'', Harvard University Press (1976), p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; Belloc wrote on myriad subjects, from warfare to poetry to the many current topics of his day. He has been called one of the Big Four of Edwardian Letters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poetryarchive/singlePoet.do?poetId=7490 |title=Hilaire Belloc |website=Poetryarchive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with [[H.G.Wells]], [[George Bernard Shaw]], and [[G. K. Chesterton]], all of whom debated with each other into the 1930s. Belloc was closely associated with Chesterton, and Shaw coined the term '''''Chesterbelloc''''' for their partnership. He was co-editor with [[Cecil Chesterton]] of the literary periodical the ''Eye Witness'', published until 1912 by [[Charles Granville]]'s Stephen Swift Ltd. The paper was later called the ''New Witness'', and still later, ''[[G. K.'s Weekly]]''.

Asked once why he wrote so much,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Hilaire Belloc's books]] for a chronological list of work by Belloc&lt;/ref&gt; he responded, "Because my children are howling for pearls and caviar." Belloc observed that "The first job of letters is to get a canon," that is, to identify those works a writer sees as exemplary of the best of prose and verse. For his own prose style, he claimed to aspire to be as clear and concise as "[[Mary had a little lamb]]."

===Essays and travel writing===

His best travel writing has secured a permanent following. ''The Path to Rome'' (1902), an account of a walking pilgrimage he made from central France across the Alps and down to Rome, has remained continuously in print. More than a mere travelogue, ''The Path to Rome'' contains descriptions of the people and places he encountered, his drawings in pencil and in ink of the route, humour, poesy, and the reflections of a large mind turned to the events of his time as he marches along his solitary way. His book ''The [[Pyrenees]]'', published in 1909, shows a depth of detailed knowledge of that region such as would only be gained from personal experience. At every turn, Belloc shows himself to be profoundly in love with Europe and with the Faith that he claims has produced it.

As an essayist he was one of a small, admired and dominant group (with Chesterton, [[E. V. Lucas]] and [[Robert Wilson Lynd|Robert Lynd]]) of popular writers.

===Poetry===
[[File:CautionaryTales-Belloc-Blackwell-cover.jpg|thumb|Original cover for ''Cautionary Tales for Children'', illustrated by Basil T. Blackwood]]
His ''[[Cautionary Tales for Children]]''; humorous poems with an implausible moral, illustrated by [[Basil Temple Blackwood]] (signing as "B.T.B.") and later by [[Edward Gorey]], are the most widely known of his writings.&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, James. [http://www.crisismagazine.com/2012/hilaire-belloc-cautionary-tales-and-bad-childs-book-of-beasts "Hilaire Belloc, Cautionary Tales and Bad Child’s Book of Beasts,"] ''Crisis Magazine,'' 29 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Supposedly for children, they, like [[Lewis Carroll]]'s works, are more to adult and satirical tastes: "Henry King, Who chewed bits of string and was early cut off in dreadful agonies".&lt;ref&gt;''The Chief Defect of Henry King''
:''Was chewing little bits of String.''
:''At last he swallowed some which tied''
:''Itself in ugly Knots inside.''
:''Physicians of the Utmost Fame''
:''Were called at once; but when they came''
:''They answered, as they took their Fees,''
:''"There is no Cure for this Disease.''
:''Henry will very soon be dead."''
:''His Parents stood about his Bed''
:''Lamenting his Untimely Death,''
:''When Henry, with his Latest Breath,''
:''Cried – "Oh, my Friends, be warned by me,''
:''That Breakfast, Dinner, Lunch and Tea''
:''Are all the Human Frame Requires..."''
:''With that the Wretched Child expires.''&lt;/ref&gt; A similar poem tells the story of "Rebecca, who slammed doors for fun and perished miserably".

The tale of "Matilda who told lies and was burnt to death" was adapted into the play ''Matilda Liar!'' by [[Debbie Isitt]]. [[Quentin Blake]], the illustrator, described Belloc as at one and the same time the overbearing adult and mischievous child. [[Roald Dahl]] was a follower. But Belloc has broader if sourer scope. For example, with Lord Lundy (who was "far too freely moved to Tears"):

:''It happened to Lord Lundy then''
:''as happens to so many men''
:''about the age of 26''
:''they shoved him into politics ...''

leading up to

:''"we had intended you to be''
:''the next Prime Minister but three...''

instead, Lundy is condemned to the ultimate political wilderness:

:''...The stocks were sold; the Press was squared:''
:''The Middle Class was quite prepared.''
:''But as it is! . . . My language fails!''
:''Go out and govern New South Wales!"''

:''The Aged Patriot groaned and died:''
:''And gracious! how Lord Lundy cried!''

Of more weight are Belloc's ''Sonnets and Verses'', a volume that deploys the same singing and rhyming techniques of his children's verses. Belloc's poetry is often religious, often romantic; throughout ''The Path to Rome'' he writes in spontaneous song.

===History, politics, economics===
[[File:Portrait of Hilaire Belloc.jpg|thumb|Hilaire Belloc portrait by Emil Otto Hoppé, 1915]]
Three of his best-known non-fiction works are ''[[The Servile State]]'' (1912), ''Europe and Faith'' (1920) and ''The Jews'' (1922).

From an early age Belloc knew Cardinal [[Henry Edward Manning]], who was responsible for the conversion of his mother to Roman Catholicism.  In ''The Cruise of the "Nona"'' (1925), he mentions a "profound thing" that Manning said to him when he was just twenty years old: "''All human conflict is ultimately theological.''" What Manning meant, Belloc explains, is "that all wars and revolutions, and all decisive struggles between parties of men arise from a difference in moral and transcendental doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;''The Cruise of the "Nona"''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1958, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Belloc adds that he never met any man, "arguing for what should be among men, but took for granted as he argued that the doctrine he consciously or unconsciously accepted was or should be a similar foundation for all mankind. Hence battle."&lt;ref&gt;''The Cruise of the "Nona"''. Harmondsworth: Penguin, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Manning's involvement in the 1889 [[London Dock Strike of 1889|London Dock Strike]] made a major impression on Belloc and his view of politics, according to biographer [[Robert Speaight]]. He became a trenchant critic both of capitalism&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Williams]], ''Culture and Society'', p. 186: ''Belloc's argument is that capitalism as a system is breaking down, and that this is to be welcomed. A society in which a minority owns and controls the means of production, while the majority are reduced to proletarian status, is not only wrong but unstable. Belloc sees it breaking down in two ways – on the one hand into State action for welfare (which pure capitalism cannot embody); on the other hand into monopoly and the restraint of trade. There are only two alternatives to this system: socialism, which Belloc calls collectivism; and the redistribution of property on a significant scale, which Belloc calls distributivism.''&lt;/ref&gt; and of many aspects of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/socialismservile00bell#page/n1/mode/2up ''Socialism and the Servile State: A Debate between Hilaire Belloc and J. Ramsay MacDonald,''] South West London Federation of the Independent Labour, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

With others ([[G. K. Chesterton]], [[Cecil Chesterton]], [[Arthur Penty]]) Belloc had envisioned the socioeconomic system of [[distributism]]. In ''The Servile State'', written after his party-political career had come to an end, and other works, he criticised the modern economic order and parliamentary system, advocating distributism in opposition to both capitalism and socialism. Belloc made the historical argument that distributism was not a fresh perspective or program of economics but rather a proposed return to the economics that prevailed in Europe for the thousand years when it was Catholic. He called for the dissolution of Parliament and its replacement with committees of representatives for the various sectors of society, an idea that was also popular among Fascists, under the name of [[corporatism]].

With these linked themes in the background, he wrote a long series of contentious biographies of historical figures, including [[Oliver Cromwell]], [[James II of England|James II]], and [[Napoleon]]. They show him as an ardent proponent of orthodox Catholicism and a critic of many elements of the modern world.

Outside academe, Belloc was impatient with what he considered axe-grinding histories, especially what he called "official history."&lt;ref&gt;''There is an enormous book called volume 1 of A Cambridge History of the Middle Ages. It is 759 pages in length of close print.... It does not mention the Mass once. That is as though you were to write a history of the Jewish dispersion without mentioning the synagogue or of the British empire without mentioning the city of London or the Navy'' (''Letters from Hilaire Belloc'', Hollis and Carter, 75).&lt;/ref&gt; Joseph Pearce notes also Belloc's attack on the [[secularism]] of H. G. Wells's popular ''[[Outline of History]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''Belloc objected to his adversary's tacitly anti-Christian stance, epitomized by the fact that Wells had devoted more space in his "history" to the Persian campaign against the Greeks than he had given to the figure of Christ.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He wrote also substantial amounts of military history. In [[alternate history (fiction)|alternative history]], he contributed to the 1931 collection ''[[If It Had Happened Otherwise]]'' edited by [[Sir John Squire]].

==Religion==
[[File:Belloc side.jpg|thumb|left|Hilaire Belloc portrait, 1910]]
One of Belloc's most famous statements was "the faith is Europe and Europe is the faith";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/europeandfaith01bellgoog |title=Europe and the Faith ... : Hilaire Belloc : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; this sums up his strongly held, orthodox [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] views, and the cultural conclusions he drew from them. Those views were expressed at length in many of his works from the period 1920–40. These are still cited as exemplary of Catholic [[apologetics]]. They have also been criticised, for instance by comparison with the work of [[Christopher Dawson]] during the same period.

As a young man, Belloc lost his faith. Then came a spiritual event, which he never discussed publicly, that returned him to Catholicism for the remainder of his life.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Belloc alludes to this return to the faith in a passage in ''The Cruise of the Nona''. According to his biographer A. N. Wilson (''Hilaire Belloc'', Hamish Hamilton), Belloc never wholly apostatised from the Faith (ibid p.&amp;nbsp;105). The momentous event is fully described by Belloc in ''The Path to Rome'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;158–61). It took place in the French village of [[Undervelier]] at the time of Vespers.  Belloc said of it, "not without tears", "I considered the nature of Belief" and "it is a good thing not to have to return to the faith". (See ''Hilaire Belloc'' by Wilson at pp.&amp;nbsp;105–06.)

Belloc's Catholicism was uncompromising. He believed that the Catholic Church provided hearth and home for the human spirit.&lt;ref&gt;A.N. Wilson's Introduction to Belloc's ''Complete Verse'', Pimlico, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; More humorously, his tribute to Catholic culture can be understood from his well-known saying, "Wherever the Catholic sun does shine, there's always laughter and good red wine." He had a disparaging view of the [[Church of England]], and used sharp words to describe heretics, such as, "Heretics all, whoever you may be/ In Tarbes or Nimes or over the sea/ You never shall have good words from me/ Caritas non-conturbat me". Indeed, in his "Song of the [[Pelagian]] Heresy" he becomes quite strident, describing how the Bishop of [[Auxerre]], "with his stout Episcopal staff/ So thoroughly thwacked and banged/ The heretics all, both short and tall/ They rather had been hanged".

Belloc sent his son Louis to [[Downside School]] 1911–1915. Louis's biography and death in August 1918 is recorded in "Downside and the War".

===On Islam===
Belloc's 1937 book ''The Crusades: the World's Debate'',  he wrote, {{quote|The story must not be neglected by any modern, who may think in error that the East has finally fallen before the West, that Islam is now enslaved — to our political and economic power at any rate if not to our philosophy. It is not so. Islam essentially survives, and Islam would not have survived had the Crusade made good its hold upon the essential point of Damascus. Islam survives. Its religion is intact; therefore its material strength may return. ''Our'' religion is in peril, and who can be confident in the continued skill, let alone the continued obedience, of those who make and work our machines?&amp;nbsp;... There is with us a complete chaos in religious doctrine.... We worship ourselves, we worship the nation; or we worship (some few of us) a particular economic arrangement believed to be the satisfaction of social justice.... Islam has not suffered this spiritual decline; and in the contrast between [our religious chaos and Islam's] religious certitudes still strong throughout the Mohammedan world lies our peril.&lt;ref&gt;''The Crusades: the World's Debate,'' Bruce Publishing Company, 1937, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''The Great Heresies'' (1938), Belloc argues that although "That [[Mohammedan]] culture happens to have fallen back in material applications; there is no reason whatever why it should not learn its new lesson and become our equal in all those temporal things which now ''alone'' give us our superiority over it—whereas in ''Faith'' we have fallen inferior to it."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/HERESY4.TXT  ''The Great Heresies'', Ch. 4], "The Great and Enduring Heresy of Mohammed."&lt;/ref&gt;

Belloc continued:

{{quote|It has always seemed to me possible, and even probable, that there would be a resurrection of Islam and that our sons or our grandsons would see the renewal of that tremendous struggle between the Christian culture and what has been for more than a thousand years its greatest opponent.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000817183410/http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/HERESY4.TXT]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

"There is no reason why its recent inferiority in mechanical construction, whether military or civilian, should continue indefinitely.  Even a slight accession of material power would make the further control of Islam by an alien culture difficult.  A little more and there will cease that which our time has taken for granted, the physical domination of Islam by the disintegrated Christendom we know."

At the time of his writing, the Islamic world was still largely under the rule of the European colonial powers and the threat to Britain was from Fascism and [[Nazism]]. Belloc, however, considered that Islam was permanently intent on destroying the Christian faith, as well as the West, which Christendom had built. In ''The Great Heresies'', Belloc grouped the [[Protestant Reformation]] together with Islam as one of the major heresies threatening the "[[Catholic Church|Universal Church]]".

===Accusations of antisemitism===
:''For fuller discussion, see section in [[G. K.'s Weekly]]''

Belloc's attitude towards Judaism has been a subject of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetablet.co.uk/article/3280 Ian Boyd, "Hilaire Belloc: the myth and the man", ''The Tablet'', 12 July 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

Belloc took a leading role in denouncing the [[Marconi scandal]] of 1912, in which government ministers were caught [[insider trading]]. Belloc emphasized that key players in both the government and the Marconi corporation had been Jewish. Jewish historian Todd Edelman identifies Catholic writers as central critics. In his opinion:&lt;blockquote&gt;The most virulent attacks in the Marconi affair were launched by Hilaire Belloc and the brothers Cecil and [[G.K. Chesterton]], whose hostility to Jews was linked to their opposition to liberalism, their backward-looking Catholicism, and the nostalgia for a medieval Catholic Europe that they imagined was ordered, harmonious, and homogeneous. The Jew baiting at the time of the Boer War and the Marconi scandal was linked to a broader protest, mounted in the main by the Radical wing of the Liberal Party, against the growing visibility of successful businessmen in national life and their challenges to what were seen as traditional English values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Todd M. Endelman|title=The Jews of Britain, 1656 to 2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SMOQkrUtqkwC&amp;pg=PR9|year=2002|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;A. N. Wilson's biography expresses the belief that Belloc tended to allude to Jews negatively in conversation, sometimes obsessively. [[Anthony Powell]] mentions in his review of that biography that in his view Belloc was thoroughly antisemitic, at all but a personal level.

From his days in politics onwards, Belloc repeatedly demonstrated a belief that Jewish people had significant control over society and the world of finance. In ''The Cruise of the Nona'', Belloc reflected equivocally on the [[Dreyfus Affair]] after thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;''I, for my part, pretend to no certain conclusion in the matter… Of my own intimate acquaintance who were on the spot [at Dreyfus' trial] and competent to judge, most were for the innocence of Dreyfus: but the rest, fully competent also, were and are, convinced of his guilt… There are in England to-day two Englishmen whose wide knowledge of Europe and especially of Paris, and the French tongue and society, enable them to judge. They are both close friends of mine. One is for, the other against… I believe that, when the passions have died down, the Dreyfus case will remain for history very much what the Diamond Necklace has remained, or the [[Tichborne case]]; that is, there will be a popular legend, intellectually worth nothing; and, for the historian, the task of criticising that legend, but hardly of solving the problem.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Rose]]'s book ''The [[Cliveden Set]]'' (2000) asserts that Belloc 'was moved by a deep vein of hysterical anti-semitism'.

In his 1922 book, ''The Jews'', Belloc argued that "the continued presence of the Jewish nation intermixed with other nations alien to it presents a permanent problem of the gravest character," and that the "Catholic Church is the conservator of an age-long European tradition, and that tradition will never compromise with the fiction that a Jew can be other than a Jew. Wherever the Catholic Church has power, and in proportion to its power, the Jewish problem will be recognized to the full."&lt;ref&gt;Belloc, Hilaire, The Jews, London: Constable, 1922, 3–5, 209–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Speaight]] cited a letter by Belloc in which he pilloried [[Nesta Webster]] because of her accusations against "the Jews". In February 1924, Belloc wrote to an American Jewish friend regarding an antisemitic book by Webster. Webster had rejected Christianity, studied [[Eastern religions]], accepted the [[Hindu]] concept of the equality of all religions and was fascinated by theories of [[reincarnation]] and ancestral memory.&lt;ref&gt;Nesta Webster, ''Spacious Days'', London and [[Bombay]], 1950, pp. 103 and 172–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|In my opinion it is a lunatic book. She is one of those people who have got one cause on the brain. It is the good old 'Jewish revolutionary' bogey. But there is a type of unstable mind which cannot rest without morbid imaginings, and the conception of a single cause simplifies thought. With this good woman it is the [[Jews]], with some people it is the [[Jesuits]], with others [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]] and so on. The world is more complex than that. R. Speaight, ''[https://archive.org/details/lifeofhilairebel009626mbp The Life Of Hilaire Belloc]'', 1957, pp. 456–8.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaight also points out that when faced with antisemitism in practice—as at elitist country clubs in the United States before World War II—he voiced his disapproval. Belloc also condemned Nazi antisemitism in ''The Catholic and the War'' (1940).&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|The Third Reich has treated its Jewish subjects with a contempt for Justice which even if there had been no other action of the kind in other departments would be a sufficient warranty for determining its elimination from Europe.... Cruelty to a Jew is as odious as cruelty to any human being, whether that cruelty be moral in the form of insult, or physical.... You may hear men saying on every side, 'However, there is one thing I do agree with and that is the way they (The Nazis) have settled the Jews'. Now that attitude is directly immoral. The more danger there is that it will grow the more necessity there is for denouncing it. The action of the enemy toward the Jewish race has been in morals intolerable. Contracts have been broken on all sides, careers destroyed by the hundred and the thousand, individuals have been treated with the most hideous and disgusting cruelty.... If no price is paid for such excesses, our civilisation will certainly suffer and suffer permanently. If the men who have committed them go unpunished (and only defeat in war can punish them) then the decline of Europe, already advanced, will proceed to catastrophe. (pp. 29ff.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sussex==
Belloc grew up in Slindon and spent most of his life in West Sussex. He always wrote of Sussex as if it were the crown of England and the western [[Sussex Downs]] the jewel in that crown.&lt;ref name="Sx"&gt;{{cite book|last= Brandon|first=Peter|title=Sussex|publisher=Phillimore &amp; Co Ltd|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7090-6998-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He loved Sussex to the point of idolatry as the place where he was brought up and as his spiritual home.&lt;ref name="Sx"/&gt; Belloc wrote several works about Sussex including ''Ha'nacker Mill'', ''The South Country'', the travel guide ''Sussex'' (1906) and ''The County of Sussex'' (1936). One of his best-known works relating to Sussex is ''[[The Four Men: a Farrago]]'' (1911), in which the four characters, each aspects of Belloc's personality,&lt;ref name="BapByBeer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/ae/books/review.php?id=44663&amp;page=1|title=Baptism by Beer: Hilaire Belloc's The Four Men: A Farrago|publisher=Catholic Online|accessdate=29 March 2012}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CRdr-FourMen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acommonreader.org/the-four-men-hilaire-belloc/|title=Review: The Four Men – Hilaire Belloc|publisher=A Common Reader|accessdate=29 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530173710/http://acommonreader.org/the-four-men-hilaire-belloc/|archivedate=30 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; travel on a pilgrimage across the county from [[Robertsbridge]] in the far east to [[Harting]] in the far west.&lt;ref name="CRdr-FourMen"/&gt; The work has influenced others including Sussex folk musician [[Bob Copper]], who retraced Belloc's steps in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="CRdr-FourMen"/&gt; Belloc was also a lover of [[Music of Sussex|Sussex songs]]&lt;ref name="SxPeople"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hare|first=Chris|title=A History of the Sussex People|publisher=Southern Heritage Books|location=Worthing|year=1995|isbn=978-0-9527097-0-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote lyrics for some songs which have since been put to music.&lt;ref name="SxPeople"/&gt; Belloc is remembered in an annual celebration in Sussex, known as Belloc Night, that takes place on the writer's birthday, 27 July, in the manner of [[Burns Night]] in Scotland.&lt;ref name="WtgDnlanders"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worthingdownlanders.org.uk/events.htm|title=Worthing Downlander Events 2012|publisher=Worthing Downlanders|accessdate=29 March 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721170414/http://www.worthingdownlanders.org.uk/events.htm|archive-date=21 July 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The celebration includes reading from Belloc's work and partaking of a bread and cheese supper with pickles.&lt;ref name="WtgDnlanders"/&gt;

A '''hung parliament''' is a term used in legislatures under the [[Westminster system]] to describe a situation in which no particular [[political party]] or pre-existing [[coalition]] (also known as an alliance or bloc) has an [[absolute majority]] of [[legislator]]s (commonly known as members or seats) in a [[parliament]] or other [[legislature]]. This situation is also known, albeit less commonly, as a '''balanced parliament''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/may/05/minority-government-electoral-reform-editorial | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Balanced parliament: No need to rush | date=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/election_2010/scotland/8630998.stm | work=BBC News | title=SNP puts case for hung parliament | date=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a legislature under '''no overall control''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-48305720100507 | work=Reuters | title=Q+A - What happens if no party gets a majority in UK election? | date=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/04/hung-parliament-minority-coalition-government | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Hung up on 'no overall control' | first=Akash | last=Paun | date=2009-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/uk-politics/2010/05/labour-brown-campaign-cameron |title=Welcome to the era of no overall control |publisher=Newstatesman.com |accessdate=2013-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can result in a [[minority government]]. The term is not relevant in [[multi-party system]]s where it is rare for a single party to hold a majority.

In the Westminster System, in the circumstance of a hung parliament, no party or coalition has an automatic [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] to assume control of the [[executive branch|executive]] – a status usually known in parliamentary systems as "forming (a) government". However, an absolute majority may still be gained through the formation of a new [[coalition government]], or the addition of previously unaffiliated members to a pre-existing coalition. However, a [[minority government]] may instead result: that is, the party that has the most members is allowed to form government without an absolute majority, provided that it has the express, ongoing support of unaffiliated members, such as [[minor parties]] and/or [[independent (politician)|independent]] legislators.

==Overview==
A normal objective of [[parliamentary system]]s – especially those requiring [[responsible government]], such as the [[Westminster system]] – is the formation of a stable government (i.e. ideally one that lasts a full parliamentary term, until the next election would normally be due). This requires a government to be able to muster sufficient votes in parliament to pass  motions of [[confidence and supply]], especially [[Motion of no confidence|motions of no-confidence]] and [[budget bill]]s). If such motions fail, they normally result in the [[dissolution of parliament]] and a fresh election. In some parliamentary systems, however, a new government may be formed without recourse to an election – if, for example, a minor party holds the [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]], it may publicly express for the opposition, thereby creating a new majority.

The term hung parliament is most often used of parliaments dominated by [[two-party system|two major parties or coalitions]]. [[General election]]s in such systems usually result in one party having an absolute majority and thus quickly forming a new government. In most parliamentary systems, a hung parliament is considered exceptional and is often seen by all parties and observers as undesirable. In other contexts, a hung parliament may be seen as ideal – for example, if opinions among the voting public are polarised regarding one or more issues, a hung parliament may lead to the emergence of a compromise or consensus.

If a legislature is [[bicameralism|bicameral]], the term "hung parliament" is usually used only with respect to the [[lower house]].

In a [[multi-party system]] with legislators elected by [[proportional representation]] or a similar systems, it is usually exceptionally rare and difficult for any party to have an absolute majority. Under such situations, hung parliaments are often taken for granted and coalition governments are normal. However, the term may be used to describe an election in which no established coalition wins an outright majority (such as the [[German federal election, 2005|German federal election of 2005]] or the [[Italian general election, 2018|2018 Italian general election]]).

==History==
===Ireland===
Because Ireland uses PR-STV, it is rare for any one party to have a majority on its own.  
The last such occasion was 1977.  However, one or other coalitions are known to be possible before and during the election.  Therefore, a "hung Dáil" (Dáil Éireann being the lower and most dominant chamber of the Oireachtas/Parliament) in Ireland refers more to the inability of a coalition of parties who traditionally enter government together or would be expected to govern together, from doing so.

The President has no direct role in the formation of governments in the case of a hung parliament.  However he retains the power to convene a meeting of either or both the Dáil and Senate which could become important if there was a government trying to use parliamentary recess to prevent confidence votes and hold onto power.  The President may also refuse to dissolve Dáil Eireann and call an election if the Taoiseach loses a vote of confidence, instead giving the other parties a chance to see if they can put together a government without proceeding to another election.

In 2016, Fine Gael and Labour, who had been in government the previous five years, were unable, due to Labours collapse, to enter government again.  Fianna Fáil had enough seats to put together a rainbow government with the other centre-left, hard left parties and independents but negotiations broke down.  Fianna Fáil had also promised not to enter coalition with Sinn Féin due to the current leaderships Provisional IRA connections.

The press began to speculate about a Germany style "Grand Coalition" similar to the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats there.  Many members of FF considered FG too right wing to enter coalition with and threatened to leave the party this came to pass.  As talks continued on without a new government (the old government, constitutionally, which had just been voted out, remaining in power including ministers who had lost their seats) FF agreed to allow a government to form by abstention.  The parliamentary arithmetic fell in such a way that if FF TD's abstained on confidence and supply matters, a FG minority govt could, with the support of a group of independents, form a new government.  This was agreed in exchange for a number of policy concessions.  
Once the deal with FF was signed, Taoiseach Enda Kenny conducted talks with the independents and entered government for a second term.

===United Kingdom===
[[File:UK House of Commons 2017.svg||thumb|right|230px|The House of Commons following the 2017 general election. No party has a majority.]]
In the [[United Kingdom]], before World War I, a largely stable two-party system existed for generations; traditionally, only the [[Tories]] and [[Whig (British political party)|Whigs]], or from the mid-19th century the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] parties, managed to deliver Members of Parliament in significant numbers. Hung parliaments were thus rare, especially during the 19th century. The possibility of change arose when, in the aftermath of the [[Act of Union, 1800]], a number of Irish MPs took seats in the House, though initially [[History of Ireland 1801–1923#Home Rule movement (1870–1914)|these]] followed the traditional alignments. However, two Reform Acts ([[Reform Act 1867|in 1867]] and [[Representation of the People Act 1884|in 1884]]) significantly extended the franchise and redrew the constituencies, and coincided with [[Catholic Emancipation|a change in Irish politics]]. After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1885|1885 general election]], neither party had an overall majority.  The [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] held the balance of power and made [[Irish Home Rule]] a condition of their support. However, the Liberal Party split on the issue of Irish Home Rule, leading to [[United Kingdom general election, 1886|another general election in 1886]], in which the Conservatives won the most seats and governed with the support of the fragment of Liberalism opposed to Home Rule, the [[Liberal Unionist Party]].

Both the [[United Kingdom general election, January 1910|election of January 1910]], and that of [[United Kingdom general election, December 1910|December 1910]] produced a hung parliament with an almost identical number of seats won by the governing Liberal Party and the Conservative Party. This was due both to the constitutional crisis and to the rise of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The [[United Kingdom general election, 1929|elections of 1929]] resulted in the last hung parliament for many years; in the meantime, Labour had replaced the Liberals as one of the two dominating parties.

Since the elections of 1929, there have been three general elections that resulted in hung parliaments in the UK.  The first was the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|election in February 1974]], and the ensuing parliament lasted only until [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October]]. The second was the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|May 2010 election]], the result of which was a hung parliament with the Conservative party as the largest single party. The results for the 3 main parties were: Conservatives 306, Labour 258, Liberal Democrats 57.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politicsraw.com/2010/05/07/uk-election-results-in-hung-parliament "General election 2010 results of a hung parliament"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510024408/http://politicsraw.com/2010/05/07/uk-election-results-in-hung-parliament/ |date=10 May 2010 }}, PoliticsRAW. May 08, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The third one resulted from the [[snap election]] held in [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|June 2017]] that had been called for by [[Theresa May]] in order to strengthen her majority heading into [[Brexit negotiations]] later in 2017. However, this election backfired on May and her [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], resulting in a hung parliament after the snap election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/live/election-2017-40171454|title=Election results 2017: UK wakes up to hung Parliament|date=2017-06-09|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-06-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formation of the coalition resulting from the 2010 election led to the [[Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011]], which instituted fixed five-year Parliaments and transferred the power to call [[snap election|early election]]s from the Prime Minister to Parliament itself. This was the idea of the [[Deputy Prime Minister]] [[Nick Clegg]], then the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], who said that this would stop the Prime Minister and leader of the Conservative Party, [[David Cameron]], from calling a snap election to end the hung parliament, as many other Conservatives had requested.

Hung parliaments can also arise when slim government majorities are eroded by [[by-election]] defeats and [[crossing the floor|defection]] of [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] to opposition parties, as well as resignations of MPs from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]. This happened in December 1996 to the Conservative government of [[John Major]] (1990–97) and in mid-1978 to the Labour government of [[James Callaghan]] (1976–79); this latter period covers the era known as the [[Winter of Discontent]]. The minority government of Jim Callaghan came when Labour ended their 15-month [[Lib-Lab pact]] with the Liberals having lost their majority in early 1977.

According to researchers Andrew Blick and Stuart Wilks-Heeg, the phrase "hung parliament" did not enter into common usage in the UK until the mid-1970s. It was first used in the press by journalist [[Simon Hoggart]] in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democraticaudit.org/download/Hung_Parliament_final.pdf |title=Governing without majorities: Coming to terms with balanced Parliaments in UK politics |first=Andrew |last=Blick |author2=Stuart Wilks-Heeg |date=April 2010 |publisher=Democratic Audit |location=Liverpool |page=2 |accessdate=20 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713091025/http://www.democraticaudit.org/download/Hung_Parliament_final.pdf |archivedate=13 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic treatments of hung parliaments include [[David Butler (academic)|David Butler]]'s ''Governing Without a Majority: Dilemmas for Hung Parliaments in Britain'' (Sheridan House, 1986) and [[Vernon Bogdanor]]'s 'Multi-Party Politics and the Constitution' (Cambridge University Press, 1983).

===Canada===
{{Further|Federal minority governments in Canada}}

Three recent Canadian Parliaments ([[38th Canadian Parliament|the 38th]], [[39th Canadian Parliament|the 39th]], and [[40th Canadian Parliament|the 40th]] Parliaments) were hung parliaments, although that term is not used in Canada.  Rather, the term "minority government" is used to describe the situation in which the party with the greatest number of seats in the House of Commons (but less than a majority) forms the Government.  The aftermath of all three of these elections was that the largest party ruled as a "[[minority government]]". Although minority governments have tended to be short-lived, the two successive minorities under Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] managed to hold on to power from February 2006 until a [[no confidence vote]] in March 2011 resulted in the dissolution of Parliament and elections held on [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2 May 2011]]. The subsequent election saw a majority parliament elected with Harper's [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative Party]] obtaining a 24-seat majority. The make-up of the 40th Canadian Parliament hung parliament resulted in the [[2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute]]. The Conservative Party had a plurality of seats, however, the [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal Party]] and [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]] together held enough seats to have a larger plurality and reached an accord to form a minority [[coalition government]]. The [[Bloc Québécois]] agreed to provide support on confidence votes. On 4 December 2008, [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Michaëlle Jean]] granted [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] a [[Prorogation in Canada|prorogation]] on the condition that parliament reconvene early in the new year; the date was set as 26 January 2009. The first session of the 40th parliament thus ended, delaying a vote of no-confidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/04/harper-jean.html|title=GG agrees to suspend Parliament: Harper| publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|date=2008-12-04|accessdate=2008-12-04| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205134535/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/12/04/harper-jean.html| archivedate=5 December 2008| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[File:Australian House of Reps Sept 2010.svg||thumb|right|230px|The House of Representatives elected in 2010, with a 72-72 tie between the Labor Party and the Opposition Coalition.]]
Australian parliaments are modelled on the [[Westminster system]], with a hung parliament typically defined as a lack of a lower house parliamentary majority from either the [[Australian Labor Party]] or [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]/[[National Party of Australia|National]] [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]].

Hung parliaments are rare at the federal level in Australia, as a virtual [[two-party system]], in which the [[Australian Labor Party]] competes against an alliance of the [[conservatism|conservative]] parties, has existed with only brief interruptions since the early 20th century. Prior to 1910, no party had a majority in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. As a result, there were frequent changes of government, several of which took place during parliamentary terms. Since 1910, when the two-party system was cemented, there have been two hung parliaments, the first in 1940, and the second in 2010. At the [[Australian federal election, 1940|1940 federal election]], incumbent Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]] secured the support of the two [[crossbencher]]s and continued to govern, but in 1941 the independents switched their support to Labor, bringing [[John Curtin]] to power.

Declining support for the major parties in recent times is leading to more non-majoritarian outcomes at elections.&lt;ref name="pgia"&gt;{{cite book |title=Parliamentary Government in Australia |last=Ward |first=Alan J. |year=2014 |publisher=Anthem Press |isbn=178308121X |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=FmvUAgAAQBAJ |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], which resulted in an exact 72-72 seat tie between Labor and The Liberal-National Coalition, incumbent Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] secured the support of four out of six Independent and Green Party crossbenchers and continued to govern.

In [[Australian federal election, 2016|the most recent election]] a hung parliament was only narrowly averted with the Liberal-National Coalition winning 76 seats, the bare minimum required to form a majority government. The Liberal-National Coalition government lost its majority government status after a [[Wentworth by-election, 2018|by-election in 2018]].

Having hung Parliaments in both Australia and the United Kingdom at the same time, and also briefly including Canada as well, is unprecedented in the history of the Commonwealth of Nations. 

Hung parliaments are rather more common at a state level. The [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] and the [[unicameral]] [[Parliament of the Australian Capital Territory]] are both elected by [[Hare-Clark]] proportional representation, thus, elections commonly return hung parliaments. In other states and territories, candidates contest single-member seats. With far fewer seats than federal parliament, hung parliaments are more likely to be elected. Recent examples include [[New South Wales state election, 1991|New South Wales in 1991]], Queensland in [[Queensland state election, 1998|1998]] and [[Queensland state election, 2015|2015]], [[Victorian state election, 1999|Victoria in 1999]], [[South Australian state election, 1997|South Australia in 1997]] and [[South Australian state election, 2002|2002]], [[Western Australian state election, 2008|Western Australia in 2008]], the [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2008|Australian Capital Territory in 2008]], and [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|Tasmania in 2010]].

===New Zealand===
Hung parliaments had a relatively uncommon place in New Zealand politics prior to the introduction of proportional representation in 1993. Only on five occasions since the beginnings of modern party politics in [[New Zealand general election, 1890|1890]] has a hung parliament occurred, in [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911]], [[New Zealand general election, 1922|1922]], [[New Zealand general election, 1928|1928]], [[New Zealand general election, 1931|1931]] &amp; [[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993]] respectively. The rarity between 1936 and 1996 was due to the regression into a two party system, alternating between the long dominating [[New Zealand Labour Party]] and [[New Zealand National Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv |last=Bassett |first=Michael |title=Three Party Politics in New Zealand 1911–1931 |authorlink=Michael Bassett |year=1982 |publisher=Historical Publications |location= Auckland |isbn= 0-86870-006-1 |pages= 64–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the first [[Mixed-member proportional representation|MMP]] election in [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996]] no single party has gained an outright majority in parliament. Subsequent governments have all been formed as either coalitions or under confidence and supply agreements. {{Citation needed|date=July 2017}}

==Consequences==
In countries used to decisive election outcomes, a hung parliament is often viewed as an unfavourable outcome, leading to relatively weak and unstable government. A period of uncertainty after the election is common, as major party leaders negotiate with independents and minor parties to establish a working majority.

An aspiring [[head of government]] may seek to build a [[coalition government]]; in [[Westminster system]]s, this typically involves agreement on a joint legislative programme and a number of [[minister (government)|ministerial]] posts going to the minor coalition partners, in return for a stable majority. Alternatively, a minority government may be formed, establishing [[confidence and supply]] agreements in return for policy concessions agreed in advance, or relying on case by case support.

===Australia===
In the [[Western Australian state election, 2008|Western Australian state election of 2008]] the [[Australian Labor Party]] won more seats than the [[Liberal Party of Australia (Western Australian Division)|Liberal Party]] at 28 to 24. The [[National Party of Australia (WA)|National Party]] along with three independents had the seats needed to give either party a majority. To help the Liberal Party form government, the Nationals supported the party on the condition that the [[Royalties for Regions policy]] was implemented.

In the [[Victorian state election, 1999|1999 Victorian state election]], the Labor Party won 42 seats, while the incumbent Liberal National Coalition retained 43, with 3 seats falling to independents. The Labor Party formed a minority government with the 3 independents.

The [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|2010 Tasmanian state election]] resulted in a hung parliament.  After a period of negotiation, the incumbent Labor government led by [[David Bartlett]] was recommissioned, but containing the Leader of the Tasmanian Greens, [[Nick McKim]], as a minister, and the Greens' [[Cassy O'Connor]] as Cabinet Secretary.

In the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]], neither Labor nor the Liberal coalition secured the majority of seats required to form a Government in their own right. In order to counter the potential instability of minority government involved groups may negotiate written agreements defining their terms of support.  Such measures were undertaken by the Gillard Government in 2010.&lt;ref name="gpia"&gt;{{cite book |title=Government Politics in Australia |last=Fenna |first=Alan |author2=Jane Robbins |author3=John Summers |year=2013 |publisher=Pearson Higher Education AU |isbn=1486001386 |page=49 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=tDDiBAAAQBAJ |accessdate=3 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In [[India]] if an election results in a 'hung assembly' in one of the state [[Vidhan Sabha|Legislative Assemblies]] and no party is capable of gaining confidence then fresh elections are announced to be held as soon as possible. Until this occurs [[President's Rule]] (or in the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] 'Governor's Rule') is applied. In [[India]] there have been many situations of hung assemblies in the state legislatures.

===New Zealand===
The first such occasion was in [[New Zealand general election, 1911|1911]] when the [[New Zealand Liberal Party|Liberal Party]] won fewer seats than the opposition [[New Zealand Reform Party|Reform Party]] despite tallying the most votes. A vote of no confidence was placed by Reform and the Liberals survived by just one vote. This prompted Prime Minister Sir [[Joseph Ward]] to resign, his replacement [[Thomas Mackenzie]] was later defeated in July 1912 in a vote with several MPs and Labour crossing the floor to vote with the opposition, the last time in New Zealand history a government has changed on a confidence vote. This broke 23 years of Liberal governance and [[William Massey]] formed a new Reform Party government. Massey governed through to his death in 1925, though in [[New Zealand general election, 1922|1922]] the Reform Party suffered major losses and Massey was forced negotiate with several Independent MPs to retain power.

In [[New Zealand general election, 1928|1928]], Reform were ousted from governance and Joseph Ward once again won back power. However, the Reform and United (Liberal) parties were tied on seats with Labour holding the balance of power. Labour chose to back Ward rather than let Reform leader [[Gordon Coates]] remain in office. In the next election in [[New Zealand general election, 1931|1931]], there was again a three-way deadlock. On this occasion the Reform and United parties became a coalition government out of mutual fear of Labour's ever-increasing appeal as the [[Great Depression]] worsened.

[[New Zealand general election, 1993|1993]] was the last time a hung parliament occurred in New Zealand. Governor-General Dame [[Catherine Tizard]] asked Sir [[David Beattie]] to form a committee, along with three retired appeal court judges, to decide whom to appoint as Prime Minister. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Governors: New Zealand's Governors and Governors-General|first=Gavin|last=McLean|publisher=Otago University Press|isbn=1-877372-25-0|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However National won an extra seat after special votes were counted, giving National 50 seats and Labour 45 seats (4 were won by third party candidates). Labour's Sir [[Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician)|Peter Tapsell]] agreed to become [[Speaker of the New Zealand House of Representatives]]. As a result, National did not lose a vote in the house and maintained a dubious majority for three years.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 General Election]], no party gained an overall parliamentary majority. Labour won the most seats (301, which was 17 seats short of an overall majority) with the Conservatives on 297 seats, although the Conservatives had a larger share of the popular vote. As the incumbent [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Edward Heath]] remained in office, attempting to build a coalition with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]]. When these negotiations were unsuccessful Heath resigned and Labour led by [[Harold Wilson]] took over in a minority government.

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 UK General Election]], another hung parliament occurred with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] as the largest party, and discussions followed to help create a stable government. This resulted in agreement on a coalition government, which was also a [[majority government]], between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], which won the most votes and seats in the election, and the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 UK General Election]], a hung parliament occurred for the second time in seven years with the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] again being the largest party. The Conservatives led by [[Theresa May]] formed a minority government, supported by a [[Conservative–DUP agreement|confidence-and-supply agreement]] with the [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Democratic Unionist Party]].

==Working majority==
There have been occasions when, although a parliament or assembly is technically hung, the party in power has a [[working majority]]. For example, in the United Kingdom, the tradition is that the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] and Deputy Speakers do not vote and [[Sinn Féin]] MPs never take their seats, so these members can be discounted from the opposition numbers.

===United Kingdom===
In 2005, this was the case in the 60-seat [[National Assembly for Wales]], where Labour lost their majority when [[Peter Law]] was expelled for standing against the official candidate in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 Westminster election]] in the [[Blaenau Gwent (UK Parliament constituency)|Blaenau Gwent constituency]]. When the Assembly was [[National Assembly for Wales election, 2003|first elected]] on 1 May 2003, [[Welsh Labour|Labour]] won 30 seats, [[Plaid Cymru]] won 12, the [[Welsh Conservative Party|Conservatives]] won 11, [[Welsh Liberal Democrats|Liberal Democrats]] won 6, and the [[John Marek Independent Party]] won a seat.

When [[Dafydd Elis-Thomas]] (Plaid Cymru) was reelected as the presiding officer, this reduced the number of opposition AMs who could vote to 29, as the presiding officer votes only in the event of a tie and, even then, not on party political lines but according to [[Speaker Denison's rule]]. Thus, Labour had a working majority of one seat until Law ran in Blaenau Gwent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epolitix.com/EN/News/200504/1c6a58e1-0c76-46b6-8b0d-f3fd085839fc.htm Labour lose assembly majority as Law quits], ePolitix.com.

The '''Islamic Republican Party''' (IRP; {{lang-fa|حزب جمهوری اسلامی|Ḥezb-e Jomhūrī-e Eslāmī}}, also translated '''Islamic Republic Party''') formed in mid-1979 to assist the [[Iranian Revolution]] and Ayatollah [[Khomeini]] establish theocracy in Iran. It was disbanded in May 1987 due to internal conflicts.

== Founders and characteristics ==
The party was formed just two weeks following the revolution upon the request of Ayatollah Khomeini.&lt;ref name=mes94 /&gt; Five cofounders of the party were [[Mohammad Javad Bahonar]], [[Mohammad Beheshti]], [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]], [[Ali Khamenei]], and [[Abdolkarim Mousavi-Ardabili]].&lt;ref name=mes94 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jplaw&gt;{{cite journal|last=Asayesh|first=Hossein|author2=Adlina Ab.

The party has been said to be distinguished by "its strong clerical component, its loyalty to Khomeini, its strong animosity to the liberal political movements, and its tendency to support the revolutionary organizations," such as the ''komiteh.''  Policies it supported included the state takeover of large capital enterprises, the establishment of an Islamic cultural and university system, and programs to assist the poor.&lt;ref name="Bakhash, 1984 p.67"&gt;Bakhash, ''Reign of the Ayatollahs'', (1984), p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

These revolutionary [[ayatollah]]s originally used the party to form a monopoly over the post-revolutionary theocratic Iranian state. In its struggle with civilian opponents the party made use of its ties to the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guards]] and [[Hezbollah of Iran|Hezbollah]].

==Causes of its dissolution==
[[File:President Ali Khamenei meet Non-Iranian Hawza students - Office of the Islamic Republican Party in Qom.jpg|thumb|Ali Khamenei at the party's office in [[Qom]], 1983]]
In the late 1980s, factionalism in the IRP intensified, the major issues being the Iran-Iraq War, whether to open up to foreign countries or remain isolated, and economic policies. Because all rival parties had been banned, the party "did almost nothing and had little incentive to."&lt;ref&gt;Keddie, Nikkie, ''Modern Iran'', 2003, pp. 259-60&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ahmad Mneisi,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"While unanimous on the idea of a theological state and united under the umbrella of one party, the Islamic Republican Party (IRP), [the religious right] differed on a number of issues, such as the extent to which religion is to take hold of political life (the [[Velayat-e Faqih]] debate).&lt;ref&gt;Mneisi, Ahmad.

Daniel Brumberg argued that it was in response to the dispute between president [[Ali Khamenei]] and popular prime Minister [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]], that the IRP was dissolved - the Islamic Republican Party served "as a stronghold of radical activism," supporting Mousavi.&lt;ref&gt;Brumberg, Daniel, ''Reinventing Khomeini : The Struggle for Reform in Iran'', University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; However, another report states that it was dissolved in May 1987 due to internal conflicts.&lt;ref name="jplaw"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nikou&gt;{{cite web|last=Nikou|first=Semira N.|title=Timeline of Iran's Political Events|url=http://iranprimer.usip.org/resource/timeline-irans-political-events|work=United States Institute of Peace|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the party was disbanded upon joint proposal of Rafsanjani and then party leader Khameini on 2 May 1987 when their proposal was endorsed by Ayatollah Khomeini.&lt;ref name=mes94&gt;{{cite journal|last=Behrooz|first=Maziar|title=Factionalism in Iran under Khomeini|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|date=October 1994|volume=27|issue=4|pages=597–614|jstor=4283464|doi=10.1080/00263209108700879}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Italian Council of the European Movement''' is an Italian advocacy group.

== History ==
Following May 1948 [[Congress of the Hague]], was created in [[Italy]], in December 1948, a National Council of the European Movement which was an organism in charge of the cooperation between the pro-European MPs and the [[European Federalist Movement]]. However its rebuilding was necessary in 1956 because of the opposition inside the pro-European movement between the so-called “functionalists”, supporters of a progressive market integration of the “little Europe” – in which they recognized the necessary base for every further development – and the majority of the Italian federalists, like [[Altiero Spinelli]], very critical about the European governments after the failure of the [[European Community of Defence]]. In these conditions, it seemed unavoidable that the CIME assumes de facto an alternative character respecting to the militant federalism because of its composition (including political parties in charge and unions related to these). This situation evolved with time, notably thank to the accession of [[Giuseppe Petrilli]] at the Presidency in autumn 1964. In spite of being a former member of the EEC-three-first-year Commission, he matured a vision of the integration process which surpass the intergovernmental approach. The merger between the CIME and the Federalist Movement came to a conclusion in 1966 with the adhesion of the second to the first. The European Movement joined – first at the national level then to the European one – the fundamental positions of the federalist strategy and so recognized the importance of [[European Parliament]] election at the universal direct suffrage as an indispensable condition for any further progress on the political and institutional camp. When the parliamentary initiative of [[Altiero Spinelli]] (after the 1979 first EP elections) demonstrated the adequacy of this strategy, the CIME gave it its full support, through the strong pressure in favour of the treaty project made by the European Parliament to the Italian presidency of  the Community, in the first semester of 1985. From there, the successive presidencies of [[Mauro Ferri]], [[Mario Zagari]] e [[Giorgio Napolitano]] largely confirmed the continuity of the rapport within the CIME between the national political, social-economic forces and the federalist avant-garde. So the CIME counted among the protagonists in Italy of the constant commitment in favour of the [[Euro]] creation but also of European institutional reforms to get to the adoption of a real Constitution for the Union.

The '''Labour Representation Committee''' (LRC) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[socialist]] [[pressure group]] within the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and wider labour movement. It is often seen as representing the most left-wing members of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

==Overview==
The LRC was formed at a founding conference on Saturday 3 July 2004, taking its name from the original [[British Labour Party|Labour Representation Committee]] which was formed in February 1900.

The LRC allows [[Constituency Labour Parties]] (CLPs) and Branch Labour Parties (BLPs) to affiliate to it, along with local, regional and national unions and individual party members and supporters. It has around 150 affiliates and 1000 individual members. In parliament, the group is represented by the [[Socialist Campaign Group]]. The LRC also has a youth group, the Socialist Youth Network.

The Chairman is [[John McDonnell (politician)|John McDonnell]], who the LRC supported as a candidate for leader of the Labour Party. Its Organiser is Lizzie Woods. Joint-National Secretaries are Andrew Fisher and Peter Firmin. Its Vice-Chairs are Jenny Lennox and Susan Press. The Treasurer is Graham Bash, Editor of ''[[Labour Briefing]]''. They are the current officers of the organisation.

According to LRC affiliate [[Socialist Appeal (UK, 1992)|Socialist Appeal]] in November 2014: "The Labour Representation Committee has lost a third of its members and is now down to 600 – in a party of 190,000. It is teetering on the verge of collapse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialist.net/scottish-labour-in-crisis-as-leadership-election-begins.htm|title=Scottish Labour in crisis as leadership election begins|date=17 November 2014|work=[[Socialist Appeal (UK, 1992)]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this claim, LRC members have been involved in launching the activist [[Socialist Campaign for a Labour Victory]] in early 2015.

== LRC Youth ==
The LRC Youth, is a section of the LRC for those aged 27 and under. It was founded as the Socialist Youth Network in March 2007 and was relaunched in mid-2012 under its current name..

== National Committee ==
The National Committee is elected annually by delegates to the LRC's annual general meeting. Members of the National Committee are elected for 12 month terms to conduct the general business of the LRC between annual general meetings. The National Committee is responsible for electing, and holding to account, an Executive Committee, which is responsible for any general business between meetings of the National Committee. The National Committee is also responsible for the preparation of LRC publications, and for appointing delegates to represent the LRC when necessary.

The current National Committee is elected at the LRC's annual general meeting in November, and its membership is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.l-r-c.org.uk/about/nationalcommittee|title=LRC National Committee|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''leasehold estate''' is an ownership of a temporary right to hold land or property in which a [[Lease|lessee]] or a tenant holds rights of [[real property]] by some form of [[title (property)|title]] from a lessor or [[landlord]]. Although a tenant does hold rights to real property, a leasehold estate is typically considered personal property.

'''Leasehold''' is a form of [[land tenure]] or property tenure where one party buys the right to occupy land or a building for a given length of time. As lease is a legal estate, leasehold estate can be bought and sold on the open market. A leasehold thus differs from a [[Freehold (law)|freehold]] or [[fee simple]] where the ownership of a property is purchased outright and thereafter held for an indeterminate length of time, and also differs from a tenancy where a property is let (rented) on a periodic basis such as weekly or monthly.

Until the end of the lease period (often measured in decades or centuries; a 99-year lease is quite common) the leaseholder has the right to remain in occupation as an assured tenant paying an agreed rent to the owner. Terms of the agreement are contained in a [[lease]], which has elements of contract and property law intertwined.

The term '''estate for years''' may occasionally be used. This refers to a leasehold estate for ''any'' specific period of time (the word "years" is misleading.) An estate for years is not automatically renewed.

Colloquially, "''lease''" and "''[[leasing]]''" are often a formalization of a longer, specific period as compared with a "''rental''" that created a tenancy at will, terminable or renewable at the end of a short period.

== History ==
Laws governing landlord-tenant relationships can be found as far back as the [[Code of Hammurabi]]. However, the [[common law]] of the landlord-tenant relation evolved in England during the [[Middle Ages]]. That law still retains many archaic terms and principles pertinent to a [[feudal]] social order and an [[agrarian economy]], where land was the primary economic asset and ownership of land was the primary source of rank and status. See also [[Lord of the Manor]].

Modern leasehold estates can take one of four forms—the ''fixed-term tenancy'' or ''tenancy for years'', the ''periodic tenancy'', the ''tenancy at will'', and the ''tenancy at sufferance''. Forms no longer used{{cn|date=February 2018}} include [[socage]] and [[burgage]].

When a landowner allows one or more persons, called "tenants", to use the land in some way for some fixed period of time, the land becomes a leasehold, and the resident- (or worker-) landowner relation is called a "tenancy". A tenant pays [[renting|rent]] (a form of [[consideration]]) to the landowner. The leasehold can include buildings and other improvements to the land. The tenant can do one or more of: farm the leasehold, live on it, or practice a trade on it. Typically, leasehold estates are held by tenants for a specific period of time, such as 99 years.

Tenancy was essential to the [[feudalism|feudal hierarchy]]; a lord would own land and the tenants became [[vassals]]. Leasehold estates can still be [[Crown land]] today. For example, in the [[Australian Capital Territory]], all private land "ownerships" are actually leaseholds of Crown land.

In the US, there are food [[co-op]]s that supply tenants with a place to grow their own produce. [[Rural tenancy]] is also a common practice. Under a [[rural tenancy]], a person buys a large amount of land and the rural community uses it agriculturally as a source of income.

== Fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years ==
A ''fixed-term tenancy'' or [[Lease#Fixed-term tenancy or tenancy for years|tenancy for years]] lasts for some fixed period of time. Despite the name, such a tenancy can last for any period of time{{spaced ndash}}even a tenancy for one week would be called a tenancy for years. At common law the duration did not need to be certain, but could be conditioned upon the happening of some event (e.g. "until the crops are ready for harvest", "until the war is over"). In many jurisdictions that possibility has been partially or totally abolished.&lt;ref&gt;For example in [[England and Wales]] the Law of Property Act 1925 s149(6) abolished leases for lives, and a lease expressed to be for a life is converted into a lease for 90 years, terminable on the death of the tenant.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Termination ===
The tenancy will come to an end automatically when the fixed term runs out, or, in the case of a tenancy that ends on the happening of an event, when the event occurs. It is also possible for a tenant, either expressly or impliedly, to give up the tenancy to the landlord. This process is known as a surrender of the lease.

== Periodic tenancy ==
A '''periodic tenancy''', also known as a '''tenancy from year to year''', '''month to month''', or '''week to week''', is an estate that exists for some period of time determined by the term of the payment of rent. An oral lease for a tenancy of years that violates the [[statute of frauds]] (by committing to a lease of more than—depending on the jurisdiction—one year without being in writing) may actually create a periodic tenancy, the construed term being dependent on the laws of the jurisdiction where the leased premises are located. In many jurisdictions the "default" tenancy, where the parties have not explicitly specified a different arrangement, and where none is presumed under local or business custom, is the month-to-month tenancy.

== Tenancy at will ==
A '''tenancy at will''' or '''estate at will'''  is a leasehold such that either the landlord or the tenant may terminate the tenancy at any time by giving reasonable notice.  It usually occurs in the absence of a [[lease]], or where the tenancy is not for [[consideration]]. Under the modern common law, tenancy at will can arise under the following circumstances:
* the parties expressly agree that the tenancy is at will and not for rent.
* a family member is allowed to live at home without formal arrangement. A nominal consideration may be required.
* a tenant wishes to occupy the property urgently, but there was insufficient time to negotiate and execute a lease. The tenancy at will terminates in this case as soon as a written lease is completed. If a lease fails to be realized, the tenant must vacate the property.{{dubious|date=November 2017}}

In a residential lease for consideration, a tenant may not be removed except for [[causation (law)|cause]], even in the absence of a written lease. If a landlord can terminate the tenancy at will, a tenant by [[operation of law]] is also granted a reciprocal right to terminate at will. However, a lease that expressly continues at the will of the tenant ("for as long as the tenant desires to live on this land") does not automatically provide the landlord with a reciprocal right to terminate, even for cause. Rather, such language may be construed to convey to the tenant a [[life estate]] or even a [[fee simple]].

A tenancy at will terminates by [[operation of law]], if:
* the tenant commits [[waste (law)|waste]] against the property;
* the tenant attempts to [[assignment (law)|assign]] his tenancy;
* the landlord transfers his interest in the property;
* the landlord leases the property to another person;
* the tenant or the landlord dies.

== Tenancy at sufferance ==
A tenancy at sufferance is created when a tenant wrongfully holds over past the end of the duration period of the tenancy (for example, a tenant who stays past the expiration of his or her lease). In this case, the landlord can hold over the tenant to a new tenancy, and collect rent for the period the tenant has held over.
A '''tenancy at sufferance''' (sometimes called a '''holdover tenancy''') may exist when a tenant remains in possession of property even after the end of the lease, until the landlord acts to eject the tenant. The occupant may legally be a [[trespasser]] at this point, and the possession of this type may not be a true estate in land, even if authorities recognize the condition to hold the tenant liable for rent. The landlord may be able to [[eviction|evict]] such tenant at any time, without notice.  Action to evict will terminate a tenancy at sufferance, because the tenant no longer enjoys possession.  Some jurisdictions impose an irrevocable election whereby the landlord treats the holdover as either a trespasser, or as a tenant at sufferance.  A trespasser is not in possession; but a tenant at sufferance continues to enjoy possession of the real property.

The landlord may also be able to impose a new lease on the holdover tenant. For a residential tenancy, such new tenancy lasts month to month. For a commercial tenancy of more than a year, the new tenancy is year to year; otherwise, the tenancy lasts for the same length of time as the duration under the original lease. In either case, the landlord can charge a higher rent, if the landlord, before the expiration of the original lease, has notified the tenant of the increase.

Simply leaving property behind on the premises does not constitute possession and thus, a tenancy at sufferance cannot be established.  E.g., ''Nathan Lane Assocs. v. Merchants Wholesale'', 698 N.W.2d 136 (Iowa 2005); ''Brown v. Music, Inc.'', 359 P.2d 295 (Alaska 1961).

== Lease expiration ==
Depending on the laws in force in a particular jurisdiction, different circumstances may legally arise where a tenant remains in possession of property after the expiration of a lease.

=== Continuation tenancy ===
In some jurisdictions, the tenant has a legal right to remain in occupation of the premises after the end of a lease unless the landlord complies with a formal process to dispossess the tenant of the property. For example, in [[England and Wales]], a business tenant has a right to continue occupying their [[demise]] after the end of their lease under the provisions of sections 24–28 of the [[Landlord and Tenant Act 1954]] (unless these provisions were formally excluded by agreement before the lease was completed). At the end of their lease they need do nothing but continue payment of rent at the previous level and uphold all other relevant [[Covenant (law)|covenants]] such as to keep the building in good repair. They cannot be evicted unless the landlord serves a formal notice to end the tenancy and successfully opposes the grant of the new lease to which the tenant has an automatic right. Even this can only be done under prescribed circumstances, for example the landlord's desire to occupy the premises himself or to demolish and redevelop the building.

== Duties of participants ==

=== Duties of landlord ===
The first is to put the tenant in physical possession of the land at the outset of the lease (the [[English rule (property)|English]] and [[majority rule]], as opposed to the [[American rule (property)|American rule]] which only requires the tenant be given ''legal'' possession, or the ''right'' to possess); the second is to provide the premises in a ''habitable condition''—there is an implied warranty of habitability. If landlord violates either, the tenant can terminate the lease and move out, or stay on the premises, while continuing to pay rent, and sue the landlord for damages (or withhold rent and use breach of implied warranty of habitability as a defense when the landlord attempts to collect rent).

The lease also includes an implied covenant of quiet enjoyment{{spaced ndash}}landlord will not interfere with tenant's quiet enjoyment. This can be breached in three ways.
# Total eviction of the tenant through direct physical invasion by landlord.
# Partial eviction{{spaced ndash}}when the landlord keeps the tenant off ''part'' of the leased property (even locking a single room). Tenant can stay on the remaining property without paying any rent.
# Partial eviction by someone ''other'' than landlord{{spaced ndash}}where this occurs, rent is apportioned. If landlord claims to lease tenant an area of 1000 square metres but 400 square metres of the area belongs to another person, tenant only has to pay 60% of the rent.

=== Landlord's tort liability ===
Under the common law, the landlord had no duties to the tenant to protect the tenant or the tenant's [[licensees]] and [[invitees]], except in the following situations:
# Failure to disclose latent defects of which the landlord knows or has reason to know. Note that the landlord has no duty to repair, just to disclose.
# For a short term lease (3 months or less) of a furnished dwelling, the tenants are treated as invitees, and the landlord is liable for defects even if the landlord neither knows nor should know of them.
# Common areas under landlord's control (e.g. hallways in an [[apartment building]]), if the landlord failed to use reasonable care in maintaining them.
# Injury resulting from landlord's negligent repairs{{spaced ndash}}even if the landlord used all due care.
# Public use, if the following three factors exist:
## Landlord knows or should know that the tenant makes public use of the land (e.g. the land is rented for use as a restaurant or a store);
## Landlord knows or should know that there is a defect; and
## Landlord knows or should know that the tenant will not fix the defect.

=== Duties of tenant ===
Under the common law, the tenant has two duties to the landlord:
# to pay rent when it is due,
# to avoid [[waste (law)|waste]] of the property.
A tenant is liable to third party invitees for negligent failure to correct a dangerous condition on the premise{{spaced ndash}}even if the landlord was contractually liable.

== Effects of condemnation ==
If land under lease to a tenant is condemned under the government's power of [[eminent domain]], the tenant may be able to earn either a reduction in rent or a portion of the condemnation award (the price paid by the government) to the owner, depending on the amount of land taken, and the value of the leasehold property.

With a ''partial taking'' of the land, the tenant may claim apportioned rent for property taken. For example, suppose a tenant leases land for 6 months for 1,000 per month, and that two months into the lease, and the government condemns 25% of the land. The tenant will then be entitled to take a portion of the condemnation award equal to 25% of the rent due for the remaining four months of the lease—1,000, derived from 250 per month for four months.

A ''full taking'', however, extinguishes the lease, and excuses all rent from that point. The tenant will not be entitled to any portion of the condemnation award, unless the value of the lease was greater than the rent paid, in which case the tenant can recover the difference. Suppose in the above example that the market value of the land being leased was actually 1,200 a month, but the 1,000 per month rate represented a break given to the tenant by the landlord. Because the tenant is losing the ability to continue renting the land at this bargain rate (and probably must move to more expensive land), the tenant will be entitled to the difference between the lease rate and the market value – 200 per month for a total of 800.

== Effects of tenancy ==
Many adverse effects come from this system. Tenants have to pay the landowner even though they are doing all of the agricultural work. In a sense, it is a cycle where the tenant is never really able to become a landowner because they constantly have to pay the landowner, as well as other expenses.  If a crop does not flourish, the tenant will still have to pay for the use of the land. The landowner, since he is ultimately owner of the land, also can have a say in what the tenant uses the land for or what he can or cannot grow. On the contrary, [[rural tenancy]] has advantages. If a person owns too much land for just their family to use, tenants can rent it and make use of the land. Also, if a landowner rents out the land, it can be a source of economic income for the tenant which may not have previously existed. In poorer communities, rural tenancy can give the tenants a chance to grow crops to sell in markets and to feed their families.

In England in recent years, some new homes and apartments have been sold by large housebuilders with a leasehold where the ground rent payable doubles every 10 to 25 years, with consequently a very high price to buy out the lease. This has caused some recently built homes to be extremely difficult to sell.&lt;ref name=guardian-20161029&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2016/oct/29/new-builds-house-buyers-leasehold-property-trap |title=The new-builds catching house buyers in a leasehold property trap |first=Patrick |last=Collinson |newspaper=The Guardian |date=29 October 2016 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017 the British government launched a consultation on legal reforms to end such exploitative schemes.&lt;ref name=telegraph-20170211&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/money/consumer-affairs/government-act-leasehold-rip-offs/ |title=Government to act on leasehold rip-offs |first=Olivia |last=Rudgard |newspaper=Daily Telegraph |date=11 February 2017 |accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Ministry of Defence is a successor of the ''Military Department'' created by the [[British East India Company]] in [[Calcutta]] in 1776. Its main function was to coordinate and record orders, relating to the Army, issued by various Departments of the Government of the East India Company. The Military Department initially functioned as a branch of the Public Department and maintained a list of Army personnel. Following Pakistan's [[Independence of Pakistan|independence]] in 1947, the Ministry of Defence was established at [[Karachi]] in August of that year, with Prime Minister [[Liaquat Ali Khan]] also holding the [[Defence Minister of Pakistan|Minister of Defence]], while [[Iskander Mirza]] served as [[Pakistan Secretary of Defence|Defence Secretary]]. British flag officers remained commanders-in-chief of the army, navy and air force in Pakistan until 1956. In December 1959, the federal capital shifted temporarily to Rawalpindi, while plans for Islamabad were drawn up by then-General [[Ayub Khan (general)|Ayub Khan]]'s military government. The proximity of the Army Headquarters in Rawalpindi played a major role in the decision to relocate the capital. In March 1972, [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]] in response to criticism over the difficulties in inter-service coordination in previous wars decreed that all service HQs were to move to Islamabad.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1215003|title=What is being built on GHQ land?|first=Ikram|last=Junaidi|date=23 October 2015|publisher=Dawn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy was the first to comply, with Naval Headquarters moving from [[Karachi]] to Sector E9 [[Islamabad]] 1974, while Air Headquarters moved from [[Peshawar]] to Sector E10 Islamabad in 1983. Following [[Pervez Musharraf#Assassination attempts|two failed assassination attempts]] in Rawalpindi, [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Pervez Musharraf]] restarted plans in 2004 for the entire defence establishment to shift to Sector E10 in Islamabad where the Ministry of Defence along with the four service headquarters would be based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newslinemagazine.com/magazine/military-land-grab/|title=Military Land-Grab|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was subsequently cancelled in 2008 grounds of cost following Musharraf's forced resignation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Ministry of Defence is presently located at "Calcutta House" in [[Rawalpindi]]. Other related top-level head offices based in Rawalpindi include the [[Ministry of Defence Production (Pakistan)|Ministry of Defence Production]] (MoDP), [[Joint Staff Headquarters (Pakistan)|Joint Staff Headquarters]] and the [[General Headquarters (Pakistan Army)|Army General Headquarters]]. The [[Air Headquarters (Pakistan Air Force)|Air Headquarters]] and the [[Naval Headquarters (Pakistan Navy)|Naval Headquarters]] are located in [[Islamabad]].

The '''Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom''' ({{lang-fr|Mouvement pour l’Europe des nations et des libertés}}), abbreviated to '''MENL''' or '''MENF''', is an alliance of European political parties founded in 2014. Its political group in the European Parliament is [[Europe of Nations and Freedom]].

==History==
In  the aftermath of the [[European Parliament election, 2014]], parties affiliated with the [[European Alliance for Freedom]] unsuccessfully attempted to form a [[Political groups of the European Parliament|political group]] in the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/europe/article4102623.ece |title=Le Pen party steals Farage’s Italian allies |publisher=The Times |date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/24/marine-le-pen-fails-form-far-right-bloc-european-parliament |title=Marine Le Pen fails to form far-right bloc in European parliament &amp;#124; World news |publisher=The Guardian |date= |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/le-pens-far-right-eu-parliament-alliance-fails-start-1453971 |title=Le Pen's Far-Right EU Parliament Alliance Fails at Start |publisher=Ibtimes.co.uk |date=2014-06-24 |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 2014, they decided to create a new European-level structure, which became the Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom. The Dutch [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV) chose not to participate in this pan-European party, as it declined to be funded by the European Union.&lt;ref name=mudde&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/cas-mudde/eaf-is-dead-long-live-menl|title=The EAF is dead! Long live the MENL!|author=[[Cas Mudde]]|work=[[openDemocracy]]|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Polish [[Congress of the New Right]] (KNP), initially claimed that it would be part of the new alliance, but was accused in a press release by the French [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]] of spreading false claims in the Polish and Austrian media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontnational.com/2014/10/communique-daymeric-chauprade-chef-de-delegation-du-front-national-au-parlement-europeen/|title=Communiqué d’Aymeric Chauprade, chef de Délégation du Front National au Parlement européen|work=Front National|accessdate=29 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately the KNP took part in the creation of the party's new parliamentary group as its former controversial leader [[Janusz Korwin-Mikke]] was evicted from the party to be replaced by Michal Marusik.

It was recognised by the European Parliament (EP) in 2015. Its maximum grant by the EP for this year is €1,170,746&lt;ref name="EPgrantamounts_2015"&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/grants/Grant_amounts_parties%2003-2015_new%20logo.pdf "Grants from the European Parliament to political parties at European level 2004-2015"], March 2015, Europarl.europa.eu, retrieved 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt; plus €621,677 for its affiliated [[Political foundation at European level|political foundation]], the ''Fondation pour une Europe des Nations et des Libertés''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/pdf/grants/Grant_amounts_foundations%2003-2015_new%20logo.pdf "Grants from the European Parliament to political foundations at European level 2008-2015"], March 2015, Europarl.europa.eu/, retrieved 27 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 2015, the [[Europe of Nations and Freedom]] parliamentary group was created in the [[European Parliament]] with members of the MENL (RN, FPÖ, LN, VB) as well as the PVV, Poland's [[Congress of the New Right|KNP]] and a former member of [[UKIP]], [[Janice Atkinson]].

The 1st congress of the movement was held on 28 June 2015 in [[Perpignan]], [[France]] gathering some [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] from the [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]] as well as a few of its local &amp; national representatives members; the objective of this meeting was mainly about making the 1st year of action of the National Rally's MEPs in review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lindependant.fr/2015/06/27/a-perpignan-le-front-national-accuse-l-europe-et-le-pouvoir,2050944.php|title=À Perpignan, le Front national accuse l’Europe et le pouvoir (notre interview video de Marine Le Pen)|date=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 September 2015, the Flemish [[Vlaams Belang]] (VB) and the movement organised a colloquium dealing with sovereignty which took place in the [[Flemish Parliament]] with VB's leader [[Tom Van Grieken]], MEP [[Gerolf Annemans]], VB's member Barbara Pas and [[National Rally (France)|National Rally]]'s leader [[Marine Le Pen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grenzenstellen.eu/ |title=Colloquium Soevereiniteit: Grenzen Stellen |website=Grenzenstellen.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the Flemish parties approved [[Marine Le Pen]]'s visit at the Flemish Parliament although the speaker of the Flemish Parliament [[Jan Peumans]] ([[New Flemish Alliance|N-VA]]) decided not to be part of this colloquium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Frédéric Chardon |url=http://www.lalibre.be/actu/politique-belge/tous-les-partis-flamands-ont-approuve-la-venue-de-marine-le-pen-55f832ff3570b0f19ea60dbd#.VfhVlpB_xFZ.twitter |title=Tous les partis flamands ont approuvé la venue de Marine Le Pen |website=La Libre.be |date=2015-09-15 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 October 2015, MENL's leader and vice-president of the National Rally [[Louis Aliot]] met the current president of [[Brothers of Italy]], [[Giorgia Meloni]] in [[Trieste]] for a conference on immigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fratelli-italia.it/2015/10/20/immigrazione-sabato-24-ottobre-confronto-a-trieste-tra-giorgia-meloni-e-il-vicepresidente-del-front-national-louis-aliot/ |title=Fratelli d'Italia – Alleanza Nazionale &amp;#124; Immigrazione, sabato 24 ottobre confronto a Trieste tra Giorgia Meloni e il vicepresidente del Front National, Louis Aliot |website=Fratelli-italia.it |date=2015-10-20 |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marine Le Pen]] praised [[Swiss People's Party|SVP]]'s victory during the [[Swiss federal election, 2015|2015 Swiss election]] although the Swiss party does not have official links with the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.letemps.ch/suisse/2015/10/19/victoire-udc-beaucoup-francais-enthousiastes |title=Victoire de l'UDC: beaucoup de Français enthousiastes - Le Temps |language=fr|website=Letemps.ch |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement also launched an anti-immigration campaign in 2015 just like the [[Swiss People's Party|SVP]]'s campaign during [[Swiss immigration referendum, February 2014|Swiss referendum on immigration]] in 2014.

On 21 November 2015, MENL's think thank "Foundation for a Europe of Nations and Freedom" organised a colloquium ("L'euro, un échec inéluctable?") dealing with [[Euro]] and how it might be an inescapable failure. [[Jacques Sapir]] took part in this colloqium among others. The FENF, chaired by [[Gerolf Annemans]], organised another colloquim on 2 April 2016 in [[Paris]] dealing with union representation and the development of professional organisations in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fenl.eu/contact/ |title=Foundation for a Europe of Nations and Freedom - Contact |website=Fenl.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third colloquium of the movement took place on 4 March 2016 in the [[Flemish Parliament]]  with VB's leader [[Tom Van Grieken]] and [[Party for Freedom|PVV]]'s leader [[Geert Wilders]]. This colloquim entitled "Freedom" ("Vrijheid") dealt with liberties in Europe and how they would be threatened by immigration from "countries with cultures which are fundamentally different [from the European one]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colloquiumvrijheid.eu/ |title=Colloquium Vrijheid |website=Colloquiumvrijheid.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement's member parties and allies met in July 2016 in Vienna, an event hosted by Austria's FPÖ. The French National Rally, [[Matteo Salvini]]'s Northern League, the AfD, Belgium's [[Vlaams Belang]], the Dutch Party for Freedom were present among other independent politicians and smaller European parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/europes-right-wing-parties-meet-near-vienna-urge-brexit/a-19339474 |title=Europe's right-wing parties meet near Vienna, urge Brexit |publisher=DW.COM |date=2016-06-17 |accessdate=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Politico]], the movement owed in 2016 the [[European Parliament]] €535,818. The reasons given by Politico were the forbidden use of European grants by the MENL party to finance national political parties and referendum campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Posaner |first=Joshua |url=http://www.politico.eu/article/national-front-marine-le-pen-far-right-groups-ordered-to-pay-european-parliament-e800000/ |title=Far-right groups ordered to pay European Parliament €800,000 |publisher=Politico.eu |date=2016-09-03 |accessdate=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party strongly denied these allegations by saying that they just had to give the unused EU funds back to the European Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.menleuropa.eu/2016/09/15/response-to-the-shameless-lies-of-the-website-politico/ |title=Response to the shameless lies of the website Politico |publisher=Movement for a Europe of Nations and Freedom |date=2016-09-15 |accessdate=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Pax Europaea''''' ({{lang-en|the European peace|link=yes|italic=yes}} &amp;ndash; after the historical ''[[Pax Romana]]''), is the period of relative peace experienced by [[Europe]] in the period following [[World War II]]—often associated above all with the creation of the [[European Union]] (EU) and its predecessors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tsoukalis |first=Loukas |title= What Kind of Europe? |year= 2005|publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-0-19-927948-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Cold War]] this peace was even more evident because of the fall in political tensions, with the major exception of the [[Yugoslav Wars]] and [[Post-Soviet conflicts|various tensions with and within Russia]]. In 2012, the EU was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

==History==
[[Transatlantic relations|Transatlantic cooperation]] and [[European integration]] was designed to maintain the fragile peace that was created in Europe. With the continent consistently falling into war over the past centuries the creation of the [[European Communities]] in the 1950s set to integrate its members to such an extent that war between them would be impossible. These  Communities, and other organisations including [[NATO]] expanded to cover most of [[Western Europe]], [[Northern Europe]] and [[Southern Europe]]. Although [[Central and Eastern Europe]] remained under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] influence, they too experienced little conflict, with the major exception of internal repression, until the 1990s when a series of [[Yugoslav Wars|wars in Yugoslavia]] broke out as the country disintegrated. The EU structures were criticised for its inability to prevent the conflict, though the zone is now within its sphere of [[Enlargement of the European Union|enlargement]].

The EU now comprises 28 countries with majority of European non-member states seeking membership (twelve countries joined the EU in 2000s). In addition to that, most countries which remain outside are tied to the EU by economic agreements and treaties such as the [[European Economic Area]]. Within the zone of integration, there has been no conflict since 1945, making it the longest period of peace on the western European mainland since [[Pax Romana]].

The European Union was awarded the [[2012 Nobel Peace Prize]] in recognition of its efforts to maintain and actively foster peace within its borders as well as internationally through diplomatic means.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=From War to Peace: A European Tale|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2012/eu-lecture_en.html|publisher=Nobel Lecture by the European Union|accessdate=4 January 2014|author=Herman Van Rompuy |author2=José Manuel Durão Barroso |date=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though a number of armed conflicts occurred on the European peninsula after World War II, none of them have been between members of the European Union. Most of these conflicts have taken place in the former Yugoslavia and Soviet Union.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6535">'''Philippe Henriot''' (7 January 1889, [[Reims]] – 28 June 1944, [[Paris]]) was a [[France|French]] poet, journalist, politician, and Minister in the French government at [[Vichy government|Vichy]], where he directed propaganda broadcasts. He also joined the [[Milice]] part-time.

==Career==
[[File:Philippe Henriot 1934.jpg|thumbnail|Philippe Henriot in 1934]]
Philippe Henriot, a devout Roman Catholic, and poet who had written several books of poetry during the early 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;Hellman, J., ''The Knight-Monks of Vichy France, Uriage, 1940-45.'' Liverpool: [[Liverpool University]] Press, 1997, pp. 192-319. {{ISBN|0-85323-742-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; became politically active during the [[Republican Federation]], and was elected to the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]]'s Chamber of Deputies for the [[Gironde]] ''[[Département in France|département]]'' in 1932 and 1936. He became "a committed member of the Catholic nationalist right".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Chadwick, K. (2003) 'A Broad Church: French Catholics and National-Socialist Germany' In Atkin, N. &amp; Tallett, F. (ed). ''The Right in France: From Revolution to Le Pen''. Liverpool: Liverpool University Press, p. 224. {{ISBN|1-86064-916-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1930s his anti-republican prejudices made him a natural opponent of the [[Popular Front]] and his speeches showed him to be an [[Anti-Communism|anti-communist]], [[Antisemitism|anti-Semite]], [[Anti-Freemasonry]], and against the [[parliamentary system]]. In 1936 General de Castelnau, leader of the FNC, described Henriot as "an ardent defender of religion, the family and society."&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; At the beginning of World War II, he was strongly anti-German. However, in 1941 Henriot began to support [[Nazi Germany]] after it invaded the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Operation Barbarossa]], as he hoped for the defeat of Communism, believing that Bolshevism was the enemy of Christianity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Chadwick, p. 225.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propagandist==
In 1940, after the [[Military history of France during World War II|surrender of France]] to Germany, Henriot became active as a journalist working for the French government headed by [[Philippe Pétain]] which had removed to [[Vichy France|Vichy]]. In December 1943 he was appointed Secretary of State for Information.&lt;ref name="Hellman, p. 192"&gt;Hellman, p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; During his career he created programs and broadcast through [[Radio Paris]], becoming the government's spokesman. He developed a war of [[propaganda]] against the [[Free French Forces]] and the [[BBC]]; whose spokesmen were [[Pierre Dac]] and [[Maurice Schumann]]. Seeking to shape the perceptions of the French government and German occupation, and to destroy popular support for the [[French Resistance|Résistance]], Henriot was given the nickname of the "French [[Joseph Goebbels|Goebbels]]". He broadcast twice daily on Radio Vichy, "repeatedly and eloquently attacking all those he considered lukewarm in their attitude to collaboration and calling on all good Catholics to support the German cause in the fight against communism."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He continued the propaganda programmes after the Germans were forced, due to the new Allied presence in North Africa, to extend their military occupation in 1942 over Southern France, formerly the [[Zone libre|Free Zone]] controlled by the French government at Vichy. He warned the French people about any association with the Allies or "terrorists" (resistance groups) and countered the arguments of the Free French Forces broadcasting from the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.history.com/news/6-world-war-ii-propaganda-broadcasters 6 World War II Propaganda Broadcasters History.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote and delivered 270 broadcasts on Radio Vichy in a "mesmerising rhetoric and delivery" ... as a "huge media star", according to one source.&lt;ref&gt;[https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=AH%2FH034072%2F1 Philippe Henriot and the Last Act of Vichy: Radio Broadcasts, January-June 1944 UK Research and Innovation]&lt;/ref&gt;

"There is no doubt Henriot's broadcasts were influential, attracting a large and diverse audience."&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; It was said that "Henriot is listened to by everyone, enemies or supporters. Families shift their meal times so as not to miss him. There is no-one left in the street at the time he speaks."&lt;ref&gt;Hellman, p. 192-3.&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 January 1944, Henriot was appointed as the French Minister of Information and Propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick, p. 224-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, Henriot joined the [[paramilitary]] [[Milice]] "with a deep-seated conviction that Christian civilisation was engaged in a life and death struggle against Bolshevism."&lt;ref name="Hellman, p. 192"/&gt;

==Assassination==
Henriot was a natural target for the [[Résistance]]&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; and on 28 June 1944, in the Ministry building where he lived, he was assassinated by a group of COMAC members of the [[Maquis (World War II)|Maquis]], an organisation designated by the French government at Vichy as "terrorists". Disguised as members of the Milice, they had persuaded him to open his door. In retaliation, the Milice assassinated [[Georges Mandel]], a strong opponent of [[collaboration]]. Henriot was afforded a state funeral in Paris, presided over by [[Cardinal Suhard]] in [[Notre Dame Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Hellman, p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; His coffin was placed, surrounded by French flags and flowers, in front of the [[Hôtel de Ville, Paris|Hôtel de Ville]], where thousands filed past to mourn him&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|7gSD3KEuuzQ|Henriot funeral video clip}}&lt;/ref&gt; – less than two months before the [[Liberation of Paris]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3297">'''Project Clear Vision''' was a covert examination of [[Soviet Armed Forces|Soviet]]-made biological [[bomblet]]s conducted by the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]] under contract with the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. The legality of this project under the [[Biological Weapons Convention]] (BWC) of 1972 is disputed.{{where?|date=February 2013}}

==History==
===The operation===
Project Clear Vision was conducted between 1997 and 2000,&lt;ref name=enemark/&gt; during the [[Clinton Administration]].&lt;ref name=miller&gt;[[Judith Miller (journalist)|Miller, Judith]], Engelberg, Stephen and [[William J. Broad|Broad, William J.]] "[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9E02E1D71639F937A3575AC0A9679C8B63  U.S. Germ Warfare Research Pushes Treaty Limits]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', September 4, 2001. Retrieved January 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The project's stated goal was to assess the efficacy of [[bio-agent]] dissemination from bomblets.&lt;ref name=tucker/&gt; The program received criticism due to suspicions that its findings could possibly be used in a covert US [[bioweapons]] program.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Reportage===
The secret project was disclosed in a September 2001 article in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=enemark/&gt; Reporters [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]], Stephen Engelberg and [[William J. Broad]] collaborated to write the article.&lt;ref name=enemark/&gt;  Shortly after the article appeared, the authors published a book that further elaborated the story.&lt;ref name=enemark/&gt; The 2001 book, ''[[Germs: Biological Weapons and America's Secret War]]'', and the article are the only publicly available sources{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} concerning Project Clear Vision and its sister projects, [[Project Bacchus|Bacchus]] and [[Project Jefferson|Jefferson]].&lt;ref name=enemark&gt;Enemark, Christian. ''Disease and Security: Natural Plagues and Biological Weapons in East Asia'', ([https://books.google.com/books?id=bT9j6lhPHHUC&amp;pg=PA173&amp;dq=%22Project+Clear+Vision%22&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA174,M1 Google Books]), Routledge, 2007, pp. 173-75, ({{ISBN|0415422345}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==
As signatory to the BWC, the United States is committed to refrain from development of [[bioweapons]]. Moreover,
the US did not disclose the secret project in its annual confidence-building measure (CBM) declarations.&lt;ref name=tucker&gt;[[Tucker, Jonathan B]]. "[http://www.armscontrol.org/act/2004_10/Tucker.asp Biological Threat Assessment: Is the Cure Worse Than the Disease?]", ''Arms Control Today, October 2004. Retrieved January 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The US maintains that the program was fully consistent with the BWC because the project was defensive in nature.&lt;ref name=miller/&gt;

The '''Rastriya Janata Party Nepal''' ({{lang-ne|राष्ट्रिय जनता पार्टी}}; [[translation]]: '''National People's Party Nepal'''; {{small|abbr.}} '''RJPN''') is a [[political parties in Nepal|Nepali Political Party]] formed after the merger of [[Tarai Madhes Loktantrik Party]], led by the Mahantha Thakur, [[Sadbhavana Party]], led by the [[Rajendra Mahato]], [[Nepal Sadbhawana Party]], led by the [[Anil Kumar Jha]], [[Terai Madhes Sadbhavana Party|Tarai Madhes Sadbhawana Party]], led by the Mahendra Yadav, Madhesi Jana Adhikar Forum (Republican), led by Rajkishor Yadav and Rastriya Madhesh Samajwadi Party, led by Sarat Singh Bhandari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Post Report |url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-04-20/five-madhes-based-parties-unite-to-form-rastriya-janata-party.html |title=Six Madhes-based parties unite to form Rastriya Janata Party (Update)|website=Ekantipur |date=2014-12-01 |accessdate=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/kathmandu/five-madhesi-parties-unify-form-rastriya-janata-party/ |title=Five Madhesi parties unify to form Rastriya Janata Party |website=THT Online |date= |accessdate=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/news/18554/ |title=Glimpses of Rastriya Janata Party at birth |website=Nagarik News |date= |accessdate=2017-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Formation===
On 14 April 2017, six of the seven constituents of the Unified Democratic Madhesi Front agreed in principle to merge in a bid to form a strong force representing the [[Terai]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UDMF parties agree in principle to merge|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/news/18124/|website=Nagarik News|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was formed on 21 April, as the Rastriya Janata Party and Mahanta Thakur was announced as its chairperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Six UDMF constituents merge|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/six-united-democratic-madhesi-front-constituents-merge/|website=THT Online|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party on 26 April, changed its name to Rastriya Janata Party Nepal after it clashed with another party bearing the name Rastriya Janata Party, which later merged with [[Nepal Loktantrik Forum]], registered in the Election Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Newly formed RJP to change party name to avoid clash|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-04-26/newly-formed-rjp-to-change-party-name-to-avoid-clash.html|website=Ekantipur|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party registered at the [[Election Commission, Nepal|Election Commission]] on 7 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-07-07/rjp-n-all-set-to-register-at-ec-today.html|title=RJP-N registered at EC today|access-date=2017-07-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.onlinekhabar.com/2017/07/07/403129|title=RJPN finally files registration application at Election Commission – OnlineKhabar|access-date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Elections ===
The party had initially decided to not participate in the third phase of the local elections but changed their decision later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kathmandutribune.com/rastriya-janata-party-nepal-undecided-participating-province-2-election/|title=Rastriya Janata Party Nepal undecided on participating in Province 2 election|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en|website=Kathmandu Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party had the second highest candidates elected in [[Province No. 2]] with 1,112 candidates being elected. The party won 25 mayoral posts, including a win in [[Janakpur, Nepal|Janakpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-09-24/rjpns-raj-kishor-sah-elected-mayor-of-janakpur-sub-metro.html|title=RJPN’s Raj Kishor Sah elected mayor of Janakpur Sub-Metro|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[Nepalese legislative election, 2017|legislative and]] [[Nepalese provincial elections, 2017|provincial elections]], RJPN formed an alliance with [[Upendra Yadav]] led [[Federal Socialist Forum, Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/news/29894/|title=FSFN, RJPN sign poll alliance deal in Province 2|work=My Republica|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party won 17 seats in the [[House of Representatives (Nepal)|House of Representatives]] and finished with the fourth highest vote count in [[proportional representation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/news/32740/?categoryId=81|title=PR vote counting concludes|work=My Republica|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party won in key areas of their home province in [[Province No. 2]], including senior leader [[Rajendra Mahato]] defeating [[Ministry of Defence (Nepal)|defence minister]] [[Bimalendra Nidhi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/mahato-defeats-nidhi-dhanusa-1/|title=Mahato defeats Nidhi in Dhanusa 1|date=2017-12-10|work=The Himalayan Times|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was also one of five parties to be declared "national parties".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://peoplesreview.com.np/2017/12/20/only-five-parties-crossed-the-threshold-margin-in-pr-votes/|title=Only five parties crossed the threshold margin in PR votes - People's Review|work=People's Review|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party won 25 seats in the [[Pradesh Sabha|provincial assembly]] for [[Province No. 2]], 1 seat in [[Province No. 5]] and 2 seats in [[Province No. 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kathmandupost.ekantipur.com/news/2017-12-23/ec-allots-proportional-seats-of-provincial-vote.html|title=EC allots proportional seats of provincial vote|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/news/33048/?categoryId=81|title=UML, NC and Maoists win 75, 72 and 35 provincial assembly PR seats|work=My Republica|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the election, RJPN and [[Federal Socialist Forum, Nepal|Federal Socialist Forum]] announced that they would form a coalition government in [[Province No. 2]], with [[Federal Socialist Forum, Nepal|FSFN]] getting the post of Chief Minister and RJPN getting the post of Speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thehimalayantimes.com/nepal/fsf-n-rjp-n-agree-form-coalition-government-province-2/|title=FSF-N and RJP-N agree to form coalition government in Province 2|date=2018-02-06|work=The Himalayan Times|access-date=2018-03-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.myrepublica.com/news/36063/|title=Province 2: Chief Minister to FSFN, Speaker to RJPN|work=My Republica|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency (RIPE)''' is a [[translational research]] project that is [[genetically engineer]]ing plants to [[photosynthesize]] more efficiently to increase crop yields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/608535/to-feed-the-world-improve-photosynthesis |title=To Feed the World, Improve Photosynthesis |publisher=technologyreview.com |date=2017-08-14 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; RIPE aims to increase agricultural production worldwide, particularly to help reduce hunger and poverty in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Southeast Asia]] by sustainably improving the yield of key food crops including [[soybeans]], [[rice]], [[cassava]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/research-shows-how-to-grow-more-cassava-one-of-the-worlds-key-food-crops-68115 |title=Research shows how to grow more cassava, one of the world’s key food crops |publisher=theconversation.com |date=2017-01-24 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[cowpeas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://geneticliteracyproject.org/2018/01/23/plagued-pest-african-farmers-may-soon-access-bt-insect-resistant-gmo-pea-seeds-free/ |title=Plagued by pest, African farmers may soon have access to insect-resistant GMO cowpeas—for free |publisher=geneticliteracyproject.org |date=2018-01-23 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RIPE project began in 2012, funded by a five-year, $25-million dollar grant from the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/environment/redesigning-crops-for-21st-century-gmos#.dzn4bhm8y |title=Redesigning crops for the 21st Century |publisher=psmag.com |date=2015-08-05 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the project received a $45 million-dollar reinvestment from the Gates Foundation, Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, and the UK Government's [[Department for International Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.agri-pulse.com/articles/9864-ffar-joins-45m-project-to-boost-crop-yields-through-photosynthesis |title=FFAR joins $45M project to boost crop yields through photosynthesis |publisher=agri-pulse.com |date=2017-09-15 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, the Gates Foundation contributed an additional $13 million to accelerate the project's progress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.igb.illinois.edu/article/ripe-project-receives-additional-13-million |title=RIPE project receives additional $13 million |publisher=igb.illinois.edu |date=2018-11-20 |accessdate=2018-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Background==
During the 20th century, the [[Green Revolution]] dramatically increased yields through advances in [[plant breeding]] and [[land management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0262e/x0262e06.htm |title=Food for all |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This period of agricultural innovation is credited for saving millions of lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gatesfoundation.org/What-We-Do/Global-Development/Agricultural-Development |title=Agricultural Development - Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation |publisher=Gatesfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these approaches are reaching their biological limits, leading to stagnation in yield improvement. In 2009, the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] projected that global food production must increase by 70% by 2050 to feed an estimated world population of 9 billion people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/wsfs/docs/Issues_papers/HLEF2050_Global_Agriculture.pdf |title= Global agriculture towards 2050 |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meeting the demands of 2050 is further challenged by shrinking [[arable land]], decreasing [[natural resources]], and [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/the-plan-to-feed-the-world-by-hacking-photosynthesis-1715525456 |title=The Plan to Feed the World by Hacking Photosynthesis |publisher=Gizmodo.com |date=2015-06-24 |accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The RIPE project's proof-of-concept study established photosynthesis can be improved to increase yields,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/18/science/gmo-foods-photosynthesis.html |title=With an Eye on Hunger, Scientists See Promise in Genetic Tinkering of Plants |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2016-11-17 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in [[Science (journal)|Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/11/how-turning-plants-sunshield-can-grow-bigger-crops |title=How turning off a plant's sunshield can grow bigger crops |publisher=sciencemag.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Guardian]] named this discovery one of the 12 key science moments of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news-gazette.com/news/business/2017-07-16/uis-ripe-agriculture-project-aims-tackle-growing-problem.html |title=UI's RIPE agriculture project aims to tackle growing problem |publisher=news-gazette.com |date=2017-07-16 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer model simulations identify strategies to improve the basic underlying mechanisms of photosynthesis and increase yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/to-feed-the-world-we-may-need-to-hack-photosynthesis-1694078546 |title=To Feed the World, We May Need to Hack Photosynthesis |publisher=gizmodo.com |date=2015-03-28 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, researchers transform, or genetically engineer, model plants that are tested in controlled environments, e.g. growth chambers and greenhouses. Next, successful transformations are tested in randomized, replicated field trials. Finally, transformations with statistically significant yield increases are translated to the project’s target food crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://will.illinois.edu/news/story/ripe-project-shows-off-progress-in-photosynthesis-research/ |title=RIPE Project Shows Off Progress In Photosynthesis Research |publisher=will.illinois.edu |date=2017-07-14 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likely several approaches could be combined to additively increase yield. "Global access” ensures smallholder farmers will be able to use and afford the project's intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalaccess.gatesfoundation.org/ |title=Global Access |publisher=gatesfoundation.org |date=2016-11-17 |accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

!Research Strategies
!Description
|-
! Modeling Photosynthesis
|style="width: 80%;" |With the rapid increase in high-performance computing, it has become possible to simulate photosynthesis in dynamic models in which each of the coupled reactions is fully represented, providing a realistic in silico representation of the entire process with a system of linked differential equations. We have developed realistic renderings of the crop leaf canopies to more accurately predict the dynamics of crop microclimate and light energy distribution. We can now combine these two kinds of simulations into one robust modeling system. 
|-
! Relaxing Photoprotection
|style="width: 80%;" |Through [[photoprotection]], plants protect themselves against damage from high light exposure by dissipating excess light energy as heat. However, this protective process continues when the leaf is shaded by a cloud or by another leaf, which limits photosynthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Av0dTk9KzlY&amp;feature=youtu.be |title=Turning up plant efficiency |publisher=youtube.com |date= |accessdate=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; RIPE has identified and up-regulated the genes that speed up this relaxation, which has increased yield by 14%-20% in replicated field trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6314/857.full?ijkey=kSbj8WBMP5aU6&amp;keytype=ref&amp;siteid=sci |title=Improving photosynthesis and crop productivity by accelerating recovery from photoprotection |publisher=sciencemag.org |date=2016-11-18 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
! Photorespiratory Bypass
|style="width: 80%;" |Rubisco regularly makes the mistake of reacting with [[oxygen]] instead of carbon dioxide. The resulting chemicals must be recycled back into the production line, wasting energy. Some bacteria recycle these chemicals more efficiently. RIPE is engineering these more efficient bacterial pathways into crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.knowablemagazine.org/article/sustainability/2017/photosynthesis-fix |title=The photosynthesis fix |publisher=knowablemagazine.org |date=2017-12-15 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
! RuBP Regeneration
|style="width: 80%;" |The [[Calvin Cycle]], a key part of photosynthesis, is a multi-step process that regenerates the carbon dioxide acceptor molecule used by Rubisco to create sugar that fuels plant growth. Each step relies on protein catalysts known as [[enzymes]]. RIPE is optimizing the amount of each enzyme so that the entire photosynthetic process becomes more efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-06-incremental-discovery-day-photosynthetic-breakthrough.html |title=Incremental discovery may one day lead to photosynthetic breakthrough |publisher=phys.org |date=2017-06-29 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
! Improving Rubiscos
|style="width: 80%;" |RIPE has surveyed a wide range of plants and algae to find forms of Rubisco that are faster and less likely to mistake oxygen for carbon dioxide. The project is now engineering crops with these better-performing forms of Rubisco or modifying existing Rubisco to match these more efficient forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.feedstuffs.com/story-plant-enzyme-may-key-future-food-security-45-144493|title=Plant enzyme may be key to future food security
|publisher=feedstuffs.com |date=2016-07-27 |accessdate=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fareasternagriculture.com/crops/agriculture/enzyme-biodiversity-key-to-future-of-crops |title=Enzyme biodiversity key to future of crops |publisher=fareasternagriculture.com |date=2016-08-10 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/01/160128155105.htm |title=Enzymes with potential to increase wheat yields |publisher=sciencedaily.com/ |date=2016-01-28 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
! Optimizing Canopies
|style="width: 80%;" |Layers of crop leaves create a [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]], but the top leaves receive more light than they can use while the bottom leaves are starved for light. By changing the color and angle of the leaves, light is more evenly distributed throughout the canopy to increase photosynthetic activity throughout the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.farmfutures.com/story-lighter-colored-upper-leaves-may-crop-photosynthesis-hack-8-126107 |title=Lighter colored upper leaves may be crop 'photosynthesis hack' |publisher=farmfutures.com |date=2015-04-06 |accessdate=2018-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
! Algal Mechanisms
|style="width: 80%;"|[[Rubisco]] catalyzes the extraction of [[carbon dioxide]] from the air into sugar to fuel the plant's growth, but is limited by the supply of carbon dioxide. Using mechanisms from [[algae]], plants are being engineered to pump carbon dioxide to Rubisco to boost photosynthesis.
|-
! Mesophyll Conductance
|style="width: 80%;" |[[Mesophyll]] conductance measures how easily carbon dioxide can diffuse through the leaf to reach Rubisco. RIPE is modifying pathways to help carbon dioxide move through the cell membrane, cytoplasm, chloroplast envelope, and chloroplast [[stoma]] to reach Rubisco.
|-
! Advancing Translation
|style="width: 80%;" | Transformations are confirmed, from gene expression to production of the targeted proteins, and then phenotyped in the greenhouse and tested in replicated field trials. Once a trait is proven to be successful, we begin the more difficult and time-consuming task of transforming staple food crops, including soybeans, cassava, cowpea, and rice.

'''Red-baiting''', also '''''reductio ad Stalinum''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|t|ɑː|l|ɪ|n|əm}}), is an informal [[Fallacy|logical fallacy]] that intends to discredit the validity of an opponent's logical argument by accusing, denouncing, attacking, or persecuting an individual or group as [[communism|communist]],&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/red-baiting|title=Red-baiting - Definition of red-baiting by Merriam-Webster|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[socialism|socialist]], [[Marxism|Marxist]], [[Stalinism|Stalinist]] or [[anarchism|anarchist]], or [[Fellow traveler|sympathetic]] towards these ideologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/redbaiting|title=Redbaiting - definition of redbaiting by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the term "red-baiting" dates from at least 1927.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'' 23 August 1927 "City Crowds Silent On News Of Deaths"&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928, black-listing by the [[Daughters of the American Revolution]] was characterized as a "red-baiting relic".&lt;ref&gt;"New York Times" 3 April 1928 'D.A.R. Head Defends Order's Blacklist'&lt;/ref&gt; It is a term commonly used in the [[United States]], and in [[History of the United States|United States history]], red-baiting is most often associated with [[McCarthyism]], which originated in the two historic [[Red Scare]] periods of the 1920s ([[First Red Scare]]) and 1950s ([[Second Red Scare]]).&lt;ref name="Free Dictionary 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/redbaiting|title=Dictionary, Encyclopedia and Thesaurus - The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, red-baiting does not have quite the same effect it previously did due to the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Soviet-style Communism]],&lt;ref name=Boo&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/01/weekinreview/01leibovich.html?_r=1 retrieved 2/8/2010&lt;/ref&gt; but some pundits have argued that notable events in current American politics indicate a resurgence of red-baiting consistent with the 1950s.&lt;ref name="counterpunch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/wise08112009.html|title=Archives|work=www.counterpunch.org|accessdate=30 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613170005/http://counterpunch.org/wise08112009.html|archivedate=13 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Hedges2010/&gt;

The term "red" in "red-baiting" refers to the [[red flag (politics)|red flag]] as a symbol of socialism (including [[Democratic Socialists of America|democratic socialism]]), communism, Marxism and [[leftist]] politics in general (including anarchism, although its flag is [[Anarchist symbols|black]]). The term "baiting" refers to persecution, torment or harassment as in [[dog-baiting]].&lt;ref name="Merriam-Webster 2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bait|title=Baiting - Definition of Bait by Merriam-Webster|publisher=|accessdate=5 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===20th century===
Red-baiting was employed in opposition to [[Anarchism in the United States|anarchists in the United States]] as early as the late 1870s when businessmen, religious leaders, politicians and editorial writers tried to rally poor and middle class workers to oppose dissident railroad workers and again during the [[Haymarket affair]] in the mid-1880s. Red-baiting was well established in the U.S. during the decade before [[World War I]]. In the post-war period of 1919-1921 the [[U.S. government]] employed it as a central tactic in dealing with labor radicals, anarchists, communists, socialists and foreign agents. These actions in reaction to the [[First Red Scare]] and the concurrent [[Red terror]], served as part of the organizing principle shaping [[counter-revolutionary]] policies and serving to institutionalize [[anti-communism]] as a force in American politics.&lt;ref name=Hedges2010&gt;Chris Hedges, ''[[Death of the Liberal Class]]'' ({{ISBN|9781568586441}}). Nation Books, October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PCAPCIMA&gt;Ronald Edsforth and Larry Bennett (1991), ''Popular culture and political change in modern America'', SUNY PRESS, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-0765-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period between the first and second Red Scares was relatively calm owing to the success of government anti-communism, the suppressive effects of [[New Deal]] policies on radical [[organized labor]], and the [[patriotism]] associated with [[war effort|total mobilization]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=PCAPCIMA/&gt; Red-baiting re emerged in the late 1940s and early 1950s during the period known as the [[Second Red Scare]] due to mounting [[Cold War]] tensions and the spread of communism abroad. U.S. Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]]'s controversial red-baiting of suspected communists and communist sympathizers in the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]], and the creation of an [[Hollywood blacklist|entertainment industry blacklist]], led to the term "[[McCarthyism]]" being coined to signify any type of reckless [[political persecution]] or [[witch-hunt]].&lt;ref name="Free Dictionary 2010"/&gt;

The history of anti-communist red-baiting in general, and McCarthyism in particular, continues to be hotly debated, and political divisions this controversy created continue to make themselves felt. [[Conservatism in the United States|Conservative]] critics contend that revelations such as the [[Venona project]] decryptions and the [[FBI Silvermaster File]] at least mute if not outright refute the charge that red-baiting in general was unjustified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = In Denial: Historians, Communism, and Espionage | publisher = Encounter | year = 2003 | isbn = 1-893554-72-4 |last=Haynes |first=John Earl |author2=Harvey Klehr |authorlink1=John Earl Haynes |authorlink2=Harvey Klehr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Radosh, Ronald| title = The Persistence Of Anti-Anti-Communism| publisher = FrontPageMagazine.com| date = July 11, 2001| url = http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Printable.asp?ID=1491| accessdate = 2009-02-27| authorlink = Ronald Radosh}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Nicholas von Hoffman]] wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' that evidence revealed in the Venona project forced him to admit that McCarthy was "closer to the truth than those who ridiculed him".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas E. Woods]], The politically incorrect guide to American history, p. 170 {{ISBN|978-0-89526-047-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liberalism in the United States|Liberal]] critics contend that, even if someone could prove that the U.S. government was infiltrated by Soviet spies, McCarthy was censured by the U.S. Senate because he was in fact reckless and politically opportunistic, and his red-baiting ruined the lives of countless innocent people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author= Theoharis, Athan | title = Chasing Spies: How the FBI Failed in Counter-Intelligence But Promoted the Politics of McCarthyism in the Cold War Years | publisher = Ivan R.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, red-baiting does not have quite the same effect it previously did due to the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of Soviet-style Communism]],&lt;ref name=Boo/&gt; but some pundits have argued that notable events in current American politics indicates a resurgence of red-baiting consistent with the 1950s.&lt;ref name="counterpunch"/&gt; The [[federal government of the United States|United States government]]'s measures in 2008 to address the [[subprime mortgage crisis]], such as [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|TARP]], were not only criticized as "[[corporate welfare]]" but red-baited as a "gateway to socialism".&lt;ref name="TARP Is The Gateway To Socialism Doesn’t Add Up"&gt;[http://newledger.com/2009/04/morriss-claim-that-tarp-is-the-gateway-to-socialism-doesnt-add-up/ "TARP Is The Gateway To Socialism Doesn’t Add Up."

Some commentators argue that red-baiting was used by [[John McCain]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[presidential nominee]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States election]], when he argued that [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee Barack Obama's improvised comments on [[redistribution (economics)|wealth redistribution]] to "[[Joe the Plumber]]" was a promotion of "[[socialism]]".&lt;ref name=Hedges2010/&gt; Journalist [[David Remnick]], who wrote the biography ''The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama'',&lt;ref name="Remnick 2010"&gt;{{cite book| author = Remnick, David | title = The Bridge: The Life and Rise of Barack Obama | publisher = Knopf | year = 2010 | isbn = 1-4000-4360-3 | authorlink = David Remnick}}&lt;/ref&gt; countered that it should now be obvious that after one year in office Obama is a [[centre-left]] president and the majority of his policies are in line with the center-left Democratic tradition;&lt;ref name=AC360&gt;http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1004/09/acd.02.html retrieved 12/4/2010&lt;/ref&gt; while, in July 2011, ''[[The Fiscal Times]]'' columnist Bruce Barlett argues that an honest examination of the Obama presidency must conclude that he has in fact been a moderately [[conservative Democrat]] and that it may take 20 years before Obama's basic conservatism is widely accepted,&lt;ref name="Barlett 2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/Columns/2011/07/22/Barack-Obama-The-Democrats-Richard-Nixon.aspx#page1|title=Barack Obama: The Democrats’ Richard Nixon?|work=The Fiscal Times|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author and columnist [[Chris Hedges]] argues that the Obama administration's policies are mostly [[right-wing]].&lt;ref name=Hedges2010/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Hedges]], ''[http://www.truthdig.com/worldasitis/ The World as It Is: Dispatches on the Myth of Human Progress]'' ({{ISBN|9781568586403}}), a collection of original [[Truthdig]] columns, [[Nation Books]], November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Spencer Bachus]] claimed that 17 of his Congressional colleagues were socialists, but would only name one, [[Bernie Sanders]], who has been openly describing himself as a [[democratic socialist]] for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2009/04/spencer_bachuss_past_with_soci.html?hpid=sec-politics|title=The Sleuth - Spencer Bachus's Past With Socialists|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanders countered that [[Conservatism in the United States|American conservatives]] blur the differences between socialism and [[communism]], between [[democracy]] and [[totalitarianism]]. He argued that the United States would benefit from a serious debate about comparing the [[quality of life]] for the [[middle class]] in the U.S. and in [[Nordic countries]] with a long [[social democracy|social-democratic]] tradition like [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], and [[Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2009/04/22/and_socialism/|title=...and socialism|work=Boston.com|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, a number of conservative members of the [[Republican National Committee]] were pressing the committee and by extension, RNC chairman [[Michael Steele]], to officially adopt the position that the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] is socialist. Over a dozen members of the conservative wing of the RNC submitted a new resolution, to be eventually voted on by the entire RNC, that would call on the Democratic party to rename itself the "Democrat Socialist Party". If the RNC adopted this resolution, the RNC's official view would become that Democrats are socialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/apr/23/steele-urged-to-label-obama-a-socialist/|title=Steele urged to label Obama a socialist|work=The Washingtion Times|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the resolution:

&lt;blockquote&gt;RESOLVED, that we the members of the Republican National Committee call on the Democratic Party to be truthful and honest with the American people by acknowledging that they have evolved from a party of tax and spend to a party of tax and nationalize and, therefore, should agree to rename themselves the Democrat Socialist Party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.repconcaucus.com/content/proposed_rnc_resolution_recognizing_democrats_march_towards_socialism Proposed RNC Resolution Recognizing the Democrats' March Towards Socialism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On Wednesday 20 May 2009, supporters of the resolution instead agreed to accept language urging Democrats to "stop pushing our country towards socialism and government control", thus ending a fight within the ranks of the Republican Party that reflected the divide between those who want a more [[Centrism|centrist]] message and those seeking a more aggressive, conservative voice,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/20/gop-votes-to-condemn-demo_n_206052.html|title=GOP Votes To Condemn Democrats' "March To Socialism"|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the one expressed by the [[Tea Party movement]]. Frank Llewellyn, national director of [[Democratic Socialists of America]], argued that Republicans never really define what they mean by "socialism" and are simply engaging in the [[culture of fear|politics of fear]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/07/22/opinion/main5180886.shtml?tag=cbsnewsLeadStoriesAreaMain;cbsnewsLeadStoriesHeadlines|title=Socialism And The Politics Of Fear|date=22 July 2009|publisher=|accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, talk show host [[Glenn Beck]] began to devote what would become many episodes on his TV and radio shows, focusing on [[Van Jones]], a Special Advisor in President Obama's [[White House Council on Environmental Quality]]. Beck was especially critical of Jones' previous involvement in radical protest movements, and referred to him as a "[[anarchist communism|communist-anarchist]] radical".&lt;ref name="The New York Times 2009-09-06"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/us/politics/07vanjones.html?_r=1|title=White House Official Resigns After G.O.P.

The '''Saradha Group financial scandal''' was a major [[Confidence trick|financial scam]] and alleged [[political scandal]] caused by the collapse of a [[Ponzi scheme]] run by Saradha Group, a consortium of over 200 private companies that was believed to be running collective investment schemes popularly but incorrectly referred to as [[chit fund]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130501/jsp/bengal/story_16847319.jsp#.UYES6sV4800|title=Chitti chitti bang bang|date=30 April 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=1 May 2013|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://madlaw.in/what-exactly-happened-in-the-saradha-scam-understanding-chit-fund-mlm-corporate-deposits-and-collective-investment-schemes/|title=What exactly happened in the Saradha Scam?

==Background ==
{{See also|Banking in India}}
India has a large, low-income, rural population with limited access to formal banking facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-04-23/news/38763419_1_financial-inclusion-mobile-banking-banking-system|title=Ponzi schemes show failure of formal banking|date=23 April 2013|work=The Economic Times|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the absence of two major helplines for poorer people - that of placing their money safely in deposits and secondly of being able to borrow money for their needs which may be as simple as buying seeds for the next crop or their children's marriage. The second aim is achieved instead by a web of parallel, informal banking in the form of money lenders (pawn brokers) who have existed in India for a few centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Singh|first1=Pragya|title=The gullible travels show|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/magazine/story/the-gullible-travels-show/282215|accessdate=26 October 2017|publisher=Outlook}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its centre are moneylenders, mostly unregulated, often also wealthy landlords or now politicians, used to charge exorbitant rates of interest. To curb this practice, several Moneylenders Acts were enacted by the [[State governments of India]] by the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gupta|first1=SC|last2=Shankar|first2=Girish|last3=Giridhar|first3=A|title=Report of the Technical Group Set up to Review Legislations on Money Lending|url=http://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/PublicationReportDetails.aspx?ID=513|year=2007|publisher=Reserve Bank of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; However failure to replace the role of moneylenders gave rise to unscrupulous financial operators that operated Ponzi schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/04/2013427155533920295.html|title=Indian Ponzi scheme pushes many to penury|last=Chaki|first=Deborshi|date=28 April 2013|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators place the blame for these kinds of Ponzi schemes on greed rather than exclusion from formal banking systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.firstpost.com/business/dear-kc-chakrabarty-heres-the-real-reason-why-people-invest-in-ponzi-shemes-748689.html|title=Dear KC Chakrabarty, here's the real reason why people invest in Ponzi shemes|last=Kaul|first=Vivek|date=3 May 2013|work=Firstpost|accessdate=3 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-04-25/news/38817430_1_chit-fund-bank-accounts-sudipta-sen|title=Saradha fraud: Blame the RBI for the repressed formal financial sector|first=ET Bureau|date=25 April 2013|work=The Economic Times|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/XE1wN141lmaC2bzSjTEnaO/Lemming-nation-the-Saradha-scam-is-a-wakeup-call-for-inves.html|title=Saradha scam: a wake-up call for investors|last=Khanna|first=Sudeep|date=8 May 2013|work=LiveMint|accessdate=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this does not address the former issue of being able to save their money easily, keep it in safekeeping and invest it so that it grows. While post offices have tried to address this through [[Indian Post &amp; Telecommunication Accounts and Finance Service|postal savings banks]], people are often lured by Ponzi schemes that promise much higher returns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dalal|first1=Sucheta|title=Pyramid schemes - daylight robery|url=http://www.suchetadalal.com/?id=e90057ae-502a-1aea-4e034150291f&amp;base=sections&amp;f|accessdate=26 October 2017|publisher=Sucheta Dala|date=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relatively prosperous rural economy of [[West Bengal]] had previously relied on small savings schemes run by the [[Indian Postal Service]]. However, low rates of interest in the 1980s and 1990s encouraged the rise of several Ponzi schemes in speculative ventures such as Sanchayita Investments, Overland Investment Company, Verona Credit and Commercial Investment Company.

==Modus operandi of Saradha==

===Key people===
[[Sudipto Sen]] was the chairman and managing director of the Saradha Group.&lt;ref name=TGIndia1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130425/jsp/frontpage/story_16825378.jsp#.UX7JKsV4800|title=United departure, separated arrival|date=25 April 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sen was described as a softly spoken, charming, and forceful orator. At the time of his arrest, he was in his mid-50s. In his youth, he was known as Shankaraditya Sen, and was part of the [[Naxalite#Violence in West Bengal|Naxalite movement in West Bengal]].

The companies that were comprised by Saradha Group were incorporated in 2006.

Between 25 and 40% of the deposit was returned to these agents as commissions and lucrative gifts to quickly build up a wide [[Multi-level marketing|agent pyramid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/in-story-of-saradhas-crores-bengals-forgotten-hundreds/1108543/|title=In story of Saradha's crores, Bengal's forgotten hundreds|last=Das|first=Madhuparna|date=28 April 2013|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group used a nexus of companies to [[Money laundering|launder money]] and evade regulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-28/india/38877552_1_chit-funds-collective-investment-schemes-sebi|title=PM says unauthorized deposit collection has to be curbed|date=28 April 2013|work=The Times of India|accessdate=29 April 2013|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its accounts must be audited and it must also have explicit permission to operate from the market regulator [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] (SEBI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/in-bengal-s-grey-money-market-saradha-is-just-one-113042600611_1.html|title=In Bengal's grey 'money market', Saradha is just one |last=Acharya|first=Namrata|date=26 April 2013|work=[[Business Standard]]|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SEBI first confronted Saradha Group in 2009. Saradha Group adapted by opening up to 200 new companies to create more cross-holdings. This created an extremely complex tiered corporate structure to confound SEBI by hampering their ability to consolidate blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130423/jsp/frontpage/story_16817006.jsp#.UX6Qw8V4800|title=Saradha with 120 arms and blessings|last=Saha|first=Sambit|author2=Pranseh Sarkar |date=23 April 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2013|location=Kolkota}}&lt;/ref&gt; SEBI persisted in its investigation through 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-29/kolkata/38903346_1_senior-sebi-official-economic-offences-investigation-cell-order|title=Sebi's Saradha order came 3 years after probe started|last=Konar|first=Debasis|date=29 April 2013|work=The Times of India|accessdate=29 April 2013|location=Kolkata}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saradha Group reacted by changing its methods of raising capital.

===Building brand and non-financial businesses===

===Political patronage===
Allegedly several political leaders received financial support from Saradha Group, including MPs of TMC, the incumbent ruling party of West Bengal.&lt;ref name="EPW1"/&gt; MP Kunal Ghosh drew a salary of {{INRConvert|1.6|m|nolink=yes}} per month from Saradha Group, as an employee of the group.

==Collapse==
The earliest public warnings about the reckless and fraudulent CIS in West Bengal started in 2009 from MPs [[Somendra Nath Mitra]] and [[Abu Hasem Khan Choudhury]] and TMC leader [[Sadhan Pande]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-24/kolkata/38789399_1_trinamool-congress-chit-funds-kunal-ghosh|title=West Bengal chit fund scam: Knives out for tainted Trinamool MPs|date=24 April 2013|work=The Times of India|accessdate=29 April 2013|location=Kolkata}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the SEBI investigation, no executive actions were taken at this time. On 7 December 2012, [[Reserve Bank of India]] (RBI) governor [[Duvvuri Subbarao]] said the West Bengal government should initiate ''[[suo motu]]'' action against companies that were indulging in financial malpractice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Kolkata/Mamata-govt-feels-the-heat-after-the-chit-fund-meltdown/Article1-1048791.aspx|title=Mamata govt feels the heat after the Ponzi scheme meltdown|last=Roy Chowdhury|first=Sumanta|date=23 April 2013|work=Hindustan Times|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By that time, the Saradha Group Ponzi scheme was already beginning to unravel. In January 2013, the group's cash inflow was, for the first time, less than its cash payouts. This outcome is inevitable in a Ponzi scheme that is allowed to run full course. Sudipto Sen tried but failed to calm uneasy depositors and agents, and could not increase inflow of funds.&lt;ref name="TOI1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-23/kolkata/38761868_1_crore-chit-fund-agent-rs|title=Saradha chit fund mess: Quick-rich dreams lie crushed|last=Bandopadhay|first=Krishnendu|work=The Times of India|publisher=23 April 2013|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April 2013, Sen wrote an 18-page confessional letter to the CBI, in which he admitted that he had paid large sums of money to several politicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/328339/politicos-dock-over-saradha-scam.html|title=Politicos in dock over Saradha scam|first=DHNS|date=24 April 2013|work=Deccan Herald|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that TMC leader Kunal Ghosh had forced him to enter into loss-making media ventures and blackmailed him into selling one of his television channels at below market price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindishowbiz.com/MarathiMyPage.aspx?utubecode=cGrJqJnJhjE&amp;table=news&amp;chanel=&amp;pagenumber=1&amp;comment=TIMES%20NOW%20Exclusive:%20Sudipto%20Sen%20s%20letter%20to%20CBI%20on%206th%20April%2024%20April%202013%2005%20PM#.UX7gqcV4800|title=Times Now Exclusive: Sudipto Sen's letter to CBI on 6th April|date=24 April 2013|publisher=Times Now|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sen fled after posting this letter on 10 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=TNN|title=Sudipta Sen’s driver says TMC MPs met Saradha boss before escape|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Sudipta-Sens-driver-says-TMC-MPs-met-Saradha-boss-before-escape/articleshow/43283070.cms|accessdate=24 September 2014|work=Times of India|date=24 Sep 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his absence, the Ponzi scheme unravelled. On 17 April, around 600 collection agents claiming to be associated with Saradha Group assembled at the headquarters of TMC and demanded government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=TNN|title=Ponzi protests stall traffic|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Ponzi-protests-stall-traffic/articleshow/19732382.cms|accessdate=24 September 2014|work=Times of India|date=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despondency quickly spread across Bengal. A [[Times of India]] interviewee said, "'The entire Dakshin Barasat today looks like it was hit by a cyclone. Every home has a bankrupt depositor or a fugitive agent. People who were once friends became enemies. Happy households became miserable. Students stopped going to school. Traders lost interest in opening shutters. There is a sense of treachery that has replaced the warmth of a neighbourhood. Suddenly everything has become vicious."&lt;ref name="TOI1"/&gt; By this time, the Saradha Group financial scandal had colloquially become known as "Bonzi"{{mdash}}a portmanteau of the words Ponzi and Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130421/jsp/frontpage/story_16809931.jsp#.UX7l-cV4800|title=Bengal's Bonzi shell cracks up Panic strikes other schemes|last=Saha|first=Sambit|date=21 April 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and reactions==

===State government reaction===

====West Bengal====
On 22 April 2013 the [[Mamata Banerjee]] led West Bengal government announced that a four-member judicial inquiry commission headed by [[Shyamal Kumar Sen]], retired Chief Justice of the [[Allahabad High Court]], would probe the scam. The commission was named the Justice Shyamal Sen Commission of Enquiry (Saradha Group of Companies and other similar companies). West Bengal's Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was reported to have said, "ja gechhey ta gechhey" (whatever has gone has gone).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130423/jsp/frontpage/story_16817005.jsp#.UX7rvMV4800|title=What the govt balance sheet shows The words and deeds|date=22 April 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 April 2013, Banerjee announced a controversial {{INRConvert|500|c|nolink=yes}} relief fund for the low income depositors of the Saradha Group, introducing a 10% additional tax on tobacco products to raise the money and in jest asked smokers "to light up a little more".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130425/jsp/frontpage/story_16825376.jsp#.UX7vnMV4800|title=DIDI'S SIN TAX Rs 500cr plan to refund poor victims|date=24 April 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2013|location=Kolkota}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130426/jsp/opinion/story_16826315.jsp#.UX8AY8V4802|title=Editorial|date=26 April 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The propriety of the fund was later questioned by the Governor of RBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130509/images/09zzrbibig.jpg|title=Is Sardha tax fair RBI Chief asks|date=8 May 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The West Bengal government also set up a Special Investigation Team (SIT) u/s 36 of the CrPC, with officers drawn from the state's CID and Kolkata Police, to pool the criminal cases and investigate the Saradha Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tathagata Roy says sit is not doing good in sardha case.

On 22 April 2013, [[Assam Police]] sealed five offices of Saradha Group amid protests by depositors, agents and employees, and accusations that a minister, a former DGP and government officials had facilitated the group's business ventures in Assam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130424/jsp/frontpage/story_16820616.jsp#.UX7umMV4800|title=Company Offices Sealed in Assam|date=23 April 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2013|location=Guwahati/Bongaigaon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in West Bengal, where the probe is based on FIRs filed by defrauded depositors, the Assam Government ''suo motto'' registered 222 cases against Saradha Group and 127 other companies after widespread protests in Assam.

====Tripura====
On 9 May 2013, the [[Government of Tripura]] handed over all the cases involving deposit-collecting companies in the state to CBI and the Income Tax Department.&lt;ref name="Telegraph9513"/&gt;

===Central government reaction===
In March 2013, [[Ministry of Corporate Affairs (India)|Central corporate affairs minister]] [[Sachin Pilot]] said in the [[Lok Sabha]]{{mdash}}the lower house of the Parliament of India{{mdash}}that his ministry has received complaints against West Bengal's Saradha Group and many other companies for their involvement in Ponzi or multi-layer-marketing schemes.&lt;ref name="eoi1"/&gt; No action was taken until after the fraud was uncovered, when many measures were announced. On 25 April 2013, India's Income Tax department and Ministry of Corporate Affairs started separate investigation into the Saradha affair and similar Ponzi funds masquerading as NBFCs or CISs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130425/jsp/frontpage/story_16825969.jsp#.UX7vkcV4800|title=Corporate Affairs Ministry to probe Saradha group|first=PTI|date=25 April 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) registered a money laundering case under the provisions of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) at its [[Guwahati]] office because the Assam police has registered an FIR against Saradha Group to investigate depositors' allegations of financial irregularities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2013-04-25/news/38817381_1_chairman-sudipto-sen-saradha-group-enforcement-directorate|title=Saradha chit fund scam: ED registers money laundering case|date=25 April 2013|work=The Economic Times|accessdate=29 April 2013|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May 2013, commenting on the regulatory loopholes, the Chairman of SEBI said, "there should be one single regulator for entire collective investment schemes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/working-hard-to-save-investors-from-ponzi-schemes-sebi/article4672931.ece|title=Working hard to save investors from Ponzi schemes: SEBI|first=PTI|date=1 May 2013|work=The Hindu|accessdate=1 May 2013|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 May 2013, the Central Government set up an inter-ministerial group with members of the corporate affairs ministry, SEBI, Reserve Bank of India and officers from the Income Tax Department. The group is intended to unify the regulations of investment schemes by NBFCs, banks and companies, which {{as of|2013}} were governed by different laws and regulations, leading to regulatory loopholes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/cnbc-tv18-comments/saradha-scam-probe-panel-setto-fix-loopholeslaws-_866496.html|title=Saradha scam: Probe panel set up to fix loopholes in laws|last=Bannerjee|first=Ronojoy|date=7 May 2013|publisher=CNBC-TV18|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of the fraud, SEBI requested sweeping powers to investigate and prosecute fraudulent CISs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Money/5EInzuBGAyh4Km8CkgCgKM/Sebi-seeks-sweeping-powers.html|title=Sebi seeks sweeping powers|last=Lashkar|first=Anirudh|author2=Vyas Mohan |date=22 May 2013|work=Live Mint|accessdate=22 May 2013|location=Mumbai}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, the Central Government amended the SEBI Act and gave SEBI powers to search and seize without prior magisterial permission to investigate illegal money collection schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/sebi-working-on-regulations-to-incorporate-new-powers-113081900921_1.html|title=Sebi working on norms to incorporate new powers|last=Modak|first=Samie|date=19 August 2013|work=Business Standard|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/markets/sebi-enacts-stricter-laws-on-cis-front-running-113081201156_1.html|title=Sebi enacts stricter laws on CIS, front running|date=12 August 2013|work=Business Standard|accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political reactions and protests===
The crash of the Ponzi scheme and the publication of Sudipto Sen's letter led to a barrage of cross-party accusations. CPM accused TMC of associating with the 'chit fund', TMC alleged that Union Minister of Finance's wife Nalini Chidambaram had taken lawyers' fees from Saradha Group to incorporate its companies and should be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PTI |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-04-25/india/38816292_1_saradha-group-nalini-chidambaram-kunal-ghosh |title=Chit fund: TMC questions role of Chidambaram's wife in Saradha group |work=The Times of India |accessdate=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; TMC blamed CPM for letting Ponzi funds grow in Bengal.&lt;ref name="Letter"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130425/jsp/frontpage/story_16825380.jsp#.UX7vmsV4800|title=Many claims in letter – Sudipta Sen's missive to CBI|date=25 April 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic effects===
[[File:Fall of small savings due to ponzi.png|thumb|right|Graph shows the fall of savings in government schemes with the rise of Ponzi funds (figures on y axis are in Crores INR)]]

Companies illegally moving deposits diverted an estimated sum of {{INRConvert|240|b|nolink=yes}} from small savings funds promoted by state government since 2010. Official data show a steady decline in small-savings deposits and a rise in withdrawals, which left a reduced amount from which the state government could borrow. This affected the overall macroeconomic situation of the state; instead of being used by government for public funding, the money went into Ponzi schemes that were either diverted to foreign locations or were put to use for private gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130426/jsp/frontpage/story_16829615.jsp#.UX8AJMV4800|title=Snore &amp; drown savings bell&amp;nbsp;...

It was feared that legitimate non-banking financial companies and micro finance institutions would be stigmatised, leading to a vicious cycle of low depositor trust, higher interest rates, lower lending and a localised credit crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zeenews.india.com/business/news/companies/saradha-group-has-nothing-to-do-with-chit-fund-business-cfai_75158.html|title=Saradha Group has nothing to do with Chit Fund business: CFAI|date=29 April 2013|publisher=Zee News|accessdate=29 April 2013|location=New Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because most of the Saradha Group depositors came from the lowest economic strata, the loss of the investment would cause a further decrease in social mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-05-06/indian-ponzi-scheme-gets-a-political-bailout.html|title=Indian Ponzi Scheme Gets a Political Bailout|last=Chowdhury|first=Charandas|date=6 May 2013|work=Bloomberg|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scandal drew attention to similar illegal deposit mobilising companies, which are facing increased regulatory pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Industry/Z13LKAAQCWO5W5apSX3WYM/ICore-EServices-on-the-verge-of-collapse.html|title=ICore E-Services on the verge of collapse|last=Basu|first=Manish|date=6 May 2013|work=Livemint|accessdate=9 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/after-saradha-group-s-collapse-focus-on-rural-bengal-s-get-rich-schemes-359826|title=After Saradha Group's collapse, focus on rural Bengal's 'get rich' schemes|last=Pandey|first=Alok|date=27 April 2013|publisher=NDTV|accessdate=9 May 2013|location=Singur}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these companies have been variations of time share travel schemes, of which there are few clear regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130521/jsp/frontpage/story_16921023.jsp#.UZuZDMVhByM|title=Sebi and Rose hurl thorns in ad valley|last=Ghosh|first=Pinak|date=20 May 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=21 May 2013|location=Kolkota}}&lt;/ref&gt; These companies tried to register as cooperative societies to continue their financial operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.livemint.com/Industry/Veab8B9Gm8mqPvlhNVpPnM/Saradha-fallout-Bengal-firms-eye-cooperative-society-status.html|title=Saradha fallout: Bengal firms eye cooperative society status|last=Basu|first=Manish|date=20 May 2013|work=LiveMint|accessdate=21 May 2013|location=Kolkata}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criminal prosecution and ongoing investigations==

===Special Investigation Team (SIT), West Bengal Police===
FIR was filed against Sudipto Sen and Kunal Ghosh on 14 April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130427/jsp/frontpage/story_16833653.jsp#.UX8C1cV4800|title=Our proximity was our power|date=27 April 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around six officials from Saradha Group were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/India-news/Kolkata/Ponzi-fire-spreads-to-other-firms/Article1-1051702.aspx|title=Ponzi fire spreads to other firms|date=28 April 2013|work=Hindustan Times|accessdate=29 April 2013|location=Berhampore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was headed by the detective department of [[Bidhannagar Police Commissionerate|Bidhannagar police]].

===Justice Shyamal Sen Commission===
By mid-August 2013, the Justice Shyamal Sen Commission finished its initial compilation of the list of claimants. Around 1.74 million depositors filed claims with the Commission, of which 83% invested {{INRConvert|10000|nolink=yes}} or less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130819/jsp/frontpage/story_17246240.jsp|title=Saradha vow faces tricky sums|last=Basu|first=Kinshuk|author2=Pranesh Sarkar |date=19 August 2013|work=The Telegraph|accessdate=19 August 2013|location=Kolkata}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commission recommended that West Bengal state government sell the assets of Saradha Group and proportionally distribute the returns among defrauded investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/sen-panel-to-recommend-selling-of-saradha-assets-113080500214_1.html|title=Sen panel to recommend selling of Saradha assets|last=Basak|first=Probal|author2=Namrata Acharya |date=5 August 2013|work=Business Standard|accessdate=19 August 2013|location=Kolkata}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April 2014, the Commission had refunded 400,000 depositors who had invested less than {{INR}}10,000. The Commission received claims from 500,000 depositors who were defrauded by Ponzi funds other than Saradha; the Commission did not refund any of these depositors. In April 2014, Calcutta High Court sought a report from the Commission on the discriminatory standards being applied to the refunding of depositors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saradha more equal than others Court seeks annual report|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140422/jsp/frontpage/story_18265512.jsp|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Calcutta Telegraph|date=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central agencies===
On 30 April 2013 CBI started investigating into the Saradha Group scandal in Assam at the request of the state government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CBI starts investigation in Assam|date=30 April 2013|work=Bartaman|language=Bengali |location=Kolkata}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chit fund scam: CBI team to meet Assam Police in Guwahati|date=30 April 2013|publisher=ANI |location=Guwahati}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chief Minister of Tripura]] said Tripura may also order a CBI probe into Saradha Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/tripura-may-order-cbi-probe-into-saradha-chit-fund-scam/1/268553.html|title=Tripura may order CBI probe into Saradha chit fund scam|date=30 April 2013|work=India Today|accessdate=30 April 2013|location=Agartala}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In West Bengal, because the criminal investigation had not initially been handed over to the CBI, the [[Enforcement Directorate]] (ED){{mdash}}a Central Government agency which primarily probes money laundering{{mdash}}led the investigation on behalf of the Central Government. In April, 2014, ED arrested the absconding wife, son and daughter-in-law of Sudipta Sen, all of whom had been directors of various companies of Saradha Group. ED also questioned TMC MPs Ahmad Hassan and Arpita Ghosh about their financial transactions with Saradha Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chaudhury|first=Monalisa|title=ED contacts Trinamul MP|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1140423/jsp/frontpage/story_18269381.jsp|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Calcutta Telegraph|date=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ED alleged that West Bengal police has not cooperated with it and obstructed its investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saradha arrests: Non-cooperation charge may prove costly for state|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Saradha-arrests-Non-cooperation-charge-may-prove-costly-for-state/articleshow/33876460.cms|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Times of India|date=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Bengal government putting obstacles in Saradha probe to save Trinamool’|url=http://odishasuntimes.com/49120/bengal-government-putting-obstacles-saradha-probe-save-trinamool/|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=Odisha Sun Times|date=25 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=IANS|title=Mamata Banerjee government suppressing Saradha facts: Left Front|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/report-mamata-banerjee-government-suppressing-saradha-facts-left-front-1981761|accessdate=28 April 2014|newspaper=DNA|date=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2161">'''Scotlandshire''' is a term used&lt;ref&gt;The Scottish World: History and Culture of Scotland;p.168; by Harold Orel, Marilyn Stokstad, Henry Leonard Snyder, Published 1981 Abrams;  {{ISBN|0-8109-1630-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Old Men in Love: John Tunnock's Posthumous Papers; p.146; By Alasdair Gray; Published 2007 Bloomsbury; {{ISBN|0-7475-9353-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ferguson&gt;Scotland's Relations with England: A Survey to 1707; p.243; By William Ferguson; Published 1994 Saltire Society; {{ISBN|0-85411-058-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; to denote either the [[anglicisation]] of [[Scotland]] or the subordinate political relationship with [[England]]. It is recorded as early as 1706 in [[James Hodges (minister)|James Hodges]]' [[Acts of Union 1707|anti-Union]] ''Third Treatise''.&lt;ref name=Ferguson/&gt;

By placing the suffix ''-[[shire]]'' after the country's name, the term attempts to [[parody]] the [[early modern]] tendency to place the word ''-[[shire]]'' after some ancient Scottish regions, as well as implicating in a tongue-in-cheek manner that Scotland has the status of an [[English county]], rather than that of a distinct nation. Hence, the term is political in nature. 

Several historic regions of Scotland have at times had the suffix ''-shire'' added when Scotland broadly adopted English-style [[county council|county councils]] during the 19th Century.

{{Politics of the Netherlands}}

The '''Second Biesheuvel cabinet''' was the [[cabinet of the Netherlands]] from 9 August 1972 until 11 May 1973. The cabinet was formed by the [[List of political parties in the Netherlands|political parties]] [[Catholic People's Party]] (KVP), [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]] (VVD), [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] (ARP) and the [[Christian Historical Union]] (CHU) after the resignation of the [[First Biesheuvel cabinet]]. The [[Centre-right politics|centre-right]] [[rump cabinet]] served as a [[caretaker government]] until the [[Dutch general election, 1972|election of 1972]].&lt;ref&gt;{{nl icon}} {{cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/binnenland/ideeen-van-drees-jr-waren-te-afwijkend~a474846/|title=Ideeën van Drees jr. waren te afwijkend|publisher=Volkskrant|date=8 September 1998|accessdate=20 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==
Following the fall of the [[First Biesheuvel cabinet]] the [[Democratic Socialists '70]] (DS'70) left the coalition and the [[Catholic People's Party]], [[People's Party for Freedom and Democracy]], [[Anti-Revolutionary Party]] and the [[Christian Historical Union]] formed a [[Rump cabinet]]. Because the following negotiations for forming the next [[Den Uyl cabinet|cabinet]] took rather long, the cabinet took further reaching decisions than a caretaker cabinet is usually supposed to do.

The '''Socialist Propaganda League''' was a tiny socialist group active in London from circa 1911 to 1951.

The League was formed as a result of an early dispute in the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]] and of the optimistic belief of the Party’s founder members that the socialist revolution was near. A group of members around [[Henry Martin (socialist)|Henry Martin]] and Augustus Snellgrove wanted the Party to take a definitive stand on the attitude socialist [[Member of Parliament|delegates elected to parliament]] or local councils would take towards [[reformism|reform measures]] proposed by one or more of the capitalist parties.
[[File:Socialist Standard 1910 February WB Upton Park.png|thumb|Socialist Standard 1910 February WB Upton Park]]
In February 1910 a letter from "'''W.B. (Upton Park)'''" was sent to the ''[[Socialist Standard]]'' asking, {{quote|“What would be the attitude of a member of the SPGB if elected to Parliament, and how would he maintain the principle of ‘No Compromise’?”}} The perspective of this small group of members was that no reform of capitalism could ever be supported by the party claiming to represent working-class interests as it was not the job of socialists to take part in the running of capitalism. Any attempt to do so would run counter to the famous ‘hostility clause’ of the Party's Declaration of Principles. The ''Standard''’s reply on the matter, backed by the Party’s Executive Committee, stated that {{quote|each issue would have to be looked at on its merits and the course to be pursued decided democratically}}This did not satisfy the members who had raised the question, who formed a ‘Provisional Committee’ aimed at overturning the position espoused in the ''Standard''’s reply and who set their case out in an ‘Open Letter’ to Party members, arguing that socialists were required to oppose measures introduced by capitalist parties on each and every occasion. This was again rebutted firmly by the EC who contended that it would be ridiculous for socialists, by way of example, to oppose a measure designed to stop a war in which the working class was being butchered.

Believing this approach to be a violation of the principle of ‘no compromise’, several members resigned over this issue during 1911, a small number going on to found the Socialist Propaganda League.&lt;ref&gt;http://socialiststudies.org.uk/polemic%20upton.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The SPL’s principal speaker and writer was [[Henry Martin (socialist)|Henry Martin]], Snellgrove having been one of
those from the Provisional Committee later to rejoin the SPGB. Though Martin was sympathetic to the SPGB in all other respects, he continued to denounce the its willingness to engage in ‘political trading’ in pamphlets and on the outdoor platform until his death in 1951.

'''Soviet Border Troops''' ({{lang-ru|Пограничные войска СССР, Pograníchnyye Voiská SSSR}}) were the [[military|militarized]] [[border guard]] of the [[Soviet Union]], subordinated to its subsequently reorganized [[state security]] agency: first to ''[[Cheka]]''/[[State Political Directorate|OGPU]], then to [[NKVD]]/[[Ministry for State Security (USSR)|MGB]] and, finally, to [[KGB]]. Accordingly, they were known as '''NKVD Border Troops''' and '''KGB Border Troops''' (with [[Russian language|Russian]] abbreviations - НКВД СССР/- КГБ СССР added on the end of official names). Unlike border guards of many other countries, Soviet Border Troops also included the [[sea|maritime]] border guarding units (i.e., a [[coast guard]]).

The mission of the Border Troops included repulsing armed incursions into Soviet territory; preventing illegal crossings of the border or the transport of weapons, explosives, contraband or subversive literature across the border; monitoring the observance of established procedures at border crossing points; monitoring the observance by Soviet and foreign ships of navigation procedures in Soviet territorial waters; and assisting state agencies in the preservation of natural resources and the protection of the environment from pollution. Border guards were authorized to examine documents and possessions of persons crossing the borders and to confiscate articles; to conduct inquiries in cases of violations of the state border; and to take such actions as arrest, search and interrogation of individuals suspected of border violations.

They became the [[Border Service of the Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation]] on December 30, 1993.

==History==
In 1934, under the NKVD, Border Troops were immediately subordinated to the GUPVO (abbreviated "Chief Directorate of Border and Internal Guard"). In 1939 they were reorganized into the GUPV ("Chief Directorate of Border Troops").

NKVD Border Troops consisted of infantry, cavalry, reconnaissance, naval and airforce units.

Since the 1920s, the distinctive part of Soviet Border Troops uniform was the medium-green colored parts of [[headwear]] and insignia (Russian Empire's [[:ru:Отдельный корпус пограничной стражи| Separate Corps of the Border Guard]] has it distinction since 1893). The color is also present on a maritime Border Troops [[ensign]].

===World War II===
After the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], the Border Troops assisted the pacification of the newly acquired Soviet territory adjoining the state border. The mass execution of Romanian civilians known as the [[Fântâna Albă massacre]] happened at this time.

Border Troops units on the western USSR frontier saw particularly fierce combat in the first weeks of the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]] (June–July 1941). They bore the brunt of the initial [[Nazi Germany|German]] assault, and due to this, suffered high casualty rates. Border Troop servicemen were among [[Siege of Brest (1941)|the defenders]] of the [[Brest Fortress]]. Border troops from other parts of the Soviet border were also involved in the fighting of the war. Notably, the 105th, 157th, and 333rd Border Troops regiments (operating like regular army units) took part in the [[Battle for Berlin]] in 1945.

During and after the war, 150 border guards were awarded the title of the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] and over 13,000 of them were decorated with different orders and medals.

===Post-War history===
[[File:RIAN archive 482282 Mounted guards at frontier's alpine section.jpg|thumb|KGB Border Troops wearing the [[Spetsodezhda]] at the Khorgos Soviet-Chinese frontier post]]
[[File:Заграждение, КСП и ДОТ на белорусско-польской границе 01.jpg|thumb|Ploughed trace-control strip with a [[Security_alarm#Security_electric_fence|security electric fence]] KS-185]]
In wartime, the Border Troops would become a frontline combat service. The Border Troops also saw combat in 1969 in [[Sino-Soviet border conflict|border clashes]] with Chinese soldiers on islands in the [[Ussuri River]].

After the formation of the [[KGB]], Soviet Border Troops became subordinated to this agency and remained so until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. As such, the Troops were concentrating on the tasks of preventing [[espionage]] infiltrations. The Border Guards were involved in the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan]] and a number of them were even awarded the [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] for their bravery during these conflicts.

The Soviet border was the longest in the world and it comprised harsh terrain and climates; accordingly the Border Troops employed significant manpower, intensive maritime presence, and a dense and sophisticated system of field engineering devices. The most notable in that system was the [[trace-control strip]] ({{lang-ru|контрольно-следовая полоса}}) - a primitive labour-demanding method making surface crossing virtually impossible.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The Border Troops consisted of [[conscript]]s drafted by the same system as for the [[Soviet Army]], and a small number of professional enlistees. Officers were trained in specialized academies. Both conscripts and officer candidates for Border Troops were carefully selected and checked  by the [[KGB]]. This made service in the troops privileged.

*[[Pavel Zyryanov]], 1952-1956

*[[Pavel Zyryanov]], 1957-1972
*[[Vadim Matrosov]], 1972-1989
*[[Ilya Kalinichenko]], 1989-1991

==Legal authority==
[[File:RIAN archive 36147 "Trespasser" crossing the border.jpg|thumb|KGB border Troops dog in training exercise]]
The legal status, duties, and rights of the Border Troops were set forth in the Law on the State Border, confirmed by the [[Supreme Soviet]] on November 24, 1982. Article 28 defined the basic duties of the Border Troops. Their duties included repulsing armed incursions into Soviet territory; preventing illegal crossings of the border or the transport of weapons, explosives, contraband, or subversive literature across the border; monitoring the observance of established procedures at border crossing points; monitoring the observance by Soviet and foreign ships of navigation procedures in Soviet territorial waters; and assisting state agencies in the preservation of natural resources and the protection of the environment from pollution. Border guards were authorized to examine documents and possessions of persons crossing the borders and to confiscate articles; to conduct inquiries in cases of violations of the state border; and to take such actions as arrest, search, and interrogation of individuals suspected of border violations.

==Structure==
The Border Troops strength was estimated in 1989 to be in the range of 230,000 men. Although under the operational authority of the KGB, the Border Troops were conscripted as part of the biannual call-up of the Ministry of Defense, and their induction and discharge were regulated by the 1967 Law on Universal Military Service, which covered all [[Soviet Armed Forces|armed forces of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0535%29&lt;/ref&gt;

The Border Troops Directorate administered approximately nine border districts (pogranichnye okruga), which covered the nearly 63,000 kilometers of the state border. Border district boundaries were distinct from civil or military district boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0535%29&lt;/ref&gt;

The nine border districts were subdivided into detachments (otriady), covering specific sections of the border, border command posts (pogranichnye komendatury), passport control points (kontrol'no-propusknye punkty), and border outposts (zastavy).&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0535%29&lt;/ref&gt;

The border area was divided into a border zone, which included the territory of the district and settlements adjacent to the state border, and the border strip, which was approximately two kilometers in depth, running directly along the border. Only permanent residents or those who had obtained special permission from the MVD could enter the border zone. Entry into the border strip was forbidden without special permission from the Border Troops.&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0535%29&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maritime Border Troops of the Russian Border Troops operated within the twelve-mile limit of Soviet territorial waters. It was equipped with frigates and corvettes, fast patrol boats, hydrofoils, helicopters, and light aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0535%29&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 the [[103rd Guards Airborne Division]], [[Soviet Airborne Forces]], was transferred briefly to the Border Troops.

==Training==

Enlisted men were trained with their operational units, whereas officers were trained in special Border Troops schools, such as the [[Dzerzhinskii Higher Border Command School]] in [[Alma-Ata]] ([[Kazakh SSR]]) and the [[Mossovet Higher Border Command School]] in Moscow. Military-political officers received training at the [[Voroshilov Higher Border Military-Political School]], founded in the 1930s and located outside Leningrad. In 1972 a higher border military-political school was created in Golytsin, near Moscow. More recently, higher border command faculties were set up at the Frunze Military Academy and the [[Lenin Military-Political Academy]]. The period of instruction at the Higher Border Command and Military-Political Schools was four years. Officer candidates, who were screened carefully by their local KGB offices before admittance, took general higher education courses along with specialized military and political studies.

==Political Considerations==

Soviet sources repeatedly stressed that a border guard was not only a soldier but also a defender of Soviet ideology. His mission entailed sensitive political tasks, such as detecting subversive literature. To ensure a high level of discipline among personnel of the Border Troops, much attention was devoted to political training and indoctrination. For this purpose, a network of political organs, the Political Directorate of the Border Troops, was established within the Border Troops. It had political departments within all the border districts, detachments, and education institutions, and a network of full-time party political officers worked among all troop units. They conducted political study groups, gave propaganda lectures, and worked to increase the level of combat effectiveness among the troops.

===Famous former Soviet Border Troops===
* [[Alexander Lukashenko]], the [[President of Belarus]], served as an officer, 
* [[Mikhail Saakashvili]], the [[President of Georgia]], served as a conscript. 
* [[Vlad Filat]], the [[Prime minister of Moldova]], served as a conscript.
* [[Viktor Yushchenko]], the 3rd [[President of Ukraine]], served as a conscript.
* [[Konstantin Chernenko]], the second last Soviet leader ([[Secretary General of the CPSU]]) also served as a border guard on the USSR-Chinese border, before becoming more involved in politics.

==Dissolution and legacy==
With the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of Soviet Union]], Border Troops formations in most Soviet republics became border guards of the respective independent states. These new guards mostly changed their name and subordination. The new states of [[Armenia]] and [[Tajikistan]] are unique exceptions. Tajikistan's border with [[Afghanistan]] was guarded by the [[Border Guard Service of Russia|Russian Border Guard]] (engaging in heavy fighting) until the late 1990s under a special treaty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} [[Armenia]]'s border is still guarded by Russians under similar conditions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

In Russia and some other [[post-Soviet states]], the Border Troops retained some Soviet traditions, most notably the green shoulder boards on their uniforms and "Border Guard's Day" ({{lang-ru|[[:ru:День пограничника|День пограничника]]}}), an official holiday celebrated both by active service and former border guards.

More recently, [[social conservatism|social conservatives]] have used the term to more narrowly refer to measures that extend existing rights for heterosexual couples to gays and lesbians, such as in the case of [[same sex marriage]], or that include sexual orientation as a civil rights minority group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stone|first=Amy|title=Gay Rights At The Ballot Box|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=80iFUEYi8Q4C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=%22gay+rights%22+%22special+rights%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22gay%20rights%22%20%22special%20rights%22&amp;f=false|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|accessdate=June 10, 2013|location=Minneapolis|page=25|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tashman|first=Brian|title=Perkins Labels LGBT-Rights Initiative a 'Radical' Push for 'Special Rights for Homosexuals and Homosexuality'|url=http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/perkins-labels-lgbt-rights-initiative-radical-push-special-rights-homosexuals-and-homosexual|publisher=People for the American Way|accessdate=June 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cobb|first=Michael|title=God Hates Fags: The Rhetorics of Religious Violence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CHmSAL3UryQC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22colorado+for+family+values%22+%22special+rights%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9FS1UdnDL_Pd4APe8oGgCw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22colorado%20for%20family%20values%22%20%22special%20rights%22&amp;f=false|publisher=NYU Press|accessdate=June 10, 2013|pages=41|date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used internationally, for example ''Sonderrechte'' in [[Germany]], but it is used also about special [[right-of-way (traffic)#Priority (right of way)|traffic right-of-way]] exceptions given to emergency response and military vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Flashing blue and yellow lights | publisher=German Federal Ministry of Justice | url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/stvo/__38.html | accessdate=November 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal argument==
The basis behind the argument of the term is based on whether it should be considered just and legal for a law to treat various parties unequally. For example, in the [[US Constitution]] the prohibition on [[bills of attainder]] require that laws do not single out a single person or group of persons for specific treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Constitution of the United States: Article 1, Section 9 | url=https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html#1.9.3 | accessdate=2008-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the [[equal protection clause]] in the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]]. Both sides argue that the other side is or has traditionally been singled out and so the law is either needed or unnecessary.

In some cases, such as those with social implications, the universal definition of rights also often conflict with other, often more regional or local, laws that require certain public standards or behavior based on cultural norms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ioanna | last=Kucaradi | title=Universality Versus Particularity? In The Light Of Epistemological Knowledge Of Norms | publisher=United Nations University | accessdate=2008-11-24 | url=http://www.unu.edu/dialogue/papers/kucuradi-s5.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Libertarianism on rights and special rights==
In ''The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism'', Eric Mack states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A too-ready acceptance of alleged rights leads to an oppressive list of enforceable obligations. As the list of others' rights grows, each of us is subject to a growing burden made up of the obligations correlative to those rights; correspondingly the ability of rights to be protective of individual choice dissolves. Moreover, as the list of rights grows, so too does the legitimate role of political and legal institutions, and the libertarian case for radically limiting the scope and power of such institutions withers away. Libertarian theories of rights avoid generating an oppressive list of obligations through the employment of two crucial distinctions – the distinction between negative and positive rights and the distinction between general and special rights.&lt;ref name="Hamowy"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Definition of minorities==
[[Minority rights]] advocacy groups often contend that such protections confer no special rights, and describe these laws instead as protecting [[Civil rights|equal rights]],&lt;ref name="glaad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glaad.org/media/guide/offensive.php|title=Offensive Terminology to Avoid|publisher=GLAAD|accessdate=2006-05-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060301110310/http://www.glaad.org/media/guide/offensive.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to past conditions or legal privileges for specific groups.

The '''United Nations University Institute for Sustainability and Peace''' (UNU-ISP) is an institute of the [[United Nations University|United Nations University (UNU)]], a think tank for the [[United Nations]] system which provides a bridge between the UN and the international academic and policy-making communities. UNU-ISP is based at UNU headquarters in [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], with an Operating Unit located in [[Germany]] (UNU-ISP SCYCLE).

UNU-ISP seeks to achieve and promote a better understanding of three of the most pressing issues on the UN agenda: global change, peace and security, and development. With an innovative approach to sustainability, the work of the institute bridges these cross-cutting themes through research, educational and collaborative initiatives with the aim of solving current problems and anticipating future challenges.

== Overview ==
As an institute of the United Nations University, UNU-ISP is bound by the UNU Charter,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://unu.edu/administration/charter |title=UNU Charter }}&lt;/ref&gt; and guidelines set out by the UNU Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.unu.edu/council/ |title=UNU Council }}&lt;/ref&gt;
UNU-ISP works in collaboration with other UNU institutes and programmes, as well as through collaborative relationships with the global academic and policy-making communities.
Within the context of sustainability and peace, UNU-ISP:
* Conducts research; undertakes education, training and capacity development; and facilitates the dissemination of scientific knowledge and information to the United Nations and its agencies, to scholars and to the public.
* Provides opportunities for postgraduate students and professionals to obtain a wider understanding of relevant issues.
* Integrates the natural sciences, social sciences and humanities into a transdisciplinary approach that contributes to the development and strengthening of policy frameworks and management actions at all levels.
UNU-ISP offers a [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] programme, the Master of Science in Sustainability, Development, and Peace. This two-year programme addresses pressing global issues through an innovative interdisciplinary approach that integrates the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities.

== History ==

UNU-ISP became operational on 1 January 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://update.unuhq.info/2009/01/18/unu-launches-new-research-and-educational-institute-in-tokyo/  |title=UNU launches new academic institute in Tokyo : A newsletter of the United Nations University }}&lt;/ref&gt; to give an institutional identity and profile to the integrated academic activities of two former UNU programmes: the Environment and Sustainable Development Programme, and the Peace and Governance Programme. The institute combines the strengths in natural sciences, social sciences and the humanities of these two former programmes, and creates trans-disciplinary synergies that can more effectively address pressing global problems of human survival, development and welfare.

== Research ==
In line with the UNU Charter, the research of UNU-ISP addresses "global problems of human survival, development and welfare that are the concern of the United Nations and its agencies". UNU-ISP applies innovative, holistic approaches to identify sustainable solutions to such problems, cross-fertilizing natural science and social science methodologies through teams working on institute-wide, cross-cutting themes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
The institute conducts policy-relevant research into the following three thematic areas, while integrating overarching elements such as ecological security, human rights, gender, and governance:

=== Global Change &amp; Sustainability ===
The global change and sustainability focus of UNU-ISP seeks to clarify our understanding of sustainable development and the interaction among its constituent components – environment, society and economy.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Peace &amp; Security ===
UNU-ISP develops research addressing threats to peace such as violent conflicts, human rights abuses, organized crime, the spread of diseases, the proliferation of weapons and terrorism.

=== International Cooperation &amp; Development ===
UNU-ISP develops research addressing underdevelopment; underrepresentation in decision-making; economic and social inequalities both within and between states; and insufficient access to resources, healthcare, education, science and technology.

== Postgraduate Programmes ==

=== Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Sustainability, Development, and Peace ===
{{Advert|date=June 2011}}
UNU-ISP offers this Master of Science (M.Sc.) degree, intended for recent graduates, professionals and practitioners interested in the unique opportunity of studying at a global university within the framework of the United Nations.

The programme addresses pressing global issues of sustainability, climate change, development, peacebuilding and human rights through an innovative interdisciplinary approach that integrates the natural sciences, social sciences, and humanities. It provides students with the knowledge and skills to make important contributions towards solving global issues, whether through employment by UN agencies, other international organizations, governments, civil society, or the private sector.

A practically oriented, user-focused programme of the highest academic quality,{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} it offers opportunities to gain practical experience through internships or field research with a UN agency or other international organization. The programme builds on UNU’s strong record in training and capacity development, and utilizes the extensive network of scholars and academic institutions participating in UNU research.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

== Capacity Development ==

UNU-ISP has a strong commitment to capacity development, with a particular focus on enhancing the capacity of individuals and institutions in developing countries.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== UNU International Courses ===
Every year UNU-ISP organizes the regular session of its six-week UNU International Courses (UNU-IC) at UNU headquarters in Tokyo, Japan. The UNU-IC programme is designed for postgraduate students and young professionals (with a college or university degree) in various occupations in Japan and abroad who wish to pursue careers in international fields in public-service or private organizations, including the United Nations, multinational corporations and non-governmental organizations as well as national foreign service organizations. The courses are designed to provide analyses of global issues from both theoretical and empirical perspectives.

=== Global Seminar Series ===
The aim of the UNU Global Seminars is to enhance awareness about contemporary global issues and the role of the United Nations in addressing those issues. Students and young professionals are given the opportunity to interact with distinguished scholars and practitioners from Japan and abroad, and to explore a specific issue in depth through lectures and group discussions. These sessions are open to university students, graduate students and young professionals.

'''''Woman in Gold''''' is a 2015 [[biographical film|biographical]] [[drama (film and television)|drama film]] directed by [[Simon Curtis (filmmaker)|Simon Curtis]] and written by [[Alexi Kaye Campbell]]. The film stars [[Helen Mirren]], [[Ryan Reynolds]], [[Daniel Brühl]], [[Katie Holmes]], [[Tatiana Maslany]], [[Max Irons]], [[Charles Dance]], [[Elizabeth McGovern]], and [[Jonathan Pryce]].

The film is based on the true story of [[Maria Altmann]], an elderly Jewish refugee living in [[Cheviot Hills, Los Angeles]], who, together with her young lawyer, [[E. Randol Schoenberg|Randy Schoenberg]], fought the government of Austria for almost a decade to reclaim [[Gustav Klimt]]'s iconic painting of her aunt, ''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'', which was stolen from her relatives by the Nazis in [[Vienna]] just prior to [[World War II]]. Altmann took her legal battle all the way to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], which ruled on the case ''[[Republic of Austria v. Altmann]]'' (2004).

The film was screened in the Berlinale Special Galas section of the [[65th Berlin International Film Festival]] on 9 February 2015, and was released in the United Kingdom on 1 April 2015 and in the United States on 10 April.&lt;ref name=festival&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Rosser|title=The Woman in Gold, starring Helen Mirren, and Anton Corbijn’s Life, starring Robert Pattinson and Dane DeHaan, to world premiere at Berlinale|url=http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/berlin/berlin-2015-woman-in-gold-life-to-world-premiere/5081850.article|work=Screen Daily|accessdate=7 June 2015|date=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In a series of flashbacks throughout the film, [[Maria Altmann]] recalls [[Anschluss|the arrival of Nazi forces in Vienna]], and the subsequent persecution of [[Judaism in Austria|the Jewish community]] and the [[Nazi plunder|looting and pillaging conducted by the Nazis]] against Jewish families. Seeking to escape before the country is completely shut off, Maria Altmann and members of her family attempt to flee to the United States. While Altmann and her husband are successful in their escape, she is forced to abandon her parents in Vienna.

In the present, living in Los Angeles, a now elderly and widowed Altmann attends the funeral for her sister. She discovers letters in her sister's possession dating to the late 1940s, which reveal an attempt to recover artwork owned by the Bloch-Bauer family that was left behind during the family's flight for freedom and subsequently stolen by the [[Nazi]]s. Of particular note is a painting of Altmann's aunt, Adele Bloch-Bauer, now known in Austria as the "Woman in Gold".

Altmann enlists the help of [[E. Randol Schoenberg]] (the son of her close friend, Barbara), a lawyer with little experience, to make a claim to the [[art restitution]] board in Austria. Reluctantly returning to her homeland, Altmann discovers that the country's minister and art director are unwilling to part with the painting, which they feel has become part of the national identity. Altmann is told that the painting was in fact legitimately willed to the gallery by her aunt. Upon further investigation by her lawyer and Austrian journalist [[Hubertus Czernin]], this claim proves to be incorrect, as the alleged will is invalid due to the fact that her aunt did not own the painting in question, the artist's fee having been paid by Altmann's uncle; moreover, Adele Bloch-Bauer wanted the painting to go to the museum at her husband's death while in fact it was taken from him by the Nazis and placed in the museum by a Nazi-collaborating curator, well before his death. Schoenberg files a challenge with the art restitution board, but it is denied and Altmann does not have the money needed to challenge the ruling. Defeated, she and Schoenberg return to the United States.

Months thereafter, happening upon an art book with "Woman in Gold" on the cover, Schoenberg has an epiphany. Using a narrow rule of law and precedents in which an art restitution law was retroactively applied, Schoenberg files a claim in US court against the Austrian government contesting their claim to the painting. An appeal goes to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], where in the matter of ''[[Republic of Austria v. Altmann]]'', the court rules in Altmann's favor, which results in the Austrian government attempting to persuade Altmann to retain the painting for the gallery, which she refuses. After a falling out over the issue of returning to Austria for a second time to argue the case, Altmann agrees for Schoenberg to go and argue the case in front of an arbitration panel of three arbiters in Vienna.

In Austria, the arbitration panel hears the case, during which Schoenberg reminds them of the Nazi regime's war crimes. He implores the arbitration panel to think of the meaning of the word "restitution" and to look past the artwork hanging in art galleries to see the injustice to the families who once owned such great paintings and were forcibly separated from them by the Nazis. Unexpectedly, Altmann arrives during the session, indicating to Czernin that she came to support her lawyer. After considering both sides of the dispute, the arbitration panel rules in favour of Altmann, returning her paintings. The Austrian government representative makes a last-minute proposal begging Altmann to keep the paintings in the Belvedere against a generous compensation. Altmann refuses and elects to have the painting moved to the United States with her ("They will now travel to America like I once had to as well"), and takes up an offer made earlier by [[Ronald Lauder]] to acquire them for his New York gallery to display the painting on condition that it be a permanent exhibit.

In the film's limited release weekend, 3–5 April, it grossed $2.1 million from 258 cinemas. In its wide release weekend, expanding to 1,504 cinemas on 10 April it grossed $5.5 million, finishing 7th at the box office.

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film had a rating of 55% based on 146 reviews, with an average rating of 6/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Woman in Gold'' benefits from its talented leads, but strong work from Helen Mirren and Ryan Reynolds isn't enough to overpower a disappointingly dull treatment of a fascinating true story."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/woman_in_gold/ |title=Woman in Gold |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=11 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]] the film has a weighted average score of 51 out of 100, based on 31 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/woman-in-gold|title=Woman in Gold Reviews|work=Metacritic|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=9 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref&gt;http://deadline.com/2015/04/furious-7-the-longest-ride-nicholas-sparks-box-office-1201408312/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accolades===

==Historical accuracy==
Altmann's efforts actually addressed five Klimt paintings owned by her family, including ''Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I'' and ''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II]]'', as well as three landscapes. The decisions by the US Supreme Court and the Austrian arbitrators covered all five paintings. 

Film critics in Austria and Germany noted various deviations of the film from historical reality. Olga Kronsteiner from the Austrian daily ''[[Der Standard]]'' wrote that, contrary to the film, it was not Maria Altmann's lawyer, Randol Schönberg, who researched and initiated the restitution case, but Austrian journalist [[Hubertus Czernin]], who had worked on a number of restitution files at the time, who found the decisive documents and subsequently informed Maria Altmann.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kronsteiner|first=Olga|title="Die Frau in Gold": Faktentreue ist eine schlechte Dramaturgin|url=http://derstandard.at/2000016549464/Die-Frau-in-Gold-Faktentreue-ist-eine-schlechte-Dramaturgin|work=Der Standard|date=29 May 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hubertus Czernin, who is depicted in the movie, is suggested to have been motivated by the fact that his father had been a member of the Nazi Party; but Stefan Grissemann from Austrian weekly ''[[Profil (magazine)|Profil]]'' pointed out that his father's party membership was not known to Czernin until 2006, long after he had started to work on this and other restitution cases; and that in addition Czernin's father was imprisoned by the Nazis late in the war for high treason.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Thomas Trenkler from the Viennese daily ''[[Kurier]]'' criticized the film's reference to a time limit for restitution claims in Austria, writing that there has never been such a time limit. He also wrote that his least favorite scene in the film was when Maria Altmann leaves her ailing father in Vienna in 1938. Despite the imminent danger, Maria Altmann stayed in Vienna, having said, "I would never have left my father! He died of natural causes in July 1938". Only then did she and her husband escape from Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Trenkler|first=Thomas|title=Der Fall "Goldene Adele", tendenziös erzählt|url=http://kurier.at/kultur/film/der-fall-goldene-adele-tendenzioes-erzaehlt/133.872.218|work=[[Kurier]]|date=2 June 2015|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, based on an earlier agreement between Altmann and [[Ronald Lauder]] (which was shown in the film), Altmann sold ''Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I'' to Lauder's [[Neue Galerie]] in New York for $135 million (${{Inflation|US|135|2006|r=0}} million today), setting a new mark for [[List of most expensive paintings|most expensive painting]] (since surpassed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Patricia|title=The Story Behind ‘Woman in Gold’: Nazi Art Thieves and One Painting’s Return|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/31/arts/design/the-story-behind-woman-in-gold-nazi-art-thieves-and-one-paintings-return.html?_r=0|accessdate=6 December 2015|publisher=The New York Times|date=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five months later, Altmann sold the companion ''Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II'' at auction (bought by [[Oprah Winfrey]]) for almost $88 million (${{Inflation|US|88|2006|r=0}} million today), then the fourth-highest priced painting.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Michaud, "Christie's stages record art sale," Reuter's, 9 November 2006.

==Objectives and ideology==
Workers' Front aims to become a broad progressive front, dedicated to radical change of [[politics|political]], [[economy|economic]] and [[society|social]] relations, while fighting for the [[labor rights|rights of working people]] and all the oppressed.

Workers' Front is trying to coordinate various "[[progressive politics|progressive]] struggles" – struggle for workers' rights and [[economic democracy]], [[anti-capitalism]], [[anti-fascism]], struggle for [[women's rights|women's]] and [[LGBT]] rights, [[ecology]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.criticatac.ro/lefteast/left-rising-in-croatia-interview-demian-voksi/ | title = The left is rising again in Croatia: an interview with Demian Vokši | publisher = [[LeftEast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.radnicka-fronta.org/o-radnickoj-fronti/workers-front-croatia/ | title = Workers Front – About }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lefteast2"/&gt;

Workers' Front has been compared to Spanish [[Podemos (Spanish political party)|Podemos]] and Greek [[SYRIZA]] by the local and regional media.&lt;ref name="lefteast2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.criticatac.ro/lefteast/the-formation-of-the-workers-front-croatia-revolution-if-necessary/ | title =  The formation of the Workers’ Front (Croatia): "Revolution, if necessary" | publisher = [[LeftEast]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://novine.novilist.hr/default.asp?WCI=Rubrike&amp;WCU=285D28632859285A2863285A28582859285C28632893289328632863285F285A285F285F285F285B28632863286328592863O | language = Croatian | title =  I mi možemo! | trans-title = And we can! | publisher = [[Novi List]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.novilist.hr/Komentari/Radnicka-fronta-tko-konta-konta | language = Croatian | title =  Radnička fronta – Radnička fronta – tko konta, konta | trans-title = Workers' front – who understands – understands | publisher = [[Novi List]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Spektar/tabid/94/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/266973/Default.aspx | language = Croatian | title =  Damir Pilić: SYRIZA, Podemos, Radnička fronta | publisher = [[Slobodna Dalmacija]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 3 October 2015 it was announced on the Workers' Front [[web site]] that the party has been disbanded after an attempted purge by a prominent member of the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.radnicka-fronta.org/|title=Priopćenje o raspuštanju Radničke fronte|date=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/radnicka-fronta-vise-ne-postoji/1430729/|title=Radnička fronta više ne postoji|date=3 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Workers' Front remained an officially registered party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://registri.uprava.hr/#!stranke|language = Croatian|title =Registar političkih stranaka u Republici Hrvatskoj}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on with its activities, issuing a statement that its [[web site]] was taken over by a group trying to disband the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Hrvatska/tabid/66/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/301803/Default.aspx|language = Croatian|title = Radnička fronta: Ne raspadamo se, hakirala su nas četvorica članova|trans-title = Workers' Front: We're not falling apart, we got hacked by four members| publisher = [[Slobodna Dalmacija]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later this version of events, namely that the party still exists and that the web site was in control of a group of [[dissident]]s, was confirmed by a member of the dissident group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hr.n1info.com/a79869/Vijesti/Rade-Dragojevic-U-Radnickoj-fronti-doslo-je-do-cistke-stize-nova-stranka.html|language = Croatian|title = U Radničkoj fronti došlo je do čistke, stiže nova stranka}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this episode,  Workers' Front participated in an [[anticlerical]] [[protest]] in Zagreb,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novilist.hr/Vijesti/Hrvatska/Stotinjak-gradana-prosvjedovalo-protiv-Vatikanskih-ugovora|language = Croatian|title = Stotinjak građana prosvjedovalo protiv Vatikanskih ugovora }}&lt;/ref&gt; tried to place, but was denied a [[billboard]] featuring [[Ivica Todorić]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tportal.hr/vijesti/parlamentarni-izbori-2015/400977/Radnicka-fronta-Cenzuriran-nam-je-plakat-s-Todoricem.html|language = Croatian|title = Radnička fronta: Cenzuriran nam je plakat s Todorićem!}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the richest person in Croatia) and successfully registered for [[Croatian parliamentary election, 2015|2015 parliamentary election]] in three [[Croatian Parliament electoral districts|electoral districts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.izbori.hr/140zas/kandid/1/kandid.html|language = Croatian|title = IZBORI ZA ZASTUPNIKE U HRVATSKI SABOR 2015. – KANDIDATURA| trans-title = CROATIAN PARLIAMENTARY ELECTION, 2015 – CANDIDACY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following months, the party helped organize an antifascist demonstration against far-right groups celebrating the Nazi collaborator in Croatia, [[Ante Pavelić]], during a church mass for Pavelić. The protest was assaulted by supporters of the Croatian far-right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacional.hr/radnicka-fronta-odrzan-prosvjed-zbog-misa-zadusnica-za-pavelica/|title=RADNIČKA FRONTA: Održan prosvjed zbog misa zadušnica za Pavelića|trans-title= WORKERS' FRONT: Protest held over the memorial service for Pavelić|language=Croatian|publisher=[[Nacional (weekly)|Nacional]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after that, Workers' Front staged the first organized cutting of the [[Slovenian border barrier|razor wire planted along the Croatia-Slovenia border]], together with Slovenian activists in a cross-border demonstration of solidarity. The action was widely reported by regional media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revolution-news.com/croatian-slovenian-activists-met-to-cut-border-fence/| title=Croatian &amp; Slovenian Activists Met to Cut Border Fence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2016 the Workers' Front held a protest against the [[Cabinet of Tihomir Orešković|new government]], particularly [[Ministry of Culture (Croatia)|Minister of Culture]] [[Zlatko Hasanbegović]], on [[St. Mark's Square, Zagreb]] with over 1000 participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In March 2017, Workers' Front announced their coalition with [[New Left (Croatia)|New Left]] for the upcoming [[Croatian local elections, 2017|local elections]] in [[Split, Croatia|Split]] and [[Zagreb]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.portalnovosti.com/radnicka-fronta-i-nova-ljevica-zajedno-na-izborima-u-zagrebu | language = Croatian | title = Radnička fronta i Nova ljevica zajedno na izborima u Zagrebu }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Zagreb local elections, 2017|Zagreb election]] Workers' Front ran in coalition with ''Zagreb is Ours'', [[New Left (Croatia)|New Left]], [[Sustainable Development of Croatia]] and ''For the City'' which won 7.64% votes and 4 seats in the [[Zagreb Assembly|Zagreb City Assembly]], one of which belongs to Workers' Front. In [[Split local elections, 2017|Split election]], the Workers' Front-New Left coalition won 4.36% of votes, failing to enter the city council.

On 8 September 2018, the Workers' Front signed a declaration of mutual cooperation with [[New Left (Croatia)|New Left]], [[Sustainable Development of Croatia]] and the [[Socialist Labor Party of Croatia]] in [[Šibenik]], [[Croatia]]. The '''Šibenik Declaration''' ([[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Šibenska deklaracija'') contains various criticisms of Croatian society, as well as that of the current capitalist system in general, on which all the signing parties agree on and gather around. The Workers' Front, however, had implemented an article in the document which only it signed as the other parties found it unappealing for their programmes, it reads as follows:

{{quote|Radical change demands the dismantling of the two opposing classes - the capitalist (those that hold a monopoly on the means of production - banks, corporations, factories, trade centers, hotels, etc. - and make their profit on the labor of others) and the working class (those that sell their labor to survive).

This policy takes it as necessary: reindustrialization in the interest of all; guarantee of workplaces; encouragement of industrial policy that puts in motion and connects the various industrial branches; monetary and fiscal policy in function of industry; the implementation of [[Workers' self-management]] and participation in their workplaces, no matter their ownership.

Democracy must stop being a phrase under which capital conceals its dictatorship and must become social reality under which the interests of the working peoples are realised. Hence, it is necessary to halt all privatisation of public services and goods, and to nationalize all the fundamental resources of public importance by placing the control of the services in the hands of the workers, the people. |Workers' Front, ''[[The Šibenik Declaration]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://radnickafronta.hr/citaonica/clanci/890-rf-potpisala-sibensku-deklaraciju-uz-izdvojeno-misljenje|"The Workers' Front signed the Šibenik Declaration"] (in Croatian)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Zambezi [[river basin]] is used by all these South African countries; this plan attempts to manage resources collectively amongst, and between SADCC Nations to reasonably meet national, and international goals for water resources.&lt;ref name="sardc.net" /&gt; Due to the immense river basin formed by the Zambezi River together with its tributaries, the Zambezi River System Plan is a culmination of a UN commission, to focus on the projection that the demand for the basins water resources would increase. This competition creates negative utilization, and inefficient use of resources for all these countries in a profitable manner.&lt;ref name="sardc.net" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washington.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hallway.evans.washington.edu/cases/disagreements-behind-agreement |title=Treatise|website=hallway.evans.washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early negotiations of ZACPLAN started in the early 1980s to come up with goals to prioritize in utilizing the Zambezi River Basin. A listing of goals in the form of category I project, and category II project were devised. Initial discussions relating to the category I and category II projects were initially disagreed upon, as political relations between resources, and countries could not come to an agreements of initial projects.&lt;ref name="washington.edu"/&gt;

{{wiktionary}}
The grapheme '''Ć''' ([[Lower case|minuscule]]: '''ć'''), formed from [[C]] with the addition of an [[acute accent]], is used in various languages. It usually denotes {{IPA|[t͡ɕ]}}, the [[voiceless alveolo-palatal affricate]], including in [[phonetic transcription]]. Its [[Unicode]] codepoints are U+0106 for Ć and U+0107 for ć.

The symbol originated in the [[Polish alphabet]] (where, in its modern usage, it appears most often at the ends of words) and was adopted by Croatian linguist [[Ljudevit Gaj]] into [[Serbo-Croatian]] in the 19th century. It is the fifth letter of the [[Polish alphabet|Polish]], [[Sorbian alphabet|Sorbian]], and [[Gaj's Latin alphabet|the Latin alphabet]] of [[Serbo-Croatian language]], as well as its slight variant, the [[Montenegrin alphabet|Montenegrin Latin alphabet]]. It is fourth in the [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] [[Belarusian Latin alphabet|Łacinka alphabet]].

It is also adopted by [[Wymysorys language|Wymysorys]] a West-Germanic language spoken in Poland. It is also the fifth letter of the Wymysorys alphabet.

In [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], it occurs only in loanwords, mainly from Serbo-Croatian (such as the surname [[Handanović]]), and denotes the same sound as [[Č]], i.e. the [[voiceless palato-alveolar affricate]].

The [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet]] equivalent is [[Ћ]] (23rd letter). [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] uses [[Ќ]] as a partial equivalent (24th letter). Other languages which use the Cyrillic alphabet usually represent this sound by the character combination [[Ч]][[Ь]].

Such letter is also used in unofficial Belarusian [[Łacinka]] where it represents soften diphthong ''ts''.
