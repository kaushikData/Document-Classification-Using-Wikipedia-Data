The '''389 Directory Server''' (previously '''Fedora Directory Server''') is an LDAP ([[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol]]) server developed by [[Red Hat]] as part of Red Hat's community-supported [[Fedora Project]]. The name "389" derives from the [[port number]] used by LDAP. 

389 Directory Server supports many operating systems, including [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] and [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] 3 and later, [[Debian]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] 8 and later, and [[HP-UX]] 11i.{{cn|date=September 2017}} In late 2016 the project merged experimental [[FreeBSD]] support.&lt;ref name=389pagurefreebsd&gt;{{ cite web

| url = https://pagure.io/389-ds-base/issue/48797
| accessdate = 2017-04-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the 389 Directory Server team as of 2017 is likely to remove HPUX and Solaris support in the upcoming 1.4.x series.&lt;ref name=389usersmailinglist&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The 389 source code is generally available under the [[Gplv3#Version 3|GNU General Public License version 3]]; some components have an exception for plugin code, while other components use [[LGPL]]v2 or [[Apache License|Apache]]. Red Hat also markets a commercial version of the project as '''Red Hat Directory Server''' as part of support contracts for RHEL.

==History==
389 Directory Server is the newest incarnation of what was once the original [[University of Michigan]] [[slapd]] project. In 1996, the project's developers were hired by [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] and the project became known as the '''Netscape Directory Server''' (NDS). After acquiring Netscape, [[AOL]] sold ownership of the NDS [[intellectual property]] to [[Sun Microsystems]], but retained ''rights akin to ownership''. Sun sold and developed the Netscape Directory Server under the name JES/SunOne Directory Server, now Oracle Directory Server since the takeover of Sun by Oracle. AOL/Netscape's rights were acquired by Red Hat, and on June 1, 2005, much of the [[source code]] was released as [[free software]] under the terms of the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).

As of 389 Directory Server version 1.0 (December 1, 2005), Red Hat released as [[free software]] all of the remaining source code for all components included in the release package (admin server, console, etc.) and continues to maintain them under their respective licenses.&lt;ref name=fedoradswikiopensource&gt;{{cite web

 |archivedate=2012-02-24 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009 the Fedora Directory Server project changed its name to 389 to give the project a distribution and vendor neutral name and encourage porting or running the software on other operating systems.&lt;ref name=fedoradsnamechange&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
389 Directory server is an rfc4511 compliant server.&lt;ref name=rfc4511&gt;{{cite web
| title = IETF RFC 4511
| url = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4511
| accessdate = 2017-04-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has a focus on ease of use, stability, correctness and performance.&lt;ref name=directoryservergoals&gt;{{ cite web

'''''Akkoç v. Turkey''''' 2000, Nos. 22947 &amp; 8/93, ECHR 2000-X, was a decision by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) on the extent of the [[right to life]].

The case involved the [[Kurds in Turkey|Kurd]] Zübeyir Akkoç in [[Turkey]] who belonged to an outlawed [[trade union]].  Both the union member and his wife received [[death threat]]s, and eventually the man was killed.  His widow thus took the case to court, charging that the Turkish government was responsible.  The government was not found guilty of murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrights.is/the-human-rights-rpoject/humanrightscasesandmaterials/cases/regionalcases/europeancourtofhumanrights/nr/432 Akkoç v. Turkey Judgement of October 10, 2000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502170944/http://www.humanrights.is/the-human-rights-rpoject/humanrightscasesandmaterials/cases/regionalcases/europeancourtofhumanrights/nr/432 |date=May 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on the right to life, the ECHR found that the Turkish government knew about the death threats and failed to protect the victim. Thus, the right to life had been violated.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Rhona K.M. Smith, ''Textbook on International Human Rights'', second edition, Oxford University Press, 2005, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the state's investigation of the murder was found to be so negligent as to also be an infringement of the right to life.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

With respect to international human rights law, it is noted that a government's responsibility regarding the right to life is not "passive."  There should be laws against [[murder]]. ''Akkoç'' is a case that examined the "potential grey area" of the "extent to which a State can protect an individual against criminal behaviour."&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

'''Amarna Letter EA10''' (see here: [http://thebooksoffoundation.blogspot.com/2012/11/book-ix-chosen-people-of-demiurge.html]) is the [[diplomatic correspondence|letter]] of the [[Amarna letters|Amarna series of diplomatic correspondence]] designated EA 10, which is written in [[cuneiform]] writing showing the continuation of a correspondence between [[Burna-Buriash II]] (otherwise known as Burra-Buriyaš) an ancient king of Babylon (named [[Karduniaš]] in the 1350BC Amarna timeperiod) , and [[Akhenaten]] (also known as Amenophis III), an ancient [[pharaoh]] of Egypt. &lt;ref name="S. Najovits"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UrR848g3gp8C&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=Amarna+letter+EA10&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JZ9NJkrH26&amp;sig=7XgrB74UyYy0YvOT_Tkjd6xGGRc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwBmoVChMIg_6f6e_IxgIVRV0sCh0UqgT3#v=onepage&amp;q=Amarna%20letter%20EA10&amp;f=false|author=S.

Some part of the contents of the letter indicates (in addition to [[Amarna letter EA11|EA11]]) that the Egyptian pharaoh married his daughters (named [[Meritaten]] and [[Ankhesenpaaten]]) at a time when they were about 11 or 12 years of age. &lt;ref name="S. Najovits"/&gt;

Within the letter Burna-Buriash II praises the craftsmen of the land of Akhenaten, and requests a model of an animal, either land or aquatic, and he is apparently indifferent to which of the two the pharaoh should choose to have created.&lt;ref&gt;S.

'''Aquatic Park Historic District''' is a [[National Historic Landmark]] and building complex located on the [[San Francisco Bay]] waterfront within [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]].

The district includes a beach, bathhouse, municipal pier, restrooms, concessions stand, stadia, and two speaker towers.&lt;ref name="archinparks"/&gt;
[[File:ENTRANCE - Aquatic Park Bathhouse, Beach Street, West of Polk Street, San Francisco, San Francisco County, CA HABS CAL,38-SANFRA,157-3.tif|thumb|left|Aquatic Park Bathhouse]]
The District's San Francisco Maritime Museum building was built as a [[Public bathing|bathhouse]] in 1936 by the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]]; in [[Streamline Moderne]] style, its interior is decorated with fantastic and colorful murals. The Steamship Room illustrates the evolution of maritime technology from wind to steam, and there are displays of lithographic stones, scrimshaw, and whaling guns and photo-murals of San Francisco's early waterfront. A visiting-attractions gallery hosts such exhibition as ''Sparks'' (2005), which showcased shipboard radio, radiotelephone, and radioteletype equipment from over the years.

In front of the Maritime Museum is a man-made lagoon on the site of the former Black Point Cove. To the west is the horseshoe-shaped Municipal Pier, which was voted ''SFWeekly''{{'}}s Best Place to Go Fish 2009.&lt;ref name="sfwkly"&gt;{{cite news | title= Best Place to go Fish 2009 | url=http://www.sfweekly.com/bestof/2009/award/best-place-to-go-fish-1526440/ | work=San Francisco Weekly | accessdate=6 March 2013 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lagoon is fronted by a sandy beach and a stepped concrete seawall. To the south is a grassy area known as Victorian Park, which contains the Hyde Street cable car turnaround. Hyde Street Pier, though part of the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park, is not part of Aquatic Park Historic District.

It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987,&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt;&lt;ref name="archinparks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/harrison/harrison29.htm |title="Architecture in the Parks: A National Historic Landmark Theme Study: Aquatic Park Historic District", by Laura Soullière Harrison |accessdate=2008-02-26|work=National Historic Landmark Theme Study|publisher=National Park Service| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080226162331/http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/harrison/harrison29.htm| archivedate= 26 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nrhpinv2"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Aquatic Park Historic District|url={{NHLS url|id=84001183}} |format=pdf|date=February 1, 1984 |author=James P.

The park is located at the foot of Polk Street and is a minute's walk from the visitor center and Hyde Street Pier. Its beach is one of the cleanest in the state.&lt;ref name="dirty"&gt;{{cite news | author=Carolyn Jones | title=Bay Area beaches grade well for safe swimming | url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-05-27/news/21455974_1_bacteria-levels-raw-sewage-bay-area | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date=May 27, 2010 | accessdate=14 July 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100622004414/http://articles.sfgate.com/2010-05-27/news/21455974_1_bacteria-levels-raw-sewage-bay-area| archivedate= 22 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located in the park near the corner of Beach and Larkin Streets is [[California Historical Landmark]] marker No. 236, honoring the Spanish packet ''San Carlos'', which on August 5, 1775, became the first ship to enter [[San Francisco Bay]].&lt;ref name=CHL&gt;{{cite ohp|236|Entrance of the ''San Carlos'' into San Francisco Bay|2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SFEC BritMus Asia 023.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Chinese [[stoneware]] statue of a judgement figure, 16th century, [[Ming Dynasty]].]]
The '''Department of Asia''' in the [[British Museum]] is one of the largest collections of historical artifacts from [[Asia]], consisting of over 75,000 objects covering the material culture of the Asian continent (including East Asia, South and Central Asia, and Southeast Asia), and dating from the Neolithic age up to the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/asia.aspx |title=British Museum - Asia|website=British Museum |accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The collection formerly included objects from the Islamic world, but these have recently been merged with the Department of the Ancient Near East to form the Department of the Middle East.)

==History of the Department==
The department's collection began with a donation from Sir [[Hans Sloane]], which contained a small number of objects from the Asian continent, including a collection of Japanese material acquired from the family of the German traveller and physician [[Engelbert Kaempfer]] (who had led an expedition to [[Japan]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=139843&amp;peoA=139843-3-18|title=Collection search: You searched for|website=British Museum|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few objects were acquired from Asia between 1753 and the 1820s, but the collection expanded in the early 19th century to become one of the world's largest. This was mainly through a donation of a number of South Asian artifacts, such as the gilded bronze figure of Tara from [[Sri Lanka]] in 1830, the Bridge Collection of East and Central Indian sculpture in 1872, and the Amaravati Collection in 1880.  The collection of Asian material continued during the tenure of Sir [[Augustus Wollaston Franks]] as Keeper of the Department of Antiquities from 1866 to 1896, and in 1921 the Sub-Department of Oriental Antiquities was established. In 1933, the Asian collections of the Prints and Drawings Sub-Department were united with the Department of Oriental Antiquities, forming one of the most significant collections of art and antiquities of Asia in the northern hemisphere. In 2003, the Department of Oriental Antiquities and the Department of Japanese Antiquities merged to become the current Department of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/departments/asia/history_of_the_collection.aspx |title=British Museum - History of the collection|website=British Museum |accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Keepers of the Department of Asia include [[Jessica Rawson]],
[http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/search_the_collection_database/term_details.aspx?bioId=134913 Robert Knox] (1994-2006), [[Jan Stuart]] (2006-2014) and Jane Portal (from 2014).

==Highlights of the collection==
Highlights include:

It focuses on porcelain, paintings, scripts and basic tools, with items ranging in date from the [[Neolithic]] era to the 20th century. One of the most important items is a collection of rare [[Buddhist]] paintings from [[Dunhuang]]. China was one of the first countries to use coins, and the museum also has a large collection of Chinese coins (housed in the [[British Museum#Department of Coins and Medals|Department of Coins and Medals]]).

Objects in the Indian collections of the Department date from some of the earliest civilisations in the [[Indus valley]], about 7000 years ago. It includes an important collection of prehistoric material from the [[Nilgiri mountains]] in southern India .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Nilgiri|title=Collection search: You searched for Nilgiri|website=British Museum|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; As well as ancient artifacts, the Indian collections include excellent examples of pottery, art (including many rare [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] paintings), traditional scriptwork, and a large display of sculpture, including carvings from the Great [[Stupa]] at [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]]. India is also represented in the money collections, with a large number of coins dating back to the 4th century BC.

===Islam collection===
The [[John Addis]] gallery (room 34) houses the museum's collection of Islamic art, which now officially forms part of the Department of Middle East. This includes objects from the earliest centuries of Islam to the 20th century, and geographically from [[Egypt]] to [[Spain]] to [[India]]. The gallery's arrangement is mainly chronological, with western Islam &amp;mdash; Egypt, [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Turkey]] &amp;mdash; on the left of the descending staircase, and eastern Islam &amp;mdash; [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]] and India &amp;mdash; on the right. Highlights of the collection are a ceramic lamp from the [[Dome of the Rock]] in Jerusalem, the unique [[Jade Terrapin from Allahabad]], a [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] work of art from northern India, and a group of foundation inscriptions from [[Gaur, West Bengal]] in eastern India. At the end of the gallery are cases on Islamic Spain, science, arms and armour, coinage and a changing exhibition of contemporary graphics. The British Museum is actively collecting 20th century material from the Islamic world, including calligraphy, popular religious prints, political posters, studio pottery and a rare 11th century [[Qur'an]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2163">The '''Collection Blanche''' is the great [[Collection (publishing)|collection]] of [[French literature]] of the [[éditions Gallimard]].

It appeared in 1911, and at the beginning was nourished by the publications of ''[[La Nouvelle Revue française]]'', the brand "Librairie Gallimard" appeared only after July 1919.&lt;ref name="Vignes2011"&gt;Henri Vignes et Pierre Boudrot, ''Bibliographie des éditions de La Nouvelle Revue française'', Paris, Henri Vigne &amp; Éditions des Cendres, 2011, {{ISBN|9782867421822}}, page 7-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Since its creation, "La Blanche", which takes its name from the cream color of its cover, has published 6500 titles, of which 3800 are still available today.

In addition to the "NRF" logo originally designed by [[Jean Schlumberger]], the graphic charter of this collection - a black border surrounding two red edges - is inspired by the éditions de {{ill|La Phalange|fr}}, with its first title, ''[[L'Otage]]'' by [[Paul Claudel]], published 26 May 1911.&lt;ref name="Vignes2011"/&gt; For a time, the first printer of this collection was Verbeke, director of "The St. Catherine Press Ltd", based in [[Bruges]].&lt;ref name="Vignes2011"/&gt; The generic formats evolved very little over the years, which is a unique case in the history of French contemporary publishing, although the cream color changed to bright yellow filmed in the 1980s.

Champion of [[literary prize]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/livres/visuel/2013/11/30/prix-litteraires-les-maisons-d-edition-qui-regnent-sur-les-classements_3523087_3260.html Littérature : les éditeurs qui raflent tous les prix], Maxime Vaudano, ''Le Monde.fr'', 3 novembre 2014&lt;/ref&gt; from 1911 to 2016 the series has been awarded 33 [[prix Goncourt]], 30 [[prix Femina]], 17 [[prix Renaudot]], 10 [[prix Médicis]], 16 [[prix Interallié]], 30 [[Grand prix du roman de l'Académie française]] and 4 [[prix du Livre Inter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallimard.fr/Catalogue/GALLIMARD/Blanche Collection Blanche], éditions Gallimard&lt;/ref&gt;

This article is a comparison of notable software applications that can access or manipulate [[disk image]] files. It compares their disk image handling features.
{{TOC right}}

==Comparison criteria==
This article compares two features: Supported file formats and capabilities of the software as to how they treat the image format.

===Capabilities===
;"Creates?": Specifies whether the application can create a new disc image file, either by capturing the image of an actual disc, by composing a disc image file from locally stored files or an empty disc image.
;"Modifies?": Specifies whether the application is able to manipulate the contents of an existing disc image file, including adding, changing or deleting files within or modifying disc image metadata.
;"Mounts?": Specifies whether the application can emulate an optical disc drive. Such an application treats a disc image file like a virtual disc and virtually inserts it into that emulated [[virtual drive]].
;"Restores?": Specifies whether the application can write the contents of a disk image file onto a physical media (such as an [[optical disc]], a [[floppy disk]], a [[hard disk drive]] or a [[USB flash drive]]) and create a physical replica.
;"Extracts?": Specifies whether the application can copy some or all of the files within a disc image file to somewhere else.

===Supported file formats===
;"Input": Specifies the types of disc image formats that the application can open.
;"Output": Specifies the types of disc image formats that the application can save to.

'''Construction Photography''' is a [[photo library]] and agency based in [[London]], [[England]]. It was established in 2001 to provide the construction and built environment industries an alternative to multinational agencies such as [[Getty images]] and [[Branded Entertainment Network|Corbis]].

Using [[digital asset management]] software, Construction Photography delivers creative content over the internet to government organisations such as [[Transport for London]], [[Highways Agency]], [[ConstructionSkills]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cskillsimagelibrary.co.uk/news.asp?id=3 ConstructionSkills] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110308013642/http://www.cskillsimagelibrary.co.uk/news.asp?id=3 |date=2011-03-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme]] as well as multinational corporations such as [[Vinci (construction)|Vinci Plc]], [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]], [[Compass Group]], [[Corus Group]], Gardiner &amp; Theobald, Murphy Group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.murphygroupimages.co.uk/news.asp?id=2 Murphy Group] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005080516/http://www.murphygroupimages.co.uk/news.asp?id=2 |date=2011-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.).

Construction Photography is the largest supplier of images for the construction industry worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} It has a stock collection of over 100,000 built environment related images, of which 30,000 are available online, and 170 assignment photographers operating from 15 countries.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In January 2014 Construction Photography was acquired by Photoshot License Limited, an independent photo library based in Farringdon, London.

== Line of business and skills==

=== Image licensing and search ===
The library licence [[Rights Managed]] and [[Royalty Free]] images from content providers, photographers, agencies, museums and libraries around the world. In 2007 Construction Photography signed an agreement with the Russian state news agency [[Ria novosti]] to represent its built environment content worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructionphotography.com/newsletters/newsletter.asp?view=10 Ria Novosti distribution press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080125193753/http://www.constructionphotography.com/newsletters/newsletter.asp?view=10 |date=2008-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stockindexonline.com/index.php?q=IndustryNews&amp;id_new=1976 Stock Index Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005 Construction Photography launched a search engine including a feature called “Image Weight”. The search results are primarily ordered by image weight. Images increase in weight when users add them to a lightbox or a cart or open an image preview or large preview. Each action has a different weight. Images decrease in weight when they are removed from a lightbox or from the cart. An algorithm calculates in real time all these parameters to give each image a constant updated weight. Also included in the algorithm are the upload date and the keyword relevance to the search.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Media management ===
Construction Photography is the exclusive distributor of The Data Archive media management software ''(The Data Archive is the parent company of Construction Photography)''. The web-based digital assets management software helps companies within the built environment to manage their media content over the internet including photographs, videos, any type of media files or documents. The secure service also includes hosting, metadata management and data migration.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Awards==
Construction Photography was a finalist in the 2007 Construction Industry IT Awards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rbicreativeservices.com/cjou/cj_awards07_www/finalists_2007.htm Construction Industry IT Awards]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; organised by ''Contract Journal'', a UK weekly construction magazine. The agency was a finalist for the Quality in Construction 2008 Awards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qicawards.com/2008Winners.asp?m_pid=0&amp;m_nid=28124 Quality in Construction 2008 Awards]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; organised by another weekly magazine, ''[[Construction News]]'', for excellence in use of ICT.

==Industry membership==
The company is an accredited member of BAPLA, the [[British Association of Picture Libraries and Agencies]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bapla.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=90&amp;favm=87 BAPLA] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080427172602/http://www.bapla.org.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=90&amp;favm=87 |date=2008-04-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the UK trade association representing UK commercial picture libraries and agencies.

In 2005 Construction Photography joined [[CEPIC]], the Coordination of European Picture Agencies Press Stock Heritage (now Centre of the Picture Industry), which represents over 900 picture sources in 17 European countries.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The agency is a member of the Picture Licensing Universal System (PLUS), a worldwide coalition of companies, associations, and industry experts.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==CEC commands==
The following is a list of the most commonly used HDMI-CEC commands:
* '''One Touch Play''' allows devices to switch the TV to use it as the active source when playback starts
* '''System Standby''' enables users to switch multiple devices to standby mode with the press of one button
* '''Preset Transfer''' transfers the tuner channel setup to another TV set
* '''One Touch Record''' allows users to record whatever is currently being shown on the HDTV screen on a selected recording device
* '''Timer Programming''' allows users to use the [[electronic program guide]]s (EPGs) that are built into many HDTVs and set-top-boxes to program the timer in recording devices like PVRs and DVRs
* '''System Information''' checks all components for bus addresses and configuration
* '''Deck Control''' allows a component to interrogate and control the operation (play, pause, rewind etc.), of a playback component (Blu-ray or HD DVD player or a Camcorder, etc.)
* '''Tuner Control''' allows a component to control the tuner of another component
* '''OSD Display''' uses the [[on-screen display]] (OSD) of the TV set to display text
* '''Device Menu Control''' allows a component to control the menu system of another component by passing through the user interface (UI) commands
* '''Routing Control''' controls the switching of signal sources
* '''Remote Control Pass Through''' allows remote control commands to be passed through to other devices within the system
* '''Device OSD Name Transfer''' transfers the preferred device names to the TV set
* '''System Audio Control''' allows the volume of an AV receiver, integrated amplifier or preamplifier to be controlled using any remote control from a suitably equipped device(s) in the system

==Protocol==
{{See|AV.link}}
CEC{{r|HDMI1.3a}} is a separate electrical signal from the other HDMI signals. This allows a device to disable its high-speed HDMI circuitry in [[sleep mode]], but be woken up by CEC. It is a single shared bus, which is directly connected between all HDMI ports on a device, so it can flow through a device which is completely powered off (not just asleep).

The bus is electrically identical to the [[AV.link]] protocol, but CEC adds a detailed higher-level message protocol.

The bus is an [[open-collector]] line, somewhat like [[I²C]], [[Pull-up resistor|passively pulled]] up to +3.3&amp;nbsp;V, and driven low to transmit a bit.

Similarities to I²C include:
* Low-speed serial bus
* Open-collector with passive pull-up
* Speed limited by distributed [[capacitance]]
* Receiver can convert a transmitted 1 bit to a 0
* Multiple masters allowed via arbitration: sending a 1 bit and observing a 0 indicates loss
* Byte-oriented protocol
* Each byte has an acknowledge bit appended
* Special start signal

Differences from I²C:
* Single wire rather than two wires
* Bits sent with fixed timing rather than separate clock
* 1000× lower speed (417&amp;nbsp;bit/s instead of 400&amp;nbsp;kbit/s)&lt;!--- 41.7 byte/s as opposed to 44.4 kbyte/s--&gt;
* Four address bits rather than seven
* Defined protocol for dynamic address allocation
* Header includes both initiator and recipient address
* No special stop signal; instead, each byte has an end of message flag appended
* No "read" operations; all data bytes in a frame are sent from transmitter
* Instead, "get" requests solicit response frames
* Every device must be able to transmit
* Detailed specification of meaning of bytes after the address

Each bit begins with the line pulled low (falling edge), a delay indicating the bit value, a rising edge, and further delay until the start of the following bit.

Normal data bits are {{val|2.4|0.35|u=ms}} long. A logic 1 is held low for {{val|0.6|0.2|u=ms}}, while a logic 0 is held low for {{val|1.5|0.2|u=ms}}. The receiver samples the line at {{val|1.05|0.2|u=ms}} after the falling edge, then begins watching for the following bit {{val|1.9|0.15|u=ms}} after the falling edge.

A receiver can convert a transmitted 1 bit to a 0 bit by pulling the line low within 0.35&amp;nbsp;ms of the falling edge, and holding it until the 0 bit time. The transmitter observes the bus during its own transmissions to detect this condition. This is used to [[Acknowledgement (data networks)|acknowledge]] a transmission.

Each frame begins with a special [[start bit]], held low for {{val|3.7|0.2|u=ms}} and then allowed to rise, for a total duration of {{val|4.5|0.2|u=ms}}. Any device may send a start bit after observing the bus idle for a suitable number of bit times. (Normally, 5 bit times, but 7 bit times immediately after a successful transmission to facilitate fair sharing of the bus, and 3 bit times between a failed transmission and its retransmission.)

This is followed by up to 16 bytes. Each byte consists of ten bits: eight data bits (transmitted msbit-first, in [[big-endian]] order), an "end of message" bit (set to 1 after the last byte of a frame), and an "acknowledge" bit.

For single-recipient messages, the acknowledge bit operates similarly to I²C: it is transmitted as a 1 bit, and the receiver pulls it down to a 0 bit to acknowledge the byte.

For broadcast messages, the acknowledge bit is inverted: it is still transmitted as a 1 bit, but is pulled down to a 0 bit by any receiver which ''rejects'' the byte.

The first byte of each CEC frame is a header containing the 4-bit source and destination addresses. If the addressed destination exists, it acknowledges the byte. A frame consisting of nothing but the header is a [[ping (networking utility)|ping]] which simply checks for the presence of another device.

The address 15 (1111) is used for the broadcast address (as a destination) and unregistered devices (as a source) which have not yet chosen a different address. Some devices do not need to receive non-broadcast messages and so may use address 15 permanently, notably remote control receivers and HDMI switches. Devices which need to receive addressed messages need their own address. A device obtains an address by attempting to ping it. If the ping is unacknowledged, the device claims it. If the ping is acknowledged, the device tries another address.

The second byte is an opcode which specifies the operation to be performed, and the number and meaning of following parameter bytes. For example, a user press on a remote control will generate a 3-byte frame: a header byte, a &lt;code&gt;&lt;User Control Pressed&gt;&lt;/code&gt; opcode (0x44), and an operand byte identifying the button. Including the initial idle time and extra-long start bit, this takes 88.5&amp;nbsp;ms (37 bit times). A later &lt;code&gt;&lt;User Control Released&gt;&lt;/code&gt; opcode (0x45) has no operands.

'''The Discovery Museum''' is a [[science museum]] and local history museum situated in Blandford Square in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]].  
It displays many exhibits of local history, including the ship, ''[[Turbinia]]''. It is one of the biggest free museums in [[North East England]], and in 2006 was winner of the North East's Best Family Experience award at the North East England Tourism Awards. It is managed by [[Tyne &amp; Wear Archives &amp; Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twmuseums.org.uk/discovery/about-us.html |title=About &amp;#124; Discovery Museum |publisher=Twmuseums.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Discovery Museum started life in 1934 as the Municipal Museum of Science and Industry.&lt;ref name="thejournal1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson |first=Tony |url=http://www.thejournal.co.uk/news/north-east-news/newcastle-discovery-museum-marks-80th-7448505 |title=Newcastle Discovery Museum marks 80th anniversary with birthday bash |publisher=The Journal |date=2014-07-17 |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The collections were housed in a temporary pavilion built for the 1929 [[North East Coast Exhibition]] in [[Exhibition Park, Newcastle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/leisure-libraries-and-tourism/parks-and-countryside/exhibition-park |title=Exhibition Park |publisher=Newcastle City Council |accessdate=7 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127001453/http://www.newcastle.gov.uk/leisure-libraries-and-tourism/parks-and-countryside/exhibition-park |archivedate=January 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collections and displays grew for another forty years, until the temporary pavilion could no longer meet the museum's needs. In 1978, the museum was re-located to Blandford House, the former Co-operative Wholesale Society Headquarters for the Northern Region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/georgians-and-victorians/tra23395 |title=Two Cities, One River - Newcastle And Gateshead Heritage Trail |publisher=Culture24 |date=2015-07-20 |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Designed by Oliver, Leeson and Wood, this magnificent 1899 building had been the distribution centre for over 100 Co-op stores across the region, and contained extensive warehouse space and offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Northumberland|first1= Nikolaus |last1=Pevsner|first2= Ian Archibald|last2= Richmond|first3=John|last3= Grundy|first4= Peter|last4= Ryder|first5=Grace |last5=McCombie|first6=Humphrey|last6= Welfare|page=447|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1992|isbn=978-0300096385}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum was re-launched as Discovery Museum in 1993 at which time "Turbina" was moved from Exhibition Park.&lt;ref name="thejournal1"/&gt; In 2004 the £13 million redevelopment of the museum was complete&lt;ref name="thejournal1"/&gt; and the following year the venue attracted 450,000 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.culture24.org.uk/history-and-heritage/historic-buildings/art491342-Happy-birthday-Discovery-Museum-home-history |title=Happy birthday Discovery Museum: Pictures from Newcastle's home of history past |publisher=Culture24 |date= |accessdate=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibits==

'''Fatemeh Keshavarz''' Ph.D. ({{lang-fa|فاطمه كشاورز}}) (born 1952) is an Iranian academic, [[Rumi]] and [[Persian studies]] scholar, and a poet in Persian and English. She is the Roshan Chair of Persian Studies and Director of the Roshan Institute for Persian Studies at the [[University of Maryland]], since 2012. Previously, she served as a professor of [[Persian Language]] and [[Comparative Literature]] for twenty years and chair of the department of Asian and Near Eastern Languages and Literatures at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] from 2004 to 2011.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

Over the years, she has published several notable books including ''Reading Mystical Lyric: the Case of Jalal al-Din Rumi'' (1998), ''Recite in the Name of the Red Rose'' (2006) and ''Jasmine and Stars: Reading more than Lolita in Tehran'' (2007). As an activist for peace and justice, in 2008, she received the Hershel Walker 'Peace and Justice' Award.

==Early life and education==
Born and brought up in [[Shiraz]], [[Iran]], Fatemeh Keshavarz holds a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] (1976) in Persian Language and Literature from [[Shiraz University]], and an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] (1981) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] (1985) in [[Near Eastern Studies]] from [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], [[University of London]].&lt;ref name=cv&gt;[https://sllc.umd.edu/persian/facultyandstaff Roshan Institute for Persian Studies at the University of Maryland: Persian Faculty and Staff]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Professor Keshavarz taught at [[Washington University]] 1990 until 2012. She served as Director of the Graduate Program in Jewish, Islamic, and Near Eastern Studies, Director of the Center for the Study of Islamic Societies and Civilizations, President of the Association of Women Faculty, and Chair of the Department of Asian and Near Eastern Languages and Literatures. In 2012, she became the Director and Chair of Roshan Institute Center for Persian Studies at University of Maryland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Among Keshavarz's works is her book ''Jasmine and Stars: Reading more than Lolita in Tehran.'' The book offers ideas in contrast to [[Azar Nafisi]]'s ''[[Reading Lolita in Tehran|Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books]]'' (Random House, 2003) that explores the relationship between literature and society in the post-revolutionary Iran. Keshavarz believes that Nafisi's book presents "many damaging misrepresentations" of Iran and its people, relying more on stereotypes and easy comparisons than on an accurate portrayal of the country and its people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/keshavarz120307.html Reading More than ''Lolita'' in Tehran: An Interview with Fatemeh Keshavarz] ''Monthly Review'' (12 March 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fatemeh Keshavarz, [http://chronicle.com/temp/reprint.php?id=sl8sg6vbqmx5djhq3ps40y17gvvx6scz ''Banishing the Ghosts of Iran'' ] The Chronicle Review of Higher Education, Vol. ''53'', No. 45, p.

A '''flick''' is a [[unit of time]] equivalent to exactly 1/705,600,000 of a [[second]]. The figure was chosen so that frequencies of 24, 25, 30, 48, 50, 60, 90, 100 and 120 Hz, as well as 1/1000 divisions of all those, can be represented with [[integer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/OculusVR/Flicks|title=OculusVR/Flicks|website=GitHub|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit was launched in January 2018 by [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42787529|title=Facebook invents new unit of time|date=21 October 2018|publisher=|accessdate=21 October 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; A flick is approximately 1.42 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; s, which makes it larger than a [[nanosecond]] but much smaller than a [[microsecond]].

A similar unit for integer representation of temporal points was proposed in 2004 under the name TimeRef, splitting a second into 14,112,000 parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | author =  Raphaël Troncy, Jean Carrive, Steffen Lalande and Jean-Philippe Poli
 | title = A Motivating Scenario for Designing an Extensible Audio-Visual Description Language
 | year = 2004
}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes 1 TimeRef equivalent to 50 Flicks.

==Etymology==
The word ''flick'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''[[Film frame|frame]]'' (as in e.g. animation frame) and ''[[instruction cycle|tick]]'' (as in computer instruction cycle).

In the context of [[international migration]], '''funds parking''' is transferring money into one's [[bank account]] just before applying for a [[travel visa]] in the hopes of increasing one's chances of being granted the visa. The motivation for funds parking is that many countries, before granting permission to enter, consider the applicant's bank account balance as part of assessing whether the traveler will be willing and able to support his or herself for the duration of the trip, and to leave the country when required. Funds parking, therefore, is a deceptive practice. When immigration officers notice unexplained cash deposits in a bank account statement, they may assume that they constitute an attempt at funds parking and refuse the visa application.&lt;ref&gt;https://travel.stackexchange.com/questions/62411/what-is-funds-parking-in-the-context-of-uk-visa-applications&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''funds parking'' comes from the financial term ''parking''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/parking.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[postal history]], a '''gallows letter''' was a [[Letter (message)|letter]] with a "[[gallows]]" mark meaning "very quickly".

Gallows letters were official letters or dispatches used by the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]] of [[Elizabeth I of England]]. To express an extreme degree of urgency of delivery, the letter had on the [[Address (geography)|address]] panel a rough [[drawing]] of a gallows. Sometimes the picture included a hanging body. These drawings could also have repeated written directions as ''"haste haste"'', ''"post haste"'', ''"haste for life"'', ''"for life haste"'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beal, P.|title=A Dictionary of English Manuscript Terminology: 1450 to 2000|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hzggwODemEAC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=Gallows+letter&amp;cd=8#v=onepage&amp;q=Gallows%20letter&amp;f=false|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6YWVFmO6z?url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199576128.001.0001/acref-9780199576128-e-0444|archivedate=2015-05-14|accessdate=2015-05-14|edition=|year=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|isbn=9780199576128|pages=169–171|chapter=Gallows letter|chapterurl=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199576128.001.0001/acref-9780199576128-e-0444|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also modern [[Forgery|forgeries]] of such letters. This is when [[counterfeit]] gallows marks have been applied onto original letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vollmeier, P.|year=2002|title=Forgeries of handwritten indications on old letters|journal=Fakes, Forgeries &amp; Experts|issue=5|url=http://www.ffejournal.com/articles.php?book=FFE+%235|accessdate=2015-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney''' (January 9, 1875&amp;nbsp;– April 18, 1942) was an American [[List of sculptors#W|sculptor]], art patron and collector, and founder in 1931 of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]] in New York City. She was a prominent social figure and hostess, who was born into the wealthy [[Vanderbilt family]] and married into the [[Whitney family]].

==Early life==
[[File:Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney by John Everett Millais (1829-1896).jpg|thumb|left|150px|Gertrude, 13 years of age. ([[John Everett Millais]], 1888)]]
Gertrude Vanderbilt was born on January 9, 1875 in New York City, the second daughter of [[Cornelius Vanderbilt II]] (1843–1899) and [[Alice Claypoole Gwynne]] (1852–1934), and a great-granddaughter of "Commodore" [[Cornelius Vanderbilt]]. Her older sister died before Gertrude was born, but she grew up with several brothers and a younger sister.&lt;ref name=fall/&gt; The family's New York City home was an opulent mansion at 742–748 [[Fifth Avenue]].&lt;ref name=ThenNow&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waldman|first1=Benjamin|title=Then and Now: Remnants of the Vanderbilt Mansion in New York City|url=http://untappedcities.com/2012/02/01/remnants-of-the-vanderbilt-mansion-in-new-york-city/|website=Untapped Cities|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a young girl, Gertrude spent her summers in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], at the family's summer home, [[The Breakers]], where she kept up with the boys in all their rigorous sporting activities.  She was educated by private tutors and at the exclusive [[Brearley School]] for women students in New York City.&lt;ref name=fall/&gt; She kept small drawings and watercolor paintings in her personal journals which were her first signs of being interested in the arts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McNeal|first=Patricia|year=2008|title=Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney|journal=Salem Press Biographical EncyclopediaResearch Starters|via=EBSCO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and early work===
[[File:Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney (1920).jpg|right|thumb | Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney in her studio, ca. 1920]]
While visiting Europe in the early 1900s, Gertrude Whitney discovered the burgeoning art world of [[Montmartre]] and [[Montparnasse]] in France. What she saw encouraged her to pursue her creativity and become a sculptor.

She studied at the [[Art Students League of New York]] with [[Hendrik Christian Andersen]] and [[James Earle Fraser (sculptor)|James Earle Fraser]].&lt;ref name=Exhibit1943&gt;{{cite book|title=Memorial exhibition; Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney|date=1943|publisher=Whitney museum of American art|location=New York|url=https://archive.org/details/memorialexhibiti00whit|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=McCarthy/&gt; Other women students in her classes included [[Anna Vaughn Hyatt]] and [[Malvina Hoffman]].&lt;ref name=McCarthy&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCarthy|first1=Kathleen D.|title=Women's culture : American philanthropy and art, 1830–1930|date=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=9780226555843|page=221|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xx9SRF1azEIC&amp;pg=PA221|accessdate=December 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Paris she studied with [[Andrew O'Connor (sculptor)|Andrew O'Connor]]&lt;ref name="Opitz"&gt;Opitz, Glenn B, editor, Mantle Fielding's Dictionary of American Painters, Sculptors &amp; Engravers, Apollo Book, Poughkeepsie NY, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; and also received criticism from [[Auguste Rodin]] in Paris.&lt;ref name="Friedman"&gt;Friedman, B.H., Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, Doubleday and Company New York, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ArtStory&gt;{{cite web|title=The Whitney Museum of American Art|url=http://www.theartstory.org/museum-whitney.htm|website=The Art Story.org|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her training with sculptors of public monuments influenced her later direction.&lt;ref name=Magill1999/&gt; Although her catalogs include numerous smaller sculptures,&lt;ref name=Exhibit1943/&gt;&lt;ref name=Exhibit1923&gt;{{cite book|title=Exhibition of sculpture by Gertrude V.

Her first public commission was ''Aspiration'', a life-size male nude in plaster, which appeared outside the New York State Building at the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in [[Buffalo, New York]], in 1901.&lt;ref name=HeritagePress&gt;{{cite web|title=Pan-American Exposition Sights – Then &amp; Now|url=http://wnyheritagepress.org/photos_week_2006/pan_am_sites/nys_building.htm|website=Western New York Heritage Press|accessdate=February 4, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120829184838/http://wnyheritagepress.org/photos_week_2006/pan_am_sites/nys_building.htm|archivedate=August 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DoingThePan&gt;{{cite web|title=Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney|url=http://panam1901.org/documents/panamwomen/gertrude_whitney.htm|website="Doing the Pan"|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Heller1995&gt;{{cite book|last1=Heller|first1=Jules|last2=Heller|first2=Nancy G.|title=North American women artists of the twentieth century : a biographical dictionary|date=1995|publisher=Garland Publishing|location=New York|isbn=9780815325840|page=577|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYxmAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA577|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially she worked under an assumed name, fearing that she would be portrayed as a socialite and her work not taken seriously.&lt;ref name=McCarthy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gender2001&gt;{{cite web|last1=Staples|first1=Shelley|title="The Part Played By Women:"  The Gender of Modernism at the Armory Show|url=http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MUSEUM/Armory/gender.html|website=American Studies Program|publisher=University of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither her family nor (after her marriage) her husband were supportive of her desire to work seriously as an artist. She once told an artist friend, "Never expect Harry to take your work seriously ... It never has made any difference to him that I feel as I do about art and it never will (except as a source of annoyance)." She believed that a man would have been taken more seriously as an artist, and that her wealth put her in a lose-lose situation: criticized if she took commissions because other artists were more needy, but blamed for undercutting the market for other artists if she was not paid.&lt;ref name=McCarthy/&gt;

In 1907, Whitney established an [[Whitney Museum of American Art (original building)|apartment and studio]] in [[Greenwich Village]].&lt;ref name=ArchivesAmericanArt&gt;{{cite web|title=Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney papers, 1851–1975, bulk, 1888–1942|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/gertrude-vanderbilt-whitney-papers-7107/more|website=Archives of American Art|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also set up a studio in [[Passy]], a fashionable Parisian neighborhood in the XVI arrondissement.

By 1910 she was exhibiting her work publicly under her own name.&lt;ref name=McCarthy/&gt; ''Paganisme Immortel'', a statue of a young girl sitting on a rock, with outstretched arms, next to a male figure, was shown at the 1910 National Academy of Design.&lt;ref name=Love1999&gt;{{cite book|last1=Love|first1=Richard H.|title=Carl W.

==World War I and its aftermath==
During [[World War I]], Gertrude Whitney dedicated a great deal of her time and money to various relief efforts, establishing and maintaining a fully operational hospital for wounded soldiers in [[Juilly, Seine-et-Marne|Juilly]], about {{convert|35|km|mi}} northwest of Paris in France.&lt;ref name=Grimm/&gt;

While at this hospital, Gertrude Whitney made drawings of the soldiers which became plans for her memorials in New York City.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bryant|first=Edward|year=2006|title=Whitney|url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T091439pg1.|journal=Oxford University Press|via=Oxford Art Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her work prior to the war had a much less realistic style, which she strayed away from to give the work a more serious feeling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1915, her brother [[Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt I|Alfred Gwynne Vanderbilt]] perished in the sinking of the [[RMS Lusitania]].

She completed a series of smaller pieces realistically depicting soldiers in wartime,&lt;ref name=Magill1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=Touchstone1919&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roberts|first1=Mary Fanton|title=Sculpture of War: The Work of Gertrude V.

Since her death critics have recognized the expert craftsmanship of her smaller works.&lt;ref name="Grove2011"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In addition to participating in shows with other artists, Whitney held a number of solo exhibitions during her career. These included a show of her wartime sculptures at her Eighth Street Studio in November 1919;&lt;ref name=Touchstone1919/&gt; a show at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], March 1 to April 15, 1923;&lt;ref name=Exhibit1923/&gt; and one in New York City, March 17–28, 1936.&lt;ref name=Exhibit1936/&gt; The majority of works created in this period of her work were made in her studio in Paris.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The Whitney museum of American art held a commemorative show of her works in 1943.&lt;ref name=Exhibit1943/&gt;

===Public sculptures===

Following the end of the War, Whitney was also involved in the creation of a number of commemorative sculptures. During the 1920s her works received critical acclaim both in Europe and the United States, particularly her monumental works.  During the 1930s the popularity of monumental pieces declined.   Whitney's last pieces of public arts were the ''Spirit of Flight'', created for the New York World's Fair of 1939,&lt;ref name=Grimm/&gt; and the ''Peter Stuyvesant Monument'' in New York City.&lt;ref name="Grove2011"/&gt;

Whitney's ''[[Titanic Memorial (Washington, D.C.)|Titanic Memorial]]'' is considered by critics as the most important achievement in her artistic career. The statue was built from a $50,000 prize from a competition that she won in 1914.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Whitney also created works which are now in other countries, including the ''A.E.F. Memorial'' in St. Nazaire Harbor in [[Saint-Nazaire]], France, 1924.&lt;ref name="87th"&gt;{{cite web|last1=McAuliffe|first1=John|title=St. Nazaire, France Memorial|url=http://gallery.87thinfantrydivision.com/MonumentsMemorialsandMuseums/Europe/St-Nazaire-France-Memorial/2158506_5wdtwt|website=87th Infantry Division Photo Galleries|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government of France purchased a marble replica of the head of the Titanic memorial which is now housed in the [[Musée du Luxembourg]].

Whitney sculpted the [[Christopher Columbus]] memorial, called "Monumento a la Fe Descubridora" (Monument to the Discovery Faith), in [[Huelva]], Spain, 1928–33. With a cubist style, it is one of her biggest works.

In 1931 Whitney presented the ''Caryatid Fountain'' to [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal|Montreal, Quebec]], Canada,. The fountain is also referred to as ''The Good Will Fountain'', ''The Friendship Fountain'', ''The Whitney Fountain'', '' [[The Three Graces (Whitney)|The Three Graces]]'' and because it consists of three nude males, ''The Three Bares.''.&lt;ref&gt;The Good Will Fountain, The Friendship Fountain, The Whitney Fountain, as well as The Three Graces.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a bronze version of this fountain in the Washington Square in [[Lima, Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bicketts|first1=Mónica|title=Lima, paseos por la ciudad y su historia|date=1988|publisher=Diario Expreso|location=Lima}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence in art==

[[File:Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney.jpg|thumb|Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, in ''[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]]'' magazine, by [[Adolf de Meyer]], January 15, 1917]]

Her great wealth afforded her the opportunity to become a patron of the arts, but she also devoted herself to the advancement of women in art, supporting and exhibiting in women-only shows and ensuring that women were included in mixed shows.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Whitney, Gertrude Vanderbilt (1875–1942)|title=Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2591309854/whitney-gertrude-vanderbilt-18751942.html|website=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She supported exhibition of artwork both locally and around the country, including the 1913 [[Armory Show]] in New York.&lt;ref name=Dissertation&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shircliff|first1=Jennifer Pfeifer|title=Women of the 1913 Armory Show: Their Contributions to the Development of American Modern Art|date=May 2014|publisher=University of Louisville|location=Louisville, Kentucky|url=http://ir.library.louisville.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2321&amp;context=etd|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitney also donated money to the [[Society of Independent Artists]] founded in 1917, which aimed to promote artists who deviated from academic norms.&lt;ref name="ANBO" /&gt; She actively bought works from new artists including the [[Ashcan School]].&lt;ref name=Grimm/&gt; In 1922, she financed publication of ''The Arts'' magazine, to prevent its closing.&lt;ref name=Grimm/&gt; She was the primary financial backer for the "International Composer's Guild," an organization created to promote the performance of modern music.&lt;ref name=Music&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Locke|editor-first1=Ralph P.|title=Cultivating music in America : women patrons and activists since 1860|date=1997|publisher=Univ. of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=9780520083950|pages=239–241|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L4UylL6JGZcC&amp;pg=PA241|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1908, Whitney had opened the [[Whitney Museum of American Art (original building)|''Whitney Studio Gallery'']] in the same buildings as her own studio on West Eighth Street in [[Greenwich Village]]. Artists such as [[Robert Henri]] and [[Jo Davidson]] were invited to showcase their works there.&lt;ref name=Whitney1937&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whitney Museum of American Art|title=Whitney Museum of American Art: history, purpose and activities, with a complete list of works in its permanent collection to June, 1937|date=1937|publisher=Whitney Museum of American Art|location=New York|page=3|url=https://archive.org/details/whitneymuseumofa00whit|accessdate=February 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1914, Gertrude Whitney also established the ''Whitney Studio Club'' at 147 West 4th Street, as an artists' club where young artists could meet and talk, as well as exhibit their works.&lt;ref name=ArtStory/&gt; She provided nearby housing many of them, as well as stipends for living costs at home and abroad.&lt;ref name="ANBO" /&gt; The Whitney Studio Club expanded again when its headquarters were moved back from West Fourth Street to West Eighth Street in 1923.&lt;ref name=Richmond&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richmond|first1=Lauren|title=Defining the American Vision: The Whitney Museum of American Art's role in changing the landscape of American art history|date=2014|publisher=Wellesley College Honors Thesis Collection|url=http://repository.wellesley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1234&amp;context=thesiscollection|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the club expanded both in size and scope of programming. These early galleries would evolve to become Whitney's greatest legacy, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art]], on the site of what is now the [[New York Studio School of Drawing, Painting and Sculpture]].

In 1929, Whitney offered the New York [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] the donation of her twenty-five-year collection of nearly 700 American [[modern art]] works and full payment for building a wing to accommodate these works.&lt;ref name="DoingThePan" /&gt; Her offer was declined because the museum would not take American art, and in 1931, Whitney decided to create her own museum by renovating and expanding on one of her own studios.&lt;ref name="DoingThePan" /&gt; Whitney appointed [[Juliana R. Force|Juliana Force]], who was formerly her assistant since 1914, to be the museum's first director.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The museum aimed to embrace modernism, shifting away from the notions that American art was largely rural and narrow in scope.&lt;ref name="ANBO" /&gt;

A colorful recollection of one of her parties celebrating her artist friends was recounted by the artist [[Jerome Myers]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Matching it in memory is a party at Mrs. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney's, on her Long Island estate, the artists there a veritable catalog of celebrities, painters and sculptors. I can hardly visualize, let alone describe, the many shifting scenes of our entertainment: sunken pools and gorgeous white peacocks as line decorations spreading into the gardens; in their swinging cages, brilliant macaws nodding their beaks at [[George Luks]] as though they remembered posing for his pictures of them; [[Robert Chanler]] showing us his exotic sea pictures, blue-green visions in a marine bathroom; and Mrs. Whitney displaying her studio, the only place on earth in which she could find solitude. Here the artists felt at home, the Whitney hospitality always gracious and sincere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Jerome| last=Myers| title=Artist in Manhattan| page=61| publisher=American Artist Group, Inc.| location=New York| year=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Her [[Whitney Museum of American Art (original building)|Greenwich Village studio]] has been named a National Treasure by the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], giving it landmark status.&lt;ref name=Cascone&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cascone|first1=Sarah|title=Landmark Designations for Whitney and Wyeth Studios|url=http://news.artnet.com/in-brief/landmark-designations-for-whitney-and-wyeth-studios-127418|accessdate=February 4, 2015|work=ArtNet News|date=October 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Whitney died in 1942, the Whitney Museum of American Art was cleared of the debt it owed her and granted $2.5&amp;nbsp;million of her money.&lt;ref name="DoingThePan" /&gt;

==Personal life==
At age 21, on August 25, 1896, Gertrude married the extremely wealthy sportsman [[Harry Payne Whitney]] (1872–1930).&lt;ref name=fall&gt;{{cite book |title=Fortune's Children: The Fall of the House of Vanderbilt |last=Vanderbilt |first=Arthur T., II |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Fortune_s_children.html?id=oCkaAAAAYAAJ |date=August 1989 |publisher=Morrow |location=New York |isbn=0-688-07279-8| accessdate=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Magill1999&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Magill|editor-first1=Frank N.|title=Dictionary of world biography|date=1999|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|location=Chicago|isbn=1579580483|chapter=Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney|pages=3969–3971|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uiQAaGgOChIC&amp;pg=PA3969|accessdate=December 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A banker and investor, Whitney was the son of [[William Collins Whitney]], and his mother, the former Flora Payne, was the daughter of a U.S. Senator and sister of a [[Standard Oil]] Company magnate.

Harry Whitney died of pneumonia in 1930, at age 58, leaving his widow an estate valued at $72&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Vanderbilt, 354.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, she was at the center of a highly publicized court battle with her sister-in-law, [[Gloria Morgan Vanderbilt]], for custody of her ten-year-old niece, [[Gloria Vanderbilt]].

'''Golden Pages''' is a company which publishes a [[telephone directory]] of [[business]]es categorized according to product or service. Business listings are printed on yellow paper as opposed to white paper for non-commercial and private phone numbers.

Golden Pages is published in [[Belgium]], [[Czech Republic]], [[Republic of Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Netherlands]], [[Uzbekistan]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Romania]]. The publishing companies in these countries are not necessarily related.

==Israel==
Golden Pages Israel ({{lang-he|דפי זהב}}, ''Dapei Zahav'') was founded by [[Morris Kahn]] in 1968, distributing three directories in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]] and [[Jerusalem]]. In 2007, the company was sold by Markstone Capital to [[Australian]] firm [[Babcock &amp; Brown]], who purchased 100% of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/golden-pages-ties-the-knot-with-mitchatnim-wedding-planner-1.228759 |title=Golden Pages ties the knot with Mitchatnim wedding planner |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |author=Eran Gabay |date=September 4, 2007 |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/business/breaking-news/bcm-acquires-israeli-golden-pages/story-e6frfkur-1111114084305 |title=BCM acquires Israeli Golden Pages |publisher=[[News Limited]] |date=August 1, 2007 |accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's CEO is Nir Lampert. The largest competitor is [[Bezeq]], which launched a rival internet service in July 2008. The directory lists 250,000 businesses.

The slogan of the company "תן לאצבעות ללכת במקומך" (''Ten LeEtzba'ot Lelekhet BeMkomkha''), parallel to the English "let your fingers do the walking" has become an idiom in Hebrew, and means to do the work with your phone or computer instead of running around.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.babylon.com/definition/let_your_fingers_do_the_walking/Hebrew |title=Let Your Fingers Do The Walking |publisher=[[Babylon]] |accessdate=26 January 2014 |quote=Slogan of Golden Pages; It's possible to save running around by using the telephone (in Hebrew)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10024">The '''Haldimand Proclamation''' was a [[decree]] that granted land to the [[Iroquois]] who had served on the British side during the [[American Revolution]]. The decree was issued by the Governor of the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]], [[Frederick Haldimand]], on October 25, 1784, three days after the [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784)]] was signed between others of the Six Nations and the American government.

==Proclamation text==

The text of the proclamation reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Frederick Haldimand, Captain General and Governor General in Chief of the Province of Quebec and Territories depending thereon, General and Commander in Chief of His Majesty's Forces in said Province and the Frontiers thereof --&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whereas His Majesty having been pleased to direct that in consideration of the early attachment to his cause manifested by the Mohawk Indians, and of the loss of their settlement which they thereby sustained-- that a convenient tract of land under his protection should be chosen as a safe and comfortable retreat for them and others of the Six Nations, who have either lost their settlements within the Territory of the American States, or wish to retire from them to the British -- I have at the earnest desire of many of these His Majesty's faithful Allies purchased a tract of land from the Indians situated between the Lakes Ontario, Erie and Huron and I do hereby in His Majesty's name authorize and permit the said [[Mohawk nation|Mohawk Nation]] and such others of the Six Nation Indians as wish to settle in that quarter to take possession of and settle upon the Banks of the River commonly called Ours [Ouse] or Grand River, running into Lake Erie, allotting to them for that purpose six miles deep from each side of the river beginning at Lake Erie and extending in that proportion to the head of the said river, which them and their posterity are to enjoy for ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Valley Of The Six Nations|editor= Charles M. Johnston |year=1964 |publisher=The Champlain Society For The Government of Ontario, University of Toronto Press|isbn=|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Given under my hand and seal at arms, at the Castle of St Lewis at Quebec, this twenty-fifth day of October one thousand seven hundred and eighty-four and in the twenty-fifth year of the reign of Our Sovereign Lord George The Third by the Grace of God of Great Britain, France and Ireland, King, Defender of the Faith and so forth.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fredk Haldimand&lt;br&gt;
By His Excellency's Command&lt;br&gt;
R. Mathews&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Background==

[[Joseph Brant]] and [[Guy Johnson]], who had been ejected from his post as [[Superintendent of Indian Affairs]] a few months before, traveled to London, England in November 1775, on the eve of the [[American Revolution]], to obtain a promise from the Crown that if the Iroquois fought on the British side, they would obtain a land grant in Canada.  During and after the [[American Revolution]], American colonists confiscated land and property from those who were Loyalists during the war.  The British government compensated both Indian and non-Indian Loyalists with cash payments for their losses.

By early 1783, Brant had selected the valley of the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] as a place of settlement; in 1784 [[Frederick Haldimand]] agreed.  The land was acquired from the [[Mississaugas]] in May 1784, with Lieutenant-Colonel [[John Butler (pioneer)|John Butler]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Valley Of The Six Nations|editor= Charles M. Johnston |year=1964 |publisher=The Champlain Society For The Government of Ontario, University of Toronto Press|isbn=|pages=43–44}}&lt;/ref&gt; acting as an agent of purchase on behalf of the government.  

Later, [[the Crown]] adopted the position that it had failed to obtain title to the entire valley at the time of its purchase from the Mississaugas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Valley Of The Six Nations|editor= Charles M. Johnston |year=1964 |publisher=The Champlain Society For The Government of Ontario, University of Toronto Press|isbn=|pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
===Nature of the grant===
On April 26, 1784, [[Frederick Haldimand]] wrote:

''"The mode of acquiring lands by what is called Deeds of Gift is to be entirely discontinued, for, by the King's instructions, no Private Person, Society, Corporation or colony is capable of acquiring any property in lands belonging to the Indians, either by purchase, or grant or conveyance from the Indians, excepting only where the lands lie within the limits of any colony the soil of which has been vested in Proprietaries or Corporations by grants from the Crown; in which cases such Proprietaries or Corporations only shall be capable of acquiring such property by purchase or grants from the Indians."''&lt;ref&gt;Cases Decided on the British North America Act, 1867...&lt;/ref&gt; 

Government officials originally interpreted this grant as prohibiting the Indians from leasing or selling the land to anyone but the government. [[Joseph Brant]] countered that Haldimand had promised the Indians freehold land tenure equal to that enjoyed by the colony's Loyalist settlers.  As freeholders, the Indians could lease or sell land to the highest bidder.  In 1793, [[John Graves Simcoe|Lieutenant Governor Simcoe]] stated that the Indians could not lease their land since British subjects could only lease land from British subjects.  [[Joseph Brant]] considered the right to lease or sell land as a litmus test for Indian sovereignty.

The crown said that the grant was for all members of the Six Nations, but Brant said the land should only be for those members of the Six Nations who were living on the land.

===Extent of the lands===
[[File:Thomas Ridout map of Grand River Indian Lands, 1821.jpg|thumb|Thomas Ridout survey of 1821]]
Although the overall limits of the lands mentioned in the proclamation were clearly defined,"extending in that proportion to the head of the said river", the Crown contended that the grant was limited by the extent of land they had previously purchased and that they could not grant land which they did not already own.&lt;ref name="The Valley Of The Six Nations"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Valley Of The Six Nations|editor= Charles M. Johnston |year=1964 |publisher=The Champlain Society For The Government of Ontario, University of Toronto Press|isbn=|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1784, Haldimand had purchased a tract of land from the [[Mississaugas]], which was referred to in the grant as generally "situated between the Lakes Ontario, Erie and Huron".  In fact, the [[Source (river or stream)|head]] of the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] is located some thirty miles beyond the limits of land that the Crown maintained that it had previously purchased from the Mississaugas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandriver.ca/index/document.cfm?sec=74&amp;sub1=6&amp;sub2=0 Map of Grand River watershed]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1791 at the request of the Six Nations, an initial survey was completed. It was agreed between [[Joseph Brant]], Henry Tekarihoga, and other chiefs with the Nassau District land board that the middle of the grant should not follow the exact windings of the river, but that it should be drawn from an easterly bend near the river's mouth straight to the Mohawk village.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsay pg. 555&lt;/ref&gt; Although the government alleges that the Six Nations agreed to the accuracy of the information gathered during the 1791 survey, the resulting documentation in the form of a map signed by the Land Board and the Six Nation chiefs was subsequently "believed lost or destroyed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Valley Of The Six Nations|editor= Charles M. Johnston |year=1964 |publisher=The Champlain Society For The Government of Ontario, University of Toronto Press|isbn=|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown's position was that the extent of the land was as determined in the subsequent [[Thomas Ridout]] survey of 1821, drawing a northern boundary near the present location of [[Elora, Ontario]], referred to at the time of the survey as "The Falls".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Valley Of The Six Nations|editor= Charles M. Johnston |year=1964 |publisher=The Champlain Society For The Government of Ontario, University of Toronto Press|isbn=|page=128 [map insert]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this survey, the size of the grant was described as {{convert|674910|acre|km2|1|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; As early as July 4, 1819, Six Nations chief [[John Brant (Mohawk chief)|John Brant]] (''Tekarihoga''), son of Joseph Brant, in a speech at a council held near present-day [[Hamilton, Ontario]] to deal with land issues, stated, "We are surprised to find that [the] Government says that we own the Lands to the Falls only as we have the Writings to prove otherwise.  We have them here and are ready to produce them."&lt;ref name="The Valley Of The Six Nations"/&gt;

Originally, it was thought that the [[Government of Pakistan]] had declassified the Report in 2002 and was made it available to the public as [[public domain]] whereas it was free to download on the internet.

'''In-group favoritism''', sometimes known as '''in-group–out-group bias''', '''in-group bias''', or '''intergroup bias''', is a pattern of favoring members of one's [[Ingroups and outgroups|in-group]] over out-group members. This can be expressed in evaluation of others, in allocation of resources, and in many other ways.&lt;ref name=aronson&gt;Aronson, E., Wilson, T. D., &amp; Akert, R. (2010).

This interaction has been researched by many [[psychologist]]s and linked to many theories related to [[group conflict]] and [[prejudice]]. The phenomenon is primarily viewed from a [[social psychology]] standpoint. Studies have shown that in-group favoritism arises as a result of the formation of cultural groups.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Efferson|first=Charles|last2=Lalive|first2=Rafael|last3=Fehr|first3=Ernst|date=2008-09-26|title=The Coevolution of Cultural Groups and Ingroup Favoritism|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5897/1844|journal=Science|language=en|volume=321|issue=5897|pages=1844–1849|doi=10.1126/science.1155805|issn=0036-8075|pmid=18818361|bibcode=2008Sci...321.1844E}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fu|first=Feng|last2=Tarnita|first2=Corina E.|last3=Christakis|first3=Nicholas A.|last4=Wang|first4=Long|last5=Rand|first5=David G.|last6=Nowak|first6=Martin A.|date=2012-06-21|title=Evolution of in-group favoritism|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep00460|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=2|pages=460|doi=10.1038/srep00460|issn=2045-2322|pmc=3380441|pmid=22724059|bibcode=2012NatSR...2E.460F}}&lt;/ref&gt; These cultural groups can be divided based on seemingly trivial observable traits, but with time, populations grow to associate certain traits with certain behaviour, increasing covariation. This then incentivises in-group bias.

Two prominent theoretical approaches to the phenomenon of in-group favoritism are [[realistic conflict theory]] and [[social identity theory]]. Realistic conflict theory proposes that intergroup competition, and sometimes intergroup conflict, arises when two groups have opposing claims to scarce resources. In contrast, social identity theory posits a psychological drive for [[Social identity theory#Positive distinctiveness|positively distinct]] social identities as the general root cause of in-group favoring behavior.

==Origins of the research tradition==

In 1906, the sociologist [[William Graham Sumner|William Sumner]] posited that humans are a species that join together in groups by their very nature. However, he also maintained that humans had an innate tendency to favor their own group over others, proclaiming how "each group nourishes its own pride and vanity, boasts itself superior, exists in its own divinities, and looks with contempt on outsiders" (p.&amp;nbsp;13).&lt;ref&gt;Sumner, William Graham. (1906). ''Folkways: A Study of the Social Importance of Usages, Manners, Customs, Mores, and Morals''. Boston, MA: Ginn.&lt;/ref&gt; This is seen on the group level with ingroup–outgroup bias. When experienced in larger groups such as tribes, [[ethnic group]]s, or nations, it is referred to as [[ethnocentrism]].

==Explanations==

===Competition===
Realistic conflict theory (or realistic group conflict) posits that competition between groups for resources is the cause of in-group bias and the corresponding negative treatment of members of the out-group. Muzafer Sherif's [[Robbers Cave experiment|Robbers Cave Experiment]] is the most widely known demonstration of realistic conflict theory. In the experiment, 22 eleven-year-old boys with similar backgrounds were studied in a mock summer camp situation, with researchers posing as camp personnel.

The boys were divided into two equal groups and encouraged to bond, with the aim of fostering an in-group mentality. The researchers then introduced a series of competitive activities which pitted groups against each other for a valuable prize. Hostility and out-group negativity ensued.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Sherif, M.; Harvey, O.J.; White, B.J.; Hood, W. &amp; Sherif, C.W. (1961). ''Intergroup Conflict and Cooperation: The Robbers Cave Experiment''. Norman, OK: The University Book Exchange. pp. 155–184.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, researchers attempted to reverse the hostility by engaging the boys in situations of mutual interdependence, an effort which eventually resulted in relative harmony between the two groups.

Sherif concluded from this experiment that negative attitudes toward out-groups arises when groups compete for limited resources.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, he also theorised that [[Group conflict|inter-group frictions]] could be reduced and positive relations created,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; but only in the presence of an all-encompassing goal which could only be achieved with the two groups cooperation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aronson" /&gt;

===Self-esteem===
According to [[social identity theory]], one of the key determinants of group biases is the need to improve [[self-esteem]]. The desire to view one's self positively is transferred onto the group, creating a tendency to view one's own group in a positive light, and by comparison, outside groups in a negative light.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social categorization and similarity in intergroup behaviour|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ejsp.2420030103/abstract|journal = European Journal of Social Psychology|date = 1973-01-01|issn = 1099-0992|pages = 27–52|volume = 3|issue = 1|doi = 10.1002/ejsp.2420030103|first = Michael|last = Billig|first2 = Henri|last2 = Tajfel}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, individuals will find a reason, no matter how insignificant, to prove to themselves why their own group is superior. This phenomenon was pioneered and studied most extensively by [[Henri Tajfel]], a British social psychologist who looked at the psychological root of in-group/out-group bias. To study this in the lab, Tajfel and colleagues created what are now known as minimal groups (see [[minimal group paradigm]]), which occur when "complete strangers are formed into groups using the most trivial criteria imaginable". In Tajfel's studies, participants were split into groups by flipping a coin, and each group then was told to appreciate a certain style of painting none of the participants were familiar with when the experiment began. What Tajfel and his colleagues discovered was that—regardless of the facts that a) participants did not know each other, b) their groups were completely meaningless, and c) none of the participants had any inclination as to which "style" they like better—participants almost always "liked the members of their own group better and they rated the members of their in-group as more likely to have pleasant personalities". By having a more positive impression of individuals in the in-group, individuals are able to boost their own self-esteem as members of that group.&lt;ref name=aronson/&gt;

[[Robert Cialdini]] and his research team looked at the number of university T-shirts being worn on college campuses following either a win or loss at the football game. They found that the Monday after a win, there were more T-shirts being worn, on average, than following a loss.&lt;ref name=aronson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Cialdini|first= Robert B.|last2= Borden|first2= Richard J.|last3= Thorne|first3= Avril|last4= Walker|first4= Marcus Randall|last5= Freeman|first5= Stephen|last6= Sloan|first6= Lloyd Reynolds|date= 1974|title= Basking in Reflected Glory: Three (Football) Field Studies|url= |journal= [[Journal of Personality and Social Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 34|issue= 3|pages= 366–375|doi= 10.1037/0022-3514.34.3.366 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In another set of studies, done in the 1980s by [[Jennifer Crocker]] and colleagues, self-esteem was studied using minimal group processes in which it was shown that individuals with high self-esteem who suffer a threat to the self-concept exhibit greater ingroup biases than people with low self-esteem who suffer a threat to the self-concept.&lt;ref name=crocker1987&gt;{{cite journal |last= Crocker|first= Jennifer|last2= Thompson|first2= Leigh L.|last3= McGraw|first3= Kathleen M.|last4= Ingerman|first4= Cindy|date= May 1987|title= Downward Comparison, Prejudice, and Evaluations of Others: Effects of Self-Esteem and Threat|url= |journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|publisher= |volume= 52|issue= 5|pages= 907–916|issn= 0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.52.5.907}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; While some studies have supported this notion of a negative correlation between self-esteem and in-group bias,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Abrams|first= Dominic|last2= Hogg|first2= Michael A.|date= 1988|title= Comments on the motivational status of self-esteem in social identity and intergroup discrimination|url= |journal= [[European Journal of Social Psychology]]|publisher= |volume= 18|issue= 4|pages= 317–334|doi= 10.1002/ejsp.2420180403}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; other researchers have found that individuals with low self-esteem have a higher prejudice to both in-group and out-group members.&lt;ref name=crocker1987 /&gt; Some studies have even shown that high-self-esteem groups showed a greater prejudice than did lower self-esteem groups.&lt;ref name="Sachdev, I. 1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sachdev|first= Itesh|last2= Bourhis|first2= Richard Y.|date= September 1987|title= Status differentials and intergroup behaviour|url= |journal= European Journal of Social Psychology|publisher= |volume= 17|issue= 3|pages= 277–293|doi= 10.1002/ejsp.2420170304}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This research may suggest that there is an alternative explanation and additional reasoning as to the relationship between self-esteem and in-group/out-group biases. Alternatively, it is possible that researchers have used the wrong sort of self-esteem measures to test the link between self-esteem and in-group bias (global personal self-esteem rather than specific social self-esteem).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Rubin|first= Mark|last2= Hewstone|first2= Miles|date= February 1998|title= Social Identity Theory's Self-Esteem Hypothesis: A Review and Some Suggestions for Clarification|url= |journal= [[Personality and Social Psychology Review]]|publisher= |volume= 2|issue= 1|pages= 40–62|doi= 10.1207/s15327957pspr0201_3|pmid=15647150}}&lt;!--|accessdate=11 November 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological basis as an effect of oxytocin ===
{{Main|Oxytocin}}
In a meta-analysis and review of the effect of oxytocin on social behavior done by [[Carsten De Dreu]], the research reviewed shows that oxytocin enables the development of trust, specifically towards individuals with similar characteristics - categorised as 'in-group' members - promoting cooperation with and favoritism towards such individuals.&lt;ref name="De Dreu2012"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Oxytocin modulates cooperation within and competition between groups: An integrative review and research agenda|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=61|issue=3|pages=419–428|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2011.12.009|issn=0018-506X|last1=De Dreu|first1=Carsten K.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bias of oxytocin-induced goodwill towards those with features and characteristics perceived to be similar may have evolved as a biological basis for sustaining in-group cooperation and protection, fitting with the Darwinian insight that acts of self-sacrifice and cooperation contribute to the functioning of the group and hence improve the odd of survival for members of said group.&lt;ref name="De Dreu2012" /&gt;

Race can be used as an example of in-group and out-group tendencies because society often categorizes individuals into groups based on race (Caucasian, African American, Latino, etc.). One study that examined race and [[empathy]] found that participants receiving nasally administered oxytocin had stronger reactions to pictures of in-group members making pained faces than to pictures of out-group members with the same expression.&lt;ref name="pmid23246533"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sheng F, Liu Y, Zhou B, Zhou W, Han S | title = Oxytocin modulates the racial bias in neural responses to others' suffering | journal = Biological Psychology | volume = 92 | issue = 2 | pages = 380–6 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23246533 | doi = 10.1016/j.biopsycho.2012.11.018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This shows that oxytocin may be implicated in our ability to empathize with individuals of different races, with individuals of one race potentially biased towards helping individuals of the same race than individuals of another race when they are experiencing pain.

Oxytocin has also been implicated in [[Lie|lying]] when lying would prove beneficial to other in-group members.  In a study where such a relationship was examined, it was found that when individuals were administered oxytocin, rates of [[dishonesty]] in the participants' responses increased for their in-group members when a beneficial outcome for their group was expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shalvi S, De Dreu CK | title = Oxytocin promotes group-serving dishonesty | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 111 | issue = 15 | pages = 5503–7 | date = April 2014 | pmid = 24706799 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1400724111 | pmc=3992689| bibcode = 2014PNAS..111.5503S }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these examples show the tendency to act in ways that benefit people with which one feels is part of their social group, or in-group.

=== Self-identity and social identity ===
{{Main|Social identity theory}}
As noted in two recent theoretical reviews,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Michael A.|last2=Terry|first2=Deborah J.|last3=White|first3=Katherine M.|date=1995-01-01|title=A Tale of Two Theories: A Critical Comparison of Identity Theory with Social Identity Theory|jstor=2787127|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=58|issue=4|pages=255–269|doi=10.2307/2787127}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theoretical basis for the inclusion of self-identity in the theories of reasoned action and planned behavior has many similarities to social identity theory &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tajfel|first=Henri|date=1974-04-01|title=Social identity and intergroup behaviour|url=http://ssi.sagepub.com/content/13/2/65|journal=Social Science Information|language=en|volume=13|issue=2|pages=65–93|doi=10.1177/053901847401300204|issn=0539-0184}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its extension, self-categorization theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advances in Group Processes: Theory and Research, Vol.2|last=Turner|first=John C.|publisher=JAI|year=1985|isbn=|location=Greenwichm, CT|pages=77–122|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to social identity theory, an important component of the self-concept is derived from memberships in social groups and categories. When people define and evaluate themselves in terms of a self-inclusive social category (e.g. a sex, class, team) two processes come into play : (1) categorization, which perceptually accentuates differences between in-group and out-group, and similarities among in-group members (including self) on stereotypical dimensions; and (2) self-enhancement which, because the self-concept is defined in terms of group membership, seeks behaviorally and perceptually to favor the in-group over the out-group. Social identities are cognitively represented as group prototypes that describe and prescribe beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviors that optimize a balance between minimization of in-group differences and maximization of intergroup differences.

More specifically, according to social identity theory, there is a continuum between personal and social identity shifts along this continuum that determine the extent to which group-related or personal characteristics influence a person's feelings and actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Intergroup Relations|last=Tajfel, Henri, John C. Turner|publisher=Brooks-Cole|year=1979|isbn=|location=Brooks-Cole|pages=33–47|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a particular social identity is a salient basis for self-conception, then the self is assimilated to the perceived in-group prototype which can be thought of as a set of perceived in-group norms such that self-perception, beliefs, attitudes, feelings and behaviours are defined in terms of the group prototype. Thus, social identities should influence behaviour through the mediating role of group norms. People will be more likely to engage in a particular behaviour if it is in accord with the norms of a behaviourally relevant group membership, particularly if the identity is a salient basis for self-definition. If the group membership is not salient, then people's behaviour and feelings should be in accord with their own personal and idiosyncratic characteristics rather than group norms.

On the other hand, the self-identity theory poses that the self is often a reflection of expected norms and practices in the role that the person places him/herself in. At the center of it is the proposition that the self is made up of multi-faceted and differentiated components that exist in an organized manner  for the sake of filling in roles in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Personality, Roles, and Social Behavior|author1=Stryker, Sheldon |author2=Richard T. Serpe|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1982|isbn=|location=New York|pages=188–218|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; People are able to create an identity for themselves only through talking to others, and often what roles they are taking on differ from one group to another. These differing roles and positions people fill are a result of their interactions with others and are called role identities. Role identities may be self-realized or facts like being a mother, a social worker, or a blood donor. Role identities lead people to act in certain ways due to assumed expectations for the roles. Because there is satisfaction in complying with expectations of the role, there is often distress behind an inability to appear congruent to one's identity as defined by societal norms. There is also an existing hierarchy of importance for roles that individuals take on, and according to the hierarchical standing of roles, people become more representative of roles that stand higher hierarchically, according to them.

Identity salience, the likelihood of role identities being invoked in different situations, is the result of role identities being placed hierarchically in different orders from person to person. People who hold the same roles may act differently because some roles are valued over others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology Quarterly|author1=Nuttbrock, Larry |author2=Patricia Freudiger|publisher=|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=146–157|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a working mother may have less time to spend with her child as opposed to a mother that doesn't work. Behaviors are reflective of the identities that are held higher hierarchically by people, so people act out in self-worth and self-meaning according to these hierarchies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Psychology Quarterly 48|last=Callero|first=Peter|publisher=|year=1985|isbn=|location=|pages=203–215|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Someone who holds the identity of being a psychologist higher than the identity of being a linguist will find that while he/she may become competitive when meeting another person that is better at psychology than he/she, he/she won't care when in contact with someone who is much better at being a linguist than he/she. In a similar way, social relationships are influenced by this salience. Self-identity often places individuals in social contexts and a commitment to the role within that context becomes a big part of perpetrating the idea of self. It also finds people relating more to others that hold similar role identities at the top of their hierarchies.

Because people have self-concepts that are derived from a role they define for themselves within the context of a group, when staying within their roles, intergroup similarities are accentuated while intergroup differences are diminished.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=British Journal of Psychology 50|last=Tajfel|first=Henri|publisher=|year=1959|isbn=|location=|pages=16–29|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an attempt to assimilate oneself according to the tendencies of a group, often people reconfigure their intragroup representations or identities. Certain prototypes form about these groups that reaffirm rules that members of the group are encouraged to follow. Shared information and views are discussed more often than novel and unshared information within a group, therefore a norm is established where the majority views are perpetuated and others silenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|last=Larson, J. R., Jr., Foster-Fishman, P. G., &amp; Keys, C. B.|publisher=|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=446–461|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This norm is fluid and changing according to different contexts, but those within the group who want to keep up with the majority views in all matters have to keep an active role in affirming the views of the in-group in contest to out-groups.

== Evolution of in-groups ==

=== Formation of cultural groups ===
Studies have shown that in-group favoritism arises endogenously, through the formation of [[cultural group]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Symbolic markers in certain conditions can result in trivial groupings developing into cultural groups. The formation of such cultural groups then results in a higher degree of in-group favoritism.

Efferson, Lalive and Fehr published such a study in 2008, utilising a series of [[coordination game]]s to mimic cooperation between individuals. The study found that cultural groups were able to form endogenously through creation of a linkage between a payoff-relevant behaviour and a payoff-irrelevant marker. Subsequently, in-group favouritism occurred in ensuing social interactions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Participants were first divided into one of several populations of 10 people, and then further divided into subpopulations of 5. Each group had different payoff for coordinating on one of 2 choices, behaviour A or behaviour B. In group 1, participants were awarded 41 points for coordinating (choosing A themselves and choosing another participant who also chose A) on A and 21 for coordinating on B. The payoffs were switched in the 2nd group. In both groups participants were awarded just 1 point for mis-coordinating. During each turn participants were also allowed to choose a payoff-irrelevant marker (circle or triangle). Players from both subpopulations were mixed to create a coordination problem, and every turn, an unidentified player from each subpopulation would be randomly switched.

The experiment created a situation in which participants were strongly incentivised to develop a sense of expected behaviours in his or her subpopulation, but occasionally would find themselves in a totally new situation in which their behaviours were not in-line with [[Norm (social)|social norms]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The results showed that players generally developed an inclination to pair behaviour with a marker, especially if it had resulted in a positive payoff. As linkages at an individual level increase, [[covariation]] (of marker and behaviour) at an aggregate level also increases. In the experiment, there was a significant increase in participants requesting for partners with the same-shape choice as it progressed, although the initial choice of shape had no effect on payoffs. Toward the end of the experiment, this number stood at a substantial 87%, indicating the presence of in-group favouritism.

Their study supported the thesis that the formation of cultural groups alters selective pressure facing individuals, and thus leads to certain behavioural traits being advantageous.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, if such selective pressures were present in past civilisations, where membership in a certain group is correlated with a certain behavioural norm, the emergence of in-group biases where it is beneficial to act in differing manners to members of the same group is certainly plausible.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Gender differences ==

=== Automatic bias for own gender ===
{{harvtxt|Rudman|Goodwin|2004}} conducted research on [[gender bias]] that measured gender preferences without directly asking the participants. Subjects at [[Purdue]] and [[Rutgers]] participated in computerized tasks that measured automatic attitudes based on how quickly a person categorizes pleasant and unpleasant attributes with each gender. Such a task was done to discover whether people associate pleasant words (good, happy, and sunshine) with women, and unpleasant words (bad, trouble, and pain) with men.&lt;ref name="googleusercontent.com1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://rutgerssocialcognitionlab.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/9/7/13979590/rudmangoodwin2004jpsp.pdf |last1=Rudman |first1=Laurie A. |last2=Goodwin |first2=Stephanie A. |year=2004 |title=Gender differences in automatic in-group bias: Why do women like women more than men like men? |journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology |volume=87 |pages=494–509 |doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.4.494 |issue=4 |pmid=15491274 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718210210/http://rutgerssocialcognitionlab.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/9/7/13979590/rudmangoodwin2004jpsp.pdf |archivedate=July 18, 2014 |accessdate=September 2, 2016 |df=mdy|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This research found that while both women and men have more favorable views of women, women's in-group biases were 4.5 times stronger&lt;ref name="googleusercontent.com1"/&gt; than those of men and only women (not men) showed cognitive balance among in-group bias, identity, and self-esteem, revealing that men lack a mechanism that bolsters automatic preference for their own gender.&lt;ref name="googleusercontent.com1"/&gt;

=== Competition ===
Using a publics-goods game, Van Gugt, De Cremer, and P. Janssen (2016) found that men contributed more to their group in the face of outside competition from another group; there was no distinct difference amongst women's contributions.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Van Vugt, M., De Cremer, D., P.

=== Ethnicity-based favoritism ===
Fershtman and Gneezy (2001) found that men showed in-group biases in a [[Trust game|"trust" game]] based on ethnicity whereas this tendency was not present in women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fershtman|first=Chaim|last2=Gneezy|first2=Uri|date=2001-02-01|title=Discrimination in a Segmented Society: An Experimental Approach|url=https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/116/1/351/1939071/Discrimination-in-a-Segmented-Society-An|journal=The Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=116|issue=1|pages=351–377|doi=10.1162/003355301556338|issn=0033-5533}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study aim to identify [[ethnic discrimination]] in [[Israelis|Israeli Jewish]] society, and was conducted on 996 Israeli undergraduates. Groups were separated based on whether the participants name was typically ethnically Eastern or [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazic]]. Similar to a dictator game, subjects were instructed to divide a sum of money (20 [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]]) between themselves and another player. Player A was told that any money sent over to Player B would be tripled, and Player B would receive details of the experiment, including the name of Player A and the transferred sum. Subsequently, Player B would have a choice of whether to send any money back.

The experiment found that despite sharing similar average transfer values (10.63 for women and 11.42 for men), women did not display significant in-group biases when it came to recipients with either Ashkenazic or Eastern sounding names. However, a bias against Eastern sounding names was present amongst men.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Furthermore, men showed more bias for Ashkenazic men compared to women, but the opposite was true for Eastern names.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This result may seem counter-intuitive as participants appear to share more in common if they were both male, thus we would expect Eastern females to be more marginalised, but is actually consistent with other studies which studied discrimination against Afro-American women.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Cynthia, "Positive Effects of the Multiple Negative: Explaining the Success of Black Professional Women," American Journal of Sociology, LXXVIII (1993), 150-173.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental age ===

Fehr, Bernhard, and Rockenbach (2008), in a study conducted on children, found that boys displayed in-group favouritism from ages 3–8 whereas girls did not display such tendencies.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fehr|first=Ernst|last2=Bernhard|first2=Helen|last3=Rockenbach|first3=Bettina|title=Egalitarianism in young children|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature07155|journal=Nature|volume=454|issue=7208|pages=1079–1083|doi=10.1038/nature07155|year=2008|bibcode=2008Natur.454.1079F}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment involved usage of an "envy game", a modified version of the [[dictator game]]. A possible explanation posited by researchers relied on an evolutionary basis.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

They theorised that [[parochialism]] and favouring members of the same group may have been particularly advantageous as it strengthened the individuals group position in intergroup conflicts.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; As males were the ones who were frequently at the forefront of such conflicts in the past, and thus bore the majority of the costs of conflicts in terms of injury or death, evolution may have favoured a greater sensitivity in males in situations which resulted in an advantageous payoff for their in-group. Thus males tended to show in-group biases from a younger age than females, as was evident in the experiment.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Real-world examples ==

=== 2008 US Presidential elections ===
A study conducted during the 2008 Presidential elections showcased how group identities were dynamic.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rand|first=David G.|last2=Pfeiffer|first2=Thomas|last3=Dreber|first3=Anna|last4=Sheketoff|first4=Rachel W.|last5=Wernerfelt|first5=Nils C.|last6=Benkler|first6=Yochai|date=2009-04-14|title=Dynamic remodeling of in-group bias during the 2008 presidential election|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/106/15/6187|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|language=en|volume=106|issue=15|pages=6187–6191|doi=10.1073/pnas.0811552106|issn=0027-8424|pmc=2664153|pmid=19332775|bibcode=2009PNAS..106.6187R}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study carried out on 395 Democrats from Cambridge, MA, using an Economics [[dictator game]]. Subjects were given $6 to divide between themselves and another person. The recipients remained anonymous apart from which candidate they supported in the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries|Democratic Primaries]].

Data was collected in three separate periods. June 10 to 18th (after [[Hillary Clinton]]'s concession speech on June 7); August 9 to 14th, before the [[Democratic National Convention]] on the 25th; and September 2 to 5th, in the buildup to the Presidential elections. The results showed that men displayed significant in-group favouritism from June all the way to the DNC in August. This in-group bias however was not present in September. Women displayed no significant in-group favouritism throughout.

The experiment showed how group identities were flexible and could change over time.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Researchers theorised that in-group bias was strong in June as the competition to be the Democratic representative in the elections was still recent and thus salient. A lack of actual electoral conflict (against the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]]) caused perception of salient groupings to remain throughout August.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Only in September did the in-group favouritism subside as a superordinate goal shared between groups was now present.

== Versus out-group negativity ==
{{Main|Group conflict}}
Social psychologists have long made the distinction between ingroup favouritism and outgroup negativity, where outgroup negativity is the act of punishing or placing burdens upon the outgroup.&lt;ref name="Tajfel &amp; Turner (1979)."&gt;Tajfel, H., &amp; Turner, J. C. (1979). "An integrative theory of intergroup conflict". In W. G. Austin &amp; S. Worchel (Eds.), ''The social psychology of intergroup relations'' (pp. 33–47). Monterey, CA: Brooks/Cole&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, a significant body of research exists that attempts to identify the relationship between ingroup favouritism and outgroup negativity, as well as conditions that will lead to outgroup negativity.&lt;ref name="Bourhis &amp; Gagnon (2001)"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bourhis | first1 = R. Y. | last2 = Gagnon | first2 = A. | editor1-last = Brown | editor1-first = R. | editor2-last = Gaertner | editor2-first = S.

This theory also states that dissimilarity increases negative orientations towards others. When applied to [[Racism|racial discrimination]], the belief congruence theory argues that the perceived dissimilarity of beliefs has more of an impact on racial [[discrimination]] than does [[Race (human classification)|race]] itself.

Research finds evidence of in-group bias in police investigations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Jeremy |last=West |date=February 2018 |title=Racial Bias in Police Investigations |work=Working Paper |url=https://people.ucsc.edu/~jwest1/articles/West_RacialBiasPolice.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; and judicial decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Briggs |last=Depew |first2=Ozkan |last2=Eren |first3=Naci |last3=Mocan |year=2017 |title=Judges, Juveniles, and In-Group Bias |journal=[[Journal of Law and Economics]] |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=209–239 |doi=10.1086/693822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological relationship ===
Oxytocin is not only correlated with the preferences of individuals to associate with members of their own group, but it is also evident during conflicts between members of different groups. During conflict, individuals receiving nasally administered oxytocin demonstrate more frequent defense-motivated responses toward in-group members than out-group members.  Further, oxytocin was correlated with participant desire to protect vulnerable in-group members, despite that individual's attachment to the conflict.&lt;ref name="pmid23144787"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=Oxytocin motivates non-cooperation in intergroup conflict to protect vulnerable in-group members|journal=PLoS One|volume=7|issue=11|pages=e46751|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0046751|pmc=3492361|pmid=23144787|vauthors=De Dreu CK, Shalvi S, Greer LL, Van Kleef GA, Handgraaf MJ|bibcode=2012PLoSO...746751D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, it has been demonstrated that when oxytocin is administered, individuals alter their subjective preferences in order to align with in-group ideals over out-group ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2012|title=The herding hormone: oxytocin stimulates in-group conformity|journal=Psychological Science|volume=23|issue=11|pages=1288–92|doi=10.1177/0956797612446026|pmid=22991128|vauthors=Stallen M, De Dreu CK, Shalvi S, Smidts A, Sanfey AG}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies demonstrate that oxytocin is associated with intergroup dynamics.

Further, oxytocin influences the responses of individuals in a particular group to those of another group. The in-group bias is evident in smaller groups; however, it can also be extended to groups as large as one's entire country leading toward a tendency of strong national zeal. A study done in the Netherlands showed that oxytocin increased the in-group favoritism of their nation while decreasing acceptance of members of other ethnicities and foreigners.&lt;ref name="pmid21220339"&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2011|title=Oxytocin promotes human ethnocentrism|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|volume=108|issue=4|pages=1262–6|doi=10.1073/pnas.1015316108|pmc=3029708|pmid=21220339|vauthors=De Dreu CK, Greer LL, Van Kleef GA, Shalvi S, Handgraaf MJ|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.1262D}}&lt;/ref&gt; People also show more affection for their country's flag while remaining indifferent to other cultural objects when exposed to oxytocin.&lt;ref name="pmid25140135"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2014|title=Oxytocin increases liking for a country's people and national flag but not for other cultural symbols or consumer products|journal=Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=|pages=266|doi=10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00266|pmc=4122242|pmid=25140135|vauthors=Ma X, Luo L, Geng Y, Zhao W, Zhang Q, Kendrick KM}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has thus been hypothesized that this hormone may be a factor in [[xenophobic]] tendencies secondary to this effect.  Thus, oxytocin appears to affect individuals at an international level where the in-group becomes a specific "home" country and the out-group grows to include all other countries.

==In-group derogation==
Cross-cultural studies have found that in-group derogation, the tendency to criticize members of one's own group or culture more harshly than members of outside groups, is more common among members of disadvantaged and minority groups than among members of the majority or dominant group. According to psychology professor Christine Ma-Kellams et al. (2011), [[system justification theory]] seeks to explain why "minorities sometimes endorse system-justifying views of their group". They said their research into in-group favoritism and derogation partially supported this theory, but that the theory failed to address all of the nuances.&lt;ref name=MaKellams/&gt;

Ma-Kellams et al. also found that, compared to individualist cultures, people from collectivist cultures, such as [[East Asian]] cultures, tended to judge their own group members less favorably than they judged outsiders, whereas people from individualist cultures were inclined to judge members of their own group more favorably than they judged outsiders.&lt;ref name=MaKellams/&gt; [[Social identity theory]]{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} and [[Freudian]] theorists explain in-group derogation as the result of a negative [[self-image]], which they believe is then extended to the group.&lt;ref name=MaKellams/&gt; Ma-Kellams et al. theorized that "ingroup derogation may be more culturally normative and less troubling for East Asians" as evidenced by the fact that East Asians were also likely to report high levels of positive affect (emotion) towards members of their in-group, demonstrating ambivalence towards the unfavorable characteristics they had acknowledged about their in-group. According to Ma-Kellam et al., culturally-ingrained attitudes and beliefs, rather than low self-esteem, may play a role in collectivist cultures' in-group derogation due to their ability to tolerate holding seemingly contradictory views.&lt;ref name=MaKellams&gt;{{Cite journal|title = I Am Against Us? Unpacking Cultural Differences in Ingroup Favoritism via Dialecticism|url = http://psp.sagepub.com/content/37/1/15|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date = 2011-01-01|issn = 0146-1672|pmid = 21084525|pages = 15–27|volume = 37|issue = 1|doi = 10.1177/0146167210388193|first = Christine|last = Ma-Kellams|first2 = Julie|last2 = Spencer-Rodgers|first3 = Kaiping|last3 = Peng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Israeli Druze Faction''' ({{lang-ar|الكتلة الدرزية الإسرائيلية}}, ''al-Ketla al-Druzia al-Isra'iliah'', {{lang-he|הסיעה הדרוזית הישראלית}}, ''HaSia'a HaDruzit HaYisraelit'', also labelled as the 'Druze Party') was a short-lived, one-man [[List of political parties in Israel|political faction]] in [[Israel]]. 

==Background==
The party was established on 11 April 1967 during the [[Israeli legislative election, 1965|sixth Knesset]], when [[Jabr Muadi]] left [[Cooperation and Brotherhood]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.knesset.gov.il/faction/eng/FactionHistoryAll_eng.asp Mergers and Splits Among Parliamentary Groups] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before the [[Israeli legislative election, 1969|1969 elections]], Muadi joined [[Progress and Development]], thus effectively swapping parties with [[Elias Nakhleh]], who had begun the session as a member of Progress and Development, then left to set up the [[Jewish–Arab Brotherhood]] before joining Cooperation and Brotherhood.

The '''Margaret Herrick Library,''' located in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], [[California]], is the main repository of print, graphic and research materials of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] (AMPAS). The library contains a digital repository and has historical materials that include those relating to the [[Oscars]] awards show.&lt;ref name="HReporter"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Hilary|title=Oscars: Who Came Up With the Name "Oscar" and More About the Statuette's History (Video)|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-who-came-up-name-774775|accessdate=3 February 2016|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AMPAS"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Osborne|first1=Robert|title=The Origin of Oscar|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_thW3N98cFQ|accessdate=3 February 2016|work=Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences|date=17 February 2015|format=video}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collection ==
The library has in excess of 1,000 collections including original film scripts, movie production records, correspondence and other materials pertaining to movie studios, production companies, individuals, and professional organizations.

The library also collects and maintains [[oral histories]] of the industry.&lt;ref name="LibGig-Spotlight-Herrick-2008"&gt;{{cite news|title=Spotlight: The Margaret Herrick Library in Los Angeles|url=http://www.libgig.com/herrick|accessdate=4 February 2016|work=LibGig|date=2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011211545/http://www.libgig.com/herrick|archivedate=11 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The original research library was created in 1928, a year after the founding of AMPAS.&lt;ref name=AMPAS-FilmHistoryTrailblazer-2015&gt;{{cite news|title=Margaret Herrick, Film History Trailblazer|url=http://www.oscars.org/news/margaret-herrick-film-history-trailblazer|accessdate=3 February 2016|work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ALA-LoveLibraries-HarrisMehr-2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Margaret Herrick, The Academy's First Librarian|url=http://www.ilovelibraries.org/article/margaret-herrick-academy’s-first-librarian|work=I Love Libraries|publisher=[[American Library Association]]|accessdate=23 September 2013|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is funded by the Academy Foundation, which is AMPAS' educational division. It one of the biggest film research libraries in the world,{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} holding in excess of 32,000 books, 80,000 screenplays, and 300,000 files of clippings. Other materials at the library are 35,000 posters, 10 million photographs, copies of 2,400 periodicals, costume and production and costume sketches, sheet music and musical scores, and advertising materials, including press books and lobby cards. There are also artifacts such as Academy Award statuettes. The library is governed by the Academy's Board of Governors.&lt;ref name=AMPAS-FilmHistoryTrailblazer-2015 /&gt;

In 1947, Herrick was responsible for the first acquisition of an archival collection: the [[William Selig]] collection.&lt;ref name=AMPAS-FilmHistoryTrailblazer-2015 /&gt;

In 1953, Herrick worked to have [[The Oscars]] broadcast on television, which allowed the award ceremony and the library to become financially independent of the studios, upon which the show and library had been previously wholly reliant.&lt;ref name=AMPAS-FilmHistoryTrailblazer-2015 /&gt;

AMPAS' research library was renamed for [[Margaret Herrick]], who served as AMPAS librarian from 1936 to 1943 before becoming executive director from 1945 to 1971, upon her retirement in 1971. Dedicated to AMPAS' mission of broadening the film industry's educational and cultural outreach, Herrick was responsible for establishing the library as a world-class research institution.&lt;ref name=ALA-LoveLibraries-HarrisMehr-2011 /&gt;

In its inception, the Academy library had offices in the [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Roosevelt Hotel]].&lt;ref name=AMPAS-FilmHistoryTrailblazer-2015 /&gt; The library moved to its current building, a former waterworks, in Beverly Hills in 1971.&lt;ref name=Dodd-WhatsInAName-2007&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dodd|first1=Philip|title=What's in a Name?: From Joseph P.

[[File:ViennaDioscoridesPlant.jpg|right|thumb|Page from the 6th century ''[[Vienna Dioscurides]]'', an illuminated version of the 1st century ''De Materia Medica'']]
'''''Materia medica''''' ({{lang-en|medical material/substance}}) is a [[Latin]] term for the body of collected knowledge about the therapeutic properties of any substance used for healing (i.e., [[medicine]]s). The term derives from the title of a work by the Ancient Greek physician [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] in the 1st century AD, ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De materia medica]]'', 'On medical material' (Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς, ''Peri hylēs iatrikēs'', in Greek). The term ''materia medica'' was used from the period of the [[Roman Empire]] until the 20th century, but has now been generally replaced in medical education contexts by the term '''pharmacology'''. The term survives in the title of the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''{{'}}s "Materia Non Medica" column.

==Ancient==

===Ancient Egypt===
The earliest known writing about medicine was a 110-page Egyptian papyrus. It was supposedly written by the god Thoth in about 16 BC. The [[Ebers papyrus]] is an ancient recipe book dated to approximately 1552 BC. It contains a mixture of magic and medicine with invocations to banish disease and a catalogue of useful plants, minerals, magic [[amulet]]s and spells.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1927"&gt;Le Wall, Charles. ''The Curious Lore of Drugs and Medicines: Four Thousand Years of Pharmacy.'' (Garden City, New York: Garden City Publishing Co. Inc: 1927)&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous Egyptian physician was [[Imhotep]], who lived in [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] around 2500 B.C. Imhotep’s materia medica consisted of procedures for treating head and torso injuries, tending of wounds, and prevention and curing of infections, as well as advanced principles of hygiene.

===Ancient India===
In India, the [[Ayurveda]] is traditional medicine that emphasizes plant-based treatments, hygiene, and balance in the body’s state of being. Indian materia medica included knowledge of plants, where they grow in all season, methods for storage and shelf life of harvested materials. It also included directions for making juice from vegetables, dried powders from herb, cold infusions and extracts.&lt;ref name="autogenerated650"&gt;Parker, Linette A. "A Brief History of Materia Medica," in ''The American Journal of Nursing'', Vol.15, No. 8 (May 1915). pp 650-653.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient China===
The earliest [[Chinese herbology|Chinese manual of materia medica]], the ''[[Shen nong ben cao jing|Shennong Bencao Jing]]'' (''Shennong Emperor's Classic of Materia Medica''), was compiled in the 1st century AD during the [[Han dynasty]], attributed to the mythical [[Shennong]]. It lists some 365 medicines, of which 252 are herbs. Earlier literature included lists of prescriptions for specific ailments, exemplified by the ''[[Wushi'er bingfang|Recipes for Fifty-Two Ailments]]'' found in the Mawangdui tomb, which was sealed in 168 BC. Succeeding generations augmented the ''Shennong Bencao Jing'', as in the ''[[Yaoxing Lun]]'' (''Treatise on the Nature of Medicinal Herbs''), a 7th-century [[Tang Dynasty]] treatise on herbal medicine.

===Hippocrates===
In Greece, [[Hippocrates]] (born 460 BC) was a philosopher later known as the Father of Medicine. He founded a school of medicine that focused on treating the causes of disease rather than its symptoms. Disease was dictated by natural laws and therefore could be treated through close observation of symptoms. His treatises, ''Aphorisms'' and ''Prognostics'', discuss 265 drugs, the importance of diet and external treatments for diseases.&lt;ref name="autogenerated650"/&gt;

===Theophrastus===
[[Theophrastus]] (390–280 BC) was a disciple of [[Aristotle]] and a philosopher of [[natural history]], considered by historians as the Father of Botany. He wrote a treatise entitled ''Historia Plantarium'' about 300 B.C. It was the first attempt to organize and classify plants, plant lore, and botanical morphology in Greece. It provided physicians with a rough taxonomy of plants and details of medicinal herbs and herbal concoctions.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;Le Wall, Charles. ''The Curious Lore of Drugs and Medicines: Four Thousand Years of Pharmacy.'' (Garden City, New York: Garden City Publishing Co. Inc: 1927) and Riddle, John M.''Dioscorides on pharmacy and medicine.'' (Austin: University of Texas Press,1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galen===
[[Galen]] was a philosopher, physician, pharmacist and prolific medical writer. He compiled an extensive record of the medical knowledge of his day and added his own observations. He wrote on the structure of organs, but not their uses; the pulse and its association with respiration; the arteries and the movement of blood; and the uses of [[theriac]]s. "In treatises such as ''On Theriac to Piso'', ''On Theriac to Pamphilius'', and ''On Antidotes'', Galen identified theriac as a sixty-four-ingredient compound, able to cure any ill known".&lt;ref&gt;Findlen, Paula. ''Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Early Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy.'' (Berkeley, Los Angeles, &amp; London: University of California Press, 1994): 241.&lt;/ref&gt; His work was rediscovered in the 15th century and became the authority on medicine and healing for the next two centuries. His medicine was based on the regulation of the four humors (blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile) and their properties (wet, dry, hot, and cold).&lt;ref&gt;Le Wall, Charles. ''The Curious Lore of Drugs and Medicines: Four Thousand Years of Pharmacy.'' (Garden City, New York: Garden City Publishing Co. Inc: 1927) and Parker, Linette A. "A Brief History of Materia Medica," in ''The American Journal of Nursing'', Vol.15, No. 9 (June 1915). pp 729-734.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dioscorides's ''De Materia Medica''===
[[File:Dioscorides De Materia Medica Byzantium 15th century.jpg|thumb|[[Dioscorides]], ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'', [[Byzantium]], 15th century.]]
[[File:Dioscorides De Materia Medica Spain 12th 13th century.jpg|thumb|Dioscorides ''De Materia Medica'' in [[Arabic]], [[Spain]], 12th-13th century.]]

{{main|De Materia Medica}}

The Greek physician [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], of Anazarbus in Asia Minor, wrote a five-volume treatise concerning medical matters, entitled Περὶ ὕλης ἰατρικῆς in Greek or ''[[De Materia Medica (Dioscorides)|De Materia Medica]]'' in Latin. This famous commentary covered about 600 plants along with therapeutically useful animal and mineral products. It documented  the effects of drugs made from these substances on patients. ''De Materia Medica'' was the first extensive [[pharmacopeia]], including about a thousand natural product drugs (mostly plant-based), 4,740 medicinal usages for drugs, and 360 medical properties (such as [[antiseptic]], [[anti-inflammatory]], [[stimulant]]). The book was heavily translated, and portrayed some of the emblematic actions of physicians and herbalists. One such page is ''[[Physician Preparing an Elixir]]''.

Dioscorides' plant descriptions use an elementary classification, though he cannot be said to have used [[Botanical nomenclature|botanical taxonomy]]. Book one describes the uses for aromatic oils, [[salve]]s and [[topical|ointments]], trees and [[shrubs]], and fleshy fruits, even if not aromatic. Book two included uses for animals, parts of animals, animal products, cereals, [[legume|leguminous]], malvaceous, [[Cruciferous vegetables|cruciferous]], and other garden herbs. Book three detailed the properties of roots, juices, herbs and seeds used for food or medicine. Book four continued to describe the uses for roots and herbs, specifically [[narcotic]] and poisonous medicinal plants. Book five dealt with the medicinal uses for wine and metallic [[ore]]s.&lt;ref name="Obaldeston"&gt;Osbaldeston, Tess Anne ''Dioscorides''(Ibidis Press,2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Minta. ''Medieval Herbals: The Illustrative Traditions.'' (London: The British Library and University of Toronto Press, 2000): 32.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a precursor to all modern pharmacopeias, and is considered one of the most influential herbal books in history. It remained in use until about 1600 AD.&lt;ref name="Riddle&amp;Linette"&gt;Parker, Linette A. "A Brief History of Materia Medica," in ''The American Journal of Nursing'', Vol.15, No. 9 (June 1915). pp 729-734 and Riddle, John M. ''Dioscorides on pharmacy and medicine.'' (Austin: University of Texas Press,1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval==

===Islamic===
The [[experiment]]al [[scientific method]] was introduced into the field of materia medica in the thirteenth century by the [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]]-Arab botanist [[Abu al-Abbas al-Nabati]], the teacher of Ibn al-Baitar. Al-Nabati introduced [[empirical]] techniques in the testing, description and identification of numerous materia medica, and he separated unverified reports from those supported by actual tests and observations. This allowed the study of materia medica to evolve into the [[science]] of [[pharmacology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Toby |last=Huff |year=2003 |title=The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China, and the West |page=218 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=0-521-52994-8 |oclc=50730734}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Avicenna]] (980–1037 AD) was a Persian philosopher, physician, and Islamic scholar. He wrote about 40 books on medicine. His two most famous books are ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' and ''[[The Book of Healing]]'', used in medieval universities as medical textbooks. He did much to popularize the connection between Greek and Arabic medicine, translating works by Hippocrates, Aristotle and Galen into Arabic. Avicenna stressed the importance of diet, exercise, and hygiene. He also was the first to describe parasitic infection, to use urine for diagnostic purposes and discouraged physicians from the practice of surgery because it was too base and manual.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1927"/&gt;

===European===
In medieval Europe, medicinal herbs and plants were cultivated in monastery and nunnery gardens beginning about the 8th century. [[Charlemagne]] gave orders for the collection of medicinal plants to be grown systematically in his royal garden. This royal garden was an important precedent for [[botanical garden]]s and [[physic garden]]s that were established in the 16th century. It was also the beginning of the study of [[botany]] as a separate discipline. In about the 12th century, medicine and pharmacy began to be taught in universities.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Shabbethai Ben Abraham, better known as [[Shabbethai Donnolo]], (913–''c''.982) was a 10th-century Italian Jew and the author of an early Hebrew text, ''Antidotarium''. It consisted of detailed drug descriptions, medicinal remedies, practical methods for preparing medicine from roots. It was a veritable glossary of herbs and drugs used during the medieval period. Donnollo was widely travelled and collected information from Arabic, Greek and Roman sources.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1927"/&gt;

In the Dark and Middle Ages [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Christians were banished for their heretical views that they carried to [[Asia Minor]]. The Greek text was translated into Syriac when pagan Greek scholars fled east after [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]’s conquest of [[Byzantium]],
[[Stephanos]] (son of Basilios, a Christian living in [[Baghdad]] under the Khalif Motawakki) made an Arabic translation of ''De Materia Medica'' from the Greek in 854. In 948 the Byzantine Emperor [[Romanus II]], son and co-regent of Constantine [[Porphyrogenitos]], sent a beautifully illustrated Greek manuscript of ''De Materia Medica'' to the Spanish Khalif, [[Abd-Arrahman III]].  In 1250, Syriac scholar [[Bar Hebraeus]] prepared an illustrated Syriac version, which was translated into Arabic.&lt;ref name="Obaldeston" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karlikata, E.: Dioscorides ve Materia Medica(Kitab'ül Hasayis). Olusum yil 7 Sayi 28 (1999) 50.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sonneddecker, G. Kremers and Urdang's history of Pharmacy, 3rd edition, Lippincott Company, America 1963 p.15)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early modern==

[[Matthaeus Silvaticus]], [[Avicenna]], [[Galen]], [[Dioscorides]], Platearius and Serapio inspired the appearance of three main works printed in [[Mainz]]: In 1484 the ''[[Herbarius]]'', the following year the ''[[Gart der Gesundheit]]'', and in 1491 the ''[[Ortus Sanistatus]]''. The works contain 16, 242 and 570 references to Dioscorides, respectively.&lt;ref name="Riddle&amp;Linette" /&gt;

The first appearance of Dioscorides as a printed book was a Latin translation printed at [[Colle di Val d'Elsa|Colle]], Italy by [[Johanemm Allemanun de Mdemblik]] in 1478. The Greek version appeared in 1499 by [[Manutius]] at [[Venice]].

The most useful books of botany, pharmacy and medicine used by students and scholars were supplemented commentaries on Dioscorides, including the works of [[Leonhart Fuchs|Fuchs]], [[Anguillara]], [[Andrea Mattioli|Mattioli]], [[Bartolomeo Maranta|Maranta]], [[Cesalpino]], [[Dodoens]], Fabius Columna, [[Gaspard Bauhin|Gaspard]] and [[Johann Bauhin]], and [[Servetus|De Villanueva/Servetus]]. In several of these versions, the annotations and comments exceed the Dioscoridean text and have much new botany. Printers were not merely printing the authentic materia medica, but hiring experts on the medical and botanical field for criticism, commentaries, that would raise the stature of the printers and the work.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

Most of these authors copied each other, from previous works. It was normal to add previous commentaries and marginalia, to make the text look more enriched or thorough.

There were several De Materia Medica works noted as ''Anonymous A, B, C and D'' by the expert on Dioscorides-De Materia Medica professor [[John M. Riddle]]. The ''Anonymous A'' has to do with authors on translations of handwritting. Riddle proved ''Anonymous C'' to be Bruyerinus Champier.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

During the 16th century, the most representative among them were [[Ermolao Barbaro]], Jean Ruel, Broyeurinus, Michel de Villeneuva, [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]], [[Andres Laguna]], Marcello Virgilio, Martin Mathee and [[Valerius Cordus]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obaldeston" /&gt;

The work of the Italian physician and humanist Ermolao Barbaro was published in 1516, 23 years after his death. [[Poliziano]] wrote to Ermalao Barbaro, forwarding a manuscript of the 1st-century pharmacologist [[Pedanius Dioscorides]], asking him to send it back “annotated by that very learned hand of yours, thus lending the volume additional value and authority."&lt;ref&gt;‘[A]d me remittes ... pretium volumini aliquod ex te atque auctoritas accedat.’ Poliziano, Letters I.xi:&lt;/ref&gt; Barbaro was professor of the [[University of Padua]] in 1477 and translated many texts from Greek to Latin.&lt;ref name="Branca"&gt;Branca 1973, Reeds 1976&lt;/ref&gt;
He sought to avoid mistakes by gathering as many manuscripts as he could for checking the texts. He claimed to have corrected 5000 mistakes between two editions of [[Pliny the Elder]]'s ''Naturalis historia'',&lt;ref&gt;(2003 Frank N. Egerton Bulletin of the Ecological Society of America, A History of the Ecological Sciences&lt;/ref&gt; a work he found very similar to ''Materia Medica'', for which he used at least two editions as well.

The result of Barbaro's effort occupied no fewer than 58 pages printed in three columns of about 50 entries each. The work provides a key to over 9,000 items; all references were to pages. This was the first annotated Latin translation of Dioscorides' ''Materia Medica'', and so Barbaro became the earliest of the [[Renaissance]] translators of Dioscorides,&lt;ref name="Branca" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Palmer
Medical botany in northern Italy in the Renaissance Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine Volume 78 February 1985&lt;/ref&gt; a practice that saw its golden age in the 16th century. Barbaro's work was later corrected by Giovanni-Battista.

===Jean Ruel===

Jean Ruel was the dean of the Faculty of Medicine and physician to King [[Francis I of France]]. He perfected the Latin translation of the ''Materia Medica'' directly from the "''princeps''" edition. He tried to develop a translation joining [[philology]], [[botany]] and [[medicine]]. This work, printed in 1516 by [[Henri Estienne (elder)|Henri Estienne/Stephano]], became very popular, having 20 editions during the 16th century. He published editions until 1537, printed by [[Simon de Colines]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obaldeston" /&gt;

From this point, Latin was the preferred language for presenting De Materia Medica, and Ruel's editions became the basis from which many other important authors would start to create their own Materia Medica. Ruel was also teacher of two great De Materia Medica authors: Michel de Villeneuve and Andres Laguna.&lt;ref name="Obaldeston" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Universal Illustrated American Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bruyerinus===

Bruyerinus Champier was the nephew of [[Symphorien Champier]], and physician of [[Henry II of France]]. He was an Arabist, and translated works of [[Avicena]].&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Charles Joseph. 'The herbal in antiquity and its transmission to later ages', in Journal of Hellenic Studies, vol 47, 1927, pp1-52 &amp; 10 col plates.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1550 he published his first Materia Medica, printed by Balthazar Arnoullet in [[Lyon]]s. This work had a second edition in 1552 printed by Arnoullet in Lyon and [[Vienne, Isère|Vienne]]. Both works were illustrated with figures by [[Leonhart Fuchs|Fuchs]], but in this last edition there were also 30 woodcuts by the botanist and physician Jacob Dalechamp.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Riddle, John M. 'The latin alphabetical Dioscorides', in Proceedings of XIIIth international congress of the history of science, Moscow, August 18–24, 1971, Nauka, Moscow 1974, sec 4&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that the reason that he used his initials, H.B.P., and not his full name in the work; it could be that he practically transcribed commentaries of [[Andrea Mattioli|Mattioli]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riddle|first1=John M.|title=Dioscorides|journal=[[Catalogus Translationum et Commentariorum]]|date=1980|volume=4|pages=82, 92|url=http://catalogustranslationum.org/PDFs/volume04/v04_dioscorides.pdf|accessdate=28 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2015|reason=Whose initials are HBP?}}

===Michael Servetus===

According to Spanish scholar González Echeverría&lt;ref&gt;[http://michaelservetusresearch.com/ENGLISH/works.html Michael Servetus Research] website with graphicl study of the medical works by Servetus&lt;/ref&gt; in several communications in the [[International Society for the History of Medicine|ISHM]],&lt;ref name="BarcelonaCongress"&gt;2011 September 9th, Francisco González Echeverría VI International Meeting for the History of Medicine,(S-11: Biographies in History of Medicine (I)), Barcelona. New Discoveries on the biography of Michael De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus) &amp; New discoverys on the work of Michael De Villeneuve (Michael Servetus)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KosCongress"&gt;1996 “Sesma's Dioscorides or Medical Matter: an unknown work of Michael Servetus (I)” and “ Sesma's Dioscorides or Medical Matter: an unknown work of Michael Servetus (II)” González Echeverría, Francisco Javier. In : Book of Abstracts. 35th International Congress on the History of Medicine, 2nd-8th, September, 1996, Kos Island, Greece, communications nº: 6 y 7, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TunisCongress"&gt;1998 “The book of work of Michael Servetus for his Dioscorides and his Dispensarium”(Le livre de travail de Michel Servet pour ses Dioscorides et Dispensarium) and “The Dispensarium or Enquiridion, complementary of the Dioscorides of Michael Servetus” ( The Enquiridion, L’oeuvre Le Dispensarium ou Enquiridion complémentaire sur le Dioscorides de Michel Servet) González Echeverría, in : Book of summaries, 36th International Congress on the History of Medicine, Tunis (Livre des Résumés, 36 ème Congrès International d’ Histoire de la médicine, Tunis), 6th - 11th Septembre 1998, (two comunicacions), pp. 199 y 210.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[John M. Riddle]] ''Anonymous B'' (De Materia Medica of 1543) would be [[Michael Servetus]], and that the ''Anonymous D'' (De Materia Medica of 1554 of [[Andrea Mattioli|Mattioli]] plus non-signed commentaries) is two commentarians, Servetus and [[Andrea Mattioli|Mattioi]], being the last one hired for editing the "''[[Lyon]]s printers' Tribute to Michel de Villeneuve''"&lt;ref name="Tribute"&gt;Term coined by Gonzalez Echeverria&lt;/ref&gt; edition.
Michael Servetus, using the name "Michel de Villeneuve", who already had his first death sentence from the [[University of Paris]], anonymously published a Dioscorides-De Materia Medica in 1543, printed by Jean &amp; Francois Frellon in Lyon.&lt;ref name="1543Dioscorides"&gt;1997 “Michael Servetus, editor of the Dioscorides”, González Echeverría, Francisco Javier. Institute of Sijenienses Studies “Michael Servetus” ed, Villanueva de Sijena, Larrosa ed and “Ibercaja”, Zaragoza.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has 277 marginalia and 20 commentaries on a De Materia Medica of Jean Ruel.&lt;ref name="1543Dioscorides" /&gt;  According to Gonzalez Echeverría, to be associated to an anonymous [[Pharmacopeia]] that "Michel de Villeneuve" published the same year, meant to be a single unit,&lt;ref name="TunisCongress" /&gt; which is typical when it comes to De Materia Medica-Pharmacopeia. This work had six later editions, in 1546 and 1547 by Jean Frellon, who considered Michael de Villeneuve "his friend and brother", another in 1547 by Thibaut Payen, etc.&lt;ref name="1543Dioscorides"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Love for truth"&gt;2011 “The love for truth. Life and work of Michael Servetus”, (El amor a la verdad. Vida y obra de Miguel Servet.), printed by Navarro y Navarro, Zaragoza, collaboration with the Government of Navarra, Department of Institutional Relations and Education of the Government of Navarra, 607 pp, 64 of them illustrations.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1554Arnoullet.jpg|upright|thumb|One of the four covers (Arnoullet)  of the "''[[Lyon]]s printers' tribute edition to Michel de Villeneuve''"&lt;ref name="Tribute" /&gt; edition of the Materia Medica. By [[Servetus|Michel de Villeneuve]] &amp; [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]], printed by Balthazar Arnoullet in 1554, in Lyons.]]

There is another Materia Medica with commentaries&lt;ref name="BarcelonaCongress" /&gt; on a Ruel edition of 1537, printed by [[Simon de Colines]]. This work contains hundreds of manuscript marginaia, all along 420 out of 480 pages. The scholar Gonzalez Echeverria demonstrated in the [[International Society for the History of Medicine|ISHM]]&lt;ref name="BarcelonaCongress" /&gt; with a graphological, historical and linguistic study that this task was carried out by Michel de Villeneuve. It also demonstrated that this document was written by the same hand that wrote the famous&lt;ref name="Love for truth" /&gt; "Manuscript of Paris", a work also by Michel de Villeneuve, consisting of a draft for his Christianismo Restitutio. “The manuscript of the [[Complutense University of Madrid|Complutense]]” is not just a union of the ideas of the previous works by Michel de Villeneuve, Syropum Ratio, etc., but also of the later works, Enquiridion,&lt;ref name="TunisCongress" /&gt; De Materia Medica of 1543,&lt;ref name="1543Dioscorides" /&gt; sharing with this last many of its 20 big commentaries, for instance.&lt;ref name="Love for truth" /&gt;

According to this theory, in 1554,&lt;ref name="BarcelonaCongress" /&gt; after the immolation of Michael de Villeneuve/Servetus, the editors and printers that had worked with him would have decided to make a new De Materia Medica as a tribute to their colleague and friend.&lt;ref name="BarcelonaCongress" /&gt; All the commentaries that could identify Michel de Villeneuve as the author disappeared,&lt;ref name="Love for truth" /&gt; but the rest are copied from his work of 1543. It is a very strange edition because there exist four different kinds of copies with different covers, one per editor: Jean Frellon, [[Guillaume Rouillé]], Antoine Vicent and Balthazar Arnoullet, who was also the printer of this unique edition, in [[Lyon]]s.&lt;ref name="BarcelonaCongress" /&gt; For developing a bigger work and to blur the mark of Michel de Villeneuve, they hired the expert on De Materia Medica, [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]].&lt;ref name="Love for truth" /&gt;

===Pietro Andrea Mattioli===

{{main article|Pietro Andrea Mattioli}}
Pietro Andrea Mattioli was a renowned botanist and physician. He published a translation of De Materia Medica&lt;ref name="Genaust"&gt;Genaust, Helmut (1976). Etymologisches Wörterbuch der botanischen Pflanzennamen&lt;/ref&gt; into Italian in 1544 and ten years later published a work in Latin with all the plants of [[Dioscorides]] and 562 woodcut illustrations.&lt;ref name="Obaldeston" /&gt; It appeared in 1554, printed by Vicenzo Valgrisi, in [[Venice]]. Mattioli made a massive contribution to the original text of Pedani's Dioscorides.&lt;ref name="Genaust" /&gt; In some sections Mattioli added information that exceeded 15 times the length of the original text.  It resulted in a very big extension of the work, in beauty and information. It was later translated into German, French and [[Bohemian]].&lt;ref name="Obaldeston" /&gt;

Mattioli held a post in the Imperial Court as physician to [[Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria]],&lt;ref name="Genaust" /&gt; and the Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor]].&lt;ref name="Obaldeston" /&gt; This position granted him an immense influence. He frequently tested the effects of poisonous plants on prisoners in order to popularize his works.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt; He also affirmed that Jean Ruel had declared some information in the licopsis chapter of his Materia Medica. This is false, but still Mattioli used it as a reason for attacking Ruel.&lt;ref name="Obaldeston" /&gt; He did not tolerate either rivals nor corrections. The naturalists and physicians daring to disagree with him, or who had corrected him, were attacked. The list of important characters that were admonished, rebuked, or pursued by the [[Inquisition]] contains Wieland, [[Anguillara]], [[Conrad Gesner|Gesner]], [[Amato Lusitano|Lusitanus]] and others. This made editions of Matioli's De Materia Medica omnipresent throughout the continent, especially in northern Europe.&lt;ref name="Genaust" /&gt;

===Andres Laguna===

{{main article|Andres Laguna}}
In 1554 the physician Andres Laguna published his Annotations on [[Dioscorides]] of [[Anazarbus]]&lt;ref name="Delapena"&gt;De la Pena, A (January 1963). "Two great physicians of the sixteenth century. (Andres LAGUNA)". The Journal of the International College of Surgeons&lt;/ref&gt; printed by [[Guillaume Rouillé]] in Lyons. Laguna was the first to translate De Materia Medica into [[Spanish Language|Castilian]].&lt;ref name="Delapena" /&gt; His translation was made from one of the Latin editions of Jean Ruel. It was also based on classes Laguna took from Ruel as his pupil in Paris. Laguna points out some of his teacher's erroneous translations, and adds many commentaries, which make up more than half of the total work.

Laguna explored&lt;ref name="Delapena" /&gt; many [[Mediterranean]] areas and obtained results concerning many new herbs; he also added these prescriptions and commentaries to the recipes and teachings of Pedanius' Dioscorides. He also includes some animal and mineral products but only those related to simple medicines, that is, animal and [[mineral]] products that are medicine or are parts of a medical compound.&lt;ref name="aljamia"&gt;2002 Rebeca Orihuela Salcho, Aljamia vol 14 University of Oviedo&lt;/ref&gt; This was not an illustrated work. In 1555 he re-edited this work with [[woodcuts]].&lt;ref name="Delapena" /&gt;
It was reprinted twenty-two times by the end of the 18th century; Laguna wrote very well, with explanations and practical commentaries.&lt;ref name="aljamia" /&gt; He refers to anecdotes, adds commentaries on the plants, provides their synonyms in different languages, and explains their uses in the 16th century. These qualities and the number of woodcuts made this work very popular and appreciated in medicine far beyond the 16th century. He had problems with Mattioli for using some of his commentaries without mentioning him.&lt;ref name="aljamia" /&gt;

Laguna had problems with the [[Inquisition]], just like [[Servetus|Michel de Villeneuve]], for both were [[jewish]]-[[converso]],&lt;ref&gt;Immanuel Jakobovits, Jewish Medical Ethics: A Comparative and Historical Study of the Jewish Religious Attitude to Medicine and its Practice, 2nd ex. ed. (w:st="on"New York: Bloch, 1975; orig. 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; a fact that could have made them limit their commentaries to avoid risks. Nevertheless, he was the physician of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] and the [[Pope Julius III]],&lt;ref name="Delapena" /&gt; and that helped to establish his work as the last word in Materia Medica, and as the basis of Spanish botany.&lt;ref&gt;Aron Gurevich, Medieval Popular Culture: Problems of Belief and Perception, trans. János M. Bak and Paul A. Hollingsworth (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press and Paris: Editions de la Maison des Sciences de l’Homme, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===Valerius Cordus===
{{main article|Valerius Cordus}}

The physician Valerius Cordus, son of the famous botanist Euricius Cordus, went through many woods and mountains discovering hundreds of new herbs.&lt;ref&gt;DURLING, Richard J.-A catalogue of Sixteenth Century Printed Books in the National Library of medicine., Bethesda, MD, US Dept. of Health, NLM, 16thc.1967.&lt;/ref&gt; He gave lectures on Dioscorides at the [[University of Wittenberg]], which experts from the University attended. Cordus had no intention of publishing his work. Five years after his death, a Materia Medica with commentaries was published.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, Edward Lee, Landmarks of Botanical Science&lt;/ref&gt; It contained the index of the ''Botanologicon'', the outstanding work of his father Euricius, who developed a scientific classification of the plants. The following pages are on [[Conrad Gesner|Gesner]]'s Nomenclature,&lt;ref&gt;Hans H. Wellisch Conrad Gessner: A Bio-bibliography, 2nd revised and enlarged edition. Zug, Switzerland: Inter Documentation Company, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;  relating the different synonyms used for referring to the same plants of the Dioscorides work.

The abstracts of the lectures of Valerius Cordus go from page 449 to 553 as commentaries. This section consisted of a very refined explanation of Dioscorides' teachings with more specifics on the variety of plants&lt;ref&gt;Nissen, Claus. Herbals of five centuries, L’Art Ancien, Zurich, Robert Wolfe, Munich and Weiss-Hesse, Olten, 1958&lt;/ref&gt; and habitats, and corrections of errors. Cordus refers to both his and his father's observations. [[Eucharius Rösslin]]'s herbal&lt;ref&gt;Theodor Husemann (1876) (in German). "Cordus, Valerius". In Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie&lt;/ref&gt; illustrations are prominent in this work, followed by 200 of [[Leonhart Fuchs|Fuchs]]. This work and the model of botanical description and, many consider it the boldest innovation that was made by any botanist of the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Nissen, Claus. Die botanische buchillustration, ihre geschichte und bibliographie, A Hiersemann, Stuttgart, 2 vols, 1951, Supplement, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Martin Mathee===

The French physician Martin Mathee published in 1553 the French translation of De Materia Medica, printed by Balthazar Arnoullet, in Lyons. This granted much more access for the students of medicine to the teachings.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

The Greek version was reprinted in 1518, 1523 and 1529, and reprinted in 1518, 1523 and 1529. Between 1555 and 1752 there were at least 12 Spanish editions; and as many in Italian from 1542. French editions appeared from 1553; and German editions from 1546.&lt;ref name="Obaldeston" /&gt;

==Materia non medica==

The ancient phrase survives in modified form in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]''{{'}}s long-established "Materia Non Medica" column, the title indicating non-medical material that doctors wished to report from their travels and other experiences. For example, in June 1977, the journal contained "Materia Non Medica" reports on an exhibition at the [[Whitechapel Art Gallery]] by a London physician, the making of matches by hand in an Indian village by a [[missionary]] general practitioner, and a cruise to Jamaica by a [[University of the West Indies]] lecturer in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Materia Non Medica |journal=BMJ |volume=1 |issue=6077 |date=25 June 1977 |pages=1657–1657  |doi=10.1136/bmj.1.6077.1657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Mississippi Secession Ordinance''' was written by [[Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar (II)]], who resigned from the [[U.S. Congress]] in January 1861.&lt;ref name="nrhpinv3"&gt;{{cite web|url={{NRHP url|id=75001048}} |title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar House |date=June 1, 1974 |author=George R. Adams |publisher=National Park Service}} and {{NRHP url|id=75001048|title=''Accompanying two photos, exterior, from 1974''|photos=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Local ordinance|ordinance]] was signed by [[James Z. George]] and others.

Text of Ordinance:

{{quote|AN ORDINANCE to dissolve the union between the [[State of Mississippi]] and other [[States of the United States|States]] united with her under the compact entitled "The [[Constitution of the United States of America]]".

The '''"O. P. Q. Letters"''' were a pair of anonymous letters (dated 28 January and 7 February 1834) which were meant to incite the people of [[Texas]] to [[insurrection]] against [[Mexico]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The grounds for insurrection were the arrest and imprisonment of [[Stephen F. Austin]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} The letters received their name because both were signed "O. P. Q."

==Origins==
Although the letters were anonymous, their source is known: both were written by [[Anthony Butler (ambassador)|Anthony Butler]], who was at the time the [[United States|American]] minister to Mexico.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Butler was attempting to effect the purchase of Texas by the United States, and felt that rebellion might persuade Mexico to sell.  The first of the two, addressed to "Don B.T.A", was sent to [[Branch Tanner Archer]]; whether or not the second was meant for the same address is unknown. They characterized the arrest of Austin as cowardly, and claimed it was done by "an ignorant, fanatical and arrogant race." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/emo01 TSHA Online - Texas State Historical Association&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the forthcoming inspection trip to be made by [[Colonel]] [[Juan Altamonte]] was called no more than a cynical attempt to please white Texan settlers.

Both letters soon were copied, and these copies were given to Colonel Altamonte in the summer of 1834, during his trip.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Both the originals and these copies have since been lost. For his part, Altamonte forwarded translations of the letters to the Mexican government.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Effects==
Their tone and the worsening of Texas politics notwithstanding, apparently the letters had little effect. Many leading colonists {{who|date=March 2015}} distrusted Butler; furthermore, Austin had himself written letters urging the settlers to remain calm.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Altamonte was initially skeptical of the possibility that Butler had been involved in sending the letters; once he was convinced, he began suspecting the United States government as well.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} Consequently, in July the colonel wrote a letter to the secretary of foreign relations in [[Mexico City]] recommending that Butler's recall be requested.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}} But the Mexican authorities did nothing, and Butler was not recalled until the following year, and then only because President [[Andrew Jackson]] was displeased with his work.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

The '''Old Tao Nan School''' ({{zh|s=旧道南学校|p=Jiù Dàonán Xuéxiào}}) is a historic building in [[Singapore]], located along [[Armenian Street, Singapore|Armenian Street]] in the [[Museum Planning Area]], within the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]]. The building was originally built for the [[Tao Nan School]] to serve the local [[Hokkien people|Hokkien]] community, but the school has since been relocated to its current location in [[Marine Parade]].  The building was then used as a wing of the [[Asian Civilisations Museum]], and now houses the [[Peranakan Museum]].  It was gazetted as a [[National Monuments of Singapore|national monument]] on 27 February 1998.

==History==
[[Tao Nan School]] was set up by the [[Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan|Singapore Hokkien Association]] (Singapore Hokkien Huay Kuan) on 18 November 1906 to provide modern education for Hokkien Chinese children.&lt;ref name="roots"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://roots.sg/Content/Places/national-monuments/former-tao-nan-school-now-the-peranakan-museum |title=Former Tao Nan School (now The Peranakan Museum) |work=Roots |publisher=National Heritage Board Singapore }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was the first Chinese school in Singapore to adopt modern subjects in its syllabus such as such as geography, history and physical education, in addition to traditional Chinese subjects such as Confucian classics that would help promote and preserve [[Chinese culture]] and values. Although it was originally set up to serve the Hokkien community, it began to accept speakers of other Chinese dialects in 1909, the first Chinese school to operate such inclusive policy.&lt;ref name="roots"/&gt; Lessons were initially conducted in [[Hokkien]] with some Mandarin classes, but English lessons were also introduced in 1914. In 1916, the school became the first Chinese school in Singapore switched its medium of [[education]] from [[Min Nan|Hokkien]] to [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].&lt;ref name="infopedia"/&gt;

The idea for the school was first mooted by [[Tan Boo Liat]], and it gained the support of the Hokkien community.  Funds for the school were raised, and the Siam House on [[North Bridge Road]] was chosen as the premise for the school. The Singapore Hokkien Association also provided an annual subsity for the school. The school was initially named Tao Nan Study Hall (道南學堂, ''Daonan Xuetang''), the name Tao Nan being short for ''wu dao qi nan'' (吾道其南), meaning 'My code of behaviour is promulgated in Southeast Asia'.&lt;ref name="roots"/&gt;  It had 90 students in its first year.  As the number of pupils grew, [[Tan Kah Kee]] proposed that a new building be constructed, and $40,000 was raised by the Hokkien community for the building fund, to which Tan contributed $2,000.  The sugar tycoon [[Oei Tiong Ham|''Majoor'' Oei Tiong Ham]] also gave $10,000 for the purchase of the land on [[Armenian Street, Singapore|Armenian Street]] on which Tao Nan School was built.  Construction began 1910, and the school relocated to the new school building when it was completed in 1912.  The school was then renamed Tao Nan School (Daonan Xuexiao).&lt;ref name="infopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_608_2005-01-04.html |title=Tao Nan School |work=Singapore Infopedia |publisher=National Library Board Singapore }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tan Kah Kee served for 12 years as the school's president. When the school switched to Mandarin as the medium of instruction, the Mandarin syllabus was implemented by its first non-Hokkien principal, Xiong Shangfu, a native of Hunan province.&lt;ref name="peranakan"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://peranakanmuseum.org.sg/about-us/story-of-our-museums |title=Story of Our Museums |work=Peranakan Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school was closed during the [[Japanese Occupation of Singapore|Japanese Occupation]] from 1942 to 1945 when the Japanese took over the school and said to have used it as a military headquarters.&lt;ref name="peranakan"/&gt; After the war, the student population increased rapidly and classes were held in two separate sessions. In 1958, the school then became a government-aided school and also began to emphasize Malay, Chinese, Tamil and English languages in its syllabus in the 1950s and 60s.&lt;ref name="peranakan"/&gt; However, the school's population had declined by the mid-1970s as families moved out of the [[Downtown Core|city center]] to the newly established [[new town|housing estates]] in the suburbs, and in 1976, it was decided that the school should be re-located to [[Marine Parade]] to cater for the suburban population there. In 1982, Tao Nan School moved to its new campus in Marine Parade, where it remains today.&lt;ref name="100 historic places"&gt;{{cite book |work=National Heritage Board |date=2002|title=Singapore's 100 Historic Places|publisher= Archipelago Press|isbn= 981-4068-23-3 |pages=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also in 1982, English became its main medium of instruction.  Throughout its history, the school has produced many prominent Chinese leaders among its alumni, among them [[Lee Kong Chian]].

The school was refurbished and became a wing of the [[Asian Civilisations Museum]] in 1994, and was officially opened on 21 April 1997. The Old Tao Nan School building was [[gazette]]d as a [[National Monuments of Singapore|national monument]] on 27 February 1998.&lt;ref name="roots"/&gt; When the Asian Civilisations Museum was established in [[Empress Place Building]] in 2006 after its renovation, the Old Tao Nan School was repurposed as the Peranakan Museum which opened on 25 April 2008.&lt;ref name="infopedia"/&gt;

The Old Tao Nan School building was designed by the Municipal Engineer's Office of Singapore in an [[Eclecticism in architecture|eclectic]] [[Neo-Classical architecture|classical style]] with elements of the [[French Renaissance]]. The front facade features [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] fluted pilasters, with large wide [[verandah]]s designed to accommodate the [[tropical climate]] of Singapore. It also has large windows and high [[ceiling]]s for better [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] in a hot climate.&lt;ref name="roots"/&gt;&lt;ref name="100 historic places"/&gt; A pair of black cast-iron eagles, said to ward off evil, guard the entrance to the school.&lt;ref name="roots"/&gt;

The building is three-storey high, with a square central [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]] topped with a [[skylight (window)|skylight]]. The classrooms, now converted into galleries, were located on all three floors, and can be accessed via [[symmetrical]] [[staircase]]s on either side of the atrium leading up to the corridors on the upper floors.&lt;ref name="100 historic places"/&gt;

==Peranakan Museum==
{{Main article|Peranakan Museum}}

Today, the Old Tao Nan School building houses the [[Peranakan Museum]] which was opened in April 2008 by Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. The Museum explores the main themes of Peranakan life in ten permanent galleries. Displays include the twelve-day Peranakan wedding and the role of the Nyonyas (female Peranakans).

'''Patrick John O'Connor''' (22 August 1924 – 16 August 1990), was a New Zealand [[Professional wrestling|professional wrestler]]. Regarded as one of the premier [[Work (professional wrestling)|workers]] of his era, O'Connor held the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]] and [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] simultaneously, the latter of which he held for approximately two years. He was also the [[List of AWA World Heavyweight Champions|inaugural AWA World Heavyweight Champion]].&lt;ref name="Hornbaker2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWEBio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/patoconnor|title=Pat O'Connor|publisher=[[WWE]]|work=[[WWE]].com|accessdate=November 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Patrick John O'Connor was born on 22 August 1924 in [[Raetihi]], New Zealand, to parents John Frederick and Isabella. While he attended high school at [[Feilding Agricultural High School]], he also helped tend to the sheep and cattle on his parents' farm. He later attended [[Massey University|Massey Agricultural College]], and later served for six months in the [[New Zealand Air Force|New Zealand Royal Air Force]] in 1945.&lt;ref name="Hornbaker2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DNZB O'Connor"&gt;{{DNZB|title=Patrick John O'Connor|first= Ron|last= Palenski|id=5o2|accessdate=December 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amateur wrestling career ==
Before entering the world of professional wrestling, O'Connor was an [[Amateur wrestling|amateur wrestler]]. He trained under Dave Sparrow, and later Don Anderson, while working as a blacksmith to pay the bills. After a tournament in 1947, he joined the Wellington wrestling team and trained under [[Anton Koolmann]]. In 1948, he represented New Zealand in the Pan American games.&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2006/03/11/1483388.html|title=Chicago's big moment: O'Connor vs Rogers, 1961|author=Oliver, Greg|publisher=SLAM! Wrestling|accessdate=2009-01-07|date=16 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Connor won the New Zealand Heavyweight Championship in amateur wrestling in both 1949 and 1950. The 1949 win earned him entry into the [[1950 British Empire Games]].&lt;ref name="Hornbaker2017"/&gt; At the Empire Games, O'Connor, once again representing New Zealand,&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt; won a silver medal winner in the ([[Freestyle wrestling|freestyle]]) heavyweight division. He later trained to be a professional wrestler under [[Len Levy]].&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt;

== Professional wrestling career ==
=== National Wrestling Alliance ===
On 19 March 1955, O'Connor won the [[NWA World Tag Team Championship (Chicago version)]] with [[tag team]] partner [[Roy McClarity]], and they held the [[Professional wrestling championship|title]] until February 1956. Later in the year, he worked for [[Maple Leaf Wrestling]]. In March, he won the [[NWA British Empire Heavyweight Championship (Toronto version)]], but lost it on 2 May 1957 to [[Gene Kiniski]]. That same month, O'Connor and [[Whipper Billy Watson]] won the [[NWA Canadian Open Tag Team Championship]], but lost it to Gene Kiniski and [[Fritz Von Erich]] on 31 October of that year.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

O'Connor held the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] from 1959 to 1961. He first won the title on 9 January 1959 from [[Dick Hutton]], who had held the title for thirteen months. O'Connor's reign was recognized by both the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] and the [[National Wrestling Association]]. The title change was part of the [[Feud (professional wrestling)|rivalry]] between [[Booking (professional wrestling)|bookers]] [[Sam Muchnick]] and Fred Kohler, the latter of whom did not want to waste any money announcing O'Connor as the new champion. Kohler also wanted O'Connor to pay him $10,000 to wrestle at shows in Chicago, while being paid less than champions usually earned. O'Connor was so angry at the suggestion that he walked out of their meeting and later told Muchnick not to book him for events in Chicago. The men later worked out a deal of sorts, and on 19 February 1960, O'Connor wrestled in Chicago against [[Bruno Sammartino]] and [[Johnny Valentine]], among others.&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hornbaker2017"/&gt;

On 29 July at one of Fred Kohler's events, O'Connor defeated [[Yukon Eric]] at an event with an attendance of 30,275. During this time, television also became a factor in the burgeoning market for professional wrestling, and as a result, the demand to trade wrestlers, including O'Connor, throughout the [[List of National Wrestling Alliance territories|territories]], was eased due to [[Vincent J. McMahon|Vincent McMahon]]'s [[Capitol Wrestling Corporation|Capitol Wrestling]]. In December, he worked for McMahon in the Northeast. In March 1961, he was suspended for sixteen days when he missed a match in New York. On 30 June 1961, O'Connor [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Drop|dropped]] the title to [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] in front of 38,622 fans at [[Comiskey Park]], a North American professional wrestling attendance record that lasted until Toronto's [[The Big Event]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt; The ticket sells of $148,000 was a professional wrestling record for almost twenty years.&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt; The match, a [[two out of three falls match]], was billed as the "Match of the Century".&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt; During the match, both men had gained a [[Professional wrestling#Pinfall|pinfall]], when O'Connor missed a [[dropkick]] and suffered a [[Legit (professional wrestling)|legit]] groin injury on the ropes, after which Rogers [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinned]] him to win the match.&lt;ref name="Hornbaker2017"/&gt;&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt;

=== American Wrestling Association ===
In May 1960, while still the NWA World Heavyweight Champion, the [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) named O'Connor as the first holder of the [[AWA World Heavyweight Championship]] when they seceded from the NWA.&lt;ref name=titles/&gt; Therefore, he held both the AWA and NWA World Heavyweight Championships simultaneously.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; However, he never defended the AWA World Heavyweight Championship, and was stripped of it in August, after ninety days, when [[Verne Gagne]] was recognized as the new champion.&lt;ref name=titles&gt;{{cite book|author=Duncan, Royal &amp; Gary Will|title=Wrestling Title Histories|publisher=Archeus Communications|year=2006|edition=4th|isbn=0-9698161-5-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 November 1967, the team of O'Connor and [[Wilbur Snyder]] defeated [[Larry Hennig]] and [[Harley Race]] to win the [[AWA World Tag Team Championship]]. They lost the title on 2 December to [[Mitsu Arakawa]] and [[Tor Kamata|Dr. Moto]]. O'Connor and Snyder also defeated Arakawa and Moto for the [[World Wrestling Association]]'s [[WWA World Tag Team Championship]] on 24 September 1968. They lost the title on 26 October to the same team.

=== Late career ===
On 13 October 1970, O'Connor was introduced as [[Jim Crockett Promotions]]'s first [[NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship|NWA Eastern States Heavyweight Champion]] as part of a storyline to introduce the title. The title was later awarded to the [[Missouri Mauler]] with the announcement that Mauler won it in New York.

On 1 January 1982, O'Connor was part of the [[Card (sports)|card]] that comprised [[Professional wrestling promoter|promoter]] Sam Muchnick's last professional wrestling show, located in St. Louis. O'Connor was also one of the owners of the [[St. Louis Wrestling Club]]. O'Connor, along with Verne Gagne, [[Harley Race]], and [[Bob Geigel]] purchased the territory from Sam Muchnick the day after Muchnick's retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ted DiBiase: The Million Dollar Man|author=DiBiase, Ted|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=2008|isbn=1-4165-5890-X|pages=106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bang Your Head: The Real Story of the Missing Link|author=Robertson, Dewey and Meredith Renwick|publisher=ECW Press|year=2006|isbn=1-55022-727-0|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 1963, O'Connor was named as a co-conspirator in the monopoly that controlled professional wrestling in Missouri, Kansas, and Iowa. O'Connor filed a counterclaim.&lt;ref name="Hornbaker2017"/&gt;

On 16 November 1987, O'Connor participated in a [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] "old-timers" [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]], which was won by [[Lou Thesz]].

== Death ==  
O'Connor died of cancer on 16 August 1990.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; 

In December 1990, [[World Championship Wrestling]] held the [[WCW tournaments#Pat O'Connor Memorial International Tag Team Tournament|Pat O'Connor Memorial International Cup Tag Team Tournament]], an eight-team international tag team memorial tournament at [[Starrcade (1990)|Starrcade]] in honor of O'Connor. In 1996, he was inducted into the [[Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame]]. In 2007, the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]] inducted O'Connor.&lt;ref name=pwhf/&gt; He is also a member of the [[Stampede Wrestling#Hall of Fame|Stampede Wrestling Hall of Fame]]. In 2016, O'Connor became a [[WWE Hall of Fame#Legacy inductees|"Legacy" member]] of the [[WWE Hall of Fame]].

The '''Programme commun''' (or 'Common Programme') was a reform programme, signed 27 June 1972 by the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]], the [[French Communist Party]] and the centrist [[Radical Party of the Left|Radical Movement of the Left]], which provided a great upheaval in the economic, political and military fields in France. That alliance opened a political repositioning for the left that lasted 30 years, contributing particularly to the election of [[François Mitterrand]] in the presidential election of 1981. Between 1981 and 1983, he began putting ''Programme commun'' into action.&lt;ref name=cite /&gt;

The [[Keynesian]]-inspired policies led to an increase the [[fiscal deficit]] and the [[trade deficit]]. To keep France in the [[European Monetary System]], a different approach was needed.

In March 1983, Mitterrand did a [[U-turn]] by cancelling the parts of ''Programme commun'' that had been already passed, which was sometimes referred to as the "austerity turn".&lt;ref name=cite /&gt;

== Projects ==
* "Living better, changing lives": Reduction of [[Working time|working hours]] (down to 40 hours per week), higher wages, [[Social security in France|social security]] expansion, socialised housing.
* Compensated [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of major industrial companies in the key sectors, of 38 banks and financial institutions, increased [[Financial regulation|market regulation]], [[Workers' control|worker participation]] in company decisions
* [[Decentralization|Decentralisation]] and "democratisation" of government institutions, guarantee of individual liberties, restriction of police custody
* Fight against [[unemployment]]
* "Politics of peace": abolishing [[Force de dissuasion|nuclear deterrent]], [[military service]] reduction to 6 months, dissolution of both [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]]
* Education reform

Part of the [[Seattle Art Museum]], the SAAM occupies the 1933 [[Art Deco]] building (designed by [[Carl F. Gould]] of the architectural firm [[Bebb and Gould]] and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]) which was originally home to the Seattle Art Museum's main collection. In 1991 the main collection moved to a newly constructed Seattle Art Museum building in [[Downtown, Seattle, Washington|downtown Seattle]]. The building in Volunteer Park remained closed until 1994, when it reopened as the Seattle Asian Art Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | editor1-last=Reynolds |editor1-first=Jonathan M. |date=September 1994 |title=Museum News |journal=Newsletter, East Asian Art and Archaeology |publisher=Center of Japanese Studies, University of Michigan |issue=47 |pages=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission is free on the first Thursday and the first Saturday of every month.

==Building==

The Seattle Asian Art Museum is housed in a historic [[Art Deco]] building designed in 1933 by [[Carl F. Gould]] of the architectural firm [[Bebb and Gould]]. From 1933 to 1991, the building served as the home of the [[Seattle Art Museum]] and its main collection. After the main collection moved to a new museum in [[Downtown Seattle]], the building was renovated at a cost of $5.2 million.

The building was designated a [[List of Seattle landmarks|Seattle landmark]] in 1989 and added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cityofseattle.gov/neighborhoods/preservation/s.htm Landmarks Alphabetical Listing for S] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721033852/https://www.cityofseattle.gov/neighborhoods/preservation/s.htm |date=2011-07-21 }}, Individual Landmarks, Department of Neighborhoods, City of Seattle. Accessed December 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

[[File:Alla upplagor.jpg|thumbnail|The first thirteen editions of ''Svenska Akademiens ordlista'']]
'''''Svenska Akademiens ordlista''''' ({{IPA-sv|²svɛnːska akadɛˈmiːns ²uːɖˌlɪsta|lang}}), abbreviated '''SAOL''', is a [[glossary]] published every few years by the [[Swedish Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nordic dictionaries|url=http://www.norden.org/en/fakta-om-norden-1/nordic-dictionaries|website=www.norden.org|publisher=[[Nordic Council]]|accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lilius|first1=Pirkko|title=The history of Scandinavian language studies in Finland 1828–1918|date=2008|publisher=Societas scientiarum Fennica|isbn=9516533566|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HxULAQAAMAAJ&amp;q}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wolfgang Behschnitt|first1=Wolfgang|last2=De Mul|first2=Sarah|last3=Minnaard|first3=Liesbeth|title=Literature, Language, and Multiculturalism in Scandinavia and the Low Countries|date=2013|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9401209855|page=190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QiaLAgAAQBAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a single volume that is considered the final arbiter of [[Swedish language|Swedish]] spelling. Traditionally it carries the motto of the Swedish Academy, ''Snille och Smak'' ("Talent and Taste"), on its blue cloth cover.

Whenever a new edition comes out lively discussions about new and changed entries erupt around the country. In some instances the Academy has been ahead of its times and has later had to change entries back to older spellings. ''Jos'' – ''juice'' is probably the most well-known instance.  In 2015, the fourteenth edition (containing {{formatnum:126000}} entries) was published.

== History ==
The history of SAOL is the history of [[orthography]] of the [[Swedish language]]. While Swedish spelling was an entirely personal business in the Catholic [[Middle Ages]], its gradual standardization (known as [[Modern Swedish]]) started in 1526 with the translation of the New testament of the [[Bible]] (''[[Gustav Vasa Bible]]''), as part of the [[Lutheran]] reformation. The edition was revised in 1703, known as the Swedish Bible of [[Charles XII of Sweden|Carolus XII]]. The [[Swedish Academy]] was founded in 1786 with the task of caring for Swedish literature and language, including the publication of a grand dictionary. Spelling evolved slowly in the 18th century and was largely based on [[etymology]]: for instance, because of its historic relationship to English ''heart'' and German ''Herz'', ''hjärta'' was spelled ''hjerta'' in Swedish even though it's pronounced {{IPA-sv|²jæʈːa|}}; the word for "woman" (now ''kvinna'') was spelled ''qvinna'', similar to English ''queen''; the question words ''hvad'', ''hvar'', ''hvilken'' had a silent H, like English ''what'', ''where'', ''which'' still have in most accents. In 1801 the Academy published an official orthography ([[Carl Gustaf af Leopold]], ''Afhandling om svenska stafsättet'', 266 pages). A shorter version for schools was published by [[Carl Jonas Love Almqvist]], ''Svensk Rättstafnings-Lära'' in 1829.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Svensk Rättstafnings-Lära|url=http://runeberg.org/rettstaf/|publisher=Project Runeberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the 1750s, voices had been raised to adopt spelling to pronunciation, but this didn't resonate with the conservatively minded Academy. [[Public school (government funded)|Public schools]] were made mandatory in Sweden by law in 1842 and the influence of school teachers increased, as did the pressure to reform Swedish spelling. The most radical reformists wanted to do away with all silent letters and change the remaining ones to a smaller subset of the alphabet. A similar reform movement for [[Danish language|Danish]], which at this time was the written language also in [[Norwegian language|Norway]], was led by [[Rasmus Rask]] (1787–1832) and his follower [[Niels Matthias Petersen]] (1791–1862). In 1869 a pan-Scandinavian orthography congress (''Nordiska rättstavningsmötet'') gathered in [[Stockholm]]. Secretary for the Swedish section was [[Artur Hazelius]], who in 1871 published the proceedings of the conference. The Academy was not pleased, and as a countermeasure [[Johan Erik Rydqvist]] (1800–1877) published the first edition of SAOL in 1874, based on the orthography in Leopold's work of 1801. A second edition followed in the same year and new ones in 1875, 1880 and the 5th edition in 1883, without much change.

To further reform, a Swedish orthographic society (''Svenska rättstavningssällskapet'') was formed on November 28, 1885, chaired by linguist [[Adolf Noreen]] (1854–1925), and published a journal ''Nystavaren. Tidskrift för rättskrivningsfrågor'' (4 volumes, 1886–1898, edited by [[Otto Hoppe]]). There was continued opposition, not least from Academy member [[Esaias Tegnér Jr.]] (1843–1928). However, many of the proposed changes, albeit far from all, were introduced in the 6th edition of SAOL in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/saol/6/ Förord till den digitala utgåvan] Svenska Akademiens Ordlista, Sjätte upplagan, 1889, Runeberg.org&lt;/ref&gt; Many words spelled with E were changed to Ä (''elf'' → ''älf'', ''hjerta'' → ''hjärta'', ''jern'' → ''järn''), and under Q it was stated that Q may at will be replaced with K.&lt;ref&gt;[http://runeberg.org/saol/6/0211.html Q. (De under denna bokstaf upptagna ord kunna äfven skrifvas med K.)] Svenska Akademiens Ordlista, Sjätte upplagan, 1889, Runeberg.org&lt;/ref&gt; By a government resolution on November 16, 1889, the spelling used in this edition of SAOL was to be used for teaching in [[education in Sweden#Secondary school|Swedish high schools]] (''allmänna läroverk'') and teacher colleges (''seminarier''). This was a direct blow against the society's own dictionary published in 1886, and reform movement lost much of its momentum. In the 7th edition of SAOL in 1900, many of the old optional forms with Q were dropped.

In 1898, school teachers started to sign mass petitions for further reform. In 1903, the association of Swedish public school teachers (''Sveriges allmänna folkskollärarförening'') requested a government ruling that it "would no longer be considered wrong" (''ej måtte betraktas som fel'') to write TT instead of DT and V instead of F, FV and HV. More associations joined this petition in 1905. A government proposal to this effect was signed on April 7, 1906, by education minister [[Fridtjuv Berg]] (1851–1916), and put before the parliament of 1907. A protest against the reform signed by 40,000 concerned citizens was handed to the government in 1908, but had no effect. The liberal Fridtjuv Berg was a former school teacher and one of the founding members of the orthographic society.

The reform of 1906 was the most radical in the history of Swedish orthography. Spelling with dt, fv and hv is now commonly known as "old spelling" (''gammalstavning''). The new spelling was adopted in schools starting in 1907. It was used from the first edition of [[Selma Lagerlöf]]'s geography textbook ''Nils Holgerssons underbara resa genom Sverige'' (1906, ''[[The Wonderful Adventures of Nils]]''). The proceedings of the Swedish parliament adopted the new spelling from the year 1913. After endless discussions through the 19th century, a new Swedish Bible translation was finally adopted in 1917, using the new spelling. Sweden's largest printed encyclopedia of all times, the 2nd edition of ''[[Nordisk familjebok]]'' was started in 1904 and used the old spelling through all 38 volumes until 1926. The Academy introduced the new spelling in the 8th edition of SAOL in 1923. The 9th edition appeared in 1950.

In the 10th edition in 1973, the Academy tried to launch new alternative spellings such as ''jos'' ("juice"), without attracting any significant number of followers. The 11th edition of SAOL appeared in 1986 and the 12th edition in 1998. While the letter Q in the 8th edition only listed the letter Q itself, the 11th edition also listed ''quantum satis'', ''quenell'', ''quilt'' and ''quisling''.

From the beginning of times, W had in Swedish been considered as a mere decoration of V. In Swedish typography, [[blackletter]] (''fraktur'') used W where [[Antiqua (typeface class)|antiqua]] used V. With orthographic standardization and spelling reform, W was abandoned except for some proper names and a few loan words such as ''whisky'', ''wobbler'' (also spelled ''visky'' and ''vobbler''), ''whist'' and ''[[Danish pastry|wienerbröd]]''. In Swedish dictionaries and telephone books, V and W have been sorted as one letter. In the 13th edition of SAOL in 2006, the Academy broke with this tradition, listing W as a letter of its own. This change was sparked by a new influx of loan words such as ''webb'' ("[[World Wide Web]]").

{{Italic title}}
'''''{{lang|la|Tabula Peutingeriana}}''''' ([[Latin Language|Latin]] for "The Peutinger Map"), also referred to as '''Peutinger's Tabula'''{{sfn|Ravenstein|1911|p=637}} or '''Peutinger Table''', is an illustrated ''{{lang|la|[[itinerarium]]}}'' (ancient Roman road map) showing the layout of the ''[[cursus publicus]]'', the road network of the [[Roman Empire]].

The map is a 13th-century parchment copy of a possible Roman original. It covers [[Europe]] (without the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and the [[British Isles]]), [[North Africa]], and parts of [[Asia]], including the Middle East, [[Persia]], and [[India]]. According to one hypothesis, the existing map is based on a document of the 4th or 5th century that contained a copy of the world map originally prepared by [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa|Agrippa]] during the reign of the emperor [[Augustus]] (27 BC – AD 14). However, Emily Albu has suggested that the existing map could instead be based on an original from the [[Carolingian]] period.&lt;ref&gt; Emily Albu, The Medieval Peutinger Map: Imperial Roman Revival in a German Empire. Cambridge; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2014 &lt;/ref&gt;

Named after the 16th-century German antiquarian [[Konrad Peutinger]], the map is now conserved at the [[Austrian National Library]] in Vienna.

==Archetype==
The ''Tabula'' is thought to be a distant descendant of the map prepared under the direction of [[Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa]], a Roman general, architect, and friend of emperor [[Augustus]]. After Agrippa's death in 12 BC, that map was engraved in marble and put on display in the ''Porticus Vipsania'' in the ''[[Campus Agrippae]]'' area in Rome, close to the ''[[Ara Pacis]]'' building. 

The early imperial dating for the archetype of the map is supported by American historian [[Glen Bowersock]], and is based on numerous details of [[Roman Arabia]] that look entirely anachronistic for a 4th-century map.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowersock|1994|pp=169–170,175,177,178–179,181,182,184}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bowersock concluded that the original source is likely the map made by Vipsanius Agrippa.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowersock|1994|p=185}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This dating is also consistent with the map's inclusion of the Roman town of [[Pompeii]] near modern-day [[Naples]], which was never rebuilt after it had been destroyed in an eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]] in AD 79.

The original Roman map, of which this may be the only surviving copy, was last revised in the 4th or early 5th century.&lt;ref name=levi&gt;{{harvnb|Levi| Levi|1967|p={{page needed|date=December 2016}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bagrow|2010|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows the city of [[Constantinople]], founded in 328, and the prominence of [[Ravenna]], seat of the [[Western Roman Empire]] from 402 to 476, which suggests a fifth-century revision according to Levi and Levi.&lt;ref name=levi/&gt; The presence of certain cities of [[Germania Inferior]] that were destroyed in the mid-fifth century also provides a ''[[Terminus post quem|terminus ante quem]]'', i.e. the map's latest creation date, though Emily Albu suggests that this information could have been preserved in textual, not cartographic, form.

==Map description==
The ''Tabula Peutingeriana'' is thought to be the only known surviving map of the Roman ''[[cursus publicus]]'', the state-run road network. The surviving map itself was created by a monk in [[Colmar]] in modern-day eastern France in 1265.&lt;ref name="euratlas"&gt;{{harvnb|Nussli}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[scroll (parchment)|parchment scroll]], {{convert|0.34|m|abbr=off}} high and {{convert|6.75|m|abbr=off}} long, assembled from eleven sections, a medieval reproduction of the original scroll.

[[Image:TabulaPeutingeriana Roma.jpg|thumb|250px|Rome.]]
It is a very schematic map, designed to give a practical overview of the road network, as opposed to an accurate representation of geographic features: the land masses shown are distorted, especially in the east-west direction. The map shows many Roman settlements and the roads connecting them, as well as other features such as rivers, mountains, forests and seas. The distances between settlements are also given. In total no fewer than 555 cities and 3,500 other place names are shown on the map.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lendering|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three most important cities of the Roman Empire at the time – [[Rome]], [[Constantinople]] and [[Antioch]] – are represented with special iconic decoration.

Besides the totality of the empire, the map also shows areas in the [[Near East]], India and the Ganges, [[Sri Lanka]] (''Insula Taprobane''), and even an indication of China. It even shows a "Temple to [[Augustus]]" at [[Muziris]] on the modern-day [[Malabar Coast]], one of the main ports for trade with the Roman Empire on the southwest coast of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ball|2000|p=123}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the western end of the scroll, the absence of [[Morocco]], the [[Iberian Peninsula]], and the [[British Isles]] indicates that a twelfth original section has been lost in the surviving copy; the missing section was reconstructed in 1898 by [[Konrad Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Talbert|2010|p=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The map appears to be based on [[itinerarium|"itineraries"]], lists of destinations along Roman roads, as the distances between points along the routes are indicated.&lt;ref&gt;Not all the stages are between towns: sometimes a crossroads marks the staging point.&lt;/ref&gt; Travelers would not have possessed anything so sophisticated as a modern map, but they needed to know what lay ahead of them on the road and how far. The Peutinger Table represents these roads as a series of stepped lines along which destinations have been marked in order of travel. The shape of the parchment pages accounts for the conventional rectangular layout. However, a rough similarity to the coordinates of [[Ptolemy]]'s earth-mapping gives some writers hope that some terrestrial representation was intended by the unknown original compilers.

The stages and cities are represented by hundreds of functional place symbols, used with discrimination from the simplest icon of a building with two towers to the elaborate individualized "portraits" of the three great cities. The editors Annalina and Mario Levi concluded that the semi-schematic, semi-pictorial symbols reproduce Roman cartographic conventions of the ''itineraria picta'' described by 4th-century writer [[Vegetius]],&lt;ref&gt;Vegetius' "''...viarum qualitas, compendia, diverticula, montes, flumina ad fidem descripta'' suggest a more detailed "pictorial itinerary" than either the [[Antonine Itinerary]] or the ''Tabula Peutingeriana'' offers.&lt;/ref&gt; of which this is the sole known testimony.

==History==
The map was discovered in a library in the city of [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] by German scholar [[Conrad Celtes]] in 1494, who was unable to publish his find before his death and bequeathed the map in 1508 to [[Konrad Peutinger]], a German humanist and antiquarian in [[Augsburg]], after whom the map is named.&lt;ref name=euratlas/&gt; The Peutinger family kept possession of the map for more than two hundred years until it was sold in 1714. It then bounced between several royal and elite families until it was purchased by [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]] for 100 [[ducats]]; upon his death in 1737, it was purchased for the [[Habsburg]] Imperial Court Library in Vienna (''{{lang|de|Hofbibliothek}}''). It is today conserved at the [[Austrian National Library]] at the [[Hofburg]] palace in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Accession number: Codex 324.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the map was placed on the UNESCO's [[Memory of the World Programme|Memory of the World Register]], and in recognition of this, it was displayed to the public for a single day on 26 November 2007. Because of its fragile condition, it is not usually on public display.{{sfn|Bell|2007}}

==Printed editions==
The map was copied for Dutch cartographer [[Abraham Ortelius]] and published shortly after his death in 1598. A partial first edition was printed at [[Antwerp]] in 1591 (titled ''Fragmenta tabulæ antiquæ'') by [[Jan Moretus|Johannes Moretus]], who would print the full ''Tabula'' in December 1598, also at Antwerp. [[Johannes Janssonius]] published another version in Amsterdam, c. 1652.

In 1753 Franz Christoph von Scheyb published a copy, and in 1872 Konrad Miller, a German professor, was allowed to copy the map. Several publishing houses in Europe then made copies. In 1892 publishers [[Williams and Norgate]] published a copy in London, and in 1911 a sheet was added showing the reconstructed sections of the British Isles and the Iberian peninsula missing in the original.{{sfn|Ravenstein|1911|p=637}}

'''The Charlotte Meeting House''' was built in 1840 by the [[Methodist]] Congregation of [[Charlotte, Vermont]]. In 1952 it was moved to the [[Shelburne Museum]] in [[Shelburne, Vermont]]. It now serves as an exhibit building on the museum grounds.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History== 
The building was originally erected by the Charlotte Methodist Church in 1840, after their original wooden structure was destroyed in a fire in 1837.

By 1899 it had ceased to function as a church and was taken over by a group of thirteen young women who had formed an amateur theatrical group and used the building as a playhouse.&lt;ref&gt;''The Charlotte News'', December 2, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902, the group incorporated as the Breezy Point Library Association and bought the building to serve as the town library.   Charles W. Henry, Vermont's foremost painted theater curtain artist, often painted backdrops for the association's productions.

After a windstorm damaged the building in 1950, the association voted to sell it to the [[Shelburne Museum]] so that it could be preserved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=16 ]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the [[Shelburne Museum]] dismantled the building and moved it to the grounds finding replacements for missing or damaged elements, including the belfry, pews, and pulpit, in an abandoned church in [[Milton, Vermont]].&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; The interior plaster walls were painted in tones of white and grey to resemble paneled woodwork(''see [[Trompe-l'œil]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=16 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
The structure reflects the stylistic tendencies established in the last decade of 18th century when the church plan became the standard on which [[meeting house]]s were designed. The church plan refers to a rectangular structure with a pitched roof and incorporated bell tower with its entrance located along the structure’s short axis and the pulpit positioned opposite. Since the church plan and the word church connoted [[Anglicanism]], [[Puritan]] communities used the term meeting house to refer to the building they used for both secular and religious meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Puritans, and later [[Congregationalists]], traditionally constructed their meeting houses on a square or rectangular plan with hipped roofs, a separate bell tower, and the entrance and pulpit situated on the long sides of the building. By the late eighteenth century, as communities began to distinguish between meeting houses and churches, Protestant communities adopted both the title “church” and the associated plan in designing their religious buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Shelburne Museum. 1993. Shelburne Museum: A Guide to the Collections. Shelburne: Shelburne Museum, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Meeting House’s triangular [[pediment]], accented with [[cornice]] moldings, reflects the pervasiveness of [[Greek Revival]] Architecture in the mid-nineteenth century. The lack of other adornment, typical of the Greek Revival style, lent itself well to New England Protestant architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shelburnemuseum.org/buildings_and_grounds/detail.php?id=16 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Good Hotel Guide''''' is an annual book publication, founded in 1977, listing and describing what they profess to be the finest hotels in [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]]. It also publishes a Continental Europe edition and a combined Great Britain and Western Europe guide book.&lt;ref name="RaphaelRaphael2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raphael|first1=Caroline|last2=Raphael|first2=Adam|title=The Good Hotel Guide 2005: Continental Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMbYAAAACAAJ|accessdate=28 March 2011|date=15 March 2005|publisher=Steerforth Press|isbn=978-1-58642-084-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RubinsteinArdagh1985"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rubinstein|first1=Hilary|last2=Ardagh|first2=John|author3=Consumers' Association|title=The Good Hotel Guide: Britain and Western Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjLxGwAACAAJ|accessdate=28 March 2011|date=1 November 1985|publisher=Which? Books|isbn=978-0-340-38158-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has its headquarters in 50 Addison Avenue, [[London]]. The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' in 2006 said of ''The Good Hotel Guide'': ‘The clear leader in recommending hotels of quality and character while not accepting payment for inclusion or free hospitality.’&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodhotelguide.com/AboutUs.aspx|title=About Us|publisher=The Good Hotel Guide|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotels which are included within the book are recommended by readers, and are often supported by an anonymous professional inspection to affirm that the hotel meets the high standard that is claimed.&lt;ref name="About"/&gt;

The books are usually divided into England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland and list the hotels which are included by place name alphabetical order rather than hotel order.&lt;ref name="GHG"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Raphael, Caroline and Balmer, Desmond|title=The Good Hotel Guide 2002|publisher=Ebury Press London|date=2001|page=XVI -XVII}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book shows a strong bias to small country house hotels and old buildings which have a higher degree of eccentricity or originality and character rather than city skyscraper type hotels.&lt;ref name="GHG"/&gt;
The book also annually offers considerable voucher incentives to readers;&lt;ref name="RaphaelRaphael2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Raphael|first1=Adam|last2=Raphael|first2=Caroline|title=Europe's Wonderful Little Hotels and Inns: Continental Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8k8TzvioBwC|accessdate=28 March 2011|date=January 2002|publisher=Steerforth Press|isbn=978-1-58642-035-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2011 edition contained £150 worth of discount vouchers for hotels included in the book. The most prolific editor of the book is Hilary Rubenstein who edited the books in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name="Books in Scotland"&gt;{{cite book|title=Books in Scotland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6q8tAAAAYAAJ|accessdate=28 March 2011|year=1991|publisher=Ramsay Head Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caroline Raphael has been the most prolific editor since the late 1990s, often with her husband, award-winning journalist [[Adam Raphael]], although very recent editions (2010 and 2011) are edited by Adam not Caroline, with D. Balmer.

==César Awards==
''The Good Hotel Guide'' awards what it believes to be the top ten very best hotels in the country with a César Award which are described as "Oscars for the hotel industry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/travel/where_to_stay/article4874203.ece|title=Britain's top 10 hotels for 2009|publisher=[[Sunday Times]]|date=5 October 2008|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swintonpark.com/press_releases/20101018.php|title=Swinton Park wins Good Hotel Guide 2011 César Award|publisher=Swintonpark.com|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisissouthwales.co.uk/news/Hotel-given-gong/article-2773178-detail/article.html|title=Hotel given gong|publisher=This is South Wales|accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first awards were given in 1986. Hotels which are recipients of this award often display this award or mention it on their websites as a sign of top quality and approval. As of 2002 the awards given are as follows:&lt;ref name="GHG"/&gt;

The '''''Macmillan Field Guides to Bird [[Animal identification|Identification]]''''' are two small bird [[field guide]]s. Volume 1, ''The Macmillan Field Guide to Bird Identification'', illustrated by [[Alan Harris (illustrator)|Alan Harris]] and [[Laurel Tucker]], with text by [[Keith Vinicombe]], was originally published in 1989, covered British birds.  Volume 2, ''The Macmillan Birder's Guide to European and Middle Eastern Birds'', illustrated by Alan Harris, with text by [[Hadoram Shirihai]] and [[David Christie (ornithologist)|David Christie]], covered birds of continental Europe and the Middle East, and was published in 1996.

The guides adopt an unusual format, in that not all species in the geographical area of coverage are included; instead only groups of species which the authors regarded as difficult to identify are covered. Each such group is given a chapter, where identification is covered discurively rather than in the abbreviated form more usually used in a field guide. The publication of the first volume (covering Britain and Ireland) was the first time that this approach had been used in a European guide

The first volume is widely credited as having a major influence on improving the identification skills of birders in Britain during the 1990s.

A [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) '''zone file''' is a [[text file]] that describes a [[DNS zone]]. A DNS zone is a subset, often a single domain, of the hierarchical domain name structure of the DNS. The zone file contains mappings between [[domain name|domain names]] and [[IP address]]es and other resources, organized in the form of text representations of [[resource record]]s (RR). A zone file may be either a DNS master file, authoritatively describing a zone, or it may be used to list the contents of a DNS cache.&lt;ref name=rfc1035&gt;RFC 1035, ''Domain Names - Implementation and Specification'', P. Mockapetris, (November 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

==File format==
The format of a zone file is defined in RFC 1035 (section 5) and RFC 1034 (section 3.6.1). This format was originally used by the [[BIND|Berkeley Internet Name Domain]] (BIND) software package, but has been widely adopted by other DNS server software – though some of them (e.g. [[NSD]], [[PowerDNS]]) are using the zone files only as a starting point to compile them into database format, see also [[Microsoft DNS]] with [[Active Directory]]-database integration.

A zone file is a sequence of entries for ''resource records''. Each line is a text description that defines a single resource record (''RR''). The description consists of several fields separated by white space (spaces or tabs) as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| name || ttl || record class || record type || record data
|}

The ''name'' field may be left blank. If so, the record inherits the field from the previous record.

The field ''[[Time to live#DNS records|ttl (time-to-live)]]'' specifies the time after which a domain name client must discard the record and perform a new resolution operation to obtain fresh information. If ttl is not specified, the global TTL specified at the top of the zone file is used.

The field ''record class'' indicates the namespace of the record information. The most commonly used namespace is that of the Internet, indicated by parameter ''IN'', but others exist and are in use, e.g., ''[[Chaosnet|CHAOS]]''.

The field ''record type'' is an abbreviation for the type of information stored in the last field, ''record data''. For example: an ''address record'' (type ''A'' for IPv4, or type ''AAAA'' for IPv6,) maps the domain name from the first field to an [[IP address]] in the record data; a ''mail exchanger'' record (type ''MX'') specifies the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP) mail host for a domain.

The field ''record data'' may consist of one or more information elements, depending on the requirements of each record type. For example, an address record only requires an address, while a mail exchanger record requires a priority and a domain name. Such information elements are separated by white space.

Resource records may occur in any order in a zone file, with some exceptions. For formatting convenience, resource records may span several lines by enclosing in parentheses a set of parameters that spans several lines, but belongs to the same record. The file may contain comment text by preceding such text with a semicolon, either at the beginning of a line, or after the last field on any line, or on a blank line. Comments end at the end of a line. The zone file may contain any number of blank lines with or without comments.

The zone file may also contain various directives that are marked with a keyword starting with the dollar sign character. The most notable is the ''$ORIGIN'' keyword, which specifies the starting point for the zone in the DNS hierarchy. If this keyword is omitted from a zone file, the origin is inferred by the server software from the reference to the zone file in its server configuration.

An example of a zone file for the domain ''example.com'' is the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ORIGIN example.com.     ; designates the start of this zone file in the namespace
$TTL 1h                  ; default expiration time of all resource records without their own TTL value
example.com.  IN  SOA   ns.example.com. username.example.com. ( 2007120710 1d 2h 4w 1h )
example.com.  IN  NS    ns                    ; ns.example.com is a nameserver for example.com
example.com.  IN  NS    ns.somewhere.example. ; ns.somewhere.example is a backup nameserver for example.com
example.com.  IN  MX    10 mail.example.com.  ; mail.example.com is the mailserver for example.com
@             IN  MX    20 mail2.example.com. ; equivalent to above line, "@" represents zone origin
@             IN  MX    50 mail3              ; equivalent to above line, but using a relative host name
example.com.  IN  A     192.0.2.1             ; IPv4 address for example.com
              IN  AAAA  2001:db8:10::1        ; IPv6 address for example.com
ns            IN  A     192.0.2.2             ; IPv4 address for ns.example.com
              IN  AAAA  2001:db8:10::2        ; IPv6 address for ns.example.com
www           IN  CNAME example.com.          ; www.example.com is an alias for example.com
wwwtest       IN  CNAME www                   ; wwwtest.example.com is another alias for www.example.com
mail          IN  A     192.0.2.3             ; IPv4 address for mail.example.com
mail2         IN  A     192.0.2.4             ; IPv4 address for mail2.example.com
mail3         IN  A     192.0.2.5             ; IPv4 address for mail3.example.com
&lt;/pre&gt;

As a minimum, the zone file must specify the ''Start of Authority'' (SOA) record with the name of the authoritative master name server for the zone and the email address of someone responsible for management of the name server. The parameters of the SOA record also specify a list of timing and expiration parameters (serial number, slave refresh period, slave retry time, slave expiration time, and the maximum time to cache the record).
Some DNS server software, such as BIND, also requires at least one additional name server record. The email address in the SOA RR has the @ symbol replaced by a period. In the zone file, host names that do not end in a period are relative to the origin. For example, in the example above, ''www'' refers to ''www.example.com'', and ''example.com.'' is ''example.com'', and not ''example.com.example.com''. Names ending with a full stop (or point) are said to be [[fully qualified domain name]]s.

A zone file is referenced by the configuration file of the name server software such as [[BIND|bind]], typically by a statement such as:
&lt;pre&gt;
zone "example.com" { type master; file "/var/named/db.example.com"; };
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Root zone and top-level domains==
The zone files for the [[DNS root zone]] and for the set of [[top-level domain]]s contain resource records only for the authoritative domain name servers for each domain name.

==Localhost==
Some server software automatically configures resource records for specially recognized domains or hostnames, such as [[localhost]], but a customized zone master file may be used.

An example for manual configuration of the forward zone for ''localhost'' is the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
$ORIGIN localhost.
@  1D  IN  SOA   @  root 1999010100 3h 15m 1w 1d
@  1D  IN  NS    @
@  1D  IN  A     127.0.0.1
@  1D  IN  AAAA  ::1
&lt;/pre&gt;

The corresponding reverse zone definition is:
&lt;pre&gt;
;; reverse zone file for 127.0.0.1 and ::1
$TTL 3W
@  3W  IN  SOA     localhost. root.localhost.  1999010100 3h 15m 1w 1d
@  3W  IN  NS      localhost.
1  3W  IN  PTR     localhost.
&lt;/pre&gt;
This file does not specify the origin so that it may be used for both IPv4 and IPv6 with this configuration:
&lt;pre&gt;
zone "0.0.127.in-addr.arpa"  IN { type master; file "r.local"; };
&lt;/pre&gt;

Similar zone master files may be created for the reverse resolution of the broadcast address and the null address. Such zone files prevent a DNS server from referring to other, possibly external DNS servers.
