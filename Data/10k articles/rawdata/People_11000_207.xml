'''Abdi''' is a male name. It is a given name with many origins in many countries including [[Arabic]]. Among others, one version has Arabic as origin. The name is a Muslim name, given to Muslims.

==Arabic origin Abdi==
While Arabic speakers commonly use ''[[Abdu]]'' ({{lang|ar|عبده}}&amp;lrm; / {{lang|ar|عبدو}} ''{{transl|ar|ʿabdu}}'') rather than ''Abdi'', both are nicknames for ''[[Abdul]]''. It originates from the Arabic word {{lang|ar|عبد ال}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿabd al-}} / {{transl|ar|ʿabd el-}} / {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿabd ul-}}''. The name translates as "servant"&lt;ref name="Long"&gt;{{cite book|last="Long"|first=Harry Alfred|title=Personal and family names: a popular monograph on the origin and history of the nomenclature of the present and former times|year=1883|publisher=Hamilton, Adams &amp; co.|pages=260|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lWwUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA260#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "servant" in reference to religious submission to [[Allah]] (God). As such, it is often used by [[Muslim]]s around the world in conjunction with one of the [[names of God in Islam]], but also sometimes on its own.&lt;ref name="Long"/&gt;

==Biblical Abdi==
''Abdi is also the name of three men in the [[Hebrew Bible]]''
*In {{bibleverse|1|Chronicles|6:44}} ''Abdi'' is a [[Levite]] of the family of [[Merari]].
*In {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|29:12|HE}} ''Abdi'' is a Levite in the time of King [[Hezekiah]] of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]. This may be the same man as in 1 Chronicles 6:44.
*In [[Book of Ezra|Ezra]] {{bibleverse-nb||Ezra|10:26|HE}} ''Abdi'' is the son of [[Elam]], and one of a long list of men who had married foreign wives, and who then sent them away together with their children.

'''Adele Laurie Blue Adkins''' {{postnominals|country=GBR|MBE}} ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|d|ɛ|l}}; born 5 May 1988) is an English singer and songwriter.&lt;!--Do not list "multi-instrumentalist" per talk discussion--&gt; After graduating from the [[BRIT School]] for Performing Arts and Technology in 2006, Adele was given a recording contract by [[XL Recordings]] after a friend posted her demo on [[Myspace]] the same year. In 2007, she received the [[Brit Awards]] "Critics' Choice" award and won the [[BBC]] [[Sound of 2008]] poll. Her debut album, ''[[19 (Adele album)|19]]'', was released in 2008 to commercial and critical success. It is certified seven times [[Music recording sales certification#Certification thresholds|platinum]] in the UK, and three times platinum in the US. The album contains her first song, "[[Hometown Glory]]", written when she was 16, which is based on her home suburb of [[West Norwood]] in London.

However [[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]] state she is often mistaken for a [[contralto]] due to the application of a tense chest mix to achieve her lower notes, whilst also noting that her voice becomes its clearest as she ascends the register, particularly from [[C (musical note)|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] to [[C (musical note)|C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/adele-profile-after-two-heartbreak-albums-can-singers-stellar-ascent-survive-the-joy-of-family-life-a6724946.html| title = Adele profile: After two heartbreak albums, can singer's stellar ascent survive the joy of family life?| work=[[The Independent]]| date=6 November 2015| accessdate=15 March 2018| first=Ian| last=Burrell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/oct/30/adele-25-uk-album-charts| title = Adele: the 'regular girl' who became a singing superstar| work=[[The Guardian]]| date=30 October 2015| accessdate=15 March 2018| first=Caroline| last=Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.classicfm.com/lifestyle/culture/adele-voice-mezzo/| title = Is Adele actually a good singer?| work=[[Classic FM (UK)|Classic FM]]| date=| accessdate=30 March 2018| first=| last=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/20/top-artists-vocal-range_n_5357698.html|title = Comparing The Top Artists, Past And Present, By Vocal Range| work=[[Huffington Post]]| date=20 May 2014| accessdate=27 May 2014|first=Ryan|last=Kristobak}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rolling Stone'' reported that following throat surgery her voice had become "palpably bigger and purer-toned", and that she had added a further four notes to the top of her range.&lt;ref name="RTm" /&gt; Initially, critics suggested that her vocals were more developed and intriguing than her songwriting, a sentiment with which Adele agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/2009-01-22/music/despite-four-grammy-nominations-adele-is-figuring-out-how-to-be-herself/|title=Despite four Grammy nominations, Adele is figuring out how to be herself Westworld 21 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has stated: "I taught myself how to sing by listening to [[Ella Fitzgerald]] for acrobatics and scales, [[Etta James]] for passion and [[Roberta Flack]] for control."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myplay.com/artists/adele/bio|title=Adele Bio|publisher=Myplay.com|accessdate=22 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013224009/http://www.myplay.com/artists/adele/bio|archivedate=13 October 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haji Mohammad Alam Channa''' (1953 in [[Sehwan]], [[Sindh]] province, [[Pakistan]] – 2 July 1998 in [[New York City]]) was one of the tallest living people with the height of {{Convert|7.8|ft}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tallest Man (frm 1982 to 1992 |url=https://arynews.tv/en/remembering-worlds-tallest-man-alam-channa-19th-death-anniversary/ |website=Arynews.tv |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness Book of World Records]], the tallest living man in the world (between 1982 and 1998), was Pakistan’s Mohammad Alam Channa. Before his death in 1998, Channa was reported to be {{Convert|7.7|ft}} tall.&lt;ref name="Life and Height Before Death"&gt;{{cite web |title=Before His Death, His height was 7.7 feet. |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1215250 |website=www.dawn.com |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in 1953 in the city of [[Sehwan]] (in Pakistan’s Sindh province), Alam Channa is said to have stood 6&amp;nbsp;ft 4 inches by the time he was 18. He continued to grow taller till he was 26.

Channa came from an impoverished Sindhi family. He did not receive any noteworthy education. The male members of his family had traditionally served as minor retainers at the famous shrine of Sufi saint, [[Lal Shahbaz Qalandar]], in [[Shewan]]. Here is where Channa too spent most of his years, tasked to keep certain areas of the shrine clean. According to Channa’s paternal side of the family, Channa was making just Rs. 15 a week at the shrine! So when the circus offered him Rs. 160 a month, he decided to immediately accept the offer.

The circus turned Channa into a local star. He would travel with it across the length and breadth of [[Sindh]]. All he had to do was to make an entry just when two short men dressed as jokers were going through their routine. He would walk in and proceed to lift up the jokers (who would pretend to run away from the giant). Channa would grab them and then put them on his shoulders.

In 1981 a man who had watched Channa at the circus wrote a letter to the editors of the famous Guinness Book of World Records. With the letter he also sent some photos of Channa he had taken at the circus.

Months later some officials from Guinness landed in Sindh’s capital city, Karachi, and from there they reached Sehwan where they met and measured Channa. They measured him at being 7&amp;nbsp;ft 7 inches. On their return to the UK, the men entered Channa’s name in the Guinness book as the tallest living human on earth.&lt;ref name="Life and Height Before Death"/&gt;

In 1998 his kidneys began to fail. The government decided to send him to the US and finance his treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetallestman.com/mohammadalamchanna.htm |title=Haji Mohammad Alam Channa - The Tallest Man in Pakistan| publisher=The Tallest Man}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in a US hospital, he slipped into a coma and died, aged 45. He is buried in Sehwan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/125593.stm |title=World's tallest man dies  |accessdate=22 August 2006 |date=3 July 1998| publisher=BBC online network }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

"Channa belonged to an indigent Sindhi family. He could not get education. All his family male members had traditionally served as minor retainers at the [[Shrine of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar|famous shrine]] of Sufi saint, [[Lal Shahbaz Qalandar]], in Sehwan. In this town Channa spent his early years and assigned to keep areas of the shrine clean. He got married in 1989 and had a son in 1990."&lt;ref name="Life and Height Before Death"/&gt;

He was born in [[Sydney, Australia|Sydney]] and grew up on a farm in the [[Bega, New South Wales|Bega Valley]]. Pfeiffer studied [[horticulture]] and [[landscape design]] at the [[Arboretum Kalmthout]] in [[Belgium]] and at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], in [[London]], later working as a student gardener at both the [[Bowhill House]] and [[Boughton House]] estates of the [[Duke of Buccleuch]] in [[Scotland]] and [[England]].&lt;ref name="web"&gt;[http://www.andrewpfeiffer.net/briefhistory/history.htm Biography]. ''Andrew Pfeiffer website''. Retrieved on September 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pfeiffer's first gardens were made in England, [[Austria]], and [[Germany]], followed by a number of commissions in Australia. He is based in Sydney and London, and has since worked around the world.

Two Pfeiffer-designed gardens (a [[desert]] garden in Sydney and a [[woodland]] garden of [[A. Alfred Taubman]] in [[Michigan]]) were featured in the 2008 book ''Luxury Private Gardens''. Pfeiffer wrote: "When gardens like the one at [[Château de Courances]] in the [[Île-de-France]] near [[Paris]] or the Odette Monteiro estate at Correias near [[Rio de Janeiro]] are stripped down to their bare essentials, they are like a well-cut couturier’s gown—nothing but an utterly simple response to the unadorned landscape or the naked human body they are designed to fit."&lt;ref name="Lux"&gt;''[http://www.teneues.com/shop-us/books/nature-and-ecology/luxury-private-gardens.html Luxury Private Gardens]''. teNeues. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Pfeiffer believes that "great gardens have a timeless quality" and "should be thought of with a long view, and not in terms of superficial and fleeting fashion."&lt;ref name="web"/&gt; "The natural surroundings, combined with a sense of place, should always determine the character of a garden."&lt;ref name="SensePlace"&gt;{{Cite book | author=Pfeiffer, Andrew| title= A Sense of Place: The Gardens of Andrew Pfeiffer | year= 2000| publisher= Viking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wawira Njiru''', is a [[human nutrition|human nutritionist]], [[businesswoman]], [[entrepreneur]] and [[philanthropist]], in [[Kenya]] who serves as the [[executive director]] of '''Food 4 Education''', an organization that cooks, prepares and distributes nutritious meals, at subsidized prices to over 2,000 poor school children in [[Ruiru]], a suburb of [[Nairobi]], the capital city of Kenya.&lt;ref name="1R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=28 September 2018 |date=September 2018 |newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] |publisher=[[Nation Media Group]] |location=Nairobi | url=https://cdn.nation.co.ke/pdfs/Top40under40Women2018.pdf | title=Top 40 Under 40 Kenyan Women 2018  |author=Business Daily Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
She was born circa 1991, in the town of Ruiru, in [[Kiambu County]], immediately northwest of the capital city of Nairobi.&lt;ref name="2R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=28 September 2018 | url=http://www.transformnutrition.org/what-we-do/nutrition-champions/ann-wawira-njiru-kenya/ |title=2013 Nutrition Champions: Ann Wawira Njiru: Kenya |date=2014 |location=United Kingdom |
publisher=Transformnutrition.org |author=Transformnutrition.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended local schools for her primary and secondary education. In 2010, she was admitted to the [[University of South Australia]], in [[Adelaide]], where she graduated with a [[Human nutrition|Bachelor of Nutrition Science]] degree.&lt;ref name="1R"/&gt;&lt;ref name="2R"/&gt;

==Career==
In 2011, at the age of twenty, Wawiru then an undergraduate in Adelaide, Australia invited 80 friends to a Kenyan themed meal. She charged $20 per plate, raising the equivalent of KSh126,000 at that time.&lt;ref name="3R"&gt;{{cite web|access-date=28 September 2018 |url=http://www.voicesofyouth.org/en/posts/inspire--with-wawira-njiru---food-4-education |title=Inspire! With Wawira Njiru: Food 4 Education |date=7 December 2015 |publisher=Voicesofyouth.org | last=Marketer |first=Carrie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With those funds, Food 4 Education (F4E) was founded. Starting with the construction of a make-shift kitchen, F4E started feeding their 25 first students. That was followed by fundraising campaigns on the internet. Over time, the number of children receiving subsidized school lunches increased.&lt;ref name="3R"/&gt; 

According to Wawira Njiru, it costs Ksh25 (approx. US$0.25) to provide a meal to an elementary school child in Kenya. The parents or guardians are asked to contribute KSh10 (approx. US$0.10). F4E provides the balance.&lt;ref name="4R"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nation.co.ke/lifestyle/women/Wawira-Njiru/1950830-3978312-14w2ktb/index.html |title=Take 5: Founder of Food 4 Education, Wawira Njiru |access-date=28 September 2018 |date=20 June 2017 |newspaper=[[Daily Nation]] |first=Abigail |
last=Arunga |location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To bridge the financial gap, F4E hired a full-time [[chef]], constructed a new modern kitchen and began to deliver cooked-to-order-meals to corporate clients in the nearby Nairobi neighborhoods of [[Kilimani]], [[Kileleshwa]], [[Westlands]], [[Upper Hill, Nairobi|Upper Hill]] and the [[central business district]] of the city.&lt;ref name="4R"/&gt;

==Other considerations==
In 2018, [[Business Daily Africa]], a Kenyan daily [[English language|English]] newspaper named Wawira Njiru, one of the 40 Under 40 Kenyan Women for the year 2018.&lt;ref name="1R"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9742">'''Aristander''' of [[Telmessos]] ({{lang-el|Αρίστανδρος ο Τελμησσεύς}}; born ca. 380 BCE, fl. 2nd half of 4th century BCE), a [[Greeks|Greek]] from [[Caria]], was [[Alexander the Great]]'s favorite [[Clairvoyance|seer]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Aristander|volume=2|page=494}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aristander was already in Philip's entourage in 357/6, when he correctly interpreted a dream as revealing Olympias' pregnancy. The ancient sources place him interpreting [[omen]]s from the conqueror's birth to his death. Although details are variously given, and some incidents are fictitious, Aristander was clearly an influential presence during Alexander's campaigns, and played an important role in uplifting the morale of the [[Macedon]]ian army. There are indications he wrote divinatory works, either before, during or after the expedition, although it is also possible these works were spuriously attributed.&lt;ref&gt;Heckel, pp. 45-46. "Aristander (Aristandros). Greek from Telmessus (Telmissus), Aristander accompanied Alexander as a seer of great renown. Born perhaps ca. 380 (thus Berve ii.62), Aristander was already in Philip's entourage in 357/6, when he correctly interpreted a dream revealing Olympias' pregnancy. During Alexander's campaigns he interpreted various omens for the King: the sweating of the statue of Orpheus; the toppling of the statue of Ariobarzanes; the actions of birds of Halicarnassus (A 1.25.6-8 relating to the plot of Alexander the Lyncestian) and at Gaza and at the founding of Alexandria in Egypt; bleeding bread or dreams about Heracles at Tyre; and oil at the Oxus. Aristander's services were also sought before and at Gaugamela, the Persian Gates, at the [[Iaxartes]]. It is also said that Aristander and Cleomenes were instructed by Alexander to sacrifice on behalf of Cleitus' safety. Two other references to Aristander are almost certainly unhistorical: thirty days after Alexander's death Aristander was supposed to have predicted that the land that became home to his body would enjoy great prosperity, thus causing Ptolemy to bring it to Egypt; Aristander was also supposed to have predicted Lysimachus' kingship. Fränkel and Robinson 1929 believed that Aristander was a feature of Callisthenes' history and they attribute his disappearance after 328/7 to the historian's demise. It is more likely, however, that Aristander simply died of illness or old age during the campaign."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristander in the sources==
(A represents [[Arrian]], P [[Plutarch]], C [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], D [[Diodorus Siculus|Diodorus]], J [[Junianus Justinus|Justin]], S [[Strabo]], Iter. the ''Itinerarium Alexandri''. Passages in which Aristander is mentioned by name are marked with an asterisk.)

# [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip]] dreams he sealed up the womb of his wife [[Olympias]], and that the seal bore a lion device. Aristander interprets the dream optimistically - that the child [[Olympias]] bore ([[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]) would be lion-like and brave. (*P 2.2–3; [[Ephorus]] ''FGrH'' 70 217)
# Statue of [[Orpheus]] in Pieria sweats. Aristander interprets optimistically that it means Alexander will cause poets and musicians much sweat in reciting and celebrating his deeds. (*A 1.11.1–2; *P 14.5; Iter. 17; [[Alexander Romance|Ps-Calisthenes]] 1.42)
# Army comes across a fallen statue of Ariobarzanes, former satrap of [[Phrygia]]. The seer “Alexander” [Aristander?] interprets predicts the victory at [[Granicus]]. (D 17.17.6–7)
# An insistent swallow bothers the drowsing Alexander at [[Halicarnassus]]. Aristander interprets the event to mean that a plot will be revealed to Alexander. (*A 1.25.6–8)
# Macedonian soldiers engaged in the siege of [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] discover that some of the ration bread is “bloody.” Aristander forecasts that Tyre will be taken (because the bread is bloody on the inside). (*C 4.2.14; 17.41.7)
# Alexander dreams that Heracles invited him into Tyre. Aristander interprets this to mean that the city will be captured, but with Herculean effort. (*A 2.18.1, C 4.2.17)
# Alexander, besieging Tyre, dreams about a mocking [[satyr]]. In [[Artemidorus]] Aristander and in P “seers” play with words (“sa tyros”="tyre is thine") to decide that Alexander will take the city. In Ps-Calisthenes the Satyr also gives him a cheese (“tyros”) to trample. (Artemidorus, ''Interpretation of Dreams'' 4.23–24; P 24.3–5; [[Alexander Romance|Ps-Calisthenes]] 1.35; Artemidorus incident unnoticed by Jacoby)
# Aristander, examining entrails, declares that Tyre will be taken that month, even though it is the last day. Alexander decrees a two-day change in the calendar, but then takes the city the same day. (*P 25.1–2)
# During the siege of Gaza, a bird drops something on Alexander and is caught. Aristander predicts personal danger for Alexander that day, and is proven right. 	(*A 2.26.4–27.2; *C 4.6.10–13; *P 25.3–4; Iter. 46–7)
# Foundation of [[Alexandria]]. Alexander outlines city with barley meal. In P, S, Itiner. and Frag. Sab. birds descend upon it. Aristander projects a prosperous future.	(*A 3.1.5–3.2.2; C 4.8.6; P 26.5–6; S 17.1.6; Itiner. 49; FGrH 151=Frag. Sab. 11; others)
# Eclipse occurs 12 days before [[Gaugamela]]. Aristander (in A) or “Egyptian soothsayers” (in C) interpret the omen favorably. (*A 3.7.6; C 4.10.2–7; see P 31.4)
# Alexander conducts sacrifices with Aristander the night before Gaugamela. (*C 4.13.14–16; *P 31.4; ''FGrH'' 148=''Pap. Oxyrch.'' 1798)
# Aristander seen among Alexander’s soldiers at Gaugamela. Points out an eagle directly above Alexander’s head. (*C 4.15.26–27; *P 33.1–2)
# Aristander sacrifices before crossing the Tanais. He reports the omens are unfavorable. He is subsequently asked to sacrifice again and (in A) proclaims another unfavorable omen or (in C) changes his mind. C relates at length how Alexander rebukes Aristander for failing to report the first forecast directly to the king. (*A 4.4.3; 4.4.9, *C 7.7.8–9; 7.722–29, Itiner. 85)
# Cleitus interrupts a sacrifice to sample some fruit, but the sheep follow him. Alexander orders Aristander and “Cleomantis the Spartan” to interpret the event. Both interpret the event pessimistically. (*P 50.2–4)
# Alexander, having killed Cleitus, is consoled by Aristander, who “reminds” him of his prophecy (number 14). Alexander is cheered. (*P 52.1; see A 4.9.5)
# Petroleum is discovered. Aristander predicts that the oil portends success after toil. (*A 4.15.7–8, C 7.10.4; P 57.3; S 9.7.3; Athen. 42 f; Itiner. 97)
# [[Lysimachus]] blunders into the back of Alexander’s spear. Alexander staunches the wound with his diadem. The bloody diadem impels Aristander to predict a troubled reign for Lysimachus. J has the event take place in [[India]]. (*[[Appian]], ''Syriaca'' 64; J 15.3.11–14)
# Aristander scolds Macedonians for not dealing with Alexander’s body, and predicts a bright future for the city that holds it.	(*[[Claudius Aelianus|Aelian]] ''Varia Historia'' 12.64)

==Aristander's writings==
Writings by Aristander are attested by: [[Pliny the Elder]] (''Natural History'' 17); [[Artemidorus]] (''Interpretation of Dreams'' 1.31, 4.23-24); [[Origen]] (''[[Contra Celsum]]'' 6.8.10); see Lucian (citation missing). It is possible that Aristander's writings were, instead, a product of an Aristandrian "school." Aristander's home town, [[Telmessus]] in [[Caria]] (modern Fethiye), was a proverbial font of seers. There may be some connection between the two items of "Successor Propaganda" (18–19, favoring Lysimachus and Ptolemy) and the rule of [[Ptolemy I Epigone]] as dynast in Telmessos. Ptolemy as the son of [[Lysimachus]] inherited his father's claims, but eventually made peace with [[Ptolemy III Euergetes]] and the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]].

'''Azhaliism''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 阿吒力教 ''Āzhālìjiào'') is a [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] religion practiced among the [[Bai people]] of [[Yunnan]], [[China]].{{sfnb|Huang|Zhang|2013}}{{sfnb|Wu|2011|441}} The name comes from lay tantric priests called ''azhali'' (Sanskrit: ''[[acharyas]]'') who are key figures in the religion, known for their use of spells and mantras.&lt;ref&gt;Orzech, Charles D. (general editor) (2011). Esoteric Buddhism and the Tantras in East Asia. Brill, page 381.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The tradition was founded by an Indian [[acharya]] named Candragupta who traveled to the kingdom of [[Nanzhao]] (653–902) from Tibet in 839.&lt;ref&gt;Hearn, Maxwell K. and Smith, Judith G. Arts of the Sung and Yuan: Papers prepared for an international symposium organized by the Metropolitan Museum of Art in conjunction with the exhibition Splendors of Imperial China: Treasures from the National Palace Museum, Teipei, page 239.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a hybrid tradition showing Chinese, Tibetan and Burmese influences.&lt;ref&gt;Orzech, Charles D. (general editor) (2011). Esoteric Buddhism and the Tantras in East Asia. Brill, page 379.&lt;/ref&gt; 

This tradition was also the major religion of the [[Dali Kingdom]] (937–1253). Key deities in this tradition include [[Mahakala]] (known locally as 'Black Sky god') and Acuoye [[Guanyin]]. The Shibaoshan (Stone Treasure Mountain) grottoes, about 10km north of [[Shaxi, Yunnan]], are examples of the art of this Vajrayana tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Esoteric Buddhism in the Dali region, http://www.shaxichina.com/pray/buddhism-in-shaxi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

The tradition faced several challenges during Yuan and Qing rule (such as being banned in 1507 and competition from Han Buddhist schools like Chan) but it continues as a living religion today.&lt;ref&gt;Esoteric Buddhism in the Dali region, http://www.shaxichina.com/pray/buddhism-in-shaxi.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ostrovsky speaking at soldier's monument.jpg|250px|thumb|1954: Mayor B. Ostrovsky is speaking to the people of Raanana in Independence Day at the soldier's monument.]]

'''Baruch Ostrovsky''' (1890–1960; {{lang-he-n|ברוך אוסטרובסקי}}), the first mayor of [[Ra'anana]], served as mayor for 28 years. He championed democracy, equality, education and organized Jewish labor.

== Background ==
Baruch Ostrovsky was born in [[Ukraine]],  in the town of [[Rogachov]], in 1890. In early childhood, receiving a traditional education, he already demonstrated a craving for higher education and [[Zionism]]. In 1912 he immigrated to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] alone, laboring with the pioneers of the [[Second Aliyah]] and joining the [[HaShomer]] organization. A year later, he departed for the [[United States|U.S.]] with the intention of marrying his fiancée, who had by then arrived there from Ukraine. The political situation—the outbreak of [[World War I]]—obstructed his plans to return at once with his family.

== In the USA ==
In 1913 he took part in the founding of [[Ahuza Alef]] in New York, an organization dedicated to the purchase of lands and the establishment of a Hebrew settlement, to be inhabited by Jews tilling their own soil.

While in the US, Ostrovsky earned his living teaching a wide variety of subjects, including Hebrew, history, Bible, as well as [[Yiddish]]. He became a renowned and respected educational figure, as director and inspector of schools as well as principal of the teacher's seminary of the [[Workmen's Circle]] Jewish educational system. Contemporaneously with his educational work, Ostrovsky was active in the Zionist Movement's labor organization, [[Poale Zion]], with the leaders [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Ber Borochov]] and [[Yitzhak Ben-Zvi]]. He directed and published the Youth Organizations' journal.

== In Eretz Israel ==
In 1930 Ostrovsky finally succeeded in fulfilling his Zionist ambition by giving up his comfortable existence in the USA and settling in [[Raanana]], a small town in the [[Sharon plain]], with his wife and two children.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''''"As a Zionist, I abandoned my source of income, the respected position I acquired in America as the principal of a high school in NY, as the head of the Jewish Teachers' Union, as editor of a Jewish Journal and as author of Yiddish school books and immigrated to Eretz Yisrael. A Zionist is not only said ..."''' (Excerpt from Ostrovsky's Diary)''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ostrovsky regarded Raanana as his life project and as [[mayor]], he dedicated himself fully and wholeheartedly to Raanana's construction and development. His public service was a non-paid voluntary post as he refused payment in excess of the salary of an agricultural day laborer, which he was earning. The equivalent of his municipal salary formed a lending fund at the disposal of the needy. Many of the early settlers of Raanana benefited from his support. He displayed sincere concern for the welfare and rights of the laborers. He joined forces to form a variety of beneficial enterprises: a unified labor office, a unified front protecting organized Jewish labor, a joint health fund (''kupat holim'') for all inhabitants of the town, and the establishment of a lending and savings bank; also, the organization of a permanent water supply system for the town.

Ostrovsky's activities as a supporter of organized Jewish labor are augmented by his campaign for laborers' voting rights—deprived from the new-comers by the older Jewish settlements taking advantage of the mandate's discriminatory set of laws. His modest mode of life, scorning all forms of luxury and excess, placed him on equal ground with the hard working and low earning inhabitants of his town. He nurtured good relations with the neighboring Arab villagers, particularly with those of [[Hirbet Azun]]. He set high standards for the city as a 'green' settlement, promoted equality and the welfare of citizens, and laid the foundation stones of many public and educational institutions.

In the mid 1930s, Ostrovsky had already laid the foundations and infrastructure for factories to be built in the settlement of Raanana. 
In December 1949, he initiated the establishment of the industrial zone and directed his efforts to the building of the first industrial plants. This was part of an endeavor to create job opportunities for new immigrants and existing residents alike. 
"We deal with industry exactly as we deal with agriculture" (quoted from the minutes of a local council meeting on 2.1.1951).

Baruch Ostrovsky was a lover of books and his 4000 volume library, encompassing a wide variety of subjects – on the history of the Zionist organization, on Eretz Yisrael, history, philosophy, education, literature and encyclopedias – were at the disposal of those eager to broaden their knowledge in the developing town.

Ostrovsky envisioned the plans for Raanana's first high school though he did not live to see it. Late in his life he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''''"We emigrated from America, not to be capitalists or land-owners, but rather to be Jews and live amongst Jews in an independent Jewish State, a democratic existence of equality, wherein everyone will be capable of earning his living – even if we are the sole followers of this socialistic system."'''''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Circe''' is a [[fictional character]] appearing in [[DC Comics]] publications and related media. Based upon [[Circe|the Greek mythological figure of the same name]] who imprisoned [[Odysseus]] in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', she is a wicked [[Magician (fantasy)|sorceress]] and the recurring foe of [[Wonder Woman]].

Circe first appeared as a ravishing blonde in 1949 in ''Wonder Woman'', vol. 1, issue #37, written by [[Robert Kanigher]] and illustrated by [[Harry G. Peter]]. She would make a [[Silver Age of Comics|Silver Age]] return, going from blonde to raven-haired, to battle [[Rip Hunter]] in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #21 in 1959 (written by Jack Miller and illustrated by Mike Sekowsky), followed by multiple appearances as a foil and sometimes-ally for Superman and Supergirl in ''[[Action Comics]]'' and ''[[Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane]]''. In 1962 her "creator" Robert Kanigher pitted her against the [[Sea Devils (comics)|Sea Devils]] in ''Sea Devils'' #3, illustrated by [[Russ Heath]]. She would get a [[Bronze Age of Comics|Bronze Age]] makeover (this time with auburn hair) in 1983's ''Wonder Woman'' #302, by Dan Mishkin and Gene Colan, making multiple appearances over the next two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcindexes.com |title=Mike's Amazing World of Comics |publisher=Dcindexes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circe would be re-imagined in June 1988,&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #17&lt;/ref&gt; by comics writer/artist [[George Pérez]] as part of his reboot of the Wonder Woman mythos. This version, with red-eyes and violet hair, would become one of Wonder Woman's principal [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Post-Crisis]] foes. Circe was re-introduced yet again in 2011 in ''[[Men of War (comics)|Men of War]]'' (vol. 2) #2, as part of the DC Comics continuity-reboot known as [[The New 52]]. This version of the character, with blood-red hair and pale white skin, was written by Ivan Brandon and illustrated by Tom Derenick.

Hair color aside, all of these versions of Circe have retained a set of key features: immortality, stunning physical beauty, a powerful command over sorcery, a penchant for turning human beings into animals (like her mythological antecedent), and a delight in humiliation.

==Fictional character biography==

===Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths===
[[File:Circe WW37.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Circe debuts in ''Wonder Woman'' #37.]]
In the original DC Comics continuity (prior to the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]''), '''Circe''' is a centuries-old enchantress who is kept young by an elixir called vitae. It is made from a special combination of plants and herbs. While living on the island Aeaea, Circe gains magical powers. Circe is very skilled at turning men into any animal resembling their personality, and, for her crimes against mortalkind, the Amazon Queen Hippolyta banished her to Sorca, "an island planet in space, where she could do no harm".

Upon her return to Earth, Circe tries to destroy Wonder Woman, having heard from an oracle in ancient times that the daughter of Hippolyta will be her undoing. Unlike many of Wonder Woman's other Golden Age foes, Circe does not repent when her plot fails, and a legendary enmity is born. (''Wonder Woman'' #37)&lt;ref name="GCD"&gt;[http://www.comics.org/search/advanced/process/?target=sequence&amp;method=icontains&amp;logic=False&amp;order1=date&amp;order2=series&amp;order3=&amp;start_date=&amp;end_date=&amp;title=&amp;feature=&amp;job_number=&amp;pages=&amp;script=&amp;pencils=&amp;inks=&amp;colors=&amp;letters=&amp;story_editing=&amp;genre=&amp;characters=Circe&amp;synopsis=&amp;reprint_notes=&amp;notes=&amp;pub_name=DC&amp;country=us&amp;pub_notes=&amp;brand=&amp;brand_notes=&amp;indicia_publisher=&amp;is_surrogate=None&amp;ind_pub_notes=&amp;series=&amp;series_notes=&amp;tracking_notes=&amp;issue_count=&amp;language=en&amp;issues=&amp;volume=&amp;issue_title=&amp;variant_name=&amp;issue_date=&amp;indicia_frequency=&amp;price=&amp;issue_pages=&amp;format=&amp;issue_editing=&amp;isbn=&amp;barcode=&amp;issue_notes=&amp;is_indexed=None Circe] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Captain Marvel Adventures'' #66, set on Earth-S, it is revealed the evil immortal [[Oggar]] gave Circe immortality 3,000 years ago when she was a beautiful Graecian princess, hoping she would marry him. But because he did not give her eternal youth she keeps aging and becomes ugly, meaning she hates men who now have a hatred of her face, and learns magic to turn them into animals. Captain Marvel and Oggar battle on her island, and she turns Billy into a goat before turning him back. She finally helps Captain Marvel defeat Oggar by turning him into a boar. He jumps into a bluff and apparently dies, meaning she finally dies happily as his spell wears off.

A woman claiming to be a descendant of the original Circe later appears and gives [[Superman]] an evolution serum, which temporarily transforms him into a partial lion after he does not agree to marry her. She leaves the planet by the time Superman returns to her island. Realizing the serum contains [[kryptonite]], Superman theorizes the original Circe may have been from [[Krypton (comics)|Krypton]]. (''[[Action Comics]]'' #243)&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt;

In ancient times, Circe is responsible for changing Biron the centaur into a horse and later gives him super-powers as [[Comet (DC Comics)|Comet the Super-Horse]]. She is depicted as more heroic during her appearances with Comet and [[Supergirl]] (''Action Comics'' #293, 311, 323, 331).&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt; She also has encounters with [[Lois Lane]] and [[Lana Lang]], and battles [[Rip Hunter]], who meets her during his time travels. (''Superman's Girlfriend Lois Lane'' #13, 39, 40; ''Showcase'' #21) [[Catwoman]] once used Circe's wand to turn Superman into a cat, but he is turned back by an Egyptian mummified magic cat's paw used by Lana Lang.

Later, Saturn Woman (a version of [[Saturn Girl]] from an alternate timeline) poses as Circe as part of Superman’s plan to defeat the [[Superman Revenge Squad]]. (''Superman'' #165)&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt;

During [[World War II]], Circe transforms a British soldier who misses being in the [[cavalry]] into a [[centaur]], then, upon his death, into a horse.  At another point in World War II, she turned Nazis into swine and consumed them.&lt;ref&gt;Both stories are in ''[[Weird War Tales]]'' #65.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character reappears, unnamed, in ''Wonder Woman'' #302 (April 1983)&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt; and is identified as Circe in issue #305 (July 1983)&lt;ref name="GCD" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manning|first= Matthew K.|last2=Dolan|first2=Hannah, ed.|chapter= 1980s|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |year=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 202 |quote = The sorceress Circe stepped out of the pages of Homer's ''Odyssey'' and into the modern mythology of the DC Universe in ''Wonder Woman'' #305, courtesy of Dan Mishkin's script and Gene Colan's pencils.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Circe reappeared with a mission to kill Wonder Woman in order to prevent an oracular prophecy of Circe's death at Wonder Woman's hands from coming true. After she failed to kill the Amazon with a series of attacks by man-animal hybrids, she took up with the Aztec god [[Tezcatlipoca (DC Comics)|Tezcatlipoca]], who set in motion a chain of events that led Wonder Woman to the jungles of Tropidor. Circe called on the god to send lightning down to kill Wonder Woman, who deflected the lightning bolts away from her and incinerated the herbs that made Circe immortal, thus fulfilling the prophecy. Circe then disappeared, swallowed up by Tezcatlipoca's magic obsidian mirror, which the god used to torture her with an image of herself as a crone.

Circe begins to age normally and is last seen aiding a group of sorcerers who are trying to defeat the [[Anti-Monitor]]. (''Wonder Woman'' vol. 1 #302, 305, 312-314; ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' #9, 12)

===Post-Crisis on Infinite Earths===
Following the ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', ''Wonder Woman'' and ''Superman'' are rebooted. All of Circe's prior continuity is erased and she is reintroduced with a revamped history.

====Greek mythology background====
[[Circe]] is the daughter of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]] and [[Oceanid|Perseis]]. Circe is a powerful witch and former princess of [[Colchis]]. A beautiful, violet-haired, red-eyed sorceress, she is known for turning people into animals (which are called bestiamorphs), as well as for powers of mind control. Circe has been a devoted follower of the goddess [[Hecate]] for thousands of years. She has lived on the island of [[Aeaea]] where she became a powerful being in both magic and in influence over portions of man's world. During his adventure to her island, Circe fell in love with [[Odysseus]] and bore him three sons: [[Agrius]], [[Latinus]], and [[Telegonus]].

Though Circe's patron goddess Hecate was an offspring of the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]], she was not considered one of the main [[Olympian Gods (DC Comics)|Twelve Olympians]]. [[Zeus]] gave Hecate much respect, but she did not hold much favor with others on Olympus. As such, she married the god [[Hades]], but their marriage did not last and Hecate was demoted as handmaiden to her former husband's new wife. Because of this, she left the realm of the gods and agreed to render her soul to her most devoted servant Circe. This caused Circe to attain her current goddess-level of power and immortality.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Jimenez | first = Phil | author-link = Phil Jimenez | contribution = Circe | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | page = 83  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Beginning of relationship with Wonder Woman====
[[File:CirceBattle.png|thumb|180px|left|[[Wonder Woman|Diana]] and Circe battle above [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]].&lt;br&gt;Art by [[Mike Deodato]].]]When Hecate transferred her soul to Circe, she said the words: ''Upon the death of witch and the birth of witch, Hecate, by name and choice, shall repossess her soul''.  In addition to being goddess of witchcraft, Hecate is also a goddess of the moon.  When Circe learned that Wonder Woman shared her name with moon goddess Diana, she decided that Hecate's cryptic warning must refer to her.  Fearing that Diana would steal Hecate's soul and power, Circe decided to destroy her.

Once Diana learned of Hecate's pronouncement, she too felt it pertained to her, but of course Diana has no desire to have the soul of Hecate possessing her body.  This issue is central to the conflict between the two women.

====War of the Gods====

Circe's most ambitious gambit was inciting war between the various pantheons of gods throughout the DC Multiverse, becoming known as the [[War of the Gods (comics)|War of the Gods]]. Circe's overall ploy was to gain the power of all the warring pantheons after they had defeated or destroyed one another. Another plot of the war was to disgrace Diana and the Amazons in the eyes of the world by portraying them as terrorists, allying herself with the Amazons of [[Bana-Mighdall]] to this effect. True to her nature, Circe eventually betrayed them as well. Over the course of the war, Circe succeeded in killing Hermes, who had since been in a severely weakened state from being away from Olympus for so long and temporarily devolving Diana herself out of existence by reverting her back into the clay from which she had been formed. Finally realizing the truth of Circe's deceptions, Earth's heroes launched an assault on New Olympus, which Circe had conquered and pitted the gods of the Olympian and Roman pantheons against them. Elsewhere, with the aid of the [[Spectre (comics)|Spectre]], [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]], and the [[Phantom Stranger]], Diana was restored to life and in a concerted effort with [[Donna Troy]], used the amulet of [[Harmonia (mythology)|Harmonia]] to open a portal into an alternate universe where the [[Titans of Myth (comics)|Titans of Myth]] resided. This caused the soul of Hecate herself to withdraw from Circe's body, which rapidly aged and crumbled to dust. Hecate then attempted to take possession of Diana, but was destroyed by the [[Lasso of Truth]].&lt;ref&gt;''War of the Gods'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Circe returned to life sometime later, though no explanation has ever been given for this.

====Amazon betrayal====
After the Amazons of [[Bana-Mighdall]] lost their Egyptian city at the hands of Diana's gods and turned to Circe for revenge, Circe remained true to her word and granted the Bana-Mighdallian Amazons immortality and teleported them to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]] in order for them to take over the island for themselves. Unfortunately for them though, after this was done, Circe eventually showed her hatred for all Amazons by betraying the alliance she had with the desert Amazons and cast the island and all its inhabitants into a dimension of demons. Thus, both tribes of Amazons spent several years battling demons for their own survival. When Diana discovered what the witch had done, she forced Circe to return the island back to its original location after losing a bet with the Amazon.

This is not the only time Circe has lost a bet to Wonder Woman and was forced to cancel a spell made against her. Later, Circe caused [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Queen Hippolyta]] to forget who she was and instead embrace the false life of a domestic housewife. Circe told Diana that if she could get Hippolyta to drink the antidote she would call off her attack. Diana was successful and Circe showed herself honorable once more by reversing all magical effects as promised.

====Donna Milton====
[[File:DonnaMilton.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Circe as Donna Milton discovering her true identity.&lt;br&gt;Art by [[Mike Deodato]].]]One attempt Circe made in trying to destroy Diana involved a disguise as a mortal lawyer named Donna Milton.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #78-100&lt;/ref&gt; In this persona, she could get close enough to Diana in order to kill her when her defenses were low. Afraid that Diana would see through her disguise with her power of truth, Circe cast a spell on herself. The spell made Circe believe that she actually was Donna Milton and her true persona would only return when Donna could strike. As Donna Milton, she was hired by the mobster Ares Buchanan, who was really the god [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] in disguise himself. During their time together, they formed a romantic relationship and Donna became pregnant. As Donna, Circe actually became a good friend of Diana and ended up saving her life from Ares. He was sucked into a miniature black hole while Donna went into labor. No longer working for Ares, Donna gave birth to her daughter [[Lyta Milton]]&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #84&lt;/ref&gt; and became Diana's lawyer at her and [[Micah Rains]]' new detective agency.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' (vol. 2) #94&lt;/ref&gt; When the Amazon [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]] single-handedly battled the [[White Magician]], Diana realized that Donna was actually Circe and begged her to help transport her to Artemis' side. Not believing Diana and hurt that her friend would think her to be a villain, Donna yelled at Diana to leave and subconsciously teleported Diana to Artemis. Shocked, Circe's memories slowly began coming back to her. Still possessing some of Donna's false memories, she teleported herself to Diana in order to help her in her battle. Unfortunately, she was not on top of her game as she still had ties to her Donna Milton body, and the White Magician was not affected by her magical attacks. She used the remainder of her power to save Diana by teleporting herself, a demonically-altered [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]], and Cassandra Arnold, a television reporter and the White Magician's lover, away from the battle, leaving her last words to Diana be ''"You're my only friend, Diana."'' This is the last we see of Diana's friend Donna Milton.

====Expanded horizons====
Circe would make a [[Faust]]ian deal with the demon-lord [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] to sell her soul to him in exchange for increased magical powers. She later formed part of the [[Injustice Gang]] gathered by [[Lex Luthor]], alongside the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], [[Doctor Light (Arthur Light)|Dr. Light]], and the [[Ocean Master]]. During a fight with the JLA, she became preoccupied with [[Plastic Man]]. His shapeshifting powers allowed him to immediately change out of the animal forms she turned him into. She later proposed both a business and romantic relationship with Luthor, which he immediately shot down.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''President Luthor Secret Files and Origins'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Witch and the Warrior====
[[File:CircesGang.jpg|thumb|180px|Circe tries to take over [[New York City]] with her super-powered allies. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].]]
Shortly before [[Imperiex]] assaulted the Earth, Circe struck at Diana through her friends. She allied herself with Sebastian Ballesteros, who had usurped the power of the [[Cheetah (comics)|Cheetah]] from Barbara Ann Minerva and turned Diana's friend Vanessa Kapatelis into the new [[Silver Swan (comics)|Silver Swan]]. Ballestros also became Circe's lover. She reveals herself after Vanessa attacks [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]], luring Diana into battle. After Hippolyta dies saving Diana from an Imperiex probe, Circe launches an attack on [[New York City]]. Her scheme involved the transformation of all male superheroes into her bestiamorphs save for [[Martian Manhunter|J'onn Jonzz]], [[Beast Boy]], and Plastic Man, whom she took special means to keep imprisoned due to their shape-shifting abilities. She also imprisoned and transformed her former confederates in the Injustice Gang, taking particular delight in tormenting Luthor. Since the only persons who were not affected by the spell were women, many female superheroes entered the city in an attempt to save their friends and stop the witch's plan. However, Circe had planned for such a rescue and convinced the female members of various supervillain communities to join forces and stop the heroes by any means necessary. Leading the pack against Circe was Wonder Woman, who Circe also expected, sending a [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]-altered [[Superman]]. She hoped to demoralize the world by making Superman and Wonder Woman kill one another, while she transmitted the fight in a global [[simulcast]]. Ultimately, Circe was unsuccessful in her plan as a majority of the female heroes were able to change back their male super-powered friends with the use of the herb [[Moly (herb)|moly]], which has a tendency to disrupt Circe's magic. After a protracted fight, Diana broke Circe's spell on Superman with her lasso. Luthor and the Joker managed to free themselves and threaten Circe's daughter. She quickly overpowered them and escaped with her allies. Circe continued to harass Diana and Donna Troy, appearing in their dreams as a dying Hippolyta. Diana tracked Circe to the [[Parthenon]], where they fought in single combat, again on a global simulcast. Circe had cast spells on herself to make her Diana's physical equal, but ultimately she was defeated. During the fight, she claimed her hatred of Diana was fueled by the hypocrisy and naivete she perceived in Diana's beliefs in a better world. She attempted to goad Diana into killing her, but Diana spared her.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' Vol. 2 #174-176&lt;/ref&gt;

She was also rescued from possible death by the two living [[Gorgon]] sisters [[Stheno]] and [[Euryale (Gorgon)|Euryale]] once the island of Themyscira toppled into the sea. As repayment, Circe revived their long-dead sister [[Medusa (DC Comics)|Medusa]], who eventually became a fellow enemy of Wonder Woman.

Shortly after Medusa's defeat, Circe's daughter Lyta was kidnapped by her father [[Ares (DC Comics)|Ares]] while under the protection of the Amazons on [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]]. Confronting Ares, she soon discovered that the time of the gods was at a crossroads and joined Ares as his consort as the new ruler of [[Tartarus]]. Thus, Lyta continued to be cared for by both of her parents, reunited.

===="One Year Later"====
[[File:WonderCirce.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Circe steals Wonder Woman's abilities in issues #3-4 of ''Wonder Woman''. Art by [[Terry Dodson]].]]
In the "[[One Year Later]]" storyline, Circe was revealed to be the source behind the new upgrades to Wonder Woman's rogues gallery, increasing their power "beyond their wildest imaginings". Circe stole Diana's powers, explaining her rationale for doing so was to avenge wronged women whom she believed Diana had no real interest in helping. After completing the spell, Circe is shown in an altered Wonder Woman-style costume and proceeds to slaughter slave traders in various cities. This greatly resembles a previous occurrence written by [[Phil Jimenez]] in which Circe magically caused herself to possess the strength of "Earth's strongest woman". During her battle with Diana, she proceeded to alter her costume several times. Diana eventually regains her powers from Circe but it was revealed that Circe and Hercules were the only [[Olympian Gods (comics)|Greek gods]] to disobey [[Athena]]'s orders to leave the earthly realm. It is assumed that she left her daughter Lyta in the care of her father Ares.{{issue|date=February 2014}}

She was also responsible for giving [[Everyman (DC Comics)|Everyman]] his shapeshifting powers back in order to replace [[Sarge Steel]] at the Department of Metahuman Affairs and instigate the events leading up to the [[Amazons Attack!]] storyline. It was during this storyline that Circe revived the long-dead mother of Wonder Woman and convinced her to reclaim her throne in order to attack the U.S. capital, [[Washington, D.C.]] Once Hippolyta discovered that part of Circe's plans involved the destruction of Themyscira, she threw a spear into Circe's chest, critically wounding her. She was presumed to have been killed, but she appeared at the end of ''Amazons Attack! #4'' alive and well. She explains that she brought about the events of Amazons Attack to punish the Olympian Gods for allowing Ares to steal her daughter Lyta from her. Circe was then banished to Hades by a disguised [[Granny Goodness]] who stole the persona of the goddess Athena.&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Circe is re-established as a pale, red-haired sorceress with a vendetta against Queen Hippolyta and the Amazons. She allied herself with [[Magog (comics)|Magog]] and used her magical abilities to manipulate Superman into battling Wonder Woman. However, Wonder Woman broke Superman out of the mind control, and the pair defeated Circe and Magog.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman / Wonder Woman'' #14-17 (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

===DC Rebirth===
After the events of [[DC Rebirth]], Circe's history was altered. Seven years after Diana left Themyscira to become Wonder Woman, the C.E.O. of Empire Industries, Veronica Cale, performed a ritual to summon Circe in order to exact her revenge on the gods Deimos and Phobos, who had taken the soul of Cale's daughter Isadore. After bargaining, Circe agreed to help Cale. She gave her detailed instructions and then returned to her lair to begin her spell of binding.

Circe later confronted Wonder Woman in Al-Doha, Qurac. She spoke in Diana's native Amazonian language, which surprised the warrior. After killing several soldiers, Circe tricked Wonder Woman into wrapping her lasso around the witch, enabling her to complete the ritual to bind Deimos and Phobos into the forms of dogs. Circe then teleported back to Veronica Cale and [[Doctor Cyber]], Cale's ally. Circe then revealed to Cale that her daughter's soul was not in the soulstone as she previously believed. Circe communicated to Deimos and Phobos in their animal forms, discovering that Isadore's soul had been taken by Ares, who was imprisoned on Themyscira. Circe refused to help Cale any further, as she realized to free Cale's daughter would involve freeing Ares from his prison.&lt;ref&gt;''Wonder Woman'' #20 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reclaiming her soul====

Years later, Circe allied herself with [[Lex Luthor]] and [[Ra's al Ghul]] after discovering the Pandora Pits. The trio fought a creature that emerged from the pits, representing their fear and hatred towards [[Wonder Woman]], [[Superman]], and [[Batman]]. They managed to defeat the creature by combining their powers.&lt;ref&gt;''Trinity'' #7 (2017)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Luthor leaves immediately afterward, Ra’s remains behind and Circe explains that the pits contain an army of demons which require a sacrifice in order to be released. The pair is interrupted by [[Etrigan the Demon]] who has detected the pits. During the confrontation, Ra’s cuts Etrigan and his blood touches the pits. They then absorb him and separate him from his human host, Jason Blood. Etrigan is also turned into a giant demon and attacks a nearby town, accompanied by an army of demons. Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman arrive and enact a spell to trap Etrigan inside Jason Blood again, though the spell requires their sacrifice. Circe intervenes and saves them, knowing she needs them alive for her plan. Ra’s and she then teleport away to [[Antarctica]] where the Pandora Pits have reappeared. They then greet [[Jason Todd|Red Hood]], [[Artemis of Bana-Mighdall|Artemis]], and [[Bizarro]], having lured them to the location.&lt;ref&gt;''Trinity Annual'' #1 (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

Circe and Ra’s then have the pits possess Red Hood and the Outlaws and send them to attack Gotham, where they battle Batman, Superman, and Wonder Woman. [[John Constantine]], [[Zatanna]], and [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]] are summoned by Batman to assist them. However, Zatanna and Deadman end up being swallowed by a possessed Red Hood and teleported to the Pandora Pits in Antarctica. John Constantine follows them and tricks Circe into using Deadman to possess Superman, all in a bid to buy time for his allies.

It is revealed that long ago, Circe sold her soul to a dimension of Hell and has tried over the centuries to regain it. The Pandora Pits are actually a portal that leads to the realm where Circe’s soul is located. The narration, told by Circe herself, also confesses that she believes death has finally come for her and she is in fact scared of dying. She then betrays Ra’s and has Zatanna possessed, who brings her Superman and Wonder Woman.

She prepares to sacrifice them when Batman intervenes with the Outlaws whom he has freed from Circe’s control. Circe fights back by having her Animen form a colossus around her, only to be subdued by the heroes. Ra’s then stabs Circe in revenge for her betrayal before tossing her into the pits. In what she thinks are her final moments, Circe again expresses her fear of dying before being rescued by Wonder Woman.

====Helping Wonder Woman====

When Diana is struck by the witchmark of the goddess Hecate, she travels to Aeaea along with the Justice League Dark, hoping Circe can help due to her being a worshipper of Hecate. At first Circe transforms the male members of the League into Ani-men, but upon seeing Diana’s witchmark, she quickly reverses her spell and admits that she plays the role of a supervillain purely to occupy herself. Circe goes as far as to console Diana, knowing full well what the witchmark signifies. Refusing to become Hecate’s puppet, Wonder Woman formulates a plan and Circe casts a spell allowing Diana to control Hecate’s power without becoming its slave.

==Powers and abilities==
Circe is a goddess-level witch of vastly powerful magical/mystical energy and strength; as such, she is immortal. She is able to transform reality and solid matter through magic and spells. Among other things, she can alter minds, fire destructive magical energy blasts, create illusions, revive the dead (as she did with Medusa), teleport, and transform objects and beings. Her "signature move" is transforming men into various animals, like when she turned Odysseus' men into pigs. She can also use her transformative magics on herself, which further multiplies her natural abilities to superhuman levels, therefore giving her superhuman strength, endurance, agility, reflexes, superhuman speed, and resistance to most bodily injury. This makes her more of a match for [[Wonder Woman]].

Circe also possesses a magical mirror, often referred to as "the Mirror of Circe", that allows anyone holding it to alter their features into that of another. It is considered a forbidden object by the Olympian gods but has been stolen several times and used by [[Hercules (DC Comics)|Hercules]]. Circe also can magically summon, lure, and seduce men towards her with her enchantingly beautiful, seductive, melodic hypnotic calls, vocalized melodies, lullabies, or songs, similar to that of a [[Siren (mythology)|siren]]. She can also project strong bursts of purple fire from her hands.

==Other versions==
* Circe appears in issue 7 of the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold (comics)|Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' comics. She is seen at the beginning being defeated by Batman and [[Olympian (comics)|Olympian]].

In the alternate timeline of the "[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" storyline, Circe was imprisoned by [[Hippolyta (DC Comics)|Hippolyta]]'s sister Penthesileia in [[Antarctica]] for uncovering the truth of the Western European Amazon/Atlantean war. After getting the [[High Priestess (Tarot card)]], [[Traci Thirteen]] transports herself there and breaks Circe's chains.&lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint'' #2 (July 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JLUCirce.jpg|135px|thumb|Circe as depicted in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "This Little Piggy."]]

* Circe appears in the ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'' episode "This Little Piggy" voiced by Broadway actress [[Rachel York]], who also sings the 1935 hit ''Lulu's Back in Town'' (music by [[Harry Warren]], lyrics by [[Al Dubin]]) in the episode. Upon her release from imprisonment in Hades, Circe is barred from attacking her old foe Hippolyta. She decides to get her revenge through Hippolyta's daughter, Wonder Woman. In the episode, she liberally displays her powers of transforming humans and other objects into animals, even turning [[Wonder Woman]] into a [[pig]] and transforming [[Batman]]'s batarangs into [[doves]]. She restores Diana to normal after Batman tracks her down with the aid of [[Zatanna]], accepting a deal where Batman will 'sacrifice' his dignity by singing in a club. Circe appears in the episode "Dead Reckoning", when Wonder Woman, Batman, and Deadman are trying to find the sorceress that helped Lex Luthor and other villains to escape (this turns out to be a different DC Comics sorceress, [[Tala (comics)|Tala]]).

Upon defeating Wonder Woman and Queen Hippolyta, they claim Queen Hippolyta's spear and head to the Forbidden Realm. When in the Forbidden Realm, Circe and Lex Luthor obtain the Oculus of the Argo which gives Lex Luthor the powers and appearance of Zeus. Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman arrive to fight the three villains where Circe manages to slowly turn them into trees. Before fully turning into a tree, Wonder Woman uses her Lasso of Truth on Lex Luthor which forces him to admit that he will ditch Circe. This causes Circe to turn against Lex Luthor where she disarms him of the Oculus of the Argo and restores Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman to normal. While Superman apprehends Lex Luthor, Wonder Woman managed to catch Circe. Upon Superman, Wonder Woman, and Batman returning to Themyscira, Queen Hippolyta has a bound Circe taken to Tartarus.

'''Connie Chiu''' (born 1969) is the world's first [[fashion model]] with [[albinism]].

Chiu was born in [[British Hong Kong]] to a [[China|Chinese]] family. Like many people with albinism, she has to protect her [[photosensitive]] eyes and skin from the sunlight. As a result, her family moved to [[Sweden]] when she was seven.

Connie Chiu was first introduced to modeling when her sister asked her to become a model at one of her final shows. At age 25, Chiu began modeling for [[fashion photographer]]s such as [[Terry Richardson]], [[Paul Burley]], [[Heidi Niemala]] and [[Morten Smidt]]. Chiu later studied [[journalism]].

Chiu starred in the music video for the single "Stalker" by [[Recoil (band)|Recoil]], the solo project of [[Depeche Mode]] member [[Alan Wilder]].

[[File:Doddy4GenerationsAug1931A.jpg|250px|thumb|A 1931 photograph of four generations of [[mother]]s and daughters]]
A '''daughter''' is a [[girl]], [[woman]], or female animal in relation to her [[parent]]s. '''Daughterhood''' is the state of being someone's daughter.  The male counterpart is a [[son]]. Analogously the name is used in several areas to show relations between groups or elements. The word daughter also has several other connotations attached to it. One of these being that the term daughter can also be used in reference to female descendancy or consanguinity.  It can also be used as a term of endearment coming from an elder.

In [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] societies, daughters often have different or lesser familial rights than sons. A family may prefer to have sons rather than daughters because the daughters are subjected to [[female infanticide]].&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Dorothy: ''[https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2760461?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101175452067 Burning widows, burning brides: The perils of daughterhood in India].'' Pacific Affairs, Vol 61, No. 3, p. 465.  University of British Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt;  In some societies it is the custom for a daughter to be 'sold' to her husband, who must pay a [[bride price]]. The reverse of this custom, where the parents pay the husband a sum of money to compensate for the financial burden of the woman, is found in societies where women do not labour outside the home, and is referred to as [[dowry]].

==Perception==
In the United States, the birth rate is 105 sons to 100 daughters which has been the natural birth rate since the 18th century. About 80 percent of prospective adoptive parents from the US will choose a girl over a boy.    {{Citation needed|date=February 2015}} In clinics that enable sex preferences, daughters are usually preferred over sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2010/07/the-end-of-men/308135/|title=The End of Men|first=Hanna|last=Rosin|date=8 June 2010|website=theatlantic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Daughters in Literature ==
The role of the daughter has been an important theme in literature, especially when exploring relationships between family members and gender roles. Through exploration of the relationship between children and their parents, readers can draw conclusions about the impact of parenting style on the growth and development of a child's character and personality.

Notable daughters whose character and development has been impacted by their parents in literature have been:

'''Eric Edgar Cooke''' (25 February 1931 – 26 October 1964), nicknamed the "'''Night Caller'''", was an [[Australia]]n [[serial killer]]. From 1959 to 1963, he terrorised the city of [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]], by committing 22 violent crimes, eight of which resulted in deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.postnewspapers.com.au/20030201/news/002.shtml|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030202114507/http://www.postnewspapers.com.au/20030201/news/002.shtml|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2 February 2003|author=Christian, Bret|work=Post Newspapers|accessdate=2006-09-21|title=Police decoy used in killer hunt sting|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==

=== Childhood ===
Eric Cooke was born on 25 February 1931 in [[Victoria Park, Western Australia|Victoria Park]], a suburb of [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], and was the eldest of three children.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130543b.htm|title=Cooke, Edgar Eric (1931 - 1964)|accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooke was born into an unhappy, violent family; his parents married solely because his mother, Christine, was pregnant with him, and his [[alcoholic]] father, Vivian, beat him frequently, especially when the boy tried to protect his mother from the elder Cooke's drunken rages. Christine Cooke would sleep in the staff room at her job in the Como Hotel to avoid beatings. Much like his mother, Cooke would hide underneath the house or roam neighbouring streets just to escape a night of his father's violence. Cooke was also placed in [[orphanage]]s or [[foster homes]] on occasion.

Cooke was frequently hospitalised for head injuries and had suspected brain damage because of his accident-proneness. Later it was questioned whether this was due to repressed [[suicide|suicidal tendencies]]. He also suffered from recurrent headaches and was once admitted to an [[History of psychiatric institutions|asylum]]. His reported blackouts later stopped after an operation in 1949.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Cooke was born with a [[cleft lip and palate|hare lip and a cleft palate]], for which he had one operation when he was three months old and another when he was 3½. Surgical operations to repair the deformities were not totally successful, and left him with a slight facial deformity, and he spoke in a mumble; these handicaps made him the target of bullying at school.&lt;ref&gt;''Broken Lives'' p.18. (Blackburn writes that Cooke had an operation on his lip at 3 months as a baby and for his cleft palate at 3½ years of age)&lt;/ref&gt;  In her book, ''[[Broken Lives]]'', journalist [[Estelle Blackburn]]'s telling of the murders, he is described as "a short, slight man with dark, wavy hair and a twisted mouth..." Cooke's disfigurements made him ashamed, shy, and emotionally unstable at a young age due to the beatings and bullying that came with it.

Though very good at subjects that required retentive memory and manual dexterity, Cooke was expelled from Subiaco State School for stealing money from a teacher's purse at the age of six. Once he was transferred to Newcastle Street Infants' School, Cooke was again the butt of many jokes with his mumble and scar. He continued to be made fun of at every school he attended, including Highgate Primary School, Forrest Street Primary School, and Newcastle Street Junior Technical School. He left school at 14 to work as a delivery boy for Central Provision Stores in order to support the family. He would give his weekly wages to his mother who could not fully support the family with the money she earned from cooking and cleaning. Many of Cooke's jobs put him in the hospital due to his accident-proneness. At a job in the factory of Harris, Scarfe and Sandover, Cooke landed in the hospital due to effects of being struck on the nose by a [[winch]]. At the age of 16, he worked as a hammer boy in the blacksmith section of the workshop at Midland Junction, where he always signed his lunch bag "Al Capone," and ended up burning his face with steam and suffering second-degree burns. At the same job he jarred his right hand and also injured the thumb of his other hand.&lt;ref name="aus"/&gt;

As a teenager, starting at 17, Cooke spent his nights involved in petty crimes and [[vandalism]]; he would later serve 18 months in jail for burning down a church after he was rejected in a choir audition. During his later teenage years, Cooke would sneak into houses and steal whatever he found valuable. These crimes escalated to damaging clothing and furniture in acts of vengeance. He would cut out newspaper accounts of his crimes to impress his acquaintances in an attempt to gain friends.

=== Adulthood ===
At Cooke's grandmother's house on 12 March 1949, police finally caught up with the young vandal, finding evidence at his house. His fingerprints were then matched to those found in other open cases. At the age of 18, on 24 May 1949, Cooke was sentenced to three years in prison after being arrested for arson and vandalism by a Detective Burrows who considered the boy one of "life's unfortunates." He was convicted on two charges of stealing, seven of breaking and entering and four of arson. He left many fingerprints and easy clues for detectives which would  teach him to be more careful in his future crimes.

At the age of 21, Cooke joined the regular [[Australian Army]], but was discharged three months later after it was discovered that before enlistment he had had a juvenile record for theft, breaking and entering, and [[arson]]. During his training, he was quickly promoted to [[lance corporal]] and was taught to handle firearms.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

On 14 October 1953, Cooke, then aged 22, married Sarah (Sally) Lavin, a 19-year-old waitress,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Cooke, Sarah | author2=Condon, Judy | title=[Interview with Sarah Cooke] | publication-date=2006 | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/157756183 | accessdate=5 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Methodist]] Church in Cannington.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; They ultimately had a large family of seven children, four boys and three girls.

After marriage, Cooke was arrested several times as a "[[Voyeurism|peeping tom]]" and for other minor offences. In 1955 he was arrested for stealing a car and sentenced to two years hard labour. After his release, he took to wearing women's gloves while committing crimes in order to avoid leaving fingerprints.

==Murder spree==
Cooke's victims included Jillian Macpherson Brewer, 22; Brian Weir, 29; John Sturkey, 19; George Walmsley, 54; Shirley Martha McLeod, 18; Constance Lucy Madrill, 24; Patricia Vinico Berkman, 33; and Rosemary Anderson, 17. As his crimes were opportunistic and used varying methods, and his victims shared no obvious common traits, predicting where he would strike and catching him was difficult.

Cooke's killing spree involved a series of seemingly unrelated hit-and-runs, stabbings, stranglings, and shootings. Victims were shot with different rifles, stabbed with knives and scissors, and hit with an axe. Several were killed after waking up as Cooke was robbing their homes, two were shot while sleeping without their homes being disturbed, and one was shot dead after answering a knock on the door. After stabbing one victim, Cooke got lemonade from the refrigerator and sat on the veranda drinking it. One victim was strangled to death with the cord from a bedside lamp, after which Cooke [[necrophilia|raped the corpse]], dragged it to a neighbour's lawn, then sexually penetrated it with an empty whiskey bottle, which he left cradled in the victim's arms.

Two of Cooke's murders resulted in false convictions. One of them, for which a man named [[John Button (campaigner)|John Button]] was wrongly convicted, involved Rosemary Anderson. Another was the murder of Jillian Macpherson Brewer, a Melbourne heiress who was stabbed with a hatchet and scissors, which led to  the false conviction of [[Darryl Beamish]]. Beamish was initially sentenced to death, but an investigation by ''[[Post Newspapers]]'' owner [[Bret Christian]] led to his conviction being overturned. The police case against Beamish is detailed in Christian's book ''[[Presumed Guilty: When Cops get it Wrong and Courts Seal the Deal|Presumed Guilty]]''.

During the 1960s, people in Australia frequently left cars unlocked and/or with the keys in the ignition, which enabled Cooke to steal a car almost every night. He sometimes returned stolen vehicles without the owners becoming aware of the theft, including several cars that were involved in hit-and-runs. Cooke's first hit-and-run was on Nel Schneider, 29, a mother of four who came to Australia from Amsterdam in September 1955. After being thrown from her bike, Schneider was left with a fractured skull and permanent brain damage.

The police investigation included fingerprinting more than 30,000 males over the age of 12, as well as locating and test-firing more than 60,000 [[.22 Long Rifle|.22]] rifles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.police.wa.gov.au/LinkClick.aspx?link=PDFs/Episodes_WAPolicingHistory.pdf&amp;tabid=1060 Episodes in Western Australia's Policing History] (1963 Serial killer Cooke) Western Australia Police&lt;/ref&gt; After a rifle was found hidden in a [[Geraldton Wax]] bush on Rookwood Street, [[Mount Pleasant, Western Australia|Mount Pleasant]], in August 1963, [[Ballistics|ballistic tests]] proved the gun to have been used in the murder of Shirley McLeod. Police returned to the location and tied a similar rifle, rendered inoperable, to the bush with fishing line and constructed a [[Bird hide|hide]] in which they waited in case someone returned for it. Cooke was apprehended when he returned to collect the weapon 17 days later.

Cooke confessed to many crimes, including eight murders and fourteen attempted murders.&lt;ref name="aus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trulyunusual.com/wards/showthread.php?t=3356|title=Eric Edgar Cooke - The Night Caller|accessdate=2008-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was convicted on a charge of murdering John Lindsay Sturkey, one of Cooke's five [[Australia Day]] shooting victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Blackburn, Estelle|title=Broken lives|year=2005|publisher=Hardie Grant|isbn=1-74064-073-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his confessions, Cooke demonstrated an exceptionally good memory for the details of his crimes irrespective of how long ago he had committed the offences. For example, he confessed to more than 250 burglaries and was able to detail exactly what he took, including the number and denominations of the coins he had stolen from each location.

''Presumed Guilty'' includes Cooke's confession, made over two days in September 1963 at [[Fremantle Prison]] to his [[Legal Aid]] lawyer Desmond Heenan. "I have a great respect for the law, although my actions don't show this," Cooke said.

==Conviction and execution==
[[File:Eric Cooke, Martha Rendell, Fremantle Cemetery.jpg|right|thumb|Cooke's grave in plot 409, [[Fremantle Cemetery]]]]
Cooke [[insanity defense|pleaded not guilty on the grounds of insanity]]. At trial, Cooke's lawyers claimed that he suffered from [[schizophrenia]], but this claim was dismissed after the director of the state mental health services testified that he was sane. The state would not allow independent psychiatric specialists to examine Cooke.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt; Cooke was convicted of willful murder on 28 November 1963 after a three-day trial by jury in the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia]] before Justice Virtue.

He was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] by [[hanging]] and, despite having grounds to appeal, he ordered his lawyers not to apply, claiming that he deserved to pay for what he had done. After 13 months in New Division, Cooke was hanged at 8 a.m. on 26 October 1964 in Fremantle Prison. Ten minutes before the sentence was carried out, Cooke swore on the [[Bible]] that he had killed Jillian Brewer and Rosemary Anderson, claims which had been previously rejected because other people had already been convicted of those murders.

Cooke was the last person to be hanged in the state of Western Australia. He was buried in [[Fremantle Cemetery]], above the remains of child killer [[Martha Rendell]], who was hanged in Fremantle Prison in 1909.

==People wrongly convicted of Cooke's crimes==
[[File:meboys.jpg|thumb|right|[[Darryl Beamish]], [[Estelle Blackburn]] and [[John Button (campaigner)|John Button]] at the Supreme Court following Beamish's exoneration on 1 April 2005 (44 years after his conviction). Button was exonerated on 25 February 2002, 39 years after his conviction.]]
Cooke's confessions appeared to exculpate two men who had already been tried separately, convicted and imprisoned for the killing of Jillian Macpherson Brewer (1959) and Rosemary Anderson (1963) respectively:

*[[Darryl Beamish]], a [[deaf]] [[speech disorder|mute]], was convicted in December 1961 of murdering Brewer.
*[[John Button (campaigner)|John Button]] was convicted of [[manslaughter]], following the death of Rosemary Anderson, his girlfriend.   Anderson was one of Cooke's first hit and run victims. However, after intense questioning, Button confessed to the murder.

Despite Cooke's 1963 confession, Beamish served 15 years, while Button was sentenced to ten years and served five as prisoner No. 29050.

The appeal court dismissed Button's initial appeal, even though Cooke had provided details that only the culprit could have known; in particular, the judges did not believe Cooke's claim that Anderson's body was thrown "over the roof" of an [[Holden EJ]] without damaging its [[sun visor]], as Cooke had claimed. Over subsequent decades, Button and his supporters &amp;ndash; including newspaper owner Bret Christian and journalist [[Estelle Blackburn]] &amp;ndash; continued to press for a retrial, a campaign that included a well-publicized 1998 simulated reenactment of Anderson's death, conducted by [[crash test]] experts, with both a Holden matching one believed to have been used by Cooke on the night in question, and a 1963 [[Simca Aronde#Australian production|Simca Aronde]] like the car owned by Button, which were both driven at a [[crash test dummy]]. The dummy was thrown over the roof of the Holden, as Cooke had claimed, and the damage sustained matched the records of a [[panel beater|panelbeating]] business that had, in 1963, repaired the vehicle driven by Cooke. The experts found that the sun visor flexed when hit by a body and returned to its original shape, without even cracking the paint. An expert from the United States was brought to Australia and four 1960s cars were purchased by Bret Christian to prove Cooke's car, not Button's, drove into Rosemary Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;[[Presumed Guilty: When Cops get it Wrong and Courts Seal the Deal|Presumed Guilty]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beamish's initial appeal was also dismissed because the court did not believe Cooke's evidence. The prosecution claimed that his confessions were an attempt to prolong his own trial and the then-[[Chief Justice of Western Australia]], Sir [[Albert Wolff (Australian judge)|Albert Wolff]], called Cooke a "villainous unscrupulous liar".&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

In 2002, the [[Supreme Court of Western Australia|Court of Criminal Appeal]] quashed Button's conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decisions.justice.wa.gov.au/supreme/supdcsn.nsf/PDFJudgments-WebVw/2002WASCA0035/$FILE/2002WASCA0035.pdf|title=Button -v- The Queen [2002] WASCA 35|year=2002|publisher=Supreme Court of Western Australia}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Button's success opened the way for an appeal by Darryl Beamish, who was acquitted in 2005. In both cases, the appeal judges found that the murders had probably been committed by Cooke.&lt;ref name="news.smh.com.au"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/ex-gratia-payment-for-wrongly-jailed-man-20110602-1fhq6.html | title=Ex gratia payment for wrongly jailed man  | accessdate=2011-06-02 | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 June 2011, Beamish was granted a A$425,000 ''[[ex gratia]]'' payment by the Western Australian government.&lt;ref name="news.smh.com.au"/&gt;

==Media==
[[Walkley Award]]-winning journalist [[Estelle Blackburn]] spent six years writing the biographical story ''[[Broken Lives]]'', about Cooke's life and criminal career, focusing particularly on the devastation left on his victims and their families.  New information on Cooke and fresh evidence published in the book led to the exonerations of Button and Beamish.

In [[Randolph Stow]]'s final novel, ''The Suburbs of Hell'' (1984), he acknowledged that there was a delayed response to the horror of Cooke's murders, which he transposed for fictional purposes from his WA origins to a town resembling the English town he then inhabited, [[Harwich]]. [[Suzanne Falkiner]]'s biography of Stow revealed that it piqued his sense of humour that Perth denizens at the time of the murders would knock on doors and say 'It's the Nedlands Monster'.

A 2000 memoir by [[Robert Drewe]], ''The Shark Net''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drewe|first1=Robert|title=The Shark Net|date=2003|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=9780143002154|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=nwED-0RoV58C&amp;printsec=frontcover|accessdate=17 March 2016|authorlink=Robert Drewe}}&lt;/ref&gt; – later made into a three-part television series – provided one author's impressions of the effect the murders had on the Perth of that era. According to Drewe, more people bought dogs for security, and locked back doors and garages that had never been secured before.

Eric Edgar Cooke, as "The Nedlands Monster", features in [[Tim Winton]]'s 1991 novel ''[[Cloudstreet]]'' and the subsequent [[Cloudstreet (TV series)|2011 television adaptation]].

Cooke is referenced in [[Craig Silvey]]'s 2009 novel ''[[Jasper Jones]]''.

In March 2009, the second season of [[Crime Investigation Australia (TV series)|''Crime Investigation Australia'']] featured an episode about Eric Edgar Cooke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://channelnine.ninemsn.com.au/crimeinvestigationaustralia/episodes/ |title=Channel Nine Episodes, Crime Investigation Australia |accessdate=2009-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090307124128/http://channelnine.ninemsn.com.au/crimeinvestigationaustralia/episodes/ |archivedate=7 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estefania Cortes-Vargas''' (born 1991) is a [[Colombian Canadians|Colombian-born Canadian]] politician who was elected in the [[Alberta general election, 2015]] to the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta]], representing the [[electoral district]] of [[Strathcona-Sherwood Park]] as a member of the [[Alberta New Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalnews.ca/news/1970421/alberta-election-2015-strathcona-sherwood-park-riding/ "Alberta Election 2015: NDP’s Estefania Cortes-Vargas wins Strathcona-Sherwood Park riding"].

[[File:Farrier tools.jpg|thumb|Some farrier [[tool]]s, including hammers,  nippers, rasps, and hoof knife, a set of custom-made corrective shoes are shown below the toolset]]
A '''farrier''' is a specialist in [[equine]] hoof care, including the trimming and balancing of [[horse|horses']] [[horse hoof|hooves]] and the placing of [[horseshoe|shoes]] on their hooves, if necessary.  A farrier combines some [[blacksmith]]'s skills (fabricating, adapting, and adjusting metal shoes) with some [[veterinary medicine|veterinarian]]'s skills (knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of the lower limb) to care for horses' feet.

==History and ceremonial==
Historically, the jobs of farrier and [[blacksmith]] were practically synonymous, shown by the etymology of the word: ''farrier'' comes from [[Middle French]]: ''ferrier'' (blacksmith), from the [[Latin]] word ''ferrum'' ([[iron]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=farrier&amp;searchmode=none "Farrier"] at Etymonline.com&lt;/ref&gt; A farrier's work in [[colonial America]] or pre-[[Industrial Revolution]] Europe would have included [[horseshoe|shoeing horses]], as well as the fabrication and repair of tools, the forging of architectural pieces, and so on. Modern-day farriers usually specialize in horseshoeing, focusing their time and effort on the care of the horse's hoof. For this reason, farriers and blacksmiths are considered to be in separate, albeit related, trades.

In the British Army, the [[Household Cavalry]] have [[Household Cavalry#Army Farriers|farriers]] who march in parade in ceremonial dress, carrying their historical axes with spikes. They are a familiar sight at the annual [[Trooping the Colour]].  There is also a farrier on call "round the clock, twenty-four hours a day, at [[Hyde Park Barracks, London|Hyde Park Barracks]]".&lt;ref name="HC Farriers"&gt;[http://householdcavalry.info/horses.html#farrier Household Cavalry Info site, Farriers section].  Accessed 20 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the [[Worshipful Company of Farriers]] is one of the [[Livery Companies]] of the City of London. The Farriers, or horseshoe makers, organised in 1356. It received a [[Royal Charter]] of incorporation in 1571. Over the years, the Company has evolved from a trade association for horseshoe makers into an organisation for those devoted to equine welfare, including veterinary surgeons.

==Work==
A farrier's routine work is primarily hoof trimming and shoeing.&lt;ref name="PaviaGentry-Running2011"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Audrey Pavia|author2=Kate Gentry-Running|title=Horse Health and Nutrition For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Xy6FN7UBhgC&amp;pg=RA1-PT27|date=4 February 2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-05232-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ordinary cases, it is important to trim each hoof so it retains its proper orientation to the ground. If the animal has a heavy work load, works on abrasive footing, needs additional traction, or has pathological changes in the hoof, then shoes may be required.

Additional tasks for the farrier include dealing with injured or diseased hooves and application of special shoes for [[horse racing|racing]], training or "cosmetic" purposes.  Horses with certain diseases or injuries may need remedial procedures for their hooves, or need special shoes.

==Qualifications==
In countries such as the United Kingdom, it is illegal for people other than registered farriers to call themselves a farrier or to carry out any farriery work (in the UK this is under the Farriers (Registration) Act 1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=''Farriers (Registration) Act 1975 | url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1975/cukpga_19750035_en_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary aim of the Act is to "prevent and avoid suffering by and cruelty to horses arising from the shoeing of horses by unskilled persons".

However, in other countries, such as the United States, farriery is not regulated, no legal certification exists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehorse.com/articles/27897/finding-a-farrier|title=Finding a Farrier|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and qualifications can vary.  In the US, three organizations - the American Farrier's Association (AFA); the Guild of Professional Farriers (GPF); and the Brotherhood of Working Farriers (BWFA) maintain voluntary certification programs for farriers.  Of these, the AFA's program is the largest with approximately 2800 certified farriers.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}  Additionally, the AFA program has a reciprocity agreement with the Farrier Registration Council and the [[Worshipful Company of Farriers]] in the UK.

Within the certification programs offered by the AFA and the GPF, all farrier examinations are conducted by peer panels.  The farrier examinations for both organizations are designed so that qualified farriers may obtain a formal credential indicating they meet a meaningful standard of professional competence as determined by technical knowledge and practical skills examinations, length of field experience, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanfarriers.org |title=The American Farriers Association |publisher=Americanfarriers.org |date=2011-04-28 |accessdate=2013-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guildprofarriers.org/ Registration guidelines] for The Guild of Professional Farriers&lt;/ref&gt;   Farriers who have received a certificate of completion for attending a farrier school or course may represent themselves as having completed a particular course of study.  Sometimes, usually for purposes of brevity, they use the term "certified" in advertising.

Where professional registration exists, on either a compulsory or voluntary basis, there is often a requirement for [[continuing professional development]] activity to maintain a particular license or certification.  For instance, farriers voluntarily registered with the American Association of Professional Farriers (AAPF) require at least 16 hours of continuing education every year to maintain their accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://professionalfarriers.com/farrier_accreditation.php |title=Farrier Accreditation |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028172749/http://professionalfarriers.com/farrier_accreditation.php |archivedate=2016-10-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis Oliver Finch''' (1802–1862), was an English [[watercolour]] painter, and a member of [[Ancients (art group)|The Ancients]], the group of young artists formed around [[Samuel Palmer]] and the elderly 
[[William Blake]] in the 1820s.

==Life==
Finch was the son of Francis Finch, a merchant in Friday Street, [[Cheapside]], London, was born on 22 November 1802, and spent his boyhood at Stone, near [[Aylesbury]]. When twelve years of age, at that time 
fatherless, he was placed under [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]], with whom he worked altogether five years, a friend having paid a premium of £200. Among his earliest patrons was [[John Rushout, 2nd 
Baron Northwick|Lord Northwick]], a patron of the fine arts, who employed FInch in making views of his mansion and grounds. Some time after leaving his master's studio the same friend who had assisted in 
placing him there afforded him the benefit of a tour through Scotland.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

After his return he doubted for some time whether he should continue the  practice of landscape or enter as a student at the [[Royal Academy]]. He joined [[Henry Sass|Sass's life academy]] and produced several 
portraits, but circumstances drawing him back to landscape-painting he became a candidate for admission into the then newly formed [[Society of Painters in Water Colours]]. On 11 February 1822 he was elected an 
associate, and on 4 June 1827 a member of that society. He first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1817, at that period living at 44 Conduit Street, Bond Street. He married in the spring of 1837, and lived in Charlotte Street for some time, and later in Argyle Square, [[Euston Road]]. 

He possessed a fine voice, and was a talented musician, and  a poet. He printed a collection of sonnets entitled ''An Artist's Dream''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; 

==Works==
Among his best works may be counted ''Garmallon's Tomb'', (oil 1820); ''View of Loch Lomond'' (1822); ''View on the River Tay'' (1827); ''View of Windsor Castle'' (1829); ''View of the College of Aberdeen'' (1832); ''The Dell of [[Comus (John Milton)|Comus]]'' (1835); ''Alpine Scene, Evening'' (1838); ''A Watch Tower'' (1840); ''The Thames near Cookham, Berkshire'' (1845); ''Ruined Temple, Evening'' (1852); ''Rocky Glen, Evening'' (1855); ''The Curfew - Gray's Elegy'' (1860); ''Pastoral Retreat'' (1861); and ''Moonlight over the Sea'' (1862). His portrait was engraved by A. Roffe.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;{{DNB|wstitle=Finch, Francis Oliver|last=Fagan|first=Louis Alexander|volume=19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On 10 October 1861 Finch lost the use of his limbs, and died 27 August 1862.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

'''Frank Lenz''' (probably died May 1894) was an American bicyclist and adventurer who disappeared somewhere near [[Erzurum]], [[Turkey]] in May 1894, during an attempt to [[Circumnavigation|circle the globe]] by [[bicycle]].

==Early life==
Frank Lenz was born in 1867 in [[Philadelphia]] to Adam Reinhart and Anna Maria Reinhart, born Schritz, immigrants from [[Malsch]], [[Germany]]. His father died while Frank was still a child, and Anna Maria moved to [[Pittsburgh]]. When Frank was six years old his mother married William Lenz, another German immigrant.

At the age of 17, Lenz took up cycling, joining the Allegheny Cycle Club, and started exploring the roads of [[Pennsylvania]]. He soon went on longer trips, riding his bike as far as [[New York City|New York]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[New Orleans]] and [[Chicago]]. He was also an avid photographer, who would bring his camera on his biking trips.

==Journey around the world==
The Englishman [[Thomas Stevens (cyclist)|Thomas Stevens]] had completed the first circumnavigation of the globe by bicycle in 1887, and Lenz wanted to make an attempt of his own. He was hired by the magazine Outing (for which Stevens had worked) to publish reports and take photographs from his journey, and set out from the [[Smithfield Street Bridge]] in Pittsburgh on a Victory safety bicycle on May 15, 1892 with 800 onlookers wishing him well.[http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/neighborhoods-city/a-lens-on-lenz-on-the-south-side-635673/]

Going first to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington D.C.]] and New York he then traveled west across the [[United States]] and parts of [[Canada]], reaching [[San Francisco]] on October 20.

From San Francisco he sailed to Japan, where he rode from [[Yokohama]] to [[Nagasaki]] before crossing to [[China]]. While he seems to have had a pleasant trip through Japan, which he praised in his reports, China proved a tougher stage of his journey.  Japan had good roads for the time but the roads in China were in poor condition, especially in winter, and the locals were often hostile or fearful. He had expected to cross China in three months, but it took him six, and he was very happy when he reached [[British Burma|Burma]], part of the British Empire.

The jungles of Burma proved another difficult obstacle, with heavy rain and almost impassable roads, and he also contracted malaria there. Reaching [[Rangoon]] he found it impossible to ride his bike the next stage of his journey, and instead crossed by ship to [[Calcutta]]. In early October 1893 he left [[Calcutta]], and spent the next month crossing to [[Lahore]].

From Lahore he decided to travel south to [[Karachi]], and then traveled by steamer to [[Bushire]] in Persia, riding north to [[Teheran]] from there. He found Teheran a delightful place, and was loath to leave, but set out for [[Tabriz]] in April 1894, hoping to reach [[Istanbul]] before the worst of the summer heat.

In early May, 1894, almost two years after his departure from Pittsburgh, he set off from Tabriz on the next stage of his journey, with [[Erzurum]] as his next objective. He was never heard from again.

==Search==
When nothing was heard from Lenz throughout the summer, his family started to worry that something might have happened. The Ottoman Empire was at this time going through a period of turmoil, the ongoing [[Hamidian massacres|Hamidian Massacres]] were killing tens of thousands of Armenians. It was difficult to ascertain what might have happened, but [[Alexander Terrell]], the U.S. minister to Turkey, felt sure that Lenz had been killed by Kurdish bandits.

''Outing Magazine'' eventually sent another famous bicyclist, [[William Sachtleben]], to Turkey to investigate the circumstances of Lenz' disappearance. Sachtleben had completed his own bike journey around the world in 1892, along with his friend Thomas Allen. He sailed to Europe in March 1895, and traveled to Erzurum, having to forge papers to gain entrance to [[Kurdistan]].

In Erzurum, Sachtleben learned that Lenz had somehow insulted a notorious Kurdish chief when passing through a small village. The Kurds then apparently ambushed and killed him, burying his body on the bank of a river.

The Kurdish bandit was charged and convicted by the Turkish authorities, but had already fled. Some of the Armenian locals who had helped Sachtleben uncover Lenz' fate were also imprisoned, a couple of them dying in prison. Eventually, some eight years after his death, following pressure from the U.S., the Turkish government agreed to pay a compensation of $7,500 to Lenz' mother.

'''Frank Warren Snepp''' (born May 3, 1943)&lt;ref name=ency/&gt; is a journalist and former chief analyst of North Vietnamese strategy for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) in [[Saigon]] during the [[Vietnam War]]. For five out of his eight years as a CIA officer, he worked as interrogator, agent debriefer, and chief strategy analyst in the [[United States Embassy, Saigon]]; he was awarded the [[Intelligence Medal of Merit]] for his work.&lt;ref name=ency/&gt; Snepp is currently a producer for [[KNBC-TV]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. He was one of the first [[whistle blowers]] who revealed the inner workings, secrets and failures of the [[secret service|national security services]] in the 1970s. As a result of a loss in a 1980 court case brought by the CIA, all of Snepp's publications require prior approval by the CIA.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=November 2015}}

==Background==
Born in [[Kinston, North Carolina]],&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz&gt;Ted Rabinowitz, [http://www.college.columbia.edu/cct/fall13/alumni_profiles1 Frank Snepp ’65, ’68 SIPA Chases the Truth From Saigon to Los Angeles], ''Columbia College Today'', Fall 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Snepp studied Elizabethan literature at [[Columbia University]], graduating in 1965.&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz/&gt; After spending a year at [[CBS News]], he returned to Columbia's [[School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University|School of International and Public Affairs]], graduating in 1968.&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz/&gt;

==Career==

===CIA (1968 - 1976)===
Snepp was recruited to the CIA in 1968, by the Associate Dean of the [[School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University]], Philip Mosely.&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz/&gt; Initially working on [[NATO]] and European security, he was sent to [[Saigon]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=ency&gt;Glenn P. Hastedt (2011), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=91FyAJDjAvQC&amp;pg=PA711 Spies, Wiretaps, and Secret Operations: A-J], [[ABC-CLIO]], p711-2&lt;/ref&gt; Here Snepp worked as an analyst and counter-intelligence officer, coordinating agent networks and interrogation of captured enemy forces as well as preparing strategic estimates regarding the enemy.&lt;ref name=ency/&gt; Snepp rejected the usual 2-year rotation, and stayed in Vietnam until the US was forced out in 1975.&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz/&gt; Snepp wrote in 2009 that he was "still haunted" by the "[[psychological manipulation]] and torment of a prisoner" he was involved with as a CIA interrogator.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Snepp, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', 27 April 2009, [http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/27/opinion/oe-snepp27 Tortured by the past]&lt;/ref&gt;

Snepp was on hand for the [[Fall of Saigon]] and was one of the last Americans to leave the [[US Embassy, Saigon]] before the city fell to the North Vietnamese on April 30, 1975.&lt;ref name=ency/&gt;  Snepp was evacuated with other American personnel in [[Operation Frequent Wind]]. On his return to the US Snepp was awarded the [[Intelligence Medal of Merit]] in December 1975, but he resigned from the Agency in January 1976, upset at its refusal to rescue Vietnamese left behind in the pull-out, and its refusal to acknowledge mistakes made.&lt;ref name=ency/&gt;&lt;ref name=onsnepp/&gt;

===Memoir===
Snepp wrote a memoir of the event, ''Decent Interval'', published in 1977 without prior approval from the CIA Publications Review Board.&lt;ref name=ency/&gt; The book was based on an after-action report that he had written and which he had sent through CIA channels. The report was not accepted.&lt;ref name=McGory/&gt;

After the book was published, CIA Director [[Stansfield Turner]] pushed for Snepp to be sued and, despite the objections of some [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] officials, Turner prevailed. Since publication of the book could not be stopped under the constitutional law forbidding [[prior restraint]] of the press, the CIA sued Snepp for [[breach of contract]]. Snepp was accused of violating the [[non-disclosure agreement]] he had signed when he joined the agency that forbade publication of any material about CIA operations without the prior consent of the agency.&lt;ref name=McGory&gt;{{cite journal|last=McGory|first=Mary|title=Whistle Blower Under Fire|journal=Boca Raton News|date=7 March 1978|pages=4|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1291&amp;dat=19780307&amp;id=cZgzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=GI0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3410,1237679}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, President [[Jimmy Carter]] permitted the lawsuit against Snepp at the same time he had proposed the creation of a special unit to provide protection for civil service whistle blowers. In a press conference, Carter said that Snepp did not qualify as a whistleblower as he did not "reveal anything that would lead to an improvement in our security apparatus or the protection of Americans' civil rights." Carter also claimed that Snepp had "revealed our nation's utmost secrets", even though he had not been charged with violating any security laws like the [[Espionage Act]].&lt;ref name=McGory/&gt;

Snepp accused the CIA of ruining his career and violating his [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] free speech rights. The CIA in return claimed that Snepp had violated his employment agreement by speaking out. They sued (''United States v. Frank W. Snepp III''). He enlisted the help of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] in his defense. In the end, the CIA won a court verdict against Snepp, with the US Supreme Court ruling that Snepp's book had caused "irreparable harm" to national security due to creating an appearance of a breakdown of discipline in the CIA.&lt;ref name=ency/&gt; The royalties from ''Decent Interval'' (amounting to $300,000 by the time Snepp lost in front of the Supreme Court&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz/&gt;) were surrendered to the CIA, and Snepp forced to clear all future publications with the CIA.&lt;ref name=ency/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;Frank Snepp, ''[[CNN]]'', 3 July 2013, [http://edition.cnn.com/2013/07/03/opinion/snepp-journalists-espionage/index.html?hpt=us_mid Snowden and a muzzled free press]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Snepp published a second book, ''Irreparable Harm'', about his court battle with the CIA.&lt;ref name=ency/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[James Bamford]], ''[[New York Times]]'', July 18, 1999, [https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/07/18/reviews/990718.18bamfort.html Spy vs. Spies]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Journalism (1980 - present)===
In 1980, following the Supreme Court decision against him, Snepp became an investigative journalist, contributing to publications including the ''[[New York Times]]'', the ''[[Washington Post]]'', the ''[[Village Voice]]'' and others.&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz/&gt; Snepp also worked in television, including for ABC's ''[[ABC World News|World News Tonight]]'' (1987–92), CBS (2003–05) and NBC from 2005.&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz/&gt; At ''[[ABC World News|World News Tonight]]'' he got [[Eugene Hasenfus]] to confirm that he had signed a government secrecy agreement, confirming the government's involvement in the [[Iran-Contra affair]].&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz/&gt;

Snepp won an [[Emmy Award]] in 1997 for an investigation into Mexican drug trafficking. He won a [[Peabody Award]] in 2006 as producer on an investigation for [[KNBC-TV]]-Los Angeles of a Los Angeles housing development sited on a toxic landfill.&lt;ref name=Rabinowitz/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[KNBC-TV]]-Los Angeles, 11 April 2006, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070927015049/http://www.knbc.com/station/8506056/detail.html KNBC Wins Peabody Award For 'Burning Questions']&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1980s, he taught a Journalism and the Law course at California State University, Long Beach.

He was a technical consultant for the comedy film ''[[Spies Like Us]]''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060828073653/http://www.franksnepp.com/bio.htm]

He was interviewed in [[Ken Burns]]'s series ''[[The Vietnam War (TV series)|The Vietnam War]]''.

He was interviewed in "Vietnam: The Ten Thousand Day War", produced in 1980 by Michael Maclear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11283">[[File:1311 - 1317 22nd Street, NW.JPG|thumb|Former residence (red) of Frank Wills, located in the [[Dupont Circle, Washington, D.C.|Dupont Circle]] neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
'''Frank Wills''' (February 4, 1948 &amp;ndash; September 27, 2000) was an American security guard best known for his role in foiling the June 17, 1972 break-in at the [[Democratic National Committee]] inside the [[Watergate complex]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] Then 24, Wills called the police after discovering that locks at the complex had been tampered with. Five men were arrested inside the Democratic headquarters, which they had planned to [[Covert listening device|bug]]. The arrests triggered the [[Watergate scandal]] and eventually the resignation of President [[Richard Nixon|Richard M. Nixon]] in 1974.

Hailed as a hero, Wills later struggled with his celebrity and had difficulty keeping a job. He played himself in the 1976 film ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]]''.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/29/us/frank-wills-52-watchman-foiled-watergate-break-in.html | title=Frank Wills, 52; Watchman Foiled Watergate Break-In | newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=September 29, 2000 | accessdate=July 10, 2012 | author=Clymer, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wills, an African American, was born in [[Savannah, Georgia]].  His parents [[Legal separation|separated]] when he was a child and he was primarily raised by his mother, Margie.&lt;ref name=hero&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank WIlls - The Hero of Watergate - History|url=http://www.spybusters.com/History_1972_Frank_WIlls.html|access-date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After dropping out of [[Secondary education in the United States|high school]] in 11th grade, Wills studied heavy machine operations in [[Battle Creek, Michigan]]&lt;ref name="Booker"&gt;{{cite web|last=Booker|first=Simeon|title=Untold Story of Black Hero of Watergate|url=http://www.itsabouttimebpp.com/underground_news/pdf/Untold_Story_Frank_Willis.pdf|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and earned his [[General Educational Development|equivalency degree]] from the [[Job Corps]].&lt;ref name=oshea/&gt; He found an assembly-line job working for [[Ford]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. He later had to give up his assembly-line job due to health issues, namely asthma. Wills then traveled to Washington, D.C. and worked at a few hotels before landing a job as a security guard at the Watergate hotel.&lt;ref name="Booker"/&gt;

==Watergate hotel==

{{Further|Watergate scandal#Wiretapping of the Democratic Party's headquarters}}
In June 1972, Wills, at the age of 24, was working as a private security guard at the [[Watergate Hotel|Watergate office building]] on the shores of the [[Potomac River]].&lt;ref name="Booker"/&gt; This was the location of the [[Democratic National Committee]] (DNC) headquarters. In the one year that Wills had worked there, there had been only one attempted burglary. In fact, it was considered so safe that security officers in the building only carried around a can of mace.&lt;ref name="Booker"/&gt;

On the night of June 17,&lt;ref name="Watergate.info"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.watergate.info/burglary/wills-security-log.shtml | title = Frank Wills’ Watergate Security Log | publisher = Watergate.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wills noticed a piece of [[duct tape]] on one of the door locks when he was making his first round.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; The tape was placed over the latch bolt to prevent the door from latching shut. He removed the tape and continued on his patrol. Thirty minutes later, Wills returned to the door and noticed there was more tape on the same door. Without hesitation, Wills rushed up to the lobby telephone and asked for the Second Precinct police.&lt;ref name="Booker"/&gt; The police turned off the elevators and locked the doors while accompanying Wills to search the offices one by one. Five men were found in the DNC offices. Wills recalled in 1997, "When we turned the lights on, one person, then two persons, then three persons came out, and on down the line."&lt;ref name="TimeRetrospective"&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942983-1,00.html | title = Watergate retrospective: the decline and fall|work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date = August 19, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Details that emerged during their questioning and trials triggered the [[Watergate scandal]]. The five men arrested were [[Bernard L. Barker]], [[Virgilio Gonzalez]], [[Eugenio Martinez]], [[James W. McCord Jr.]], and [[Frank Sturgis]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | video1 = [https://www.wnyc.org/story/nixon-resigns-and-someone-wrote-a-song/ The Ballad of a Watergate Security Guard], 2:32, sung by the [[Frederick Douglass Kirkpatrick|Reverend Douglas Kirkpatrick]],  [[WNYC]]&lt;ref name="wnyc"&gt;{{cite web | title =The Ballad of a Watergate Security Guard | work = | publisher =[[WNYC]] | date = | url =http://www.wnyc.org/story/nixon-resigns-and-someone-wrote-a-song/ | accessdate =January 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

One story reports that after the Watergate break-in, he received a raise of $2.50&lt;ref name=oshea/&gt; above his previous $80 per week.  Another story states he wanted, but did not receive, a promotion for discovering the burglary.&lt;ref name=AARegistry&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/frank-wills-truth-will-set-you-free | title = Frank Wills, the truth will set you free! | publisher = African American Registry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The New York Times'', Wills quit his job because he did not receive a raise. He then struggled staying employed because media opportunities and appearances kept him away from work, most of which consisted of minimum wage jobs.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; 

Wills played himself in the 1976 film  ''[[All the President's Men (film)|All the President's Men]].''  The book and film were based on  [[Bob Woodward]] and [[Carl Bernstein]]'s 1974 [[All the President's Men|book]] accounting their investigation into the Watergate scandal. Wills also appeared briefly on the talk show circuit.&lt;ref name=AARegistry/&gt;

Wills' log entry made on June 17, 1972 at 1:47&amp;nbsp;a.m. is memorialized in the [[nara:304970|National Archives]].

==Later life and poverty==
Over the next 20 years, Wills struggled to establish and maintain roots and stability while suffering bouts of unemployment.  He shuttled between [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and other southern cities, with some time spent in the Bahamas.&lt;ref name=AARegistry/&gt; He said in an interview that [[Howard University]] feared losing their federal funding if they hired him. A security job with [[Georgetown University]] did not last long.&lt;ref name=oshea/&gt; Also, he worked in a failed stint as a diet food spokesperson for the comedian [[Dick Gregory]].&lt;ref name=AARegistry/&gt;

In the mid-1970s,&lt;ref name=AARegistry/&gt; Wills finally settled in [[North Augusta, South Carolina]], to care for his aging mother, who had suffered a stroke.  Together, they survived on her $450 per month [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] checks.&lt;ref name=oshea&gt;{{cite news | last = O'Shea | first = Margaret N. |date = 30 September 2000 | url = http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/2000/09/30/met_298668.shtml | title = Watergate guard led quiet life | work = [[The Augusta Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Wills was convicted of [[shoplifting]] and fined $20.&lt;ref name="Jet; March 7, 1983"&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Wills Appeals One Year Shoplifting Sentence |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kLYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |journal=Jet |location=Chicago |publisher=Johnson Publishing Co. Inc. |volume=63 |issue=25 |page=6 |issn=0021-5996 |date=March 7, 1983 |access-date=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, he was convicted of shoplifting a pair of sneakers from a store in [[Augusta, Georgia]] and sentenced to one year in prison.&lt;ref name="Jet; March 7, 1983"/&gt; By the time of his mother's death in 1993,&lt;ref name=AARegistry/&gt; Wills was so destitute that he had to donate her body to medical research because he had no money with which to bury her.&lt;ref name=oshea/&gt;

Only when significant anniversaries of the Watergate break-in occurred did the waning spotlight reach out towards him again. In 1992, on the 20th anniversary of the burglary of the DNC headquarters, reporters asked if he were given the chance to do it all over again, would he? Wills replied with annoyance, "That's like asking me if I'd rather be white than black. It was just a part of destiny."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woo|first=Elaine|title=Frank Wills; Guard Discovered Watergate Break-In|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/sep/29/local/me-28706/2|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Wills told a ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reporter, "I put my life on the line. I went out of my way.... If it wasn't for me, Woodward and Bernstein would not have known anything about Watergate. This wasn't finding a dollar under a couch somewhere."&lt;ref name="The Washington Post; September 20, 2000"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bernstein |first=Adam |date=September 20, 2000 |title=Frank Wills; Detected Watergate Break-In |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/18/AR2009061802602.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |access-date=October 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wills was quoted saying, "Everybody tells me I'm some kind of hero, but I certainly don't have any hard evidence. I did what I was hired to do but still I feel a lot of folk don't want to give me credit, that is, a chance to move upward in my job".&lt;ref name="Booker"/&gt;

Otherwise, Wills tended his garden, made the local library his study, and led a quiet life with his cats.&lt;ref name=oshea/&gt; Frank Wills died at the [[Medical College of Georgia]] hospital in [[Augusta, Georgia]] at the age of 52 from a brain tumor.&lt;ref name=hero/&gt;

==Recognition==
Frank Wills was honored by the [[NAACP]].  The civil rights organization presented him with a truck.&lt;ref name=oshea/&gt;

Musician [[Harry Nilsson]] dedicated his 1973 album, ''[[A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night]]'', to Wills, for his role in bringing down [[Nixon]].&lt;ref name=oshea/&gt;

The Democratic National Committee gave Wills an award, and the chairman said he had played "a unique role in the history of the nation."&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; 

According to Wills' obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the "most eloquent description of his role" in American history came on July 29, 1974; Rep. [[James Mann (South Carolina politician)|James Mann]] (D-South Carolina), while casting his vote to impeach Nixon on the House Judiciary Committee, said, "If there is no accountability, another president will feel free to do as he chooses. But the next time there may be no watchman in the night."&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

In 1959, when Schaller was only 26, he traveled to Central Africa to study and live with the [[gorilla|mountain gorilla]]s (''Gorilla beringei beringei'') of the [[Virunga Volcanoes]].&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Natgeo"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/best-of-adventure-2007/wildlife/george-schaller-leopards-lions-pandas.html|title=Biologist George Schaller's 50-Year Battle|accessdate=October 5, 2007|publisher=National Geographic|year=2007|author=Ryan Bradley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cic"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://school.discoveryeducation.com/ontv/championsofthewild_1006.html |title=Mountain Gorillas |accessdate=October 5, 2007 |publisher=[[Animal Planet]] |year=2006 |author=[[Cable in the Classroom]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507072314/http://school.discoveryeducation.com/ontv/championsofthewild_1006.html |archivedate=May 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little was known about the life of gorillas in the wild until the publication of ''The Mountain Gorilla: Ecology and Behavior'' in 1963, that first conveyed to the general public just how profoundly intelligent and gentle gorillas really are, contrary to then-common beliefs. Schaller also, in 1964, recounted this epic two-year study in ''The Year of the Gorilla'', which also provides a broader historical perspective on the efforts to save one of humankind's nearest relatives from the brink of extinction.&lt;ref name="Natgeo" /&gt;

The American zoologist [[Dian Fossey]], with assistance from the [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] society and [[Louis Leakey]], followed Schaller's ground-breaking field research on mountain gorillas in the Virungas.&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt; Schaller and Fossey were instrumental in dispelling the public perception of gorillas as brutes, by demonstrably establishing the deep compassion and social intelligence evident among gorillas, and how very closely their behavior parallels that of humans.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;

==Conservation career==

In 1966, Schaller and  his wife traveled to [[Tanzania]] to live in the [[Serengeti]], and Schaller conducted one of the first studies of social behavior and movement of Africa's big cats.&lt;ref name="uofa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Natgeo" /&gt;

In his 1972 work ''The Tree Where Man Was Born'', author [[Peter Matthiessen]] described Schaller as "single-minded, not easy to know". Matthiessen went on to say Schaller was "a stern pragmatist" who "takes a hard-eyed look at almost everything", "lean and intent", and in 1978's ''The Snow Leopard'' Matthiessen wrote that by that time, some considered Schaller the world's finest field biologist.&lt;ref name="msu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="man" /&gt;&lt;ref name="matt"&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthiessen, Peter |title=The Snow Leopard (Penguin Nature Classics) |publisher=Penguin Books |location=New York |year=1978 |isbn=0-14-025508-7 |oclc= |doi= |page=352 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1973, Schaller went to the remote [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region, {{convert|250|mi|km}} inside [[Dolpo]], an area of [[Nepal]] occupied by people of the [[Tibet]]an culture and ethnicity.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt; Schaller was there to study the Himalayan [[Bharal]], (blue sheep), and possibly glimpse the elusive [[snow leopard]], an animal rarely spotted in the wild. Schaller is one of only two Westerners known to have seen a snow leopard in Nepal between 1950 and 1978. Accompanying him on the trip was Matthiessen, and as a result of the trip, Matthiessen wrote ''The Snow Leopard'', (1978) detailing the accounts of their travels and research, which won two U.S. [[National Book Awards]].&lt;ref name="winners"&gt;1979 Contemporary Thought and 1980 General Nonfiction (paperback). There were more than 30 awards for paperback books, 1980 to 1983 only, and ''The Snow Leopard'' was the only double winner. &lt;!-- source is manual count and inspection --&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[http://www.nationalbook.org/nbawinners_category.html "National Book Award Winners: 1950–2009"] {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/67pS92ifX?url=http://www.nationalbook.org/nbawinners_category.html# |date=2012-05-21 }}. National Book Foundation: Awards. Retrieved January 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Schaller is referred to throughout the book as "GS".&lt;ref name="matt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="matthiessen"&gt;{{cite book |author=Matthiessen, Peter |title=The Snow Leopard |publisher=Viking Press |location=New York |year=1978 |isbn=0-670-65374-8 |oclc= |doi= |page=338 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1970s, Schaller spent time in Brazil studying the [[jaguar]], [[capybara]], "alligator"([[caiman]]), and other animals of the region.&lt;ref name="icp" /&gt;

In 1988, Schaller and his wife traveled to China's [[Tibetan Plateau|Chang Tang]] (Qian Tang) region to study the [[giant panda]], and became the first westerners permitted to enter the remote region.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book |author=Schaller, George B. |title=Tibet's Hidden Wilderness: Wildlife and Nomads of the Chang Tang Reserve |publisher=Harry N. Abrams |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=0-8109-3893-6 |oclc= |doi= |page=168 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schaller sought to refute the notion that the panda population was declining due to natural [[bamboo]] die-offs.&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="icp" /&gt; Instead, Schaller found the panda's popularity was leading to its frequent capture, and was the biggest threat to the population. Schaller also found evidence that pandas were originally [[carnivore]]s, but underwent an evolutionary change to accommodate a diet of [[bamboo]], which is difficult to digest, reducing competition with other animals for food.&lt;ref name="icp" /&gt;  Since Schaller's research, the panda population has increased in the wild by 45 percent.&lt;ref name="Natgeo" /&gt; During his time in China, Schaller would hand out cards to wildlife hunters that read: "All beings tremble at punishment, to all, life is dear. Comparing others to oneself, one should neither kill nor cause to kill."&lt;ref name="Natgeo" /&gt; Schaller has spent more time in China than he has spent at his home in Connecticut.&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt;

In 1994, Schaller and Dr. [[Alan Rabinowitz]] were the first scientists to uncover the rare [[saola]], a [[forest]]-dwelling [[bovine]] in [[Laos]]. Later that year, Schaller rediscovered the Vietnamese [[Indo-chinese warty pig|warty pig]], once thought extinct. In 1996, he located a herd of [[Tibetan red deer]], also thought extinct.&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Natgeo" /&gt;

In 2003, Schaller returned to Chang Tang, and found the wildlife in the area had rebounded since his first trip to the region.&lt;ref name="wcs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="china"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.china-embassy.org/eng/zt/mgryzdzg/t36537.htm|title= American Biologist Praises Tibetan Wildlife Conservation|accessdate=October 19, 2007|publisher=Chinese [[Embassy]]|year=2003|author=Chinese Embassy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="npr"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7316356|title=A Resurgence of Wildlife in Northern Tibet|accessdate=October 19, 2007|publisher=National Public Radio|year=2007|author=Alex Chadwick}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most significantly, the wild [[yak]] population, which was estimated at only 13 individuals, had grown to over 187.&lt;ref name="china" /&gt; "The Tibet Forestry Department has obviously made a dedicated and successful effort in protecting the wildlife." Schaller wrote in a letter to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|World Wildlife Fund]]'s Dawa Cering.&lt;ref name="china" /&gt; While in Tibet, Schaller worked on researching the rare Tibetan [[antelope]], or chiru, whose population declined due to [[trophy hunting]] for their exotic wool.&lt;ref name="lcaof"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lcaof.org/new.html|title=Current Reports: Observations from a Recent Field Report|accessdate=October 20, 2007|publisher=Liz Claiborne and Art Ortenberg Foundation|author1=George B.

In 2007, Schaller worked with [[Pakistan]], [[Afghanistan]], [[Tajikistan]], and China to develop a new "Peace Park", that would protect {{convert|20000|mi|km}} of habitat for the largest wild sheep species, the [[Marco Polo sheep]].&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hindutwo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Natgeo" /&gt; In danger due to their impressive spiral horns, which can measure up to {{convert|6|ft|m}} in length, the sheep is sought out as a trophy by international hunters.&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt; Schaller's research in the [[Pamir Mountains]] will play an important role in the park's creation.&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hindutwo" /&gt;

==Conservation results==

Schaller's work in conservation has resulted in the protection of large stretches of area in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]], [[Brazil]], the [[Hindu Kush]] in Pakistan, and forests in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="newsci"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg12617184.500.html|title=On the Trail of the Snow Leopard|accessdate=October 19, 2007|publisher=[[New Scientist]] – Reed Business Information Ltd|year=1990|author=Christopher Joyce}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due in part to Schaller's work, over 20 parks or preserves worldwide have been established, including [[Alaska]]'s [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] (ANWR), the Shey-Phoksundo National Park in Nepal, and the [[Changtang Nature Reserve]], one of the world's most significant wildlife refuges.&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt;&lt;ref name="man" /&gt;&lt;ref name="interview" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wcs"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wcs.org/353624/192525|title=WCS Biologist George Schaller Reports Surprising Increase of Wildlife in Tibet|accessdate=October 19, 2007|publisher=Wildlife Conservation Society|year=2007|author=Wildlife Conservation Society |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811015711/http://wcs.org/353624/192525 |archivedate = August 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At over {{convert|200000|mi|km}},&lt;ref name="npr" /&gt; the Chang Tang Nature Reserve is triple the size of America's largest wildlife refuge, and was called "One of the most ambitious attempts to arrest the shrinkage of natural ecosystems," by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="cas"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.calacademy.org/geninfo/newsroom/releases/2000/schaller0100.html|title=A Conversation with Dr. George Schaller|accessdate=October 5, 2007|publisher=[[California Academy of Sciences]]|year=2000|author=[[California Academy of Sciences]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912105719/http://www.calacademy.org/geninfo/newsroom/releases/2000/schaller0100.html|archivedate=September 12, 2005|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bigfoot research==
Schaller is one of a few prominent scientists who argue that [[Bigfoot]] reports are worthy of serious study. A 2003 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' story described Schaller as a "Bigfoot [[skeptic]]", but he also expressed disapproval for other scientists who do not examine evidence, yet "write [Bigfoot] off as a [[hoax]] or [[mythology|myth]]. I don't think that's fair."&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;{{cite news | last =Bailey | first =Eric  | title =Bigfoot's Big Feat: New Life; A prankster's deeds revealed posthumously appeared to doom the legend. | work = | pages =section A.1 | publisher =The Los Angeles Times | date =April 19, 2003 | url =https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/325851481.html?dids=325851481:325851481&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+19%2C+2003&amp;author=Eric+Bailey&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=The+State%3B+COLUMN+ONE%3B+Bigfoot%27s+Big+Feat%3A+New+Life%3B+A+prankster%27s+deeds+revealed+posthumously+appeared+to+doom+the+legend.+But+Sasquatch+still+looms+large%2C+and+scientists+are+intrigued. | accessdate =2007-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bfro2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bfro.net/GDB/show_article.asp?id=332|title=Bigfoot's Big Feat: New Life|accessdate=October 5, 2007|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|year=2003|author=Eric Bailey|work=archived by BRFO}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2003 ''[[The Denver Post|Denver Post]]'' article Schaller said that he is troubled that no Bigfoot remains have ever been uncovered, and no feces samples have been found to allow DNA testing.

'''Georgiana Carolina Dashwood''' (1796–1835) was the daughter of [[Sir Henry Dashwood, 3rd Baronet|Sir Henry Dashwood]], MP. 

She married [[Jacob Astley, 16th Baron Hastings|Sir Jacob Astley, Bt]] in 1819 and had two sons. In 24th June 1829, she eloped with Captain Thomas Garth of the 15th Hussars, the son of [[Thomas Garth (British Army officer)|General Thomas Garth]], an chief equerry to [[King George III]]. Her husband filed a divorce suit against her adultery. In the court, she accused her husband of having “improper familiarities and adultery with abandoned women”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=05I0AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA714&amp;lpg=PA714&amp;dq=georgiana+lady+astley&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yiHFgDF2EQ&amp;sig=SeuBG7dfDn7gmJoMYKNqFhCAT1U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjA996Q96vaAhUMYlAKHbmbCrwQ6AEIRTAK#v=onepage&amp;q=georgiana%20lady%20astley&amp;f=false| title= ''Reports of Cases Argued and Determined in the Ecclesiastical Courts at Doctors' Commons, and in the High Court of Delegates: Michaelmas term, 1827-Trinity term, 1828, and some cases of an earlier date in the supplement''}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It was later proved by the court and Lady Astley was dismissed from the suit. 

However, the couple did not reconcile and Lady Astley went to live with Captain Garth. In October 1830, Garth was committed for debt to the King’s Bench Prison, Southwark and Lady Astley lived with him there. In 1835, she gave birth to an illegitimate daughter, Georgiana&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nationaltrustcollections.org.uk/object/1276802| title= ''Georgiana Carolina Dashwood, Lady Hastings (1796 – 1835)}}'' &lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Hans Jonas''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|oʊ|n|æ|s}}; {{IPA-de|ˈjoːnas|lang}}; 10 May 1903&amp;nbsp;– 5 February 1993) was a [[Germany|German]]-born American Jewish philosopher, from 1955 to 1976 the Alvin Johnson Professor of Philosophy at the [[New School for Social Research]] in [[New York City]].

==Biography==

[[Image:Moenchengladbach Stolpersteine Mozartstrasse.jpg|thumb|In front of the house, two [[Stolpersteine]] were installed in 2008. The left one commemorates the philosopher's mother Rosa Jonas, murdered in Auschwitz in 1942.]]

Jonas was born in [[Mönchengladbach]], on 10 May 1903. He studied [[philosophy]] and [[theology]] at the [[University of Freiburg]], the [[University of Berlin]] and the [[University of Heidelberg]], and finally earned his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in 1928 from the [[University of Marburg]]&lt;ref name="W"&gt;H. Jonas, "''Wissenschaft'' as Personal Experience," ''The Hastings Center report'' 32:4 (Jul–Aug 2002), 30.&lt;/ref&gt; with a thesis on [[Gnosticism]] entitled ''Der Begriff der Gnosis'' (''The Concept of [[Gnosis]]'') and directed by [[Martin Heidegger]].&lt;ref&gt;Wellistony C. Viana, ''Das Prinzip Verantwortung von Hans Jonas aus der Perspektive des objektiven Idealismus der Intersubjektivität von Vittorio Hösle'', Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2010, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; During his study years his academic advisors included [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Rudolf Bultmann]].&lt;ref name="W"/&gt; In Marburg he met [[Hannah Arendt]], who was also pursuing her PhD there, and the two of them were to remain friends for the rest of their lives.

Heidegger joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1933, which may have disturbed Jonas, as he was Jewish and an active [[Zionist]].  Certainly, in 1964 Jonas would repudiate his mentor Heidegger, for his affiliation with the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/06/nyregion/hans-jonas-influential-philosopher-is-dead-at-89.html Hans Jonas, Influential Philosopher, Is Dead at 89], [[The New York Times]], Eric Pace, 6 February 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;
He left Germany for [[England]] in 1933, and from England he moved to Palestine in 1934. There he met [[Lore Weiner]], to whom he became betrothed. In 1940 he returned to Europe to join the [[British Army]] which had been arranging a special brigade for German Jews wanting to fight against [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] (See ''[[Jewish Brigade|The Jewish Brigade]]''). He was sent to [[Italy]], and in the last phase of the war moved into Germany. Thus, he kept his promise that he would return only as a soldier in the victorious army. In this time he wrote several letters to Lore about philosophy, in particular philosophy of biology, that would form the basis of his later publications on the subject. They finally married in 1943.

Immediately after the war he returned to Mönchengladbach to search for his mother but found that she had been sent to the gas chambers in the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]]. Having heard this, he refused to live in Germany again. He returned to Palestine and took part in Israel's [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|war of independence]] in 1948. Jonas taught briefly at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] before moving to North America. In 1950 he left for [[Canada]], teaching at [[Carleton University]]. From there he moved in 1955 to [[New York City]], where he was to live for the rest of his life. He was a fellow of the Hastings Center and Professor of Philosophy at [[New School for Social Research]] from 1955 to 1976 (where he was Alvin Johnson Professor). From 1982 to 1983 Jonas held the [[Eric Voegelin]] Visiting Professorship at the [[University of Munich]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=rEu61KIK6FYC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;lpg=PA167&amp;dq=voegelin+hans+jonas&amp;source=web&amp;ots=zU6iNo95S3&amp;sig=URhgwghOXKgP8Hbo0pK0H5LAo-I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ct=result#PPA168,M1 ''The Collected Works of Eric Voegelin: Selected Correspondence, 1950-1984''], University of Missouri Press, 2007, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; He died at his home in New Rochelle, New York, on 5 February 1993, aged 89.&lt;ref&gt;

==Works==

Jonas's writings were very influential in different spheres. For example, ''The Gnostic Religion'', based on his early research on the Gnosis and first published in 1958, was for many years the standard work in English on the subject of [[Gnosticism]]. ''The Imperative of Responsibility'' ([[German language|German]] 1979, [[English language|English]] 1984) centers on social and ethical problems created by [[technology]]. Jonas insists that human survival depends on our efforts to care for our planet and its future. He formulated a new and distinctive supreme principle of morality: "Act so that the effects of your action are compatible with the permanence of genuine human life".

While ''The Imperative of Responsibility'' has been credited with catalyzing the environmental movement in Germany, his work ''The Phenomenon of Life'' (1966) forms the philosophical undergirding of one major school of [[bioethics]] in America. [[Murray Bookchin]] and [[Leon Kass]] both referred to Hans Jonas's work as major, or primary, inspiration. Heavily influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]], ''The Phenomenon of Life'' attempts to synthesize the philosophy of matter with the philosophy of mind, producing a rich existential understanding of biology, which ultimately argues for a simultaneously material and moral human nature.

His writing on the history of [[Gnosticism]] revisits terrain covered by earlier standard works on the subject such as [[Ernesto Buonaiuti]]'s ''Lo gnosticismo: storia di antiche lotte religiose'' (1907), interpreting the religion from an [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosophical viewpoint. He was one of the first philosophers to concern himself with ethical questions in biological science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Harley Quinn''' (full name: '''Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel''') is a [[Character (arts)|fictional]] [[supervillain]]/[[antihero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[DC Comics]]. The character was created by [[Paul Dini]] and [[Bruce Timm]], and first appeared in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' in September 1992. She later appeared in DC Comics's [[Batman]] comic books, with the character's first comic book appearance in ''[[The Batman Adventures]]'' #12 (September 1993).

Harley Quinn is a frequent accomplice and lover of the [[Joker (character)|Joker]], whom she met while working as a [[psychiatrist]] at [[Gotham City]]'s [[Arkham Asylum]], where the Joker was a patient.&lt;ref name=Eury/&gt; Her name is a play on the name "[[Harlequin]]", a character which originated in the [[commedia dell'arte]]. The character has teamed up with fellow villains [[Catwoman]] and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] several times, the trio being known as the [[Gotham City Sirens]]. Poison Ivy is known to be a close friend and recurring ally of Harley, even being depicted as her girlfriend in recent comics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DC on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/DCComics/status/609463578303799296 |website=Twitter |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Harley Quinn #25 |date=2017 |publisher=DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="[3]"&gt;{{cite web |title=DC on Twitter |url=https://twitter.com/DCComics/status/609458213197606912 |website=Twitter |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[The New 52]], she is now depicted as an [[antihero]] and has left her past as a [[supervillain]] behind. However, she's still depicted as a supervillain at times. Harley Quinn has also been depicted as a member of the [[Suicide Squad]].

The character was originally voiced by [[Arleen Sorkin]] in the [[DC animated universe]]. Since then, she has also been voiced by [[Hynden Walch]] and [[Tara Strong]] in either [[DC Animated Showcase]]s or in various [[List of Batman video games|video games]]. In the [[Birds of Prey (TV series)|''Birds of Prey'' television series]], she was portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]]. The character made her live-action feature film debut in the 2016 film ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'', portrayed by [[Margot Robbie]].

==History==
===Creation===
====Introduction====
Harley Quinn first appeared in the [[DC Animated Universe]]'s ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "[[Joker's Favor]]",&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Joker's Favor|episodelink=Joker's Favor|series=Batman: The Animated Series|serieslink=Batman: The Animated Series|season=1|number=7|airdate=September 11, 1992|network=[[20th Century Fox|Fox]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; as what was originally supposed to be the animated equivalent of a [[bit part|walk-on]] role; a number of police officers were to be taken hostage by someone jumping out of a [[pop out cake]], and it was decided that to have the Joker do so himself would be too bizarre, although he ended up doing it anyway. Dini thus created a female sidekick for the Joker, who would become his love interest. [[Arleen Sorkin]], a former star of the soap opera ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', appeared in a dream sequence on that series in which she wore a [[jester]] costume; Dini used this scene as an inspiration for Quinn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first = Pat | last = Jankiewicz| title = Quinn-tessentials.

====Origin story====
[[File:Harley Quinn (model sheet).jpg|thumb|upright|Harley Quinn as she appears in the [[DC Animated Universe]]]]
The 1994 [[graphic novel]] ''[[The Batman Adventures: Mad Love]]'' recounts the character's [[origin story]]. Written and drawn by Dini and Timm, the comic book is told in the style and continuity of ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It describes Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, MD as an [[Arkham Asylum]] [[psychiatrist]] who falls in love with the Joker and becomes his accomplice and on-again, off-again girlfriend. The story received wide praise&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Hilary|last=Goldstein|url=http://comics.ign.com/articles/618/618636p1.html|title=The Batman Adventures: Mad Love Review|website=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[j2 Global]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 24, 2005|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and won the [[Eisner Award|Eisner]] and [[Harvey Award]]s for Best Single Issue Comic of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hahnlibrary.net/comics/awards/eisner94.php 1994|title=Will Eisner Comic Industry Award Nominees and Winners|journal=Comic Book Awards Almanac|publisher=The Hahn Library|date=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'' series adapted ''Mad Love'' as the episode of the same name in 1999. It was the second "animated style" comic book adapted for the series, with the other being "Holiday Knights".

Harleen Quinzel becomes fascinated with the Joker while working at Arkham Asylum and volunteers to help treat him. She falls hopelessly in love with the Joker during their sessions, and she helps him escape from the asylum more than once. When Batman returns a badly injured Joker to Arkham, she dons a jester costume to become Harley Quinn, the Joker's sidekick. The Joker frequently insults, ignores, hurts and even tries to kill Harley, but she always comes back to him, convinced that he truly loves her.

===Expanded role===
After ''Batman: The Animated Series'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Harley makes several other animated appearances. She appears as one of the four main female characters of the [[flash animation|web cartoon]] ''[[Gotham Girls]]''. She also made guest appearances in other cartoons within the [[DC animated universe]], appearing alongside the Joker in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' episode "Wild Cards" and alongside [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] in the ''[[Static Shock]]'' episode "Hard as Nails".

Harley Quinn appears in ''[[The Batman/Superman Movie|World's Finest: The Batman/Superman Movie]]'' (a compilation movie consisting of three-part ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' episode "World's Finest") as a rival and [[foil (literature)|foil]] for [[Lex Luthor]]'s assistant [[Mercy Graves]]; each takes an immediate dislike for the other, at one point fighting brutally with each other as Lex Luthor and the Joker have a business meeting. In the film's [[climax (narrative)|climax]], Harley ties Graves as a human shield to a combat robot set to confront [[Superman]] and [[Batman]], but Graves is rescued by the two heroes without suffering any harm.

The animated movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'' takes place in the future, long after the events in ''Batman: The Animated Series''. It includes a flashback scene in which Harley helps the Joker torture [[Tim Drake]] until he has become "Joker Jr.", an insane miniature version of the Clown Prince of Crime; she then falls down a deep pit during a battle with [[Batgirl]]. At the end of the movie, a pair of twin girls who model themselves on the Joker are released on bail to their grandmother, who angrily berates them—to which they answer: "Oh, shut up, Nana Harley!". Prior to this, her costume made several appearances in episodes in the future [[Batcave]].

==Characterization==
===Harleen Quinzel===
Dr. Harleen Frances Quinzel, PhD, is depicted as having been a psychiatrist (trained as a [[psychologist]])&lt;ref name=Eury&gt;Michael Eury (ed.), [https://books.google.com/books?id= ''Back Issue'' #99], TwoMorrows Publishing, 2017, p. 69, "Before she was Harley Quinn, she was the Joker's psychiatrist. ... ''Mad Love'' revealed that Harley Quinn was once Harleen Quinzel, winner of a gymnastics scholarship to Gotham State University. Pursuing a degree by romancing her way through her professors, Quinzel planned to become a pop psychologist until an internship at Arkham Asylum introduced her to the Joker."&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Gotham City]]'s [[Arkham Asylum]]. ''Gotham City Sirens'' #7 (Feb. 2010) shows Harley visiting her family for the holiday season, in which they are portrayed as being very dysfunctional. It is stated that the reason Harley pursued psychology was to understand her own broken family.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Paul Dini|Dini, Paul]]|penciller=Lopez, David|inker=March, Guillem|colorist=Morey, Tomeau|letterer=Wands, Steve|editor=DiDeo, Dan|story=Holiday Story| title=[[Gotham City Sirens]]|number=7|date=December 23, 2009 | publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]|ISBN=978-1-4012-2245-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character's origin story relates that Harleen Quinzel was once a psychiatrist at Arkham Asylum, and was assigned to treat the [[Joker (character)|Joker]]. She eventually falls in love with the Joker and becomes his lover and accomplice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Paul Dini|Dini, Paul]]|penciller=Murakami, Glenn|inker=[[Bruce Timm|Timm, Bruce]]|colorist=Taylor, Rick|[[Stan Goldberg|Goldberg, Stan]]|letterer=Harkins, Tim|editor=[[Scott Peterson (comics)|Peterson, Scott]]|story=[[Mad Love (comics)|Mad Love]]| title=[[The Batman Adventures]]|date=February 1994 | publisher=[[DC Comics]]| location=[[New York City]]|ISBN=978-1-4012-2245-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; She follows suit in the Joker's clown-themed, criminal antics and adopts the name Harley Quinn, a play on "[[Harlequin]]" from the character in [[commedia dell'arte]]. Speaking with a pronounced Northeastern&lt;!-- Do not change this to a specific place as this is variable per depiction. --&gt; accent, Harley refers to the Joker as ''Mister J'' and ''Puddin''', terms of endearment that have since been used in nearly every adaptation in which the two characters appear.

===Appearance===
[[File:Harley Quinn Suicide Squad Vol 5 20.png|thumb|Harley Quinn as she appears in the fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad'' (August 2017). Art by Otto Schmidt.]]
Harley Quinn was first introduced in the ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' appearing in the style of a [[jester]]. She wore a black domino mask, white facial makeup, and a one-piece, black, and red [[motley]] outfit with a cowl.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Unlike the Joker, Harley's skin is not permanently white in the animated series, as this is reiterated in scenes showing Harley out of costume with a normal skin complexion. As Dr. Harleen Quinzel, PhD, she is portrayed as having blonde hair and blue eyes. She typically wears glasses, a skirt, high heeled shoes, and a white lab coat.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' #1. DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

In her early comic book appearances until 2011, the character wore her original black and red costume from the animated series. In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Harley Quinn had a revamped look that lasted until 2016. The New 52 showed Harley Quinn with an alternating black- and red-toned outfit with a sleeveless top, elbow pads, tight shorts, knee pads, and boots. Her hair color was altered to half-red and half-black, like the cap of her previous incarnation. Consistent with a new origin, her skin was bleached as the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;''Suicide Squad'' #7 (May 2012). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Following 2016's [[DC Rebirth]], Harley Quinn debuted a new look in the third volume of her eponymous series, as well as the fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad''. Her hair color is now blonde with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right, and she sports two new outfits. One outfit consists of tight, blue and red shorts, ripped tee shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, [[fishnet]] stockings, studded belt, and lace-up boots, much like [[Margot Robbie]]'s depiction of the character in the 2016 ''[[Suicide Squad (film)|Suicide Squad]]'' film. The character's other outfit is a two-tone, black and red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. She's also been known to wear both red and black colored nail polishes on both her finger and toenails in an alternating fashion.

Harley Quinn is adorned with various tattoos, including four diamonds on her upper right thigh. Within the [[DC Extended Universe]], both Harley and the Joker have several tattoos, with Harley having them on her cheek, forearm, legs, and abdomen.

==Transition to comic books and publication history==
After the success of ''The Animated Series'', the character proved so popular that she was eventually added to the ''[[Batman (comic book)|Batman]]'' comic book [[canon (fiction)|canon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldstein|first1=Hilary|title=Batman: Harley Quinn Review|url=http://au.ign.com/articles/2005/05/25/batman-harley-quinn-review|website=IGN|accessdate=12 August 2016|date=24 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She first appeared in the original graphic novel, ''Batman: Harley Quinn'', as part of the "[[No Man's Land (comics)|No Man's Land]]" story, although she had already appeared in the [[Elseworlds]] ''Batman: Thrillkiller'' and ''Batman: Thrillkiller '62'' in 1997. The comic book version of Quinn, like the comic book version of the Joker, is more dangerously violent and less humorously quirky than the animated series version. Despite her noticeably more violent demeanor, Harley does show mercy and compassion from time to time; she notably stops Poison Ivy from killing Batman, instead convincing her to leave the hero hanging bound and gagged from a large statue.

A ''Harley Quinn'' [[ongoing series]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Alan|last=Cowsill|editor-first=Hannah|editor-last=Dolan|title = DC Comics Year By Year A Visual Chronicle|chapter= 2000s|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]] |location=London, England|date=2010 |isbn= 978-0-7566-6742-9 |page= 297 |quote = Written by Karl Kesel and drawn by Terry Dodson, the double-sized first issue dealt with Harley's twisted relationship with the Joker.}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published monthly by [[DC Comics]] for 38 issues from 2001 to 2003. Creators who contributed to the title included [[Karl Kesel]], [[Terry Dodson]], A.J. Lieberman, and Mike Huddleston. The series dealt with her going solo, eventually starting a gang and then fleeing Gotham for the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]] with her friend Poison Ivy. Quinn dies, only to be resurrected and then return to Gotham. The series ends with Harley turning herself in to Arkham Asylum, having finally understood that she needs help. We also learn in issue #8 of the comic that Harley had a relationship in college with fellow psychology student Guy Kopski, whose suicide foreshadowed her obsession with the Joker. Harley later appears in the [[Jeph Loeb]] series ''[[Batman: Hush|Hush]]''. She is next seen in a ''[[Villains United]]'' ''[[Infinite Crisis]]'' special, where she is one of the many villains who escape from Arkham (although she is knocked unconscious the moment she escapes).

In the ''[[One Year Later]]'' continuity, Harley Quinn is an inmate at Arkham, glimpsed briefly upon in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #823 (Nov. 2006).

Harley next appeared in ''Batman'' #663 (April 2007), in which she helps the Joker with a plan to kill all his former henchmen, unaware that the "punch line" to the scheme is her own death. Upon realizing this, she shoots him in the shoulder.

Harley resurfaces in ''Detective Comics'' #831 (June 2007), written by Paul Dini. Harley has spent the last year applying for parole, only to see her request systematically rejected by Bruce Wayne, the layman member of Arkham's medical commission. She is kidnapped by Peyton Riley, the new female [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], who offers her a job; Harley turns the job down out of respect for the memory of Arnold Wesker, the original Ventriloquist, who attempted to cheer her up during her first week in Arkham while the Joker was still on the loose. She then helps Batman and [[James Gordon (comics)|Commissioner Jim Gordon]] foil the impostor's plans. Although Riley escapes, Bruce Wayne is impressed with Harley's effort at redemption, and agrees with granting her parole.

''[[Birds of Prey (comics)|Birds of Prey]]'' #105 (June 2039) reveals Harley Quinn as the sixth member of the [[Secret Six (comics)|Secret Six]]. In issue #108, upon hearing that [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]] has sent the Russian authorities footage of teammate [[Deadshot]] murdering the Six's employer as payback for double-crossing them, Harley asks, "Is it a bad time to say 'I quit'?", thus leaving the team.

In ''[[Countdown (DC Comics)|Countdown]]'' #43 (July 2007), Harley appears to have reformed and is shown to be residing in an [[Amazons (DC Comics)|Amazon]]-run women's shelter. Having abandoned her jester costume and clown make-up, she now only wears an Amazonian [[stola]] or [[chiton (costume)|chiton]]. She befriends the former [[Catwoman]] replacement [[Holly Robinson (comics)|Holly Robinson]], and then succeeds in persuading her to join her at the shelter, where she is working as an assistant. They are both brought to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themiscyra]] by "Athena" (really [[Granny Goodness]]) and begin Amazon training. Holly and Harley then meet the real Athena, and encounter [[Mary Marvel]]. The group reveal Granny's deception, and Holly, Harley, and Mary follow her as she retreats to [[Apokolips]]. Mary finds the Olympian gods, whom Granny had been holding prisoner, and the group frees them. Harley is granted powers by [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] as a reward. Upon returning to Earth, the powers vanish, and Harley and Holly return to [[Gotham City]].

===Gotham City Sirens===
Harley Quinn joins forces with [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] (Pamela Isley) and [[Catwoman]] (Selina Kyle) in the series ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]''. Having moved in with Pamela Isley at the [[Riddler]]'s apartment, she meets up with Catwoman, who offers for the three of them to live and work together. A new villain who tried to take down Selina Kyle named Boneblaster breaks into the apartment, and the three of them have to move after they defeat him. Later, after a chance encounter with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], the Joker attempts to kill her, apparently out of jealousy. Quinn is rescued by Ivy and Catwoman, and it is later revealed that her attacker wasn't the real Joker, but one of his old henchmen impersonating him.

[[File:Harleen Quinzel.jpg|thumb|200px|Harley Quinn as Dr. Harleen Quinzel, PhD.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Art by [[Clay Mann]] and Seth Mann.]]
In ''[[Gotham City Sirens]]'' #7, Harley Quinn visits her family in [[Bensonhurst]], Brooklyn during the holiday season. Harley's father is a swindler who is still in jail, and her brother, Barry, is a loser with dead-end dreams of rock stardom. Her mother, Sharon, wants her to stop the "villain and hero stuff". The dysfunctional, "horrible" experience while visiting family causes her to return home to the Sirens' shared Gotham City hideout where Harley, Catwoman, and Poison Ivy spend the rest of Christmas together.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Following a number of adventures with Catwoman and Ivy, Harley betrays them and breaks into Arkham Asylum with the goal of killing the Joker for his years of abuse towards her. However, Harley ultimately chooses instead to release Joker from his cell, and together the two orchestrate a violent takeover of the facility that results in most of the guards and staff members either being killed or taken hostage by the inmates.&lt;ref&gt;''Gotham City Sirens'' #20–23. DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Harley and the Joker are eventually defeated by Batman and Catwoman, and Harley is last seen being wheeled away while bound in a straitjacket and muzzle.&lt;ref&gt;''Gotham City Sirens'' #24 (June 2011). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Poison Ivy breaks into Harley's cell and attempts to kill her for her betrayal, but instead offers to free her if she helps kill Catwoman, who had left both of her fellow Sirens behind in Arkham. Harley agrees, and the two set out to trap Catwoman.&lt;ref&gt;''Gotham City Sirens'' #25 (July 2011). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; During the ensuing fight, Catwoman says that she saw good in them and only wanted to help. Just as Batman is about to arrest them, Catwoman helps the two of them escape.&lt;ref&gt;''Gotham City Sirens'' #26 (August 2011). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, the debut of the six-issue miniseries ''Poison Ivy: Cycle of Life and Death'' reuniting Harley Quinn, Poison Ivy, and Catwoman. Harley appears in the debut issue as Dr. Harleen Quinzel, PhD. with continued appearances throughout the series.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

===The New 52/Harley Quinn Rebirth===
Following DC's [[The New 52|2011 relaunch]] of its titles, Harley Quinn's costume and appearance was fully revamped. The New 52 shows Harley Quinn with a sleeveless top, tight shorts, and boots. Her hair color has also been altered to half-red and half-black and her bleached skin is the result of being kicked into a vat of acid by the Joker.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt;

After a falling out with the Joker, she goes into a murderous frenzy, directed towards people responsible for the Joker's imprisonment. Captured by [[Black Canary]], she is forcibly inducted into the [[Suicide Squad]] by [[Amanda Waller]].&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' #1 (September 2011). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; However, when she discovers that the Joker is rumored to be dead, it takes a further toll to her already addled mind, and betraying the Suicide Squad, she puts their safety and secrecy at risk by turning herself into the Gotham Police Department in a plot to gain access to the skinned face of the Joker.&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' #6 (February 2012). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Her plan apparently pays off, and she manages to recover the face, though in a further psychotic episode, Harley captures and ties up Deadshot and places the skinned face of the Joker over Deadshot's face, so that she can carry on a "conversation" with her dead lover. Deadshot lures Harley in close, shooting and severely injuring her during the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;''Suicide Squad'' #7 (March 2012). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; After the Joker returns to Gotham in the "[[Death of the Family]]" story line, he forces her to disguise herself in his old [[Red Hood#The Joker|Red Hood]] costume and trick Batman into coming to the chemical plant where they first met. Batman then falls into a tank and demands Harley to tell him where Joker is. But she only replies, in tears, that he is no longer the Joker she had fallen in love with.&lt;ref&gt;''Batman''#13 (October 2012). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Harley Quinn Poison Ivy Cycle of Life and Death.png|thumb|left|200px|Harley Quinn in the New 52. Art by Clay Mann and Seth Mann.]]
On July 16, 2013, DC announced that a new ''Harley Quinn'' ongoing comic book series would begin publication in November 2013, co-written by [[Amanda Conner]] and her husband [[Jimmy Palmiotti]], cover illustrated by Conner, and story illustrated by Chad Hardin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Phegley|first=Kiel|title=CCI EXCLUSIVE: Conner &amp; Palmiotti Launch "Harley Quinn" Monthly|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=46652|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=46809|title=SDCC: DiDio and Lee Head DC's Meet The Co-Publishers|last=Campbell|first=Josie|publisher=Comic Book Resources|date=July 21, 2013|accessdate=July 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series has notably become distanced from the "Batman Family" of DC publications in both tone and premise, with Harley no longer having any significant connection to either Batman or the Joker following the "Death of the Family" storyline. In the series, Harley Quinn has become a landlady at [[Coney Island]], is a part-time member of a roller derby team and has returned to her work in psychology under her real alias, indicating that Harley's real identity is not public knowledge in the new status quo.

Under Conner and Palmiotti's writing, Harley was reinvented as an [[antihero]], who after being released from the Suicide Squad and having her public files erased values human life more or less and actively tries to improve life in her neighborhood with mixed results. While the comic book version of the character is still romantically linked with the Joker, a more recent development has Harley also romantically involved with [[Poison Ivy]]. ''Harley Quinn'' series writers [[Jimmy Palmiotti]] and [[Amanda Conner]] confirmed that the two characters are in a non-monogamous romantic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Evan|last=Narcisse|url=http://kotaku.com/dc-comics-harley-quinn-poison-ivy-are-girlfriends-w-1711038615|title=DC Comics: Harley Quinn &amp; Poison Ivy Are Girlfriends "Without Monogamy"|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Univision Communication]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 12, 2015|accessdate=July 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between issues #11 and #13 Harley formed a brief partnership with an amnesiac [[Power Girl]] and battled [[Clock King]] and [[Sportsmaster]] before Power Girl's memory was restored and she left Harley at the top of the [[Eiffel Tower]] as punishment for her deceit.&lt;ref&gt;''Harley Quinn'' #11-13 (October–December 2014). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Harley attempts to coerce a romantic connection with her tenant Mason, but was unable to make the date due to the multitude of responsibilities in her life, balancing her two jobs with her commitment to her roller derby team and her career as a crime-fighter.&lt;ref&gt;''Harley Quinn'' #14 (February 2015). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; With support from Ivy, Harley makes amends with Mason and turns to the internet to recruit other strong, young women in a crime-fighting team she is forming.&lt;ref&gt;''Harley Quinn'' #15 (March 2015). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; This team, comprising young women of various ethnic backgrounds and one gay man called Harvey Quinn, then fights [[Captain Strong|Captain Horatio Strong]], a sea captain who becomes superhumanly strong after eating an addictive alien sea-plant, in an homage to [[Popeye]]. Harley agrees to help a woman whose daughter has been kidnapped by a gang in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;''Harley Quinn## #16-19(June–August 2015)''&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Catch Phrase''': When startled or excited Harley tends to do a clear parody of Robin's old catchphrase by saying "Holee" and then some sort of alliteration.

''Harley Quinn'' has featured a few standalone specials which are not directly connected to the main series and feature multiple artists. In the [[scratch and sniff]]-themed ''Annual'' issue, Harley briefly returned to Gotham to save her girlfriend Poison Ivy, as the [[Arkham Asylum]] employees monitoring her had brainwashed her to create a hallucinogenic pathogen.&lt;ref&gt;''Harley Quinn Annual'' #1 (October 2014). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[Valentines Day]] Special'', Harley returned to Gotham to win a prize date with Bruce Wayne (who unbeknownst to her is Batman) and finds herself fighting animal rights activists-turned-super villain blackmailers. She shares a brief intimate moment with Bruce Wayne. At Coney Island, Batman informs Harley that while he still distrusts her, he admires her attempt at heroism and promises not to interfere. Harley kisses Batman and tells him to get "lessons" on kissing from Bruce Wayne, to which Batman privately grins.&lt;ref&gt;''Harley Quinn Valentines Day Special'' #1 (Feb 2015). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The New 52: Futures End|Futures End]]'', a series set five years in the future, Harley mails herself to the Bahamas in an attempt to save money on airfare. The plane carrying her crashes over the ocean while flying through a storm and Harley is washed up onto the shores of an island inhabited by an un-contacted tribe. The tribe quickly declares her a goddess and is determined to have her meet their god-king who turns out to be the [[Joker (character)|Joker]].

After a fight and reconciliation, Harley learns that the Joker has been living on the island as a god and making the inhabitants dress up as various superheroes and track him down while playing tricks on them. It is announced that she and the Joker are to be married. She is initially excited about the pending marriage until she discovers that the two will be sacrificed to the island's volcano as their wedding ceremony ends.&lt;ref&gt;"Future's End: Harley Quinn" (2014). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

A spin-off series entitled ''Harley Quinn and Power Girl'' was launched in June 2015. The series is set to run six issues and takes place while Harley has the amnesiac [[Power Girl]] convinced the two are a crime fighting duo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/23500-conner-palmiotti-talk-harley-quinn-june-power-girl-spin-off-female-readers.html|title=CONNER, PALMIOTTI Talk HARLEY QUINN, June POWER GIRL Spin-Off, Female Readers|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story follows the two when they are sent to a part of deep space known as La Galaxia Del Sombrero during the unseen events mentioned in ''Harley Quinn'' #12 and then chronicles their journey to return to Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Harley Quinn and Power Girl (July 2015). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harley has broken up with the Joker and has a romantic relationship with Poison Ivy.&lt;ref name=cbrbrian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cbr.com/harley-quinn-and-poison-ivy-a-history/|title=Harley Quinn and Poison Ivy: A History|date=December 18, 2016|work=[[Comic Book Resources]]|first=Brian|last=Cronin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongoing series has continued with no apparent connection to ''Suicide Squad'' other than her new hairstyle, dyed for her by one of the tenants in her Brooklyn apartment and a few guest shots from characters like Killer Croc and Deadshot. Harley has once again met up with Power Girl and even her new sidekick Terra. She has faced down multiple villains from the Penguin to the corrupt mayor of New York and is in the process of running for mayor herself when the previous mayor tried to solve the homeless problem by feeding them to cannibals. She also runs a "vigilante for hire" group she calls her Gang of Harleys and has numerous other allies and stalkers including Red Tool (a parody of Deadpool), Harley Sinn (a former nemesis), and various other allies she has made along the way. The mayor countered by kidnapping her friend Mason and killing him. Harley got revenge and then she and Ivy went to visit with her family. On her return a man-bat was seen around town and Tony went missing. Not feeling very good after the death of Mason Harley ordered her gang to stay out of it and was summarily ignored. They went to Arkham to ask Langston if he was behind it, but found him gibbering in his cell. He did however mention that there was "another". Meanwhile, Harley went hunting for the man-bat and took it down only to find out it was Tony. Kidnapped moments later they awoke in Langstrom's lab to find that his wife was the newest man-bat and she then jabbed Harley with the man-bat potion.

After that mess a few of her old criminal buddies including Penguin, The Mad Hatter, Scarecrow, Solomon Grundy, False Face, Mr. Freeze, and numerous other Batman villains took advantage of Harley's grief over her dead friend Mason to split her from her team. This was a temporary measure and soon Harley freed them from mind control and apologized for some things she said while on truth serum. Working together with all of her friends and allies like Killer Croc, Poison Ivy, and Power Girl Harley took the gang down. A few weeks later the Riddler showed up late for the fight while Harley and her gang were eating at the reformed Condiment King's new hot dog stand and they easily beat him up too. 
This was followed up by a One-shot in which we see a decimated future where Red Tool has tracked down Old Lady Harley at future cyborg Tony's request. We learn that she married pretty much everyone she knew at one time or another and that the world was mostly destroyed when her Gang of Harleys became several Gangs and tore each other to pieces after Coach was killed/absorbed by Brainiac. Harley finds her old original gang, beats them up and takes control again. Then leaves Coach/Brainiac in charge and heads out with Red Tool to go home. 
Back in the current time period she recently went on a one-woman rampage on Apokolips before coming back to Earth with a new friend she rescued from Granny Goodness named Tina to deal with a realtor and a cult run by a skeleton headed goof calling himself "Lord Death Man" who she heard about on a literal pirate broadcast. It turns out he set it up himself because he is in love with her and thought it was fun walking into her traps, being apparently unkillable. Harley used the money he paid her to save her building and surrounding businesses from a land developer whom she then catapulted away. When last seen Harley was reading one of her own comics and a woman calling herself Jonni DC Continuity Cop was threatening to stop her and the preview predicted Harley would destroy the DC Universe. After her mother was temporarily retconned and a series of pointless adventures through multiple continuity everything was restored to normal with the exception of an alternate past superhero with no concept of a "gray area" being pulled into Harley's world.

====Controversy====
In September 2013, DC Comics announced a contest for fans and artists, "Break into comics with Harley Quinn!",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dccomics.com/blog/2013/09/05/break-into-comics-with-harley-quinn#1|title=Break into comics with Harley Quinn!|work=DC Comics|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which contestants were to draw Harley in four different suicide scenarios. This contest drew controversy not only because it was announced close to [[National Suicide Prevention Week]], but because some artists did not like the sexualized portrayal of Harley in the fourth scenario, in which Harley attempts suicide while naked in her bath tub. After seeing the reactions to the contest, DC apologized, saying they should have made it clear that it was a dream sequence that was not supposed to be taken seriously. In the final version, the bath tub scene was cut and replaced with Harley sitting on a rocket while flying in space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/09/12/dc-comics-harley-quinn-suicide-_n_3913842.html | work=[[The Huffington Post]]|first=Cavan | last=Sieczkowski | title=Awful Comic Contest Asks For Drawings of Naked Woman Committing Suicide | date=September 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jezebel.com/dc-comics-contest-draw-a-naked-woman-committing-suicid-1265537616|title=DC Comics Contest: Draw a Naked Woman Committing Suicide|author=Callie Beusman|work=Jezebel|accessdate=January 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harley's Little Black Book===
Harley also teamed up with a lot of major DC characters in "Harley's Little Black Book" including Zatanna, Wonder Woman, Superman, Lobo, and a version of herself and some other superheroines in a world in which they were trying to kill [[Hitler]].

===DC Universe===
DC Comics began the next relaunch of its entire line of titles called [[DC Rebirth]] in June 2016. In December 2017, DC opted to rebrand its titles under the "DC Universe" name, using the continuity established from DC Rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Rich|title=The End Of DC Rebirth Announced At New York Comic-Con|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/10/06/end-dc-rebirth-announced-new-york-comic-con|website=bleedingcool|accessdate=March 11, 2018|date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bonthuys|first=Darryn|title=The Rebirth era is over, as a new direction begins in DC Universe|url=https://www.criticalhit.net/comics-toys/rebirth-era-new-direction-begins-dc-universe|website=criticalhit|accessdate=March 11, 2018|date=December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the DC Universe, Harley Quinn is featured in a bimonthly third volume of her eponymous series, starting with ''Harley Quinn'' vol. 3, #1 (October 2016).

====Suicide Squad====
[[File:Harley Quinn at Belle Reve.png|thumb|Harley Quinn attacks guards at Belle Reve.&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5, #20. DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Art by [[Stjepan Šejić]].]] Harley Quinn has a recurring role in the comic book title ''[[Suicide Squad]]'', which debuted its fifth volume with ''Suicide Squad'' vol. 5, #1 (October 2016). Following the events of DC Rebirth, Harley Quinn sports two new outfits following in DC Universe. She wears tight, blue and red shorts, ripped white tee shirt, satin jacket, fingerless gloves, net stockings, and boots. Her other outfit is a two-tone, black and red suit consisting of a full-sleeve top, tight shorts, opaque stockings, garter belt attachments, and boots. Harley Quinn is adorned with tattoos and her hair color is blonde hair with blue [[dip dye]] on the left side and pink dip dye on the right to match the movie and her new hair style in 52.

Unlike her counterpart in the New 52 series (who may be a sequel to this series after Harley finishes her time on the Squad even going so far as to erase her public criminal record despite the fact that both versions got the dip-dyed hair style at the same time) she is still fairly dark and resists any attempts at labeling her a hero, no matter how many lives she saves or how many times she steps up to take command of the situation. She tends to swap her carefree joking attitude for the occasional sulk. So far the events of the Squad do little to affect the DC universe outside of their immediate mission. She is still officially done with the Joker in a romantic capacity and Poison Ivy's on again off again girlfriend.

The ongoing fifth volume of ''Suicide Squad'' shows Harley Quinn as an unpredictable and dangerous inmate at [[Belle Reve|Belle Reve Penitentiary]], attacking the facility's security forces when given the opportunity.&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt; Harley Quinn becomes the leader of the Suicide Squad in issue #20, following Rick Flag's apparent death. The members of the team under Harley's leadership include [[Captain Boomerang]], [[Deadshot]], [[Enchantress (DC Comics)|Enchantress]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]], and [[Killer Croc]].

==Powers and abilities==
With the help of her friend Poison Ivy who is toxic by nature and did not want to poison Harley with her natural toxins, Harley Quinn is immune to various, though not all, toxins and heals quickly from minor wounds. It also enhanced her strength and natural agility. She also has developed an immunity to the Joker's venom and toxic gas, as mentioned in the Batman animated series and in the comic books, and other knock-out chemicals. If she's over extended though, like when she was turned into a man-bat, her immunity can be worn down and such things will work for a time. Harley is a trained gymnast with fighting skills honed by years of her criminal undertakings. She is also well educated as she has a PhD in criminal psychiatry and has her own nonlethal version of the Joker's gas. She has a slight immunity to mind control due to her insanity and not being sure what is going on in her head herself and has broken free of such before and mentally damaged beings who have tried to read her mind.

==Other versions==
* Harley Quinn's first major appearance outside the Batman animated world was in the [[Elseworlds]] miniseries ''[[Batman: Thrillkiller|Thrillkiller]]''. This version of Harley is a schoolgirl named '''Hayley Fitzpatrick''' who dresses up in order to help a female version of the Joker called Bianca Steeplechase.

* In the ''[[Elseworlds 80-Page Giant]]'', one of the stories is about [[Lex Luthor]] as a music producer. One of his groups is, as the press puts it, "[[alternative lifestyle]] [[folk music|folkies]] Ivy and Harley".&lt;ref&gt;''Elseworlds 80-Page Giant''. DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

He chased her to the ledge of the building around Crime Alley. Batman drops her off the roof, but is luckily saved by [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]]. &lt;ref&gt;''Flashpoint'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Batman '66]]'', a version of Harley Quinn designed more around the 1960s television show (she is slightly taller and her hair is short; she also wears prominent slanted glasses, a long red dress and red blouse, large pearl necklace, and fairly prominent earrings) appears as '''Dr. Holly Quinn''', PhD, a psychologist at [[Arkham Asylum]], referred to as Arkham Institute for the Criminally Insane. She convinces Joker to cooperate with Batman and Robin in exchange for approving his comedy night proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Batman '66 #3. DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Quinn is manipulated by Catwoman and Joker to perfect the Joker Wave — a hysteria-inducing transmitting dish used on Gotham. Quinn is devastated by her role in the plot and to atone for her mistake, Dr. Quinn reverses the device by submitting herself to its effects — freeing the people of Gotham, but sacrificing her sanity in the process. She escapes and becomes a supervillain named Harlequin. She retains her considerable intelligence and psychological training, making her a difficult foe for the Dynamic Duo, but is eventually captured when Batman and Robin disguise themselves as criminals (Batman in his regular alternate guise of [[Matches Malone]]) who beat up other bad guys who were auditioning to be Holly's henchmen.&lt;ref&gt;Batman '66 #24. DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;
* Harley Quinn appears in the prequel comic to the game ''[[Injustice: Gods Among Us]]''. She helps the Joker kidnap [[Lois Lane]] and surgically plant a trigger in her heart that will set off a nuclear bomb in Metropolis should her heart stop; when Superman accidentally kills her (thinking she is [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]]) he becomes devastated, with the grieving Superman killing the Joker as a result. Harley struggles to come to terms with Joker's death but develops an attachment to Green Arrow when he kidnaps her to protect her from Superman's wrath, but is also grief-stricken when he's killed by Superman. She later confronts Black Canary, but hesitates upon realizing she's pregnant upon vomiting mid-battle and reveals to Black Canary that she has a 4-year-old daughter named Lucy who lives with her sister. Harley and Canary befriend each other as a result and Harley starts helping Batman's Insurgency, though most members distrust her due to her lover's actions. In ''[[Injustice 2]]'', she helps to fight Grodd's Society and Braniac alongside Black Canary, Green Arrow, and the other Justice League and Regime members. It is revealed in the ending that she later joins the Justice League as a fully accepted member, though she occasionally has to deal with her violent impulses. It is also revealed that her daughter thinks her mother is actually her aunt Harley, though Harley hopes she may one day be able to tell her the truth. 
* In the ''[[Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' crossover, Harley is made into a mutant hyena by [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|the Shredder]]. She is knocked out by Batman in the final battle and [[Splinter (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Splinter]] uses her hammer to take down the rest of the Arkham inmates. After the Shredder is defeated, the mutagen in her system decays naturally, causing her and the rest of the mutated inmates to revert to normal.&lt;ref&gt;Batman/Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles #6. DC Comics/IDW&lt;/ref&gt;
* In ''[[Batman: White Knight]]'', it's revealed that Harley Quinn was two different women all along. The first Harley Quinn, Harleen Quinzel, quit when the Joker captured and tortured [[Robin (character)|Robin]] ([[Jason Todd]]), and she was replaced by another girl, Marian Drews, without Joker even realizing it. Once Joker was cured from his insanity, he proposes marriage to Harley, only for her to beat him and mock him for acting "normal". The original Harley Quinn then appears, kicks the "fake Harley" unconscious and reveals Jack Napier (Joker's true identity in this continuity) that there were two Harley's all along. While Harleen loved Joker "despite his flaws", Marian loved Joker by "his flaws". She accepts his marriage proposal and joins him in his quest to rid Gotham City of Batman. Drews then takes the mantle of the Joker for herself "until the real Joker returns".&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: White Knight'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Batman: White Knight'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2002, a short-lived live-action television series called ''[[Birds of Prey (TV series)|Birds of Prey]]'', included Harley Quinn as a psychologist and the main antagonist, portrayed by actress [[Mia Sara]] (replacing [[Sherilyn Fenn]] from an [[Unaired Pilot (Birds of Prey)|unaired pilot episode]]). In this show, Harleen Quinzel uses her day job as a psychologist to achieve her hidden purpose: to take control of the city of New Gotham. She does not wear a costume, although she does wear an outfit that is reminiscent of her cartoon costume in the series finale "[[Devil's Eyes]]". In that episode, she uses experimental technology to transfer [[metahuman]] mind control powers to herself. She occasionally makes reference to her "sweet Mr. J.", laments his loss as a Gotham City crime boss and hints at a past relationship reminiscent to that of the animated series. A criminal known as the Crawler addresses her as "the Joker's girlfriend" in the seventh episode "Split".

[[File:Arkham Knight Harley Quinn Promo.jpg|thumb|right|Harley Quinn in a promotional image for ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'']]
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Asylum]]'', she dons a new costume based on a nurse uniform. She takes control of Arkham, allowing Joker to escape, releases [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] from her cell, and kidnaps Warden [[Quincy Sharp]]. After Batman rescues Sharp, he confronts her and locks her in a cell. She returns in the [[Scarecrow (DC Comics)|Scarecrow's]] final nightmare as one of the guards escorting Batman away.
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', she is shown wearing a biker-girl themed costume in this game, using a low-key version of her usual makeup, with heavy eye shadow in lieu of her domino mask. Batman encounters Harley in the Sionis Steel Mill where she was with the Joker. She later steals the cure for the Joker's illness while Batman was fighting Mr. Freeze for it, but is bound and gagged by [[Talia al Ghul]]. When the Joker dies from his illness, Quinn was with the Joker's henchmen when Batman brought his dead body out of the theater. 
** Harley also appears in "Harley Quinn's Revenge" expansion, seeking revenge on Batman for the death of the Joker. By this time, Harley has dyed her hair completely black and wears almost all black, with a "J" necklace and mourning veil. After escaping from a temporary holding area following the destruction of Arkham City, Harley transforms the Steel Mill into a gigantic memorial of him. She is later beaten by the duo of Batman and Robin and taken into custody by the GCPD. 
** Included as an [[Easter egg]] in the manager's office of the Steel Mill, there is a crib with [[Scarface (comics)|Scarface]] painted as the Joker inside, surrounded by dozens of negative pregnancy tests accompanied by a single positive pregnancy test, which could indicate that she had a miscarriage, the positive test was false, or after several failed attempts she finally got pregnant just before the Joker died.
* Harley Quinn appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham City Lockdown]]'', where she kidnaps a reporter to use as a hostage to free the Joker. After luring Batman into a trap, she tries to execute the bound and gagged reporter, but is stopped by one of Batman's batarangs. She is once again voiced by Tara Strong.
* Dr. Harleen Quinzel, M.D. appears briefly in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' before her transformation into Harley Quinn. She interviews Joker at Blackgate Prison and falls in love with him after he confesses his fascination with someone who he considers special to him (Batman). She later appears amongst the prison's other staff members held hostage by Joker when he takes over the facility, but she is rescued by Batman. Quinzel is last seen escorting the Joker to his cell after he is defeated by Batman in the game's ending.
** In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins Blackgate]]'', it is detailed in the unlockable Detective Case titled "Doctor's Orders" that Quinzel's increasing obsession with the Joker is not going unnoticed by her fellow staff, who are beginning to worry that the Joker may be manipulating Quinzel. The Case also states that Quinzel has started referring to the Joker as "Mister J" in her personal journal with hearts drawn around his name, rather than "Patient ARK119805".
* In the main story of ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', it is revealed that in between the events of Arkham City and the current game, she's become a very competent gang leader, having recovered control of the Joker's former gang (including the members that were plotting to overthrow her or desert her) and has even become one of Gotham's main gang leaders, recruited by Scarecrow in his plan to kill Batman. She tries to break free and recruit the victims of Joker's blood transfusion who were not affected by the cure, all of whom started to display traces of his appearance and behavior, but they all end up dead after she was betrayed by one of the Joker patients that was working with her.
** Apart from the main game, she is a playable character via downloadable content that was once a pre-order exclusive. This content contains a story-driven mission, featuring her own weapons and abilities; it also includes four challenge maps for the character. In her mission, which takes place shortly before the main story, Harley breaks into the [[Blüdhaven]] prison to free Poison Ivy, defeating all police officers and, with Ivy's help, Nightwing.&lt;ref name="HarleyDLC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=794562063909621&amp;set=a.157294880969679.40633.140262999339534&amp;type=1|title=Pre-order Batman: Arkham Knight right now for the chance to play as Harley Quinn in an exclusive story-driven mission starring the psychotic psychiatrist!|author=Batman Arkham|publisher=Facebook|date=June 30, 2014|accessdate=June 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At certain points, her Harleen and Harley personas are heard fighting for control of her body.

She is then critically wounded by Wonder Woman, but saved by Supergirl. In her single player ending, Harley accepts Batman's offer to join the Justice League while still acting as her daughter Lucy's aunt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Copeland|first1=Wesley|title=Gamescom 2016: Harley Quinn And Deadshot Join Injustice 2 Roster|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/17/gamescom-2016-harley-quinn-and-deadshot-join-injustice-2-roster|website=IGN|accessdate=17 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Sims describes the approach of ''Batman: The Animated Series'' as showing "a version of the character who is having adventures ''right now''", and regards that choice as being a key part of Harley Quinn's production.

The Hausa are a diverse but culturally homogeneous people based primarily in the [[Sahel]]ian and the sparse [[savanna]] areas of southern [[Niger]] and northern [[Nigeria]] respectively, numbering over 70 million people in total with significant naturalised populations in [[Cameroon]], [[Central African Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/12070/CT|title=Hausa in Central African Republic|last=|first=|date=|website=Joshua Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Republic of the Congo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/12070/CF|title=Hausa in Congo, Republic of the|last=|first=|date=|website=Joshua Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ivory Coast]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/12070/IV|title=Hausa in Côte d'Ivoire|last=|first=|date=|website=Joshua project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chad]], [[Togo]], [[Ghana]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/12070/GH|title=Hausa in Ghana|last=|first=|date=|website=Joshua Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sudan]], [[Eritrea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.madote.com/2010/04/nigerian-eritreans-history-of-housa-and.html|title=Nigerian Eritreans - The history of Hausa and Bargo in Eritrea|last=|first=|date=|website=Madote|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Equatorial Guinea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/12070/EK|title=Hausa in Equatorial Guinea|last=|first=|date=|website=Joshua Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gabon]], [[Senegal]] and the [[Gambia]]

Predominantly Hausa-speaking communities are scattered throughout West Africa and on the traditional [[Hajj]] route north and east traversing the [[Sahara]], with an especially large population in and around the town of [[Agadez]]. Other Hausa have also moved to large coastal cities in the region such as [[Lagos]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Accra]], [[Abidjan]], [[Banjul]] and [[Cotonou]] as well as to parts of North Africa such as [[Libya]] over the course of the last 5,000 years. Most Hausa, however, live in small villages or towns in Africa, where they grow crops, raise livestock including [[cattle]] and engage in trade. They speak the [[Hausa language]], an [[Afro-Asiatic language]] of the [[Chadic languages|Chadic]] group. The Hausa aristocracy had historically developed an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] based culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/34443|title=The role of the horse in Hausa culture|publisher=|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still a status symbol of the traditional nobility in Hausa society, the horse still features in the [[Islamic holidays|Eid]] day celebrations, known as ''Ranar Sallah'' (in English: the Day of the Prayer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esthergarvi.org/2010/03/28/horse-talk-breeding-in-niger/|title=» Horse Talk: Horse Breeding in Niger Esther Garvi: Niger, West Africa|publisher=|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daura]] city is the cultural centre of the Hausa people. The town predates all the other major Hausa towns in tradition and culture.

The Hausa have in the last 500 years criss crossed the vast African landscape in all its four corners for varieties of reasons such as military service, long distance trade, performance of hajj, fleeing from oppressive kings as well as spreading Islam.

The Hausa are culturally and historically closest to other [[Sahelian]] ethnic groups, primarily the [[Fula people|Fula]]; the [[Zarma people|Zarma]] and [[Songhai people|Songhai]] (in [[Tillabery]], [[Tahoua]] and [[Dosso Kingdom|Dosso]] in [[Niger]]); the [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]] and [[Shuwa Arabs]] (in [[Chad]], [[Sudan]] and northeastern Nigeria); the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] (in [[Agadez]], [[Maradi, Niger|Maradi]] and [[Zinder]]); the [[Gur languages|Gur]] and [[Gonja people|Gonja]] (in northeastern [[Ghana]], [[Burkina Faso]], northern [[Togo]] and upper [[Benin]]); [[Gwari]] (in central Nigeria); and the [[Mande people|Mandinka]], [[Bambara people|Bambara]], [[Dyula people|Dioula]] and [[Soninke people|Soninke]] (in [[Mali]], [[Senegal]], [[Gambia]], [[Ivory Coast]] and [[Guinea]]). Migrants from these areas introduced various Africanised Islamic teachings to many Hausa by the 14th century, although Islam itself had a presence in Hausaland as early as the 11th century among the ruling class.

All of these various ethnic groups among and around the Hausa live in the vast and open lands of the [[Sahel]], [[Sahara]]n and [[Sudan (region)|Sudanian]] regions, and as a result of the geography and the cross crossing network of traditional African trade routes, have influenced each other's cultures to varying degrees. Today half of Nigeria’s Fula people cannot be distinguished from Hausa people in many northern states of Nigeria, due to inter-marriage and cultural assimilation. In Agadez and Saharan areas of central Niger, the Tuareg and Hausa groups are indistinguishable from each other in their traditional clothing; both wear the [[tagelmust]] and [[indigo]] [[Boubou (clothing)|Babban Riga/Gandora]]. But the two groups differ in language, lifestyle and preferred beasts of burden (the Tuareg use [[camel]]s, while Hausa ride [[horse]]s).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200301/agadez-sultanate.of.the.sahara.htm "Agadez Sultanate of the Sahara"], Saudi Aramco World, January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Hausa have mixed with ethnic groups such as the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] and [[Shuwa Arabs|Shuwa]], incorporating the foods and style of dress into local Hausa custum, as well as heavily influencing the cultures of these groups. Islamic [[Shari’a]] law is loosely the law of the land in Hausa areas, well understood by any Islamic scholar or teacher, known in Hausa as a ''m'allam'', ''mallan'' or ''malam'' (see [[Maulana]]). This [[Religious pluralism|pluralist]] attitude toward ethnic-identity and cultural affiliation has enabled the Hausa to inhabit one of the largest geographic regions of non-[[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] ethnic groups in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liv.ac.uk/history/research/Hausa_identity/Abstracts_Hausa_Norwich.pdf|title=404 Error Page - University of Liverpool|publisher=|accessdate=4 November 2015}}{{dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nok culture]] appeared in [[Northern Nigeria]] around 1000 BC and vanished under unknown circumstances around 300 AD in the region of West Africa. It is believed to be the product of an ancestral nation that branched to create the Hausa, [[Gwari]], [[Berom people|Birom]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Nupe people|Nupe]] and [[Jukun people (West Africa)|Jukun]] peoples.
The Kwatarkwashi Culture or Sokoto Culture located to the North west of Nok is thought to be the same as or an earlier ancestor of the Nok.

Nok's [[Systems theory in anthropology|social system]] is thought to have been highly advanced. The Nok culture is considered to be the earliest [[sub-Saharan]] producer of life-sized [[Terracotta]].

The refinement of this culture is attested to by the image of a Nok dignitary at the [[Minneapolis Institute of Arts]]. The dignitary is portrayed wearing a "crooked baton" ([http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nok/hd_nok2.htm], [https://web.archive.org/web/20100612213333/http://artsmia.org/viewer/detail.php?id=5368&amp;v=12&amp;dept=8]). The dignitary is also portrayed sitting with flared nostrils, and an open mouth suggesting performance. Other images show figures on horseback, indicating that the Nok culture possessed the horse.

Iron use, in [[smelting]] and [[forging]] for tools, appears in Nok culture in Africa at least by 550 BC and possibly earlier. [[Christopher Ehret]] has suggested that iron smelting was independently discovered in the region prior to 1000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Jared Diamond, 'Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies' (1997) Chapter 19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Duncan E.

Van Der Merwe, 'Radiocarbon Chronology of the Iron Age in Sub-Saharan Africa' ''Current Anthropology'' 1968. Tylecote 1975 (see below)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 7th century, the Dala Hill in Kano was the site of a Hausa community that migrated from [[Gaya, Nigeria|Gaya]] and engaged in iron-working.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kanoonline.com/jmqs/index.php/history/historical-origins-of-kano|title=Historical Origins of Kano|author=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=4 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150930053244/http://kanoonline.com/jmqs/index.php/history/historical-origins-of-kano|archivedate=30 September 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hausa began to adopt [[Islam]] as early as the 11th century CE although in small numbers. The vast majority still practised [[Hausa Animism]] at this time. The [[Hausa Bakwai]] kingdoms were established around the 7th to 11th centuries. Of these, the [[Kingdom of Daura]] was the first, according to the [[Bayajidda]] Legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Iliffe |first= John |page=75 |title= Africans: The History of a Continent |year=2007 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn= 0-521-86438-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hausa Kingdoms were independent political entities in what is now Northern Nigeria. The Hausa city states emerged as southern terminals of the Trans-Saharan caravan trade.  Like other cities such as [[Gao]] and [[Timbuktu]] in the [[Mali Empire]], these city states became centres of long distance trade. Hausa merchants in each of these cities collected trade items from domestic areas and from the rain forest region to the south through trade or raiding, processed (and taxed) them and then sent them north to cities along the [[Mediterranean]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/gah/hausa-city-states|title=Hausa City States (Nigeria) - The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|publisher=|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trade influenced political development as ideas (and people) from the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]] made their way south to the cities. In fact the Hausa city state creation myth suggests that northern influence. According to the Bayajidda Legend, the city states began when Bayajidda, a prince of [[Baghdad]], arrived in Daura (the oldest of the Hausa city states) and married the queen of the town. Their seven sons founded the other states of [[Katsina]], [[Zazzau]], [[Gobir]], [[Kano]], [[Rano]], and [[Hadejia|Biram]]. These 7 cities are known as the Hausa Bakwai which means Hausa 7.

By the 12th century AD the Hausa were becoming one of Africa's major trading powers, competing with [[Kanem Empire|Kanem-Bornu]] and the [[Mali Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Hogben/Kirk-Greene, ''Emirates'', 82-88; Lange, ''Kingdoms'', 216-221, 554 n. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The primary exports were [[leather]], [[gold]], [[Textile|cloth]], [[salt]], [[kola nuts]], [[slaves]], animal hides, and [[henna]]. Certainly trade influenced religion. By the 14th century, Islam was becoming widespread in Hausaland as [[Soninke Wangara|Wangara]] scholars, scholars and traders from [[Mali Empire|Mali]] and scholars and traders from the [[Maghreb]] brought the religion with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamreligion.com/articles/302/|title=Spread of Islam in West Africa (part 3 of 3): The Empires of Kanem-Bornu and Hausa-Fulani Land|author=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture of the Hausa is perhaps one of the least known but most beautiful of the medieval age. Many of their early [[mosques]] and palaces are bright and colourful, including intricate engraving or elaborate symbols designed into the facade.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} This architectural style is known as ''[[Tubali]]'' which means ''architecture'' in the Hausa language.

The ancient Kano city walls were built in order to provide security to the growing population. The foundation for the construction of the wall was laid by Sarki Gijimasu from 1095 - 1134 and was completed in the middle of the 14th century. In the 16th century, the walls were further extended to their present position. The gates are as old as the walls and were used to control movement of people in and out of the city. 
&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5171/&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 15th century the Hausa were using a modified [[Arabic script]] known as ''[[Ajami script|ajami]]'' to record their own language; the Hausa compiled several written histories, the most popular being the ''[[Kano Chronicle]].'' Many medieval Hausa manuscripts similar to the [[Timbuktu Manuscripts]] written in the Ajami script, have been discovered recently some of them even describe [[constellation]]s and [[Islamic calendars|calendar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201105/from.africa.in.ajami.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World :         From Africa, in Ajami|publisher=|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gobarau Minaret]] was built in the 15th century in [[Katsina]]. It is a 50-foot edifice located in the centre of the city of Katsina, the capital of [[Katsina State]]. The Gobarau minaret, a symbol of the state, is an early example of [[Islamic architecture]] in a city that prides itself as an important Islamic learning centre. The minaret is believed to be one of West Africa's first multi-storey buildings and was once the tallest building in Katsina. The mosque's origin is attributed to the efforts of the influential Islamic scholar Sheikh [[Muhammad al-Maghili]] and Sultan Muhammadu Korau of Katsina. Al-Maghili was from the town of [[Tlemcen]] in present-day Algeria and taught for a while in Katsina, which had become a centre of learning at this time, when he visited the town in the late 15th century during the reign of Muhammadu Korau. He and Korau discussed the idea of building a mosque to serve as a centre for spiritual and intellectual activities. The Gobarau mosque was designed and built to reflect the Timbuktu-style of architecture. It became an important centre for learning, attracting scholars and students from far and wide, and later served as a kind of university.

[[Muhammad Rumfa]] was the Sultan of the [[Sultanate of Kano]], located in modern-day [[Kano State]], [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Nigeria]]. He reigned from 1463 until 1499.&lt;ref name=wwr&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.whenweruled.com/articles.php?lng=en&amp;pg=25|title= 50 Greatest Africans - Sarki Muhammad Rumfa &amp; Emperor Semamun|accessdate=2007-05-05 |work= When We Ruled|publisher=Every Generation Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Rumfa's accomplishments were extending the city walls, building a large palace, the [[Gidan Rumfa]], promoting slaves to governmental positions and establishing the great [[Kurmi Market]], which is still in use today. Kurmi Market is among the oldest and largest local markets in Africa. It used to serve as an international market where North African goods were exchanged for domestic goods through trans-Saharan trade.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nhm"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nhm.org/africa/tour/desert/030.htm|title= Caravans Across the Desert: Marketplace|accessdate=2007-05-06 |work= AFRICA: One Continent.

The legendary Queen [[Amina]] (or Aminatu) is believed to have ruled [[Zazzau]] between the 15th century and the 16th century for a period of 34 years. Amina was 16 years old when her mother, Bakwa Turunku became queen and she was given the traditional title of ''Magajiya'', an honorific borne by the daughters of monarchs. She honed her military skills and became famous for her bravery and military exploits, as she is celebrated in song as "Amina, daughter of Nikatau, a woman as capable as a man." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyandwomen.com/2010/08/amina-of-zaria.html|title=History and Women: Amina of Zaria|publisher=|accessdate=4 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Amina is credited as the architectural overseer who created the strong earthen walls that surround her city, which were the prototype for the fortifications used in all Hausa states. She subsequently built many of these fortifications, which became known as ganuwar Amina or Amina's walls, around various conquered cities.&lt;ref&gt;blackhistorypages.net/pages/amina.php&lt;/ref&gt;
The objectives of her conquests were twofold: extension of her nation beyond its primary borders and reducing the conquered cities to a vassal status. Sultan [[Muhammad Bello]] of [[Sokoto]] stated that, "She made war upon these countries and overcame them entirely so that the people of Katsina paid tribute to her and the men of Kano and... also made war on cities of [[Bauchi]] till her kingdom reached to the sea in the south and the west." Likewise, she led her armies as far as [[Kwararafa]] and [[Nupe Kingdom|Nupe]] and, according to the Kano Chronicle, "The Sarkin Nupe sent her (i.e. the princess) 40 eunuchs and 10,000 kola nuts."

From 1804-1808, the [[Fulani]], another Islamic African ethnic group that spanned West Africa and shared the area with the Hausa, invaded the Hausa states, starting with [[Gobir]] under the leadership of [[Sheikh]] [[Usman Dan Fodio]]. He declared Jihad on the traditional [[wikt:Habe|Habe]] dynasty kings for their alleged greed, paganism, injustices against the peasant class, use of heavy taxation and violation of the standards of Sharia law. The Fulani and Hausa cultural similarities as a Sahelian people however allowed for significant integration between the two groups. When the Fulani took over the Hausa city-state of Kano during the expansion of the Sokoto Caliphate, the new emirs ended up speaking the Hausa language instead of Fulfulde over the years. Since the early 20th century, these peoples are often classified as "[[Hausa-Fulani]]" within [[Nigeria]] rather than as individuated groups. In fact a large number of Fulani living in Hausa regions cannot speak Fulfulde at all and speak Hausa as their first language. Many Fulani in the region do not distinguish themselves from the Hausa, as they have long intermarried, they share the Islamic religion and many integrated into Hausa culture.
&lt;ref name="nhm"/&gt;

British General [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Frederick Lugard]] used rivalries between many of the emirs in the south and the central Sokoto administration to prevent any defence as he worked toward the capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Africa: 1870-1905|year=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=London|pages=276}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the British approached the city of Sokoto, the new Sultan [[Muhammadu Attahiru I]] organised a quick defence of the city and fought the advancing British-led forces.  The British forces won, sending Attahiru I and thousands of followers on a [[Mahdi]]st ''[[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]]''.&lt;ref name=Falola-2&gt;{{cite book|last=Falola|first=Toyin|title=Colonialism and Violence in Nigeria|year=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 1903 at the grand market square of Sokoto, the last Vizier of the Caliphate officially conceded to British Rule. The British appointed [[Muhammadu Attahiru II]] as the new Caliph.&lt;ref name=Falola-2 /&gt;  Lugard abolished the Caliphate, but retained the title ''Sultan'' as a symbolic position in the newly organised [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]].&lt;ref name=Falola&gt;{{cite book|last=Falola|first=Toyin|title=Historical Dictionary of Nigeria|year=2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Md}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1903, the British defeated the remaining forces of Attahiru I and killed him; by 1906 resistance to British rule had ended.  The area of the Sokoto Caliphate was divided among the control of the British, French, and Germans under the terms of their [[Berlin Conference]].

The British established the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate]] to govern the region, which included most of the Sokoto empire and its most important emirates.&lt;ref&gt;Moses E. Ochonu, ''[http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=807077 Colonialism by Proxy, Hausa Imperial Agents and Middle Belt Consciousness in Nigeria]'', Indiana University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Lugard, the various emirs were provided significant local autonomy, thus retaining much of the political organisation of the Sokoto Caliphate.&lt;ref name=Hirshfield&gt;{{cite book

But, the Sultan of Sokoto continued to be regarded as an important Muslim spiritual and religious position; the lineage connection to dan Fodio has continued to be recognised.&lt;ref name=Falola /&gt; One of the most significant Sultans was [[Siddiq Abubakar III]], who held the position for 50 years from 1938-1988.  He was known as a stabilising force in Nigerian politics, particularly in 1966 after the assassination of [[Ahmadu Bello]], the Premier of Northern Nigeria.&lt;ref name=Falola /&gt;

Following the construction of the [[Rail transport in Nigeria|Nigerian railway system]], which extended from [[Lagos]] in 1896 to [[Ibadan]] in 1900 and [[Kano]] in 1911, the Hausa of northern Nigeria became major producers of groundnuts. They surprised the British, who had expected the Hausa to turn to cotton production. However, the Hausa had sufficient agricultural expertise to realise cotton required more labour and the European prices offered for groundnuts were more attractive than those for cotton. "Within two years the peasant farmers of Hausaland were producing so many tonnes of groundnuts that the railway was unable to cope with the traffic. As a result, the European merchants in Kano had to stockpile sacks of groundnuts in the streets." (Shillington 338).

The [[Boko alphabet|Boko]] script was imposed on the Hausa by the British and French colonial forces and made the official Hausa alphabet in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Dalby | first=Andrew | authorlink=Andrew Dalby | title=Dictionary of languages: the definitive reference to more than 400 languages | year=1998 | publisher=Columbia University Press | location=New York  | isbn=0-231-11568-7 | pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boko is a [[Latin script|Latin alphabet]] used to write  the [[Hausa language]].

Nevertheless, the Hausa remain preeminent in [[Niger]] and [[Northern Nigeria]].

==Genetics==
[[File:Hausa harpist.jpg|thumb|150px|A Hausa [[xalam|gurmi]] harpist]]
According to a Y-DNA study by Hassan et al. (2008), about 47% of Hausa in [[Niger]], [[Cameroon]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Sudan]] carry the [[West Eurasian]] [[haplogroup]] [[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)|R1b]]. The remainder belong to various African paternal lineages: 15.6% [[Haplogroup B (Y-DNA)|B]], 12.5% [[Haplogroup A (Y-DNA)|A]] and 12.5% [[Haplogroup E1b1a (Y-DNA)|E1b1a]]. A small minority of around 4% are [[Haplogroup E1b1b (Y-DNA)|E1b1b]] clade bearers, a haplogroup which is most common in [[North Africa]] and the [[Horn of Africa]].&lt;ref name="Hassan"&gt;Hassan, Hisham Y. et al. 2008 [http://ychrom.invint.net/upload/iblock/94d/Hassan%202008%20Y-Chromosome%20Variation%20Among%20Sudanese.pdf "Y-Chromosome Variation Among Sudanese: Restricted Gene Flow, Concordance With Language, Geography, and History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160923031520/http://ychrom.invint.net/upload/iblock/94d/Hassan%202008%20Y-Chromosome%20Variation%20Among%20Sudanese.pdf |date=2016-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of overall ancestry, an autosomal DNA study by Tishkoff et al. (2009) found the Hausa to be most closely related to [[Nilotic peoples|Nilotic]] populations from [[Nigeria]], [[Cameroon]], central [[Chad]] and [[South Sudan]]. This suggests that the Hausa and other modern Chadic-speaking populations originally spoke [[Nilo-Saharan languages]], before adopting languages from the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] family after migration into that area thousands of years ago.&lt;ref name="Tishkoff"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Williams | title = The Genetic Structure and History of Africans and African Americans | journal = Science | year = 2009 | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1172257 | bibcode = 2009Sci...324.1035T | first = Floyd A. | volume = 324 | pages = 1035–44 | doi = 10.1126/science.1172257 | issue = 5930 | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"''From K = 5-13, all Nilo-Saharan speaking populations from Kenya, Tanzania, southern Sudan, and Chad cluster with west-central Afroasiatic Chadic-speaking populations (Fig. S15). These results are consistent with linguistic and archeological data, suggesting a possible common ancestry of Nilo-Saharan speaking populations from an eastern Sudanese homeland within the past ~10,500 years, with subsequent bi-directional migration westward to Lake Chad and southward into modern day southern Sudan, and more recent migration eastward into Kenya and Tanzania ~3,000 ya (giving rise to Southern Nilotic speakers) and westward into Chad ~2,500 ya (giving rise to Central Sudanic speakers) (S62, S65, S67, S74). A proposed migration of proto-Chadic Afroasiatic speakers ~7,000 ya from the central Sahara into the [[Lake Chad Basin]] may have caused many western Nilo-Saharans to shift to Chadic languages (S99). Our data suggest that this shift was not accompanied by large amounts of Afroasiatic16 gene flow. Analyses of mtDNA provide evidence for divergence ~8,000 ya of a distinct mtDNA lineage present at high frequency in the Chadic populations and suggest an East African origin for most mtDNA lineages in these populations (S100)''."&lt;ref name="Tishkoff"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Hausa language]] has more first-language speakers than any other [[Languages of Africa|African language]]. It has an estimated 67 million first-language speakers, and close to 50 million second-language speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Nationalencyklopedin "Världens 100 största språk 2007" (The World's 100 Largest Languages in 2007), ''[[SIL Ethnologue]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The main Hausa-speaking area is northern Nigeria and Niger. Hausa is also widely spoken in northern Ghana, Cameroon, Chad, [[Sudanese Hausa]] in Sudan and the Ivory Coast among [[Fulani]], [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Gur people|Gur]], [[Shuwa Arab]], and other [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] speaking groups.

There are also large Hausa communities in every major African city in neighbourhoods called ''zango''s or ''zongo''s, meaning "camel-caravan camp" in Hausa (denoting the [[trade|trading post]] origins of these communities). Most Hausa speakers, regardless of ethnic affiliation, are [[Muslims]]; Hausa often serves as a [[lingua franca]] among Muslims in non-Hausa areas.

There is a large and growing printed literature in Hausa, which includes novels, poetry, plays, instruction in Islamic practice, books on development issues, newspapers, news magazines, and technical academic works. Radio and television broadcasting in Hausa is ubiquitous in northern Nigeria and Niger, and radio stations in Cameroon have regular Hausa broadcasts, as do international broadcasters such as the BBC, VOA, Deutsche Welle, Radio Moscow, Radio Beijing, RFI France, IRIB Iran, and others.

Hausa is used as the language of instruction at the elementary level in schools in northern Nigeria, and Hausa is available as course of study in northern Nigerian universities. In addition, several advanced degrees (Masters and PhD) are offered in Hausa in various universities in the UK, US, and Germany. Hausa is also being used in various social media networks around the world.

Hausa is considered one of the world's major languages, and it has widespread use in a number of countries of Africa. Hausa's rich poetry, prose, and musical literature, is increasingly available in print and in audio and video recordings. The study of Hausa provides an informative entry into the culture of [[Islam]]ic Africa. Throughout Africa, there is a strong connection between Hausa and Islam.

The influence of the Hausa language on the languages of many non-Hausa Muslim peoples in African is readily apparent. Likewise, many Hausa cultural practices, including such overt features as dress and food, are shared by other Muslim communities. Because of the dominant position which the Hausa language and culture have long held, the study of Hausa provides crucial background for other areas such as African history, politics (particularly in Nigeria and Niger), gender studies, commerce, and the arts.

=== Religion ===
[[File:Gobarau Minaret Katsina.JPG|thumb|150px|The 15th-century Gobarau [[minaret]] in [[Katsina]]]]

[[Sunni]] Islam of the [[Maliki]] [[madhhab]] is the predominant and historically established religion of the Hausa people. Sizable but visible minorities of Muslims belonging to the [[Tijani]], [[Mouride]] and [[Qadiri]] [[sufi]] [[tariqa]]s, and more recently, [[Shia]] and [[Salafi]] groups. Islam has been present in [[Hausaland]] as early as the 11th century. The Islamic population grew as the religion was brought by traders and Islamic preachers from North Africa, Borno, [[Mali]] and Guinea.

[[Muslim scholars]] of the early 19th century disapproved of the hybrid religion practised in royal courts. A desire for reform contributed to the formation of the [[Sokoto Caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, David, ''Muslim Societies in African History'' (Cambridge, 2004), p141&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of this state strengthened Islam in rural areas. The Hausa people have been an important factor for the spread of Islam in West Africa. Today, the current [[Sultan of Sokoto]] is regarded as the traditional religious leader (''Sarkin Musulmi'') of Sunni Hausa-Fulani in Nigeria and beyond.

[[Maguzawa]], the [[African Traditional Religion]], was practised extensively before Islam. In the more remote areas of Hausaland, the people continue to practise Maguzawa. Closer to urban areas, it is not as common, but with elements still held among the beliefs of urban dwellers. Practices include the sacrifice of animals for personal ends, but it is not legitimate to practise Maguzawa magic for harm. People of urbanised areas tend to retain a "cult of [[spirit possession]]," known as [[Bori (religion)|Bori]]. It incorporates the old religion's elements of [[African Traditional Religion]] and [[Magic and religion|magic]].&lt;ref&gt;Adeline Masquelier. ''Prayer Has Spoiled Everything: Possession, Power, and Identity in an Islamic Town of Niger''. Duke University Press (2001) {{ISBN|978-0-8223-2639-7}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A small Christian minority also exists among the Hausa.

=== Clothing ===
[[File:Four Hausa Gun Carriers of the South Nigerian Regiment by Sir (John) Benjamin Stone cropped.jpg|right|thumb|Four Hausa gun carriers of the South Nigerian Regiment in traditional clothing (1902 photo by [[John Benjamin Stone]])]]
The traditional dress of the Hausa consists of loose flowing gowns and trousers. The gowns have wide openings on both sides for ventilation. The trousers are loose at the top and center, but rather tight around the legs. Leather sandals and turbans are also typical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/12070/GH|title=Hausa in Ghana|last=|first=|date=|website=Joshua Project|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The men are easily recognizable because of their elaborate dress which is a large flowing gown known as ''Babban riga'' and a robe called a Doguwar riga (see [[Senegalese kaftan]]). These large flowing gowns usually feature elaborate embroidery designs around the neck and chest area. (See accompanying image to the right).

Men also wear colourful embroidered caps known as ''hula.'' Depending on their location and occupation, they may wear the turban around this to veil the face. The women can be identified by [[wrapper (clothing)|wrappers]] called ''zani,'' made with colourful cloth known as ''atampa or Ankara'', (a descendant of early designs from the famous tie-dye techniques the Hausa have for centuries been known for [[Tie-dye]]) accompanied by a matching blouse, head tie and shawl.

The Hausa were famous throughout the Middle Ages; they were often characterized by their [[Indigo]] blue dressing and emblems which earned them the nickname "bluemen". They traditionally rode on fine Saharan [[camels]] and [[Arabian horses|horses]].

=== Architecture ===
{{main article|Sudano-Sahelian architecture}}
[[File:Kanogate2.jpg|thumb|The gate to the Emir of [[Zaria|Zaria's]] palace]]

Hausa architecture (known as ''Tubali'' in the Hausa language) is a distinct sub-style among the various [[Sudano-Sahelian architecture|Sudano-Sahelian]] architectural styles found throughout the [[Sahel]]-geographic band stretching from Senegal and Mauritania in the West to Sudan in the east.

Hausa buildings are characterized by the use of dry mud bricks in cubic structures, multi-storied buildings for the social elite, the use of [[parapets]] related to their military/fortress building past, and traditional white stucco and plaster for house fronts. At times the facades may be decorated with various abstract relief designs, sometimes painted in vivid colours to convey information about the occupant.

=== Food ===
[[File:"Kilishi".JPG|right|thumb|[[Kilishi]], a Hausa delicacy similar to [[jerky]]]]
The most common food that the Hausa people prepare consists of [[Cereal|grains]], such as [[sorghum]], [[millet]], [[rice]], or  [[maize]], which are ground into flour for a variety of different kinds of dishes. This food is popularly known as ''tuwo'' in the Hausa language.

Usually, breakfast consists of [[cakes]] made from ground beans and fried, known as ''kosai''; or made from wheat flour soaked for a day, fried and served with sugar, known as ''funkaso''. Both of these cakes can be served with [[porridge]] and [[sugar]] known as ''kunu'' or ''koko''. Lunch or dinner usually feature a heavy porridge with soup and stew known as ''tuwo da miya''. The soup and stew are usually prepared with ground or chopped [[tomato]]es, [[onion]]s, and local spices.

Spices and other vegetables, such as [[spinach]], [[pumpkin]], or [[okra]], are added to the soup during preparation. The stew is prepared with meat, which can include goat or cow meat, but not pork, due to Islamic food restrictions. [[Beans]], [[peanut]]s, and [[milk]] are also served as a complementary [[protein]] diet for the Hausa people.

The most famous of all Hausa food is most likely [[Suya]], a spicy [[shish kebab]] like skewered meat which is a popular food item in various parts of Nigeria and is enjoyed as a delicacy in much of [[West Africa]] and balangu of gasshi.

A dried version of Suya is called [[Kilishi]].&lt;ref name="Raw Story-2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Agence France-Presse|title=Nigerian roadside barbecue shacks thrive in the midst of Islamist insurgency|url=http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2012/05/22/nigerian-roadside-barbecue-shacks-thrive-in-the-midst-of-islamist-insurgency/|accessdate=5 April 2014|newspaper=The Raw Story|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
[[File:Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony 07.png|thumb|Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony 07|Hausa Tribal Hunter's Ceremony]]
A modern literary movement led by female Hausa writers has grown since the late 1980s when writer [[Balaraba Ramat Yakubu]] came to popularity. In time, the writers spurred a unique genre known as Kano market literature — so named because the books are often self-published and sold in the markets of Nigeria. [[Islamic extremism]] and [[misogyny]] have hindered women's ability to work and write openly. However, the subversive nature of these novels, which are often romantic and family dramas that are otherwise hard to find in the Hausa language, have made them popular, especially among female readers. The genre is also referred to as ''littattafan soyayya'', or "love literature."&lt;ref&gt;Laura Mallonee, [https://www.wired.com/2016/02/glenna-gordon-diagram-heart/ The Subversive Women Who Self-Publish Novels Amid Jihadist War], Wired, 17 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hausa symbolism===
A proposed Hausa [[ethnic flag]] is a banner with five horizontal stripes—from top to bottom they are red, yellow, indigo blue, green, and khaki beige.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fotw.us/Flags/ng%7Dhausa.html#nr|title=Hausa ethnic flag|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130313025512/http://www.fotw.us/Flags/ng%7Dhausa.html|archivedate=13 March 2013|deadurl=yes|accessdate=25 April 2017|website=www.fotw.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; The older and traditionally established motif of Hausa identity, the [[eternal knot]] in a star shape, is used in historic architecture, design and embroidery.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8203">'''Heino F. L. Meyer-Bahlburg''' (born 1940) is a [[Germany|German]]-born [[psychologist]] best known for his work on [[biology of sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[intersexuality]], and [[HIV]].

==Education and career==

Meyer-Bahlburg earned his [[Diplom]] from [[University of Hamburg]] in 1966 and his [[Doctor of Science|Dr. rer. nat.]] in [[Psychology]] from [[University of Düsseldorf]] in 1970. He took a position at [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York, Buffalo]] and at Children’s Hospital in Buffalo, New York in 1970. Since 1977 he has held appointments at [[New York State Psychiatric Institute]] and [[Columbia University]] where he has been Professor of Clinical Psychology since 1990. In 1978, he took a position at [[New York Presbyterian Hospital]] and has been a Full Professional Psychologist there since 1990. Since 1987, he has been affiliated with the HIV Center for Clinical and Behavioral Studies.

Meyer-Bahlburg believes [[homosexuality]] may be an issue of brain chemistry.&lt;ref name="kotulak"&gt;Kotulak, Ron (November 17, 2003). Homosexuality may be issue of brain chemistry. ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He has observed that women who took the synthetic estrogen [[Diethylstilbestrol]] when pregnant were more likely to have daughters with [[bisexual]] or homosexual tendencies.&lt;ref name="stlouis"&gt;Staff report (February 5, 1995). Estrogen medication linked to homosexual tendencies. ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]''&lt;/ref&gt; His research interests include the effect of biological factors, medical treatments, gender assignment, and rearing conditions in the development of gender-related behavior, temperament, [[sexual orientation]], and [[gender identity]] in various forms of [[intersexuality]]. He has published on the effect of genital ambiguity and genital surgery on later sexual functioning in 46,XX [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]]. Meyer-Bahlburg published with [[John Money]] and others on the topic of [[psychoneuroendocrinology]] and its effects on sexual orientation and gender identity. In collaboration with [[Maria New]], Meyer-Bahlburg published a long term analysis of the psychological effects of the use of prenatal dexamethasone to treat Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia.

Meyer-Bahlburg served on the [[American Psychiatric Association]] [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-III]] Gender Identity Disorder Committee, and the DSM-IV Subcommittee on Gender Identity Disorders.&lt;ref name="bradley1991"&gt;[[Susan Bradley|Bradley SJ]], [[Ray Blanchard|Blanchard R]], [[Susan Coates|Coates SW]], [[Richard Green (sexologist)|Green R]], [[Stephen B. Levine|Levine SB]], Meyer-Bahlburg HFL, [[Ira Pauly|Pauly IB]], [[Kenneth Zucker|Zucker KJ]] (1991). Interim report of the DSM-IV Subcommittee on Gender Identity Disorders. ''[[Archives of Sexual Behavior]]'' Volume 20, Number 4 / August, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; He was also Adviser to the Sexual Disorder Text Revision Work Group for DSM-IV-TR. He treats [[gender identity disorder in children]], taking about ten cases a year in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Osborne1997"&gt;Osborne, Duncan (October 28, 1997). An Attack On Our Most Vulnerable: The Use and Abuse of Gender Identity Disorder. ''Lesbian and Gay New York''&lt;/ref&gt; He has written that gender identity depends largely on postnatal environmental influences, while sex-dimorphic behavior and temperamental sex differences appear to be modified by prenatal sex hormones.&lt;ref name="ehrhardt"&gt;AA Ehrhardt and HF Meyer-Bahlburg (March 1981). Effects of prenatal sex hormones on gender-related behavior. ''Science'' 20 March 1981: Vol. 211. no. 4488, pp. 1312–1318&lt;/ref&gt; Meyer-Bahlburg notes that when parents bring in children for treatment, the “basic fear in this homophobic country is usually homosexuality."&lt;ref name="Osborne1997"/&gt;

His research interests in the field of HIV include psychosexual assessment, development and determinants of sexual risk behavior, and the effects of HIV on sexual functioning.

Meyer-Bahlburg was President of the [[International Academy of Sex Research]] from 1990 to 1991 and since 2002 has served on the Committee on Intersexuality for the [[Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association]].

[[File:Perseo in Villa San Marco Stabiae.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Perseus and the head of Medusa in a Roman fresco at [[Stabiae]]. Unlike medieval and modern heroes, classical heroes did great deeds out of esteem and fame rather than out of any concern for the good of people]]

A '''hero''' (masculine) or '''heroine''' (feminine) is a real person or a main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through feats of [[ingenuity]], [[bravery]] or [[Physical strength|strength]]; the original hero type of classical epics did such things for the sake of glory and honor. On the other hand are [[Medieval]] and [[modern history|modern]] heroes, who perform great deeds for the common good instead of the classical goal of pride and fame.

The concept of the hero can be found in [[classical literature]]. It is the main or revered character in [[Epic poetry|heroic epic poetry]] celebrated through ancient legends of a people, often striving for military conquest and living by a continually flawed personal honor code.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Encyclopedia - Britannica Online Encyclopedia|url = http://academic.eb.com/EBchecked/topic/263398/hero|website = academic.eb.com|accessdate = 2015-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of a hero has changed throughout time. [[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam Webster]] dictionary defines a hero as "a person who is admired for great or brave acts or fine qualities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hero|title=Definition of HERO|website=www.merriam-webster.com|accessdate=2 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of heroes range from mythological figures, such as [[Gilgamesh]], [[Achilles]] and [[Iphigenia]], to historical figures, such as [[Joan of Arc]] or [[Sophie Scholl]], modern heroes like [[Alvin York]], [[Audie Murphy]] and [[Chuck Yeager]], and fictional [[superheroes]], including [[Superman]] and [[Batman]].

==Etymology==
The word ''hero'' comes from the Greek ἥρως (''hērōs''), "hero" (literally "protector" or "defender"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=hero|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly one such as [[Heracles]] with divine ancestry or later given divine honors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dh%28%2Frws ἥρως]
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library&lt;/ref&gt; Before the decipherment of [[Linear B]] the original form of the word was assumed to be *{{lang|grc|ἥρωϝ-}}, ''hērōw-'', but the Mycenaean compound ''ti-ri-se-ro-e'' demonstrates the absence of -w-.

According to the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', the [[Proto-Indo-European]] root is ''*ser'' meaning "to protect". According to Eric Partridge in ''Origins,'' the Greek word  ''Hērōs'' "is akin to" the Latin ''seruāre,'' meaning ''to safeguard''. Partridge concludes, "The basic sense of both [[Hera]] and hero would therefore be 'protector'." [[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]] rejects an Indo-European derivation and asserts that the word has a [[Pre-Greek]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S. P. Beekes|R. S. P. Beekes]], ''Etymological Dictionary of Greek'', Brill, 2009, p. 526.&lt;/ref&gt;

A classical hero is considered to be a "warrior who lives and dies in the pursuit of honor" and asserts their greatness by "the brilliancy and efficiency with which they kill".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Each classical hero's life focuses on fighting, which occurs in war or during an epic quest. Classical heroes are commonly semi-divine and extraordinarily gifted, like [[Achilles]], evolving into heroic characters through their perilous circumstances.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; While these heroes are incredibly resourceful and skilled, they are often foolhardy, court disaster, risk their followers' lives for trivial matters, and behave arrogantly in a childlike manner.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; During classical times, people regarded heroes with the highest esteem and utmost importance, explaining their prominence within epic literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Levin | first1 = Saul | year = 1984 | title = Love and the Hero of the Iliad | url = | journal = Transactions and Proceedings of the American Philological Association | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 43–50 | doi=10.2307/283510| jstor = 283510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The appearance of these mortal figures marks a revolution of audiences and writers turning away from [[Twelve Olympians|immortal gods]] to mortal mankind, whose heroic moments of glory survive in the memory of their descendants, extending their legacy.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

[[Hector]] was a [[Troy|Trojan]] prince and the greatest fighter for Troy in the [[Trojan War]], which is known primarily through [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Iliad]]''. Hector acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defense of Troy, "killing 31,000 Greek fighters," offers Hyginus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hyginus]], ''[[Fabulae]]'' 115.&lt;/ref&gt; Hector was known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, Homer places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. However, his familial values conflict greatly with his heroic aspirations in ''The Iliad,'' as he cannot be both the protector of [[Troy]] and a father to his child.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hector is ultimately betrayed by the gods when [[Athena]] appears disguised as his ally [[Deiphobus]] and convinces him to take on Achilles, leading to his death at the hands of a superior warrior.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Homer. ''The Iliad.'' Trans. Robert Fagles (1990). NY: Penguin Books. Chapter 14&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:The_Rage_of_Achilles,_by_Giovanni_Battista_Tiepolo_(1696-1770),_Italian_Rococo_painter.jpg|thumb|An 18th century depiction of ''The Rage of Achilles'', by [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]]|302x302px]][[Achilles]] was a Greek Hero who was considered the most formidable military fighter in the entire Trojan War and the central character of ''The Iliad.'' He was the child of [[Thetis]] and [[Peleus]], making him a [[Demigod|demi-god]]. He wielded superhuman strength on the battlefield and was blessed with a close relationship to the [[Greek gods|Gods]]. Achilles famously refuses to fight after his dishonoring at the hands of Agamemnon, and only returns to the war due to unadulterated rage after Hector kills his close friend [[Patroclus]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Achilles was known for uncontrollable rage that defined many of his bloodthirsty actions, such as defiling Hector's corpse by dragging it around the city of Troy. Achilles plays a tragic role in ''The Iliad'' brought about by constant [https://books.google.com/books?id=5TFUv2VRKd8C&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=achilles+dehumanization&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5D2sb_hGx_&amp;sig=iJrfJQdt0VhRVG2iJoRf-Nc6oqA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwje8uWTosvJAhWGyT4KHZE7BUoQ6AEIJTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=achilles%20dehumanization&amp;f=false de-humanization] throughout the epic, having his ''menis'' (wrath) overpower his ''philos'' (love).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Mortal Hero: An Introduction to Homer's Iliad|last = Schein|first = Seth|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1984|isbn = |location = |pages = 58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heroes in myth often had close but conflicted relationships with the gods. Thus Heracles's name means "the glory of [[Hera]]", even though he was tormented all his life by Hera, the Queen of the Gods. Perhaps the most striking example is the Athenian king [[Erechtheus]], whom [[Poseidon]] killed for choosing [[Athena]] over him as the city's patron god. When the Athenians worshiped Erechtheus on the [[Acropolis of Athens|Acropolis]], they invoked him as ''Poseidon  Erechtheus''.

[[Destiny|Fate]], or destiny, plays a massive role in the stories of classical heroes. The classical hero's heroic significance stems from battlefield conquests, an inherently dangerous action.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The gods in [[Greek mythology|Greek Mythology]], when interacting with the heroes, often foreshadow the hero's eventual death on the battlefield. Countless heroes and gods go to great lengths to alter their  pre-destined fate, but with no success, as no immortal can change their prescribed outcomes by the [[Fates|three Fates]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.auburn.wednet.edu/cms/lib03/WA01001938/Centricity/Domain/2205/Fate%20reading.pdf|title = Articles and musing on the concept of Fate for the ancient Greeks|date = |accessdate = |website = Auburn University|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most prominent example of this is found in ''[[Oedipus Rex]].'' After learning that his son, [[Oedipus]], will end up killing him, the King of Thebes, [[Laius]], takes huge steps to assure his son's death by removing him from the kingdom. But, Oedipus slays his father without an afterthought when he unknowingly encounters him in a dispute on the road many years later. The lack of recognition enabled Oedipus to slay his father, ironically further binding his father to his fate.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Stories of heroism may serve as [[moral example]]s. However, classical heroes often didn't embody the Christian notion of an upstanding, perfectly moral hero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Four Conceptions of the Heroic|url = http://www.fellowshipofreason.com/archives/4heroes.htm|website = www.fellowshipofreason.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Achilles's character-issues of hateful rage lead to merciless slaughter and his overwhelming pride lead to him only joining the Trojan War because he didn't want his soldiers to win all of the glory. Classical heroes, regardless of their morality, were placed in religion. In [[classical antiquity]], cults that venerated deified heroes such as [[Heracles]], [[Perseus]], and [[Achilles]] played an important role in Ancient Greek religion.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Graf, Fritz. (2006) "Hero Cult." ''Brills New Pauly.'' Retrieved from http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/brill-s-new-pauly/hero-cult-e511460?s.num=1&amp;s.f.s2_parent=s.f.book.brill-s-new-pauly&amp;s.q=hero.&lt;/ref&gt; These ancient [[Greek hero cult]]s worshipped heroes from oral [[Epic Cycle|epic tradition]], with these heroes often bestowing blessings, especially healing ones, on individuals.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Myth and monomyth==
[[File:JourneytotheWest.jpg|right|300px|thumb|The four heroes from the 16th-century Chinese novel ''[[Journey to the West]]'']]
The concept of the "Mythic Hero Archetype" was first developed by [[FitzRoy Somerset, 4th Baron Raglan|Lord Raglan]] in his 1936 book, ''The Hero, A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama''. It is a set of 22 common traits that he said were shared by many heroes in various cultures, myths and religions throughout history and around the world.  Raglan argued that the higher the score, the more likely the figure is mythical.&lt;ref&gt;Lord Raglan. ''The Hero: A Study in Tradition, Myth and Drama by Lord Raglan'', Dover Publications, 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of a story archetype of the standard [[monomyth]]ical "hero's [[quest]]" that was reputed to be pervasive across all cultures is somewhat controversial. Expounded mainly by [[Joseph Campbell]] in his 1949 work ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]'', it illustrates several uniting themes of hero stories that hold similar ideas of what a hero represents, despite vastly different cultures and beliefs. The monomyth or Hero's Journey  consists of three separate stages including the Departure, Initiation, and Return. Within these stages there are several archetypes that the hero or heroine may follow including the call to adventure (which they may initially refuse), supernatural aid, proceeding down a road of trials, achieving a realization about themselves (or an apotheosis), and attaining the freedom to live through their quest or journey. Campbell offered examples of stories with similar themes  such as [[Krishna]], [[Buddha]], [[Apollonius of Tyana]], and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Joseph Campbell in ''The Hero With a Thousand Faces'' Princeton University Press, 2004 [1949], 140, {{ISBN|0-691-11924-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the themes he explores is the androgynous hero, who combines male and female traits, like Bodhisattva: "The first wonder to be noted here is the androgynous character of the Bodhisattva: masculine Avalokiteshvara, feminine Kwan Yin."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In his 1968 book, ''The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology'', Campbell writes "It is clear that, whether accurate or not as to biographical detail, the moving legend of the Crucified and Risen Christ was fit to bring a new warmth, immediacy, and humanity, to the old motifs of the beloved [[Tammuz (deity)|Tammuz]], [[Adonis]], and [[Osiris]] cycles."&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Campbell]]. The Masks of God: Occidental Mythology'' Penguin, reprinted, {{ISBN|0-14-004306-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slavic fairy tales==
[[File:Vasnetsov samolet.jpg|thumb|[[Ivan Tsarevich]], a hero of [[Slavic mythology|Russian folklore]]]]
[[Vladimir Propp]], in his analysis of the Russian [[fairy tale]], concluded that a fairy tale had only eight ''[[dramatis personæ]]'', of which one was the hero,&lt;ref name="Propp"&gt;Vladimir Propp, ''Morphology of the Folk Tale'', {{ISBN|0-292-78376-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|p. 80}} and his analysis has been widely applied to non-Russian folklore. The actions that fall into such a hero's sphere include:
# Departure on a quest
# Reacting to the test of a [[Donor (fairy tale)|donor]]
# Marrying a princess (or similar figure)
Propp distinguished between ''seekers'' and ''victim-heroes''. A [[villain]] could initiate the issue by kidnapping the hero or driving him out; these were victim-heroes. On the other hand, an antagonist could rob the hero, or kidnap someone close to him, or, without the villain's intervention, the hero could realize that he lacked something and set out to find it; these heroes are seekers. Victims may appear in tales with seeker heroes, but the tale does not follow them both.&lt;ref name="Propp" /&gt;{{Rp|36}}

==Historical studies==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Philosophy of history]] --&gt;
{{Further information|Philosophy of history|Great man theory}}
No history can be written without consideration of the lengthy list of [[List of medals for bravery|recipients of national medals for bravery]], populated by firefighters, policemen and policewomen, ambulance medics and ordinary have-a-go heroes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/12/25/1040511087609.html smh.com.au: "Everyday heroes"], 26 Dec 2002&lt;/ref&gt; These persons risked their lives to try to save or protect the lives of others: for example, the Canadian [[Cross of Valour (Canada)|Cross of Valour (C.V.)]] "recognizes acts of the most conspicuous courage in circumstances of extreme peril";&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gg.ca/document.aspx?id=13503 gg.ca: "Decorations for Bravery Ceremony"], 2 Feb 2010&lt;/ref&gt; examples of recipients are [[Mary Dohey]] and [[David Gordon Cheverie]].

The philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] gave a central role to the "hero", personalized by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], as the incarnation of a particular culture's ''[[Volksgeist]]'', and thus of the general ''[[Zeitgeist]]''. [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s 1841 ''On Heroes, Hero Worship and the Heroic in History'' also accorded a key function to heroes and great men in history. Carlyle centered history on the [[biography]] of a few central individuals such as [[Oliver Cromwell]] or [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]]. His heroes were political and military figures, the founders or topplers of states. His history of great men included geniuses good and, perhaps for the first time in historical study, evil.

Explicit defenses of Carlyle's position were rare in the second part of the 20th century. Most in the [[philosophy of history]] school contend that the motive forces in history can best be described only with a wider lens than the one that Carlyle used for his portraits. For example, [[Karl Marx]] argued that history was determined by the massive social forces at play in "[[class struggle]]s", not by the individuals by whom these forces are played out. After Marx, [[Herbert Spencer]] wrote at the end of the 19th century: "You must admit that the genesis of the great man depends on the long series of complex influences which has produced the race in which he appears, and the social state into which that race has slowly grown....Before he can remake his society, his society must make him."&lt;ref name=Spencer&gt;Spencer, Herbert. ''[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=96277756  The Study of Sociology]'', Appleton, 1896, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michel Foucault]] argued in [[Philosophy of history#Michel Foucault's analysis of historical and political discourse|his analysis of societal communication and debate]] that history was mainly the "science of the [[Sovereignty|sovereign]]", until its inversion by the "historical and political popular discourse".

[[File:Mandela Bust at Southbank.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bust of Nelson Mandela erected on London's [[South Bank]] by the [[Greater London Council]] administration of [[Ken Livingstone]] in 1985]]

Modern examples of the typical hero are  [[Minnie Vautrin]], [[Norman Bethune]],  [[Alan Turing]], [[Raoul Wallenberg]], [[Chiune Sugihara]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Mother Teresa]], [[Nelson Mandela]], [[Oswaldo Paya]], [[Oscar Biscet]], and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].

The [[Annales School]], led by [[Lucien Febvre]], [[Marc Bloch]] and [[Fernand Braudel]], would contest the exaggeration of the role of [[subject (philosophy)|individual subjects]] in history. Indeed, Braudel distinguished various time scales, one accorded to the life of an individual, another accorded to the life of a few human generations, and the last one to [[civilization]]s, in which [[geography]], [[economics]] and [[demography]] play a role considerably more decisive than that of individual subjects.

Among noticeable events in the studies of the role of the hero and [[Great men theory|Great man]] in history one should mention [[Sydney Hook]]'s book (1943) ''[[Sidney Hook#The Hero in History|The Hero in History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hook, S. 1955 [1943]. The Hero in History. A Study in Limitation and Possibility. Boston, MA: Beacon Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In the second half of the twentieth century such male-focused theory has been contested, among others by feminists writers such as [[Judith Fetterley]] in ''The Resisting Reader'' (1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Resisting Reader|last = Fetterley|first = Judith|publisher = Indiana University Press|year = 1977|isbn = |location = Bloomington, IN|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and literary theorist [[Nancy K. Miller]], ''The Heroine's Text: Readings in the French and English Novel, 1722–1782''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Heroine's Text: Readings in the French and English Novel, 1722–1782|last = Miller|first = Nancy K.|publisher = Columbia University Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the epoch of [[globalization]] an individual can still change the development of the country and of the whole world so this gives reasons to some scholars to suggest returning to the problem of the role of the hero in history from the viewpoint of modern historical knowledge and using up-to-date methods of historical analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leonid Grinin|Grinin, Leonid]]  2010.

Within the frameworks of developing [[counterfactual history]], attempts are made to examine some hypothetical scenarios of historical development. The hero attracts much attention because most of those scenarios are based on the suppositions: what would have happened if this or that historical individual had or had not been alive.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson.

== Gender differences ==
If the term "heroine" exists,{{clarify|reason=|date=September 2018}} "hero" is often the predominantly used term even though its neutrality can be put into question. The definitions of the heroine often refer back to the one of the hero, but sometimes insinuate that their deeds are of less value, or were obtained only thanks to their love of God or a country or of a man. Therefore, implying that an external explanation for the extraordinary nature of her deeds is needed to justify them. The warrior women is considered unholy, unnatural. These figures tend to be erased because they don't fit in the feminine values they are supposed to represent.
Acts of heroism coming from women are acceptable, during specific time, like when men are at war, during times of crisis, but they are otherwise often seen as suspicious. Moreover, women are often not individualized, but praised as a group for heroic deeds. [[Women in the military]] were often subordinated to tasks less likely to be praised than armed combat, and are rather praised for their courage as a general force, nurses during wartime are a good example of this phenomenon.
If their story gets told, they are made to fit in the acceptable script. Their story is told in a way as to match the expectations of [[femininity]] ex: maternal love, compassion, fidelity, resistance, defense. Etc. So the set of strengths in which a heroine could historically express her value are overall not the same and perceived as less valuable than their [[masculine]] counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;

If they get mentioned in history, the way their story is told also differs from their male counterpart, they are generally portrayed as young and beautiful, their actions are limited to a short time
lapse in opposition to the possibility of a long heroic career for male heroes, underlying feelings that led to their heroic acts are underlined, overall less details about their life are kept and
emphasis is put over their tragic death. Not to forget that heroes and heroines are part of a social construct, their history is told and changes throughout history to serve different purposes of memory, propaganda according to diverse social, political or religious evolutions.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Further information|Vanity Fair (novel)|Superhero}}

[[File:Batman_and_Robin_1966.JPG|thumb|225x225px|[[Batman]] ([[Adam West]]) and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] (Burt Ward) in the 1966–1968 TV Series ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]''.]]
	 
The word "hero" or "heroine", in modern times, is sometimes used to describe the [[protagonist]] or the [[Romantic interest (theatre)|love interest]] of a story, a usage which can conflict with the superhuman expectations of heroism.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; A classic example is [[Anna Karenina]], the lead character in the novel of the same title by [[Leo Tolstoy]]. In modern literature the hero is more and more a problematic concept. In 1848, for example, [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] gave ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' the subtitle ''A Novel without a Hero'', and imagined a world in which no sympathetic character was to be found.&lt;ref&gt;[[Northrop Frye]], ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p. 34, {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Vanity Fair'' is a satirical representation of the absence of truly moral heroes in the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;Shmoop Editorial Team. (2008, November 11). ''Vanity Fair Theme of Morality and Ethics''. Retrieved December 6, 2015, from &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.shmoop.com/vanity-fair-thackeray/morality-ethics-theme.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The story focuses on the characters Emmy Sedley and Becky Sharpe (the latter as the clearly defined anti-hero), with the plot focused on the eventual marriage of these two characters to rich men, revealing character flaws as the story progresses. Even the most sympathetic characters, like Captain Dobbin, are susceptible to weakness, as he is often narcissistic and melancholy.

The larger-than-life hero is a more common feature of [[fantasy]] (particularly in [[Comic book|comic-books]] and [[High fantasy|epic fantasy]]) than more realist works.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;[[L. Sprague de Camp]], ''[[Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers]]:  The Makers of Heroic Fantasy'', p. 5 {{ISBN|0-87054-076-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these larger-than life figures remain prevalent in society. The [[superhero]] genre is a multibillion-dollar industry that includes comic books, movies, toys and video games. Superheroes usually possess extraordinary talents and powers that no living human could ever emulate. The superhero stories often pit a [[Supervillain|super villain]] against the hero, with the hero fighting the crime caused by the super villain. Examples of long-running superheroes include [[Superman]], [[Batman]], [[Spider-Man]] and [[Wonder Woman]].

==Psychology==
[[Social psychology]] has begun paying attention to heroes and heroism. Zeno Franco and [[Philip Zimbardo]] point out differences between heroism and altruism, and they offer evidence that observers' perceptions of unjustified risk plays a role above and beyond risk type in determining the ascription of heroic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Franco | first1 = Z. | last2 = Blau | first2 = K. | last3 = Zimbardo | first3 = P. | year = 2011 | title = Heroism: A conceptual analysis and differentiation between heroic action and altruism | url = http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2011-07260-001/ | journal = Review of General Psychology | volume = 5 | issue = 2| pages = 99–113 | doi=10.1037/a0022672| citeseerx = 10.1.1.366.8315 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for heroic risk-taking is that it is a [[costly signal]] demonstrating the ability of the hero. It can be seen as one form of [[altruism]] for which there are also several other evolutionary explanations.&lt;ref name=AEP1&gt;Pat Barcaly. The evolution of charitable behaviour and the power of reputation. In {{Cite book | last1 = Roberts | first1 = S.

Roma Chatterji has suggested that the hero or more generally protagonist is first and foremost a symbolic representation of the person who is experiencing the story while reading, listening or watching;&lt;ref name=Chatterji&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chatterji|first=Roma|date=January 1986|title=The Voyage of the Hero: The Self and the Other in One Narrative Tradition of Purulia|journal=Contributions to Indian Sociology|issue=19|pages=95–114|doi=10.1177/006996685019001007|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the relevance of the hero to the individual relies a great deal on how much similarity there is between the two. One reason for the hero-as-self interpretation of stories and myths is the human inability to view the world from any perspective but a personal one.

In the [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning book ''[[The Denial of Death]]'', [[Ernest Becker]] argues that human civilization is ultimately an elaborate, symbolic defense mechanism against the knowledge of our mortality, which in turn acts as the emotional and intellectual response to our basic [[survival mechanism]]. Becker explains that a basic duality in human life exists between the physical world of objects and a symbolic world of human meaning. Thus, since humanity has a dualistic nature consisting of a physical self and a symbolic self, we are able to transcend the [[dilemma]] of mortality through [[heroism]], by focusing our attention mainly on our symbolic selves. This symbolic self-focus takes the form of an individual's "[[immortality]] project" (or "''[[causa sui]]'' project"), which is essentially a symbolic belief-system that ensures oneself is believed superior to physical reality.  By successfully living under the terms of the immortality project, people feel they can become heroic and, henceforth, part of something eternal; something that will never die as compared to their physical body. This, in turn, gives people the feeling that their lives have meaning, a purpose, and are significant in the grand scheme of things. Another theme running throughout the book is that humanity's traditional "hero-systems", such as [[religion]], are no longer convincing in the [[Age of Enlightenment|age of reason]]. Science attempts to serve as an immortality project, something that Becker believes it can never do, because it is unable to provide agreeable, absolute meanings to human life. The book states that we need new convincing "illusions" that enable us to feel heroic in ways that are agreeable. Becker, however, does not provide any definitive answer, mainly because he believes that there is no perfect solution. Instead, he hopes that gradual realization of humanity's innate motivations, namely death, can help to bring about a better world. [[Terror Management Theory]] has generated evidence supporting this perspective.

Umar bin al-Hasan bin Ali bin Muhammad bin al-Jamil bin Farah bin Khalaf bin Qumis bin Mazlal bin Malal bin Badr bin Dihyah bin Farwah, better known as '''Ibn Dihya al-Kalbi''' ({{lang-ar|ابن دحية الكلبي}}) was a arab 
 [[Moors|Moorish]] scholar of both the [[Arabic language]] and [[Islamic studies]], and member of the [[Ahl al-Bayt]].&lt;ref name=khallikan384&gt;[[Ibn Khallikan]], pg. 384.&lt;/ref&gt; He preferred to be called Abu al-Khattab, though at various times he was also referred to as Ibn al-Jumayyil, Majd al-Din, Abu al-Fadl or simply Ibn Dihya.&lt;ref name=granja/&gt;

==Lineage==
Kalbi claimed paternal descent from a prominent [[Sahaba|companion]] of the [[Islam]]ic [[Prophets in Islam|prophet]] [[Muhammad]] and maternal [[Sayyid|descent]] from Muhammad himself. Kalbi's father traced his roots back to early Muslim [[diplomat]] [[Dihyah Kalbi]], while his mother traced hers back to the third [[Caliph]] [[Ali]] through his son - and Muhammad's grandson - [[Hussein ibn Ali]].&lt;ref name=milani&gt;{{cite web|last=al-Husaini al-Miliani|first=Ali|title=ترجمة أبي الخطّاب ابن دحية|url=http://www.al-milani.com/eref/lib-pg.php?booid=8&amp;mid=34&amp;pgid=228|publisher=al-milani.com|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brill&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Islam]], vol. III, H-IRAM, pg. 747 Eds. [[Bernard Lewis]], [[Charles Pellat]] and [[Joseph Schacht]]. Assist. J. Burton-Page, C. Dumont and V.L. Menage. Leiden: Brill Publishers, 1971. Photomechanical print.&lt;/ref&gt;  From his mother Amat Allah, he traced his maternal bloodline through Abu Abdillah bin Abul-Bassam Musa bin Abdullah bin al-Hussein bin Ja'far bin [[Ali al-Hadi|Ali]] bin [[Muhammad al-Jawad|Muhammad]] bin [[Ali Al-Ridha|Ali]] bin [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa]] bin [[Ja'far al-Sadiq|Ja'far]] bin [[Muhammad al-Baqir|Muhammad]] bin [[Ali ibn al-Husayn Zayn al-'Abidin|Ali]] bin al-Hussein bin Ali bin [[Abu Talib ibn ‘Abd al-Muttalib|Abi Talib]];&lt;ref name=khallikan384/&gt; the attribution to the prophet Muhammad, at that point in the line, is also maternal as Ali was married to Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah]].

Kalbi's lineage was not universally accepted. While [[biographer]] [[Ibn Khallikan]] accepted the conventional telling of Kalbi's family line,&lt;ref name=khallikan384/&gt; [[historian]] [[Al-Dhahabi|Dhahabi]] disputed Kalbi's claim, making a counter claim that the latter's family tree could not be substantiated.&lt;ref name=siyar&gt;[[Al-Dhahabi]], {{ws|[[s:ar:سير أعلام النبلاء|''Siyar a`lam al-nubala''']]|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
While Ibn Diyha is generally acknowledhed to have been born in [[Valencia]],&lt;ref name=brill/&gt; conflicting reports have been given regarding Kalbi's exact date of birth.&lt;ref name=granja&gt;F. de la Granja, [http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ibn-dihya-SIM_3129 Ibn Diḥya]. [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]], Second Edition. Brill Online, 2013. Reference. 9 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Ibn Khallikan held the view that Kalbi was born in March 1150, despite the fact that he was personally informed by Kalbi's son and nephew that Kalbi was born in February 1152.&lt;ref name=khallikan386/&gt;

Kalbi initially pursued the study of Islamic [[Hadith|Prophetic traditions]] in Spain, visiting every major city in the country and learning from their scholars and academics.&lt;ref name=brill/&gt;&lt;ref name=khallikan385&gt;[[Ibn Khallikan]], pg. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to further his studies, he traveled from [[Al-Andalus]] to [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]]. Later, his study of Prophetic traditions took him through to [[Tunis]] in the year 590AH, then through [[Africa]] and on to [[Egypt]], the [[Levant]], [[Baghdad]], [[Erbil]] and [[Wasit]] in [[Iraq]], and [[Isfahan]] and [[Nisapur]] in [[Greater Khorasan]].&lt;ref name="milani"/&gt;&lt;ref name=khallikan385/&gt; Kalbi was a student of [[Ibn Maḍāʾ]],&lt;ref name=brill/&gt; chief judge of the [[Almohad Caliphate]], and held immense respect for his teacher, who he referred to as "leader of all grammarians."&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam, vol. III, H-IRAM, pg. 855.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
In addition to his renown as a linguistic scholar, Kalbi was also considered to be from the scholars of [[Hadith|Prophetic narrations]],&lt;ref name=hasan/&gt; which was actually his primary focus of study, despite his fame primarily being for his knowledge of [[Arabic grammar]] and [[philology]].&lt;ref name=khallikan385/&gt;&lt;ref name=hasan&gt;[[Al-Suyuti]], Hasan al-Muhadharah bi Mahasin Masr wa al-Qahirah, volume 1, page 201&lt;/ref&gt;  His number of students was considered high and his [[Isnad|chain of narration]] is recognized by later scholars of the field. A number of these later scholars also narrated either directly from him or through his chain, such as [[Ibn al-Salah]].&lt;ref name="wuat"/&gt;

While in Andalus, Kalbi was appointed as the judge of [[Dénia]] by the Almohads, but stepped down after public reaction to his sentencing a convict to [[cruel and unusual punishment]].&lt;ref name=brill/&gt; After his resignation, he sought further education in the Muslim east. After studying [[Sahih Muslim]] in [[Tunis]] in 1198, he performed the [[Hajj]] at [[Mecca]] and spent some time in [[Egypt]]. He sought further knowledge in the field of hadith in [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], [[Persia]] as far east as [[Nisapur]] before returning to Egypt.&lt;ref name=brill/&gt;

Kalbi taught the [[Ayyubid dynasty|Ayyubid]] [[List of Ayyubid rulers|Sultan]] [[Al-Kamil]] basic academic subjects and proper etiquette during the latter's youth. Later in life, Al-Kamil built an entire school for Kalbi to teach and pursue the study of Prophetic narrations.&lt;ref name="wuat"/&gt; Al-Kamil would eventually replace Kalbi with his older brother Abu Amr bin Dihya al-Kalbi, also an expert in the Arabic language, as the director of the school, a position which the older brother held until his own death.&lt;ref name=khallikan386/&gt;

===Death===
Kalbi died in Cairo on Tuesday, the 14th of the [[Islamic calendar]] month [[Rabi' al-awwal]], in the [[Hijri year]] 633, corresponding to November 1235.&lt;ref name=khallikan386/&gt;&lt;ref name="wuat"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hasan/&gt;  He was roughly 89&amp;nbsp;years old according to the Islamic calendar, and 86&amp;nbsp;years old according to the [[Gregorian calendar]]. His death was during Ayyubid rule in what is now Egypt.

He was buried at the foot of the [[Mokattam]] [[mountain range]] outside of Cairo.&lt;ref name=khallikan386/&gt; His older brother, Abu Amr, died almost two years later in January 1237; he also died on a Tuesday, and was buried at the foot of the same mountain range.&lt;ref name=khallikan386/&gt;

Evaluation of Kalbi's contribution to Islamic studies has been difficult due to his controversial nature among Muslim historians during the Middle Ages. Critics in the Muslim east have accused Kalbi of plagiarism and dishonesty, while those in the Muslim west praised Kalbi highly and referenced his education and efforts in learning.&lt;ref name=brill/&gt;

==Works==
At the request Al-Kamil, he wrote his most famous work: "al-Motrib min Ashaar Ahl al-Maghrib" "{{lang-ar|المطرب من أشعار أهل المغرب}}" (loosely translated: ''Rhymes from the poetry of the people of the [[Maghreb]]'') which was a collection of short biographies of the poets of [[Al-Andalus]] and [[Morocco]], including their most famous poems. His work is extremely valuable as it preserved some of the oral traditions of the time as well as details of the poets' lives.&lt;ref name=milani/&gt;

'''John Rice Carter''' (born November 6, 1941) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] serving {{ushr|TX|31}} since 2003. He is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/arena/bio/rep_john_carter.html|title=The Arena: - Rep.

==Early life, education, and career==
Carter was born in [[Houston]], but has spent most of his life in central Texas. Carter graduated from [[Texas Tech University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.texastech.edu/stories/15-05-on-the-hill-on-the-rise.php|title=On the Hill, On the Rise {{!}} Texas Tech University System|website=www.texastech.edu|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a degree in history in 1964, and earned a law degree from the [[University of Texas School of Law]] in 1969.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/john-carter--TX-H|title=John Carter - Candidate for U.S. President, Republican Nomination - Election 2012|website=WSJ.com|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from law school, Carter served as the first general counsel to the [[Texas House of Representatives]]’ Agriculture Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/john-carter--TX-H|title=John Carter - Candidate for U.S. President, Republican Nomination - Election 2012|website=WSJ.com|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter later began a successful private law practice in Round Rock.

In 1981, Carter was appointed as judge of the 277th District Court of [[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson County]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was elected to the post a year later — the first Republican elected to a countywide position in Williamson County. He was reelected four times.

A staunch fiscal and social conservative, Carter prides himself on having raised a family built on what he calls "Texas Values."

Carter is best known as the author of a law that made it easier to prove [[identity theft]] and provides stiff penalties for the offense. It was signed into law by [[George W. Bush]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/5437439/ns/technology_and_science-security/t/bush-signs-lawto-stiffenid-theft-penalties/|title=Bush signs lawto stiffenID theft penalties|date=2004-07-15|work=msnbc.com|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===110th Congress===
In the 110th Congress, Congressman Carter has sponsored and co-sponsored a number of bills including the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act, the Terrorist Death Penalty Act of 2008, and a bill condemning the vandalism of the Vietnam War Memorial on the National Mall.  On the Appropriations Committee, Congressman Carter introduced an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill to provide $12 million in funding to the section 287(g) of the Immigration Nationality Act (INA) which allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to delegate enforcement powers to state and local law enforcement allowing them to investigate, detain and arrest criminal aliens. However, this amendment was defeated in committee.

Also, when Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House of Representatives recessed in August 2008 for five weeks, Congressman Carter was one of many Republicans who stayed in Washington.  This was part of a GOP protest, in which they claimed that Congress should not have recessed for five weeks without addressing the energy crisis many Americans were facing. The [[Sunlight Foundation]] pointed out that as of 2008 among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Carter had the second-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sunlight Foundation Blog – Oil Industry Influence: Personal Finances' |date=August 8, 2008 |url=http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/08/08/oil-industry-influence-personal-finances/ |publisher=Sunlight Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080812021937/http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/08/08/oil-industry-influence-personal-finances/ |archivedate=August 12, 2008 |df= }} Retrieved on Aug. 8, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===111th Congress===
On June 12, 2009, Carter signed on as a co-sponsor of [[H.R. 1503]], the bill introduced as a reaction to [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories which claimed that U.S. President Barack Obama is not a natural born U.S. citizen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1503|date=|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR01503:@@@P|publisher=The Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 15, 2009, Carter called the 111th Congress a "house of hypocrisy" after the House of Representatives voted to rebuke [[South Carolina]] Representative [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] for his outburst, but would not go after New York Representative and House Ways and Means Chair [[Charlie Rangel]], who has been the subject of numerous ethical problems involving taxes and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Speaking of apologies: Hypocrisy clouds Democrats’ demand for "You lie" apology|date=|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/lawmaker-news/58767-speaking-of-apologies-hypocrisy-clouds-democrats-demand-for-you-lie-apology-rep-john-carter|publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter is also a proponent of the "Rangel Rule," where [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] penalties and interest would be eliminated if one paid back taxes, similar to the treatment Rangel, [[Treasury Secretary]] [[Timothy Geithner]], and former [[South Dakota]] Senator (and one-time Secretary of Health and Human Services nominee) [[Tom Daschle]] received after their tax problems were made public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GOP Congressman Intros 'Rangel Rule,' Eliminating IRS Late Fees|date=January 28, 2009|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/28/gop-congressman-intros-rangel-rule-eliminating-irs-late-fees/|publisher=[[Fox News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter introduced a "Privileged Resolution" that would have forced the resignation of Rangel from his position as [[House Ways and Means Committee]] Chair after he declined to resign voluntarily &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Rangel Financial Violations Demand Removal from Ways and Means Chairmanship
|date=|url=http://carter.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=40&amp;parentid=6&amp;sectiontree=6,40&amp;itemid=1038|publisher=John Carter's House Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing the inaction of the House Democratic Caucus and the ongoing investigations as reasons. The resolution failed but it was noted that two [[Mississippi]] Democrats, [[Gene Taylor (Mississippi)|Gene Taylor]] and [[Travis Childers]], broke party ranks and voted with Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlie Rangel retains Ways and Means gavel|date=|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28038.html|publisher=Politico}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Democrats rebuff Rangel resolution|date=|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/62061-democrats-rebuff-rangel-resolution|publisher=The Hill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a critic of the accuracy of Rangel's financial disclosures, Carter voluntarily amended his financial disclosure forms in mid-October 2009 to list nearly $300,000 in capital gains from the sale of Exxon stock in 2006 and 2007. Though Carter listed the sale of the assets, he did not list the actual amount of capital gains, on which he did pay taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carter Refiling Disclosure Forms to List Exxon Profits|date=|url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/55_45/news/39780-1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 16, 2009, Carter introduced legislation to give combatant casualty status to the victims of the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]], similar to those who were killed in Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Carter's Resolution for Fort Hood Victims|date=|url=http://carter.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=40&amp;sectiontree=6,40&amp;itemid=1081}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, after Charlie Rangel was found to have broken House rules, Carter again demanded that Rangel step down. Rangel later stepped down, avoiding a third attempt at a privileged resolution to remove Rangel.

===115th Congress===

On May 16, 2018, Carter was named the new chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Appropriations following the retirement of Charlie Dent. He had previously served as chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Appropriations.

Carter authored six bills, including [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4854 H.R. 4854, the Justice Served Act of 2018], which was signed into law on October 9, 2018 and H.R. 1133, the Veterans Transplant Coverage Act, which was signed into law as a part of the VA MISSION Act of 2018. 

Carter signed on as a co-sponsor of H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act of 2018 which failed to pass the House. This legislation would have enhanced enforcement of existing immigration law, including important reforms to our legal immigration programs, enhanced border security, and provide a legislative solution for the current beneficiaries of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.

==Political campaigns==
Carter retired from the bench in 2001 in order to run for Congress in the newly created 31st District. After finishing second in the primary, he defeated Peter Wareing in the runoff — which was [[tantamount to election]] in this heavily Republican district. He has been consistently reelected without facing serious opposition.

Carter originally represented a district that stretched from the suburbs of Austin to the fringes of the Houston suburbs, and also included [[College Station, Texas|College Station]], home of [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. After the [[2003 Texas redistricting]], however, Carter now represents a district stretching from the fringes of the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex|Metroplex]] through more rural portions of Central Texas.  Redistricting after the 2010 census made the 31st more compact, and it now comprises [[Bell County, Texas|Bell County]] and [[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson County]].  The 31st District now includes [[Fort Hood]], home of the U.S. Army's [[3d Cavalry Regiment]] and the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]].

In the general election held on November 8, 2016, Carter won his eighth term in Congress. With 166,060 votes (58.4 percent), he defeated the Democrat Mike Clark and the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] Scott Ballard, who obtained 103,852 votes (34.5 percent) and 14,676 (5.2 percent), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist319_state.htm|title=Election Results|date=November 8, 2016|publisher=[[Texas Secretary of State]]|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the general election held on November 6, 2018, Carter won his ninth term in Congress. He defeated the Democrat candidate Mary Jennings Hegar with 144,393 votes (50.6%) to her 135,843 votes (47.6%).

[[File:Francisca Christina of the Palatinate-Sulzbach. Princess-Abbess of Essen and Thorn.jpg|thumb|mini | Portrait of the 
[[Countess Palatine Francisca Christina of Sulzbach]] with her "Kammermohr" [[Ignatius Fortuna]], by Johann Jakob Schmitz, Cologne 1772]]

Since the 18th century, in the [[German language|German-speaking]] world, the term '''Kammermohr''' (or ''Hofmohr'') has been used to refer to a servant of black skin colour at court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Vt2RHW-hEo4C&amp;pg=PA88|title=Atlantic understandings: essays on European and American history in honor of Hermann Wellenreuther|isbn=978-3825896072|page=88|year=2007|language=German|publisher=[[LIT Verlag]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People of black [[skin colour]] from the [[Orient]], [[Africa]] and [[America]] have often been taken to [[Europe]] as [[Valet|valets]] during the time of [[Colonialism]]. The term was first used as an official term in a court protocol in 1747 in [[Saxony|Saxon]].

The splendidly decorated Kammermohr, often in [[livery]], served a ruler, church dignitaries or wealthy merchants as an exotic object of prestige and as a status symbol, showcasing their wealth and luxury lifestyle. Above all, however, the valets symbolized the worldwide relations of their employer.

Well-known examples include [[Anton Wilhelm Amo]], [[Angelo Soliman]], [[Ignatius Fortuna]], [[Gustav Badin]] and [[Abraham Petrovich Hannibal]].

'''Kenneth''' "'''Kenny'''" '''McCormick'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/355425 |title=Love South Park. – FAQ |publisher=South Park Studios |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a main character in the [[animated television series|animated adult television series]] ''[[South Park]]'', along with [[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], and [[Eric Cartman]].  His oft-muffled and indiscernible speech—the result of his [[anorak|parka]] hood covering his mouth—is provided by co-creator [[Matt Stone]]. He debuted on television when ''South Park'' first aired on August 13, 1997, after having first appeared in ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|The Spirit of Christmas]]'' shorts created by Stone and long-time collaborator [[Trey Parker]] in 1992 (''Jesus vs. Frosty'') and 1995 (''Jesus vs. Santa'').

Kenny is a third, later fourth-grade student who commonly has extraordinary experiences not typical of conventional small-town life in his hometown of South Park, [[Colorado]], where he lives with his [[poverty]]-stricken family. Kenny is animated by computer to look as he did in the show's original method of [[cutout animation]]. He also appears in the 1999 full-length feature film ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'', in which his true appearance and voice was first revealed, and various ''South Park'' merchandise.

In a [[running gag]] most prevalent during the first five seasons of the series, Kenny would suffer an excruciating death before returning alive and well in the next episode with little or no explanation given. Stan would frequently use the catchphrase ''"Oh, my God! They killed Kenny!"'', followed by Kyle exclaiming ''"...You bastards!"'' Since the show began its [[South Park (season 6)|sixth season]] in 2002, the practice of killing Kenny has been seldom used by the show's creators. Various episodes have set up the gag, sometimes presenting a number of explanations for Kenny's unacknowledged reappearances.&lt;!--It was a send-up of the gag, in "Mysterion Rises"; various episodes have presented other 'explanations of Kenny's resurrections, but we know in a Real-World perspective that the real reason is that it's a running joke. In the episode "Mysterion Rises," it is found that Kenny actually has the super-power of resurrection, claiming that no matter how many times he's died, he always wakes up in his bed the next day wearing his usual clothes. He also states that none of his peers or family can remember him dying whatsoever. However in some episodes the other kids can recall Kenny being killed and mention how he died all the time . Kenny died every episode up to season 7. After this Kenny only dies sometimes--&gt; In the episode Coon 2: Hindsight it is revealed that Kenny is Mysterion, during this episode and continuing episodes (Mysterion rises,Coon vs. Coon and friends) it is also revealed that Kenny gets his immortal powers from the cult of Chutulu, due to the fact that his parents attended meetings before, they stated it was “just for the free beer”.

==Role in ''South Park''==
Kenny attends South Park Elementary as part of [[Mr. Garrison]]'s fourth grade class. During the first 58 episodes, Kenny and the other main child characters were in the [[third grade]]. Kenny comes from a poor household, presided over by his violent, alcoholic, unemployed father, [[List of South Park families#Stuart and Carol McCormick|Stuart McCormick]]. His mother [[List of South Park families#Stuart and Carol McCormick|Carol McCormick]] has a job washing dishes at the [[Olive Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/characters/4|title=Kenny McCormick|accessdate=2008-03-30|publisher=South Park Studios}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kenny has an older brother named [[List of South Park families#Kevin McCormick|Kevin]]. He also has a younger sister who is shown with his family in the [[South Park (season 9)|season nine]] episode "[[Best Friends Forever (South Park)|Best Friends Forever]]", but does not appear until the [[South Park (season 15)|15th season]] episode "[[The Poor Kid]]", where her name is revealed to be [[List of South Park families#Karen McCormick|Karen]], whom he loves unconditionally. Kenny is friends with Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Butters. Kenny is regularly [[Classism|teased for living in poverty]], particularly by Cartman.&lt;ref name=sfrubin&gt;{{cite news|author=Sylvia Rubin|title=TV 's Foul-Mouthed Funnies|work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=1998-01-26|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1998/01/26/DD58819.DTL|accessdate=2009-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenny's [[superhero]] [[alter ego]], Mysterion, first appeared in the Season 13 episode "[[The Coon]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Fickett |first=Travis |title=South Park: "The Coon" Review |date=March 19, 2009 |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/964/964509p1.html |publisher=IGN |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a rival to Eric Cartman's eponymous superhero alter ego. He unmasks himself at the end of the episode, but his identity is left intentionally ambiguous. He is not revealed to be Kenny until the Season 14 episode "[[Mysterion Rises]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = South Park: "Mysterion Rises" Review.

==Deaths==
Prior to [[South Park (season 6)|season six]], Kenny died in almost every episode.

Eric Cartman commented on Kenny's deaths in the episode "[[Cartmanland]]", when he is being sued for unsafe rides insisting to attorneys representing his family that "Kenny dies all the time!"

Near the end of the production run of the show's [[South Park (season 5)|fifth season]], Parker and Stone contemplated having an episode in which Kenny was killed off permanently.

For much of season six, Kenny remained dead, though both Stone and Parker entertained the idea of eventually bringing the character back.&lt;ref name=page2/&gt; According to Stone, only a small minority of fans were significantly angered by Kenny's absence to threaten a boycott of the cable channel [[Comedy Central]], on which ''South Park'' is aired.&lt;ref name=nypost/&gt; For most of the season, Stan, Kyle, and Cartman fill the void left by Kenny by allowing the characters [[Butters Stotch]] and [[List of students at South Park Elementary#Tweek Tweak|Tweek Tweak]] into their group, paving the way for those characters to receive more focus on the show.&lt;ref name=page2/&gt;&lt;ref name=ids&gt;{{cite news|author=Alyson Brodsy and Mark Perlman-Price|title=A season without Kenny|work=[[Indiana Daily Student]]|date=2005-10-20|url=http://www.idsnews.com/news/story.aspx?id=43709|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Kenny returned from the year-long absence in the season six finale "[[Red Sleigh Down]]", has remained a main character since, and has been given larger roles in episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Semigram, Aly. [http://popwatch.ew.com/2011/11/17/south-park-penn-state-scandal/ "'South Park' tries to go for laughs with the Penn State scandal"]. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''. November 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; His character no longer dies in every episode, and has only been killed occasionally in the seasons following his return.

The first explanation given for Kenny's deaths and reappearances was given in "[[Cartman Joins NAMBLA]]", wherein the McCormicks have a baby exactly like Kenny, including the characteristic orange parka, shortly after the former Kenny dies. Mr. McCormick exclaims, "God, this must be the fiftieth time this has happened", to which Mrs. McCormick quickly replies, "Fifty-second". This explanation is expanded upon in the Season 14 episodes "[[Coon 2: Hindsight]]", "[[Mysterion Rises]]" and "[[Coon vs. Coon and Friends]]", in which Kenny, while playing superheroes with his friends, claims his "super power" is [[immortality]]. He actually dies several times during these episodes—even committing suicide more than once—reawakening alive and unharmed in his bed each time. He is frustrated and angry that no one can remember him dying every time he regenerates, and longs to know the source of his power, which he views as a curse. Unbeknownst to him, his parents were previously connected to a [[Cthulhu]]-worshipping death cult. After Kenny shoots himself the second time, Mrs. McCormick awakes with a scream, shrieks "It's happening again!", and minutes later, is shown gently placing a newborn Kenny in his bed. "We should never have gone to that stupid cult meeting," she grouses as she and her husband return to bed.

In the episode "[[Put It Down (South Park)|Put It Down]]," he is killed off-screen by a driver on his phone, as his picture is shown among those of kids killed by driver on phone texting tribute.

Kenny has died 126 times in the ''South Park'' franchise (98 in the series, 12 in the shorts, 14 in the video games, and twice in the movie).

==Character==
===Creation and design===
[[Image:KennyUnhooded.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Kenny's entire face was revealed for the first time in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]''.]]
When developing the character, the show's creators had observed that most groups of childhood friends in small middle-class towns always included "the one poor kid" and decided to portray Kenny in this light.&lt;ref name=goindown&gt;{{cite video|people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|title=Goin' Down to South Park|medium=Television documentary|publisher=Comedy Central}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An unnamed precursor to Kenny first appeared in the first ''The Spirit of Christmas'' short, dubbed ''Jesus vs. Frosty'', created by Parker and Stone in 1992 while they were students at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]. The character was composed of [[construction paper]] cutouts and animated through the use of [[stop motion]].&lt;ref name=method&gt;{{cite news|author=Matt Cheplic |title='As Crappy As Possible': The Method Behind the Madness of South Park |publisher=[[Penton Media]] |date=1998-05-01 |url=http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mag/video_crappy_possible_method/ |accessdate=2009-04-28 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329014416/http://digitalcontentproducer.com/mag/video_crappy_possible_method/ |archivedate=2009-03-29 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When tasked three years later by friend Brian Graden to create another short as a [[video]] [[Christmas card]] that he could send to friends, Parker and Stone created another similarly-animated ''The Spirit of Christmas'' short, dubbed ''Jesus vs. Santa''.&lt;ref name=VH1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/press/bios/brian_graden.jhtml |title=Brian Graden's Bio |publisher=VH1.com |accessdate=2008-01-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080120161058/http://www.vh1.com/press/bios/brian_graden.jhtml |archivedate=2008-01-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NotableBiographies&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ge-La/Graden-Brian.html|title=Brian Graden Biography|publisher=Advameg, Inc|accessdate=2008-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this short, Kenny is given his first name, and first appears as he does in the series.
Kenny next appeared on August 13, 1997, when ''South Park'' debuted on [[Comedy Central]] with the episode "[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]".

In tradition with the show's [[Cutout animation|animation style]], Kenny is composed of simple geometrical shapes and [[primary color]]s.&lt;ref name=avr/&gt;&lt;ref name=method/&gt; He is not offered the same free range of motion associated with hand-drawn characters; his character is mostly shown from only one angle, and his movements are animated in an intentionally jerky fashion.&lt;ref name=avr/&gt;&lt;ref name=method/&gt;&lt;ref name=growsup2&gt;{{cite news|author=Jaime J.

[[File:MysterionUnmasked1.png|thumb|Kenny/Mysterion unmasked at the end of "[[The Coon]]". Originally intended to have been a generic, unnamed classmate of the main characters, he was revealed to be Kenny in "[[Mysterion Rises]]".]]

The effect of Kenny's speech is achieved by Stone mumbling into his own hand as he provides Kenny's lines,&lt;ref name=method/&gt; while the recorded audio is then edited with [[Pro Tools]], and the pitch is altered to make the voice sound more like that of a fourth grader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Park FAQ|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/archives.php?month=2&amp;year=2009|date=2009-02-10|publisher=South Park Studios|accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sps40&gt;{{cite web|title=40 Questions |url=http://treyparker.info/archives_spstudios.htm |date=2001-10-04 |publisher=South Park Studios |accessdate=2009-01-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129004417/http://treyparker.info/archives_spstudios.htm |archivedate=2010-11-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the technique of Kenny's muzzled enunciation frequently implies, many of his lines are indeed profane and sexually explicit, the lengthier of which are mostly improvised by Stone.&lt;ref name=method/&gt;

He first appeared unobscured by his hood in ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'', where it was revealed that he had messy golden hair. [[Mike Judge]] provided the voice for Kenny's one line of uninsulated dialogue: "Goodbye, you guys."&lt;ref name="voiceactors"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/355463 |title=FAQ: In 'Meet the Jeffersons' and in BLU Kenny's voice can be heard without it being muffled by his hood.

(South Park)|W.T.F.]]", "[[Pee (South Park)|Pee]]", and "[[You're Getting Old]]".&lt;/ref&gt; however, unlike in ''Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut'' his entire face has been only seen once in the television series without being partially obscured or otherwise altered, this being in "[[The Losing Edge]]". He also speaks unmuffled during some of these instances, in which case co-producer [[Eric Stough]] provides Kenny's voice.&lt;ref name="voiceactors" /&gt; During "[[The Coon]]" episodes of seasons 13 and 14, Kenny has his first major speaking role as the character Mysterion.

===Personality and traits===
While most child characters on the show are foul-mouthed, Kenny is often even more risqué with his dialogue.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news|author=|title=Cartman top with kids|publisher=BBC|date=1999-08-26|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/entertainment/430977.stm|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parker and Stone state that they depict Kenny and his friends in this manner in order to display how young boys really talk when they are alone.&lt;ref name=avr/&gt;&lt;ref name=abc4&gt;{{cite web|author=Jake Trapper and Dan Morris|title=Secrets of 'South Park'|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=2006-09-22| url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/Entertainment/Story?id=2479197&amp;page=4| accessdate=2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Kenny is often cynical and profane, Parker notes that there nonetheless is an "underlying sweetness" aspect to the character,&lt;ref name=loudlewd&gt;{{cite news|author=Frazier Moore|title=Loud and lewd but sweet underneath|work=[[The Age]]|date=2006-12-14|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/tv--radio/loud-and-lewd-but-sweet-underneath/2006/12/13/1165685687176.html?page=2|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine described Kenny and his friends as "sometimes cruel but with a core of innocence".&lt;ref name=time/&gt; He is amused by [[toilet humor]] and bodily functions,&lt;ref name=time/&gt; and his favorite television personalities are [[Terrance and Phillip]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] duo whose comedy routines on their show-within-the-show revolve substantially around fart jokes. Kenny is shown to desire intercourse in the episode "The Ring", when Kenny gets a girlfriend and is overjoyed to find out that she has a reputation as a slut. Kenny is also lecherous,&lt;ref name=sfrubin/&gt; and often portrayed as being eager to do and say disgusting things in an attempt to impress others or earn money.&lt;ref name=goindown/&gt; Conversely, his alter-ego Mysterion is seemingly mature, principled, and serious-minded, the only exception being one instance in "Mysterion Rises" in which he takes delight in irritating Cartman. As Mysterion he convinces his parents to take better care of themselves and their children, as seen by their reaction when he questions them about the cult of Cthulhu. He also uses his disguise to protect his sister Karen (who refers to Mysterion as her "guardian angel"), as revealed in "[[The Poor Kid]]." In all of his guises, however, Kenny is depicted as being uncommonly selfless, dying for the sake of others and spending all of his time working so he could buy his little sister a doll.

In the trilogy of episodes "[[Black Friday (South Park)|Black Friday]]", "[[A Song of Ass and Fire]]" and  "[[Titties and Dragons]]", in which the boys play-act characters from the TV series ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', Kenny [[Cross-dressing|cross-dresses]] as a fantasy-style princess with a wig and dress similar to the video game character [[Princess Zelda]], and becomes a [[Japanese language|Japanese]]-speaking [[Moe (slang)|moe]] [[anime]] character at one point. When Cartman complains, "You're never going to be a real princess", Princess Kenny responds (via her translator, Stan) angrily to Cartman, calling him a "ball-licking lesbian".

This portrayal continues in the video game ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' where Cartman notes that playing a "chick" is "just how [Kenny] seems to be rolling right now". Kenny's sister also refers to Kenny as a girl, if you talk to her in the McCormick house. Throughout the game, Kenny posts 'status updates' referring to herself as "the cutest of them all".

Kenny's deaths have been subject to much critical analysis in the media and literary world. In the book ''[[South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating]]'', an essay by [[Southern Illinois University]] philosophy professor Dr. [[Randall Auxier]], entitled "Killing Kenny: Our Daily Dose of Death", suggests that the fashion of the recurring gag serves to help the viewer become more comfortable with the inevitability of their own death.&lt;ref name=green&gt;{{cite news|last=Staff|title=Philosophy Speaker Presents "Killing Kenny: Our Daily Dose of Death"|work=GMC Journal|publisher=[[Green Mountain College]]|date=2007-02-05|url=http://www.greenmtn.edu/gmcjournal/journal020507.asp|accessdate=2008-02-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219061104/http://www.greenmtn.edu/gmcjournal/journal020507.asp|archivedate=2008-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/books/just-killing-kenny-or-ontological-boredom/ |title=Just killing Kenny or ontological boredom? |accessdate=2009-03-05 |last=Marchetto |first=Sean |date=2007-12-06 |work=Fast Forward Weekly |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081119082531/http://www.ffwdweekly.com/article/life-style/books/just-killing-kenny-or-ontological-boredom |archivedate=2008-11-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book ''South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today'', [[University of Wisconsin–Stevens Point]] professor Karin Fry wrote an essay concerning the parallels between Kenny's role in the show and the different concepts of [[existentialism]].&lt;ref name=philo4&gt;{{cite book|last=Arp|first=Robert (Editor)|author2=Fry, Karin |title=South Park and Philosophy: You Know, I Learned Something Today|publisher=Blackwell Publishing (The Blackwell Philosophy &amp; Pop Culture Series)|date=2006-12-01|pages=77–86|isbn=978-1-4051-6160-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved January 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; are not covered by this article.

Various factors enter into a city's [[cost-of-living]] for expatriate employees, such as monetary value, [[consumer confidence]], [[investment]], [[interest rates]], [[exchange rate]]s of the country's currency, and housing costs. This list '''does not''' account for cost-of-living savings accrued to local citizens through government-subsidized housing, health care, and education, differences in [[taxation]], and many other factors irrelevant to expatriates. Cost of living may be much higher for expatriates than for local residents in a [[developing country]], especially if expatriates expect a standard of living similar to a [[developed country]].

Mercer's Cost of Living surveys are taken in March of each year.

The survey covers 207 cities around the world and measures the comparative cost of over 200 items in each location, including housing, transport, food, clothing, household goods and entertainment. It is designed to help multinational companies and governments determine compensation allowances for their expatriate employees. New York is used as the base city and all other cities are compared against New York. The cost of housing plays an important part in determining where cities are ranked.

Two main factors determine a city’s ranking in Mercer’s survey – the relative strength of the relevant currency against the US dollar over the prior 12 months and price movements over the prior 12 months compared to those in New York City as the base.

== ECA International ==
Every March and September, [[ECA International]] calculates the cost of living for expatriates in almost 400 cities around the world. The survey does not include certain living costs such as accommodation, utilities (electricity, gas, water costs), car purchase and school fees. These are usually compensated for separately in expatriate packages from cost of living allowances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1995">'''Margaret "Maggie" Lily Hill''' (1898&amp;ndash;1949) was as English career criminal, linked to organised shoplifting.

Born in [[Marylebone]], London, she was the sister of notorious [[gangster]] [[Billy Hill (gangster)|Billy Hill]] who rose to prominence in the [[London]] underworld during the interwar years.&lt;ref&gt;Morton, J. and G. Parker, Gangland Bosses: the Lives of Jack Spot and Billy Hill, (London, 2004), pp 16&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Forty Elephants ==
During the interwar years, however, she received notoriety as one of the leaders of an all female gang of criminals known as the [[Forty Elephants]] who specialised in shoplifting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/dec/27/girl-gang-london-underworld&lt;/ref&gt;  This gang was notable for its longevity and skill in avoiding police detection.&lt;ref&gt;Capstick, J., Given in Evidence, (London, 1960), chapter 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Hill's parents were Septimus James Hill and Amelia Sparling, who had  married in 1895. Her mother was born in Dublin, Ireland. Hill was a close friend of [[Eddie Guerin]], famous for being the lover of [[Chicago May]].&lt;ref&gt;Morton, J., Gangland: the Early Years, (London, 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;  Her sister was Dorothy 'Dolly' Mays, another of the Forty Elephants. According to Brian McDonald, Maggie Hill married career criminal Alfred Hughes in 1915, and they were sometimes convicted together.&lt;ref&gt;Brian McDonald: Alice Diamond and the Forty Elephants, Milo 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her convictions are listed under the name Maggie Hughes. She was violent and unmanageable by all except [[Alice Diamond]]. Her last known prison sentence was in 1939 when she received three years for attacking two women with broken bottles, causing one of them to lose an eye. She died in 1949 in Marylebone, and her place of burial is unknown.

'''Afife Nurbanu Sultan''' ({{lang-ota|نور بانو سلطان}}; {{circa}} 1525&lt;ref name=EI/&gt; – 7 December 1583) was [[Haseki Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] as the principal consort and later legal wife of Sultan [[Selim II]]  (reign 1566–1574), as well as [[Valide Sultan]] as the mother of Sultan [[Murad III]] (reign 1574–1595). Conflicting theories ascribe her a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]], [[Jewish]]&lt;ref&gt;Stanford J. Shaw, {{Google books |id=Xd422lS6ezgC |page=178 |title=History of the Ottoman Empire and modern Turkey, Volume 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or Greek&lt;ref&gt;Arbel, Benjamin, ''Nur Banu (c. 1530-1583): A Venetian Sultana?''&lt;/ref&gt; origin. Her birth name may have been Cecilia Venier-Baffo,&lt;ref&gt;Godfrey Goodwin, ''The Private World of Ottoman Women'', Saqi Book, {{ISBN|0-86356-745-2}}, {{ISBN|3-631-36808-9}}, 2001. page 128,&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel&lt;ref&gt;Valeria Heuberger, Geneviève Humbert, Geneviève Humbert-Knitel, Elisabeth Vyslonzil, ''Cultures in Colors'', page 68. {{ISBN|3-631-36808-9}}, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; or Kalē Kartanou.&lt;ref name=Arbel&gt;Arbel, Benjamin, ''Nur Banu (c. 1530-1583): A Venetian Sultana?'', Turcica, 24 (1992), pp. 241-259.&lt;/ref&gt; Nurbanu was one of the prominent figures during the era known as [[Sultanate of Women]].

== Theories about her origin ==
There are several theories about the ethnic roots of Nurbanu, none of which is generally accepted:

=== Jewish origin ===
Turkish historian Ahmet Refik believed she was of Jewish descent,&lt;ref&gt;Çağatay Uluçay, ''Padişahların Kadınları ve Kızları'' p.68, citing ''Kadınlar Saltanatı'' I p.95&lt;/ref&gt; followed by some Turkish historians.&lt;ref name=EI&gt;A.H. de Groot, s.v. in [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] vol.8 p.124&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Cecilia Venier-Baffo'' ===
In 1900, Emilio Spagni claimed that she was a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] patrician, daughter of [[Nicolò Venier]] and Violanta Baffo, abducted on [[Paros]] when it was captured by Ottoman admiral [[Hayreddin Barbarossa]] in the [[Third Ottoman-Venetian War]]. The Sultana, herself, would often say she was of Venetian patrician descent, but never named her family.&lt;ref name=Arbel/&gt;

=== ''Kalē Kartanou'' ===
In 1992, B. Arbel challenged the view that she was really of Venetian descent. For him the most plausible theory is that she was a Greek from Corfou named Kale Kartanou.&lt;ref name=Arbel&gt;Arbel, Benjamin, ''Nur Banu (c. 1530-1583): A Venetian Sultana?'', Turcica, 24 (1992), pp. 241-259.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Haseki Sultan ==
[[File:Portrait Of Sultan Selim II.jpg|thumb|upright|Nurbanu's husband Selim]]

Nurbanu became the most favored consort of [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Selim II]], who was put on the throne in 1566, and the mother of [[Murad III]].

While her spouse Selim still a [[şehzade]], Nurbanu had been the head of his princely harem at [[Manisa]].

Like his predecessor Selim let his favorite wife remain at Topkapı throughout his reign.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=121}}

Even after Selim as a sultan began to take other concubines, she persisted as a favorite for her beauty and intelligence. As mother of the heir-apparent, she acted as an advisor to her husband.Although it was far from normal at the time, Selim II would often ask Nurbanu for her advice on various subjects because of his respect for her good judgment. Jacopo Soranzo, Venetian Ambassador reported: {{bq|text= "The Haseki is said to be extremely well loved and honored by His Majesty both for her great beauty and for being unusually intelligent."{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=[{{google books|id=L6-VRgVzRcUC|page=228|plainurl=yes}} 228]}}}}Her son became Sultan Murad III and Nurbanu became Valide Sultan (effectively “Queen Mother”), the highest position a woman could hold in the Ottoman Empire. She became a formidable figure with far-reaching influence during this time. According to some sources (Italian mostly, from Venetian accounts)&amp; Some source's also remarked him as a devil sister.She became a figure with far-reaching influence during this time, so much so that Nurbanu Sultan effectively ran the government alongside the Grand Vizier Sokollu Mehmet Pasha. The Ottoman Empire was far from being very stable at the top and clashes over the imperial throne were common. It was also not uncommon for the loser to have his entire family massacred along with him to prevent any future challenge. Nurbanu Sultan was determined, however, that when the time came for her son to succeed his father, nothing would interfere with that.

At the end of Selim II's reign, the haseki Nurbanu received 1,100 aspers a day, while Selim's other consorts, each the mother of a son, received only 40 aspers.{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=108}}{{sfn|Peirce|1993|p=[{{google books|id=L6-VRgVzRcUC|page=129|plainurl=yes}} 129]}}

== Valide Sultan and regent ==
[[File:Sultan Murad III.jpg|thumb|upright|Murad III, to whom Nûr-Banû was a [[Valide sultan]] during 1574 - 1583.]]
Şehzade Murad had been sent to serve as Governor of Manisa on the Aegean coast and was there when Sultan Selim II died in 1574.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=L6-VRgVzRcUC&amp;pg=PA92&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;dq=nurbanu+sultan+the+mother+of+Selim&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ejdI-OaMa9&amp;sig=RcSOhyG2fzjhtO_CM0FTvFhiCXs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwia5aGijYLXAhVGxYMKHRRJBAA4ChDoAQg0MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=nurbanu%20sultan%20the%20mother%20of%20Selim&amp;f=false|title=The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire|last=Peirce|first=Leslie P.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195086775|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have been the perfect opportunity for someone to seize power with the Sultan dead and his son away from the capital. Nurbanu realized this as much, if not more, than anyone and took quick action. Security and privacy in the harem were the most strict anywhere and no one knew when Selim II had actually died. Nurbanu told no one and hid the dead body of her husband in an icebox and sent to Manisa for her son to come to Constantinople immediately. All the while no one was the wiser that Sultan Selim II had actually departed this life. It was not made known publicly until twelve days later when Murad arrived and Nurbanu delivered up the body of her late husband. Her son became Sultan [[Murad III]] and Nurbanu became [[Valide Sultan]], the highest position a woman could hold in the Ottoman Empire. Unlike her predecessor [[Hürrem Sultan]], Nurbanu outlived her husband and enjoyed absolute power between 1574 and 1583, although she was apparently not resident in the Palace after Selim II's death. Nurbanu had ultimate power, and she became a formidable figure with far-reaching influence. [[Canfeda Hatun]], [[Raziye Hatun]], and [[Hubbi Hatun]] ladies-in-waiting to Murad and Nurbanu also appear to have been very powerful and influential during his reign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Maria Pia Pedani Fabris, Alessio Bombaci|title=Inventory of the Lettere E Scritture Turchesche in the Venetian State Archives|pages=26|publisher=BRILL|year=2010|isbn=978-9-004-17918-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=
Attilio|last=Petruccioli|title=Gardens in the Time of the Great Muslim Empires: Theory and Design|publisher=E. J. Brill|year=1997|pages=50|isbn=978-9-004-10723-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign politics ===
After Nurbanu became the [[valide sultan]] to her son [[Murad III]], she effectively managed the government together with the [[Grand Vizier of the Ottoman Empire|Grand Vizier]] [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha]], who acted as co-regent with the sultan during the [[Sultanate of Women]]. Her intermediary to the world outside the harem was her "kira", [[Esther Handali]]. "Kira" was so popular means of communication with the outside world when Nûr-Banû was the [[Valide Sultan]] that the two women were said to have been lovers. She corresponded with the queen [[Catherine de' Medici]] of [[France]]. Venetian accounts are the most prolific in describing Nurbanu Sultan as a woman who never forgot her Venetian origins.
[[File:Nurbanu's burial, Shahanshahnama.jpg|thumb|upright|Afife Nûr-Bânû [[Valide Sultan]]'s [[Salat al-Janazah|Ṣalāt al-Janāzah]] and her [[Islamic burial]] ''(Shahan-Shah-Namah-i Lokhmann)'']]
During her nine years of regency (1574–1583), her politics were so pro-Venetian that she was hated by the [[Republic of Genoa]]. Some have even suggested that she was poisoned by a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] agent. In any case, she died at the palace in the [[Yenikapı]] [[Quarter (country subdivision)|Quarter]], [[Istanbul]] on 7 December 1583.

=== Charitable establishments and philanthrophy ===
During her nine years of regency, Nurbanu ordered the renowned Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]] to build the [[Atik Valide Mosque]] and its surrounding [[külliye]] at the district of [[Üsküdar]] in [[Istanbul]], where previously a "Jewish bath" was located. The construction of the külliye was completed and put in commission at the end of 1583, just before the demise of Nurbanu on 7 December 1583. She was buried at the [[mausoleum]] of her husband [[Selim II]] located inside the [[Hagia Sophia]] (then a mosque) at [[Sultanahmet, Fatih|Sultanahmet]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]].

== Death ==
[[File:Tomb of Sultan Selim II - 01.JPG|thumb|left|Afife Nûr-Banû Valide Sultan's name is inscribed at the entrance of her husband [[Selim II]]'s [[türbe]].]]
Nurbanu died at Istanbul on December 7, 1583, during the reign of her son Murad III.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/death-in-the-topkapi-harem.aspx?PageID=238&amp;NID=37887&amp;NewsCatID=438|title=Death in the Topkapı Harem - TASTE OF THE PAST|website=Hürriyet Daily News {{!}} LEADING NEWS SOURCE FOR TURKEY AND THE REGION|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried next to Selim II in his mausoleum in the courtyard of Hagia Sophia, thus becoming the first wife of a Sultan to receive the honor of being laid to rest next to her spouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.tn/books?id=L6-VRgVzRcUC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=nurbanu+sultan&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjbt7KUjILXAhVGWCYKHXNXCzkQ6AEILzAC#v=onepage&amp;q=nurbanu&amp;f=false|title=The Imperial Harem: Women and Sovereignty in the Ottoman Empire|last=Peirce|first=Leslie P.|date=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195086775|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issue ==
With Selim,Nurbanu is confirmed to have had at least four children, including:
* [[Murad III]] (4 July 1546, Manisa Palace, [[Manisa]] – 15 January 1595, Topkapı Palace, Istanbul, buried in Murad III Mausoleum, Hagia Sophia)
* [[Ismihan Sultan]] (1543, Manisa Palace, Manisa – 8 August 1585, Istanbul, buried in Selim II Mausoleum, Hagia Sophia Mosque), married firstly in 1562 to Damat [[Sokollu Mehmed Pasha]], married secondly in 1584 to Damat Kalaylıkoz Ali Pasha.&lt;ref name="tezcan"&gt;{{cite book|first=Baki|last=Tezcan|title=Searching For Osman: A Reassessment Of The Deposition Of Ottoman Sultan Osman II (1618-1622)|publisher=unpublished Ph.D. thesis|year=2001|pages=327 n. 16|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gevherhan Sultan (daughter of Selim II)|Gevherhan Sultan]] (1544, Manisa Palace, Manisa – Istanbul, buried in Selim II Mausoleum, Hagia Sophia Mosque), married firstly in 1562 to Damat [[Piyale Pasha]], married secondly to Damat [[Cerrah Mehmed Pasha]].&lt;ref name="tezcan"/&gt;

Though the claim remains disputed,{{sfn|Peirce|page=92}} several sources also mention her as the mother of:
* [[Fatma Sultan (daughter of Selim II)|Fatma Sultan]] (1559, Konya Palace, [[Konya]] – October 1580, Istanbul, buried in Selim II Mausoleum, Hagia Sophia Mosque), married in 1574 to Damat [[Kanijeli Siyavuş Pasha]].{{sfn| Uluçay|1985|page=43}}{{sfn|Freely|1999|page=}}

'''Richard Lee Roberts''' (born November 12, 1948) is chairman and chief executive officer of the [[Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association]] and previously served as president of [[Oral Roberts University]] (ORU) for 15 years.

==Early life and education==

Richard Lee Roberts was born on November 12, 1948, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the son of evangelist [[Granville Oral Roberts]] (died 2009) and school teacher Evelyn Lutman Roberts (died 2005). The third born of four Roberts children, he had an older sister, Rebecca Ann, who along with her husband, Marshall Nash, was killed in a plane crash in 1977, and an older brother, Ronald David, who died in 1982 in what was determined to be suicide. Robert's younger sister, Roberta Jean Potts, is a practicing attorney in Tulsa, Oklahoma.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Oral Roberts|title=Expect a Miracle: My Life and Ministry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=khUBAAAACAAJ|date=1 August 1998|publisher=Thomas Nelson Incorporated|isbn=978-0-7852-7465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a young boy, Roberts watched his father travel the United States and the world conducting healing meetings where he would preach and pray for the sick.  At times, his father and mother were gone for periods as long as six weeks.  When school permitted, Roberts accompanied his father on trips and dreamed of having a healing ministry of his own; many times walking by his side  as his father prayed for people in the "invalid tent".&lt;ref&gt;"Claim Your Inheritance by Richard Roberts, 2002, The Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, pages 19-20,"&lt;/ref&gt; During the portions of the services where people were getting prayed for,&lt;ref&gt;"You Can Touch Heaven With Your Faith by Richard Roberts, 1991, The Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, page 23,"&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts was often standing on his chair clapping when people were healed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At a young age, Roberts’s music talent was evident to those around him. [[File:Richard Singing Young Boy.jpg|thumb|right|Richard singing at his father's crusades]]  At the age of 5 he had his first public performance at an Oral Roberts crusade in Baltimore, Maryland, standing on a chair in front of several thousand people singing "I Believe."&lt;ref name="SecondChance"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard |last=Roberts|title=He's the God of a Second Chance!|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4APGQAACAAJ|year=1985|publisher=R. Roberts}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also at an early age, his father began to teach him the game of golf.  With his first swing of the club, while in their front yard, he sent a ball right through the living room window of their home.  In his book, ''Expect A Miracle My Life and Ministry'' by Oral Roberts, Oral talks about the bond they gained through the game of golf. Roberts eventually became an excellent golfer and played with notable celebrities.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Though drawn to ministry, Roberts was made uncomfortable by all the attention his father received.  He was often teased by classmates and even teachers, and even got into fights about his father.  "I came home from school many a day with my shirt torn and my nose bloodied from being in fights with the other kids who made fun of me, my dad and the healing ministry of Jesus Christ." &lt;ref name="SecondChance"/&gt;  As a teenager, with the negative press his father was receiving and pressure from his father to sing at crusades, he began to pull away from involvement with his father’s ministry and began pursuing other talents and interests, such as singing.&lt;ref&gt;"Faith to Try Again by Richard Roberts, 1997, Albury Publishing, page 13"&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
As a teenager he learned to play the guitar and began singing in pizza parlors and eventually nightclubs around the state of Oklahoma.  There was a new dream in his heart, to become a nightclub singer in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name="SecondChance"/&gt;  In 1966, during Roberts’ senior year in high school he played the lead in his high school play [[The Sound of Music]].   He then was offered a music scholarship for the summer to the [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]] in Traverse City, Michigan, by the founder [[Joseph Maddy]], when Maddy brought a performing group to the [[Oral Roberts University]] campus.  According to Roberts’ autobiography, he landed the male lead in the campus production of "[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]].&lt;ref&gt;"Claim Your Inheritance by Richard Roberts, 2002, The Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, pages 14,"&lt;/ref&gt;

Graduating from Memorial High School in May of 1966&lt;ref&gt;"Tulsa People Magazine, Volume XI, Number 77, May 1998, page 19"&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts was accepted to three different universities and chose the [[University of Kansas]] to attend college due to its well-known music program and it being the farthest distance from Tulsa.&lt;ref&gt;"Claim Your Inheritance by Richard Roberts, 2002, The Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, page 15,"&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Richard Roberts and Shirley Jones.jpg|thumb|left|Richard Roberts and Shirley Jones]] During the summer of his freshman year he worked at the famous 8,000 seat, outdoor Starlight Theater in Kansas City,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://plus.google.com/u/0/+kcstarlight/about|title=Starlight Theatre - Google+|website=plus.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a number of performers including [[Shirley Jones]].&lt;ref name="SecondChance"/&gt; He also had been working in a number of night clubs and had been offered a contract to sing in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Claim Your Inheritance by Richard Roberts, 2002, The Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, page 21,"&lt;/ref&gt;

While at the University of Kansas, Roberts gets sick and had to go to the hospital, possibly needing surgery.  The surgery was avoided but soon after returning from the hospital, while alone in his room, he heard a voice, coming out of nowhere, telling him he is in the wrong place. "Where am I supposed to be?, he asks. The voice says, Oral Roberts University.&lt;ref name="SecondChance"/&gt; In the Fall 1967, Roberts dropped out of the University of Kansas and enrolled in Oral Roberts University.&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=http://www.oru.edu/prayer_tower/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-04-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501041305/http://www.oru.edu/prayer_tower/ |archivedate=2015-05-01 |df= }}"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1968 at the age of 19, two weeks before his birthday, Roberts dedicates his life to Jesus Christ&lt;ref name="SecondChance"/&gt; and he joined his father’s ministry as a singer on television and in crusades.&lt;ref&gt;"Faith to Try Again by Richard Roberts, 1997, Albury Publishing, page 35"&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Roberts received his bachelor’s degree in communication arts from Oral Roberts University in 1985. He received his master’s degree from the Oral Roberts University School of Theology and Missions in 1992&lt;ref&gt;''Oral Roberts University Alumni Directory'', 1998, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as his Doctor of Ministry degree in 2002 from Oral Roberts University.&lt;ref&gt;"Roberts Passes Helm to Son", ''[[The Bulletin]]'', January 28, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Against the wishes of his family and friends, Roberts married Patricia "Patti" Holcombe on November 27, 1968. In his book, ''He’s The God of a Second Chance'', Roberts’ states, ''"I was young and thought that I had all the answers to life. Of course, I didn't. I soon discovered that I had made a terrible mistake that I didn't know how to get out of. I did not believe in divorce. So I decided to make my marriage work."''&lt;ref&gt;''He’s The God of a Second Chance'', p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Together they have two children, Christi born in 1971 and Juli born in 1972. In 1978 Patti filed for divorce.&lt;ref&gt;"He’s The God of a Second Chance, page 31"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardener"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=4689 | title=Giving God a Hand | publisher=[[New York Review of Books]] | date=August 13, 1987 | first=Martin | last=Gardener | accessdate = 2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, she released a book called ''[[Ashes to Gold]]'', discussing her thoughts on Roberts' ministry and university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=uyi4H2ke5bcC&amp;pg=PT158&amp;lpg=PT158&amp;dq=%22ashes+to+gold%22+book+roberts&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SNusMaTYuS&amp;sig=CopHr1ZvxzrwbAH8bzS54-HQc8w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj5haPXtKLSAhXE34MKHbutBpQQ6AEIRTAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ashes%20to%20gold%22&amp;f=false|title=Field Guide to the Wild World of Religion: 2011 Edition|last=Dewey|first=Pamela|date=2013-02-01|publisher=eBookIt.com|isbn=9781456607227|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With his divorce hitting 300 newspapers nationwide and his position in the ministry, Roberts believed it was important to go before the executive staff of the ministry and the university to discuss his desire to remarry and seek their approval. They approved his request.&lt;ref&gt;"Expect a Miracle-My Life and Ministry by Oral Roberts, page 228"&lt;/ref&gt; Several weeks later, on January 11, 1980, Roberts married Linda Ann Salem at the campus chapel of [[Rollins College]] in Winter Park, Florida.&lt;ref&gt;"He’s The God of a Second Chance, page 54"&lt;/ref&gt;

Together Richard and Lindsay had four children.  After several miscarriages, their first child, Richard Oral, was born on January 17, 1984.  Within hours, complications developed and he died 36 hours after birth.  Jordan was born in 1985.  Olivia was born in 1987.  Chloe was born in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;"36 Hours with an Angle by Lindsay Roberts, 1990"&lt;/ref&gt;  Roberts has 3 grandchildren.

==Career==

===Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association===

At 19, Roberts joined his father’s ministry and became immediately involved in several areas of the ministry including radio, television and traveling with his father on domestic and international crusades.  His first trip was in December of the same year to Haiti singing with the music team, Oral Roberts Collegians. His first area of responsibility was reorganizing and developing the Collegians music group into the World Action Singers.  Roberts and this group would be featured in the new Sunday morning television program, taped in Los Angeles and prime-time television specials that were taped in different locations around the world.&lt;ref name="SecondChance"/&gt; 
Over the next decade Roberts sings on the television programs and produces more than 15 record albums. [[File:Richard Roberts PatBoone.jpg|thumb|right|Pat Boone Richard Roberts in Japan]] When not involved in television production Roberts travels the US and around the world performing in concerts and speaking at ministry sponsored events, as the ministry continues to raise funds to complete the building of the University.&lt;ref&gt;"Miracle of ORU, Abundant Life Magazine, January 1972"&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, Roberts travels and sings in numerous healing meetings with [[Kathryn Kuhlman]] from 1973-1975.&lt;ref name="SecondChance"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A Tribute to Kathryn Kuhlman, Abundant Life Magazine, May 1976"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"We are moving the earth again at ORU, November 1970"&lt;/ref&gt;[[Kathryn Kuhlman]] from 1973-1975. [[File:Richard Roberts Kathryn Kuhlman.jpeg|thumb|left|Richard Roberts Kathryn Kuhlman]]
 
Roberts’ world falls apart after his wife (Patti) files for divorce.&lt;ref name="Gardener"/&gt;  In the book ''Expect a Miracle'', Oral Roberts remembers his son coming to his office devastated, explaining what had just happened, asking what was to become of him and his work in the ministry.  Oral notes that numerous individuals, including close friends and ministers, advised Oral to remove Richard from the Ministry, send him overseas for a number of years and even disown him.  After prayer, Oral believed that God was not through with Richard and he was still to be involved in the ministry.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
 
Roberts remarries and continues traveling doing concerts and singing on television.  The concerts transform into a combination of music, preaching and ministry events where Roberts is praying for people and people are testifying they have been healed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SecondChance"/&gt;  In 1982, Roberts holds the first of many international crusades starting with South Africa.  According to the ministry website, oralroberts.com, Roberts has ministered in over 40 countries on six different continents including: Russia, India, Brazil, Australia, Niger, and Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;"www.oralroberts.com"&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Roberts continues holding domestic meetings and ministering on television programs.&lt;ref&gt;"Richard Roberts...His Ministry and His Message!, Abundant Life Magazine, April 1983"&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1984, Roberts begins a live daily one-hour program called Richard Roberts Live that combines ministry, music and special guests such as Richard Kiel, known for his role as Jaws in the James Bond movies and Donna Douglas, best known as Elly May Clampett in the television show The Beverly Hillbillies.&lt;ref&gt;"Abundant Live Magazine, October 1984"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TRACO Advertising"&gt;"TRACO Advertising Press Release – Richard Roberts Live, 1987,&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Richard Roberts Rose Grier.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Roberts Rose Grier]]

In 1985, Oral Roberts steps down and Richard Roberts is elected president of Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association (OREA) by its Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;"Abundant Life Magazine, December, 1985"&lt;/ref&gt;   In 1986, Roberts works with his father and helps found the International Charismatic Bible Ministries to support independent churches and ministries and to help expand opportunities for student recruitment for ORU.&lt;ref&gt;"Abundant Life Magazine, October Issue, 1987"&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1987, Roberts is elected as the executive vice president of Oral Roberts University and is involved in all areas of administration and presides over the ORU chapel services.  During the same time period, Roberts continues daily television, domestic crusades with his father, his own international crusades and speaking at churches and conferences across the country.&lt;ref&gt;"When All Hope is Gone, by Rochard Roberts, Harrison House Inc. publications,2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Oral Roberts announces to the Board that he will be stepping down as President of ORU.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===Oral Roberts University===

====Serving dual roles====

[[File:Richard_Roberts_Oral_Roberts.jpg|thumb|left|Commencement 2002]] 
On January 27, 1993, the Board of Regents elected Roberts as the second president of the university. For Roberts, the excitement is short lived.  Reports show the University is in debt as much as $52 million.&lt;ref&gt;"Claim Your Inheritance, Richard Roberts, Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, 2002, page 62"&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts stated:  "The University’s debt to asset ratio is not bad but it is operating at a deficit and spending $9 million a year in debt service."&lt;ref&gt;"The Joy of the Lord, by Richard Roberts, Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, 1995, page 15"&lt;/ref&gt;  Tuition and fees were not enough to keep up with expenses.  For years, the Ministry had been able to fund the short fall but it too was running tight budgets and not able to help as much as in the past.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In his ''The Joy of the Lord'' book, Roberts talks about the daily pressure and concerns about cash flow.  "I spent most of my time putting out fires with bankers and creditors …and awoke many nights with nightmares of the University shutting down."  &lt;ref&gt;"Claim Your Inheritance, Richard Roberts, Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, 2002, page 64"&lt;/ref&gt; 
Roberts assembled a team from his executive staff to work with him on resolving the financial problems.  They meet each morning to review the bank balances and discuss the accounts payable that were due that day.  Jeanne Alcott, Vice President of Partner Communications – ''"Shortly after becoming President, Richard formed a special committee, a management team, to meet with him every morning concerning these seemingly impossible situations.   Budgets had been cut and employees had been laid off."'' &lt;ref&gt;"The Joy of the Lord, by Richard Roberts, Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, 1995, page 61"&lt;/ref&gt; George Fisher – Vice President for University Development  stated,  "''I often wondered what people would have thought if they had known how little cash we had.  Here we were, operating a $50 million enterprise with less cash in our bank accounts than many individuals have.  Usually, after we conducted as much business as possible, the meetings turned into prayer meetings because we were so overwhelmed by the problems."''  &lt;ref&gt;"The Joy of the Lord, by Richard Roberts, Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, 1995, page 65"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Marketing the university for growth====

Roberts pushes his team to increase enrollment, tighten budgets and find additional revenue streams.  At the same time, Roberts uses his ministry television program to promote the University, increase enrollment and raise funds for student scholarships. He starts the Adopt A Student scholarship campaign as one of these efforts.&lt;ref&gt;"Miracles Now, Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association Vol.2. No. 5 Sept.?Oct. 1998"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Miracles Now,2002"&lt;/ref&gt;   In addition, he promotes special projects on the ministry's television program to help pay for needed university renovations.  Over the next four years, enrollment increases by 1,200 students and the debt is reduced by 50 percent &lt;ref&gt;"Excellence Magazine, Oral Roberts University, Winter 1995, page 5"&lt;/ref&gt;  Roberts used his Ministry connections to help with recruitment, specifically in the African American community.  Through his speaking at churches and conferences, he was mainly responsible for the 20% African American student body.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  ORU receives the Racial Harmony Award from the Council for Christian Colleges and Universities in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"Excellence Magazine, Oral Roberts University, Fall 2002"&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Roberts recognizes the importance of the Athletic Program for national prominence and student recruitment. In 1993, Roberts makes a number of changes in the athletic program hiring [[Bill Self]] as head basketball coach. Roberts changes the school mascot from the Titans to The Golden Eagles and &lt;ref&gt;"Excellence Magazine, Oral Roberts University, Summer 1997"&lt;/ref&gt; hires Mike Carter as the new Director of Athletics.&lt;ref&gt;"Excellence Magazine, Oral Roberts University, Winter 1995"&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
As president of the university, Roberts began incorporating the university and students as part of the crusade/healing rally team. [[File:Richard Roberts Kinshasa1987.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Roberts Kinshasa1987]] Students and staff from the School of Nursing and staff from the School of Business join doctors as a part of the crusade team. Roberts has outreaches in Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Ghana and Niger that include seminars and surgeries.&lt;ref&gt;"New Face in Niger, Tulsa World, Saturday, February 17, 2007"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Healing the body and soul – ORU takes Gospel and medical skills to Africa, Tulsa World, Saturday, February 18, 2006"&lt;/ref&gt;  Tulsa City Council presents ORU president Richard Roberts with a Key to the City of Tulsa to reflect their "eternal gratitude for your efforts on our behalf." A proclamation was read regarding ORU’s contribution to the Tulsa community. In one semester, ORU students gave a total of 2,500 hours of their time in service to organizations in Tulsa.&lt;ref&gt;"ORU President gets Key to the City, Make Your Day Count Magazine, Winter 2006"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Key to the City.jpg|thumb|right|Richard Roberts accepts keys to the City - Tulsa, OK]]

Roberts pushes to increase participation in the Oral Roberts University Educational Fellowship organization to expand the base of Christian elementary and secondary schools involvement to help bolster enrollment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oru.edu/academics/resources/new_oruef/|title=New ORU Educational Fellowship Contact Information -- ORU|first=Jonathan Van|last=Risseghem|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also focuses on international affiliation agreements. Students could attend classes as at various locations, acquire credit hours and potentially receive an accredited degree from ORU.&lt;ref&gt;"Excellence Magazine, Oral Roberts University, Summer 1997, What's Happening at ORU, Summer 1997"&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure, agreements were signed with schools in Sweden, England, Korea,  Singapore, Rhema Bible Training Center in Broken Arrow, OK, and Christ for the Nations in Dallas, Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oru.edu/academics/resources/livets_ord.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905201157/http://www.oru.edu/academics/resources/livets_ord.php |archivedate=2015-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy====

In October 2007, three former professors filed a lawsuit against Oral Roberts University&lt;ref name="The Oklahoma State Courts Network"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.oscn.net/applications/oscn/GetCaseInformation.asp?submitted=true&amp;viewtype=caseGeneral&amp;casemasterID=2032027&amp;db=Tulsa | title = OCIS Case Summary for CJ-2007-6543- SWAILS, DR JOHN v.

====Resignation====

{{Wikinews|Richard Roberts takes leave of absence from Oral Roberts University}} On October 17, 2007 Roberts asked for and was granted an indefinite leave of absence from the school by the university's board of regents, citing the "toll" the lawsuit and attendant allegations have taken on him and his family.&lt;ref name="toll"&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ralph |last=Blumenthal|title=President of Oral Roberts to Take Leave of Absence|publisher=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/18/us/18oral.html?fta=y|date=2007-11-18|accessdate=2007-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement Roberts said, "I don't know how long this leave of absence will last... I pray and believe that in God's timing, and when the Board feels that it is appropriate, I will be back at my post as President."&lt;ref name="toll"/&gt; [[Billy Joe Daugherty]] of Victory Christian Center was named executive regent of the board of regents and interim president.&lt;ref name="pearsons"&gt;{{Cite news|first=April|last=Marciszewski|title=Roberts takes ORU leave|publisher=Tulsa World|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071018_1_A1_hTheO62814 |date=2007-10-18|accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chairman of the board of regents [[George Pearsons]] noted the temporary resignation was not an admission of guilt.&lt;ref name="pearsons"/&gt;

On November 13, the tenured faculty of Oral Roberts University approved a nonbinding vote of no confidence in Roberts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Faculty Opposes Oral Roberts President|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/14/education/14oral.html|publisher=The New York Times|work=Associated Press|date=2007-11-14|accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vote was nearly unanimous according to a professor in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=April|last=Marciszewski|title=ORU faculty gives vote of no confidence|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=071114_1_A1_spanc48573|work=Tulsa World|date=2007-11-15|accessdate=2007-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts tendered his resignation to the university's board of regents on November 23, 2007, effective immediately. In an emailed statement he said, "I love ORU with all my heart. I love the students, faculty, staff and administration and I want to see God's best for all of them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/11/23/national/a165630S41.DTL "Embattled Oral Roberts President Resigns"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213050453/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2007%2F11%2F23%2Fnational%2Fa165630S41.DTL |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2008, the ORU Board of Regents voted unanimously to name Richard Roberts president emeritus in honor of his work during 15 years as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = April | last = Marciszewski | title = $62 million for ORU | date = 2008-01-15 | url = http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?articleID=20080115_1__hThea88026 | work = Tulsa World | accessdate = 2010-10-01 | quote = On Monday, regents voted unanimously to name Richard Roberts president emeritus to honor his work during 15 years as president, Pearsons said.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Resolution====

The Huddleston lawsuit was dismissed, with ORU claiming he was nothing more than a disgruntled employee. Huddleston’s attorney stated there would be an appeal, but this never came to pass.&lt;ref name="ap.google.com"/&gt;
 
In a written statement, the university denied "purposely or improperly" destroying documents. Upon review, it was discovered that the shredded documents had nothing to do with any allegations and were a part of normal policy, required by law for the privacy and protection of students and ministry donors.&lt;ref name="tulsaworld.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

By October 2008, the original three cases for wrongful discharge had been dismissed or settled.&lt;ref name="The Oklahoma State Courts Network"/&gt; 
 
No evidence regarding the additional allegations made against Roberts or the university was produced.  No charges were filed and all other lawsuits were dismissed.&lt;ref name="The Oklahoma State Courts Network"/&gt;

'''Salavat Fidai''' ({{lang-ba|Фидаи Салауат Фидай улы}}, {{lang-ru|Фидаи, Салават Фидаевич}}) is a Russian sculptor who makes miniature sculptures out of pencil graphite. He currently lives in Ufa, [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cntraveller.in/story/artist-world-point/#s-custqutub-minar-delhi-india|title=The artist who has the world on point|date=2016-10-19|work=Condé Nast Traveller India|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fidai began his professional career as a lawyer and spent more than 25 years in this profession.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pencilbook|last=Fidai|first=Salavat|publisher=Pareto-Print|year=2016|isbn=978-5-00028-082-9|location=Russia|pages=3-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, during the economic crisis in Russia, he changed occupations to work full-time as an artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

He entered art through digital photography, focusing on still-life photographs of fruits and vegetables. This was compiled into a series titled, "The Quiet Life of Things."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.behance.net/gallery/20350583/The-quiet-life-of-things|title=Behance - The quiet life of things|last=|first=|date=|website=www.behance.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928154918/https://www.behance.net/gallery/20350583/The-quiet-life-of-things|archive-date=2015-09-28|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series was presented at the exhibitions "Metropolitan History" in Moscow and "Eros: The Times and Faces" in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.salavatfidai.com/exhibitions.html|title=Salavat Fidai - Exhibitions|last=|first=|date=|website=Salavat Fidai|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, he experimented with expressionism and impressionism through paint. He created a series titled "The Rainy City," which was presented in 2015 at "The Muse Should Work" in St. Petersburg.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2014, Fidai started creating miniature paintings on matchboxes, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, and grains of rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://u7a.ru/articles/society/9466|title=Башкирия: Как прокормить семью и не лишиться хобби|website=u7a.ru|access-date=2017-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he began sculpting miniature figures out of pencil graphite. The process is challenging due to the fragile nature of graphite and it is common for the miniature sculptures to fracture after spending many hours on a single piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2015/07/delicate-pencil-lead-carvings-by-salavat-fidai/|title=Delicate Pencil Lead Sculptures Carved by Salavat Fidai|date=2015-07-04|work=Colossal|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://oddstuffmagazine.com/extraordinary-art-on-pencil-tips-by-dalton-ghetti.html|title=Miniature Art on the Tip of Pencil by Dalton Ghetti|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2015/07/delicate-pencil-lead-carvings-by-salavat-fidai/|title=Delicate Pencil Lead Sculptures Carved by Salavat Fidai|date=2015-07-04|work=Colossal|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fidai spends between six and twelve hours an average to produce a statuette, while complicated models take between two and three days to create. He uses a craft knife and a stereo microscope for creating the tiny sculptures.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://graphics.wsj.com/image-grid/od50-spring2017/4063/pencil-in-a-micro-sculpture|title=Pencil In a Micro-Sculpture {{!}} The Off Duty 50: Sizing Up Spring's Trends|last=Graphics|first=WSJ.com News|work=The Wall Street Journal|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, he used jumbo pencils with a graphite diameter of 5mm. He now primarily uses lead between 0.5 and 2mm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tass.ru/v-strane/4109254|title=Житель Уфы вырезал на грифелях карандашей 30 фигур по мотивам "Игры престолов"|work=ТАСС|access-date=2017-04-13|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.todayonline.com/entertainment/television/game-thrones-tips-pencils|title=Game of Thrones - on the tips of pencils|website=www.todayonline.com|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His microsculptures have featured characters from movies and cartoons, animals, objects from popular culture, comic book characters, famous works of art, household items, and architectural icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://twistedsifter.com/2015/04/pencil-tip-carvings-by-salavat-fidai/|title=This Guy Carves Miniature Artworks Onto the Tips of Pencils|date=2015-04-14|work=TwistedSifter|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cntraveller.in/story/artist-world-point/#s-custqutub-minar-delhi-india|title=The artist who has the world on point|date=2016-10-19|work=Condé Nast Traveller India|access-date=2017-11-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
