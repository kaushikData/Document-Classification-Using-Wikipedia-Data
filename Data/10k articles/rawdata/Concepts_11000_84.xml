{{Emotion}}

'''Affection,''' '''attraction''', '''infatuation''', or '''fondness''' is a "[[disposition]] or state of mind or body"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/affection|title=Affection - Define Affection at Dictionary.com|website=Dictionary.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is often associated with a [[feeling]] or type of [[love]]. It has given rise to a number of branches of [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] concerning emotion, disease, influence, and state of being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotions-17th18th/LD7Hutcheson.html|title=17th and 18th Century Theories of Emotions &gt; Francis Hutcheson on the Emotions (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|website=Plato.stanford.edu|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Affection" is popularly used to denote a feeling or type of [[love]], amounting to more than goodwill or [[friendship]]. Writers on [[ethics]] generally use the word to refer to distinct states of feeling, both lasting and spasmodic. Some contrast it with ''[[passion (emotion)|passion]]'' as being free from the distinctively sensual element.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Affection|volume=1|pages=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even a very simple demonstration of affection can have a broad variety of emotional reactions, from embarrassment to disgust to pleasure and annoyance. It also has a different physical effect on the giver and the receiver.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Effects of Affection {{!}} Research Matters|url = https://researchmatters.asu.edu/stories/effects-affection-960|website = researchmatters.asu.edu|accessdate = 2015-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Restricted definition==
[[File:Smooches (baby and child kiss).jpg|thumb|right|A young girl kisses a baby on the cheek.]]
More specifically, the word has been restricted to [[emotion]]al states, the object of which is a living thing such as a human or animal.  Affection is compared with passion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=94G2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=affection+vs+passion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi3o_XQqMrXAhWFXRoKHRb6CnwQuwUIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Cuba and the Politics of Passion|first=Damián J.|last=Fernández|date=1 January 2010|publisher=University of Texas Press|accessdate=19 November 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;, from the Greek "[[pathos]]". As such it appears in the writings of [[France|French]] philosopher [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/descartes1649part2.pdf|format=PDF|title=The Passions of the Soul|author=René Descartes|website=Earlymoderntexts.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Netherlands|Dutch]] philosopher [[Baruch Spinoza]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/spinoza-psychological/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Michael|last=LeBuffe|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=19 November 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=19 November 2017|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and most of the writings of early British ethicists. However, on various grounds (e.g., that it does not involve anxiety or excitement and that it is comparatively inert and compatible with the entire absence of the sensuous element), it is generally and usefully distinguished from passion.{{clarification|date=November 2017}} In this narrower sense, the word has played a great part in ethical systems, which have spoken of the social or parental ''affections'' as in some sense a part of moral obligations.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; For a consideration of these and similar problems, which depend ultimately on the degree in which the affections are regarded as voluntary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlymoderntexts.com/assets/pdfs/sidgwick1874book4.pdf|p=345–349|title=Methods of Ethics|website=Earlymoderntexts.com|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expression==
{{Further information|Public display of affection}}
Affection can be communicated by looks, words, gestures, or touches. Affectionate behavior may have evolved from parental nurturing behavior due to its associations with hormonal rewards.&lt;ref&gt;according to [[Communication]] professor Kory Floyd of the [[University of Arizona]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such affection has been shown to influence brain development in infants.&lt;ref&gt;Infant Observation: International Journal of Infant Observation and Its Applications&lt;/ref&gt; 
Expressions of affection can be unwelcome if they pose implied threats to one's well being. If welcomed, affectionate behavior  may be associated with  various health benefits. It has been proposed that positive sentiments increase the propensity of people to interact and that familiarity gained through affection increases positive sentiments among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techsociety.com/articles/JMF_Lawtonetal.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316162825/http://www.techsociety.com/articles/JMF_Lawtonetal.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefits of affection===
Affection exchange is seen as an adaptive human behavior that contributes to greater physical and mental well-being. The expression of affection mediates emotional, physical, and relational benefits for the individual and significant counterparts. The communication of positive feelings towards others has shown health benefits that include; lower stress hormones, lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure and stronger immune system. [https://asunow.asu.edu/content/study-expressing-love-can-improve-your-health Affection Expression ] Benefits are internally noticed when the emotion is expressed and not merely felt, if affection is not reciprocated through the receiver, effects of the affection are still felt through the giver. 

===Parental relationships===
Affectionate behavior is often regarded as the result of parental nurturing behavior due to its associations with hormonal rewards. Positive and negative parental behaviors can be linked to later life health problems. Abuse is a common attribute to poor health in later life, as the lack of affection leads to naturally poorer well-being and mental health. A 2013 study, [http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/lack-of-parental-warmth-abuse-248580 UCLA affection ] showed the effects of early child abuse and the outcome between lack of affection and the strong biological link for how these negative early-life experiences affect physical health.

{{Platonism}}
In [[philosophy]], '''anamnesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|æ|m|ˈ|n|iː|s|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-grc|ἀνάμνησις}}) is a concept in [[Plato]]'s [[epistemology|epistemological]] and psychological theory that he develops in his [[dialogue]]s ''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]]'' and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', and alludes to in his ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]''.

It is the idea that humans possess innate knowledge (perhaps acquired before birth) and that learning consists of rediscovering that knowledge within us.

==''Meno''==
In ''Meno'', Plato's character (and old teacher) [[Socrates]] is challenged by Meno with what has become known as the [[Sophism|sophistic]] paradox, or the paradox of knowledge:

:Meno:  And how are you going to search for [the nature of virtue] when you don't know at all what it is, Socrates?  Which of all the things you don't know will you set up as target for your search?  And even if you actually come across it, how will you know that it ''is'' that thing which you don't know?&lt;ref&gt;''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]]'' 80d&lt;/ref&gt;

In other words, if you don't know any of the attributes, properties, and/or other descriptive markers of any kind that help signify what something is (physical or otherwise), you won't recognize it, even if you come across it. And, as consequence, if the converse is true, and you ''do'' know the attributes, properties and/or other descriptive markers of this thing, then you shouldn't need to seek it out at all.  The result of this line of thinking is that, in either instance, there is no point trying to gain that "something"; in the case of Plato's aforementioned work, there is no point in seeking knowledge.

Socrates' response is to develop his theory of ''anamnesis''.  He suggests that the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is immortal, and repeatedly [[metempsychosis|incarnated]]; knowledge is in the soul from eternity (86b), but each time the soul is incarnated its knowledge is forgotten in the trauma of birth.  What one perceives to be learning, then, is the recovery of what one has forgotten.  (Once it has been brought back it is true belief, to be turned into genuine knowledge by understanding.)  And thus Socrates (and Plato) sees himself, not as a teacher, but as a [[Maieutics|midwife]], aiding with the birth of knowledge that was already there in the student.

The theory is illustrated by Socrates asking a slave boy questions about geometry.  At first the boy gives the wrong answer; when this is pointed out to him, he is puzzled, but by asking questions Socrates is able to help him to reach the correct answer.  This is intended to show that, as the boy wasn't told the answer, he could only have reached the truth by recollecting what he had already known but forgotten.

==''Phaedo''==
In ''[[Phaedo]]'', Plato develops his theory of ''anamnesis'', in part by combining it with his theory of [[Idea#Plato|Form]]s.  First, he elaborates how ''anamnesis'' can be achieved: whereas in ''Meno'' nothing more than Socrates' method of questioning is offered, in ''Phaedo'' Plato presents a way of living that would enable one to overcome the misleading nature of the body through ''[[Catharsis|katharsis]]'' (Greek: κάθαρσις; “cleansing” (from guilt or defilement), “purification”).  The body and its senses are the source of error; knowledge can only be regained through the use of our reason, contemplating things with the soul ([[noesis]]) (see 66 b–d).

Secondly, he makes clear that genuine knowledge, as opposed to mere true belief ([[doxa]]), is distinguished by its content.  One can only know eternal truths, for they are the only truths that can have been in the soul from eternity.  Though it can be very useful to have a true belief about, say, the best way to get from London to Oxford, such a belief does not qualify as knowledge; how could the human soul know such factually [[contingent propositions]] for all eternity?

==Neoplatonism==
For the later interpreters of Plato, ''anamnesis'' was less an [[epistemic]] assertion than an [[ontological]] one.  [[Plotinus]] himself did not posit recollection in the strict sense of the term, because all knowledge of universally important ideas ([[logos]]) came from a source outside of time (Dyad or the divine [[nous]]), and was accessible, by means of contemplation, to the soul as part of [[noesis]]. They were more objects of experience, of [[noesis|inner knowledge]] or [[insight]], than of recollection.  Despite this, in [[Neoplatonism]], the theory of ''anamnesis'' became part of the mythology of the descent of the soul.

[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s short work ''De Antro Nympharum'' (ostensibly a commentary on the brief passage in  ''Odyssey'' 13) elucidated this notion, as did [[Macrobius]]'s much longer ''Commentary on the Dream of Scipio''.  The idea of psychic memory was used by Neoplatonists to demonstrate the celestial and immaterial origins of the soul, and to explain how memories of the world-soul could be recalled by everyday human beings.  As such, psychic recollection was intrinsically connected to the Platonic conception of the soul itself.  Since the contents of individual "material" or physical memories were trivial, only the universal recollection of Forms, or divine objects, drew one closer to the immortal source of being.

''Anamnesis'' is the closest that human minds can come to experiencing the freedom of the soul prior to its being encumbered by matter.  The process of incarnation is described in Neoplatonism as a trauma that causes the soul to forget its experiences (and often its divine origins as well). The storyteller's voice is concealed by John and Plato in order to pursue their anamnetic efforts and to encourage the following generations to not only be readers but partakers in their original discussions on the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parsenios |first1=George L. |title=Anamnesis and the Silent Narrator in Plato and John |date=March 2017 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gratitude as an example of divine salvation was expressed by offering to God the first fruits of the harvest which maintains an identity with those who performed these actions in the past and therefore actualising them in the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cody|first=Alfred|date=January 2006|title=Little Historical Creed or little Historical Anamnesis|url=|journal=The Catholic Biblical Quarterly|volume=Jan 2006|pages=9|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[aeronautics]], the '''aspect ratio''' of a [[wing]] is the ratio of its [[Wingspan|span]] to its mean [[chord (aircraft)|chord]]. It is equal to the square of the wingspan divided by the wing area. Thus, a long, narrow wing has a high aspect ratio, whereas a short, wide wing has a low aspect ratio.&lt;ref name="Kermode"&gt;Kermode, A.C. (1972), ''Mechanics of Flight'', Chapter 3, (p.103, eighth edition), Pitman Publishing Limited, London {{ISBN|0-273-31623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspect ratio and other features of the [[Planform (aeronautics)|planform]] are often used to predict the aerodynamic efficiency of a wing because the [[lift-to-drag ratio]] increases with aspect ratio, improving [[fuel economy in aircraft]].

&lt;math&gt;\text{AR} \equiv \frac{b^2}{S} = \frac{b}{\text{SMC}}&lt;/math&gt;

== Mechanism ==
Roughly speaking, an airplane in flight can be imagined to affect a circular cylinder of air with a diameter equal to the wingspan.&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', section 5.15&lt;/ref&gt; A large wingspan affects a large cylinder of air, and a small wingspan affects a small cylinder of air. A small air cylinder must be pushed down with a greater power (energy change per unit time) than a large cylinder in order to produce an equal upward force (momentum change per unit time). This is because giving the same momentum change to a smaller mass of air requires giving it a greater velocity change, and a much greater energy change because energy is proportional to the square of the velocity while momentum is only linearly proportional to the velocity. The aft-leaning component of this change in velocity is proportional to the [[lift-induced drag|induced drag]], which is the force needed to take up that power at that airspeed.  

The interaction between undisturbed air outside the cylinder of air, and the downward-moving cylinder of air occurs at the wingtips and can be seen as [[wingtip vortices]].

It is important to keep in mind that this is a drastic oversimplification, and an airplane wing affects a very large area around itself.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, Doug, ''Understanding Aerodynamics: Arguing from the Real Physics'', section 3.3.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a long, narrow wing with a high aspect ratio has aerodynamic advantages like better lift-to-drag-ratio (see also details below), there are several reasons why not ''all'' aircraft have high aspect wings:

* '''Structural''': A long wing has higher [[Torque|bending stress]] for a given load than a short one and therefore requires higher structural-design (architectural and/or material) specifications.  Also, longer wings may have some torsion for a given load, and in some applications this torsion is undesirable (e.g. if the warped wing interferes with [[aileron]] effect).
* '''Maneuverability''': a low aspect-ratio wing will have a higher [[Aircraft principal axes|roll]] angular acceleration  than one of high aspect ratio, because a high-aspect-ratio wing has a higher moment of inertia to overcome. In a steady roll, the longer wing gives a higher roll moment because of the longer moment arm of the aileron. Low  aspect ratio wings are usually used on [[fighter aircraft]], not only for the higher roll rates, but especially for longer chord and thinner airfoils involved in supersonic flight.
* '''Parasitic drag''':  While high aspect wings create less induced drag, they have greater [[parasitic drag]], (drag due to shape, frontal area, and surface friction).  This is because, for an equal wing ''area'', the average chord (length in the direction of wind travel over the wing) is smaller.  Due to the effects of [[Reynolds number]], the value of the section drag coefficient is an inverse logarithmic function of the characteristic length of the surface, which means that, even if two wings of the same area are flying at equal speeds and equal angles of attack, the section drag coefficient is slightly higher on the wing with the smaller chord.  However, this variation is very small when compared to the variation in induced drag with changing wingspan.&lt;br /&gt;For example,&lt;ref&gt;Dommasch, D.O., Sherby, S.S., and Connolly, T.F. (1961), ''Airplane Aerodynamics'', page 128, Pitman Publishing Corp. New York&lt;/ref&gt; the section drag coefficient &lt;math&gt;c_d\;&lt;/math&gt; of a [[NACA]] 23012 airfoil (at typical lift coefficients) is inversely proportional to chord length to the power 0.129: &lt;br /&gt;{{pad|2em}} &lt;math&gt;c_d \varpropto \frac{1}{(\text{chord})^{0.129}}.&lt;/math&gt; 
:A 20% increase in chord length would decrease the section drag coefficient by 2.38%.

* '''Practicality''':  low aspect ratios have a greater useful internal volume, since the maximum thickness is greater, which can be used to house the fuel tanks, retractable [[landing gear]] and other systems.
* '''Airfield Size''': Airfields, hangars and other ground equipment define a maximum wingspan, which cannot be exceeded, and to generate enough lift at the given wingspan, the aircraft designer has to lower the aspect-ratio and increase the total wing area. This limits the [[Airbus A380]] to 80m wide with an aspect ratio of 7.8, while the [[Boeing 787]] or [[Airbus A350]] have an aspect ratio of 9.5, influencing flight economy.&lt;ref name=leeUp&gt;Hamilton, Scott.

===Variable aspect ratio===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
Aircraft which approach or exceed the speed of sound sometimes incorporate [[variable-sweep wing]]s. These wings give a high aspect ratio when unswept and a low aspect ratio at maximum sweep.

In subsonic flow, steeply swept and narrow wings are inefficient compared to a high-aspect-ratio wing. However, as the flow becomes transonic and then supersonic, the [[shock wave]] first generated along the wing's upper surface causes [[wave drag]] on the aircraft, and this drag is proportional to the span of the wing. Thus a long span, valuable at low speeds, causes excessive drag at transonic and supersonic speeds.

By varying the sweep the wing can be optimised for the current flight speed. However the extra weight and complexity of a moveable wing mean that it is not often used.

==Birds and bats==
{{See also|Bird flight|Bat flight}}
The aspect ratios of birds' and bats' wings vary considerably.  Birds that fly long distances or spend long periods soaring such as [[albatross]]es and [[eagle]]s often have wings of high aspect ratio. By contrast, birds which require good maneuverability, such as the [[Eurasian sparrowhawk]], have wings of low aspect ratio.

==Details==
For a constant-chord wing of chord ''c'' and span ''b'', the aspect ratio is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;AR = {b\over c}&lt;/math&gt;

If the wing is swept, ''c'' is measured parallel to the direction of forward flight.

For most wings the length of the chord is not a constant but varies along the wing, so the aspect ratio ''AR'' is defined as the square of the [[wingspan]] ''b'' divided by the wing area ''S''.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John D. Jr, ''Introduction to Flight'', Equation 5.26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', sub-section 5.13(f)&lt;/ref&gt; In symbols,
:&lt;math&gt;AR = {b^2 \over S}&lt;/math&gt;.

For such a wing with varying chord, the [[Chord (aeronautics)#Standard mean chord|standard mean chord]] ''SMC'' is defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;SMC = {S\over b} = {b\over AR}&lt;/math&gt;

The performance of aspect ratio AR  related to the lift-to-drag-ratio and wingtip vortices is illustrated in the formula used to calculate the drag coefficient of an aircraft &lt;math&gt;C_d\;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John D. Jr, ''Introduction to Flight'', section 5.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J., ''Aerodynamics'', sub-equation 5.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, John D. Jr, ''Fundamentals of Aerodynamics'', Equation 5.63 (4th edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wetted aspect ratio===
The '''wetted aspect ratio''' considers the whole wetted surface area of the airframe, &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt;, rather than just the wing. It is a better measure of the aerodynamic efficiency of an aircraft than the [[aspect ratio (wing)|wing aspect ratio]]. It is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathit{AR}_{\mathrm{wet}} = {b^2 \over S_w}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is span and &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is the [[wetted surface]].

Illustrative examples are provided by the [[Boeing B-47]] and [[Avro Vulcan]]. Both aircraft have very similar performance although they are radically different. The B-47 has a high aspect ratio wing, while the Avro Vulcan has a low aspect ratio wing. They have, however, a very similar wetted aspect ratio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meridian-int-res.com/Aeronautics/Burnelli.htm |title=The Lifting Fuselage Body |publisher=Meridian-int-res.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Assisted Human Reproduction Act''''' (the ''Act'') is law enacted by the Parliament of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;''Assisted Human Reproduction Act'', S.C. 2004, c. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to regulate assisted human reproduction (AHR) and related research.  It is one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation in the world concerning reproductive technologies and related research. It was introduced and passed in 2004 and was fully in force by 2007.

The ''Act'' was meant to provide Canadians with a system of [[licensing]], [[surveillance|monitoring]], [[inspection]] and [[enforcement]] of activities relating to AHR in order to protect and promote Canadians' health, safety and values. It identifies prohibited activities, as well as controlled activities, which are AHR activities that can be performed in Canada but require a licence and adherence to the regulations.&lt;ref name="Paterson2014"&gt;Stephanie Paterson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LZHdAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA164 Fertile Ground: Exploring Reproduction in Canada]''. MQUP; June 2014. {{ISBN|978-0-7735-9212-4}}. p. 164–.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a 2010 Supreme Court case that ruled that certain sections of the Act exceeded the federal government's legislative power means that the scope of the Act's regulatory framework was significantly reduced (see below).

==Constitutional validity==

{{main|Reference re Assisted Human Reproduction Act}}

On December 22, 2010, the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] declared some sections of the ''Assisted Human Reproduction Act'' unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc.lexum.org/en/2010/2010scc61/2010scc61.html Reference re Assisted Human Reproduction Act, 2010 SCC 61] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111104204506/http://scc.lexum.org/en/2010/2010scc61/2010scc61.html |date=2011-11-04 }}, [2010] 3 S.C.R. 457&lt;/ref&gt; It was ruled that the sections listed below exceeded the [[Canadian federalism|legislative jurisdiction]] of the [[Parliament of Canada]] under the ''[[Constitution Act, 1867]]'':

* 10,11,13: Certain provisions regarding controlled activities
* 14-18: Certain provisions regarding privacy and access to information
* 40(2), 40(3), 40(3.1), 40(4), 40(5), 44(2), 44(3): Certain provisions regarding administration

===Prohibited activities===
Prohibited activities, defined in sections 5 to 9 of the ''Act'', are AHR activities that Parliament has determined to be ethically unacceptable or incompatible with Canadian values, or to pose significant risks to the health, safety and values of Canadians. These activities are not allowed in Canada. Prohibitions include:
*Creating an ''in vitro'' embryo for any purpose other than creating a human being or improving or providing instruction in assisted reproduction procedures
*Human cloning.
*Pre-selecting or increasing the probability that an embryo will be a particular sex (except to prevent a sex-linked genetic condition).
*Transplanting a sperm, egg, embryo or foetus of a non-human life form into a human being, or using a sperm, egg, or ''in vitro'' embryo that was transplanted into a non-human life form to create a human being
*Creating a hybrid for the purpose of reproduction, or transplanting a hybrid into a human being or non-human life form
*Creating a chimera for any purpose, or transplanting a chimera into a human being or non-human life form
*Using gametes or ''in vitro'' embryos without the consent of the donor of the gametes or embryo
*Obtaining gametes from a person under 18 years of age (except for own use preservation purposes)
*Paying, offering to pay, or advertising payment for sperm, eggs or ''in vitro'' embryos from donors or for the services of surrogate mothers (including payment to a third party for arranging for the services of a surrogate mother)

This last prohibition prevents the "commercialization" of human reproduction in Canada. While the ''Act'' currently allows donors and surrogate mothers to be reimbursed for legitimate expenses, [[Health Canada]] is developing specific regulations about what constitutes a legitimate expenditure.

===Controlled activities===
Controlled activities, set out in sections 10 to 12 of the ''Act'', are AHR activities permitted if performed in accordance with regulations and by a licensed clinic or individual in licensed premises. However, section 10, which addressed the "use of human reproductive material," and section 11, which addressed "transgenics," were ruled ''ultra vires''. Section 12, which addresses the "reimbursement of expenditures" for providing gametes and surrogacy services, is ''intra vires'' but is not yet in force.

In general, '''bootstrapping''' usually refers to a self-starting process that is supposed to proceed without external input.  In [[computer technology]] the term (usually shortened to '''booting''') usually refers to the process of loading the basic software into the memory of a computer after power-on or general reset, especially the [[operating system]] which will then take care of loading other software as needed.

The term appears to have originated in the early 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century United States (particularly in the phrase "pull oneself over a fence by one's bootstraps") to mean an absurdly impossible action, an [[adynaton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-boo2.htm World Wide Words: Boot], Michael Quinion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="linguist-listserv"&gt;{{cite mailing list | url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2005-August/053187.html | title=bootstraps--speculation/questions | date=2005-08-28 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129230419/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind0508D&amp;L=ADS-L&amp;P=14748 | archive-date=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="examples"&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2005-August/052756.html |title=figurative 'bootstraps' |date=2005-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
[[Image:Dr Martens, black, old.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of boots with one bootstrap visible]]
Tall [[boot]]s may have a tab, loop or handle at the top known as a bootstrap, allowing one to use fingers or a [[Boot jack|boot hook]] tool to help pulling the boots on. The [[saying]] "to {{linktext|pull oneself up by one's bootstraps}}"&lt;ref name="examples"/&gt; was already in use during the 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century as an example of an impossible task.  The [[idiom]] dates at least to 1834, when it appeared in the ''Workingman's Advocate'': "It is conjectured that Mr. Murphee will now be enabled to hand himself over the Cumberland river or a barn yard fence by the straps of his boots."&lt;ref name=Freeman1&gt;Jan Freeman, [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/theword/2009/01/bootstraps_and.html Bootstraps and Baron Munchausen], ''[[Boston.com]]'', January 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1860 it appeared in a comment on [[philosophy of mind]]: "The attempt of the mind to analyze itself [is] an effort analogous to one who would lift himself by his own bootstraps."&lt;ref&gt;Jan Freeman, [http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2009/01/25/the_unkindliest_cut/ The unkindliest cut], ''[[Boston.com]]'', January 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Bootstrap as a metaphor, meaning to better oneself by one's own unaided efforts, was in use in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' cited in the Oxford English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; This metaphor spawned additional metaphors for a series of self-sustaining processes that proceed without external help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/290800.html|title='Pull yourself up by your bootstraps' - the meaning and origin of this phrase|first=Gary|last=Martin|website=Phrasefinder|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is sometimes attributed to a story in [[Rudolf Erich Raspe]]'s ''[[wikisource:The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen|The Surprising Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]'', but in that story [[Baron Munchausen]] pulls himself (and his horse) out of a swamp by his hair (specifically, his pigtail), not by his bootstraps{{snd}} and no explicit reference to bootstraps has been found elsewhere in the various versions of the Munchausen tales.&lt;ref name="Freeman1" /&gt;

==Applications==

===Computing===

====Software loading and execution====
{{main article | Booting | Reboot (computing)}}
'''Booting''' is the process of starting a computer, specifically with regard to starting its software.  The process involves a chain of stages, in which at each stage a smaller, simpler program loads and then executes the larger, more complicated program of the next stage.  It is in this sense that the computer "pulls itself up by its bootstraps", ''i.e.'' it improves itself by its own efforts. Booting is a chain of events that starts with execution of hardware-based procedures and may then hand-off to [[firmware]] and software which is loaded into [[main memory]]. Booting often involves processes such as performing [[power-on self-test|self-tests]], loading [[computer configuration|configuration]] settings, loading a [[BIOS]], [[resident monitor]]s, a [[hypervisor]], an [[operating system]], or [[utility software]].

The computer term bootstrap began as a metaphor in the 1950s. In computers, pressing a bootstrap button caused a [[hardwired control|hardwired program]] to read a bootstrap program from an input unit. The computer would then execute the bootstrap program, which caused it to read more program instructions. It became a self-sustaining process that proceeded without external help from manually entered instructions. As a computing term, bootstrap has been used since at least 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 1953 | title = The System Design of the IBM Type 701 Computer | author = Buchholz, Werner | journal = Proceedings of the I.R.E. | volume = 41 | issue = 10 | page = 1273 | doi=10.1109/jrproc.1953.274300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Software development====
Bootstrapping can also refer to the development of successively more complex, faster programming environments. The simplest environment will be, perhaps, a very basic text editor (''e.g.'', [[ed (UNIX)|ed]]) and an [[Assembly language#Assembler|assembler]] program. Using these tools, one can write a more complex text editor, and a simple compiler for a higher-level language and so on, until one can have a [[graphical user interface|graphical]] [[integrated development environment|IDE]] and an extremely [[high-level programming language]].

Historically, bootstrapping also refers to an early technique for computer program development on new hardware. The technique described in this paragraph has been replaced by the use of a [[cross compiler]] executed by a pre-existing computer.  Bootstrapping in program development began during the 1950s when each program was constructed on paper in decimal code or in binary code, bit by bit (1s and 0s), because there was no high-level computer language, no [[compiler]], no assembler, and no [[Linker (computing)|linker]]. A tiny assembler program was hand-coded for a new computer (for example the [[IBM 650]]) which converted a few instructions into binary or decimal code: A1. This simple assembler program was then rewritten in its just-defined [[assembly language]] but with extensions that would enable the use of some additional mnemonics for more complex operation codes. The enhanced assembler's source program was then assembled by its predecessor's executable (A1) into binary or decimal code to give A2, and the cycle repeated (now with those enhancements available), until the entire instruction set was coded, branch addresses were automatically calculated, and other conveniences (such as conditional assembly, macros, optimisations, etc.) established.  This was how the early assembly program SOAP ([[Symbolic Optimal Assembly Program]]) was developed.  Compilers, linkers, loaders, and utilities were then coded in assembly language, further continuing the bootstrapping process of developing complex software systems by using simpler software.

The term was also championed by [[Doug Engelbart]] to refer to his belief that organizations could better evolve by improving the process they use for improvement (thus obtaining a compounding effect over time). His [[SRI International|SRI]] team that developed the [[NLS (computer system)|NLS]] hypertext system applied this strategy by using the tool they had developed to improve the tool.

====Compilers====
{{main article | Bootstrapping (compilers)}}
The development of compilers for new programming languages first developed in an existing language but then rewritten in the new language and compiled by itself, is another example of the bootstrapping notion. Using an existing language to bootstrap a new language is one way to solve the "[[chicken or the egg]]" causality dilemma.

====Installers====
{{main article | Installation (computer programs)}}
During the installation of computer programs it is sometimes necessary to update the installer or package manager itself. The common pattern for this is to use a small executable bootstrapper file (''e.g.'' [[setup.exe]]) which updates the installer and starts the real installation after the update. Sometimes the bootstrapper also installs other prerequisites for the software during the bootstrapping process.

====Overlay networks====
{{main article|Bootstrapping node}}

A bootstrapping node, also known as a rendezvous host,&lt;ref name="Francis01"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Yoid: Extending the Internet Multicast Architecture |publisher=www.aciri.org |author=Francis, Paul |date=2000-04-02 |url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/francis/yoidArch.pdf |accessdate=2008-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Node (networking)|node]] in an [[overlay network]] that provides initial configuration information to newly joining nodes so that they may successfully join the overlay network.&lt;ref name="sun01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?id=6cF3AAAAEBAJ |title=US Patent 7,065,579 |accessdate=2008-12-23 |author=Traversat |date=2006-06-20 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Saxena01"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Admission Control in Peer-to-Peer: Design and Performance Evaluation |publisher=In ACM Workshop on Security of Ad Hoc and Sensor Networks (SASN) 2003 |author=Saxena |year=2003 |url=http://www.ics.uci.edu/~gts/paps/sty03.pdf |accessdate=2008-12-24 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Discrete event simulation====
{{main article | Discrete event simulation}}
A type of [[computer simulation]] called [[discrete event simulation]] represents the operation of a system as a chronological sequence of events. A technique called ''bootstrapping the simulation model'' is used, which bootstraps initial data points using a [[pseudorandom number generator]] to schedule an initial set of pending events, which schedule additional events, and with time, the distribution of event times approaches its [[steady state]]—the bootstrapping behavior is overwhelmed by steady-state behavior.

====Artificial intelligence and machine learning====
{{main article | Bootstrap aggregating | Intelligence explosion}}
Bootstrapping is a technique used to iteratively improve a [[classifier (machine learning)|classifier]]'s performance. Seed AI is a hypothesized type of [[artificial intelligence]] capable of [[Intelligence explosion|recursive self-improvement]]. Having improved itself, it would become better at improving itself, potentially leading to an exponential increase in intelligence. No such AI is known to exist, but it remains an active field of research.

Seed AI is a significant part of some theories about the [[technological singularity]]: proponents believe that the development of seed AI will rapidly yield ever-smarter intelligence (via bootstrapping) and thus a new era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cortese|first=Francesco Albert Bosco|date=Spring 2014|title=The Maximally Distributed Intelligence Explosion|url=https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/SSS/SSS14/paper/viewFile/7763/7739|journal=AAAI Spring Symposium|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waser|first=Mark R.|date=2014|title=Bootstrapping a Structured Self-Improving &amp; Safe Autopoietic Self|url=https://ac.els-cdn.com/S1877050914015403/1-s2.0-S1877050914015403-main.pdf?_tid=eba4f73c-b275-435a-aa44-363f7e8c83bb&amp;acdnat=1530480295_5671d8d4b0fcd9317c8900ff77997992|journal=Procedia Computer Science|volume=Volume 41|pages=134-139|via=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bootstrapping (business)|Bootstrapping in business]] means starting a business without external help or capital. Such startups fund the development of their company through internal cash flow and are cautious with their expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2008/11/20/the-art-of-the-bootstrap/|title=The art of the bootstrap|date=21 November 2008|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally at the start of a venture, a small amount of money will be set aside for the bootstrap process.&lt;ref name="Bootstrap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bootstrapbusiness.org/|title=Bootstrap|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bootstrapping can also be a supplement for [[econometric]] models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/research/Bootstrapping%5b1%5d.pdf | title = Judgmental Bootstrapping: Inferring Experts= Rules for Forecasting | author = J.

Christiansen|Richard Christiansen]], the Harvard Business Review article ''The Art of Bootstrapping'' and the follow-up book ''The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses'' by [[Amar Bhide]].

===Biology===
[[Richard Dawkins]] in his book ''River Out of Eden''&lt;ref&gt;Richard Dawkins, ''River Out of Eden'', pages 23-25, 1995 (paper) {{ISBN|0-465-06990-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; used the computer bootstrapping concept to explain how biological cells differentiate: "Different cells receive different combinations of chemicals, which switch on different combinations of genes, and some genes work to switch other genes on or off. And so the bootstrapping continues, until we have the full repertoire of different kinds of cells."

====Phylogenetics====
Bootstrapping analysis gives a way to judge the strength of support for clades on [[phylogenetic tree]]s. A number is written by a node, which reflects the percentage of bootstrap trees which also resolve the [[clade]] at the endpoints of that branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Law===
{{main article | Bootstrapping (law)}}
Bootstrapping is a rule preventing the admission of [[hearsay]] evidence in conspiracy cases.

===Linguistics===
{{main article | Bootstrapping (linguistics)}}
Bootstrapping is a theory of [[language acquisition]].

===Physics===

====Quantum theory====
{{main article | Bootstrap model | Conformal bootstrap}}
Bootstrapping is using very general consistency criteria to determine the form of a quantum theory from some assumptions on the spectrum of particles or operators.

==== Magnetically confined fusion plasmas ====
In [[tokamak]] fusion devices, bootstrapping refers to the process in which a [[bootstrap current]] is self-generated by the plasma, which reduces or eliminates the need for an external current driver. Maximising the bootstrap current is a major goal of advanced tokamak designs.

==== Inertially confined fusion plasmas ====
Bootstrapping in [[inertial confinement fusion]] refers to the alpha particles produced in the fusion reaction providing further heating to the plasma. This heating leads to ignition and an overall energy gain.

===Electronics===
{{main article | Bootstrapping (electronics)}}
Bootstrapping is a form of positive feedback in analog circuit design.

=== Electric power grid ===
{{Main article|Black start}}

An electric power grid is almost never brought down intentionally. Generators and power stations are started and shut down as necessary. A typical power station requires power for start up prior to being able to generate power. This power is obtained from the grid, so if the entire grid is down these stations cannot be started.

Therefore, to get a grid started, there must be at least a small number of power stations that can start entirely on their own. A [[black start]] is the process of restoring a power station to operation without relying on external power. In the absence of grid power, one or more black starts are used to bootstrap the grid.

===Cellular networks===
{{main article | Bootstrapping Server Function | Generic Bootstrapping Architecture }}
A Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) is an intermediary element in [[cellular network]]s which provides application independent functions for mutual [[authentication]] of user equipment and servers unknown to each other and for 'bootstrapping' the exchange of secret session keys afterwards. The term 'bootstrapping' is related to building a security relation with a previously unknown device first and to allow installing security elements (keys) in the device and the BSF afterwards.

===Media===
{{Unreferenced section|date = December 2015|small = yes}}

A media bootstrap is the process whereby a story or meme is deliberately (but artificially) produced by self and peer-referential journalism, originally within a tight circle of media content originators, often commencing with stories written within the same media organization. This story is then expanded into a general media "accepted wisdom" with the aim of having it accepted as self-evident "common knowledge" by the reading, listening and viewing publics. The key feature of a media bootstrap is that as little hard, verifiable, external evidence as possible is used to support the story, preference being given to the citation (often unattributed) of other media stories, ''i.e.'' "journalists interviewing journalists".

Because the campaign is usually originated and at least initially concocted internally by a media organization with a particular agenda in mind, within a closed loop of reportage and opinionation, the campaign is said to have "pulled itself up by its own bootstraps".

A bootstrap campaign should be distinguished from a genuine news story of genuine interest, such as a natural disaster that kills thousands, or the death of a respected public figure. It is legitimate for these stories to be given coverage across all media platforms. What distinguishes a bootstrap from a real story is the contrived and organized manner in which the bootstrap appears to come out of nowhere. A bootstrap commonly claims to be tapping a hitherto unrecognized phenomenon within society.

As self-[[levitating]] by pulling on one's bootstraps is physically impossible, this is often used by the bootstrappers themselves to deny the possibility that the bootstrap campaign is indeed concocted and artificial. They assert that it has arisen via a groundswell of public opinion. Media campaigns that are openly admitted as concocted (''e.g.'' a public service campaign titled "Let's Clean Up Our City") are usually ignored by other media organizations for reasons related to competition. On the other hand, the true bootstrap welcomes the participation of other media organizations, indeed encourages it, as this participation gains the bootstrap notoriety and, most importantly, legitimacy.

[[File:3Variable BubbleChart.svg|thumb|240px|This bubble chart show the relationship between three variables.]] 
[[File:Vs figuratief.PNG|thumb|240px|A series of bubbles on a [[map]] is called a [[cartogram]] or sometimes "[[bubble map]]".]] 

A '''bubble chart''' is a type of [[chart]] that displays three dimensions of data. Each entity with its triplet (''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) of associated data is plotted as a disk that expresses two of the ''v&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' values through the disk's ''xy'' location and the third through its size. Bubble charts can facilitate the understanding of social, economical, medical, and other scientific relationships.

Bubble charts can be considered a variation of the [[scatter plot]], in which the data points are replaced with bubbles. As the documentation for [[Microsoft Office]] explains, "You can use a bubble chart instead of a scatter chart if your data has three data series that each contain a set of values. The sizes of the bubbles are determined by the values in the third data series.".&lt;ref&gt;[https://support.office.com/en-US/article/Present-your-data-in-a-bubble-chart-424D7BDA-93E8-4983-9B51-C766F3E330D9 Present your data in a bubble chart] Microsoft Office Online. Accessed 16 August, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Choosing bubble sizes correctly==
The [[human visual system]] naturally experiences a disk's size in terms of its [[area]]. And the area of a disk—unlike its [[diameter]] or [[circumference]]—is not proportional to its [[radius]], but to the square of the radius. So if one chooses to scale the disks' radii to the third data values directly, then the apparent size differences among the disks will be non-linear (quadratic) and misleading. To get a properly weighted scale, one must scale each disk's radius to the  [[square root]] of the corresponding data value ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
This scaling issue can lead to extreme misinterpretations, especially where the range of the data has a large spread. And because many people are unfamiliar with—or do not stop to consider—the issue and its impact on perception, those who are aware of it often have to hesitate in interpreting a bubble chart because they cannot assume that the scaling correction was indeed made. So it is important that bubble charts not only be scaled in this way, but also be clearly labeled to document that it is area, rather than radius or diameter, that conveys the data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Tufte]], ''The Visual Display of Quantitative Information''. Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press. (2001, 2nd edition, {{ISBN|0-9613921-4-2}})&lt;/ref&gt;

==Displaying zero or negative data values in bubble charts==
The [[metaphoric]] representation of data values as disk areas cannot be extended for displaying values that are negative or zero.
As a fallback, some users of bubble charts resort to graphic symbology to express nonpositive data values. As an example, a negative value &lt;math&gt;v &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; can be represented by a disk of area &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in which is centered some chosen symbol like "×" to indicate that the size of the bubble represents the [[absolute value]] of a negative data value. And this approach can be reasonably effective in situations where data values' magnitudes (absolute values) are themselves somewhat important—in other words, where values of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-v&lt;/math&gt; are similar in some context-specific way—so that their being represented by [[congruence (geometry)|congruent]] disks makes sense.

To represent zero-valued data, some users dispense with disks altogether, using, say, a square centered at the appropriate location. Others use full circles for positive, and empty circles for negative values.

== Incorporating further dimensions of data ==

[[File: Net_Present_Value_vs_Payback_time_Portfolio_Management_Simulation.jpg|thumb| The value can be proportional to the diameter or the area of the bubble. The example of the Portfolio Management Simulation [[SimulTrain]] uses different areas and colors of the bubbles.]]

Additional information about the entities beyond their three primary values can often be incorporated by rendering their disks in colors and patterns that are chosen in a systematic way. And, of course, supplemental information can be added by annotating disks with textual information, sometimes as simple as unique identifying labels for cross-referencing to explanatory keys and the like.

A '''comparison microscope''' is a device used to analyze side-by-side specimens. It consists of two [[microscope]]s connected by an optical bridge, which results in a split view window enabling two separate objects to be viewed simultaneously. This avoids the observer having to rely on memory when comparing two objects under a conventional microscope.

==History==
In the 1920s forensic ballistics was waiting at its inception. In 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the purpose by Calvin Goddard and his partner Phillip Gravelle used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the St. Valentine's Day Massacre.

===Col. Calvin H. Goddard===
{{Main|Calvin Hooker Goddard}}
[[Image:goddardcomparison-wiki.jpg|thumb|100px|right|Goddard with comparison microscope]] Philip O. Gravelle, a [[chemist]], developed a comparison microscope for use in the identification of fired [[bullets]] and [[Casing (ammunition)|cartridge cases]] with the support and guidance of forensic ballistics pioneer Calvin Goddard. It was a significant advance in the science of [[firearms]] identification in [[forensic science]]. The firearm from which a bullet or cartridge case has been fired is identified by the comparison of the unique striae left on the bullet or cartridge case from the worn, machined metal of the [[Gun barrel|barrel]], breach block, [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]], or [[firing pin]] in the [[gun]]. It was Gravelle who mistrusted his memory. "As long as he could inspect only one bullet at a time with his microscope, and had to keep the picture of it in his memory until he placed the comparison bullet under the microscope, scientific precision could not be attained. He therefore developed the comparison microscope and Goddard made it work." Calvin Goddard perfected the comparison microscope and subsequently popularized its use.&lt;ref&gt;Jurgen Thorwald, '''The Century of the Detective''', New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1964&lt;/ref&gt;[[Sydney Smith (forensic expert)|Sir Sydney Smith]] also appreciated the idea, emphasizing its importance in forensic science and firearms identification. He took the comparison microscope to [[Scotland]] and introduced it to the European scientists for firearms identification and other forensic science needs.

==Modern comparison microscope==
The modern instrument has many [[optical]], [[Machine|mechanical]] and [[Electronics|electronic]] refinements, including [[fiber optic]] illumination, [[video]] capabilities, digital imaging, automatic exposure for conventional photography, etc. Despite this evolution, however, the basic tools and techniques have remained unchanged which are to determine whether or not ammunition components were fired by a single [[firearm]] based on unique and reproducible microscopic and class characteristics, or to reach a "no conclusion" result if insufficient marks are present.&lt;ref name=dillon&gt;John H. Dillon, Jr , Comparison Microscopy: The Origins of Firearms identification, A Practical Application of Forensic Science, Technology and Engineering to Case Linkage in Shooting Incidents Not Previously Related by Investigative personnel, BulletTRAX-3D, MatchPoint Plus and the Firearms Examiner, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since, ballistic identification has benefited from a long series of structural, scientific and technological advances, law enforcement agencies have established forensic laboratories and researchers have learned much more about how to match [[bullet]]s and [[Casing (ammunition)|cartridge cases]] to the guns used to fire them, and comparison microscopes have become more sophisticated. By the end of the 1980s, ballistic identification was an established sub-specialty of [[forensic science]].

Visualization tools have also been developed to allows the firearms examiner to verify the degree of similarity between any two tool-marks in question. These are designed to simulate the operation of the comparison microscope but is capable of rendering a 2D view of the 3D surfaces in a manner similar to that of the conventional comparison microscope.

==Forensic ballistics==
{{Main|Ballistics}}

The prevalence of hand-gun related crime in the [[United States]] compared to most other developed countries provided the impetus for the development of the comparison microscope.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} As with most firearms, the fired [[ammunition]] components may acquire sufficient unique and reproducible microscopic marks to be identifiable as having been fired by a single firearm. Making these comparisons is correctly referred to as firearms identification, or sometimes called as "ballistics".

Historically, and currently, this [[forensic ballistics|forensic discipline]] ultimately requires a microscopic side-by-side comparison of fired [[bullet]]s or [[Casing (ammunition)|cartridge cases]], one pair at a time, by a forensic examiner to confirm or eliminate the two items as having been fired by a single firearm. For this purpose, the traditional tool of the firearms examiner has been what is often called the ballistics comparison microscope.

The interior of a gun's barrel is machined to have grooves (called [[Rifling#Manufacture|rifling]]) that force the bullet to rotate as it travels along it. These grooves and their counterpart, called "lands" imprint groove and land impressions on the surface of the bullet. Together with these land and groove impressions, imperfections on the [[Gun barrel|barrel]] surface are incidentally transferred to the bullet's surface. Because these imperfections are randomly generated, during manufacture or due to use, they are unique to each barrel. These patterns or imperfections, therefore, amount to a "signature" that each barrel imprints on each of the bullets fired through it. It is this "signature" on the bullets imparted due to the unique imperfections on the barrel that enable the validation and identification of bullets as having originated from a particular gun. Comparison microscope is used to analyze the matching of the microscopic impressions found on the surface of bullets and casings.

When a firearm or a bullet or cartridge case are recovered from a [[crime scene]], forensic examiners compare the [[Ballistic fingerprinting|ballistic fingerprint]] of the recovered bullet or cartridge case with the ballistic fingerprint of a second bullet or cartridge case test-fired from the recovered firearm. If the ballistic fingerprint on the test-fired bullet or cartridge case matches the ballistic fingerprint on the recovered bullet or cartridge case, investigators know that the recovered bullet or cartridge case was also fired from the recovered gun. A confirmed link between a specific firearm and a bullet or cartridge case recovered from a crime scene constitutes a valuable lead, because investigators may be able to connect the firearm to a person, who may then become either a suspect or a source of information helpful to the investigation.

==Notable cases==
===Sacco and Vanzetti case===
{{Main|Sacco and Vanzetti}}
Forensic innovator [[Calvin Hooker Goddard|Calvin Goddard]] offered ballistic identification evidence in 1921 to help secure [[conviction]]s of accused murderers and anarchists [[Nicola Sacco]] and [[Bartolomeo Vanzetti]]. On April 8, 1927, Sacco and Vanzetti were finally sentenced to death in the [[electric chair]]. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T. Fuller finally agreed to postpone the [[Capital punishment|executions]] and set up a committee to reconsider the case. By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that a [[semi-automatic pistol]] could be traced by several different methods if both [[bullet]] and [[Casing (ammunition)|casing]] were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by [[firing pin]] indentations on the fired primer, or by unique ejector and [[Extractor (firearms)|extractor]] marks on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of [[Calvin Hooker Goddard|Calvin Goddard]] in 1927.
Goddard used Philip Gravelle's newly invented comparison microscope and helixometer, a hollow, lighted magnifier probe used to inspect [[gun barrel]]s, to make an examination of Sacco's .32 Colt, the bullet that killed Berardelli, and the spent casings recovered from the scene of the crime. In the presence of one of the defense experts, he fired a bullet from Sacco's gun into a wad of cotton and then put the ejected casing on the comparison microscope next to casings found at the scene. Then he looked at them carefully. The first two casings from the robbery did not match Sacco's gun, but the third one did. Even the defense expert agreed that the two cartridges had been fired from the same gun. The second original defense expert also concurred. The committee upheld the convictions.
In October 1961, ballistics tests were run with improved technology using Sacco's Colt automatic. The results confirmed that the bullet that killed the victim, Berardelli in 1920 came from the same .32 Colt Auto taken from the pistol in Sacco's possession. Subsequent investigations in 1983 also supported Goddard's findings.

===St. Valentine's Day massacre===
{{Main|St. Valentine's Day Massacre}}
Colonel Goddard was the key forensic expert in solving the 1929 [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]] in which seven gangsters were killed by rival [[Al Capone]] [[mobster]]s dressed as [[Chicago Police Department|Chicago police]] officers. It also led to the establishment of the United States' first independent criminological laboratory, which was located at [[Northwestern University]] and headed by Goddard. At this new lab, [[ballistics]], [[fingerprinting]], blood analysis and [[trace evidence]] were all brought under one roof.
In 1929, using a comparison microscope adapted for the ballistics comparison by his partner, Phillip Gravelle, Goddard used similar techniques to absolve the Chicago Police Department of participation in the [[St. Valentine's Day Massacre]]. The case of Sacco and Vanzetti, which took place in Bridgewater, Massachusetts, is responsible for popularizing the use of the comparison microscope for bullet comparison. Forensic expert Calvin Goddard's conclusions were upheld when the evidence was re-examined in 1961.

[[Professional wrestling]] and [[mixed martial arts]] (Also known as MMA) both combine [[grappling]] and [[strike (attack)|strikes]]. In MMA fights are competed over, in contrast to professional wrestling where the outcomes and moves performed are often [[scripted]] or predetermined. Despite the differences in competition, there have been people that have competed in both professional wrestling and MMA.

==Comparison==
Professional wrestling could be considered a [[performance art]] which combines [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletics]] with [[Performing arts|theatrical performance]].&lt;ref name="Barthes"&gt;{{cite web|last=Barthes|first=Roland|title=The World Of Wrestling |work=Mythologies |year=1957 |url=http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ikalmar/illustex/Barthes-wrestling.htm |accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matches are contested on a pre-determined basis, where the fight on display is merely for entertainment purposes. Viewers are integral to a professional wrestling match, as the audience is who the action is for. Professional wrestling mixes many styles of [[amateur wrestling]], striking and showmanship to display a fight, whilst the two performers work together to achieve a "worked" fight. Professional wrestling was first popularized in the 19th century [[Europe]] as a carnival attraction.

Mixed Martial Arts, is a hybrid of many types of physical full-contact sports; including [[wrestling]], [[boxing]] and [[Martial Arts]], such as [[Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu]]. The early 1990s saw the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] popularize the term "Mixed Martial Arts", for such a bout. Competitors in MMA are generally skilled in many different styles, however, it is possible to be only proficient in one type of combat. As some professional wrestling moves are simply worked versions of legitimate holds, there can be a crossover between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://uproxx.com/prowrestling/mma-dragon-sleeper-finish-video/ | title=An MMA Fighter Won A Fight With A Shoot Dragon Sleeper | work=Uproxx.com | date=November 12, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Hanstock, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly the most successful pro wrestler and MMA star is [[Brock Lesnar]], who has won the world championships in both the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael McAvennie|title=WWE The Yearbook: 2003 Edition|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2003|page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ultimate Fighting Championship|UFC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nodq.com/ufc/222389802.shtml|title=Brock Lesnar vs. Randy Couture|date=September 2, 2008|last=Spade|first=Bobby|accessdate=September 2, 2008|publisher=NoDQ.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906152912/http://nodq.com/ufc/222389802.shtml|archivedate=September 6, 2008|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/19/16793746/ufc-brock-lesnar-return-wwe-jim-ross-pro-wrestling-mma-news | title=Jim Ross: Fans are ‘jonesing’ for Lesnar’s UFC return because MMA is lacking superstars right now | publisher=Bloody Elbow Magazine | date=December 19, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Ordoñez, Milan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other wrestlers to have won a championship in both MMA and Pro Wrestling include [[Bobby Lashley]] ([[Shark Fights#Current champions|Shark Fights Heavyweight Championship]]&lt;ref name="Shark-Win"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gerweck.net/2011/11/12/bobby-lashley-wins-mma-title-in-lubbock/|title=Bobby Lashley wins MMA title in Lubbock|publisher=Gerweck.net|first=Steve|last=Gerweck|accessdate=November 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Impact Global Championship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlinginc.com/wi/news/2016/0811/615430/tna-impact-wrestling-results/|title=TNA Impact Wrestling Results (8/11): Damien Sandow TNA Debut, Titles Vs. Title, Lashley Vs. Storm}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and [[Dan Severn]] who won the UFC Superfight Championship, and the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]].

===Rivalry===
Since MMA's rise to prominence in the 1990s, some pro wrestlers or MMA fighters have been cynical against the other's profession. This can be an attack on the sport as a whole, or acting as a fan dismissing certain actions within that sport.&lt;ref name="BloodyElbow"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/18/16793536/ufc-daniel-cormier-disses-pro-wrestling-spots-gets-into-twitter-beef-with-cody-rhodes-mma-news | title=Daniel Cormier disses pro wrestling spots, gets into Twitter beef with Cody Rhodes | publisher=Bloody Elbow Magazine | date=Dec 18, 2017 | accessdate=January 3, 2018 | author=Burke, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4134">'''Cue recruitment''' is a form of [[associative learning]] in [[human]] [[perception]].  A ''cue'' in perception is a [[Wiktionary:signal|signal]] that can be measured by an observer's perceptual system, that is informative about the state of some property of the world.  A ''trusted cue'' is one that the system utilizes to construct [[Visual appearance|appearance]], i.e. to build a [[percept]] (what one "sees") that depends on the world state.  In a ''cue recruitment experiment'', an arbitrarily chosen signal is put into [[correlation]] with trusted cues, which makes the signal into an artificial cue.  If the artificial cue acquires the ability to affect appearance in a manner similar to the trusted cues, it is said to have been ''recruited''.

The cue recruitment experiment is a form of [[classical conditioning]] experiment, the simplest test for [[associative learning]] in which one (or at most a few) new signal(s) are put into correlation with one or a few trusted cues.  Cue recruitment (a change in perceptual appearance) does not always occur during a cue recruitment experiment.

Perceptually bistable stimuli are often used to test for cue recruitment because they allow the experimenter to measure very small cue-contingent biases in appearance.  Bistable stimuli are useful for a second reason as well: trainees can easily report appearance for these stimuli.  As a result, if learning occurs during the experiment, the experimenter can be sure that the learning caused a change in how the stimulus looked, rather than a change in the explicit strategy used by the trainee during responding.

Cue recruitment is one of many types of ''cue learning'', a more general framework due to [[Egon Brunswik]] that also encompasses other [[adaptation|adaptive]] changes in the system's use of cues.  Examples of cue learning that are not cue recruitment include:
*''Cue weighting''.  When two or more trusted cues are available to estimate the same property of the world, human perceptual systems usually exhibit [[data fusion]], and it is possible to change the relative weights given to different cues through training (Ernst et al., 2000).  
*''Pattern learning''.  A complex pattern of signals can be learned to act as a cue that affects appearance (Sinha &amp; Poggio, 1996).
*''Recalibration''.  The way that a particular cue is utilized can be modified by experience (Adams et al., 2001).

== Example ==

Cue recruitment was demonstrated by Haijiang et al. (2006) using a computer-generated rotating [[Necker cube]] stimulus.  This stimulus is perceptually bistable and may appear to rotate either left or right.  To test for cue recruitment, binocular disparity cues (3D cues) were added to the Necker cube, to specify which part of the cube was in front and which was in back.  The apparent direction of rotation was thereby brought under experimenter control.  The new cue was that the cube moved upward or downward on every trial (contingent on its direction of rotation).  Test trials contained the new cue but not the trusted cue.  On these trials, trainees tended to see the cube rotating in the same direction it had during training (depending on whether its motion was upward or downward).

The '''''dharmakāya''''' ([[Sanskrit]], "truth body" or "reality body", {{bo|w=chos sku, rdzogs sku}}) is one of the three bodies (''[[trikaya]]'') of a [[buddhahood|buddha]] in [[Mahayana]] Buddhism. The ''dharmakāya'' constitutes the unmanifested, "inconceivable" (''acintya'') aspect of a buddha out of which buddhas arise and to which they return after their dissolution. Buddhas are manifestations of the ''dharmakāya'' called the ''[[nirmāṇakāya]]'', "transformation body". Reginald Ray writes of it as "the body of reality itself, without specific, delimited form, wherein the Buddha is identified with the spiritually charged nature of everything that is."&lt;ref name="Reginald Ray 2001, p. 13"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ray|first=Reginald|authorlink=Reginald Ray|title=Secret of the Vajra World: The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kQMLAAAAYAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-57062-772-9|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Dhammakaya Movement|Dhammakaya tradition]] of Thailand and the ''[[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras]]'' of the ancient Indian tradition view the ''dharmakāya'' as the ''[[ātman (Buddhism)|ātman]]'' (true self) of the Buddha present within all beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Thrangu Rinpoche|authorlink=Thrangu Rinpoche|title=Pointing Out the Dharmakaya: Teachings on the Ninth Karmapa's Text|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fi5w-wNj0D8C|year=2003|publisher=Shambhala|isbn=978-1-55939-857-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tibetan etymology ==
In Tibetan, the term ''chos sku''&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/chos_sku] (accessed: January 15, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; glosses ''dharmakāya''; it is composed of ''chos'' "religion, [[dharma]]" and ''sku'' "body, form, image, bodily form, figure".&lt;ref&gt;Source: [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/sku] (accessed: January 15, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Thondup &amp; Talbott render it as the "ultimate body".&lt;ref name="Thondup, Tulku 1996, p.48"&gt;Thondup, Tulku &amp; Harold Talbott (Editor)(1996, 2002).

The Yungdrung [[Bon]] term for ''dharmakāya'' is ''rdzogs sku'', where ''rdzogs'' means "perfection".

== Origins and development ==

=== Pali Canon ===
{{religious text primary|section|date=November 2017}}
In the [[Pāli Canon]], [[Gautama Buddha]] tells Vasettha that the [[Tathāgata]] (the Buddha) is ''Dhammakaya'', the "Truth-body" or the "Embodiment of Truth", as well as ''Dharmabhuta'', "Truth-become", that is, "One who has become Truth."
{{quote|He whose faith in the Tathagata is settled, rooted, established, solid, unshakeable by any ascetic or Brahmin, any deva or mara or Brahma or anyone in the world, can truly say: 'I am a true son of Blessed Lord (Bhagavan), born of his mouth, born of Dhamma, created by Dhamma, an heir of Dhamma.' Why is that? Because, Vasettha, this designates the Tathagata: 'The Body of Dhamma,' that is, 'The Body of Brahma,' or 'Become Dhamma,' that is, 'Become Brahma.'" &lt;ref name="Maurce Walshe 1995 p.409"&gt;Digha Nikaya III.84, Maurice Walshe, The Long Discourses of the Buddha, (Boston, MA: Wisdom Publications, 1995) 409&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the Buddha's life great veneration was shown to him. A mythology developed concerning the physical characteristics of Universal Buddhas.

After the Buddha's ''[[Parinirvana]]'' a distinction was made between the Buddha’s physical body or ''rūpakaya'' and his ''dharmakaya'' aspect. As the Buddha told Vakkali, he was a living example of the "Truth" of the ''Dharma''. Without that form to relate to, the Buddha's followers could only relate to the ''dharmakaya'' aspect of him.

In SN 6.2 – Garava sutta. Buddha paid homage to the ''Dhamma'' and tell, that he will respect it.

=== Trikaya doctrine ===
{{Main|Trikaya}}
The ''Trikaya doctrine'' (Sanskrit, literally "three bodies" or "three personalities") is a Buddhist teaching both on the nature of reality, and the appearances of a Buddha.

The ''dharmakaya''-doctrine was possibly first expounded in the ''[[Prajnaparamita#Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā]]'', composed in the 1st century BCE.

Around 300 CE, the [[Yogacara]] school systematized the prevalent ideas on the nature of the Buddha in the ''Trikaya'' "three-body" doctrine. According to this doctrine, [[Buddhahood]] has three aspects:{{sfn|Snelling|1987|p=126}}
# The ''Nirmāṇakāya'', "Transformation body"
# The ''[[Sambhogakāya]]'', "Enjoyment-body"
# The ''Dharmakāya'', "Dharma-body"

=== Qualities ===
Tulku Thondup states that ''dharmakaya'' must possess three great qualities:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thondup|first1=Tulku|title=Masters of meditation and miracles : the Longchen Nyingthig lineage of Tibetan Buddhism|date=1996|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=978-1-57062-113-0|page=50|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretation in Buddhist traditions ==
{{See also|Anatta}}

=== Mahāsāṃghika ===
According to Guang Xing, two main aspects of the Buddha can be seen in [[Mahāsāṃghika]] teachings: the true Buddha who is omniscient and omnipotent, and the manifested forms through which he liberates sentient beings through skillful means.&lt;ref&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 53&lt;/ref&gt; For the Mahāsaṃghikas, the historical Gautama Buddha was one of these transformation bodies (Skt. ''nirmāṇakāya''), while the essential real Buddha is equated with the ''dharmakāya''.&lt;ref&gt;Sree Padma. Barber, Anthony W. ''Buddhism in the Krishna River Valley of Andhra.'' 2008. pp. 59-60&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sarvāstivāda ===
[[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivādins]] viewed the Buddha's physical body (Skt. ''rūpakāya'') as being impure and improper for taking refuge in, and they instead regarded taking refuge in the Buddha as taking refuge in the dharmakāya of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 49"&gt;Guang Xing. ''The Concept of the Buddha: Its Evolution from Early Buddhism to the Trikaya Theory.'' 2004. p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; As stated in the ''[[Mahavibhasa|Mahāvibhāṣā]]'':&lt;ref name="Guang Xing 2004. p. 49" /&gt;
{{quote|Some people say that to take refuge in the Buddha is to take refuge in the body of the Tathāgata, which comprises head, neck, stomach, back, hands and feet. It is explained that the body, born of father and mother, is composed of defiled ''dharmas'', and therefore is not a source of refuge. The refuge is the Buddha's fully accomplished qualities (''aśaikṣadharmāḥ'') which comprise ''bodhi'' and the ''dharmakāya.''}}

=== Theravada ===
In the [[Pali Canon]] of [[Theravada]] Buddhism, the ''Dhammakāya'' (''dharmakāya'') is explained as a figurative term, meaning the "body" or the sum of the Buddha's teachings.&lt;ref name="Endo1"&gt;{{cite book | title=Buddha in Theravada Buddhism: A Study of the Concept of Buddha In the Pali Commentaries | url=http://www.khamkoo.com/uploads/9/0/0/4/9004485/toshiichi_endo_buddha_in_theravada_buddhism_a_study_of_the_concept_of_buddha_in_the_pali_commentaries__2002.pdf|publisher=[[Buddhist Cultural Centre]] | author=Toschiichi, Endo | year=2002 | location=Nedimala | pages=108–10 | isbn=978-955-96292-0-7 | edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=376–7}}{{sfn|Dutt|1929|p=523}} The Canon does not invest the term ''dhammakāya'' with a metaphysical or unrealistic connotation.&lt;ref name="Endo1" /&gt;{{sfn|Dutt|1929|p=521-523}} Jantrasrisalai disagrees though, arguing that the term originally was more connected with the process of enlightenment than the way it later came to be interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis|url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/4130/1/01ch-jantrasrisalai-2008-thesis.pdf|title=Early Buddhist Dhammakaya: Its Philosophical and Soteriological Significance| type=PhD thesis|last=Jantrasrisalai|first=Chanida|publisher=Department of Studies in Religion, [[University of Sydney]]|year=2008|isbn=|location=Sydney|pages=288|quote=In all references to dhammakāya in early Buddhist usage, it is apparent that dhammakāya is linked always with the process of enlightenment in one way or another. Its relation with the Buddhist noble ones of all types is evident in the early Buddhist texts. That is to say, dhammakāya is not exclusive to the Buddha. It appears also that the term’s usage in the sense of teaching is a later schema rather than being the early Buddhist common notions as generally understood.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[atthakatha|atthakathā]]''s (commentaries on the [[Buddhist texts]]), the interpretation of the word depends on the author. Though both [[Buddhaghoṣa]] and [[Dhammapala|Dhammapāla]] describe ''dhammakāya'' as the nine supramundane states (''navalokuttaradhamma''), their interpretations differ in other aspects. Buddhaghoṣa always follows the canonical interpretation, referring to the ''teaching'' of the ''lokuttaradhamma''s, but Dhammapāla interprets ''dhammakāya'' as the ''spiritual attainments'' of the Buddha.{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=376–80}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Steven|title=Reflections on the Dichotomy Rūpakāya/Dhammakāya|journal=Contemporary Buddhism|date=15 July 2014|volume=15|issue=2|pages=261–2|doi=10.1080/14639947.2014.932481}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dhammapāla's interpretation is still essentially Theravāda though, since the Buddha is still considered a human being, albeit an enlightened one.&lt;ref name="Endo1" /&gt; The Buddha's body is still subject to ''[[Karma in Buddhism|kamma]]'' and limited in the same way as other people's bodies are.{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=376–80}}

In a post-canonical text Sri Lankan text called Saddharmaratnākaraya, a distinction is drawn between four different ''kāya''s: the ''rūpakāya'', ''dharmakāya'', ''nimittakāya'' and ''suñyakāya''. The ''rūpakāya'' refers to the four ''[[Dhyāna in Buddhism|jhāna]]''s here; the ''dharmakāya'' refers to the attainment of the first eight of the nine ''lokuttaradhamma''s; the ''nimittakāya'' refers to the final ''lokuttaradhamma'': ''Nibbāna'' with a physical remainder (''sopadisesanibbāna''); and the ''suñyakāya'' refers to ''Nibbāna'' without physical remainder (''anupādisesanibbāna''). However, even this teaching of four ''kāya''s does not really stray outside of orthodox Theravāda tradition.&lt;ref name="Endo1" /&gt;{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=380–2}}

In a more unorthodox approach, Maryla Falk has made the argument that in the earliest form of Buddhism, a [[yogic]] path existed which involved the acquisition of a ''manomayakāya'' or ''dhammakāya'' and an ''amatakāya'', in which the ''manomayakāya'' or ''dhammakāya'' refers to the attainment of the ''jhānas'', and the ''amatakāya'' to the attainment of insight and the culmination of the path. In this case, the ''kāyas'' refer to a general path and fruit, not only to the person of the Buddha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Falk|first1=Maryla|title=Nāma-rūpa and dharma-rūpa : origin and aspects of an ancient Indian conception|date=2006|publisher=Jain Publishing|location=Fremont, California|isbn=978-0-89581-978-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w9M-z-JVSa0C|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strong|first=J.|author-link=John S.

Furthermore, he points out that there are remarkable resemblances with interpretations that can be found in ''Yogāvacara'' texts, often called [[Tantric Theravada]].{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=380–4}}

The usage of the word ''dhammakāya'' is common in Tantric Theravāda texts. It is also a common term in later texts concerning the consecration of Buddha images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=1062942 | title=Hypostasizing the Buddha: Buddha Image Consecration in Northern Thailand | author=Swearer, Donald K. | journal=History of Religions | year=1995 | volume=34 | issue=3 (Image and Ritual in Buddhism) | page=270 |url=http://works.swarthmore.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1116&amp;context=fac-religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Kinnard|first1=Jacob N.|editor1-last=Jones|editor1-first=Lindsay|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of religion|title=Iconography: Buddhist iconography|date=2005|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-02-865740-0|page=4331|edition=2nd|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302020621/https://www.politicalavenue.com/PDF/ENCYCLOPEDIAS/The%20Gale%20Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%202nd%20Ed%20Vol.%207.pdf|volume=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these later texts, which are often descriptions of ''[[kammaṭṭhāna]]'' (meditation methods), different parts of the body of the Buddha are associated with certain spiritual attainments, and the practitioner determines to pursue these attainments himself. The idea that certain characteristics or attainments of the Buddha can be pursued is usually considered a Mahāyāna idea, but unlike Mahāyāna, Yogāvacara texts do not describe the Buddha in [[ontological]] terms, and commonly use only Theravāda terminology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Crosby|first=Kate|year=2000|title=Tantric Theravada: A Bibliographic Essay on the Writings of Francois Bizot and others on the Yogavacara-Tradition|journal=Contemporary Buddhism|volume=1|issue=2|url=http://abhidharma.ru/A/Vedalla/Content/0003.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111226044721/http://abhidharma.ru/A/Vedalla/Content/0003.pdf|archivedate=2011-12-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Reynolds|1977|pp=384–7}}

{{See also|Dhammakaya Movement#Dhammakaya meditation and True Self}}
The [[Dhammakaya Movement]] of Thai Theravada Buddhism has doctrinal elements which distinguish it from conventional Theravāda Buddhism. Basing itself on the Pali suttas and meditative experience, the movement teaches that the ''Dhammakaya'' is the eternal Buddha within all beings. The ''dhammakaya'' is ''Nibbāna'', and ''Nibbāna'' is equated with the true Self (as opposed to the non-self).{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=126}} In some respects its teachings resemble the [[Buddha-nature]] doctrines of Mahayana Buddhism. Paul Williams has commented that this view of Buddhism is similar to ideas found in the [[Rangtong-Shentong|shentong]] teachings of the [[Jonang]] school of Tibet made famous by [[Dolpopa Sherab Gyaltsen]].{{sfn|Williams 2009|p=237}}

The Thai meditation masters who teach of a true self of which they claim to have gained meditative experience are not rejected by [[Buddhism in Thailand|Thai Buddhists]] in general, but tend, on the contrary, to be particularly revered and worshipped in Thailand as arahats or even ''[[bodhisattva]]s'', far more so than more orthodox Theravada monks and scholars.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=329}}

=== Mahāyāna ===

==== Prajnaparamita ====
According to Paul Williams, there are three ways of seeing the concept of the ''dharmakaya'' in the ''[[prajnaparamita]] '' sutras:
{{quote|First, the dharmakaya is the collection of teachings, particularly the Prajñaparamita itself. Second, it is the collection of pure [[Dharma#Dharmas in Buddhist phenomenology|dharmas]] possessed by the Buddha, specifically pure mental dharmas cognizing emptiness. And third, it comes to refer to [[Śūnyatā|emptiness]] itself, the true nature of things. The dharmakaya in all these senses is contrasted with the Buddha’s physical body, that which lived and died and is preserved in [[stupa]]s.{{sfn|Williams|2009|p=177}}}}

==== Tathāgatagarbha ====
In the tathagatagarbha sutric tradition, the ''dharmakaya'' is taught by the Buddha to constitute the transcendental, blissful, eternal, and pure Self of the Buddha. "These terms are found in sutras such as the ''Lankavatara'', ''Gandavyuha'', ''Angulimaliya'', ''Srimala'', and the ''Mahaparinirvana'', where they are used to describe the Buddha, the Truth Body (''dharmakaya'') and the Buddha-nature."&lt;ref name=Duckworthxiv&gt;''Mipam on Buddha-Nature: The Ground of the Nyingma Tradition'' by Douglas S. Duckworth, State University of New York Press, Albany, 2008, p. xiv&lt;/ref&gt; They are the "transcendent results [of spiritual attainment]".&lt;ref name=Duckworthxiv /&gt;

==== ''Lotus Sutra'' ====
In the ''[[Lotus Sutra]]'' (sixth fascicle) the Buddha explains that he has always and will always exist to lead beings to their salvation.

==== Tibetan Buddhism ====
[[Padmasambhava]], [[Karma Lingpa]], [[Gyurme Dorje]], [[Graham Coleman]] and [[Thupten Jinpa]] define "Buddha-body of Reality", which is a rendering of the Tibetan ''chos-sku'' and the Sanskrit ''dharmakāya'', as:
{{quote|[T]he ultimate nature or essence of the enlightened mind [''byang-chub sems''], which is uncreated (''skye-med''), free from the limits of conceptual elaboration (''spros-pa'i mtha'-bral''), empty of inherent existence (''rang-bzhin-gyis stong-pa''), naturally radiant, beyond duality and spacious like the sky. The intermediate state of the time of death (''chi-kha'i bar-do'') is considered to be an optimum time for the realisation of the Buddha-body of Reality.&lt;ref name="Padmasambhava 2006 p.452" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more discussion on this particular 'intermediate state of the time of death' refer "Chikkhai bardo" (Tibetan) in the [[Bardo]] article.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Reginald Ray]], writing of the Vajrayana view of the ''dharmakaya'', defines it as:
{{quote|The body of reality itself, without specific, delimited form, wherein the Buddha is identified with the spiritually charged nature of everything that is.'&lt;ref name="Reginald Ray 2001, p. 13" /&gt;}}

The Dalai Lama defines the dharmakaya as "the realm of the Dharmakaya-- the space of emptiness--where all phenomena, pure and impure, are dissolved. This is the explanation taught by the Sutras and Tantras.". However he also states that its distinct from the Hindu concept of [[Brahman]] because buddhism adheres to the doctrine of emptyness (sunyata).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://hhdl.dharmakara.net/hhdlquotes22.html | title=Dalai Lama Answers Questions on Various Topics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Rime movement =====
According to [[Jamgon Kongtrul]], the founder of the [[Rimé movement]], in his 19th century commentary to the [[Lojong]] slogan, "To see confusion as the four kayas, the [[Śūnyatā|sunyata]] protection is unsurpassable",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kongtrul|first1=Jamgon|title=The great path of awakening : the classic guide to lojong, a Tibetan Buddhist practice for cultivating the heart of compassion|date=2005|publisher=Shambhala|location=Boston, MA|isbn=978-1-59030-214-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; when one meditates on ultimate ''[[bodhicitta]]'' and rests in a state where appearances simply appear but there is no clinging to them, the ''dharmakaya'' aspect is that all appearances are empty in nature, the ''[[sambhogakāya]]'' is that they appear with clarity, the ''nirmanakaya'' is that this emptiness and clarity occur together, and the natural ''kāya'' aspect is that these are inseparable.

===== Gyaltrul Rinpoche's Dharmakaya Organization =====
Recently, ''Dharmakaya'' has also become the name for an organization founded by H. E. the 4th [[Trungram Gyaltrul Rinpoche]], and is affiliated with his global organization the United Trungram Buddhist Fellowship (UTBF).  {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Gyaltrul Rinpoche's Dharmakaya organization was founded for the specific purpose of bringing the teachings and meditation practices from the Trungram Tradition of the [[Karma Kagyu]] lineage to North America. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

== Iconography ==

=== Emptiness ===
In the early traditions of Buddhism, depictions of Gautama Buddha were neither iconic nor aniconic but depictions of empty space and absence: [[petrosomatoglyph]]s (Images of a part of the body carved in rock), for example.&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, Susan (1990). "Early Buddhist art and the theory of aniconism" in ''Art Journal'', Winter 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sky-blue ===
Thondup and Talbott identify dharmakaya with the naked ("sky-clad"; Sanskrit: ''Digāmbara''), unornamented, sky-blue [[Samantabhadra]]:
{{quote|In Nyingma icons, dharmakāya is symbolized by a naked, sky-coloured (light blue) male and female Buddha in union [Kāmamudrā], called Samantabhadra [and [[Samantabhadrī (tutelary)|Samantabhadrī]]].&lt;ref name="Thondup, Tulku 1996, p.48" /&gt;{{refn|group=lower-alpha|For further discussion of 'Kāmamudrā' (English: "love-seal") refer: [[mudra]], [[mahamudra]] and [[Yab-Yum]].}}}}

Fremantle states:
{{quote|Space is simultaneously the first and the last of the great elements. It is the origin and precondition of the other four, and it is also their culmination... The Sanskrit word for space is the same as for the sky: ''[[akasha]]'', which means "shining and clear." What is it that we call the sky? It marks the boundary of our vision, the limit our sight can reach. If we could see more clearly, the sky would extend infinitely into outer space. The sky is an imaginary boundary set by the limitations of our senses, and also by the limitations of our mind, since we find it almost impossible to imagine a totally limitless [U]niverse. Space is the dimension in which everything exists. It is all-encompassing, all-pervading, and boundless. It is synonymous with emptiness: that emptiness which is simultaneously fullness.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francesca Fremantle|Fremantle, Francesca]] (2001). ''Luminous Emptiness: Understanding the Tibetan Book of the Dead''. Boston: Shambala Publications. {{ISBN|1-57062-450-X}}. p.85&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The colour blue is an iconographic polysemic rendering of the ''[[mahābhūta]]'' element of the "pure light" of space (Sanskrit: ''ākāśa'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Francesca Fremantle|Fremantle, Francesca]] (2001). ''Luminous Emptiness: Understanding the Tibetan Book of the Dead''. Boston: Shambala Publications. {{ISBN|1-57062-450-X}}. p.86&lt;/ref&gt;

The conceptually bridging and building poetic device of analogy, as an exemplar where ''dharmakaya'' is evocatively likened to sky and space, is a persistent and pervasive visual metaphor throughout the early [[Dzogchen]] and Nyingma literature and functions as a linkage and conduit between the 'conceptual' and 'conceivable' and the 'ineffable' and 'inconceivable' (Sanskrit: ''acintya''). It is particularly referred to by the ''[[terma (religion)|terma]]'' ''Gongpa Zangtel'' {{refn|group=lower-alpha|Wylie: ''kun tu bzang po'i dgongs pa zang thal du bstan pa''; English: ''Direct Revelation of Samantabhadra's Mind''}}, a terma cycle revealed by [[Rigdzin Gödem]] (1337–1408) and part of the Nyingma "Northern Treasures" ({{bo|w=byang gter}}).&lt;ref&gt;Kunsang, Eric Pema  (compiler, translator); Tweed, Michael (editor); Schmidt, Marcia Binder (editor); Zanpo, Ngawang (artwork) (2006).

Sawyer conveys the importance of [[melong|mirror]] iconography to ''dharmakaya'':

Diffraction processes affecting [[wave]]s are amenable to [[Quantity|quantitative]] description and analysis. Such treatments are applied to a wave passing through one or more slits whose width is specified as a proportion of the [[wavelength]]. [[Numerical approximation]]s may be used, including the [[Fresnel approximation|Fresnel]] and [[Fraunhofer diffraction|Fraunhofer approximation]]s.

== General diffraction ==
Because diffraction is the result of addition of all waves (of given wavelength) along all unobstructed paths, the usual procedure is to consider the contribution of an infinitesimally small neighborhood around a certain path (this contribution is usually called a [[wavelet]]) and then integrate over all paths (= add all wavelets) from the source to the detector (or given point on a screen). 

Thus in order to determine the pattern produced by diffraction, the phase and the amplitude of each of the wavelets is calculated. That is, at each point in space we must determine the distance to each of the simple sources on the incoming wavefront. If the distance to each of the simple sources differs by an integer number of wavelengths, all the wavelets will be in phase, resulting in constructive interference. If the distance to each source is an integer plus one half of a wavelength, there will be complete destructive interference. Usually, it is sufficient to determine these minima and maxima to explain the observed diffraction effects.  

The simplest descriptions of diffraction are those in which the situation can be reduced to a two-dimensional problem. For water waves, this is already the case, as water waves propagate only on the surface of the water. For light, we can often neglect one dimension if the diffracting object extends in that direction over a distance far greater than the wavelength. In the case of light shining through small circular holes we will have to take into account the full three-dimensional nature of the problem.

Several qualitative observations can be made of diffraction in general:
* The angular spacing of the features in the diffraction pattern is inversely proportional to the dimensions of the object causing the diffraction. In other words: the smaller the diffracting object, the wider the resulting diffraction pattern, and vice versa. (More precisely, this is true of the [[sine]]s of the angles.)
* The diffraction angles are invariant under scaling; that is, they depend only on the ratio of the wavelength to the size of the diffracting object.
* When the diffracting object has a periodic structure, for example in a diffraction grating, the features generally become sharper. The fourth figure, for example, shows a comparison of a [[Double-slit experiment|double-slit]] pattern with a pattern formed by five slits, both sets of slits having the same spacing between the center of one slit and the next.

==Approximations==
The problem of calculating what a diffracted wave looks like, is the problem of determining the phase of each of the simple sources on the incoming wave front. It is mathematically easier to consider the case of far-field or [[Fraunhofer diffraction]], where the point of observation is far from that of the diffracting obstruction, and as a result, involves less complex mathematics than the more general case of near-field or [[Fresnel diffraction]]. To make this statement more quantitative, let us consider a diffracting object at the origin that has a size &lt;math&gt;\ a&lt;/math&gt;. For definiteness let us say we are diffracting light and we are interested in what the intensity looks like on a screen a distance &lt;math&gt;\ L&lt;/math&gt; away from the object. At some point on the screen the path length to one side of the object is given by the Pythagorean theorem
:&lt;math&gt;S =\sqrt{L^2+(x+a/2)^2}&lt;/math&gt;{{Elucidate|date=August 2015}}
If we now consider the situation where &lt;math&gt;\ L&gt;&gt;(x+a/2)&lt;/math&gt;, the path length becomes
:&lt;math&gt;S\approx\left(L+\frac{(x+a/2)^2}{2 L}\right)= L + \frac{x^2}{2L}+\frac{x a}{2L}+\frac{a^2}{8L}&lt;/math&gt;
This is the Fresnel approximation. To further simplify things: If the diffracting object is much smaller than the distance &lt;math&gt;\ L&lt;/math&gt;, the last term will contribute much less than a wavelength to the path length, and will then not change the phase appreciably. That is &lt;math&gt;\frac{a^2}{L}&lt;&lt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;. The result is the Fraunhofer approximation, which is only valid very far away from the object 
:&lt;math&gt;S \approx L + \frac{x^2}{2L}+\frac{x a}{2L}&lt;/math&gt;
Depending on the size of the diffraction object, the distance to the object and the wavelength of the wave, the Fresnel approximation, the Fraunhofer approximation or neither approximation may be valid. As the distance between the measured point of diffraction and the obstruction point increases, the diffraction patterns or results predicted converge towards those of Fraunhofer diffraction, which is more often observed in nature due to the extremely small wavelength of visible light.

== Diffraction from an array of narrow slits==

===A simple quantitative description===
[[Image:TwoSlitInterference.svg|right|thumb|Diagram of a two slit diffraction problem, showing the angle to the first minimum, where a path length difference of a half wavelength causes destructive interference.]]

Multiple-slit arrangements can be mathematically considered as multiple simple wave sources, if the slits are narrow enough. For light, a slit is an opening that is infinitely extended in one dimension, and this has the effect of reducing a wave problem in 3D-space to a simpler problem in 2D-space. 
The simplest case is that of two narrow slits, spaced a distance &lt;math&gt;\ a&lt;/math&gt; apart. To determine the maxima and minima in the amplitude we must determine the path difference to the first slit and to the second one. In the Fraunhofer approximation, with the observer far away from the slits, the difference in path length to the two slits can be seen from the image to be
:&lt;math&gt;\ \Delta S={a} \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;
Maxima in the intensity occur if this path length difference is an integer number of wavelengths.

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\ {a} \sin \theta = n \lambda &lt;/math&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; || rowspan=4 |
:where
:&lt;math&gt;\ n&lt;/math&gt; is an [[integer]] that labels the ''order'' of each maximum,
:&lt;math&gt;\ \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength,
:&lt;math&gt;\ a&lt;/math&gt; is the distance between the slits
: and &lt;math&gt;\ \theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angle at which constructive interference occurs.
|-
|
|}

The corresponding minima are at path differences of an integer number plus one half of the wavelength:
:&lt;math&gt; {a} \sin \theta = \lambda (n+1/2) \,&lt;/math&gt;.

For an array of slits, positions of the minima and maxima are not changed, the ''fringes'' visible on a screen however do become sharper, as can be seen in the image. 
[[Image:Diffraction2vs5.jpg|right|frame|2-slit and 5-slit diffraction of red laser light]]

===Mathematical description===
To calculate this intensity pattern, one needs to introduce some more sophisticated methods. The mathematical representation of a radial wave is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\ E(r) = A \cos (k r - \omega t + \phi)/r&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\ k=\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ \lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength, &lt;math&gt;\ \omega&lt;/math&gt; is frequency of the wave and &lt;math&gt;\ \phi&lt;/math&gt; is the phase of the wave at the slits at time t=0. The wave at a screen some distance away from the plane of the slits is given by the sum of the waves emanating from each of the slits. 
To make this problem a little easier, we introduce the complex wave &lt;math&gt;\ \Psi&lt;/math&gt;, the real part of which is equal to &lt;math&gt;\ E&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ \Psi(r)=A e^{i (k r-\omega t +\phi)}/r&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\ E(r)=Re(\Psi(r))&lt;/math&gt;
The absolute value of this function gives the wave amplitude, and the complex phase of the function corresponds to the phase of the wave. &lt;math&gt;\ \Psi&lt;/math&gt; is referred to as the complex amplitude.
With &lt;math&gt;\ N&lt;/math&gt; slits, the total wave at point &lt;math&gt;\ x&lt;/math&gt; on the screen is
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi_{total}=A e^{i(-\omega t +\phi)}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} \frac{e^{i k \sqrt{(x-n a)^2+L^2}}}{\sqrt{(x-n a)^2+L^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since we are for the moment only interested in the amplitude and relative phase, we can ignore any overall phase factors that are not dependent on &lt;math&gt;\ x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\ n&lt;/math&gt;. We approximate &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{(x-n a)^2+L^2}\approx L+ (x-na)^2/2L&lt;/math&gt;. In the [[Fraunhofer limit]] we can neglect terms of order :&lt;math&gt;\frac{a^2}{2L}&lt;/math&gt; in the exponential, and any terms involving &lt;math&gt;\ a/L&lt;/math&gt;  or &lt;math&gt;\ x/L&lt;/math&gt; in the denominator. The sum becomes
:&lt;math&gt;\Psi=A \frac{e^{i\left( k (\frac{x^2}{2 L}+L)-\omega t +\phi\right)}}{L}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} e^{-i k \frac{x n a}{L}}&lt;/math&gt;

The sum has the form of a [[Geometric progression|geometric sum]] and can be evaluated to give

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi=A \frac{e^{i\left( k (\frac{x^2-(N-1)ax}{2 L}+L)-\omega t +\phi\right)}}{L} \frac {\sin\left(\frac{Nkax}{2L}\right)} {\sin\left(\frac{kax}{2L}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

The intensity is given by the absolute value of the complex amplitude squared 
:&lt;math&gt;I(x)=\Psi \Psi^*=|\Psi|^2=I_0\left( \frac{\sin\left(\frac{Nkax}{2L}\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{kax}{2L}\right)}\right)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Psi^*&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[complex conjugate]] of &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt;.

==Quantitative analysis of single-slit diffraction==
[[File:Wavelength=slitwidthblue3D.gif|thumb|Numerical approximation of diffraction pattern from a slit of width equal to wavelength of an incident plane wave in 3D blue visualization]]
[[Image:Wave Diffraction 4Lambda Slit.png|right|thumb|300px|Numerical approximation of diffraction pattern from a slit of width four wavelengths with an incident plane wave. The main central beam, nulls, and phase reversals are apparent.]]
[[Image:Single_Slit_Diffraction_(english).svg|right|thumb|300px|Graph and image of single-slit diffraction]]

As an example, an exact equation can now be derived for the intensity of the diffraction pattern as a function of angle in the case of single-slit diffraction. 

A mathematical representation of [[Huygens' principle]] can be used to start an equation.

Consider a monochromatic complex plane wave &lt;math&gt;\Psi^\prime&lt;/math&gt; of wavelength λ incident on a slit of width ''a''. 

If the slit lies in the x&amp;prime;-y&amp;prime; plane, with its center at the origin, then it can be assumed that diffraction generates a complex wave ψ, traveling radially in the r direction away from the slit, and this is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = \int_{\mathrm{slit}} \frac{i}{r\lambda} \Psi^\prime e^{-ikr}\,d\mathrm{slit}&lt;/math&gt;

Let (x&amp;prime;,y&amp;prime;,0) be a point inside the slit over which it is being integrated. If  (x,0,z) is the location at which the intensity of the diffraction pattern is being computed, the slit extends from &lt;math&gt;x^\prime=-a/2&lt;/math&gt;  to &lt;math&gt;+a/2\,&lt;/math&gt;, and from &lt;math&gt;y'=-\infty&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

The distance ''r'' from the slot is: 

:&lt;math&gt;r = \sqrt{\left(x - x^\prime\right)^2 + y^{\prime2} + z^2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r = z \left(1 + \frac{\left(x - x^\prime\right)^2 + y^{\prime2}}{z^2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Assuming [[Fraunhofer diffraction]] will result in the conclusion &lt;math&gt;z \gg \big|\left(x - x^\prime\right)\big|&lt;/math&gt;.  In other words, the distance to the target is much larger than the diffraction width on the target.
By the [[binomial expansion]] rule, ignoring terms quadratic and higher, the quantity on the right can be estimated to be:

:&lt;math&gt;r \approx z \left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{\left(x - x^\prime \right)^2 + y^{\prime 2}}{z^2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;r \approx z + \frac{\left(x - x^\prime\right)^2 + y^{\prime 2}}{2z}&lt;/math&gt;

It can be seen that 1/''r'' in front of the equation is non-oscillatory, i.e. its contribution to the magnitude of the intensity is small compared to our exponential factors.  Therefore, we will lose little accuracy by approximating it as ''1/z''.

|&lt;math&gt;\Psi \,&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{i \Psi^\prime}{z \lambda} \int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-ik\left[z+\frac{ \left(x - x^\prime \right)^2 + y^{\prime 2}}{2z}\right]} \,dy^\prime \,dx^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{i \Psi^\prime}{z \lambda} e^{-ikz} \int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}}e^{-ik\left[\frac{\left(x - x^\prime \right)^2}{2z}\right]} \,dx^\prime \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-ik\left[\frac{y^{\prime 2}}{2z}\right]} \,dy^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
|-

|-
|}

To make things cleaner, a placeholder 'C' is used to denote constants in the equation.  It is important to keep in mind that C can contain imaginary numbers, thus the wave function will be complex. However, at the end, the ψ will be bracketed, which will eliminate any imaginary components.

Now, in Fraunhofer diffraction, &lt;math&gt;kx^{\prime 2}/z&lt;/math&gt; is small, so &lt;math&gt;e^\frac{-ikx^{\prime 2}}{2z} \approx 1&lt;/math&gt; (note that &lt;math&gt;x^\prime&lt;/math&gt; participates in this exponential and it is being integrated).

In contrast the term &lt;math&gt;e^\frac{-ikx^2}{2z}&lt;/math&gt; can be eliminated from the equation, since when bracketed it gives 1.
:&lt;math&gt;\langle e^\frac{-ikx^2}{2z}|e^\frac{-ikx^2}{2z} \rangle=e^\frac{-ikx^2}{2z} (e^\frac{-ikx^2}{2z})^*=e^\frac{-ikx^2}{2z} e^\frac{+ikx^2}{2z}=e^0=1&lt;/math&gt;

(For the same reason we have also eliminated the term &lt;math&gt;e^{-ikz}&lt;/math&gt;)

Taking &lt;math&gt;C = \Psi^\prime \sqrt{\frac{i}{z\lambda}}&lt;/math&gt; results in:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Psi\, &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= C \int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}}e^\frac{ikxx^\prime}{z} \,dx^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;=C \frac{\left(e^\frac{ikax}{2z} - e^\frac{-ikax}{2z}\right)}{\frac{ikx}{z}}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

It can be noted through [[Euler's formula]] and its derivatives that &lt;math&gt;\sin x = \frac{e^{ix} - e^{-ix}}{2i}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sin \theta = \frac{x}{z}&lt;/math&gt;. 

&lt;math&gt;\Psi = aC \frac{\sin\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}{\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}} = aC \left[ \operatorname{sinc} \left( \frac{ka\sin\theta}{2} \right) \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where the (unnormalized) [[sinc function]] is defined by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{sinc}(x) \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  \frac{\operatorname{sin}(x)}{x}&lt;/math&gt;.

Now, substituting in &lt;math&gt;\frac{2\pi}{\lambda} = k&lt;/math&gt;, the intensity (squared amplitude) &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of the diffracted waves at an angle θ is given by:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;I(\theta)\, &lt;/math&gt;
|
|&lt;math&gt;= I_0 {\left[ \operatorname{sinc} \left( \frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin \theta \right) \right] }^2 &lt;/math&gt;
|}

==Quantitative analysis of ''N''-slit diffraction==
[[Image:Laserdiffraction.jpg|right|frame|Double-slit diffraction of red laser light]]

[[Image:Diffraction2vs5.jpg|right|frame|2-slit and 5-slit diffraction]]

Let us again start with the mathematical representation of [[Huygens' principle]].

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = \int_{\mathrm{slit}} \frac{i}{r\lambda} \Psi^\prime e^{-ikr}\,d\mathrm{slit}&lt;/math&gt;

Consider &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; slits in the prime plane of equal size &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and spacing &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; spread along the &lt;math&gt;x^\prime&lt;/math&gt; axis.  As above, the distance &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; from slit 1 is:

:&lt;math&gt;r = z \left(1 + \frac{\left(x - x^\prime\right)^2 + y^{\prime2}}{z^2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

To generalize this to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; slits, we make the observation that while &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; remain constant, &lt;math&gt;x^\prime&lt;/math&gt; shifts by 

:&lt;math&gt;x_{j=0 \cdots n-1}^{\prime} = x_0^\prime - j d &lt;/math&gt;

Thus 

:&lt;math&gt;r_j = z \left(1 + \frac{\left(x - x^\prime - j d \right)^2 + y^{\prime2}}{z^2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

and the sum of all &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; contributions to the wave function is:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} C \int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}} e^\frac{ikx\left(x^\prime - jd\right)}{z} e^\frac{-ik\left(x^\prime - jd\right)^2}{2z} \,dx^\prime&lt;/math&gt;

Again noting that &lt;math&gt;\frac{k\left(x^\prime -jd\right)^2}{z}&lt;/math&gt; is small, so &lt;math&gt;e^\frac{-ik\left(x^\prime -jd\right)^2}{2z} \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;, we have:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Psi\, &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= C\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \int_{-\frac{a}{2}}^{\frac{a}{2}} e^\frac{ikx\left(x^\prime - jd\right)}{z} \,dx^\prime&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} \frac{\left(e^{\frac{ikax}{2z} - \frac{ijkxd}{z}}  - e^{\frac{-ikax}{2z}-\frac{ijkxd}{z}}\right)}{\frac{2ikax}{2z}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} e^\frac{ijkxd}{z} \frac{\left(e^\frac{ikax}{2z} - e^\frac{-ikax}{2z}\right)}{\frac{2ikax}{2z}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \frac{\sin\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}{\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}} \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} e^{ijkd\sin\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Now, we can use the following identity

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^{N-1} e^{x j} = \frac{1 - e^{Nx}}{1 - e^x}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting into our equation, we find:

{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\Psi\, &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \frac{\sin\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}{\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}\left(\frac{1 - e^{iNkd\sin\theta}}{1 - e^{ikd\sin\theta}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \frac{\sin\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}{\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}\left(\frac{e^{-iNkd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}-e^{iNkd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}}{e^{-ikd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}-e^{ikd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}}\right)\left(\frac{e^{iNkd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}}{e^{ikd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \frac{\sin\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}{\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}}\frac{\frac{e^{-iNkd \frac{\sin\theta}{2}} - e^{iNkd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}}{2i}}{\frac{e^{-ikd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}} - e^{ikd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}}{2i}} \left(e^{i(N-1)kd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= a C \frac{\sin\left(\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}\right)}{\frac{ka\sin\theta}{2}} \frac{\sin\left(\frac{Nkd\sin\theta}{2}\right)} {\sin\left(\frac{kd\sin\theta}{2}\right)}e^{i\left(N-1\right)kd\frac{\sin\theta}{2}} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

We now make our &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; substitution as before and represent all non-oscillating constants by the &lt;math&gt;I_0&lt;/math&gt; variable as in the 1-slit diffraction and bracket the result.  Remember that 

:&lt;math&gt;\langle e^{ix} \Big| e^{ix}\rangle\ = e^0 = 1&lt;/math&gt;

This allows us to discard the tailing exponent and we have our answer:

:&lt;math&gt;I\left(\theta\right) = I_0 \left[ \operatorname{sinc} \left( \frac{\pi a}{\lambda} \sin \theta \right) \right]^2 \cdot \left[\frac{\sin\left(\frac{N\pi d}{\lambda}\sin\theta\right)}{\sin\left(\frac{\pi d}{\lambda}\sin\theta\right)}\right]^2&lt;/math&gt;

==General case for far field==
In the far field, where r is essentially constant, then the equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\Psi = \int_{\mathrm{slit}} \frac{i}{r\lambda} \Psi^\prime e^{-ikr}\,d\mathrm{slit}&lt;/math&gt;

is equivalent to doing a [[fourier transform]] on the gaps in the barrier.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. Rodenburg, [http://www.rodenburg.org/theory/y1300.html The Fourier Transform]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Short description|Material supporting an assertion}}
[[File:Dublin Castle Gates of Fortitude and Justice 05.JPG|thumb|upright|The balance scales seen in depictions of [[Lady Justice]] can be seen as representing the weighing of evidence in a legal proceeding.]]

'''Evidence''', broadly construed, is anything presented in support of an [[Logical assertion|assertion]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.shoreline.edu/doldham/SRR.html Davis Oldham: 'Evidence' (English 101 &amp; 102) at Shoreline Community College, shoreline.edu] Accessed 18 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; This support may be strong or weak. The strongest type of evidence is that which provides direct [[proof (truth)|proof]] of the [[truth]] of an assertion. At the other extreme is evidence that is merely consistent with an assertion but does not rule out other, contradictory assertions, as in [[circumstantial evidence]].

In [[law]], [[Evidence (law)|rules of evidence]] govern the types of evidence that are [[Admissible evidence|admissible]] in a legal proceeding. Types of legal evidence include [[testimony]], [[documentary evidence]],&lt;ref&gt;American College of Forensic Examiners Institute. (2016). The Certified Criminal Investigator Body of Knowledge. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press. Pg113. {{ISBN|978-1-4987-5206-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Real evidence|physical evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;American College of Forensic Examiners Institute. (2016). ''The Certified Criminal Investigator Body of Knowledge''. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press. Pg112. {{ISBN|978-1-4987-5206-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parts of a legal case which are not in controversy are known, in general, as the "facts of the case." Beyond any facts that are undisputed, a judge or jury is usually tasked with being a [[trier of fact]] for the other issues of a case. Evidence and rules are used to decide [[questions of fact]] that are disputed, some of which may be determined by the [[legal burden of proof]] relevant to the case. Evidence in certain cases (e.g. [[capital crime]]s) must be more compelling than in other situations (e.g. minor civil disputes), which drastically affects the quality and quantity of evidence necessary to decide a case.

[[Scientific evidence]] consists of [[observation]]s and [[experiment]]al results that serve to support, refute, or modify a scientific [[hypothesis]] or [[Scientific theory|theory]], when collected and interpreted in accordance with the [[scientific method]].

In [[philosophy]], the study of evidence is closely tied to [[epistemology]], which considers the nature of [[knowledge]] and how it can be acquired.

==Burden of proof==
{{Main|Legal burden of proof|Philosophic burden of proof}}

The ''burden of proof'' is the obligation of a party in an argument or dispute to provide sufficient evidence to shift the other party's or a third party's belief from their initial position. The burden of proof must be fulfilled by both establishing confirming evidence and negating oppositional evidence. Conclusions drawn from evidence may be subject to criticism based on a perceived failure to fulfill the burden of proof.

Two principal considerations are:
# On whom does the burden of proof rest?
# To what degree of certitude must the assertion be supported?
The latter question depends on the nature of the point under contention and determines the quantity and quality of evidence required to meet the burden of proof.

In a [[criminal procedure|criminal trial]] in the United States, for example, the [[Prosecutor|prosecution]] carries the burden of proof since the [[defendant]] is [[Presumption of innocence|presumed innocent]] until proven guilty [[Reasonable doubt|beyond a reasonable doubt]]. Similarly, in most [[civil procedure]]s, the [[plaintiff]] carries the burden of proof and must convince a judge or jury that the preponderance of the evidence is on their side. Other legal standards of proof include "reasonable suspicion", "probable cause" (as for [[arrest]]), "''[[prima facie]]'' evidence", "credible evidence", "substantial evidence", and "clear and convincing evidence".

In a philosophical [[debate]], there is an implicit burden of proof on the party asserting a claim, since the default position is generally one of neutrality or unbelief. Each party in a debate will therefore carry the burden of proof for any assertion they make in the argument, although some assertions may be granted by the other party without further evidence. If the debate is set up as a [[resolution (law)|resolution]] to be supported by one side and refuted by another, the overall burden of proof is on the side supporting the resolution.

==Science==
{{Main|Scientific evidence}}
In scientific research evidence is accumulated through observations of phenomena that occur in the natural world, or which are created as [[experiment]]s in a [[laboratory]] or other controlled conditions. [[Scientific evidence]] usually goes towards supporting or rejecting a [[hypothesis]].

The burden of proof is on the person making a contentious claim.  Within science, this translates to the burden resting on presenters of a paper, in which the presenters argue for their specific findings. This paper is placed before a panel of judges where the presenter must defend the thesis against all challenges.

When evidence is contradictory to predicted expectations, the evidence and the ways of making it are often closely scrutinized (see [[experimenter's regress]]) and only at the end of this process is the hypothesis rejected: this can be referred to as '[[refutation]] of the hypothesis'.  The rules for evidence used by science are collected systematically in an attempt to avoid the [[bias]] inherent to [[anecdotal evidence]].

==Law==
[[File:FBI Evidence Response Team.jpg|thumb|An [[FBI]] Evidence Response Team gathering evidence by dusting an area for fingerprints]]
{{Main|Evidence (law)}}
Evidence forms the very foundation of a legal system,{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} without which law would be subject to the whims of those with power.

In law, the production and presentation of evidence depends first on establishing on whom the [[Legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] lies.  Admissible evidence is that which a court receives and considers for the purposes of deciding a particular case. Two primary burden-of-proof considerations exist in law.  The first is on whom the burden rests.  In many, especially Western, courts, the burden of proof is placed on the prosecution in criminal cases and the plaintiff in civil cases.  The second consideration is the degree of certitude proof must reach, depending on both the quantity and quality of evidence.  These degrees are different for criminal and civil cases, the former requiring evidence beyond a [[reasonable doubt]], the latter considering only which side has the [[preponderance of evidence]], or whether the proposition is more likely true or false.  The decision maker, often a jury, but sometimes a judge, decides whether the burden of proof has been fulfilled.

After deciding who will carry the burden of proof, evidence is first gathered and then presented before the court:

===Collection===
In criminal investigation, rather than attempting to prove an abstract or hypothetical point, the evidence gatherers attempt to determine who is responsible for a [[Crime|criminal]] act.  The focus of criminal evidence is to connect physical evidence and reports of witnesses to a specific person.

===Presentation===
The path that physical evidence takes from the scene of a crime or the arrest of a suspect to the courtroom is called the [[chain of custody]]. In a criminal case, this path must be clearly documented or attested to by those who handled the evidence. If the chain of evidence is broken, a defendant may be able to persuade the judge to declare the evidence [[Admissible evidence|inadmissible]].

Presenting evidence before the court differs from the gathering of evidence in important ways. Gathering evidence may take many forms; presenting evidence that tend to prove or disprove the point at issue is strictly governed by rules. Failure to follow these rules leads to any number of consequences. In law, certain policies allow (or require) evidence to be excluded from consideration based either on indicia relating to reliability, or broader social concerns. Testimony (which tells) and exhibits (which show) are the two main categories of evidence presented at a trial or hearing. In the United States, evidence in federal court is admitted or excluded under the [[Federal Rules of Evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://federalevidence.com/rules-of-evidence|title=Federal Rules of Evidence 2008 |publisher=Federal Evidence Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They introduced their algorithm in 1993. The input of the algorithm is a [[Gröbner basis]] of a zero-dimensional [[Ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] in the ring of [[polynomial]]s over a [[Field (mathematics)|field]] with respect to a [[monomial order]] and a second [[monomial order]]; As its output, it returns a Gröbner basis of the ideal with respect to the second ordering.

'''Feminist interventions in the philosophy of law''' concern the examination and reformulation of traditional legal systems in order to better reflect the political, social, and economic concerns of women---which also includes various other minority and ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/feminism-law/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Francis|first=Leslie|last2=Smith|first2=Patricia|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though it draws heavily from [[feminist legal theory]], feminist interventions in the philosophy of law differs from the more common feminist jurisprudence as it also seeks to explain the justification that a government has in interfering with the lives of its citizenry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moseley|first=Alexander|date=|title=Interventionism|url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/interven/|journal=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|volume=|pages=|via=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, then, feminist interventions in legal philosophy specifically addresses the relationship and rationale between a judicial system’s exercise of power and its effects on female citizens. While particular views vary greatly, most feminist interventions in the philosophy of law operate under a belief that many contemporary legal systems are predicated on patriarchal notions of masculinity that result in a system of deeply-rooted bias and inequality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bartlett|first=Katharine|date=1990|title=Feminist Legal Methods|url=|journal=Harvard Law Review|volume=103|pages=829–88|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The rule of law ==
The [[rule of law]] is generally defined as the fundamental principle that both government and its citizens all operate under a system of general and fair rules that are publicly disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/rule-of-law|title=the definition of rule of law|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2018-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In relation to feminism, feminist philosophers of law typically perceive the current iteration of the rule of law as an institution that perpetuates primarily patriarchal norms, or in terms of power relationships that have been primarily been dominated by males.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, P., 2005. “Four Themes in Feminist Legal Theory: Difference, Dominance, Domesticity &amp; Denial,” in M. Golding and W. Edmundson, ''Philosophy of Law &amp; Legal Theory'', Oxford: Blackwell Publishing, pp. 90–104.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, they perceive the current normativity of law as perpetuating male values as the status quo. Though feminists maintain several different positions in terms of how to address these issues, it is almost universally agreed that these patriarchal structures cannot be properly challenged until their underlying biases are fully exposed.&lt;ref&gt;Mackinnon, Catharine. "Toward a Feminist Theory of the State," ''Women's Rights Law Reporter'' vol. 12, no. 3 (Fall 1990): p. 205-208.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Role of intervention by ideology ==
As in traditional feminist jurisprudence, feminists hold several competing philosophical positions in regards to ways the law should work to better accommodate women.

=== Cultural Feminism ===
[[Cultural feminists]] contend that the solution to attaining legal equality must come from procedural reform that embraces the differences between men and women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The challenge here derives from acknowledging various differences between men and women without further reinforcing gender stereotypes or promoting sexist practices.&lt;ref&gt;Minow, M., 1991. ''Making All the Difference: Inclusion, Exclusion &amp; American Law'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the government must intervene insofar as it promotes laws that embrace only the immutable differences between the sexes—such as [[pregnancy]]—with the ultimate goal being equal recognition to women's moral voice of caring and communal values.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Specifically, whereas women emphasize the importance of relationships and reconciliation of conflicting positions, men emphasize more abstract principles such as rights and logic.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;“Feminist Jurisprudence.” ''LII / Legal Information Institute'', Cornell Law School, 16 Mar. 2018, www.law.cornell.edu/wex/feminist_jurisprudence.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, cultural feminists see their intervention into law as a means to achieve balance and reconciliation between the two.

=== Liberal Feminism ===
[[Liberal feminism|Liberal feminists]] believe women and men possess the same rational capabilities and have no fundamental differences in capability; therefore, they assert that women should have equal opportunity as men to the extent that some liberal feminists believe there should be no legal distinctions between men or women.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Accordingly, the law’s role, according to the liberal feminist, should strive for the utmost equality between men and women. This is because liberal feminists believe that women have long been denied the same bodily autonomy that has been enjoyed by their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Rhode, D. and C. Sanger (eds.), 2005. ''Gender and Rights'', New York: International Library of Essays on Rights.&lt;/ref&gt; Such issues manifest themselves in the form of the debate on whether or not the law ought to legally recognize industries like prostitution as a legitimate entity.&lt;ref&gt;Dempsey, M.M., 2010. “Sex Trafficking and Criminalization: In Defense of Feminist Abolitionism,” ''University of Pennsylvania Law Review'', 158: 1729–1778&lt;/ref&gt;

Another noteworthy area in law where parity is specifically desired is in the “standards of reasonableness” that are used in criminal, contract, and tort law, which liberal feminists argue are predicated on masculine assumptions of what is “reasonable.”&lt;ref&gt;Chamallas, M. and J. Wriggins, 2010. ''The Measure of Injury: Race, Gender, and Tort Law'', New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, liberal feminists seek to articulate how this masculine norm accordingly affects those aspects of law in regards to judging women or other feminine groups as “reasonable” in trial.

Furthermore, liberal feminists also place a particular value on [[intersectionality]] theories.&lt;ref&gt;Crenshaw, K., with N. Gotanda, G. Peller and K. Thomas (eds.), 1996. ''Critical Race Theory: Key Writing that Formed the Movement'', New York: New Press&lt;/ref&gt; The primary reason for this growing movement is that keeping categories such as race and sex separate often made such persons "invisible" by making it more difficult to exact equality for persons who were oppressed for their gender, race, or class.&lt;ref&gt;Haslanger, S., 2012. ''Resisting Reality'', New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominant Feminism ===
[[Radical feminism|Dominant]], or ''radical'', feminists maintain that there are differences between men and women, but these differences do not derive from innate differences between men and women; rather, such differences come as a result of women being subjugated by men in larger society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; As such, it is not merely enough to embrace the differences between men and women: sexual equality under the rule of law must be established upon a female paradigm that cannot simply be an addition to the current paradigm of masculinity.&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, C. A. 1987. ''Feminism Unmodified''. Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of philosophical interventions, dominant feminists contend that a systemic reevaluation must take place within any legal system that operates to subjugate women. Moreover, the law must be constructed in such a way that it does not work to a disparate effect of either sex.&lt;ref&gt;Baer, J. A. 1999. ''Our Lives before the Law: Constructing a Feminist Jurisprudence''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, some radical feminists even contend that it is fundamentally flawed to have a paradigm based upon only women, because this mistakenly implies  women as all having the same interests, identities, needs, and values. Such paradigms are said to be flawed because they privilege the preferences and viewpoints of more privileged white women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Harris, A. 1990. Race and essentialism in feminist legal theory. ''Stanford Law Review'', 42: 581–616.Find this resource:&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, feminist analysis should focus on the intersections of gender, race, class, and sexual orientation and their treatment by law.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Still others seek policies or modes of analysis that use both men and women, of all kinds of background, as the starting point of analysis, and design rules for workplaces, families, politics, and society that are fully inclusive of these backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, W.1984–5. Equality’s riddle: pregnancy and equal treatment. ''New York University Review of Law and Social Change'', 13: 325–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of intervention in the United States ==

=== Bodily Autonomy ===
Feminist interventions concerning women's issues of bodily autonomy cover a wide range of legal topics, such as abortion, prostitution, and rape.

==== Abortion ====
Several American legal feminists have expressed approval of the Supreme Court's 1973 decision in ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', which guaranteed the right to have an abortion in the United States. [[Lucinda Peach]], for example, argued in her 2002 essay that controlling one’s own body was a necessary condition for any other freedom.&lt;ref&gt;Peach, L., 2002. ''Religious Lawmaking in a Secular State'', New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, though generally accepting of the Court's decision, have nevertheless argued that the Court's opinion was based upon "paternalistic attitudes" regarding women.&lt;ref&gt;Appleton, S.F., 2011. “Reproduction and Regret,” ''Yale Journal of Law &amp; Feminism'', 23: 255–333.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet, other feminist legal commentators have acknowledged the difficulties associated with the legalization of abortion in the United States. For example, certain feminists concerned with the rights of the disabled argue that abortion decisions that are based on inadequate or biased information about disabilities are inherently problematic.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Likewise, certain feminists of color are more concerned with whether some abortion policies themselves are racially biased, implicitly or even explicitly.&lt;ref&gt;Francis, L.P. (ed.), 2017. ''The Oxford Handbook of Reproductive Ethics'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars have even gone as far as to suggest that ''Roe v. Wade'' "was not a victory for women but a victory for the medical profession; it gave physicians, not women, the right to make abortion decisions."&lt;ref&gt;Petchesky RP, New York, Longman, 1984. 404 p. (Longman Series in Feminist Theory)&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Prostitution ====
Some legal feminists have argued that markets which cater specifically to sexual services should be banned by the state. This is because such markets are viewed as exploitative of marginalized classes of people and pose numerous risks to its workers.&lt;ref&gt;Shrage, Laurie, "Feminist Perspectives on Sex Markets", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Fall 2016 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.),&lt;/ref&gt; In her essay published in 2010, [[Debra Satz|Debrah Satz]] argued that feminist interventions in the law should be opposed to the legalization of prostitution, as prostitution often employs people from stigmatized or disempowered social classes, fails to create conditions for informed consent, endangers the health of its participants, and reinforces invidious stereotypes about women or other groups.&lt;ref&gt;Satz, D., 2010, ''Why Some Things Should Not Be for Sale: The Moral Limits of Markets'', New York: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Carole Pateman]] has argued that, because people’s bodies and sexual capacities are an integral part of their identity, the woman who works as a prostitute sells her womanhood and, consequently, her very self.&lt;ref&gt;Pateman, C., 1988, ''The Sexual Contract'', Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martha Nussbaum]]—who is a Professor of Law and Ethics at the University of Chicago—has devoted several of her publications to explaining why the social stigma associated with sex work is irrational. As she believes it, feminists should oppose the stigmatization of sex work, rather than oppose sex work for its contribution to the stigmatization of women.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Nussbaum, M., 1999, ''Sex and Social Justice'', Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Nussbaum speculated that the problems associated with prostitution are reflective of many other social practices, and that these social practices are not inherent to prostitution but are often a function of the prostitute’s working conditions and treatment by others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Sexual Assault ====
Feminist legal scholars have also attempted to address the many ways in which law fails to protect women and girls against forms of violence such as rape, domestic abuse, sexual harassment, and other forms of sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Traditionally, legal scholars acknowledge that a central purpose of civil law has been to keep men from violating one another; however, violation of women by men had historically been largely considered a private matter beyond the purview of law.&lt;ref&gt;Heyes, C., 2016. “Dead to the World: Rape, Unconsciousness, and Social Media,” ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'', 41: 361–383.&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic chastisement was once considered legitimate discipline of one’s wife and marital rape was excluded from the definition of rape in many criminal law statutes.&lt;ref&gt;Estrich, S., 1987. ''Real Rape'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press. ''Sex &amp; Power'', New York: Riverhead Books.

&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the past few decades, however, Feminists have noted that multiple nations have made advances to their legal protections regarding sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;Taslitz, A., 1999. ''Rape &amp; the Culture of the Courtroom'', New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, many western nations no longer require the corroboration of rape by witnesses; additionally, other jurisdictions hold that consent is no longer presumed from the absence of resistance; and most western nations now require far stricter requirements for the relevance of evidence presented in rape trials.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schulhofer, S., 1998. ''Unwanted Sex: The Culture of Intimidation &amp; the Failure of Law'', Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable feminist legal interventionists ==

She is currently a professor of law at the University of Michigan.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 
* [[Martha Albertson Fineman|Martha Fineman]] is the founder of the [[Feminism and Legal Theory Project]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;http://law.emory.edu/faculty-and-scholarship/faculty-profiles/fineman-profile.html&lt;/ref&gt; She is a prominent legal scholar who received her law degree from [[University of Chicago Law School|University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Much of her work and scholarship has been especially focused in the area of family law.&lt;ref&gt;Polikoff, Nancy D. (2000). "Why Lesbians and Gay Men Should Read Martha Fineman". ''The Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; the Law''. '''9''' (1): 167–176.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Formal epistemology''' uses formal methods from [[decision theory]], [[logic]], [[probability theory]] and [[computability theory]] to model and reason about issues of [[epistemological]] interest. Work in this area spans several academic fields, including [[philosophy]], [[computer science]], [[economics]], and [[statistics]]. The focus of formal epistemology has tended to differ somewhat from that of traditional epistemology, with topics like uncertainty, induction, and belief revision garnering more attention than the analysis of knowledge, skepticism, and issues with justification.

==History==
Though formally oriented epistemologists have been laboring since the emergence of [[formal logic]] and probability theory (if not earlier), only recently have they been organized under a common disciplinary title. This gain in popularity may be attributed to the organization of yearly Formal Epistemology Workshops by [[Branden Fitelson]] and [[Sahotra Sarkar]], starting in 2004, and the [[PHILOG]]-conferences starting in 2002 (The Network for Philosophical Logic and Its Applications) organized by [[Vincent F. Hendricks]]. Carnegie Mellon University's Philosophy Department hosts an annual summer school in logic and formal epistemology. In 2010, the department founded the [[Center for Formal Epistemology]].

==Topics==
Some of the topics that come under the heading of formal epistemology include:
* [[Ampliative inference]] (including [[inductive logic]]);
* [[Belief revision]] theory
* [[Game theory]] and decision theory;
* [[Algorithmic learning theory]] ([[computational epistemology]]);
* Formal approaches to [[paradoxes]] of belief and/or action;
* Formal models of epistemic states, like [[belief]] and [[uncertainty]];
* Formal theories of [[coherentism]] and confirmation;
* Foundations of probability and statistics.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5959">'''Frege's puzzles''' are puzzles about the [[semantics]] of [[proper name]]s, although related puzzles also arise in the case of [[indexical]]s. [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925) introduced the puzzle at the beginning of his article "Über Sinn und Bedeutung" ("[[On Sense and Reference]]") in 1892 in one of the most influential articles in [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophy of language]].

==The puzzles ==

The term "Frege's puzzle" is commonly applied to two related problems.  One is a problem about identity statements that Frege raised at the beginning of "On Sense and Reference", and another concerns propositional attitude reports.&lt;ref&gt;Zalta, Edward N., "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/frege/ Gottlob Frege]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Fall 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  For the first problem, consider the following two sentences:

(1) [[Hesperus]] is Hesperus.

(2) Hesperus is [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]].

Each of these sentences is true, since 'Hesperus' refers to the same object as 'Phosphorus' (the planet Venus). Nonetheless, (1) and (2) seem to differ in their meaning or what Frege called "cognitive value". (1) is just a truth of logic that can be known [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]], whereas (2) records an empirical truth that was discovered by astronomers. The problem, however, is that proper names are often taken to have no meaning beyond their reference (a view often associated with [[John Stuart Mill]]). But this seems to imply that the two statements mean the same thing, or have the same cognitive value.&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2017). Lexemes, practs, and those who have yet to decide. Linguistik Online, 81, 77-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2018). Which view of indirect reports do Persian data corroborate? International Review of Pragmatics, 10(1), 76-100. &lt;/ref&gt;

Frege proposed to resolve this puzzle by postulating a second level of meaning besides reference in the form of what he called [[Sense and reference|sense]]: a difference in the mode of presentation or the way an object can be "given" to us.  Thus 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' have the same reference, but differ in sense because they present Venus in different ways.

The second puzzle concerns [[propositional attitude]] reports, such as belief reports.  Ordinarily, coreferring names are substitutable [[salva veritate]], that is, without change in truth value.  For example, if 'Hesperus is bright' is true then 'Phosphorus is bright' is also true given that 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' refer to the same planet.  But now consider the following argument:

(3) Alex believes Hesperus is visible in the evening.

(4) Hesperus = Phosphorus.

(5) Alex believes Phosphorus is visible in the evening.

This argument appears to be [[Validity (logic)|invalid]]: even if (3) and (4) are true, (5) could be false.  If Alex is not aware that Hesperus and Phosphorus are the same planet, then it seems that he could believe that Hesperus is visible in the evening while rejecting the claim that Phosphorus is visible in the evening (perhaps he thinks Phosphorus, the morning star, is only visible in the morning).  The principle that coreferring names are substitutable ''salva veritate'' thus appears to fail in the context of belief reports (and similarly for other propositional attitude reports).

Frege again proposed to solve this problem by appeal to his distinction between sense and reference.  In particular, he held that when a proper name occurs in the context of an attitude report, its reference shifts to its ordinary sense: thus 'Phosphorus', for example, denotes the planet Venus when it occurs in the sentence 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' or in an identity sentence like (4), but when it occurs embedded in an attitude report like (5) it denotes its ordinary ''sense.''

==New theories of reference and the return of Frege's puzzle==

Frege's puzzle has received a great deal of attention since the attacks on the [[descriptivist theory of names]] mounted in the 1970s and 1980s by philosophers such as [[Keith Donnellan]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]].&lt;ref&gt;Cumming, S. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/names/ Names]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of these attacks on descriptivism, many philosophers embraced the Millian or direct-reference view of proper names, according to which the meaning of a name is simply its referent. As noted above, this Millian view has the result that (1) and (2) express the same proposition.  Similarly, the embedded sentences 'Hesperus is visible in the evening' and 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' from (3) and (5) express the same proposition.  It therefore looks like (3) and (5) cannot differ in truth value since they attribute belief in one and the same proposition.

In view of this problem, many philosophers of language have attempted to work out a solution to the puzzle within the confines of direct-reference theories of proper names. Some of these philosophers include [[Nathan Salmon]] (e.g. in ''Frege's puzzle'' and ''Content, Cognition, and Communication''), [[Howard Wettstein]] (e.g. in "Has Semantics Rested on a Mistake?"), [[Scott Soames]], [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]], [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] (e.g. in ''Reference and Reflexivity''), and [[Joseph Almog]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4302">In [[mathematics]], the '''Gabriel–Popescu theorem''' is an embedding theorem for certain [[abelian category|abelian categories]], introduced by {{harvs|txt|first1=Pierre|last1=Gabriel|author1-link=Pierre Gabriel|first2=Nicolae|last2=Popescu|author2-link=Nicolae Popescu|year=1964}}. It characterizes certain abelian categories (the [[Grothendieck category|Grothendieck categories]]) as [[Quotient of an abelian category|quotients]] of [[module categories]].

There are several generalizations and variations of the Gabriel–Popescu theorem, given by {{harvtxt|Kuhn|1994}} (for an [[AB5 category]] with a set of [[Generator (category theory)|generators]]), {{harvtxt|Lowen|2004}}, {{harvtxt|Porta|2010}} (for [[triangulated categories]]).

==Theorem==
Let ''A'' be a [[Grothendieck category]] (an [[AB5 category]] with a generator), ''G'' a generator of ''A'' and ''R'' be the [[endomorphism ring|ring of endomorphisms]] of ''G''; also, let ''S'' be the
[[functor]] from ''A'' to Mod-''R'' (the category of right ''R''-modules) defined by ''S''(''X'') = Hom(''G'',''X''). Then the Gabriel–Popescu theorem states that ''S'' is [[full functor|full]] and [[faithful functor|faithful]] and has an [[exact functor|exact]] [[adjoint functor|left adjoint]].

This implies that ''A'' is [[equivalence of categories|equivalent]] to the [[Serre quotient category]] of Mod-''R'' by a certain [[localizing subcategory]] ''C''. (A localizing subcategory of Mod-''R'' is a full subcategory ''C'' of Mod-''R'', closed under arbitrary [[direct sum]]s, such that for any [[short exact sequence]] of modules &lt;math&gt;0\rarr M_1\rarr M_2\rarr M_3\rarr 0&lt;/math&gt;, we have ''M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' in ''C'' if and only if ''M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' are in ''C''. The Serre quotient of Mod-''R'' by any localizing subcategory is a Grothendieck category.) We may take ''C'' to be the [[kernel (category theory)|kernel]] of the left adjoint of the functor ''S''.

Note that the embedding ''S'' of ''A'' into Mod-''R'' is [[Left exact functor|left-exact]] but not necessarily right-exact: cokernels of morphisms in ''A'' do not in general correspond to the cokernels of the corresponding morphisms in Mod-''R.''

During the 1980s, Aoki was part of the production staff for the ''[[American Top 40]]'' radio program.

==Campaigns==

===Sarah Silverman controversy===
In July 2001, Aoki became embroiled in a public controversy stemming from his objection to a joke told by comedian [[Sarah Silverman]], which involved her use of the [[term of disparagement|ethnic slur]] "[[chink]]", in an interview on the July 11, 2001 episode of ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Late Night with Conan O'Brien" July 11, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interview, Silverman explained that a friend had advised her on how to avoid [[jury|jury duty]] by writing a racial slur on the selection form, "something really inappropriate, like, 'I hate chinks'." However, Silverman said that she ultimately decided that she did not want to be thought of as a [[racism|racist]] and instead wrote, "I ''love'' chinks." The [[Associated Press]] quoted Aoki: "There is no excuse for something like this to have made the air. The term is the most offensive possible reference to a person of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] descent." [[NBC]] and [[Conan O'Brien]] issued an apology, but Silverman did not, insisting later on the July 26, 2001 episode of ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' that she did not believe that Aoki was genuinely offended, but exploiting the opportunity for publicity.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Politically Incorrect]]''. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. July 26, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverman and Aoki later appeared together on the August 22, 2001 episode of ''[[Politically Incorrect]],'' along with host [[Bill Maher]] and panelists [[David Spade]] and [[Anne-Marie Johnson]], the latter of whom was chair of the [[Screen Actors Guild]] Ethnic Employment Opportunity Committee.  After Silverman repeated the joke for exposition's sake, she opined that it made an implicit statement about the wrongness of [[racism]], rather than legitimizing it. Johnson, however, questioned the humor in the joke, and Aoki opined that such slurs should not be used in an off-the-cuff manner because it legitimized their use, and that use of the word "chink" was no better than the use of the word "[[nigger]]". Aoki, while acknowledging that [[satire]] was a legitimate practice, asserted that Silverman's execution of it was not successful because it ran the risk that people would assume she actually subscribed to the racist viewpoint of her character.

===''Banzai'' controversy===
In July 2003 Media Action Network protested the British program [[Banzai (TV series)|''Banzai'']], which is produced by [[Channel 4]]. Following the first U.S. broadcast of the series on the [[Fox Network]] on July 13, 2003, the Media Action Network accused the program, a spoof betting show that parodies Japanese game shows, of employing demeaning stereotypes of Asians. About 20 members of the group carried signs and shouted slogans outside a presentation by the Fox network to TV critics in Hollywood. Aoki commented, "This is like an Asian minstrel show. Can you imagine the black version of Banzai?" Fox spokesman Scott Grogin responded by saying, "We've received an entire range of comments on the show, both pro and con", and that as a satire, the show should be viewed as "tongue-in-cheek". According to Aoki, in discussions with the MANAA, Fox offered to include a disclaimer at the beginning of the show, but Aoki indicated that this would not assuage the MANAA, who wished the program not be broadcast at all.&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3586">In [[mathematics]], particularly [[topology]], the '''homeomorphism group''' of a [[topological space]] is the [[group (mathematics)|group]] consisting of all [[homeomorphism]]s from the space to itself with [[function composition]] as the group [[binary operation|operation]]. Homeomorphism groups are very important in the theory of topological spaces and in general are examples of [[automorphism group]]s. Homeomorphism groups are [[topological invariant]]s in the sense that the homeomorphism groups of homeomorphic topological spaces are [[Group isomorphism|isomorphic as groups]].

==Properties and Examples==
There is a natural [[group action]] of the homeomorphism group of a space on that space. Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a topological space and denote the homeomorphism group of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. The action is defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
    G\times X &amp;\longrightarrow X\\
    (\varphi, x) &amp;\longmapsto \varphi(x)
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

This is a group action since for all &lt;math&gt;\varphi,\psi\in G&lt;/math&gt;, 

&lt;math&gt;\varphi\cdot(\psi\cdot x)=\varphi(\psi(x))=(\varphi\circ\psi)(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; denotes the group action, and the [[identity element]] of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; (which is the [[identity function]] on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;) sends points to themselves. If this action is [[transitive group action|transitive]], then the space is said to be [[Homogeneous space|homogeneous]].

===Topology===
{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}
As with other sets of maps between topological spaces, the homeomorphism group can be given a topology, such as the [[compact-open topology]].
In the case of regular, locally compact spaces the group multiplication is then continuous.

If the space is compact and Hausdorff, the inversion is continuous as well and &lt;math&gt;Homeo(X)&lt;/math&gt; becomes a [[topological group]] as one can easily show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/173093/homeomorphisms-of-x-form-a-topological-group|title=Homeomorphisms of X form a topological group|publisher=|accessdate=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
If &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is Hausdorff, locally compact  and locally connected this holds as well.&lt;ref name="vu.nl"&gt;http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dijkstra/research/papers/2005compactopen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
However there are locally compact separable metric spaces for which the inversion map is not continuous and &lt;math&gt;Homeo(X)&lt;/math&gt; therefore not a topological group.&lt;ref name="vu.nl"/&gt;

In the category of topological spaces with homeomorphisms, object groups are exactly homeomorphism groups.

==Mapping class group==
{{Main|Mapping class group}}
In [[geometric topology]] especially, one considers the [[quotient group]] obtained by quotienting out by [[Homotopy#Isotopy|isotopy]], called the [[mapping class group]]:
:&lt;math&gt;{\rm MCG}(X) = {\rm Homeo}(X) / {\rm Homeo}_0(X)&lt;/math&gt;
The MCG can also be interpreted as the 0th [[homotopy group]], &lt;math&gt;{\rm MCG}(X) = \pi_0({\rm Homeo}(X))&lt;/math&gt;.
This yields the [[short exact sequence]]:
:&lt;math&gt;1 \rightarrow {\rm Homeo}_0(X) \rightarrow {\rm Homeo}(X) \rightarrow {\rm MCG}(X) \rightarrow 1.&lt;/math&gt;

In some applications, particularly surfaces, the homeomorphism group is studied via this short exact sequence, and by first studying the mapping class group and group of isotopically trivial homeomorphisms, and then (at times) the extension.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8778">The '''hypothetico-deductive model''' or  '''method''' is a proposed description of [[scientific method]]. According to it, [[scientific inquiry]] proceeds by formulating a [[hypothesis]] in a form that can be [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]], using a test on observable data where the outcome is not yet known. A test outcome that could have and does run contrary to predictions of the hypothesis is taken as a falsification of the hypothesis.  A test outcome that could have, but does not run contrary to the hypothesis corroborates the theory.  It is then proposed to compare the explanatory value of competing hypotheses by testing how stringently they are corroborated by their predictions.

==Example==
{{main|Scientific method}}
One example of an algorithmic statement of the hypothetico-deductive method is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godfrey-Smith (2003) ''Theory and Reality'', p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;div style="padding-left:1.25em;text-indent:-1.25em"&gt;
:'''''1'''''. Use your experience: Consider the problem and try to make sense of it. Gather data and look for previous explanations. If this is a new problem to you, then move to step&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''.
:'''''2'''''. Form a conjecture ([[hypothesis]]): When nothing else is yet known, try to state an explanation, to someone else, or to your notebook.
:'''''3'''''. Deduce predictions from the hypothesis: if you assume&amp;nbsp;'''''2''''' is true, what consequences follow?
:'''''4'''''. Test (or [[experiment]]): Look for evidence (observations) that conflict with these predictions in order to disprove&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''. It is a logical error to seek&amp;nbsp;'''''3''''' directly as proof of&amp;nbsp;'''''2'''''. This [[formal fallacy]] is called ''[[affirming the consequent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taleb|2007}} e.g., p. 58, devotes his chapter 5 to ''the error of confirmation''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

One possible sequence in this model would be '''''1''''', '''''2''''', '''''3''''', '''''4'''''. If the outcome of '''''4''''' holds, and '''''3''''' is not yet disproven, you may continue with '''''3''''', '''''4''''', '''''1''''', and so forth; but if the outcome of '''''4''''' shows '''''3''''' to be false, you will have to go back to '''''2''''' and try to invent a '''''new 2''''', deduce a '''''new 3''''', look for '''''4''''', and so forth.

Note that this method can never absolutely '''verify''' (prove the truth of) '''''2'''''. It can only '''[[Falsifiability|falsify]]''' '''''2'''''.&lt;ref&gt;"I believe that we do not know anything for certain, but everything probably." —[[Christiaan Huygens]], Letter to Pierre Perrault, 'Sur la préface de M. Perrault de son traité del'Origine des fontaines' [1763], ''Oeuvres Complétes de Christiaan Huygens'' (1897), Vol. '''7''', 298. Quoted in Jacques Roger, ''The Life Sciences in Eighteenth-Century French Thought'', ed. Keith R. Benson and trans. Robert Ellrich (1997), 163. Quotation selected by {{harvnb|Bynum|Porter|2005|p=317}} Huygens 317#4.&lt;/ref&gt; (This is what Einstein meant when he said, "No amount of experimentation can ever prove me right; a single experiment can prove me wrong."&lt;ref&gt;As noted by Alice Calaprice (ed. 2005) ''The New Quotable Einstein'' Princeton University Press and Hebrew University of Jerusalem, {{ISBN|0-691-12074-9}} p. 291. Calaprice denotes this not as an exact quotation, but as a paraphrase of a translation of A. Einstein's "Induction and Deduction". ''Collected Papers of Albert Einstein'' '''7''' Document 28. Volume 7 is ''The Berlin Years: Writings, 1918-1921''. A. Einstein; M. Janssen, R. Schulmann, et al., eds.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==Discussion==
Additionally, as pointed out by [[Carl Hempel]] (1905–1997), this simple view of the scientific method is incomplete; a conjecture can also incorporate probabilities, e.g., the drug is effective about 70% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Murzi, Mauro (2001, 2008), "[http://www.iep.utm.edu/h/hempel.htm Carl Gustav Hempel (1905—1997)]", ''Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Murzi used the term relative frequency rather than probability.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tests, in this case, must be repeated to substantiate the conjecture (in particular, the probabilities). In this and other cases, we can quantify a probability for our confidence in the conjecture itself and then apply a [[Bayesian analysis]], with each experimental result shifting the probability either up or down. [[Bayes' theorem]] shows that the probability will never reach exactly 0 or 100% (no absolute certainty in either direction), but it can still get very close to either extreme. See also [[confirmation holism]].

Qualification of corroborating evidence is sometimes raised as philosophically problematic. The [[raven paradox]] is a famous example. The hypothesis that 'all ravens are black' would appear to be corroborated by observations of only black ravens. However, 'all ravens are black' is [[Logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to 'all non-black things are non-ravens' (this is the [[contraposition]] form of the original implication). 'This is a green tree' is an observation of a non-black thing that is a non-raven and therefore corroborates 'all non-black things are non-ravens'. It appears to follow that the observation 'this is a green tree' is corroborating evidence for the hypothesis 'all ravens are black'.  Attempted resolutions may distinguish:
* non-falsifying observations as to strong, moderate, or weak corroborations
* investigations that do or do not provide a potentially falsifying test of the hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[[John N.W. Watkins]] (1984), ''Science and Skepticism'', p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence contrary to a hypothesis is itself philosophically problematic. Such evidence is called a [[falsifiability|falsification]] of the hypothesis. However, under the theory of [[confirmation holism]] it is always possible to save a given hypothesis from falsification. This is so because any falsifying observation is embedded in a theoretical background, which can be modified in order to save the hypothesis.  Popper acknowledged this but maintained that a critical approach respecting methodological rules that avoided such ''immunizing stratagems'' is conducive to the progress of science.&lt;ref&gt;Karl R. Popper (1979, Rev. ed.), ''Objective Knowledge'', pp. 30, 360.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist [[Sean M. Carroll|Sean Carroll]] claims the model ignores [[underdetermination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2013/07/03/what-is-science/ |author=Sean Carroll |title=What is Science?}}&lt;/ref&gt;


'''The hypothetico-deductive model (or approach) versus other research models'''

The hypothetico-deductive approach contrasts with other research models such as the inductive approach or grounded theory. In the data percolation methodology, 
the hypothetico-deductive approach is included in a paradigm of pragmatism by which four types of relations between the variables can exist: descriptive, of influence, longitudinal or causal. The variables are classified in two groups, structural and functional, a classification that drives the formulation of hypotheses and the statistical tests to be performed on the data so as to increase the efficiency of the research. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Mesly |first= Olivier | date= 2015 |title= Creating Models in Psychological Research | location= United States | publisher= Springer Psychology  |pages= 126  |ISBN = 978-3-319-15752-8}}

Often, informal, [[spoken language]], "everyday language" is less precise than any more [[formal language|formal]]  or academic languages.

Language might be said to be imprecise because it exhibits one or more of the following features:
* [[ambiguity]] – when a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs.
* [[vagueness]] – when borderline cases interfere with an interpretation
* [[equivocation]] – the misleading use of a term with more than one meaning or sense (by glossing over which meaning is intended at a particular time)
* [[accent (fallacy)|accent]] – when the use of bold or italics causes confusion over the meaning of a statement
* [[Syntactic ambiguity|amphiboly]] – when a sentence may be interpreted in more than one way due to ambiguous sentence structure.

While '''imprecise language''' is not desirable in various scientific fields, it may be helpful, illustrative or discussion-stimulative in other contexts. Imprecision in a discourse may or may not be the intention of the author(s) or speaker(s). The role of imprecision may depend on audience, end goal, extended context and subject matter. Relevant players and real stakes will also bear on [[truth-grounds]] of statements.

'''Józef Klemens Piłsudski'''{{Ref label|a|a|none}}, &lt;small&gt;[[Order of the Tower and Sword|GCTE]]&lt;/small&gt; ({{IPA-pl|ˈjuzɛf ˈklɛmɛns pʲiwˈsutskʲi|lang|Pl-Józef_Piłsudski.ogg}}; 5 December 1867&amp;nbsp;– 12 May 1935) was a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Politician|statesman]] who served as the [[Naczelnik państwa|Chief of State]] (1918–22) and [[Marshal of Poland|First Marshal]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (from 1920). He was considered the ''[[de facto]]'' leader (1926–35) of the Second Polish Republic as the [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Minister of Military Affairs]]. From World War I he had great power in [[Politics of Poland|Polish politics]] and was a distinguished figure on the international scene.{{sfn|Plach|2006|p=14}} He is viewed as a father of the Second Polish Republic re-established in 1918, 123 years after the 1795 [[Partitions of Poland]] by [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]], [[Prussia]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]].{{r|DroSzwa95_911|Lieven94_159}}{{sfn|Lerski|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/?id=QTUTqE2difgC&amp;pg=PA441 p. 441]}}{{sfn|Held|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5O5NkwX-NnYC&amp;pg=PA249 p. 249]}}

Deeming himself a descendant of the culture and traditions of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]],{{r|Davies05_10}} Piłsudski believed in a multi-ethnic Poland—"a home of nations" including indigenous ethnic and religious minorities that he hoped would establish a robust union with the independent states of [[Lithuania]] and [[Ukraine]].{{r|Davies05_10}} His principal political antagonist, [[Roman Dmowski]], leader of the [[National Democrats (Poland)|National Democrat party]], by contrast, called for a Poland limited to the pre-Partitions [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Polish Crown]] and based mainly on a homogeneous ethnically Polish population and [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] identity.

Early in his political career, Piłsudski became a leader of the [[Polish Socialist Party]].  Concluding that Poland's independence would have to be won  militarily, he formed the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]]. In 1914 he correctly predicted the outbreak of a major war, the [[Russian Empire]]'s defeat by the [[Central Powers]], and the Central Powers' defeat by the [[Allies of World War I|western Allies]].{{r|Roos+Rothschild}} When [[World War I]] began in 1914, Piłsudski's Legions fought alongside [[Austria-Hungary]] against Russia. In 1917, with [[Imperial Russia|Imperalist Russia]] faring poorly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers and was imprisoned in [[Magdeburg]] by the Germans.

From November 1918, when Poland regained its independence, until 1922, Piłsudski was Poland's [[Naczelnik Państwa|Chief of State]]. In 1919–21 he commanded Polish forces in six border wars that re-defined the country's borders.  His forces seemed on the verge of defeat in the [[Polish–Soviet War]] when, in the August 1920 [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], they threw back the invading Soviet Russian forces.  In 1923, with the government dominated by his opponents, in particular the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]], Piłsudski retired from active politics. Three years later he returned to power in the [[May Coup (Poland)|May 1926 ''coup d'état'']] and became Poland's [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]]. From then on until his death in 1935, he concerned himself primarily with military and foreign affairs.

In international affairs, Piłsudski pursued two complementary strategies meant to secure Poland's independence and to enhance her national security: "[[Prometheism]]", aimed at achieving the disintegration of [[Imperial Russia|Imperialist Russia]] and later the [[Soviet Union]] into their constituent nations; and the creation of an [[Intermarium]] federation of [[Central and Eastern Europe]]an states lying between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea]]s; serving as a bridge between Germany and Russia. The proposed Intermarium's central purpose was to secure its peoples against [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an [[imperialism]]s.{{sfn|Davies|2005|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&amp;pg=PA55 55]}}

Historian [[Piotr S. Wandycz|Piotr Wandycz]] characterizes Piłsudski as "an ardent Polish patriot who on occasion would castigate the Poles for their stupidity, cowardice, or servility. He described himself as a [[Polish-Lithuanian identity|Polish-Lithuanian]], and was stubborn and reserved, loath to show his emotions."{{sfn|Wandycz|1990|p=452}} Though some aspects of Piłsudski's administration remain controversial, he is highly esteemed in Polish memory and is regarded, together with his chief antagonist [[Roman Dmowski]], as a founder of the modern independent Poland.

==Early life==
[[File:Piludski w szkole.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Piłsudski as a schoolboy]]
He was born 5 December 1867 to the [[szlachta|noble]] [[Piłsudski family|family Piłsudski]], at their manor named ''Zułów'', near the village of Zułowo  (now [[Zalavas]], [[Švenčionys district municipality]],{{sfn|Jędrzejewicz|1990|p=3}} [[Lithuania]]),{{sfn|Hetherington|2012|p=92}} in the Russian Empire since 1795 on the territory of the former [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The estate was part of the dowry brought by his mother, Maria, a member of the wealthy Billewicz family.{{sfn|Hetherington|2012|p=95}} The Piłsudski family, although pauperized,{{r|POleksa04}} cherished Polish patriotic traditions{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_13-5}} and has been characterized either as Polish{{r|Lerski96_439|Davies05_40}} or as [[Polonized]]-[[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]].{{r|POleksa04|BidJef98_186}}{{Ref label|b|b|none}} Józef was the second son born to the family.
Józef, when he attended the Russian ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' in ''Wilno'' (now [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]), was not an especially diligent student.{{sfn|Roshwald|2001|p=36}} One of the younger Polish students at this gymnasium was the future Russian communist leader [[Felix Dzerzhinsky|Feliks Dzierżyński]], who later would become Piłsudski's arch-enemy.{{sfn|Blobaum|1984|p=30}} Along with his brothers [[Bronisław Piłsudski|Bronisław]], [[Adam Piłsudski|Adam]] and [[Jan Piłsudski|Jan]], Józef was introduced by his mother Maria, ''née'' Billewicz, to Polish history and literature, which were suppressed by the Russian authorities.{{r|McM03_208}} His father, likewise named Józef, had fought in the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] against Russian rule of Poland.{{r|PolandGov}}

[[File:Jozef Pilsudski in 1899.jpg|thumb|125px|upright|Piłsudski in 1899]]
The family resented the Russian government's [[Russification]] policies. Young Józef profoundly disliked having to attend [[Russian Orthodox Church]] service{{r|McM03_208}} and left school with an aversion not only for the [[Russian Tsar]] and the Russian Empire, but for the culture, which he knew well.{{r|POleksa04}}

In 1885 Piłsudski started [[medical school|medical studies]] at [[Kharkov University]] (now [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]]), where he became involved with ''[[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]]'', part of the Russian ''[[Narodnik]]i'' revolutionary movement.{{r|PWN}} In 1886, he was suspended for participating in student demonstrations.{{r|PolandGov}} He was rejected by the [[University of Dorpat]] (now [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]]), whose authorities had been informed of his political affiliation.{{r|PolandGov}} On 22 March 1887, he was arrested by Tsarist authorities on a charge of plotting with [[Vilnius]] socialists to assassinate [[Tsar]] [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. In fact, Piłsudski's main connection to the plot was the involvement of his elder brother [[Bronisław Piłsudski|Bronisław]], who was sentenced to fifteen years of [[hard labor]] (''[[katorga]]'') in eastern Siberia.{{r|ICRAP|Urbank97_50}}

Józef received a milder sentence: five years' exile in [[Siberia]], first at [[Kirensk]] on the [[Lena River]], then at [[Tunka]].{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_50}} While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Piłsudski was held for several weeks at a prison in [[Irkutsk]].{{r|LandauDunlop30_30}} There, he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt. After one of the inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance;{{r|Urbank97_62-6}} Piłsudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident.{{r|Urbank97_62-6}} For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment.{{r|Urbank97_68-9}} He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and to health problems that would plague him throughout life.{{r|Urbank97_68-9}}

During his years of exile in Siberia, Piłsudski met many ''[[Sybiraks]]'', including [[Bronisław Szwarce]], who had almost become a leader of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]].{{r|Urbank97_74–7}} He was allowed to work in an occupation of his own choosing, and earned his living tutoring local children in mathematics and foreign languages{{r|POleksa04}} (he knew French, German and Lithuanian in addition to Russian and his native Polish; he would later learn English).{{sfn|Jędrzejewicz|Cisek|1994|p=13}} Local officials decided that as a Polish noble he was not entitled to the 10-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] pension received by most other exiles.{{r|Urbank97_71}}

In 1892 Piłsudski returned from exile and settled in Adomavas Manor near Teneniai (now in [[Šilalė district]]). In 1893 he joined the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (''PPS''){{r|PolandGov}} and helped organize its Lithuanian branch.{{r|Urbank97_88}} Initially he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible [[proletarian internationalism|internationalism]] he remained a Polish nationalist.{{r|McM03_209}} In 1894, as its [[chief editor]], he began publishing an [[bibuła|underground]] socialist newspaper, ''[[Robotnik (1894–1939)|Robotnik]]'' (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers, and, initially, a [[typesetter]].{{r|PolandGov|PWN|Urbank97_93}}{{sfn|Piłsudski|1989|p=12}} In 1895, he became a PPS leader and took the position that doctrinal issues were of minor importance and that socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, since that combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.{{r|PWN}}

On 15 July 1899, while an underground organizer, Piłsudski married a fellow socialist organizer, [[Maria Piłsudska|Maria Juszkiewiczowa, ''née'' Koplewska]].{{r|Alabrud99_99|Garlicki195_63|Pobog-Ma90_7}} According to his chief biographer, Wacław Jędrzejewicz, the marriage was less romantic than pragmatic in nature. Both were very involved in the socialist and independence movements. The printing press of "Robotnik" was in their apartment first in [[Vilnius|Wilno]], then in [[Łódź]]. Having a pretext of regular family life made them less subject to suspicion. Russian law also protected a wife from prosecution for the illegal activities of her husband.{{sfn|Jędrzejewicz|1990|loc=pp. 27-8 (1982 ed.)}} The marriage deteriorated when, several years later, Piłsudski began an affair with a younger socialist,{{r|McM03_209}} [[Aleksandra Piłsudska|Aleksandra Szczerbińska]]. Maria died in 1921, and in October that year Piłsudski married Aleksandra. By then the couple had two daughters, [[Wanda Piłsudska|Wanda]] and [[Jadwiga Piłsudska|Jadwiga]].

[[File:Lingwood 1898.jpg|thumb|left|"Lingwood", [[Leytonstone]], where Piłsudski stayed in 1900]]
In February 1900, after Russian authorities found ''Robotnik'''s underground printing press in [[Łódź]], Piłsudski was imprisoned at the [[Warsaw Citadel]]. But, after feigning mental illness in May 1901, he managed to escape from a mental hospital at [[Saint Petersburg]] with the help of a Polish physician, [[Władysław Mazurkiewicz (physician)|Władysław Mazurkiewicz]], and others, fleeing to [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]] and thence to [[Leytonstone]] in London where he stayed with [[Leon Wasilewski]] and his family.{{r|PolandGov}}

At the time, when almost all parties in Russian Poland and Lithuania took a conciliatory position toward the Russian Empire and aimed at negotiating within it a limited autonomy for Poland, Piłsudski's PPS was the only political force that was prepared to fight the Empire for Polish independence and to resort to violence in order to achieve that goal.{{r|POleksa04}}

On the outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905), in the summer of 1904, Piłsudski traveled to [[Tokyo]], Japan, where he tried unsuccessfully to obtain that country's assistance for an uprising in Poland. He offered to supply Japan with [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] in support of its war with Russia, and proposed the creation of a Polish Legion from Poles,{{r|Urbank97_109–11}} conscripted into the Russian Army, who had been captured by Japan. He also suggested a [[Prometheism#Sources of Prometheism|"Promethean" project]] directed at breaking up the Russian Empire, a goal that he later continued to pursue.{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|p=56}} Meeting with [[Yamagata Aritomo]], he suggested that starting a [[guerrilla war]] in Poland would distract Russia and asked for Japan to supply him with weapons. Although the Japanese diplomat [[Hayashi Tadasu]] supported the plan, the Japanese government, including Yamagata, was more skeptical.{{sfn|Kowner|2006|p=285}}

Piłsudski's arch-rival [[Roman Dmowski]] travelled to Japan, where he argued against Piłsudski's plan, endeavoring to discourage the Japanese government from supporting a Polish revolution, which Dmowski felt would then be doomed to failure.{{r|Urbank97_109–11|Zamo87_330}} Dmowski, himself a Polish patriot, would remain Piłsudski's political archenemy to the end of Piłsudski's life.{{r|Zamo87_332}} In the end, the Japanese offered Piłsudski much less than he had hoped for; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and its combat organisation, and the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_109–11}}

In the fall of 1904, Piłsudski formed a paramilitary unit (the [[Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party]], or ''bojówki'') aiming to create an armed [[resistance movement]] against the Russian authorities.{{r|Zamo87_330}} The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in [[Warsaw]]; on 28 October 1904, Russian [[Cossack]] [[cavalry]] attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Piłsudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military.{{r|Zamo87_330|Urbank97_113–6}} Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.{{r|Urbank97_117–8}}

During the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Piłsudski played a leading role in events in [[Congress Poland]]. In early 1905 he ordered the PPS to launch a general strike there; it involved some 400,000 workers and lasted two months until it was broken by the Russian authorities.{{r|Zamo87_330}} In June 1905, Piłsudski sent paramilitary aid to an uprising in [[Łódź]]. During the "[[Łódź insurrection (1905)|June Days]]", as the Łódź uprising came to be known, armed clashes broke out between Piłsudski's paramilitaries and gunmen loyal to Dmowski and his [[National Democracy|National Democrats]].{{r|Zamo87_330}} On 22 December 1905, Piłsudski called for all Polish workers to rise up; the call went largely unheeded.{{r|Zamo87_330}}

Unlike the National Democrats, Piłsudski instructed the PPS to boycott the elections to the [[First Duma]].{{r|Zamo87_330}} The decision and his resolve to try to win Polish independence through uprisings caused tensions within the PPS, and in November 1906, the party fractured over Piłsudski's leadership.{{r|Zamo87_332}} His faction came to be called the "Old Faction" or "Revolutionary Faction" ("''Starzy''" or "''[[Polish Socialist Party – Revolutionary Faction|Frakcja Rewolucyjna]]''"), while their opponents were known as the "Young Faction", "Moderate Faction" or "Left Wing" ("''Młodzi''", "''Frakcja Umiarkowana''", "''[[Polish Socialist Party – Left|Lewica]]''"). The "Young" sympathized with the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|Social Democrats of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]] and believed that priority should be given to co-operation with Russian revolutionaries in toppling the tsarist regime and creating a socialist [[utopia]] that would facilitate negotiations for independence.{{r|PWN}}

Piłsudski and his supporters in the Revolutionary Faction continued to plot a revolution against Tsarist Russia that would secure Polish independence.{{r|PolandGov}} By 1909, his faction would again be the majority in the PPS, and Piłsudski would remain one of the most important PPS leaders until the outbreak of the First World War.{{r|Urbank97_131}}

Piłsudski anticipated a coming European war{{r|Roos+Rothschild}} and the need to organize the nucleus of a future Polish Army, which could help win Poland's independence from the three empires that had partitioned it out of political existence in the late 18th century. In 1906 Piłsudski, with the connivance of the Austrian authorities, founded a military school in [[Kraków]] for the training of paramilitary units.{{r|Zamo87_332}} In 1906 alone, the 800-strong paramilitaries, operating in five-man teams in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; in subsequent years, the number of their casualties declined, and the paramilitaries' numbers increased to some 2,000 in 1908.{{r|Zamo87_332|Urbank97_121–2}}

The paramilitaries also held up Russian currency transports that were leaving Polish territories. On the night of 26/27 September 1908, they robbed a Russian mail train that was carrying tax revenues from Warsaw to Saint Petersburg.{{r|Zamo87_332}} Piłsudski, who took part in this [[Bezdany raid]] near Vilnius, used the funds thus "expropriated" to finance his secret military organization.{{r|EBritannica_JP}} The take from that single raid (200,812 rubles) was a fortune for the time and equaled the paramilitaries' entire takes of the two preceding years.{{r|Urbank97_121–2}}

[[File:Józef Piłsudski with Supreme Command of Polish Military Organisation in 1917.PNG|266px|thumb|right|Józef Piłsudski with Supreme Command of [[Polish Military Organisation]] in 1917]]

In 1908, Piłsudski transformed his paramilitary units into an "Association for Active Struggle" (''[[Związek Walki Czynnej]]'', or ''ZWC''), headed by three of his associates, [[Władysław Sikorski]], [[Marian Kukiel]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]].{{r|Zamo87_332}} One of the ''ZWC'''s main purposes was to train officers and [[noncommissioned officer]]s for a future Polish Army.{{r|PWN}}

In 1910, two legal paramilitary organizations were created in the Austrian zone of Poland, one in Lwów (now [[Lviv]], Ukraine) and one in [[Kraków]], to conduct training in [[military science]]. With the permission of the Austrian authorities, Piłsudski founded a series of "sporting clubs", then the [[Związek Strzelecki|Riflemen's Association]], which served as cover to train a Polish military force. In 1912 Piłsudski (using the ''[[nom de guerre]]'', "''Mieczysław''") became commander-in-chief of a Riflemen's Association (''Związek Strzelecki'') that grew by 1914 to 12,000 men.{{r|PolandGov|Zamo87_332}} In 1914, Piłsudski declared, "Only the sword now carries any weight in the balance for the destiny of a nation."{{r|Zamo87_332}}

==World War I==
[[File:Jozef Pilsudski3.jpg|thumb|right|Piłsudski in uniform]]
{{Main|World War I}}
At a meeting in Paris in 1914, Piłsudski presciently declared that in the impending war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by [[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the United States.{{r|Roos+Rothschild}} By contrast, [[Roman Dmowski]], Piłsudski's rival, believed that the best way to achieve a unified and independent Poland was to support the [[Triple Entente]] against the Central Powers.{{r|Zamo87_333}}
[[File:Jozef  Pilsudski2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Piłsudski in World War I (1914)]]
At the outbreak of the war on 3 August in [[Kraków]], Piłsudski formed a small [[En cadre|cadre]] military unit, the [[First Cadre Company]], from members of the [[Riflemen's Association]] and [[Polish Rifle Squads]].{{r|Urbank97_171–2}} That same day, [[The Seven Lancers of Belina|a cavalry unit]] under [[Władysław Belina-Prażmowski]] was sent to [[reconnoitre]] across the Russian border even before the official [[declaration of war]] between Austria-Hungary and Russia, which ensued on 6 August.{{r|Urbank97_168}}

Piłsudski's strategy was to send his forces north across the border into [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]] into an area that the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Russian Army]] had evacuated in the hope of breaking through to Warsaw and sparking a national uprising.{{r|PWN|Cienciala02}} Using his limited forces in those early days, he backed his orders with the sanction of a fictitious "National Government in Warsaw",{{r|Urbank97_174–5}} and he bent and stretched Austrian orders to the utmost, taking initiatives, moving forward and establishing Polish institutions in liberated towns while the Austrians saw his forces as good only for scouting or for supporting main Austrian formations.{{r|Urbank97_178–9}} On 12 August 1914, Piłsudski's forces took the town of [[Kielce]], of [[Kielce Governorate]], but Piłsudski found the populace less supportive than he had expected.{{r|Urbank97_170–1_180–2}}

Soon afterward he officially established the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]], taking personal command of their [[I Brigade of the Polish Legions|First Brigade]],{{r|PolandGov}} which he would lead successfully into several victorious battles.{{r|PWN}} He also secretly informed the British government in the fall of 1914 that his Legions would never fight France or Britain, only Russia.{{r|Cienciala02}}
[[File:Pilsudski and officers 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Piłsudski and his officers, 1915]]
Piłsudski decreed that Legions' personnel were to be addressed by the [[French Revolution]]-inspired "Citizen" (''Obywatel''), and he was referred to as "the Commandant" ("''Komendant''").{{r|Zamo87_333}} Piłsudski enjoyed extreme respect and loyalty from his men,{{r|Zamo87_333}} which would remain for years to come. The Polish Legions fought against Russia, at the side of the Central Powers, until 1917.

Soon after forming the Legions, also in 1914, Piłsudski set up another organization, the [[Polish Military Organisation]] (''Polska Organizacja Wojskowa''), which served as a precursor [[Polish intelligence]] agency and was designed to perform espionage and sabotage missions.{{r|PWN|Cienciala02}}
[[File:Jacek Malczewski, Portret brygadiera Józefa Piłsudskiego.jpg|thumb|Piłsudski. Painting by [[Jacek Malczewski]], 1916]]
In mid-1916, after the [[Battle of Kostiuchnówka]] (4–6 July 1916), in which the Polish Legions delayed a Russian offensive at a cost of over 2,000 casualties,{{sfn|Rąkowski|2005|pp=109-11}} Piłsudski demanded for the Central Powers to issue a guarantee of independence for Poland. He backed that demand with his own proffered [[resignation]] and that of many of the Legions' officers.{{r|Urbank97_251–2}} On 5 November 1916 the Central Powers proclaimed the "independence" of Poland, hoping to increase the number of Polish troops that could be sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] against Russia, thereby relieving German forces to bolster the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].{{r|EBritannica_JP|Biskupski2000}}

Piłsudski agreed to serve in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1916–1918)|Regency Kingdom of Poland]], created by the Central Powers, and acted as [[minister of war]] in the newly formed [[Polish Regency government]]; as such, he was responsible for the [[Polnische Wehrmacht]].{{r|Zamo87_333}} After the [[February Revolution|Russian Revolution in early 1917]], and in view of the worsening situation of the Central Powers, Piłsudski took an increasingly uncompromising stance, insisting that his men no longer be treated as "German [[colonial troops]]" and but be used to fight only Russia. Anticipating the Central Powers' defeat in the war, he did not wish to be allied with the losing side.{{r|Rothschild90_45|Urbank97_253}} In the aftermath of a July 1917 "[[Oath Crisis]]" when Piłsudski forbade Polish soldiers to swear a [[loyalty oath]] to the Central Powers, he was arrested and imprisoned at [[Magdeburg]]; the Polish units were disbanded and the men were incorporated into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]{{r|PolandGov|Cienciala02}} while the [[Polish Military Organization]] began attacking German targets.{{r|PWN}} Piłsudski's arrest greatly enhanced his reputation among Poles, many of whom began to see him as the most determined Polish leader, who was willing to take on  all the partitioning powers.{{r|PWN}}

On 8 November 1918, three days before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|Armistice]], Piłsudski and his colleague, Colonel [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]], were released by the Germans from Magdeburg and soon, like [[Vladimir Lenin]] before them, placed on a private train, bound for their national capital, as the collapsing Germans hoped that Piłsudski would create a force that was friendly to them.{{r|Cienciala02}}

==Rebuilding Poland==

[[File:Polski automobil pancerny z obrony Lwowa 1918-19.JPG|thumb|''Piłsudski'' improvised armored car, 1919, named after Piłsudski]]
On 11 November 1918 in Warsaw, Piłsudski was appointed [[Commander in Chief]] of Polish forces by the [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] and was entrusted with creating a national government for the newly independent country. On that very day, which would become [[Poland's Independence Day]], he proclaimed an independent Polish state.{{r|Cienciala02}}

That week too, Piłsudski also negotiated the evacuation of the German garrison from Warsaw and of other German troops from the "[[Ober Ost]]" authority. Over 55,000 Germans would peacefully depart Poland, leaving their weapons to the Poles. In coming months, over 400,000 total would depart Polish territories.{{r|Cienciala02|Urbank97_256_277–8}}

On 14 November 1918, Piłsudski was asked to supervise provisionally the running of the country. On 22 November he officially received, from the new government of [[Jędrzej Moraczewski]], the title of Provisional Chief of State (''Naczelnik Państwa'') of renascent Poland.{{r|PolandGov}}

Various Polish military organizations and provisional governments (the [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] in Warsaw; [[Ignacy Daszyński]]'s government in [[Lublin]]; and the [[Polish Liquidation Committee]] in [[Kraków]]) bowed to Piłsudski, who set about forming a new coalition government. It was predominantly socialist and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the Polish Socialist Party, such as the [[eight-hour day]], free school education and [[women's suffrage]], to avoid major unrest.

However, Piłsudski believed that as head of state, he must be above partisan politics.{{r|PWN|Cienciala02}} The day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him socialist-style as "[[Comrade]]" ("''Towarzysz''") and asked for his support for their revolutionary policies; he refused it and answered: "Comrades, I took the red [[tram]] of socialism to the stop called Independence, and that's where I got off. You may keep on to the final stop if you wish, but from now on let's address each other as '[[Slavic honorifics|Mister']] [rather than continue using the socialist term of address, 'Comrade']!"{{r|PolandGov}} He declined to support any party and did not form any political organization of his own; instead, he advocated creating a coalition government.{{r|PWN|Suleja04_202}} He also set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian and Austrian armies.

In the days immediately after the war, Piłsudski attempted to build a government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%.{{r|McM03_210}} A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported: "I have nowhere seen anything like the evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn."{{r|McM03_210}}

In addition, the country had to unify the disparate systems of law, economics, and [[administration (government)|administration]] in the former German, Austrian, and Russian sectors of Poland. There were nine legal systems, five currencies, and 66 types of rail systems (with 165 models of locomotives), which all had to be consolidated on an expedited basis.{{r|McM03_210}}
[[File:Warszawaid4.jpg|thumb|Statue of Piłsudski before Warsaw's [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Piłsudski's official residence during his years in power]]

[[Wacław Jędrzejewicz]], in ''Piłsudski: A Life for Poland'', described Piłsudski as very deliberate in his decision-making:  Piłsudski collected all available pertinent information, then took his time weighing it before arriving at a final decision.  He drove himself hard, working all day and all night.{{r|McM03_210}} He maintained a simple lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant.{{r|McM03_210}} Though he was popular with much of the Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work) and as a man who distrusted almost everyone led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.{{r|McM03_209}}

Piłsudski and the first Polish government were distrusted in the West because he had co-operated with the Central Powers in 1914 to 1917 and because the governments of Daszyński and Jędrzej Moraczewski were primarily socialist.{{r|Cienciala02}} It was not until January 1919, when the world-famous pianist and composer [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] became [[Prime Minister of Poland]] and foreign minister of a new government, that it was recognized in the West.{{r|Cienciala02}}

That still left two separate governments claiming to be Poland's legitimate government: Piłsudski's in Warsaw and Dmowski's in Paris.{{r|McM03_210}} To ensure that Poland had a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Piłsudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Piłsudski acting as Provisional Chief of State and [[Commander-in-Chief]] while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].{{r|McM03_213-4}} Articles 87–93 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]{{r|VersaillesTreaty1919_87-93}} and the [[Little Treaty of Versailles]], signed on 28 June 1919, formally established Poland as an independent and sovereign state in the international arena.{{r|Grant99_114}}

[[File:PL Turek Pilsudski Monument 11.jpg|thumb|[[Józef Piłsudski monument, Turek|Piłsudski monument]], [[Turek]] (designed in 1936)]]
Piłsudski often clashed with Dmowski for viewing the Poles as the dominant nationality in renascent Poland, and attempting to send the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]] to Poland through Danzig, Germany (now [[Gdańsk]], Poland).{{r|McM03_211-214|Boemeke98_314}} On 5 January 1919, some of Dmowski's supporters ([[Marian Januszajtis-Żegota]] and [[Eustachy Sapieha]]) attempted [[Polish Coup (1919)|a coup]] against Piłsudski and Prime Minister Moraczewski, but they failed.{{r|Urbank97_499–501}}

On 20 February 1919, Piłsudski declared that he would return his powers to the newly elected Polish parliament (''[[Sejm]]''). However, the ''Sejm'' reinstated his office in the [[Little Constitution of 1919]]. The word "Provisional" was struck from his title, and Piłsudski would hold the office until 9 December 1922, when [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] was elected as the first [[president of Poland]].{{r|PolandGov}}

Piłsudski's major foreign policy initiative was then a proposed federation (to be called ''"[[Międzymorze]]"'' ([[Polish language|Polish]] for "Between-Seas"), and also known from the [[Latin]] as ''[[Intermarium]]'', stretching from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]]). It was to consist of Poland, the independent [[Baltic states]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]],{{r|Cienciala02}} somewhat in emulation of the [[partitions of Poland|pre-partition]] [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].{{r|PWN}}{{sfn|Jędrzejewicz|1990|p=93}}

Piłsudski's plan met with opposition from most of the prospective member states, which refused to relinquish any of their hard-won independence, as well as from the Allied powers, who thought it to be too bold a change to the existing [[balance of power in international relations|balance-of-power]] structure.{{r|HistNet_01}} According to historian [[George Sanford (scholar)|George Sanford]], it was around 1920 that Piłsudski came to realize the infeasibility of that version of his Intermarium project.{{sfn|Sanford|2002|pp=5-6}}

Instead of a Central and Eastern European alliance, there soon appeared a series of border conflicts, including the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] (1918–19), the [[Polish-Lithuanian War]] (1920, culminating in [[Żeligowski's Mutiny]]), [[Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts]] (beginning in 1918), and most notably the Polish-Soviet War (1919–21).{{r|PWN}} [[Winston Churchill]] commented, "The war of giants has ended, the wars of the pygmies begun."{{r|HydeP01_75}}

==Polish–Soviet War==
[[File:Josef Pilsudski cph.3b35372.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Piłsudski around 1919]]
{{Main|Polish–Soviet War}}
[[File:Jozef Pilsudski w Poznaniu.jpg|thumb|right|Piłsudski in [[Poznań]]]]
In the [[aftermath of World War I]], there was unrest on all Polish borders. Regarding Poland's future frontiers, Piłsudski said, "All that we can gain in the west depends on the Entente—on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany". In the east, "there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far".{{r|McM03_211}} In 1918 in the east, Polish forces clashed with Ukrainian forces in the Polish–Ukrainian War, and Piłsudski's first orders as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, on 12 November 1918, were to provide support for the [[Battle of Lwów (1918)|Polish struggle in Lviv]].{{r|Urbank97_281}}

Piłsudski was aware that the Bolsheviks were no friends of independent Poland and that war with them was inevitable.{{r|Urbank97_2_90}} He viewed their advance west as a major problem, but he also considered the Bolsheviks less dangerous for Poland than their [[White movement|White opponents]].{{r|Kenez99_37}} The "White Russians",  representatives of the old Russian Empire, were willing to accept only limited independence for Poland, probably within borders similar to those of the former [[Congress Poland]], and they clearly objected to Polish control of Ukraine, which was crucial for Piłsudski's Intermarium project.{{r|Urbank97_2_83}}

That was in contrast to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void.{{r|Urbank97_291}} Piłsudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire.{{r|Kenez99_37|Urbank97_2_45}} By ignoring the strong pressures from the [[Entente Cordiale]] to join the attack on Lenin's struggling Bolshevik government, Piłsudski probably saved it in the summer and the fall of 1919.{{r|Urbank97_2_92}}

[[File:Jozef Pilsudski.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In March 1920, Piłsudski was made "First [[Marshal of Poland]]".]]
In the wake of the [[Russian westward offensive of 1918–1919]] and of a series of escalating battles that resulted in the Poles advancing eastward, on 21 April 1920, [[Marshal]] Piłsudski (as his rank had been since March 1920) signed a military alliance (the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]]) with Ukrainian leader [[Symon Petliura]] to conduct joint operations against [[Soviet Russia]]. The goal of the Polish-Ukrainian Treaty was to establish an independent Ukraine and independent Poland in alliance, resembling that once existing within [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]{{r|Davies03_95ff}} In return, Petliura gave up Ukrainian claims to western lands of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] being a historical part of the [[Crown of Poland]] for which he was denounced by Ukrainian nationalist leaders.{{r|Cienciala02}}

The Polish and the Ukrainian Armies, under Piłsudski's command, launched [[1920 Kiev Offensive|a successful offensive]] against the Russian forces in Ukraine. On 7 May 1920, with remarkably little fighting, they captured [[Kiev]].{{r|Davies03_00}}
[[File:Pilsudski and Rydz-Smigly.jpg|thumb|right|Piłsudski ''(left)'' and [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] ''(right)'', 1920, during Polish-Soviet War]]
The Bolshevik leadership framed the Polish actions as an invasion; in response, thousands of officers and deserters joined the Red Army, and thousands of civilians volunteered for war work.{{r|Figes96_699}} The Soviets launched a counter-offensive from [[Belarus]] and [[counterattack]]ed in Ukraine, advancing into Poland{{r|Davies03_00}} in a drive toward Germany to encourage the [[Communist Party of Germany]] in its struggle to take power. Soviet confidence soared.{{r|Lenin1920}} The Soviets announced their plans to invade Western Europe; Soviet communist theoretician [[Nikolai Bukharin]], writing in ''[[Pravda]]'', hoped for the resources to carry the campaign beyond Warsaw "straight to London and Paris".{{r|CohenS80_101}} Soviet commander [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]]'s order of the day for 2 July 1920 read: "To the West! Over the corpse of White Poland lies the road to worldwide conflagration. March upon [[Vilnius]], [[Minsk]], Warsaw!"{{r|Lawrynowicz}} and "onward to Berlin over the corpse of Poland!"{{r|Cienciala02}}

On 1 July 1920, in view of the rapidly advancing Soviet offensive, Poland's parliament, the ''[[Sejm]]'', formed a [[Council for Defense of the Nation]],  chaired by Piłsudski, to provide expeditious decision-making as a temporary supplanting of the fractious [[Sejm]].{{r|Urbank97_341–6_357–8}} The [[National Democracy|National Democrats]], however, contended that the string of Bolshevik victories had been Piłsudski's fault{{r|Suleja04_265}} and demanded that for him to resign; some even accused him of treason.{{r|Urbank97_341–6}} Their 19 July failure to carry a [[vote of no-confidence]] in the council led to Dmowski's withdrawal from it.{{r|Urbank97_341–6}} On 12 August, Piłsudski tendered his resignation to Prime Minister [[Wincenty Witos]], offering to be the scapegoat if the military solution failed, but Witos refused to accept his resignation.{{r|Urbank97_341–6}} The Entente pressured Poland to surrender and enter into negotiations with the Bolsheviks. Piłsudski, however, was a staunch advocate of continuing the fight.{{r|Urbank97_341–6}} As [[Norman Davies]] noted, at that time, especially abroad, "Piłsudski had nothing of his later prestige. As a pre-war revolutionary he led his party to splits and quarrels; as a general in World War I he led his legions to internment and disbanding; as a marshal of the Polish Army he led it to Kiev and Vilnius, both now lost to Poles. He left the Polish Socialist Party and his Austro-German allies; refused to ally himself with Entente. In France and England he was considered a treasonous ally who leads Poland into destruction; in Russia he was seen as a false servant of the allies, who will lead imperialism to ruin. All&amp;nbsp;– from Lenin to [[David Lloyd George|Lloyd George]], from ''[[Pravda]]'' to ''[[Morning Star (UK newspaper)|Morning Star]]''&amp;nbsp;– considered him a military and political failure. In August 1920 all were in agreement that his catastrophic career will be crowned with the fall of Warsaw".{{r|Davies03_225}}
[[File:Piłsudski nad Nidą (22-132).jpg|thumb|left|Piłsudski with his favorite horse, ''[[Kasztanka|Chestnut]]'' (''Kasztanka'')]]
However, over the next few weeks, Poland's risky, unconventional strategy at the August 1920 [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] halted the Soviet advance.{{r|Davies03_00}} The Polish plan was developed by Piłsudski and others, including [[Tadeusz Rozwadowski]].{{r|Erickson01_95}} Later, some supporters of Piłsudski would seek to portray him as the sole author of the Polish strategy, but opponents would seek to minimize his role.{{r|LönnrothEt94_230}} In the West for a long time a myth persisted that it was General [[Maxime Weygand]] of the [[French Military Mission to Poland]] who had saved Poland; modern scholars, however, are in agreement that Weygand's role was minimal, at best.{{r|Cienciala02|LönnrothEt94_230|Szczep}}

Piłsudski's plan called for Polish forces to withdraw across the [[Vistula River]] and to defend the bridgeheads at Warsaw and on the [[Wieprz River]] while some 25% of the available [[division (military)|divisions]] concentrated to the south for a strategic counteroffensive. The plan next required two armies under General [[Józef Haller de Hallenburg|Józef Haller]], facing Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east, to hold their [[trench|entrenched]] positions at all costs. At the same time, an army under General [[Władysław Sikorski]] was to strike north from outside Warsaw, cutting off Soviet forces that sought to envelope the Polish capital from that direction. The most important role, however, was assigned to a relatively small, approximately 20,000-man, newly assembled "Reserve Army" (also known as the "Strike Group", "''Grupa Uderzeniowa''"), comprising the most determined, battle-hardened Polish units that were commanded personally by Piłsudski. Their task was to spearhead a lightning northward offensive, from the Vistula-Wieprz triangle south of Warsaw, through a weak spot that had been identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern [[Front (Soviet Army)|Fronts]]. That offensive would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually, the gap between Sikorski's army and the "Strike Group" would close near the [[East Prussia]]n border, bringing about the destruction of the encircled Soviet forces.{{r|Cisek02_1401|Urbank97_346-441_357-8}}

At the time, Piłsudski's plan was strongly criticized, and only the desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders to go along with it. Though based on reliable intelligence, including [[decryption|decrypted]] Soviet radio communications, the plan was termed "amateurish" by high-ranking army officers and military experts, who were quick to point out Piłsudski's lack of formal military education. When a copy of the plan fell into Soviet hands, Western Front commander [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] thought it to be a ruse and disregarded it.{{sfn|Davies|2003|p=197}} Days later, the Soviets paid dearly for that when, during the Battle of Warsaw, the overconfident [[Red Army]] suffered one of its greatest defeats ever.{{r|Davies03_00|Urbank97_346-441_357-8}}

A National Democrat ''[[Sejm]]'' deputy, [[Stanisław Stroński]], coined the phrase, "Miracle at the Vistula" ("''Cud nad Wisłą''"),{{r|Głos05}} to express his disapproval of Piłsudski's "Ukrainian adventure". Stroński's phrase was adopted as praise for Piłsudski by some patriotically- or piously-minded Poles, who were unaware of Stroński's ironic intent. A junior member of the French military mission, [[Charles de Gaulle]], would later adopt some lessons from the Polish-Soviet War as well as from Piłsudski's career.{{r|Urbank97_346-441_357-8}}{{sfn|Davies|1998|p=935}}

In February 1921, Piłsudski visited Paris, where, in negotiations with French President [[Alexandre Millerand]], he laid the foundations for the [[Franco-Polish Military Alliance]], which would be signed later that year.{{r|Urbank97_484}} The [[Treaty of Riga]], which ended the Polish-Soviet War in March 1921, partitioned [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]] between Poland and Russia. Piłsudski called the treaty an "act of cowardice".{{sfn|Davies|2005|loc=p. 399 (1982 ed. Columbia Univ. Press - ISBN 978-0-231-05352-5)}} The treaty and his secret approval of General [[Lucjan Żeligowski]]'s [[Żeligowski's Mutiny|capture of Vilnius]] from the Lithuanians marked an end to this incarnation of Piłsudski's federalist [[Intermarium]] plan.{{r|PWN}}

On 25 September 1921, when Piłsudski visited Lwów (now [[Lviv]]) for the opening of the first [[Eastern Trade Fair]] (''Targi Wschodnie''), he was the target of an unsuccessful assassination attempt by [[Stepan Fedak]], acting on behalf of Ukrainian-independence organizations, including the [[Ukrainian Military Organization]].{{r|Urbank97_485}}

==Retirement and coup==

After the Polish [[March Constitution (Poland)|Constitution of March 1921]] severely limited the powers of the [[presidency]] intentionally, to prevent a President Piłsudski from waging war. He declined to run for the office.{{r|PWN}} On 9 December 1922, the Polish [[National Assembly of the Republic of Poland|National Assembly]] elected [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] of [[Polish People's Party "Wyzwolenie"]]; his election, opposed by the right-wing parties, caused public unrest.{{r|Urbank97_487-8}} On 14 December at the [[Belweder]] Palace, Piłsudski officially transferred his powers as Chief of State to his friend Narutowicz; the ''Naczelnik'' was replaced by the President.{{r|Urbank97_488|EBritannica_JP}}
[[File:Pilsudski in Bristol.jpg|thumb|right|At Warsaw's [[Hotel Bristol, Warsaw|Hotel Bristol]], 3 July 1923, Piłsudski announced his retirement from active politics.]]
Two days later, on 16 December 1922, Narutowicz was shot dead by a right-wing painter and art critic, [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]], who had originally wanted to kill Piłsudski but had changed his target, influenced by National Democrat anti-Narutowicz propaganda.{{r|Urbank97_489}}

For Piłsudski, that was a major shock, which shook his belief that Poland could function as a democracy{{r|Suleja04_300}} and made him support government by a strong hand.{{sfn|Davies|1986|p=140}} He became [[Chief of the General Staff (Poland)|Chief of the General Staff]] and, together with [[Polish Minister of Military Affairs|Minister of Military Affairs]] [[Władysław Sikorski]], managed to stabilize the situation, quelling unrest with a brief [[state of emergency]].{{r|Urbank97_489–90}}

[[Stanisław Wojciechowski]] of [[Polish People's Party "Piast" (1913–31)|Polish People's Party "Piast"]] (PSL Piast), another of Piłsudski's old colleagues, was elected the new president, and [[Wincenty Witos]], also of PSL Piast, became prime minister. However, the new government, pursuant to the [[Lanckorona Pact]], an alliance among the centrist PSL Piast and the right-wing [[Popular National Union]] and [[Polskie Stronnictwo Chrześcijańskiej Demokracji|Christian Democrat]] parties, contained right-wing enemies of Piłsudski, people whom he held morally responsible for Narutowicz's death and with whom he found it impossible to work.{{r|Urbank97_490–1}} On 30 May 1923, Piłsudski resigned as Chief of the General Staff.
[[File:Dworek w Sulejówku.jpg|thumb|right|Piłsudski in front of his [[Sulejówek]] house, with his former soldiers, before the 1926 coup]]
After General [[Stanisław Szeptycki]] proposed that the military should be more closely supervised by civilian authorities, Piłsudski criticized that as an attempt to politicize the army, and on 28 June, he resigned his last political appointment. The same day, the Sejm's left-wing deputies voted a resolution, thanking him for his past work.{{r|Urbank97_490}} Piłsudski went into retirement in [[Sulejówek]], outside Warsaw, at his country manor, ''"Milusin"'', which had been presented to him by his former soldiers.{{sfn|Watt|1979|p=210}} There, he settled down to supporting his family by writing a series of political and military memoirs, including ''Rok 1920'' (The Year 1920).{{r|PolandGov}}

Meanwhile, Poland's economy was in shambles. [[Hyperinflation]] fueled public unrest, and the government was unable to find a quick solution to the mounting unemployment and economic crisis.{{r|Urbank97_502}} Piłsudski's allies and supporters repeatedly asked him to return to politics, and he began to create a new power base, centred on former members of the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]] and the [[Polish Military Organization]] as well as some left-wing and [[intelligentsia]] parties. In 1925, after several governments had resigned in short order and the political scene was becoming increasingly chaotic, Piłsudski became more and more critical of the government and eventually issued statements demanding the resignation of the Witos cabinet.{{r|PolandGov|PWN}}

When the [[Chjeno-Piast]] coalition, which Piłsudski had strongly criticized, formed a new government,{{r|PWN}} on 12–14 May 1926, Piłsudski returned to power in a ''coup d'état'' (the [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]]), supported by the Polish Socialist Party, [[Polish People's Party "Wyzwolenie"|Liberation]], the [[Stronnictwo Chłopskie|Peasant Party]] and even the [[Communist Party of Poland|Polish Communist Party]].{{r|Urbank97_515}} Piłsudski had hoped for a bloodless coup, but the government had refused to back down;{{r|Suleja04_343}} 215 soldiers and 164 civilians had been killed, and over 900 persons had been wounded.{{sfn|Roszkowski|1992|loc= p. 53, section 5.1}}

==In government==
On 31 May, the ''[[Sejm]]'' elected Piłsudski president of the Republic. Piłsudski, however, aware of the presidency's limited powers, refused the office. Another of his old friends, [[Ignacy Mościcki]], was elected in his stead. Mościcki then appointed Piłsudski as [[Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland|Minister of Military Affairs]] (defence minister), a post that he would hold for the rest of his life in 11 successive governments, two of which he headed himself from 1926 to 1928 and for a brief period in 1930. He also served as [[General Inspector of the Armed Forces]], and Chairman of The War Council.{{r|PolandGov}}

Piłsudski had no plans for major reforms; he quickly distanced himself from the most radical of his left-wing supporters and declared that his coup was to be a "revolution without revolutionary consequences".{{r|PWN}} His goals were to stabilize the country; reduce the influence of political parties, which he blamed for corruption and inefficiency; and strengthen the army.{{r|PWN|Urbank97_528–9}} His role in the Polish government over the subsequent years has been called a dictatorship or a "quasi-dictatorship".&lt;{{sfn|Biskupski|2012|p=46}}

===Internal politics===
[[File:5 Warszawa 083.jpg|thumb|right|[[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Warsaw, Piłsudski's official residence during his years in power]]

In internal politics, Piłsudski's coup entailed sweeping limitations on parliamentary government, as his [[Sanacja|Sanation]] regime (1926–1939), at times employing authoritarian methods, sought to "restore public life to moral health". From 1928, the Sanation authorities were represented in the sphere of practical politics by the [[Non-partisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government]] (''BBWR''). Popular support and an effective propaganda apparatus allowed Piłsudski to maintain his authoritarian powers, which could not be overruled either by the president, who was appointed by Piłsudski, or by the ''[[Sejm]]''.{{r|PolandGov}} The powers of the ''Sejm'' were curtailed by [[August Novelization|constitutional amendments]] that were introduced soon after the coup, on 2 August 1926.{{r|PolandGov}} From 1926 to 1930, Piłsudski relied chiefly on propaganda to weaken the influence of opposition leaders.{{r|PWN}}

The culmination of his dictatorial and supralegal policies came in the 1930s, with the imprisonment and trial of certain political opponents (the [[Brest trial]]s) on the eve of the 1930 [[Polish legislative election, 1930|legislative elections]] and with the 1934 establishment of a [[Bereza Kartuska Detention Camp|prison]] for political prisoners at Bereza Kartuska (today [[Biaroza]]),{{r|PWN}} where some prisoners were brutally mistreated.{{r|Śleszyński03}} After the ''[[Non-partisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government|BBWR]]''{{'}}s 1930 victory, Piłsudski left most internal matters in the hands of [[Piłsudski's colonels|his "colonels"]] while he concentrated on military and foreign affairs.{{r|PWN}} He came under considerable criticism for his treatment of political opponents and their 1930 arrest and imprisonment was internationally condemned and damaged Poland's reputation.{{r|Biskupski2000}}
[[File:Aleksandra Piłsudska.JPG|thumb|left|The Marshal and his second wife, [[Aleksandra Piłsudska]], in later life]]
Piłsudski became increasingly disillusioned with democracy in Poland.{{r|CohenY89_65}} His intemperate public utterances (he called the ''[[Sejm]]'' a "prostitute") and his sending of 90 armed officers into the ''Sejm'' building in response to an impending [[vote of no-confidence]] caused concern in contemporary and modern observers who have seen his actions as setting precedents for authoritarian responses to political challenges.{{r|Times7Apr1930|Times11Nov1929|NYT12091993_Perlez}}

One of his main goals was to transform the [[parliamentary system]] into a [[presidential system]]; however, he opposed the introduction of [[totalitarianism]].{{r|PWN}} The adoption of a new Polish constitution in April 1935 that was tailored by Piłsudski's supporters to his specifications, providing for a strong presidency, came too late for Piłsudski to seek that office; but the [[April Constitution]] would serve Poland up to the outbreak of World War II and would carry its [[Polish Government in Exile|Government in Exile]] until the end of the war and beyond.

Nonetheless, Piłsudski's government depended more on his [[charismatic authority]] than on [[rational-legal authority]].{{r|PWN}} None of his followers could claim to be his legitimate heir, and after his death, the [[Sanacja|Sanation]] structure would quickly fracture, returning Poland to the pre-Piłsudski era of parliamentary political contention.{{r|PWN}}
[[File:Józef Piłsudski homaging at John III Sobieski tomb, commemorating 250 anniversary of battle of Vienna.PNG|thumb|In 1933, Piłsudski paid homage at the tomb of [[John III Sobieski]] in commemoration of the 250th anniversary of [[Battle of Vienna]].]]
Piłsudski's regime began a period of national stabilization and of improvement in the situation of [[ethnic minorities]], which formed about a third of the Second Republic's population.{{r|Stachura04_79|ColuEncyclPoland}} Piłsudski replaced the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]]' "[[polonization|ethnic-assimilation]]" with a "state-assimilation" policy: citizens were judged not by their ethnicity but by their loyalty to the state.{{r|Snyder04_144|Zimm04_166}} Widely recognized for his opposition to the National Democrats' anti-Semitic policies,{{r|Vital99_788|Payne95_141|Lieven94_163|Engelking01_75|Flannery05_200|Zimm03_19}} he extended his policy of "state-assimilation" to [[Polish Jews]].{{r|Snyder04_144|Zimm04_166|Prizel98_61|Wein90_292}} The years 1926 to 1935 and Piłsudski himself were favorably viewed by many [[Polish Jews]] whose situation improved especially under Piłsudski-appointed Prime Minister [[Kazimierz Bartel]].{{r|Cieplinski02|Paulsson03_37}} Many Jews saw Piłsudski as their only hope for restraining antisemitic currents in Poland and for maintaining public order; he was seen as a guarantor of stability and a friend of the Jewish people, who voted for him and actively participated in his political bloc.{{r|Snyder07_66}} Piłsudski's death in 1935 brought a deterioration in the quality of life of Poland's Jews.{{r|Zimm03_19}}

During the 1930s, a combination of developments, from the [[Great Depression]]{{r|Snyder04_144}} to the [[vicious spiral]] of ''[[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|OUN]]'' terrorist attacks and government pacifications, caused government relations with the national minorities to deteriorate.{{r|Snyder04_144}}{{sfn|Davies|2005|loc=p. 407 (1982 ed. Columbia Univ. Press - ISBN 978-0-231-05352-5 }} Unrest among national minorities was also related to foreign policy. Troubles followed repressions in the largely-Ukrainian eastern Galicia, where nearly 1,800 persons were arrested. Tension also arose between the government and Poland's German minority, particularly in [[Upper Silesia]]. The government did not yield to calls for antisemitic measures; but the Jews (8.6% of Poland's population) grew discontented for economic reasons that were connected with the Depression. Overall, by the end of Piłsudski's life, his government's relations with national minorities were increasingly problematic.{{sfn|Leslie|1983|p=182}}

In the military sphere, Piłsudski, who had shown himself an accomplished military strategist in engineering the "[[Miracle at the Vistula]]", has been criticized by some for subsequently concentrating on personnel management and allegedly neglecting modernization of military strategy and equipment.{{r|PWN|Garlicki195_178}} His experiences in the Polish-Soviet War (1919–1921) may have led him to overestimate the importance of cavalry and to neglect the development of armoured and air forces.{{r|Garlicki195_178}} Others, however, contend that, particularly from the late 1920s, he had supported the development of these military branches.{{r|Urbank97_2_330-7}} The limitations on Poland's military modernization in this period may have been less doctrinal than financial.

===Foreign policy===
[[File:Kossak Józef Piłsudski.jpg|thumb|upright|Marshal Piłsudski, painted by [[Wojciech Kossak]], 1928]]
Under Piłsudski, Poland maintained good relations with neighboring [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], Hungary and [[Latvia]]. Relations were strained with [[Czechoslovakia]], however, and even worse with [[Lithuania]].{{sfn|Goldstein|2002|p=29}} Relations with [[Weimar Germany]] and the [[Soviet Union]] varied over time, but during Piłsudski's tenure could, for the most part, be described as neutral.{{r|Urbank97_538-40|Prizel98_71}}

Piłsudski's Promethean programme to weaken the Russian Empire and its [[successor state]], the Soviet Union, by supporting nationalist independence movements of major non-Russian peoples dwelling in Russia and the Soviet Union, was co-ordinated from 1927 to the 1939 outbreak of World War II in Europe by the [[military intelligence]] officer, [[Edmund Charaszkiewicz]]. In the [[interbellum]], but it yielded few tangible results.{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|pp=56-87}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0527-0001-293, Warschau, Empfang Goebbels bei Marschall Pilsudski.jpg|thumb|left|270px|German ambassador, [[Hans-Adolf von Moltke]], Piłsudski, [[Joseph Goebbels]] and [[Józef Beck]], Polish Foreign minister, in [[Warsaw]] on 15 June 1934, five months after the [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]]]]
Piłsudski sought to maintain his country's independence in the international arena. Assisted by his protégé, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs|Foreign Minister]] [[Józef Beck]], he sought support for Poland in alliances with western powers, such as France and the United Kingdom, and with friendly, if less powerful, neighbours, such as Romania and Hungary.{{r|Urbank97_539–40}}

A supporter of the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and the [[Polish-Romanian Alliance]], part of the [[Little Entente]], Piłsudski was disappointed by the French and British policy of [[appeasement]] evident in their signing of the [[Locarno Treaties]].{{r|Prizel98_71|Lukacs01_30|Jordan02_23}} Piłsudski, therefore, aimed also to maintain good relations with the Soviet Union and Germany and so Poland signed [[non-aggression pact]]s with both of its powerful neighbours: the 1932 [[Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]] and the 1934 [[German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact]].{{r|Urbank97_539–40}} Both were meant to strengthen Poland's position in the eyes of its allies and neighbours.{{r|PolandGov}}

Piłsudski himself was acutely aware of the shakiness of the pacts, and he commented: "Having these pacts, we are straddling two stools. This cannot last long. We have to know from which stool we will tumble first, and when that will be".{{r|Kipp93_95}} Critics of the two non-aggression pacts have accused Piłsudski of underestimating Hitler's aggressiveness,{{r|Hehn05_76}} of giving Germany time to rearm{{sfn|Kershaw|2001|p=237}}{{r|Davidson04_25}} and of allowing Stalin to eliminate opposition, primarily in Ukraine, which had been supported by Piłsudski's [[Prometheism|Promethean]] program.{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|p=64}}

After [[Adolf Hitler]] [[Machtergreifung|came to power]] in Germany in January 1933, Piłsudski is rumored to have proposed to France a [[preventive war]] against Germany. It has been argued that Piłsudski may have been sounding out France regarding possible joint military action against Germany.{{r|Urbank97_2_317-26}} Lack of French interest may have been a reason for Poland signing the [[German–Polish Non-Aggression Pact|Non-Aggression Pact of January 1934]].{{r|Urbank97_539–40}}&lt;ref name="TT_NGP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GQH"/&gt;{{r|EBritannica_JP}} Little evidence has, however, been found in French or Polish diplomatic archives that such a proposal for preventive war was ever actually advanced.&lt;ref name="Bel"/&gt;

Hitler repeatedly suggested a German-Polish alliance against the Soviet Union, but Piłsudski declined, instead seeking precious time to prepare for potential war with either Germany or the Soviet Union.{{r|EBritannica_JP}}&lt;ref name="Hildebrand"/&gt; Just before his death, Piłsudski told [[Józef Beck]] that it must be Poland's policy to maintain neutral relations with Germany, keep up the Polish alliance with France and improve relations with the United Kingdom.{{r|Urbank97_539–40}}

==Religious views==
Piłsudski's religious views are a matter of debate. He was baptised on 15 December 1867 in the church of Powiewiórka (then [[Švenčionys|Sventsiany]] deanery) by the priest, Thomas Valinsky. His godparents were Joseph and Constance Martsinkovsky Ragalskaya.&lt;ref&gt;[Adam Borkiewicz: Źródła do biografii Józefa Piłsudskiego the z lat 1867-1892, Niepodległość. T. XIX. Warszawa: 1939.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He periodically changed his religious affiliation from [[Roman Catholicism]] to [[Lutheranism]], and back.

On 15 July 1899, at the village of Paproć Duża, near [[Łomża]], he married [[Maria Piłsudska]], a divorcée.  As the [[Catholic Church]] did not recognise divorces, she and Piłsudski had converted to [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrzej Garlicki, ''Józef Piłsudski: 1867–1935'', [[Warsaw]], [[Czytelnik]], 1988,  {{ISBN|8307017157}}, pp. 63–64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In connection with marrying, Piłsudski had converted to the Evangelical-Augsburg Church.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pilsudski later returned to the Catholic Church in order to marry [[Aleksandra Piłsudska]]. Piłsudski and Aleksandra could not get married as Piłsudski's wife Maria refused to divorce him. It was only after Maria's death in 1921 that they were married, on 25 October of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Adviser Daria and Thomas, ''Jozef Pilsudski: Legends and Facts'', Warsaw 1987, {{ISBN|83-203-1967-6}}, p. 132.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suleja Vladimir, ''Jozef Pilsudski'', Wroclaw - Warsaw - Kraków 2005, {{ISBN|83-04-04706-3}}, pp. 290.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[May Coup (Poland)|May coup]], Piłsudski considered himself a Roman Catholic, but he did not appear to be religious and often used religion as a public tool. Piłsudski was quoted saying:
{{cquote|Religion is for brainless people.}} 
After the coup and Piłsudski's reign as dictator, he often clashed with Catholic leaders but nevertheless enjoyed a good working relationship with Cardinal [[Aleksander Kakowski]], who subsequently led his funeral mass. In 1937, Archbishop of Kraków, [[Adam Stefan Sapieha]], ordered to move Piłsudski's coffin from [[St. Leonard's Crypt]] to Royal Tombs at [[Wawel]]. This led to open conflict with the church and the government, which threatened to step down.

==Death==
[[File:Rossa-MATKA I SERCE SYNA.jpg|thumb|right|Grave of Piłsudski's mother in [[Vilnius]], Lithuania. The huge black tombstone is inscribed: "''Matka i serce syna''"&lt;br/&gt; ("A mother and the heart of [her] son") and bears evocative lines from a poem by [[Juliusz Słowacki|Słowacki]].]]
By 1935, unbeknownst to the public, Piłsudski had for several years been in declining health. On 12 May 1935, he died of [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancer]] at Warsaw's [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]]. The celebration of his life began spontaneously within half an hour of the announcement of his death.{{sfn|Drozdowski|Szwankowska|1995|p=5}} It was led by military personnel — former [[Polish Legions in World War I|Legionnaires]], members of the [[Polish Military Organization]], veterans of the wars of 1919–21 — and by his political collaborators from his service as Chief of State and, later, Prime Minister and Inspector-General.{{r|DroSzwa95_911}}

The [[Communist Party of Poland|Polish Communist Party]] immediately attacked Piłsudski as a fascist and capitalist,{{r|DroSzwa95_911}} though fascists themselves did not see him as one of them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SwMOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=%22a+liberal+democrat+in+the+clothes+of+an+old-world+knight.%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=wwxy3WRgEl&amp;sig=Ok3awKVR6URUy-YX_7C3M14ENXw&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PvVrTPeCM4GsOJTuqZ0B&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22a%20liberal%20democrat%20in%20the%20clothes%20of%20an%20old-world%20knight.%22&amp;f=false ''Ideas into Politics: Aspects of European History, 1880–1950''] R. J. Bullen, Hartmut Pogge von Strandmann, A. B. Polonsky, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1984, p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Other opponents of the [[sanacja|Sanation]] regime, however, were more civil; socialists (such as [[Ignacy Daszyński]] and [[Tomasz Arciszewski]]) and [[Polish Christian Democratic Party|Christian Democrats]] (represented by Ignacy Paderewski, [[Stanisław Wojciechowski]] and [[Władysław Grabski]]) expressed condolences. The peasant parties split in their reactions ([[Wincenty Witos]] voicing criticism of Piłsudski, but [[Maciej Rataj]] and [[Stanisław Thugutt]] being supportive), while [[Roman Dmowski]]'s [[National Democracy|National Democrats]] expressed a toned-down criticism.{{r|DroSzwa95_911}}

Condolences were expressed by the clergy, including [[primate of Poland|Poland's Primate]] [[August Hlond]], as well as by [[Pope Pius XI]], who called himself a "personal friend" of Piłsudski. Notable appreciation for Piłsudski was expressed by Poland's ethnic and religious minorities. [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Greek Orthodox]], Protestant, [[Judaism|Judaic]] and Islamic organizations expressed condolences, praising Piłsudski for his policies of religious tolerance.{{r|DroSzwa95_911}} His death was a shock to members of the Jewish minority, who even years after remembered him as a "very good man" who "protected Jews".&lt;ref name="Dov Weissberg, I remember, page 116"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Interview with Holocaust survivor Cyla Wiener"/&gt;

Mainstream organizations of ethnic minorities similarly expressed their support for his policies of ethnic tolerance, though he was criticized by, in addition to the Polish communists, the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Poland|Jewish Labour Bund]], and Ukrainian, German and Lithuanian extremists.{{r|DroSzwa95_911}}

On the international scene, Pope Pius XI held a special ceremony 18 May in the [[Holy See]], a commemoration was conducted at [[League of Nations]] [[Geneva]] headquarters, and dozens of messages of condolence arrived in Poland from [[head of state|heads of state]] across the world, including Germany's Adolf Hitler, the Soviet Union's [[Joseph Stalin]], Italy's [[Benito Mussolini]] and King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]], France's [[Albert Lebrun]] and [[Pierre-Étienne Flandin]], Austria's [[Wilhelm Miklas]], Japan's Emperor [[Hirohito]], and Britain's King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]].{{r|DroSzwa95_911}}

Ceremonies, [[mass (liturgy)|masses]] and an enormous funeral were held; a [[funeral train]] toured Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHumphrey1936|Humphrey 1936]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=BNkwAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Pi%C5%82sudski+%22funeral+train%22&amp;dq=Pi%C5%82sudski+%22funeral+train%22&amp;hl=pl&amp;pgis=1 p. 295].&lt;/ref&gt; A series of postcards, stamps and postmarks was also released. In 1937, after a two-year display at [[St. Leonard's Crypt]] in [[Kraków]]'s [[Wawel Cathedral]], Piłsudski's body was laid to rest in the Cathedral's Crypt under the Silver Bells, except for his brain, which he had willed for study to [[Vilnius University|Stefan Batory University]], and his heart, which was interred in his mother's grave at [[Vilnius]]' [[Rasos Cemetery]], where it remains.{{r|PolandGov}}{{sfn|Watt|1979|p=338}}

The 1937 relocation of his remains, made by his long-standing adversary [[Adam Stefan Sapieha|Adam Sapieha]], then [[Archbishop of Krakow]], incited widespread protests that included calls for Sapieha's removal.&lt;ref name="Crowds urge Poland to banish Archbishop; Pilsudski Legionnaires also Assail Catholic Church on the Removal of Marshal's Body"/&gt;{{sfn|Lerski|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/?id=QTUTqE2difgC&amp;pg=PA525 p. 525]}}

On 13 May 1935, in accordance with Piłsudski's last wishes, [[Edward Rydz-Śmigły]] was named by Poland's president and government to be [[Inspector-General]] of the [[Polish Armed Forces]], and on 10 November 1936, he was elevated to [[Marshal of Poland]].{{sfn|Jabłonowski|Stawecki|1998|p=13}} Rydz was now one of the most powerful people in Poland, the "second man in the state after the President".{{sfn|Jabłonowski|Stawecki|1998|p=5}} While many saw Rydz-Śmigły as a successor to Piłsudski, he never became as influential.{{r|JabStaw98_14}}

As the Polish government became increasingly [[authoritarian]] and conservative, the Rydz-Śmigły faction was opposed by that of the more moderate [[Ignacy Mościcki]], who remained President.{{r|JabStaw98_14}} After 1938 Rydz-Śmigły reconciled with the President, but the ruling group remained divided into the "President's Men", mostly civilians (the "Castle Group", after the President's official residence, Warsaw's [[Royal Castle (Warsaw)|Royal Castle]]), and the "Marshal's Men" ("[[Piłsudski's colonels|Piłsudski's Colonels]]"), professional military officers and old comrades-in-arms of Piłsudski's. After the German [[invasion of Poland]] in 1939, some of this political division would survive within the [[Polish government in exile]].

[[File:Piłsudski statue and honour guards.jpg|thumb|right|[[Józef Piłsudski Monument in Warsaw (Piłsudski Square)|Statue of Piłsudski]] on Warsaw's [[Piłsudski Square]]—one of many [[statuary]] tributes throughout Poland]]
Piłsudski had given Poland something akin to what [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]]'s [[Onufry Zagłoba]] had mused about: a Polish [[Oliver Cromwell]]. As such, the Marshal had inevitably drawn both intense loyalty and intense vilification.&lt;ref name="TT_NGP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldfarb"/&gt;{{sfn|Drozdowski|Szwankowska|1995|p=6}}

In 1935, at Piłsudski's funeral, President Mościcki [[eulogy|eulogized]] the Marshal: "He was the king of our hearts and the sovereign of our will. During a half-century of his life's travails, he captured heart after heart, soul after soul, until he had drawn the whole of Poland within the purple of his royal spirit&amp;nbsp;... He gave Poland freedom, boundaries, power and respect."&lt;ref name="Mość"&gt;Translation of Mościcki's speech from 1935.

After World War II, little of Piłsudski's thought influenced the policies of the [[Polish People's Republic]], a ''de facto'' [[satellite state|satellite]] of the [[Soviet Union]]. In particular, Poland was in no position to resume Piłsudski's effort to build an ''Intermarium'' federation of Poland and some of its neighbors; and a "[[Prometheism|Promethean]]" endeavor to "break up the Russian state into its main constituents and emancipate the countries that have been forcibly incorporated into that empire."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{harvnb|Charaszkiewicz|2000|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a decade after World War II, Piłsudski was either ignored or condemned by Poland's communist government, along with the entire interwar [[Second Polish Republic]]. This began to change, however, particularly after [[de-Stalinization]] and the [[Polish October]] (1956), and historiography in Poland gradually moved away from a purely negative view of Piłsudski toward a more balanced and neutral assessment.{{r|Władyka+Żuławnik}}

After the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of communism]] and the 1991 disintegration of the [[Soviet Union]], Piłsudski once again came to be publicly acknowledged as a Polish national hero.&lt;ref name="Roshwald"/&gt; On the sixtieth anniversary of his death, on 12 May 1995, Poland's ''[[Sejm]]'' adopted a resolution: "Józef Piłsudski will remain, in our nation's memory, the founder of its independence and the victorious leader who fended off a foreign assault that threatened the whole of Europe and its civilization. Józef Piłsudski served his country well and has entered our history forever."&lt;ref name="Sejm1995"/&gt;

While some of Piłsudski's political moves remain controversial—particularly the May 1926 Coup d'état, the [[Brest trial]]s (1931–32), the 1934 establishment of the [[Bereza Kartuska detention camp]], and successive Polish governments' failure to formulate consistent, constructive policies toward the [[national minorities]]{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|pp=66–67}}—Piłsudski continues to be viewed by most Poles as a providential figure in the country's 20th-century history.

[[File:Pilsudski carricature by Szwajcer.PNG|thumb|upright|Contemporary [[caricature]] of Józef Piłsudski by [[Jerzy Szwajcer]]]]
Piłsudski has lent his name to several military units, including the [[Polish 1st Legions Infantry Division|1st Legions Infantry Division]] and [[armored train]] No. 51 ("''I Marszałek''"—"the First Marshal").&lt;ref name="PIBWL"/&gt;

Also named for Piłsudski have been [[Piłsudski's Mound]], one of four man-made [[mound]]s in [[Kraków]];&lt;ref name="mound"/&gt; the [[Józef Piłsudski Institute of America]], a New York City research center and museum on the modern [[history of Poland]];&lt;ref name="Institute"/&gt; the [[Józef Piłsudski University of Physical Education in Warsaw]];&lt;ref name="MON"/&gt; a passenger ship, {{MS|Piłsudski}}; a gunboat, {{ORP|Komendant Piłsudski}}; and a racehorse, ''[[Pilsudski (horse)|Pilsudski]]''. Virtually every Polish city has its "Piłsudski Street". (There are, by contrast, few if any streets named after Piłsudski's [[National Democracy|National-Democrat]] arch-rival, [[Roman Dmowski]], even in Dmowski's old [[Greater Poland|Greater-Poland]] political stronghold). There are statues of Piłsudski in many Polish cities; the highest density of such [[statuary]] memorials is found in Warsaw, which has three in little more than a mile between the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]], Piłsudski's residence, and [[Piłsudski Square]].

He was the subject of paintings by renowned artists such as [[Jacek Malczewski]] (1916) and [[Wojciech Kossak]] (leaning on his sword, 1928; and astride his horse, ''[[Kasztanka]]'', 1928), as well as of numerous caricatures and photos.

Piłsudski has been a character in numerous works of fiction, such as the 1922 novel ''Generał Barcz'' (General Barcz) by [[Juliusz Kaden-Bandrowski]] and the 2007 novel ''[[Ice (Dukaj novel)|Ice]]'' (''Lód'') by [[Jacek Dukaj]]. Poland's [[National Library of Poland|National Library]] lists over 500 publications related to Piłsudski;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alpha.bn.org.pl/search*pol/d?SEARCH=pi%B3sudski|title=Piłsudski (keyword)|work=National Library Of Poland|accessdate =15 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the U.S. [[Library of Congress]], over 300.&lt;ref name="Library of Congress Online Catalog"/&gt; Piłsudski's life was the subject of a 2001 Polish television documentary, ''Marszałek Piłsudski'', directed by Andrzej Trzos-Rastawiecki.&lt;ref name="IMDb"/&gt;

==Descendants==
Both daughters of Marshal Piłsudski returned to Poland in 1990, after the fall of the Communist system. Jadwiga Piłsudska's daughter Joanna Jaraczewska returned to Poland in 1979. She married a Polish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|"Solidarity"]] activist [[Janusz Onyszkiewicz]] in a political prison in 1983. Both were very involved in the Polish struggle against communism between 1979 and 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lachowicz, Teofil |editor=Karkowska, Julita |title=Droga na szczyty |website=Nowy Dziennik |language=pl |url=http://www.dziennik.com/www/dziennik/kult/archiwum/01-06-06/pp-03-03-02.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723095525/http://www.dziennik.com/www/dziennik/kult/archiwum/01-06-06/pp-03-03-02.html |archivedate=23 July 2011 |accessdate=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Józef Klemens Piłsudski was commonly referred to without his middle name, as "Józef Piłsudski". A few English sources translate his first name as "Joseph", but this is not the common practice. As a young man, he belonged to underground organizations and used various pseudonyms, including "''Wiktor''", "''Mieczysław''" and "''Ziuk''" (the latter also being his family nickname). Later he was often affectionately called "''Dziadek''" ("Grandpa" or "the Old Man") and "''Marszałek''" ("the Marshal"). His ex-soldiers from the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Legions]] also referred to him as "''Komendant''" ("the Commandant").

'''b.''' {{Note label|b|b|none}}Piłsudski sometimes spoke of being a Lithuanian of Polish culture.{{sfn|Davies|1986|p=139}} For several centuries, declaring both Lithuanian and Polish identity was not self-excluding alike in case of master of Polish poetry [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. The question of Piłsudski's ethnicity and culture simply does not match contemporary templates, the more the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] which Piłsudski regarded as his spiritual ''patria'' failed to reborn itself and finally ceased to exist in the wake of arising modern nationalisms. [[Timothy Snyder]], who calls him a "Polish-Lithuanian", notes that Piłsudski did not think in terms of 20th-century nationalisms and [[ethnicity|ethnicities]]; he considered himself ''both'' a Pole and a Lithuanian, and his homeland was the historic [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].{{sfn|Snyder|2004|p=70}}

The '''Key Largo woodrat''' (''Neotoma floridana smalli''),&lt;ref name=Humphrey/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hayes/&gt;&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;&lt;ref name=McCleery-SE/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hersh/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barbour/&gt;&lt;ref name=McCleery-Midland/&gt; a [[subspecies]] of the [[eastern woodrat]] (''Neotoma floridana''), is a medium-sized [[rat]] found in the northern area of [[Key Largo, Florida]], in the [[United States]]. It is currently on the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species]]. The rat grows to 260 grams and feeds on [[fruit]], [[leaf|leaves]] and buds. It has a gray-brown back and white belly, chest, and throat, and a hairy tail. Only 6500 animals were thought to remain in North Key Largo in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=Humphrey/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
Although a 1923 article described woodrat nests on Key Largo, the form was not scientifically described until 1955, when H.B. Sherman described it as ''Neotoma floridana smalli'', a [[subspecies]] of the widespread [[eastern woodrat]] (''Neotoma floridana'').&lt;!--can't find any reference in the paper to etymology--&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sherman, H.B.|date=1955|title=Description of a new race of woodrat from Key Largo, Florida|journal=Journal of Mammalogy|volume=36|issue=1|pages=113–120|jstor=1375731|doi=10.2307/1375731}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Lazell suggested that it is distinct enough to be considered a separate species, but this proposal has not been accepted.&lt;!--p.333--&gt; The [[mitochondrial DNA]] of Key Largo woodrats is distinct by at least 0.6% from that of the most similar subspecies, the Florida woodrat (''Neotoma floridana floridana'') from further north in Florida, but members of that subspecies differ about as much from each other as from the Key Largo woodrat.&lt;!--p.340--&gt;&lt;ref name=Hayes/&gt;

==Description==
The Key Largo woodrat is similar to the Florida woodrat (''Neotoma floridana floridana'') and cannot be distinguished from it in size or external anatomy. It differs in the shape of the [[sphenopalatine vacuities]] (openings in the roof of the [[mesopterygoid fossa]], the gap behind the [[palate]]), which are narrower and shorter than in ''N.&amp;nbsp;f.&amp;nbsp;floridana''. On average, males are a bit larger than females. In the [[holotype]], an adult male, total length is {{convert|368|mm|in|abbr=on}}, tail length {{convert|167|mm|in|abbr=on}}, hindfoot length {{convert|37|mm|in|abbr=on}}, ear length {{convert|26|mm|in|abbr=on}}, dimensions of the [[testis]] {{convert|14|x|8.5|mm|in|abbr=on}}, and mass is {{convert|207|g|oz|abbr=on}}.&lt;!--Sherman doesn't give measurements for other specimens; leaving this in until I find something better--&gt;&lt;ref name=Sherman/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The animal is found exclusively in the northern part of Key Largo, at least 210&amp;nbsp;km removed from its nearest kin, the [[Florida woodrat]]. It is endemic to the [[tropical hardwood hammock]]s of Key Largo, where its habitat has shrunk by half since the 1920s, and the remainder is fragmented, thinned, and developed. It retains some 850 [[Hectare|ha]], most of which is in the [[Dagny Johnson Key Largo Hammock Botanical State Park]] and the adjacent [[Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge]].&lt;ref name=McCleery-SE/&gt;

==Behaviour==

===Shelter===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Finished Structure for Key Largo Woodrat Home.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Man-made structure for Key Largo woodrat, in [[Crocodile Lake National Wildlife Refuge]].]] --&gt;
The Key Largo woodrat builds nests out of sticks; these nests can be as high as a man's shoulder. They are handed down from generation to generation, and some are possibly centuries old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=HQEqAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5NEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2738,3199387&amp;dq=key-largo-woodrat&amp;hl=en|title=Wildlife Officer Works to Save Endangered Rat|date=20 April 1989|publisher=[[The Daytona Beach News-Journal]]|page=13|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==
Since the Key Largo woodrat has a small and specific habitat, it is susceptible to human encroachment. Since the 1920s, it has lost almost half of its traditional habitat.&lt;ref name=McCleery-SE/&gt; In the early 1980s, biologists began equipping rats with radio devices to count them and study them;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB35F123848B241&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Federal Aid Sought as the Woodrat's Time Runs Out|date=21 March 1984|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|pages=1D|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the end of the 1980s, a study showed that the rat had disappeared from Key Largo proper and its total population had dwindled to some 6500 animals on [[North Key Largo]].&lt;ref name=Humphrey/&gt; Its fate in Key Largo was tied to that of the [[American Crocodile]], and when a planned reservation for the crocodile in North Key Largo bogged down during the presidential transition in the US Administration in 1980, the woodrat was threatened with extinction; the crocodile reservation was to be a haven for the woodrat, and also for the rare [[Papilio aristodemus|Schaus Swallowtail]] butterfly. A project called Port Bougainville, with 15 hotels besides condos, would add 45,000 inhabitants to North Key Largo by the year 2000, adding to the pressure on the crocodile and other animals.&lt;ref name="condo"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Z9ohAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=qp8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1569,1661650&amp;dq=key-largo-woodrat&amp;hl=en|title=Condos May Kill Off American Crocodiles: It's the 11th Hour for the American Crocodile and other Endangered Species that Live on Key Largo|last=Dahlburg|first=John-Thor|date=18 December 1982|publisher=[[Daytona Beach Morning Journal]]|pages=19A|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|406|acre|km2|adj=on}} project, which by 1982 included a planned 2806 units, ran into opposition from environmental groups and by 1984 had ground to a halt after one of the investors withdrew a $54 million investment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keyshistory.org/nokeylargopage2.html|title=North Key Largo|last=Wilkinson|first=Jerry|website=Keys Historeum|publisher=Historical Preservation Society of the Upper Keys|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1983 already, the administration had intervened and declared the Key Largo woodrat and the [[Key Largo cotton mouse]] endangered on a "temporary emergency basis";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB3607E5507B0F9&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Protecting Land Endangers Value, Investors Say|date=17 September 1984|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|pages=17A|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the developer of a golf course, for instance, was ordered to restore the area he was illegally developing, to preserve the woodrat's habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB360ACB6649B56&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=State Orders Firm to Restore Key Largo Land|date=4 October 1984|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|pages=1C|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1984, the Key Largo woodrat is on the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species|United States list of endangered species]], along with the Schaus Swallowtail and the Key Largo Cotton Mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;s_site=miami&amp;p_multi=MH&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB36078AE0586B0&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=2 Key Largo Rodents, Butterfly Added to Endangered Species List|date=2 September 1984|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|pages=12F|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MATSim''' (the Multi-Agent Transport Simulation Toolkit) is an [[open source software|open source]] [[software development]] project developing [[agent-based model|agent-based]] [[modular programming|software modules]] intended for use with [[transportation planning model]]s.

==History==
"The MATSim project started with Kai Nagel, then at ETH Zurich, and his interest in
improving his work with, and for, the TRansportation ANalysis and SIMulation System (TRANSIMS)
project; he also wanted to make the resulting code open-source. After
Kai Nagel’s departure to Berlin in 2004, Kay W. Axhausen joined the team, bringing a different approach
and experience."

[[File:MONIAC.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Moniac Computer, exhibited at the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]]]]
The '''MONIAC''' ('''Monetary National Income Analogue Computer''') also known as the '''Phillips Hydraulic Computer''' and the '''Financephalograph''', was created in 1949 by the [[New Zealand]] economist [[William Phillips (economist)|Bill Phillips (William Phillips)]] to model the national economic processes of the [[United Kingdom]], while Phillips was a student at the [[London School of Economics]] (LSE). The MONIAC was an [[analog computer|analogue computer]] which used [[fluidics|fluidic logic]] to model the workings of an economy. The MONIAC name may have been suggested by an association of [[money]] and [[ENIAC]], an early electronic [[digital computer]].

==Description==
[[File:MONIACdashboard.jpg|thumb|MONIAC dashboard]]
The MONIAC was approximately 2&amp;nbsp;m high, 1.2&amp;nbsp;m wide and almost 1&amp;nbsp;m deep, and consisted of a series of transparent plastic tanks and pipes which were fastened to a wooden board. Each tank represented some aspect of the UK national [[economy]] and the flow of money around the economy was illustrated by coloured water. At the top of the board was a large tank called the treasury. Water (representing money) flowed from the treasury to other tanks representing the various ways in which a country could spend its money. For example, there were tanks for health and education. To increase spending on health care a tap could be opened to drain water from the treasury to the tank which represented health spending. Water then ran further down the model to other tanks, representing other interactions in the economy. Water could be pumped back to the treasury from some of the tanks to represent [[tax]]ation. Changes in tax rates were modeled by increasing or decreasing pumping speeds.

[[Saving (money)|Savings]] reduce the funds available to consumers and [[investment]] income increases those funds.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The MONIAC showed this by draining water (savings) from the expenditure stream and by injecting water (investment income) into that stream. When the savings flow exceeds the investment flow, the level of water in the savings and investment tank (the surplus-balances tank) would rise to reflect the accumulated balance. When the investment flow exceeds the savings flow for any length of time, the surplus-balances tank would run dry. Import and export were represented by water draining from the model, and by additional water being poured into the model.

The actual flow of the water was automatically controlled through a series of floats, counterweights, electrodes and cords. When the level of water reached a certain level in a tank, pumps and drains would be activated. To their surprise, Phillips and his associate Walter Newlyn found that MONIAC could be calibrated to an accuracy of ±2%.

The flow of water between the tanks was determined by economic principles and the settings for various parameters. Different economic parameters, such as tax rates and investment rates, could be entered by setting the valves which controlled the flow of water about the computer.  Users could experiment with different settings and note the effect on the model. The MONIAC’s ability to model the subtle interaction of a number of variables made it a powerful tool for its time.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
When a set of parameters resulted in a viable economy the model would stabilise and the results could be read from scales. The output from the computer could also be sent to a rudimentary [[plotter]].

MONIAC had been designed to be used as a teaching aid but was discovered also to be an effective economic simulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4064850/|title=Historical perspectives - The Moniac A Hydromechanical Analog Computer of the 1950s - IEEE Journals &amp; Magazine|website=ieeexplore.ieee.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time that MONIAC was created, electronic digital computers that could run complex economic simulations were unavailable. In 1949, the few computers in existence were restricted to government and military use. Neither did they have adequate visual display facilities, so were unable to illustrate the operation of complex models. Observing the MONIAC in operation made it much easier for students to understand the interrelated processes of a national economy. The range of organisations that acquired a MONIAC showed that it was used in both capacities.

Phillips scrounged a variety of materials to create his prototype computer, including bits and pieces from war surplus such as parts from old [[Lancaster bomber]]s. The first MONIAC was created in his landlady’s garage in [[Croydon]] at a cost of [[pound sterling|£]]400 ({{Inflation|UK|400|1949|fmt=eq|r=-3|cursign=£}}).

Phillips first demonstrated the MONIAC to a number of leading economists at the LSE in 1949. It was very well received and Phillips was soon offered a teaching position at the LSE.

==Current locations==
It is thought that twelve to fourteen machines were built. 
* The prototype was given to the Economics Department at the [[University of Leeds]], where it is currently on exhibition in the reception of the university's Business School. Copies went to three other British universities.
* Other computers went to [[Harvard Business School]] and the [[Roosevelt University|Roosevelt College]] in the United States, and [[Melbourne University]] in Australia. The [[Ford Motor Company]] and the Central Bank of [[Guatemala]] are believed to have bought MONIACs.
* A MONIAC owned by [[Istanbul University]] is located in the Faculty Of Economics and can be inspected by interested parties.
* A MONIAC from the LSE was given to the [[Science Museum (London)|Science Museum]] in London and, after conservation, was placed on public display in the museum’s mathematics galleries.&lt;ref&gt;http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co64127/phillips-economic-computer-analog-computer&lt;/ref&gt;
* A MONIAC owned by the LSE was donated to the [[New Zealand Institute of Economic Research]] in [[Wellington, New Zealand]]. This machine formed part of the New Zealand Exhibition at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 2003. The MONIAC was set to model the New Zealand economy. In 2007 this machine was restored and placed on permanent display in the [[Reserve Bank of New Zealand]] Museum.&lt;ref name="rbnz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbnz.govt.nz/research_and_publications/fact_sheets_and_guides/3290698.pdf |title=A.

* A working MONIAC (or Phillips Machine as it is known in the UK) can be found at the Faculty of Economics at [[Cambridge University]] in the [[United Kingdom]].  This machine was restored by Allan McRobie of the [[Cambridge University Engineering Department]], who holds an annual demonstration to students.
* A replica of the MONIAC at the [[Bank of Guatemala|central bank of Guatemala]] was created for a 2005-6 exhibition entitled "Tropical Economies" at the Wattis Institute of the [[California College of the Arts]] in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref name="wattis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kunstaspekte.de/index.php?tid=14632&amp;action=termin |title=Michael Stevenson: Tropical Economies |accessdate=28 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The MONIAC at The University of Melbourne, Australia, is on permanent display in the lobby of the Giblin Eunson Library (Ground Floor, Business and Economics Building, 111 Barry st, Carlton, Melbourne).  The faculty has extended an invitation to anyone interested in restoring the MONIAC to functional capacity.
* [[Erasmus University Rotterdam|Erasmus University Rotterdam (EUR)]] has owned a MONIAC since 1953. It was a gift from the City of Rotterdam for EUR's 40th anniversary. It is located in the THEIL building on the B floor next room CB-1.

==Popular culture==
* The [[Terry Pratchett]] novel ''[[Making Money]]'' contains a similar device as a major plot point. However, after this device is fully perfected, it magically gains the ability not only to simulate the economy but to affect it, culminating in a scene where it refills a bank's gold reserve.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32678">'''Master Jesus''' is the theosophical concept of [[Jesus]] in [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|Theosophy]] and the [[Ascended Master Teachings]].

==Position in the Hierarchy of Masters of the Ancient Wisdom==
The Master Jesus is one of the [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom]] in Theosophy and is one of the [[Ascended master|Ascended Masters]] (also collectively called the [[Great White Brotherhood]]; with white being in reference to the light) in the [[Ascended Master Teachings]], a group of religions based on Theosophy. The Master Jesus is regarded by Theosophists, was regarded by [[Alice Bailey]] and was later regarded by students of the "Ascended Master Teachings" as the Master of the [[Seven Rays|Sixth Ray]].&lt;ref name=fire1237&gt;Bailey, Alice A, '' A Treatise on Cosmic Fire'' (Section Three - Division A - Certain Basic Statements), 1932, Lucis Trust. 1925, p 1237&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed by Ascended Master Teachings organizations that the Master Jesus was "Chohan of the Sixth Ray" until December 31, 1959, when, according to [[Elizabeth Clare Prophet]], [[Lady Master Nada]] fully took on that Office in the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]]. According to Prophet, Jesus became World Teacher, along with [[Koot Hoomi|Kuthumi]], on January 1, 1956, succeeding [[Maitreya]], who took the Office of "Planetary Buddha" and "Cosmic Christ".&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K. The Law of Life: Book II Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989; pages 267-272&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana: Summit University Press 1986 page 225&lt;/ref&gt; This belief is not accepted by adherents of traditional Theosophy and the followers of Alice A. Bailey and [[Benjamin Creme]]; they believe that the Master Jesus is still the Chohan of the Sixth Ray and that Maitreya is still the World Teacher.

==Previous incarnations==
{{Theosophy}}
According to Elizabeth Clare Prophet, the [[Prophet]] of the [[Church Universal and Triumphant]], the largest Ascended Master Teachings religion, the Master Jesus incarnated twice as the Emperor of Atlantis, once in 33,050 BC and again in 15,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 142-143&lt;/ref&gt; He did this in order to aid the [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|white magicians]] in the war of the white magicians and the [[black magic]]ians that was going on in [[Root race#The civilization of Atlantis|Atlantis]] at that time.

According to Alice A. Bailey, the Master Jesus was previously incarnated as [[Joshua]], the Hebrew military leader in the 13th century BC, and [[Joshua the High Priest]] in the sixth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922--Lucis Publishing Page 56&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ascended Master Teachings,&lt;ref&gt;''I AM Ascended Master Dictation List'' Saint Germain Press Inc., 1995, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schroeder, Werner ''Ascended Masters and Their Retreats'' Ascended Master Teaching Foundation 2004, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luk, A.D.K.. ''Law of Life - Book II''. Pueblo, Colorado: A.D.K. Luk Publications 1989, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity and The Bridge to Freedom&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Annice ''The Masters and Their Retreats '' Summit Lighthouse Library June 2003, Listing of those who are believed to be Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, and The Summit Lighthouse&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shearer, Monroe &amp; Carolyn ''I AM Adorations, Affirmations &amp; Rhythmic Decrees'' Acropolis Sophia Books and Works 1998, Listing of Ascended Masters by The I AM Activity, The Bridge to Freedom, The Summit Lighthouse, and The Temple of The Presence&lt;/ref&gt; Jesus was also incarnated as [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] of the [[coat of many colors]] in the 17th century BC/16th century BC (approximately between 1650 BC and 1550 BC), as well as [[King David]] (who lived c. 1037 BC until around 970 BC), and [[Elisha]] in the 9th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 143&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and birth==
It is believed in the Ascended Master Teachings that Jesus’ father [[Saint Joseph]] was one of the incarnations of [[St. Germain (Theosophy)|St. Germain]], and that his mother [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], upon her [[Assumption of Mary|Assumption]] became either a [[Deva (New Age)|deva]]&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India:1925 The Theosophical Publishing House Page 253&lt;/ref&gt; or an [[archangel]] and is now the twin flame (celestial wife) of the [[Raphael (archangel)|Archangel Raphael]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Mary, Mother of Jesus—Pages  211-217&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, each of the [[Biblical magi|Magi]] who came to visit the baby [[Jesus]] was an incarnation of one of the ascended masters:  [[Saint Caspar|Caspar]], who gave the gift of [[gold]] to Jesus, was an incarnation of [[Djwal Khul]];&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark L. and Elizabeth Clare  ''Lords of the Seven Rays'' Livingston, Montana, U.S.A.:1986 - Summit University Press - Page 33&lt;/ref&gt; Balthasar, who gave the gift of [[frankincense]] to Jesus, was an incarnation of [[Kuthumi]];&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 171&lt;/ref&gt; and Melchior, who gave the gift of [[myrrh]] to Jesus, was an incarnation of [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 88&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Ascended Master Teachings, to prepare for his ministry, Jesus first studied at the ''Brotherhood of [[Luxor]]'' (a [[mystery school]] in [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egypt]]), and then went to India to study under the ''Great Divine Director'', [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]], and ''Lord Himalaya'', the [[Manu (Theosophy)|Manu]] of the [[Root race|Fourth Root Race (Atlantean)]].&lt;ref name="Prophet Page 144"&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 144&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning from India, while living in [[Iudea|Judea]], Jesus worked as a [[carpenter]]; his father Joseph helped him get work because he was a [[general contractor]].

==Ministry==
The followers of Benjamin Creme and Alice A. Bailey believe in the [[Nestorian doctrine|Nestorian]]/[[Gnostic]] [[Christology]], promulgated by [[C.W. Leadbeater]], which asserts that the powerful being known as the [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] overshadowed the Master Jesus during the [[Ministry of Jesus]], such that there were two beings in one body. Maitreya was the [[Christ]] and the Master Jesus was [[Jesus of Nazareth]]; the combination of the two beings functioned as [[Jesus Christ]].&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India: 1925--Theosophical Publishing House Page 278&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission--Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 64&lt;/ref&gt; Those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings believe in the existence of the Maitreya; however, they believe that although he encouraged the mission of Jesus, he did not actually overshadow Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Mark ''Studies of the Human Aura'' Colorado Springs, Colorado: 1975 - Summit University Press (Claimed to have been [[Channeling (mediumistic)|dictated]] from [[Kuthumi]]) Page 17&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crucifixion==
Theosophists and those adherent to the ''Ascended Master Teachings'' alike believe that the Master Jesus underwent the fourth level of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]] (the ''[[crucifixion]]'') at his [[crucifixion]] in [[Jerusalem]]. According to Alice A. Bailey, for most people at the fourth initiation the crucifixion is symbolic as a severe life test of renunciation, but for Jesus it was literal.&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Alice A. ''Initiation, Human and Solar'' New York: 1922 Lucis Publishing Co. Page 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resurrection==
''Ascended Master Teachings'' organizations adhere to the traditional Christian view that Jesus resurrected and ascended with his own physical body. Some with backgrounds in traditional Theosophy, the writings of Alice A. Bailey, and [[Benjamin Creme]] believe that Jesus resurrected from the body that he had when he incarnated as [[Apollonius of Tyana]], although they do believe he ascended on the 3 day—they believe he had a body functioning at the fourth level of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]] when he ascended and not a fifth level body.

==Activities between the resurrection and the ascension==
Traditional theosophists believe that the Master Jesus and Maitreya souls' separated from each other just after the [[Ascension of Jesus|Ascension]] (which for Jesus was only to the fourth and not the fifth level of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]]) and do not believe that the Master Jesus went to Kashmir; they believe he went directly to Shamballa to be with the Lord of the World, [[Sanat Kumara]], for a time, until he then incarnated again soon after as [[Apollonius of Tyana]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission--Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 152&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed in the Ascended Master Teachings that when [[Ascension of Jesus|Jesus ascended]] on the 3rd day after the resurrection, he [[Levitation (paranormal)|levitated]] from [[Iudaea Province|Judaea]] to [[Kashmir]].&lt;ref name="Prophet Page 144"/&gt;

==Day of Pentecost==
In either case, whether he went directly to Shamballa or to Kashmir when he ascended, presumably he [[Teleportation|teleported]] to a location above Judaea briefly ten days later on the 50th day after his resurrection in order to observe from afar the events of the [[Day of Pentecost]] (or possibly he observed these events by [[remote viewing]]). In both traditional Theosophy and the Ascended Master Teachings it is believed that these events were coordinated by the [[Maha Chohan]], who, it is asserted by both C.W. Leadbeater and Elizabeth Clare Prophet, is the representative of the [[Holy Ghost]] on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India:1925 The Theosophical Publishing House Page 255&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Page 200&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities after the day of Pentecost==
In the Ascended Master Teachings, it is believed that the Master Jesus lived in Kashmir until he was 81, and then, assuming he had been born in 6 BC, in AD 75, he [[Entering heaven alive|ascended]] to [[Shamballa]] to be with the Lord of the World, [[Sanat Kumara]].&lt;ref name="Prophet Page 144"/&gt;

==Controversy regarding incarnation as Apollonius of Tyana==
{{Main|Apollonius of Tyana}}
[[Madame Blavatsky|Helena Blavatsky]], a founder of the [[Theosophical Society]], wrote in 1877: "Apollonius, a contemporary of Jesus of Nazareth, was, like him, an enthusiastic founder of a new spiritual school. Perhaps less metaphysical and more practical than Jesus, less tender and perfect in his nature, he nevertheless inculcated the same quintessence of spirituality, and the same high moral truths."&lt;ref&gt;Helena P. Blavatsky: ''Isis Unveiled'', vol. 2, New York 1877 (reprinted 1999), p. 341.&lt;/ref&gt; Some Theosophists such as [[C.W. Leadbeater]] and the teachers of [[Neo-Theosophy]], Alice A. Bailey and Benjamin Creme, have written that the Master Jesus was also incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana after his incarnation as Jesus of Nazareth. It is believed that he attained the fifth level of [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiation]] (the ''[[resurrection]]'') when he became an [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]] at the end of his life as Apollonius of Tyana. However, if Apollonius was a contemporary of Jesus as Blavatsky wrote, Jesus could not have reincarnated as him. Benjamin Creme gets around this by claiming that Jesus lived from 24 BC to AD 9 &lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission Vol. I'' London:1986--Share International Foundation Page 382&lt;/ref&gt; (instead of the usual dates given of Jesus' lifetime as being c. 6 BC to c. AD 30 or AD 33). This means that Jesus ''could'' have incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana, since according to Creme, Apollonius lived from AD 16 to c. AD 97.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission Vol. I'' London:1986--Share International Foundation Page 373&lt;/ref&gt; However, one of the possible chronologies of Apollonius of Tyana's life sometimes cited give his life span as being from AD 40 to AD 120,&lt;ref&gt;For the chronology of AD 40--AD 120 see [[Maria Dzielska]]: ''Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History'', Rome 1986, p. 30-38.&lt;/ref&gt; thus making it possible that, even if the usual dates of Jesus' lifetime are accepted (c. 6 BC to c. AD 30 or AD 33), he ''still'' could have incarnated as Apollonius of Tyana.  However, other modern scholarship, more often cited, gives the dates of Appolonius' life span as c. AD 15 to c. AD 100, thus making it problematic, realistically speaking, that Jesus could have incarnated as him.&lt;ref&gt;For the chronology of AD 15--AD 100 see Maria Dzielska: ''Apollonius of Tyana in Legend and History'', Rome 1986, pp. 30–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus' incarnation as Apollonius of Tyana is accepted by the followers of traditional Theosophy, of Alice A. Bailey, and of Benjamin Creme, but not by those who are adherent to the ''Ascended Master Teachings'', who believe that the incarnation as Jesus was his last embodiment on Earth.

==Incarnation as Ramanuja==
[[C.W. Leadbeater]] stated that the Master Jesus, after his resurrection in the body of Apollonius of Tyana, incarnated in India as the [[Tamil people|Tamil]] religious reformer [[Ramanuja]], a leading figure within the [[Bhakti movement]] in [[Hinduism]]; thus, by incarnating as Ramanuja, Jesus became an [[Avatar]]. According to Leadbeater, the Master Jesus incarnated as Ramanuja as part of his spiritual work as Master of the Sixth Ray of Love-Devotion (''bhakti'' is the [[Sanskrit]] word for ''devotion'').&lt;ref&gt;Leadbeater, C.W. ''The Masters and the Path'' Adyar, Madras, India:1925 Theosophical Publishing House Page 239&lt;/ref&gt;

That Jesus incarnated as Ramanuja is believed by many traditional Theosophists, but not by those adherent to the Ascended Master Teachings.

==Benjamin Crème's views==
According to [[Benjamin Creme]], the Master Jesus visited the [[Americas]] (as well as [[Polynesia]]) not immediately after his resurrection as recounted in the [[Book of Mormon]], but in the late 7th century and early 8th century, after having descended to the continent of America from his dwelling place in Shamballah with Sanat Kumara.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission--Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 378&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Mormons]], Creme believes that this visit gave rise to the legend of [[Quetzalcoatl]].

Benjamin Crème asserted that, in the late 1970s, the Master Jesus appeared to [[Spencer W. Kimball]], then [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in the [[Washington D.C. Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission--Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 304&lt;/ref&gt;

Creme stated that since 1990 the Master Jesus has been living in secret in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Creme, Benjamin ''Maitreya's Mission--Volume III'' Amsterdam:1997 Share International Foundation Page 46&lt;/ref&gt; After [[Maitreya (Theosophy)|Maitreya]] makes his [[Share International|Emergence]] (the ''Day of Declaration''), Creme asserted, the Master Jesus in his [[Immortality|immortal]] body will assume the [[Papacy|papal throne]] for the next 2,000 years of the [[Age of Aquarius]].

==Master Jesus' retreat==
According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the Master Jesus has a sumptuous retreat (residence on the etheric plane) above [[Jerusalem]] called the ''Resurrection Temple''.  Often his mother Mary (now married to the Archangel Raphael, as noted above, and serving the Solar Logos with him in the [[solar corona]]) descends to serve with him at the Resurrection Temple doing sacred rituals and answering prayers.&lt;ref name="Prophet Page 144"/&gt;

==Twin flame==
Ascended Master Teachings groups describe the Master Jesus as having a ''[[twin flame]]'' (celestial spouse) named '''[[Lady Master Magda]]''', one of whose two known incarnations was [[Mary Magdalene]]; the other was [[Aimee Semple McPherson]].&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Lady Master Magda Pages 196-200&lt;/ref&gt;

==John the Beloved==
According to the Ascended Master Teachings, the Ascended Master '''[[John the Beloved]]''', who was Jesus’ best friend during his lifetime, has a retreat (residence on the etheric plane) above [[Arizona]] where he teaches a variety of [[Left-hand path and right-hand path|white magic]] that involves the mastery of the [[elemental spirits]] governing the realms of earth, air, water, and fire.  It is believed that the Master Jesus often teleports over to John the Beloved's retreat to say hello to his old friend.&lt;ref&gt;Prophet, Elizabeth Clare and Prophet, Mark (as compiled by Annice Booth) ''The Masters and Their Retreats'' Corwin Springs, Montana:2003 Summit University Press Pages 146-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aetherius Society==
In the teachings of the [[Aetherius Society]], headquartered in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]], it is promulgated that since his resurrection, the Master Jesus has been dwelling mostly on the [[Plane (esotericism)|higher planes]] of Venus in order to work with the '''[[Aetherius Society#Founding|Master Aetherius]]''', but when his presence is required, he [[Teleportation|teleports]] to or takes a [[flying saucer]] to Earth as needed.&lt;ref&gt;[[George King (Aetherius Society)|King, George]], (1996) ''Contacts With The Gods From Space'', [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California]], The [[Aetherius Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sananda==
The noted Ascended Master Teachings teacher [[Joshua David Stone]] (whose organization, the I AM University, was originally headquartered near [[San Luis Obispo, California]]), began holding his [[Wesak]] [[Mount Shasta]] gatherings in 1996.  Stone had begun teaching in 1993, based on the early 1980s revelations of [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)#Tuella|Tuella]], that the Master Jesus, under his [[Milky Way Galaxy|galactic]] name "Sananda" (the name, Stone stated, he adopted after his resurrection), works with [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Commander Ashtar]], flying with [[Pallas Athena]] in their own flying saucer within the [[Ascended master#Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Earth|Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet]] as its Commander-in-Chief.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Joshua David ''Cosmic Ascension: Your Cosmic Map Home'' (March 1998) (Book 6 of the multi-volume series ''The Easy-To-Read Encyclopedia of the Spiritual Path''). {{ISBN|0-929385-99-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stone, another name used by Commander Ashtar to denote his flying saucer fleet is "The Airborne Division of the Great White Brotherhood".&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091021063637/http://www.iamuniversity.org/iamu/mobile/literature/lodges/spiritual_extraterrestrials_lodge/3661-The-Ashtar-Command.html "The Ashtar Command", by Joshua David Stone:]&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed that Ashtar is originally from a planet called Ashtar, but he moved to Venus thousands of years ago.  It is said that he formed the Ashtar Galactic Command Flying Saucer Fleet at the beginning of the [[Atomic Age]] in 1945 and that in the early 1980s, at the behest of [[Sanat Kumara]], Sananda (the Master Jesus) and Pallas Athena took over command of the fleet.  Stone continued to present these teachings after 1996 at the yearly Wesak Mount Shasta gatherings.

According to the Ascended Master Teachings teacher Sheldan Nidle, who resides in the [[gold country]] in the foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in [[California]], the Earth base of the Ashtar Galactic Command is known as the New Jerusalem or "Shan Chea". It is a square rotating space station with artificial gravity in constant orbit around Earth on the etheric plane, with orbit distances varying from approximately {{convert|500|mi}} to {{convert|1500|mi}}. It is a large space station with a population of thousands of etheric beings. In the center of this square space station is a sphere connected by four tubes to the square outer ring of the space station. This sphere houses the Inn of Heaven, the command headquarters of Sananda, Lady Master Athena, and Ashtar. There is also a smaller round space station called "Schare" or "Share", where the individual flying saucers of the fleet piloted by those at the higher levels of the fleet command hierarchy dock to receive their orders and review their missions. Within the Inn of Heaven is a private retreat for Sananda (the Master Jesus) in addition to his retreat above Jerusalem. The Master Jesus has a landing pad for his flying saucer at his Jerusalem retreat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashtarcommandcrew.net/page/galactic-federation-fleets Ashtar Command Crew website--Galactic Confederation Fleets--Description of the components of the ''Ashtar Galactic Command'' by ''Lady Master Athena'', dictated thru Sheldan Nidle 25 June 2002 and Littlejohn 8 February 1989; also Mike Quinsey, summarizing the early 1980s revelations of Tuella :]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Airborne Division of the Brotherhood of Light==
Lourene Altiery, also known as ''Karita'' to her followers, is an Ascended Master Teachings teacher originally from [[Joliet, Illinois]] who now resides in [[Sun Lakes, Arizona]].  She set up her website in 2001.  Like Joshua David Stone and Luis Prada,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luisprada.com/ Website of Luis Prada--many people obtain their knowledge of the Ascended Master Teachings through Luis Prada's "Brother Veritus" Website--Prada's teachings are very close to those of Joshua David Stone--Prada is originally from Colombia where he worked as an Electrical Engineer for an oil refinery--he moved to the U.S. in 1985--he worked in Silicon Valley for many years--he set up his website in  1997 and registered the domain in 1998.:]&lt;/ref&gt; Altiery also teaches that Sananda has taken over as the Commander of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet with his co-commandress Pallas Athena and that Ashtar is now second in command.  She also teaches that an alternate name used by Commander Sananda to denote the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet is ''The Airborne Division of the Brotherhood of Light''.&lt;ref&gt;Altiery, Lourene (Karita) The World's Greatest Teachings by Christ the Master and Other Avatars, Telepathically Communicated to Karita 2002 {{ISBN|0-9718008-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serversofall.com/ Servers of All web page (Lourene Altiery):]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lorune.com/ World Global Express—Lourene Altieri master link website:]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Lourene Altieri has revealed the names of and [[Channeling (mediumistic)|channeled]] information from some of the other prominent beings who she says travel with Commander Sananda, Pallas Athena, Ashtar, and Vrillon on the saucers of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet. These include :-

'''Aleph Nero''', who's the main commander.

'''Aaron Alaje James''', sub-commander of one of the wings of the fleet, working with a human from Earth, known as Miss '''Megan Sebastian''' who is visiting [[Earth]] to raise the consciousness of humanity and uplift the vibrations of Planet Gaia and [[Agartha]]. Also known as '''Megha''' or ''Meg'' from Alcorn, contributing to Stability and Peace over the Planet Om, and the Princess/Prayer Maiden of the Planet Anova.

'''Korton''', captain of the flying saucer, the fleet communications officer in charge of maintaining [[Subspace radio|subspace communications]] for the fleet.

'''Esola''', captain of the flying saucer ''Starship #77''.

'''Merku''', of the planet Alcorn, subcommander of one of the wings of the fleet.

'''Soltec''', captain of the [[geophysics]] science survey flying saucer ''Phoenix''.

'''Voltra''', the "space [[psychologist]]", who monitors the "[[Chakras|vibratory level]] of [[Human race|humanity]]".

'''Kla-La''', "master of [[force]] [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]".

'''Hatonn''', who monitors events on Earth for the ''Galactic Hall of Records'' at the [[galactic Center|galactic core]] and the '''[[Athena|Lady Master Athena]]''', the ''twin flame'' (celestial wife) of the [[Maha Chohan]]; Altieri teaches that the Lady Master Athena often personally accompanies Commander Sananda on board his command flying saucer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serversofall.com/ Servers of All web page (Lourene Altiery)—Images of the beings described above are depicted on this web page:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[Ascended Master Teachings|Ascended Master on Earth]]==
'''Aaron Johnson James''' (sometimes called '''Lancelot)''' is the name given to an extraterrestrial being, a [[Nordic alien]] with whom some number of people claim to have had contact. He might be from the [[Great White Brotherhood]], which is also known as the Great Brotherhood of Light or the Spiritual Hierarchy of Earth, which is perceived as being a spiritual organization composed of those [[Ascended master#Cosmic beings said to be patrolling near Earth|Ascended Masters]] who have risen from the Earth into immortality, but who still maintain an active watch over the habitable worlds. The Great White Brotherhood also includes members of the Heavenly Host (the [[Spiritual Hierarchy]] directly concerned with the evolution of our world), [[Ascended master#Cosmic beings on Venus|Beneficent Members from other planets]]. He may be connected to Modern [[Rosicrucianism]] and the [[Ascended master|Ascended Master]] Teachings, responsible for the [[New Age]] culture of the [[Age of Aquarius]], and also to the UFO Religion [[Aetherius Society]], whose headquarters is in Hollywood, Los Angeles, California, although the 26 November 1977 [[Southern Television broadcast interruption]] must have a connection with his disappearance. Lancelot is currently working with ''Jesus Christ'' and [[Ashtar (extraterrestrial being)|Ashtar]] in the [[Master Jesus#Airborne Division of the Brotherhood of Light|Airborne Division of the Brotherhood of Light]], Sub-Commander of the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet, "working towards raising the consciousness of humanity and uplifting the vibrations of planet Earth", [[Angel#Interaction with angels|Angels]] Teachings, The Master and the Path and is the representative of the Holy Ghost on Earth. Lancelot is said to be an [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] from the planet called Alcorn, which operates in the fourth sector of the Milky Way Galaxy – Olega, Quadra. He is said to be the crowned Prince of Alcorn, but for some reason he ran away from his [[planet]] and since then he is trespassing on [[earth]] and lives secretly in [[Agartha]]; he is working with the [[celestial beings]] whom [[humans]] worship as [[Gods|God]] on earth. Lancelot has a Nordic/Angelic (human-like) appearance and originates from the system that orbits The Constellation of Pleiades.

==Hatonn and the photon belt==
According to the Ascended Master Teachings of Anne Bellringer of [[Rapid City, South Dakota]], the work of '''Hatonn'''
feeding information about events on Earth via subspace relay to the [[supercomputer]]s at the "Galactic Hall of Records" is secondary to  Hatonn's primary task (Hatonn is, she states, a Pleiadean), which is functioning as the [[liaison officer]] between [[Sanat Kumara]] and the [[Pleiadeans]] for the Ashtar Galactic Command flying saucer fleet in order for him to be able to help Earth safely navigate through the approaching [[photon belt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hatonnspeaksthetruth.wordpress.com/2010/01/25/hatonn-introduction-to-the-photon-belt/ Hatonn and the Photon Belt:]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fourwinds10.com/siterun_static/general/about_fourwinds.php Four Winds10.com—website of Anne Bellringer:]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skeptical view==
The scholar [[K. Paul Johnson]] maintains that the "Masters" that [[Madame Blavatsky]] wrote about and produced letters from were actually idealizations of people who were her [[mentor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Paul K. Initiates of Theosophical Masters Albany, New York:1995 State University of New York Press&lt;/ref&gt; In an article in the New York Times, Paul Zweig maintains that Madame Blavatsky's revelations were fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;"Talking to the Dead and Other Amusements" by Paul Zweig ''New York Times'' October 5, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Master Jesus was never one of the "Masters" that Madame Blavatsky claimed to have met. He was added as a "Master" by [[Annie Besant]] and [[C.W. Leadbeater]] in their 1913 book ''[[Man: Whence, How and Whither]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Besant, Annie and Leadbeater, C.W. ''Man: How, Whence, and Whither?'' Adyar, India:1913 Theosophical Publishing House Page Page 133&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
'''[[Panelology]]'''
* In the 1973 [[underground comics|underground comic book]] titled ''Occult Laff-Parade'', [[cartoonist]] [[Jay Kinney]] drew a [[comic strip]] in which the Master Jesus is portrayed as commanding a [[flying saucer]] fleet orbiting Earth looking for evil-doers. He is shown as being dressed in a [[military uniform]] with a [[crew cut]] and having the title ''Commander Jesus''[http://archives.weirdload.com/art/spacejc2.gif].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weirdload.com/vat-ufo3.html Source of image of Jay Kinney’s depiction of Commander Jesus--"Jay Nelson’s Weird Load--Strange Thoughts for Strange Times":]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Occult Laff-Parade'' San Francisco:1973 The Print Mint-—See 4-page comic strip by Jay Kinney and Ned Sonntag entitled "Bud Tuttle and Commander Jesus". It was a [[satire]] of a series of UFO messages from the Master Jesus that had been allegedly channeled by a woman named Nada Yolanda.

'''Mental age''' is a concept related to [[intelligence]].  It looks at how a specific child, at a specific age—usually today, now—performs intellectually, compared to average intellectual performance for that physical age, measured in years.  The physical age of the child is compared to the intellectual performance of the child, based on performance in tests and live assessments by a psychologist.  Scores achieved by the child in question are compared to scores in the middle of a bell curve for children of the same age &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apa.org/research/action/glossary.aspx#m |title=Glossary of Psychological Terms | publisher=American Psychological Association (From Gerrig, Richard J. &amp; Philip G. Zimbardo. Psychology And Life, 16/e. Published by Allyn and Bacon, Boston, MA. 2002. Pearson Education.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, mental age varies according to what kind of intelligence is measured.  A child's intellectual age can be average for his physical age but the same child's [[emotional intelligence]] can be immature for his physical age.  In this psychologists often remark girls are more emotionally mature than boys in the tween years.   Also, a six-year-old child intellectually gifted in Piaget terms can remain a three-year-old child in terms of emotional maturity.&lt;ref&gt;L.K. Silverman, 1997. "Asynchronous development" is now an accepted aspect of maturation. ''Peabody Journal of Education'', Vol. 72 Issue 3/4&lt;/ref&gt; Mental age was once considered a controversial concept.&lt;ref&gt;*Thurstone LL. [http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Thurstone/Thurstone_1926.html The Mental Age Concept.] ''Psychological Review'' 33 (1926): 268-278.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early theories===
During much of the nineteenth century, theories of intelligence focused on measuring the size of human skulls.&lt;ref name="autogenerated441"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Stoslopf |first=Alan |authorlink= |editor-first1= Eugene R. |editor-last1= Provenzo Jr. |editor-first2= Asterie B. |editor-last2= Provenzo  |editor-link= |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of the social and cultural foundations of education |title= Theories of Intelligence |trans-title=|accessdate= 25 March 2014 |language= |edition= |date= 16 December 2009 |publisher= SAGE Publications, Inc. |volume= |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |id= |isbn= 9781412963992|oclc= |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781412963992|pages= 441–444 |quote= |ref= |doi=10.4135/9781412963992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologist well known for their attempts in correlating cranial size and capacity with intellectual potential are [[Samuel Morton]] and [[Paul Broca]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated441"/&gt;

The modern theories of intelligence began to emerge along with experimental psychology. This is when much of psychology
was moving from philosophical to more biology and medical science basis. In 1890, [[James Cattell]] published what some 
consider the first "mental test". Cattell was more focused on heredity rather than environment. This spurs much
of the debate about the nature of intelligence.&lt;ref name="autogenerated441"/&gt;  
 
Mental age was first defined by the French psychologist [[Alfred Binet]], who introduced the intelligence test in 1905, with the assistance of [[Theodore Simon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = | first = | author-link = | editor-last = | editor-first = | title = Encyclopædia Britannica.| volume = | pages = | publisher = Encyclopædia Britannica Online| place = | year = |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/375337/mental-age}}&lt;/ref&gt; Binet's experiments on French schoolchildren laid the framework for future experiments into the mind throughout the Twentieth Century. He created an experiment that was designed as a test to be completed quickly and was taken by various ages of children. As was expected, the older children performed better on these tests. However, the younger children who had exceeded the average of their peers were said to have a higher "mental age" and those who performed below average were deemed to have a lower mental age. Binet's theories suggested that while mental age was a useful indicator, it was by no means permanently affixed and individual growth or decline could be attributed to changes in teaching methods and experiences.&lt;ref name="autogenerated441"/&gt;

[[Henry Herbert Goddard]] was the first psychologist to bring Binet's test to the United States. Goddard was amongst one of the many psychologists in the 1910s that believed intelligence was a fixed quantity. While Binet believed this wasn't the case, the majority of those in the U.S believed it was hereditary.&lt;ref name="autogenerated441"/&gt;

===Modern theories===
The limitations of the Stanford-Binet caused [[David Wechsler]] to publish the [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]] (WAIS) in 
1955. These two tests were split into two different ones for children. The WAIS-IV is the known current publication of the test
for adults. The reason for this test was to score the individual and compare it to others of the same age 
group rather than to score by chronological age and mental age.  The fixed average is 100 and the normal range is between 
85 and 115. This is a standard currently used and is used in the Stanford-Binet test as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cherry | first = Kendra | title = History of Intelligence Testing | url = http://psychology.about.com/od/psychologicaltesting/a/int-history.htm| accessdate = 8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mental age and IQ==
Originally, the differences between mental age and chronological age were used to compute the [[intelligence quotient]], or IQ. This was computed using the ratio method, with the following formula: 
:: mental age ÷ Physical age × 100 = IQ 
No matter what the child's chronological age, if the mental age is the same as the chronological age, then the IQ will equal 100.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ipfw.edu/abbott/120/IntelligenceTests.html |title=Intelligence Tests |publisher=Users.ipfw.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern intelligence tests, including the current Stanford-Binet test, no longer compute scores using the IQ formula. Instead, intelligence tests give a score that reflects how far the person's performance deviates from the average performance of others who are the same age, arbitrarily defined as an average score of 100.&lt;ref name="Stoslopf 444–446"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last= Stoslopf |first=Alan |authorlink= |editor-first1= Eugene R. |editor-last1= Provenzo Jr. |editor-first2= Asterie B. |editor-last2= Provenzo  |editor-link= |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of the social and cultural foundations of education |title= Theories of Intelligence |trans-title=|accessdate= 25 March 2014 |language= |edition= |date= 16 December 2009 |publisher= SAGE Publications, Inc. |volume= |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |id= |isbn= 9781412963992|oclc= |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781412963992|pages= 444–446 |quote= |ref= |doi=10.4135/9781412963992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Similarities===

===Differences===
An IQ or [[intelligence quotient]], is a score derived from one of several different standardized tests designed to assess intelligence. The mental age is the age group which scored such a result on average.

==Controversy==
===The Nature of intelligence===
Mental age, as well as IQ, have limitations. Binet did not believe these measures should be used for a single, permanent, and inborn level of intelligence. He stressed the limitation of the test because intelligence overall is too broad to be represented by a single number. It is influenced by many factors such as the individual's background and changes over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Cherry | first = Kendra | title = History of Intelligence Testing | url =http://psychology.about.com/od/psychologicaltesting/a/int-history.htm| accessdate = 8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout much of the 20th century, many psychologists believed intelligence was fixed and hereditary while others believed other factors would affect intelligence.

After World War I, the concept of intelligence as fixed, hereditary, and unchangeable became the dominant theory within 
the experimental psychological community. By the mid-1930s, there was no longer agreement among researchers on whether or not
intelligence was hereditary. There are still recurring debates about the influence of environment and heredity upon an individual's 
intelligence.&lt;ref name="Stoslopf 444–446"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3597">'''Moral blindness''' is a state of unawareness or insensibility to moral issues pertaining both to oneself and to one's relations to others. [[George Eliot]] considered that "We are all of us born in moral stupidity, taking the world as an udder to feed our supreme selves".&lt;ref&gt;George Eliot, ''Middlemarch'' (1974) p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Healthy development leads away from early [[egotism]] to produce greater levels of awareness,&lt;ref&gt;R. Skynner/J. Cleese, ''Life and how to survive it'' (1994) p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; leading to degrees of what [[Abraham Maslow]] called "lesser blindness".&lt;ref&gt;J. Loevinger, ''Ego Development'' (1976) p. 418&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics question whether "moral blindness" is ever more than a useful weapon of debate with which to charge one's opponents.&lt;ref&gt;A. Edel, ''Ethical Judgement'' (1955) p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical views==
Philosophically, moral blindness has been explored from [[Plato]]'s tyrant onwards, through [[Epitectus]] and [[Kant]], but came into full prominence with [[Ethical intuitionism]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Edel, ''Moral Judgement'' (1955) p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Figures like [[G. E. Moore]] argued for a "direct moral awareness"&lt;ref&gt;I. Ousby ed., ''The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English'' (1995) p. 645&lt;/ref&gt; and saw moral blindness as the equivalent of colour blindness.&lt;ref&gt;A. Edel, ''Moral Judgement'' (1955) p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developmental views==
[[Melanie Klein]] saw early development in terms of the child slowly emerging from a state of [[narcissism|narcissistic]] blindness to recognise the motherer as a moral end in herself, not simply as the child's means or tool—a step she called the [[depressive position]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Phillips, ''On Flirtation'' (1994) p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; [[D. W. Winnicott]] similarly saw the infant as moving from {{Clarification needed|text=pre-ruth to ruth|date=May 2016}}—from an unconcerned use of the mother to concerned usage.&lt;ref&gt;P. Casement, ''Further Learning from the Patient'' (1997) p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;

==Postmodern amplifications==
[[Zygmunt Bauman]] considers certain features of 21st century society to actively promote moral blindness. A valorisation of commodities as ephemeral and exchangeable combines with the effect of [[internet]] anonymity to create a culture that tends to ignore of the particularity of the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Z. Bauman/L. Doaskis, ''Moral Blindness'' (2014)   p. 11-5&lt;/ref&gt; Equally pernicious is the extension of a calculus of gain over ever-wider areas of life, to the exclusion of moral evaluation&lt;ref&gt;Z. Bauman/L. Doaskis, ''Moral Blindness'' (2014) p. 16 and p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;—the unchallenged moral blindness of the market.&lt;ref&gt;S. Best, ''A Beginner's Guide to Social Theory'' (2003) p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary analogies==
* [[Dante]] has been interpreted as showing vices leading to moral blindness, virtues to moral imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Pucka, ''Moral Development'' (1994) p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Iain M. Banks]] wrote of "the moral equivalent of black holes, where the normal laws—the rules of right and wrong that people imagine apply everywhere else in the universe—break down".&lt;ref&gt;Iain M. Banks, ''Use of Weapons'' (1990) p. 261&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Criminal defenses}}

In the [[criminal law]] of many nations, '''necessity''' may be either a possible [[Justification (jurisprudence)|justification]] or an exculpation for breaking the [[law]]. [[Defendant]]s seeking to rely on this [[defense (legal)|defense]] argue that they should not be held [[liable]] for their [[action (philosophy)|actions]] as a [[crime]] because their conduct was ''necessary'' to prevent some greater harm and when that conduct is not excused under some other more specific provision of law such as [[self defense]]. Except for a few statutory exemptions and in some medical cases&lt;ref&gt;See Re A (Conjoined Twins: Surgical Separation) [2001] Fam 147&lt;/ref&gt; there is no corresponding defense in [[Necessity in English law#History|English law]] for murder.&lt;ref&gt;See [[R v Dudley and Stephens]] [1884] 14 QBD 273 and R v Howe [1987] 1 AC 417&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a drunk driver might contend that he drove his car to get away from a [[kidnap]] (cf. ''[[North by Northwest#Plot|North by Northwest]]'').  Most [[common law]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction]]s recognize this defense, but only under limited circumstances. Generally, the defendant must affirmatively show (i.e., introduce some evidence) that (a) the harm he sought to avoid outweighs the danger of the prohibited conduct he is charged with; (b) he had no reasonable alternative; (c) he ceased to engage in the prohibited conduct as soon as the danger passed; and (d) he did not himself create the danger he sought to avoid.  Thus, with the "drunk driver" example cited above, the necessity defense will not be recognized if the defendant drove further than was reasonably necessary to get away from the kidnapper, or if some other reasonable alternative was available to him.

==General discussion==
As a matter of political expediency, states usually allow some classes of person to be excused from liability when they are engaged in socially useful functions but intentionally cause injury, loss or damage. For example, the [[fire service]]s and other [[civil defence]] [[organization]]s have a general duty to keep the [[community]] safe from harm. If a fire or flood is threatening to spread out of control, it may be reasonably necessary to destroy other property to form a [[fire break]], or to trespass on land to throw up mounds of earth to prevent the water from spreading. These examples have the common feature of individuals intentionally breaking the law because they believe it to be urgently necessary to protect others from harm, but some states distinguish between a response to a crisis arising from an entirely natural cause (an inanimate force of nature), e.g. a fire from a lightning strike or rain from a storm, and a response to an entirely human crisis. Thus, [[parent]]s who lack the financial means to feed their [[child]]ren cannot use necessity as a defense if they steal food. The existence of welfare benefits and strategies other than self-help defeat the claim of an urgent necessity that cannot be avoided in any way other than by breaking the law. Further, some states apply a test of proportionality. So the defense would only be allowed where the degree of harm actually caused was a reasonably proportionate response to the degree of harm threatened. This is a legal form of [[cost–benefit analysis]].

==Specific jurisdictions==
*[[Necessity in English law|England]]
*[[Necessity in Canadian law|Canada]]
*[[Necessity in International law|International]]

===Denmark and Norway===
Emergency law/right (''nødret'', ''nødrett'') is the equivalent of necessity in Denmark and Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=113401 Straffeloven] på [[Retsinformation]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-20050520-028.html#17 Straffeloven av 2005 § 17]&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered related to but separate from self-defence. Common legal examples of necessity includes: breaking windows and other objects in order to escape a fire, commandeering a vehicle to serve as an emergency ambulance, ignoring traffic rules while rushing a dying patient to a hospital, and even killing a person who poses an immediate threat to several other people not including yourself. In the last case self-defense laws are not enough, but the case is covered by ''nødret''. ''Nødret'' can only be invoked though when no other option is available.

===International law===

====Customary international law====
Under international law, an obligation of [[customary international law]] or an obligation granted under a bilateral investment treaty may be suspended under the doctrine of necessity. It is "an exception from illegality and in certain cases even as an exception from responsibility." ''See Continental Casualty Company v Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No ARB/03/09.'' 
In order to invoke the doctrine of necessity:
(1) The invoking State must not have contributed to the state of necessity,
(2) Actions taken were the only way to safeguard an essential interest from grave and impending danger.
''Id. at page 72, paragraph 165.''

===Taiwan, Republic of China===
Necessity is a possible defense per the Criminal Code&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=C0000001&amp;DF=&amp;SNo=24 Article 24 of the Criminal Code of the Republic of China].&lt;/ref&gt; and the Administrative Penalty Act.&lt;ref&gt;[http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawSearchNo.aspx?PC=A0030210&amp;DF=&amp;SNo=13 Article 13 of Administrative Penalty Act].&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Necessity as a defense to criminal acts conducted to meet political ends was rejected in the case of ''United States v. Schoon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The demise of the political necessity defense: indirect civil  disobedience and United States v. Schoon|year=1993|author=Cavallaro, James L., Jr.|publisher=University of California Press|issn=0008-1221}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that case, 30 people, including appellants, gained admittance to the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] office  in Tucson, where they chanted "keep America's tax dollars out of El  Salvador," splashed simulated blood on the counters, walls, and  carpeting, and generally obstructed the office's operation. The court ruled that the elements of necessity did not exist in this case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=U.S. v. Schoon|reporter=F2d|vol=939|opinion=826|date=July 29, 1991|url=http://openjurist.org/939/f2d/826/united-states-v-d-schoon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====In specific states====
* [[Necessity defense (Kansas)|Kansas]]
* [[Necessity defense (New York)|New York]]

===Singapore===
Necessity is a defence per the Penal Code&lt;ref&gt;[http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=85fe891c-9489-47a0-a0c2-15a8a9fb92c9;page=0;query=DocId%3A%22025e7646-947b-462c-b557-60aa55dc7b42%22%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0;rec=0#pr81-he-. Section 81 of the Penal Code of Singapore.]&lt;/ref&gt;.
This requires lack of criminal intent, good faith (due care and attention&lt;ref&gt;[http://statutes.agc.gov.sg/aol/search/display/view.w3p;ident=4933180d-0e2b-4808-bcb8-1e276b9522b4;page=0;query=DocId%3A%22025e7646-947b-462c-b557-60aa55dc7b42%22%20Status%3Ainforce%20Depth%3A0;rec=0#pr52-he-. Section 52 of the Penal Code of Singapore.]&lt;/ref&gt;), and the goal of preventing harm. The harm must be sufficiently serious and imminent to justify or excuse the act.

==Canada==

In Canada, Necessity is recognized as a defence for crimes committed in urgent situations of clear and imminent peril in which the accused has no safe or legal way out of the situation. 

Three Requirements for defence of necessity:
(1) Urgent situation of imminent peril or danger 
(2) No reasonable legal alternative
(3) Proportionality between harm inflicted and harm avoided

It should also be noted that the first and second element are evaluated on the modified objective standard. The third element is evaluated on a purely objective standard. [[R v Latimer]], 2001 SCC 1

== In religious law ==
In Judaism, the principle of ''[[pikuach nefesh]]'' allows any law to be broken to save a life, except laws against murder, adultery/incest and idolatry.

{{nihongo|'''On Kawara'''|河原 温|Kawara On|December 24, 1932 – July 10, 2014}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[conceptual art]]ist who lived in [[New York City]] from 1965. He took part in many solo and group [[Art exhibition|exhibitions]], including the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1976.

==Early life==
Kawara was born in Kariya, Japan on December 24, 1932. After graduating from Kariya High School in 1951, Kawara moved to [[Tokyo]]. Kawara went to Mexico in 1959, where his father was the director of an engineering company. He stayed three years, painting, attending art school and exploring the country.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (July 15, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/07/16/arts/design/on-kawara-conceptual-artist-who-found-elegance-in-every-day-dies-at-81.html On Kawara, Artist Who Found Elegance in Every Day, Dies at 81] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1962 to 1964 he moved back and forth between New York and Paris.&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"&gt;[[Roberta Smith]] (February 5, 2015), [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/06/arts/design/the-guggenheim-shows-first-on-kawara-retrospective.html A Life Captivated by the Wonder of Time: The Guggenheim Shows First On Kawara Retrospective] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled through Europe before settling in 1965 in [[New York City]], where he was an intermittent resident until his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/artist.php?artist_id=3030 On Kawara] MoMA Collection.

==Work==
Kawara belonged to a broadly international generation of [[Conceptual art]]ists that began to emerge in the mid-1960s, stripping art of personal emotion, reducing it to nearly pure information or idea and greatly playing down the art object. Along with [[Lawrence Weiner]], [[Joseph Kosuth]], [[Hanne Darboven]] and others, Kawara gave special prominence to language.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

===''Paris-New York Drawings''===
From 1962 to 1964 Kawara made about 200 ''Paris-New York Drawings''. Their motifs include stripes and grids like those of the Minimalist painter [[Agnes Martin]].&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"/&gt; Other drawings depict installation pieces that fill rooms with networks of string.&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"/&gt;

===''Today'' series===
[[File:Oct 31, 1973 (Today Series, "Tuesday") On Kawara.JPG|thumb|''Today'' Series date painting at [[Art Institute of Chicago]].]]
From January 4, 1966,&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"/&gt; Kawara made a long series of "[[calendar date|Date]] paintings" (the ''Today'' series), which consist entirely of the date on which the painting was executed in simple white lettering set against a solid background. The date is always documented in the language and grammatical conventions of the country in which the painting is executed (i.e., “26. ÁG. 1995,” from [[Reykjavik]], Iceland, or “13 JUIN 2006,” from [[Monte Carlo]]);&lt;ref&gt;Karen Rosenberg (February 2, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/arts/design/on-kawaras-date-painting-s-at-david-zwirner-gallery.html On Kawara’s ‘Date Painting(s)’ at David Zwirner Gallery] ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Esperanto is used when the first language of a given country does not use the Roman alphabet.&lt;ref name="zwirner"&gt;[http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions-2/current-exhibitions/ On Kawara: Date Painting(s) in New York and 136 Other Cities, January 6 – February 11, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202122107/http://www.davidzwirner.com/exhibitions-2/current-exhibitions/ |date=February 2, 2012 }} [[David Zwirner Gallery]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paintings, executed in [[Liquitex]] on canvas, conform to one of eight standard sizes, ranging from 8x10 inches to 61x89 inches,&lt;ref name="On Kawara, May 1, 1987 1987"&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/lot/on-kawara-may-1-1987-4913736-details.aspx?pos=3&amp;intObjectID=4913736&amp;sid=&amp;page=4 On Kawara, ''May 1, 1987'' (1987)] [[Christie's]] Post-War and Contemporary Art Evening Sale, 16 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; all horizontal in orientation. The exceptions are the three paintings, roughly five by seven feet, executed on July 16, 20 and 21, 1969 — three days when the world was riveted by the [[Apollo 11|moon landing]].&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"/&gt;

The dates on the paintings, hand-painted with calculated precision,&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Searle]] (December 3, 2002), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/dec/03/art.artsfeatures It's a date!] ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; are always centered on the canvas and painted white, whereas the background colors vary; the paintings from the early years tend to have bold colors, and the more recent ones tend to be darker in tone. For example, Kawara briefly used red for several months in 1967 and then returned to darker hues until 1977. Four coats of paint are carefully applied for the ground and each allowed enough time to dry before being rubbed down in preparation for subsequent coats.&lt;ref name="On Kawara, May 1, 1987 1987"/&gt; Eschewing stencils in favor of hand-drawn characters, Kawara skillfully renders the script, initially a [[sans-serif]], elongated version of [[Gill Sans]], later a quintessentially modernist [[Futura (typeface)|Futura]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gms.be/index.php?content=artist_detail&amp;id_artist=30 On Kawara] Galerie Micheline Szwajcer, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Each work is carefully executed by hand. Some days he made more than one.&lt;ref name="diacenter"&gt;[http://www.diacenter.org/exhibitions/artistbio/86 On Kawara - Artist Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927044942/http://www.diacenter.org/exhibitions/artistbio/86 |date=2011-09-27 }} Dia Art Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt; When Kawara was unable to complete the painting on the day it was started he immediately destroyed it.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; When a ''Date Painting'' is not exhibited, it is placed in a cardboard box custom-made for the painting, which is lined with a clipping from a local newspaper from the city in which the artist made the painting; most clippings are from ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"/&gt; Although the boxes are part of the work, they are rarely exhibited. Each year between 63 and 241 paintings were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/press-release-1999.pdf On Kawara: I Read 1966-1995, March 20 - April 17, 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301025018/http://www.davidzwirner.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/press-release-1999.pdf |date=March 1, 2014 }} [[David Zwirner Gallery]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each ''Date Painting'' is registered in a journal and marked on a ''One Hundred Years Calendar''. When Kawara finished a painting, he applied a swatch of the paint mixture he used to a small rectangle that was then glued onto a chart in the journal. Under each colour is a number showing the painting's sequence in that year and a letter indicating its size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/exhibitions/colourchart/artists/kawara.shtm On Kawara] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107004315/http://www.tate.org.uk/liverpool/exhibitions/colourchart/artists/kawara.shtm |date=2011-01-07 }} Tate Liverpool, ''Colour Chart: Reinventing Colour, 1950 to Today'', 29 May – 13 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The 48 journals&lt;ref name="February 5, 2015"/&gt; therefore record the details of the painting’s size, color and newspaper headline, while the calendar uses colored dots to indicate the days in which a painting was made, and to record the number of days since the artist’s birth. Kawara created nearly 3,000 date paintings&lt;ref name="wsj.com"&gt;Marc Myers (January 30, 2015), [https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-guggenheim-show-silence-spans-on-kawaras-career-1422655735 The Guggenheim Show ‘Silence’ Spans Kawara’s Career] ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; in more than 112 cities worldwide in a project that was planned to end only with his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.speronewestwater.com/exhibitions/sculpting-time/installations Sculpting Time] Sperone Westwater, 25 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Title'' and postcards===
Much like the ''Today'' series, Kawara uses the number of days followed by the date the work was executed as his life-dates. So the piece entitled ''[https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.134202.html Title]'' at the [[National Gallery of Art]] has Kawara's life-dates as 26,697 (January 27, 2006) which, when calculated, place Kawara's birthdate at December 24, 1932. Other series of works include the ''I Went and I Met'' series of [[postcard]]s sent to his friends detailing aspects of his life, and a series of telegrams sent to various people bearing the message "I AM STILL ALIVE". Between 1968 and 1979, On Kawara created his information series, ''I Got Up'', in which he sent two picture postcards from his location on that morning. All of the 1,500&lt;ref name="wsj.com"/&gt; cards list the artist's time of getting up, the date, the place of residence and the name and address of the receiver another series of postcards, ''I Got Up At'', rubber-stamped with the time he got up that morning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=2031746 On Kawara (b. 1932), I Got Up, Sale 8523] Christie's New York, 15 May 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The length of each correspondence ranged from a single card to hundreds sent consecutively over a period of months; the gesture's repetitive nature is counterbalanced by the artist's peripatetic global wanderings and exceedingly irregular hours (in 1973 alone he sent postcards from twenty-eight cities).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/2001.228a-pp ''I GOT UP, 1970'' by On Kawara] [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''One Million Years''===
[[File:One million years.jpg|thumb|right|180px|One million years]]''One Million Years'' is one of the artist’s best-known works about the passage and marking of time. It lists each year for the one million-year period leading up to the artwork's conception and the million years that follow it. It is sometimes performed, during which pairs of performers (typically one male and one female for an each segment) read dates from each list in order, simultaneously performing ''One Million Years [Past]'' and ''One Million Years [Future]''.

The artwork was first made in 1969, the year of the Woodstock music festival, major civil protests against the Vietnam War and man's first landing on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southlondongallery.org/page/144/On+Kawara+Reading+One+Million+Years/132 Reading One Million Years, 29 March - 5 April 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714212719/http://www.southlondongallery.org/page/144/On+Kawara+Reading+One+Million+Years/132 |date=14 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first audio presentation of the reading of ''One Million Years'' occurred in 1993 during Kawara’s yearlong solo exhibition “One Thousand Days One Million Years” at [[Dia Art Foundation|Dia Center for the Arts]] in New York. Visitors could hear ''One Million Years [Future]'' being read, while viewing ''One Million Years [Past]'' and a group of date paintings. The longest public reading from ''One Million Years'' took place at ''[[documenta]]'' 11 in 2002, where male and female participants sat side by side in a glass enclosure taking turns reading dates for the duration of the 100-day exhibition, switching between ''[Past]'' and ''[Future]''. In 2004, the project traveled to [[Trafalgar Square]] in London for a continuous outdoor reading lasting 7 days and 7 nights. Since then, readings and recordings have taken place in cities around the world.

===One-Hundred-Year Calendars===
For his one-hundred-year calendars, Kawara, starting with the date of his birth, systematically marks each day of his life with a yellow dot on the calendars, and registers a completed date painting with a green dot (red dots signify that more than one painting was completed on that given day).&lt;ref name="zwirner"/&gt;

===''Pure Consciousness''===
In ''Pure Consciousness,'' a traveling exhibition initiated in 1998, Kawara lent seven ''Date paintings'' (January 1 to January 7, 1997) to kindergartens and schools in Madagascar, Australia, Bhutan, Côte d'Ivoire, Colombia, Turkey, Japan, Finland, Iceland, Israel, and the United States. At all schools they hang in classrooms, bearing dates that fall within the lifespans of the children.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Searle (3 December 2002), [https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2002/dec/03/art.artsfeatures It's a date!] ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibitions==
Kawara's first exhibitions include the first Nippon Exhibition, at the Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum, in 1953, and at the Takemiya and Hibiya galleries the following year.&lt;ref name="diacenter"/&gt; His work was exhibited at New York's Dwan Gallery in 1967, and his one-person exhibition "One Million Years" was shown in Düsseldorf, Paris, and Milan in 1971. Kawara's work was included in ''[[documenta]]'' 5 (1972), 7 (1982), and 11 (2002), in Kassel, and in the Tokyo Biennale (1970), the Kyoto Biennale (1976), and the [[Venice Biennale]] (1976).

His work has been included in many conceptual art surveys from the seminal ''Information'' show at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York in 1970 to ''Reconsidering the Object of Art: 1965-1975'' at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] in 1995. Solo exhibitions of his work have included the [[Otis Art Institute]], Los Angeles, and the [[Centre Pompidou]], Paris, in 1977; ''Continuity/Discontinuity'' at the [[Moderna Museet]], Stockholm in 1980; [[Museum Boymans-van Beuningen]], Rotterdam in 1991; the Dia Center for the Arts, New York in 1993; and the [[Dallas Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120802115923/http://www.dm-art.org/PressRoom/Archives/dma_205667 Dallas Museum of Art to Present ''On Kawara: 10 Tableaux and 16,952 Pages'', May 18 - August 24, 2008] Dallas Art Museum.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawara's first comprehensive retrospective, [http://exhibitions.guggenheim.org/onkawara/ “On Kawara—Silence”] at the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], was installed in 12 sections according to a plan devised by himself. Two years before his death, the artist offered the exhibit’s curator Jeffrey Weiss a list of oblique titles—including “48 Years,” “Self-Observation” and “Monologue”—for each of the sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On Kawara-Silence|url=http://exhibitions.guggenheim.org/onkawara/|website=guggenheim.org|publisher=© 2015 The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation (SRGF)|accessdate=14 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was held February 6 through May 3, 2015 and also featured a live reading of Kawara’s “One Million Years.”

==Artist books==
Kawara created several [[artist's book]]s:

==Art market==
On Kawara is represented by [[David Zwirner Gallery]], New York and [[Yvon Lambert Gallery]], Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yvon-lambert.com Yvon Lambert]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, one of Kawaras "Date Paintings" was sold for $1.8 million at [[Christie's]] New York.&lt;ref name="On Kawara, May 1, 1987 1987"/&gt; Another date painting, ''May 1, 1987'', set an auction record for Kawara when it sold for almost $4.2 million at Christie's New York in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/on-kawara-may-1-1987-5792580-details.aspx?from=salesummary&amp;intObjectID=5792580&amp;sid=3a727442-f273-4556-96ce-a711099c12dc On Kawara, ''May 1, 1987'' (1987)] [[Christie's]] New York, 12 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

Kawara's ″100 Years Calendar″ indicates that he was born on December 24, 1932, not on the 2nd of January 1933, as was officially recorded.&lt;ref&gt;On Kawara - Silence, by Jeffrey Weiss and Anne Wheeler, 2015, The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York&lt;/ref&gt; This would make the date of his death, June 27, 2014.

{{evolutionary biology}}

'''Punctuated equilibrium''' (also called '''punctuated equilibria''') is a theory in [[evolution|evolutionary biology]] which proposes that once [[species]] appear in the [[fossil record]] the population will become stable, showing little evolutionary change for most of its geological history.&lt;ref name="pe1972"&gt;Eldredge, Niles and S. J. Gould (1972). [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/ridley/classictexts/eldredge.asp "Punctuated equilibria: an alternative to phyletic gradualism"] In T.J.M. Schopf, ed., ''Models in Paleobiology''. San Francisco: Freeman Cooper. pp. 82-115. Reprinted in N. Eldredge ''Time frames''. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press, 1985, pp. 193-223. ([http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/6564 2nd draft], [http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/6567 3rd final draft], [http://www.somosbacteriasyvirus.com/phyletic.pdf Published draft])&lt;/ref&gt; This state of little or no morphological change is called ''stasis''. When significant evolutionary change occurs, the theory proposes that it is generally restricted to rare and [[geologic time scale|geologically rapid]] events of branching speciation called [[cladogenesis]]. Cladogenesis is the process by which a species splits into two distinct species, rather than one species gradually transforming into another.&lt;ref name=Gould&amp;Eldredge1977&gt;Gould, Stephen Jay, &amp; Eldredge, Niles (1977). [http://www.johnboccio.com/courses/SOC26/Bak-Sneppan/07_Gould.pdf "Punctuated equilibria: the tempo and mode of evolution reconsidered."] ''Paleobiology'' '''3''' (2): 115-151. (p.145)&lt;/ref&gt;

Punctuated equilibrium is commonly contrasted against [[phyletic gradualism]], the idea that evolution generally occurs uniformly and by the steady and gradual transformation of whole lineages (called [[anagenesis]]). In this view, evolution is seen as generally smooth and continuous.&lt;ref name="GouldNewScientist"&gt;Gould, S. J.

In 1972, paleontologists [[Niles Eldredge]] and [[Stephen Jay Gould]] published a landmark paper developing their theory and called it ''punctuated equilibria''.&lt;ref name="pe1972"/&gt;  Their paper built upon [[Ernst Mayr]]'s model of [[allopatric speciation|geographic speciation]],&lt;ref name=Mayr1954&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1954).

==History==
Punctuated equilibrium originated as a logical consequence of [[Ernst Mayr]]'s concept of [[Founder effect|genetic revolutions]] by [[allopatric speciation|allopatric]] and especially [[peripatric speciation]] as applied to the fossil record. Although the sudden appearance of species and its relationship to speciation was proposed and identified by Mayr in 1954,&lt;ref name=Mayr1954 /&gt; [[history of science|historians of science]] generally recognize the 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper as the basis of the new [[paleobiology|paleobiological]] research program.&lt;ref name="Mayr1992"&gt;[[Ernst Mayr|Mayr, Ernst]] (1992).

New York: Columbia University Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;78–85.&lt;/ref&gt; Punctuated equilibrium differs from Mayr's ideas mainly in that Eldredge and Gould placed considerably greater emphasis on stasis, whereas Mayr was concerned with explaining the [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] discontinuity (or "sudden jumps")&lt;ref&gt;Schindewolf, Otto (1936). ''Paldontologie, Entwicklungslehre und Genetik''. Berlin: Borntraeger.&lt;/ref&gt; found in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="Mayr1992"/&gt; Mayr later complimented Eldredge and Gould's paper, stating that evolutionary stasis had been "unexpected by most evolutionary biologists" and that punctuated equilibrium "had a major impact on paleontology and evolutionary biology."&lt;ref name=Mayr1992 /&gt;

A year before their 1972 Eldredge and Gould paper, [[Niles Eldredge]] published a paper in the journal ''[[Evolution (journal)|Evolution]]'' which suggested that gradual evolution was seldom seen in the fossil record and argued that Ernst Mayr's standard mechanism of [[allopatric speciation]] might suggest a possible resolution.&lt;ref name=eldredge1971 /&gt;

The Eldredge and Gould paper was presented at the [[Geological Society of America|Annual Meeting of the Geological Society of America]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=pe1972/&gt; The symposium focused its attention on how modern [[microevolution]]ary studies could revitalize various aspects of paleontology and macroevolution. Tom Schopf, who organized that year's meeting, assigned Gould the topic of speciation. Gould recalls that "Eldredge's 1971 publication [on [[Paleozoic]] [[trilobite]]s] had presented the only new and interesting ideas on the paleontological implications of the subject—so I asked Schopf if we could present the paper jointly."&lt;ref name="StructureofEvolutionaryTheory"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gould |first= S. J. |date=2002 |title=The Structure of Evolutionary Theory |publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn =0-674-00613-5 |page=775}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gould "the ideas came mostly from Niles, with yours truly acting as a sounding board and eventual scribe. I coined the term ''punctuated equilibrium'' and wrote most of our 1972 paper, but Niles is the proper first author in our pairing of Eldredge and Gould."&lt;ref name=Opus200&gt;Gould, S. J. (1991). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_opus200.html "Opus 200"] ''Natural History'' 100 (August): 12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Time Frames'' Eldredge recalls that after much discussion the pair "each wrote roughly half. Some of the parts that would seem obviously the work of one of us were actually first penned by the other—I remember for example, writing the section on Gould's snails. Other parts are harder to reconstruct. Gould edited the entire manuscript for better consistency. We sent it in, and Schopf reacted strongly against it—thus signaling the tenor of the reaction it has engendered, though for shifting reasons, down to the present day."&lt;ref&gt;Eldredge, N. 1985. ''Time Frames: The evolution of punctuated equilibria''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, p. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Wilkins and Gareth Nelson have argued that French architect [[Pierre Trémaux]] proposed an "anticipation of the theory of punctuated equilibrium of Gould and Eldredge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkins | first1 = John S. | last2 = Nelson | first2 = G.J. | year = 2008 | title = Trémaux on species: A theory of allopatric speciation (and punctuated equilibrium) before Wagner | url = http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/3881/1/Tremaux-on-species.pdf | format = PDF | journal = History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 179–206 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theoretical mechanisms==
===Punctuational change===
When Eldredge and Gould published their 1972 paper, [[allopatric speciation]] was considered the "standard" model of speciation.&lt;ref name=pe1972 /&gt; This model was popularized by Ernst Mayr in his 1954 paper "Change of genetic environment and evolution,"&lt;ref name=Mayr1954 /&gt; and his classic volume ''Animal Species and Evolution'' (1963).&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1963). ''Animal Species and Evolution''. Cambridge, MA: [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Allopatric speciation suggests that species with large central populations are stabilized by their large volume and the process of [[gene flow]]. New and even [[Mutation#Beneficial mutations|beneficial mutations]] are diluted by the population's large size and are unable to reach fixation, due to such factors as constantly changing environments.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963" /&gt; If this is the case, then the transformation of whole lineages should be rare, as the fossil record indicates. Smaller populations on the other hand, which are isolated from the parental stock, are decoupled from the [[wikt:Homogeneous|homogenizing]] effects of gene flow. In addition, pressure from [[natural selection]] is especially intense, as peripheral isolated populations exist at the outer edges of ecological tolerance. If most evolution happens in these rare instances of allopatric speciation then evidence of gradual evolution in the fossil record should be rare. This [[hypothesis]] was alluded to by Mayr in the closing paragraph of his 1954 paper:

{{quote|Rapidly evolving peripherally isolated populations may be the place of origin of many evolutionary novelties. Their isolation and comparatively small size may explain phenomena of rapid evolution and lack of documentation in the fossil record, hitherto puzzling to the palaeontologist.&lt;ref name=Mayr1954 /&gt;}}

Although punctuated equilibrium generally applies to sexually reproducing organisms,&lt;ref&gt;Eldredge, Niles and S. J. Gould (1997). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/science_on-punctuated-equilibria.html "On punctuated equilibria (letter)."] ''Science'' 276 (5311): 337-341.&lt;/ref&gt; some biologists have applied the model to non-sexual species like [[virus]]es,&lt;ref&gt;Nichol, S.T, Joan Rowe, and Walter M. Fitch (1993). [http://www.pnas.org/content/90/22/10424.full.pdf "Punctuated equilibrium and positive Darwinian evolution in vesicular stomatitis virus."] ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'' 90 (Nov.): 10424-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elena S.F., V.S. Cooper, and R. Lenski (1996). [http://myxo.css.msu.edu/lenski/pdf/1996,%20Science,%20Elena%20et%20al.pdf "Punctuated Evolution Caused by Selection of Rare Beneficial Mutations."] ''Science'' 272 (June 21): 1802-1804.&lt;/ref&gt; which cannot be stabilized by conventional gene flow. As time went on biologists like Gould moved away from wedding punctuated equilibrium to allopatric speciation, particularly as evidence accumulated in support of other modes of speciation.&lt;ref name="GouldNewScientist"/&gt; Gould, for example, was particularly attracted to [[Douglas J. Futuyma|Douglas Futuyma's]] work on the importance of reproductive isolating mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas |date=1987 |title=On the role of species in anagenesis |journal=[[The American Naturalist|American Naturalist]] |doi=10.1086/284724 |volume=130 |issue=3 |pages=465–473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stasis===
Many hypotheses have been proposed to explain the [[wikt:putative|putative]] causes of stasis. Gould was initially attracted to [[I. Michael Lerner]]'s theories of developmental and genetic homeostasis. However this hypothesis was rejected over time,&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. 2002. ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nhIl7e61WOUC&amp;pg=PA39 39].&lt;/ref&gt; as evidence accumulated against it.&lt;ref name=Futuyma86&gt;Futuyma, Douglas (2005). ''Evolution''. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; Other plausible mechanisms which have been suggested include: habitat tracking,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eldredge |first1=N. |last2=Gould |first2=S.

Biol.''  '''177''', 401-409]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for the existence of stasis has also been corroborated from the genetics of [[sibling species]], species which are morphologically indistinguishable, but whose proteins have diverged sufficiently to suggest they have been separated for millions of years.&lt;ref&gt;Maynard Smith, John (1989). ''Did Darwin Get it Right?'' New York: Chapman and Hall, p. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gould, "stasis may emerge as the theory's most important contribution to evolutionary science."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. 2002. ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, p. [https://books.google.com/books?id=nhIl7e61WOUC&amp;pg=PA1155 872.]&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher [[Kim Sterelny]] in clarifying the meaning of stasis adds, "In claiming that species typically undergo no further evolutionary change once speciation is complete, they are not claiming that there is no change at all between one generation and the next. Lineages do change. But the change between generations does not accumulate. Instead, over time, the species wobbles about its [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] mean. [[Jonathan Weiner]]'s ''[[The Beak of the Finch]]'' describes this very process."&lt;ref&gt;Sterelny, Kim (2007). ''[[Dawkins vs. Gould|Dawkins vs. Gould: Survival of the Fittest]]''. Cambridge, U.K.: Icon Books, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hierarchical evolution===
Punctuated equilibrium has also been cited as contributing to the hypothesis that species are [[Unit of selection|Darwinian individuals]], and not just [[class (biology)|classes]], thereby providing a stronger framework for a [[Unit of selection#Species selection and selection at higher taxonomic levels|hierarchical theory]] of evolution.&lt;ref name="CoordinatedStasis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brett |first1=Carlton E. |last2=Ivany |first2=Linda C. |last3=Schopf |first3=Kenneth M. |date=1996 |title=Coordinated stasis: An overview |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |doi=10.1016/S0031-0182(96)00085-5 |volume=127 |issue=1–4 |pages=1–20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common misconceptions==
Much confusion has arisen over what proponents of punctuated equilibrium actually argued, what mechanisms they advocated, how fast the punctuations were, what taxonomic scale their theory applied to, how revolutionary their claims were intended to be, and how punctuated equilibrium related to other ideas like [[Saltation (biology)|saltationism]], [[quantum evolution]], and [[mass extinction]].&lt;ref name="gould_pe-fact-theory"&gt;Gould, S.

New York: Cornell University Press. pp.&amp;nbsp;54–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saltationism===
[[File:Punctuated Equilibrium.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Alternative explanations for the punctuated pattern of evolution observed in the fossil record. Both [[macromutation]] and relatively rapid episodes of gradual evolution could give the appearance of instantaneous change, since 10,000 years seldom registers in the geological record.]]

The punctuational nature of punctuated equilibrium has engendered perhaps the most confusion over Eldredge and Gould's theory. Gould's sympathetic treatment of [[Richard Goldschmidt]],&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1976). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_hopeful-monsters.html "The Return of Hopeful Monsters,"] ''Natural History'' 86 (June/July): 22-30.&lt;/ref&gt; the controversial [[genetics|geneticist]] who advocated the idea of "[[hopeful monster]]s," led some biologists to conclude that Gould's punctuations were occurring in single-generation jumps.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1982).

===Quantum evolution===
[[Quantum evolution]] was a controversial hypothesis advanced by [[Columbia University]] paleontologist [[George Gaylord Simpson]], who was regarded by Gould as "the greatest and most biologically astute paleontologist of the twentieth century."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (2007) ''Punctuated equilibrium''. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson's conjecture was that according to the geological record, on very rare occasions evolution would proceed very rapidly to form entirely new [[Family (biology)|families]], [[Order (biology)|orders]], and [[Class (biology)|classes]] of organisms.&lt;ref name=Simpson1944&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1944). ''[[Tempo and Mode in Evolution]]''. New York: Columbia Univ. Press, p. 206&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fitch, W. J. and F. J. Ayala (1995) [https://download.nap.edu/cart/download.cgi?record_id=4910 ''Tempo and mode in evolution: genetics and paleontology 50 years after Simpson''.] Washington, D.C.: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis differs from punctuated equilibrium in several respects. First, punctuated equilibrium was more modest in scope, in that it was addressing evolution specifically at the [[species]] level.&lt;ref name=Gould&amp;Eldredge1977 /&gt; Simpson's idea was principally concerned with evolution at higher taxonomic groups.&lt;ref name=Simpson1944 /&gt; Second, Eldredge and Gould relied upon a different mechanism. Where Simpson relied upon a [[Synergy|synergistic]] interaction between [[genetic drift]] and a shift in the [[fitness landscape|adaptive fitness landscape]],&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1953). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/simpson_evolutionary-rates.html ''The Major Features of Evolution'']. New York: Columbia Univ. Press, p. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Eldredge and Gould relied upon ordinary speciation, particularly Ernst Mayr's concept of allopatric speciation. Lastly, and perhaps most significantly, quantum evolution took no position on the issue of stasis. Although Simpson acknowledged the existence of stasis in what he called the bradytelic mode, he considered it (along with rapid evolution) to be unimportant in the larger scope of evolution.&lt;ref name="Simpson1944p206"&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1944). ''[[Tempo and Mode in Evolution]]''. New York: Columbia Univ. Press, [https://books.google.com/books?id=f5qucNebo-kC&amp;pg=PA205 pp. 205-206.]&lt;/ref&gt; In his ''Major Features of Evolution'' Simpson stated, "Evolutionary change is so nearly the universal rule that a state of motion is, figuratively, normal in evolving populations. The state of rest, as in bradytely, is the exception and it seems that some restraint or force must be required to maintain it." Despite such differences between the two models, earlier critiques—from such eminent commentators as [[Sewall Wright]] as well as Simpson himself—have argued that punctuated equilibrium is little more than quantum evolution relabeled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wright |first=Sewall |date=1982 |title=Character change, speciation, and the higher taxa |journal=Evolution |doi=10.2307/2408092 |volume=56 |issue=3 |page=427 |url=http://stewardshipofcreationenabler.giving.officelive.com/Documents/21_Wright1982.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828022050/http://stewardshipofcreationenabler.giving.officelive.com/Documents/21_Wright1982.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, G. G. (1984) ''Tempo and Mode in Evolution''. Reprint. Columbia University Press, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple meanings of gradualism===
Punctuated equilibrium is often portrayed to oppose the concept of [[Gradualism#Geology and biology|gradualism]], when it is actually a form of gradualism.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, Richard 1996 p. 224-252"&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., Chapter 9. (p. 224-252)&lt;/ref&gt; This is because even though evolutionary change appears instantaneous between geological sedimentary layers, change is still occurring incrementally, with no great change from one generation to the next. To this end, Gould later commented that "Most of our [[paleontology|paleontological colleagues]] missed this insight because they had not studied evolutionary theory and either did not know about [[allopatric speciation]] or had not considered its translation to geological time. Our [[Population genetics|evolutionary colleagues]] also failed to grasp the implication(s), primarily because they did not think at geological scales".&lt;ref name=Opus200/&gt;

[[Richard Dawkins]] dedicated a chapter in ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' to correcting, in his view, the wide confusion regarding ''rates of change''. His first point is to argue that [[phyletic gradualism]] — understood in the sense that evolution proceeds at a single uniform rate of speed, called "constant speedism" by Dawkins — is a "caricature of Darwinism"&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and "does not really exist".&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 228. Dawkins' exception to this rule is the non-adaptive evolution observed in molecular evolution.&lt;/ref&gt; His second argument, which follows from the first, is that once the caricature of "constant speedism" is dismissed, we are left with one logical alternative, which Dawkins terms "variable speedism". Variable speedism may also be distinguished one of two ways: "''discrete variable'' speedism" and "''continuously variable'' speedism". Eldredge and Gould, proposing that evolution jumps between stability and relative rapidity, are described as "discrete variable speedists", and "in this respect they are genuinely radical."&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; They assert that evolution generally proceeds in bursts, or not at all. "Continuously variable speedists", on the other hand, advance that "evolutionary rates fluctuate continuously from very fast to very slow and stop, with all intermediates. They see no particular reason to emphasize certain speeds more than others. In particular, stasis, to them, is just an extreme case of ultra-slow evolution. To a punctuationist, there is something very special about stasis."&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). The Blind Watchmaker, p. 245-246.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins therefore commits himself here to an empirical claim about the geological record,{{original research inline|date=May 2016}} in contrast to his earlier claim that "The paleontological evidence can be argued about, and I am not qualified to judge it."&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, R (1982) ''[[The Extended Phenotype]]''. London: Oxford University Press, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; It is this particular commitment that Eldredge and Gould have aimed to overturn.

==Criticism==
[[Richard Dawkins]] regards the apparent gaps represented in the fossil record to document migratory events rather than evolutionary events. According to Dawkins, evolution certainly occurred but  "probably gradually" elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 240.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the punctuational equilibrium model may still be inferred from both the observation of stasis and examples of rapid and episodic speciation events documented in the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cheetham |first1=Alan |authorlink1=Alan Cheetham |last2=Jackson |first2=Jeremy |last3=Hayek |first3=Lee-Ann |author3-link= Lee-Ann C. Hayek |date=1994 |title=Quantitative genetics of bryozoan phenotypic evolution |journal=Evolution |doi=10.2307/2410098 |volume=48 |pages=360–375}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawkins also emphasizes that punctuated equilibrium has been "oversold by some journalists",&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 250-251.&lt;/ref&gt; but partly due to Eldredge and Gould's "later writings".&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins contends that the hypothesis "does not deserve a particularly large measure of publicity".&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 250.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a "minor gloss," an "interesting but minor wrinkle on the surface of neo-Darwinian theory," and "lies firmly within the neo-Darwinian synthesis".&lt;ref&gt;Dawkins, Richard (1996). ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'', p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]'', philosopher [[Daniel Dennett]] is especially critical of Gould's presentation of punctuated equilibrium. Dennett argues that Gould alternated between revolutionary and conservative claims, and that each time Gould made a revolutionary statement—or appeared to do so—he was criticized, and thus retreated to a traditional neo-Darwinian position.&lt;ref&gt;Dennett, Daniel (1995). ''[[Darwin's Dangerous Idea]]''. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, pp. 282-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Gould responded to Dennett's claims in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (1997). [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1151 "Darwinian Fundamentalism"] ''The New York Review of Books'', June 12, pp. 34-37; and [https://web.archive.org/web/20161110121332/http://www.stephenjaygould.org/reviews/gould_pluralism.html "Evolution: The Pleasures of Pluralism"] ''The New York Review of Books'', June 26, pp. 47-52.&lt;/ref&gt; and in his technical volume ''[[The Structure of Evolutionary Theory]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. (2002). [http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_structure.html "Punctuated Equilibrium's Threefold History."] ''The Structure of Evolutionary Theory'', pp. 1006-1021.&lt;/ref&gt;

English professor Heidi Scott argues that Gould's talent for writing vivid prose, his use of metaphor, and his success in building a popular audience of nonspecialist readers altered the "climate of specialized scientific discourse" favorably in his promotion of punctuated equilibrium.&lt;ref name=scott&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scott |first=Heidi |date=2007 |title=Stephen Jay Gould and the Rhetoric of Evolutionary Theory |journal=Rhetoric Review |doi=10.1080/07350190709336705 |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=120–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Gould is celebrated for the color and energy of his prose, as well as his interdisciplinary knowledge, critics such as Scott, Richard Dawkins, and Daniel Dennett have concerns that the theory has gained undeserved credence among non-scientists because of Gould's rhetorical skills.&lt;ref name=scott /&gt; Philosopher John Lyne and biologist Henry Howe believed punctuated equilibrium's success has much more to do with the nature of the geological record than the nature of Gould's rhetoric. They state, a "re-analysis of existing fossil data has shown, to the increasing satisfaction of the paleontological community, that Eldredge and Gould were correct in identifying periods of evolutionary stasis which are interrupted by much shorter periods of evolutionary change."&lt;ref&gt;Lyne, John and Henry Howe "'Punctuated Equilibria': Rhetorical Dynamics of a Scientific Controversy". in Harris, R. A. ed. (2007). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CGvK8pBsiSAC&amp;pg=PA69 ''Landmark Essays on Rhetoric of Science''.] Mahwah NJ: Hermagoras Press, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics jokingly referred to the theory of punctuated equilibrium as "evolution by jerks",&lt;ref&gt;Turner, John (1984). [https://books.google.com/books?id=6idhDboGmZoC&amp;pg=PA34 "Why we need evolution by jerks."] ''New Scientist'' 101 (Feb. 9): 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;
which reportedly prompted punctuationists to describe [[phyletic gradualism]] as "evolution by creeps."&lt;ref&gt;Gould, S. J. and Steven Rose, ed. (2007). ''The Richness of Life: The Essential Stephen Jay Gould''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., [https://books.google.com/books?id=yfXJhKmp1wUC&amp;pg=PA6 p. 6.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Darwin's theory==
The sudden appearance of most species in the geologic record and the lack of evidence of substantial gradual change in most [[species]]—from their initial appearance until their extinction—has [[Speciation#Darwin's dilemma: Why do species exist?|long been noted]], including by [[Charles Darwin]] who appealed to the imperfection of the record as the favored explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. London: John Murray, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1871). ''[[The Origin of Species]]''. London: John Murray, p. 119-120.&lt;/ref&gt; When presenting his ideas against the prevailing influences of [[catastrophism]] and [[progressive creationism]], which envisaged species being supernaturally created at intervals, Darwin needed to forcefully stress the gradual nature of [[evolution]] in accordance with the [[gradualism]] promoted by his friend [[Charles Lyell]]. He privately expressed concern, noting in the margin of his 1844 ''Essay'', "Better begin with this: If species really, after catastrophes, created in showers world over, my theory false."&lt;ref name=VQR&gt;Eldredge, Niles (2006) [http://www.vqronline.org/articles/2006/spring/eldredge-confessions-darwinist/ "Confessions of a Darwinist."] ''[[The Virginia Quarterly Review]]'' 82 (Spring): 32-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often incorrectly assumed that he insisted that the rate of change must be constant, or nearly so, but even the first edition of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' states that "Species of different genera and classes have not changed at the same rate, or in the same degree. In the oldest tertiary beds a few living shells may still be found in the midst of a multitude of extinct forms... The Silurian ''Lingula'' differs but little from the living species of this genus". ''[[Lingula (genus)|Lingula]]'' is among the few brachiopods surviving today but also known from fossils over 500 million years old.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1859). ''On the Origin of Species''. London: John Murray. [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F373&amp;pageseq=331 p. 313].&lt;/ref&gt; In the fourth edition (1866) of ''On the Origin of Species'' Darwin wrote that "the periods during which species have undergone modification, though long as measured in years, have probably been short in comparison with the periods during which they retain the same form."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1869). ''The Origin of Species''. London: John Murray. 5th edition, [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=text&amp;itemID=F387&amp;pageseq=583 p. 551].&lt;/ref&gt; Thus punctuationism in general is consistent with Darwin's conception of evolution.&lt;ref name=VQR/&gt;

According to early versions of punctuated equilibrium, "peripheral isolates" are considered to be of critical importance for speciation. However, Darwin wrote, "''I can by no means agree'' ... that immigration and isolation are necessary elements....  Although isolation is of great importance in the production of new species, on the whole I am inclined to believe that largeness of area is still more important, especially for the production of species which shall prove capable of enduring for a long period, and of spreading widely."&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1869). ''The Origin of Species''. London: John Murray. 5th edition, [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F387&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 pp. 120-121.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of isolation in forming species had played a significant part in Darwin's early thinking, as shown in his ''Essay'' of 1844. But by the time he wrote the ''Origin'' he had downplayed its importance.&lt;ref name=VQR/&gt; He explained the reasons for his revised view as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Throughout a great and open area, not only will there be a greater chance of favourable variations, arising from the large number of individuals of the same species there supported, but the conditions of life are much more complex from the large number of already existing species; and if some of these species become modified and improved, others will have to be improved in a corresponding degree, or they will be exterminated. Each new form, also, as soon as it has been improved, will be able to spread over the open and continuous area, and will thus come into competition with many other forms&amp;nbsp;... the new forms produced on large areas, which have already been victorious over many competitors, will be those that will spread most widely, and will give rise to the greatest number of new varieties and species. They will thus play a more important role in the changing history of the organic world.&lt;ref&gt;Darwin, Charles (1869). ''The Origin of Species''. London: John Murray. 5th edition, [http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F387&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 pp. 121-122.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Thus punctuated equilibrium is incongruous with some of Darwin's ideas regarding the specific mechanisms of evolution, but generally accords with Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.&lt;ref name=VQR/&gt;&lt;ref name="ComesOfAge"&gt;{{Citation |last1=Gould |first1=Stephen Jay |authorlink1=Stephen Jay Gould |last2=Eldredge |first2=Niles |authorlink2=Niles Eldredge |date=1993 |title=Punctuated equilibrium comes of age |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/366223a0 |pmid=8232582|volume=366 |issue=6452 |pages=223–227 |url=http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_comes-of-age.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supplemental modes of rapid evolution==
{{See also|Rapid modes of evolution}}
Recent work in [[developmental biology]] has identified dynamical and physical mechanisms of [[morphogenesis|tissue morphogenesis]] that may underlie abrupt morphological transitions during evolution. Consequently, consideration of mechanisms of phylogenetic change that have been found in reality to be non-gradual is increasingly common in the field of [[evolutionary developmental biology]], particularly in studies of the origin of morphological novelty. A description of such mechanisms can be found in the multi-authored volume ''[[Origination of Organismal Form]]'' (MIT Press; 2003).

==Language change==
{{See also|Language change}}
In linguistics, [[R. M. W. Dixon]] has proposed a punctuated equilibrium model for language histories,&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, R.M.W. (1997). ''The rise and fall of languages'' Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; with reference particularly to the prehistory of the [[indigenous languages of Australia]] and his objections to the proposed [[Pama–Nyungan languages|Pama–Nyungan]] language family there. Although his model has raised considerable interest, it does not command majority support within linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.jbe-platform.com/content/books/9789027295118|title=Australian Languages|last=|first=|date=2004-03-18|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|isbn=9789027295118|editor-last=Bowern|editor-first=Claire|location=|pages=|language=en|doi=10.1075/cilt.249|editor-last2=Koch|editor-first2=Harold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separately, recent work using [[computational phylogenetics|computational phylogenetic]] methods claims to show that punctuational bursts play an important factor when [[language change|languages split from one another]], accounting for anywhere from 10 to 33% of the total divergence in vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Atkinson |first1=Quentin D. |last2=Meade |first2=Andrew |last3=Venditti |first3=Chris |last4=Greenhill |first4=Simon J. |last5=Pagel |first5=Mark |date=2008 |title=Languages Evolve in Punctuational Bursts |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |doi=10.1126/science.1149683 |pmid=18239118 |volume=319 |issue=5863 |page=588}}; Dan Dediu mail, Stephen C.

A '''push present''' is a [[gift|present]] a partner gives to the birthing mother to mark the occasion of her giving birth to their child. In practice the present may be given before or after the birth, or even in the delivery room. The giving of push presents has supposedly grown in the United States in recent years.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/fashion/06push.html?ex=1354683600&amp;en=5f57797f8bd491d0&amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink|title=A Bundle of Joy Isn't Enough?|work=[[New York Times]]|date=December 6, 2007|author=[[Thomas Vinciguerra]]|accessdate=2004-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A ''push gift'' is any type of present loved ones give to a woman who has recently given birth to a child. There is no conclusive evidence that the present was invented by the jewelry industry to sell more goods,&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt; and until recently it was passed on largely by word of mouth or peer pressure among both mothers and fathers.&lt;ref name=fox&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,99962,00.html|date=October 14, 2003|title='Push Presents' Expected from Expectant Fathers|author= Catherine Donaldson-Evans|work=[[Fox News]].com|accessdate=2007-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Linda Murray, the executive editor of [[BabyCenter]], "It's an expectation of moms these days that they deserve something for bearing the burden for nine months, getting sick, ruining their body. The guilt really gets piled on."&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; Other sources trace the development of the present to the increased assertiveness of women, allowing them to ask for a present more directly, or the increased involvement of the men in pregnancy, making them more informed of the pain and difficulty of pregnancy and labor.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==Frequency==
A 2004 survey of over 30,000 respondents by BabyCenter found that 38% of new mothers received a push present, and 55% of pregnant mothers wanted one, though fewer thought it was actually expected. About 40% of both groups said the baby itself was already a present and did not wish an additional reward.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; 

The popularity of push presents has been attributed in part to media coverage of celebrities receiving them. Examples include a 10 carat diamond ring given to celebrity stylist [[Rachel Zoe]] by her husband Rodger after the 2011 birth of their son, a [[Bentley]] given to [[reality TV]] star [[The Real Housewives of Orange County#Peggy Tanous|Peggy Tanous]] of ''[[The Real Housewives of Orange County]]'' by her husband Micah after the 2007 birth of their daughter, and a diamond and sapphire necklace given to singer [[Mariah Carey]] by her husband [[Nick Cannon]] after the 2011 birth of their twins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Metz|first=Lauren|title=Rachel Zoe Sparkles with 10 Carat Push Present|url=http://origin.www.bravotv.com/blogs/the-dish/rachel-zoe-sparkles-with-10-carat-push-present|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Bravo TV|date=17 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rachel Zoe: I’m Happier Than I’ve Ever Been|url=http://celebritybabies.people.com/2011/05/05/rachel-zoe-im-happier-than-ive-ever-been/?xid=rss-topheadlines|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=People magazine Celebrity Babies|date=5 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Celebrity Moms &amp; The Push Presents That Made Labor Bearable|url=http://uptownmagazine.com/2012/05/celebrity-moms-the-push-presents-that-made-labor-bearable-photos/2/|accessdate=1 August 2012|newspaper=Uptown|date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trend has generated a backlash, as some couples dislike the implicit materialism of push presents, and would prefer increased help in chores or baby care, or save the money for the child's education.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

According to [[etiquette]] expert Pamela Holland, there are no set guidelines for push presents. "The standard is that there is no standard," she said. "It does make sense to have etiquette around wedding or baby shower gifts because you're inviting other people into it. But this is far too intimate to have a rule."&lt;ref name=fox/&gt; In general it is the woman who lets her man know about push presents, not the other way around,&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; although there can be peer pressure from friends to buy one on either the man or the woman.&lt;ref name=fox/&gt;

Analysis of conversations on parenting website the BabyCentre's online community over the last three years found that mentions of push presents had increased by 41 per cent in the past 18 months, compared to only a two per cent increase between 2011 and 2012. A poll of 1,200 BabyCentre mothers also revealed that more than a quarter (27 per cent) were expecting, or had already received, a 'push present' this year. Diamonds were the most popular gift in the form of an [[eternity ring]] with the prices spent ranging from £500 to £1475. Tablet computers, charm bracelets and designer watches and handbags were also popular gifts to celebrate a new arrival.

'''Reform''' ({{lang-lat|reformo}}) means the improvement or amendment of what is wrong, corrupt, unsatisfactory, etc.&lt;ref&gt;dictionary definition http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/reform?s=t&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the word in this way emerges in the late 18th century and is believed to originate from [[Christopher Wyvill#The Yorkshire Association|Christopher Wyvill’s Association movement]] which identified “Parliamentary Reform” as its primary aim.&lt;ref&gt;Reform in English Public Life: the fortunes of a word. Joanna Innes 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Reform is generally distinguished from [[revolution]]. The latter means basic or radical change; whereas reform may be no more than fine tuning, or at most redressing serious wrongs without altering the fundamentals of the system.  Reform seeks to improve the system as it stands, never to overthrow it wholesale. Radicals on the other hand, seek to improve the system, but try to overthrow whether it be the government or a group of people themselves.

[[Rotation in office]] or [[term limits]] would, by contrast, be more revolutionary, in altering basic political connections between incumbents and constituents.&lt;ref&gt;On term limits reform see, [http://www.ustl.org/index.html U.S. Term Limits].  On more radical/revolutionary changes, including term limits, see, for example, Robert Struble, Jr., [http://www.tell-usa.org  ''Treatise on Twelve Lights: To Restore America the Beautiful under God and the Written Constitution''], 2007-08 edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Developing countries]] may carry out a wide range of reforms to improve their living standards, often with support from [[international financial institutions]] and [[aid agencies]]. This can include reforms to [[macroeconomic policy]], the [[civil service reform in developing countries|civil service]], and [[Public finance|public financial management]].

[[Reform (Religion)|Religious Reforms]] are performed in religions and churches.

==Re-form==
A note about [[spelling]]: when used to describe something which is ''physically'' formed again, such as re-[[casting]] it in a [[molding (process)|mold/mould]], or a [[band (music)|band]] that gets back together, the proper term is ''re-form'' (with a [[hyphen]]), not "reform".

Buddhists take '''refuge''' in the Three Jewels or Triple Gem (also known as the "Three Refuges").

The Three Jewels are:
* [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]], the fully enlightened one
* the [[Dharma]], the teachings expounded by the Buddha
* the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]], the monastic order of Buddhism that practice the Dharma

Refuge is common to all major schools of Buddhism.  Pali texts employ the [[Hinduism|Brahmanical]] motif of a group of three refuges, as found in [[Rig Veda]] 9.97.47, Rig Veda 6.46.9 and [[Chandogya Upanishad]] 2.22.3-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shults|first1=Brett|title=On the Buddha’s Use of Some Brahmanical Motifs in Pali Texts|journal=Journal of the Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies|date=May 2014|volume=6|page=119|url=http://jocbs.org/index.php/jocbs/article/view/76/96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Faith (saddha) ==
[[File:Veneration of the Three Jewels, Chorasan, Gandhara, 2nd century AD, schist - Ethnological Museum, Berlin - DSC01642.JPG|thumb|Veneration of the Three Jewels, Chorasan, Gandhara, 2nd century AD, schist – [[Ethnological Museum of Berlin]].|333x333px]]

{{Main|Faith in Buddhism}}
Faith is an important teaching element in both [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] traditions. In contrast to perceived Western notions of faith, faith in Buddhism arises from accumulated experience and [[reason]]ing.

In the ''[[Kalama Sutra]]'', the Buddha explicitly argues against simply following [[authority]] or [[tradition]], particularly those of religions contemporary to the Buddha's time.&lt;ref name="Soma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wheel008.html|title=Kalama Sutta: The Buddha's Charter of Free Inquiry|date=4 February 2013|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204141603/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/soma/wheel008.html|archivedate=4 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There remains value for a degree of trusting confidence and belief in Buddhism, primarily in the spiritual attainment and salvation or [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]]. Faith in Buddhism centres on belief in the Three Jewels.

== Precepts ==
{{Main |Five precepts}}

Lay followers often undertake five precepts in the same ceremony as they [[taking refuge|take the refuges]].{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Festivals and Calendrical Rituals |date=2004 |publisher=[[The Gale Group]] |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/festivals-and-calendrical-rituals |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/71uE0BBbB |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no |via=Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monks administer the precepts to the laypeople, which creates an additional psychological effect.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}} The five precepts are:

# to refrain from killing;&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/ptf/dhamma/sila/atthasila.html|title=The Eight Precepts: attha-sila|website=www.accesstoinsight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/nanavara/uposatha.html|title=Uposatha Sila: The Eight-Precept Observance|website=www.accesstoinsight.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.dhammadana.org/dhamma/practice/8_precepts.htm|title=The 8 precepts|first=Dhamma|last=Sāmi|website=en.dhammadana.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# to refrain from stealing;&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
# to refrain from lying;&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
# to refrain from improper sexual conduct;&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;
# to refrain from consuming intoxicants.&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="accesstoinsight.org1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In [[Early Buddhist Texts]], the role of the five precepts gradually developed. First of all, the precepts were combined with a declaration of faith in the triple gem (the Buddha, [[dhamma|his teaching]] and [[sangha|the monastic community]]).&lt;!--173--&gt; Next, the precepts developed to become the foundation of lay practice.&lt;!--173-4--&gt;{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pp=173{{en dash}}4}} The precepts were seen a preliminary condition for the higher development of the mind.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=178}} At a third stage in the texts, the precepts were actually mentioned together with the triple gem, as though they were part of it. Lastly, the precepts, together with the triple gem, became a required condition for the practice of Buddhism, as lay people had to undergo a formal initiation to become a member of the Buddhist religion.{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |p=173}} When Buddhism spread to different places and people, the role of the precepts began to vary. In countries in which Buddhism was adopted as the main religion without much competition from other religious disciplines, such as Thailand, the relation between the initiation of a lay person and the five precepts has been virtually non-existent, and the taking of the precepts has become a sort of ritual cleansing ceremony. In such countries, people are presumed Buddhist from birth without much of an initiation. The precepts are often committed to by new followers as part of their installment, yet this is not very pronounced. However, in some countries like China, where Buddhism was not the only religion, the precepts became an ordination ceremony to initiate lay people into the Buddhist religion.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=178{{en dash}}9, 205}}

A layperson who upholds the precepts is described in the texts as a "jewel among laymen".{{sfn |De Silva |2016 |page=63 }}

== Three Roots ==
{{Main|Three Roots}}
[[File:Three Jewels symbol colour.svg|thumb|Symbol of the Three Jewels|274x274px]]
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]] there are three refuge formulations, the ''Outer'', ''Inner'', and ''Secret'' forms of the Three Jewels. The 'Outer' form is the 'Triple Gem', (Sanskrit:''triratna''), the 'Inner' is the Three Roots and the 'Secret' form is the 'Three Bodies' or [[trikaya]] of a [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]. These alternative refuge formulations are employed by those undertaking [[Deity Yoga]] and other [[Vajrayana|tantric]] practices within the [[Tibetan Buddhist]] [[Vajrayana]] tradition as a means of recognizing [[Buddha Nature]].
{{Tibetan Buddhist Refuge Formulations}}

Three refuge motivation levels are: 1) suffering rebirth's fear motivates with the idea of happiness, 2) knowing rebirth won’t bring freedoms motivated by attaining nirvana, while 3) seeing other’s suffering motivates establishing them all in Buddhahood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rinpoche|first1=Patrul|title=Words of My Perfect Teacher: A Complete Translation of a Classic Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism (Sacred Literature)|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-16532-3|pages=176–177|edition=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Happiness is temporary, lifetimes are impermanent and ultimately refuge is taken until reaching unsurpassed awakening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dorje|first1=Choying Tobden|last2=Zangpo|first2=Ngawang|title=The Complete Nyingma Tradition from Sutra to Tantra, Books 1 to 10: Foundations of the Buddhist Path|date=June 2, 2015|publisher=Snow Lion|isbn=1-55939-435-8|pages=224–227|edition=First}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=March 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12070">'''Shadow banning''' (also called '''stealth banning''', '''ghost banning''' or '''comment ghosting'''&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;) is the act of [[Block (Internet)|blocking]] or partially blocking  a user or their content from an [[online community]] such that it will not be readily apparent to the user that they have been banned.

By making a user's contributions invisible or less prominent to other members of the service, the hope may be that in the absence of reactions to their comments, the problematic or otherwise out-of-favour user will become bored or frustrated and leave the site.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archive.wired.com/techbiz/people/magazine/17-04/st_thompson|title=Clive Thompson on the Taming of Comment Trolls|last=Thompson|first=Clive|date=29 March 2009|accessdate=6 July 2014|newspaper=Wired magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walsh2006" /&gt;

== Notable examples ==
In the mid-1980s, BBS forums including [[Citadel (software)|''Citadel'' BBS software]] had a "twit bit" for problematic users.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/a3q744/where-did-shadow-banning-come-from-trump-republicans-shadowbanned |title=Where Did the Concept of 'Shadow Banning' Come From? |date=2018-07-31 |work=Motherboard |access-date=2018-08-01 |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2011/06/suspension-ban-or-hellban.html |title=Suspension, Ban or Hellban? |last=Atwood |first=Jeff |publisher=Coding Horror blog |accessdate=17 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When enabled, the user would have limited access, and commonly still be able to read public discussions; however, any messages posted by that "twit" would not be shown to the other users of that group.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.citadel.org/doku.php/documentation:system_administration_manual |title=Manual installation of Citadel using source code and the command line client - Citadel.org |website=www.citadel.org |language=en |accessdate=10 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Pryor of [[Fog Creek Software]] described stealth banning for online forums in 2006, saying how such a system was in place in the project management system [[FogBugz]], "to solve the problem of how do you get the person to go away and leave you alone". As well as preventing problem users from engaging in [[flame war]]s, the system also discouraged [[spammer]]s, who if they returned to the site would be under the false impression that their spam was still in place.&lt;ref name="Walsh2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Robert Walsh|title=Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YKuYXO-LKrcC|date=12 January 2006 |publisher=Apress |isbn=978-1-4302-0114-4 |page=183 |quote=So one of the things we did in FogBugz to solve the problem of how do you get the person to go away and leave you alone is, well, you take their post and make it invisible to everyone else, but they still see it. They won’t know they’ve been deleted. There’s no one fanning their flame. You can’t get into a flame war if no one responds to your criticism. So they get silenced and eventually just go away. We have several ways of telling if they come back, and it’s been proven to be extremely, extremely effective. Say a spammer posts to your board and then they come back to check if it’s still there, and they see it—to them it’s still there—but no one else sees it, so they’re not bothered by it.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Verge]]'' describes it as "one of the oldest moderation tricks in the book", noting that early versions of [[vBulletin]] had a global ignore list known as "Tachy goes to Coventry",&lt;ref name="verge"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/16/14635030/twitter-shadow-ban-moderation |title=One of Twitter’s new anti-abuse measures is the oldest trick in the forum moderation book |last=Bohn |first=Dieter |date=2017-02-16 |website=The Verge |access-date=2017-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in the British expression "[[Send to Coventry|to send someone to Coventry]]", meaning to ignore them and pretend they don't exist.

"Shadow banning" became popularized in 2018 as a conspiracy theory that Twitter had shadow-banned Republicans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Romano|first=Aja|url=https://www.vox.com/2018/9/6/17824652/twitter-dorsey-energy-and-commerce-hearing-shadow-banning|title=How hysteria over Twitter shadow-banning led to a bizarre congressional hearing|publisher=Vox.com|date=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late July 2018, ''[[Vice News]]'' found that several supporters of the [[US Republican Party]] no longer appeared in the auto-populated drop-down search menu on Twitter, thus limiting their visibility when being searched for - allegedly due to the same algorithm that was being used to do the same to the accounts of prominent racists. &lt;ref name=Vice2018&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Alex |date=26 July 2018 |title=Twitter appears to have fixed “shadow ban” of prominent Republicans like the RNC chair and Trump Jr.’s spokesman |url=https://news.vice.com/en_us/article/43paqq/twitter-is-shadow-banning-prominent-republicans-like-the-rnc-chair-and-trump-jrs-spokesman |work=Vice News |location= |access-date=15 August 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After that finding, some conservatives accused Twitter of enacting a shadowban on Republican accounts, which Twitter flatly denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/us/politics/twitter-shadowbanning.html |title=What Is a ‘Shadow Ban,’ and Is Twitter Doing It to Republican Accounts? |date=July 26, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/fruzsinaeordogh/2018/07/31/why-republicans-werent-the-only-ones-shadow-banned-on-twitter/#4b19426e434b |title=Why Republicans Weren't The Only Ones Shadow Banned On Twitter |date=July 31, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some accounts that were not overtly political or conservative apparently had the same algorithm applied to them. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a blog post, Twitter said that the use of the phrase "shadow banning" was inaccurate, as the tweets were still visible by navigating to the home page of the relevant account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Setting the record straight on shadow banning |url=https://blog.twitter.com/official/en_us/topics/company/2018/Setting-the-record-straight-on-shadow-banning.html |website=Twitter |accessdate=8 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Twitter restored the affected accounts.&lt;ref name=Vice2018 /&gt;

'''Speech repetition''' is the [[speech|saying]] by one individual of the spoken [[Speech production|vocalizations]] made by another individual. This requires the ability in the person making the copy to map the sensory input they [[Hearing (sense)|hear]] from the other person's vocal [[pronunciation]] into a similar motor output with their own [[vocal tract]].

Such speech input output imitation often occurs independently of speech comprehension such as in [[speech shadowing]] when a person automatically says words heard in [[earphone]]s, and the pathological condition of [[echolalia]] in which people [[reflex]]ively repeat overheard words. This links to speech repetition of words being separate in the [[human brain|brain]] to [[speech perception]]. Speech repetition occurs in the  dorsal speech processing stream while speech perception occurs in the ventral speech processing stream. Repetitions are often incorporated unawares by this route into spontaneous novel sentences immediately or after delay following  storage in [[Baddeley's model of working memory#Phonological loop|phonological memory]].

In humans, the ability to map heard input vocalizations into motor output is highly developed due to this copying ability playing a critical role in a child's rapid expansion of their  [[Vocabulary#Vocabulary growth|spoken vocabulary]]. In older children and adults it still remains important as it enables the continued learning of novel words and names and [[Second language acquisition|additional languages]]. Such repetition is also necessary for the propagation of language from generation to generation. It has also been suggested that the phonetic units out of which speech is made have been selected upon by the process of vocabulary expansion and vocabulary [[cultural evolution|transmission]]s  due to  children preferentially copying words in terms of more easily imitated elementary units.

===Automatic===

The imitation of [[syllables|speech syllables]] possibly happens even quicker: people begin imitating the second phone in the syllable [ao] earlier than they can identify it (out of the set [ao], [aæ] and [ai]).&lt;ref name="Porter"&gt;{{Cite journal

The ability to repeat and imitate speech sounds occurs separately to that of normal speech. Speech shadowing provides evidence of a 'privileged' input/output speech loop that is distinct to the other components of the speech system.&lt;ref name="McLeod"&gt;McLeod P. Posner MI. (1984).

===Effector independent===
Speech sounds can be imitatively mapped into vocal articulations in spite of vocal tract anatomy differences in size and shape due to [[gender]], [[Human development (biology)|age]] and individual [[anatomical]] variability. Such variability is extensive making input output mapping of speech more complex than a simple mapping of vocal track movements. The shape of the mouth varies widely: [[dentist]]s recognize three basic shapes of [[palate]]: trapezoid, ovoid, and triagonal; six types of [[malocclusion]] between the two [[jaw]]s; nine ways teeth relate to the [[dental arch]] and a wide range of [[maxilla]]ry and [[human mandible|mandible]] deformities.&lt;ref&gt;Bloomer HH. (1971). Speech defects associated with dental malocclusions and related abnormalities. In L. E. (Eds), Handbook of speech pathology and audiology (pp. 715-766), New York, Appleton Century. {{ISBN|978-0-13-381764-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vocal sound can also vary due to dental injury and [[dental caries]]. Other factors that do not impede  the sensory motor mapping needed for vocal imitation  are gross oral deformations such as [[hare-lip]]s, [[cleft palate]]s or amputations of the tongue tip, pipe smoking, pencil biting and teeth clinching (such as in [[ventriloquism]]). [[Paranasal sinuses]]  vary between individuals 20-fold in volume, and differ in the presence and the degree of their  asymmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Williams RJ. (1967). You are extra-ordinary. New York, Random House.  pp. 26-27. {{OCLC|156187572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vocal traits also vary moreover when people get upper respiratory tract infections  as the shape and size of sinus cavities is further changed with the swelling of mucous membranes.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diverse linguistic vocalizations===
Vocal imitation occurs potentially in regard to a diverse range of phonetic units and types of vocalization. The world's languages use [[consonant|consonantal phone]]s that differ in thirteen imitable vocal tract [[place of articulation]]s (from the [[lip]]s to the [[glottis]]). These phones can potentially be pronounced with eleven types of imitable [[manner of articulation]]s ([[nasal stop]]s to [[lateral click]]s). Speech can be copied in regard to its [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|social accent]], [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]], [[Pitch accent|pitch]] and individuality (as with entertainment [[impersonator]]s). Speech can be articulated in ways which diverge considerably in speed, [[timbre]], pitch, [[loudness]] and [[emotion]]. Speech further exists in different forms such as [[song]], [[Poetry|verse]], [[Vociferation|scream]] and [[whispering|whisper]].

==Mechanism==

Spoken words are sequences of motor movements organized around vocal tract gesture motor targets.&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer LH. (1984). Motor programming in language production. In H. Bouma &amp; D. G. Bouwhuis, (Eds), Attention and performance, X. pp. (17-41). London, Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-86377-005-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocalization due to this is copied in terms of the motor goals that organize it rather than the exact movements with which it is produced. These vocal motor goals are auditory. According to James Abbs&lt;ref&gt;Abbs JH. (1986). Invariance and variability in speech production, A distinction between linguistic intent and its neuromotor implementation. In J. S. Perkell, &amp; D. H. Klatt, (Eds), Invariance and variability in speech processes (pp. 202-219). Hillsdale, NJ, Erlbaum. {{ISBN|978-0-89859-545-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'For speech motor actions, the individual articulatory movements would not appear to be controlled with regard to three- dimensional spatial targets, but rather with regard to their contribution to complex vocal tract goals such as resonance properties (e.g., shape, degree of constriction) and or aerodynamically significant variables'. Speech sounds also have duplicable higher-order characteristics such as rates and shape of modulations and rates and shape of frequency shifts.&lt;ref&gt;Porter RJ. (1987). What is the relation between speech production and speech perception? In: Allport A, MacKay D G, Prinz W G, Scheerer E, eds. Language Perception and Production. London: Academic Press,: 85-106. {{ISBN|978-0-12-052750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such complex auditory goals (which often link—though not always—to internal vocal gestures) are detectable from the speech sound which they create.

==Neurology==

===Dorsal speech processing stream function===

Two cortical processing streams exist: a ventral one which maps sound onto meaning, and a dorsal one, that maps  sound onto motor representations. The dorsal stream projects from the posterior [[Sylvian fissure]] at the [[temporoparietal junction]], onto frontal motor areas, and is not normally involved in speech perception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[Carl Wernicke]] identified a pathway between the left posterior [[superior temporal sulcus]] (a cerebral cortex region sometimes called the [[Wernicke's area]]) as a centre of the sound "images" of speech and its syllables that connected through the [[arcuate fasciculus]] with part of the [[inferior frontal gyrus]] (sometimes called the [[Broca's area]]) responsible for their articulation.&lt;ref name="Wernicke"/&gt;  This pathway is now broadly identified as the dorsal speech pathway, one of the two pathways (together with the ventral pathway) that process speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Evolution and language==
Human language is a vocabulary-based form of communication that  unlike that of other animals employs tens of thousands of lexicals and names. This requires that young humans new to language have the ability to quickly learn both the pronunciations and use of many thousands of words. If children could not repeat speech without problems,  human language could not exist.&lt;ref name="skoyles"/&gt;  This makes the evolution of the capacity of speech repetition a critical innovation needed for the [[origin of speech]]&lt;ref name="skoyles"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Sign language==
Words in [[sign languages]], unlike those in spoken ones, are made not of sequential units but of [[Three-dimensional space|spatial]] configurations of subword unit arrangements, the spatial analogue of the sonic-chronological [[morpheme]]s of spoken language.&lt;ref name="Poizner"&gt;Poizner H.

{{more footnotes|date=August 2008}}

A '''task force''' ('''TF''') is a [[Military organization|unit or formation]] established to work on a single defined task or activity. Originally introduced by the [[United States Navy]],{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}} the term has now caught on for general usage and is a standard part of [[NATO]] terminology.  Many non-military organizations now create "task forces" or task groups for temporary activities that might have once been performed by ''[[ad hoc|ad hoc (designated purpose)]]'' [[committee]]s.
{{army units}}

==Naval==
{{Naval units}}
The concept of a naval task force is as old as navies, and prior to that time the assembly of ships for naval operations was referred to as [[naval fleet|fleets]], [[Division (naval)|division]]s, or on the smaller scale, [[squadron (naval)|squadron]]s, and [[flotilla]]s.

Before [[World War II]] ships were collected into [[Division (naval)|divisions]] derived from the [[Royal Navy]]'s "division" of the [[line of battle]] in which one squadron usually remained under the direct command of the [[Admiral of the Fleet]], one squadron was commanded by a [[Vice Admiral]], and one by a [[Rear Admiral]], each of the three squadrons flying different coloured flags, hence the terms [[flagship]] and [[flag officer]]. The flag of the Fleet Admiral's squadron was red, the Vice Admiral's was white and the Rear Admiral's blue. (The names "Vice" (possibly from advanced) and "Rear" might have derived from sailing positions within the line at the moment of [[Engagement (military)|engagement]].) In the late 19th century ships were collected in numbered [[squadron (naval)|squadrons]], which were assigned to named (such as the [[Asiatic Fleet]]) and later numbered [[naval fleet|fleet]]s.

A task force can be assembled using ships from different divisions and squadrons, without requiring a formal and permanent fleet reorganization, and can be easily dissolved following completion of the operational task. The task force concept worked very well, and by the end of World War II about 100 task forces had been created in the U.S. Navy alone {{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}.

===United States Navy===
In the [[United States Navy]], task forces are generally temporary organizations composed of particular ships, aircraft, submarines, military land forces, or shore service units, assigned to fulfill certain missions. The emphasis is placed on the individual commander of the unit, and references to "Commander, Task Force" ("CTF") are common.

==== History ====
In the U.S. Navy, task forces as part of numbered fleets have been assigned a two-digit number since March 1943, when Commander-in-Chief, [[United States Fleet]], Admiral [[Ernest J. King]] instituted the system of numbering all fleets, assigning the even numbers to the Atlantic and the odd to the Pacific.

Naval Forces, Europe, became the Twelfth Fleet, South Atlantic Force the Fourth Fleet, and Naval Forces, Northwest African Waters, the Eighth Fleet. The Atlantic Fleet, itself, was designated the Second Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;''HyperWar'', [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Admin-Hist/USN-Admin/USN-Admin-4.html Chapter 4: Fleet Administration], accessed August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; 

The United States Navy has used numbered task forces in the same way since 1945. The [[U.S. Department of Defense]] often forms a [[Joint Task Force]] if the force includes units from other services. Joint Task Force 1 was the atomic bomb test force during the post-World War II [[Operation Crossroads]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Road to Trinity |last=Nichols |first=K.D. |year=1987 |publisher=Morrow |location=New York |isbn=068806910X |page= |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In naval terms, the multinational ([[Australia]], [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], and [[New Zealand]]) [[Combined Communications Electronics Board]] mandates through Allied Communications Publication 113 (ACP 113) the present system, which allocated numbers from 1 to 834.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcs.mil/j6/cceb/acps/ACP113AFMC5.pdf |title=Annex A: Task Force Allocations |author=Combined Communication Electronics Board |date=September 2004 |work=ACP 113(AF) Call Sign Book for Ships |publisher=[[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] |pages=A-1–A-2 (197–198) |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228002817/http://www.jcs.mil/j6/cceb/acps/ACP113AFMC5.pdf |archivedate=February 28, 2008 |accessdate=12 October 2010 |authorlink=Combined Communications Electronics Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the Royal Navy's ''[[HMS Illustrious (R06)|Illustrious]]'' [[Carrier battle group|battle group]] in 2000 for Exercise Linked Seas, subsequently deployed to [[Operation Palliser]], was Task Group 342.1.&lt;ref&gt;Operations in Sierra Leone, August 9, 2000, ''[[Jane's Defence Weekly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French Navy]] is allocated the series TF 470–474, and [[Task Force 473]] has been used recently for an [[Enduring Freedom]] task force deployment built around the [[French aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle (R91)|French aircraft carrier ''Charles de Gaulle'' (R91)]]. Task Force 142 is the U.S. Navy's [[Operational Test and Evaluation Force]].

==== Designation ====
The first digit of a task force designation is that of its parent fleet while the second is sequential. Task groups within a force are numbered by an additional digit separated from the TF number by a decimal point. Task units within a group are indicated by an additional decimal. For example, "the third task unit of the fifth task group of the second task force of the Sixth Fleet would be numbered 62.5.3." This system extends further to task elements, individual ships in a task group. This arrangement was typically abbreviated, so references like [[TF 11]] are commonly seen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/navy/group.htm Group]. GlobalSecurity.org. Retrieved 2009-08-30.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no requirement for uniqueness over time (e.g., the [[United States Seventh Fleet]] used TF 76 in World War II, and off Vietnam, and continued to use TF 70–79 numberings throughout the rest of the twentieth century, and up to 2012).

''Post second world war''

During the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 Royal Navy assembled as Task Force 317 to achieve sea and [[air supremacy]] in the [[Total Exclusion Zone]], before the [[amphibious warfare|amphibious forces]] arrived.

===Other===
In Argentina [[Argentine Navy|Navy]] task force (Grupo de Tareas, Task Force) [[:es:Grupo de tareas 3.3.2|G.T.3.3.2 (Spanish link)]] ran task units that were responsible for thousands of instances of forced disappearance, torture and illegal execution of Argentine civilians, many of whom were incarcerated in the [[Higher School of Mechanics of the Navy]] detention center during the 1976–1983 military dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/arg/doc/perren1.html |title=Declaración de Jorge Enrique Perren ante el juez Bonadio |trans-title=Testimony of Jorge Enrique Perren before judge Bonadio |newspaper=Derechos.org |date=30 August 2001 |author= |accessdate=20 January 2016 |language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Falklands War]] in 1982 the [[Argentine Navy]] formed three smaller Task Groups called (''Grupo de Tareas'') for pincer movements against the [[Royal Navy]].

==Army==
In the [[U.S. Army]], a task force is a [[battalion]]-sized (usually, although there are variations in size) ''ad hoc'' unit formed by attaching smaller elements of other units.  A [[Company (military unit)|company]]-sized unit with an [[armored warfare|armored]] or [[mechanized infantry]] unit attached is called a ''company team''. A similar unit at the [[brigade]] level is called a ''[[brigade combat team]]'' (BCT), and there is also a similar ''[[Regimental combat team]]'' (RCT).

In the [[British Army]] and the armies of other [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth countries]], such units are traditionally known as [[battlegroup (army)|battlegroup]]s.

The [[1st Australian Task Force]] (1 ATF) was a [[brigade]]-sized formation which commanded [[Australian Army|Australian]] and [[New Zealand Army]] units deployed to [[South Vietnam]] between 1966 and 1972.{{sfn|Horner|2008|p=177}} More recently, Australian task forces have been designated to cover temporary support elements such the battalion-sized force which operated in [[Urozgan Province]], Afghanistan from 2006 to 2013,&lt;ref name="APH Afghanistan chronology as of 2010"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brangwin|first1=Nicole|last2=Rann|first2=Anne|title=Australia’s military involvement in Afghanistan since 2001: a chronology|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/Parliamentary_Departments/Parliamentary_Library/pubs/BN/1011/MilitaryInvolvementAfghanistan|publisher=Parliament of Australia|accessdate=31 December 2016|date=16 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Northern Territory National Emergency Response|Northern Territory Emergency Response Task Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation OUTREACH|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/opEx/global/opoutreach/index.htm|work=Global Operations|publisher=Department of Defence|accessdate=18 July 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824180209/http://www.defence.gov.au/opEx/global/opoutreach/index.htm|archivedate=24 August 2010|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government==

In government or business a task force is a temporary organization created to solve a particular problem. It is considered to be a more formal ''ad hoc'' [[committee]].

A '''taskforce''', or more-commonly, task force, is a special committee, usually of [[expert]]s, formed expressly for the purpose of studying a particular problem. The task force usually performs some sort of an [[audit]] to assess the current situation, then draws up a list of all the current problems present and evaluates which ones merit fixing and which ones are actually fixable. The task force would then formulate a set of solutions to the problems and pick the "best" solution to each problem, as determined by some set of standards. For example, a task force set up to eliminate excessive government spending might consider a "best" solution to be one that saves the most money. Normally, the task force then presents its findings and proposed solutions to the institution that called for its formation; it is then up to the institution itself to actually act upon the task force's recommendations.

==Other data regarding US task forces==
* Some task forces are named after their commander, such as [[Dunsterforce]].
* [[Task Force Tarawa]], the name given the [[2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade]] during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. They were a [[Marine Air-Ground Task Force]] commanded by Brigadier General Richard Natonski, attached to the [[I Marine Expeditionary Force]].
* [[Task Force Leatherneck]] is the name given the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade during their 2009 operations in Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. They are a Marine Air-Ground Task Force commanded by Brigadier General Larry Nicholson, assigned to work under the [[International Security Assistance Force]].
* US Army [[Task Force Lethal]] is the name for 2-12 Infantry battalion out of Fort Carson, Colorado. Part of the Army's 4th Infantry Division, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 2nd Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment Task Force Lethal. Some of the heaviest firefights US troops were engaged in were in the Kunar province by teams of Task Force Lethal, there to replace members of the 173rd Airborne units and their outpost Restrepo.  Task Force Lethal is assigned to work as part of the International Security Assistance Force.  Task Force Lethal prides itself as one of the Army's premier multi-task light Infantry units that has trained at home in the mountainous regions of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado and excels at high altitude warfare.  The commandos of Task Force Lethal have remained one of the US Army's most elite task forces in the Global War on Terror since the start in 2003.
* [[Task Force 1-41 Infantry]] was a U.S. Army heavy battalion task force which took part in the [[Gulf War]] of January–March 1991. Task Force 1-41 Infantry was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991 and conduct ground combat operations in Iraq engaging in direct and indirect fire fights with the enemy on 17 February 1991. It consisted primarily of the 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, 3rd Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment, and the 4th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, all being part of the 2nd Armored Division (Forward), based at Lucius D. Clay Kaserne, 24 kilometres (15&amp;nbsp;mi) north of Bremen, in the Federal Republic of Germany.

== Task forces in popular culture ==

* In ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]'' and ''[[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3]]'', some of the main characters are from an elite, international special operations task force called Task Force 141.
* In ''[[City of Heroes]]'', a task force was a large-scale story arc of several missions in which 3–8 players took part in, often resulting in a climatic battle against the villain of the story arc.
* In the TV series ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'', Steven "Steve" McGarrett created the so-called "Five-O Task Force" which was a group of [[state police]] based in [[Hawaii]], hence ''Hawaii Five-O''.
*In the fifth ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'' movie, ''The Strongest Rivals'', Coora, the older brother of Freeza, has assembled a group known as the "Coora Task Force". The naming comes from official Japanese merchandise for the movie.

The word '''''thou''''' ({{IPAc-en|ð|aʊ}}) is a [[grammatical person|second person]] [[grammatical number|singular]] [[pronoun]] in [[English language|English]]. It is now largely [[archaism|archaic]], having been replaced in most contexts by ''[[you]]''. It is used in parts of Northern [[England]] and in [[Modern Scots|Scots]] ({{IPA|/ðu/}}), and also in rural parts of [[Newfoundland]] albeit as a recessive feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clarke |first=Sandra |date=2010 |title=Newfoundland and Labrador English |location=Scotland |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=89|isbn=9780748631414  }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thou'' is the [[nominative case|nominative]] form; the [[oblique case|oblique]]/[[objective (grammar)|objective]] form is '''''thee''''' (functioning as both [[accusative case|accusative]] and [[dative case|dative]]), the [[genitive|possessive]] is '''''thy''''' (adjective) or '''''thine''''' (adjective before a vowel or pronoun) and the [[Reflexive pronoun|reflexive]] is '''''thyself'''''. When ''thou'' is the [[grammatical subject]] of a [[finite verb]] in the [[indicative mood]], the verb form typically ends in ''-(e)st'' (e.g., "thou goest"; "thou do(e)st"), but in some cases just ''-t'' (e.g., "thou art"; "thou shalt"), although in some dialects of Old English (mainly in the North), this verb form ended in -s, hence the [[Quaker]] habit of using what looks like the third person form of the verb with "thee" as the subject (paralleling the usage of "you").

Originally, ''thou'' was simply the singular counterpart to the plural pronoun ''[[ye (pronoun)|ye]]'', derived from an [[Proto-Indo-European language|ancient Indo-European]] root. In [[Middle English]], ''thou'' was sometimes abbreviated by putting a small "u" over the letter [[thorn (letter)|thorn]]: þͧ. Starting in the 1300s, ''thou'' was used to express intimacy, familiarity or even disrespect, while another pronoun, ''you'', the oblique/objective form of ''ye'', was used for formal circumstances (see [[T–V distinction]])&lt;ref name="MED"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=yǒu (pron.) |encyclopedia= Middle English Dictionary |date= |year=2014 |publisher=the Regents of the University of Michigan |location= |id= |url=https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/m/mec/med-idx?type=id&amp;id=MED54032|access-date=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the 17th century, ''thou'' fell into disuse in the standard language, often regarded as impolite, but persisted, sometimes in an altered form, in [[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|regional dialects]] of [[England]] and [[Scotland]],&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks, 433–438.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the language of such religious groups as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]]. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry.

Early English translations of the Bible used the familiar singular form of the second person, which mirrors common usage trends in other languages. The familiar and singular form is used when speaking to [[God]] in [[French language|French]] (in [[Protestantism in France|Protestantism]] both in past and present, in [[Roman Catholicism in France|Catholicism]] since the post-[[Vatican II]] reforms), [[German language|German]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Ukrainian language| Ukrainian]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], and [[Scottish Gaelic]] (all of which maintain the use of an "informal" singular form of the second person in modern speech). In addition, the translators of the [[King James Version]] of the Bible attempted to maintain the distinction found in [[Biblical Hebrew]] and [[Biblical Aramaic|Aramaic]] and [[Koine Greek]] between singular and plural second person pronouns and verb forms, so they used ''thou'', ''thee'', ''thy'', and ''thine'' for singular, and ''ye'', ''you'', ''your'', and ''yours'' for plural.

In standard [[modern English]], ''thou'' continues to be used in formal religious contexts, in literature that seeks to reproduce archaic language and in certain fixed phrases such as "[[wikt:fare thee well|fare thee well]]". For this reason, many associate the pronoun with solemnity or formality. Many dialects have compensated for the lack of a singular/plural distinction caused by the disappearance of ''thou'' and ''ye'' through the creation of new plural pronouns or pronominals, such as ''[[yinz]]'', ''yous''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A Handbook of Varieties of English: CD-ROM.|last = Kortmann|first = Bernd|publisher = Mouton de Gruyter|year = 2004|isbn = 978-3110175325|location = |page = 1117}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[y'all]]'' or the colloquial ''you guys''. ''Ye'' remains common in some parts of Ireland but these examples just given vary regionally and are usually restricted to colloquial speech.

==Grammar==
Because ''thou'' has passed out of common use, its traditional forms are often confused by those imitating archaic speech.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Declension===
The English [[personal pronoun]]s have standardized [[declension]] according to the following table:{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
{{Early Modern English personal pronouns (table)}}

===Conjugation===
Verb forms used after ''thou'' generally end in ''-est'' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|-|ɪ|s|t}} or {{IPAc-en|-|ə|s|t}}) or ''-st'' in the [[indicative mood]] in both the [[present tense|present]] and the [[past tense|past]] [[grammatical tense|tenses]].  These forms are used for both [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] and [[Germanic weak verb|weak verb]]s.

Typical examples of the standard present and past tense forms follow.  The ''e'' in the ending is optional; early English spelling had not yet been standardized.  In verse, the choice about whether to use the ''e'' often depended upon considerations of [[meter (poetry)|meter]].

*to know: ''thou knowest'', thou knewest''
*to drive: ''thou drivest'', thou drovest''
*to make: ''thou makest'', thou madest''
*to love: ''thou lovest'', thou lovedst''

Modal verbs also have ''-(e)st'' added to their forms:
*can: ''thou canst''
*could: ''thou couldst''
*may: ''thou mayest''
*might: ''thou mightst''
*should: ''thou shouldst''
*would: ''thou wouldst''
*ought to: ''thou oughtest to''

A few verbs have irregular ''thou'' forms:
*to be: ''thou art'' (or ''thou beest''), ''thou wast'' {{IPAc-en|w|ɒ|s|t}} (or ''thou wert''; originally ''thou were'')
*to have: ''thou hast'', ''thou hadst''
*to do: ''thou dost'' {{IPAc-en|d|ʌ|s|t}} (or ''thou doest'' in non-[[auxiliary verb|auxiliary]] use) and ''thou didst''
*shall: ''thou shalt''
*will: ''thou wilt''
*must: ''thou must'' (not inflected)

In Proto-English, the second-person singular verb inflection was ''-es''. This came down unchanged from [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] and can be seen in quite distantly related Indo-European languages: [[Russian language|Russian]] знаешь, ''znayesh'', thou knowest; [[Latin]] ''amas'', thou lovest. (This is parallel to the history of the third-person form, in Old English -eþ, Russian, знает, ''znayet'', he knoweth, Latin ''amat'' he loveth.) The anomalous development from -es to modern English -est, which took place separately at around the same time in the closely related [[German language|German]] and [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] languages, is understood to be caused by an assimilation of the [[consonant]] of the pronoun, which often followed the verb. This is most readily observed in German: liebes du → liebstu → liebst du (lovest thou). The three languages belong to the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic branch]] of the Indo-European languages, of which West Frisian is the closest to English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fennell |first=Barbara A.|title=A history of English: a sociolinguistic approach. |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2001 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the equivalent of "thou", ''du'', also became archaic and fell out of use and was replaced by the Dutch equivalent of "you", ''gij'' (later ''jij'' or ''u''), just as it has in English, with the place of the informal plural taken by ''jullie'' (''cf.'' English ''you people, you guys'').

In the [[subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] and [[Grammatical mood#Imperative|imperative moods]], the ending in ''-(e)st'' is dropped (although it is generally retained in ''thou wert'', the second-person singular past subjunctive of the verb "to be"). The subjunctive forms are used when a statement is doubtful or contrary to fact; as such, they frequently occur after "if" and the poetic "and".

In modern regional English dialects that use ''thou'' or some variant, such as in [[Yorkshire dialect#Vocabulary and grammar|Yorkshire]], it often takes the third person form of the verb ''-s''. This comes from a merging of [[Early Modern English]] second person singular ending ''-st'' and third person singular ending ''-s'' into ''-s'' (the latter a southern [[isogloss|variation]] of ''[[Thorn (letter)|-þ]]'' (''-th'')).

The present [[indicative]] form ''art'' ("''þu eart''") goes back to [[West Saxon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]] Old English (see [[OED]] ''s.v. be'' IV.18) and eventually became standard, even in the south (''e.g.'' in Shakespeare and the Bible). For its influence also from [[Danelaw|the North]], ''cf.'' [[History of the Icelandic language#The Scandinavian period (550–1050)|Icelandic]] ''þú ert''. For its ultimate origin, see OED ''be'', etymology section i.ε/ζ. The preterite indicative of ''be'' is generally ''thou wast''.

==Etymology==
''Thou'' originates from [[Old English language|Old English]] {{lang|ang|þū}}, and ultimately via [[Grimm's law]] from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] *''tu'', with the expected [[Germanic language|Germanic]] [[vowel]] lengthening in accented monosyllabic words with an [[open syllable]]. ''Thou'' is therefore [[cognate]] with [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Old Norse]] {{lang|non|þú}}, [[German language|German]] and [[Scandinavian languages|Continental Scandinavian]]&lt;!-- = Danish, Swedish, Norwegian--&gt; {{lang|da|du}}, [[Latin]] and all major [[Romance languages]]&lt;!-- = Aragonese, Aromanian, Asturian, Castilian, Catalan, French, Italian, Leonese, Neapolitan, Occitan, Portuguese, Romanian, Sicilian, Spanish BUT NOT Galician, Lombard, Piedmontese, Rhaeto-Romansh, Sardinian, Venetian http://www.nativlang.com/romance-languages/romance-tables.php?tableName=pronounsPersonal--&gt;, [[Irish language|Irish]], [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] {{lang|ro|tu}} or {{lang|es|tú}}, [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|σύ}} ({{transl|el|sy}}), [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ты / ''ty''  or ти / ''ti'', [[Armenian language|Armenian]] {{lang|hy|դու}} ({{transl|hy|dow}}/{{transl|hy|du}}), [[Hindi]] तू ({{transl|hi|tū}}), [[Bengali language|Bengali]]: তুই (''tui''), [[Persian language|Persian]] {{rtl-lang|fa|تُو}} ({{transl|fa|to}}) and [[Sanskrit]] त्वम् ({{lang|sa-Latn|tvam}}). A cognate form of this pronoun exists in almost every other Indo-European language.&lt;ref&gt;Entries for ''thou'' and *''tu'', in ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]''&lt;/ref&gt;
The second person pronouns in [[Uralic languages]] such as [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] are also similar.

==History==
===Old and Middle English===
[[File:Adam and Eve, thou abbrev.jpg|thumb|right|''þ&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;'', abbreviation for ''thou'', from ''Adam and Eve'', from a ca. 1415 manuscript, England]]
In [[Old English]], ''thou'' was governed by a simple rule: ''thou'' addressed one person, and ''[[ye (pronoun)|ye]]'' more than one. Beginning in the 1300's ''thou'' was gradually replaced by the plural ''ye'' as the form of address for a superior person and later for an equal. For a long time, however, ''thou'' remained the most common form for addressing an inferior person.&lt;ref name="MED"/&gt;

The practice of matching singular and plural forms with informal and formal connotations is called the [[T–V distinction]] and in English is largely due to the influence of French. This began with the practice of addressing [[monarch|kings]] and other [[aristocracy|aristocrats]] in the [[plural]]. Eventually, this was generalized, as in French, to address any social superior or stranger with a plural pronoun, which was felt to be more polite. In French, ''tu'' was eventually considered either intimate or condescending (and to a stranger, potentially insulting), while the plural form ''vous'' was reserved and formal.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

===General decline in Early Modern English===
Fairly suddenly in the 17th century, ''thou'' began to decline in the standard language (that is, particularly in and around London), often regarded as impolite or ambiguous in terms of politeness. It persisted, sometimes in an altered form, particularly in [[List of dialects of the English language#Europe|regional dialects]] of [[England]] and [[Scotland]] farther from London,&lt;ref&gt;Shorrocks, 433–438.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in the language of such religious groups as the [[Religious Society of Friends|Society of Friends]]. Reasons commonly maintained by modern linguists as to the decline of ''thou'' in the 17th century include the increasing identification of ''you'' with "polite society" and the uncertainty of using ''thou'' for inferiors versus ''you'' for superiors (with ''you'' being the safer default) amidst the rise of a new middle class.&lt;ref&gt;Nordquist, Richard (2016). "[https://www.thoughtco.com/notes-on-second-person-pronouns-1692677 Notes on Second-Person Pronouns: Whatever Happened to 'Thou' and 'Thee'?]" ''ThoughtCo''. About, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, [[Samuel Johnson]], in ''A Grammar of the English Tongue'', wrote: "in the language of ceremony ... the second person plural is used for the second person singular", implying that ''thou'' was still in everyday familiar use for the second-person singular, while ''you'' could be used for the same grammatical person, but only for formal contexts. However, Samuel Johnson himself was born and raised not in the south of England, but in the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] (specifically, [[Lichfield]], Staffordshire), where the usage of ''thou'' persists until the present day, see below, so it is not surprising that he would consider it entirely ordinary and describe it as such. By contrast, for most speakers of [[Southern English English|southern British English]], ''thou'' had already fallen out of everyday use, even in familiar speech, by sometime around 1650.&lt;ref&gt;Entry for ''thou'' in ''[[Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thou'' persisted in a number of religious, literary and regional contexts, and those pockets of continued use of the pronoun tended to undermine the obsolescence of the T–V distinction.

One notable consequence of the decline in use of the second person singular pronouns ''thou'', ''thy'', and ''thee'' is the obfuscation of certain sociocultural elements of [[Early Modern English]] texts, such as many character interactions in [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s plays, which were mostly written from 1589 to 1613. Although Shakespeare is far from consistent in his writings, his characters primarily tend to use ''thou'' (rather than ''you'') when addressing another who is a social subordinate, a close friend, or a hated wrongdoer.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Carl D. (ed.) (2007). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=a8buSTBjFyUC&amp;q=%22thou...was...the+pronoun%22 Shakespeare's Sonnets: With Three Hundred Years of Commentary]''. Associated University Presses. p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
===Use as a verb===
Many European languages contain verbs meaning "to address with the informal pronoun", such as German ''duzen'', the Norwegian noun ''dus'' refers to the practice of using this familiar form of address instead of the De/Dem/Deres formal forms in common use, French ''tutoyer'', Spanish ''tutear'', Swedish ''dua'', Dutch ''jijen en jouen'', Russian ''тыкать (tykat')'', Polish ''tykać'', Romanian ''tutui'', Hungarian ''tegezni'' etc. Although uncommon in English, the usage did appear, such as at the trial of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] in 1603, when Sir [[Edward Coke]], prosecuting for the Crown, reportedly sought to [[insult]] Raleigh by saying,

:''I thou thee, thou traitor!''&lt;ref&gt;Reported, among many other places, in [[H. L. Mencken]], ''[[The American Language]]'' (1921), ch. 9, ss. 4., [http://www.bartleby.com/185/41.html "The pronoun"].&lt;/ref&gt;
::In modern English: ''I "thou" you, you traitor!''

here using ''thou'' as a verb meaning ''to call (someone) "thou" or "thee"''. Although the practice never took root in Standard English, it occurs in dialectal speech in the north of England. A formerly common refrain in [[Yorkshire dialect]] for admonishing children who misused the familiar form was:

:''Don't thee tha them as thas thee!'' 
::In modern English: ''Don't "thee" (you) those who "thee" you!''
::In other words:  ''Don't use the familiar form "thee" towards those who refer to you as "thee".'' ("tha" being the local dialectal variant of "thou")

And similar in [[Lancashire dialect]]:

:''Don't thee me, thee; I's you to thee!''
::In standard English: ''Don't "thee" me, you! I'm "you" to you!''

See further the [[wikt:thou#Verb| Wiktionary page on ''thou'' as a verb]].

===Religious uses===
As [[William Tyndale]] [[Tyndale Bible|translated the Bible]] into English in the early 16th century, he preserved the singular and plural distinctions that he found in his [[Biblical Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Koine Greek|Greek]] originals. He used ''thou'' for the singular and ''ye'' for the plural regardless of the relative status of the speaker and the [[addressee]]. Tyndale's usage was standard for the period and mirrored that found in the earlier [[Wycliffe's Bible]] and the later [[Authorized King James Version|King James Bible]]. But as the use of ''thou'' in non-dialect English began to decline in the 18th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jespersen|first1=Otto|authorlink1=Otto Jespersen|title=Progress in Language|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924026448203#page/n279/mode/2up|year=1894|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; its meaning nonetheless remained familiar from the widespread use of the latter translation.&lt;ref&gt;David Daniell, ''William Tyndale: A Biography''. (Yale, 1995) {{ISBN|0-300-06880-8}}. See also David Daniell, ''The Bible in English: Its History and Influence''. (Yale, 2003) {{ISBN|0-300-09930-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1662 ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', which is still the authorized form of worship in the [[Church of England]], also uses the word ''thou'' to refer to the singular second person.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cofe.anglican.org/worship/liturgy/bcp/ ''The Book of Common Prayer'']. The Church of England. Retrieved on 12 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Religious Society of Friends|Quakers]] formerly used ''thee'' as an ordinary pronoun; the stereotype has them saying ''thee'' for both nominative and accusative cases.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [http://www.bartelby.net/248/456.html ''The Quaker Widow''] by [[Bayard Taylor]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was started at the beginning of the Quaker movement by [[George Fox]], who called it "plain speaking", as an attempt to preserve the [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] familiarity associated with the pronoun. Most Quakers have abandoned this usage. At its beginning, the Quaker movement was particularly strong in the northwestern areas of England and particularly in the [[north Midlands]] area. The preservation of ''thee'' in Quaker speech may relate to this history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=David Hackett |last=Fischer|authorlink =David Hackett Fischer | title=[[Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways in America]] |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1991|isbn=0-19-506905-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern Quakers who choose to use this manner of "plain speaking" often use the "thee" form without any corresponding change in verb form, for example, ''is thee'' or ''was thee''.&lt;ref name="Quaker Thee"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ezra Kempton |last=Maxfield |title=Quaker 'Thee' and Its History |journal=American Speech |volume=1 |issue=12 |year=1926 |pages=638–644 |doi=10.2307/452011 |jstor=452011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Latter-day Saint]] prayer tradition, the terms "thee" and "thou" are always and exclusively used to address [[God]], as a mark of respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Oaks |first= Dallin H. |authorlink= Dallin H. Oaks |title= The Language of Prayer |url= http://lds.org/ensign/1993/05/the-language-of-prayer?lang=eng |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=May 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many of the Quranic translations, particularly those compiled by the [[Ahmadiyya]] sect in Islam, the terms ''thou'' and ''thee'' are used. One particular example is [[The Holy Quran - Arabic Text and English translation]], translated by [[Maulvi Sher Ali]].&lt;ref&gt;({{ISBN|1 85372 314 2}}) by Islam International Publications Ltd. Islamabad, Sheephatch Lane, Tilford, Surrey GUl 0 2AQ, UK.[https://www.alislam.org/quran/Holy-Quran-English.pdf The Holy Quran, English Translation]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the English translations of the [[Bahá'í literature|scripture]] of the [[Bahá'í Faith]], the terms ''thou'' and ''thee'' are also used.  [[Shoghi Effendi]], the head of the religion in the first half of the 20th century, adopted a style that was somewhat removed from everyday discourse when translating the texts from their original [[Arabic]] or [[Persian language|Persian]] to capture some of the poetic and metaphorical nature of the text in the original languages and to convey the idea that the text was to be considered holy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first = Diana | last = Malouf | chapter = The Vision of Shoghi Effendi | title = Proceedings of the Association for Baha'i Studies, Ninth Annual Conference | date = November 1984 | location = Ottawa, Canada | pages = 129–139 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Revised Standard Version]] of the Bible, which first appeared in 1946, retained the pronoun ''thou'' exclusively to address [[God]], using ''you'' in other places. This was done to preserve the tone, at once intimate and reverent, that would be familiar to those who knew the King James Version and read the [[Psalms]] and similar text in devotional use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/aboutrsv.html Preface to the ''Revised Standard Version''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518063139/http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/aboutrsv.html |date=2016-05-18 }} 1971&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New American Standard Bible]] (1971) made the same decision, but the revision of 1995 (New American Standard Bible, Updated edition) reversed it. Similarly, the 1989 [[Revised English Bible]] dropped all forms of ''thou'' that had appeared in the earlier [[New English Bible]] (1970). The [[New Revised Standard Version]] (1989) omits ''thou'' entirely and claims that it is incongruous and contrary to the original intent of the use of ''thou'' in [[Bible translations|Bible translation]] to adopt a distinctive pronoun to address the Deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/reader.html |title=NRSV: To the Reader |publisher=Ncccusa.org |date=2007-02-13 |accessdate=2010-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206062332/http://www.ncccusa.org/newbtu/reader.html |archivedate=2010-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When referring to God, "thou" is often capitalized for clarity and reverence.

===Literary uses===

====Shakespeare====
Like his contemporaries [[William Shakespeare]] uses ''thou'' both in the intimate, French style sense, and also to emphasize differences of rank, but he is by no means consistent in using the word, and friends and lovers sometimes call each other ''ye'' or ''you'' as often as they call each other ''thou'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

For example, in the following passage from ''[[Henry IV, part 1|Henry IV]]'', Shakespeare has [[Falstaff]] use both forms with Henry. Initially using "you" in confusion on waking he then switches to a comfortable and intimate "thou".

:'''PRINCE:''' Thou art so fat-witted with drinking of old sack, and unbuttoning thee after supper, and sleeping upon benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to demand that truly which thou wouldest truly know. What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the day? ...

:'''FALSTAFF:''' Indeed, you come near me now, Hal ... And, I [[prithee]], sweet wag, when thou art a king, as God save thy Grace{{spaced ndash}}Majesty, I should say; for grace thou wilt have none&amp;nbsp;–

While in ''[[Hamlet]]'', Shakespeare uses discordant second person pronouns to express Hamlet's antagonism towards his mother.

:'''QUEEN GERTRUDE:''' Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended..

:'''HAMLET:''' Mother, you have my father much offended.

====More recent uses====
Except where everyday use survives in some regions of England, the air of informal familiarity once suggested by the use of ''thou'' has disappeared; it is used often for the opposite effect with solemn [[ritual]] occasions, in readings from the King James Bible, in Shakespeare and in formal literary compositions that intentionally seek to echo these older styles. Since becoming obsolete in most dialects of spoken English, it has nevertheless been used by more recent writers to address exalted beings such as [[God]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wyllie.lib.virginia.edu:8086/perl/toccer-new?id=RsvPsal.sgm&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=90&amp;division=div1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040813193259/http://wyllie.lib.virginia.edu:8086/perl/toccer-new?id=RsvPsal.sgm&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=90&amp;division=div1 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=August 13, 2004 |title=Psalm 90 |access-date=May 23, 2017 |df= }} from the [[Revised Standard Version]]&lt;/ref&gt; a [[skylark]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/webstuff/poetry/Shelley-OdetoaSkylar.html ''Ode to a Skylark''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090104055626/http://www.ac.wwu.edu/~stephan/webstuff/poetry/Shelley-OdetoaSkylar.html |date=2009-01-04 }} by [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Achilles]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/166/38.html ''The Iliad''], translated by [[E. H. Blakeney]], 1921&lt;/ref&gt; and even ''[[Thor (Marvel Comics)|The Mighty Thor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paratime.ca/mv1/avengers/thor/thor528.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030917135334/http://www.paratime.ca/mv1/avengers/thor/thor528.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=September 17, 2003 |title=''The Mighty Thor'' |access-date=May 23, 2017}} 528&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', [[Darth Vader]] addresses the [[Palpatine|Emperor]] with the words: "What is thy bidding, my master?" In Leonard Cohen's song "[[Bird on the Wire]]", he promises his beloved that he'll reform, saying "I will make it all up to thee." The [[Kaiser Chiefs]] song "I Predict a Riot" is mentioned below. In Diana Ross's song "[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]" (written by [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s [[Nile Rodgers]] and [[Bernard Edwards]]) we hear the lyric "Respectfully I say to thee I'm aware that you're cheatin'." These recent uses of the pronoun suggest something far removed from intimate familiarity or condescension, while they could be seen as mirroring the mode of address used with the Deity in the Bible as discussed above; or in the case of "Upside Down", may simply allow a catchy rhyme. The use of the pronoun is also still present in poetry to demonstrate extreme intimacy. 

Most modern writers have no experience using ''thou'' in daily speech; they are therefore vulnerable to confusion of the traditional [[Grammatical conjugation|verb forms]]. The most common mistake in artificially archaic modern writing is the use of the old third person singular ending ''-eth'' with ''thou'', for example ''thou thinketh''. The converse{{spaced ndash}}the use of the second person singular ending ''-est'' for the third person—also occurs ("So sayest Thor!"{{spaced ndash}}spoken by Thor). This usage often shows up in modern [[parody]] and [[pastiche]]&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Rob Liefeld]], "Awaken the Thunder" (Marvel Comics, ''[[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'', vol. 2, issue 1, cover date Nov. 1996, part of the ''[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]'' storyline.)&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to make speech appear either archaic or formal. The forms ''thou'' and ''thee'' are often transposed.

In the fictional teenage [[argot]] [[nadsat]], invented for [[Anthony Burgess]]'s novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' (and the [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|film adaptation]]), [[Alex (A Clockwork Orange)|Alex]] and his ''droogs'' regularly use "thou", which fits in with their semi-Edwardian clothing{{clarify|date=February 2015}}. For example, when fighting a rival gang, Alex addresses them thus (note the mixing of "you" and "thou" for the second person):

:''Well if it isn't fat stinking billygoat Billyboy in poison! How art thou, thou globby bottle of cheap stinking chip-oil? Come and get one in the yarbles, if you have any yarbles, you eunuch jelly thou!''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Burgess | first = Anthony | authorlink = Anthony Burgess | title = A Clockwork Orange | publisher = William Heinemann | year = 1962 | page = 15 | isbn = 0-434-09800-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some translators render the T–V distinction in English with "thou" and "you", particularly in places where ''you'' appears in the place of expected ''thou'', or vice versa. This practice has largely fallen out of use. [[Ernest Hemingway]], in his novel ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'', uses the forms "thou" and "you" in order to reflect the relationships between his Spanish-speaking characters and to better represent in English the [[Spanish language]] in which both formal (''usted'') and familiar (''tú'') second-person pronouns still exist.

In reading passages with ''thou'' and ''thee'', many modern readers stress the pronouns and the verb endings. Traditionally, however, the ''e'' in ''-est'' ought to be unstressed, and ''thou'' and ''thee'' should be no more stressed than ''you''.

==Current usage==
''You'' is now the standard English second-person pronoun and encompasses both the singular and plural senses. In some dialects, however, "thou" has persisted,&lt;ref name="northern_england"&gt;{{cite journal | title='You' and 'Thou' in Northern England | first=William | last=Evans | journal=South Atlantic Bulletin | volume=34 | issue=4 |date=November 1969 | pages=17–21 | doi=10.2307/3196963 | publisher=South Atlantic Modern Language Association | jstor=3196963}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in others thou is retained for poetic and/or literary use. Further, in others the vacuum created by the loss of a distinction has led to the creation of new forms of the second-person plural, such as [[y'all]] in the [[Southern United States]]. The forms vary across the English-speaking world and between literature and the spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Persistence of second-person singular===
In traditional dialects, ''thou'' is used in the counties of [[Cumberland]], [[Westmorland]], [[Durham, England|Durham]], [[Lancashire]], [[Yorkshire]], [[Staffordshire]], [[Derbyshire]] and some western parts of [[Nottinghamshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Peter|last=Trudgill|title=The Dialects of England|isbn=978-0631218159|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such dialects normally also preserve distinct verb forms for the singular second person, for example ''thee coost'' (standard English: ''you could'', archaic: ''thou couldst'') in northern Staffordshire. The word ''thee'' is used in the East Shropshire dialect which is now largely confined to the [[Dawley]] area of [[Telford]] and referred to as the Dawley dialect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telford-live.com/2012/10/the-dawley-dictionary/ |title=The Dawley Dictionary|first=Pete|last=Jackson|publisher=Telford Live|date=October 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout rural Yorkshire, the old distinction between nominative and objective is preserved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} The possessive is often written as ''thy'' in local dialect writings, but is pronounced as an unstressed ''tha'', and the possessive form of ''tha'' has in modern usage almost exclusively followed other English dialects in becoming ''yours'' or the local{{Specify|date=September 2008}} word ''your'n'' (from ''your one''):{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The apparent incongruity between the archaic nominative, objective and [[genitive]] forms of this pronoun on the one hand and the modern possessive form on the other may be a signal that the linguistic drift of Yorkshire dialect is causing ''tha'' to fall into disuse; however, a measure of local pride in the dialect may be counteracting this.

Some other variants are specific to certain areas. In [[Sheffield]], the pronunciation of the word was somewhere in between a /d/ and a /th/ sound, with the tongue at the bottom of the mouth; this led to the nickname of the "dee-dahs" for people from Sheffield. In Lancashire and West Yorkshire, ''ta'' was used as an unstressed shortening of ''thou'', which can be found in the song "[[On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at]]". These variants are no longer in use.

In rural North [[Lancashire]] between Lancaster and the [[North Yorkshire]] border 'tha' is preserved in colloquial phrases such as "What would ''tha'' like for ''thi'' tea?" (What would you like for your dinner), and {{"'}}appen ''tha'' waint" ("perhaps you won't"{{spaced ndash}}'''happen''' being the [[dialect]] word for '''perhaps''') and "tha knows" (you know). This usage in Lancashire is becoming rare, except for elderly and rural speakers.

The use of the word "thee" in the hit song "[[I Predict a Riot]]" by [[Leeds]] band [[Kaiser Chiefs]] ("Watching the people get lairy / is not very pretty, I tell thee") caused some comment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/news/top5/2005/09/29/25044.shtml |title=BBC ''Top of the Pops'' web page |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2005-09-29 |accessdate=2010-03-18|archivedate=2010-06-18|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618075108/http://www.bbc.co.uk/totp/news/top5/2005/09/29/25044.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; by people who were unaware that the word is still in use in the [[Yorkshire dialect and accent|Yorkshire dialect]].

The use of the phrase "tha knows" has been widely used in various songs by [[Arctic Monkeys]], a popular band from High Green, a suburb of Sheffield. [[Alex Turner (musician)|Alex Turner]], the band's lead singer, has also often replaced words with "tha knows" during live versions of the songs. His election to sing in his native Sheffield accent and their overall revival of the dialect has been met with positive feedback and critical acclaim.

The use persists somewhat in the [[West Country dialects]], albeit somewhat affected. Some of [[the Wurzels]] songs include "Drink Up Thy [[Cider|Zider]]" and "Sniff Up Thy Snuff".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/homepage/Cider-drinkers-target-core-audience-Bristol/article-1966267-detail/article.html |title=Cider drinkers target core audience in Bristol |work=Bristol Evening Post |date=April 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405190846/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/homepage/Cider-drinkers-target-core-audience-Bristol/article-1966267-detail/article.html |archive-date=2010-04-05 |access-date=April 2, 2010 |postscript=,}} and [http://www.wurzelmania.co.uk/ Wurzelmania.] somersetmade ltd.

''Thoo'' has also been used in the [[Orcadian dialect|Orcadian]] [[Scots language|Scots]] dialect in place of the singular informal ''thou''. In [[Shetlandic]], the other form of [[Insular Scots]], ''du'' and ''de'' are used. The word "thou" has been reported in the [[North Northern Scots]] dialect of [[Cromarty]] as being in common use in the first half of the 20th century and now only in occasional use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambaile.org.uk/en/download/files/The%20Cromarty%20Fisherfolk%20Dialect.pdf  The Cromarty Fisherfolk Dialect], Am Baile, page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in cinema===
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|

}}
The word ''thou'' can occasionally be heard in films recorded in certain English dialect. In [[Ken Loach]]'s films ''[[Kes (film)|Kes]]'', ''[[The Price of Coal]]'' and ''[[Looks and Smiles]]'', the word is used frequently in the dialogue. It is used occasionally, but much less frequently, in the 1963 film ''[[This Sporting Life]]''.

In the 2018 film ''[[Peterloo (film)|Peterloo]]'', the word is used by many of the working-class characters in Lancashire, including [[Samuel Bamford]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

===Use in video games===
All forms of ''thou'' appear in ingame dialogues of the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls video game series]]'' by [[FromSoftware]]. The games are settled in [[late medieval]] [[dark fantasy]] worlds. An earlier example is the original [[Dragon Quest (video game)|Dragon Quest]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].{{Importance inline|date=November 2018}}{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Participants are invited to structure their shared problems with the current system and develop shared visions and goals which are then tested for practicality through the use of experimentation, learning and reflexivity.

== History ==

There have been numerous societal transitions in the past, studied examples include the transition from [[horse-drawn carriage]] to motorised cars and the change from physical [[telegraphy]] to the electric [[telephone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Elzen|first=B|title=System innovation and the transition to sustainability: theory, evidence and policy|year=2004|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of theories that muse over how transition management evolved into being. One school of thought identifies the sociological aspect of transition as deeply rooted within [[population dynamics]] and the evolution of society from high birth rate/high death rate to low birth rate/low death rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davis|first=K|title=The world demographic transition cited by Rotmans et al 2001 "More Evolution than Revolution: Transition Management in Public Policy"|journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|year=1945|volume=237|issue=4|pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theorists consider that transition management has its basis within [[systems theory]] and the co-evolution of social and technical factors within the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shove|first=E|author2=Walker, G |title=Caution! Transitions ahead: politics, practice and sustainable transition management|journal=Environment and Planning|year=2007|volume=39|issue=4|pages=763–770|doi=10.1068/a39310}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most agree that the shift in the political landscape, from a centralised government to a more liberal, market-based structure has allowed new forms of bottom-up governance styles to rise to prominence and a break from dominant approaches.&lt;ref name="loorbach161"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loorbach|first=Derk|title=Transition Management for Sustainable Development: A prescriptive, complexity-based governance framework|journal=Governance|year=2010|volume=23|issue=1|pages=161–183|doi=10.1111/j.1468-0491.2009.01471.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable use of Transition Management can be established through its development into a practical tool by the Dutch Government to manage the radical transformation of their energy systems in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="meadowcroft323"/&gt; It was introduced into national policy in the Netherlands in the fourth National Environmental Policy Plan based on a report by Jan Rotmans, Rene Kemp, Frank Geels, Geert Verbong and Marjolein van Asselt.&lt;ref name=rotmans2001 /&gt;

== Definition ==

Transition management is an approach for tackling the complex issue of sustainable development. Sustainable development in itself is a dynamic, multi-dimensional, multi-actor and multi-level problem that is in a constant state of flux.&lt;ref name="kemp78"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=R |author2=Loorbach, D |author3=Rotmans, J|title=Transition management as a model for managing processes of co-evolution towards sustainable development|journal=The International Journal of Sustainable Development and World Ecology|year=2007|volume=14|issue=1|pages=78–91|doi=10.1080/13504500709469709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics consider that the current [[political system]] is insufficiently equipped to deal with the complexity of the issue and that incremental changes will not address the fundamental system failures that underpin the issue. As an alternative to traditional politics, Transition Management will seek to steer development in a more sustainable direction by identifying and fundamentally restructuring the unsustainable systems that underpin our society. The goal of transition management is geared towards enabling, facilitating and guiding the social, technical and political transformations required by embedded societal systems to bring about [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="kemp2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=R|author2=Loorbach, D |title=Governance for sustainability through transition management|journal=IHDP-conference|year=2003|url=http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/openmtg/docs/kemp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for such a model of governance has arisen through the persistence of problems which have developed to span multi-actors, multi-levels and multi-domains. The inherent complexity of society&lt;ref name="loorbach2007"/&gt; (from the difference of perspectives, norms and values) added to the intricacy of modern-day issues requires a new form of governance. Therefore, transition management recognises the need to address this problem on the multiple levels and dimensions in which it manifests. The approach seeks to widen participation by encouraging [[Grassroots|bottom-up]] approaches that are supported in a [[wikt:top-down|top-down]] manner. The synergy gained from utilising transition management to provide a novel approach to the complex issue of Sustainable Development could be essential if progress is to be made on the issue.

Unlike traditional forms of regulation that use [[command and control]] techniques, transition management does not seek to '''control''' the uncertainties of change but '''steer''', indirectly '''influence''' and '''redirect''' the choices of actors towards sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Loorbach|first=Derk|title=Transition Management: New mode of governance for Sustainable Development|year=2007|publisher=International Books|location=Utrecht, Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the long-term, transition management will seek to completely transform the system through the process of [[creative destruction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schumpter|first=J|title=The Theory of Economic Development|year=1934|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of the literature considers that only the radical rebuilding of our society's systems will be able to transcend the stable lock-in to unsustainable systems which has been systematically reinforced by aspects of the landscape and regime levels.

=== Levels within sociotechnical systems ===
Most literature recognises that there are three separate levels that transition management must work within; Landscape, Regime and Niche:.&lt;ref name="kemp2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="foxon2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Foxon|first=J |author2=Geoffrey P. Hammond |author3=Peter J. Pearson |author4=Jacquelin Burgess |author5=Tom Hargreaves|title=Transition pathways for a UK low carbon energy system: exploring different governance patterns|journal=Paper for 1st European Conference on Sustainability Transitions: "Dynamics and Governance of Transitions to Sustainability", Amsterdam|year=2009|url=http://www.lowcarbonpathways.org.uk/lowcarbon/publications/Sust_Transitions_Conf_paper_Foxon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Landscape''' (Macro) refers to the overall socio-technical setting that encompasses both the intangible aspects of social values, political beliefs and world views and the tangible facets of the built environment including institutions and the functions of the marketplace such as prices, costs, trade patterns and incomes.

These processes occur within the wider political, cultural and economic background termed the socio-technical landscape. The landscape is an external backdrop to the interplay of actors at the regime and niche level.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; Changes can occur in the landscape but much more slowly than regime level. One such change is the increase in environmental awareness.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, A., Vob, J.P., and Grin, J., 2010. Innovation studies and sustainability transitions: The allure of the multi-level perspective and its challenges. Research Policy. 39 pp. 435-448&lt;/ref&gt; This socio-cultural process is leading to pressure on numerous regimes (aviation, agriculture etc.) whilst providing openings for new technologies to establish themselves.

* '''Regime''' (Meso) refers to the dominant practices, rules and technologies that provide stability and reinforcement to the prevailing socio-technical systems.

Technological regimes are defined as a set of rules embedded in an engineering community's institutions and infrastructure which shape technological innovations.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R.R., Winter, S.G., 1982. An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change. Cambridge (MA); Bellknap Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rip, A 1998"&gt;Rip, A. and R. Kemp., 1998. Technological change. In S. Rayner and E. Malone(eds.) Human Choices and Climate Change, Vol. 2, 327-399. Battelle, Columbus, Ohio.&lt;/ref&gt; Geels&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"&gt;Geels, F. W., 2002. Technological transitions as evolutionary reconfiguration processes: a multi-level perspective and a case study. Research Policy 31 pp. 257-1273&lt;/ref&gt; expanded the focus from engineers to include a wider of range of social groups such as policy makers, financiers and suppliers. This web of inter-linking actors, following a set of rules was termed 'socio-technical regime', in effect, the established practices of a given system. Drawing on evolutionary economics; socio-technical regimes act as a selection and retention mechanism, filtering out the unsuccessful while incorporating more worthy innovations into the existing regime.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans, J., to be published 2012. Environmental Governance. Abingdon: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; The regime sits at the meso-level, sandwiched between the micro-level of the niche and the macro-level of the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/spru/publications/imprint/sewps/sewp106/sewp106.pdf Berkhout, F., Smith A. and Stirling, A. (2003). Socio-technological regimes and transition contexts.] SPRU Electronic Working Paper.&lt;/ref&gt; Change occurs at the regime level incrementally and is geared to achieving optimization. Radical change is potentially threatening to the vested interests of the established regime.&lt;ref name="Rip, A 1998"/&gt; The inertia of key industries is seen as an explanation of the difficulties in achieving transitions to sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W., 2010. Ontologies, socio-technical transitions (to sustainability), and the multi-level perspective. Research Policy 39 pp. 495-510&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Niche''' (Micro) is the level or 'area' at which the space is provided for radical innovation and experimentation. This level is less subject to market and regulation influences and can facilitate the interactions between actors that support product innovation.

Radical innovations occur in niches, which act as safe environments in which breakthrough developments can grow, sheltered from the selection process that occurs at regime level.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; A regime may host a range of niches which generate innovations to challenge the status-quo. The military is seen as a primary niche for major technologies of the last century, supporting the development of radio, aircraft, computers and the internet.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; The framework of support provided can be financial (most early ventures being commercially unviable); establishing learning processes and facilitating the social networks that lead to growth.&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt;

Multi-level Perspective
Geels&lt;ref name="Geels, F. W. 2002. pp. 257"/&gt; presents the interplay between regime, niche and landscape concepts as a multi-level perspective depicting technological transitions. The model is heuristic rather than ontological, and is an aid to better understand the process.

Figure 1: A Dynamic multi-level perspective on Technological transition at: http://www.emeraldinsight.com/content_images/fig/0420240602001.png
Geels and [[Johan Schot|Schot]]: 2007&lt;ref&gt;Geels, F.W. and [[Johan Schot|Schot, J.W.]], 2007, 'Typology of sociotechnical transition pathways , Research Policy, 36 (3), pp.399-417&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing processes at the regime and landscape level present 'windows of opportunity' for new technologies to exploit and become established. These breakthroughs tend to occur gradually through niche-accumulation. As innovations are used in multiple applications they build until achieving a critical mass.  The model proposed by Geels shows how the success of a new technology requires developments across all levels to support the processes occurring within the niche (figure 1). Such an alignment is the basis of a regime shift.&lt;ref name="Rip, A 1998"/&gt;

=== Actors ===

Each level has its own set of actors that interact in different ways, broadly they can be defined into the following categories:

* '''[[Government]]''' which creates top-down pressure from regulation, and the use of market incentives, while also encouraging the 'collective learning process' by supporting innovation financially and providing access to information provided by advisory boards&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rotmans|first=J |author2=René Kemp |author3=Marjolein van Asselt|title=More evolution than revolution: transition management in public policy|journal=Foresight|year=2001|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/journals.htm?articleid=874125&amp;show=abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt;
* '''Market-based actors,''' who interact both vertically through the [[supply chain]] and horizontally with other industry leaders to share [[best practice]] and create innovative ideas.
* '''[[Civil society]]''' which is both the user of the end product provided by the market but also [[non-governmental organisations]] which can also provide pressure for change and space for innovation

=== Power and relationships ===

Power within the transition process is distributed rather than being top-down in nature; every actor plays a part in shaping the transition. This distributed power enables the process of mutual [[adaptation]] towards collective goals and the emergence of self-organised socio-technical 'trajectories'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemp|first=R|author2=Parto, S |title=Governance for sustainable development: moving from theory to practice|journal=International Journal of Sustainable Development|year=2005|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://kemp.unu-merit.nl/pdf/IJSD%208(1)%2002%20Kemp%20et%20al.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, power is not necessarily evenly distributed; relationships and the power of actors within any system are always mixed which gives rise to different forms of interaction and transition. Transition management seeks to exploit this opportunity by involving a wide selection of participants within the process. There are also a number of other important reasons for widening the participation of actors within governance. Firstly, most actors will have different preferences, a small group of actors, even if representative, will fail to identify one vision that will be accepted by everybody. By engaging all actors a plurality of visions that share common factors can be established and provide the basis for the next step. Furthermore, the use of widened participation is likely to attract stronger support and therefore less resistance to the transition.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; In order to fully transform the landscape level, the underpinning socio-political values and beliefs will also need to be radically rewritten, without the full involvement of society, this may be susceptible to failure. Finally it has also been considered that the heterogeneity of society allows for collective learning which spurs the development of innovations through exploration at the niche level.&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt;

== A multi-level framework ==

Kemp ''et al.''&lt;ref name="kemp78"/&gt; put forward a framework for identifying the different type of activities of which transition management attempts to align. These activities are broadly divided into, strategic, tactical and operational and each activity has its own actors, agendas and strategies which co-evolve.

'''Strategic activities''' encompass the process of vision development; the collective action of goal and norm setting through discussion and the formulation of long-term goals. Strategic activities will lead to changes in the 'culture' of the societal system at the landscape level. The focus of this activity is long-term in scale (30 years/generations)&lt;ref name="loorbach161"/&gt; and directed towards transition at the landscape level and the system as a whole.

'''Tactical activities''' relate to the interaction between actors that steers development of both institutions in the landscape level and socio-technical structures (practices, regulations, technology) at the regime level. Tactical activities focus on interpreting the visions created by strategic activities into the regime level and into the various networks, organisations and institutions involved.&lt;ref name="kemp78"/&gt; Tactical activities will also seek to identify the barriers that may be encountered (such as regulation, economic conditions) when interpreting these visions into the regime level.&lt;ref name="loorbach161"/&gt; At this stage, actors that have the ability to make changes are recruited to translate the transition vision into their own agendas.

Finally the '''operational activities''' constitute the process of learning by doing through experimentation and implementation at the niche level. It has a much short time span of 0–5 years and is focused on the radical innovation that will transform "societal, technological, institutional, and behavioural practices" that will in turn filter up and transform structures, culture and routines in the regime and landscape levels (Ibid).

A further activity can be considered which establishes the process of assessment and evaluation of societal change.  One can observe that reflexive activities can be both embedded within policy and regulation but also as a function of society and the evaluation of policies through the media and internet (ibid).

== Practice ==

There are number of key aspects that differentiate transition management from other forms of governance, these differences are most apparent due to the model's prescriptive nature. With the concept still being quite fresh and only a handful of case studies to draw from the methodology is still under debate. However, most literature (See References - Loorbach 2007, Kemp, Meadowcroft 2009, Kemp and Loorbach 2003, Foxon ''et al.'' 2009) constitutes the following methodology:

A problem becomes apparent to actors throughout the levels and domains; the first step involves defining the key parameters of the problem then characterising the existing regime and landscape '''pressures'''. Differences in interpretation, perceived pressures, opinions and preference ensues the construction of a plurality of visions and solutions for consideration. A 'basket of objectives' is created which express the '''shared visions''' and goals of the actors.&lt;ref name="kemp78"/&gt; The visions outlined are '''long term''' in nature most commonly spanning at least one generation if not more and are used to inform short-term objectives.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; These visions can be expressed in a number of ways; more common forms include the use of pathways, scenarios and [[blueprints]]. As an example, if the problem of the unsustainable nature of our oil-dependent nation is presented, visions that may be put forward that constitute a [[carbon-neutral]] future include; the [[hydrogen economy]], the all-electric society and the transition to global energy infrastructure to facilitate the maximisation of [[renewable energy]].&lt;ref name="meadowcroft323"/&gt;&lt;ref name="verbong1214"/&gt;
Although each vision will require different socio-technical changes they will all seek to broadly ensure the same goals are met, for example a low or no carbon economy and a secure and reliable supply.

Once the pathways have been created '''short-term 'interim' objectives''' can be formed through [[Backcasting]] (as illustrated by the purple lines in the diagram) and actors within the niche level have the opportunity to form innovative solutions to the problem that may contribute to one of more of the pathways. Transition management will seek to identify those niches that will likely destabilise the regime level and contribute the most to its transformation.&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt; Once identified these niche opportunities can be supported by regime changes such as new policy implementation that provide new funding opportunities. In addition to deliberative steering of such choices, pressure can also filter down from the landscape level in the form of market forces which may also steer transition. '''Experiments''' within the niche level form a series of 'development rounds' which provide information to decision makers regarding the viability of different options.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; The information provided by the development rounds is evaluated and if the options are considered to be viable the solution is rolled out primarily on a small scale. Evaluative information can also be used to inform the overall vision created (as illustrated in red in the diagram). Eventually the development of options [[snowball]] down a particular pathway and a full system transition takes place. Not all development and transition time-scales are consistent within and between the different levels, actors and domains; some change much more quickly than others. In particular, the landscape level is much slower to change than the regime or niche levels; this has led to the concept being labelled as chaotic and non-linear in nature.&lt;ref name="foxon2009"/&gt;

== In the United Kingdom ==

Although being less apparent than the Dutch energy transformation, it appears that there is an increasing pressure for theorists to establish frameworks to guide a similar transition within the UK. The UK energy sector is an example of a socio-technical subsystem that exhibits strong [[lock-in (decision-making)|lock-in]], socially, politically and technically.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt; The technical domain exhibits a strongly centralised infrastructure facilitated by a distribution network, socially speaking the UK energy system is heavily relied upon to provide welfare and enable economic activity. A number of landscape and regime pressures have emerged which impact on the system, primarily related to security of supply and the issue of climate change. The system has also come under pressure from the landscape level in the form of volatile market prices and the impact of the credit crunch. Meanwhile, development at the niche level has continued to build significant levels of alternative technologies and system possibilities through innovation such as [[offshore wind power|offshore wind]], [[Wave power|wave]] and [[tidal power]].

At the regime level, institutions such as the [[European Investment Bank]] are beginning to provide funding to facilitate the resources required to advance such niche technology. Furthermore, policies such as that of the [[Renewables Obligation]] channels funding from the energy industry to support the niche space and development. As per the method, a number of visions are currently being explored, including smart infrastructure, renewable energy alternatives and the viability of hydrogen. The UK Government uses the Renewable Obligation to 'steer' innovators towards particular solutions. More [[Renewable Obligation Certificates]] are awarded to those technologies that are pre-demonstration such as tidal and wave power, while developed technologies such as onshore wind receive less.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DECC|title=Renewables Obligation|url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/uk_supply/energy_mix/renewable/policy/renew_obs/eligibility/eligibility.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919160717/http://decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/uk_supply/energy_mix/renewable/policy/renew_obs/Eligibility/Eligibility.aspx|archivedate=2010-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, although there are a number of indicators that suggest the transition management model of governance could emerge within the sector, (including in-depth literature outlining the methodology and possible pathways) the UK Government's current pathway (embodied in the UK Low Carbon Transition Plan) does not appear to embody the radical transformation required by transition management. Instead of seeking radical socio-technical transformation, the plan seeks to incrementally improve the system by seeking behavioural changes such as energy efficiency and technical changes by enhancing the contribution of renewables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DECC |title=The UK Low Carbon Transition Plan |url=http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/lc_uk/lc_trans_plan/lc_trans_plan.aspx |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314173910/http://www.decc.gov.uk/en/content/cms/what_we_do/lc_uk/lc_trans_plan/lc_trans_plan.aspx |archivedate=March 14, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Without radical infrastructure change the UK risks locking-out a number of promising possible alternatives and may significantly increase the cost of transformation in the future when the need for fundamental systems change becomes more apparent as the current system becomes less able to meet demand.&lt;ref name="rotmans2001"/&gt;

The '''Uhehe fiscal''' (''Lanius collaris marwitzi'') is a [[bird]] in the [[Laniidae]] family.  It is [[Endemism|endemic]] to the uplands of southern and eastern [[Tanzania]]. Some taxonomic authorities treat this species as a [[subspecies]] of the [[southern fiscal]] (''Lanius collaris''). Despite its small population size and restricted range, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has rated this species as being of "[[Least-concern species|least concern]]".

==Description==
The Uhehe fiscal is a slender, black and white bird growing to about {{convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}}. The sexes are similar. The upper parts are dull black, with a white [[supercilium]] and white scapulars. The back, rump and upper tail coverts are dark grey, and the long tail is black. All the tail feathers except the two central ones have white spots. The wings are black except for a small white patch. The underparts are whitish, sometimes washed with buff. It could be confused with the southern fiscal, but its colouration is distinctly darker and it occurs at higher elevations.&lt;ref name=Lefranc&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norbert Lefranc |author2=Tim Worfolk |title=Shrikes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HclLAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159 |year=2013 |publisher=A&amp;C Black |isbn=978-1-4081-8756-2 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Little is known of the habits and ecology of this species, but they are likely to be similar to those of the southern fiscal. It seems to be a shy and rather quiet bird.&lt;ref name=Lefranc/&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
The Uhehe fiscal is found only in southern and eastern Tanzania at elevations of above {{convert|1500|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, from [[Mpwapwa]] and the [[Ukaguru Mountains]] to [[Njombe]], [[Mount Rungwe]] and [[Tukuyu]]. Its typical habitat is scrubland.&lt;ref name=Lefranc/&gt;

==Status==
The Uhehe fiscal has a total population of fewer than 10,000 breeding pairs and a restricted range, but there is no evidence of any substantial decline in numbers of birds, so the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] has assessed its conservation status as being of "[[Least-concern species|least concern]]".&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

'''Video recall''' in [[psychology]] is a research procedure used to obtain an individual’s subjective understanding of their own interactions with others. The procedure involves recording the participants’ interaction with another person and then asking them to review the video while providing feedback about their own interactions, behaviors, and experiences. [[Subjectivity|Subjective]] understanding includes an individual’s affective and [[cognitive]] understandings of an interpersonal event.&lt;ref name = "Welsh"&gt;Welsh, P. W., &amp; Dickson, W.D. (2005). Video-recall procedures for examining subjective understanding in observational data. ''Journal of Family Psychology, 19'', 62-71&lt;/ref&gt; Often the participants’ ratings are contrasted with the ratings of trained coders and researchers who also observe the video.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt;

==History of video recall==
Video recall was first used in research studies over forty years ago. However, the procedure has only been widely used for the past twenty years due to significant advances in technology. Twenty years ago, [[analog device|analog]] videotape players were a big advancement in technology, allowing for video recall to become more popular.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt; Even though they were better than the previous technology used, they had many disadvantages. Analog videotape players required a large amount of equipment, significant training, large amounts of space for storage, were slow, and were prone to malfunction.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt; With the movement towards digital technology, these disadvantages soon disappeared, causing video recall techniques to be much more appealing to researchers and clinicians. Furthermore, changes in psychological theory have led to the increased use of video recall. For example, family psychologists now place an increased value on individuals’ meanings and emotional perspectives, causing video recall to be an extremely useful procedure.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt;

==Procedures==
All video-recall studies involve recording participants' conversations in either a clinical or research setting, and having the participant or participants review the footage in any number of ways. There are three primary types of video-recall procedures that vary in multiple ways.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt; Different methods are better suited for different research questions, and a combination of the three types may be used.

===Continuous===
Continuous video-recall procedures provide consistent, quantifiable data and are often used in marital studies.&lt;ref name = "Gottman"&gt;Gottman, J. M., &amp; Levenson, R. W. (1985). A valid procedure for obtaining self-report of affect in marital interaction. ''Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology, 53'', 156–160.(1985)&lt;/ref&gt; In this type of study, participants review video footage and rate their conversations on a single affective dimension. This may be done with a computerized joystick or a rating dial and it allows for continuous feedback. This method provides a very brief segment length (often 10 seconds), and thus gives precise analyses of interactions within a conversation. While this method only allows participants to evaluate one dimension of affect, it takes the least time of the three methods because it does not require the footage to be repeatedly paused.&lt;ref name = "Gottman" /&gt;

===Semistructured===
When semistructured video-recall procedures are used, the footage is paused at short intervals (typically every 20–30 seconds&lt;ref&gt;Halford, W. K., &amp; Sanders, M. R. (1990). The relationship of cognition and behavior during marital interaction. ''Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 9'', 489–510.&lt;/ref&gt;) during which time participants vocalize what they were thinking or feeling during the segment. These narrations are often recorded for later reference. An alternative method involves allowing the participant to pause the recording and reflect whenever they have input instead of at standardized intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Simpson, J. A., Orina, M. M., &amp; Ickes, W. (2003). When accuracy hurts, and when it helps: A test of the empathic accuracy model in marital interactions. ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 85'', 881–893.&lt;/ref&gt; Semistructured procedures allow for more in-depth analysis of affect, but do not translate well for data analysis. They are, however, more useful in a clinical context than the other two procedures.

===Code-specific===
Code-specific video-recall procedures provide quantifiable data on multiple affective measures. Video footage is paused at set intervals (typically 15–30 seconds), at which time participants rate the interactions of themselves as well as their partners on a series of dimensions&lt;ref&gt;Beaumont, S. L. (1996). Adolescent girls’ perceptions of conversations with mothers and friends. ''Journal of Adolescent Research, 11'', 325–346.&lt;/ref&gt; that are relevant to the research question at hand. This method allows for subjective measurement of many different perceived factors as well as examination of both oneself as well as one's partner or family members. However, code-specific procedures take more time than the other methods, as the video must be repeatedly paused for substantial periods of time.

==Potential Applications of Video Recall==
Video recall is used in a variety of psychological settings. No one procedure is universally appropriate or applicable, so it is important to match specific techniques to specific cases.&lt;ref&gt;Fukkink, Ruben G.. (2008) Video feedback in widescreen: A meta-analysis of family programs. ''Clinical Psychology Review, 28.'' 904-916&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychotherapy===
Video recall is commonly used in [[psychotherapy]] for both counseling and instruction. A therapist will record an interview or conversation with a patient, and play it back to them through different procedural means. Sometimes the patient will narrate their inner thoughts or attribution, while other times they will fill out surveys or answer questions at different intervals. A [[meta-analysis|metanalysis]] of clinical technique of video recall suggested that this method is most effective for families with small children; parents learn successful rearing styles from their own mistakes caught on film. This analysis also suggested that video recall is more successful with skill-learning and instruction than coping mechanisms. However, a successful use of video recall in a [[therapeutic]] session is the recording of a conversation between two family members or friends; both will measure their responses while watching, and comparing answers can yield successful results.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt;

Video recall is also a tool that therapists use to understand their patients. The therapist will record a typical conversation either in the patient's day to day encounters or between the patient and the therapist, and the patient will narrate their understanding of the situation. This is a tool used to overcome cultural barriers.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt;

===Observation and Intervention===
Observational and interventional methods of video recall are most often used in experimental measures of attribution, emotion and social interaction.&lt;ref name = "Gottman" /&gt; Video recall is extremely useful because it can measure patterns in both everyday situations and experimental settings in a less intrusive way than a round table discussion. Video recall can be useful in both group and individual settings.Recall can also measure changes between gender, age, and other [[demographic]] factors, as it allows for specific time-stamping: it contains both quick reactions and long-term feelings. In Welsh's 2005 study of different techniques of video recall, he cites "social constructionism, attachment theory, cognitive–behavioral theories, and symbolic interactionism as theories that are commonly measured through video recall.&lt;ref name = "Welsh" /&gt; Much can be inferred from the relationship between cognitive processes and actual events, as it allows for more personalized coding and measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Rhea, Deborah J., Mathes, Sharon A., Hardin, Kelly. (1997) Video Recall for Analysis of Performance By Collegiate Female Tennis Players. ''Perceptual and Motor Skills, 85'' 1354.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Validity==
Validity is an important aspect of video recall. It is crucial that the researcher provides clear instruction about what specific parts of the video the subject should measure. For example, if a researcher is studying attribution, they should make clear whether the subject should measure their feelings in the past or present, which perspective they should take, and when to measure certain parts.&lt;ref name = "Gottman" /&gt; Delay can be an issue in continuous settings, as subjects may react at different times due to a number of factors. However, Gottman's 1985 study on the use of continuous technique suggested that delay may not change overall effects.&lt;ref name = "Gottman" /&gt;

A way to ensure validity is to utilize inter and intra-rater reliability methods, including time-series analysis. This involves the use of multiple methods at a time. A commonly used method that works alongside video recall is various physiological measures, like heart rate, pulese, cortisol sampling, ACT and skin conductance &lt;ref name = "Gottman" /&gt; This ensures that rating is consistent.

The '''wall of kindness''' ({{lang-fa|دیوار مهربانی}} ''dīvār-e mehrabānī''; {{lang-ur|دیوار مہربانی}} ''Dewar e meherbani'') is a [[Charity (practice)|charity]] work phenomenon and a kind of [[Altruism|welfare]], usually done by attaching cloth hangers from outside of houses; those encourage people to donate miscellaneous useful things such as winter clothing. It was introduced by an anonymous [[Iran]]ian,&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news|last1=kindness|first1=walls of|title=Iranians spontaneously created 'walls of kindness' to help the homeless|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-trending-35132157|accessdate=1 January 2016|work=BBC Trending|agency=BBC|issue=What's popular and why|publisher=BBC UK|date=20 December 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the practice quickly spread throughout the country. The motto of the movement are two sentences which appear on the walls: "leave if you do not need" ({{lang|fa|نیاز نداری بگذار}}) and "take [it] if you need" ({{lang|fa|نیاز داری بردار}}).&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jan/14/irans-walls-of-kindness-offer-help-to-the-homeless#img-1|title=Iran's 'walls of kindness' offer help to the homeless|first=Saeed Kamali|last=Dehghan|date=14 January 2016|publisher=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==

Initially started for the [[Homelessness|homeless]] people of the [[Mashhad]], Iran, the act serves a purpose to support the people in need. In response to social media, large numbers of people are taking part as a campaign and it has helped many homeless or otherwise destitute people during the cold winter weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.dawn.com/news/1174670|title=The wall of kindness: An Iranian venture to feed the poor comes to Pakistan|first=Zoya|last=Anwer|date=25 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail/2016/02/07/449021/Pakistan-happiness|title=PressTV- Wall of Kindness spreads happiness in Pakistan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A wall of kindness was seen in [[Pakistan]]'s [[Karachi]] on 15 January 2016 and another one in [[China]]'s [[Liuzhou]], located in  [[Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region]] on 29 January 2016. Also students of [[Marymount International School of Rome]], in April 2016, have reproduced the idea by designating a wall with similar function and name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.cri.cn/12394/2016/01/29/4202s915117.htm|title=Wall of Kindness Seen in South China|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Xinhua|title=China Exclusive: "Wall of Kindness" provides warmth in wintry China|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/Off_the_Wire/2016-02/01/content_37711388.htm|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=China.org.cn|date=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wall of kindness was set up in Peshawar by Serve Mankind &amp; Wadaan and afterwards it started Spreading all over Pakistan such as, [[Rawalpindi]], [[Lahore]], [[Sialkot]], [[Quetta]], [[Khuzdar]] and [[Karachi]] have witnessed similar walls where people are leaving clothes and other essential items for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.tribune.com.pk/story/31906/have-you-visited-the-wall-of-kindness-in-karachi/|title=Have you visited the Wall of Kindness in Karachi?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kamal Siddiqi|title=Walls of kindness|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1042116/walls-of-kindness/|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=The Express Tribune|date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Amina Khan|first1=Asad Ali Lodhi|title=The wall of kindness: Pavement goes from sex corner to charity spot|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/1041533/the-wall-of-kindness-pavement-goes-from-sex-corner-to-charity-spot/|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=The Express Tribune|date=7 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tara Kangarlou|title=Iranians warm up winter with ‘kindness walls’|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2015/12/25/iranians-warm-upwinterwithkindnesswalls.html|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=Al Jazeera America|date=24 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=INP|title=‘Wall of Kindness’ appears in Lahore|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/national/08-Feb-2016/wall-of-kindness-appears-in-lahore|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=Daily Times Pakistan|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Javed Aziz Khan|title=‘Wall of Kindness’ helps poor get warm clothes|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/print/95687-Wall-of-Kindness-helps-poor-get-warm-clothes|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=THE NEWS INTERNATIONAL|date=3 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wall of Kindness: Helping the poor while challenging stereotypes|url=http://nation.com.pk/featured/02-Feb-2016/wall-of-kindness-helping-the-poor-while-challenging-stereotypes|accessdate=9 February 2016|agency=The Nation|publisher=Nawaiwaqt Group of Newspapers|date=2 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;


A new Wall of Kindness was recently witnessed in Amman/Jordan at the Landmark Amman Hotel on November 21st, 2017, which marked the first day of rain, inviting generous souls including children to donate clothes anonymously for the most in need ahead of the winter season. After donations are received, the laundry team at the hotel picks up the clothes, cleans them, irons them, wraps them up and hangs them back so they are available for the recipients, just like brand new items.   @landmarkAmman



Similar walls known as "Neki ki Deewar" have sprung up in multiple cities across India such as [[Allahabad]], [[Bhilwara]], [[Jhalawar]], [[Mysore]], [[Chandigarh|Chandigrah]], [[Bhopal]], [[Dehradun]], [[Korba, Chhattisgarh|Korba]] and [[Kolkata]] sometimes even having more supply than demand of clothes. The walls are also serving unexpected purpose of keeping walls clean and free from spitting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/neki-ki-deewar-turns-santa-claus-for-the-needy-across-india/story-Bfm7UtYxXRovfEg1Ze19yH.html|title=‘Neki ki Deewar’ turns Santa Claus for the needy across India|date=2016-12-25|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/wall-of-kindness-bring-warmth-and-happiness-to-needy-people-in-bhopal/story-yD6hgrBwac9RHAvqPioWqI.html|title=‘Wall of kindness’ bring warmth and happiness to needy people in Bhopal|date=2016-09-18|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.millenniumpost.in/NewsContent.aspx?NID=349791|title=Wall of Kindness: Helping without boasting|website=Millennium Post|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/wall-of-kindness-bring-warmth-and-happiness-to-needy-people-in-bhopal/story-yD6hgrBwac9RHAvqPioWqI.html|title=‘Wall of kindness’ bring warmth and happiness to needy people in Bhopal|date=2016-09-18|newspaper=Hindustan Times|access-date=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170210/jsp/saltlake/story_134883.jsp |title= Wall reaches discarded stuff to needy|date=2017-10-10|newspaper= https://www.telegraphindia.com/ /|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

The [[economy of Iran]] was hit when sanctions were imposed by the [[Western World]]. As the situation became worse, with an increasing number of unemployed, many could not afford clothes. Inflation caused particular difficulties for those in need. In the winter of 2015, young Iranians in Sajjad Boulevard in Mashhad came up with the idea. The main theme was to meet the demand for resources from charities. For the first time, a wall symbolizes unity rather than separation and the community has been asked to donate voluntarily. As soon as the attempt came to the attention of various social and mass media platforms, it was supported and praised by citizens as well as netizens.

Young Iranians took the chance to strengthen the bonds of community. The campaign went smoothly despite the risk of misuse and loss of resources. People were responsive and well aware of the fact that most vulnerable should get priority.
 
Winter clothing disbursed among mass number of people as a welfare had been seen before,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=concerned to reach blankets|title=Reach winter clothes to cold-hit areas swiftly: PM|url=http://www.bssnews.net/newsDetails.php?cat=0&amp;id=455096&amp;date=2014-12-13|accessdate=13 February 2016|agency=BSS|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; but still, the idea was innovative and showed much intelligence.

==Impact ==
The sharing works of charity had a great impacts of religious point of view regarding [[Islamic]] country like Iran. Like in other religions, charitable work is considered a virtue in Islam, which has driven people to do more for humanity. Like in Iran, people in Pakistan are showing their humanity via this initiative.

'''Ātman''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɑː|t|m|ə|n}}), '''attā''' or '''attan''' in Buddhism is the concept of self, and is found in Buddhist literature's discussion of the concept of non-self (''[[Anatta]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Thomas William Rhys Davids|author2=William Stede|title=Pali-English Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Guw2CnxiucC&amp;pg=PA94|year=1921|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1144-7|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Most Buddhist traditions and texts reject the premise of a permanent, unchanging ''atman'' (self, soul).&lt;ref&gt;John C.

==Early Buddhism==
"Atman" in early [[Buddhism]] appears as "all ''dhammas'' are not-Self (an-atta)", where ''atta'' (''atman'') refers to a metaphysical Self, states Peter Harvey, that is a "permanent, substantial, autonomous self or I".{{sfn|Harvey|1995b|p=17}} This concept refers to the pre-Buddhist [[Upanishads]] of [[Hinduism]], where a person is viewed as having a lower self (impermanent body, personality) and a Higher or Greater Self (real permanent Self, soul, atman, atta).{{sfn|Harvey|1995b|pp=17-19}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Johnston|title=The Mukhya Upanishads|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZUBBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA706|year=2014|publisher=Kshetra Books (Reprint), Original: OUP (1931) |isbn=978-1-4959-4653-0|pages=706–717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''[a]''' {{cite book|author=Michael Daniels|editor=Harris L.

The Buddha argued that no permanent, unchanging "self" can be found.{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=68}}{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=52}} In Buddha's view, states Wayman, "''eso me atta'', or this is my self, is to be in the grip of wrong view".{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=531}} All conditioned phenomena are subject to change, and therefore can't be taken to be an unchanging "self".{{sfn|Harvey|1995|p=52}} Instead, the Buddha explains the perceived continuity of the human personality by describing it as composed of [[five skandhas]], without a permanent entity (Self, soul).{{sfn|Kalupahana|1994|p=69-72}}{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|Ehrhard|Diener|2008|p=27}}

==Pudgalavada==
Of the early Indian Buddhist schools, only the [[Pudgalavada]]-school diverged from this basic teaching. The Pudgalavādins asserted that, while there is no [[Atman (Hinduism)|ātman]], there is a pudgala or "person", which is neither the same as nor different from the [[skandhas]].{{sfn|Fischer-Schreiber|Ehrhard|Diener|2008|p=27}}

==Buddha-nature==
{{Main|Buddha-nature}}

''Buddha-nature'' is a central notion of east-Asian (Chinese) [[Mahayana Buddhism|Mahayana]] thought.{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998|p=83}} It refers to several related terms,{{refn|group=note|Buddha-dhatu, mind, ''Tathagatagarbha'', Dharma-dhatu, suchness (tathata).{{sfn|Lusthaus|1998|p=84}}}} most notably ''Tathāgatagarbha'' and ''Buddha-dhātu''.{{refn|group=note|Sanskrit; Jp. ''Busshō'', "Buddha-nature".}} ''Tathāgatagarbha'' means "the womb of the thus-gone" (c.f. enlightened one), while ''Buddha-dhātu'' literally means "Buddha-realm" or "Buddha-substrate".{{refn|group=note|Kevin Trainor: "a sacred nature that is the basis for [beings'] becoming buddhas."&lt;ref name="Kevin Trainor 2004, p. 207"&gt;Kevin Trainor, ''Buddhism: The Illustrated Guide'', Oxford University Press, 2004, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;}} Several key texts refer to the ''tathāgatagarbha'' or ''Buddha-dhātu'' as "atman", self or essence, though those texts also contain warnings against a literal interpretation. Several scholars have noted similarities between [[Tathāgatagarbha sūtras|''tathāgatagarbha'' texts]] and the substantial monism found in the atman/Brahman tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Hubbard, ''Absolute Delusion, Perfect Buddhahood'', University of Hawai’i Press, Honolulu, 2001, pp. 99-100&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tathagatagarbha'' doctrine, at its earliest, probably appeared about the later part of the 3rd century CE, and is verifiable in Chinese translations of 1st millennium CE.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=104}}

=== Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra ===
In contrast to the madhyamika-tradition, the ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' uses "positive language" to denote [[Two truths doctrine|"absolute reality"]]. According to Paul Williams, the ''[[Mahaparinirvana Sutra|Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'' teaches an underlying essence, "Self", or "atman".{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=98-99}} This "true Self" is the Buddha-nature (''Tathagatagarbha''), which is present in all sentient beings, and realized by the awakened ones. Most scholars consider the ''Tathagatagarbha'' doctrine in ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' asserting an 'essential nature' in every living being is equivalent to 'Self',{{refn|group=note|Wayman and Wayman have disagreed with this view, and they state that the ''Tathagatagarbha'' is neither self nor sentient being, nor soul, nor personality.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=107}}}} and it contradicts the Anatta doctrines in a vast majority of Buddhist texts, leading scholars to posit that the ''Tathagatagarbha Sutras'' were written to promote Buddhism to non-Buddhists.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=104-105, 108}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Merv Fowler|title=Buddhism: Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A7UKjtA0QDwC|year=1999|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-898723-66-0|pages=101–102}}, '''Quote:''' "Some texts of the ''tathagatagarbha'' literature, such as the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' actually refer to an ''atman'', though other texts are careful to avoid the term. This would be in direct opposition to the general teachings of Buddhism on ''anatta''. Indeed, the distinctions between the general Indian concept of ''atman'' and the popular Buddhist concept of Buddha-nature are often blurred to the point that writers consider them to be synonymous."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Sallie B. King, the ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' does not represent a major innovation.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} Its most important innovation is the linking of the term ''buddhadhatu'' with ''tathagatagarbha''.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} According to King, the sutra is rather unsystematic,{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} which made it "a fruitful one for later students and commentators, who were obliged to create their own order and bring it to the text".{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} The sutra speaks about Buddha-nature in so many different ways, that Chinese scholars created a list of types of Buddha-nature that could be found in the text.{{sfn|King|1991|p=14}} One of those statements is:
{{quote|Even though he has said that all phenomena [dharmas] are devoid of the Self, it is not that they are completely/ truly devoid of the Self. What is this Self ? Any phenomenon [dharma] that is true [satya], real [tattva], eternal [nitya], sovereign/ autonomous/ self-governing [aisvarya], and whose ground/ foundation is unchanging [asraya-aviparinama], is termed ’the Self ’ [atman].{{sfn|Yamamoto|Page|2007|p=32}}}}

In the ''Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' the Buddha also speaks of the "affirmative attributes" of nirvana, "the Eternal, Bliss, the Self and the Pure."&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Kosho Yamamoto, ''Mahayanism: A Critical Exposition of the Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra'', Karinbunko, Ube City, Japan, 1975, pp. 141, 142&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra'' explains:
{{quote|The Self ’ signifies the Buddha; ’the Eternal’ signifies the Dharmakaya; ’Bliss’ signifies Nirvana, and ’the Pure’ signifies Dharma.{{sfn|Yamamoto|Page|2007|p=29}}}}

Edward Conze connotatively links the term ''tathagata'' itself (the designation which the Buddha applied to himself) with the notion of a real, true self:
{{quote|Just as ''tathata'' designates true reality in general, so the word which developed into ''Tathagata'' designated the true self, the true reality within man.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Conze, ''The Perfection of Wisdom in 8,000 Lines'', Sri Satguru Publications, Delhi, 1994, p. xix&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It is possible, states Johannes Bronkhorst, that "original Buddhism did not deny the existence of the soul [Ātman, Attan]", even though a firm Buddhist tradition has maintained that the Buddha avoided talking about the soul or even denied it existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= The Two Traditions of Meditation in Ancient India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=AZbZDP8MRJoC|year=1993|publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1114-0 |pages=99 with footnote 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While there may be ambivalence on the existence or non-existence of self in early Buddhist literature, adds Bronkhorst, it is clear from these texts that seeking self-knowledge is not the Buddhist path for liberation, and turning away from self-knowledge is.&lt;ref name=bronkhorst25/&gt; This is a reverse position to the Vedic traditions which recognized the knowledge of the self as "the principal means to achieving liberation".&lt;ref name=bronkhorst25&gt;{{cite book|author= Johannes Bronkhorst|title= Buddhist Teaching in India|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=fjU6AwAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=Wisdom Publications |isbn= 978-0-86171-811-5|pages= 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Self" as a teaching method===
According to Paul Wiliams, the ''Mahaparinirvana Sutra'' uses the term "Self" in order to win over non-Buddhist ascetics. He quotes from the sutra:{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=100}}
{{quote|The Buddha-nature is in fact not the self. For the sake of [guiding] sentient beings, I describe it as the self.&lt;ref name="Youru Wang 2003, page 58"&gt;Youru Wang, ''Linguistic Strategies in Daoist Zhuangzi and Chan Buddhism: The Other Way of Speaking.'' Routledge, 2003, page 58.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the later ''[[Lankavatara Sutra|Lankāvatāra Sūtra]]'' it is said that the ''tathāgatagarbha'' might be mistaken for a self, which it is not.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey, ''Consciousness Mysticism in the Discourses of the Buddha.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press 1989, page 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ratnagotravibhāga ===
The ''[[Ratnagotravibhāga (text)|Ratnagotravibhāga]]'' (also known as ''Uttaratantra''), another text composed in the first half of 1st millennium CE and translated into Chinese in 511 CE, points out that the teaching of the ''Tathagatagarbha'' doctrine is intended to win sentient beings over to abandoning "self-love" (''atma-sneha'') – considered to be one of the defects by Buddhism.{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=109-112}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Christopher Bartley|title= An Introduction to Indian Philosophy: Hindu and Buddhist Ideas from Original Sources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c3D5CQAAQBAJ |year=2015|publisher= Bloomsbury Academic|isbn= 978-1-4725-2437-9|pages= 105}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 6th-century Chinese ''Tathagatagarbha'' translation states that "Buddha has ''shiwo'' (True Self) which is beyond being and nonbeing".{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=102}} However, the ''Ratnagotravibhāga'' asserts that the "Self" implied in ''Tathagatagarbha'' doctrine is actually "not-Self".{{sfn|Williams|1989|p=112}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=S. K. Hookham|title=The Buddha Within: Tathagatagarbha Doctrine According to the Shentong Interpretation of the Ratnagotravibhaga|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JqLa4xWot-YC&amp;pg=PA96|year=1991|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0357-0|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current disputes ==
The dispute about "self" and "not-self" doctrines has continued throughout the history of Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FkXJVKnjw3kC|title=Nibbāna as True Reality beyond the Debate|author=Potprecha Cholvijarn|publisher=Wat Luang Phor Sodh|isbn=978-974-350-263-7|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Thai Theravada Buddhism, for example, states [[Paul Williams (philosopher)|Paul Williams]], some modern-era Buddhist scholars have claimed that "nirvana is indeed the true Self", while other Thai Buddhists disagree.{{sfn|Williams|2008|pp=125–7}}

For instance, the [[Dhammakaya Movement]] in Thailand teaches that it is erroneous to subsume nirvana under the rubric of ''anatta'' (non-self); instead, nirvana is taught to be the "true self" or ''[[Dharmakaya|dhammakaya]]''.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|pp=100–5, 110}} The Dhammakaya Movement teaching that nirvana is [[Atman (Buddhism)|atta]], or true self, was criticized as heretical in Buddhism in 1994 by [[Prayudh Payutto|Ven. Payutto]], a well-known scholar monk, who stated that 'Buddha taught nibbana as being non-self".{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=51}}{{Sfn|Williams|2008|p=127-128}} The abbot of one major temple in the Dhammakaya Movement, Luang Por Sermchai of [[Dhammakaya Movement#Wat Luang Phor Sodh Dhammakayaram|Wat Luang Por Sodh Dhammakayaram]], argues that it tends to be scholars who hold the view of absolute non-self, rather than Buddhist meditation practitioners. He points to the experiences of prominent forest hermit monks to support the notion of a "true self".{{Sfn|Williams|2008|p=127-128}} Similar interpretations on the "true self" were put forth earlier by the 12th [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand]] in 1939. According to Williams, the Supreme Patriarch's interpretation echoes the ''[[Tathagatagarbha|tathāgatagarbha]]'' sutras.{{sfn|Williams|2008|p=126}}

Several notable teachers of the [[Thai Forest Tradition]] have also described ideas in contrast to absolute non-self. [[Ajahn Maha Bua]], a well known meditation master, described the [[Citta|citta (mind)]] as being an indestructible reality that does not fall under ''anattā.''&lt;ref&gt;pp. 101–103 Maha Boowa, Arahattamagga, Arahattaphala: the Path to Arahantship&amp;nbsp;– A Compilation of Venerable Acariya Maha Boowa’s Dhamma Talks about His Path of Practice, translated by Bhikkhu Silaratano, 2005, http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327073822/http://www.forestdhammabooks.com/book/3/Arahattamagga.pdf |date=2009-03-27 }} (consulted 16 March 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that not-self is merely a perception that is used to pry one away from infatuation with the concept of a self, and that once this infatuation is gone the idea of not-self must be dropped as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=UWE STOES|title=Thanassaro Bhikkhu|date=2015-04-22|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S40nS_0R9Y&amp;t=4545s|accessdate=2017-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; American monk [[Thanissaro Bhikkhu]] of the Thai Forest Tradition describes the Buddha's statements on non-self as a path to awakening rather than a universal truth.&lt;ref name="Selves"&gt;"Selves &amp; Not-self: The Buddhist Teaching on Anatta", by Thanissaro Bhikkhu. Access to Insight (Legacy Edition), 30 November 2013, http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selvesnotself.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204143026/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/selvesnotself.html |date=2013-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thanissaro Bhikkhu states that the Buddha intentionally set the question of whether or not there is a self aside as a useless question, and that clinging to the idea that there is no self at all would actually ''prevent'' enlightenment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tricycle.org/magazine/there-no-self/|title="There is no self."|last=Bhikkhu|first=Thanissaro|work=Tricycle: The Buddhist Review|access-date=2018-08-19|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819114904/https://tricycle.org/magazine/there-no-self/|archive-date=2018-08-19|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars Alexander Wynne and Rupert Gethin also take a similar position as Thanissaro Bhikkhu, arguing that the Buddha's description of non-self in the five aggregates does not necessarily mean there is no self, stating that the five aggregates are not descriptions of a human being but phenomena for one to observe. Wynne argues that the Buddha's statements on anattā are a "not-self" teaching rather than a "no-self" teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wynne|first=Alexander|date=2009|title=Early Evidence for the ‘no self’ doctrine?|url=http://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/awynne2009atijbs.pdf|journal=Oxford Centre for Buddhist Studies|volume=|pages=63–64|access-date=2017-04-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170602145336/http://ocbs.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/awynne2009atijbs.pdf|archive-date=2017-06-02|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanissaro Bhikkhu points to the Ananda Sutta, where the Buddha [[The unanswered questions|stays silent]] when asked whether there is a 'self' or not,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.010.than.html|title=Ananda Sutta: To Ananda|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510092025/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.010.than.html|archive-date=2017-05-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a major cause of the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.intro.than.html|title=Introduction to the Avyakata Samyutta: (Undeclared-connected)|website=www.accesstoinsight.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508212946/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn44/sn44.intro.than.html|archive-date=2017-05-08|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Thailand, this dispute on the nature of teachings about 'self' and 'non-self' in Buddhism has led to arrest warrants, attacks and threats.{{sfn|Mackenzie|2007|p=51–2}}
