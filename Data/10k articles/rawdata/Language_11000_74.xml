'''Akkala Sami''' is a [[Sami languages|Sami language]] that was spoken in the [[siida|Sami villages]] of A´kkel (Russian ''Бабинский'', Finnish ''Akkala''),  Ču´kksuâl (Russian ''Экостровский'') and Sââ´rvesjäu´rr (Russian ''Гирвасозеро&lt;!--or Гирвас, see [[:ru:Гирвас (посёлок)]]--&gt;'', Finnish ''Hirvasjärvi''), in the inland parts of the [[Kola Peninsula]] in [[Russia]]. Formerly erroneously regarded as a dialect of [[Kildin Sami]], it has recently&lt;!--meaning when?--&gt; become recognized as an independent Sami language that is most closely related to its western neighbor [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]].

Akkala Sami is the most endangered eastern Sami language. On December 29, 2003, Maria Sergina &amp;ndash; one of the last fluent native speakers of Akkala Sami &amp;ndash; died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galdu.org/govat/doc/nordisk_samekonvensjon.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-02-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411023150/http://www.galdu.org/govat/doc/nordisk_samekonvensjon.pdf |archivedate=2007-04-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rantala, Leif, Aleftina Sergina 2009.

The Sami Language Situation in Russia. In: "Ethnic and Linguistic Context of Identity: Finno-Ugric Minorities." Uralica Helsingiensia 5. Helsinki. 79–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining ethnic Akkala Samis live in the village [[Yona, Russia|Yona]].

Although there exist a description of Akkala Sami phonology and morphology, a few published texts, and archived audio recordings,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; the Akkala Sami language remains among the most poorly documented Sami languages. {{cn|date=July 2016}}

==Phonology==

{{Empty section|date=December 2012}}

==Morphology==
The following overview is based on P. M. Zaykov's monograph.&lt;ref&gt;Зайков, П. М. ''Бабинский диалект саамского языка (фонолого-морфологическое исследование)''. Петрозаводск: «Карелия», 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Zaykov's [[Uralic Phonetic Alphabet|Uralic phonetic]] transcription is retained here. The middle dot ˑ denotes palatalization of the preceding consonant, analyzed by Zaykov as [[Semisoft sign|semisoft]] pronunciation.

===Noun===
Akkala Sami has 8 [[Grammatical case|cases]], [[Grammatical number|singular and plural]]: [[Nominative case|nominative]], [[Genitive case|genitive]]-[[Accusative case|accusative]], [[Partitive case|partitive]], [[Dative case|dative]]-[[Illative case|illative]], [[Locative case|locative]], [[Essive case|essive]], [[Comitative case|comitative]] and [[Abessive case|abessive]]. Case and number are expressed by a combination of endings and [[consonant gradation]]:
* Nominative: no marker in the singular, weak grade in the plural.
* Genitive-accusative: weak grade in the singular, weak grade + ''-i'' in the plural.
* Partitive: this case exists only in the singular, and has the ending ''-tti͔''.
* Dative-illative: strong grade + ''-a'', ''-a͕'' or ''-ɛ'' in the singular, weak grade + ''-i'' in the plural.
* Locative: weak grade + ''-st'', ''-śtˑ'' in the singular, weak grade + ''-nˑ'' in the plural.
* Essive: this case exists only in the singular: strong grade + ''-nˑ''.
* Comitative: weak grade + ''-nˑ'' in the singular, strong grade + ''-guim'', ''-vuim'' or ''-vi̮i̭m'' in the plural.
* Abessive: weak grade + ''-ta'' in the singular.

===Pronoun===
The table below gives the declension of the [[personal pronoun]]s ''monn'' ‘I’ and ''mij'' ‘we’. The pronouns ''tonn'' ‘you (sg.)’ and ''sonn'' ‘(s)he’ are declined like ''monn'', the pronouns ''tij'' ‘you (pl.)’ and ''sij'' ‘they’ are declined like ''mij''.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!&amp;nbsp;

|-
|Nominative || monn || mij

|Genitive-Accusative || mū || mii̭ji
|-
|Essive || munˑ || ---

|-
|Locative || muśtˑ || miśtˑ
|-
|Comitative || muinˑ || mii̭jivuim
|-
|Abessive || muta || mii̭ta
|}

The [[Interrogative word|interrogative pronoun]]s ''mī'' ‘what?’ and ''tˑī'', ''kī'' ‘who?’ are declined as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!&amp;nbsp;
!''mī'' ‘what?’
!''tˑī'', ''kī'' ‘who?’
|-
|Nominative || mī || tˑī, kī

|Abessive || mi̮nta || ḱanta

The [[Demonstrative#Distal and proximal demonstratives|proximal]] [[demonstrative]] ''tˑa͕t'' ‘this’ and the medial demonstrative ''ti̮t'' ‘that’ are declined as follows:

|}

===Verb===

Akkala Sami [[verb]]s have three [[Grammatical person|persons]] and two numbers, singular and plural. There are three [[Grammatical mood|moods]]: [[Grammatical mood#Indicative|indicative]], [[Imperative mood|imperative]] and [[Conditional mood|conditional]]; the [[Grammatical mood#Potential|potential]] mood has disappeared. Below, the paradigm of the verbs ''va͕n̄ˑće'' ‘to walk’ and ''korrɛ'' ‘to knit’ is given in the present and imperfect tense:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!&amp;nbsp;
!Present
!Imperfect
!Present
!Imperfect
|-
|1sg. || vā͕nʒam || va͕n̄ˑcim || kōram || korri͔m
|-
|2sg. || va͕nʒak || vā͕nˑcik || kōrak || korri͔k
|-
|3sg. || va͕n̄ˑc || vānˑʒi || korr || kōri͔
|-
|1pl. || va͕n̄ˑćepˑ || vānˑʒim || korrɛpˑ || kōri͔m
|-
|2pl. || va͕nˑćepˑpˑe || vānˑʒitˑ || korrɛpˑpˑe || kōri͔tˑ
|-
|3pl. || vā͕nˑʒatˑ || van̄ˑciš || kōratˑ || korri͔š
|}

The verb ''ĺiije'' ‘to be’ conjugates as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!&amp;nbsp;
!Present
!Imperfect
|-
|1sg. || ĺam || ĺii̭jim
|-
|2sg. || ĺak || ĺiijik
|-
|3sg. || ĺie || ĺai
|-
|1pl. || ĺepˑ || ĺījim
|-
|2pl. || ĺepˑpˑe || ĺījitˑ
|-
|3pl. || ĺetˑ || ĺii̭jiš
|}

Compound tenses such as [[Perfect (grammar)|perfect]] and [[pluperfect]] are formed with the verb ''ĺii̭je'' in the present or imperfect as [[Auxiliary verb|auxiliary]], and the [[participle]] of the main verb. Examples are ''ĺam tĭĕhtmi̮nč'' ‘I have known’ from ''tĭĕhttɛ'' ‘to know’, and ''ĺai tui̭jāma'' ‘(s)he had made’ from ''tui̭je'' ‘to make’.

The conditional mood has the marker ''-č'', which is added to the weak grade of the stem: ''kuarčim'' ‘I would sew’, ''vizzčik'' ‘you (sg.) would become tired’.

As in other Sami languages, Akkala Sami makes use of a [[negative verb]] that conjugates according to person and number, while the main verb remains unchanged. The conjugation of the negative verb is shown here together with the verb ''aĺ̄ḱe'' ‘to begin’:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!&amp;nbsp;
|-
|1sg. || jim aĺg
|-
|2sg. || jik aĺg
|-
|3sg. || ij aĺg
|-
|1pl. || jepˑ aĺg
|-
|2pl. || jepˑpˑe aĺg
|-

'''Augusto do Rosário Rodrigues''' was a [[Goa]]n short-story writer and poet.

==Life==

Very little is known about the life of Augusto do Rosário Rodrigues. He was born in 1910 and appears to have been an advocate by profession.&lt;ref&gt;Vimala Devi and Manuel de Seabra.''A Literatura Indo-Portuguesa''.Lisbon: Agência Geral do Ultramar, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; He "appears to have passed away in 1999".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro. ''Lengthening Shadows''. 2 vols. Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016. I p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was born in the village of benaulim south Goa. Many roads in benaulim are named with his name after his death

==Work==

Rodrigues produced short stories for the "Renascença" programme of [[All-India Radio]], which were later collected and published in a collection entitled ''Contos Regionais'', or "Regional Stories", in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;Augusto do R. Rodrigues, ''Contos regionais'' (Goa: Tipografia Rangel, 1987), apparently first published Goa: [s. n.], 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that this title was also used by the Goan short-story writer [[José da Silva Coelho]], whose work was rediscovered by [[Vimala Devi|Devi]] and Seabra, there is a possibility that Rodrigues was giving a sly wink back to his predecessor.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro. ''Lengthening Shadows''. 2 vols. Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016. I pp. 51-52.&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his stories have been translated into English: ''O Capitão Tarimbeiro'' (as ''Risen from the Ranks'') and ''O Herdeiro dos Cabrais'' (as ''The Scion of the Cabral Family'').&lt;ref&gt;Paul Melo e Castro. ''Lengthening Shadows''. 2 vols. Saligão, India: Goa, 1556, 2016. II pp. 160-4 and 165-77 respectively.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

Many of Rodrigues's stories are historical, ranging from the eighteenth century right up until his present day. Focussing on [[Christianity in Goa|Goa's Catholic community]], his stories often revolve around issues of decline and recovery. The Goan critic Bailon de Sá described his collection as showing a sort of "inside out [[exoticism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bailón de Sá, "Contos Regionais por Augusto do R. Rodrigues, Tipografia Rangel, Bastorá, Goa, pp.166"  Boletim do Instituto Menezes Rodrigues, 157, 1988, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boor''' (also known as Bwara, Damraw) is an endangered [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language spoken in southern [[Chad]].&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; The language has less than 100 native speakers worldwide. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://endangeredlanguages.com/#/7/15.622/21.302/0/100000/0/low/mid/high/dormant/awakening/unknown|title=Endangered Languages Project|website=endangeredlanguages.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regions where the language is spoken include southern [[Chad]], the [[Bousso]] Subprefecture, [[Sarh]] Rural Subprefecture, and in and around the Dumraw village on the north bank of the [[Chari River]].

Due to the locations of the regions in which the language is spoken, native speakers of Boor commonly speak the [[Bagirmi language]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.ethnologue.com/14/show_language.asp?code=BVF|title=Ethnologue 14 report for language code:BVF|website=archive.ethnologue.com|access-date=2017-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''co-premise''' is a [[premise]] in [[reasoning]] and [[informal logic]] which is not the main supporting reason for a [[main contention|contention]] or a [[Lemma (logic)|lemma]], but is logically necessary to ensure the [[Validity (logic)|validity]] of an [[argument]]. One premise by itself, or a group of co-premises can form a reason. 

== Logical structure ==

Every significant term or phrase appearing in a premise of a [[simple argument]], should also appear in the contention/conclusion or in a co-premise. But this by itself does not guarantee a valid argument, see the [[fallacy of the undistributed middle]] for an example of this.

Sometimes a co-premise will not be explicitly stated. This type of argument is known as an 'enthymematic' argument, and the co-premise may be referred to as a 'hidden' or an 'unstated' co-premise and will often be subject to an [[inference objection]]. In this [[argument map]] of a simple argument the two reasons for the main contention are co-premises and not separate reasons for believing the contention to be true. They are both necessary to ensure that the argument as a whole retains logical validity.

{{-}}
In this example, "What the Bible says is true" is a hidden co-premise.

'''Computational semiotics''' is an interdisciplinary field that applies, conducts, and draws on research in [[logic]], [[mathematics]], the [[theory of computation|theory]] and [[computer programming|practice]] of [[computer science|computation]], [[formal language|formal]] and [[natural language|natural]] [[linguistics|language studies]], the [[cognitive science]]s generally, and [[semiotics]] proper.  A common theme of this work is the adoption of a [[sign (semiotics)|sign-theoretic]] perspective on issues of [[artificial intelligence]] and [[knowledge representation]].  Many of its applications lie in the field of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) and fundamental devices of recognition.

One part of this field, known as [[algebraic semiotics]], combines aspects of [[algebra]]ic specification and social semiotics, and has been applied to [[user interface]] design and to the representation of [[mathematical proof]]s.

In mathematics, the '''crank conjecture''' was a conjecture about the existence of the [[crank of a partition]] that separates partitions of a number [[modular arithmetic|congruent]] to 6&amp;nbsp;mod&amp;nbsp;11 into 11 equal classes.  The conjecture was introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Freeman Dyson|last=Dyson|year=1944}} and proved by {{harvs|txt|last1=Andrews|last2=Garvan|year=1987}}.

==Critical response==
Of Ní Ghríofa's book ''Clasp'', Maya Catherine Popa in ''[[Poetry]]'' wrote: 
"The poems excel in their consideration of motherhood, particularly its paradoxical losses and gains, separation and unity… In Ní Ghríofa’s English debut, what seem to be long-considered obsessions are explored with tenderness and unflinching curiosity. The collection’s section titles, “Clasp,” “Cleave,” “Clench,” suggest the muscularity of attachment to the past, place, and the body that drives the poetic impulse."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/article/250854#article "Poetry Magazine Review"]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Clíona Ní Riordáin of ''Southword'', "The woman’s body is central to the collection, highlighted, visible, unconquered. Forgotten bones are reclaimed, gendered territory is staked out; it is clear that Ní Ghríofa’s has a voice which will not be silenced… In ''Clasp'' Ní Ghríofa has signalled that she is a poetic force to be reckoned with.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.munsterlit.ie/Southword/Issues/27A/clasp.html "Southword Review"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dolittle''' (Japanese ドリトル ''doritoru'') is a programming language developed at the [[Osaka Electro-Communication University]] &lt;!--by 兼宗進--&gt;. Unlike the majority of programming languages it uses keywords based on [[Japanese language|Japanese]]&lt;ref&gt;The Dolittle programming language [http://dolittle.eplang.jp/] (Japanese [https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fdolittle.eplang.jp%2Findex.php&amp;act=url|Translated])&lt;/ref&gt; and written in [[Japanese script]]. It is named after the character [[Dr Dolittle]]. It is easier for learners whose native language is Japanese to make early progress in understanding programming.

==Features==
The languages uses Chinese keywords, although Korean and English-based versions of the language also exist. The syntax is based on Japanese word order (Subject Object Verb), which is unnatural in English. The language is prototype-based and object-oriented.

The language has native facilities for [[Turtle graphics]], including easy-to-use [[collision detection]], and musical output using the Sakura library and notation to generate Midi. The language has been ported to [[Arduino]] for robotic systems.

The language is implemented in [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and so runs on a range of systems. It is distributed for free, and in an online version [http://dolittle.eplang.jp/web/applet.html]

==Example program==
This example creates two turtles and two buttons for controlling them. 
  かめ太＝タートル！作る。
  カメ＝タートル！　作る。
  時計＝タイマー！　作る　0.1秒　間隔　500回　回数。 時計！　「かめ太！　１０　歩く」　実行。
  左＝ボタン！”左”作る。 左：動作＝「かめ太！　２０　左回り」。
  右＝ボタン！”右”作る。 右：動作＝「かめ太！　10　右回り」。

'''Emma Huismans''' (born July 10, 1947) is an [[Afrikaans]] writer, journalist, and activist born in the [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.let.leidenuniv.nl/Dutch/ModerneLetterkunde/Huismans1.html|title=Scriptie over Huismans|website=www.let.leidenuniv.nl|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of five her family moved to South Africa where she learned Afrikaans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biografieportaal.nl/author/emma-huismans/|title=Emma Huismans, auteur op Biografieportaal|website=Biografieportaal|language=nl-NL|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later a reporter for [[The Crisis (newspaper)|Crisis News]]. Her efforts against [[apartheid]] were complicated by her being white, Afrikaans, and [[lesbian]]. This is dealt with in her premier work ''Berigte van weerstand.''

{{DISPLAYTITLE:Fiber to the ''x''}}
[[File:FTTX.svg|thumb|300px|right|A schematic illustrating how FTTX architectures vary with regard to the distance between the optical fiber and the [[end user]]. The building on the left is the [[Telephone exchange|central office]]; the building on the right is one of the buildings served by the central office. Dotted rectangles represent separate living or office spaces within the same building.]]
'''Fiber to the ''x''''' ('''FTTX''') (also spelled '''Fibre to the ''x''''') or '''fiber in the loop''' is a generic term for any [[broadband]] network architecture using [[optical fiber]] to provide all or part of the [[local loop]] used for [[last mile]] [[telecommunication]]s. As fiber optic cables are able to carry much more data than copper cables, especially over long distances, copper telephone networks built in the [[20th century]] are being replaced by fiber.

FTTX is a generalization for several configurations of fiber deployment, arranged into two groups: FTTP/FTTH/FTTB (Fiber laid all the way to the premises/home/building) and FTTC/N (fiber laid to the cabinet/node, with copper wires completing the connection).

Residential areas already served by balanced pair distribution plant call for a trade-off between cost and capacity. The closer the fiber head, the higher the cost of construction and the higher the channel capacity. In places not served by metallic facilities, little cost is saved by not running fiber to the home.

'''Fiber to the x''' is the key method used to drive '''next-generation access''' ('''NGA'''), which describes a significant upgrade to the Broadband available by making a step change in speed and quality of the service. This is typically thought of as asymmetrical with a download speed of 24&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s plus and a fast upload speed. The Definition of UK Superfast Next Generation Broadband&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Definition of UK Superfast Next Generation Broadband |author=Mark Jackson |date= 25 October 2010 |work= ISP Review |url= http://www.ispreview.co.uk/articles/10_Definition_of_UK_Superfast_NGA_Broadband/index.php |accessdate= 3 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
OFCOM have defined NGA as in "Ofcom's March 2010 'Review of the wholesale local access market" 
"Super-fast broadband is generally taken to mean broadband products that provide a maximum download speed that is greater than 24&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s. This threshold is commonly considered to be the maximum speed that can be supported on current generation (copper-based) networks."

A similar network called a [[hybrid fiber-coaxial]] (HFC) network is used by [[cable television]] operators but is usually not synonymous with "fiber In the loop", although similar advanced services are provided by the HFC networks. [[Fixed wireless]] and mobile wireless technologies such as [[Wi-Fi]], [[WiMAX]] and [[3GPP Long Term Evolution]] (LTE) are an alternative for providing [[Internet access]].

==Definitions==
The telecommunications industry differentiates between several distinct FTTX configurations. The terms in most widespread use today are:
*'''FTTP''' (fiber-to-the-premises): This term is used either as a blanket term for both FTTH and FTTB, or where the fiber network includes both homes and small businesses
**'''FTTH''' (fiber-to-the-home): Fiber reaches the boundary of the living space, such as a box on the outside wall of a home. [[Passive optical network]]s and [[Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet|point-to-point Ethernet]] are architectures that are capable of delivering [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple-play]] services over FTTH networks directly from an operator's [[telephone exchange|central office]].&lt;ref&gt;Tim Poulus, [http://www.telecompaper.com/research/ftth-networking-active-ethernet-versus-passive-optical-networking-and-point-to-point-vs-point-to-multipoint "FTTH networking: Active Ethernet versus Passive Optical Networking and point-to-point vs. point-to-multipoint"], ''Telecompaper'', 17 November 2010. Retrieved 12 July 2013. {{Subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ed Gubbins, [http://nxtcommnews.com/ethernet/news08/active-ethernet-pon "Active Ethernet grows in PON's shadow"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001173226/http://nxtcommnews.com/ethernet/news08/active-ethernet-pon/ |date=2011-10-01 }}, ''NXTcomm Daily News'', Penton Media, 13 May 2008. Retrieved 12 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
**'''FTTB''' (fiber-to-the-building, -business, or -basement): Fiber reaches the boundary of the building, such as the basement in a [[multi-family residential|multi-dwelling unit]], with the final connection to the individual living space being made via alternative means, similar to the curb or pole technologies
**'''FTTD''' (fiber-to-the-desktop): Fiber connection is installed from the main computer room to a terminal or [[fiber media converter]] near the user's desk
**'''FTTR''' (fiber-to-the-router): Fiber connection is installed from the router to the ISP's fiber network
**'''FTTO''' ([[Fiber to the Office|fiber-to-the-office]]): Fiber connection is installed from the main computer room/core switch to a special mini-switch (called FTTO Switch) located at the user´s workstation or service points. This mini-switch provides Ethernet services to end user devices via standard [[twisted pair]] patch cords. The switches are located decentrally all over the building, but managed from one central point
**'''FTTF''' (fiber-to-the-frontage): This is very similar to FTTB. In a fiber to the front yard scenario, each fiber node serves a single subscriber. This allows for multi-gigabit speeds using [[G.fast#XG-fast|XG-fast]] technology. The fiber node may be reverse-powered by the subscriber modem&lt;ref name=FTTF&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7355589/ |title=XG-fast: the 5th generation broadband |publisher=IEEE Xplore}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''FTTE''' / '''FTTZ''' ([[fiber to the telecom enclosure|fiber-to-the-telecom-enclosure]] or [[fiber to the telecom enclosure|fiber-to-the-zone]]): is a form of [[structured cabling]] typically used in enterprise [[local area network]]s, where fiber is used to link the main computer equipment room to an enclosure close to the desk or workstation. FTTE and FTTZ are not considered part of the FTTX group of technologies, despite the similarity in name.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Reid, [http://cim.pennnet.com/Articles/Article_Display.cfm?Section=ARCHI&amp;ARTICLE_ID=283326&amp;VERSION_NUM=2&amp;p=27 "All multimode fiber is not created equal"], Cabling Installation &amp; Maintenance, PennWell Corporation, February 2007, retrieved 12 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''FTTdp''' (Fiber To The Distribution Point): This is very similar to FTTC / FTTN but is one-step closer again moving the end of the fiber to within meters of the boundary of the customers premises in last junction possible junction box known as the "distribution point" this allows for near-gigabit speeds&lt;ref name=heath&gt;{{cite news |last1 =Heath |first1 =Nick|title = Could ultrafast broadband over copper speed the rollout of gigabit internet? |url = http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/european-technology/could-ultrafast-broadband-over-copper-speed-the-rollout-of-gigabit-internet |work= TechRepublic|date= September 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''FTTN / FTTLA''' (fiber-to-the-node, -neighborhood, or -last-amplifier): Fiber is terminated in a street cabinet, possibly miles away from the customer premises, with the final connections being copper. FTTN is often an interim step toward full FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) and is typically used to deliver 'advanced' [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple-play]] telecommunications services
*'''FTTC / FTTK''' (fiber-to-the-curb/kerb, -closet, or -cabinet): This is very similar to FTTN, but the street cabinet or pole is closer to the user's premises, typically within {{convert|1000|ft|m|}}, within range for high-bandwidth copper technologies such as wired [[ethernet]] or [[IEEE 1901]] [[power line communication|power line networking]] and wireless [[Wi-Fi]] technology. FTTC is occasionally ambiguously called FTTP (fiber-to-the-pole), leading to confusion with the distinct fiber-to-the-premises system

To promote consistency, especially when comparing FTTH penetration rates between countries, the three FTTH Councils of Europe, North America, and Asia-Pacific agreed upon definitions for FTTH and FTTB in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= FTTH Council – Definition of Terms |date= August 11, 2006 |url= http://www.ftthcouncil.org/sites/default/files/FTTH_definitions.pdf |publisher= FTTH Council |accessdate= September 1, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} &lt;/ref&gt; with an update in 2009,&lt;ref name="council2009"&gt;{{cite web |title= FTTH Council – Definition of Terms |date= January 9, 2009 |url= http://www.ftthcouncilmena.org/documents/FTTHdefinitions/FTTH-Definitions-Revision_January_2009.pdf |publisher= FTTH Council |accessdate= June 22, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150603182526/http://www.ftthcouncilmena.org/documents/FTTHdefinitions/FTTH-Definitions-Revision_January_2009.pdf |archive-date= 2015-06-03 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2011&lt;ref name="council2011"&gt;{{cite web |title= FTTH Council – Definition of Terms |date= September 2011 |url= http://ftthcouncil.eu/documents/Publications/FTTH_Definition_of_Terms-Revision_2011-Final.pdf |publisher= FTTH Council |accessdate= June 27, 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131008080350/http://www.ftthcouncil.eu/documents/Publications/FTTH_Definition_of_Terms-Revision_2011-Final.pdf |archivedate= October 8, 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another in 2015.&lt;ref name="council2015"&gt;{{cite web |title= FTTH Council – Definition of Terms |date= February 2016 |url= http://www.ftthcouncil.eu/documents/Publications/FTTH_Definition_of_Terms-Revision_2015-Final.pdf |publisher= FTTH Council |accessdate= June 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FTTH Councils do not have formal definitions for FTTC and FTTN.

==Benefits==
While fiber optic cables can carry data at high speeds over long distances, copper cables used in traditional telephone lines and [[ADSL]] cannot. For example, the common form of [[Gigabit Ethernet]] (1Gbit/s) runs over relatively economical [[category 5 cable|category 5e]], [[category 6 cable|category 6]] or [[category 6a cable|augmented category 6]] unshielded twisted-pair copper cabling but only to {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}. However, 1 Gbit/s Ethernet over fiber can easily reach tens of kilometers. Therefore, FTTP has been selected by every major communications provider in the world to carry data over long 1 Gbit/s symmetrical connections directly to consumer homes. FTTP configurations that bring fiber directly into the building can offer the highest speeds since the remaining segments can use standard Ethernet or coaxial cable.

Fiber is often said to be "future-proof" because the data rate of the connection is usually limited by the terminal equipment rather than the fiber, permitting substantial speed improvements by equipment upgrades before the fiber itself must be upgraded. Still, the type and length of employed fibers chosen, e.g. multimode vs. single-mode, are critical for applicability for future connections of over 1 Gbit/s. 

With the rising popularity of [[High-definition video|high-definition]], on-demand [[Streaming media|video streaming]] applications and devices such as [[YouTube]], [[Netflix]], [[Roku]], and [[List of Facebook features|Facebook LIVE]], the demand for reliable bandwidth is crucial as more and more people begin to utilize these services.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ofsoptics.com/fttx-cable-solution.html|title=FTTx|last=|first=|date=|website=OFS Optics|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FTTC (where fiber transitions to copper in a street cabinet) is generally too far from the users for standard ethernet configurations over existing copper cabling. They generally use [[very-high-bit-rate digital subscriber line]] (VDSL) at [[downstream (networking)|downstream]] rates of 80 Mbit/s, but this falls extremely quickly over a distance of 100 meters.

==Fiber to the premises==
Fiber to the premises (FTTP) is a form of [[fiber-optic communication]] delivery, in which an optical fiber is run in an [[optical distribution network]] from the central office all the way to the [[premises]] occupied by the subscriber. The term "FTTP" has become ambiguous and may also refer to FTTC where the fiber terminates at a [[utility pole]] without reaching the premises.

[[File:Fiber-Optic Installation in New York City.jpg|thumb|Fiber-optic cable being pulled underneath NYC's Streets]]
Fiber to the premises can be categorized according to where the optical fiber ends:

*FTTH (fiber-to-the-home) is a form of fiber-optic communication delivery that reaches one living or working space. The fiber extends from the central office to the subscriber's living or working space.&lt;ref name="council2011" /&gt; Once at the subscriber's living or working space, the signal may be conveyed throughout the space using any means, including [[twisted pair]], [[coaxial cable]], [[wireless]], [[power line communication]], or optical fiber.
*FTTB (fiber-to-the-building or -basement) is a form of fiber-optic communication delivery that necessarily applies only to those properties that contain multiple living or working spaces. The optical fiber terminates before actually reaching the subscribers living or working space itself, but does extend to the property containing that living or working space. The signal is conveyed the final distance using any non-optical means, including [[twisted pair]], [[coaxial cable]], [[wireless]], or [[power line communication]].&lt;ref name="council2011" /&gt;
An [[apartment]] building may provide an example of the distinction between FTTH and FTTB. If a fiber is run to a panel inside each subscriber's apartment unit, it is FTTH. If instead, the fiber goes only as far as the apartment building's shared [[electrical room]] (either only to the [[storey|ground floor]] or to each floor), it is FTTB.

==Fiber to the curb/cabinet/node==
[[File:Inside fibre cab (12945979503).jpg|thumb|right|The inside of a fiber cabinet. The left side contains the fiber, and the right side contains the copper.]]
Fiber to the curb/cabinet (FTTC) is a telecommunications system based on fiber-optic cables run to a platform that serves several customers. Each of these customers has a connection to this platform via [[coaxial cable]] or [[twisted pair]]. The "curb" is an abstraction and can just as easily mean a pole-mounted device or communications closet or shed. Typically any system terminating fiber within {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} of the customer premises equipment would be described as FTTC.

Fiber to the node or neighborhood (FTTN), sometimes identified with and sometimes distinguished from fiber to the cabinet (FTTC),&lt;ref&gt;da Silva, Henrique (March 2005), [http://www.co.it.pt/seminarios/webcasting/itcbr_09_03_05.pdf "Optical Access Networks"], Instituto de Telecomunicações, 9 March 2005, slide 10. Retrieved on 2007-03-25.&lt;/ref&gt; is a telecommunication architecture based on fiber-optic cables run to a cabinet serving a neighborhood. Customers typically connect to this cabinet using traditional [[coaxial cable]] or [[twisted pair]] wiring. The area served by the cabinet is usually less than one mile in radius and can contain several hundred customers. (If the cabinet serves an area of less than {{convert|1000|ft|m|abbr=on}} in radius, the architecture is typically called FTTC/FTTK.)&lt;ref&gt;McCullough, Don (August 2005), [http://www.lightwaveonline.com/about-us/lightwave-issue-archives/issue/flexibility-is-key-to-successful-fiber-to-the-premises-deployments-53914857.html "Flexibility is key to successful fiber to the premises deployments"], ''Lightwave'' '''22''' (8). Retrieved on 2010-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

FTTN allows delivery of broadband services such as high-speed internet. High-speed [[communications protocol]]s such as broadband cable access (typically [[DOCSIS]]) or some form of [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) are used between the cabinet and the customers. Data rates vary according to the exact protocol used and according to how close the customer is to the cabinet.

Unlike FTTP, FTTN often uses existing coaxial or twisted-pair infrastructure to provide [[last mile]] service and is thus less costly to deploy. In the long term, however, its bandwidth potential is limited relative to implementations that bring the fiber still closer to the subscriber.

A variant of this technique for [[cable television]] providers is used in a [[hybrid fiber-coaxial]] (HFC) system. It is sometimes given the acronym [[FTTLA]] (fiber-to-the-last-amplifier) when it replaces analog amplifiers up to the last one before the customer (or neighborhood of customers).

FTTC allows delivery of broadband services such as high-speed internet. Usually, existing wire is used with [[communications protocol]]s such as broadband cable access (typically [[DOCSIS]]) or some form of [[digital subscriber line|DSL]] connecting the curb/cabinet and the customers. In these protocols, the data rates vary according to the exact protocol used and according to how close the customer is to the cabinet.

Where it is feasible to run new cable, both fiber and copper [[ethernet]] are capable of connecting the "curb" with a full 100Mbit/s or 1Gbit/s connection. Even using relatively cheap outdoor category 5 copper over thousands of feet, all [[ethernet]] protocols including [[power over Ethernet]] (PoE) are supported{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}. Most fixed wireless technologies rely on PoE, including [[Motorola Canopy]], which has low-power radios capable of running on a 12VDC power supply fed over several hundred feet of cable.

[[Power line communication|Power line networking]] deployments also rely on FTTC. Using the [[IEEE P1901]] protocol (or its predecessor [[HomePlug AV]]) existing electric service cables move up to 1Gbit/s from the curb/pole/cabinet into every AC electrical outlet in the home—coverage equivalent to a robust [[Wi-Fi]] implementation, with the added advantage of a single cable for power and data.

By avoiding new cable and its cost and liabilities, FTTC costs less to deploy. However, it also has historically had lower bandwidth potential than FTTP. In practice, the relative advantage of fiber depends on the bandwidth available for [[backhaul (telecommunications)|backhaul]], [[usage-based billing]] restrictions that prevent full use of last-mile capabilities, and customer premises equipment and maintenance restrictions, and the cost of running fiber that can vary widely with geography and building type.

In the United States and Canada, the largest deployment of FTTC was carried out by [[BellSouth Telecommunications]]. With the acquisition of BellSouth by [[AT&amp;T]], deployment of FTTC will end. Future deployments will be based on either FTTN or FTTP. Existing FTTC plant may be removed and replaced with FTTP.&lt;ref&gt;Ed Gubbins, [http://telephonyonline.com/home/news/att_fttc_fttp_122107/ "Analyst: AT&amp;T may replace some FTTC with FTTP"], ''Connected Planet'', Penton Media, Inc., 21 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Verizon]], meanwhile, announced in March 2010 they were winding down [[Verizon FiOS]] expansion, concentrating on completing their network in areas that already had FiOS franchises but were not deploying to new areas, suggesting that FTTH was uneconomic beyond these areas.

Verizon also announced (at CES 2010) its entry into the [[smart home]] and [[Electric utility|power utility]] data management arenas, indicating it was considering using P1901-based FTTC or some other existing-wire approach to reach into homes, and access additional revenues from the secure [[AES-128]] bandwidth required for [[advanced metering infrastructure]]. However, the largest 1Gbit/s deployment in the United States, in [[Chattanooga]], [[Tennessee]], despite being conducted by power utility [[EPB]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://epb.net EPB], website of a non-profit agency of the City of Chattanooga, established in 1935 to provide electric power to the greater Chattanooga area. Retrieved 12 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; was FTTH rather than FTTC, reaching every subscriber in a 600-square-mile area. Monthly pricing of $350 reflected this generally high cost of deployment.  However, Chattanooga EPB has reduced the monthly pricing to $70/month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://epbfi.com EPBFI], a website for EPB Fiber Optics. Retrieved 3 June 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, both telephone and cable companies avoided hybrid networks using several different modes of transport from their point of presence into customer premises. The increased competitive cost pressure, availability of three different existing wire solutions, [[smart grid]] deployment requirements (as in Chattanooga), and better hybrid networking tools (with major vendors like [[Alcatel-Lucent]] and [[Qualcomm Atheros]], and [[Wi-Fi]] solutions for [[edge network]]s, [[IEEE 1905]] and [[IEEE 802.21]] protocol efforts and [[SNMP]] improvements) all make FTTC deployments more likely in areas uneconomic to serve with FTTP/FTTH. In effect FTTC serves as a halfway measure between fixed wireless and FTTH, with special advantages for [[smart appliance]]s and [[electric vehicles]] that rely on [[Power-line communication|PLC]] use already.

==Deployments==
[[Multiple system operator|Operators]] around the world have been rolling out high-speed [[Internet]] access networks since the mid-2000s. Some used a network topology known as [[Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet|Active Ethernet Point-to-Point]] to deliver services from its central office directly into subscribers' homes. Fiber termination was handled by a [[residential gateway]] provided by [[Advanced Digital Broadcast]] inside a subscriber's home to be shared with other [[consumer electronics]] (CE) devices.

Copper telephone networks built in the [[20th century]] are being replaced by FTTP in most countries.

==Optical distribution networks==

===Direct fiber===
The simplest optical distribution network architecture is direct fiber: each fiber leaving the central office goes to exactly one customer. Such networks can provide excellent bandwidth but are more costly due to the fiber and central office machinery.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Elixmann, et al., [http://ppp.worldbank.org/public-private-partnership/sites/ppp.worldbank.org/files/documents/The_Economics_of_Next_Generation_Access_Final_Report.pdf "The Economics of Next Generation Access-Final Report: Study for the European Competitive Telecommunication Association (ECTA)"], WIK-Consult GmbH, 10 September 2008. Retrieved 12 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa and specifically in the city of Cape Town have one of the largest Direct fiber networks in the world. Cape Town has been on the forefront of telecommunication and connectivity for many years, with a large amount of fiber in the ground and many competitive offerings. Their argument for direct fiber is that multiple operators can patch into the network easily, and troubleshooting made simple.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcn.co.za/ "Fibre in Cape Town"] &lt;/ref&gt;

Direct fiber is generally favored by new entrants and competitive operators. A benefit is that no layer 2 networking technologies are excluded, whether [[passive optical network]] (PON), active optical network (AON), or other. Any form of regulatory remedy is possible using this topology.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf van der Berg, [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/49/8/40390735.pdf "Developments in Fiber Technologies and Investment"], Working Party on Communication Infrastructures and Services Policy (CISP), Committee for Information, Computer and Communication Policy (ICCP), Directorate for Science, Technology and Industry (DSTI), [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), 3 April 2008. Retrieved 12 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shared fiber===
More commonly, each fiber leaving the central office is actually shared by many customers. It is not until such a fiber gets relatively close to the customers that it is split into individual customer-specific fibers. AONs and PONs both achieve this split.

===Active optical network===
[[Image:PON vs AON.png|thumb|350px|right|Comparison showing how a typical AON (a [[star network]] capable of [[multicast]]ing) handles downstream traffic differently from a typical PON (a star network having multiple splitters housed in the same cabinet).]]
AONs rely on electrically powered network equipment to distribute the signal, such as a [[network switch|switch]] or [[router (computing)|router]]. Normally, signals need an optical-electrical-optical transformation in the AON. Each signal leaving the central office is directed only to the customer for whom it is intended.

Incoming signals from the customers avoid [[collision (telecommunications)|colliding]] at the intersection because the powered equipment there provides [[buffer (telecommunication)|buffering]]. Active Ethernet (a type of [[ethernet in the first mile]]) is a common AON, which uses optical ethernet switches to distribute the signal, incorporating the customers' premises and the central office into a large switched [[ethernet]] network.

Such networks are identical to ethernet computer networks used in businesses and academic institutions, except that their purpose is to connect homes and buildings to a central office rather than to connect computers and printers within a location. Each switching cabinet can handle up to 1,000 customers, although 400–500 is more typical.

This neighborhood equipment performs [[layer 2 switch]]ing or [[LAN switching#Layer 3 switching|layer 3 switching]] and routing, offloading full layer 3 [[routing]] to the carrier's central office. The [[IEEE 802.3ah]] standard enables service providers to deliver up to 100Mbit/s, [[duplex (telecommunications)|full-duplex]], over one [[single-mode optical fiber]] FTTP, depending on the provider. Speeds of 1Gbit/s are becoming commercially available.

===Passive optical network===
{{Main|Passive optical network}}
A passive optical network (PON) is a point-to-multipoint FTTP network architecture in which unpowered optical splitters are used to enable a single optical fiber to serve up to 128 customers. A PON reduces the fiber and central office equipment required compared with point-to-point architecture.

The downstream signal coming from the central office is broadcast to each customer premises sharing a fiber. [[Encryption]] is used to prevent eavesdropping. Upstream signals are combined using a multiple-access protocol, usually [[time division multiple access]] (TDMA).

===Ethernet point-to-point===
[[Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet]] (PPPoE) is a common way of delivering triple- and quad-play (voice, video, data, and mobile) services over both fiber and [[hybrid fiber-coaxial]] (HFC) networks. Active PPPoE uses dedicated fiber from an operator's [[telephone exchange|central office]] all the way to the subscribers' homes, while hybrid networks (often FTTN) use it to transport data via fiber to an intermediate point to ensure sufficiently high throughput speeds over [[last mile]] copper connections.

This approach has become increasingly popular in recent years with telecoms service providers in both North America ([[AT&amp;T]], [[Telus]], for example) and Europe's [[Fastweb (telecommunications company)|Fastweb]], [[Telecom Italia]], [[Telekom Austria]] and [[Deutsche Telekom]], for example. [[Google]] has also looked into this approach, amongst others, as a way to deliver multiple services over open-access networks in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Hardy, [http://www.lightwaveonline.com/fttx/featured-articles/Is-Active-Ethernet-best-FTTH-option-for-Google-85219312.html "Is Active Ethernet best FTTH option for Google?"], ''Lightwave'', PennWell Corporation, 24 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical network===
Once on private property, the signal is typically converted into an electrical format.

The optical network terminal (ONT, an [[ITU-T]] term) or unit (ONU, an identical [[IEEE]] term) converts the optical signal into an electrical signal using [[thin film]] filter technology. These units require electrical power for their operation, so some providers connect them to backup batteries in case of power outages to ensure emergency access to telecommunications. The [[optical line termination]]s "range" the optical network terminals or units in order to provide [[Time division multiple access|TDMA]] time slot assignments for upstream communication.

For FTTH and for some forms of FTTB, it is common for the building's existing ethernet, phone, and cable TV systems to connect directly to the optical network terminal or unit. If all three systems cannot directly reach the unit, it is possible to combine signals and transport them over a common medium such as Ethernet. Once closer to the end user, equipment such as a [[router (computing)|router]] or [[network interface controller]] can separate the signals and convert them into the appropriate protocol.

For FTTC and FTTN, the combined internet, video and telephone signal travels to the building over existing telephone or cable wiring until it reaches the end-user's living space, where a VDSL or DOCSIS modem converts data and video signals into ethernet protocol, which is sent over the end-user's [[category 5 cable]].

On a [[sailing]] vessel, a '''forestay''', sometimes just called a stay, is a piece of [[standing rigging]] which keeps a [[mast (sailing)|mast]] from falling backwards.  It is attached either at the very top of the mast, or in [[fractional rig]]s between about 1/8 and 1/4 from the top of the mast.

In 1918, aged 11, Cassidy moved with his family to [[Akron, Ohio]] where he graduated from high school.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/06/15/arts/frederic-cassidy-92-expert-on-american-folk-language-dies.html|title=Frederic Cassidy, 92, Expert on American Folk Language, Dies|last=Cushman Jr|first=John H.|date=15 June 2000|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-05-04|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; He enrolled in Ohio University later transferring to [[Oberlin College]], where he graduated in 1930 and obtained a [[master's degree]] in 1932.  By 1938, Cassidy had earned his [[doctoral degree]] at the [[University of Michigan]], and had married Hélène Lucille Monod, a fellow student.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Career==
In 1939, Cassidy accepted a lectureship at the University of Wisconsin, and was made full [[professor]] in 1950.  His first book, published in 1947, was entitled ''The Place Names of Dane County, Wisconsin.''  Cassidy then joined with Albert H. Marckwardt to produce the second edition of the ''Scribner Handbook of English,'' which was published in 1954.

Cassidy started as Chief Editor of the ''Dictionary of American Regional English'' in 1962, and saw Volume I (covering A-C) published by Harvard University Press in 1985.  Volume II, in which Joan Houston Hall joined him, covered letters D-H and followed in 1991. They continued their collaboration with Volume III (I-O), published in 1996.  Since Cassidy's death, Joan Houston Hall has carried on Cassidy's work as Chief Editor of what has come to be known as the ''DARE'' project.  Volume IV, covering P-Sk, came out in 2002, and Volume V, covering Sl-Z,was published in 2012.  Volume VI, subtitled "Contrastive Maps, Index to Entry Labels, Questionnaire, and Fieldwork Data," was released in 2013. Joining Hall for that volume was Luanne von Schneidemesser who served as Senior Editor. Late that same year, the digital version was launched.

===Jamaican and other creole languages===

In 1951 a [[Fulbright Research Fellowship]] gave Cassidy the opportunity to travel to back his native Jamaica to research a [[Jamaican English]] and [[Jamaican creole]] dictionary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=Spring–Summer 2000|title=Frederic G.

In 1967 he edited the ''Dictionary of Jamaican English,'' co-edited with [[Robert B. LePage]], which drew from four centuries of written and oral usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3yjYCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA615&amp;dq=lexicography%20%22dictionary%20of%20jamaican%20englisH%22&amp;pg=PA615#v=onepage&amp;q=cassidy&amp;f=false|title=The Oxford Handbook of Lexicography|last=Durkin|first=Philip|date=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=9780199691630|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Orthography for creole languages ====
Cassidy advocated for creole languages to use an [[orthography]], or writing style, that did not rely on European spelling conventions.

{{quote|The more the creole differs phonemically from the lexicalizing language (English, French, Dutch - whatever), the more it must differ in its orthography. It should be taught and learned in a system of its own ... Paramount should be a phonemically accurate, consistent, autonomous system|Cassidy (1993)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JHgsfADZF9IC&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=cassidy%20orthography%201993&amp;pg=PA119#v=onepage&amp;q=cassidy%20orthography%201993&amp;f=false|title=Spelling and Society: The Culture and Politics of Orthography around the World|last=Sebba|first=Mark|date=|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=9781139462020|location=|pages=119|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cassidy pioneered an orthography, initially proposed in 1961 and known as the Cassidy System, developed specifically for Jamaican that uses a [[Phonemic orthography|phonemic]] system that closely reproduces the sound of the language. The Cassidy System was later adopted and modified by the [[Jamaican Language Unit]] (JLU) at [[University of the West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YmQHUuNojqEC&amp;lpg=PT21&amp;dq=cassidy%20orthography%20jamaican&amp;pg=PT21#v=onepage&amp;q=cassidy%20orthography%20jamaican&amp;f=false|title=The Syntax of Jamaican Creole: A Cartographic Perspective|last=Durrleman|first=Stephanie|date=|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|year=2008|isbn=9027255105|location=|pages=10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the [[Bible society|Bible Society]], in collaboration with JLU, translated the [[New Testament]] into Jamaican using the Cassidy orthography, it was published as ''Di Jamiekan Nyuu Testiment.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jamaicaobserver.com/news/Some-churches--schools-now-using-Patois-Bible_10623764|title=Some churches, schools now using Patois Bible|last=Tomlinson|first=Rhoma|date=5 February 2012|website=Jamaica Observer|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
He was awarded three medals from the Institute of Jamaica; the Centenary Medal in 1979, the Silver [[Musgrave Medal]] in 1962 and the Gold Musgrave Medal in 1983.

He has hononary doctorates from the [[Memorial University of Newfoundland]] and the University of West Indies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instituteofjamaica.org.jm/musgrave-awards |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141018165642/http://instituteofjamaica.org.jm/musgrave-awards |dead-url=yes |archive-date=18 October 2014 |title=Musgrave Awardees |publisher=Institute of Jamaica |accessdate=6 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JJVol16"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Interview with Frederic Cassidy with Verma Pollard|journal=Jamaica Journal|date=1983|volume=16|issue=2|pages=10–19|url=http://dloc.com/UF00090030/00039/pageturner?search=jamaica+%3djournal#page/13|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Roberto_Briffa.jpg|thumb|300px|Hiking technique demonstrated on a [[Laser Radial]].]]

In [[sailing]], '''hiking''' ('''stacking''' or '''stacking out''' in New Zealand; '''leaning out''' or '''sitting out''' in United Kingdom) is the action of moving the crew's body weight as far to windward (upwind) as possible, in order to decrease the extent the boat heels (leans away from the wind). By moving the crew's weight to windward, the [[Moment (physics)|moment]] of that force around the boat's center of buoyancy is increased. This opposes the [[Heeling (sailing)|heeling]] moment of the wind pushing sideways against the boat's [[sail]]s. It is usually done by leaning over the edge of the boat as it heels. Some boats are fitted with equipment such as '''hiking straps''' (or toe straps) and '''[[Trapeze (sailing)|trapezes]]''' to make hiking more effective.

Hiking is most integral to [[catamaran]] and [[dinghy sailing]], where the lightweight boat can be easily [[Capsizing|capsized]] or [[Turtling (sailing)|turtled]] by the wind unless the sailor counteracts the wind's pressure by hiking, or eases the sails to reduce it. The heavy keel on larger [[keelboat]]s means that it is rare to capsize them due to wind alone, but keelboat racers will still hike to prevent unnecessary heeling, or leaning sideways to leeward, because the more vertical in the water the keel is, the more effective it is at keeping the boat moving in a forward direction and preventing it from [[leeway|drifting to leeward]], slowing the boat due to drag, and potentially increasing the distance the boat must sail when [[Sailing#Beating or "working"|beating]]. Improper heel creates a tendency for the boat to turn off course, necessitating a correction with the rudder, which also increases drag. Sails use wind most efficiently when they are at a proper heel, another reason for controlling heel.

==Hiking equipment==
Many boats, especially dinghies, have equipment that facilitates effective hiking. ''Hiking straps'' (toe straps) made from [[rope]] or [[webbing]] hold the sailor's feet down, allowing them to lean back over the gunwale of the boat while sitting facing in. These simple devices are almost universal on dinghies that do not have more complex hiking systems. Some sailors wear special [[shorts]] fitted with pads or stiff battens to help them hike more effectively and without tiring.

Some dinghies and catamarans, such as the [[505 (dinghy)|505]], [[420 (dinghy)|420]], [[International Fourteen|International 14]], or [[Hobie 16]], have a ''[[Trapeze (sailing)|trapeze]]'' to allow the crew to increase their righting [[Moment (physics)|moment]] on the boat. These are wires attached high up on the mast, and fitted with a bracket that fits into a hook on a harness worn by the crew. This wire and harness then supports the crew as they stand and lean back over the water, pulling against the mast. On some boats, such as the [[Laser 2 (dinghy)|Laser 2]], the [[Skipper (boating)|skipper]] uses hiking straps, and the crew uses a trapeze. On high-performance [[skiff]]s, such as the International 14 or [[49er (dinghy)|49er]], both the skipper and the crew use trapezes.

''Hiking boards'' are long boards fitted perpendicular to the boat's hull, and sometimes stretching several feet over the water. These allow the crew to move their weight far out to windward. They are commonly designed to slide from side to side, so they are moved to the windward side whenever the boat [[tack (sailing)|tack]]s. They are most often used on [[Canoe sailing|sailing canoes]], but can be installed on many kinds of dinghy.  there are also two racing classes that use planks and they are the VJ, and the bigger [[Skate (dinghy)]].

Some racing [[keelboat]]s are fitted with elastic lifelines running down the sides of the boat. These allow the crew to lean into the lifeline to get further out on the windward rail. Many kinds of racing keelboat are raced with more crew aboard than is strictly necessary to operate the boat in order to increase the amount of weight on the upwind side of the boat, keeping the boat flatter.

A few high performance keelboats, such as the [[Moore 30]] and the [[Kiwi 35]], have structural hiking "wings" built into their hull, which allows a lower [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] [[Hull (watercraft)|hull]] and increased leverage for hiking.&lt;ref name="rousmaniere4"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sailmagazine.com/cruising-news/sailing-accidents-lessons-learned |title=Sailing Accidents: Lessons Learned |first1=John |last1=Rousmaniere |date=13 September 2012 |accessdate=November 27, 2013 |newspaper=[[Sail (magazine)|Sail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keilman"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2011-10-30/news/ct-met-mackinac-race-1030-20111030_1_capsized-wingnuts-boat |title=Report: Boat in deadly accident unfit for Mackinac race {{mdash}} Craft that capsized called too unstable for long competition in area prone to severe weather |date=30 October 2011 |first1=John |last1=Keilman |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inquiry"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://media.ussailing.org/AssetFactory.aspx?vid=16940 |title=Inquiry Into the Chicago yacht Club-Race to Mackinac Capsize and Fatalities |first1=Chuck |last1=Hawley |first2=John |last2=Rousmaniere |authorlink2=John Rousmaniere |first3=Ralph |last3=Naranjo |first4=Shiela |last4=McCurdy |date=18 October 2011 |accessdate=23 November 2011 |publisher=[[US Sailing]] |format=[[PDF]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111111085204/http://media.ussailing.org/AssetFactory.aspx?vid=16940 |archivedate=11 November 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Landry"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.soundingsonline.com/news/mishaps-a-rescues/287683-boat-in-fatal-capsize-was-inappropriate-for-race  |title=Boat in fatal capsize was 'inappropriate' for race |date=31 January 2012 |first1=Chris |last1=Landry |journal=Soundings |accessdate=7 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="practical"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.practical-sailor.com/issues/37_16/features/2011_wiingnuts_capsize_10758-1.html |date=April 2012|title=PS Analysis: The 2011 WingNuts Capsize Practical Sailor |journal=Practical Sailor |accessdate=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sharp"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sail-world.com/USA/index.cfm?SEID=0&amp;Nid=86255&amp;SRCID=0&amp;ntid=118&amp;tickeruid=0&amp;tickerCID=0 |title=Kiwi 35 'probably as stable upside down as she was upright' |first1=Eric |last1=Sharp |newspaper=[[Detroit Free Press]] |publisher=SailWorld.com |date=21 July 2011 |accessdate=6 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212112314/http://www.sail-world.com/USA/index.cfm?SEID=0&amp;Nid=86255&amp;SRCID=0&amp;ntid=118&amp;tickeruid=0&amp;tickerCID=0 |archivedate=12 December 2013 |df= }} including a picture of the turtled ''WingNuts''&lt;/ref&gt;  See [[Turtling (sailing)#Notable events|Turtling]].

'''Journal therapy''' is a [[writing therapy]] focusing on the writer's internal experiences, thoughts and feelings. This kind of therapy uses [[reflective writing]] enabling the writer to gain mental and emotional clarity, validate experiences and come to a deeper understanding of him/herself. Journal therapy can also be used to express difficult material or access previously inaccessible materials.

Like other forms of therapy, journal therapy can be used to heal a writer's emotional or physical problems or work through a trauma, such as an illness, addiction, or relationship problems, among others.&lt;ref name = Adams&gt;Adams, Kathleen. "Journal Therapy." The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Body-Mind Disciplines. New York City: 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Journal therapy can supplement an on-going therapy, or can take place in [[group therapy]] or self-directed therapy.
__TOC__

==Brief history==
[[Ira Progoff]] created journal writing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intensivejournal.org/about/article_interview.php|title=The Progoff Intensive Journal ® Program|website=www.intensivejournal.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1966 in New York. The [[intensive journal method]] is a structured way of writing about nature that allows the writer to achieve spiritual and personal growth. This method consists of a three-ring, loose-leaf binder with four color-coded sections: lifetime dimension, dialogue dimension, depth dimension and meaning dimension. These sections are divided into several subsections. Some of these subsections include topics like career, dreams, body and health, interests, events and meaning in life. Progoff created the intensive journal so that working in one part of the journal would in turn stimulate one to work on another part of the journal, leading to different viewpoints, awareness and connections between subjects. The intensive journal method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KAISER|first=ROBERT BLAIR|date=1981|title=The Way if the Journal|url=http://www.intensivejournal.org/articles/main.htm|journal=Psychology Today|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; began with recording the session in a daily log.&lt;ref name = Epple /&gt;

The field of journal therapy reached a wider audience in the 1970s with the publication of three books, namely, Progoff's ''At a Journal Workshop'' (1978), Christina Baldwin's ''One to One: Self-Understanding Through Journal Writing'' (1977) and Tristine Rainer's ''The New Diary'' (1978).&lt;ref name = Epple&gt;Epple, Dorothy. "Journal Writing for Life Development." Advances in Social Work. 8.2 (2007): 288–304.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, psychotherapist and journal therapy pioneer, Kathleen Adams, started providing journal workshops, designed as a [[self-discovery]] process.

In the 1990s, [[James W. Pennebaker]] published multiple studies which affirmed that writing about emotional problems or traumas led to both physical and mental health benefits. These studies drew more attention to the benefits of writing as a therapy.

In the 2000s, journal therapy [[workshops]] were conducted at the Progoff's Dialogue House, Adams' Center for Journal Therapy and certificates were given through educational institutions. Generally, journal therapists obtain an [[advanced degree]] in [[psychology]], [[counseling]], [[social work]], or another field and then enter a credentialing program or independent-study program.&lt;ref name = Adams /&gt;

==Effects==
Journal therapy is a form of [[expressive therapy]] used to help writers better understand life's issues and how they can cope with these issues or fix them. The benefits of expressive writing include long-term health benefits such as better self-reported physical and emotional health, improved immune system, liver and lung functioning, improved memory, reduced blood pressure, fewer days in hospital, fewer stress-related doctor visits, improved mood and greater psychological well-being. Other therapeutic effects of journal therapy include the expression of feelings, which can lead to greater self-awareness and acceptance and can in turn allow the writer to create a relationship with his or herself. The short-term effects of expressive writing include increased distress and psychological arousal.&lt;ref name = Baikie&gt;Baikie, Karen A., and Kay Wilhelm. "Emotional and physical health benefits of expressive writing." Advances in Psychiatric Treatment 11.5 (2005): 338–346.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Many [[Psychotherapy|psychotherapists]] incorporate journal "homework" in their therapy but few specialize in journal therapy. Journal therapy often begins with the client writing a paragraph or two at the beginning of a session. These paragraphs would reflect how the client is feeling or what is happening in his or her life and would set the direction of the session. Journal therapy then works to guide the client through different writing exercises. Subsequently, the therapist and the client then discuss the information revealed in the journal. In this method, the therapist often assigns journal "homework" that is to be completed by the next session. Journal therapy can also be provided to groups.&lt;ref name = Adams /&gt;

==Techniques==
Journal therapy consists of many techniques or writing exercises. In all journal therapy techniques, the writer is encouraged to date everything, write quickly, keep writings and always tell the complete truth. Some of the journal therapy techniques are as follows:&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, Kate. "Journal therapy writing as a therapeutic tool." Trans. Array Writing Cures: an introductory handbook of writing in counseling and therapy. Gillie Bolton, Stephanie Howlett, Colin Lago and Jeannie K. Wright. New York City: Brunner-Routledge, 2004. 72–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Sprint 
: Catharsis is encouraged by allowing a writer to write about anything for a designated period, such as for five minutes or for ten minutes.

; Lists 
: The writer writes any number of connected items in order to help prioritize and organize.

; Captured moments
: Writer attempts to completely describe the essence and emotional experience of a memory.

; Unsent letters
: This attempts to silence a writer's internal censor; it can be used in a grieving process or to get over traumas, such as sexual abuse.

; Dialogue
: The writer creates both sides to a conversation involving anything, including but not limited to, people, the body, events, situations, time etc.

; Feedback
: Important to journal therapy as feedback makes the writer be aware of his or her feelings; it also allows the writer to acknowledge, accept and reflect on what they he/she has written before (thoughts, feelings, etc.).

==Setting==
A quiet and private environment must be created and provided throughout the entire journal [[writing process]]. This environment should contain features or elements that can make the writer feel good such as music, candles, a hot drink etc. This environment works to empower the writer and for him/her to associate good feelings with journal writing. To transition into writing, a journal writing session can be started with a drawing or sketch. After journal writing, something active should be done, such as running, walking, stretching, breathing etc. or something that is enjoyable like taking a bubble bath, baking cookies, listening to music, talking to someone, etc.&lt;ref name = Adams1&gt;Adams, Kathleen. The Way of the Journal: A Journal Therapy Workbook for Healing. 2nd ed. Baltimore, Maryland: The Sidran Press, 1993. 6–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[DC Books]]. 9 March 2013. Retrieved 3 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The book, which won critical acclaim for its forceful but humorous presentation of the restrictions under which Muslim women are forced to live, was hailed a milestone in [[Malayalam literature]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/article1108099.ece?css=print "Writer felicitated"]. ''The Hindu''. 21 January 2011.

Khader]], this novel, after her acclaimed ''Barsa'', was sure to trigger off a diverse kind of reading and interpretations as it passionately dealt with a sphere closer to Dr. Mumthas by her own experience as a medical practitioner. "The unique style of narration that develops through the inner conflicts of characters is sure to compel the readers' attention throughout the work," he said.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2011/03/16/stories/2011031659700500.htm "Khadija Mumthas' works lauded"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110324175630/http://www.hindu.com/2011/03/16/stories/2011031659700500.htm |date=24 March 2011 }}.

'''N. Kumaran Ashan''' (12 April 1873 – 16 January 1924), also known as ''Mahakavi Kumaran Ashan'' (the prefix '''Mahakavi''', awarded by Madras University in 1922, means "great poet" and the suffix ''''Aashaan''' means "scholar" or "teacher"), was one of the [[Triumvirate poets of modern Malayalam|triumvirate poets]] of [[Kerala]], [[South India]].&lt;ref name="kanic"&gt;http://kanic.kerala.gov.in&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a philosopher, a social reformer and a disciple of Sree [[Narayana Guru]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Sisir Kumar |editor-last=Das |title=A History of Indian Literature 1911-1956: Struggle for Freedom: Triumph and Tragedy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sqBjpV9OzcsC&amp;pg=PA440 |year=2006 |edition=Reprinted |publisher=Sahitya Akademi |isbn=978-81-7201-798-9 |pages=306–308 |chapter=The Narratives of Suffering: Caste and the Underprivileged}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Natarajan|first1=Nalini|title=Handbook of Twentieth-Century Literatures of India|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc.|isbn=0-313-28778-3|pages=183–185|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1lTnv6o-d_oC&amp;pg=PA184&amp;lpg=PA184|accessdate=8 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kumaran Ashan initiated a revolution in [[Malayalam]] poetry in the first quarter of the 20th century, transforming it from the metaphysical to the lyrical. Deep moral and spiritual commitment is evident in Ashan's poetry. His works are an eloquent testimony of poetic concentration and dramatic contextualisation.

==Early life==
Asan was born in a merchant family belonging to the [[Ezhava]] community&lt;ref name="Kumaran Ashan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tharamangalam|first=Joseph|title=Agrarian Class Conflict: The Political Mobilization of Agricultural Labourers in Kuttanad, South India|year=1981|publisher=The University of British Columbia|isbn=0-7748-0126-3|pages=38|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=538cKfVv8ygC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Agrarian+Class+Conflict:+The+Political+Mobilization+of+Agricultural+Labourers+in+Kuttanad,+South+India&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=n13XUN60AseY1AWx7YCoBg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt; in April 1873 in Kayikkara village, Chirayinkeezhu taluk, Anchuthengu Grama Panchaayath [[Thiruvananthapuram]] district of [[Kerala]], [[south India]]. Named ''Kumaran'', he was the second son in a family of nine children. His father, ''Narayanan Perungudi'', was well versed in [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. His mother was Kaali. Asan inherited his taste for [[Kathakali]] and [[Indian classical music|classical music]]. Kumaru trained in mathematics and [[Sanskrit]] for which he had a passion. Even though through his father's efforts, he got a job as a primary school teacher and an accountant to a wholesaler at the age of 14, he quit the job two years later to pursue higher studies in Sanskrit. He undertook a studentship in poetry under Manamboor Govindan Asan. He wished to learn [[Yoga]] and [[Tantra]] and worked as an apprentice in a [[Muruga]] temple at Vakkom. He composed a few devotional songs for the benefit of regular worshippers at this temple.

In 1917 Asan married Bhanumathiamma, the daughter of Thachakudy Kumaran – younger brother of [[Padmanabhan Palpu]]'s father. . Bhanumathiamma, who was an active social worker, later remarried after Asan's death and died in 1975.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Kumaran became a disciple of Narayana Guru.

==Early works==
Some of the earlier works of the poet were ''Subramanya Sathakam'' and ''Sankara Sathakam'', wherein Asan voiced his devotional aspirations. His short poem ''[[Veena Poovu (poem)|Veena Poovu]]'' (fallen flower) is a literary classic. It paved the way for a new movement in Malayalam literature. His [[elegy]] ''Prarodanam'' mourns the death of his contemporary and friend [[A. R. Raja Raja Varma]], the famous grammarian. His ''Khanda Kavyas'' (poems) like ''Nalini'', ''Leela'', ''Karuna'' and ''Chandaalabhikshuki'' won critical acclaim as well as popularity.  In ''Chintaavishtayaaya Seetha'' (The Contemplative Sita) he displays his poetic artistry, while in ''Duravastha'', he patiently and skilfully tears down the barriers created by [[feudalism]], orthodoxy and casteism and consummates the dictum of the Guru, "One Caste, One Religion, One God for man".

He wrote the [[epic poem]] ''Buddha Charitha'' for which he got inspiration from [[Edwin Arnold]]'s ''Light of Asia''.  While in ''Duravastha'', he revealed his revolutionary zeal for fighting [[caste]] distinctions; a few other poetic works had a distinct Hindu/Buddhist slant.

He died aged 51 as a result of a boat accident in January 1924 while travelling to [[Kollam]] from a function in [[Alappuzha]]. The boat capsized at Pallana and all on board drowned, except his friend Ouseph Kurian Mappila Thannikuzhiyil Kanjirathanam  . Kumaranasan was the only poet in Malayalam who became ''mahakavi'' without writing a ''mahakavyam''.

The Kumaran Asan National Institute of Culture at [[Thonnakkal]] was founded in 1958 in his memory, and includes a small house which he had built on his land.&lt;ref name="kanic" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3957&amp;Itemid=3142 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407065701/http://www.kerala.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3957&amp;Itemid=3142 |archivedate=7 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Saundaryalahari (poem)''' (1901)
*''[[Veena Poovu (poem)|Veena Poovu]]'' (1907)

:Asan scripted this epoch-making poem in 1907 during his sojourn in [[Jain Medu]], [[Palakkad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2007/12/21/stories/2007122150380300.htm |title=The Hindu : Friday Review Thiruvananthapuram / Dance : Visual poetry |last1=Paul |first1=G.S. |date=21 December 2007 |accessdate=20 July 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522045820/http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/fr/2007/12/21/stories/2007122150380300.htm |archivedate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A highly philosophical poem, 'Veena Poovu' is an allegory of the transience of the mortal world, which is depicted through the description of the varied stages in the life of a flower. asan describes in such detail about its probable past and the position it held. It is an intense sarcasm on people on high powers/positions finally losing all those. The first word Ha, and the last word Kashtam of the entire poem is often considered as a symbolism of him calling the world outside "Ha! kashtam".

The '''Mikasuki language''' (also '''Miccosukee''',  '''Mikisúkî''' or '''Hitchiti-Mikasuki''') is a [[Muskogean languages|Muskogean language]] spoken by around 500 people in southern [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Muscogee language|Creek]], it is also known as Seminole. It is spoken by the [[Miccosukee]] tribe and many Florida [[Seminole]]. The extinct [[Hitchiti#Language|Hitchiti]] was a mutually-intelligible dialect.

The Seminole and Miccosukee were made up of mostly Creek members of the [[Creek Confederacy]], who had migrated to Florida under pressure from European-American encroachment. The Seminole formed by a process of [[ethnogenesis]] in the 18th century. American settlers began to enter Florida and came into conflict with the Seminole. The [[American Indian Wars|Seminole Wars of the 19th century]] greatly depleted the numbers of these tribes, specifically the [[Second Seminole War]]. The United States forcibly removed many Seminole to [[Indian Territory]] (now Oklahoma). The Seminole and Miccosukee had gradually moved into the center of Florida and the Everglades, from where they resisted defeat even in the Third Seminole War. The US gave up efforts against them.

In the 20th century, the Seminole and Miccosukee split apart, with the former moving onto reservations. The Miccosukee lived in communities that were affected by the early 20th-century construction of the [[Tamiami Trail]], which brought tourists into the Everglades.

The Miccosukee achieved federal recognition as a tribe in 1962. Both tribes have speakers of Mikasuki today.

As of 2002, the language was taught in the local school, which had "an area devoted to 'Miccosukee Language Arts'".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''mirror stage''' ({{lang-fr|stade du miroir}}) is a concept in the [[psychoanalytic]] theory of [[Jacques Lacan]]. The mirror stage is based on the belief that infants recognize themselves in a [[mirror]] (literal) or other symbolic contraption which induces [[apperception]] (the turning of oneself into an object that can be viewed by the child from outside themselves) from the age of about six months.

Initially, Lacan proposed that the mirror stage was part of an infant's development from 6 to 18 months, as outlined at the Fourteenth International Psychoanalytical Congress at [[Marienbad]] in 1936. By the early 1950s, Lacan's concept of the mirror stage had evolved: he no longer considered the mirror stage as a moment in the life of the [[infant]], but as representing a permanent structure of [[subjectivity]], or as the [[paradigm]] of "[[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|Imaginary order]]". This evolution in Lacan's thinking becomes clear in his later essay titled "The Subversion of the Subject and the Dialectic of Desire".

==History of development==
Lacan's concept of the mirror stage was strongly inspired by earlier work by psychologist [[Henri Wallon (psychologist)|Henri Wallon]], who speculated based on observations of animals and humans responding to their reflections in mirrors.&lt;ref name ="Webster"&gt;Webster, Richard. (2002) "[http://www.richardwebster.net/thecultoflacan.html The cult of Lacan: Freud, Lacan and the mirror stage.]"&lt;/ref&gt; Wallon noted that by the age of about six months, human infants and chimpanzees both ''seem'' to recognize their reflection in a mirror. While chimpanzees rapidly lose interest in the discovery, human infants typically become very interested and devote much time and effort to exploring the connections between their bodies and their images.&lt;ref name="Evans, 2005"&gt;[[Dylan Evans|Evans, Dylan]] (2005). "[http://beta.finance-on.net/upload/ver/ver4480020c6d2b2/lacan.pdf From Lacan to Darwin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502205406/http://beta.finance-on.net/upload/ver/ver4480020c6d2b2/lacan.pdf |date=2014-05-02 }}," in ''The Literary Animal: Evolution and the Nature of Narrative'', eds. Jonathan Gottschall and David Sloan Wilson,  Evanston: Northwestern University Press, pp38-55.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1931 paper, Wallon argued that mirrors helped children develop a sense of self-identity. However, later [[mirror test]] research indicates that while toddlers are usually fascinated by mirrors, they do not actually recognize themselves in mirrors until the age of 15 months at the earliest,&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael, Jeanne Brooks-Gunn, and John Jaskir. "Individual Differences in Visual Self-recognition as a Function of Mother-infant Attachment Relationship." Developmental Psychobiology 21.6 (1985) 1181-87&lt;/ref&gt; leading psychoanalytically trained critic Norman N. Holland to declare that "there is no evidence whatsoever for Lacan's notion of a mirror stage".&lt;ref&gt;Holland, Norman N. (1998) [http://www.clas.ufl.edu/users/nholland/lacan.htm The Trouble(s) With Lacan]".&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, physician [[Raymond Tallis]]&lt;ref&gt;Tallis, Raymond.
 (1988) ''Not Saussure: A Critique of Post-Saussurean Literary Theory'', Macmillan, 1988, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; notes that a literal interpretation of the Lacanian mirror stage contradicts empirical observations about human identity and personality: "If epistemological maturation and the formation of a world picture were dependent upon catching sight of oneself in a mirror, then the [mirror stage] theory would predict that congenitally blind individuals would lack selfhood and be unable to enter language, society or the world at large. There is no evidence whatsoever that this implausible consequence of the theory is borne out in practice."

Wallon's ideas about mirrors in infant development were distinctly non-[[Freudian]] and little-known until revived in modified form a few years later by Lacan. As Evans&lt;ref name="Evans, 2005"/&gt; writes, "Lacan used this observation as a springboard to develop an account of the development of human subjectivity that was inherently, though often implicitly, comparative in nature." Lacan attempted to link Wallon's ideas to Freudian psychoanalysis, but was met with indifference from the larger community of Freudian psychoanalysts. Richard Webster&lt;ref name ="Webster"/&gt; explains how the "complex, and at times impenetrable paper ... appears to have made little or no lasting impression on the psychoanalysts who first heard it. It was not mentioned in [[Ernest Jones]]'s brief account of the congress and received no public discussion."

In the 1930s, Lacan attended seminars by [[Alexandre Kojève]], whose philosophy was heavily influenced by [[Hegel]]. The diachronic structure of the mirror stage theory is influenced by Kojève's interpretation of the [[Master-slave dialectic]]. Lacan continued to refine and modify the mirror stage concept through the remainder of his career; see below.

[[Dylan Evans]]&lt;ref name="Evans, 2005"/&gt; argues that Lacan's earliest versions of the mirror stage, while flawed, can be regarded as a bold pioneering in the field of [[ethology]] (the study of animal behavior) and a precursor of both [[cognitive psychology]] and [[evolutionary psychology]]. In the 1930s, zoologists were increasingly interested in the then-new field of ethology, but not until the 1960s would the larger scientific community believe that animal behavior offered any insights into human behavior.

However, Evans also notes that by the 1950s Lacan's mirror stage concept had become abstracted to the point that it no longer required a literal mirror, but could simply be the child's observation of observed behavior in the imitative gestures of another child or elder.&lt;ref name="Evans Dictionary"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Dylan|title=An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis.|publisher=Routledge|location=London|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Self-Alienation==

The child’s initiation into what Jacques Lacan would call the "mirror stage" entails a "libidinal dynamism" caused by the young child's identification with his own image and creation of what Lacan terms the "Ideal-I" or "Ideal ego." This reflexivity inherent in fantasy is apparent in the mirror stage, since to recognize oneself as "I" is like recognizing oneself as other ("yes, that person over there is me"); this act is thus fundamentally self-alienating. Indeed, for this reason feelings towards the image are mixed, caught between hatred ("I hate that version of myself because it is so much better than me") and love ("I want to be like that image"). A type of repetition compulsion develops from this vacillation as the attempt to locate a fixed subject proves ever elusive. "The mirror stage is a drama…which manufactures for the subject, caught up in the lure of spatial identification, the succession of phantasies that extends from a fragmented body-image to a form of its totality.” This misrecognition (seeing an ideal-I where there is a fragmented, chaotic body) subsequently "characterizes the ego in all its structures."

==As phenomenon==
{{quote|The mirror stage is a phenomenon to which I assign a twofold value. In the first place, it has historical value as it marks a decisive turning-point in the mental development of the child. In the second place, it typifies an essential [[libido|libidinal]] relationship with the [[body image]]. (Lacan, ''Some reflections on the Ego'', 1953)}}

As Lacan further develops the mirror stage concept, the stress falls less on its historical value and ever more on its structural value. "Historical value" refers to the mental development of the [[child]] and "structural value" to the libidinal relationship with the body image.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Dylan. 1996. ''An Introductory Dictionary of Lacanian Psychoanalysis''. {{ISBN|0-415-13523-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Lacan's fourth Seminar, ''La relation d'objet'', he states that "the mirror stage is far from a mere phenomenon which occurs in the development of the child. It illustrates the conflictual nature of the dual relationship". The dual relationship (''relation duelle'') refers not only to the relation between the [[Id, ego and super-ego|Ego]] and the [[Human body|body]], which is always characterized by [[illusion]]s of similarity and reciprocity, but also to the relation between the Imaginary and [[the Real]]. The visual identity given from the mirror supplies imaginary "wholeness" to the experience of a fragmentary real. See Lacan's paper, "The Mirror Stage as formative of the function of the ''I'' as revealed in psychoanalytic experience", the first of his ''Écrits.''

The mirror stage describes the formation of the Ego via the process of identification, the Ego being the result of identifying with one's own specular image. At six months the [[baby]] still lacks [[motor coordination|coordination]] (see [[Louis Bolk]]); however, Lacan hypothesized that the baby can recognize itself in the mirror before attaining control over its bodily movements. The child sees its image as a whole, but this contrasts with the lack of coordination of the body and leads the child to perceive a fragmented body. This contrast, Lacan hypothesized, is first felt by the infant as a rivalry with its own image, because the wholeness of the image threatens it with fragmentation; thus the mirror stage gives rise to an aggressive tension between the subject and the image. To resolve this aggressive tension, the subject identifies with the image: this primary identification with the counterpart is what forms the Ego. (Evans, 1996) The moment of identification is to Lacan a moment of jubilation since it leads to an imaginary sense of mastery. (''Écrits'', "The Mirror Stage") Yet, the jubilation may also be accompanied by a depressive reaction, when the infant compares his own precarious sense of mastery with the [[omnipotence]] of the [[mother]]. (''La relation d'objet'') This identification also involves the ideal ego which functions as a promise of future wholeness sustaining the Ego in anticipation.

The mirror stage, Lacan also hypothesized, shows that the Ego is the product of misunderstanding – Lacan's term "méconnaissance" implies a false recognition. Additionally, the mirror stage is where the subject becomes [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienated]] from itself, and thus is introduced into the Imaginary order.

The Mirror Stage has also a significant [[symbol]]ic dimension. [[The Symbolic]] order is present in the figure of the adult who is carrying the infant: the moment after the subject has jubilantly assumed his image as his own, he turns his head toward this adult who represents the big [[Other (philosophy)|Other]], as if to call on him to ratify this image. (Tenth Seminar, "L'angoisse", 1962–1963)

The '''modifier letter [[apostrophe]]''' ('''ʼ''') is a [[glyph]].

In the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]], it is used to express [[ejective consonant]]s, such as [[Velar ejective|{{ipa|/{{thinsp}}kʼ{{thinsp}}/}}]], [[Alveolar ejective|{{ipa|/{{thinsp}}tʼ{{thinsp}}/}}]], etc.

It denotes a [[glottal stop]] (IPA {{ipa|/ʔ/}}) in orthographies of many languages, such as [[Tundra Nenets language|Nenets]].

It is encoded at {{unichar|02BC|MODIFIER LETTER APOSTROPHE|html=}}.

'''Muhammed Amin Zaki''' [[Bey]], (1880 [[Sulaymaniyah]] –1948 Sulaymaniyah), was a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] writer, [[historian]] and politician. He was born in [[Sulaimaniya]], son of Hagi Abdul Rahman. After studying in Sulaimaniya Military School and Baghdad Military High School, on 10 February 1902, he graduated from the [[Ottoman Military Academy]] (P. 1317-23) as the 23rd of the class and joined the [[Ottoman Army]] as Infantry [[Second Lieutenant]] (''Mülâzım-ı Sani'' ). He graduated from the [[Ottoman Military College]] (Staff College) at [[Istanbul]]&lt;ref&gt;G. F. Clayton, R. O. Collins, ''An Arabian Diary'', 379 pp., University of California Press, 1969, p.340&lt;/ref&gt; as distinguished officer (''Mümtaz subayı'' ) on 11 January 1905. And then he served as a staff officer (major) in the Ottoman Army.&lt;ref&gt;P. G. Kreyenbroek, S. Sperl, ''The Kurds: A Contemporary Overview'', 250 pp., Routledge Publishers, 1992, {{ISBN|0-415-07265-4}}, p.197&lt;/ref&gt; He left his last duty at the Military history department on 23 July 1923 for Baghdad, and started to give lecture at the Iraqi Military Academy. He also served in the [[Iraq]]i administration under the [[British Empire|British]] mandate in the 1920s&lt;ref&gt;N. Méouchy, P. Sluglett, ''The British and French Mandates in Comparative Perspectives'', 743 pp., BRILL Publishers, 2004, {{ISBN|90-04-13313-5}}, p.589&lt;/ref&gt; and was appointed as Defence Minister in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;P. Sluglett, ''Britain in Iraq: Contriving King and Country '', 318 pp., I.B. Tauris Publishers, 2007, {{ISBN|1-85043-769-6}}, p.117&lt;/ref&gt; His two-volume book on history of the Kurdish people and states is one of the acclaimed works on this subject and has been translated into several languages including [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;L. Meho,' The International Journal of Kurdish Studies: a cumulative index, 1986-2002''[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-132762855.html].&lt;/ref&gt; He died in Sulaimaniyah in July 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Mihemed Emîn Zekî Beg, ''Dîroka Kurd û Kurdistanê'', Avesta, İstanbul, 2002, {{ISBN|978-975-8637-20-1}}, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
His books were in Kurdish, Arabic and Turkish. His works primarily focused on Kurdish history, and include:
#''A Short History of the Kurds and Kurdistan'', in two volumes, Dar al-Islami Publishers, Baghdad, 1931. (in Kurdish: ''Tarîxî Kurd û Kurdistan'', Kurmancî: ''Dîroka Kurd û Kurdistanê'' ) Vol.I: From the Antiquity to the Present., Vol.II: History of the Kurdish States and Principalities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53665">The [[phonology]] of [[Navajo language|Navajo]] is intimately connected to its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. For example, the entire range of contrastive consonants is found only at the beginning of word stems. In stem-final position and in prefixes, the number of contrasts is drastically reduced. Similarly, vowel contrasts (including their prosodic combinatory possibilities) found outside of the stem are significantly neutralized.

Like most [[Athabascan languages]], Navajo is [[Coronal consonant|coronal]] heavy, having many phonological contrasts at coronal places of articulation and less at other places. Also typical of the family, Navajo has a limited number of labial sounds, both in terms of its phonemic inventory and in their occurrence in actual lexical items and displays of [[consonant harmony]].

==Consonants==

===Phonetics===
All consonants are long, compared to English: with plain stops the hold is longer, with aspirated stops the aspiration is longer, and with affricates the frication is longer. The [[voice onset time]] of the aspirated and ejective stops is twice as long as that found in most non-Athabaskan languages. {{Harvcoltxt|Young|Morgan|1987}} described Navajo consonants as "doubled" between vowels, but in fact they are equally long in all positions.{{sfnp|McDonough|Ladefoged|1993|p=?}}

;Stops and affricates
All stops and affricates, except for the bilabial and glottal, have a three-way laryngeal contrast between unaspirated, aspirated, and ejective. The labials {{IPA|/p, m/}} are found in only a few words. Most of the contrasts in the inventory lie within coronal territory at the alveolar and palatoalveolar places of articulation.

The aspirated stops {{IPA|/tʰ, kʰ/}} (orthographic {{angbr|{{spell-nv|t}}}}, {{angbr|{{spell-nv|k}}}}) are typically aspirated with velar frication {{IPA|[tx, kx]}} (they are phonetically [[affricate]]s — [[homorganic]] in the case of {{IPA|[kx]}}, heterorganic in the case of {{IPA|[tx]}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|McDonough|2003}} and {{Harvcoltxt|McDonough|Ladefoged|1993}} find these to be affricates and not clusters. The acoustic difference between an affricate and a stop + fricative consonant cluster is the rate of increase in the [[amplitude]] of the frication noise (i.e. the ''rise time''); affricates have a short rise time, consonant clusters have a longer rise time between the stop and fricative {{Harvcoltxt|Johnson|2003|pp=144–145}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The velar aspiration is also found on a labialized velar {{IPA|[kxʷ]}} (orthographic {{angbr|{{spell-nv|kw}}}}). There is variation within Navajo, however, in this respect: some dialects lack strong velar frication having instead a period of aspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Reichard|1945}} reports that this variation is salient to Navajo speakers and that speakers with aspirated stops called the speakers with velar frication {{Lang|nv|x da’ání|italic=yes}} ('{{angbr|x}}-speakers').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The velar frication on {{IPA|/tʰ, kʰ/}} is also seen in the closely related [[Chiricahua Apache language]]; however, the [[Western Apache language]] does not typically have this velar aspiration.{{Harvcoltxt|Hoijer|1942|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt; An aspirated {{IPA|/pʰ/}} occurs only in loanwords, for instance ''Mísísípii'' {{Ipa|/mɪ́sɪ́sɪ́pʰìː/}}, from English ''Mississippi''.

Similarly the unaspirated velar {{IPA|/k/}} (orthographic {{angbr|{{spell-nv|g}}}}) is realized as with optional voiced velar frication following the stop burst: {{IPA|[k] ~ [kɣ]}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} The unaspirated lateral {{IPA|/tɬ/}} (orthographic {{angbr|{{spell-nv|dl}}}}) typically has a voiced [[lateral release (phonetics)|lateral release]], {{IPA|[tˡ]}}, of a duration comparable to the release of the {{IPA|/k/}} and much shorter than the unaspirated fricatives {{IPA|/ts/, /tʃ/}}. However, the aspirated and ejective laterals are true fricatives.

While the aspiration of stops is markedly long compared to most other languages, the aspiration of the affricates is quite short: the main feature distinguishing {{IPA|/ts/}} and {{IPA|/tʃ/}} from {{IPA|/tsʰ/}} and {{IPA|/tʃʰ/}} is that the frication is half again as long in the latter: {{IPA|[tsˑʰ], [tʃʰˑ]}}. {{IPA|/tɬʰ/}} is similarly long, {{IPA|[tɬˑʰ]}}. The ejectives {{IPA|/tsʼ/, /tɬʼ/, /tʃʼ/}}, on the other hand, have short frication, presumably due to the lack of [[airstream mechanism|pulmonic airflow]]. There is a period of near silence before the glottalized onset of the vowel. In {{IPA|/tɬʼ/}} there may be a double glottal release, or a [[creaky voice|creaky]] onset to the vowel not found in the other ejective affricates.

;Continuants
Navajo voiceless continuants are realized as [[fricative]]s. They are typically noisier than the fricatives that occur in English. The palato-alveolars {{IPA|/ʃ, ʒ/}} are not labialized unlike English and other European languages.{{sfnp|McDonough|2003|p=130}}

Navajo also does not have consistent phonetic voicing in the "voiced" continuant members. Although {{IPA|/z, l, ʒ, ɣ/}} are described as voiced in impressionist descriptions,&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Hoijer|1945a}}&lt;/ref&gt; data from [[spectrogram]]s shows that they may be partially devoiced during the constriction. In stem-initial position, {{IPA|/l/}} tends to be fully voiced, {{IPA|/ʒ/}} has a slight tendency to be voiceless near the offset, {{IPA|/z/}} is often mostly voiceless with phonetic voicing only at the onset, {{IPA|/ɣ/}} is also only partially voiced with voicing at onset. A more consistent acoustic correlate of the "voicing" is the duration of the consonant: "voiceless" consonants have longer durations than "voiced" consonants. Based on this, {{Harvcoltxt|McDonough|2003}} argues that the distinction is better captured with the notion of a fortis/lenis contrast. A further characteristic of voicing in Navajo is that it is marginally contrastive (see the [[#Voicing assimilation|voicing assimilation section]]).

Navajo lacks a clear distinction between phonetic [[fricative]]s and approximants. Although the pair {{IPA|[ɬ]}}~{{IPA|[l]}} has been described as a fricative and an approximant, respectively, the lack of a consistent contrast between the two phonetic categories and a similar patterning with other fricative pairs suggests that they are better described as continuants. Additionally, observations have been made about the less fricative-like nature of {{IPA|[ɣ, ɣʷ]}} and the more fricative-like nature of {{IPA|[j]}}.

;Sonorants
A more abstract analysis of Navajo posits two different {{IPA|/j/}} phonemes (see the [[#Velar /ɣ/, palatal /j/|below]] for elaboration).

The glottalized sonorants are the result of [[#D-effect|''d''-effect]] on the non-glottalized counterparts. A strict structuralist analysis, such as that of {{Harvcoltxt|Hoijer|1945a}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Sapir|Hoijer|1967}}, considers them phonemic.

;Glottal(ized) consonants
Consonants involving a glottal closure — the glottal stop, ejective stops, and the glottalized sonorants — may have optional [[creaky voice]] on voiced sounds adjacent to the glottal gesture. Glottal stops may also be realized entirely as creaky voice instead of single glottal closure.&lt;ref&gt;Similar observations have been noted for the closely related [[Western Apache language]].&lt;/ref&gt; Ejectives in Navajo differ from the ejectives in many other languages in that the glottal closure is not released near-simultaneously with the release of the oral closure (as is common in other languages) — it is held for a significant amount of time following oral release. The glottalized sonorants {{IPA|/mʼ, nʼ/}} are articulated with a glottal stop preceding the oral closure with optional creaky voice during the oral closure: {{IPA|[ʔm ~ ʔm̰, ʔn ~ ʔn̰]}}.

;Labialized consonants
Consonants {{IPA|/kʰʷ, xʷ, ɣʷ, hʷ/}} are predictable variants that occur before the rounded oral vowel {{IPA|/o/}}. However, these sounds also occur before the vowels {{IPA|/i, e, a/}} where they contrast with their non-labialized counterparts {{IPA|/kʰ, x, ɣ, h/}}.

===Velar {{IPA|/ɣ/}}, palatal {{IPA|/j/}}===

The phonological contrast between the velar obstruent {{IPA|/ɣ/}} and the palatal glide {{IPA|/j/}} is [[Phoneme#Neutralization and archiphonemes|neutralized]] in certain contexts. However, in these contexts, they may often be distinguished from each other by their different phonological patterning.

Before the rounded {{IPA|/o/}}, {{IPA|/ɣ/}} is phonetically strongly labialized as {{IPA|[ɣʷ]}}; elsewhere, it lacks the labialization. As noted above, the lenis continuants like {{IPA|/ɣ/}} are often very weak fricatives somewhere between a typical fricative constriction (e.g. {{IPA|[ɣ]}}) and a more open approximant constriction (e.g. {{IPA|[ɰ]}}) — this will be symbolized here as {{IPA|[ɰ̝]}}. {{Harvcoltxt|Hoijer|1945a}} describes the {{IPA|[ɰ̝ʷ]}} realization as being similar to English {{IPA|[w]}} but differing in having slight frication at the beginning of the articulation. The realization before {{IPA|/a/}} varies between an approximant {{IPA|[ɰ]}} and a weakly fricated approximant {{IPA|[ɰ̝]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Hoijer|1945a}} does not note the approximant-like nature of {{IPA|/ɣ/}} before {{IPA|/a/}} although he does do so for the labialized allophone.&lt;/ref&gt; The following verb stem&lt;ref&gt;Navajo verb stems have complex vowel [[ablaut]] involving different vowel qualities, length, nasalization, and tone. The verb stem "make bubbling noise" has the following verb stem-forms: {{spell-nv|-gháásh}}, {{spell-nv|-ghaash}}, {{spell-nv|-gháázh}}, {{spell-nv|-ghaazh}}, {{spell-nv|-ghash}}, {{spell-nv|-wosh}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has different velar allophones of the stem-initial consonant:

The palatal glide {{IPA|/j/}} is also phonetically between an approximant {{IPA|[j]}} and a fricative {{IPA|[ʝ]}}. {{Harvcoltxt|Hoijer|1945a}} compares it to English {{IPA|[j]}} with a "slight but audible 'rubbiness' or frication."

The contrast between velar {{IPA|/ɣ/}} and palatal {{IPA|/j/}} is found before both back vowels {{IPA|/a, o/}} as the following contrasts demonstrate:

:{| class="wikitable"

|}

Before the front vowels {{IPA|/i, e/}}, however, the contrast between {{IPA|/ɣ/}} and {{IPA|/j/}} is neutralized to a palatal articulation much like the weakly fricative {{IPA|[j˔]}} realization of {{IPA|/j/}} that occurs before back vowels. However, the underlying consonant can be ascertained in verb stems and noun stems via their different realizations in a voiceless (i.e. fortis) context. The underlying velar surfaces as a voiceless palatal fricative {{IPA|[ç]}} in these environments:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: right;"

| ''{{spell-nv|yiyizh}}'' || {{IPA|[j˔ɪ̀j˔ɪ̀ʒ]}} || 'she picks (corn)'
|}

The stem-initial velar of the noun stem {{IPA|/xéːɬ/}} has a voiceless fortis realization of {{IPA|[ç]}} (as {{IPA|[çéːɬ]}}) when word-initial. When intervocalic, it is realized as lenis {{IPA|[j˔]}} (as {{IPA|[-j˔éːl]}}). Likewise, the underlying velar of the verb stem {{IPA|/xɪ̀ʒ/}} is a voiceless {{IPA|[ç]}} after the preceding voiceless {{IPA|[ʃ]}} and lenis {{IPA|[j˔]}} when intervocalic. Thus, the alternation of {{IPA|[ç ~ j˔]}} in the two contexts is indicative of an underlying velar consonant. Similarly before the back vowels, the velar continuant has the alternations {{IPA|[x ~ ɰ̝]}} and {{IPA|[xʷ ~ ɰ̝ʷ]}} as shown in the examples below:

|}

An underlying palatal {{IPA|/j/}} can determined by alternations which differ from the velar alternations. However, {{IPA|/j/}} has two different alternation patterns which have led to the positing of two distinct phonemes. Incidentally, the two different phonemes are also connected to two different reconstructed consonants in Proto-Athabascan. One of these {{IPA|/j/}} phonemes is considered an obstruent as it has a fricative realization of {{IPA|[s]}} in fortis contexts. It is often symbolized as a palatalized (or front velar) fricative {{spell-nv|/ɣ̑/}} (in [[Americanist phonetic notation|Americanist]] phonetic notation) and is a reflex of Proto-Athabascan {{spell-nv|*x̯}}. It may be considered coronal because of its coronal voiceless allophone.

|}

In the above examples, the fortis realization is {{IPA|[s]}} in the stems {{IPA|[sɪ̀n]}}, {{IPA|[-sã́]}}, {{IPA|[-sóːt]}} while the lenis realization is the glide {{IPA|[j˔]}} in the corresponding {{IPA|[-j˔ɪ̀n]}}, {{IPA|[-j˔ã́]}}, {{IPA|[-j˔óːt]}}. Since the fortis reflex of this phoneme is {{IPA|[s]}} there is also a neutralization between this {{IPA|/j/}} phoneme and the alveolar {{IPA|/s/}} phoneme. The alveolar phoneme has a {{IPA|[s ~ z]}} alternation in fortis-lenis contexts:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: right;"

| ''{{spell-nv|bizéí}}'' || {{IPA|[pɪ̀zéɪ́]}} || 'her sand'
|}

Thus, the different alternations also distinguish between underlying {{IPA|/j/}} and underlying {{IPA|/s/}}.

The other underlying (or [[morphophonemic]]) palatal {{IPA|/j/}} is considered a sonorant and has an invariant {{IPA|[j˔]}} realization in both fortis (voiceless) and lenis (voiced) contexts. This phoneme is relatively rare, occurring in only a few [[morpheme]]s. It is a reflex of Proto-Athabascan {{spell-nv|*y}} (as symbolized in Americanist notation). Two examples are below:

A further distinction between the different phonemes are found in the context of [[#D-effect|d-effect]].

===Voicing assimilation===
The voiced continuants {{IPA|/z, l, ʒ, ɰ̝/}} at the beginning of stems vary with their voiceless counterparts {{IPA|/s, ɬ, ʃ, x/}}, respectively. The voiceless variants occur when preceded by voiceless consonants, such as {{IPA|/s, ɬ, ʃ, h/}} while the voiced variants occur between voiced sounds (typically intervocalically). For example, the verb stems meaning 'spit it out', 'be burning', 'spit', and 'be ticklish' have the following forms with alternating voiced and voiceless stem-initial consonants:

:{| class="wikitable"
! Phonetic forms !! Orthographic forms !! Gloss
|-
| {{IPA|[zóːh ~ sóːh]}} || {{spell-nv|-zóóh}} ~ {{spell-nv|-sóóh}} || 'spit it out'
|-
| {{IPA|[lɪ̀t ~ ɬɪ̀t]}} || {{spell-nv|-lid}} ~ {{spell-nv|-łid}} || 'be burning'
|-
| {{IPA|[ʒàh ~ ʃàh]}} || {{spell-nv|-zhah}} ~ {{spell-nv|-shah}} || 'spit'
|-
| {{IPA|[ɰ̝ʷòʒ ~ xʷòʒ]}} || {{spell-nv|-wozh}} ~ {{spell-nv|-hozh}} || 'be ticklish'
|}

Since the voicing is predictable, it can be represented more abstractly as an [[underlying representation|underlying]] consonant that is [[underspecified]] with respect to voicing. These [[archiphoneme]]s can be indicated with the capital letters {{IPA|/Z, L, Ʒ, Ɣ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;Conventionally, these are written as voiced in {{Harvcoltxt|Young|Morgan|1987}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The variant voicing of the stem-initial consonant can be found in the context of subject person prefixes which are added to the verb stem:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: right;"

As the above examples show, the stem-initial consonant is voiced when intervocalic&lt;ref&gt;A third person subject is indicated in Navajo verbs by the absence of a subject prefix. A null set symbol Ø is usually used as a place holder (i.e. a [[zero morpheme]]) representing the third person subject. The last verb {{IPA|[jɪ̀ɰ̝ʷòʒ]}} {{spell-nv|yiwozh}} underlyingly consists of a single stem with no prefixes (or, alternately, a single zero morpheme prefix). However, there is a constraint on Navajo verbs in that they must contain at least two syllables and start with a consonant. In order to fulfill this requirement, a semantically empty prefix {{IPA|[jɪ-]}} {{spell-nv|yi-}} (called a ''peg'' prefix) must occur before the stem, thus creating an intervocalic environment which triggers the voicing assimilation. See the [[#Syllable|syllable section]] for further details.&lt;/ref&gt; and voiceless when it is preceded by a voiceless {{IPA|/ʃ-/}} {{spell-nv|sh-}} first person singular subject prefix&lt;ref&gt;An additional complication in this set of data is that the {{IPA|/ʃ-/}} prefix is deleted before [[sibilant]] consonants {{IPA|/s, ʃ/}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or a voiceless {{IPA|[h]}} in the {{IPA|/oh-/}} {{spell-nv|oh-}} two person dual subject prefix.

Another example of contextual voicing of verb-stem-initial consonants occurs when a voiceless {{IPA|/-ɬ-/}} {{spell-nv|-ł-}} classifier prefix occurs before the stem as in the following:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: right;"
! Phonetic form !! Orthographic form !! Underlying segments !! Gloss
|-
| {{IPA|[tìːlzáːs]}} || {{spell-nv|diilzáás}} || {{IPA|tì-Vt-ɬ-Záːs}} || 'we two dribble it along'
|-
| {{IPA|[jɪ̀tɪ̀sáːs]}} || {{spell-nv|yidisáás}} || {{IPA|jìtì-ɬ-Záːs}} || 'he dribbles it along'
|-
| {{IPA|[tɪ̀sáːs]}} || {{spell-nv|disáás}} || {{IPA|tì-ʃ-ɬ-Záːs}} || 'I dribble it along'
|-
| {{IPA|[tòhsáːs]}} || {{spell-nv|dohsáás}} || {{IPA|tì-oh-ɬ-Záːs}} || 'you two dribble it along'
|}

In the verb-form {{IPA|[tìːlzáːs]}} {{spell-nv|diilzáás}} ('we two dribble it along'), the {{IPA|/Z/}} occurs between a voiced {{IPA|[l]}} and the voiced stem vowel {{IPA|[áː]}}. Thus it is realized as a voiced {{IPA|[z]}}. Here the {{IPA|/-ɬ-/}} classifier is voiced due to the [[#D-effect|d-effect]] of the preceding {{IPA|/Vt-/}} first person dual subject prefix. In the other verb-forms, the stem-initial {{IPA|/Z/}} is preceded by voiceless {{IPA|/-ɬ-/}} classifier which results in a voiceless realization of {{IPA|[s]}}. In the surface verb-forms, the underlying {{IPA|/-ɬ-/}} classifier is not pronounced due to a [[phonotactic]] restriction on consonant clusters.

The initial consonant of noun stems also display contextual voicing:
:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: right;"

| {{IPA|[sàːt]}} || {{spell-nv|saad}} || {{IPA|sàːt}} || 'language'

|-
| {{IPA|[pɪ̀ɰ̝ʷòʃ]}} || {{spell-nv|biwosh}} || {{IPA|pì-xòʃ}} || "his cactus"
|}

Here an intervocalic context is created by inflecting the nouns {{spell-nv|saad}}, {{spell-nv|łid}}, {{spell-nv|shaazh}}, {{spell-nv|hosh}} with a {{IPA|[pɪ̀-]}} {{spell-nv|bi-}} third person prefix which ends in a vowel. In this context, the stem-initial consonant is voiced. When these nouns lack a prefix (in which case the stem-initial consonant is word-initial), the realization is voiceless.

However, in some noun stems, the stem-initial continuant does not voice when intervocalic: {{IPA|[ʔàʃĩ̀ːh]}} {{spell-nv|ashįįh}} ('salt').

===Dorsal place assimilation===

The [[dorsal consonant]]s {{IPA|/k, kʰ, kʼ, x, ɣ/}} (written {{angbr|{{spell-nv|g}}}}, {{angbr|{{spell-nv|k}}}}, {{angbr|{{spell-nv|kʼ}}}}, {{angbr|{{spell-nv|h}}}}, {{angbr|{{spell-nv|gh}}}}) have contextual phonetic variants (i.e. [[allophone]]s) varying along [[place of articulation]] that depend on the following vowel environment. They are realized as palatals before the front vowels {{angbr|{{spell-nv|i}}}} and {{angbr|{{spell-nv|e}}}} and as velars before the back vowels {{angbr|{{spell-nv|a}}}} and {{angbr|{{spell-nv|o}}}}. Additionally, they are labialized before the rounded back vowel {{angbr|{{IPA|o}}}}. This likewise happens with the velar frication of the aspirated {{IPA|/tʰ/}}.

===Coronal harmony===
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

Navajo has [[coronal consonant|coronal]] [[sibilant]] [[consonant harmony]]. Alveolar sibilants in prefixes [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilate]] to post-alveolar sibilants in stems, and post-alveolar prefixal sibilants assimilate to alveolar stem sibilants. For example, the ''si-'' stative perfective is realized as ''si-'' or ''shi-'' depending upon whether the stem contains a post-alveolar sibilant. For example, while ''sido'' ('it is hot' perfective) has the first form, ''shibeezh'' ('it is boiled' perfective), the stem-final {{IPA|/ʒ/}} triggers the change to {{IPA|/ʃ/}}.

===D-effect===
A particular type of [[morphophonemic]] [[Apophony|alternation]] (or [[Consonant mutation|mutation]]) occurring in Athabascan languages called ''d-effect'' is found in Navajo. The alternation in most cases is a [[fortition]] (or strengthening) process. The initial consonant of a verb stem alternates with a strengthened consonant when it is preceded by a {{IPA|/-t-/}} (orthographic {{angbr|{{spell-nv|-d-}}}}) "classifier" prefix or the {{IPA|/-Vt-/}} first person dual subject prefix.&lt;ref&gt;The {{spell-nv|-d-}} classifier occurs in position 9 of the prefix template found in {{Harvcoltxt|Young|Morgan|1987}} while the {{spell-nv|-Vd-}} prefix occurs in position 8. See the [[#Classifiers (transitivity prefixes)|classifier section]] below for more about classifier prefixes.&lt;/ref&gt; The underlying {{IPA|/t/}} of these prefixes is absorbed into the following stem. D-effect can be viewed prosodically as the result of a [[phonotactic]] constraint on consonant clusters that would otherwise result from the concatenation of underlying segments.{{sfnp|McDonough|2003|p=60}} There is thus an interaction between a requirement for the grammatical information to be expressed in the surface form and an avoidance of having sequences of consonants (see the [[#Syllable|syllable section]] for more on phonotactics).

The fortition is typically a change from continuant to affricate or continuant to stop (i.e. adding a period of closure to the articulation). However, other changes involve glottalization of the initial consonant:

:{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center;"
! Prefix consonant + Stem-initial consonant&lt;ref&gt;The continuant stem-initial consonants are represented here as archiphonemes {{IPA|/Z, L, Ʒ, Ɣ/}} instead of voiced (or voiceless) continuants.

|}

The two occurrences of {{IPA|t- + -j}} in the chart above reflect two different patterns of d-effect involving stem-initial {{IPA|/j/}}. Often different underlying consonants are posited to explain the different alternation. The first alternation is posited as a result of underlying {{IPA|t- + -ɣ}} leading to a d-effect mutation of {{IPA|/dz/}}. The other is {{IPA|t- + -j}} resulting in {{IPA|/jˀ/}}. (See the [[#Velar /ɣ/, palatal /j/|velar /ɣ/, palatal /j/ section]] for further explanation.)

Another example of d-effect influences not the stem-initial consonant but the classifier prefix. When the {{IPA|/-Vt-/}} first person dual subject prefix precedes the {{IPA|/-ɬ-/}} (orthographic {{angbr|{{spell-nv|-ł-}}}}) classifier prefix, the {{IPA|/-ɬ-/}} classifier is realized as voiced {{IPA|[l]}}:

Navajo has four contrastive [[vowel]] qualities {{IPA|[i, e, o, ɑ]}} at three different vowel heights (high, mid, low) and a front-back contrast between the mid vowels {{IPA|[e, o]}}. There are also two contrastive [[vowel length]]s and a contrast in [[nasalization]]. This results in 16 phonemic vowels, shown below.

There is a phonetic vowel quality difference between the long high vowel {{IPA|/iː/}} (orthographic {{angbr|{{spell-nv|ii}}}}) and the short high vowel {{IPA|/i/}} (orthographic {{angbr|{{spell-nv|i}}}}): the shorter vowel is significantly lower at {{IPA|[ɪ]}} than its long counterpart. This phonetic difference is salient to native speakers, who will consider a short vowel at a higher position to be a mispronunciation. Similarly, short {{IPA|/e/}} is pronounced {{IPA|[ɛ]}}. Short {{IPA|/o/}} is a bit more variable and more [[Centralization (phonetics)|centralized]], covering the space {{IPA|[ɔ] ~ [ɞ]}}. Notably, the variation in {{IPA|/o/}} does not approach {{IPA|[u]}}, which is a true gap in the vowel space.

Although the nasalization is contrastive in the surface phonology, many instances of nasalized vowels can be derived from a sequence of Vowel + Nasal consonant in a more abstract analysis. Additionally, there are alternations between long and short vowels that are predictable.

There have been a number of somewhat different descriptions of Navajo vowels, which are conveniently summarized in {{Harvcoltxt|McDonough|2003}}.

===Acoustic phonetics===

==Tones==
Navajo has two [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]: high and low. Orthographically, high tone is marked with an [[acute accent]] {{angbr|á}} over the affected vowel, while low tone is left unmarked {{angbr|a}} This reflects the [[tonal polarity]] of Navajo, as syllables have low tone by default.

Long vowels normally have level tones {{angbr|áá, aa}}. However, in [[contraction (grammar)|grammatical contractions]] and in Spanish [[loan word]]s such as {{lang|nv|béeso}} ('money' from Spanish {{lang|es|[[peso]]}}), long vowels may have falling {{angbr|áa}} or rising {{angbr|aá}} tones.

The sonorant {{IPA|/n/}} also carries tone when it is syllabic. Here again, the high tone is marked with an acute {{angbr|ń}} while the low tone is left unmarked {{angbr|n}}.

Even though low tone is the default, these syllables are not underspecified for tone: they have a distinct phonetic tone, and their pitch is not merely a function of their environment. This contrasts with the related [[Carrier language]]. As in many languages, however, the pitches at the beginnings of Navajo vowels are lower after voiced consonants than after tenuis and aspirated consonants. After ejective consonants, only high tones are lowered, so that the distinction between high and low tone is reduced. However, the type of consonant has little effect on the pitch in the middle of the vowel, so that vowels have characteristic rising pitches after voiced consonants.

The pitch of a vowel is also affected by the tone of the previous syllable: in most cases, this has as great an effect on the pitch of a syllable as its own tone. However, this effect is effectively blocked by an intervening aspirated consonant.{{sfnp|deJong|McDonough|1993}}

===Tonological processes===
Navajo nouns are simple: {{IPA|/kʰṍ/}} {{IPA|[kʰṍ]}} ''kǫ́'' ('fire'), {{IPA|/pi-tiɬ/}} {{IPA|[pìtìɬ]}} ''bidił'' ('his blood'). Most long nouns are actually [[deverbal]].

In verbs, with few exceptions, only [[word stem|stems]] may carry a high tone: [[consonant|C]][[vowel|V]](ː)(C)([[tone (linguistics)|T]]). Prefixes are mostly single consonants, C-, and do not carry tone. The one exception is the high-tone vocalic prefix {{IPA|/ʌ́n/-}}.{{clarify|reason=No phoneme /ʌ/ listed in the Vowel section above.|date=November 2015}} Most other tone-bearing units in the Navajo verb are second stems or [[clitic]]s.

All Navajo verbs can be analyzed as compounds, and this greatly simplifies the description of tone. There are two obligatory components, the "I" stem (for "inflection") and the "V" stem (for "verb"), each potentially bearing a high tone, and each preceded by its own prefixes.&lt;ref&gt;These are actually [[root word|roots]], and the prefix-root unit is technically the stem, but the use of the word 'stem' for 'root' is widespread in Athabaskan studies.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the compound as a whole takes 'agreement' prefixes like the prefixes found on nouns. This entire word may then take proclitics, which may also carry tone:

:{| class="wikitable" border="1"
! clitics=
| agreement– || (prefixes–
! I-stem)
|  + || (prefixes–
! V-stem)
|-
| ''tone'' || colspan="2" | || ''tone'' || colspan="2" | || ''tone''
|}

(Hyphens – mark prefixes, double hyphens = mark clitics, and plus signs + join compounds.)

Any high tones on clitics and the prefix {{IPA|/ʌ́n/-}} spread to the next syllable of the word. This spreading is blocked by long vowels, as can be seen with the [[iterative]] clitic {{IPA|/ná/꞊}}. Compare

:{{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;/ha꞊niʃ+ɬ-tʃʰɑːt/&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
:{{IPA|[haniʃɬtʃʰɑːt]}}
:''hanishchaad''
and
:{{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;/hɑ꞊nɑ́꞊niʃ+ɬ-tʃʰɑːt/&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
:{{IPA|[hɑnɑ́níʃɬtʃʰɑːt]}}
:''hanáníshchaad,''
where the clitic ''nɑ́='' creates a high tone on the following syllable, but,
:{{IPA|&lt;nowiki&gt;/ná꞊iːt+l-zéːh/&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}
:{{IPA|[nɑ́iːtlzéːh]}}
:''náiilzééh''
where it does not.

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

* conjunct prefixes in verb stems are unmarked for tone (with a few exceptions) — they assimilate to the tones of neighboring prefixes
* tones in disjunct prefixes and stems are underlying specified
* certain enclitics (like the subordinator {{angbr|{{spell-nv|&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;go}}}}) affect the tones of preceding verb stems

==Syllable==
{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}

''Stems.'' The stems (e.g. noun stems, verb stems, etc.) have the following [[syllable]] types:

: {{IPA|[[consonant|C]][[vowel|V]](ː)([[tone (linguistics)|T]])(C)}}

That is, all syllables must have a consonant [[syllable onset|onset]] C, a vowel [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]] V. The syllable may carry a high tone T, the vowel nucleus may be short or long, and there may optionally be a consonant [[syllable coda|coda]].

''Prefixes.'' Prefixes typically have a syllable structure of CV-, such as ''chʼí-'' ('out horizontally'). Exceptions to this are certain verbal prefixes, such as the classifiers (''-ł-'', ''-l-'', ''-d-'') that occur directly before the verb stem, which consist of a single consonant -C-. A few other verbal prefixes, such as ''naa-'' ('around') on the outer left edge of the verb have long vowels, CVV-. A few prefixes have more complex syllable shapes, such as ''hashtʼe-'' ('ready') (CVCCV-). Prefixes do not carry tone.

Some analyses, such as that of [[Harry Hoijer]], consider conjunct verbal prefixes to have the syllable shape CV-. In other generative analyses,&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Wright|1983}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Speas|1985}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Speas|1990}}, {{Harvcoltxt|McDonough|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same prefixes are considered to have only [[underlying form|underlying]] consonants of the shape C-. Then, in certain environments, an [[epenthetic]] vowel (the default vowel is {{angbr|i}}) is inserted after the consonantal prefix.

===Peg elements, segment insertion===

{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

All verbs must be disyllabic. Some verbs may only have a single overt nonsyllabic consonantal prefix or a prefix lacking an onset, or no prefix at all before the verb stem. Since all verbs are required to have two syllables, a meaningless prefix must be added to the verb to fulfill the disyllabic requirement. This prosodic prefix is known as a ''peg element'' in Athabascan terminology ([[Edward Sapir]] used the term ''pepet vowel''). For example, the verb meaning "she/he/they is/are crying" has the following morphological composition: ''Ø-Ø-cha'' where both the imperfective modal prefix and the third person subject prefix are phonologically [[null morpheme]]s and the verb stem is ''-cha''. In order for this verb to be complete a ''yi-'' peg element must be prefixed to the verb stem, resulting in the verb form ''yicha''. Another examples are verb ''yishcha'' ('I'm crying') which is morphologically ''Ø-sh-cha'' (''Ø-'' null imperfective modal, ''-sh-'' first person singular subject, ''-cha'' verb stem) and ''wohcha'' ('you [2+] are crying') which is ''Ø-oh-cha'' (''Ø-'' null imperfective modal, ''-oh-'' second person dual-plural subject, ''-cha'' verb stem). The [[Semivowel|glide]] consonant of the peg element is {{angbr|y}} before {{angbr|i}}, {{angbr|w}} before {{angbr|o}}, and {{angbr|gh}} before {{angbr|a}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11222">An [[international co-production|international film or television co-production]] is a production made by production companies in different countries.  This note focuses on ‘official’ Australian co-productions, that is, co-productions that meet the requirements for benefits under the [http://www.afc.gov.au/filminginaustralia/copros/fiapage_2.aspx Australian Official Co-Production Program].  It looks at trends in production, the potential impact of recent changes to film funding, and what lies ahead for Australia’s involvement in co-production.

==Official co-production in Australia==

Official co-productions are made possible by formal agreements between countries. For filmmakers, the key attraction of a treaty co-production is that it qualifies as a national production in each of the partner nations. Thus, it can access benefits that are available to the local film and television industry in more than one country. Benefits may include government subsidies, tax concessions and inclusion in domestic television broadcast quotas.

The Australian government has signed official film co-production agreements with the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Italy]], [[Ireland]], [[Israel]], [[Germany]], [[China]] and, most recently, [[Singapore]] (as treaties); and [[France]] and [[New Zealand]] (as memoranda of understanding or MOUs.&lt;ref&gt;AFC (Australian Film Commission). 2007. [http://www.afc.gov.au/downloads/pubs/copreport_jun07_dec07.pdf 'Data on Official Coproductions'] and  [http://www.afc.gov.au/filminginaustralia/copros/copro_update/fiapage_87.aspx 'Coproduction Update'.]&lt;/ref&gt; Official co-production agreements set the criteria that a production must meet in order to be considered an official co-production. Criteria may cover co-financing, creative participation and copyright ownership.

[[International co-production]]s also occur outside the framework of official co-productions, either with countries that do not have an agreement with Australia, or as projects that do not satisfy official co-production criteria.  Examples of the former include the Australia/US co-productions ''[[Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles]]'' (2001) and ''[[Farscape]]'' (1999–2003).

Australian co-production agreements are administered by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20071111165204/http://afc.gov.au/ Australian Film Commission] (AFC) on behalf of the [[Government of Australia|Australian Government]]. (In July 2008 the AFC will be merged with other film agencies to become [[Screen Australia]]; the new organisation will then have oversight over co-productions.) The overriding objective is to maintain an overall balance between the creative and financial contributions of each country over time. Accordingly, there is some discretion in granting co-production status to an individual co-production if there is an imbalance between financial and creative contributions.

The AFC’s [http://www.afc.gov.au/filminginaustralia/copros/guide_app/fiapage_63.aspx International Co-production Program Guidelines] set out eligibility conditions for the granting of co-production status. These relate to the authorship of the underlying works and screenplays, co-producer participation, sources of finance, control over copyright; and the engagement of key creative participants.  Co-productions are restricted to particular genres: feature films, drama series, miniseries, documentaries and telemovies. At the level of the individual production there must be a producer from each of the partner countries, a minimum level of Australian equity in the project (20 to 30 per cent) and matching participation by Australian creative components.

A points system is used to ensure a balance between the Australian budget contribution and the participation of key personnel (creative and crew). Points are attached to key creative positions including director, writer, editor and key cast. By amassing a minimum number of points, a production can qualify as ‘Australian’. In this context the participation of Australian financial and creative resources acts as a proxy for ‘Australian content’. Different points systems apply to the production of live action drama, documentary and animation, reflecting the importance of particular roles specific to each genre.

==Australia’s engagement in international co-productions==

Australia was a relatively late entrant into the sphere of official co-production. Its first agreement was signed with France in 1986.  France itself entered into a co-production agreement with Italy in 1949 while Canada, a leading co-production country, entered its first agreement in 1963 and now has agreements with 53 other countries.

As of April 2007, Australia had engaged in 96 official co-productions that were either completed or in production. Feature films and television drama are the production types most likely to be co-productions: they total 35 and 21 productions respectively, with total budgeted costs of A$385.15 million and A$294.71 million.  Australia has partnered most frequently with Canada and the United Kingdom. Australia and Canada have produced 31 co-productions with budgets totalling A$347 million and Australia and the United Kingdom have co-produced 30 productions, with budgets of A$323.43 million.&lt;ref name="Get the Picture"&gt;AFC (Australian Film Commission). 2007. [http://www.afc.gov.au/gtp Get the Picture.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia’s official co-production record is modest by international standards. In 2005–2006 Australia engaged in 10 co-productions with total budgets of $60 million and an Australian spend of $35m.&lt;ref name="Get the Picture"/&gt;  Canada, by comparison, had 58 co-productions in 2006 with total budgets in excess of C$404 million and a Canadian share of C$166 million.&lt;ref&gt;Telefilm Canada. 2006. [http://www.telefilm.gc.ca/04/42.asp Statistics on Coproduction 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the United Kingdom had 57 productions with total budgets of ₤124.8 million.&lt;ref&gt;UK Film Council 2006. [http://www.ukfilmcouncil.org.uk/yearbook Statistical Yearbook 2006/07]&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, co-productions represent a small proportion of the Australian industry. In 2005–2006, 32 feature films were made in Australia. Of these, four were foreign and only three were co-productions. Domestic expenditure for local films was A$97 million and for foreign films was A$23 million, while co-productions totalled a modest A$13 million. Similarly, local television drama in the six years to 2005–2006 had an average annual spend of A$202 million, while foreign drama and co-productions amounted to A$37 million apiece.

Although co-productions contributed only a small proportion of total production budgets in Australia, individual co-productions tend to have higher budgets. Of the 35 co-produced feature films, 49 per cent had budgets in excess of $10m. By comparison, only 18% of all Australian-produced features between 1988/89 and 2005/06 reached this level. Mini-series showed a similar bias: 90% of co-productions had budgets between $6 and $20m compared with just 61% of all series over the same period.&lt;ref name="Get the Picture"/&gt;

Co-production is a more common production mode for children’s television drama. In the six years to 2005/06, the Australian industry averaged 96 hours of co-produced TV drama, at budgets of $61.8m. Of this, 27 hours were dedicated to children’s drama, at average annual budgets of $16.1m. The higher reliance on co-production for children’s content stems from the difficulty of financing children’s programs, and the ability of children’s animation to translate easily into different cultures.

While the trend through the 1990s was for a greater total spend in Australia for co-productions, reaching a high of $111m in 2001/2002, the trend since then has been downward, with only $36m being spent in 2005/06.  This is largely due to a fall in television drama co-production from a high of $83m in 2001/02 to just $23m in 2005/06. Feature films, on the other hand, have experienced a revival from 2000/01, but have only averaged a modest $22.2m in Australian spend in the six years from 2001/02.

==The future of co-production in Australia==

A number of economic, industry and cultural factors influence decisions to undertake an official co-production. These factors include the value of the Australian dollar, the availability of skilled crews, access to tax offsets and other financial incentives, the generation of creative content and the signing of further bilateral agreements. Higher production budgets, falling television licence fees and lower distribution guarantees are all factors that will continue to drive the international demand for co-productions. As discussed by Hoskins, McFadyen, &amp; Finn, Australian producers find financial pooling the most important benefit of co-production and it is likely that this will be pursued more vigorously in the future.

The recently introduced [[Film and television financing in Australia|Producer Offset]] is also expected to drive a higher level of co-production. Australian production companies making official co-productions will be automatically entitled to a  tax offset of 40% of qualifying Australian production expenditure (QAPE) for feature films and 20% of QAPE for documentary, television series, telemovies and short animation.

An increase in the number of countries with which Australia has co-production agreements may also encourage greater levels of co-production. Australia recently entered into agreements with [[China]] and [[Singapore]], increasing the number of agreements to 11. Further, [[Australia]] has signed agreements with a number of [[Europe]]an countries which are parties to the European Convention on Cinematographic Co-production. Indirectly, this convention may provide further opportunities for collaboration with other [[European Union]] countries.

Noting the favourable performance results for Australian co-productions, Hoskins, McFadyen and Finn advocate 'greater government initiative in treaty negotiation and increased official openness to international co-production'.&lt;ref&gt;Hoskins, Colin, Stuart McFadyen and Adam Finn. 1999. [http://www.cjc-online.ca/viewarticle.php?id=508 “International Joint Ventures in the Production of Australian Feature Films and Television Programs.”] ''Canadian Journal of Communication'' 24(1).&lt;/ref&gt; As the Australian film financing landscape shifts over the coming period, there is every chance that these policy issues will provide the grist for further discussions. At the same time, we can expect that Australian producers and their international partners will seek out innovative ways to harness the benefits of co-production, particularly in light of the new tax regime.&lt;ref&gt;In fact, some have suggested that tax incentives are a principal driver of the worldwide upswing in coproduction activity. See Norbert Morawetz, Jane Hardy, Colin Haslam and Keith Randle, 2007, 'Finance, Policy and Industrial Dynamics – The Rise of Coproductions in the Film Industry', ''Industry and Innovation'' 14(4): 421–443.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ometo''' languages of [[Ethiopia]] are a [[dialect cluster]] of the [[Omotic languages|Omotic family]], generally accepted as part of the [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic language family]]. They include the most populous Omotic language, [[Wolaytta language|Wolaytta]], with two million speakers.&lt;ref name="Bender"/&gt; The languages have around 4 million speakers.

Bender (2000) classifies them as,&lt;ref name="Bender"&gt;Bender, M. Lionel. 2000. ''Comparative Morphology of the Omotic Languages.'' Munich: LINCOM. Classification copied in Raymond G. Gordon Jr., ed.  2005.  ''Ethnologue:  Languages of the World''.  15th edition.  Dallas:  Summer Institute of Linguistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

*East: Gats'ame ([[Kachama-Ganjule language|Kachama-Ganjule]]), [[Koorete language|Koorete]] (Koyra, Harro), [[Zayse-Zergulla language|Zayse-Zergulla]]

Hayward (2003) added Basketo to Central Ometo and called the result 'North Ometo',&lt;ref&gt;Hayward, Richard J. 2003. 'Omotic: the "empty quarter" of Afroasiatic linguistics'. In ''Research in Afroasiatic Grammar II: selected papers from the fifth conference on Afroasiatic languages, Paris 2000,'' ed. by Jacqueline Lecarme, pp. 241-261. Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt; a position followed by Blench (2006). Blench lists several additional North Ometo languages, and lists [[Chara language|Chara]] as unclassified within the family.&lt;ref&gt;Blench, 2006.

He also lists ''Balta'', a regional name for Wolaytta, as a possibly separate language.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4853">'''Pierre Bec''' (in [[Occitan]] '''''Pèire Bèc''''' 11 December 1921 – 30 June 2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mor l'occitanista Pèire Bèc|url=http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.21576464db9e81e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=035748a344371110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=035748a344371110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detall&amp;contentid=f6ec57aa141f6410VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD|publisher=www20.gencat.cat|accessdate=28 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[French people|French]] [[Occitan language]] poet and linguist. Born in [[Paris]], he spent his childhood in [[Comminges]], where he learnt [[Occitan]]. He was deported to [[Germany]] between 1943 and 1945. After returning, he studied in Paris, where he graduated in 1959. He was one of the founders of the IEO or [[Institut d'Estudis Occitans]] (Institute of Occitan Studies) as well as its president from 1962 to 1980.

==Life==
Bec was titular professor at [[Poitiers]] university and assistant director of the ''Centre d'Études Supérieures de Civilisation Médiévale'' (Centre for high studies in medieval civilisation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Covell| first = Roger| coauthors = | title = Poets' justice; CD Reviews | work = | pages = | publisher = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]| date = October 20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered one of the most important specialists in Occitan [[dialectology]] and in mediaeval Occitan literature. His activity is distributed among Occitanist politics, philological research and literary creation. He collaborated with publications like ''Cahiers de Civilisation Médiévale'', ''Revue de Linguistique Romane'', ''Estudis Romànics'', ''Oc''.

In 1982 he took part in the Linguistic Normalisation commission for [[Aranese]], with [[Jacme Taupiac]] and [[Miquèu Grosclaude]]: they established some linguistics norms, officialised in 1983, following [[Institut d'Estudis Occitans|IEO]]'s indications for [[Gascon language|Gascon]].

Bec died in [[Poitiers]] on 30 June 2014, at the age of 92.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www20.gencat.cat/portal/site/Llengcat/menuitem.21576464db9e81e7a129d410b0c0e1a0/?vgnextoid=035748a344371110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=035748a344371110VgnVCM1000000b0c1e0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=detall&amp;contentid=f6ec57aa141f6410VgnVCM1000008d0c1e0aRCRD Mor l'occitanista Pèire Bèc]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance for Gallo-Cisalpine language(s) ==
As a linguist, Pierre Bec stated, within his ''Manuel pratique de Philologie romane'' (2nd volume, p.&amp;nbsp;316) that some kind of diachronical unity holds between [[Rhaeto-Romance]] languages (i.e. [[Romansh language|Romansh]], [[Friulian language|Friulian]] and [[Ladin language|Ladin]]) and [[Northern Italian]] or Cisalpine ones ([[Western Lombard language|Western Lombard]], [[Eastern Lombard language|Eastern Lombard]], [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]], [[Venetian language|Venetan]], [[Emiliano-Romagnolo language|Emiliano-Romagnolo]] and [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]]). This issue has been further investigated by the [[Australian]] linguist [[Geoffrey Hull]].&lt;ref&gt;Hull, Geoffrey, PhD thesis 1982 (University of Sydney), published as ''The Linguistic Unity of Northern Italy and Rhaetia: Historical Grammar of the Padanian Language.'' 2 vols. Sydney: Beta Crucis, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and use==
The term "Plastic Brit" is derived from [[Plastic Paddy]], which is used to describe people who claim to be Irish despite not residing in that country.&lt;ref name= tele /&gt; While the concept gained the British media's attention in the run-up to the [[2012 Summer Olympics]], it had also been used in describing members of other British sporting teams. England's cricket team had a perceived problem of having too many foreign-born players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/features/5813538/crickets-foreign-legion/|title=London Cricket's foreign legions |publisher=The Spectator |date=3 March 2010 |accessdate=4 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[England and Wales Cricket Board]] responded to the issue by lengthening the residency period before a foreign player can be accepted to play for England to seven years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2012/apr/30/ecb-england-overseas-qualification-period |title=ECB extends qualification period for overseas players to seven years |newspaper=The Guardian |date=30 April 2012 |accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was popularised in the United Kingdom through its usage in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' newspaper to describe athletes born outside the UK who had been selected to represent Great Britain at the [[London 2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref name=point&gt;{{cite news|first=Sunder |last=Katwala |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/aug/03/plastic-brits-olympic-team |title=Accusing Olympic athletes of being 'plastic Brits' misses the point |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 August 2012 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term originally had foundations from [[South Africa]]n-born [[Zola Budd]] having her British citizenship application fast tracked in order to represent Great Britain at the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=mirror/&gt;

Several athletes have been described by the press as "Plastic Brits". [[Tiffany Porter]] was selected as the captain of Great Britain's athletics team at the [[2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships]] despite being born in the [[United States]]. She was described as a "Plastic Brit" in the media for refusing to recite the words of the British national anthem, "[[God Save the Queen]]", at a press conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last= McEvoy |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/olympics/article-2112352/Tiffany-Porter-lead-Team-GB-World-Indoor-Championships.html |title=It could have been Farah or Ennis but our athletes will be led by a Plastic Brit|newspaper=Daily Mail |date=8 March 2012|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Porter broke the British record for the [[100 metres hurdles]], the previous record holder [[Angela Thorp]] said that she felt "devastated" that Porter had broken her record because she had expected [[Jessica Ennis]] to break it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Martin|last= Samuel |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/article-2008394/Martin-Samuel-Losing-record-Plastic-Brit-left-devastated.html |title=Losing my record to a Plastic Brit has left me devastated|newspaper=Daily Mail |date=11 June 2011 |accessdate=21 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was argued by some newspaper reporters that selecting athletes born outside of the UK was discriminatory against British-born athletes and was against the spirit of the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Reuters |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-08-09/news/sns-rt-oly-wres-wrw55k-rounds-day13briton-pixl6e8j19un-20120809_1_british-passport-wrestler-homegrown-athletes |title="Plastic Brit" out after six minutes at Games |newspaper=Chicago Tribune |date=9 August 2012 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) imposed a mandatory three-year waiting period before athletes could compete in the Olympics for another country.&lt;ref name="Magnay/Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news| first= Jacquelin |last=Magnay| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/9143611/London-2012-Olympics-IOC-President-Jacques-Rogge-hits-out-at-mercenary-athletes.html |title=IOC President Jacques Rogge hits out at mercenary athletes |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=14 March 2012 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[International Olympic Committee]] chairman [[Jacques Rogge]] said, "Then there are cases where there is support [for athletes competing for other countries] but they go because there is a bigger gain [for the athlete] in another country. Legally we can't stop it but it doesn't mean we love it."&lt;ref name="Magnay/Telegraph" /&gt; In 2015, the term was also erroneously levelled at sprinter [[Zharnel Hughes]] by some newspapers despite Hughes having British citizenship by virtue of being born in [[Anguilla]], a [[British Overseas Territory]] without IOC recognition.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/03/zharnel-hughes-plastic-brit-shrugs-off-british-championships&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The term "Plastic Brit" has been criticised in the British media. The ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' suggested that fans overlook athletes' places of birth if they perform well for Great Britain.&lt;ref name=tele /&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper criticised the ''Daily Mail''{{'}}s usage of the term, saying that the definition of a "Plastic Brit" was inconsistent and that under some definitions, some British-born athletes such as [[Ryan Giggs]] would be classed as "Plastic Brits" for failing to sing "God Save the Queen".&lt;ref name=point /&gt; The ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' newspaper also said that the ''Daily Mail'', along with other newspapers,  had supported the selection of Zola Budd to represent Great Britain at the 1984 Olympic Games.&lt;ref name=mirror&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve |last=Ovett |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/other-sports/athletics/steve-ovett-plastic-brits-is-a-snide-1202277 |title=Plastic Brits is a snide term but why make Tiffany Porter sing the national anthem |newspaper=Daily Mirror |date=1 August 2012 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper said that a third of Great Britain's gold medal winners at the Olympics and Paralympic games had a non-British parent or had been born outside of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Riding |first=Matthew |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/olympics/news/plastic-brits-they-were-the-secret-of-our-success-8038764.html |title=Plastic Brits? They were the secret of our success |newspaper=The Independent |date=14 August 2012 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of athletes were also critical of the term. Triple jumper [[Yamilé Aldama]], who had been described as a "Plastic Brit", openly criticised the term in an article in ''The Guardian'' newspaper. She said, "I have lived in this country for 11 years, I am married to a British man, I have British children, I train under a British coach, at a British club. This is my home. What are they talking about?".&lt;ref name="Aldama/Guardian" /&gt; She also said that a number of other athletes, including Farah and [[Kevin Pietersen]]{{mdash}}who had represented Great Britain and the [[England cricket team]] respectively{{mdash}}had not been born in the United Kingdom but were not branded as "Plastic Brits".&lt;ref name="Aldama/Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|first=Yamilé |last=Aldama |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2012/jul/14/yamile-aldama-plastic-brit-jibe-offensive |title=Yamilé Aldama: Plastic Brit jibe is so offensive in our country today |newspaper=The Guardian |date= 14 July 2012|accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marathon runner [[Paula Radcliffe]] also criticised the term, asking for Great Britain supporters at the Olympics to support every athlete representing Great Britain, regardless of their countries of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/olympics/17624597 |title=London 2012: Paula Radcliffe gives support to 'Plastic Brits' |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 April 2012 |accessdate=12 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-distance runner [[Mo Farah]], when asked by a journalist if he should run for [[Somalia]], said, "Look mate, this is my country.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5197">In [[linguistics]], '''quirky subjects''' (also called '''oblique subjects''') are a phenomenon where certain [[verb]]s specify that their subjects are to be in a case other than the [[nominative case|nominative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Eiríkur| last=Rögnvaldsson| chapterurl=http://www.hi.is/~eirikur/quirkysb.pdf| chapter=Quirky Subjects in Old Icelandic| year=1991| editor=Halldór Ármann Sigurðsson| title=Papers from the Twelfth Scandinavian Conference of Linguistics| pages=369–378.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NonNom"&gt;{{cite book |title=Non-nominative Subjects|author=Fischer, Susann| chapter=The diachronic relationship between quirky subjects and stylistic fronting|editor1=Peri Bhaskararao |editor2=Karumuri V. Subbarao |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company| year=2004| isbn=90-272-2970-8| pages=193–212|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tg3XQlsgnHQC&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=%22quirky+subjects%22+icelandic&amp;source=web&amp;ots=fwoznh_ZM5&amp;sig=J8yClnj1DdZmFaMpLxpuKsrXpl8&amp;hl=en#PPA193,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a sentence like "''*Me like him''" is ungrammatical in Standard English because the subject is ordinarily in the nominative. In many or most modern [[nominative–accusative language]]s, this rule is inflexible: the subject is indeed in the nominative case, and almost all treat the subjects of all verbs the same. [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] has been argued to be the only modern language with quirky subjects, and is thus of interest to linguistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Faarlund| first=Jan T.| year=2001| chapter=The notion of oblique subject and its status in the history of Icelandic| editor=Jan T. Faarlund| title=Grammatical relations in change| location=Amsterdam| publisher=John Benjamins| pages=99–135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The class of quirky subjects in Icelandic is a large one, consisting of hundreds of verbs in a number of distinct classes: experiencer verbs like ''vanta'' (need/lack), motion verbs like ''reka'' (drift), change of state verbs like ''ysta'' (curdle), verbs of success/failure like ''takast'' (succeed/manage to), verbs of acquisition like ''áskotnast'' (acquire/get by luck), and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Jónsson| first=Jóhannes G.| year=2003| chapter=Not so quirky: On subject case in Icelandic| editor1=Ellen Brandner| editor2=Heike Zinsmeister| title=New Perspectives on Case Theory | location=Stanford, CA| publisher=CSLI Publications| pages=127–163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In superficially similar constructions of the type seen in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''me gusta'' "I like", the analogous part of speech (in this case ''me'') is not a true syntactical subject.&lt;!-- So do not add these examples again! --&gt; "Me" is instead the object of the verb "gusta" which has a meaning closer to "please", thus, "me gusta" could be translated as "(he/she/it) pleases me".

Many linguists, especially from various persuasions of the broad school of [[cognitive linguistics]], do not use the term "quirky subjects" since the term is biased towards languages of nominative–accusative type. Often, "quirky subjects" are semantically motivated by the predicates of their clauses. Dative-subjects, for example, quite often correspond with predicates indicating sensory, cognitive, or experiential states across a large number of languages. In some cases, this can be seen as evidence for the influence of [[active–stative]] typology.

==Examples in Icelandic==
In Icelandic, verbs can require a non-nominative subject. The following examples show an accusative subject and a dative subject, respectively. 
:{|
| Mig || vantar || peninga
|- 
| Me(acc) || need(3sg) || money (acc.pl)
|-
| colspan="2"|I need money.
|}

:{|
| Mér || líkar || maturinn
|- 
| Me(dat) || like(3sg) || the food (nom.sg)
|-
| colspan="2"|I like food.
|}

Quirky subject can also occur when verbs taking a dative or genitive argument occur in the passive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Halldor| last=Sigurdsson| chapterurl=https://lucris.lub.lu.se/ws/files/4724092/8500151.pdf| chapter=The case of quirky subjects| year=1992| editor=Halldór Ármann Sigurðsson| title=(Working Papers in Scandinavian Syntax; Vol. 49).

:{|
| Stelpunum || var || hjálpað

In [[semantics]], a [[grammatical modifier|modifier]] is said to be '''restrictive''' (or ''defining'') if it restricts the [[reference#Semantics|reference]] of its [[head (linguistics)|head]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Suprun |editor1-first=Adam |editor2-last=Jachnow |editor2-first=Helmut |title=Slavjano-germanskie jazykovye paralleli/Slawisch-germanische Sprachparallelen |series=Sovmestnyj issledovatel'skij sbornik slavistov universitetov v Minske i Bochume |publisher=Belorusskij gosudarstvennyj universitet |page=163 |language=German |chapter=Pronomina im Antezendenten und Restriktivität/Nicht-Restriktivität von Relativsätzen im Kroatoserbischen und Deutschen |trans-chapter=Pronouns in antecedents and restrictive / non-restrictive relative clauses in Serbo-Croatian and German |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426662.PRONOMINA_IM_ANTEZEDENT.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Minsk |year=1996 |oclc=637166830 |archivedate=29 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DH3hx83b?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426662.PRONOMINA_IM_ANTEZEDENT.PDF |accessdate=24 October 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in "the red car is fancier than the blue one", ''red'' and ''blue'' are restrictive, because they restrict which cars ''car'' and ''one'' are referring to. ("The car is fancier than the one" would make little sense.) By contrast, in "John's beautiful mother", ''beautiful'' is [[non-restrictive]]; "John's mother" identifies her sufficiently, whereas "beautiful" only serves to add more information.

Restrictive modifiers are also called ''defining'', ''identifying'', ''essential'', or ''necessary''; non-restrictive ones are also called ''non-defining'', ''non-identifying'', ''descriptive'', or ''unnecessary'' (though this last term can be misleading). In certain cases, generally when restrictiveness is marked [[syntax|syntactically]] through the lack of commas,{{Clarify me|date=April 2009}} restrictive modifiers are called ''integrated'' and non-restrictive ones are called ''non-integrated'' or ''supplementary''.

==Restrictiveness in English==
{{main|English relative clauses}}
English does not generally mark modifiers for restrictiveness, with the exception of [[relative clause]]s: non-restrictive ones are set off in speech through [[intonation (linguistics)|intonation]] (with a pause beforehand and {{dubious span|an uninterrupted melody|date=December 2017}}) and in writing by using commas, whereas restrictive clauses are not. Furthermore, although restrictive clauses can be headed by any of the [[relative pronoun]]s ''who(m)'', ''which'', ''that'' or by a [[English_relative_clauses#Zero_relative_pronoun|zero]], non-restrictive clauses can only be headed by ''who(m)'' or ''which''. For example:

*Restrictive: ''We saw two puppies this morning: one that was born yesterday and one that was born last week. The one '''that ('''''or'' '''which{{efn|In formal [[American English]], the use of ''which'' as a restrictive pronoun is often considered to be incorrect. See [[English relative clauses#That or which|That or which]].}}) was born yesterday''' is tiny.''
*Non-restrictive: ''We saw a puppy and a kitty this morning. The puppy, '''which was born yesterday''', was tiny.''

Although English does not consistently mark ordinary [[adjective]]s for restrictiveness, they can be marked [[periphrasis|periphrastically]] by moving them into relative clauses. For example, "John's beautiful wife" can be rewritten as "John's wife, who is beautiful", to avoid the suggestion of disambiguation between John's various wives.  A sentence unmarked for restrictiveness, like "The red car is fancier than the blue one," can—if necessary—be rephrased to make it explicitly restrictive or non-restrictive: 
*Restrictive: ''The car that's red is fancier than the one that's blue.''
*Non-restrictive: ''The car, which is red, is fancier than the other, which is blue.''

English speakers do not generally find such locutions necessary, however.

[[Image:Pigrunt.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Litters of piglets often include a runt]]
In a group of animals (usually a [[Litter (animal)|litter]] of animals born in multiple births), a '''runt''' is a member which is smaller or weaker than the others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?runt | title = Cancer | contribution = Runt | publisher = NCL | place = UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to its small size, a runt in a litter faces obvious disadvantage, including difficulties in competing with its siblings for survival and possible rejection by its mother.  Therefore, in the wild, a runt is less likely to survive [[infancy]].

Even among [[domestic animals]], runts often face rejection. They may be placed under the direct care of an experienced animal breeder, although the animal's size and weakness coupled with the lack of natural parental care make this difficult. Some tamed animals are the result of reared runts.

==In popular culture==
===Runts===
* [[Wilbur (Charlotte's Web)|Wilbur]], the pig from ''[[Charlotte's Web]]'', is the runt of his litter.
* Orson, the pig in Jim Davis' [[U.S. Acres|''U.S. Acres'']] is a runt who was bullied by his normal siblings. The strip changed direction when he was moved to a different farm and settled in with a supporting cast of oddball animals.
* Shade the bat from ''[[Silverwing (novel)|Silverwing]]'' is a runt.
* Fiver from ''[[Watership Down]]'' is a runt.
* [[Clifford the Big Red Dog]] was born a runt, but inexplicably began to grow explosively until he became 25 feet tall. The narratives of many Clifford stories work on the advantages and disadvantages of his colossal size.
* [[Goliath II]], in the Disney film of the same name,  was a runt elephant. Hardly bigger than a mouse, he was an embarrassment to his father, Goliath I, who was a giant, and resented by the other elephants of the pack who had to avoid stepping on him. He redeemed himself when he proved to be unafraid of a mouse.
*[[Ruth (dragon)|Ruth]], the hero [[Dragons (Pern)|Pernese dragon]]net from [[Anne McCaffrey]]'s novel [[the White Dragon (novel)|''The White Dragon'']], is a runt whose egg is smaller and has a harder shell than all others in the clutch. He would have died save for the intervention of young [[Jaxom]].
* [[Jock of the Bushveld|Jock]] was the runt of a litter of Staffordshire Bull Terriers who was saved from drowning by [[Sir Percy Fitzpatrick]], who later wrote about his life with the dog in [[Jock of the Bushveld]].
* [[Cadpig]], a female Dalmatian puppy in Dodie Smith's children's novel ''[[The Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'', is the runt of her litter.  Thought at first to be [[stillbirth|stillborn]], she is revived by Mr. Dearly. (In the [[One Hundred and One Dalmatians|animated Disney film]], the scene where she is revived is kept, but she is otherwise unnamed. And in the [[101 Dalmatians (1996 film)|live-action Disney film]], Cadpig is still a female aptly named "Two-Tone". [[101 Dalmatians: The Series|The animated television series]], however, does include Cadpig, though she is a separate character from Lucky.
* [[The Sheep-Pig|Babe]], the eponymous piglet hero of [[Dick King-Smith]]'s book (and the popular [[Babe (film)|film]] based on the novel), is a runt.  In fact, he was chosen for the competition at which Farmer Hoggett won him essentially ''because'' he was a runt - his runt status therefore saving his life and shaping his destiny.
* Scourge from the ''[[Warriors (novel series)|Warriors]]'' book series was a runt. 
* The title character from the novel ''[[Runt (novel)|Runt]]'', as the name implies, is the smallest of his wolf litter.
*The [[dire wolf]] Ghost in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' book series was the runt of his litter of six pups, as well as an [[albino]]. He later grows to become the biggest of the six.
*[[Seabiscuit]], a famous race horse, was a runt who triumphed over larger horses.  Seabiscuit's story is chronicled in an eponymous book, and a movie based on that book.
*Little Ann from ''[[Where The Red Fern Grows]]'' was the runt of her litter as well.
* Runt, an omega wolf from ''[[Alpha and Omega (film)|Alpha and Omega]]'' series, is a runt among his pack and family.
*Daggie Dogfoot from [[Pigs Might Fly]] by [[Dick King-Smith|Dick King Smith]] was the runt of his litter, and it was because he was born a runt he was taken away and came back. He later learns to swim and then saves his pig herd from a flood.
*Patchi, the main character from [[Walking with Dinosaurs (film)]], is the runt of his pachyrhinosaurs litter.
*Arlo, the main character from ''[[The Good Dinosaur]]'', is the runt of his siblings, but born from a big egg.
*Rex, the title character of ''[[Rex the Runt]]'', is a runt
*Chief. the main character from [[Wes Anderson|Wes Anderson's]] "[[Isle of Dogs (film)|Isle of Dogs]]" is the runt of his litter.
*[[List of BoJack Horseman characters|Mr. Peanutbutter]], one of the main characters from [[BoJack Horseman|Bojack Horseman]], is one of the runts from his litter. Captain Peanutbutter tells Mr. Peanutbutter that he is his favourite runt of the litter.

===Runt as a name===
* An early career moniker (ca. 1970) for [[Todd Rundgren]], his band, and the title of his/their eponymously named first album, all three.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8965">'''Saul Berlin''' (also '''Saul Hirschel''' after his father; 1740 at [[Glogau]] &amp;ndash; November 16, 1794 in [[London]]) was a [[German people|German]] [[Jewish]] scholar who published a number of works in opposition to rabbinic [[Judaism]].

==Early life==
He received his general education principally from his father, [[Hirschel Levin]], who had served as rabbi of the [[Great Synagogue of London]] and as chief rabbi of [[Berlin]]. Saul, the eldest son, was given an education in both the [[Talmud]] and secular subjects. His brother, [[Solomon Hirschell]], eventually became Chief Rabbi of [[Great Britain]].

Saul Berlin was ordained as a rabbi at 20. By 1768, aged 28, he had a rabbinic post in [[Frankfort-on-the-Oder]] in the Prussian province of [[Brandenburg]]. He married Sarah, the daughter of Rabbi Joseph Jonas Fraenkel of [[Breslau]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oztorah.com/2010/06/saul-berlin-1740-1794-heretical-rabbi/&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Berlin]] and [[Breslau]] (where he frequently went to visit his father-in-law, R. Joseph Jonas Fränkel), he came into personal contact with the representatives of the [[Jewish Enlightenment]], and became one of its most enthusiastic adherents.

==Career==
Berlin began his literary career with an anonymous circular letter, "Ketav Yosher" (An Epistle of Justice) (printed in Berlin, 1794, after the death of the author), which [[Hartwig Wessely]] warmly defended in his own contention with the rabbis while pleading for German education among the Jews. Berlin used humor to describe what he viewed as the absurd methods of the Jewish schools, and alleges how the rabbinic [[casuistry]]—which then constituted the greater part of the curriculum—injures the sound common sense of the pupils and deadens their noblest aspirations. 

He later wrote the pseudonymous work, "Mitzpeh Yekutiel" (The Watch-Tower of Yekutiel) (published by [[David Friedländer]] and his brother-in-law Itzig, Berlin, 1789), a polemic against the "Torat Yekutiel" of [[Raphael Kohen]]. The latter, one of the most zealous advocates of rabbinic piety, was a rival candidate with Levin for the Berlin rabbinate, which induced Levin's son to represent ha-Kohen as a forbidding example of rabbinism. 

Under the name "Ovadiah b. Baruch of Poland," Berlin attempted in this work to ridicule Talmudic science, and to stigmatize one of its foremost exponents not only as ignorant, but also as dishonest. The publishers declared in the preface that they had received the work from a traveling Polish Talmudist, and had considered it their duty to print it and submit it to the judgment of specialists. To secure the anonymity more thoroughly, Berlin and his father were named among those who were to pass upon it.&lt;ref&gt;http://seforim.blogspot.com/2010/04/benefits-of-internet-besamim-rosh-and.html
&lt;/ref&gt;
Berlin's statements, especially his personal attacks against those he disagreed with, undermined his cause. When it reached [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] and [[Hamburg]], where Raphael was chief rabbi, the work and its author was placed under the ban. The dispute that then arose concerning the validity of the ban turned entirely on the question of whether a personal element, like the attack upon the rabbi of Altona, justified such a punishment.

Some Polish rabbis supported the ban, while some declared the ban invalid as did [[Ezekiel Landau]], chief rabbi of [[Prague]] and a near relation of Berlin. Even the former censured Berlin's actions after circumstances forced him to acknowledge authorship.&lt;ref&gt;http://seforim.blogspot.com/2010/04/benefits-of-internet-besamim-rosh-and.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Besamim Rosh.jpg|thumb|210px|Besamim Rosh, Berlin 1793]]
Before the excitement over this affair had subsided, Berlin created a new sensation by another work. In 1793 he published in Berlin, under the title "Besamim Rosh" (Incense of Spices), 392 responsa purporting to be by [[Asher ben Jehiel]], with many glosses and comments that he called "Kassa de-Harsna" (Fish Fare). Berlin says, for instance, ( in No. 257) that an insight into the principles of the [[Torah]] and its commands can not be gained directly from it or from tradition, but only by means of the philosophico-logical training derived from non-Jewish sources. However, Asher ben Jehiel had condemned the study of philosophy and even of the natural sciences as being un-Jewish and pernicious (compare No. 58 of Asher's genuine responsa). Besamim Rosh ascribes the following opinions are ascribed to the neo-Talmudists of the thirteenth century: "Articles of faith [creed] must be adapted to the times; and at present the most essential article is that we all are utterly worthless and depraved, and that our only duty consists in loving truth and peace and learning to know God and His works" (l.c.). R. Asher is also alleged to be the author of the two responsa concerning the modification of the ceremonial laws, especially of such as were burdensome to the Berlin youth.{{clarify|date=October 2011}} Thus, for instance, it should be permitted to shave (No. 18), to drink non-kosher wine, "yayin nesek" (No. 36), and to ride on ''[[Shabbat]]''. Berlin aroused a storm of indignation by thus fraudulently using the name of one of the most famous rabbis of the [[Middle Ages]] to combat rabbinism. &lt;ref&gt;http://seforim.blogspot.com/2005/10/besamim-rosh.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mordecai Benet]] first attempted to prevent the printing of the book in [[Austria]], and then argued  deception in a circular letter addressed to Berlin's father, by critically analyzing the responsa and arguing that they were spurious. Levin tried in vain to defend his son. Berlin resigned his rabbinate and, to end the dispute, went to London where he died a few months later. In a letter found in his pocket, he warned everybody against looking into his papers, requesting that they be sent to his father. He expressed the wish to be buried not in a cemetery, but in some lonely spot, and in the same garments in which he died. The exact historicity of Besamin Rosh is still disputed, with it being unclear which parts are forgeries.&lt;ref&gt;http://seforim.blogspot.com/2010/04/benefits-of-internet-besamim-rosh-and.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Character==
To understand this unique personality, note that, as a modern historian remarks{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}, that Berlin was a focal point for the rays of a sinking and rising period in [[Jewish history]]. Being a great Talmudist, he knew better how to attack [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinism]], and was filled with a burning desire to lead his people toward intellectual freedom. Mendelssohn's and Wessely's timid attempts to inaugurate a new era did not appeal to him. With his youthful ardor he could not understand that the development of the popular consciousness is a slow process. An open championship of his ideas, however, would have meant a breach with father, wife, and children—in short, with all his associates; it being after all doubtful whether his sacrifices would have helped his cause. His anonymous and pseudonymous authorship was a measure of policy and not of cowardice. He could not, however, escape the consequences of such a mode of warfare. It is debasing and embittering to attack secretly those whom one is forced to praise in public. Hence Berlin became personal in his polemics, and nervous and dissatisfied with himself and the world because he knew he was misunderstood through his own fault{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}.

Besides the works mentioned above, Berlin is said to have written a large number of rabbinic works, including notes to the whole Talmud{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}.

'''Thai Sign Language''' ('''TSL''') or '''Modern Standard Thai Sign Language''' ('''MSTSL'''), is the national [[sign language]] of [[Thailand]]'s [[deaf community]] and is used in most parts of the country by the 20 percent of the estimated 56,000 pre-linguistically deaf people who go to school.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Charles &amp; Suvannus, Sathaporn (1999). ''Education of deaf people in the kingdom of Thailand.'' In Brelje, H.William (ed.) (1999). ''Global perspectives on education of the deaf in selected countries''. Hillsboro, OR: Butte. pp. 367–82. NB. This is a prevalence estimate 1/1000 people as deaf. Based on 2007 figures of Thailand's population, an estimate of 67,000 deaf people is more accurate.{{CN|date=March 2017}} Furthermore, hearing-speaking people are beginning to learn and use the Thai Sign Language.&lt;/ref&gt; Thai Sign Language was acknowledged as "the national language of deaf people in Thailand" in August 1999, in a resolution signed by the Minister of Education on behalf of the Royal Thai Government. As with many sign languages, the means of transmission to children occurs within families with signing deaf parents and in schools for the deaf. A robust process of language teaching and acculturation among deaf children has been documented and photographed in the Thai residential schools for the deaf.&lt;ref&gt;Reilly, Charles and Reilly, Nipapon (2005). ''The Rising of Lotus Flowers: The Self-Education of Deaf Children in Thai Boarding Schools''. Washington, D.C.: Gallaudet University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thai Sign Language is related to [[American Sign Language]] (ASL), and belongs to the same [[language family]] as ASL.&lt;ref name="Woodward_1996"&gt;Woodward, James C. (1996). ''Modern Standard Thai Sign Language, influence from ASL, and its relationship to original Thai sign varieties.'' ''Sign Language Studies'' 92:227–52. (see p 245)&lt;/ref&gt; This relatedness is due to [[language contact]] and [[creole language|creolisation]] that has occurred between ASL, which was introduced into [[Deaf education|deaf schools]] in Thailand in the 1950s by  American-trained Thai educators&lt;ref&gt;Suvannus, Sathaporn (1987). ''Thailand.'' In Van Cleve, 282–84. In: Van Cleve, John V. (1987) (ed.) ''Gallaudet encyclopedia of deafness and deaf people''. Washington, DC: Gallaudet University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and at least two indigenous sign languages that were in use at the time: [[Old Bangkok Sign Language]] and [[Chiangmai Sign Language]].&lt;ref name="Woodward_1996"/&gt; These original sign languages probably developed in market towns and urban areas where deaf people had opportunities to meet. They are now considered [[moribund language]]s, remembered by older signers but no longer used for daily conversation.&lt;ref&gt;Woodward (1997). ''Sign languages and deaf identities in Thailand and Vietnam.'' Presented at the annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association, Washington, DC, November.&lt;/ref&gt; These older varieties may be related to the [[Vietnamese sign languages|sign languages of Vietnam]] and [[Laos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=csd Ethnologue report on Chiang Mai Sign Language].

There are other moribund sign languages in the country such as [[Ban Khor Sign Language]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3363">In theatre, '''''les trois coups''''' (the three blows) are hit on the floor of the stage with a stick called ''brigadier'', just before the start of a performance, in order to attract public attention for the rise of [[Front curtain|the curtain]].

This tradition, especially in France, may come from the Middle Ages, where three blows, symbolizing the [[Trinity]], ended the [[Mystery play|mystery]]. These three blows could be preceded by eleven hammered ones (the twelve Apostles minus [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]]). They may also be a tribute to the nine muses of ancient Greece. Hence, there would be nine rapid blows plus the "trois coups", thus twelve blows. Twelve, being a perfect number in its symbolism, symbolized the unity of theatre.

Another explanation matches the three blows with the three bows that comedians performed before playing in front of the Court: the first one to the contender ({{Interlanguage link multi|Côté cour et côté jardin|fr|3=Côté cour et côté jardin|lt=côté jardin}}, left), the second one to the machinist ({{lang|fr|côté cour}}, right), and the third to the audience.

In [[Theatre of France#17th-century classicism|French classical theatre]], the [[dramaturge]] pounded the ground with twelve quick blows to announce to the machinists the start of the performance. Then a first blow came in response from the [[fly system]] operators; a second response rose from below the stage and a third one came from the opposite wing. Each machinist being in their position for the performance, the dramaturge could open the curtain.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Gousset, technical director of the [[Royal Opera of Versailles]], in ''Secrets d'histoire : Marie-Antoinette intime…'', Société européenne de production, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The military rank of ''brigadier'' was given to a worker leading a team. The [[dramaturge]], using a stick to hit the three blows, gathered the theatre staff to begin the show, like a [[brigadier]] gathering his men. Through [[metonymy]], the stick itself was called a "brigadier".

The theatre brigadier is traditionally made of wood with a piece of theatre pole{{definition needed|date=August 2016}}, decorated with red velvet and gold studded nails.

For years the [[Comédie-Française]] would hit six blows in order to commemorate the uniting of the two troupes, that of the [[Hôtel de Bourgogne (theatre)|Hôtel de Bourgogne]] and [[Molière's company]], previously associated with that of the [[Théâtre du Marais]] under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], allowing for daily performances.
