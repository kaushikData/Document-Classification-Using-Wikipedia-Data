{{stack|[[File:Ghana Regions map.png|thumb|right|203px|Geographic [[Plain|terrestrial plains]] of Ghana]]}}

The '''administrative divisions of''' the Republic of '''[[Ghana]]''' consist of four geographic [[Plain|terrestrial plains]] and ten [[Regions of Ghana|regions]]. For local government, there are a total of 212 [[Districts of Ghana|districts]] including 151 ordinary districts, 55 municipal districts, and six metropolitan districts.

Various types of councils exist below the district level including 58 town or area councils, 108 zonal councils, and 626 area councils. At a smaller level of local administration, there are over 16,000 unit committees.

Electorally, Ghana is divided into 275 constituencies.

The '''Australasian realm''' is a [[biogeographic realm]] that is coincident, but not synonymous (by some definitions), with the [[geography|geographical region]] of [[Australasia]]. The realm includes [[Australia]], the island of [[New Guinea]] (including [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Indonesia]]n province of [[Papua (province)|Papua]]), and the eastern part of the Indonesian archipelago, including the island of [[Sulawesi]], the Moluccan islands (the Indonesian provinces of [[Maluku (province)|Maluku]] and [[North Maluku]]) and islands of [[Lombok]], [[Sumbawa]], [[Sumba]], [[Flores]], and [[Timor]], often known as the Lesser Sundas.  The Australasian realm also includes several Pacific island groups, including the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Vanuatu]], the [[Solomon Islands]], and [[New Caledonia]]. [[New Zealand]] and its surrounding islands are a distinctive sub-region of the Australasian realm.  The rest of Indonesia is part of the [[Indomalayan realm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007180042/http://worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial_aa.html|title=Australasia ecozone|publisher=World Wildlife Fund|archivedate=2006-10-07|url=http://worldwildlife.org/wildworld/profiles/terrestrial_aa.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From an [[ecology|ecological]] perspective the Australasian realm is a distinct region with a common geologic and evolutionary history and a great many unique [[plant]]s and [[animal]]s. In this context, Australasia is limited to Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, [[New Caledonia]], and neighbouring islands, including the [[Indonesia]]n islands from [[Lombok]] and [[Sulawesi]] eastward. The biological dividing line from the Indomalayan realm of tropical [[Asia]] is the [[Wallace Line]]: [[Borneo]] and [[Bali]] lie on the western, Asian side.

Australia, New Zealand and New Caledonia are all fragments of the ancient supercontinent [[Gondwana]], the marks of which are still visible in the [[Christmas Island Seamount Province]] and other geophysical entities. These three land masses have been separated from other continents, and from one another, for tens millions of years. All of Australasia shares the [[Antarctic flora]], although the northern, tropical islands also share many plants with Southeast Asia.

Australia, New Guinea, and Tasmania are separated from one another by shallow [[continental shelf|continental shelves]], and were linked together when the sea level was lower during [[ice age]]s. They share a similar fauna which includes [[marsupial]] and [[monotreme]] mammals and [[ratite]] birds. [[Eucalypt]]s are the predominant trees in much of Australia and New Guinea. New Zealand has no native land mammals, but also had ratite birds, including the [[kiwi]] and the [[moa]]. The Australasian realm includes some nearby island groups, like [[Wallacea]], the [[Bismarck Archipelago]], [[Solomon Islands]], and [[Vanuatu]], which were not formerly part of Gondwana, but which share many characteristic plants and animals with Australasia.

Note that this zonation is based on flora; [[animal]]s do not necessarily follow the same [[Biogeography|biogeographic]] boundaries. In the present case, many [[bird]]s occur in both "Indomalayan" and "Australasian" regions, but not across the whole of either. On the other hand, there are few faunistic commonalities shared only by Australia and New Zealand, except some birds. Meanwhile, Australia, Melanesia and the Wallacea are united by a large share of similar animals, but few of these occur farther into the Pacific. On the other hand, much of the [[Polynesia]]n fauna is related to that of Melanesia.

'''Base-cation saturation ratio''' (BCSR) is a method of interpreting [[soil test]] results that is widely used in [[sustainable agriculture]], supported by the National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service (ATTRA)&lt;ref name="ll"&gt;[http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/soilmgmt.htm NCat Soil Management]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed to be successfully in use on over a million acres (4,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of farmland worldwide. The traditional method, as used by most university laboratories,&lt;ref name="z"&gt;McLean, E.O. 1977.  Contrasting concepts in soil test interpretation: Sufficiency levels of available nutrients versus basic cation saturation ratios. p. 39–54. In T.R. Peck et al. (ed.) Soil testing: Correlating and interpreting the analytical results. ASA Spec. Publ. 29. ASA, CSSA, and SSSA, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt; is known variously as the 'sufficiency level', sufficiency level of available nutrients (SLAN), or Index(UK) system. The sufficiency level system is concerned only with keeping plant-available nutrient levels within a well studied range, making sure there is neither a deficiency nor an excess. In the BCSR system, soil [[ion|cations]] are balanced according to varying ratios often stated as giving 'ideal' or 'balanced' soil. These ratios can be between individual cations, such as the calcium to magnesium ratio, or they may be expressed as a percentage saturation of the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of the soil. Most 'ideal soil' theories stress both approaches. (See also – [[Cation exchange capacity]])

Strictly speaking, the '[[Base (chemistry)|base]]' [[ion|cations]] are limited to [[Calcium in biology|calcium]], [[magnesium]], [[potassium]], and [[sodium]], and these are the primary nutrients that BCSR methods are most concerned with balancing. However, many proponents of 'ideal soil' theories also stress the importance of balancing the [[ion|anions]] phosphorus, sulphur and chlorine as well as numerous minor and trace elements. The conventional SLAN system does not generally test for minor and trace elements unless there is sufficient cause to suspect a deficiency or toxicity.

BCSR supporters argue that a soil balanced using their methods leads to greater crop yield and nutritional quality, as well as increasing the soil biological activity and the physical properties of tilth, aeration, and moisture retention. There is currently no publicly available research or trial data to support these claims,&lt;ref name="xx"&gt;[http://www.pda.org.uk/notes/tn16.php Assessing soil fertility; the importance of soil analysis and its interpretation – Johnny Johnston, Lawes Trust Senior Fellow, Rothamsted Research]&lt;/ref&gt; but BCSR systems are fairly widely used in organic farms and many positive testimonials from farmers and gardeners can be found on the internet and in alternative agriculture literature. Under most circumstances following BCSR systems will not lead to negative effects. The main concern for farmers is simply the unnecessary expense of applying soil amendments beyond what the crop can actually utilise.

==History of BCSR methods==
The cation exchange principle was discovered by [[Thomas Way]] and [[John Bennet Lawes]] at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] in the 19th century. In 1892 [[Oscar Loew]] observed that both calcium and magnesium can be toxic to plants when there is an excess of one and a deficiency of the other, thus suggesting there may be an optimal Ca:Mg ratio.&lt;ref name="uu"&gt;Loew, O. 1892. Uber die physiolgischen funkton der kalzium- und magnesia-salze in planzen organisms.   Flora 75:368–394.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Soil Science"&gt;[https://www.soils.org/publications/sssaj/articles/71/2/259 Soil Science Society of America Journal – Article – A Review of the Use of the Basic Cation Saturation Ratio and the “Ideal” Soil Peter M. Kopittke * and Neal W. Menzies. Research before Circa 1930s]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901 Oscar Loew and D.W. May did further testing and suggested an ideal Ca:Mg ratio of 5 to 4, though for several species maximum growth was obtained across a wide range of ratios. In 1916 Lipman reviewed the literature up to that point and concluded that while some researchers seemed to have identified 'optimal' Ca:Mg ratios for certain species, there was no evidence that the Ca:Mg ratio influenced growth.

Later, in 1933, Moser also reviewed the literature and performed his own experiments, coming to the same conclusion as Lipman that there was no evidence for the Ca:Mg ratio influencing yield. He found that in high magnesium soils, low yields were due to a calcium deficiency, rather than an imbalance. This meant that liming would increase yield, but only up to the point where the deficiency was corrected.

From the late 1930s, [[William Albrecht]], the Chairman of the Department of Soils at the University of Missouri, began work at the Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station investigating cation ratios and the growth of legumes. Albrecht had been investigating cattle nutrition, having observed that certain pastures seemed conducive to good health, and at some point he came to the conclusion that the ideal balance of cations in the soil was "H, 10%; Ca, 60 to 75%; Mg, 10 to 20%; K, 2 to 5%; Na, 0.5 to 5.0%; and other cations, 5%".&lt;ref name="r"&gt;Albrecht, W.A. 1975.  The Albrecht papers. Vol. 1: Foundation concepts. Acres USA, Kansas City.&lt;/ref&gt; At his death he left his papers to his friend Charles Walters who promoted the ideas by founding the magazine AcresUSA, which continues to be at the centre of the ideal soil movement.

While Albrecht was a highly respected soil scientist,&lt;ref name="xx"/&gt;&lt;ref name="b"&gt;[https://www.agronomy.org/publications/sssaj/articles/71/2/259 A review of the use of the basic cation saturation ratio and the ideal soil – PMM Kopittke, W Neal]&lt;/ref&gt; he discounted soil pH, stating that "plants are not sensitive to, or limited by, a particular pH value of the soil." Instead, he believed that the benefits of liming soil stem from the additional calcium available to the plant, not the increase in pH. This belief has continued to be held by followers to this day, despite much evidence to the contrary.&lt;ref name="h"&gt;Bruce, R.C., Warrell, Edwards and Bell. 1988.

Res. 39:319–338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="f"&gt;Alva, A.K., Edwards, Asher and Suthipradit. 1987. Effects of acid soil infertility factors on growth and nodulation of soybean. Agron.

Soil acidity and liming. Agron. Monogr. 12. 2nd ed. ASA, CSSA, and SSSA, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="m"&gt;Liebhardt, W.C. 1981. The basic cation saturation ratio concept and lime and potassium recommendations on Delaware's Coastal Plain soils.   Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J. 45:544–549.&lt;/ref&gt; Like much of the early research into BCSR where soil pH was not controlled, it is difficult to draw solid conclusions from Albrecht's research in support of BCSR.

At around the same time as Albrecht was working in Missouri, F.E. Bear in New Jersey was investigating whether calcium amendments could be used to limit the excess uptake of potassium in alfalfa plants in order to reduce fertiliser costs. From these studies he issued a bulletin with Prince and Malcolm in 1945 that tentatively proposed an 'ideal soil' ratio where the proportions of exchangeable cations were 65% Ca, 10% Mg, 5% K and 20% H.&lt;ref name="u"&gt;Bear, F.E., Prince and Malcolm. 1945.  Potassium needs of New Jersey soils. Bull. 721. New Jersey Agric. Exp. Stn., New Brunswick&lt;/ref&gt; They confirmed their hypothesis with further experiments in 1948 (published with Toth).

Though the details are obscure, it has been suggested that Albrecht was aware of these ratios and that they influenced his own. If true, because of the wide influence of Albrecht, it could be argued that the whole 'ideal soil' theory was founded on a mistaken interpretation, since the Bear and Toth ratios were intended to address one specific problem, not to act as a panacea. They explicitly stated that maximum yield of alfalfa occurs at a wide range of cation ratios.

In 1959 E.R. Graham suggested a modification to Bear's ratios where calcium could range between 65% and 85% of the CEC.&lt;ref name="s"&gt;Graham, E.R. 1959.  An explanation of theory and methods of soil testing. Bull. 734. Missouri Agric. Exp. Stn., Columbia.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Bear and Graham came to these conclusions after analysing various soils and noting a correlation between the ratios of cations and the productivity of the soils. Though deduction of this sort is generally eschewed by modern sciences in favour of testing in a more controlled environment, it is considered a valid method in agronomy and ecology where the complexity of the natural environment makes reductive techniques less useful. However, neither Bear nor Graham appear to have tested their theories by varying the ratios and studying the effects.

In 1981, Baker and Amacher redefined the ideal ratio as 60–80% Ca,&lt;ref name="ss"&gt;Baker, D.E., and M.C. Amacher. 1981. The development and interpretation of a diagnostic soil-testing program. Pennsylvania&lt;/ref&gt; 10–20% Mg, 2–5% K. A decade later Neal Kinsey co-wrote a book with Charles Walters called "Hands on Agronomy" in which he defined the ideal ratios as 60–70% Ca, 10–20% Mg, 3–5% K, 1% Na, 10–15 H, 2–4% other cations. Kinsey's book has gone on to become the most widely known and influential work on the BCSR system.

Certain studies conducted in 2008-2011 raise doubts about the efficacy of BCSR.&lt;ref&gt;[https://dl.sciencesocieties.org/publications/jeq/abstracts/24/2/JEQ0240020209]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soils.wisc.edu/extension/wcmc/proc/2011_wcmc_proc.pdf#page=198]&lt;/ref&gt;

==BCSR and plant yield==
Toth, in a later experiment to investigate the 'ideal soil' ratios he had previously worked on with Bear, came to the conclusion that so long as calcium was the dominant cation, no specific cation ratio produced a better yield of ladino clover.&lt;ref name="q"&gt;Giddens, J. and Toth. 1951. Growth and nutrient uptake of ladino clover on red and yellow grey-brown podzolic soils&lt;/ref&gt; Even with Mg and K as high as 40%, far higher than the 'ideal' range, no difference in yield was obtained.

Similar conclusions have since been drawn by other studies showing no relation between yield and cation ratios, providing calcium is more abundant than magnesium.&lt;ref name="m"/&gt;&lt;ref name="p"&gt;McLean, E.O. and Carbonell. 1972. Calcium, magnesium, and potassium saturation ratios in two soils and their effects upon yield and nutrient contents of German millet and alfalfa.   Soil Sci. Soc. Am. Proc. 36:927–930.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soil Sci. 67:53–62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="n"&gt;Key, J.L., Kurtz and Tucker. 1962. Influence of ratio of exchangeable calcium–magnesium on yield and composition of soybeans and corn.   Soil Sci. 93:265–270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="l"&gt;Western Australian No-Tillage Farmers Association. 2005.  WANTFA Meckering R&amp;D Site Trial Results 2004. WANTFA, Perth, Western Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the investigations have mostly investigated Calcium ratios, studies looking at Potassium to Magnesium ratios also showed no differences in yield, providing there was not a deficiency or excess.&lt;ref name="rr"&gt;Rehm, G.W., and R.C. Sorensen. 1985. Effects of potassium and magnesium applied for corn grown on an irrigated sandy soil. Soil Sci. Soc. Amer. J. 49:1446–1450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="j"&gt;Ologunde, O.O. and Sorensen. 1982. Influence of concentrations of K and Mg in nutrient solutions on sorghum.   Agron. J. 74:41–46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="k"&gt;Bear, F.E., Prince, Toth and Purvis. 1951.  Magnesium in plants and soil. Bull. 760. New Jersey Agric. Exp. Stn., New Brunswick.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it seems that the earlier positive results of Bear and co-workers trials can be directly attributable to soil pH.

==BCSR and nutritional quality==
Perhaps the most controversial aspect of BCSR (and organic farming in general) relates to the practitioners' beliefs that a correctly balanced soil will yield more nutritious produce. Though some studies have shown a decrease in mineral content of fruit and vegetables over the last half century&lt;ref name="qq"&gt;Anne-Marie Mayer, (1997) "Historical changes in the mineral content of fruits and vegetables", British Food Journal, Vol. 99 Iss: 6, pp.207 – 211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pp"&gt;Davis DR, Epp MD, Riordan HD (2004) Changes in USDA food concentration data for 43 garden crops, 1950 to 1999. J Am Coll Nutr 23: 669–682&lt;/ref&gt; this is in dispute and the causes are uncertain.&lt;ref name="nn"&gt;[http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/soilmgmt.htm Lyne, J. and P. Barak (2000). Are depleted soils causing a reduction in mineral content of food crops? ASA/CSSA/SSSA Annual Meeting. Minneapolis, MN.]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been speculated that hybrid varieties bred for yield, uniformity, pest resistance, appearance, and shelf life over taste (a good indicator of nutritional quality) may be at fault rather than the soil. Aside from soil composition, other factors such as irrigation and sunlight exposure have also been theorised, but so far no conclusions can be drawn.

[[William Albrecht]] first theorised that crops grown on 'unbalanced' soils are of lower nutritional value, based on studying the habits of grazing cattle – noting in particular their avoidance of the lush grass that grew on dung patches. A study he conducted with G.E. Smith&lt;ref name="i"&gt;Smith, G.E. and Albrecht. 1942. Feed efficiency in terms of biological assays of soil treatments. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. Proc 7:322–330.&lt;/ref&gt; is cited by proponents of BCSR theory, but has been criticised for a variety of reasons,&lt;ref name="b"/&gt; chief of which being that the pH of the soil was not controlled, since Albrecht did not believe pH to be important. Thus, the increases in root nodulation of legumes (and subsequent increases in yield) that he associated with calcium levels were likely due to the increases in pH, which is known to free up Molybdenum, a micronutrient essential for root nodulation to occur. Legumes are an important source of protein in grazing animals, hence, other studies that show an increase in cattle health from calcium applications to pastures are likely due to the increase in pH and the subsequent increase in legume populations.

Another study worth mentioning for its prevalence in the alternative agriculture literature is that undertaken by Bear and Toth in 1948 investigating the mineral composition of fruit and vegetables on a range of different soils across the US.&lt;ref name="oo"&gt;Bear, F.E., S.J. Toth, and A.L. Prince. 1948. Variation in mineral composition of vegetables. Soil Sci. Soc. Am. Proc. 13:380–384.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, this old study remains so prevalent because of the dearth of literature comparing soil properties and crop nutritional value. The study suggests that soil composition effects mineral content of crops, but due to the large numbers of unexplored variables it is difficult to draw firm conclusions.

More recent studies that specifically set out to test the influence of cation ratios on nutrition are less encouraging. A three-year field study performed by Mark Schonbeck &lt;ref name="a"&gt;Schonbeck, M. 2000. Balancing soil nutrients in organic vegetable production systems: Testing Albrecht's base saturation theory in southeastern soils. Organic Farming Res. Found. Inf. Bull. 10:17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSc"&gt;[http://www.ibiblio.org/ecolandtech/SoilWiki/message-archives/composttea+soilfoodweb+soilquality/5/msg00161.html iBiblio, Notes on Mark Schoenbeck's review of on Albrecht cation ratios]&lt;/ref&gt; which was 'initially undertaken to validate the Albrecht formula in organic production' showed no variation in Brix (a controversial index of nutritional quality used by many in the ideal soil community) of the vegetables grown on soils of different cation ratios. However, Schonbeck admitted limitations in the data and called for further study. Additionally, in 2005, Stevens ''et al.''&lt;ref name="e"&gt;Stevens, G., Gladbach, Motavalli and Dunn. 2005. Soil calcium:magnesium ratios and lime recommendations for cotton. J.Cotton Sci. 9:65–71.&lt;/ref&gt; found no relationship between the quality of cotton and the Ca:Mg ratio, and in 1996 Kellings ''et al.'' came to the same conclusion regarding alfalfa quality and yield.&lt;ref name="d"&gt;Kelling, K.A., Schulte and Peters. 1996.  One hundred years of Ca:Mg ratio research. New Horiz. in Soil Ser. 8. Dep. of Soil Sci., Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;

==BCSR and the physical properties of the soil==
Liming heavy clay soils has long been used to improve their structure, but BCSR practitioners claim the reason it does so is the increase in the Ca:Mg ratio rather than an increase in pH. However, studies &lt;ref name="v"&gt;Moser, F. 1933. The calcium–magnesium ratio in soils and its relation to crop growth.   J. Am. Soc. Agron. 25:365–377.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="w"&gt;Lipman, C.B. 1916.  A critique of the hypothesis of the lime/magnesia ratio. Plant World 19:83–105, 119–133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ww"&gt;Eckert D.J., and E.O. McLean. 1981. – Basic cation saturation ratios as a basis for fertilizing and liming agronomic crops: I. Growth chamber studies. Agron. J. 73:795–799.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="www"&gt;Rengasamy, P., Greene and Ford. 1986. Influence of magnesium on aggregate stability in sodic red-brown earths.   Aust. J. Soil Res. 24:229–237.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that soil structure is maintained in a wide range of Ca:Mg ratios when pH is kept the same. Schonbeck's farm trials &lt;ref name="a"/&gt; found that a reduction in Mg saturation had no effect on compaction, moisture content, infiltration rate, or soil strength. In fact he found the two soils most 'unbalanced' according to the Albrecht formula were the two soils with the best physical structure.  A study of Midwest United States soils on the other hand concluded that high Mg "can cause increased surface sealing and erosion in Midwestern soils." &lt;ref name="wwww"&gt;Dontsova, K.M. and L.D. Norton. 2002. Clay dispersion, infiltration, and erosion as influenced by exchangeable Ca and Mg. Soil Sci. 167: 184–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==BCSR and soil biology==
BCSR followers have claimed that balanced soils increase soil biological activity and reduce weed growth and pest attack. The reduction of weeds and pests can be directly attributed to an increase in soil biological activity and subsequent crop health, hence the only factor to consider is whether BCSR can directly increase soil micro-organism diversity and activity.

While some bacteria have been observed metabolising raw elements directly in extreme circumstances, and [[mycorrhiza]]l fungi have been found to extract minerals from bedrock, the overwhelming majority of soil organisms subsist exclusively on organic matter. Hence, any changes in mineral balance in the soil are unlikely to affect soil organism populations beyond the effects expected by altering pH.

Studies have backed this up—Schonbeck&lt;ref name="a"/&gt; showed that a reduction of Mg saturation had no detectable effect on [[soil organic matter]], biological activity, weed growth, or incidence of disease. Kelling concluded that the Ca:Mg ratio had no significant effect on earthworm population or weed growth.&lt;ref name="d"/&gt;

Schonbeck concluded that: "Findings to date do not support the application of a single formula for optimum base saturation ratio to all soils."

==BCSR in practice==
There are claimed to be over a million acres (4,000&amp;nbsp;km²) of farmland worldwide using some kind of BCSR theory for balancing their soils, and the testimonies of farmers seem to back it up as a practical method. However, BCSR is almost always used by farmers transitioning to sustainable agriculture, hence the simultaneous use of other soil improvement methods (such as cover crops, reduced tillage, and addition of organic matter) makes it difficult to isolate the effects of the BCSR method. Many BCSR practitioners stress that the system cannot work when abstracted from a 'holistic' approach to farming. Though this complicates investigation, it does not invalidate the approach, since many other aspects of sustainable agriculture only work in concert with each other. For example, integrated pest management requires the use of polycultures, cover crops, reduction of pesticides and even agroforestry to a degree, and its efficacy will be greatly reduced if all these things are ignored.

The 2001 results of a 3-year field trial sponsored by the [[Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education]] (SARE) organisation &lt;ref name="mm"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pfi.iastate.edu/ofr/Fertility/SA13_Soil_Fertility_Management_Strategies.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611180236/http://www.pfi.iastate.edu/ofr/Fertility/SA13_Soil_Fertility_Management_Strategies.pdf# |archive-date=2010-06-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; are the only side by side comparison of BCSR vs SLAN performed by farmers using recommendations from laboratories that specialise in each method. The study found that on average the fertiliser costs were $9.27 per acre higher per year using the BCSR method, with no higher yield. They concluded that the BCSR method would not be more profitable, even when factoring in the price premiums for organic produce. They also admitted it could take decades of such fertilising to attain the 'optimal' levels of BCSR systems. Another study found BCSR costs to be double that of conventional fertilisation.&lt;ref name="x"&gt;Olson, R.A., Frank, Grabouski and Rehm. 1982. Economic and agronomic impacts of varied philosophies of soil testing. Agron. J. 74:492–499.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have also been raised that applying the BCSR methods to low CEC soils could lead to mineral deficiency because there are no minimum levels defined as meq/100g of soil. Hence, in very low CEC soils the amount of a certain element—though in correct proportion to others—may be too low for the needs of the crop. Another concern is that applications of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can lead to an overestimation of CEC.&lt;ref name="vv"&gt;St. John, R. A.; N.E. Christians, and H.G. Taber. 2003. Supplemental calcium applications to creeping bentgrass established on calcareous sand. Crop Sci. 43:967–972. (TGIF Record 86290)&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from these worries, the general consensus is that the only negative effects for farmers using BCSR will be the unnecessary expense which could have been better spent on other sustainable agricultural practices whose benefits are well studied.

==Conclusions==
Much of the research in favour of BCSR can be adequately explained by changes in pH. Liming soil is well known to improve microbial activity, soil structure, nitrogen fixation, and palatability of forages. It is also used to correct Ca and Mg deficiencies, change nutrient availability and reduce manganese and aluminium toxicity that can retard crop growth.&lt;ref name="kk"&gt;Liming to Improve Soil Quality – USDA – soils.usda.gov/sqi/management/files/sq_atn_8.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While fertiliser recommendations based on BCSR continue to be in widespread use by private soil testing laboratories, the evidence on balance suggests there is no benefit to crop yield or quality. Any perceived change is likely to be due to correction of deficiencies (which would have been picked up by the SLAN method) or the result of other beneficial soil practices used in conjunction, when transitioning to sustainable agriculture.

In his 2001 study on the Albrecht method, Schonbeck stated "A review of over 100 published studies and conversations with several soils consultants revealed evidence that proper cation balancing is inherently site specific. Most soils apparently do not need to conform to the Albrecht formula to be healthy and productive."

[[File:Claude Reignier Conder.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Claude Reignier Conder]]
'''Claude Reignier Conder''' (29 December 1848, [[Cheltenham]] – 16 February 1910, Cheltenham) was an English soldier, explorer and antiquarian.  He was a great-great-grandson of [[Louis-François Roubiliac]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Artists and their friends in England, 1700–1799, Volume 1 | author=William Thomas Whitley | publisher=The Medici society | year=1928 | page=93 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pollock23&gt;{{cite book | title=Kitchener: the road to Omdurman | author=John Charles Pollock | publisher=Constable | year=1998 | isbn=0-09-479140-6 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conder was educated at [[University College London]] and the [[Royal Military Academy, Woolwich]].  He became a [[lieutenant]] in the [[Corps of Royal Engineers]] in 1870.  He carried out [[Survey of Western Palestine|survey work]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in 1872–1874, latterly in conjunction with Lt Kitchener, later [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Revealing the Holy Land: the photographic exploration of Palestine | first=Kathleen |last=Stewart Howe | publisher=University of California Press | year=1997 | isbn=0-89951-095-7 | pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; whom he had met at school,&lt;ref name=pollock23/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;British Empire. [http://www.britishempire.co.uk/forces/armycampaigns/africancampaigns/boerwar/kitchener.htm  Kitchener]&lt;/ref&gt; and was seconded to the [[Palestine Exploration Fund]] from 1875 to 1878 and again in 1881 and 1882, when he was promoted captain.  He retired with the rank of colonel in 1904.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=CONDER, Claude Reignier|magazine=Who's Who|year=1907|volume= 59|page=371|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yEcuAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA371}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conder joined the [[1882 Anglo-Egyptian War|expedition to Egypt]] in 1882, under [[Garnet Wolseley, 1st Viscount Wolseley|Sir Garnet Wolseley]], to suppress the [[Urabi Revolt|rebellion]] of [[Ahmed ‘Urabi|Arabi Pasha]]. He was appointed a deputy assistant adjutant and quartermaster-general on the staff of the intelligence department. In Egypt his perfect knowledge of Arabic and of Eastern people proved most useful. He was present at the action of [[Kassassin]], the [[Battle of Tel el-Kebir]], and the advance to [[Cairo]], but then, seized with typhoid fever, he was invalided home. For his services he received the war medal with clasp for Tel el-Kebir, the [[Khedive]]'s bronze [[Khedive's Star|star]] and the fourth class of the [[Order of the Medjidie]].

While surveying the area of [[Safed]] in July 1875, Conder and his party were attacked by local residents, during which altercation Conder sustained a serious head injury which left him bed-ridden for a while and unable to return to Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Kitchener, [http://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/pefqs/1875_04_195.pdf An Account of the Safed Attack], ''Palestine Exploration Quarterly Statement'' 7.4 (Oct. 1875), pp. 195–199&lt;/ref&gt; The work of surveying the country of Palestine commenced again only in late February 1877, without Conder.&lt;ref&gt;H.H. Kitchener, [http://biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/pefqs/1878-04_159.pdf Survey of Galilee],''Palestine Exploration Quarterly Statement'' (1878), pp. 159–174.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Conder was first proposed as a  candidate for the [[Jack the Ripper]] murders by the author Tom Slemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Tom Slemen | chapter=Towards a Solution | title=Jack the Ripper, British Intelligence Agent | year=2010 | publisher=Bluecoat Press | isbn=978-1-904438-91-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See Davies (1911: p. xxix)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Columbus's letter on the first voyage''' is the first known document announcing the results of the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#First voyage|first voyage]] of [[Christopher Columbus]] that set out in 1492 and reached the [[Americas]]. The letter was ostensibly written by Columbus himself, on February 15, 1493, aboard the [[caravel]] ''[[Niña]]'', while still at sea, on the return leg of his voyage.&lt;ref name=ife&gt;Ife, Barry W. (1992) "Introduction to the Letters from America", King's College London. [http://www.ems.kcl.ac.uk/content/pub/b002.html]. Accessed February 12, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; A post-script was added upon his arrival in [[Lisbon]] on March 4, 1493, and it was probably from there that Columbus dispatched two copies of his letter to the Spanish court.

The letter was instrumental in spreading the news throughout Europe about Columbus's voyage. Almost immediately after Columbus's arrival in Spain, printed versions of the letter began to appear. A [[Spanish language|Spanish]] version of the letter (presumedly addressed to [[Luis de Santángel]]), was printed in [[Barcelona]] by early April 1493, and a [[Latin]] translation (addressed to [[Gabriel Sanchez]]) was published in [[Rome]] around a month later (c. May 1493). The Latin version was swiftly disseminated and reprinted in many other locations—[[Basel]], [[Paris]], [[Antwerp]], etc.—still within the first year of his arrival.

In his letter, Christopher Columbus claims to have discovered and taken possession of a series of islands on the edge of the [[Indian Ocean]] in Asia. He described the islands, particularly [[Hispaniola]] and [[Cuba]], exaggerating their size and wealth, and suggested that mainland [[China]] probably lay nearby. He also gave a brief description of the native [[Arawaks]] (whom he called "[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]]"), emphasizing their docility and amenability, and the prospects of their mass conversion to Catholic Christianity. However, the letter also revealed local rumors about a fierce [[cannibalism|man-eating]] tribe of "monsters" in the area (probably [[Island Caribs|Caribs]]), although Columbus himself disbelieved the stories, and dismissed them as myth. The letter provides very few details of the oceanic voyage itself, and covers up the loss of the flagship of his fleet, the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]'', by suggesting Columbus left it behind with some colonists, in a fort he erected at [[La Navidad]] in Hispaniola. In the letter, Columbus urges the [[Catholic monarchs]] to sponsor a second, larger expedition to the Indies, promising to bring back immense riches.

A slightly different version of Columbus's letter, in manuscript form, addressed to the Catholic monarchs of Spain, was found in 1985, part of the ''Libro Copiador'' collection, and has led to some revision of the history of the Columbus letter.&lt;ref&gt;Zamora (1993); Henige (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Columbus first voyage.jpg|thumb|270px|right|Route of Columbus's first voyage]]
[[Christopher Columbus]], a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] captain in the service of the [[Crown of Castile]], set out on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#First voyage|first voyage]] in August 1492 with the objective of reaching the [[East Indies]] by sailing west across the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. As is well known, instead of reaching Asia, Columbus stumbled upon the [[Caribbean]] islands of the [[Americas]]. Convinced nonetheless he had discovered the edges of Asia, Columbus set sail back to Spain on January 15, 1493, aboard the caravel ''[[Niña]]''. According to the journal of his voyage, on February 14, Columbus was caught in a storm off the [[Azores]] islands. The resulting poor condition of his ship forced him to put in at [[Lisbon]] ([[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]) on March 4, 1493. Columbus finally arrived at [[Palos de la Frontera]] in Spain eleven days later, on March 15, 1493.&lt;ref&gt;See Columbus's journal (Markham ed., 1893: [https://books.google.com/books?id=2mvK60VAdCcC&amp;pg=PA178#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 178], 187–88, 192)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the return journey, while aboard the ship, Columbus wrote a letter reporting the results of his voyage and announcing his discovery of the "islands of the Indies". In a postscript added while he was idling in Lisbon, Columbus reports sending at least two copies of the letter to the Spanish court—one copy to the [[Catholic monarchs]] [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]], and a second copy to the Aragonese official [[Luis de Santángel]], the principal supporter and financial backer of Columbus's expedition.

Copies of Columbus's letter were somehow picked up by publishers, and printed editions of his letter began to appear throughout Europe within weeks of Columbus's return to Spain.&lt;ref name=edney&gt;Matthew Edney (1996, rev. 2009), "The Columbus Letter: The Diffusion of Columbus's Letter through Europe, 1493–1497" [http://www.oshermaps.org/special-map-exhibits/columbus-letter/iv-diffusion-columbuss-letter-through-europe-1493-1497 online] at the University of Southern Maine (accessed Jan 9, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Spanish language|Spanish]] version of the letter (based on the letter he sent to Luis de Santángel) was printed in [[Barcelona]] probably in late March or early April 1493. A [[Latin]] translation of the letter (addressed to Gabriel Sanchez) was printed in [[Rome]] about a month later. Within the first year of his arrival, eight more editions of the Latin version were printed in various European cities—two in [[Basel]], three in [[Paris]], another two in [[Rome]] and another in [[Antwerp]]. Already by June 1493, the letter had been translated by a poet into [[Italian language|Italian]] verse, and that version went through multiple editions in the next couple of years. A [[German language|German]] translation appeared in 1497. The rapid dissemination of Columbus's letter was enabled by the [[printing press]], a new invention that had [[global spread of the printing press|established itself]] only recently.

Columbus's letter (particularly the Latin edition) forged the initial public perception of the newly discovered lands. Indeed, until the discovery of Columbus's on-board journal, first published in the 19th century, this letter was the only known direct testimony by Columbus of his experiences on the first voyage of 1492.&lt;ref&gt;Henige (1994: pp. 141–42). An intact version of Columbus's on-board journal, "Diario de bordo", has yet to be found. All that is available is a heavily edited and abridged version of the journal reproduced by [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] in his ''Historia de las Indias''. Although written in the 16th century, Las Casas's manuscript was only discovered in the 1790s and published only in 1875–76. For a reproduction with English translation, see Dunn and Kelley (1989).&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that, on the whole, between 1493 and 1500, some 3,000 copies of the Columbus letter were published, half of them in Italy, making it something of a best-seller for the times.&lt;ref&gt;Clough (1994: [https://www.google.com/books?id=Dg-8ZOeBqcYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA299#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 299])&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, Columbus's 1495 letter of his second voyage and his 1505 letter of his fourth voyage had only one printing each, probably not exceeding 200 copies.

Original versions of Columbus's letter, written by his hand, have never been found. Only the printed editions—Spanish and Latin—are known. However, a third version of the letter, contained in a 16th-century manuscript collection known as the ''Libro Copiador'', was discovered in 1985. This manuscript version differs in several significant ways from the printed editions and, although its authenticity is still tentative, many believe the ''Copiador'' version to be a closer rendition of Columbus's original missive.

== Content of the letter ==
[[File:Landing of Columbus (2).jpg|thumb|250px|Columbus takes possession of the islands of the Indies, "with flags flying and no one objecting"]]
The published Latin versions of the letter are almost all titled "Letter of Columbus, on the islands of India beyond the [[Ganges]] recently discovered". The term "India beyond the Ganges" (''India extra Gangem'') was the archaic term frequently used by earlier geographers (e.g., [[Ptolemy]]) to refer vaguely to [[Southeast Asia]] (roughly from Burma down to the Malay peninsula); the [[Indian subcontinent]] proper was referred to as "India within the Ganges" (''India intra Gangem'').&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell's ''Ancient Geography'' (1868: [https://books.google.com/books?id=7HoZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA55#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 55])&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the islands of "India beyond the Ganges" claimed to have been reached would roughly correspond to modern [[List of islands of Indonesia|Indonesia]] or thereabouts. The earlier printed Spanish edition bears no title, nor does the manuscript copy of the letter to the Catholic monarchs (''Libro Copiador'').&lt;ref&gt;The following account relies on the available online facsimile and transcriptions listed at the bottom of the article.

In the letter, Christopher Columbus does not describe the journey itself, saying only that he traveled thirty-three days and arrived at the islands of "the Indies" (''las Indias''), "all of which I took possession for our Highnesses, with proclaiming heralds and flying royal standards, and no one objecting". He describes the islands as being inhabited by "Indians" (''Indios'').

In the printed letters, Columbus relates how he bestowed new names on six of the islands. Four are in the modern [[Bahamas]]: (1) ''Sant Salvador'' (for which he also gives the local name, ''Guanaham'' in the Spanish edition and ''Guanahanin'' in the Latin letter; modern English texts normally render it as ''[[Guanahani]]''), (2) ''Santa Maria de Concepcion'', (3) ''Ferrandina'' (''Fernandinam'' in the Latin version, in modern texts ''Fernandina''), and (4) ''la isla Bella'' (given as ''Hysabellam'' in the Latin version, and ''La Isabela'' in modern texts).&lt;ref&gt;Compare [https://books.google.com/books?id=NPXCTYxu-R4C&amp;pg=PR15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.xv] of the facsimile of the Barcelona edition of the Spanish letter; and [https://books.google.com/books?id=9s0tAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.ix] of the second Roman edition of the Latin letter.&lt;/ref&gt; He also names (5) ''La Isla Juana'' (''Joanam'' in Latin, modern [[Cuba]]) and (6) the island of ''La Spañola'' (''Hispana'' in the Latin letter, modern [[Hispaniola]]). In the letter, Columbus says that he believes Juana is actually part of the continental [[mainland]] (''terra firme'') of [[Cathay]] (''Catayo'', archaic for [[China]]), even though he also admits some of the Indians he encountered informed him that Juana was an island. Later in the letter, Columbus locates the islands at the latitude of [[26th parallel north|26°N]], a fair bit north of their actual location ("es distinta de la linea equinocial veinte e seis grados"). (Note: in the ''Copiador'' version, Columbus makes no mention of the latitudes nor the native name ''Guanahanin''.)

[[File:Columbus Letter (Basel 1493) Illustration 2.jpg|thumb|175px|right|The six islands of the Indies, woodcut from the 1494 Basel edition of Columbus's letter]]
In his letter, Columbus describes how he sailed along the northern coast of Juana (Cuba) for a spell, searching for cities and rulers, but found only small villages "without any sort of government" ("no cosa de regimiento"). He notes that the natives usually fled when approached. Finding this track fruitless, he decided to double-back and head southeast, eventually sighting the large island of Hispaniola, and explored along its northern coast. Columbus exaggerates the size of these lands, claiming Juana is greater in size than [[Great Britain]] ("maior que Inglaterra y Escocia juntas") and Hispaniola larger than the [[Iberian peninsula]] ("en cierco tiene mas que la Espana toda").

In his letter, Columbus seems to attempt to present the islands of the Indies as suitable for future [[colonization]]. Columbus's descriptions of the natural habitat in his letters emphasize the rivers, woodlands, pastures, and fields "very suitable for planting and cultivating, for raising all sorts of livestock herds and erecting towns and farms" ("gruesas para plantar y senbrar, para criar ganados de todas suertes, para hedificios de villas e lugares"). He also proclaims that Hispaniola "abounds in many spices, and great mines of gold, and other metals" ("ay mucha especiarias y grandes minas de oros y otros metales"). He compares lush and well-watered Hispaniola as more favorable to settlement than mountainous Cuba.

Columbus characterizes the native inhabitants of the Indies islands as primitive, innocent, without reason ("like beasts", "como bestias"), and unthreatening. He describes how they go about largely naked, that they lack iron and weapons, and are by nature fearful and timid ("son asi temerosos sin remedio"), even "excessively cowardly" ("en demasiado grado cobardes").

[[File:Columbus landing on Hispaniola adj.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Hispaniola Indians offering Columbus's men piles of gold in exchange for their shoelaces (illustration from [[Theodor de Bry]], 1594)]]
According to Columbus, when persuaded to interact, the natives are quite generous and naïve, willing to exchange significant amounts of valuable gold and cotton for useless glass trinkets, broken crockery, and even shoelace tips ("cabos de agugetas"). In the printed editions (albeit not in the ''Copiador'' version) Columbus notes that he tried to prevent his own sailors from exploiting the Indians' naïveté, and that he even gave away things of value, like cloth, to the natives as gifts, in order to make them well-disposed "so that they might be made Christians and incline full of love and service towards Our Highnesses and all the Castilian nation".

Columbus makes particular note that the natives lack organized religion, not even [[idolatry]] ("no conocian ninguna seta nin idolatria"). He claims the natives believed the Spaniards and their ships had "come down from heaven" ("que yo...venia del cielo"). Columbus notes that the natives of different islands seem to all speak the same language (the Arawaks of the region all spoke [[Taíno language|Taíno]]), which he conjectures will facilitate "conversion to the holy religion of Christ, to which in truth, as far as I can perceive, they are very ready and favorably inclined".

Possibly worried that his characterization might make it appear that the natives are unsuitable for useful labor, Columbus notes that the Indians are "not slow or unskilled, but of excellent and acute understanding". He also notes that the "women appear to work more than the men".

Notice the depiction of the oar-driven [[galley]] in the foreground – an early European interpretation of the Indian [[canoe]], as per Columbus's description.&lt;ref&gt;The "Indian canoe" in the 1494 woodcut is actually a [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] galley, with the [[Lion of Saint Mark]] on the awning, directly copied from an earlier 1486 woodcut by [[Erhard Reuwich]] showing the [[:File:Breydenbach Rodis 1486.jpg|harbor of Rhodes]]. See Davies (1911: p. xxix).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Columbus's physical descriptions are brief, noting only that the natives have straight hair and "nor are they black like those in Guinea". They go around usually naked, although sometimes they wear a small [[cotton]] [[loincloth]]. They often carry a hollow [[Stick-fighting|cane]], which they use to both till and fight. They eat their food "with many spices which are far too hot" ("comen con especias muchas y muy calientes en demasía"; in the ''Copiador'' version Columbus refers to a red hot [[chili pepper]] by its Taíno name, ''agís''). Columbus claims the Indians practice monogamy ("each man is content with only one wife"), "except for the rulers and kings" (who can have as many as twenty wives). He confesses he is uncertain if they have a notion of [[private property]] ("Ni he podido entender si tenian bienes proprios"). In a more detailed passage, Columbus describes the Indian oar-driven [[canoe]] (''canoa'', the first known written appearance of this word, originally from the [[Taíno language]]). Columbus compares the Indian canoe to the European ''[[fusta]]'' (small galley).

Towards the end of the letter, Columbus reveals that local Indians told him about the possible existence of [[cannibal]]s, which he refers to as "monsters" ("monstruos"). This is a probable reference to the [[Island Caribs|Caribs]] from the [[Leeward Islands]], although neither the word "cannibal" nor "Carib" appears in the printed editions (however, in the ''Copiador'' letter, he claims the "monsters" come from an island called "Caribo", possibly [[Dominica]]). Columbus says the monsters are reported to be long-haired, very ferocious, and "eat human flesh" ("los quales comen carne humana"). Columbus has not seen them himself, but says that local Indians claim the monsters have many canoes, and that they sail from island to island, raiding everywhere. However, Columbus proclaims disbelief in the existence of these "monsters", or rather suggests this is likely just a local Indian myth pertaining to some distant Indian seafaring tribe who are probably not unlike themselves ("I regard them as of no more account than the others", "yo no los tengo en nada mas que a los otros").

Columbus connects the monsters story to another local legend about a tribe of [[Amazons|female warriors]], who are said to inhabit the island of "Matinino" east of Hispaniola ("first island of the Indies, closest to Spain", possibly referring to [[Guadaloupe]]). Columbus speculates that the aforesaid canoe-borne monsters are merely the "husbands" of these warrior women, who visit the island intermittently for mating.&lt;ref&gt;In Columbus's journal entry of January 6, 1493 (Markham ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=2mvK60VAdCcC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.151]), Columbus locates Caribo and Matinino east of Hispaniola, and even makes plans (January 16–17, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2mvK60VAdCcC&amp;pg=PA162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 162–63]) to find the islands and capture some of these women-warriors. Tales of distinct female and male islands ("Feminina" and "Masculia") abound in [[Classical antiquity|Classical]] tradition, and [[Marco Polo]] (Pt. 3, Ch. 33) locates two such islands in the [[Indian Ocean]]. Columbus may have sought this island of women out precisely to confirm his location (March and Passman, 1993: pp. 300–01). Whatever the European influence on Columbus's thinking, there does seem to have been an indigenous local legend about an island of only women. [[Ferdinand Columbus]] ([https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEQOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA283#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 283ff.]) relates the legend of Matinino, drawing from Friar Ramon Pane, who set it down in 1497 from oral native sources. The Caribs did live in a sexually segregated society, where men and women lived in separate housing and are reported to have even spoken different languages (Josephy, 1968: p. 266).&lt;/ref&gt; The island of women reportedly abounds in [[copper]], which the warrior-women forge into weapons and shields.

[[File:Taínos.svg|thumb|250px|left|Distribution of [[Arawaks]], [[Island Caribs|Caribs]], and [[Guanajatabey]] in the [[West Indies]], c. 1492]]
Lest his readers begin to get wary, Columbus rounds off with a more optimistic report, saying the local Indians of Hispaniola also told him about a very large island nearby which "abounds in countless gold" ("en esta ay oro sin cuenta"). (He doesn't give this gold island a name in the printed letters, but in the ''Copiador'' version, this island is identified and named as "[[Jamaica]]".) In the printed letters, Columbus claims to be bringing back some of the gold island's "bald-headed" inhabitants with him. Earlier in the letter, Columbus had spoken also of the land of "Avan" ("Faba" in the ''Copiador'' letter), in the western parts of Juana, where men are said to be "born with tails" ("donde nacan la gente con cola")—probably a reference to the [[Guanajatabey]] of western Cuba.

The ''Libro Copiador'' version of the letter contains more native names of islands than the printed editions.&lt;ref&gt;Zamora (1993: Spanish ed. [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft009nb0cv&amp;chunk.id=d0e4530&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress p.188-89], English trans. [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft009nb0cv&amp;chunk.id=d0e5223&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress p.196-97])&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in the ''Copiador'' letter, Columbus notes that island of "monsters" is called "Caribo", and explains how the warrior-women of Matinino send away their male children to be raised there.&lt;ref&gt;In this passage in the manuscript, the island of children seems to be written as "Cardo", which Zamora (1993: p. 188) leaves intact, suggesting Cardo is possibly a different island from Caribo; however Henige (1994) reads it as "Carbo" and a mere mistranscription of "Caribo"—i.e., the Amazons retain the girls on their island and send their sons to be raised on their husbands' island; thus the (male) Caribs are the sons of the Matinino Amazons.&lt;/ref&gt; It also refers to an island called "Borinque" ([[Puerto Rico]]), unmentioned in the printed editions, that the natives report to lie between Hispaniola and Caribo. The ''Copiador'' letter notes Juana is called "[[Cuba]]" by the natives ("aquéllos llaman de Cuba"). He also gives more details about the gold island, saying it is "larger than Juana", and lying on the other side of it, "which they call [[Jamaica]]", where "all the people have no hair and there is gold without measure" ("que llaman Jamaica; adonde toda la gente della son si cabellos, en ésta ay oro sin medida").&lt;ref&gt;Columbus's journal writes it as ''Yamaye'' (Markham ed, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2mvK60VAdCcC&amp;pg=PA151#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 151]). Henige (1994: p. 153) takes the use of the spelling "Jamaica", which emerged only in the mid-16th century, as an indicator this was a modification by a later scribe in the ''Libro Copiador''. Others take it as sign that the ''Libro Copiador'' might be a forgery.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Copiador'' letter, Columbus suggests that he is bringing normal (full-haired) Indians back to Spain who have been to Jamaica, who will report more about it (rather than bringing the island's own bald-headed inhabitants, as claimed in the printed letters).

[[File:Construction of Navidad fort in Hispaniola (1493).jpg|thumb|200px|Construction of the fort at [[La Navidad]], Hispaniola, from the 1494 Basel edition of Columbus's letter]]
Columbus also gives an account of some of his own activities in the letters. In the letter, he notes that he ordered the erection of the fort of [[La Navidad]] on the island of Hispaniola, leaving behind some Spanish colonists and traders. Columbus reports he also left behind a [[caravel]]—evidently covering up the loss of his flagship, the ''[[Santa María (ship)|Santa María]]''. He reports that La Navidad is located near reported gold mines, and is a well-placed entrepot for the commerce that will doubtlessly soon be opened with the [[Yuan Dynasty|Great Khan]] ("gran Can") on the mainland. He speaks of a local king near Navidad whom he befriended and treated him as a brother ("y grand amistad con el Rey de aquella tierra en tanto grado que se preciava de me lhamar e tener por hermano")—almost certainly a reference to [[Guacanagaríx]], cacique of [[Chiefdoms of Hispaniola#Chiefdom of Marién|Marién]].&lt;ref&gt;Zamora (1993: p. 228 n.8)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Copiador'' version (but not the printed editions), Columbus alludes to the treachery of "one from Palos" ("uno de Palos"), who made off with one of the ships, evidently a complaint about [[Martín Alonso Pinzón]], the captain of the ''[[Pinta (ship)|Pinta]]'' (although this portion of the ''Copiador'' manuscript is damaged and hard to read).&lt;ref&gt;Zamora (1993: p. 13)&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Copiador'' version also mentions other points of personal friction not contained in the printed editions, e.g. references to the ridicule Columbus suffered in the Spanish court prior to his departure, his bowing to pressure to use large ships for ocean navigation, rather than the small [[caravel]]s he preferred, which would have been more convenient for exploring.

At the end of his printed letter, Columbus promises that if the Catholic Monarchs back his bid to return with a larger fleet, he will bring back a lot of gold, [[spices]], [[cotton]] (repeatedly referenced in the letter), [[mastic gum]], [[aloe]], [[slaves]], and possibly [[rhubarb]] and [[cinnamon]] ("of which I heard about here").

Columbus ends the letter urging their Majesties, the Church, and the people of Spain to give thanks to God for allowing him to find so many souls, hitherto lost, ready for conversion to Christianity and eternal salvation. He also urges them to give thanks in advance for all the temporal goods found in abundance in the Indies that shall soon be made available to Castile and the rest of Christendom.

The ''Copiador'' version (but not the printed Spanish or Latin editions) also contains a somewhat bizarre detour into messianic fantasy, where Columbus suggests the monarchs should use the wealth of the Indies to finance a new [[crusade]] to conquer [[Jerusalem]], Columbus himself offering to underwrite a large army of ten thousand cavalry and hundred thousand infantry to that end.

The sign off varies between editions. The printed Spanish letter is dated aboard the caravel "on the [[Canary Island]]s" on February 15, 1493. ("Fecha en la caravela sobra las yslas de Canaria a xv de Febrero, ano Mil.cccclxxxxiii"), and signed merely "El Almirante", while the printed Latin editions are signed "Cristoforus Colom, oceanee classis prefectus" ("Prefect of the Ocean fleet"). However, it is doubtful Columbus actually signed the original letter that way. According to the [[Capitulations of Santa Fe]] negotiated prior to his departure (April 1492), Christopher Columbus was ''not'' entitled to use the title of "[[Admiral]] of the Ocean Sea" unless his voyage was successful. It would be highly presumptuous for Columbus to sign his name that way in February or March, when the original letter was drafted, before that success was confirmed by the royal court. Columbus only obtained confirmation of his title on March 30, 1493, when the [[Catholic monarchs]], acknowledging the receipt of his letter, address Columbus for the first time as "our Admiral of the Ocean Sea and Vice-Roy and Governor of the islands which have been discovered in the Indies" ("nuestro Almirante del mar Océano e Visorrey y Gobernador de las Islas que se han descubierto en las Indias").&lt;ref&gt;Navarrete (1825: vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2KYGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 22–23])&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests the signature in the printed editions was not in the original letter, but was an editorial choice by the copyists or printers.&lt;ref&gt;Jane (1930: p. 50)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Copiador'' version there are passages (omitted from the printed editions) petitioning the monarchs for the honors promised him at Santa Fe, and additionally asking for a [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]] for his son and the appointment of his friend, Pedro de Villacorta, as paymaster of the Indies. The ''Copiador'' letter signs off as "made in the sea of Spain on March 4, 1493" ("Fecha en la mar de España, a quatro días de março"), a stark contrast to the February 15 given in the printed versions. There is no name or signature at the end of the ''Copiador'' letter; it ends abruptly "En la mar" ("At sea").

In the printed Spanish editions (albeit not in the Latin editions nor the ''Copiador''), there is a small [[postscript]] dated March 14, written in [[Lisbon]], noting that the return journey took only 28 days (in contrast with the 33 days outward), but that unusual winter storms had kept him delayed for an additional 23 days. A codicil in the printed Spanish edition indicates that Columbus sent this letter to the "Escribano de Racion", and another to their Highnesses. The Latin editions contain no postscript, but end with a verse [[epigram]] added by Leonardus de Cobraria, Bishop of Monte Peloso.

== Assessment ==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2013}}
Christopher Columbus's letter is often compared to the letters of other early explorers, notably his contemporary [[Amerigo Vespucci]], whose letters of 1504–05 enjoyed even greater dissemination and popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Clough (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The tone and focus of Columbus's letter may have something to do with it. Columbus's descriptions of the lands and peoples are not really as a detached observer, filled with sheer curiosity, but rather more as an invested entrepreneur with an eye for economic opportunities. It should be remembered that the Columbus expedition was commercial in purpose. Having failed to find the great markets and cities of China or India, he was returning with empty hulls. So it was unsurprising that in his letter, which has the purpose of reporting the results of his voyage to his investors, Columbus emphasized future economic prospects to make it appear a success.

At every turn, Columbus seems to attempt to portray the islands of the Indies as suitable for future [[colonization]]. The notion of colonization for profit was not unfamiliar at the time. The Portuguese had already colonized the Atlantic islands of [[Madeira]] and the [[Azores]] and erected considerable export industries in timber, sugar and [[dragon's blood]], and the Castilian crown was in the process of completing its [[conquest of the Canary Islands]], drumming up trade in [[orchil]] and [[slaves]] as they went.

In his letter, Columbus's description of the land focuses on listing exploitable natural resources and what can be built there in the future (mines, towns, farms), rather than launching into descriptive dissertations. There are no extended allusions to an earthly Garden of Eden, marvelous vegetation or colorful songbirds, or the structure of Indian villages, as can be found in Vespucci's letters or in Columbus's own journal. It seems evident Columbus's letter was written for an audience of European officials and merchants, not to delight the imagination of common European readers.

The [[anthropology|anthropological]] notes in Columbus's letter are relatively sparse. He does not really inquire into or describe the local [[Arawak]] natives, their lifestyles, society or customs in much detail. Rather, Columbus's letter is primarily focused on the natives' interaction with the Spaniards, underlining their docility and amenability and other points relevant for the prospects of successful future colonization (religion, exchange, notions of property, work capacity). In emphasizing their timidity and lack of weapons, Columbus may have had in mind the long and painful Spanish conquest of the Canary Islands, which had been fiercely resisted by the aboriginal [[Guanches]], and perhaps sought to underline that such difficulties would not likely be encountered in the Indies islands. The existence of the Caribs—the prospect of warlike cannibals would surely be discouraging to colonization—is promptly dismissed by Columbus as myth.

The religious angle, the repeated emphasis on the masses of new souls available and inclined for conversion to [[Catholic Christianity]], and even the crusade theory of the ''Copiador'' letter, was written more for an ecclesiastical-legal audience rather than investors. The decision on the future of the islands belonged to the pious Queen of Castile and the Pope, the ultimate arbitrator of the legal claims. Here too, Columbus seemed to be aware of history. The discovery of the Canary Islands in the 1340s had launched a wave of slaving expeditions that had shocked the Church and prompted the intervention of the pope, who overrode the claims of the Iberian monarchs and wrote the islands over to a private entrepreneur ([[Luis de la Cerda]]) who promised to convert the natives instead. The Portuguese prince [[Henry the Navigator]] had deftly connected the concepts of enslavement and religious conversion to secure a papal grant for the exclusive commercial exploitation of [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]]. Whether such a gambit would work in Columbus's case was as yet unclear, but the letter was not leaving things up to chance. The queen had already made some significant promises ([[Capitulations of Santa Fe]]), which Columbus reminded her of (in the ''Copiador'' letter). Should the monarchs not follow through, his religious arguments might find a sympathetic ear in the Church and perhaps persuade the pope to defend his privileges, and maybe even (although this is a stretch) decide to turn Columbus into a modern De la Cerda or Prince Henry, and enthrone him personally as the "Prince of the Indian Isles".

The practical intentions of the Columbus letter affected its tone and focus, and perhaps limited his audience, especially when compared to the more popular letters of Amerigo Vespucci. Matters of the Asian trade, economic exploitation and legal claims, might be interesting to overseas merchants, royal officials and Church lawyers, but less so to common European readers who were not likely to be involved at that high level. Vespucci's letters, by comparison, spoke to a more common imagination—[[new world]]s, paradises on earth, [[noble savage]]s, societies without masters and the folly of the [[Classical antiquity|ancients]], appealed to common curiosity and intrigued the scientific interests of the [[Renaissance]] [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] of the day. Vespucci's rawer tales of cannibalism and free sexuality added a touch of titillation to the wonder. Columbus's letter, which passes over these details too quickly, and focuses on promising riches to merchants and converts to the Church, seemed relatively dull and grasping by comparison. The few points of marvel in Columbus's letter—cannibals, men with tails, and the island of the Amazons—are brief and only hearsay, dismissible as usual travel myths, unlikely to draw serious attention or set tongues talking in humanist circles.

Columbus's letter introduced his name to European audiences, but did not quite immortalize it. In years to come, it was Amerigo Vespucci's name that became associated with the new continent. Columbus's reputation and achievement was cemented less by his own pen, and more by that of early Spanish chroniclers, like [[Peter Martyr d'Anghiera]], [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]], [[Bartolomé de las Casas]], [[Francisco López de Gómara]], [[Antonio Herrera]] and, of course, his own son, [[Ferdinand Columbus]].

== History of the letter ==
[[File:Columbus letter Spanish text.jpg|thumb|[[Facsimile]] of the first page of the folio edition of the Spanish text of Columbus's letter to Luis de Santangel, dated February 15, 1493, and printed in [[Barcelona]]. From the original unique copy currently held by the [[New York Public Library]].]]
No original [[manuscript]] copy of Columbus's letter is known to exist. Historians have had to rely on clues in the printed editions, many of them published without date or location, to reconstruct the history of the letter.

It is assumed that Columbus wrote the original letter in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. As a result, historians tend to agree that the Barcelona edition (which has no date or publisher name, and the appearance of being hurriedly printed) was probably the first to be published, and was the closest to the original manuscript. At the end of the Barcelona edition there is a codicil stating:

::"''Esta carta enbió Colom al Escrivano de Ración, de las Islas halladas en las Indias, contenida á otra de sus Altezas.''" (Trans: "This letter was sent by Columbus to the Escrivano de Racion. Of the islands found in the Indies. it contains (was contained in?) another (letter) for their Highnesses")

This suggests that Columbus dispatched two letters—one to the ''Escrivano de Ración'', Luis de Santángel, and another to the [[Catholic monarchs]], [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and [[Isabella I of Castile]].

In the printed version of the Spanish letter, the post-script is dated March 14, rather than March 4; this could be just a printer's error; the letter to the monarchs in the ''Libro Copiador'' gives the correct post-script date, March 4, 1493.&lt;ref&gt;Zamora (1993), [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft009nb0cv&amp;chunk.id=d0e4530&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress p. 189]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dispatch ===
In his summary of the on-board journal, Columbus's son, [[Ferdinand Columbus]] (corroborated by [[Bartolomé de las Casas]]), reports that his father wrote two letters to the Catholic monarchs in the middle of a storm around the [[Azores]] on February 14, and sealed them in watertight casks, one thrown overboard, another tied to the [[stern]], so that if the ships foundered, the letters would drift on their own to land.&lt;ref&gt;F. Columbus (1892: v.1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ZEQOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA162#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 162-63]); B. de las Casas (1875: v.1, [https://books.google.com/books?id=isZ6AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA447#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.447]); Henige (1994: pp. 143–44)&lt;/ref&gt; It is nearly impossible to suppose the letters were dispatched in this manner; the casks were probably fished back when the storm subsided, and the post-script confirms they were sent later. (It should be noted it is also unlikely Columbus initiated the long letter in the middle of the storm—he surely had more urgent matters to attend to; he probably wrote the main body of the letter in the calm period before the storm began on February 12, and hurried to finish them when the storm hit.)&lt;ref&gt;Jane (1930: pp. 36–37); Henige (1994: p. 144)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some uncertainty over whether Christopher Columbus sent the letters directly from [[Lisbon]], after docking there on March 4, 1493, or held on to them until he reached Spain, dispatching the letters only after his arrival at [[Palos de la Frontera]] on March 15, 1493.

It is highly probable, albeit uncertain, that Columbus sent the letter from Lisbon to the Spanish court, probably by courier.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1997: [https://books.google.com/books?id=BR6Ek48GgzEC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA197#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 197])&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus's journal says that upon docking in Lisbon, [[Bartholomew Dias]] (on behalf of King [[John II of Portugal]]) demanded that Columbus deliver his report to him, which Columbus strenuously refused, saying his report was for the monarchs of Spain alone.&lt;ref&gt;Columbus's journal (Markham ed., 1893: [https://books.google.com/books?id=2mvK60VAdCcC&amp;pg=PA188#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 188–89])&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus probably realized time was of the essence. It was common for royal and commercial agents to accost and interview returning sailors in the docks, so the Portuguese king would likely have the information he sought soon enough.&lt;ref&gt;Jane (1930: p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt; Once he determined the location of the islands discovered by Columbus, John II might initiate a legal offensive or dispatch his own ships, to claim them for Portugal. So Columbus realized the Spanish court needed to be informed of the results of his voyage as soon as possible. Had Columbus decided to wait until he reached Palos to dispatch his letter, it might have been received too late for the Spanish monarchs to react and forestall any Portuguese actions. The earliest Spanish record of the news, reporting that Columbus "had arrived in Lisbon and found all that he went to seek", is contained in a letter by [[Luis de la Cerda y de la Vega]], [[Duke of Medinaceli]], in Madrid, dated March 19, 1493,&lt;ref&gt;Morison (2007: p. 375); Letter of Medinaceli is reproduced as document Num. XIV in Navarrete (1825: vol. 2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2KYGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA20#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 20–21]).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was possibly fear of the interception of the courier from Lisbon by Portuguese agents that prompted Columbus to introduce some [[disinformation]] in his letter. For instance, Columbus claims he wrote the letter on a caravel while he was around the [[Canary Islands]] (rather than the Azores) probably in order to conceal that he had been sailing in Portuguese territorial waters.&lt;ref name = ife /&gt; (The manuscript letter to the Monarchs writes the location as "Mar de España".&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1997: p. 200)&lt;/ref&gt;) In the letter, Columbus also locates the islands at 26°N, quite north of their actual location, probably trying to set them above the [[latitude]] line designated by the [[Treaty of Alcáçovas]] of 1479 as the boundary of the exclusive dominions of the Portuguese crown (he fell a little short—the treaty latitude was set at the Canary islands latitude, approximately 27°50', which cuts around the middle of the Florida peninsula). He gives no details of his bearing, no mention of whether he sailed west, north or south, or whether the waters were shallow or deep—Columbus's letters "say much and reveal nothing".&lt;ref&gt;Jane (1930: p. 44)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he is unclear about the length of the trip, claiming it took "thirty-three days" (which is roughly correct if measured from the Canaries, but it was seventy-one days since he left Spain itself; Columbus's letter leaves it ambiguous). Finally, his emphatic statement that he formally "took possession" of the islands for the Catholic monarchs, and left men (and a ship) at La Navidad, may have been emphasized to forestall any Portuguese claim.

=== Recipients ===
[[File:Luis de Santangel.jpg|thumb|left|Luis de Santángel, recipient of Columbus's letter]]
The explicit recipient of Columbus's Spanish letter was the ''Escribano de Ración''—at that time, [[Luis de Santángel]]. An official position of the [[Crown of Aragon]], the ''Escribano de Ración'' was the high accountant or comptroller of the king's household expenditures, and can be thought of as a [[finance minister]] to [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;The identification of Santangel is due to Navarrete (1825: vol. 1, p. 167). Navarrete notes that the equivalent position in the [[Crown of Castile]] had a different title, ''Contador mayor'', which was at that time held by a certain Alonso de Quintanilla.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adler&gt;Adler, Joseph (1998) "Christopher Columbus's Voyage of Discovery: Jewish and New Schristian Elements", ''Midstream''. As found [http://www.saudades.org/ccolumbusvoyage.html online] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512223603/http://www.saudades.org/ccolumbusvoyage.html |date=May 12, 2008 }}, accessed February 12, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

It is unsurprising that Columbus singled Santangel out as the first recipient of the news. Santangel had been the person who made the case to, and persuaded, Queen [[Isabella I of Castile|Isabella]] to sponsor Columbus's voyage eight months earlier. Indeed, Santangel arranged for much of the financing to the Castilian crown (much of it from his own pocket) to enable the monarchs to sponsor it.&lt;ref name = adler /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luis Santangel, a Jewish ''[[converso]]'', was "Ferdinand's financial secretary, who advanced to Isabella the 16,000 or 17,000 ducats to enable Columbus to discover the New World, was penanced July 17, 1491. He still continued in the royal service but he must have been condemned again for, after his death, about 1500, Ferdinand kindly made over his confiscated property to his children". He was the cousin of another Luis de Santangel "who had been knighted by Juan II for services in the war with Catalonia, was beheaded and burnt", H.C. Lea (1906: [https://books.google.com/books?id=YVPuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA259#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 259])&lt;/ref&gt; As Santangel had a lot riding on the results of this expedition, perhaps more than anybody else, it was perhaps natural for Columbus to address his first letter to him. Moreover, as the letter indicates, Columbus sought more financing to return with an even larger fleet to the Indies as soon as possible, so it would be useful to contact Santangel immediately, so he could set the wheels in motion for a [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Second voyage|second voyage]].

The story of the second copy of the letter, the one ostensibly sent to the Catholic Monarchs, has been more complicated. The "contain" verb in the codicil of the Spanish Letter to Santangel leaves ambiguous which one was contained in which. Some believe the letters to the Monarchs and to Santangel were sent separately, perhaps even on different days (March 4 and March 14 respectively)&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1997: pp. 200–01)&lt;/ref&gt; others suggest Santangel was supposed to personally deliver the letter to the monarchs (even though handling royal correspondence was outside his formal functions, Santangel's proximity to Isabella may have been a security consideration&lt;ref&gt;Jane (1930: pp. 42ff)&lt;/ref&gt;); still others believe it the other way around, that the letter to Santangel was submitted first to the monarchs to get royal approval before being forwarded to Santangel for ultimate publication (it would have been consistent with Santangel's office as ''Escribano'', to oversee and pay the printers).&lt;ref&gt;Jane (1930: p. 45); Ramos (1986); Henige (1994: pp. 145–46)&lt;/ref&gt; The reply of the Catholic monarchs to Columbus, dated March 30, 1493, acknowledges receipt of the letter, but clarifies nothing about how it was delivered.&lt;ref&gt;The monarchs response is reproduced as document Num. XV in Navarrete (1825: vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2KYGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA21#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 22–23])&lt;/ref&gt;

It was long believed by historians that the printed Spanish editions, although bearing no addressee except "Señor", was based on the copy of the letter sent by Columbus to Luis de Santangel,&lt;ref&gt;For a fascimile, see ''The Spanish letter of Columbus to Luis de Sant' Angel, Escribano de Racion of the Kingdom of Aragon, dated 15 February 1493'', fascimile with M.P. Kerney trans., 1893, London: Quaritch. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NPXCTYxu-R4C&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online]&lt;/ref&gt; but that the Latin edition printed in Rome (and subsequently Basel, Paris, etc.) was a translated version of the copy of the letter sent by Columbus to the Catholic Monarchs.

The printed Spanish and Latin editions are practically identical, with only some very minor differences, most of them attributable to the printers. In particular, the Latin edition omits the postscript and codicil pertaining to the ''Escribano'', and adds a prologue and epilogue not present in the Spanish editions, which give some clues as to its assumed provenance. The earliest Latin version (although bearing no date or printer name) states the letter was addressed to "Raphael Sanxis" (assumed to mean [[Gabriel Sanchez]], the treasurer of the [[Crown of Aragon]]&lt;ref&gt;For the identification of Gabriel Sanchez as treasurer, see Navarrete (1829: v. 3, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ESYW_1DUELoC&amp;pg=PA76#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 76])&lt;/ref&gt;), and has an opening salutation hailing the Catholic king [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] (later Latin editions correct the addressee's name to "Gabriel Sanchez" and add [[Isabella I of Castile]] to the salutation).&lt;ref&gt;A fascimile of the second (corrected) Roman edition by Stephanus Plannck is reproduced in ''The Latin letter of Columbus: printed in 1493 and announcing the discovery of America''. London: Quaritch. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9s0tAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online]. For an English translation of the also-corrected third Roman (Silber) edition, see R.H. Major, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uFg4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt; The prologue notes that the translation into Latin was undertaken by the notary Leander de Cosco and completed on April 29, 1493 ("third of the calends of May"). The Latin editions also have an epilogue with an epigram lauding Ferdinand II by the Neapolitan prelate Leonardus de Corbaria, Bishop of Monte Peloso.

For much of the past century, many historians have interpreted these notes to indicate that the Latin edition was a translated copy of the letter Columbus sent to the Catholic monarchs, who were holding court in [[Barcelona]] at the time. The story commonly related is that after Columbus's original Spanish letter was read out loud at court, the notary Leander de Cosco was commissioned by Ferdinand II (or his treasurer, Gabriel Sanchez) to translate it into Latin. A copy was subsequently forwarded to [[Naples]] ([[Kingdom of Naples|then part]] of the crown of Aragon), where Bishop Leonardus got a hold of it. The bishop subsequently carried it to [[Rome]], probably to report its contents to [[Pope Alexander VI]]. At the time, the pope was then deep in the midst of arbitrating between the claims of the crowns of Portugal and Spain over Columbus's discoveries. The papal bull ''[[Inter caetera]]'', delivering the pope's initial opinion, was issued on May 3, 1493, albeit there remained disputed details to work out (a second and third bull followed soon after).&lt;ref&gt;Davenport (1917: [https://books.google.com/books?id=uLILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 56])&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible Bishop Leander sought to use Columbus's letter to influence that process. While in Rome, Bishop Leonardus arranged for the publication of the letter by the Roman printer Stephanus Plannck, possibly with an eye to help popularize and advance the Spanish case.&lt;ref&gt;Such a motive is suggested by Jane (1930: p. 47)&lt;/ref&gt; The letter's subsequent reprinting in [[Basel]], [[Paris]] and [[Antwerp]] within a few months, seems to suggest that copies of the Roman edition went along the usual trade routes into [[Central Europe]], probably carried by merchants interested in this news.

The 1985 discovery of a manuscript copybook, known as the ''Libro Copiador'', containing a copy of Columbus's letter addressed to the Catholic Monarchs, has led to a revision of this history.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Libro Copiador'' was first published in Romeu de Abreu (1989). See Zamora (1993) for a [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft009nb0cv&amp;chunk.id=d0e4530&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress transcription] and English [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft009nb0cv&amp;chunk.id=d0e5223&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress translation]. For other evaluations of this find, see Henige (1994), Davidson (1997) and Edney (1996 (2009 rev.))&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Copiador'' version has some very distinctive differences from the printed editions. It is now increasingly believed that the Latin edition printed in Rome is actually a translation of the letter to Santangel, and that the letter to the Monarchs was never translated nor printed. In other words, ''all'' the printed editions, Spanish and Latin, derive from the same Spanish letter to Luis de Santangel,.&lt;ref name=edney /&gt; In this view, the reference to "Raphael Sanxis" added by the Roman printer is regarded as a simple error, probably arising from confusion or uncertainty in Italy about whom exactly was holding the office of "Escribano de Racion" of Aragon at the time, the bishop or the printer mistakenly assuming it was Gabrel Sanchez and not Luis de Santangel. But another possibility is that the Aragonese bureaucracy made a copy of Santangel's letter, and forwarded a copy to Sanchez for his information, and that this letter found its way to Italy by some channel, with or without royal permission (a fragment of an Italian translation suggests the treasurer sent a copy to his brother, Juan Sanchez, then a merchant in [[Florence]].)&lt;ref&gt;De Lollis (1894); Jane (1930); more recently, see Ramos (1983, 1986).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, some historians believe that Columbus sent three distinct letters: one the Catholic Monarchs (the manuscript copy), another to Luis de Santangel (origin of the printed Spanish editions), and a third to Gabriel Sanchez (origin of the Latin editions). In other words, that the Santangel and Sanchez letters, although practically identical, are nonetheless distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Jane (1930: pp. 39–40); Anzovin (2000: p. 109)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this leave open the question of why Columbus would have sent a separate letter to Gabriel Sanchez, treasurer of Aragon, with whom he was not intimate, nor was particularly involved in the Indies enterprise, nor any more influential in court than Santangel or some other people Columbus might have addressed.&lt;ref&gt;Jane (1930: p. 38) suggests that, if Columbus sought to influence Ferdinand, then Juan de Coloma, Diego de Deza or even Cardinal Mendoza, would have been better suited recipients, rather than Gabriel Sanchez.&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of Gabriel Sanchez may, however, have been at Luis de Santangel's recommendation or initiative. Gabriel Sanchez was of a family of [[converso]]s who traced their origins back to a Jew named [[Alazar Goluff]] of [[Saragossa]],&lt;ref name=adler /&gt; and Sanchez was married to the daughter of Santangel's cousin (also named Luis de Santangel).&lt;ref name=uchamany&gt;Uchamany (1993: [https://books.google.com/books?id=onyvVGtBjDgC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA110#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 110])&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no record of Sanchez's direct involvement in the organization or financing of the fleet, his nephew, Rodrigo Sanchez, was aboard Columbus's ship as either a surgeon&lt;ref name=sachar&gt;Howard Sachar (1994) "Destination: the New World", extract from ''Farewell Espana: The world of the Sephardim Remembered''. New York: Knopf, as [http://www.myjewishlearning.com/history/Ancient_and_Medieval_History/632-1650/Christendom/Expulsion_and_Readmission/The_New_World.shtml reprint] ed at MyJewishLearning.com&lt;/ref&gt; or a ''veedor'' (or fiscal inspector).&lt;ref name=uchamany /&gt; Years earlier, Gabriel Sanchez's three brothers—Juan, Alfonso and Guillen—as well as his brother-in-law, the son of Santangel's cousin (also, confusingly, named Luis de Santangel, like his father) were accused of conspiracy in the murder of the Spanish [[inquisitor]] [[Pedro de Arbués]] in 1485. Juan and Alfonso escaped abroad, Guillen was tried but given the chance to repent. The Santangel brother-in-law, however, was found guilty of [[Judaizing]] and sentenced to death. Gabriel Sanchez himself was also accused, but he was soon extricated by his employer, King Ferdinand II.&lt;ref name=uchamany /&gt; Perhaps not coincidentally, another of the persons implicated in the conspiracy was the uncle of Leander Cosco, the Latin translator of Columbus's letter to Sanchez, who may himself have been a relative to the Sanchez clan.&lt;ref name=uchamany /&gt; Gabriel's brother Juan Sanchez set himself up in [[Florence]] as a merchant, and is known to have received a copy of Columbus's letter from Gabriel Sanchez, which commissioned to be translated into Italian (only a partial fragment survives, see below). One of Gabriel's nephews, also named Juan Sanchez, would later (1502) become the agent of the Aragon treasury in Seville and a contractor of supplies for the Hispaniola colonies.&lt;ref&gt;Uchamany, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; These intricate familial connections between Luis de Santangel, Gabriel Sanchez, Juan Sanchez and Leander Cosco, could be a mere coincidence, but it also suggests that the dissemination process may have been centrally organized by Luis de Santangel through channels he trusted.

It been suggested in recent years that the printed letter may not have been written in its entirety by the hand of Columbus, but rather was edited by a court official, probably Luis de Santangel.&lt;ref&gt;First suggested by Jane (1930), Ramos Pérez (1983, 1986) is the most prominent recent proponent of this theory. See also Zamora (1993) and Henige (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; This is reinforced by the discovery of the ''Libro Copiador''. The text in the printed Spanish and Latin editions is much cleaner and streamlined than the roaming prose of Columbus's letter to the monarchs found in the ''Libro Copiador''. In particular, the printed editions omit practically all of Columbus's allusions to personal friction found in the manuscript—over the choice of ships, past treatment in the royal court, or the insubordination of the "one from Palos" (Martín Alonso Pinzón)—as well as Columbus's bizarre call for crusade in the Holy Land. The omission of these "distracting" points strongly suggests that there was another hand in the editing of the printed editions. And that this hand was probably a royal official, as these points could be construed as undignified or embarrassing to the crown.

This suggests that the printing of the Columbus letter, if not directly undertaken by royal command, probably had royal knowledge and approval.&lt;ref&gt;Ramos (1983, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt; Its intent may have been to popularize and advance the Spanish case against the Portuguese claims. As noted before, these were being intensively negotiated in the papal court throughout 1493–94. If so, it is quite possible that Luis de Santangel was precisely that royal official, that he edited the content and oversaw the printing in Spain, and it was Santangel who sent a copy of the edited letter to Gabriel Sanchez who proceeded to disseminate it to his contacts in Italy to be translated into Latin and Italian and printed there. The peculiarities of the printed editions ("Catalanisms" in the spelling, the omission of Isabella) suggest this entire editing, printing and dissemination process was handled from the outset by Aragonese officials—like Santangel and Sanchez—rather than Castilians.

The small Spanish editions (and its subsequent disappearance) would be consistent with this thesis. To influence public opinion in Europe, and particularly the Church and the Pope, a Spanish version was not nearly as useful as a Latin one, so there was no purpose of continuing to print the Spanish edition once the Latin one became available. Indeed, there was no point in reprinting the Latin editions either, once the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] was signed in June 1494. Thus, Columbus's letter serves as an early example of the harnessing of the new printing press by the State for propaganda purposes.

=== Settling the claims ===
[[File:Cantino Planisphere.jpg|thumb|[[Cantino planisphere]] of 1502 shows the line of the 1494 [[Treaty of Tordesillas]].]]
Christopher Columbus was probably correct to send the letter from Lisbon, for shortly after, King John II of Portugal indeed began to outfit a fleet to seize the discovered islands for the [[Kingdom of Portugal]]. The Portuguese king suspected (rightly, as it turns out) that the islands discovered by Columbus lay below the [[latitude]] line of the [[Canary Islands]] (approx. 27°50'), the boundary set by the 1479 [[Treaty of Alcáçovas]] as the area of Portuguese exclusivity (confirmed by the papal bull ''[[Aeterni regis]]'' of 1481).&lt;ref&gt;For the treaty of 1479 and the bull of 1481, see Davenport (1917: [https://books.google.com/books?id=uLILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA33#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.33], p. 49).&lt;/ref&gt;

Urgent reports on the Portuguese preparations were dispatched to the Spanish court by the [[Juan Alfonso Pérez de Guzmán, 3rd Duke of Medina Sidonia|Duke of Medina-Sidonia]].&lt;ref&gt;The Spanish monarchs reply to the Duke of Medina-Sidonia is document XVI dated May 2, 1493, given in Navarrete (1825: vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2KYGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 22–23])&lt;/ref&gt; Ferdinand II dispatched his own emissary, Lope de Herrera, to Lisbon to request the Portuguese to immediately suspend any expeditions to the west Indies until the determination of the location of those islands was settled (and if polite words failed, to threaten). Even before Herrera arrived John II had sent his own emissary, Ruy de Sande, to the Spanish court, reminding the Spanish monarchs that their sailors were not allowed to sail below Canaries latitude, and suggesting all expeditions to the west be suspended. Columbus, of course, was in the middle of preparing for his second journey.

[[Pope Alexander VI]] (an [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] national and friend of Ferdinand II) was brought into the fray to settle the rights to the islands and determine the limits of the competing claims. His first bull on the matter, ''[[Inter caetera]]'', dated May 3, 1493, was indecisive. The pope assigned the [[Crown of Castile]] "all lands discovered by their envoys" (i.e. Columbus), so long as they are not possessed by any Christian owner (which Columbus's letter confirmed). On the other hand, the Pope also safeguarded the Portuguese claims by confirming their prior treaties and bulls ("no right conferred on any Christian prince is hereby understood as withdrawn or to be withdrawn"). Thus, on his first shot, the pope effectively left the matter unsettled until the determination of the islands' actual geographic location.&lt;ref&gt;For a transcript and English translation of the bull ''Inter Caetera'' of May 3, see Davenport (1917: [https://books.google.com/books?id=uLILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 56])&lt;/ref&gt; (Note: although most of the negotiations were masterminded by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], who took a personal interest in the second voyage, the actual official claim of title on the islands belonged to his wife, Queen [[Isabella I of Castile]]. The rights, treaties and bulls pertain only to the [[Crown of Castile]] and Castilian subjects, and ''not'' to the [[Crown of Aragon]] or Aragonese subjects)

[[File:Pope Alexander Vi.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Pope Alexander VI]], who settled that the islands discovered by Columbus belonged to the [[Crown of Castile]].]]
It was apparently soon realized that the islands probably lay below the latitude boundary, as only a little while later, Pope Alexander VI issued a second bull ''[[Eximiae devotionis]]'' (officially dated also May 3, but written c. July 1493), that tried to fix this problem by stealthily suggesting the Portuguese treaty applied to "Africa", and conspicuously omitting mention of the Indies. On his third attempt, in another bull also called ''Inter caetara'', written in the summer and backdated to May 4, 1493, the Pope once again confirmed the Spanish claim on the Indies more explicitly with a [[longitude]] line of demarcation granting all lands 100 leagues west of [[Cape Verde]] (not merely those discovered by "her envoys") as the exclusive dominion of the Crown of Castile (with no explicit safeguards for prior Portuguese treaties or grants).&lt;ref&gt;Davenport (1917) reproduces the bulls ''Eximiae devotionis'' of May 3 (July), ([https://books.google.com/books?id=uLILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA64#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 64]) and the second ''Inter caetara'' of May 4 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=uLILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA71#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 71])&lt;/ref&gt; (There is some confusion whether ''Eximiae devotionis'' preceded or followed the second ''Inter caetera''; it is commonly supposed that the first ''Inter caetara'' ("May 3") was drafted in April and received in Spain on May 17, the second ''Inter caetera'' ("May 4") drafted in June, and received in Spain by July 19 (a copy was forwarded to Columbus in early August);&lt;ref&gt;See letter dated August 4, 1493, document LX in Naverrete (1825: vol. 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=2KYGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA88#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 88])&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Eximiae diviones'' ("May 3") is normally assumed written sometime in July. In official time, ''Eximiae'' precedes the second ''Inter caetara'', but in actual time may have actually followed it.)

It is uncertain exactly how the printed editions of the Columbus letter influenced this process. The letter reports the islands are located at 26°N which falls just below the Canary latitude, so the letter worked almost in Portugal's favor, and forced the pope into the geographical contortions of confirming Spanish possession without violating prior treaties. However, the increasing strength of the bulls over the summer, when the letter's circulation was at its height, suggests the Spanish case was ultimately helped rather than hurt by the letter. Minutiae over latitude degrees paled in insignificance with the excitement of the new discoveries revealed in the letters. While the Portuguese tried to paint Columbus as merely just another Spanish interloper, little more than a smuggler, illegally trying to trade in their waters, the letters presented him as a great discoverer of new lands and new peoples. The prospect of new souls ready to be converted, emphasized in the letters, and a Spanish crown eager to undertake the expense of that effort, must have swayed more than a few opinions.

Frustrated by the pope, John II decided to deal with the Spanish directly. The Portuguese envoys Pero Diaz and [[Ruy de Pina]] arrived in Barcelona in August, and requested that all expeditions be suspended until the geographical location of the islands was determined. Eager for a ''fait acompli'', Ferdinand II played for time, hoping he could get Columbus out on his second voyage to the Indies before any suspensions were agreed to. As the king wrote Columbus (September 5, 1493), the Portuguese envoys had no clue where the islands were actually located ("no vienen informados de lo que es nuestro"&lt;ref&gt;Document LXXI in Navarrete (1825: vol. 2 [https://books.google.com/books?id=2KYGAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA108#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 108])&lt;/ref&gt;).

On September 24, 1493, Christopher Columbus departed on his [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus#Second voyage|second voyage]] to the west Indies, with a massive new fleet. The Pope chimed in with yet another bull on the matter, ''[[Dudum siquidum]]'', written in December but officially backdated September 26, 1493, where he went further than before, and gave Spain claim over any and all lands discovered by her envoys sailing west, in whatever hemisphere those lands happened to be.&lt;ref&gt;See Davenport (1917) for ''Dudum siquidum'' ([https://books.google.com/books?id=uLILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 79])&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dudum Siquidum'' had been issued with a second voyage in mind—should Columbus indeed reach China or India or even Africa on this trip, the lands discovered would come under the Spanish exclusive sphere.

Subsequent negotiations between the crowns of Portugal and Spain proceeded in Columbus's absence. They culminated in the famous [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] partitioning the globe between Spanish and Portuguese spheres of exclusivity at a longitude line 370 leagues west of Cape Verde (about 46°30' W).&lt;ref&gt;Davenport (1917: [https://books.google.com/books?id=uLILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 84]). This treaty was not ratified by the pope until 1506, in the bull ''Ea Quem'' by [[Pope Julius II]], Alexander's successor. See Davenport (1917: [https://books.google.com/books?id=uLILAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA107#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 107])&lt;/ref&gt; On the day the treaty was signed, June 7, 1494, Columbus was sailing along the southern shore of Cuba, prodding fruitlessly at that lengthy coast. On June 12, Columbus famously gathered his crew on Evangelista island (what is now [[Isla de la Juventud]]), and had them all swear an oath, before a notary, that Cuba was not an island but indeed the mainland of Asia and that China could be reached overland from there.&lt;ref&gt;Winsor (1891:[https://books.google.com/books?id=XL8RAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA296#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 296])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editions of the letter ==
There are two known editions of the (Spanish) Letter to Santangel, and at least six editions of the (Latin) Letter to Gabriel Sanchez published in the first year (1493), plus an additional rendering of the narrative into Italian verse by Giuliano Dati (which went through five editions). Other than the Italian verse, the first foreign language translation was into German in 1497. In all, seventeen editions of the letter were published between 1493 and 1497.&lt;ref name=edney /&gt; A manuscript copy of the letter to the Catholic monarchs, found in 1985, remained unprinted until recently.

=== Letter to Luis de Santangel (Spanish) ===
Written and printed in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], usually assumed to be from the copy of the letter sent by Columbus to Luis de Santángel, the ''Escribano de Racion'' of the [[Crown of Aragon]], although there is no addressee named (the letter is addressed merely to "Señor").
* 1. '''Barcelona edition''', untitled, in [[Folio (printing)|folio]], undated and printer unnamed. The existence of certain [[Catalan language|Catalan]]-influenced spellings it was from the outset presumed to be probably published in [[Barcelona]]. Some early historians assumed the printer to be Johan Rosenbach, but he has been more recently identified as probably Pere Posa of [[Barcelona]] on the basis of typographic similarity.&lt;ref&gt;Sanz López (1962: p. 19)&lt;/ref&gt; The date of the edition is estimated to be late March or early April, 1493. Only one copy from this edition has ever been found. It was discovered in 1889, in the catalog of the antiquarian dealer J. Maisonneuve in Paris, and was sold for the exorbitant price of 65,000 [[franc]]s to the British collector [[Bernard Quaritch]].&lt;ref&gt;Winsor (1891: p. 13); Sanz Lopez (1962: p. 18)&lt;/ref&gt; After publishing a facsimile edition and translation in 1893, Quaritch sold the original copy to the Lenox library, which is now part of the [[New York Public Library]], where it remains.&lt;ref&gt;''The Spanish letter of Columbus to Luis de Sant' Angel, Escribano de Racion of the Kingdom of Aragon, dated 15 February 1493'', fascimile with M.P. Kerney trans., 1893, London: Quaritch. [https://books.google.com/books?id=NPXCTYxu-R4C&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2. '''Ambrosian edition''', in [[quarto]], date, printer name and location are unspecified. It is sometimes assumed that it was printed sometime after 1493 in [[Naples]] or somewhere in Italy, because of the frequent interpolation of the letters ''i'' and ''j'' (common in Italian, but not in Spanish); but others insisted it was printed in Spain;&lt;ref&gt;Harrisse, 1866: p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; a more recent analysis has suggested it was printed in [[Valladolid]] around 1497 by Pedro Giraldi and Miguel de Planes (the first Italian, the second Catalan, which may explain the interpolation).&lt;ref&gt;Sanz (1959: p. 194)&lt;/ref&gt; Only one copy is known, discovered in 1856 at the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]] in [[Milan]]. The Ambrosian letter was originally in the possession of Baron Pietro Custodi until it was deposited, along with the rest of his papers, at the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in 1852 after his death.&lt;ref&gt;Thatcher (1903: [https://books.google.com/books?id=fiYSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 41])&lt;/ref&gt; After its discovery, a transcription was published in 1863, and a facsimile in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;The transcription of the Ambrosian letter was published by G. Daelli with a foreword by Cesare Correnti (1863: [https://books.google.com/books?id=3fM6AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 63–86]), followed by an Italian translation. Daelli &amp; Corrente erroneously presumed it was addressed to Raphael Sanxis. A fascimile was published by Gerolamo d'Adda (1866:
[https://books.google.com/books?id=sycSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR35#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. xxxv–xliii]), with the correct identification of being a letter to Santangel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither of these editions are mentioned by any writers before the 19th century, nor have any other copies been found, which suggests they were very small printings, and that the publication of Columbus's letter may have been suppressed in Spain by royal command.

The existence of the Latin letter to Gabriel Sanchez was known long before the existence of the Spanish letter to Santangel. The Latin editions do not contain the codicil about the letter being sent to the "Escribano de Racion", so there was hardly a trace of its existence before the first copy (the Ambrosian edition) was found in 1856.

In retrospect, however, some hints are given earlier. Columbus's son, [[Ferdinand Columbus]], in making an account of his own library, listed a tract with the title ''Lettera Enviada al Escribano de Racion a 1493: en Catalan''. This may have been a reference to the Barcelona edition of Columbus's letter to Santangel.&lt;ref&gt;Thatcher (1903: p. 45)&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that [[Andrés Bernáldez]], chaplain of Seville, may have had or seen a copy (manuscript or printed) of the Spanish letter to Santangel, and paraphrased it in his own ''Historia de los Reyes Católicos'' (written at the end of the 15th century).&lt;ref&gt;See the passages in Andres Bernaldez's ''Historia de los Reyes Católicos don Fernando y doña Isabel'' (1856 ed., vol. 1, Chapter CXVIII [https://books.google.com/books?id=dFkU3Ux7KdYC&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 269–77]). For an English translation of the relevant passages, see Harrisse (1865: pp. 89–115). This hypothesis was first suggested by [[Juan Bautista Muñoz]] (1793: [https://books.google.com/books?id=ix2AyvRj-7MC&amp;pg=PP11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. viii]) even before the first Spanish edition was found.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spanish historian [[Martín Fernández de Navarrete]] was the first to definitively find a copy of the Spanish letter in the royal archives of [[Simancas]] and to identify Luis de Santangel as the recipient. Navarrete published a transcription of the Spanish letter in his famous 1825 ''Colección'',.&lt;ref&gt;Navarrete (1825: v. 1 [https://books.google.com/books?id=Jui6IGo47eQC&amp;pg=PA167#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 167–75]), It is followed by a transcription of one of the Latin editions([https://books.google.com/books?id=Jui6IGo47eQC&amp;pg=PA175#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 176–97]).&lt;/ref&gt; However, Navarrete's transcription is not based on an original 15th-century edition (which he never claimed to have seen) but rather on a hand-written copy made in 1818 by Tomás González, an archivist at Simancas.&lt;ref&gt;See final note in Navarrete (v. 1, p. 176). Also Thatcher (1903: p. 42)&lt;/ref&gt; Gonzalez's copy has since been lost, and exists now only in the Navarrete transcription.It is uncertain exactly what edition or manuscript González copied (although some of the tell-tale mistakes of the Barcelona edition are repeated).

The Brazilian historian [[Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen]] found another hand-written copy of the Spanish letter to Santangel among the papers of the [[Colegio Mayor de Cuenca]] in [[Salamanca]]. This copy contains a significantly different ending, "''Fecha en la carabela, sobre la Isla de S.a Maria, 18 de Febrero de 93''." ("written on the caravel, on the island of Santa Maria, 18 February 1493"). The date (February 18) and the identification of the [[Azores]] island of [[Santa Maria Island (Azores)|Santa Maria]] (rather than the Canaries) are anomalies not normally found in other editions of the Letter to Santangel. It also lacks the Lisbon post-script and the note about it being sent to the Escriban de la Racion. The Cuenca copy also had a cover title "''Carta del Almirante á D. Gabriel Sanches''". As a result, Varnhagen originally conjectured this may very well have been the original Spanish copy that was translated by Leander de Cosco into Latin, and found its way to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;"Genaro H. de Volafan" (F.A. de Varhagen), editor, 1858, ''Primera Epístola del Almirante Don Cristóbal Colón dando cuenta de su gran descubrimiento á D. Gabriel Sánchez, Tesorero de Aragón''. Valencia: Garin. [https://books.google.com/books?id=yRQLAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online] (accompanied bilingually by the Latin translation of Silber)&lt;/ref&gt; However, modern historians believe this is in fact a later copy of the Barcelona or Ambrosian editions, and that the anomalies exist because the copyist endeavored to correct mistakes and errors in the Spanish letter in light of the later editions and published histories of the Indies by Peter Martyr, Ferdinand Columbus, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Jane (1930: p. 35 n.)&lt;/ref&gt; The original Cuenca manuscript used by Varnhagen has since disappeared.

It is generally accepted that the Barcelona edition is prior to the Ambrosian one. The Barcelona edition is replete with small errors (e.g., "veinte" instead of "xxxiii" days) and [[Catalan language|Catalan]]-style spellings (which Columbus would not have used), suggesting it was carelessly copied and hurriedly printed. The Ambrosian edition seems to correct most of these mistakes, although it also makes a few new mistakes of its own. Navarrete's transcription makes some of the same mistakes as the Barcelona edition (e.g. veinte instead of xxxiii), but most of the spellings are in proper [[Castilian language|Castilian]], although it is uncertain how much of this was in the original, and how much was massaged by Gonzalez or Navarrete in their transcriptions. While all the Spanish editions are very close to each other, historians believe they are not merely corrected reprints of each other, but that all derive independently (or at least in consultation with) an unknown prior edition or manuscript. Because of the "Almirante" signature and other clues, it is believed that all the Spanish editions are probably indirect, that is, that they were probably not directly copied from Columbus's original manuscript letter, but are themselves copies of earlier unknown copies or editions.&lt;ref&gt;De Lollis (1894: pp. xxvi ff.); Jane (1930: p. 34–35)&lt;/ref&gt;

The simplicity and rarity of the original printed editions of the Letter to Santangel (only two copies are known to exist) has made it appealing to [[forger]]s, and there have been repeated attempts to sell fake copies of the letter to libraries and collectors. In one famous case, an Italian forger attempted to sell a copy to the [[New York Public Library]]. When the librarians refused to buy it, the forger angrily tore up the volume in front of them and stormed out. The librarians fished the pieces out of the wastepaper basket and put it back together; it is currently held as a curiosity by the New York Public Library.&lt;ref&gt;Thatcher (1903: [https://books.google.com/books?id=fiYSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 41–42])&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Letter to Gabriel Sanchez (Latin) ===
The first printed edition of the [[Latin language|Latin]] translation of Columbus's letter was probably printed in [[Rome]] by the printer Stephen Plannck, c. May 1493. Most other early Latin editions are reprints of that edition. The title is given as ''De Insulis Indiae supra Gangem nuper inventis'' ("Of the islands of India beyond the [[Ganges]], recently discovered"), and contains a prologue noting that it was sent by Christopher Columbus to "Raphael Sanxis" (later editions correct it to "[[Gabriel Sanchez]]"), the [[treasurer]] of the [[Crown of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;See Navarrete (1829: v. 3, p. 76)&lt;/ref&gt; Its opening salutation hails the [[Catholic monarch]] [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] (later editions also add mention of [[Isabella I of Castile]]) and identifies the translator as the notary "Aliander de Cosco" (later editions correct it to "Leander de Cosco"), noting that he finished translating it on April 29, 1493 ("third [[calends]] of May"). In full, the opening of the first Roman edition reads:&lt;ref&gt;As given in Sabin (1871: [https://books.google.com/books?id=9MkRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA274#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. q274])&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:ColumbusLetter Basel first.jpg|thumb|200px|Image of King [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]], on the cover the Latin edition of Columbus's letter, published in Basel in July, 1494 (second Basel ed.)]]

:: ''Epistola Christofori Colom: cui (a)etas nostra multum debet: de Insulis Indi(a)e supra Gangem nuper inventis, ad quas perquirendas, octavo antea mense, auspicijs et (a)ere invictissimi Fernandi Hispaniarum Regis missus fuerat: ad Magnificum d(omi)n(u)m Raphaelem Sanxis: eiusdem serenissi Regis Thesaurarium missa: quam nobilis ac litteratus vir Aliander de Cosco ab Hispano ideomate in latinum convertit: tertio kal(enda)s Maii, M.cccc.xciii, Pontificatus Alexandri Sexti, Anno primo.''

:: ("Letter of Christopher Columbus, to whom our age is much indebted, about the islands of India beyond the Ganges recently discovered, and to explore which he had been sent eight months before under the auspices and at the expense of the most invincible Ferdinand, King of Spain; to the magnificent lord Raphael Sanxis, Treasurer to the Most Serene King, which the noble and literate notary Aliander de Cosco converted from the Spanish language into Latin, third calends of May, 1493, during the first year of the pontificate of Alexander VI.")

The corrections (Ferdinand &amp; Isabella, Gabriel Sanchez, Leander de Cosco) were underaken in the Second and Third Roman editions later that same year, possibly as a result of complaints by Castilian emissaries in Rome who felt their Queen (and spellings) were given short-shrift by the Aragonese.&lt;ref&gt;For the corrected second Roman edition, see Quaritch (1893: [https://books.google.com/books?id=9s0tAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. ix])&lt;/ref&gt;

All the Latin editions omit the endings found in the Spanish edition to Santangel—i.e., they omit the sign-off of being written on board ship in the Canaries, the postscript about the storm and days it took to return and the codicil about the letter being sent to the Escribano de Racion and the Catholic monarchs. Instead, it simply signs off "Lisbon, the day before the [[Ides of March]]" ("''Ulisbone, pridie Idus Martii''", that is, on May 14). Columbus's signature is given as "Christoforus Colom Oceanice classis Præfectus" ("Christopher Columbus, Prefect (or Admiral) of the Ocean fleet").&lt;ref&gt;Quaritch (1893: [https://books.google.com/books?id=9s0tAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. xv]&lt;/ref&gt; At the end, there is a verse epigram in honor of Ferdinand II written by Leonardus de Corbaria, Bishop of Monte Peloso.&lt;ref&gt;The epigram by R.L. de Corbaria, Episcopi Montispalussi" reads (Quaritch, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9s0tAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. xvi]):
::"Jam nulla Hispanis tellus addenda triumphis,
::Atque parum tantis viribus orbis erat:
::Nunc longe eois Regiis deprehensa sub undis
::Auctura est titulus, Betice magne, tuos.
::Unde repertori merito referenda Columbo
::Gratia: sed summo est major habenda Deo,
::Qui vicenda parat nova regna tibique sibique
::Teque simul fortem praestat et esse plum.&lt;/ref&gt;

For a long time, historians believed the Latin edition was based on the copy of the letter sent by Columbus to the Catholic monarchs (as mentioned at the end of the Spanish letter to Santangel), and that Columbus's address to the treasurer Gabriel Sanchez was merely a courtly formality. According to this account, Columbus's original letter was read (in Spanish) before the monarchs then holding court in Barcelona, and then Ferdinand II of Aragon (or his treasurer Gabriel Sanchez) ordered it translated into Latin by the notary Leander de Cosco, who completed the translation by April 29, 1493 (as noted in the prologue). The manuscript was subsequently carried (or received) by the Neapolitan prelate Leonardus de Corbaria, Bishop of Monte Peloso, who took it to Rome and arranged for its printing there with Stephanus Plannck, c. May 1493. The Roman edition was subsequently carried into Central Europe and reprinted in [[Basel]] (twice, 1493 and 1494), [[Paris]] (three times in 1493) and [[Antwerp]] (once, 1493). A corrected Roman edition was printed by two different publishers in late 1493—one by Stephen Plannck again, the other by Frank Silber (known as Argenteus).&lt;ref&gt;A transcription of the prologues of the various known Latin editions can be found in H. Harrisse (1866: [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjpAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 1], 16), although he orders them differently. See also J. Sabin (1871: [https://books.google.com/books?id=9MkRAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA274#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 274–78]). For a more recent breakdown of the various known editions, see M.H. Edney (1996, rev.2009: [http://usm.maine.edu/maps/web-document/1/5/sub-/5-the-diffusion-of-columbuss-letter-through-europe-1493-1497 online]).&lt;/ref&gt;
* 3. '''First Roman edition''', ''De insulis indiae supra Gangem nuper inventis'', undated and unnamed, but assumed printed by Stephanus Plannck in [[Rome]] (on basis of typographical similarity) probably c. May 1493. Plain text, bereft of the ornaments or stamps typical of the time, it has the appearance of being hurriedly printed, and was probably the first of the Latin editions.&lt;ref&gt;Harrisse (1866: p. 10)&lt;/ref&gt; Opening salutation hails only [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] ("invitissimi Fernandi Hispaniarum Regis"), conspicuously neglecting [[Isabella I of Castile]]; it refers to addressee as "Raphael Sanxis" (wrong first name, surname spelled in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]), and to the translator as "Aliander de Cosco". It was published in [[quarto]], four leaves (34 lines per page).
* 4. '''First Basel edition''', ''De Insulis inventis''. It is the only early edition missing the phrase "Indie supra Gangem" in the title, substituting instead "''Insulis in mari Indico''" ("islands in the Indian Sea"). Otherwise, it seems to be a reprint of the first Roman edition (hails only Ferdinand II, spells Raphael Sanxis, Aliander de Cosco). It is the first edition with illustrative [[woodcut]]s – eight of them.&lt;ref&gt;The eight woodcuts are 1. coat of arms of [[Castile-Leon]], 2. a vessel with the words "Oceanica classis", 3. landing on "Insula hyspana" with galley/canoe in foreground; 4. sort of map with islands named; 5. a repetition of "Oceanica classis" woodcut. 6. fort of La Navidad being constructed, finally on the tenth page (missing in some copies) 7. a full-length portrait of Ferdinand of Aragon, over the shields of Castile-Leon and [[Granada]] and (in recto) 8. coat of armas of Granada. (Henry Harrisse, 1866: [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjpAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 16]). Some of the woodcuts are reproduced in the [http://usm.maine.edu/maps/web-document/1/2/sub-/2-facsimile-reproduction 1494 edition].&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the woodcuts ("Oceana Classis" and the Indian canoe/galley) were plagiarized from earlier woodcuts for a different book.&lt;ref&gt;See Davies (1911: p. xxix). [[Erhard Reuwich]] did the engravings for a 1486 edition of [[Bernard of Breydenbach]]'s ''Peregrinatio in Terram Sanctam'', published in Mainz. The "Oceana Classis" image is copied from a woodcut showing the [http://historic-cities.huji.ac.il/greece/modon/maps/breydenbach_1486_modon_b.jpg harbor of Modone], while the indian canoe/galley is copied from the [[:File:Breydenbach Rodis 1486.jpg|harbor of Rhodes]].&lt;/ref&gt; This edition is undated, without printer name nor location given, but it is often assumed to have been printed in [[Basel]] largely because a later edition (1494) printed in that city used the same woodcuts. Some have speculated the printer of this edition to have been Johannes Besicken&lt;ref&gt;Harrisse (1866: [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjpAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA9#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.9], p. 13).&lt;/ref&gt; or Bergmann de Olpe.&lt;ref&gt;Clough, 1994: [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dg-8ZOeBqcYC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA301#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 301])&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in [[octavo]], ten leaves (27 lines per page).
* 5. '''First Paris edition''', ''Epistola de insulis repertis de novo'', directly from the first Roman edition (hails only Ferdinand II, Raphael Sanxis, Aliander de Cosco). Title page has woodcut of angel appearing unto shepherds. Undated and printer unnamed, but location given as "''Impressa parisius in campo gaillardi''" (Champ-Gaillard in [[Paris]], France). The printer is unnamed, but a later reprint that same year identifies him as Guyot Marchant. In quarto, four leaves (39 lines per page).
* 6. '''Second Paris edition''', ''Epistola de insulis de novo repertis'' probably by Guyot Marchant of Paris. Straight reprint of first Paris edition.
* 7. '''Third Paris edition''', ''Epistola de insulis noviter repertis''. Reprint of prior Paris edition, but this one has large printer's device on the back of the title page, identifying Guyot Marchant as the printer (ergo the deduction that the two prior editions were also by him).&lt;ref&gt;The Marchant colophon is reproduced in Harrisse (1866): [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjpAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 22]&lt;/ref&gt;
* 8. '''Antwerp edition''', ''De insulis indi(a)e supra Gangem nuper inve(n)tis'' by Thierry Martins in [[Antwerp]], 1493, directly from first Roman edition.
* 9. '''Second Roman edition''', ''De insulis indi(a)e supra Gangem nuper inve(n)tis'', undated and printer unnamed, assumed to be again by Stephen Plannck in Rome because of typographic similarity (identical to first edition). This is a corrected edition, presumably put out in late 1493; the salutation now refers to both Ferdinand and Isabella ("invictissimorum Fernandi et Helisabet Hispaniarum Regum"), addressee's name given as "Gabriel Sanchis" (correct first name, surname now in half-Catalan, half-Castilian spelling) and the translator as "Leander de Cosco" (rather than Aliander). It is published in quarto, four leaves (33 lines per page).&lt;ref&gt;A fascimile of the second Roman (Plannck) edition is reproduced in ''The Latin letter of Columbus: printed in 1493 and announcing the discovery of America''. London: Quaritch. [https://books.google.com/books?id=9s0tAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false online].&lt;/ref&gt;
* 10. '''Third Roman edition''', ''De insulis indi(a)e supra Gangem nuper inve(n)tis'' by the Roman printer Franck Silber (who was known as "Eucharius Argenteus"). It is the first edition to be explicitly dated and inscribed with the printer's name: the colophon reads "''Impressit Rome Eucharius Argenteus Anno dni M.cccc.xciij''". It is also a corrected edition: it refers to addressee as "Gabriel Sanches" (Castilian name), the translator as "Leander de Cosco" and salutes both Ferdinand &amp; Isabella. It is uncertain whether this Silber edition precedes or follows Plannck's second edition.&lt;ref&gt;Harrisse (1866: p. 14) assumes Silber precedes Plannck's corrected edition.&lt;/ref&gt; It is published in three unnumbered leaves, one blank (40 lines to the page).&lt;ref&gt;For a Latin transcription (with English translation) of the third Roman (Silber) edition, see R.H. Major, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uFg4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;
* 11. '''Second Basel edition''',''De insulis nuper in mar Indico repertis'', dated and named, printed by Johann Bergmann in [[Basel]], 21 April 1494. This is a reprint of the first Basel edition (uses four of the six woodcuts). This edition was published as an appendix to a prose drama, ''Historia Baetica'' by Carolus Verardus, a play about the 1492 [[Battle of Granada|conquest of Granada]].&lt;ref&gt;M.

The Latin letter to Gabriel Sanchez, either the first or second Roman editions, was translated into [[Italian language|Italian]] [[ottava rima]] by [[Giuliano Dati]], a popular poet of the time, at the request of Giovanni Filippo dal Legname, secretary to Ferdinand II.&lt;ref&gt;On Giuliano Dati, see Harrisse (1866: [https://books.google.com/books?id=pjpAAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA28#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 28])&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of the Italian verse edition was published in June 1493, and went quickly through an additional four editions, suggesting this was probably the most popular form of the Columbus letter known at least to the Italian public. A translation of the Latin letter into German prose was undertaken in 1497.

* 13. '''Second Italian verse edition''', ''La lettera dell'isole che ha trovate novamente il re dispagna'', revised verse translation by Giuliano Dati, printed in [[Florence]] by Laurentius de Morganius and Johann Petri, dated 26 October 1493.&lt;ref&gt;For a copy of the Dati verse, see R.H. Major, (1848: [https://books.google.com/books?id=uFg4AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR73#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. lxxiii])&lt;/ref&gt; It has a famous woodcut on its title page, which was later re-used for a 1505 edition of [[Amerigo Vespucci]]'s ''Letter to Soderini''.&lt;ref&gt;For a fascimile of the 1505 edition of Vespucci's letter to Soderini published by Pacini, see B.

=== Italian translation fragments ===
There are three manuscripts of incomplete attempts by Italian authors to translate the narrative Spanish (or perhaps Latin) letter into Italian prose, probably within 1493. The three fragments were first published by Cesare de Lollis in the ''Raccolta Colombiana'' of 1894.&lt;ref&gt;Cesare de Lollis (1894), editor, ''Scritti di Cristoforo Colombo'' vol. 1, part 1, of ''Raccolta Colombiana'' 1894. First fragment is on pp. lxviiii–lx, second is pp. lxx–lxxii, third is p. lxxiiii. See Jane (1930).&lt;/ref&gt;
* 18. '''First Italian fragment''' manuscript translation into Italian, held at the [[Biblioteca Ambrosiana]] in [[Milan]]. The Italian translator's note claims this to be a copy of a letter written by Columbus "to certain counsellors" ("ad certi consieri") in Spain, and forwarded by "the treasurer" (i.e. Gabriel Sanchez) to his brother, "Juan Sanchez" (named in the text), a merchant in Florence.
* 19. '''Second Italian fragment''' manuscript fragment held at the [[National Central Library (Florence)|Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale]] in [[Florence]]. The Italian translator simply notes that it is a copy of the "letter that came from Spain" ("copia della letera venuta di Spagna"). There is a close connection between this Florentine fragment and the first Latin edition, suggesting one is derived from the other, or they were both using the same Spanish document.&lt;ref&gt;Jane (1930: p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt;
* 20. '''Third Italian fragment''' manuscript fragment held also by the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale in Florence. It contains no translator's notes about its origin or provenance.

It might be worth noting here that the first known [[French language|French]] translation appeared in [[Lyon]] in 1559, in a volume by Charles Fontaine.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Fontaine (1559) ''La Description des terres trouvées de nostre temps, avec le sommaire de plusieurs belles antiquitez, contenant une partie de l'excellence magnificence des richesses, triomphes et largesses des anciens'', Lyon: Benoit Rigaud. See Harrisse (1866: p. 55).&lt;/ref&gt; The first known English translation appeared in the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]'' in 1816.&lt;ref&gt;''Edinburgh Review'', December 1816, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ohp0Z734tBYC&amp;pg=PA505#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pp. 505–11]. Apparently based on the Basel edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Letter to the Catholic monarchs (Libro Copiador) ===
The existence of this manuscript letter was unknown until it was discovered in 1985. The manuscript letter was found as part of a collection known as the ''Libro Copiador'', a book containing manuscript copies of nine letters written by Columbus to the [[Catholic monarch]]s, with dates ranging from March 4, 1493 to October 15, 1495, copied by the hand of a writer in the late 16th century. Seven of these nine letters were previously unknown. Its discovery was announced in 1985 by an antiquarian book dealer in Tarragona. It was acquired in 1987 by the Spanish government and is currently deposited at the [[General Archive of the Indies|Archivo General de Indias]] in [[Seville]].&lt;ref&gt;Arran Márquez (2006: p. 44); Diaz-Trechuelo (2006: p. 47)&lt;/ref&gt; A facsimile edition was published in Rumeu de Armas (1989). A transcription and English translation can be found in Zamora (1993).&lt;ref&gt;Margarita Zamora (1993) ''Reading Columbus'', Berkeley: University of California press. Available online at UC Press E-Books collection: [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft009nb0cv&amp;chunk.id=d0e4530&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress transcription] and English [http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft009nb0cv&amp;chunk.id=d0e5223&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=&amp;brand=ucpress translation] (accessed February 12, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although scholars have tentatively embraced the ''Libro Copiador'' as probably authentic, it is still in the early stages of careful and critical scrutiny, and should be treated a bit cautiously.&lt;ref&gt;Zamora (1993), Henige (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; The first letter in the copybook purports to be a copy of the original letter sent by Christopher Columbus to the Catholic Monarchs from Lisbon announcing the discovery. If authentic, it is prior to the Barcelona edition, indeed it precedes all known versions of the letter.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson (1997: p. 197)&lt;/ref&gt; It contains significant differences from both the Spanish letter to Santangel and the Latin letter to Sanchez—notably more details about Indian reports, including previously-unmentioned native names of islands (specifically: "Cuba", "Jamaica", "Boriquen" and "Caribo"), and a strange proposal to use the revenues from the Indies to launch a crusade to conquer Jerusalem. It omits some of the more economic-oriented details of the printed editions. If authentic, this letter practically solves the "Sanchez problem": it confirms that the Latin letter to Gabriel Sanchez is ''not'' a translation of the letter that the Spanish codicil said Columbus sent to the Monarchs, and strongly suggests that the Sanchez letter is just a Latin translation of the letter Columbus sent to Luis de Santangel.

'''Eureka''' is a small research base on [[Fosheim Peninsula]], [[Ellesmere Island]], [[Qikiqtaaluk Region]], in the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|Canadian territory]] of [[Nunavut]]. It is located on the north side of Slidre Fiord, which enters [[Eureka Sound]] farther west. It is the third-northernmost permanent research community in the world.  The only two farther north are [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]], which is also on Ellesmere Island, and [[Nord, Greenland|Nord]], in [[Greenland]].  Eureka has the lowest average annual temperature and the lowest amount of precipitation of any weather station in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/cold-places-in-canada/ Cold Places in Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Eureka's [[Canadian postal code|postal code]] is X0A 0G0 and the [[Telephone numbering plan|area code]] is [[Area code 613|613]].&lt;ref name="welcome"&gt;[https://wattsupwiththat.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/visitor_guide_to_eureka_apr_2010.pdf Welcome to the Eureka Weather Station]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Divisions==
The base consists of three areas:{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

*the [[Eureka Aerodrome]] which includes "Fort Eureka" (the quarters for military personnel maintaining the island's communications equipment)
*the [[Environment Canada]] Weather Station
*the [[Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory]] (PEARL), formerly the Arctic Stratospheric Ozone Observatory (AStrO)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.candac.ca/candac/Facilities/facility.php?type=PEARL Polar Environment Atmospheric Research Laboratory]&lt;/ref&gt;

PEARL is operated by a consortium of Canadian university researchers and government agencies known as the Canadian Network for Detection of Atmospheric Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.candac.ca|title=CANDAC|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PEARL announced it would cease full-time year-round operation as of April 30, 2012, due to lack of funding, but this decision was reversed in May 2013 with the announcement of new funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/high-arctic-research-station-saved-by-new-funding-1.1360779|title=High Arctic research station saved by new funding|date=17 May 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Eureka was founded on April 11, 1947, as part of a requirement to set up a network of Arctic [[weather station]]s. On this date, {{convert|100|t}} of supplies were airlifted to a promising spot on Ellesmere Island, and five prefabricated [[Jamesway hut]]s were constructed. Regular weather observations began on January 1, 1948. The station has expanded over the years. At its peak, in the 1970s, at least fifteen staff were on site; in 2005, it reported a permanent population of zero with at least 8 staff on a continuous rotational basis.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Several generations of buildings have been developed. The latest operations centre, with work areas and staff quarters in one large structure, was completed in 2005.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Climate==
Eureka experiences a [[polar climate]] (''ET''). The settlement sees the [[midnight sun]] between April 10 and August 29, with no sunlight at all between mid-October and late February. Eureka has the lowest average annual temperature and least precipitation of any weather station in Canada with an annual mean temperature of {{convert|-18.8|°C}}. However, summers are slightly warmer than other places in the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic]] because Eureka is somewhat landlocked, being near the centre of [[Ellesmere Island]]. Even so, since record keeping began, the temperature has never exceeded {{convert|20.9|°C}}, first reached on July 14, 2009.&lt;ref name="Eureka A"/&gt; Although a polar desert, evaporation is also very low, which allows the limited moisture to be made available for plants and wildlife.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[File:Eureka station.jpg|thumb|Eureka from the air, 2007.]]
The complex is powered by diesel generators. The station is supplied once every six weeks with fresh food and mail by air, and annually in the late summer, a supply ship from [[Montreal]] brings heavy supplies. On July 3, 2009, a Danish [[Challenger 604 MMA]] jet landed at Eureka's aerodrome.&lt;ref name=CasrChallengerDane&gt;

The jet is a military observation aircraft based on the [[Challenger executive jet]]. This jet visited Eureka on a familiarization trip, in order to prepare for the possibility of Danish aircraft assisting in [[Search and Rescue]] missions over Canadian territory. The ''[[Canadian American Strategic Review]]'' noted critically that the first jet to fly a mission to Eureka was not Canadian.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

At Eureka's latitude, a [[geosynchronous]] [[communications satellite]], if due south, would require an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] to be pointed nearly horizontally; satellites farther east or west along that orbit would be below the horizon. Telephone access and television broadcasts arrived in 1982 when [[Operation Hurricane (Canada)|Operation Hurricane]] resulted in the establishment of a satellite receiving station at nearby Skull Point, which has an open view to the south. The low power Channel 9 TV transmitter at Skull Point was the world's most northern TV station at the time. In the 1980s, TV audio was often connected to the telephone to feed CBC-TV news to [[CHAR-FM]] in isolated [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]]. More recently, CANDAC has installed what is likely the world's most northerly geosynchronous satellite ground-station to provide Internet-based communications to PEARL.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Other settlements on Ellesmere Island include Alert and [[Grise Fiord, Nunavut|Grise Fiord]].

==Flora and fauna==
Eureka has been described as "The Garden Spot of the Arctic" due to the flora and fauna abundant around the Eureka area, more so than anywhere else in the High Arctic. Fauna include [[musk ox]]en, [[Arctic Wolf|Arctic wolves]], [[Arctic fox]]es, [[Arctic hare]]s, and [[lemming]]s. In addition, summer nesting geese, ducks, owls, loons, ravens, gulls and many other smaller birds nest, raise their young, and return south in August.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

The Ewaso Lions Project research camp sits within the Westgate Community Conservancy, west of [[Samburu National Reserve]]. Shivani Bhalla, representing the Ewaso Lions is a regular featured guest speaker at the annual [[Wildlife Conservation Network]] Expo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wildnet.org/events/Saturday_Expo.pdf |title = Wildlife Conservation network Expo 2012 |publisher = [[Wildlife Conservation Network]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==

===Scientific research===
The Ewaso Lions Project core research focuses on discovering the factors that drive lion pride locations and movements and the extent of conflict with humans, as well as the effect of habitat loss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11547">'''Geodemography''' includes the application of geodemographic classifications for business, social research and public policy but has a parallel history in academic research seeking to understand the processes by which settlements (notably, cities) evolve and neighborhoods are formed. It links the sciences of [[demography]], the study of human population dynamics, [[geography]], the study of the locational and spatial variation of both physical and human phenomena on Earth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830110916/http://www.iowageographer.com/research.html|title=BTL Consulting -- Geodemographic Research|date=30 August 2005|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also [[sociology]]. In short, geodemography is the study of people based on where they live. Geodemographic systems estimate the most probable characteristics of people based on the pooled profile of all people living in a small area near a particular address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105215826/http://www.rdaresearch.com.au/resources.php|title=rda research - geodemographic resources|date=5 January 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The origins of geodemographics are often identified as [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] and his studies of deprivation and poverty in early twentieth century [[London]], and the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago School of sociology]]. Booth developed the idea of 'classifying neighborhoods', exemplified by his multivariate classification of the 1891 UK Census data to create a generalized social index of London's (then) registration districts. Research at the Chicago School – though generally qualitative in nature – strengthened the idea that such classifications could be meaningful by developing the idea of 'natural areas' within cities: conceived as geographical units with populations of broadly homogenous social-economic and cultural characteristics.

The idea that census outputs could serve to identify and to characterize the geographies of cities gathered momentum with the increased availability of national census data and the computational ability to look for patterns in such data. Of particular importance to the emerging geodemographic industry was the development of clustering techniques to group statistically similar neighborhoods into classes on a 'like with like' basis. More recently, data have become available at finer geographical resolutions (such as postal units), often originating from private commercial (i.e. non-governmental) sources.

Commercial geodemographics emerged from the late 1970s with the launch of PRIZM by Claritas in the US and [[Acorn (demographics)|Acorn]] by [[CACI]] in the UK. Geodemography has been used to target consumer services to 'ideal' populations based on their lifestyle and location. These parameters have been taken from geographical databases as well as from electoral lists and credit agencies. Combining these builds a picture of the population characteristics in different locations. The ''geodemographic'' data that this provides can then be used by marketers to target information towards those that they want to influence. This can be in the form of sales, services or even political information. At heart, geodemographics is just a structured method of making sense of complex socio-economic datasets.

==In the UK==
In 2005 the [[Office for National Statistics|Office for National Statistics (ONS)]] in collaboration with Dan Vickers and [[Phil Rees (academic)|Phil Rees]] of the University of Leeds, released a free small scale social area classification of the UK&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.uk/about/methodology_by_theme/area_classification/oa/default.asp|title=Home - Office for National Statistics|website=www.statistics.gov.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on 2001 UK small area census data. Similar classifications had been developed for earlier censuses, notably by [[Stan Openshaw]] and colleagues at Newcastle and Leeds Universities, but access to these generally was restricted to the academic communities.

The 2005 Output Area Classification (OAC) and the 2013 release of [[Acorn (demographics)|Acorn]] in the UK is a move to 'open geodemographics' and reflects a concern that applications of commercial geodemographics in policy and social research can otherwise be 'black box': it is not always clear exactly what variables were used to classify small areas and to define their neighbourhood type, how those variables were weighted, or how similar (or otherwise) each of the neighbourhoods within a class type actually are. Open geodemographics provides such information (because it is not constrained by commercial interests) and is an important development for applied social research that also seeks to understand and to explain the roots causes or processes that generate aggregate spatial patterns of social behaviour and attitudes. The Output Area Classification is now supported by a user group [http://www.opengeodemographics.com/ here].  CACI have also released detailed documentation on how their classification utilizes Open Data [http://acorn.caci.co.uk/what-is-acorn here].

Geodemographic profiles have widened their application in the UK, with many life insurance companies and pension funds using them to assess longevity for pricing and reserving.&lt;ref name=insurance&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/british-actuarial-journal/article/applying-survival-models-to-pensioner-mortality-data/A16087FBD111D696E44F1220B2D15CDE|title=Applying Survival Models to Pensioner Mortality Data|first=S. J.|last=Richards|publisher=|journal=British Actuarial Journal|volume=14|issue=2|pages=257–303|via=Cambridge Core|doi=10.1017/S1357321700001720}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Australia==
In [[Australia]], general purpose geodemographic systems summarises a broad range of profiling data, largely derived from the [[Census in Australia|Australian Census]] to create a thumbnail sketch of the type of people living in a particular small area. These small areas are either CCD (Census Collection District)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080607093533/http://www.marketfind.com.au/index.php?action=help|url=http://www.marketfind.com.au/index.php?action=help |title=CATEGORIES OF FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS (FAQ)|archivedate=2008-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a sub-CD area, like a Meshblock.

The types of characteristics mainly taken into account in geodemographic system construction are:
* [[Population pyramid|Age distribution]];
* [[Socioeconomic status]] indicators like income, education, and occupational status;
*Household and family composition;
*Cultural factors, such as ethnicity, language spoken, country of birth, and (but not limited to) religion;
*Employment factors, such as type of job, type of industry, and hours of work;
*Household economic factors, like indebtedness, investments, and poverty;
*Regional factors (e.g. whether the resided area is classified as [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]], provincial, or sparsely settled), and;
*Residential stability.

In 1987, geodemographic systems were first introduced as social analysis tools with CCN's (later [[Experian]]) introduction of the MOSAIC system. In 1990, RDA Research built their first system, geoSmart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rdaresearch.com.au/resources.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105215826/http://www.rdaresearch.com.au/resources.php |archivedate=2009-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Geodemographics has drawn critical attention. Some focus on the possible discriminatory and intrusive effects of geodemographic practices. Others wonder whether members of geodemographic groups really are sufficiently alike to be analysed together. The generally unknown variance within geodemographic groupings makes it difficult to assess the significance of trends found in data.
This may not matter for commercial and service planning applications but is of some concern for public sector and social research. A way forward is to integrate geodemographics with more statistical frameworks of analysis, using multilevel methods for example.

'''Gideon Ezra''' ({{lang-he|גדעון עזרא}}, 30 June 1937 – 17 May 2012) was an [[Israel]]i politician. He served as a member of the [[Knesset]] for [[Likud]] and [[Kadima]] between 1996 and 2012, and also held several ministerial portfolios.

==Biography==
Ezra's family came originally as immigrants from [[Iraq]] and settled in [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]]. He was born in [[Jerusalem]] and served in the [[Israeli Defense Force]] between 1955 and 1958 in the [[Nahal]]. He studied geography and political science at the [[University of Haifa]]. He worked for the [[Shin Bet]] from 1962 to 1995. After leaving the service, he served as an advisor to then Minister of Internal Security, [[Moshe Shahal]].

===Political career===
Ezra was elected to the Knesset in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1996|1996 elections]] on the [[Likud]] list, and retained his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1999|1999]] and [[Israeli legislative election, 2003|2003 elections]]. After [[Ariel Sharon]] beat [[Ehud Barak]] in the [[Israeli prime ministerial election, 2001|2001 election for Prime Minister]], Ezra was appointed Deputy Minister of Internal Security. He was given his first full ministerial position after the 2003 elections when appointed Minister in the Ministry of the Prime Minister's Office. When [[Binyamin Elon]] was sacked as [[Tourism Minister of Israel|Minister of Tourism]] in July 2004, Ezra replaced him, initially as Acting Minister (the position was made permanent at the end of August). From September 2004 he also held the position of Acting [[Internal Security Minister of Israel|Minister of Internal Security]] after [[Tzachi Hanegbi]] resigned in the face of corruption allegations. This ministerial post was also made permanent in November, and Ezra oversaw the evacuation of the [[Amona, Mateh Binyamin|Amona]] settlement in February 2006. In November 2005 he was attacked during a rally in [[Sderot]] against [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]] over his support for it.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120708212002/http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1130954356981&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull "Anything is possible"], ''Jerusalem Post'', 8 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005 he was replaced as Tourism Minister by [[Avraham Hirschson]]. When Sharon founded [[Kadima]] in late 2005, Ezra joined him, picking up the Environment Ministry portfolio from Labor's [[Shalom Simhon]]. After the [[Israeli legislative election, 2006|2006 elections]] he was appointed Minister of Environmental Protection by [[Ehud Olmert]]. In April 2007 he opposed plans to build a solar energy plant near [[Dimona]] to avoid harm to a nature reserve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/850922.html "Environment chief: New clean energy site would harm rare species"], Haaretz, 20 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He has also overseen the expansion of [[container deposit legislation]] to cover 1.5 litre bottles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/821690.html Government expands deposit law to include 1.5 liter bottles] Haaretz, 4 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

He retained his seat again in the [[Israeli legislative election, 2009|2009 elections]], having been placed twelfth on the Kadima list. However, he lost his place in the cabinet as the Likud-led coalition formed the government. On 17 May 2012, aged 74, Ezra died of lung cancer after a two-year battle with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4230417,00.html|title=MK Gideon Ezra dies at   74, ''Israel News''|publisher=Ynetnews.com|date=20 June 1995|accessdate=17 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[Akram Hasson]].

A '''governorate''' is an [[administrative division]] of a country. It is headed by a [[governor]]. As [[English-speaking]] nations tend to call regions administered by governors either [[State (administrative division)|states]] or [[provinces]], the term ''governorate'' is often used in translation from non-English-speaking administrations.

The most common usage is as a translation of the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''''[[Muhafazah]]'''''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Law|first1=Gwillim|title=Administrative Subdivisions of Countries: A Comprehensive World Reference, 1900 Through 1998|date=November 23, 1999|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-6097-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also refer to the '''''[[guberniya]]''''' and ''[[Governor-General|general-gubernatorstvo]]'' of [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] or the 34 '''''[[:es:Categoría:Gobernaciones indianas|gobernaciones]]''''' of [[Spanish Empire|Imperial Spain]].

==Arab countries==
The term governorate is widely used in Arab countries to describe an administrative unit. Some governorates combine more than one ''[[wilayah]]''; others closely follow traditional boundaries inherited from the [[Ottoman Empire]]'s ''[[vilayet]]'' system.

With the exception of Tunisia, all translations into the term governorate originate in the Arabic word ''[[muhafazah]]''.

== Portuguese Empire ==
In the [[Portuguese Empire]], a governorate general ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: ''governo-geral'') were a colonial administration. They usually were created in order to be a centralized government over smaller colonies or territories of the Portuguese Empire.

Governorate Generals of the Portuguese Empire:
*[[Governorate General of Brazil]] (1549-1572 / 1578-1607 / 1613-1621)
*[[Governorate General of Bahia]] (1572-1578 / 1607-1613)
*[[Governorate General of Rio de Janeiro]] (1572-1578 / 1607-1613)

== Spanish Empire ==
In the [[Spanish Empire]], the ''gobernaciones'' ("governorships" or "governorates") were an administrative division, roughly analogous to a [[province]] directly beneath the level of the ''[[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]'' or [[Captaincy|captaincy general]], and the [[viceroy]] in areas directly under the viceroy's administration. The powers and duties of a [[governor]] were identical to a ''[[Corregidor (position)|corregidor]]'' but a governor managed a larger or more prosperous area than the former.

* [[Governorates of Italian East Africa]]

==Germany==
In today's [[States of Germany|German states]] of [[Baden-Württemberg]], [[Free State of Bavaria|Bavaria]], [[Hesse]], and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], there are - and earlier in many more German states there were - sub-state administrative regions called ''[[Regierungsbezirk]]'', which is sometimes translated into English as governorate. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

During the time of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], a "[[General Government]] for the Occupied Polish Areas" (German: ''Generalgouvernement für die besetzten polnischen Gebiete'') existed. The German (based on a traditional [[Prussia]]n term) is sometimes translated as ''General Governorate''.

== Romania ==
During World War II, [[Romania]] administrated three governorates: [[Bessarabia Governorate (Romania)|Bessarabia Governorate]], [[Bukovina Governorate]] and [[Transnistria (World War II)|Transnistria Governorate]].

==Vatican City==
Under the [[Fundamental Law of Vatican City State]], the [[pope]]'s [[executive authority]] for [[Vatican City]] is exercised by the Governorate for Vatican City State.

'''Heinrich Bünting''' (1545 &amp;ndash; 1606) was a [[Protestant]] pastor and theologian. He is best known for his book of woodcut maps titled ''Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae'' (Travel book through Holy Scripture) first published in 1581.

==Life==
Bünting was born in [[Hannover, Germany]], in 1545. He studied theology at the [[University of Wittenberg]] graduating in   1569 and became a Protestant pastor in [[Lemgo]]. He was dismissed in 1575 and moved to [[Gronau an der Leine]]. In 1591 he was appointed [[Superintendent (ecclesiastical)|superintendent]] in [[Goslar]]. When a dispute arose over his teachings in 1600 he was dismissed and retired from the ministry. He spent the rest of his life as a private citizen in Hannover.&lt;ref name=wdl&gt;{{cite web|title=Description of the Holy Land|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/2891/|publisher=World Digital Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yu&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Places, Fanciful Visions|url=http://www.library.yale.edu/MapColl/oldsite/map/curious.html|publisher=Yale University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae''==
His collection of woodcut maps, ''Itinerarium Sacrae Scripturae'', first published in [[Magdeburg]] in 1581, was a very popular book in its day.&lt;ref name="BarberBarnes2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Peter Barber|author2=Katherine Barnes|author3=Dr Nigel Erskine|title=Mapping Our World: Terra Incognita To Australia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZ_sAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA87|year=2013|publisher=National Library of Australia|isbn=978-0-642-27809-8|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reprinted and translated several times. The book provided the most complete summary of biblical geography available and described the [[Holy Land]] by following the travels of various notable people from the Old and New Testaments. In addition to conventional maps, the book also contained three figurative maps; [[Bünting Clover Leaf Map|the world depicted using a cloverleaf design]] thought to possibly represent the [[Trinity]] with [[Jerusalem]] in the center, Europe in the form of a crowned and robed woman, and Asia as the winged horse [[Pegasus]].&lt;ref name=wdl/&gt;&lt;ref name=yu/&gt;&lt;ref name=jacob&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=Christian|title=The sovereign map: theoretical approaches in cartography throughout history|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-38953-0|pages=141, 401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Highway authority''' is the name that may be given to a body responsible for the administration of public roads.

==India==
The [[National Highways Authority of India]] is the national authority for the management of a network of over 60,000&amp;nbsp;km of national highways in India. The Authority is a part of the Ministry of Shipping, Road Transport and Highways.

==Malaysia==
Lembaga Lebuhraya Malaysia (LLM) or [[Malaysian Highway Authority]] is a government agency under the Malaysian Ministry of Works. The agency was founded in 1980 to build the North-South Expressway, but now the main function of Malaysian Highway Authority is to monitor the works and administration of expressways in Malaysia as subject to Federal Roads Act (Private Managements) 1984.

==Pakistan==
The [[National Highway Authority (Pakistan)|National Highway Authority]] is responsible for building and maintaining highways and motorways in Pakistan. 

==United Kingdom==
In the [[United Kingdom]] a highway authority is an organisation that is responsible for the maintenance of public roads. The current role of a highway authority is defined in the [[Highways Act 1980]] and the role is held by a large number of different groups.

===Who are the highway authorities?===
In England, Scotland, and Wales the highway authorities for [[trunk road]]s (which include all [[motorway]]s) are, respectively, [[Highways England]], [[Transport Scotland]], and the [[Welsh Government]].

For all other roads and public rights of way, the Highway Authority is usually the [[county council]] or [[unitary authority]] for a particular area. [[Non-metropolitan district|District council]]s may carry out some of the functions of a highway authority, but these are usually delegated to them by their county council. Transport for London is  the highway authority for all GLA roads (under the Highways Act 1980).

{{See also|Local government in the United Kingdom}} ''for more information on unitary authorities and county and district councils.''

===Duties of a highway authority===
Provided below is an incomplete list of duties of the highway authorities.

* To maintain all highways classed as being "maintainable at public expense" that fall within their area of control.
* To maintain records of all "highways maintainable at public expense" within their area of control.
* To regulate the activities of developers in relation to their highways.

==United States==
In the U.S., a highway authority is now usually called a [[List of U.S. state and insular area departments of transportation|department of transportation]], owing to the expanded responsibility for [[mass transport]] like [[passenger rail]] and even [[airport]]s and [[ferry]] service.  Some [[U.S. state]]s also have separate highway authorities for [[toll road]]s, sometimes the responsibility of a [[regional government]] or [[metropolitan government]] rather than a [[state government]].

For example, the [[Illinois State Toll Highway Authority]] is an instrumentality and administrative agency of the State of [[Illinois]]. The Authority has the power to collect and raise tolls, and is responsible for the maintenance and construction of tollway roads and related [[road sign|sign]]age (including [[variable-message sign|electronic message board]]s, used for driving-time notices, [[Amber Alert]]s, and other notifications). The Tollway also supervises and manages the seven [[Illinois Tollway]] oases ([[rest area]]s).  The [[Illinois DOT]] manages other [[state road]]s.

Hofer's first book, published in 1970, was based on the island of [[Bali]], and was funded by a local [[hotel]]. From there, he grew his business, creating over 400 guide books to over 100 destinations. In the late 1990s, he sold his share of the company to [[Langenscheidt]] KG.

'''MidCity Huntsville''' is a mixed use retail development center currently being built in Huntsville, Alabama on the corner of [[University Drive]] ([[US 72]]) and [[Research Park Boulevard]] (SR-255) on the land formerly used for [[Madison Square Mall]]. It is expected to be completed in 2022.
MidCity’s first official phase opened with [[Topgolf]] and a preview center/entertainment venue called The Camp at MidCity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thorton|first1=William|url=http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2017/12/first_phase_of_midcity_taking.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
===2017===
The former Madison Square Mall property was sold to The Grove LLC for $5 Million in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2015/04/report_struggling_madison_squa.html&lt;/ref&gt; After two more years of business, the mall was closed and began demolition in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waff.com/story/34366260/final-days-of-madison-square-mall&lt;/ref&gt; 
Demolition lasted several months, concluding sometime in June. 
As demolition began to slow down, construction of [[Topgolf]] began in April.
In June, it was announced that High Point Climbing and Fitness would be coming to Midcity Huntsville, with construction beginning sometime in the fall.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2017/06/high_point_climbing_and_fitnes.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
A smaller project, The Camp at Midcity, which is a small music and arts venue, was developed on the former Lone Star Grill property. It opened on August 9.&lt;ref&gt;https://thecamphuntsville.com/event/fireside-music-festival/&lt;/ref&gt;
Topgolf opened December 22, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://press.topgolf.com/2017-12-18-Topgolf-Opens-Friday-in-Huntsville&lt;/ref&gt;  

===2018===
In February 2018, it was announced that [[Dave and Busters]] would be opening sometime in July 2019.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.al.com/business/index.ssf/2018/02/dave_busters_coming_to_huntsvi.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://whnt.com/2018/02/26/new-developments-and-new-restaurants-coming-to-huntsville/&lt;/ref&gt;
There was also the announcement of a [[Wahlburgers]] opening sometime in the future as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://whnt.com/2018/02/26/new-developments-and-new-restaurants-coming-to-huntsville/&lt;/ref&gt; 
In March 2018, it was announced that RCP companies had brought in Mark Taft to plan multiple restaurants and eating locations throughout Midcity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/news/2018/03/15/several-food-concepts-restaurants-planned-for.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mushroom stones''', or '''mushroom rocks''', in Ireland are [[limestone]] boulders undercut by past weathering regimes. These rocks take the form of solitary sentinels of limestone which still bear the unmistakable marks of long-continued [[erosion]] by ice, soil or lapping waves at the edge of lakes which have since vanished or retreated. These stones are sometimes shaped like [[mushroom]]s, others have an overhang facing in just one direction, but all are notched and undercut in such a fashion as to suggest prolonged exposure to standing water at some time in the past. The mushroom-shaped stones are produced where the notching forms a fairly even circle around the stone.

Where a limestone boulder stands at the edge of a lake so that it is partly covered by water, the underwater part weathers more rapidly than the part above water because it is subject to more constant corrosion by water, accentuated by the abrasive lapping action of waves. If this continues for a long time the upper part will be undercut, and the stone will assume a very distinctive form which is frequently mushroom-like. Much more rarely the same process can be seen in limestone bedrock. Many mushroom stones have a second minor ‘lip’ below the main one, suggesting that the drop in water level which isolated the stones from the lake’s edge took place in two stages.

==Ireland==
The wavestones in Ireland are always of [[limestone]]: generally isolated boulders which are often [[glacial erratic]]s, or (much more rarely) exposed outcrop.
In [[Ireland]], wave stones were first recorded in 1865 by F.J. Foot along the shores of [[Lough Ree]], during the course of field work for the first systematic geological survey of Ireland. He made a drawing of these water-worn limestone blocks ‘eroded up to a certain height by the solvent action of former lake water, showing the level at which Lough Ree once stood – 10 to 15 feet higher than the present summer height: the lake shore, moreover, is now some 300 yards distant.’ To date, wavestones have been recorded in Counties Offaly, Tipperary, Galway, Clare, Cork, Limerick, Roscommon and Westmeath (see map below in External Links).



Not all mushroom stones are situated close to modern lakes. Many mark the shores of lakes which have vanished altogether, becoming filled in with reedswamp, [[fen]] and [[bog]] vegetation in the course of time. A remarkable example is located near Crancreagh Bridge in County [[Offaly]], which marks the position of what must have been the north-western edge of ancient [[Lough Boora]], on whose shores the first people of the [[Irish midlands]] camped in [[Mesolithic]] times 8,500 or so years ago. This ancient lake disappeared long ago, swamped by the growing expanse of bog, which buried not only the lake itself, but preserved the campsites of the early midlanders.

==Ireland's wavestones==

No scientific evidence has been published to verify that the Irish wavestones have formed in lakes. Furthermore, no wavestones have been described from present-day lakes in Ireland, which is puzzling as parts of the country, such as The Burren, are studded with lakes containing many partly-submerged Carboniferous limestone erratics. A requirement for limestone solution is that water must essentially be ‘acidic’ (pH below 7). Yet, a study of six wavestone sites in Ireland, namely Ballard Bridge, Cornaseer, Creevagh, Gortlecka, Killinaboy and Rinnamona, found that nearby lakes, in which the wavestones are said to have formed, are ‘alkaline' (pH above 7) with a pH range from 7.6 to 8.5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parry|first1=B|title=Ireland’s wavestones: an appraisal of their development.|journal=Irish Journal of Earth Sciences|date=2015|volume=33|pages=17–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the water in three of the lakes, Loughs Gealáin and Ree, and Rinnamona Lough, is so alkaline that marl (lime mud) is being precipitated. The alkalinity of the lake water means that it would cushion limestone against solution rather than dissolve it. This (and other field evidence, such as wavestone morphology) indicates that the wavestones at these six sites have not formed in lakes.

There is ample evidence that undercutting of limestone can result from solution in soil that abuts rock,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Parry|first1=B.|title=Pedestal formation and surface lowering in the Carboniferous Limestone of Norber and Scales Moor, Yorkshire, UK.|journal=Cave and Karst Science|date=2008|volume=34|pages=61–68}}&lt;/ref&gt; and measurements of soil water at the six sites showed that it is ‘acidic’ (pH below 7) with a pH range from 5.3 to 6.8. It has been noted that the Irish landscape has been profoundly altered by drainage operations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feehan|first1=J|title=Looking for footprints: clues to human settlement in the pre-archeological landscape.|journal=The Other Clare|date=2001|volume=25|pages=70–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; that signs of peat cutting are common in the Burren fens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Proctor|first1=M. C. F.|title=Environmental and vegetational relationships of lakes, fens and turloughs in the Burren.|journal=Biology and Environment: Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy|date=2010|volume=110B|issue=1|pages=17–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that extensive deforestation has occurred in Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ivimey-Cook|first1=B. R.|last2=Proctor|first2=M. C. F.|title=The plant communities of the Burren, Co. Clare.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy|date=1966|volume=64|pages=211–302}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which can lead to a lowering of the land surface. For instance, the ground in [[Holme, Cambridgeshire|Holme Fen]], England, subsided by 1.8m in the first decade after its initial drainage in 1851, a figure that is typical of initial peat subsidence rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waltham|first1=A. C.|title=The Holme Post|journal=Mercian Geologist.|date=2001|volume=15|pages=49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, it is proposed that the wavestones at the six sites were undercut by soil water when soil levels were higher than today. It follows, therefore, that the studied wavestones are not, in fact, ‘wavestones'. More accurately, they are mushroom rocks that have formed in a terrestrial setting.

Three examples of ‘wavestones’ that illustrate mushroom rock formation in a lost-soil environment and a mid-lake, non-undercut Carboniferous limestone erratic occur respectively at Gortlecka, Creevagh and Cornaseer, and in [[Inchiquin Lough]].

The base of the ‘wavestone’ at Gortlecka (Plate 1) is winter-flooded by Lough Gealáin (pH 8.2), and the horizontal surface of the water contrasts strongly with the sloping and undulating lip. The lake water pH and lip shape both signify that formation cannot have occurred in the lake. Instead, the sharply-defined lip marks the former level of the (undulating) soil surface, below which solution by soil water (pH 6.0) occurred.

In contrast, the ‘wavestone’ at Creevagh (Plate 2), which occurs inside a meander of the river Shannon (pH 8.3), seems an obvious candidate for formation in a lake since its lip is horizontal. The lake surface, though, would have to remain at exactly the same height for a remarkably long period to create such a lip, while wave-splash would lead to a rounding of its edges. It is probable that sub-soil solution (pH 5.4) is occurring beneath the coarse grass that abuts the limestone in the foreground. If this is long-continued it would eventually lead to the formation of a dipping lip akin to that on the ‘wavestone’ at Gortlecka.

The ‘wavestone' at Cornaseer (Plate 3) is regarded as being the ‘type’ model,&lt;ref&gt;Parkes, M., Meehan, R. &amp; Préteseille, S. (2012): The Geological Heritage of Roscommon. An audit of County Geological Sites in Roscommon. Geological Survey of Ireland. Unpublished Report. P1-34.&lt;/ref&gt; and its yawning undercut (mean 80&amp;nbsp;cm deep) is a significant feature. If the undercut had resulted from solution in Lough Ree (pH 8.5) then similar undercutting ought to be present elsewhere alongside the lough at the same height (about 40m above O.D.). None, however, was found, which indicates that solution at Cornaseer was a local phenomenon. It is perhaps significant that the word ‘Bog’ occurs some 300m west of the site on an 1865 survey map and equally significant that the bog no longer exists due to drainage. The mean pH of soil water at Cornaseer is 5.3 and that of  neighbouring Clooncraff Bog is 5.8. The three lips represent successive lowering of the soil surface.

The Cahir Rock (Plate 4) is a large Carboniferous limestone erratic found in Inchiquin Lough (pH 7.8), which shows no sign of notching by lake water. Nevertheless, solution in a more extensive lake is held responsible for the notching of the ‘wavestones’ at Killinaboy (soil water pH 5.7) some 1&amp;nbsp;km to the north. Killinaboy lies several metres above the present-day lake level, but Cahir Rock cannot have been overtopped by Inchiquin Lough because its upper surface is etched with rillenkarren, which are a sub-aerial solutional landform

It has been pointed out that mushroom-shaped rocks close-to and far-from lakes in Ireland are similarly-shaped,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunne|first1=L|last2=Feehan|first2=J|title=Ireland’s mushroom stones: relics of a vanished lakeland.|date=2003|publisher=Environmental Resource Management, University College Dublin|location=Dublin|isbn=1-902277-79-1|pages=1–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus the obvious question of whether all of Ireland’s mushroom-shaped rocks have developed in a sub-soil environment remains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6584">The '''National Codification Bureaus''' or '''NATO Codification Bureaux''' (NCB) are a NATO organization that oversees the management of the [[NATO Codification System|National Codification System]] (NCS). It is governed by NATO Allied Committee 135 (AC/135), with each member nation's National Codification Bureau controlling and issuing its own unique National Stock Numbers. NATO or European Union membership is not required to do so. Non-NATO (or "Partner") countries can be allowed to join if recommended, vetted, and approved by AC/135.  

Countries that participate in the National Codification System (NCS) follow common standards and techniques to assign National Stock Numbers (NSNs) to items of supply in their defense inventory. The National Codification Bureau (NCB) within each country centrally assigns their national NSNs. The assignment of an NSN denotes a distinctive item of supply; to eliminate confusion, the number will never be re-used.

==[[National Stock Number]]==
The ''National Stock Number'' (NSN) system was implemented by the United States on September 30, 1974, replacing the United States' [[Federal Stock Number]] system (1949-1974). It was managed by the Defense Integrated Data System in 1975. 

All NSNs are uniform in composition, length, and structure. Each is represented by a 13-digit number (in the format: 1234-56-789-10/11/12/13), which can be divided into two parts:

===NATO Supply Classification Group===
The first four digits are the '''NATO Supply Classification Group (NSCG)''' code. This relates the item to the '''NATO Supply Group''' (digits 1 &amp; 2) and '''NATO Supply Class''' (digits 3 &amp; 4) of similar items that it belongs to. For examples, see ''[[List of NATO Supply Classification Groups]]''.

===[[National Item Identification Number]]=== 
The next 9 digits make up the '''National Item Identification Number / NATO Item Identification Number (NIIN)'''. The NIIN has lately become alphanumeric (digits and uppercase letters) due to the vast array of items in the NSN, recently adopting the use of the uppercase letter C in place of "12" in 2000. 

The first two digits indicate the assigning country's NCB code - also informally called a "''Country Code''" or "''Nation Code''". Each country has its own two-digit NCB code, which were granted in the order the NCB system was adopted by that country. The United Kingdom (99), Australia (66) and New Zealand (98) are the exceptions; as a courtesy they were granted their status before the rest of NATO reviewed and accepted the NCB. The United States uses "00" and "01" because they invented the system and were using it before the rest of NATO. NCB code "00" generally indicates an item in US inventory before 1974 (when the NSN was adopted by the US) and "01" usually indicates an item placed in US inventory after 1974. Canada's NCB "20" and "21" have a similar purpose. The numbers "02" through "10" are unassigned to reserve future catalog numbers for the United States' use. NATO-issue items use "11" and United Nations-issue items use "44". The number 69 was assigned but is no longer registered in use - perhaps belonging to a controversial partner like Taiwan or Iraq.   

The final seven digits (dubbed the "non-significant number" - but used without an acronym to avoid it being confused with the "NATO Stock Number") are random. They indicate the code number for the unique item in that country's inventory. It will never be reused or changed to avoid confusion. The seven digits of the "non-significant number" are divided into parts by a hyphen; the first three digits are the interfix number of the batch of code numbers and the last four digits are the unique code number of the item.

==[[Federal Stock Number]]==
The '''Federal Stock Number (FSN)''' was the codification system used by the US Government from 1957 to 1974. It was 11 digits long and was the same number as the NSN (see [[National Stock Number]]), minus the two-digit NCB code. The digits "00" were later added in the place of the NCB digits to virtually all FSN numbers to create compliant American 13-digit NSN numbers.

The FSN was officially replaced by the [[National Stock Number]] beginning on September 30, 1974.

'''Occator''' {{IPAc-en|Q|'|k|ei|t|@r}}&lt;!--The A is long &amp; therefor stressed in Latin--&gt; is an [[impact crater]] located on [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] that contains "Spot 5", the brightest of the [[bright spots on Ceres|bright spots]] observed by the [[Dawn (spacecraft)|Dawn spacecraft]]. It was known as "Region A" in ground-based images taken by the [[W. M. Keck Observatory]] on [[Mauna Kea]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20140122"&gt;{{cite web |author=Kupper|title=PIA17831: Water Detection on Ceres |url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA17831 |date=22 January 2014 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=30 July 2015 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crater was named after [[Occator (mythology)|Occator]], the Roman god of the [[harrow (tool)|harrow]] and a helper to Ceres.&lt;ref name="USGS-20150706" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USGS-20150713-pdf" /&gt;

On 9 December 2015, scientists reported that the [[bright spots on Ceres]], including those in Occator crater, may be related to a type of salt, particularly a form of [[brine]] containing [[magnesium sulfate]] [[Sulfate minerals|hexahydrite]] (MgSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O); the spots were also found to be associated with [[Clay|ammonia-rich clays]].&lt;ref name="NASA-20151209-el"&gt;{{cite web |last=Landau |first=Elizabeth |title=New Clues to Ceres' Bright Spots and Origins |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4785 |date=9 December 2015 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=10 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, on 29 June 2016, scientists reported the bright spot to be mostly [[sodium carbonate]] ({{chem|Na|2|CO|3}}), implying that hydrothermal activity was probably involved in creating the bright spots.&lt;ref name="NASA-20160629"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Landau |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Greicius |first2=Tony |title=Recent Hydrothermal Activity May Explain Ceres' Brightest Area |url=http://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/recent-hydrothermal-activity-may-explain-ceres-brightest-area |date=29 June 2016 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=30 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="De Sanctis2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Sanctis|first1=M.

The bright dome in the center of the crater is named ''[[Cerealia]] [[Facula]]'',&lt;ref name=CF/&gt; and the group of thinner bright spots to the east are named ''[[Vinalia]] Faculae''.&lt;ref name=VF/&gt; In July 2018, NASA released a comparison of physical features, including Occator crater, found on Ceres with similar ones present on Earth.&lt;ref name="NASA-20180724"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Landau |first1=Elizabeth |last2=McCartney |first2=Gretchen |title=What Looks Like Ceres on Earth? |url=https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7196 |date=24 July 2018 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=25 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Odin''' is a Swedish [[satellite]] working in two disciplines: [[astrophysics]] and [[aeronomy]], and it was named after [[Odin]] of [[Norse mythology]]. Within the field of astrophysics, Odin was used until the spring of 2007 aiding in the study of [[star formation]]. Odin is still used for aeronomical observations, including exploration of the [[Ozone depletion|depletion of the ozone layer]] and [[effects of global warming]]. In February 2016 it celebrated 15 years in Earth orbit, and was still functioning nominally.&lt;ref&gt;[https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/missions/3rd-party-missions/current-missions/odin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asc-csa.gc.ca/eng/satellites/odin.asp]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The main instrument on Odin is a [[radiometer]] using a 1.1 m telescope, designed to be used for both the astronomy and aeronomy missions. The radiometer works at 486–580&amp;nbsp;GHz and at 119&amp;nbsp;GHz. The second instrument on board is the [[Odin-OSIRIS|OSIRIS]] (Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snsb.se/en/Home/Space-Activities-in-Sweden/Satellites/Odin/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418122917/http://www.snsb.se/en/Home/Space-Activities-in-Sweden/Satellites/Odin/ |archivedate=2013-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Odin was developed by the Space Systems Division of [[Swedish Space Corporation]] (now [[OHB Sweden]]) as part of an international project involving the space agencies of Sweden ([[Swedish National Space Board|SNSB]]), Finland ([[Tekes (agency)|TEKES]]), Canada ([[Canadian Space Agency|CSA]]) and France ([[CNES]]). Odin was launched on a [[START-1]] rocket on February 20, 2001 from [[Svobodny (launch site)|Svobodny]], [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.snsb.se/en/Home/Space-Activities-in-Sweden/Satellites/Odin/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130418122917/http://www.snsb.se/en/Home/Space-Activities-in-Sweden/Satellites/Odin/ |archivedate=2013-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, astronomers announced that Odin had made the first ever detection of molecular [[oxygen]] ({{chem|O|2}}) in interstellar clouds.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/04/070417080835.htm Molecular Oxygen Detected For The First Time In The Interstellar Medium].

      <comment>Unsourced and debatable; the area in the Scottish Borders is not officially part of the Pennines and most people would consider that area part of the Southern Uplands. Please read the second paragraph in the lead and the third paragraph in the geography section as they do somewhat clarify the defined area a bit, and if you disagree with this edit, please discuss in talk page.</comment>

[[File:Stanage Edge.jpg|left|thumb|[[Stanage Edge]] in the [[Peak District]]]]
Various etymologies have been proposed treating "Pennine" as though it were a native [[Common Brittonic|Brittonic]]/Modern [[Welsh language|Welsh]] name related to ''[[wikt:pen#Welsh|pen-]]'' ("head") .{{refn|[[Margaret Gelling|Gelling]], cited by Redmonds&lt;ref name="Redmonds"/&gt;}} In fact, it did not become a common name until the 18th century and almost certainly derives from modern comparisons with the [[Apennine Mountains]], which run down the middle of [[Italy]] in a similar fashion.&lt;ref name="Redmonds"&gt;{{Citation|last=Redmonds |first=George|contribution=A Major Place-Name Ignored|title=Names and History: People, Places, and Things |publisher=Hambledon &amp; London |location=London |publication-date=2004 |pages=65–68 |isbn=1-85285-426-X |ref=harv |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qxk8qK2uF7kC&amp;pg=PA65 |date=15 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an 1853 article by [[Arthur Hussey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hussey|first=Arthur|editor-last=Cave|editor-first=Edward|editor-link=Edward Cave |contribution=A Renewed Examination of 'Richard of Cirencester' |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DboUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA272 |title=The Gentleman's Magazine |volume=XXXIX |publication-place=London |publisher=[[John Bowyer Nichols|J.B. Nichols]] &amp;&amp;nbsp;Son |publication-date=1853 |pages=270–273 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; it has become a common belief that the name derives from a passage in ''[[The Description of Britain]]'' ({{lang-la|De Situ Britanniæ}}),{{refn|Route VII: "...&amp;nbsp;This province is divided into two equal parts by a chain of mountains called the Pennine Alps, which rising on the confines of the [[Iceni]] and Carnabii, near the River Trivona &amp;#91;[[River Trent|Trent]]&amp;#93;, extend towards the north in a continued series of fifty [[Roman mile|miles]]&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=bertie&gt;{{Citation| last=Bertram | first=Charles | author-link=Charles Bertram | others= Anonymously translated &amp; annotated by Henry Hatcher | year=1809 | orig-year=First published in 1757 |contribution=Chapter XXXIII |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OwJIAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA51 | title=The Description of Britain, Translated from Richard of Cirencester | publisher=J.&amp;nbsp;White &amp;&amp;nbsp;Co. | publication-place=London | page=51| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} an infamous [[literary forgery|historical forgery]] concocted by [[Charles Bertram]] in the 1740s and accepted as genuine until the 1840s. In 2004, George Redmonds reassessed this, finding that numerous respected writers passed over the origin of the mountains' name in silence even in works dedicated to the topological etymology of [[Derbyshire]] and [[Lancashire]].&lt;ref name="Redmonds"/&gt; He found that the derivation from Bertram was widely believed and considered uncomfortable.&lt;ref name="Redmonds"/&gt; In fact, he found repeated comparisons going back at least as early as [[William Camden|Camden]],{{refn|[[Skipton]], [[William Camden|Camden]] said, was "hidden and enclosed among steep Hilles to Latium in Italie, which Varro supposeth to have been called because it lyeth close under the Apennine and the Alps". He went on to describe how "the North part ... riseth up and swelleth somewhat mountainous, with moores and hilles, but of no bignesse, which beginning here runs like as Apennine doth in Italie, through the middest of England ... even as far as Scotland, although oftentimes they change their name."}} many of whose placenames and ideas Bertram incorporated into his work. Bertram was responsible (at most) with popularizing the name against other contenders such as [[Daniel Defoe]]'s "English Andes".&lt;ref name="Redmonds"/&gt; His own form of the name was the "Pennine Alps" (''{{lang|la|Alpes Peninos}}''), which today is used for [[Pennine Alps|a western section]] of the continental [[Alps]]. Those mountains (the area around the [[Great St Bernard Pass|St. Bernard Pass]]) derive their name from the Latin ''[[Alpes Pœninæ]]'' whose name has been variously derived from the [[Hannibal's crossing of the Alps|Carthaginians]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''History of Rome'', Book&amp;nbsp;V, §35.&lt;/ref&gt; a local god,&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''History of Rome'', Book&amp;nbsp;XXXI, §38.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Common Celtic|Celtic]] ''peninus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Dictionary of Continental Celtic Place-Names|editor-first=Alexander|editor-last=Falileyev|publisher=Aberystwyth University|year=2007|title=Summus P(o)eninus|url=http://cadair.aber.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/2160/282/5/ContCelticPNDictionary.pdf|format=pdf|accessdate=2 May 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090731025816/http://cadair.aber.ac.uk/dspace/bitstream/2160/282/5/ContCelticPNDictionary.pdf|archivedate=31 July 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The St. Bernard Pass was the pass used in the [[Campaign history of the Roman military#Celtic invasion of Italia .28390.E2.80.93387 BC.29|invasions of Italy]] by the [[Gauls|Gallic]] [[Boii]] and [[Lingones]] in 390&amp;nbsp;{{sc|bc}}.

Various towns and geographical features within the Pennines retain [[Britons (Celtic people)|Celtic]] names, including [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]], the fell [[Pen-y-ghent]], the [[River Eden, Cumbria|River Eden]], and the area of [[Cumbria]]. More commonly, local names result from later [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Norsemen|Norse]] settlements. In Yorkshire and Cumbria, many words of [[Norse language|Norse]] origin, not commonly used in standard English, are part of everyday speech: for example, ''[[Gill (stream)|gill/ghyll]]'' (narrow steep valley), ''[[beck]]'' (brook or stream), ''[[fell]]'' (hill), and ''[[dale (origin)|dale]]'' (valley).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Gunn | first =Peter | year =1984 | title =The Yorkshire Dales.

==Geography==
[[File:Croasdale Bowland.jpg|thumb|[[Bowland Forest High|Croasdale Fell]], Forest of Bowland.]]
The northern Pennine range is bordered by the [[foothill]]s of the [[Lake District]], and [[Highland|uplands]] of the [[Howgill Fells]] and Cheviot Hills. The Forest of Bowland is a western spur&lt;ref name="Great Britain"/&gt; while the Howgill Fells&lt;ref name="Great Mountain Days in the Pennines: Cicerone Press"/&gt; are sometimes considered to be part of the Pennines. The Pennines are fringed by extensive [[Upland and lowland|lowlands]] including the [[River Eden, Cumbria|Eden Valley]], [[West Lancashire Coastal Plain]], [[Cheshire Plain]], [[Vale of York]], and the [[The Midlands|Midland Plains]].

Most of the Pennine landscape is characterised by upland areas of high [[moorland]] indented by more fertile river valleys, although the landscape varies in different areas. The Peak District consists of hilly plateaus, uplands and valleys, divided into the [[Dark Peak]] with moorlands and gritstone edges, and the [[White Peak]] with limestone gorges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Landscape|url = http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/microsites/sopr/landscape| publisher = Peak District National Park| accessdate = 22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The moorlands of the Dark Peak extend into the South Pennines, a hilly landscape with narrow valleys between the Peak District, Forest of Bowland and Yorkshire Dales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = About the South Pennines|url = http://www.pennineprospects.co.uk/south-pennines| accessdate = 22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bowland is dominated by a central upland landform of deeply incised gritstone [[fell]]s covered with tracts of heather-covered [[peat]] moorland, [[blanket bog]] and steep-sided wooded valleys linking the upland and lowland landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =The Landscape of The Forest of Bowland Area Of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) | publisher = Lancashire County Council| date =6 June 2007 | url =http://www.forestofbowland.com/wild_landscape.asp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207065917/http://www.forestofbowland.com/wild_landscape.asp |archivedate=7 February 2009 | accessdate = 7 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The landscape becomes higher and more mountainous in the Yorkshire Dales and North Pennines. The Yorkshire Dales are characterised by moorlands, river valleys, hills, fells and mountains&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Landscape|url = http://www.yorkshiredales.org.uk/about-the-dales/landscape| publisher = Yorkshire Dales National Park| accessdate = 22 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the North Pennines consist of high upland plateaus, moorlands, fells, edges and valleys with most of the area containing flat topped hills while the higher peaks are in the western half.

Although the Pennines mostly cover the area between the Tyne Gap and the Peak District, the presence of the Pennine Way affects the northern and southern extents of the defined area. The Cheviot Hills, separated by the Tyne Gap and the [[Whin Sill]], along which run the [[A69 road|A69]] and [[Hadrian's Wall]], are not part of the Pennines but, perhaps because the Pennine Way crosses them, they are often treated as such. As a result, the northern end of the Pennines may be considered to be either at the Tyne Gap or the Cheviot Hills across the [[Anglo-Scottish border]]. Conversely the southern end of the Pennines is commonly said to be in the [[High Peak, Derbyshire|High Peak]] of [[Derbyshire]] at [[Edale]], the start of the Pennine Way. However, the range and its foothills continue as far south as [[Stoke-on-Trent]] in northern Staffordshire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CiLen-r2t5QC&amp;pg=PT15&amp;lpg=PT15&amp;dq=pennines+end+at+stoke+on+trent&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JViQF6ut6d&amp;sig=ZrgRVomXSdI9-oyg_KHYV00mTsQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgzb_GyKjOAhVJNhoKHQZNAUIQ6AEIOTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=pennines%20end%20at%20stoke%20on%20trent&amp;f=false|title=Great Mountain days in the Pennines|author=Terry Marsh|accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Derby]] in southern Derbyshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=City Centre Conservation Area |url=https://cmis.derby.gov.uk/CMIS5/Document.ashx?czJKcaeAi5tUFL1DTL2UE4zNRBcoShgo=%2FQkl8clPd5gejUJtMDAkj3LVvRvOVXrtkDRJI%2BVJFAkl%2FwwOU%2FccrA%3D%3D&amp;mCTIbCubSFfXsDGW9IXnlg%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&amp;kCx1AnS9%2FpWZQ40DXFvdEw%3D%3D=hFflUdN3100%3D&amp;uJovDxwdjMPoYv%2BAJvYtyA%3D%3D=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&amp;FgPlIEJYlotS%2BYGoBi5olA%3D%3D=NHdURQburHA%3D&amp;d9Qjj0ag1Pd993jsyOJqFvmyB7X0CSQK=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&amp;WGewmoAfeNR9xqBux0r1Q8Za60lavYmz=ctNJFf55vVA%3D&amp;WGewmoAfeNQ16B2MHuCpMRKZMwaG1PaO=ctNJFf55vVA%3D |website=Derby City Council |publisher=Derby City Council |format=pdf|accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elevation===
Rising less than {{convert|3000|ft|m|-2}}, the Pennines are often referred to as fells, with the majority of mountainous terrain in the north. The highest is [[Cross Fell]] in eastern Cumbria, at {{convert|2930|ft|m|0}}, while other principal peaks at the North Pennines include [[Great Dun Fell]] {{convert|2782|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, [[Mickle Fell]] {{convert|2585|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, and [[Burnhope Seat]] {{convert|2451|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. Principal peaks at the Yorkshire Dales include [[Whernside]] {{convert|2415|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, [[Ingleborough]] {{convert|2372|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, [[High Seat (Yorkshire Dales)|High Seat]] {{convert|2328|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, [[Wild Boar Fell]] {{convert|2324|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and [[Pen-y-ghent]] {{convert|2274|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. Principal peaks at the Forest of Bowland include [[Ward's Stone]] {{convert|1841|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, [[Fair Snape Fell]] {{convert|1710|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, and [[Hawthornthwaite Fell]] {{convert|1572|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}. Although terrain is lower towards the south, principal peaks at the South Pennines and Peak District include [[Kinder Scout]] {{convert|2087|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, [[Bleaklow]] {{convert|2077|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, [[Black Chew Head]] {{convert|1778|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, [[Rombalds Moor]] {{convert|1319|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} and [[Winter Hill (North West England)|Winter Hill]] {{convert|1496|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.

===Drainage===
[[File:Kinder Downfall in spate.jpg|right|thumb|[[River Kinder#Kinder Downfall|Kinder Downfall]], a waterfall on Kinder Scout, Dark Peak]]
For much of their length the Pennines form the main [[water divide|watershed]] in northern England, dividing east and west. The rivers [[River Eden, Cumbria|Eden]], [[River Ribble|Ribble]], [[River Dane|Dane]] and tributaries of the [[River Mersey|Mersey]] (including the [[River Irwell|Irwell]], [[River Tame, Greater Manchester|Tame]] and [[River Goyt|Goyt]]) flow westwards towards the [[Irish Sea]]. On the eastern side of the watershed, the rivers [[River Tyne, England|Tyne]], [[River Tees|Tees]], [[River Wear|Wear]], [[River Swale|Swale]], [[River Ure|Ure]], [[River Nidd|Nidd]], [[River Wharfe|Wharfe]], [[River Aire|Aire]], [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|Calder]] and [[River Don, South Yorkshire|Don]] rise in the region and flow eastwards to the [[North Sea]]. The [[River Trent]], however, rises on the western side of the Pennines before flowing around the southern end of the range and up the eastern side; together with its tributaries (principally the [[River Dove, Central England|Dove]] and [[River Derwent, Derbyshire|Derwent]]) it thus drains both east and west sides of the southern end to the North Sea.

===Climate===

The Pennine climate is generally temperate like that of the rest of England, but the hills have more precipitation, stronger winds and colder weather than the surrounding areas. Higher elevations have a [[tundra climate]].
More snow falls on the Pennines than on surrounding lowland areas due to the elevation and distance from the coast; unlike lowland areas of England, the Pennines can have quite severe winters.

The northwest is amongst the wettest regions of England and much of the rain falls on the Pennines. The eastern side is drier than the west—the [[rain shadow]] shields northeast England from rainfall that would otherwise fall there.

Precipitation is important for the area's biodiversity and human population. Many towns and cities are located along rivers flowing from the hills and in northwest England the lack of natural aquifers is compensated for by reservoirs.

Water has carved out gorges, caves and limestone landscapes in the Yorkshire Dales and Peak District. In some areas precipitation has contributed to poor soils, resulting in part in [[moorland]] landscapes that characterize much of the range. In other areas where the soil has not been degraded, it has resulted in lush vegetation.

For the purpose of growing plants, the Pennines are in [[hardiness zone]]s 7 and 8, as defined by the [[USDA]]. Zone 8 is common throughout most of the UK, and zone 7 is the UK's coldest hardiness zone. The Pennines, [[Scottish Highlands]], [[Southern Uplands]] and [[Snowdonia]] are the only areas of the UK in zone 7.

==Geology==
[[File:Thor's cave.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Limestone scenery: [[Thor's Cave]], Staffordshire, from the Manifold Way. Limestone is common in the White Peak and Yorkshire Dales, making those areas distinct from other parts of the Pennines.]]
The Pennines have been carved from a series of geological structures whose overall form is a broad [[anticline]] whose axis extends in a north–south direction. The North Pennines are coincident with the [[Alston Block]], whilst the Yorkshire Dales are coincident with the [[Askrigg Block]]. In the south the Peak District is essentially a flat-topped dome.
Each of these structures consists of [[Carboniferous]] [[limestone]] overlain with [[Millstone Grit]]. The limestone is exposed at the surface in the North Pennines and Yorkshire Dales to the north of the range and the Peak District to the south. In the Yorkshire Dales and the [[White Peak]] the limestone exposure has led to the formation of large cave systems and watercourses. 

In the Dales the caves or potholes are known as "pots" in the [[Yorkshire dialect and accent|Yorkshire dialect]]. They include some of the largest caves in England at [[Gaping Gill]], more than {{convert|350|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} deep and [[Rowten Pot]], {{convert|365|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} deep. [[Titan (cave)|Titan]] in the Peak District, the deepest shaft known in Britain, is connected to [[Peak Cavern]] in [[Castleton, Derbyshire]], the largest cave entrance in the country. Erosion of the limestone has led to some unusual geological formations, such as the [[limestone pavement]]s at [[Malham Cove]]. Between the northern and southern areas of exposed limestone (between [[Skipton]] and the [[Dark Peak]]) lies a narrow belt of exposed gritstone. Here the shales and sandstones of the Millstone Grit form high hills occupied by a [[moorland]] of [[bracken]], [[peat]], heather and coarse grasses;&lt;ref name="DB"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-400000-441000/page/4 page 4] and [http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/domesday/dblock/GB-400000-441000/page/5 page 5], Marginal Upland Grazing Sutton Moor, Domesday Reloaded, BBC 1986&lt;/ref&gt; the higher ground is uncultivable and barely fit for pasture.

==History==
[[File:Harkerside Moor.jpg|thumb|left|A prehistoric settlement on Harkerside Moor in [[Swaledale]].]]
The area contains many [[Bronze Age]] settlements, and evidence of [[Neolithic]] settlement (including many [[stone circles]] or [[henges]], such as [[Long Meg and Her Daughters]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outofoblivion.org.uk/ |title=A landscape through time |publisher=Out of Oblivion |date= |accessdate=5 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pennines were controlled by the tribal federation of the [[Brigantes]], made up of mainly small tribes who inhabited the area and cooperated on defence and external affairs. The Brigantes evolved an early form of kingdom. During [[Roman Britain|Roman times]], the Brigantes were dominated by the Romans who exploited the Pennines for their natural resources including the wild animals found there.

The Pennines were a major obstacle for [[Anglo-Saxon]] expansion westwards, although it appears the Anglo-Saxons travelled through the valleys. During the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] the Pennines were controlled by Celtic and Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. It is believed that the north Pennines were under the control of the kingdom of [[Rheged]].

During Norse times the Pennines were settled by [[History of Denmark|Viking Danes]] in the east and [[History of Norway|Norwegian Vikings]] in the west. The Vikings influenced place names, culture and genetics. When England was unified the Pennines were incorporated into it.
Their mixture of Celtic, Anglo-Saxon and Viking heritage resembled much of the rest of [[northern England]] and its culture developed alongside its lowland neighbours in northwest and northeast England. The Pennines were not a distinct political [[polity]], but were divided between neighbouring counties in northeast and northwest England; a major part was in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].

==Demography==
The Pennine region is sparsely populated by English standards.  Larger population centres adjoin the southern Pennine range, such as [[Barnsley]], [[Chesterfield]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[Huddersfield]],  [[Macclesfield]], [[Oldham]], [[Rochdale]], and [[Stockport]] but most of the northern Pennine range is thinly populated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mypennines.co.uk/north-pennines/#sthash.0yKQHkOw.dpbs|title=North Pennines|work = My Pennines|accessdate=15 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cities of [[Bradford]], [[Derby]], [[Leeds]], [[Manchester]], [[Sheffield]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and [[Wakefield]] lie in the foothills and lowlands fringing the range.

==Economy==
The main economic activities in the Pennines include [[sheep farm]]ing, [[quarry]]ing, finance and [[tourism]]. In the [[Peak District]], tourism is the major local employment for park residents (24%), with manufacturing industries (19%) and [[Peak District#Quarrying|quarrying]] (12%) also being important while 12% are employed in agriculture.&lt;ref name="Place_called_home"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/index/living-in.htm |title=A place called home |publisher=Peak District |year=2009 |accessdate=5 November 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090519001312/http://www.peakdistrict.gov.uk/index/living-in.htm |archivedate=19 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limestone is the most important mineral quarried, mainly for roads and cement, while other extracted materials include shale for cement and [[gritstone]] for building stone.&lt;ref name="Mineral_factsheet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peakdistrict-nationalpark.info/studyArea/factsheets/11.html#4 |title=Peak District National Park: Study Area |publisher=Peak District National Park |year=2003 |accessdate=5 November 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20050620074557/http://www.peakdistrict-nationalpark.info/studyArea/factsheets/11.html |archivedate=20 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The springs at Buxton and Ashbourne are exploited to produce bottled [[mineral water]] and there are approximately 2,700 farms in the National Park.&lt;ref name="Waugh"&gt;{{cite book |title=Geography An Integrated Approach |last=Waugh |first=D. |year=2000 |edition=3rd |isbn=0-17-444706-X |publisher=[[Wolters Kluwer|Nelson Thornes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South Pennines]] are predominantly industrial, with the main industries including textiles, quarrying and mining,&lt;ref name="South Pennines"&gt;{{cite web|title=South Pennines|url=http://www.walkridesouthpennines.co.uk/about.php|website=Pennine Prospects|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other economic activities within the South Pennines include tourism and farming.&lt;ref name="£1.2m fund available to South Pennines farm businesses"&gt;{{cite web|title=£1.2m fund available to South Pennines farm businesses|url=http://www.fwi.co.uk/business/1-2m-fund-available-to-south-pennines-farm-businessses.htm|website=Farmers Weekly|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transport==
[[File:Gaps through Pennine Mountains UK topographic map.gif|thumb|right|The Pennines are traversed by several passes, mostly aligned with major rivers.]]
Gaps that allow west–east communication across the Pennines include the Tyne Gap between the Pennines and the Cheviots, through which the [[A69 road]] and [[Tyne Valley Line|Tyne Valley railway]] link [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] and [[Newcastle upon Tyne]]. The [[A66 road]], its summit at {{convert|1450|ft}}, follows the course of a [[Roman Britain|Roman]] road from [[Scotch Corner]] to [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] through the [[Stainmore]] Gap between the [[River Eden, Cumbria|Eden Valley]] in Cumbria and [[Teesdale]] in County Durham. The [[Aire Gap]] links Lancashire and Yorkshire via the valleys of the [[River Aire|Aire]] and [[River Ribble|Ribble]]. Other high-level roads include [[Buttertubs Pass]], named from [[limestone]] [[pothole]]s near its {{convert|1729|ft|adj=on}} summit, between [[Hawes]] in [[Wensleydale]] and [[Swaledale]] and the [[A684 road]] from [[Sedbergh]] to Hawes via [[Garsdale Head]] which reaches {{convert|1100|ft}}.&lt;ref name="TPCrossings"&gt;{{citation|title=Transpennine Crossings |url=http://www.sabre-roads.org.uk/wiki/index.php?title=Transpennine_Crossings  |publisher=Sabre roads |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further south the [[A58 road]] traverses the [[Calder Valley]] between [[West Yorkshire]] and [[Greater Manchester]] reaching {{convert|1282|ft}} between Littleborough and [[Ripponden]], while the [[A646 road]] along the Calder Valley between [[Burnley]] and [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]] reaches {{convert|764|ft}} following valley floors. In the South Pennines the [[A628 road|A628]] Woodhead road links the [[M67 motorway]] in Greater Manchester with the [[M1 motorway]] in [[South Yorkshire]] and [[Holme Moss]] is crossed by the [[A6024 road]], whose highest point is near [[Holme Moss transmitting station]] between [[Longdendale]] and [[Holmfirth]].&lt;ref name="TPCrossings"/&gt;

The Pennines are traversed by the [[M62 motorway]], the highest motorway in England at {{convert|1221|ft}} on [[Windy Hill (Pennines)|Windy Hill]] near Junction 23.&lt;ref name="TPCrossings"/&gt;

Three trans-Pennine canals built during the [[Industrial Revolution]] cross the range:
* The [[Huddersfield Narrow Canal]] connects [[Huddersfield]] in the east with [[Manchester]] in the west. When it reaches [[Marsden, West Yorkshire|Marsden]], it passes underneath the hills through the [[Standedge Tunnels|Standedge Tunnel]] to [[Diggle, Greater Manchester|Diggle]]. Fortnightly during the summer season, one can pass through the tunnel on a public narrowboat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://canalrivertrust.org.uk/places-to-visit/standedge-tunnel-and-visitor-centre |title=Standedge Tunnel &amp; Visitor Centre: Opening times and prices |publisher=Canal and River Trust |accessdate=15 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130907224517/http://canalrivertrust.org.uk/standedge-tunnel/visit-us/opening-times-and-prices |archivedate=7 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Rochdale Canal]] crosses the Pennines via [[Rochdale]], connecting the market town of [[Sowerby Bridge]] with Manchester.
* The [[Leeds and Liverpool Canal]], the longest and most northerly of the three, crosses the Pennines via [[Skipton]], Burnley, [[Chorley]] and [[Wigan]] connecting [[Leeds]] in the east with [[Liverpool]] in the west.

At the time of its completion in 1845, Woodhead 1 was one of the world's longest railway tunnels at a length of 3&amp;nbsp;miles 13&amp;nbsp;yards (4,840&amp;nbsp;m); it was the first of several trans-Pennine tunnels including the [[Standedge Tunnels|Standedge]] and [[Totley Tunnel|Totley]] tunnels, which are only slightly longer.
 
The first two tunnels were replaced by Woodhead 3, which was longer than the other two at 3 miles 66 yards (4860m). It was bored purposely for the overhead electrification of the route and completed in 1953. The tunnel was opened by the then transport minister [[Alan Lennox-Boyd, 1st Viscount Boyd of Merton|Alan Lennox-Boyd]] on 3 June 1954.&lt;ref name=RB_W&gt;{{cite web|url=http://railways-of-britain.com/Woodhead.html|title=The Woodhead Route|work=Railways of Britain|accessdate=27 January 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302082848/http://railways-of-britain.com/Woodhead.html|archivedate=2 March 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed by Sir [[William Halcrow]] &amp; Partners.  The line was closed in 1981.

The [[London and North Western Railway]] acquired the Huddersfield and Manchester Railway in 1847 and built a single-line tunnel parallel to the canal tunnel at Standedge with a length of 3 miles, 57 yards (4803 m). Today rail services along the [[Huddersfield Line|Huddersfield line]] between [[Huddersfield railway station|Huddersfield]] and [[Manchester Victoria railway station|Victoria]] and [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Piccadilly]] stations in [[Manchester]] are operated by [[TransPennine Express]] and [[Northern (train operating company)|Northern]]. Between 1869 and 1876 the [[Midland Railway]] built the [[Settle-Carlisle Line]] through remote, scenic regions of the Pennines from near [[Settle, North Yorkshire|Settle]] to [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]] passing [[Appleby-in-Westmorland]] and a number of other settlements, some a distance from their stations. The line has survived, despite difficult times&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=History |url= http://www.settle-carlisle.co.uk/explore-the-line/history/ |publisher=settle-carlisle.co.uk|accessdate=15 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Trans Pennine Trail]], a long-distance route for cyclists, horse riders and walkers, runs west–east alongside rivers and canals, along disused railway tracks and through historic towns and cities from [[Southport]] to [[Hornsea]] ({{convert|207|mi|km|disp=x|/}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.transpenninetrail.org.uk/template.asp?ID=0&amp;parentID=481 |title=Welcome to the Trans Pennine Trail |publisher=transpenninetrail.org.uk |accessdate=14 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019201343/http://www.transpenninetrail.org.uk/template.asp?ID=0&amp;parentID=481 |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It crosses the north–south [[Pennine Way]] ({{convert|268|mi|km|disp=x|/}}) at [[Crowden-in-Longdendale]].

==National Parks and AONBs==
[[File:National Parks in England and Wales.png|thumb|upright=0.86|The National Parks of England and Wales; two include areas of the Pennines, those marked as 7 and 1]]
Considerable areas of Pennine landscape are protected as [[National parks of England and Wales|UK national parks]] and [[Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty]] (AONBs). Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty are afforded much the same protection as national parks. The two national parks within the Pennines are the [[Yorkshire Dales|Yorkshire Dales National Park]] (7) and the [[Peak District|Peak District National Park]] (1).

[[File:AONBSUK.png|right|thumb|England, Wales and Northern Ireland AONBs. The Pennines host three, with a large one protecting the North Pennines.]]

The [[North Pennines]] AONB just north of the Yorkshire Dales rivals the national park in size and includes some of the Pennines' highest peaks and some of its most isolated and sparsely populated areas while  [[Nidderdale]] is an AONB east of the Yorkshire Dales National Park, and the [[Forest of Bowland|Bowland Fells]], including [[Pendle Hill]], is an AONB west of the Yorkshire Dales.

==Language==
The language used in pre-Roman and Roman times was [[Common Brittonic]]. During the [[Early Middle Ages]], the [[Cumbric language]] developed. Little evidence of Cumbric remains, so it is difficult to ascertain whether or not it was distinct from [[Old Welsh language|Old Welsh]]. The extent of the region in which Cumbric was spoken is also unknown.

During [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] times the area was settled by Anglian peoples of [[Mercia]] and [[Northumbria]], rather than the [[Saxon people]] of [[Southern England]]. [[Celtic languages|Celtic speech]] remained in most areas of the Pennines longer than it did in the surrounding areas of England. Eventually, the Celtic tongue of the Pennines was replaced by early [[English language|English]] as Anglo-Saxons and Vikings settled the area and assimilated the Celts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Social History of English|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=dy-EAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA15&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;dq=Celtic+speech+remained+in+most+areas+of+the+Pennines+longer+than+it+did+in+the+surrounding+areas+of+England&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DJg5qyA55s&amp;sig=-cfdvJLta4rtjOlyLMPmcTS70RY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUgqW_pbHXAhVSzKQKHWc9A44Q6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Celtic%20speech%20remained%20in%20most%20areas%20of%20the%20Pennines%20longer%20than%20it%20did%20in%20the%20surrounding%20areas%20of%20England&amp;f=false|page=15|publisher=Dick Leith|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Old Norse|Norse]] times, [[Viking]] settlers brought their languages of Old Norse, [[Danish language|Old Danish]] (mainly in the Yorkshire Dales and parts of the Peak District) and [[Old Norwegian]] (mainly in the western Pennines).{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} With the eventual consolidation of England by the Saxon [[Wessex|kingdom of Wessex]], the pure Norse speech died out in England, though it survived in the Pennines longer than in most areas{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}. However, the fusion of Norse and Old English was important in the formation of [[Middle English]] and hence Modern English, and many individual [[List of English words of Old Norse origin|words of Norse descent]] remain in use in local dialects, such as [[Yorkshire accent and dialect|that of Yorkshire]], and in local place names.

==Folklore and customs==
The folklore and customs are mostly based on [[Celts|Celtic]], [[Anglo-Saxon]] and [[Viking]] customs and folklore.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Many customs and stories have their origin in Christianised pagan traditions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} In the Peak District, a notable custom is [[well dressing]], which has its origin in pagan traditions that became Christianised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ritual Journeys With Great British Goddesses|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=t6xf9nYgsxAC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;dq=peak+district+well+dressing+pagan+traditions+christianised&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SQpJ1qYo6h&amp;sig=zN6c87bdngBPNtInde5F2L27qGs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL9smOo7HXAhXF6qQKHbvaBi4Q6AEIWDAN#v=onepage&amp;q=peak%20district%20well%20dressing%20pagan%20traditions%20christianised&amp;f=false|page=148|publisher=Susie Fox|accessdate=9 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora==
Flora in the Pennines is adapted to [[moorland]] and subarctic landscapes and climates. The flora found there can be found in other areas of moorland in [[Northern Europe]] and some species are also found in areas of [[tundra]].

In the Pennine millstone grit areas above an altitude of {{convert|900|ft}} the topsoil is so acidic, [[pH]] 2 to 4, that it can grow only [[bracken]], [[Ericaceae|heather]],  [[sphagnum]], and coarse grasses&lt;ref name="DB" /&gt; such as [[cottongrass]],  [[Molinia caerulea|purple moor grass]] and [[Juncus|heath rush]].&lt;ref name=kelsall&gt;{{cite book |title=The Yorkshire Dales: South and West|last=Kelsall|first= Dennis |first2=Jan |last2=Kelsall |year=2008 |publisher=Cicerone |location= Milnthorpe |isbn=978-1-85284-485-1 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Ice age]] [[Ice sheet|glacial sheets]] retreated c.&amp;nbsp;11,500 BC trees returned and archaeological [[palynology]] can identify their species.
The first trees to settle were willow, birch and juniper, followed later by alder and pine. By 6500 BC temperatures were warmer and woodlands covered 90% of the dales with mostly pine, elm, lime and oak. On the limestone soils the oak was slower to colonize and pine and birch predominated.
Around 3000 BC a noticeable decline in tree pollen indicates that neolithic farmers were clearing woodland to increase grazing for domestic livestock, and studies at [[Linton, North Yorkshire|Linton Mires]] and [[Eshton|Eshton Tarn]] find an increase in grassland species.&lt;ref name=landcape&gt;{{Cite book | last=White | first=Robert | title=The Yorkshire Dales, A landscape Through Time | origyear=1997 | edition=new | year=2005 | publisher=Great Northern Books | location=Ilkley, Yorkshire | isbn=1-905080-05-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On poorly drained impermeable areas of millstone grit, shale or clays the topsoil gets waterlogged in winter and spring. Here tree suppression combined with the heavier rainfall results in [[blanket bog]] up to {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on|0|order=flip}} thick. The erosion of peat still exposes stumps of ancient trees.&lt;ref name=landcape/&gt;
{{quote|text="In digging it away they frequently find vast fir trees, perfectly sound, and some oaks&amp;nbsp;..."|sign= [[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]]|source= ''A Six Months' Tour of the North of England'' (1771)&lt;ref name="young"&gt;[[Arthur Young (writer)|Arthur Young]] (1771) ''A Six Months' Tour of the North of England''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Fauna==
[[File:Two grouse "picked" after the previous day's shoot. - geograph.org.uk - 547403.jpg|thumb|left|Shooting of [[red grouse]] is an economically important activity in the Pennines.]]

Fauna in the Pennines is similar to the rest of [[Fauna of England|England]] and [[Fauna of Wales|Wales]], but the area hosts some specialised species. Deer are found throughout the Pennines and some species of animals that are rare elsewhere in England can be found here. [[Arctic hare]]s, which were common in Britain during the Ice Age and retreated to the cooler, more tundra-like uplands once the climate warmed up, were introduced to the [[Dark Peak]] area of the [[Peak District]] in the 19th century.

Large areas of heather moorland in the Pennines are managed for [[driven grouse shooting|driven shooting]] of wild [[red grouse]]. The related and declining [[black grouse]] is still found in northern parts of the Pennines. Other birds whose English breeding strongholds are in the Pennines include [[European golden plover|golden plover]], [[common snipe|snipe]], [[Eurasian curlew|curlew]], [[dunlin]], [[Merlin (bird)|merlin]], [[short-eared owl]], [[ring ouzel]] and [[twite]],&lt;ref name="BTO93Atlas"&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland: 1998–1991 |author=Gibbons|publisher=T &amp; A D Poyser |isbn=0-85661-075-5 |year=1993|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; though many of these are at the southern limit of their distributions and are more common in Scotland.

[[Nazi Germany]] established the '''''Reichskommissariat Ostland''''' ('''RKO''') in 1941 as the [[Reichskommissariat|civilian occupation regime]] in the [[Baltic states]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], and [[Lithuania]]), the northeastern part of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] and the west part of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Belarusian SSR]] during [[World War II]]. It was also known initially as '''''Reichskommissariat Baltenland''''' ("Baltic Land").&lt;ref name="Gaunt-210"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=vsrJLASVC3QC&amp;q=%22The+Reichskommissariat+Ostland%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22The%20Reichskommissariat%20Ostland%22&amp;f=false | title=Reichskommissariat Ostland | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | work=The Routledge History of the Holocaust | date=2010 | accessdate=20 February 2015 | author=David Gaunt, Jonathan C.

The political organization for this territory – after an initial period of [[Military occupation|military administration]] before its establishment – was that of a German civilian administration, nominally under the authority of the [[Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories]] ({{lang-de|Reichsministerium für die besetzten Ostgebiete}}) led by Nazi ideologist [[Alfred Rosenberg]], but actually controlled by the Nazi official [[Hinrich Lohse]], its appointed [[Reichskommissar]].

Germany's main political objectives for the Reichskommissariat, as laid out by the Ministry within the framework of [[National Socialism|National Socialist]] policies for the east established by [[Adolf Hitler]], included the [[Final Solution|complete annihilation]] of the [[Jewish people|Jewish]] population, as well as the ''[[Lebensraum]]'' settlement of [[ethnic Germans]] along with the expulsion of some of the native population and the [[Germanization]] of the rest of the populace. These policies applied not only to the ''Reichskommissariat Ostland'' but also to other German-occupied Soviet territories. Through the use of ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' A and B with active participation of local auxiliary forces over a million Jews were killed in the ''Reichskommissariat Ostland''.&lt;ref name="gegenwind"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gegenwind.info/175/sonderheft_wehrmacht.pdf |title=Reichskommissariat Ostland: Schleswig-Holsteins Kolonie |last1=Pohl |first1=Reinhard |date=November 1998 |website=Gegenwind |series=Gegenwind-Sonderheft: Schleswig-Holstein und die Verbrechen der Wehrmacht |publisher=Gegenwind, Enough is Enough, and anderes lernen/Heinrich-Böll-Stiftung Schleswig-Holstein |pages=10–12 |language=German |trans-title=Reichskommissariat Ostland: Schleswig-Holstein's Colony |accessdate = 2014-03-27 |quote=Vom Einmarsch im Juni 1941 bis Ende Januar 1942, der Niederlage vor Moskau, töteten die deutschen Truppen im "Ostland" etwa 330.000 Juden, 8359 "Kommunisten", 1044 "Partisanen" und 1644 "Geisteskranke".

XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1943 and 1944 the [[Red Army]] gradually recaptured most of the territory in their advance on Germany, but [[Wehrmacht]] forces held out in the [[Courland Pocket|Courland pocket]]. With the [[End of World War II in Europe|end of the war in Europe]] and the defeat of Germany in 1945, the Reichskommissariat ceased to exist.

Ostland should not be confused with [[Ober Ost]], which had a similar role as an occupation authority for Baltic territories conquered by the [[German Empire]] in [[World War I]].

== History ==

===Planning before the attack on the Soviet Union===
[[File:RedArmy19Aug31Dec44.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] operations, 19 August to 31 December 1944.]]
Originally the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories ({{lang-de|Reichsminister fur die besetzten Ostgebiete}}), [[Alfred Rosenberg]] envisioned usage of the term '''Baltenland''' ("Baltic Land") before the summer of 1941 for the area that would eventually be known as ''Ostland''.&lt;ref name="Kay-70" /&gt; [[Otto Bräutigam]], a major colleague of Rosenberg at the time, opposed this idea. In a later declaration he alleged that Rosenberg (himself a [[Baltic German]]), was influenced by his "Baltic friends" in forwarding this initiative, in which a "Baltic Reichskommissariat" with the addition of Belarus would be formed, "and with this the White Ruthenians would also be regarded as Balts". A more important additional colleague of Rosenberg, [[Georg Leibbrandt]], spoke out against this. He argued that the sympathy of the [[Baltic peoples]], who would naturally want the use of their own terminology, could be lost entirely. They would therefore not be won over either as supporters of the German war effort, nor as racially valuable settlers for the region.

===After Operation Barbarossa===
After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]], vast areas were conquered to Germany's east. At first these areas would remain under military occupation by [[Wehrmacht]] authorities, but as soon as the military situation allowed it, a more permanent form of administration under German rule for these territories would be instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Norman. (1973). ''Hitler's War Aims: the Nazi State and the Course of Expansion'', page 217. W. W. Norton &amp; Company Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Greater German Reich in 1942.png|thumb|275px|Greater German Reich (red) and its allies in 1942, with Reichskommissariats]]

A Führer Decree of 17 July 1941 provided for this move. It established [[Reichskommissariat]]s in the east, as administrative units of the [[Nazi Germany|Greater German Reich]] (''Großdeutsches Reich''). The structure of the Reichskommissariats was defined by the same decree. Each of these territories would be led by a German civil governor known as a [[Reichskommissar]] appointed by Hitler and answerable only to him.&lt;ref name="avalon.law"&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/subject_menus/nca_v4menu.asp Nazi Conspriracy and Aggression Volume 4.] The Avalon Project. [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/1997-ps.asp Decree of 17 July 1941.]&lt;/ref&gt; The official appointed for the Ostland (''Der Reichskommissar für das Ostland'') was [[Hinrich Lohse]], the ''[[Oberpräsident]]'' and ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. Local government in the Reichskommissariat was to be organized under a "National Director" (''Reichskomissar'') in Estonia, a "General Director" in Latvia and a "General Adviser" in Lithuania.

Rosenberg's ministerial authority was, in practice, severely limited. The first reason was that many of the practicalities were commanded elsewhere: the [[Wehrmacht]] and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] managed the military and security aspects, [[Fritz Sauckel]] as Reich Director of Labour had control over manpower and working areas, [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Albert Speer]] had total management of economic aspects in the territories and the [[Reichspost#Deutsche Reichspost|Reich postal service]] administered the Eastern territories' postal services. These German central government interventions in the affairs of Ostland overriding the appropriate ministries were known as "special administrations" (''Sonderverwaltungen''). Later, from September 1941, the civil administration that had been decreed in the previous July was actually set up. Lohse and [[Erich Koch|Koch]] objected to these breaches of their supposed responsibilities, seeking to administer their territories with the independence and authority of [[Gauleiter]]s. On 1 April 1942, an ''arbeitsbereich'' (lit. "working sphere", a name for the party cadre organisation outside the Reich proper) was established in the civilian-administered parts of the occupied Soviet territories, whereupon Koch and Lohse gradually ceased communication with Rosenberg, preferring to deal directly with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] through [[Martin Bormann]] and the [[Party Chancellery]]. In the process they also displaced all other actors including notably the SS, except in central Belarus where [[HSSPF]] [[Erich von dem Bach-Zelewsky]] had a special command encompassing both military and civil administration territories and engaged in anti-partisan warfare.

In July 1941, the civil administration was declared in much of the occupied Soviet territories before one had materialised in the field. A power vacuum emerged which the SS filled with its [[SS and police leader|SS and Police Leadership Structure]], exercising unlimited power over security and policing which it gave up only grudgingly in the autumn when civil administration came into being; indeed [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] would use various tactics until as late as 1943 in unsuccessful efforts to regain this power. This partly explains the strained relations between the SS and the civil administration. In the Ostland, matters were further complicated by the personality of the local superior SS officer [[Friedrich Jeckeln]], attacked by the SS's opponents for his alleged corruption, brutality and mindless foolhardiness.

== German plans ==
{{Main|Generalplan Ost|Lebensraum|Wehrbauer}}

The short-term political objectives for Ostland differed from those for the [[Reichskommissariat Ukraine|Ukraine]], the [[Reichskommissariat Kaukasus|Caucasus]] or the [[Reichskommissariat Moskowien|Moscow]] regions. The [[Baltic states|Baltic lands]], which were to be joined together with [[Belarus]] (to serve as a spacious [[hinterland]] of the coastal areas), would be organised as one [[Germanisation|Germanized]] [[protectorate]] prior to union with Germany itself in the near future. Rosenberg said that these lands had a fundamentally "European" character, resulting from 700 years of history under [[Swedish Livonia|Swedish]], [[Danish Estonia|Danish]], and [[Baltic Germans|German]] rule, and should therefore provide Germany with "[[Lebensraum]]", an opinion shared by Hitler and other leading Nazis. The Belarusians, however, were considered by the scholars of the RMfdbO as "little and weak peasant people" dwelling in "folkish indifference", but also "the most harmless and because of this the least dangerous for us of all the peoples in the Eastern Space" and an ideal object of exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;Rein, L. (2010), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JCbNmF3iXP0C The Kings and the Pawns: Collaboration in Byelorussia During World War II]'', p. 89, {{ISBN|1-84545-776-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rosenberg suggested that Belarus will be in the future an appropriate reception area of various undesirable population elements from the Baltic part of Ostland and [[German-occupied Poland]].&lt;ref name="rein"&gt;Rein 2010, p. 90-91&lt;/ref&gt; He also toyed with the idea of turning the country into a huge [[nature reserve]].&lt;ref name="rein"/&gt;

The regime planned to encourage the post-war settlement of [[German people|Germans]] to the region, seeing it as a region traditionally inhabited by Germans (see the [[Teutonic Order]] and the [[Northern Crusades]]) that had been overrun by [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]]. During the war itself in [[Pskov]] province ethnic Germans were resettled from [[Romania]] with some [[Netherlands|Dutch]]. The settlement of Dutch settlers was encouraged by the ''Nederlandsche Oost-Compagnie'', a Dutch-German organisation.&lt;ref&gt;(Dutch) Werkman, Evert; De Keizer, Madelon; Van Setten, Gert Jan (1980). ''Dat kan ons niet gebeuren...: het dagelijkse leven in de Tweede Wereldoorlog'', p. 146. De Bezige Bij.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical [[German language|German]] and Germanic-sounding placenames were also retained (or introduced) for many Baltic cities, such as ''Reval'' ([[Tallinn]]), ''Kauen'' ([[Kaunas]]), and ''Dünaburg'' ([[Daugavpils]]), among many others. To underscore the region's planned incorporation into Germany some Nazi ideologists further suggested the future use of the names ''Peipusland'' for [[Estonia]] and ''Dünaland'' for [[Latvia]] once they had become part of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lumans, Valdus O. (2006). ''Latvia in World War II'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=IPv1gjLhtZ4C&amp;pg=PA149&amp;dq=peipusland&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=8Eg5TMiRMYqQjAeK97WABA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=peipusland&amp;f=false p. 149]. [[Fordham University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Russian city of [[Veliky Novgorod|Novgorod]], the easternmost [[kontor|foreign trading post]] of the [[Hanseatic League]], was to be renamed ''Holmgard''.&lt;ref name="dallin p185"/&gt;

During the occupation, the Germans also published a "local" German-language newspaper, the ''Deutsche Zeitung im Ostland''.

== Administrative and territorial organization ==
The Reichskommissariat Ostland was sub-divided into four "General Regions" (''Generalbezirke''), namely Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and [[White Ruthenia]] ([[Belarus]]), headed by a ''Generalkommissar''. The regions were further divided into "Districts" (''Kreisgebiete''). In the three [[Baltic states]] their previous counties (Es:[[Counties of Estonia|Maakonad]], Lv:[[Districts of Latvia|Aprinka]], Lt:[[Counties of Lithuania|Apskritys]]) were also retained as a further sub-division (''Kreise''). The conquered territories further to the east were under [[military occupation|military control]] for the entirety of the war. The intention was to include these territories in the anticipated future extension of Ostland. This would have incorporated Ingria (''Ingermannland''), as well as the Smolensk, Pskov, and Novgorod areas into the Reichskommissariat. Estonia's new eastern border was planned to be extent to the Leningrad-Novgorod line, with [[Lake Ilmen]] and [[Volkhov River]] forming the new eastern border of the Baltic country, while Latvia was to reach the [[Velikiye Luki]] region.&lt;ref name="dallin p185"&gt;{{cite book |title=German rule in Russia, 1941-1945: a study of occupation policies |last=Dallin |first=Alexander |year=1981 |publisher=Westview| isbn= |page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Estonia and the Estonians |last=Raun |first=Toivo U. |year=2001 |publisher=[[Hoover Press]] |isbn=978-0-8179-2852-0 |page=161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belarus was to extend east to include the [[Smolensk]] region.&lt;ref&gt;(German) Dallin, Alexander (1958). ''Deutsche Herrschaft in Russland, 1941-1945: Eine Studie über Besatzungspolitik'', p. 67. Droste Verlag GmbH, Düsseldorf.&lt;/ref&gt;
The local administration of the Reichskommissariat Ostland was headed by ''[[Reichskommissar]]'' [[Hinrich Lohse]]. Below him there was an administrative hierarchy: a ''Generalkomissar'' led each ''Generalbezirk'', while ''Gebietskommissars'' administered ''Kreisgebieten'', respectively.

The German administrative center for the entire region, as well as the seat of the ''Reichskommissar'', was in [[Riga]], Latvia.

Last changed on 15 February 2010. Retrieved 13 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Policies ==
Upon taking control, [[Hinrich Lohse]] proclaimed the official decree ("Verkündungsblatt für das Ostland") on November 15, 1941, whereby all [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] State and Party properties in the [[Baltic provinces|Baltic]] area and [[Belarus]] were confiscated and transferred to the [[Germany|German]] administration.

In Ostland, the administration returned lands [[Nationalization|nationalised]] by the [[Soviets]] to the former peasant owners. In towns and cities, small workshops, industries and businesses were returned to their former owners, subject to promises to pay taxes and quotas to the authorities. [[Jews|Jewish]] properties were confiscated. In Belarus, a state enterprise was established to manage all former Soviet government properties. One of the German administrators was General commissar [[Wilhelm Kube]].

''Ostgesellschaften'' (state monopolies) and so-called ''Patenfirmen'', private industrial companies linked to the German government, were quickly appointed to manage confiscated enterprises. The Hermann Göring Workshops, [[Mannesmann]], [[IG Farben]] and [[Siemens AG|Siemens]] assumed control of all former Soviet state enterprises in Ostland and [[Ukraine]]. An example of this was the takeover, by [[Daimler-Benz]] and Vomag, of heavy repair workshops, in [[Riga]] and [[Kiev]], for the maintenance of all captured [[Russia]]n [[T-34]] and [[KV-1 (tank)|KV-1]] tanks, linked with their repair workshops in Germany.

In Belarus, the German authorities lamented the "Jewish-[[Bolshevism|Bolshevik]]" extremist policies that had denied the people knowledge of the basic concepts of private property, ownership, or personal initiative. Unlike the Baltic area, where the authorities saw that "during the war and the occupation's first stages, the population gave examples of sincere collaboration, a way for possibly giving some liberty to autonomous administration".

===Economic exploitation===
According to [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk|Schwerin von Krosigk]], the Reich Minister of Finances{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, until February 1944, Reich Government receiving in concept of occupation costs and taxes (in million of RM) 753,6 RM. The German Ministry of East Affairs required Lohse and the Reichskommissar in Ukraine to deliver immediately [[Slavery|slave labor]] from the occupied territories to Germany: 380,000 farm workers and 247,000 industrial workers.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The Germans viewed the [[Slavs]] as a pool of slave work labor for use by the German Reich; if necessary they could be worked to death.

===Extermination of the Jews in Ostland===

At the time of the German invasion in June 1941 there were significant Jewish minorities in Ostland &amp;mdash; nearly 480,000 people. To these were added deportees from Austria, Germany, and elsewhere.

Jews were confined to [[ghetto]]s in [[Riga ghetto|Riga]] and [[Kaunas Ghetto|Kauen]], which rapidly became overcrowded and squalid. From these they were taken to execution sites.

The Soviet [[Red Army]] reported the discovery of Vilna and Kauen extermination centres as apparently part of the Nazi [[Final Solution]]. The extermination of the resident Jews began almost immediately after the invasion and was later extended to the deportees.

In autumn 1943 the [[Ghettos in occupied Europe 1939 - 1944|ghettos]] were "liquidated", and the remaining occupants were moved to camps at [[Kaiserwald concentration camp|Kaiserwald]] and [[Stutthof]] near [[Danzig]] or, if not capable of work, killed.

Aside from the German political leaders mentioned above including Reich Ministry [[Alfred Rosenberg]], General Commissar [[:de:Karl-Siegmund Litzmann|Karl-Siegmund Litzmann]] and General Commissar [[Wilhelm Kube]], the regional collaborationist structures across ''Reichskommissariat Ostland'' included Estonian political leaders such as [[Hjalmar Mäe]], [[Oskar Angelus]], Alfred Wendt (or Vendt), Otto Leesment, Hans Saar, Oskar Öpik, Arnold Radik, [[Johannes Soodla]]; Latvian political leaders with [[Oskars Dankers]], and [[:de:Rūdolfs Bangerskis|Rūdolfs Bangerskis]]; Lithuanian political leaders: [[Juozas Ambrazevičius]], and [[Petras Kubiliūnas]]; as well as the Belarusian nationalist leaders from the [[Belarusian Central Rada]].

German and local security authorities were kept busy by [[Soviet partisan]] activities in Belarus. They noted that "infected zones" of partisan action included an area of 500 or 600&amp;nbsp;km², around [[Minsk]], [[Pinsk]], [[Gomel]], [[Briansk]], [[Smolensk]] and [[Vitebsk]], including the principal roads and railways in these areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2513">The '''San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation Demonstration Garden''' is a public teaching-research garden with just over an acre of plantings and displays that showcase [[water conservation]] through a series of themed gardens and exhibits located at [[California State University, San Bernardino]]. While located on the Cal State campus in [[San Bernardino]], the Garden was not built with any state resources. Rather, it was made possible by major gifts from three local donors: the San Bernardino Valley Municipal Water District (now called the West Valley Water District), the [[San Manuel Band of Mission Indians]] and the Inland Empire Resource Conservation District, with additional donations from a variety of smaller donors and in-kind contributions of labor, supplies and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;http://garden.csusb.edu/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
About two years in the planning and building, the San Bernardino Valley Water Conservation Demonstration garden is a partnership between the university, its Water Resources Institute (WRI) and several community partners who were seeking to educate San Bernardino Valley residents about ways to lower their outdoor water consumption and offer research opportunities to the WRI.&lt;ref&gt;http://garden.csusb.edu/howTo/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A state mandate adopted in 2009 compels urban water supplies to achieve a 20 percent per capita reduction by 2020. One way to do this is by replacing irrigated grass with water-wise landscaping, but there is a lack of knowledge about planning, building and maintaining these landscapes, along with the misconception that saving water on landscapes limits homeowners to [[cactus|cacti]]. That is not the case, and the demonstration garden is a colorful testament to the variety of looks available.&lt;ref&gt;http://garden.csusb.edu/history/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Point process notation==
{{Main|Point process notation}}

Point processes are mathematical objects that are defined on some underlying [[mathematical space]]. Since these processes are often used to represent collections of points randomly scattered in space, time or both, the underlying space is usually ''d''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] denoted here by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^{ d}&lt;/math&gt;, but they can be defined on more [[Abstraction (mathematics)|abstract]] mathematical spaces.&lt;ref name="daleyPPII2008"/&gt;

Point processes have a number of interpretations, which is reflected by the various types of [[point process notation]].&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB2"/&gt; For example, if a point &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x&lt;/math&gt; belongs to or is a member of a point process, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt;, then this can be written as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle x\in {N},&lt;/math&gt;

and represents the point process being interpreted as a random [[Set (mathematics)|set]]. Alternatively, the number of points of &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; located in some [[Borel set]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt; is often written as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}(B), &lt;/math&gt;

which reflects a [[random measure]] interpretation for point processes. These two notations are often used in parallel or interchangeably.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moller2003statistical"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt;

==Definitions==

===Spherical contact distribution function===

The '''spherical contact distribution function''' is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt; H_s(r)=1-P({N}(b(o,r))=0). &lt;/math&gt;

where ''b(o,r)'' is a  [[Ball (mathematics)|ball]] with radius ''r'' centered at the origin ''o''. In other words, spherical contact distribution function is the probability there are no points from the point process located in a hyper-sphere of radius ''r''.

===Contact distribution function===

The spherical contact distribution function can be generalized for sets other than the (hyper-)sphere in &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^{ d}&lt;/math&gt;. For some Borel set &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt; with positive volume (or more specifically, Lebesgue measure), the ''contact distribution function'' (''with respect to'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle B&lt;/math&gt;)  for &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r\geq0&lt;/math&gt; is defined by the equation:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; H_B(r)=P({N}(rB)=0). &lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==

===Poisson point process===
For a [[Poisson point process]] &lt;math&gt;\textstyle {N}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^d&lt;/math&gt; with intensity measure &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \Lambda&lt;/math&gt; this becomes

:&lt;math&gt; H_s(r)=1-e^{-\Lambda(b(o,r))}, &lt;/math&gt;

which for the homogeneous case becomes

:&lt;math&gt; H_s(r)=1-e^{-\lambda |b(o,r)|}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\textstyle |b(o,r)|&lt;/math&gt; denotes the volume (or more specifically, the Lebesgue measure) of the ball of radius &lt;math&gt;\textstyle r&lt;/math&gt;. In the plane &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \textbf{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, this expression simplifies to

:&lt;math&gt; H_s(r)=1-e^{-\lambda \pi r^2}. &lt;/math&gt;

==Relationship to other functions==

===Nearest neighbour function===

In general, the spherical contact distribution function and the corresponding [[nearest neighbour function]] are not equal. However, these two functions are identical for Poisson point processes.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt; In fact, this characteristic is due to a unique property of Poisson processes and their [[Palm distribution]]s, which forms part of the result known as the ''Slivnyak-Mecke''&lt;ref name="BB1"/&gt; or ''Slivnyak's theorem''.&lt;ref name="baddeley2007spatial"/&gt;

==={{mvar|J}}-function===

The fact that the spherical distribution function {{mvar| H&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(r)}} and nearest neighbour function {{mvar| D&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;(r)}} are identical for the Poisson point process can be used to statistically test if point process data appears to be that of a Poisson point process. For example, in spatial statistics the {{mvar|J}}-function is defined for all {{mvar|r}}&amp;nbsp;≥&amp;nbsp;0 as:&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J(r)=\frac{1-D_o(r)}{1-H_s(r)} &lt;/math&gt;

For a Poisson point process, the {{mvar|J}} function is simply {{math|''J''(''r'')}}=1, hence why it is used as a [[Non-parametric statistics|non-parametric]] test for whether data behaves as though it were from a Poisson process. It is, however, thought possible to construct non-Poisson point processes for which {{math|''J''(''r'')}}=1,&lt;ref name="bedford1997remark"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Bedford, T, Van den Berg, J| title=A remark on the Van Lieshout and Baddeley J-function for point processes| journal=Advances in Applied Probability| year=1997| pages=19–25| publisher=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt; but such counterexamples are viewed as somewhat 'artificial' by some and exist for other statistical tests.&lt;ref name="foxall2002nonparametric"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Foxall, Rob, Baddeley, Adrian| title=Nonparametric measures of association between a spatial point process and a random set, with geological applications| journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series C| year=2002| volume=51| number=2| pages=165–182| publisher=Wiley Online Library| doi=10.1111/1467-9876.00261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, {{mvar|J}}-function serves as one way (others include using [[factorial moment measure]]s&lt;ref name="baddeley2007spatial"/&gt;) to measure the interaction between points in a point process.&lt;ref name="stoyan1995stochastic"/&gt;

[[File:Dugi Otok Telascica.jpg |thumb|View of the steep coast on the island of [[Dugi Otok]] in Croatia]]
A '''steep coast'''&lt;ref&gt;Bird, Eric (2008). ''Coastal Geomorphology: An Introduction'', 2nd ed., Wiley, Chichester, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is a stretch of [[coast]]line where the [[mainland]] descends abruptly into the sea. There is a sharp transition from the land to sea as opposed to that on a [[flat coast]] where the land descends gradually seawards. The height of the land on a steep coast is well above [[sea level]].

Most steep coast are rocky [[cliffed coast]]s (also called abrasion coasts), where the [[erosion (geology)|erosion]] processes of wave action result in a steep declivity. Another type of steep coast is the [[fjord]] which is formed when a [[glacial valley]] lies partially under water as a result of a rise in sea levels. In [[Norway]], [[New Zealand]] or [[Alaska]] there are fjords whose almost vertical sides tower over 1,000&amp;nbsp;metres above the water and plunge 300&amp;nbsp;metres below it.

On [[volcanic island]]s the sea can enter the [[caldera]] and the face of the [[volcanic pipe]] can form a steep coastline. The best-known example of that is [[Santorini]] in the archipelago of the [[Cyclades]] in Greeces. The main town of Thira lies on the rim of the caldera which is around 300&amp;nbsp;metres above the sea and drops below it for another 200&amp;nbsp;metres.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1025">'''Tarascan''' or '''Tarasca''' is an exonym and the popular name for the [[Purépecha culture]]. It may refer to:

* the [[Tarascan State]], a [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican]] empire until the Spanish conquest in the 1500s, located in (present-day) west-central Mexico
* the [[Purépecha people]]
* the [[Purépecha language]]

The term has pejorative connotations when it refers to the people or their language.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/michoacan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name "Tarascan" (and its Spanish-language equivalent, "tarasco") comes from the word "tarascue" in the Purépecha language, which means indistinctly "father-in-law" or "son-in-law". The Spanish took it as their name, for reasons that have been attributed to different, mostly legendary, stories. 

The [[Nahuatl]] name for the Purépecha was "Michhuàquê" ("those who have fish"), whence the name of the Mexican state of [[Michoacán]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4872">'''The Global Experience''' ''(formerly Solar Net International)'' is an international [[non-governmental organization]] that is involved with projects of global learning and [[Education for Sustainable Development]].

== History ==
In 2005 a group of students and teachers from the Schillergymnasium in Münster founded the association Solar Net International e.V with the aim to support the intercultural dialogue of young people around the globe. In 2006, the organization was awarded the "North-South Prize" by the city of [[Münster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presse-service.de/data.cfm/static/635911.html Presse-service.de]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, counting by then almost 8000 members in more than 160 nations, the organization changed its name to The Global Experience in order to set a stronger focus on the organizations main goal, which is enhancing intercultural learning experiences across the globe.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXTwt2wAC9A Official The Global Experience YouTube channel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eine-welt-netz-nrw.de/seiten/1299/ Eine Welt Netz NRW]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Website ==
In 2006 the group opened an online forum that allows members to post reports about their daily lives to share with others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4158975,00.html%7C Deutsche Welle World]&lt;/ref&gt; Through publishing language learning videos on [[YouTube]] the online community has been growing constantly. In 2011 the website was awarded with the World Summit Youth Award that promotes best practice in e-content putting the UN [[Millennium Development Goals]] into action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsis-award.org/sites/default/files/PR_WSYA%202011%20_Nigeria_Into%20the%20spotlight%20with%20Hip%20Hop%20and%20R'n'B.pdf WSYA Press Release 2011] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125100325/http://www.wsis-award.org/sites/default/files/PR_WSYA%202011%20_Nigeria_Into%20the%20spotlight%20with%20Hip%20Hop%20and%20R'n'B.pdf |date=2016-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
The Global Experience initiates and supports projects in the field of [[Education for Sustainable Development]]
and intercultural learning. Above that the different national groups also run own projects to improve the
access to education in their local communities.

Besides the German group, members in other countries have been forming their own associations and
projects under the name of The Global Experience, amongst others in [[Poland]], [[Vietnam]], [[Belgium]], [[Colombia]]
and [[Zimbabwe]].

Since 2007 the organization annually holds international youth conferences that invite young members from
across the world for a two weeks program to Germany in order to develop and initiate common projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/archives/multimedia/index.php?s=films_details&amp;id_page=33&amp;id_film=501 UNESCO Multimedia Web &amp; Services]&lt;/ref&gt;

In summer 2011 The Global Experience launched a new project called "International Reporters". On their
website www.internationalreporters.org an international editorial team with students from 20 countries report
about issues of cultural awareness, sustainable development and social change. The project was recognized
in November 2011 as a good practice project for [[Education for Sustainable Development]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weltweitwissen2011.de/?id=125 WeltWeitWissen 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
