      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1254">'''Aariya''' is an apparently spurious language of [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[India]]. 

According to a submission made in 2007 to the [[ISO 639-3]] Registration Authority which resulted in having language code withdrawn, the only reference for the language was a 1970 work entitled ''A bibliographical Index of the Lesser Known Languages and Dialects of India and Nepal'' by Richard Hugoniot, which relied on information provided by the Madhya Pradesh Department of Tribal Welfare from 1964 and indicated the presence of the Aariya as a [[scheduled tribe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/cr_files/2008-001.pdf | title = ISO 639-3 request | accessdate = 2008-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Nothing is known of the language. Recent studies have failed to reveal either any speakers of the language or anyone with knowledge of the language.  Whether this means the language never existed or if the population that spoke it was wiped out is not clear.

'''Western Esotericism''' is an [[academic field]] of [[research]], [[scholarship]], and [[education]] that focuses on the history of [[Europe]]an and [[Western esotericism]].

==Origins and development==
The academic study of Western esotericism was pioneered in the early 20th century by historians of the ancient world and the European Renaissance, who came to recognise that &amp;ndash; although it had been ignored by previous scholarship &amp;ndash; the impact which pre-Christian and non-rational schools of thought had exerted on European society and culture was worthy of academic attention.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=4}} One of the key centres for this was the [[Warburg Institute]] in London, where scholars like [[Frances Yates]], [[Edgar Wind]], Ernst Cassier, and D. P. Walker began arguing that esoteric thought had had a greater impact on Renaissance culture than had been previously accepted.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|pp=4–5}} In 1965, the world's first academic post in the study of esotericism was established at the [[École pratique des hautes études]] in the [[Sorbonne]], Paris; named the chair in the History of Christian Esotericism, its first holder was [[François Secret]], a specialist in the Christian Kabbalah.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}} In 1979 the scholar [[Antoine Faivre]] assumed Secret's chair at the Sorbonne, which was renamed the "History of Esoteric and Mystical Currents in Modern and Contemporary Europe".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=x}} Faivre has since been cited as being responsible for developing the study of Western esotericism into a formalised field.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=5}}

Faivre noted that there were two significant obstacles to establishing the field. One was that there was an engrained prejudice towards esotericism within academia, resulting in the widespread perception that the history of esotericism was not worthy of academic research.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}} The second was that esotericism is a trans-disciplinary field, the study of which did not fit clearly within any particular discipline.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}} As Hanegraaff noted, Western esotericism had to be studied as a separate field to religion, philosophy, science, and the arts, because while it "participates in all these fields" it does not squarely fit into any of them.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2013|pp=1–2}} 

In 1980, the U.S.-based [[Hermetic Academy]] was founded by [[Robert A. McDermott]] as an outlet for scholars interested in Western esotericism.{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=x|2a1=Faivre|2a2=Voss|2y=1995|2p=59}} From 1986 to 1990 members of the Hermetic Academy participated in panels at the annual meeting of the [[American Academy of Religion]] under the rubric of the "Esotericism and Perennialism Group".{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=x|2a1=Faivre|2a2=Voss|2y=1995|2p=59}} By 1994, Faivre could comment that the academic study of Western esotericism had taken off in France, Italy, England, and the United States, but he lamented the fact that it had not done so in Germany.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=ix}}
By 2008, there were three dedicated university chairs in the subject, at the [[University of Sorbonne]], [[University of Amsterdam]], and the [[University of Exeter]], with the latter two institutions also offering [[master's degree]] programs in it.{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=3}}

On the basis of the fact that "English culture and literature have been traditional strongholds of Western esotericism", in 2011 Pia Brînzeu and György Szönyi urged that [[English studies]] also have a role in this interdisciplinary field.{{sfn|Brînzeu|Szönyi|2011|p=184}}

==Schools==
The following Universities have academic chairs in the subject:
* [[University of Amsterdam]] in the Netherlands
* [[École pratique des hautes études]] in France

Specific degrees that can be granted include:
* [[Master of Arts|MA]] and [[MRes]] in Religious Studies: Mysticism &amp; Western Esotericism track, from University of Amsterdam
* [[Master of Arts|MA]] and [[MRes]] in Concealed Knowledge: Gnosticism, Esotericism and Mysticism, from the University of Groningen, Netherlands.
* [[PhD]] in Religious Studies: Mysticism, Gnosticism &amp; Esotericism Concentration, from Rice University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1001">'''''Accubita''''' was one name for the [[Ancient Roman furniture]] [[couch]]es used in the time of the [[Roman emperor]]s, in the ''[[triclinium]]'' or dining room, for reclining upon at meals.  It was also apparently sometimes the name of the dining room itself, or a niche for a couch. Sometimes it denotes a multi-person curved couch, for which the term [[stibadium]] is also used.  [[Klinai]] is the Greek equivalent, sometimes also used.

The [[mattress]]es and feather-beds were softer and higher, and the supports (''fulcra'') of them lower in proportion, than in older triclinium couches. The cloths and pillows spread over them, and over beds, were called ''accubitalia''.&lt;ref&gt;Aelius Lampridius, ''[[Augustan History]]'', "Antoninus Heliogabalus" (Pars II), 19, 25; Schol. ''ad Juv. Sat.'' v.17&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2536">'''Adoxography''' is elegant or refined writing that addresses a trivial or base subject. The term was coined in the late 19th century. It was a form of rhetorical exercise "in which the legitimate methods of the encomium are applied to persons or objects in themselves obviously unworthy of praise, as being trivial, ugly, useless, ridiculous, dangerous or vicious" — see Arthur S. Pease, "Things Without Honor", ''Classical Philology'', Vol. XXI (1926) 27, at 28–9. Pease surveys this field from its origins with the defence of Helen ascribed to Gorgias, and cites De Quincey's "[[On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts]]" and Lewis Carroll’s ''[[Through the Looking-Glass]]'' as modern examples. Pease suggests that the skill was taught in ancient Greece, where the matters known to have been praised included gout, blindness, deafness, old age, negligence, adultery, flies, gnats, bedbugs, smoke, and dung. 

The art was rediscovered during the revival of [[rhetoric]] in the 16th century. Among the best known and most influential examples was [[Erasmus]]' ''Moriae Encomium'' or ''[[The Praise of Folly]]''.  

==Literary Examples==
The first English treatise on the subject was Anthony Munday's ''"The defence of contraries"'' (1593), a translation of Charles Estienne's "Paradoxes, ce sont propos contre la commune opinion" and based on Ortensio Landi's "Paradossi". It contained essays that praised, amongst other things, poverty, drunkenness and stupidity.  [[Walter K. Olson]], writing in the Leisure &amp; Arts section of the September 8, 2005, edition of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', quotes the following passage from Sadakat Kadri, "The Trial: A History, from Socrates to O.J. Simpson": "Elizabethan schoolboys...were commonly taught adoxography, the art of eruditely praising worthless things." The passage comes in the course of an account of Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s trial, and Kadri observes that Munday thought [[lawyers]] could particularly learn from his book. This was a period of English history when the jury trial was assuming its modern form, and Kadri later shows that the ability to praise apparently worthless causes has been central to courtroom [[advocacy]] for centuries. Celebrated adoxographers could therefore be said to include men such as [[Cicero]] and [[Clarence Darrow]].

In modern writing, the term "adoxography" is also used as an often humorous self-reference in writing, often in regard to humor columns or blogs.

[[File:Airquotes.gif|thumbnail|right|The index and middle finger are lowered twice.]]

'''Air quotes''', also called '''finger quotes''', are virtual [[quotation marks]] formed in the air with one's fingers when speaking. This is typically done with hands held shoulder-width apart and at the eye level of the speaker, with the index and middle fingers on each hand flexing at the beginning and end of the phrase being quoted.&lt;ref name="Phrase Finder"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/air-quotes.html |title=Air quotes |accessdate=18 November 2008 |last=Martin |first=Gary |work=The Phrase Finder| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081103020926/http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/air-quotes.html| archivedate= 3 November 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The air-quoted phrase is—in the most common usage—very short, at most a few words.  Air quotes are often used to express [[satire]], [[sarcasm]], [[irony]] or [[euphemism]], among others, and are analogous to [[scare quotes]] in print.

Use of similar gestures has been recorded as early as 1927&lt;ref name="Phrase Finder" /&gt;, and Glenda Farrell used air quotes in a 1937 screwball comedy, "Breakfast for Two." (Much earlier, in 1889, Lewis Carroll described similar usages -- air brackets and an air question mark -- in his last novel, &lt;ref&gt;''[[Sylvie and Bruno]]'', vol.I, ch.17: [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/620/620-0.txt «he marked the parenthesis, in the air, with his finger» and «what can be simpler than just to make a “?” in the air with your finger?»].&lt;/ref&gt;). The term "air quotes" first appeared in a 1989 [[Spy (magazine)|''Spy'' magazine]] article by [[Paul Rudnick]] and [[Kurt Andersen]], who state it became a common gesture around 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rudnick|first1=Paul|title=The Irony Epidemic|work=Spy Magazine|date=March 1989|page=93-98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gesture was used routinely in the TV show ''[[Celebrity Charades]]'' (1979) as the standard signal for a quote or phrase.
In the episode "Nurse's Wild" of TV show ''[[Emergency!]]'' (1972), the character Roy DeSoto uses air quotes at Rampart Hospital base station.

The trend became very popular in the 1990s, attributed by many to comedian [[Steve Martin]], who often used them with exaggerated emphasis in his stand-up shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Additionally, in the blockbuster ''[[Austin Powers (series)|Austin Powers]]'' film series, [[Dr. Evil]] makes exaggerated use of air quotes when explaining matters to his henchmen, particularly while using real phrases he erroneously believes himself to have coined such as "[[laser]]" and "[[Death Star]]".

In the [[HBO]] special [[Back in Town (George Carlin album)|''Back in Town'']] from 1996, the stand-up comedian [[George Carlin]] satirized the use of air quotes in the skit "Quote Marks in the Air" from the segment "Free-Floating Hostility".

[[File:Keshvar ajam- letter from ottoman empire to persian empire mohammad shah.jpg|thumb|''Keshvar ajam'' used to mean "Persia" in a 1255 Hijra letter from the Ottoman Empire to Persian emperor Mohammad Shah]]

'''''Ajam''''' ({{lang|ar|[[wikt:عجم|عجم]]}}) is an Arabic word that refers to someone who's mother tongue is not Arabic. During Arab occupation of Persia, the term become a racial pejorative.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frye|first1=Richard Nelson|last2=Zarrinkoub|first2=Abdolhosein|title=Section on The Arab Conquest of Iran|journal=Cambridge History of Iran|date=1975|volume= 4|page=46|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colloquially, it now refers to non-Arabs in general.

==Etymology==
According to traditional etymology, the word ''ʿajam'' comes from the Semitic root aʿ-j-m. Related forms of the same root include, but are not limited to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qamoos.sakhr.com/openme.asp?fileurl=/html/7074630.html|title=Sakhr: Lisan al-Arab|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930193216/http://qamoos.sakhr.com/openme.asp?fileurl=%2Fhtml%2F7074630.html|archivedate=30 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''mustaʿjim'': mute, incapable of speech
* ''ʿajama'' / '' ʾaʿjama'' / ''ʿajjama'': to dot – in particular, to add the dots that distinguish between various Arabic letters to a text (and hence make it easier for a non-native Arabic speaker to read). It is now an obsolete term, since all modern Arabic texts are dotted. This may also be linked to ''ʿajām'' / ''ʿajam'' "pit, seed (e.g. of a date or grape)".
[[Image:Jamshid Halved.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Persian people|Persian]] painting, depicting [[Jamshid]] halved before [[Zahhak]]]]
* ''inʿajama'': (of speech) to be incomprehensible
* ''istaʿjama'': to fall silent; to be unable to speak
*'' 'aʿjam'': non-fluent

Homophonous words, which may or may not be derived from the same root, include:
* ''ʿajama'': to test (a person); to try (a food).

Modern use of "ajam" has the meaning of "non-Arab".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.sakhr.com/idrisidic_2.asp?Sub=%da%cc%e3|title=Sakhr: Multilingual Dictionary|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original meaning==
The verb ''ʿajama'' originally meant "to mumble, and speak indistinctly", which is the opposite of ''ʿaraba'', “to speak clearly”. Accordingly, the noun ''ʿujma'', of the same root, is the opposite of ''fuṣḥa'', which means "chaste, correct, Arabic language".&lt;ref name="EI"&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', "[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=/home/iranica/public_html/newsite/pdfarticles/v1_articles/ajam&amp;OptStrLogFile=/home/iranica/public_html/newsite/logs/pdfdownload.html Ajam, p.700] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215183238/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/search/searchpdf.isc?ReqStrPDFPath=%2Fhome%2Firanica%2Fpublic_html%2Fnewsite%2Fpdfarticles%2Fv1_articles%2Fajam&amp;OptStrLogFile=%2Fhome%2Firanica%2Fpublic_html%2Fnewsite%2Flogs%2Fpdfdownload.html |date=2007-12-15 }}"&lt;/ref&gt; In general, during the Umayyad period ''Ajam'' was a pejorative term used by Arabs conscious of their social and political superiority, in early history after Islam. However, the distinction between Arab and Ajam is discernible in pre-Islamic poetry.&lt;ref name="EI" /&gt;

==Pejorative use==
During the Umayyad period, the term developed a derogatory meaning as the word was used to refer to non-Arab speakers (primarily Persians) as illiterate and uneducated. Arab conquerors in that period tried to impose Arabic as the primary language of the subject peoples throughout their empire. Angry with the prevalence of the Persian language in the [[Divan]] and Persian society, [[al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf]] ordered the official language of the conquered lands to be replaced with Arabic, sometimes by force (including cutting out the tongues of Persian speakers, further popularising the term "mute").&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Persian resistance to this mentality was popularised in the final verse of [[Ferdowsi]]'s ''[[Shahnameh]]''; this verse is widely regarded by Iranians as the primary reason that they speak Persian and not Arabic to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Firdawsī|last2=Davis|first2=Dick|title=Shahnameh: the Persian Book of Kings|date=2006|publisher=Viking|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the Umayyad dynasty, official association with the Arab dominion was only given to those with the ethnic identity of the Arab and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status ([[mawla|mawālī]], another derogatory term translated to mean "slave" or "lesser" in this context).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Astren|first1=Fred|title=Karaite Judaism and Historical Understanding|date=February 1, 2004|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=1-57003-518-0|pages=33–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colloquial use==
According to [[Clifford Edmund Bosworth]], "by the 3rd/9th century, the non-Arabs, and above all the Persians, were asserting their social and cultural equality (''taswīa'') with the Arabs, if not their superiority (''tafżīl'') over them (a process seen in the literary movement of the [[Shu'ubiyya|Šoʿūbīya]]). In any case, there was always in some minds a current of admiration for the ʿAǰam as heirs of an ancient, cultured tradition of life. Even the great proponent of the Arab cause, [[Al-Jahiz|Jāḥeẓ]], wrote a ''Ketāb al-taswīa bayn al-ʿArab wa’l-ʿAǰam''. After these controversies had died down, and the Persians had achieved a position of power in the Islamic world comparable to their numbers and capabilities, "ʿAjam" became a simple ethnic and geographical designation.".&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopædia Iranica]]'', "Ajam", Bosworth&lt;/ref&gt; Thus by the ninth century, the term was being used by Persians themselves as an ethnic term, and examples can be given by Asadi Tusi in his poem comparing the superiority of Persians and Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;
{{lang|fa|2=
گفتمش چو دیوانه بسی گفتی و اکنون&lt;br /&gt;
پاسخ شنو ای بوده چون دیوان بیابان&lt;br /&gt;
عیب ار چه کنی اهل گرانمایه عجم را&lt;br /&gt;

Jalal Khaleqi Motlaq, "Asadi Tusi", Majaleyeh Daneshkadeyeh Adabiyaat o Olum-e Insani(Literature and Humanities Magazine), Ferdowsi University, 1357(1978). page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;
Accordingly: "territorial notions of “Iran,” are reflected in such terms as irānšahr, irānzamin, or Faris, the Arabicized form of Pārs/Fārs (Persia). The ethnic notion of “Iranian” is denoted by the Persian words Pārsi or Irāni, and the Arabic term Ahl Faris (inhabitants of Persia) or ʿAjam, referring to non-Arabs, but primarily to Persians as in molk-e ʿAjam (Persian kingdom) or moluk-e ʿAjam (Persian kings).".&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Iranica, "IRANIAN IDENTITY iii. MEDIEVAL ISLAMIC PERIOD" by Ahmad Ashraf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''The Political Language of Islam'', during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], 'Ajam' was used colloquially as a reference to denote those whom [[Arabs]] in the [[Arabian Peninsula]] viewed as "alien" or outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0226476936|title=The Political Language of Islam|first=Bernard|last=Lewis|date=11 June 1991|publisher=University Of Chicago Press|accessdate=6 February 2017|via=Amazon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early application of the term included all of the ''non-Arab ''peoples with whom the Arabs had contact including [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Byzantine Greeks]], [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]], [[Armenians]], [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Mandaeans]], [[Arameans]], [[Jews]], [[Georgians]], [[Sabians]], [[Samaritans]], [[Egyptians]], [[Berbers]] and the related [[Nabataeans]] (despite being the originators of the first Arab identifying people).

During the early age of the Caliphates, Ajam was often synonymous with "foreigner" or "stranger". {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In the Western Asia, it was generally applied to the [[Persian people|Persians]], while in [[al-Andalus]] it referred to speakers of [[Romance languages]] - becoming "[[Aljamiado]]" in Spanish in reference to Arabic-script writing of those languages - and in [[West Africa]] refers to the [[Ajami script]] or the writing of local languages such as [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Fula language|Fulani]] in the Arabic alphabet. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} In [[Zanzibar]] ''ajami'' and ''ajamo'' means Persian which came from the [[Persian Gulf]] and the cities of Shiraz and [[Siraf]]. In Turkish, there are many documents and letters that used Ajam to refer to Persian. {{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In the [[Persian Gulf]] region today, people still refer to Persians as Ajami, referring to Persian carpets as ''sajjad al Ajami'' (Ajami carpet), Persian cat as Ajami cats, and Persian Kings as Ajami kings.&lt;ref name="hamshahrionline.ir"&gt;[http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/news-101174.aspx The Book.documents on the Persian gulf's name.names of Iran] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110403110948/http://www.hamshahrionline.ir/news-101174.aspx |date=2011-04-03 }} pp.23-60 Molk e Ajam= Persi .

*In the [[Eastern Anatolia Region]], [[Azerbaijanis]] are sometimes referred to as ''acem'' (which is the Turkish translation of Ajam).&lt;ref&gt;{{tr icon}} [http://www.durna.eu/qarsli.htm Qarslı bir azərbaycanlının ürək sözləri]. Erol Özaydın&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although claimed otherwise by Mahmood Reza Ghods, Modern Sunni Kurds of Iran do not use this term to denote Persians, Azeris and Southern Kurds.&lt;ref&gt;Mahmood Reza Ghods, ''A comparative historical study of the causes, development and effects of the revolutionary movements in northern Iran in 1920-21 and 1945-46''.

*Adjam, Hajjam, Ajaim, Ajami, Akham (as Axam in Spain for ajam), Ayam in Europe.
*In [[Turkish language|Turkish]], the usage of the term is not applied to any ethnic group, but instead appears to have evolved from the original Arabic usage for outsiders in-general and shifted into a different meaning as the term ''ajemi'' (in modern Turkish ''acemi'') literally means ''rookie'', ''clumsy'', ''inept'' or ''novice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishdictionary.net/?word=acemi|title=Turkish Dictionary for Language Learners and Travelers to Turkey|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word, with this meaning, has been borrowed into languages of the former [[Ottoman Empire]] such as [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] (аджамия), [[Serbo-Croatian]] (adžamija), and [[Greek language|Greek]] (ατζαμής) .
*It is also used as a surname.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://static.namesdatabase.com/names2/A/J/Ajam.html|title=Names Database: Ajam Surname|publisher=|accessdate=6 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025653/http://static.namesdatabase.com/names2/A/J/Ajam.html|archivedate=27 September 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Arab music, there is a [[Arabic maqam|maqam]] (musical mode) called ''Ajam'', pejoratively translated to "the Persian mode", corresponding to the major scale in European music.&lt;ref&gt;A. J.

===Work===
Rorty has primarily worked on problems in moral psychology and moral education. She is especially interested in the many distinctive –-and often conflicting—functions of morality as a social practice, as it sets prohibitions, projects ideals, defines duties, characterizes virtues. Exploring the dark side of some of the virtues—courage as bravado, integrity as moral narcissism, the ambivalence of love--, she has also analyzed the advantages of resistance to the obligations of morality: the benefits of self-deception, the lures of moral weakness, the wisdom of ambivalence, the hidden rationale of allegedly irrational emotions. She approaches many of these issues historically (through Aristotle, Spinoza, Hume and Freud) and anthropologically (projecting a study of exiles, immigrants, refugees. who perforce absorb a new set of ‘moral’ values.) She is presently finishing a book provisionally entitled ''On the Other Hand: The Ethics of Ambivalence''.

Rorty is the author of over 120 scholarly articles and the author or editor of more than a dozen scholarly books of original essays. A monograph, ''Mind in Action: Essays in Philosophy of Mind'', was published by Beacon Press in 1988 (paperback edition 1991). She also edited and contributed to ''Explaining Emotions'' (U. California Press, 1980), ''Essays on Aristotle’s Ethics'' (1980, U.California Press), and co-edited ''Essays on Aristotle’s De Anima'' (Oxford, 1992) with Martha Nussbaum. She initiated and served as general editor of ''Modern Studies in Philosophy'' (Doubleday-Anchor) and of ''Major Thinkers'' (University of California Press). Other notable books she edited include ''The Many Faces of Evil'' (Routledge, 2001), ''The Identities of Persons'' (1976, U. California Press) and ''The Many Faces of Philosophy'' (Oxford, 2000).

'''Cari-kalamator ''' ({{lang-fa|کاریکلماتور}}) is the name of the [[Parviz Shapour]]'s writings. The first time the term was used was in the Khoosheh Journal's editorial in 1968. in that Journal, [[Ahmad Shamlou]] said: this word is derived from "[[caricature]]" and "kalameh" (in [[Persian language|Persian]]: کلمه) (it means [[word]]). Shapour's writings are cartoons that have been expressed through words.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tebyan.net/literary_Criticism/2010/6/6/126024.html کاریکلماتور چیست؟]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cemar Clay Products''' was a California pottery operating between 1935 and 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chipman|first=Jack|title=Collector's Encyclopedia of California Pottery|year=1999|publisher=Collector Books|location=Paducah, Kentucky|isbn=1574320378|pages=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cemar's art pottery products, including tableware, are sought-after collectables today.

==History==
Cemar was founded by Cliff J. Malone and Paul Cauldwell, two former employees of the well-established (J.A.) [[Bauer Pottery]]. Cemar Pottery, like Bauer, was based in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cemar Clay Products|url=http://www.calpotteries.com/gallery/cemar/|publisher=Potteries of California|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cemar was part of the larger boom in [[California pottery]] during the World War II era when pottery imports from Asia were restricted or banned; a variety of potteries operated in California to keep up with domestic demand. Cemar was one of 13 members of the California Pottery Guild in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Department store economist|title=Article|year=1952|volume=15|pages=111|publisher=Chilton Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cemar's products include giftware, tableware, and garden pottery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cemar Clay Products|url=http://www.calpotteries.com/gallery/cemar/|publisher=Potteries of California|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Cemar's designs were created by potter Fred Kaye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cemar Clay Products|url=http://www.calpotteries.com/gallery/cemar/|publisher=Potteries of California|accessdate=October 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many items feature vegetable or fruit designs, or animal designs. Cemar products were produced in many novelty forms, including pineapple-shaped dinnerware. Items were priced at a somewhat higher-end for casual china, selling at around $7.50 for a place setting in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Department store economist|title=Article|year=1952|volume=15|pages=112|publisher=Chilton Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cemar's products were featured in numerous women's magazines targeting their marketing towards America's newly affluent middle class housewives: ''[[Better Homes and Gardens (magazine)|Better Homes and Gardens]]'' in 1949;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Better homes and gardens|title=Article|year=1949|volume=27|issue=7-8|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[House Beautiful]]'' magazine in 1951;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=House Beautiful|title=Article|year=1951|volume=93|issue=2|pages=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The American Home]]'' in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=American Home|title=Article|year=1953|volume=51|pages=108|publisher=American Home Pub. Co}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Cemar's fish-shaped cookie jars is priced at more than $150 today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chipman|first=Jack|title=Collector's Encyclopedia of California Pottery|year=1999|publisher=Collector Books|location=Paducah, Kentucky|isbn=1574320378|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cemar was bought by [[Bauer Pottery]] in the mid-1950s. Bauer reused a number of the molds formerly used by Cemar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Tuchman, Mitch |author2=Jack Chipman |author3=Peter Brenner |title=Bauer, classic American pottery|year=1995|publisher=Chronicle Books|isbn=9780811809016|pages=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cemar's products are popular with collectors of [[California pottery]] as well as those who look for [[retro style]] designs.

[[Image:Taby kyrka Death playing chess.jpg|thumb|The medieval painting of Death playing chess from [[Täby|Täby Church]] in [[Sweden]].]]
The phrase '''cheating death''' is commonly used to describe the manner in which a person avoids a possibly fatal event or who prolongs their life in spite of considerable odds. A person who cures themselves of [[cancer]] without [[chemotherapy]], a person who avoids by a narrow margin falling off a cliff or building or being shot or stabbed, or a person who survives hospitalization in [[critical condition]] in spite of a poor [[prognosis]] from doctors all might be described as having "cheated death". In [[Greek mythology]], [[Sisyphus]] cheated death twice: by trapping [[Thanatos]] in his own chains and then by tricking [[Persephone]] into letting him return. He was finally sentenced to eternal fruitless labor in [[Tartarus]] for his presumption.

Although it is difficult to find information about the origin of the phrase, it may be related to [[anthropomorphism]] of [[death]], more commonly known in the [[English-speaking world]] as [[the Grim Reaper]]. Such personification has also led to a wide variety of [[popular culture|pop-culture]] references, such as in [[Ingmar Bergman|Ingmar Bergman's]] film ''[[The Seventh Seal]]'', in which a knight proposes a wager with death over a game of [[chess]]. In the film the knight comments that he knows death plays chess because he's seen it in paintings, possibly in reference to a medieval painting of death playing chess which hangs in [[Täby church|Täby Church]] in [[Sweden]]. Playing chess offers the knight an opportunity to [[cheating in chess|cheat]].

Cheating death is also a recurring theme in the [[Final Destination (film series)|''Final Destination'' film series]].

[[File:Buenos Aires city bus.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Lots of character classic "short snout" 1969 MB LO1112 ''colectivo'' at the [[Mercedes-Benz Museum]] in Stuttgart.]]
'''''Colectivo''''' ([[English language|English]]: collective [[bus]]) is the name given in [[Argentina]], [[Colombia]], [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Uruguay]] to a type of [[public transportation]] vehicle, especially those of Argentina's [[Capital (political)|capital city]], [[Buenos Aires]]. The name comes from ''vehículos de transporte colectivo'' ("vehicles for collective transport"), reflecting their origin as [[shared taxi]]s.&lt;ref name=busarg&gt;[http://www.busarg.com.ar/evolucion.htm The design evolution of the colectivo]. Article with much information and many photographs, accessed 10 April 2010 {{Sp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When they first appeared in the 1920s, ''colectivos'' were small [[bus]]es built out of smaller vehicle [[chassis]] (cars, vans, etc.) and, later, out of [[truck]] chassis (1950&amp;ndash;1990, by [[Mercedes-Benz]] Argentina),&lt;ref name=busarg/&gt; not specifically designed for the transportation of people, and were decorated with unique hand-painted drawings (''[[fileteado]]'') that gave each unit a distinct flavor.

They steadily evolved and grew larger, but kept their picturesque style until the 1990s, when the urban fleet was modernized with standard rear-engined bus units.&lt;ref name=busarg/&gt;

During most of their history, tickets were sold by the driver, who would drive off as soon as all passengers had boarded, selling tickets while driving.

==History==

===1928&amp;ndash;1950===
[[File:Colectivo Chevrolet 1934.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1934 Chevrolet truck chassis ''colectivo'']]
'''Taxi-bus, Chevrolet Double Phaeton, creation of the "líneas"'''

In the 1900s Argentina was the "Granary of the World", one of the largest world food producers and exporters, and a wealthy country. The streets of prosperous Buenos Aires (with 2 million inhabitants) soon filled with cars.
Commercial relations with the [[United Kingdom]] (mainly trade in meat and grain), also brought a myriad of investors and enterprises in the early years of the century, including [[Latin America]]'s [[Buenos Aires Metro|first metro system]], [[car]]s, [[train]]s, [[tram]]ways, [[taxicab|taxi]]s and public buses.

&lt;!--Verification needed–But in 1929 the [[Great Depression]] hit, and the local cab owners attempted a radical change. They modified their taxi units, widening the back seats to allow more than one passenger per trip.–Verification needed--&gt;
On 24 September 1928, the first taxi-bus ran through Buenos Aires. Later called "colectivo", it was based on an Argentine-manufactured longer-wheelbase Chevrolet Superior K-series  Double [[Phaeton body|Phaeton]] called "[[Chevrolet#Argentina|Especial Argentino]]". It provided public transportation throughout Buenos Aires on pre-defined itineraries and stops, charging a low price for each passenger.

[[Chevrolet]] started manufacturing a truck chassis adaptable to passenger transport. By the 1930s the size of the colectivo had increased from five to up to a dozen seats, and the Chevrolet line had become widely used, with bodies made by local companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auto-historia.com.ar/Historias/GM_Argentina.htm www.auto-historia.com] History of General Motors in Argentina - accessed 15 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This style was kept until the 1970s and 1980s, by which time the units had twenty seats plus cramped room for many standing passengers.

During its heyday, drivers deliberately challenged the "real" public buses and electric tramways, parking near them at the busiest stations and driving close to them during the day to pick up their passengers. Soon people started to prefer these ''colectivos'', which displaced the original buses and trams.

With time the routes were formalized, and owners of ''colectivos'' joined together into lines that operated standard routes, distinguished by numbers displayed on the ''colectivos''. Since several lines often traversed the same roads, companies began to adopt different colors to distinguish their units more clearly than by the number alone. [[Colectivo 60|Line 60]], a particularly well-known line with a long route, had its beginnings in this era.

===1950&amp;ndash;1990===
[[Image:Mercedesmotorhome.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Classic Mercedes Benz LO 3500 colectivo turned motorhome]]
'''Mercedes-Benz truck and buses'''

After [[World War II]] and during the 1950s Argentine industry started to develop again, but the country's public transport system was inadequate for the new era: practically no modernization had taken place since the early years, and the suburban railway system was not sufficient to meet the rising demands of the population.

Mercedes-Benz moved into the ''colectivo'' market: in 1951 the then Daimler-Benz AG set up in Argentina its first factories outside [[Germany]]&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;Mercedez-Benz history [http://www.duttondirect.com/history/view/make:mercedes-benz www.duttondirect.com] accessed 8 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.auto-historia.com.ar/Historias/Mercedes%20Historia.htm www.mercedes-benz.argentina/history] accessed 9 May 2008 {{Sp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; one in the town of [[San Martín, Buenos Aires|San Martín]], near Buenos Aires, and another in [[González Catán]].

Mercedes released updated local colectivo chassis, a modified L 3500 truck chassis – LO&amp;nbsp;3500, OP&amp;nbsp;3500, LO&amp;nbsp;311, LO&amp;nbsp;312, LO 911 (the [O] stands for Omnibus) – with a separately manufactured body fitted later by different [[coachbuilder]]s. In less than a decade the output was 6,500 units a year. In 1963 Mercedes built the 10,000nd colectivo (model LO&amp;nbsp;312), and continued with other models, such as L&amp;nbsp;1112 (120 [[horsepower|HP]]), LA&amp;nbsp;1112 (all-wheel traction) and the L&amp;nbsp;1114. The Mercedes-Benz colectivos had truck powerplants, a diesel engine with power transmitted to the rear axle by a five-speed constant-mesh gearbox.

All the lines progressively adopted these units and, from 1950 to 1990, all colectivos were eventually Mercedes-Benz models{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}.

===1990s to the present===
'''Omnibus. Blurring of the tradition of the colectivo'''

In 1987 [[El Detalle]], one of the bus body suppliers of Mercedes-Benz, started competing with its former chassis provider, investing in low price and modern urban buses, with cheaper [[Deutz AG|Deutz]] engines. That same year model El Detalle OA-101 was launched. This model was rear-engined and had [[pneumatic]] suspension, providing smoother rides and more inside space.
Mercedes-Benz responded the following year with the rear-engined OH-1314, but that was considered "the death of the Colectivo",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.busarg.com.ar/evolucion.htm www.busarg.com.ar] {{Sp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; certainly the end of an era.

In 1989 the last truck-based colectivos, on the classic Mercedes-Benz chassis LO-1114, were assembled. Production had been discontinued the previous year.

During the 1990s some companies found it cheaper to switch to single-colored units, and a flurry of mergers and foldings changed the appearance of colectivos.

Nowadays, only the three-digit numbering and some of the routes survive from the traditional "líneas", ''[[fileteado]]'' is rarely seen, the ''filigranas'' were lost, and some of the classic big details, such as the panoramic mirrors close to the driver's head, disappeared.

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:colectivo-045-02-boleto.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Modern automatized ''boletos'' (after 1995)]] --&gt;
After 1995 automatic ticket machines made journeys safer, since drivers did not have to sell tickets and drive at the same time.

In 2005 Mercedes-Benz units accounted for about half of the buses in the city of Buenos Aires and its surroundings, with units built in [[Buenos Aires]] (La Favorita, Eivar, Italbus, Bimet-Corwin, Galicia, CND, CEAP, Ugarte, etc.) and in [[Brazil]] (Marcopolo, CAIO and others). The other half were El Detalle units and others such as [[Scania (company)|Scania]], [[Volvo Buses|Volvo]], [[Dimex]], [[Zanello]] and very few [[Ferroni]].

Most older units have been retired from service in Buenos Aires, as they are considered too dangerous and noisy for use in the fast-paced city. They were disposed of, or sent to smaller cities all over the country. Colectivos are usually retired only when they are too damaged to be repaired; some of them have “resuscitated” as fine motorhomes.

==Description of the ''colectivo''==
The Mercedes units were more sophisticated than the original ''taxi-bus'' but the body kept its artistic touches, preserving the original style of the ''colectivo''. This style was not influenced by the social class of the districts through which the ''colectivos'' journeyed. All the units of all the ''"líneas"'' shared these characteristics until the 1990s:
[[Image:Megabus 60 (Wiki).jpg|right|250px|thumb|Latest generation colectivo]]

===Multi-colored units===
Decorators used many colorful combinations over the units' external body, helping identify each one of the ''líneas''. These eventually evolved into "corporate colors": when one company ran several lines, they painted buses on all lines in the same colors. Until the 1990s the ''fileteado'', individual to each bus, was maintained.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[image:colectivo-045-00-monedas.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Coin container (before automation, in 1995)]] --&gt;

===''Fileteados''===
{{Main|Fileteado}}
''Fileteado'' has been defined as: "art on wheels": full of colored ornaments and symmetries completed with poetic phrases, sayings and aphorisms, both humorous or roguish, emotional or philosophical".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinianoarce.com/#english www.martinianoarce.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
The  colectivos were where this art found its best canvas. Long, wide mirrors placed around the driver seat often had winding drawings and motifs that usually portrayed the driver's preferences in [[football (soccer)|football]], [[religion]] and [[Tango music|tango]].
The outside of the units was also painted with ''fileteado'' details, flower motifs, [[Flag of Argentina|national flags]], and football team banners. It was also very common to see phrases written down in complex fonts, usually at the back. These phrases were often ingenious [[pun]]s or rhymes and became part of Argentine folklore. A simple example of a very common phrase is: ''Lo mejor que hizo la vieja es el pibe que maneja'' (loosely "The best thing my mum did was this bus-driving kid").

===Other details===
The units with a larger budget had more details added around the driver's seat. These usually came in the form of lights of exotic colors or seat covers with wool and fringes or even leather. It was very common to see the gear-stick full of hanging knickknacks and the casing where the tickets and coins were stored covered with motifs.

Before 1995 tickets were sold by the ''colectivero'' (driver) as he drove; they were colored strips of paper with a 5-digit number. [[Palindrome|Palindromic numbers]] (such as ''10301'') were called ''capicuas'' (from [[Catalan language|Catalan]] ''cap i cua'', "head and tail") and sometimes collected.

==Usage in Buenos Aires==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Colectivo Linea 107 .jpg|thumb|right|250px|Monochromatic colour schemes like the one on this line are unusual, since with so many lines in the city multi-coloured combinations are a must.]] --&gt;
[[File:Buenos Aires - Colectivo 194 - 120227 142641.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Colectivo line 194 in Buenos Aires]]
The colectivo bus operations of Buenos Aires provide a widespread and frequent bus service that attracts exceptionally high ridership with virtually no public financial support&lt;ref&gt;[http://trrjournalonline.trb.org/doi/abs/10.3141/1557-07 Transportation Research Board, Buenos Aires Colectivo Buses and Experience with Privatization] accessed 5 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; beyond subsidized petrol to keep fares low.

With low ticket prices, very frequent services, and extensive routes, with many places within 400m of a route, the colectivo is a very widely used mode of transportation around the city. "Porteños" (Autonomous City of Buenos Aires' residents) have a love-hate relationship with the colectivo: on the one hand, they are usually very crowded in [[rush hour]] and plagued with [[pickpocketing|pickpockets]], petty [[theft|thieves]], [[begging|beggars]] and [[hawker (trade)|hawker]]s (itinerant salesmen), though more controlled nowadays. On the other hand, they are a necessity in the city, and a convenient and cheap way to get around. Most colectivos in the big cities of Argentina do not have a fixed timetable, but run at least four, and often many more, services per hour, depending on the bus line and time of day. During night-time, all colectivos in [[Buenos Aires]] city run through their stops at least twice an hour.

===Fares===
Most buses share a basic distance-dependent fare system. {{As of|2016}} the "universal" fare in pesos was:

* [[Argentine peso|ARS]] 9.00 (about USD 0.40) for one section
* ARS 9.25 (about USD 0.42) for two sections (within Buenos Aires, [[Autonomous city|CABA]])
* ARS 9.50 (about USD 0.44) for three sections or more (within Buenos Aires, CABA)
* ARS 9.75 (about USD 0.46) for two sections (Greater Buenos Aires, [[Greater Buenos Aires|GBA]] )
* ARS 10.00 (about USD 0.48) for three sections (Greater Buenos Aires, GBA)

Section boundaries are fixed at about 3&amp;nbsp;km from each other (less so near the city center), so that a 4-kilometer ride may sometimes require to pay the second rate{{Clarify|date=April 2011|reason=surely any 4km trip is 2 sections? If the fare is based on sections, the Fares description needs rewriting}}.

Fares are valid for one bus ride, with no transfer facility.

Some lines operate a number of "diferencial" (premium) buses, with no need to stand and with other amenities, for example curtains, at a higher price.

==In popular culture==

*One of Argentina's best-remembered [[soap opera]]s was called ''Un mundo de 20 asientos'' ("A 20-seat world") and its main character was a ''colectivero'' (colectivo driver).
* Domestically, the colectivo is also called '''''bondi'''''; the word comes from the name of [[Rio de Janeiro]]'s [[tram]]ways (''bondes''), in turn from [[English language|English]] ''bonds'', which is how the government paid for the Rio tramway system to the British company that built it.
*The term colectivo came to be used in some neighbouring countries including [[Paraguay]]. However, the word can also be found in all [[Latinamerica]], particularly [[Colombia]], [[Peru]] (as [[Transport in Lima#Combi and bus|Combi]]), [[Chile]] and [[Nicaragua]].

The '''davul''' or '''atabal''' or '''tabl''' is a large double-headed [[drum]] that is played with mallets. It has many names depending on the country and region. These drums are commonly used in the music of Middle East . These drums have both a deep [[bass drum|bass sound]] and a thin [[treble (sound)|treble]] sound due to their construction and playing style, where different heads and sticks are used to produce different sounds on the same drum.

==Names==
Some names of davuls include:

*'''tupan''' ([[Gora dialect|Goranian]]: Tupan)
*'''davul''' ({{lang-tr|davul}})
*'''davil''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: davil)
*'''daul''', '''tǎpan''', '''tupan''' ({{lang-bg|тъпан, тупан}})
*'''tapan''', '''goč''' (goch) ({{lang-sr|тапан, гоч}})
*'''tapan''' ({{lang-mk|тапан}})
*'''tobă/dobă''' ({{lang-ro |tobă}})
*'''tabl''' ({{lang-ar|tabl}} or ''tabl baladi'')
*'''tof''' ({{lang-he|tof תוף}})
*'''daouli''' ({{lang-el|νταούλι}}),  literally meaning "drum"
*'''lodra''', '''tupana''', '''daulle''' ({{lang-sq|lodra}})
*'''[[dohol]]''' ({{lang-fa|'''دهل''' duhul/dohol}})
*'''doli''' ({{lang-ka|  დოლი  doli}})
*'''dhol''' ({{lang-hy|դհոլ dhol}})
*'''dawola/davola''' ({{lang-syr|ܛܲܒܼܠܵܐ}})
*'''dahol''' ([[Kurdish language|Kurdish]]: ''dahol'')
*'''moldvai dob''' (Hungarian: ''moldvai dob'')

Other [[Greek language|Greek]] names for this drum include Davouli, Argano, Toskani, Tsokani, Toubi, Toubaki, Kiossi, Tavouli, Pavouli, Toubano, and Toubaneli.  Additionally, other names for the daouli, depending on the area, include toumpano, tymbano, or toumbi, which stem from the [[ancient Greek]] word tympano; this word exists in English in the word [[tympani]] for the drum section in the modern classical orchestra and the tympanic membrane for the [[eardrum]].

==Traditional uses==
In the southern Balkans, the rhythm of the tapan is complex and utilizes many accents in numerous traditional time signatures. In Macedonia, tapans are most often used to accompany other instruments such as the [[zurla (instrument)|zurla]] and [[gaida]], while in Bulgaria they usually accompany [[gaida]] and [[gadulka]].  They are also played solo in some Albanian, Bulgarian and Macedonian folk dances and songs. For centuries the tapan is irreplaceable at Bulgarian village festivities such as weddings and celebrations of patron saints of homes and villages. In Romania and Moldova the toba is sometimes used to accompany dances. In the regions of Moldavia, Maramures and Bihor there are also some varieties with a small cymbal mounted on top. They are generally struck with a wooden mallet on one skin and with a thinner stick on the rim or cymbal.

In Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia, the davul is most commonly played with the [[zurna]], although it can be played with other instruments and in ensembles as well. It has also traditionally been used for communication and for Turkish [[mehter]], or [[janissary]] music. In Iraq and the Levant, it is predominantly used in [[Assyrian folk dance]] and [[Assyrian folk/pop music]], among [[Assyrian people]], which are mostly accompanied by a [[zurna]], a [[wind instrument]]. In Armenia the dhol does not have as large of a circumference and is usually played with the hands, although a wooden, spoon-shaped drumstick is also used. It is frequently heard in Armenian folk music. Not only is it in folk music but also in modern music as well, even having solos in many prominent songs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://karalahana.com/english/dauli-drum.html Dauli - Davul of Turkey.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140930225349/http://www.karalahana.com/english/dauli-drum.html |date=2014-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction==
[[File:Karagoez davulcu2.jpg|thumb|right|''Davul'' in shadow puppet theater. Here, [[Karagöz and Hacivat|Karagöz]] is shown with his ''davul''.]]
The drum shell is made of hard wood, perhaps walnut or chestnut, though many woods may be in use depending on the region where the drum is made.  To make the shell, the wood is boiled in water to make it bendable, and then it is bent into a cylindrical shape and fastened together.  The [[drumhead|heads]] are usually goat skin, and they are shaped into circles by wooden frames.  However, one head may be goat skin to provide a higher tone, while the other head can be sheepskin, calfskin, or even donkey-skin to provide a lower tone.  Some say that wolf skin and even dog skin are preferred.&lt;ref name=gkins&gt;{{cite web|title=Greek Musical Instruments|url=http://www.greekfolkmusicanddance.com/instruments.php |publisher=John Pappas |accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rope threaded back and forth across the shell of the drum, from head to head in a zigzag pattern, holds the heads on the drum and provides tension for tuning the drum.  Sometimes metal rings or leather straps join neighboring strands of the rope in order to allow for further tuning.  Two rings are sometimes attached to the main rope where a belt-like rope is threaded through to hold the drum.

In the former Yugoslavian republics and Bulgaria, the tapan is made in two dimensions, {{lang-bg|golem}}, at about 50 – 55&amp;nbsp;cm diameter, and {{lang-bg|mal}} or tapanche, at about 30 – 35&amp;nbsp;cm diameter.

In Turkey, davuls typically range in size from 60&amp;nbsp;cm to 90&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter.  Cow hide is used for the bass pitch drum head side, while goat skin is used for the thin, high pitched side.

In Greece, daouli can be 12 to 14&amp;nbsp;inches for the toumbi up to 3 to 4 feet for daouli.  Commonly the drum is about 20 to 30&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref name="gkins"/&gt;

==Playing style==
Players often use a rope hooked to the drum to hold the drum sideways, so that one head is accessible with the left hand and one with the right.  Each hand is usually dedicated to playing one side of the drum exclusively, though this can vary by local style and tradition.

Drummers of this drum typically uses two kinds of sticks. The drummer plays the accented beats with the dominant hand on the side of the drum with the thicker skin, using a special stick known as the {{lang-bg|kukuda or ukanj}}, {{lang-tr|tokmak}}, or {{lang-el|daouloxylo}} (daouli stick).&lt;ref name="gkins"/&gt;  This stick is a thick pipe-like stick about 440&amp;nbsp;mm long, which is often made with walnut.  Its thick shape as well as the thickness of the head give the accented beats a low, full sound.  Sometimes the drumhead played with the thick stick is also muted with a cloth to enhance the fundamental low note of the drum.  Unaccented beats are played by the nondominant hand on the side of the drum having the thin skin, using a thin stick or switch called {{lang-bg|pracka}}, {{lang-tr|çubuk}}, or {{lang-el|daouloverga}} (daouli switch).&lt;ref name="gkins"/&gt;  This thin stick is often held cross-grip, and the drummer can quickly hit thin accent strokes by gently twisting the wrist.  These thin sticks are often made from soft wood such as willow or [[European Cornel|cornel]].

The Balkan school of tapan playing presumes the playing (not the accompaniment) of a melody, where the non-dominant hand is used to express all that the player wishes to say, while the dominant hand is only used to accentuate certain moments in the melody.

The Australian drummer Chris Mitrevski pioneered a hybrid style of playing, relying on multiple accented notes played by the non-dominant hand. This style is difficult to play but results in a very complex poly-rhythm, with the dominant hand accenting the down beat.

'''''Death and Memory in Early Medieval Britain''''' is an [[archaeology|archaeological]] study of mnemonic elements in the funerary practices of Early Medieval Britain, written by the British archaeologist [[Howard Williams (archaeologist)|Howard Williams]].
The book was first published by [[Cambridge University Press]] as part of their series "Cambridge Studies in Archaeology" in 2006.

==Synopsis==
[[File:Sutton Hoo Burial Mound cleaned.jpg|thumb|right|240px|The Mound 2 burial tumuli at Sutton Hoo, Suffolk. Williams discusses the mnemonic effect that monuments such as these would have had on the population.]]
The first chapter, "Death, Memory and Material Culture", serves as an introduction to Williams' approach. Stating that "mortuary practices can be conceptualised as strategies for remembering and forgetting", he discusses the influence of [[sociology]]. and [[anthropology]] on his study before exploring the Anglo-Saxon cemetery at [[Swallowcliffe Down]].{{sfn|Williams|2006|pp=1&amp;ndash;35}} Chapter two, "Objects of memory", examines the inclusion of [[grave goods]] in Early Medieval burials, among them jewellery and weaponry, emphasising the mnemonic effects that these might have had on those attending the funeral.{{sfn|Williams|2006|pp=36&amp;ndash;78}} In "Remembering through the body", Williams examines mnemonic elements to the manner in which the corpse was prepared before cremation or inhumation, resulting in its burial.{{sfn|Williams|2006|pp=79&amp;ndash;116}}

Chapter four, "Graves as mnemonic compositions", argued that Early Medieval graves were "mnemonic performances aimed at constructing the present in relation to the past and future." Looking at the sequence of scenes that onlookers would have witnessed, it discusses graves and grave structures, before using [[Snape Anglo-Saxon Cemetery|Snape]], [[Sutton Hoo]], and the northern [[cist]] burials, as case studies.{{sfn|Williams|2006|pp=117&amp;ndash;144}}

The fifth chapter, "Monuments and memory", focuses on the way in which [[cairn]]s and burial mounds were erected to commemorate the death, also looking at ring ditches and Pictish symbol stones.{{sfn|Williams|2006|pp=145&amp;ndash;178}} "Death and landscape" takes a wider view of the relation between Early Medieval burials and the wider landscape, discussing the reuse of prehistoric monuments, and the relation between burials and routeways, settlements, and significant natural places. Highlighting that not all Early Medieval burials are in cemeteries, Williams looks to literary evidence from land charters and ''[[Beowulf]]'' to theorise mortuary landscapes.

==Reception==

===Academic reviews===
[[Leslie Webster (art historian)|Leslie Webster]] of the [[British Museum]] reviewed the tome for the peer-reviewed journal ''[[Antiquity (journal)|Antiquity]]''. Describing it as a "excellent book", she welcomed it as the "first extended study" into how the dead were remembered in Early Medieval British society. Although noting that churches, domestic architecture, and stone monuments were not discussed, she believed that Williams used sufficient evidence to illustrate his "firm command" of the subject. Praising the presentation of the evidence and the "particularly elegant" illustrations, she believed that he would have benefitted from including information on the [[Royal Saxon tomb in Prittlewell|Prittlewell Prince]] burial, [[Franks Casket]], and a wider array of contemporary literary sources. More critically, she noted the existence of several typos in the text, believing that it could have benefited from a "firmer editorial hand", and believed that its "textbook style" made the work difficult to read at points.{{sfn|Webster|2007|pp=1115&amp;ndash;1116}}

In the ''[[Time and Mind]]'' journal, George Nash reviewed Williams' book.{{sfn|Nash|2008}}

DHSI's course offerings run parallel to the DHSI Conference &amp; Colloquium, formerly known as the DHSI Colloquium. Founded in 2009 by Diane Jakacki and Cara                Leitch, the event invited graduate-only submissions until 2011.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dhsicolloquium.org/about|title=DHSI Colloquium: About|last=|first=|date=|website=DHSI Colloquium|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O’Sullivan|first=James|last2=Galvin|first2=Mary|last3=Jakacki|first3=Diane|date=2016|title=Introduction to the Digital Humanities Summer Institute Colloquium Special Issue|url=http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dhq/vol/10/1/000241/000241.html|journal=Digital Humanities Quarterly|volume=10|issue=1|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
DHSI started in 2001 at [[Vancouver Island University]]. The inaugural DHSI event included lead speakers Susan Hockey, Nancy Ide, Willard McCarty, and [[John Unsworth]], and there were some 35 participants in attendance.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2004, DHSI moved to the University of Victoria, where it currently resides.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Bialkowski, Voytek, Rebecca Niles, Alan Galey (2011-04/05).

'''''Eaters of the Dead: The Manuscript of Ibn Fadlan Relating His Experiences with the Northmen in AD 922''''' (later republished as '''''The 13th Warrior''''' to correspond with the [[The 13th Warrior|film adaptation of the novel]]) is a 1976 [[novel]] by [[Michael Crichton]]. The story is about a 10th-century Muslim Arab who travels  with a group of [[Vikings]] to their settlement.

Crichton explains in an appendix that the book was based on two sources. The first three chapters are a retelling of [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]]'s personal account of his actual journey north and his experiences with and observations of Vikings (probably from [[Sweden]]). The remainder is based upon the story of ''[[Beowulf]]''.

==Plot summary==
The novel is set in the 10th century. The [[Caliph of Baghdad]], [[Al-Muqtadir]], sends his ambassador, [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]], to the king of the [[Volga Bulgars]]. He never arrives but is instead conscripted by a group of [[Vikings]] to take part in a hero's quest to the north. Ahmad ibn Fadlan is taken along as the thirteenth member of their group to comply with a soothsayer's requirement for success. There they battle with the 'mist-monsters', or 'wendol', a tribe of vicious savages (suggested by the narrator to have been possibly [[relict]] [[Neanderthals]]) who go to battle wearing bear skins.

''Eaters of the Dead'' is narrated as a scientific commentary on an old manuscript. The narrator describes how the story told is a composite of extant commentaries and translations of the works of the original story teller. There are several references during the narration to a possible change or mistranslation of the original story by later copiers. The story is told by several different voices: the editor/narrator, the translators of the script and the original author, ibn Fadlan, as well as his descriptions of stories told by others. A sense of authenticity is supported by occasional explanatory footnotes with references to a mixture of factual and fictitious sources.

==Sources and inspiration==
In an afterword in the novel Crichton gives a few comments on its origin. A good friend of Crichton's was giving a lecture on the "Bores of Literature". Included in his lecture was an argument on ''[[Beowulf]]'' and why it was simply uninteresting. Crichton stated his views that the story was not a bore and was, in fact, a very interesting work. The argument escalated until Crichton stated that he would prove to him that the story could be interesting if presented in the correct way.&lt;ref&gt;Popular Culture Studies Across the Curriculum: Essays for Educators, edited by Ray B. Browne, McFarland &amp; Company, Inc, Publishers, Jefferson, North Carolina, and London, 2005.  “When he [Crichton] discovered that a friend was using Beowulf as a springboard for a new college course entitled, “The Great Bores”… Crichton pointed out that Beowulf contains all of the aspects of today’s best action adventure stories.  Subsequently, he set out on a mission to prove his point.  In 1976, Crichton’s answer, Eaters of the Dead, hit bookstore shelves.”1  [Footnote] 1. Crichton, Michael.  “A Factual Note on Eaters of the Dead.”  The 13th Warrior: Previously Published as Eaters of the Dead. New York: Ballentine, 1976. 270. &lt;/ref&gt;

In a seemingly offhand reference, [[Abdul Alhazred|Abdul Alḥaẓred's]] ''[[Necronomicon]]'' (of [[H. P. Lovecraft]] fame) is quoted in the in-character bibliography.

==Reception==
The critic from the ''New York Times'' called it "diverting but disappointing".&lt;ref&gt;With real and bogus footnotes: Eaters Of the Dead
By JACK SULLIVAN. New York Times (1923-Current file) [New York, N.Y] 25 Apr 1976: 253.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chicago Tribune'' said it was "funny, fascinating and informative".&lt;ref&gt;Crichton's creative play: Eaters of the Dead
Oberbeck, S K. Chicago Tribune (1963-Current file) [Chicago, Ill] 25 Apr 1976: f6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film adaptation==
In 1979 it was announced the movie version of the novel would be made by the newly formed [[Orion Pictures]] with Crichton himself to direct.&lt;ref&gt;Orion: A Humanistic Production
Kilday, Gregg. Los Angeles Times (1923-Current File) [Los Angeles, Calif] 05 Jan 1979: f13.&lt;/ref&gt; This did not occur.

The novel was adapted into film as ''[[The 13th Warrior]]'' (1999), directed by [[John McTiernan]] and released by Walt Disney Pictures through its [[Touchstone Pictures|Touchstone]] banner. Crichton himself did some uncredited directing for a reshoot after Disney fired McTiernan for various reasons, one of which was going far over budget. [[Antonio Banderas]] played Ibn Fadlan. Crichton writes that he was "quite pleased" with the film, though it earned mixed reviews and performed poorly at the [[box office]], earning about $62 million worldwide; the film's budget was more than $100 million.&lt;ref name="Dirks (2010)"&gt;Dirks, T. 2010.

Historically, various series of eight views were produced; in some cases, such as in the ''[[Eight Views of Xiaoxiang]]'' multiple series, a whole artistic tradition was developed, with a number of artists doing versions of the series. Series of eight views typically appeared in poetry and paintings in the olden times; and now, they may appear in local governments' advertisements to tourists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5561">'''''The El Salvador Reconstruction and Development Project''''' is a charitable volunteer project from [[Imperial College|Imperial College London]]'s Department of [[Civil Engineering|Civil]] and [[Environmental Engineering]] which was launched in reaction to two major earthquakes that struck the country of [[El Salvador]] in 2001. The project has a voluntary student membership basis and is concentrated in rural, mainly underdeveloped areas of the country.

Team leadership and student involvement interchange on an annual basis with the start of a new academic year. The project is supported by a board of Alumni members.

==History==
{{main|2001 El Salvador earthquakes}}

As a result of the large magnitude [[earthquakes]] that killed at least 844 people,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reliefweb.int/rwarchive/rwb.nsf/db900sid/OCHA-64DFMC?OpenDocument ReliefWeb - El Salvador Earthquake: Emergency Update 02 Feb 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; students from Imperial College London's Civil Engineering Department volunteered to work on a development project from 2002 onwards, to be concentrated in the country's poorest communities over subsequent academic years.

Students from several universities and disciplines have travelled along to El Salvador and worked with the relevant community for 5 to 7 weeks on various development projects. The typical student intake over a particular year varies between 11-13.

Communities helped by the El Salvador Project: [[Estanzuelas]], [[Usulután]] (2002), [[San Emigdio]], [[La Paz Department (El Salvador)|La Paz]] (2003, 2004, 2005), [[Santa Marta]], [[San Vicente, El Salvador|San Vicente]] (2006, 2007), [[Colima]], [[Cuscatlán Department|Cuscatlán]] (2009)

The project receives most of its finance from company sponsors. From the appointment of a particular year's members to the end of the relevant academic year the student body is further involved in [[fundraising]] events, which in the past has included evening sales and a marathon style run in the Netherlands.
On 17 April 2009 the project competed in the [[JP Morgan]] Good Venture Case competition in New York City, where it won $25,000 to fund its activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurocareers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure JP Morgan - Good Venture Case Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713121904/http://eurocareers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure |date=2011-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 December 2009 the project secured a further $15,000 from JP Morgan's online global [https://web.archive.org/web/20100105161900/http://careers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure/gia Give-it-Away] competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eurocareers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure/gia JP Morgan - Give-it-Away Competition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330093609/http://eurocareers.jpmorgan.com/student/jpmorgan/careers/goodventure/gia |date=2010-03-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 Project==
This year's project was based in the community of [[Colima]] in the Department of [[Cuscatlán]]. Two reinforced [[earthquake]] resistant houses were constructed, in addition to a [[retaining wall]]. The design of the houses was presented by the Reconstruction and Development Organization of El Salvador ([http://www.redes.org/ REDES]), a national NGO which works closely with the project and oversees the construction process.

==Future activities==
In association with the [[British people|British]] [[Geological]] Survey [[seismologists]] from among others the Department of Civil Engineering of Imperial College London predict an increasing risk posed by earthquakes in El Salvador in the near future due to rapid population expansion exacerbated by [[deforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsevier.com/locate/soildyn The El Salvador earthquakes of January and February 2001: context, characteristics and implications for seismic risk]&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the floods and landslides in November 2009 that left at least 192 people dead,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/breaking-news/world-news/192-dead-in-el-salvador-mudslides-1944239.html 192 dead in El Salvador mudslides]&lt;/ref&gt; REDES will likely be appointing a specifically badly struck geographical entity for consideration under the 2010 project.

Plans for future improvement that are currently awaiting approval include the expansion of a particular year's activities to cover more than one community, spreading out the construction work by sending over teams outside the summer term period and expansion of the concept of the project to cover communities in the neighbouring countries of [[Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]].

==2014 Project==
The 2014 project will involve the project team travelling to Guatemala for the first time. A house design developed in conjunction with Arup will be tested on an earthquake simulator at the [[Universidad Mariano Galvez|University Mariano Galvez]] in Guatemala City. The team will then construct a second house within a community in El Salvador.

'''Enotourism''', '''oenotourism''', '''wine tourism''', or '''vinitourism''' refers to [[tourism]] whose purpose is or includes the tasting, consumption or purchase of [[wine]], often at or near the source.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wineonsix.com/about/ "About Wine on VI"] Wine on VI&lt;/ref&gt; Where other types of tourism are often passive in nature, enotourism can consist of visits to wineries, [[Wine tasting|tasting wines]], vineyard walks, or even taking an active part in the harvest.

==History==
Enotourism is a relatively new form of tourism. Its history varies greatly from region to region, but in places such as the [[Napa Valley AVA]] and [[Wine Country]], it saw heavy growth once a concerted marketing effort was implemented in 1975 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.napavintners.com/about/ab_2_overview.aspx "History and Timeline"] Napa Valley Vintners&lt;/ref&gt; that was given a further boost by the 1976 [[Judgment of Paris (wine)|Judgment of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/wine/article/The-story-behind-the-story-that-made-wine-history-2662065.php "The story behind the story that made wine history"] San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/ref&gt;

Other regions, such as [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]] have only started marketing enotourism starting in the mid-2000s, primarily focusing on how it is an alternative form of tourism to the beach for which Spain is overall known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catalannewsagency.com/life-style/item/enotourism-the-alternative-to-classical-sun-and-sand-in-el-garraf "Enotourism: the alternative to classical sun and sand in El Garraf"] Catalan News Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a rise in the profile of enotourism among English speakers with the 2004 release of the film, [[Sideways]] whose two central characters visit wineries and wine in the [[Santa_Barbara_County,_California#Santa_Barbara_County_Wine_Country|Santa Barbara region]] of [[Southern California]].

==Currently==
The industry around enotourism has grown significantly throughout the first decade of the 21st century. In the United States 27 million travelers, or 17% of American leisure travelers, engaged in culinary or wine-related activities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eventplanning.about.com/od/venueselection/a/travelstudy.htm "Study: Food and Wine Travel Increases in Popularity"] About.com&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy the figure stands at approximately five million travelers, generating 2.5 billion euros in revenue.&lt;ref name="italymag"&gt;{{cite web 
|url=http://www.italymagazine.com/italy/food-drink/popularity-wine-tourism-grows |title=Popularity of wine tourism grows| accessdate=August 14, 2012 |publisher=Italy Magazine |date=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A private initiative by Recevin [http://www.recevin.net/] holds an annual "Enotourism Day" on the second Sunday of November each year to promote cellar visits in Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Spain, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, and Portugal.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wineonsix.com/enotourism-day-2012-is-coming/ "Enotourism Day 2012 is coming!"] Wine on VI&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, the first Wine Tourism Day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wine Tourism Day|url=http://www.winetourismday.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established for May 11, 2013 with events scheduled throughout the continent.

Chile has grown its enotourism industry in recent years, with several tourist routes being opened throughout the country, with several of them offering overnight accommodations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.winesofchile.org/en/enotourism|title=Enotourism {{!}} Wines of Chile|website=www.winesofchile.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Activities==
[[File:Wine-touring on bikes.jpg|thumb|Cycling through vineyards in Mendoza, Argentina]]
Most visits to the wineries take place at or near the site where the wine is produced. Visitors typically learn the history of the winery, see how the wine is made, and then taste the wines. At some wineries, staying in a small guest house at the winery is also offered. Many visitors buy the wines made by the winery at the premises, accounting for up to 33% of their annual sales.&lt;ref&gt;[https://mindyjoyce.com/2011/07/10/wine-tourism-is-increasingly-being-sought-out-by-travelers-but-is-the-wine-industry-ready/ "Wine tourism is increasingly being sought out by travelers. But, is the wine industry ready?"] mindyjoyce.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Very small, low production regions such as [[Priorat_(DOQ)|Priorat]], [[Catalonia]] focus on small, intimate visits with the owner as the host and include walks through the vineyards to help visitors understand the unique qualities of the region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hudin.com/blog/how-to-visit-priorat/ "How to visit Priorat"] hudin.com&lt;/ref&gt;

More elaborate tastings can include [[Wine_tasting#Vertical_and_horizontal_tasting|horizontal and vertical tastings]] as well as full meals focused upon showcasing the wines.&lt;ref name=Vinologue&gt;{{citation|title=Vinologue Empordà|author=Miquel Hudin &amp; Elia Varela Serra|publisher=[[Vinologue]]|isbn=978-0-983-77184-5|year=2012|pages=360|url=http://www.vinologue.com/books/emporda/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the enotourism industry matures, additional activities have been added to visits such as riding electrically assisted bicycles, called, "burricleta".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catalannewsagency.com/life-style/item/riding-through-the-vineyards-of-penedes "Riding through the vineyards of Penedès"] Catalan News Agency&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
Most tourism agencies see it as a segment of the industry with tremendous growth potential, stating that in some regions, it's only functioning at 20% of its full potential.&lt;ref name="italymag" /&gt;

As enotourism grows, regions such as Napa Valley have to deal with continued success and the effects that come with it, such as crowds and increased tasting room fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winecountrygetaways.com/are-tasting-room-fees-out-of-hand-in-the-napa-valley/ "Are tasting room fees out of hand in the Napa Valley?"] Napa Valley Wine Blog&lt;/ref&gt; This can, in turn have the opposite effect desired wherein potential visitors are driven away and turned off enotourism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wineonsix.com/perhaps-a-reality-check-napa-valley/ "Perhaps a Reality Check, Napa Valley?"] Wine on VI&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Erasing Sherlock''''' is an original novel by [[Kelly Hale]] set in the [[Faction Paradox]] universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?197388 ISFDB Entry for Erasing Sherlock]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the last Faction Paradox novel to be published by [[Mad Norwegian Press]], though not the last in the series. It was later republished by Hale, with references to Faction Paradox material removed, after the [[Mad Norwegian Press]] edition went out of print. Although taking place in a shared universe, either edition of the book is a stand-alone work that does not require any prior knowledge of Faction Paradox. 

The novel was adapted by Kelly Hale from a previous work that she wrote, ''Erasing Sherlock Holmes'', which won a $10,000 award in the Great North American Fiction Contest and was published as an [[e-book]] by PublishingOnline.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forewordmagazine.com/ftw/ftwarchives.aspx?id=20000112.htm Erasing Sherlock ebook]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been described as a "fascinating (and undeservedly obscure) novel" &lt;ref&gt;[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2009/03/10/john-seaveys-storytelling-engines-sherlock-holmes/ Comic Book RTesources - Sherlock Holmes]&lt;/ref&gt; and reviewed in publications ranging from various Sherlock Holmes Society publications to the science fiction, Aeon Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aeonmagazine.tribe.net/ Aeon Magazine September 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
"Seeking maid-of-all-work.  Master of Arts required. Opportunities for research in the field.  Must be able to relocate in time."  A doctoral candidate, in the guise of a housemaid working at [[221B Baker Street]], believes she is there to observe the 25-year-old [[Sherlock Holmes]], and document his methods at the beginning of his career.  She soon learns she is operating under a serious misapprehension.

'''Germaine Monteil''' was a New York-based French fashion designer and [[cosmetician]] who founded the cosmetics and [[perfume]] company sharing her name.

==Fashion==
Born in France in 1898, Monteil moved to the United States in the early 1930s. A high-end dressmaker as well as a [[cosmetician]], she first established herself as a fashion designer.&lt;ref name=asiv&gt;{{cite book| last = Hall| first = Daniel Delis| title = As Seen In Vogue: A Century of American Fashion in Advertising| publisher=Texas Tech University Press| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvilOZhaRkAC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| year = 2007| pages =67| ISBN = 0-89672-616-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made classic dresses with flaring circular or pleated skirts and slim silhouettes, and was renowned for her use of prints which appealed to the American market.&lt;ref name=asiv/&gt; In 1938, Monteil won a [[Neiman Marcus Fashion Award]] in recognition of her influence upon the fashion industry. This was the first year in which the awards were presented. She died in 1987.

==Cosmetics &amp; perfumes==
In 1936, Monteil founded with her husband, Guy Bjorkman, ''Germaine Monteil Cosmetiques Corp.'' as a sideline to her fashion business, offering skin treatments and creams.&lt;ref name=asiv/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sagarin, Edward; {{cite book| last = Balsam| first = M.S| title = Cosmetics, science and technology (2nd edition)| publisher=Wiley-Interscience| year = 1972| pages =217| ISBN = 0-471-04649-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first perfume, ''Laughter'' (later renamed ''Rigolade''), came out in 1941.&lt;ref name=nph&gt;Young, Duane A. &amp; {{cite book| last = Jones-North| first = Jacqueline Y.| title = Commercial Perfume Bottles (2nd edition)| publisher=Schiffer Pub.| year = 1987| pages =| ISBN = 0-88740-108-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The increasing success of this sideline led to Monteil abandoning fashion design in the late 1940s to focus on perfume and cosmetics.&lt;ref name=asiv/&gt; The company was acquired by cosmetics giant Revlon in 1987 from fashion house Yves Saint Laurent. Revlon then sold the brand on to the German company Wilde Cosmetics GmbH in 2006.

Monteil fragrances include:

===Approach===
[[File:Harry S Truman - NARA - 530677 (2).jpg|thumb|right|Hook criticized US President [[Harry S. Truman]] (official portrait)]]
Hook sets out to deal with academic freedom, a topic "bound to displease two articulate groups whose influence is out of all proportion to their numbers"&lt;ref name=HYCN-book/&gt;:
* "Cultural Vigilantes," who have "exaggerated the threat of communism as a domestic danger" and use fear of Communism "to discredit opponents of their pet aversion or panacea," whatever that may be.  They use a common fallacy ("the undistributed middle term") to insinuate that any who does not join them in attacking Communist is therefore a Communist sympathizer (a [[You're either with us, or against us|with us or against us]]-type argument).&lt;ref name=HYCN-book/&gt;
* "Ritualistic Liberals," who "dismiss too lightly the threat of conspiratorial character of the Communist movement" and who have "invented malicious legends about the state of political freedom in this country which fits the Communist picture of a nation under the [[The Iron Heel|iron heel]] of terror."&lt;ref name=HYCN-book/&gt;

Compounding conflicts between these two groups, Hook notes, are government officials who suffer from either "mediocre intelligence" or the "most extraordinary of the nature of the international Communist movement," an example of whose decisions are the [[Truman Doctrine]] (i.e., Hook is criticizing [[New Deal]]/[[Fair Deal]] officials under [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] and [[Harry S. Truman]]).

===Quotes===
[[File:John Dewey cph.3a51565.jpg|thumb|right|Hook quotes [[John Dewey]], his mentor]]

Hook divided the book into two parts, each of which begins with quotes from his choice of most relevant examples:
* Part I:
** [[Socrates]]:  "...[[The unexamined life is not worth living]].." (from [[Plato]]'s ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'')
** [[John Dewey]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The democratic idea of freedom is not the right of each individual to do as he pleases, even if it be qualified by adding 'provided he does not interfere with the same freedom on the part of others.' While the idea is not always, not often enough, expressed in words, the basic freedom is that of freedom of mind and of whatever degree of freedom of action and experience is necessary to produce freedom of intelligence."&lt;ref&gt;

| accessdate = 23 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
* Part II:  ''New School Bulletin'' (1953):  &lt;blockquote&gt;[[The New School]] knows that no man can teach well, nor should he be permitted to teach at all unless he is prepared "to follow the truth of scholarship wherever it may lead." No inquiry is ever made as to whether a lecturer's private views are conservative, liberal, or radical; orthodox or agnostic; views of the aristocrat or commoner.  Jealously safeguarding this precious principle, the New School stoutly affirms that a member of any political party or group which asserts the right to dictate in matters of science or scientific opinion is not free to teach the truth and is thereby disqualified as a teacher. Equally, the New School holds that discrimination on grounds of race, religion or country of origin either among teachers or students runs counter to every profession of freedom and has no place in American education. (''New School Bulletin'', Vol. 10, No. 19, 5 January 1953&lt;ref&gt;

===Conclusion===

Hook concludes:  &lt;blockquote&gt;The chief evil from which the schools suffer is not communism but community neglect, and the failure to make the common and special needs of the individual personality their supreme concern.  Whatever the responsibilities of the schools to a democratic society, the responsibilities of a democratic society to its schools are more basic and more numerous.  These responsibilities have not been adequately discharged.  The need for more schools and better schools, more teachers and better teachers and better-paid teachers, grows.  The perennial need for educational thinking, for a continuously held philosophy of education, has become more acute in the long war for survival and freedom into which we have already entered.  The task of American educators is to integrate the insights of liberal thinks from [[Socrates]] to [[John Dewey]], as well as the insights born of wider scientific knowledge, into a coherent philosophy to make the ''practice'' of education meaningful, excellent, joyful, and free.&lt;ref name=HYCN-book/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
==Reception and criticism==

In 1953, Robert E. Fitch wrote in ''Commentary'' that Hook's book showed "balance and reasonableness" and also its "courage" for including teachers themselves in its criticisms.  It includes a "sharp indictment" of the [[American Association of University Professors]]' Committee on Academic Freedom and Tenure for what Fitch calls its "failure to cope realistically with the problem of Communist infiltration."  Fitch agrees with Hook that Communist affiliation means "active participation in a conspiracy" and thereby renders a teacher "unfit" to teach.  He notes Hook's assertion that "college and university teachers constituted the strongest and most influential group of Communist fellow-travelers in the United States" and agrees with Hook's recommendation that such teachers receive individual care and consideration.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1980, Victor Navasky acknowledged Hook as the "most articulate proponent" of the "doctrine of conspiracy" of the [[Communist Party USA]].  He called the book a "bible for liberals unwilling to fight for the rights of Communists."&lt;ref&gt;

In 1997, [[Christopher Phelps]] wrote, "Hook was a leading figure in the creation of a repressive, censorious atmosphere in higher education, carried out, naturally, under the guise of cultural freedom."  Further, he stated that his book "became perhaps the most influential justification for firing Communists and suspected Communists from university and schools in the early 1950s..."  He noted that, despite an effort at even-handedness, in fact Hook sided with "Cultural Vigilantes" and wound up criticizing them not for their understanding of Communism but their "blundering methods" of eradicating it from school.&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;

In 2004, Matthew J. Cotter argued appreciation for the nuance of Hook's position. Hook had recommended suspension, not removal of teachers once their Part membership become known, followed by inquiry.  However, Cotter challenges Hook's "exaggerated sense of threat posed by Communist conspiracy among American teachers.  If one accepts Hook's premise that Communist conspiracy did involve some American teachers, then Cotter deemed Hook's approach to have "no democratic failing."  Hook clearly called for a third of four steps in his process of inquiry, such that ''prima facie'' evidence of Communist Party membership should not result in automatic dismissal."  In this analysis, Cotter notes his own agreement with similar findings by [[Robert Talisse]].&lt;ref name=Cotter&gt;

In 2015, [[Edward S. Shapiro]] commented, "The bulk of Hook's writings in the 1950s, most notably ''Heresy, Yes–
Conspiracy, No!'' (1953), sought to undo the damage done by McCarthyism."&lt;ref&gt;

==Reconsideration by Hook==

In his memoir ''Out of Step'', Hook wrote "Even though I believed that membership in the [CP] rendered an individual unfit... to be a member of the teaching staff, I did ''not'' believe that the mere fact of membership should result in automatic dismissal."&lt;ref&gt;

The '''Heydar Aliyev Center''' is a {{convert|619000|sqft|m2|disp=flip|abbr=on}} building complex in [[Baku, Azerbaijan]] designed by Iraqi-British architect [[Zaha Hadid]] and noted for its distinctive architecture and flowing, curved style that eschews sharp angles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architectmagazine.com/government-projects/heydar-aliyev-center.aspx Joseph, Giovannini. "Heydar Aliyev Center" September 17, 2013. ]&lt;/ref&gt; The center is named after [[Heydar Aliyev]], the first secretary of [[Soviet Azerbaijan]] from 1969 to 1982, and president of Azerbaijan Republic from October 1993 to October 2003.

==Design==
[[File:Stamps of Azerbaijan, 2012-1036.jpg|150px|thumbnail|left|The Center on a 20-[[qapik]] stamp for the [[2012 Eurovision Song Contest]], held in Baku]]
The Center houses a conference hall (auditorium), a gallery hall and a museum. The project is intended to play an integral role in the intellectual life of the city. Located close to the city center, the site plays a pivotal role in the redevelopment of Baku.

The Heydar Aliyev Center represents a fluid form which emerges by the folding of the landscape's natural topography and by the wrapping of individual functions of the Center. All functions of the Center, together with entrances, are represented by folds in a single continuous surface. This fluid form gives an opportunity to connect the various cultural spaces whilst at the same time, providing each element of the Center with its own identity and privacy. As it folds inside, the skin erodes away to become an element of the interior landscape of the Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zaha-hadid.com/cultural/heydar-aliyev-cultural-centre Zaha Hadid Architects.

An internationally recognized architectural work, the building of the  Heydar Aliyev Center has become a signature landmark of modern Baku due to its innovative and cutting-edge design. Extending on eight floor levels, the center accommodates a 1000-seat auditorium, temporary exhibition spaces, a conference center, workshops, and a museum.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.inexhibit.com/mymuseum/heydar-aliyev-center-baku-azerbaijan-zaha-hadid/ "Heydar Aliyev Center - Baku, Azerbaijan | Zaha Hadid Architects" Inexhibit, October 14, 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2013, the Heydar Aliyev Center held a personal exhibition of the People's Artist of Azerbaijan, vice- president of the Russian Academy of Arts Tahir Salakhov titled “At the turn of the century”. The exhibition was dated for the 85th anniversary of the artist. His great contribution to the development of the Azerbaijani fine art was highlighted at the exhibition opening. The artistic heritage of Tahir Salakhov is an integral part of the art of not only Azerbaijan, but also the entire former Soviet Union. He is recognized as one of the founders of the “severe style” in painting. The exhibition featured over 100 works by the artist, created at different times, and his works on the carpets. There are portraits of Heydar Aliyev, the composer Gara Garayev and Dmitri Shostakovich, the musician Mstislav Rostropovich, the works “Aidan”, “Morning.

The '''history of erotic depictions''' includes [[painting]]s, [[sculpture]], [[photograph]]s, [[drama|dramatic arts]], [[music]] and [[writing]]s that show scenes of a [[human sexuality|sexual]] nature throughout time. They have been created by nearly every civilization, ancient and modern. Early cultures often associated the sexual act with supernatural forces and thus their religion is intertwined with such depictions. In Asian countries such as India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Japan and China, representations of sex and [[erotic art]] have specific spiritual meanings within native religions. The ancient [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] produced much art and decoration of an erotic nature, much of it integrated with their religious beliefs and cultural practices.&lt;ref name = east&gt;{{cite book| last = Rawson| first = Phillip S.| title = Erotic art of the east; the sexual theme in oriental painting and sculpture| publisher = Putnam| year = 1968| location = New York| id = {{LCC|N7260.R35}}| page = 380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = romans&gt;{{cite book| last = Clarke| first = John R.| title = Roman Sex: 100 B.C. to A.D. 250| publisher = Harry N.

In more recent times, as communication technologies evolved, each new technique, such as [[printing]], [[photography]], [[film|motion pictures]] and [[computer]]s, has been adapted to display and disseminate these depictions.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite video|people=Chris Rodley, Dev Varma, Kate Williams III (Directors) Marilyn Milgrom, Grant Romer, Rolf Borowczak, Bob Guccione, [[Dean Kuipers]] (Cast) |date=2006-03-07 |title=Pornography: The Secret History of Civilization |url=http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |medium=DVD |publisher=Koch Vision |location=Port Washington, NY |accessdate=2006-10-21 |isbn=1-4172-2885-7 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822002054/http://www.kochvision.com/product.aspx?number=741952635291 |archivedate=2010-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attitudes through history==
In early times, erotic depictions were often a subset of the indigenous or religious art of cultures and as such were not set aside or treated differently than any other type. The modern concept of [[pornography]] did not exist until the [[Victorian era]]. Its current definition was added in the 1860s, replacing the older one meaning writings about [[prostitution|prostitutes]].&lt;ref name = pleasures&gt;{{cite book| last = Sigel| first = Lisa| title = Governing Pleasures. Pornography and Social Change in England, 1815-1914| publisher = Rutgers University Press| year = 2002| isbn = 0-8135-3001-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It first appeared in an English medical dictionary in 1857 defined as "a description of prostitutes or of prostitution, as a matter of public hygiene."&lt;ref&gt;[[Robley Dunglison|Dunglison, Robley]] (1857). ''Medical lexicon. A dictionary of medical science'', 1857 edition, s.v. [http://dictionary.oed.com/help/bib/oed2-d2.html#dunglison "Pornography"]. From the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], second edition (1989), Oxford University Press, Retrieved on November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1864, the first version of the modern definition had appeared in [[Webster's Dictionary]]: "licentious painting employed to decorate the walls of rooms sacred to [[bacchanalia]]n orgies, examples of which exist in Pompeii."&lt;ref&gt;''An American dictionary of the English language'', new and revised edition (1864), s.v. [http://dictionary.oed.com/help/bib/oed2-w.html#webster "Pornography"]. From the [[Oxford English Dictionary]], second edition (1989), Oxford University Press, Retrieved on November 30, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the beginning of what today refers to explicit pictures in general. Though some specific sex acts were regulated or prohibited by earlier laws, merely looking at objects or images depicting them was not outlawed in any country until 1857. In some cases, the possession of certain books, engravings or image collections was outlawed, but the trend to compose laws that actually restricted viewing sexually explicit things in general was a Victorian construct.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;

When large-scale [[excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] of [[Pompeii]] were undertaken in the 1860s, much of the erotic art of the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] came to light, shocking the Victorians who saw themselves as the intellectual heirs of the [[Roman Empire]]. They did not know what to do with the frank depictions of sexuality, and endeavored to hide them away from everyone but upper-class scholars. The movable objects were locked away in the [[Secret Museum, Naples|Secret Museum]] in [[Naples]], and what could not be removed was covered and cordoned off so as to not corrupt the sensibilities of women, children and the working class. England's (and the world's) first laws criminalising pornography were enacted with the passage of the [[Obscene Publications Act]] of 1857.&lt;ref name = history /&gt; Despite their occasional repression, depictions of erotic themes have been common for millennia.&lt;ref name = libido7&gt;{{cite web| last = Beck| first = Marianna| title = The Roots of Western Pornography: Victorian Obsessions and Fin-de-Siècle Predilections| work = Libido, The Journal of Sex and Sensibility| publisher = Libido Inc |date = May 2003| url = http://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/europorn07.html| accessdate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pornography has existed throughout recorded history and has adapted to each new medium, including photography, cinema, video, and computers and the internet.

The first instances of modern pornography date back to the sixteenth century when sexually explicit images differentiated itself from traditional sexual representations in European art by combining the traditionally explicit representation of sex and the moral norms of those times.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The first amendment prohibits the U.S. government from restricting speech based on its content. Indecent speech is protected and may be regulated, but not banned. Obscenity is the judicially recognized exception to the first amendment. Historically, this exception was used in an attempt to ban information about sex education, studies on nudism, and sexually explicit literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reese|first1=Debbie-Anne|last2=Kyle|first2=Deva A.|date= Fall 2002|title=Obscenity and Pornography|journal=Georgetown Journal of Gender and The Law|volume=4|issue=1|pages=137–168|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/grggenl4&amp;div=3&amp;id=&amp;page=|subscription=yes|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s in the United States, attempts were made to shut down the pornography industry by prosecuting individuals on prostitution charges. In the case of ''[[People v. Freeman]]'', the [[Supreme Court of California|California Supreme Court]] ruled to distinguish prostitution as an individual taking part in sexual activities in exchange for money versus an individual who is portraying a sexual act on-screen as part of their acting performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = FindLaw's United States Supreme Court case and opinions.|url = https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-supreme-court/488/1311.html|website = Findlaw|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was not appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, thus it is only binding in the state of California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Porn In The U.S.A.|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/news/porn-in-the-usa-21-11-2003|website = www.cbsnews.com|accessdate = 2015-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Palaeolithic and mesolithic===
Among the oldest surviving examples of erotic depictions are [[Paleolithic]] [[cave painting]]s and carvings. Some of the more common images are of animals, hunting scenes and depictions of human [[genitalia]]. Nude human beings with exaggerated sexual characteristics are depicted in some Paleolithic paintings and artifacts (e.g. [[Venus figurines]]). Recently discovered cave art at [[Creswell Crags]] in England, thought to be more than 12,000 years old, includes some symbols that may be stylized versions of female genitalia. As there is no direct evidence of the use of these objects, it is speculated that they may have been used in religious rituals,&lt;ref name = ng&gt;{{cite web| last = Pickrell| first = John| title = Unprecedented Ice Age Cave Art Discovered in U.K.| work =National Geographic News |publisher = Nationalgeographic.com| date = August 18, 2004| url = http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/08/0818_040818_ice_age_caveart.html| accessdate = 2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; or for a more directly sexual purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vhSHn-B89A0C&amp;pg=PA195 | title = The Lost Civilizations of the Stone Age | isbn = 9780684862705 | author1 = Rudgley | first1 = Richard | date = 2000-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeologists in Germany reported in April 2005 that they had found what they believe is a 7,200-year-old scene depicting a male figurine bending over a female figurine in a manner suggestive of sexual intercourse. The male figure has been named Adonis von Zschernitz.&lt;ref name = Guardian&gt;{{cite web| last = Driver| first = Krysia| title = Archaeologist finds 'oldest porn statue'|work = The Guardian | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited| date = 2005-04-04| url = https://www.theguardian.com/germany/article/0,2763,1451509,00.html| accessdate = 2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesopotamia===
A vast number of artifacts have been discovered from ancient Mesopotamia depicting explicit heterosexual sex.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Black|first1=Jeremy|first2=Anthony|last2=Green|title=Gods, Demons and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=05LXAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=Inana|publisher=The British Museum Press|year=1992|isbn=0-7141-1705-6|pages=150–152|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NemetNejat"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nemet-Nejat|first=Karen Rhea|authorlink=Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat|date=1998|title=Daily Life in Ancient Mesopotamia|location=Santa Barbara, California|publisher=Greenwood|series=Daily Life|isbn=978-0313294976|page=137|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glyptic art from the [[Sumer]]ian [[Early Dynastic Period (Mesopotamia)|Early Dynastic Period]] frequently shows scenes of frontal sex in the [[missionary position]].&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; In Mesopotamian [[Ex-voto|votive plagues]] from the early second millennium BC, the man is usually shown entering the woman from behind while she bends over, drinking [[beer]] through a straw.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; [[Assyria|Middle Assyrian]] lead votive [[figurine]]s often represent the man standing and penetrating the woman as she rests on top of an altar.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Scholars have traditionally interpreted all these depictions as scenes of [[Hieros gamos|ritual sex]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; but they are more likely to be associated with the cult of [[Inanna]], the goddess of sex and prostitution.&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; Many sexually explicit images were found in the temple of Inanna at [[Assur]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; which also contained models of male and female sexual organs,&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; including stone [[phallus|phalli]], which may have been worn around the neck as an amulet or used to decorate [[Cult image|cult statues]],&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt; and clay models of the female [[vulva]].&lt;ref name="BlackGreen1992"/&gt;

===Egypt===


Depictions of sexual intercourse were not part of the general repertory of ancient Egyptian formal art,&lt;ref name="Gay1993"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Robins|first1=Gay|title=Women in Ancient Egypt|date=1993|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=0-674-95469-6|pages=189–190|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTSA88SVHCMC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=Turin+erotic+papyrus&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjMmKPkn8HYAhXLQt8KHePuB48Q6AEIRTAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Turin%20erotic%20papyrus&amp;f=false|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rudimentary sketches of heterosexual intercourse have been found on pottery fragments and in graffiti.&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; The [[Turin Erotic Papyrus]] (Papyrus 55001) is a {{convert|8.5|ft|m}} by {{convert|10|in|cm}} Egyptian papyrus scroll discovered at [[Deir el-Medina]],&lt;ref name=oconnor2001&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Connor|first=David|title=Eros in Egypt|url=http://fontes.lstc.edu/~rklein/Documents/eros_in_egypt.htm|website=Archaeology Odyssey|date=September–October 2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; the last two-thirds of which consist of a series of twelve [[Vignette (literature)|vignette]]s showing men and women in various [[sexual position]]s.&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; The men in the illustrations are "scruffy, balding, short, and paunchy" with exaggeratedly large genitalia&lt;ref name=schmidt2000&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schmidt|first1=Robert A.|last2=Voss|first2=Barbara L.|date=2000|title=Archaeologies of Sexuality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eSBVQpifqhkC&amp;lpg=PA254&amp;pg=PA254#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Turin%20Papyrus%22&amp;f=false|location=Abingdon-on-Thames, England|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-22366-9|page=254|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; and do not conform to Egyptian standards of physical attractiveness,&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; but the women are [[nubile]]&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; and they are shown with objects from traditional erotic [[iconography]], such as [[convolvulus]] leaves and, in some scenes, they are even holding items traditionally associated with [[Hathor]], the goddess of love, such as [[lotus flower]]s, monkeys, and [[sistra]].&lt;ref name=schmidt2000/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt; The scroll was probably painted in the Ramesside period (1292-1075 BC)&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; and its high artistic quality indicates that was produced for a wealthy audience.&lt;ref name=oconnor2001/&gt; No other similar scrolls have yet been discovered.&lt;ref name="Gay1993"/&gt;

===Greek and Roman===
The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] often painted sexual scenes on their [[ceramic art|ceramics]], many of them famous for being some of the earliest depictions of [[homosexuality|same-sex relations]] and [[pederasty]]. Greek art often portrays sexual activity, but it is impossible to distinguish between what to them was illegal or immoral since the ancient Greeks did not have a concept of pornography. Their art simply reflects scenes from daily life, some more sexual than others. Carved [[phallus|phalli]] can be seen in places of worship such as the temple of [[Dionysus]] on [[Delos]], while a common household item and protective charm was the [[herma|herm]], a statue consisting of a head on a square plinth with a prominent phallus on the front. The Greek male ideal had a small penis, an aesthetic the Romans later adopted.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Herm of Dionysos| publisher = The Getty Museum, J.Paul Getty Trust| url = http://www.getty.edu/art/gettyguide/artObjectDetails?artobj=9917| accessdate = 2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Adams | first = Cecil| title = Why does so much ancient Greek art feature males with small genitalia?| work = The Straight Dope| publisher = Chicago Reader| date = 9 December 2005| url = http://www.straightdope.com/columns/051209.html| accessdate = 2006-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks also created the first well-known instance of [[lesbianism in erotica|lesbian eroticism]] in the West, with [[Sappho]]'s ''Hymn to Aphrodite'' and other [[homoeroticism|homoerotic]] works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Williamson | first =Margaret| title =Sappho's Immortal Daughters| publisher =Harvard University Press| year =1995| location = Cambridge, MA| isbn =  0-674-78912-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercury god.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Priapus]] figure from Pompeii. Large phalli were considered undesirable for men to possess and often depicted for comic effect in ancient Rome.&lt;ref name = romans /&gt;&lt;ref name = history/&gt;]]

There are numerous sexually explicit paintings and sculptures from the ruined Roman buildings in [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|Pompeii and Herculaneum]] but the original purposes of the depictions can vary. On one hand, in the [[Villa of the Mysteries]], there is a ritual flagellation scene that is clearly associated with a religious cult and this image can be seen as having religious significance rather than sexual. On the other hand, graphic paintings in a brothel advertise sexual services in murals above each door. In Pompeii, phalli and testicles engraved in the sidewalks were created to aid visitors in finding their way by pointing to the prostitution and entertainment district as well as general decoration. The Romans considered depictions of sex to be decoration in good taste, and indeed the pictures reflect the sexual mores and practices of their culture, as on the [[Warren Cup]]. Sex acts that were considered [[taboo]] (such as those that defiled the purity of the mouth) were depicted in [[thermae|baths]] for comic effect. Large phalli were often used near entryways, for the phallus was a good-luck charm, and the carvings were common in homes. One of the first objects excavated when the complex was discovered was a [[marble]] statue showing the god [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]] having sex with a [[goat]], a detailed depiction of [[bestiality]] considered so obscene that it was not on public display until the year 2000 and remains in the [[Secret Museum, Naples]].&lt;ref name = romans /&gt;&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hemingway | first = Seán| title = Roman Erotic Art| journal = Sculpture Review| volume = 53| issue = 4| pages = 10–15| publisher = National Sculpture Society| date = Winter 2004| url = http://www.sculpturereview.com/| accessdate = 2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peruvian===
The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] of [[Peru]] are another ancient people that sculpted explicit scenes of sex into their [[pottery]]. At least 500 Moche ceramics have sexual themes. The most frequently depicted act is [[anal sex]], with scenes of vaginal penetration being very rare.  Most pairs are heterosexual, with carefully carved genitalia to show that the anus, rather than the vagina, is being penetrated. Often, an infant is depicted [[breastfeeding]] while the couple has sex. [[Fellatio]] is sometimes represented, but [[cunnilingus]] is absent. Some depict male skeletons masturbating, or being masturbated by living women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weismantel, M. | year = 2004 | title = Moche sex pots: Reproduction and temporality in ancient South America | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–496 | url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/moche/moche-sex-pots.pdf | doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.3.495}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rafael Larco Hoyle]] speculates that their purpose was much different than that of other early cultures. He states that the Moche believed that the world of the dead was the exact opposite of the world of the living. Therefore, for [[funeral]] offerings, they made [[wiktionary:vessel|vessels]] showing sex acts such as [[masturbation]], [[fellatio]] and [[anal sex]] that would not result in offspring. The hope was that in the world of the dead, they would take on their opposite meaning and result in fertility. The erotic pottery of the Moche is depicted in Hoyle's book ''Checan''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjaesthetics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/6/4/399 book-review (In ''British Journal of Aesthetics'', Vol. 6, 1966) of ''Checan'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Indiaerotic1.jpg|right|thumb|Prince and his lady on a terrace at night (India)]]

There has been a long tradition of erotic painting in the East. [[History of India|India]], [[Japan]], [[China]], [[Persian Empire|Persia]] and other lands produced copious quantities of art celebrating the human faculty of love. The works depict love between men and women as well as same-sex love. One of the most famous ancient [[sex manual]]s was the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', written by [[Vātsyāyana]] in India during the first few centuries [[Common Era|CE]]. Another notable treatise on human sexuality is [[The Perfumed Garden]] by the Tunisian Muhammad ibn Muhammad al-Nafzawi, dating to the fifteenth century.

In Japan, the erotic art found its greatest flowering in the medium of the [[woodblock printing|woodblock prints]]. The style is known as {{nihongo|''[[Shunga (art)|shunga]]''|春画|spring pictures}} and some of its classic practitioners (e.g. [[Suzuki Harunobu|Harunobu]], [[Utamaro]]) produced a large number of works. Painted hand scrolls were also very popular. Shunga appeared in the 13th century and continued to grow in popularity despite occasional attempts to suppress them, the first of which was a ban on erotic books known as {{nihongo|''kōshokubon''| 好色本}} issued by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in [[Kyōhō]] 7 (1722).  Shunga only ceased to be produced in the 19th century when photography was invented.&lt;ref name = east/&gt;&lt;ref name = shunga&gt;{{cite web| last = Parent| first = Mary N, PhD| title = Shunga| publisher = Japanese Architecture and Art net users system| year = 2001| url = http://www.aisf.or.jp/%7Ejaanus/deta/s/shunga.htm| accessdate = 2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese tradition of the erotic was also extensive, with examples of the art dating back as far as the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (1271–1368). The erotic art of China reached its peak during the latter part of the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644).&lt;ref name = east/&gt;&lt;ref name = dreams&gt;{{cite book| last = Bertholet| first = L.C.P.| title = Dreams of Spring: Erotic Art in China: From the Bertholet Collection| publisher = Pepin Press| date = October 1997| isbn = 90-5496-039-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both China and Japan, eroticism played a prominent role in the development of the novel. ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', the work by an [[Heian period|11th-century Japanese]] noblewoman that is often called "the world's first novel," traces the many affairs of its hero in discreet but carnal language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Puette | first =William J.| title =The Tale of Genji: A Reader's Guide | publisher =Tuttle Publishing| year =2004| isbn =  0-8048-3331-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; From [[Ming Dynasty|16th-century China]], the still more explicit novel ''[[The Plum in the Golden Vase]]'' has been called one of the [[Four Great Classical Novels|four great classical novels]] of Chinese literature.

===European===
Erotic scenes in [[medieval]] [[illuminated manuscript]]s also appeared, but were seen only by those who could afford the extremely expensive hand-made books. Most of these drawings occur in the [[wiktionary:margin|margins]] of [[book of hours|books of hours]]. Many medieval scholars think that the pictures satisfied the medieval cravings for both erotic pictures and religion in one book, especially since it was often the only book someone owned. Other scholars think the drawings in the margins were a kind of moral caution, but the depiction of priests and other ranking officials engaged in sex acts suggests political origins as well.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

It was not until the invention of the [[printing press]] by [[Johannes Gutenberg]] that sexually explicit images entered into any type of mass circulation in the western world. Before that time, erotic images, being hand made and expensive, were limited to upper class males. Even the [[British Museum]] had a [[Secretum (room)|Secretum]] filled with a collection of ancient [[erotica]] donated by the upper class doctor, [[George Witt (collector)|George Witt]] in 1865. The remains of the collection, including his scrapbooks, still reside in Cupboard 55, though the majority of it has recently been integrated with the museum's other collections.&lt;ref name = rude&gt;{{cite journal| last = Giamster| first = David| title = Sex and Sensibility at the British Museum| journal = History Today| volume = 50| issue = 9| pages = 10–15| publisher = History Today| date = September 2000| url = http://www.historytoday.com/MainArticle.aspx?m=10989&amp;amid=10989| accessdate = 2006-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Old master print|Prints]] became very popular in Europe from the middle of the fifteenth century, and because of their compact nature, were very suitable for erotic depictions that did not need to be permanently on display.  Nudity and the revival of classical subjects were associated from very early on in history of the print, and many prints of subjects from mythological subjects were clearly in part an excuse for erotic material; the [[engraving]]s of [[Giovanni Battista Palumba]] in particular.  An earthier eroticism is seen in a printing plate of 1475-1500 for an ''Allegory of Copulation'' where a young couple are having sex, with the woman's legs high in the air, at one end of a bench, while at the other end a huge penis, with legs and wings and a bell tied around the bottom of the glans, is climbing onto the bench.  Although the plate has been used until worn out, then re-engraved and heavily used again, none of the contemporary impressions printed, which probably ran into the hundreds, have survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Levinson| first = Jay A.

The loves of classical gods, especially those of [[Jupiter]] detailed in [[Ovid]] provided many subjects where actual sex was the key moment in the story, and its depiction was felt to be justified.  In particular [[Leda and the Swan]], where the god appeared as a [[swan]] and seduced the woman, was depicted very explicitly; it seems that this—rather strangely—was considered more acceptable because he appeared as a bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Bull |first = Malcolm | title = The Mirror of the Gods, How Renaissance Artists Rediscovered the Pagan Gods| publisher = Oxford University Press| date = February 21, 2005| location = USA |isbn = 978-0-19-521923-4 |page = 167}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;!-- (Commented out until referenced) Nonetheless, the most famous painted depictions of the subject, by [[Michelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] were apparently later destroyed by the French royal family, and a further version by [[Correggio]] was attacked by a cousin of the King in a fit of depression.--&gt; For a period ending in the early 16th century the boundaries of what could be depicted in for display in the semi-privacy of a Renaissance palace seemed uncertain.

The hard to imagine statement is OR) It is hard to imagine equivalently prominent works outside the specialized genre of erotica from about 1530 until the 19th century.  After the early fifteenth century both large paintings for palaces, and small prints for collectors, cease to show either actual sex or explicit female pudenda.  The pattern for female nudes was set by the [[Dresden Venus]] of [[Giorgione]] (ca. 1510), where a reclining female nude is shown frontally, but not explicitly, and by herself.  [[Titian]] and others largely continued this pattern, and the [[Rokeby Venus]] by [[Velázquez]] (1640s) provides a rear-view version.  The [[Little Masters]] in Germany produced many very small prints - often just two inches tall - of erotic subjects, for middle-class collectors, but were not as explicit as the artists of thirty years before.--&gt;

In the 16th century an attempt to print erotic material caused a scandal when the well-known Italian artist [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] published ''[[I Modi]]'' in 1524, an illustrated book of 16 "postures" or sexual positions. Raimondi was subsequently imprisoned by the [[Pope Clement VII]] and all copies of the illustrations were destroyed. Raimondi based the [[engraving]]s on a series of erotic paintings that [[Giulio Romano]] was doing as a commission for the [[Palazzo del Te]] in [[Mantua]]. Though the two depictions were very similar, only Raimondi was prosecuted because his engravings were capable of being seen by the public. Romano did not know of the engravings until [[Pietro Aretino]] came to see the original paintings while Romano was still working on them. Aretino then composed sixteen explicit [[sonnet]]s ("both in your cunt and your behind, my prick will make me happy, and you happy and blissful")&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name = Imodi&gt;{{cite book| last = Lawner| first = Lynne, ed.| title = I Modi; the sixteen pleasures: an erotic album of the Italian Renaissance| publisher = Northwestern University Press|location=Evanston| year = 1989| isbn = 0-8101-0803-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; to go with the paintings and secured Raimondi's release from prison.  ''I Modi'' was then published a second time in 1527, with the poems and the pictures, making this the first time erotic text and images were combined, though the papacy once more seized all the copies it could find. Raimondi escaped prison that time, but the censorship was so strict that no complete editions of the original printings have ever been found. The text in existence is only a copy of a copy that was discovered 400 years later.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name="Imodi"/&gt;

In the 17th century, numerous examples of pornographic or erotic literature began to circulate. These included ''L'Ecole des Filles'', a French work printed in 1655 that is considered to be the beginning of pornography in [[France]]. It consists of an illustrated dialogue between two women, a 16-year-old and her more worldly cousin, and their explicit discussions about sex.

[[File:Juliette Sade Dutch.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration from ''[[Juliette (novel)|Juliette]]'' by the [[Marquis de Sade]]]]
During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], many of the French free-thinkers began to exploit pornography as a medium of social criticism and [[satire]]. [[Libertine]] pornography was a subversive social commentary and often targeted the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic Church]] and general attitudes of [[sexual repression]]. The market for the mass-produced, inexpensive pamphlets soon became the bourgeoisie, making the upper class worry, as in England, that the morals of the lower class and weak-minded would be corrupted since women, slaves and the uneducated were seen as especially vulnerable during that time. The stories and illustrations (sold in the galleries of the [[Palais Royal]], along with the services of prostitutes) were often [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] and full of misbehaving priests, monks and nuns, a tradition that in French pornography continued into the 20th century. In the period leading up to the [[French Revolution]], pornography was also used as political commentary; [[Marie Antoinette]] was often targeted with fantasies involving orgies, lesbian activities and the paternity of her children, and rumours circulated about the supposed sexual inadequacies of [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]].&lt;ref name = libido2 /&gt;&lt;ref name = libido4&gt;{{cite web| last = Beck| first = Marianna| title = The Roots of Western Pornography: the French Revolution and the spread of {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}motivated pornography| work = Libido, the Journal of Sex and Sensibility| publisher = Libido Inc |date=February 2003 |url=http://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/europorn04.html| accessdate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During and after the Revolution, the famous works of the [[Marquis de Sade]] were printed.

The English answer to this was ''Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure'' (later abridged and renamed ''[[Fanny Hill]]'') written in 1748 by [[John Cleland]]. While the text satirised the literary conventions and fashionable manners of 18th century England, it was more scandalous for depicting a woman, the narrator, enjoying and even reveling in sexual acts with no dire moral or physical consequences. The text is hardly explicit as Cleland wrote the entire book using euphemisms for sex acts and body parts, employing 50 different ones just for the term [[penis]]. Two small earthquakes were credited to the book by the [[Bishop of London]] and Cleland was arrested and briefly imprisoned, but ''Fanny Hill'' continued to be published and is one of the most reprinted books in the English language. However, it was not legal to own this book in the United States until 1963 and in the United Kingdom until 1970.&lt;ref name = libido3&gt;{{cite web| last = Beck| first = Marianna| title = The Roots of Western Pornography: England bites back with Fanny Hill| work = Libido, the Journal of Sex and Sensibility| publisher = Libido Inc| date = January 2003| url = http://www.libidomag.com/nakedbrunch/archive/europorn03.html| accessdate = 2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photography===
{{details|Erotic photography}}
[[File:Vintage nude bust photograph of a young denuded lady.jpg|right|thumb|19th-century nude photograph]]

In 1839, [[Louis Daguerre]] presented the first practical process of [[photography]] to the [[French Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref name = timeline&gt;{{cite web| last = Cross| first = J.M., PhD| title = Nineteenth-Century Photography: A Timeline| work = the Victorian Web| publisher = The University Scholars Programme, National University of Singapore| date = 2001-02-04| url = http://victorianweb.org/photos/chron.html | accessdate = 2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike earlier photographic methods, his [[daguerreotype]]s had stunning quality and detail and did not fade with time. Artists adopted the new technology as a new way to depict the nude form, which in practice was the feminine form. In so doing, at least initially, they tried to follow the styles and traditions of the art form. Traditionally, an académie was a [[depictions of nudity|nude]] study done by a painter to master the female (or male) form. Each had to be registered with the French government and approved or they could not be sold. Soon, nude photographs were being registered as académie and marketed as aids to painters. However, the realism of a photograph as opposed to the idealism of a painting made many of these intrinsically erotic.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

The daguerreotypes were not without drawbacks, however. The main difficulty was that they could only be reproduced by photographing the original picture since each image was an original and the all-metal process does not use [[negative (photography)|negatives]]. In addition, the earliest daguerreotypes had exposure times ranging from three to fifteen minutes, making them somewhat impractical for [[portrait photography|portraiture]]. Unlike earlier drawings, action could not be shown. The poses that the models struck had to be held very still for a long time. Because of this, the standard pornographic image shifted from one of two or more people engaged in sex acts to a solitary woman exposing her [[genitals]]. Since one picture could cost a week's salary, the audience for these nudes mostly consisted of artists and the upper echelon of society. It was cheaper to hire a prostitute and experience the sex acts than it was to own a picture of them in the 1840s.&lt;ref name = history /&gt; [[Stereoscope|Stereoscopy]] was invented in 1838 and became extremely popular for daguerreotypes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Wheatstone| first = Charles| title = Contributions to the Physiology of Vision.—Part the First.

This technology produced a type of [[three-dimensional space|three dimensional]] view that suited erotic images quite well. Although thousands of erotic daguerreotypes were created, only around 800 are known to survive; however, their uniqueness and expense meant that they were once the toys of rich men. Due to their rarity, the works can sell for more than 10,000 GBP.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

In 1841, [[William Fox Talbot]] patented the [[calotype]] process, the first negative-positive process, making possible multiple copies.&lt;ref name = glasgow&gt;{{cite web| last = Schaaf| first = Larry| title = The Calotype Process| publisher = Glasgow University Library| year = 1999| url = http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/hillandadamson/calo.html| accessdate = 2006-08-23 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060619221733/http://special.lib.gla.ac.uk/hillandadamson/calo.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This invention permitted an almost limitless number of prints to be produced from a glass negative. Also, the reduction in exposure time made a true mass market for pornographic pictures possible. The technology was immediately employed to reproduce nude portraits. Paris soon became the centre of this trade. In 1848 only thirteen photography studios existed in Paris; by 1860, there were over 400. Most of them profited by selling illicit pornography to the masses who could now afford it. The pictures were also sold near [[train station]]s, by traveling salesmen and women in the streets who hid them under their dresses. They were often produced in sets (of four, eight or twelve), and exported internationally, mainly to England and the United States. Both the models and the photographers were commonly from the working class, and the artistic model excuse was increasingly hard to use. By 1855, no more photographic nudes were being registered as académie, and the business had gone underground to escape prosecution.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

[[File:Female nude motion study by Eadweard Muybridge.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Eadweard Muybridge]]: Woman walking with fishing pole (detail)]]

The Victorian pornographic tradition in Britain had three main elements: French photographs, erotic prints (sold in shops in Holywell Street, a long vanished London thoroughfare, swept away by the [[Aldwych]]), and printed literature. The ability to reproduce photographs in bulk assisted the rise of a new business individual, the porn dealer. Many of these dealers took advantage of the [[postal system]] to send out photographic cards in plain wrappings to their subscribers. Therefore, the development of a reliable international postal system facilitated the beginnings of the pornography trade. Victorian pornography had several defining characteristics. It reflected a very mechanistic view of the [[human anatomy]] and its functions. Science, the new obsession, was used to ostensibly study the human body. Consequently, the sexuality of the subject is often depersonalised, and is without any passion or tenderness. At this time, it also became popular to depict nude photographs of women of exotic ethnicities, under the umbrella of science. Studies of this type can be found in the work of [[Eadweard Muybridge]]. Although he photographed both men and women, the women were often given [[theatrical property|props]] like market baskets and fishing poles, making the images of women thinly disguised erotica.&lt;ref name = history /&gt; Parallel to the British printing history, photographers and printers in France frequently turned to the medium of [[postcard]]s, producing great numbers of them. Such cards came to be known in the US as "[[French postcard]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Color of Words: An Encyclopaedic Dictionary of Ethnic Bias in the United States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_hZHAAAAMAAJ|first=Philip|last=Herbst|publisher=Intercultural Press|year=1997|isbn=9781877864971|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazines==
{{details|Pornographic magazine}}

During the Victorian period, illegal pornographic periodicals such as ''[[The Pearl (magazine)|The Pearl]]'', which ran for eighteen issues between 1879 and 1880, circulated clandestinely among circles of elite urban gentlemen.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Joudrey, [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/652322 "Against Communal Nostalgia: Reconstructing Sociality in the Pornographic Ballad,"] ''Victorian Poetry'' 54.4 (2017).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, [[halftone]] printing was used to reproduce photographs inexpensively for the first time.&lt;ref name = timeline /&gt; The invention of halftone printing took pornography and erotica in new directions at the beginning of the 20th century. The new printing processes allowed photographic images to be reproduced easily in black and white, whereas printers were previously limited to engravings, [[woodcut]]s and line cuts for illustrations.&lt;ref name = halftone&gt;{{cite web| last = St. John| first = Kristen|author2=Linda Zimmerman| title = Guided Tour of Print Processes: Black and White Reproduction| publisher = Stanford library| date = June 1997| url = http://library.stanford.edu/depts/dp/pennies/print.html| accessdate = 2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first format that allowed pornography to become a mass market phenomena, it now being more affordable and more easily acquired than any previous form.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

First appearing in France, the new magazines featured nude (often, [[burlesque]] actresses were hired as models) and semi-nude photographs on the cover and throughout; while these would now be termed [[softcore pornography|softcore]], they were quite shocking for the time. The publications soon either masqueraded as "art magazines" or publications celebrating the new cult of [[naturism]], with titles such as ''[[Photo Bits]]'', ''Body in Art'', ''Figure Photography'', ''Nude Living'' and ''Modern Art for Men.''&lt;ref name = history /&gt; ''Health and Efficiency'', started in 1900, was a typical naturist magazine in Britain.&lt;ref name = H&amp;E&gt;{{cite web| title = About H&amp;E Naturist |publisher = ''Health and Efficiency Naturist'' |url = http://www.healthandefficiency.co.uk/aboutframe.htm | accessdate = 2006-10-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061014062706/http://www.healthandefficiency.co.uk/aboutframe.htm |archivedate = 2006-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another early form of pornography were [[comic book]]s known as [[Tijuana bible]]s that began appearing in the U.S. in the 1920s and lasted until the publishing of glossy colour men's magazines commenced. These were crude hand drawn scenes often using popular characters from [[cartoon]]s and culture.&lt;ref name = tijuana&gt;{{cite book| last = Adelman| first = Bob|author2=Richard Merkin| title = Tijuana Bibles: Art and Wit in America's Forbidden Funnies, 1930s-1950s| publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster| date = September 1, 1997| location = New York| isbn = 0-684-83461-8| page = 160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, the word "[[pinup]]" was coined to describe pictures torn from men's magazines and calendars and "pinned up" on the wall by U.S. soldiers in [[World War II]]. While the '40s images focused mostly on legs, by the '50s, the emphasis shifted to [[breast]]s. [[Betty Grable]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] were two of the most popular pinup [[model (person)|models]]. In the second half of the 20th century, pornography evolved into the men's magazines such as ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''Modern Man'' of the 1950s. In fact, the beginning of the modern men's glossy magazine (or girlie magazine) can be traced to the 1953 purchase by [[Hugh Hefner]] of a photograph of Marilyn Monroe to use as the centerfold of his new magazine ''Playboy''. Soon, this type of magazine was the primary medium in which pornography was consumed.&lt;ref name = girlie&gt;{{cite book| last = Gabor| first = Mark| title = The Illustrated History of Girlie Magazines| publisher = Random House Value Publishing| date = February 27, 1984| location = New York| isbn = 0-517-54997-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In postwar Britain digest magazines such as ''Beautiful Britons'', ''Spick'' and ''Span'', with their interest in nylons and underwear
and the racier ''Kamera'' published by [[Harrison Marks]] were incredibly popular. The creative force behind ''Kamera'' was Harrison Marks' partner [[Pamela Green]]. These magazines featured nude or semi-nude women in extremely coy or flirtatious poses with no hint of pubic hair.

''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'', started by [[Bob Guccione]] in England in 1965, took a different approach. Women looked indirectly at the camera, as if they were going about their private idylls. This change of emphasis was influential in erotic depictions of women. ''Penthouse'' was also the first magazine to publish pictures that included pubic hair and [[wiktionary:full frontal nudity|full frontal nudity]], both of which were considered beyond the bounds of the erotic and in the realm of pornography at the time. In the late 1960s, magazines began to move into more explicit displays often focusing on the [[buttocks]] as standards of what could be legally depicted and what readers wanted to see changed. By the 1970s, they were focusing on the pubic area and eventually, by the 1990s, featured [[sexual penetration]], [[lesbian]]ism and homosexuality, [[group sex]], masturbation, and [[sexual fetishism|fetishes]] in the more hard-core magazines such as ''[[Hustler]]''.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name = girlie /&gt;

Magazines for every taste and fetish were soon created due to the low cost of producing them. Magazines for the gay community flourished, the most notable and one of the first being ''Physique Pictorial'', started in 1951 by Bob Mizer when his attempt to sell the services of male models; however, [[Athletic Model Guild]] photographs of them failed. It was published in black and white, in a very clear yet photographic manner celebrating the male form and was published for nearly 50 years.&lt;!--awkward statement--&gt; The magazine was innovative in its use of props and [[costume]]s to depict the now standard gay icons like [[cowboy]]s, [[gladiator]]s and [[sailor]]s.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name = out&gt;{{cite web| last = Bianco| first = David| title = Physique Magazines| work = Planet Out History |publisher = PlanetOut Inc| url = http://www.planetout.com/news/history/archive/09271999.html| accessdate = 2006-10-10 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060830161616/http://www.planetout.com/news/history/archive/09271999.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Schwarzer movies about 1906.jpg|right|thumb|Images from early Austrian erotic films by Johann Schwarzer.]]
Production of erotic films commenced almost immediately after the invention of the motion picture. Two of the earliest pioneers were Frenchmen [[Eugène Pirou]] and [[Albert Kirchner]]. Kirchner (under the name "Léar") directed the earliest surviving erotic film for Pirou. The 7-minute 1896 film ''[[Le Coucher de la Mariee]]'' had Louise Willy performing a bathroom [[striptease]].&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;Richard Abel, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9cc71Uekc_EC&amp;pg=PA518&amp;dq=%22Louise+Willy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LDEqT9y5HsbWrQeoqLDADA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Louise%20Willy%22&amp;f=false ''Encyclopedia of early cinema''], Taylor &amp; Francis, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-415-23440-5}}, p.518&lt;/ref&gt; Other French filmmakers also considered that profits could be made from this type of risqué films, showing women disrobing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bottomore |first=Stephen |editor=Stephen Herbert |editor2=Luke McKernan |year=1996 |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/lear.htm |title=Léar (Albert Kirchner) |work=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bottomore |first=Stephen |editor=Stephen Herbert |editor2=Luke McKernan |year=1996 |url=http://www.victorian-cinema.net/pirou.htm |title=Eugène Pirou |work=Who's Who of Victorian Cinema |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=15 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1896 ''Fatima's Coochie-Coochie Dance''&lt;ref&gt;Produced by James A. White and shot by William Heise for the Edison Manufacturing Co. in 1896.&lt;/ref&gt; was released as a short [[kinetoscope]] film featuring a gyrating [[belly dancer]] named Fatima. Her gyrating and moving pelvis was censored, one of the earliest films to be censored. At the time, there were numerous risqué films that featured exotic dancers.&lt;ref name=sexinfilms1&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/sexinfilms1.html Sex in Cinema: Pre-1920s]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, ''The May Irwin Kiss'' contained the very first kiss on film. It was a 20-second film loop, with a close-up of a nuzzling couple followed by a short peck on the lips ("the mysteries of the kiss revealed"). The kissing scene was denounced as shocking and pornographic to early moviegoers and caused the Roman Catholic Church to call for censorship and moral reform - because kissing in public at the time could lead to prosecution.&lt;ref name=sexinfilms1 /&gt; A [[tableau vivant]] style is used in short film ''The Birth of the Pearl'' (1901)&lt;ref&gt;Produced by [[Frederick S. Armitage]] for the [[American Mutoscope and Biograph Company]].&lt;/ref&gt; featuring an unnamed long-haired young model wearing a flesh-colored [[body stocking]] in a direct frontal pose&lt;ref name=sexinfilms1 /&gt; that provides a provocative view of the female body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/awhhtml/awmi10/d21.html|title=The Birth of the Pearl|website=Library of Congress|year=1901|accessdate=12 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pose is in the style of [[Botticelli]]'s [[The Birth of Venus (Botticelli)|The Birth of Venus]].

Because Pirou is nearly unknown as a pornographic filmmaker, credit is often given to other films for being the first. In ''Black and White and Blue'' (2008), one of the most scholarly attempts to document the origins of the clandestine 'stag film' trade, Dave Thompson recounts ample evidence that such an industry first had sprung up in the brothels of Buenos Aires and other South American cities by around the start of the 20th century, and then quickly spread through Central Europe over the following few years; however, none of these earliest pornographic films is known to survive. According to Patrick Robertson's ''Film Facts'', "the earliest pornographic motion picture which can definitely be dated is ''A L'Ecu d'Or ou la bonne auberge''" made in France in 1908; the plot depicts a weary soldier who has a [[wiktionary:tryst|tryst]] with a servant girl at an inn. The Argentinian ''El Satario'' might be even older; it has been dated to somewhere between 1907 and 1912. He also notes that "the oldest surviving pornographic films are contained in America's [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] Collection. One film demonstrates how early pornographic conventions were established. The German film ''[[Am Abend]]'' (1910) is "a ten-minute film which begins with a woman masturbating alone in her bedroom, and progresses to scenes of her with a man performing straight sex, fellatio and [[anal penetration]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Robertson| first = Patrick| title = Film Facts| publisher = Billboard Books| date = December 2001| isbn = 0-8230-7943-0| page = 256 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Austria]], [[Johann Schwarzer]] formed his Saturn-Film production company which was able to produce 52 erotic productions between 1906 and 1911, when the company was dissolved by the censorship authorities and the films destroyed.

Soon illegal stag films or blue films, as they were called, were produced underground by amateurs for many years starting in the 1940s. Processing the film took considerable time and resources, with people using their [[bathtub]]s to wash the film when processing facilities (often tied to organized crime) were unavailable. The films were then circulated privately or by traveling salesman but being caught viewing or possessing them put one at the risk of prison.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite web| last = Corliss| first = Richard| title = That Old Feeling: When Porno Was Chic| work = Time Magazine| publisher = Time inc| date = March 29, 2005| url = http://www.time.com/time/columnist/corliss/article/0,9565,1043267,00.html| accessdate = 2006-10-16| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120524121526/http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1043267,00.html| archivedate = May 24, 2012| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post-war era saw developments that further stimulated the growth of a mass market. Technological developments, particularly the introduction of the [[8 mm film|8mm]] and [[super 8 mm film|super-8]] film gauges, resulted in the widespread use of amateur [[cinematography]]. Entrepreneurs emerged to supply this market. In Britain, the productions of [[Harrison Marks]] were "soft core", but considered risqué in the 1950s. On the continent, such films were more explicit. [[Lasse Braun]] was as a pioneer in quality colour productions that were, in the early days, distributed by making use of his father's diplomatic privileges. Pornography was first legalized in Denmark July 1969,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iub.edu/~kinsey/ccies/dk.php Denmark in the International Encyclopedia of Sexuality] - "...Denmark was the first country in the world to legitimize written pornography in 1967 (followed by pictorial pornography in 1969)."&lt;/ref&gt; soon followed by the Netherlands the same year and Sweden in 1971, and this led to an explosion of commercially produced pornography in those countries, with the [[Color Climax Corporation]] quickly becoming the leading pornographic producer for the next couple of decades. Now that being a pornographer was a legitimate occupation, there was no shortage of businessmen to invest in proper plant and equipment capable of turning out a mass-produced, cheap, but quality product. Vast amounts of this new pornography, both magazines and films, were smuggled into other parts of Europe, where it was sold "under the counter" or (sometimes) shown in "members only" cinema clubs.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;

The first explicitly pornographic film with a plot that received a general theatrical release in the U.S. is generally considered to be ''[[Mona the Virgin Nymph]]'' (also known as ''Mona''), a 59-minute 1970 feature by Bill Osco and Howard Ziehm, who went on to create the relatively high-budget hardcore/softcore (depending on the release) cult film ''[[Flesh Gordon]]''.&lt;ref name = time /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Mehendale| first = Rachel| title = Is porn a problem?| work = Sex | pages = 17, 22| publisher = The Daily Texan| date = February 9, 2006| url = http://www.tsp.utexas.edu/FrontPage/TSMweb/advertising%20supplements/Valentines%20Day/valentines.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate = 2006-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1971 film ''[[Boys in the Sand]]'' represented a number of pornographic firsts. As the first generally available gay pornographic film, the film was the first to include on-screen credits for its cast and crew (albeit largely under pseudonyms), to parody the title of a mainstream film (in this case, ''[[The Boys in the Band]]''), and to be reviewed by ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Edmonson| first = Roger|author2=Cal Culver |author3=Casey Donovan | title = Boy in the Sand: Casey Donovan, All-American Sex Star| publisher = Alyson Books| date = October 1998| isbn = 1-55583-457-4| page = 264}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, pornographic films hit their public peak in the United States with both ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and ''[[Behind the Green Door]]'' being met with public approval and becoming social phenomena.

''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' followed in 1973 and many predicted that frank depictions of sex onscreen would soon become commonplace, with [[William Rotsler]] saying in 1973, "Erotic films are here to stay. Eventually they will simply merge into the mainstream of motion pictures and disappear as a labeled sub-division. Nothing can stop this".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Schaefer| first = Eric| title = Dirty Little Secrets: Scholars, Archivists, and Dirty Movies | journal = The Moving Image| volume = 5| issue = 2| pages = 79–105 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press| date = Fall 2005| doi = 10.1353/mov.2005.0034}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, a combination of factors put an end to big budget productions and the mainstreaming of pornography, and in many places it never got close - with ''Deep Throat'' not approved in its uncut form in Britain until 2000, and not shown publicly until June 2005,&lt;ref name = time /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hattenstone| first = Simon| title = After 33 years, Deep Throat, the film that shocked the US, gets its first British showing| work = The Guardian | publisher = Guardian News and Media Limited | date = June 11, 2005| url = http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1504240,00.html| accessdate = 2006-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Porn film on 'landmark 100' list| work = BBC News| publisher = BBC | date = October 5, 2006| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5410268.stm| accessdate = 2006-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video and digital depictions==
{{details|Internet pornography}}

[[File:Cinta ligas 009.jpg|100px|thumb|left|Digitally altered erotic photograph]]

By 1982, most pornographic films were being shot on the cheaper and more convenient medium of [[videotape]]. Many film directors resisted this shift at first because of the different image quality that video tape produced; however, those who did change soon were collecting most of the industry's profits since consumers overwhelmingly preferred the new format. The technology change happened quickly and completely when directors realised that continuing to shoot on film was no longer a profitable option. This change moved the films out of the theaters and into people's private homes. This was the end of the age of big budget productions and the mainstreaming of pornography. It soon went back to its earthy roots and expanded to cover every fetish possible since filming was now so inexpensive. Instead of hundreds of pornographic films being made each year, thousands now were, including compilations of just the sex scenes from various videos.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;&lt;ref name = time /&gt;

Erotic [[CD-ROM]]s were popular in the late 1980s and early 1990s because they brought an unprecedented element of interactiveness and fantasy. However, their poor quality was a drawback and when the [[Internet]] became common in households their sales declined. About the same time as the video revolution, the Internet became the preferred source of pornography for many people, offering both privacy in viewing and the chance to interact with people. The recent influx of widely available technology such as [[digital camera]]s, both moving and still, has blurred the lines between erotic films, photographs and amateur and professional productions.
It allows easy access to both formats, making the production of them easily achieved by anyone with access to the equipment. Much of the pornography available today is produced by amateurs. Digital media is revolutionary in that it allows photographers and filmmakers to manipulate [[image]]s in ways previously not possible, heightening the [[drama]] or eroticism of a depiction.&lt;ref name = history /&gt;

[[High-definition video]] shows signs of changing the image of pornography as the technology is increasingly used for professional productions.  The porn industry was one of the first to adopt the technology and it may have been a deciding factor in the format competition between [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray Disc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Nystedt| first = Dan|author2=Martyn Williams| title = Japanese Porn Industry Embraces Blu-Ray Disc| work = PC World |publisher = PC World Communications, Inc.| date = July 30, 2007| url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,135222-c,dvdtechnology/article.htm| accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the clearer sharper images it provides have prompted performers to get cosmetic surgery and professional grooming to hide imperfections that are not visible on other video formats. Other adaptations have been different camera angles and techniques for close-ups and lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Richtel| first = Matt| title = In Raw World of Sex Movies, High Definition Could Be a View Too Real| work = The New York Times| publisher = The New York Times| date = January 22, 2007| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/22/business/media/22porn.html| accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate poem, [[Vande Mataram]], was created "national song" of India during both the colonial period and after independence in 1956.

==History==
The poem was first sung on the second day of the annual session of the Indian National Congress in Calcutta (now Kolkata) on 27 December 1911, and again in January 1912 at the annual event of the [[Adi Brahmo Samaj]].&lt;ref name = "Sabyasachi Bhattacharya"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://satyashodh.com/janaganaman/&lt;/ref&gt; Though the Bengali song had been written in 1911,&lt;ref name = "Sabyasachi Bhattacharya"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhattacharya|first1=Sabyasachi|title=Rabindranath Tagore : an interpretation|date=2011|publisher=Viking, Penguin Books India|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-0670084555|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xYpkWGHGkwYC|quote=Incidentally a myth regarding this song needs to be refuted and laid to rest. It is on record that the song was written on 11 December 1911. On December 12, 1911 the Delhi Durbar met to honour King Emperor George V. Obviously a poem written on 11 December could not be intended for an event the following day. The song was actually sung at the twenty-seventh session of the Indian National Congress, Calcutta on 28 December 1911 as the opening song at the beginning of the day's proceedings. Thereafter it was also sung at the foundation day anniversary of Adi Brahma Samaj in February 1912 and included in their collection of psalms, Brahma Sangit.|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was largely unknown except to the readers of the Adi Brahmo Samaj journal, ''[[Tattwabodhini Patrika]]'', of which Tagore was the editor.

Song was performed by Sarala Devi Chowdhurani, Tagore’s niece, along with a group of school students, in front of prominent Congress Members like Bishan Narayan Dhar, Indian National Congress President and Ambika Charan Majumdar. 

In 1912, the song was published under the title ''Bharat Bhagya Bidhata'' in the Tatwabodhini Patrika, which was the official publication of the Brahmo Samaj and of which Tagore was the Editor.  

Outside of Calcutta, the song was first sung by the bard himself at a session in [[Besant Theosophical College]] in Madanapalle, Andhra Pradesh on 28 February 1919 when Tagore visited the college and sung the song. The song enthralled the college students while [[Margaret Cousins]], then vice-principal of the college (also an expert in European music and wife of Irish poet James Cousins), both requested Tagore to create an English translation of the song and set down the musical notation to the national anthem, which is followed only when the song is sung in the original slow rendition style. Tagore translated the work into English while at the college on 28 February 1919, titled {{cite wikisource|title=The Morning Song of India}}. The college adopted Tagore's translation of the song as their prayer song which is sung till today.

Before it was the national anthem of India, "Jana Gana Mana" was heard in the film ''[[Hamrahi (1945 film)|Hamrahi]]'' (1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Chandra, Balakrishnan|first1=Pali, Vijay kumar|title=100 Years Of Bollywood-Humrahi (1945)|url=http://www.indiavideo.org/cinema/humrahi-hindi-film-7583.php|website=indiavideo.org|publisher=Invis Multimedia Pvt. Ltd.|accessdate=14 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the occasion of India attaining freedom, the Indian Constituent Assembly assembled for the first time as a sovereign body on 14 August 1947, midnight and the session closed with a unanimous performance of Jana Gana Mana.  

The members of the Indian Delegation to the General Assembly of the United Nations held at New York in 1947 gave a recording of Jana Gana Mana as the country’s national anthem. The song was played by the house orchestra in front of a gathering consisting of representatives from all over the world.

==Code of conduct==
The National Anthem of India is played or sung on various occasions. Instructions have been issued from time to time about the correct versions of the Anthem, the occasions on which these are to be played or sung, and about the need for paying respect to the anthem by observance of proper decorum on such occasions. The substance of these instructions has been embodied in the information sheet issued by the government of India for general information and guidance. The approximate duration of the Full Version of National Anthem of India is 52 seconds and 20 seconds for shorter version.&lt;ref name="anthem"/&gt;

==Lyrics==
The poem was composed in a literary [[register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of the Bengali language called [[sadhu bhasa]]. The song has been written almost entirely using nouns that also can function as verbs and has commonality with all major languages in India due to [[Sanskrit]] being their common source of formal vocabulary. Therefore, the original song is quite clearly understandable, and in fact, remains almost unchanged in several widely different Indian languages (if variations in [[inherent vowel]] and pronunciation of approximants and some sibilants are ignored).

== Controversies ==
In [[Kerala]], students belonging to the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] religious denomination were expelled by school authorities for their refusal to sing the national anthem on religious grounds, although they stood up respectfully when the anthem was sung.&lt;ref&gt;https://indiankanoon.org/docfragment/1508089/?formInput=national%20anthem%20case&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kerala High Court]] concluded that there was nothing in it which could offend anyone's religious susceptibilities, and upheld their expulsion. On 11 August 1986,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.jw.org/en/news/legal/by-region/india/supreme-court-national-anthem-free-speech/&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] reversed the High Court and ruled that the High Court had misdirected itself because the question is not whether a particular religious belief or practice appeals to our reason or sentiment but whether the belief is genuinely and conscientiously held as part of the profession or practice of a religion. "Our personal views and reactions are irrelevant" The Supreme Court affirmed the principle that it is not for a secular judge to sit in judgment on the correctness of a religious belief.&lt;ref name="jehovah_national_anthem"&gt;{{cite web|title=To sing or not to sing Vande Mataram|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/to-sing-or-not-to-sing-vande-mataram--------/11912/|publisher=Indian Express|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation |"There is no provision of law which obliges anyone to sing the National Anthem nor is it disrespectful to the National Anthem if a person who stands up respectfully when the National Anthem is sung does not join the singing. Proper respect is shown to the National Anthem by standing up when the National Anthem is sung. It will not be right to say that disrespect is shown by not joining in the singing. Standing up respectfully when the National Anthem is sung but not singing oneself clearly does not either prevent the singing of the National Anthem or cause disturbance to an assembly engaged in such singing so as to constitute the offence mentioned in s. 3 of the [[Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act]]".}}

On 30 November 2016, Supreme Court of India ordered the National Anthem must be played before movies in theaters, in order to instill "committed patriotism and nationalism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/national-anthem-national-flag-supreme-court-theater-4402827/ Supreme Court orders National Anthem must be played before movies in theaters]&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 February 2017, 2 Kashmiris were booked for not standing during anthem in Jammu Cinema, under provisions of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971. This was the first arrest of its kind made by a state government in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kashmirlife.net/2-kashmiris-booked-not-standing-anthem-jammu-cinema-131954/ 2 Kashmiris booked for not standing during anthem in Jammu Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://indianexpress.com/article/india/jk-in-a-first-state-govt-employee-among-two-arrested-for-not-standing-during-national-anthem/J&amp;K: In a first, state govt employee amongst two arrested for not standing during national anthem] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212092002/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/jk-in-a-first-state-govt-employee-among-two-arrested-for-not-standing-during-national-anthem/J%26K%3A/ |date=12 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, the government reversed its stance and requested that the Supreme Court rescind the order until a government panel could consider the issue in more depth; the court agreed, and so around 9 January 2018 the National Anthem ceased being compulsory in movie theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=India anthem not mandatory in cinemas|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-42618830|accessdate=10 January 2018|work=BBC News|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical significance ===
The composition was first sung during a convention of the [[Indian National Congress]] in [[Calcutta]] on 27 December 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countercurrents.org/comm-chatterjee310803.htm |title= Tagore and Jana Gana Mana |accessdate= |work=Monish R. Chatterjee}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sung on the second day of the convention, and the agenda of that day devoted itself to a loyal welcome of George V on his visit to India. The event was reported thus in the British Indian press:&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The Bengali poet [[Rabindranath Tagore]] sang a song composed by him specially to welcome the Emperor." (''Statesman'', Dec. 28, 1911)
&lt;br&gt;"The proceedings began with the singing by [[Rabindranath Tagore]] of a song specially composed by him in honour of the Emperor." (''Englishman'', Dec. 28, 1911)&lt;br&gt;"When the proceedings of the Indian National Congress began on Wednesday 27th December 1911, a Bengali song in welcome of the Emperor was sung. A resolution welcoming the Emperor and Empress was also adopted unanimously." (''Indian'', Dec. 29, 1911)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Counter arguments====

Many historians aver that the newspaper reports cited above were misguided. The confusion arose in British Indian press since a different song, "[[Badshah Humara]]" written in [[Hindi]] by Rambhuj Chaudhary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacw.net/DC/CommunalismCollection/ArticlesArchive/pkDatta092004.html |title= India: Are we still singing for the Empire? |accessdate= |work=Pradip Kumar Datta}}&lt;/ref&gt; was sung on the same occasion in praise of the monarch. The nationalist Indian press stated this difference of events clearly:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The proceedings of the Congress party session started with a prayer in Bengali to praise God (song of benediction). This was followed by a resolution expressing loyalty to King George V. Then another song was sung welcoming King George V." (''[[Amrita Bazar Patrika]]'', Dec.28,1911)&lt;br&gt;
 "The annual session of Congress began by singing a song composed by the great Bengali poet Ravindranath Tagore. Then a resolution expressing loyalty to King George V was passed. A song paying a heartfelt homage to King George V was then sung by a group of boys and girls." (''The Bengalee'', Dec. 28, 1911)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Even the report of the annual session of the Indian National Congress of December 1911 stated this difference:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"On the first day of 28th annual session of the Congress, proceedings started after singing Vande Mataram. On the second day the work began after singing a patriotic song by Babu Ravindranath Tagore. Messages from well wishers were then read and a resolution was passed expressing loyalty to King George V. Afterwards the song composed for welcoming King George V and Queen Mary was sung."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 10 November 1937 Tagore wrote a letter to Mr Pulin Bihari Sen about the controversy. That letter in Bengali can be found in Tagore's biography'' Ravindrajivani, volume II page 339'' by ''Prabhatkumar Mukherjee''.
&lt;blockquote&gt; "A certain high official in His Majesty's service, who was also my friend, had requested that I write a song of felicitation towards the Emperor. The request simply amazed me. It caused a great stir in my heart. In response to that great mental turmoil, I pronounced the victory in Jana Gana Mana of that Bhagya Bidhata [ed. God of Destiny] of India who has from age after age held steadfast the reins of India's chariot through rise and fall, through the straight path and the curved. That Lord of Destiny, that Reader of the Collective Mind of India, that Perennial Guide, could never be George V, George VI, or any other George. Even my official friend understood this about the song. After all, even if his admiration for the crown was excessive, he was not lacking in simple common sense."&lt;ref name="Controversy Surrounding The Indian National Anthem"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rareindianfacts.org/2012/12/controversy-surrounding-indian-national.html|title=Controversy Surrounding The Indian National Anthem|publisher=Rare India Fact|accessdate=23 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218024543/http://www.rareindianfacts.org/2012/12/controversy-surrounding-indian-national.html|archivedate=18 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Again in his letter of 19 March 1939 Tagore writes:&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-16241465|title=BBC News – Indian anthem Jana Gana Mana turns 100|date=27 December 2011|publisher=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"I should only insult myself if I cared to answer those who consider me capable of such unbounded stupidity as to sing in praise of George the Fourth or George the Fifth as the Eternal Charioteer leading the pilgrims on their journey through countless ages of the timeless history of mankind."
''(Purvasa, Phalgun, 1354, p. 738.)''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moreover, Tagore was hailed as a patriot who wrote other songs too apart from "Jana Gana Mana" lionising the Indian independence movement. He renounced his knighthood in protest against the 1919 [[Jallianwala Bagh Massacre]]. The Knighthood (i.e. the title of 'Sir') was conferred on him by the same King George V after receiving the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] for "[[Gitanjali]]" from the government of Sweden. Two of Tagore's more politically charged compositions, "[[Chitto Jetha Bhayshunyo]]" ("Where the Mind is Without Fear", Gitanjali Poem #35) and "[[Ekla Chalo Re]]" ("If They Answer Not to Thy Call, Walk Alone"), gained mass appeal, with the latter favoured by Gandhi and Netaji.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

=== Regional aspects ===
Another controversy is that only those provinces that were under British rule, i.e. [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Sind Province (1936–55)|Sindh]], [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra|Maratha]], [[Dravidian peoples|Dravid]] ([[South India]]), [[Odisha]]/[[Utkal]] and [[Bengal]], were mentioned. None of the princely states – [[Kashmir]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]], [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]] or [[Kerala]] – or the states in [[Northeast India]], which are now integral parts of [[India]] were mentioned. But opponents of this proposition claim that [[Rabindranath Tagore|Tagore]] mentioned only the border states of [[India]] to include complete [[India]]. Whether the [[princely state]]s would form a part of a liberated [[India|Indian republic]] was a matter of debate even till [[Independence Day (India)|Indian Independence]]. 'Dravida' includes the people from the south (though Dravida specifically means Tamil and even then, the same consideration is not given for the south since there are many distinct people whereas in the north each of the distinct people are named) and 'Jolodhi' (Stanza 1) is Sanskrit for "seas and oceans". Even North-East which was under British rule or holy rivers apart from Ganges and Yamuna are not mentioned to keep the song in its rhythm. India has 29 states, 7 union territories.

In 2005, there were calls to delete the word "Sindh" and substitute it with the word [[Kashmir]]. The argument was that [[Sindh]] was no longer a part of India, having become part of Pakistan as a result of the [[Partition of India|Partition]] of 1947. Opponents of this proposal hold that the word "Sindh" refers to the [[Indus river|Indus]] and to [[Sindhi people|Sindhi]] culture, and that Sindhi people are an integral part of India's cultural fabric. The [[Supreme Court of India]] declined to change the national anthem and the wording remains unchanged.

On 17 December 2013, MLA of [[Assam]], [[Phani Bhushan Choudhury]] cited article of '[[The Times of India]]' published on 26 January 1950, stating that originally the word 'Kamarup' was included in the song, but was later changed to 'Sindhu' and claimed that Kamarup should be re-included.&lt;ref name=at1712&gt;[http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=dec1813/at096 ''State to seek newspaper clarification on report''. STAFF Reporter. Assam Tribune, 17-12-2013]&lt;/ref&gt; To this, the then minister [[Rockybul Hussain]] replied that the state government would initiate steps in this regard after response from the newspaper.&lt;ref name=at1712/&gt; The debate was further joined by the then minister [[Ardhendu Dey]], mentioning '[[Sanchayita]]' (edited by Tagore himself) etc. where he said Kamrup was not mentioned.&lt;ref name=at1712/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2634">'''Sir John Schorne''' (died 1313) was [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]] of [[North Marston]] in the [[England|English]] county of [[Buckinghamshire]]. He was a very pious man and was said to have effected many [[miracle|miraculous]] cures for [[gout]] and [[toothache]]. 
[[Image:NorthMarstonWell.JPG|right|120px|thumb|The Schorne Well at North Marston, Schorne Lane]]

During a [[drought]], he discovered a [[water well|well]], whose [[water]]s were reputed to have miraculous properties. His reputation for [[holy|holiness]] was such that he is believed to have cast the [[devil]] into a [[boot]]. He is often pictured holding a boot with a devil in it, which was [http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/jack-in-the-box.html thought to be the origin] of the child's [[jack-in-the-box]] toy. However, the toy did not come about until over 500 years after Schorne's time. When he died, his shrine in the church at North Marston became a popular place of [[pilgrim]]age and he was regarded by many as a [[saint]], although he was never canonised. His remains were later moved to [[St George's Chapel, Windsor]], the burial place of English monarchs. [[Henry VIII]], who was buried there, went on pilgrimage to Schorne's Well in July 1511&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2F4297_3DA98D16DA42063CFD530E25714FEF88_journals__HIS_HIS57_01_S0018246X13000368a.pdf&amp;cover=Y&amp;code=e9c7530ec97e6fb550aadfcbedad50cd [[Richard Rex]], ''The Religion of Henry VIII'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt; and May 1521.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Starkey]], p.7, ''Henry''&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy Well was renovated in 2004/2005 and may still be seen in North Marston.

There was a rector in [[Princes Risborough]] called John de Schorne in circa 1289, according to the list of rectors in the front of the [[parish register]].  It is likely to be the same person, though this is difficult to confirm for certain.&lt;ref&gt;Princes Risborough Parish Register, held at the [[Centre for Buckinghamshire Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the two team [[benefice]]s in [[Claydon (deanery)|Claydon Deanery]] is named after Schorne to this day.

'''''Koyaanisqatsi''''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|k|oʊ|j|ɑː|n|ɪ|s|ˈ|k|ɑː|t|s|iː}}&lt;ref name="eol"/&gt;), also known as '''''Koyaanisqatsi:  Life Out of Balance''''', is a 1982 American [[experimental film]] directed by [[Godfrey Reggio]] with music composed by [[Philip Glass]] and cinematography by [[Ron Fricke]].

The film consists primarily of [[slow motion]] and [[time-lapse]] footage of cities and many natural landscapes across the [[United States]]. The visual [[Symphonic poem|tone poem]] contains neither [[dialogue]] nor a vocalized narration: its tone is set by the juxtaposition of images and music. Reggio explained the lack of dialogue by stating "it's not for lack of love of the language that these films have no words. It's because, from my point of view, our language is in a state of vast humiliation. It no longer describes the world in which we live."&lt;ref name=eol&gt;{{cite video |people=Carson, Greg (director) |date=2002 |title=Essence of Life |medium=DVD |publisher=[[MGM Home Entertainment]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Hopi language]], the word ''Koyaanisqatsi'' means "unbalanced life".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philipglass.com/films/koyaanisqatsi/|title=Film: Koyaanisqatsi|accessdate=2017-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is the first in the [[Qatsi trilogy]] of films: it is followed by ''[[Powaqqatsi]]'' (1988) and ''[[Naqoyqatsi]]'' (2002). The [[trilogy]] depicts different aspects of the relationship between humans, nature and technology. ''Koyaanisqatsi'' is the best known of the trilogy and is considered a [[cult film]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/content/cult-koyaanisqatsi-blends-music-film|title=Cult ''Koyaanisqatsi'' blends music, film|work=The Michigan Daily|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of [[copyright]] issues, the film was [[out of print]] for most of the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiritofbaraka.com/koyaanisqatsi |title=Koyaanisqatsi |work=Spirit of Baraka |date=2007-05-21 |accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The first image in the film is of the Great Gallery [[pictograph]] in [[Horseshoe Canyon (Utah)|Horseshoe Canyon]], in [[Canyonlands National Park]], Utah. The section shown depicts several tall, shadowed figures standing near a taller figure adorned with a crown. The next image is a [[close-up]] of a [[Saturn V]] rocket during its launch ([[Apollo 11]]). The film fades into a shot of a desolate desert landscape. From there, it progresses to footage of various natural phenomena such as waves and clouds.

The film's introduction to human involvement in the environment is a low aerial shot of choppy water, cutting to a similar shot of rows of cultivated flowers. After aerial views of monumental rock formations partly drowned by the artificial [[Lake Powell]], we see a large mining truck causing billows of black dust. This is followed by shots of [[electric power transmission|power lines]] in the desert. Man's continued involvement in the environment is depicted through images of mining operations, oil fields, the [[Navajo Generating Station]], the [[Glen Canyon Dam]], and [[atomic bomb]] detonations in a desert. Following the atomic bomb detonations, the next sequence begins with a shot of sunbathers on a beach, then pans to the [[San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station]] in the background. Shots of taxiing [[United Airlines]] [[Boeing 747]] aircraft and traffic patterns during [[rush hour]] are seen on a [[freeway]] and a shot of a large parking lot. This is followed with stock footage of Soviet tanks lined up in rows and a military aircraft, and an [[aircraft carrier]].

[[Time-lapse]] photography of shadows of clouds are seen moving across the skyscrapers. Shots of various [[housing projects]] in disrepair, and includes footage of the decay and demolition of the [[Pruitt-Igoe|Pruitt-Igoe housing project]] in [[St. Louis]]. The sequence ends with footage of the destruction of large buildings. A [[time-lapse]] shot of a crowd of people who appear to be waiting in a line. This is followed by shots of people walking along streets in [[slow motion]].

The next sequence begins with shots of buildings and a shot of a sunset reflected in the glass of a skyscraper. The sequence uses [[time-lapse]] photography of the activity of modern life. The events captured in this sequence involve people interacting with modern technology. The first shots are traffic patterns as seen from skyscrapers at night. This is followed by a composite shot of the moon passing behind a skyscraper. The next shots are closer shots of cars on a highway. The sun rises over the city and we see people hurrying to work. The film shows at regular speed the operation of machines packaging food. People are shown sorting mail, sewing [[jeans]], manufacturing televisions and doing other jobs with the use of modern technology. A shot of [[hot dogs]] being sent down rows of conveyors is followed by a shot of people moving up [[escalator]]s. The frenetic speed and pace of the cuts and music do not slow as shots of modern leisure are shown. People eat, play, shop and work at the same speed. The sequence begins to come full circle as the manufacture of cars in an [[assembly line]] [[factory]] is shown.

More shots of highway traffic are shown, this time in daylight. The film shows the movement of cars, shopping carts, and televisions on an assembly line, and elevators moving from first-person perspective. The film then shows clips from various television shows being [[channel surfing|channel surfed]] in fast motion. The film, in slow motion, then shows several people reacting to being candidly filmed on the street. The camera stays on them until the moment when they acknowledge its presence by looking directly at it. The sequence then shows cars moving much faster than they were moving before.

Pictures of microchips and satellite photography of metropolitan cities are shown, comparing the lay of each of them. Various shots of people are seen from all walks of modern life, from beggars to debutantes. The final sequence shows footage of a rocket lifting off, only to end up exploding after a few seconds. Editing suggest that there is only one rocket, while in fact two different events were used: The first batch of footage shows a [[Saturn V]] lifting off (Apollo 11), followed by footage of the May 1962 explosion of the first [[Atlas-Centaur]]. The camera follows a flaming rocket engine and a white vapor trail or smoke against a blue sky as the debris plummets toward the ground. The film concludes with another shot of desert rock art similar to the image at the beginning. Epilogue shows the translation of the titular [[Hopi]] word and of the prophecies sung in the last part of the soundtrack.

==Production==

===Background===
In 1972, [[Godfrey Reggio]], of the Institute for Regional Education (IRE), was working on a media campaign in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], which was sponsored by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU). The campaign involved [[privacy law|invasions of privacy]] and the use of technology to control behavior. Instead of making [[public service announcement]]s, which Reggio felt "had no visibility," advertising spots were purchased for television, radio, newspapers, and billboards.{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=383}} Over thirty billboards were used for the campaign, and one design featured a close-up of the [[human eye]], which Reggio described as a "horrifying image."{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=384}} To produce the television commercials the IRE hired cinematographer [[Ron Fricke]], who worked on the project for two years. The television advertisements aired during [[prime time]] programming and became so popular that viewers would call the television stations to learn when the next advertisement would be aired.{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=383}} Godfrey described the two-year campaign as "extraordinarily successful," and as a result, [[Methylphenidate|Ritalin (methylphenidate)]] was eliminated as a behavior-modifying drug in many New Mexico school districts.{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=384}} But after the campaign ended, the ACLU eventually withdrew its sponsorship, and the IRE unsuccessfully attempted to raise millions of dollars at a fundraiser in [[Washington, D.C.]] The institute only had $40,000 left in their budget, and Reggio was unsure how to use the small amount of funds. Fricke insisted to Reggio that the money could be used to produce a film, which led to the production of ''Koyaanisqatsi.''{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=63}}

===Filming===
[[File:Pruitt-Igoe-collapses.jpg|thumb|The demolition of the [[Pruitt–Igoe]] housing project in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] was one of the first scenes filmed once production began in 1975.]]
Fricke and Reggio chose to shoot unscripted footage and edit it into an hour-long film.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=63}}  Production began in 1975 in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=385}}  [[16 mm film]] was used due to budget constraints, despite the preference to shoot with [[35 mm film]].{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=385}}{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=386}}  Footage of the [[Pruitt–Igoe]] housing project was shot from a helicopter, and Fricke nearly passed out during filming, having never flown in a helicopter before.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=63}}  Reggio later chose to shoot in [[Los Angeles]] and [[New York City]].  As there was no formal script, Fricke shot whatever he felt would "look good on film".{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=64}}  While filming in New York City, Fricke developed an idea to shoot portraits of people. A grey paper backdrop was displayed in [[Times Square]], and Fricke stood {{convert|10|ft|m|sigfig=1}} back with the camera. People walking by started posing for the camera, thinking it was a [[still camera]], and several shots from the setup ended up in the film. Reggio was not on location in Times Square when Fricke shot the footage and thought the idea of shooting portraits of people was "foolish". Upon viewing the footage, Reggio decided to devote an entire section of the film to portraits. The footage was [[photographic processing|processed]] with a special chemical to enhance the film's shadows and details, as all footage was shot only with existing lighting.  The IRE's $40,000 was exhausted after the filming, and almost two cases of film had been used.  The unedited footage was screened in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]], but Fricke said it was "boring as hell" and there were "not that many good shots".{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=64}}  Fricke later moved to [[Los Angeles]], and took a job as a waiter, unable to get a job in the film industry.  While Fricke was working in Los Angeles, he edited the footage into a twenty-minute reel, but "without regard for message or political content".{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=64}}

{{quote box|quote=I just shot anything that I thought would look good on film. Shooting bums, as well as buildings, didn't matter. It was all the same from my standpoint. I just shot the form of things.|source=—Ron Fricke{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=64}}|width=250px}}

The IRE was continuously receiving funding and wanted to continue the project in 1976, using 35&amp;nbsp;mm film.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=64}}  After quitting his waiting job, Fricke traveled with a camera crew to the [[Four Corners]], which was chosen for filming for its "alien look".{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=66}} Due to the limited budget, Fricke shot with a 16&amp;nbsp;mm [[zoom lens]] onto 35&amp;nbsp;mm film. To compensate for the lens size, a 2× extender was added, which turned it into a full 35&amp;nbsp;mm zoom lens, allowing footage to be clearly captured onto 35&amp;nbsp;mm film.  The two-week shoot included [[aerial shot|aerial footage]] taken from an airplane using a [[hand-held camera]] and ground footage taken using a [[tripod]]. The first aerial footage was too "shaky", so additional footage was taken from a camera mounted onto the airplane. Fricke traveled back to New York City in 1977, during which the [[New York City blackout of 1977|New York City blackout]] occurred. Footage of the blackout was filmed in [[Harlem]] and the [[South Bronx]], and the film was [[colorfulness|desaturated]] to match the appearance of the 16&amp;nbsp;mm footage.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=66}}

Reggio and Fricke came across [[time-lapse]] footage in "some low-visibility commercial work". They felt such footage was "the language [they] were missing", and collectively decided to implement time-lapse as a major part of the film to create "an experience of acceleration". For the time-lapse footage, Fricke purchased a [[Mitchell Camera|Mitchell]] camera,{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=66}} and built a motor with an [[intervalometer]], which was used to precisely move the camera between frames. The system was powered by a [[VRLA battery|gel cell battery]] that lasted for twelve hours, which enabled Fricke to shoot without the use of a [[electric generator|generator]].{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=68}} Most time-lapse shots were filmed at a [[frame rate]] of 1½ frames per second. Fricke wanted the footage to "look normal" and not contain any "gimmicky" special effects.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=68}} The time-lapse shot overlooking the freeway in Los Angeles was filmed from the top of a building through a [[multiple exposure|double exposure]], with ten-second delay between frames. The first take was shot throughout the day for twelve hours, then the film was rewound and the same scene was shot at night for twenty minutes.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=68}}

The scene with the [[Boeing 747]] on the runway was filmed at [[Los Angeles International Airport]], and was the longest continuous shot in the film. Fricke and his [[focus puller]], Robert Hill, filmed at the airport every day for two weeks.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=70}} To keep the shot of the 747 within the frame, the camera was slowly moved by increasing the voltage to the gear motors.{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=68}}

In addition to footage shot by Fricke, some of the footage of people and traffic in New York City was shot by cinematographer [[Hilary Harris]]. During [[post-production]], Reggio was introduced to Harris' ''Organism'' (1975), which predominately features time-lapse footage of New York City streets. Reggio was impressed with Harris' work and subsequently hired him to work on ''Koyaanisqatsi''.{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=387}}  Footage filmed by cinematographer [[Louis Schwartzberg]] was added into the cloud sequence, and additional stock footage was provided by [[MacGillivray Freeman Films]].{{sfn|Gold|1984|p=72}}

While Reggio was working on post-production at the [[Samuel Goldwyn Studio]] in 1981,&lt;ref name="lonegiant"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/interview_lone_giant_godfrey_reggios_naqoyqatsi/|title=INTERVIEW: Lone Giant: Godfrey Reggio's 'Naqoyqatsi{{'-}}|work=[[IndieWire]]|date=October 18, 2002|accessdate=April 26, 2011|first=Erin|last=Torneo}}&lt;/ref&gt; he met film director [[Francis Ford Coppola]] through an associate from [[Zoetrope Studios]], Coppola's production company. Prior to shooting ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]'' (1983) and ''[[Rumble Fish]]'' (1983), Coppola requested to see ''Koyaanisqatsi'', and Reggio arranged a private screening shortly after its completion.{{sfn|MacDonald|1992|p=399}}  Coppola told Reggio that he was waiting for a film such as ''Koyaanisqatsi'' and that it was "important for people to see", so he added his name into the credits and helped present and distribute the film.{{sfn|Ramsey|1986|p=62}}  Coppola also decided to introduce and end the film with footage of [[pictogram|pictographs]] from the Great Gallery at [[Horseshoe Canyon (Utah)|Horseshoe Canyon]] in [[Utah]], after visiting the site and becoming fascinated by the ancient sandstone murals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1986-08-10/news/vw-2386_1_horseshoe-canyon|title=The Past Comes to Life in Horseshoe Canyon|first=Charles|last=Hillinger|date=August 10, 1986|accessdate=April 26, 2011|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's soundtrack by [[Philip Glass]] was released in 1983, after the release of the film.  Even though the amount of music in the film was almost as long as the film itself, the soundtrack release was only 46 minutes long and featured only selections from the film's pieces. In 1998, Glass rerecorded the album through [[Nonesuch Records]] with a length of 73 minutes, 21 seconds.  The rerecording of the album featured two additional tracks from the film, as well as extended versions of previous tracks from the original album.  The album was released as a Philip Glass album titled ''Koyaanisqatsi'', rather than a soundtrack to the film. The music has become so popular that the [[Philip Glass Ensemble]] has toured the world, playing the music for ''Koyaanisqatsi'' live in front of the movie screen.

The opening for "The Grid" begins with slow sustained notes on brass instruments. The music builds in speed and [[dynamics (music)|dynamics]] throughout the piece's 21 minutes. When the piece is at its fastest, it is characterized by a [[synthesizer]] playing the piece's bass line [[ostinato]].

Glass's music for the film is a highly recognizable example of the [[minimal music|minimalist]] school of composition, which is characterized by heavily repeated figures, simple structures, and a tonal (although not in the traditional [[common practice]] sense of the word) harmonic language. Glass was one of the first composers to employ minimalism in film scoring, paving the way for many future composers of that style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eaton |first=Rebecca Marie Doran |date=May 2008 |title=Unheard Minimalisms: The Functions of the Minimalist Technique in Film Scores |url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/3839/eatonr88741.pdf |location=Austin, TX |publisher=The University of Texas at Austin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete original soundtrack recording was released on CD in 2009 on Glass's own label [[Orange Mountain Music]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/Koyaanisqatsi-09.php Complete Original Soundtrack (Orange Mountain Music) OMM 0058] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608193034/http://www.philipglass.com/music/recordings/Koyaanisqatsi-09.php |date=June 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning==
Reggio stated that the ''Qatsi'' films are intended to simply create an experience and that "it is up [to] the viewer to take for himself/herself what it is that [the film] means."  He also said that "these films have never been about the effect ''of'' technology, ''of'' industry ''on'' people. It's been that everyone: politics, education, things of the financial structure, the nation state structure, language, the culture, religion, all of that exists within the host of technology. So it's not the effect ''of'', it's that everything exists within [technology]. It's not that we ''use'' technology, we ''live'' technology. Technology has become as ubiquitous as the air we breathe ..."&lt;ref name="eol"/&gt;

According to ''[[Hopi Dictionary: Hopìikwa Lavàytutuveni]]'', the [[Hopi language|Hopi]] word ''koyaanisqatsi'' ({{IPA-all|kojɑːnisˈkɑtsi|Hopi pronunciation:}}){{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=863}} is defined as "life of moral corruption and turmoil" or "life out of balance".{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=154}}  The prefix ''koyaanis–'' means "corrupted" or "chaotic", and the word ''qatsi'' means "life" or "existence",{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=463}} literally translating ''koyaanisqatsi'' as "chaotic life".{{sfn|Hopi Dictionary Project|1998|p=154}}  The film also defines the word as "crazy life", "life in turmoil", "life disintegrating", and "a state of life that calls for another way of living".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org/films/k_defs.php|title=Koyaanisqatsi definitions|work=Koyaanisqatsi.org|publisher=Institute for Regional Education|accessdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the score by [[Philip Glass]], the word "Koyaanisqatsi" is chanted at the beginning and end of the film in an "otherworldly"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neveldine|first=Robert Burns|title=Bodies at Risk: Unsafe Limits in Romanticism and Postmodernism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcJGLUMD-boC&amp;pg=PA112|year=1998|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791436493|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; dark, sepulchral ''[[basso profondo]]'' by singer Albert de Ruiter over a solemn, four-bar organ-passacaglia bassline. Three [[Hopi prophecies]] sung by a choral ensemble during the latter part of the "Prophecies" movement are translated just prior to the end credits:
* "If we dig precious things from the land, we will invite disaster."
* "Near the day of Purification, there will be cobwebs spun back and forth in the sky."
* "A container of ashes might one day be thrown from the sky, which could burn the land and boil the oceans."

During the end titles, the film gives [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Ivan Illich]], [[David Monongye]], [[Guy Debord]], and [[Leopold Kohr]] credit for inspiration. Moreover, amongst the consultants to the director are listed such names as Jeffrey Lew, T.A. Price, Belle Carpenter, Cybelle Carpenter, [[Langdon Winner]], and Barbara Pecarich.

[[Triumph Films]] offered to [[Film distributor|distribute]] the film, but Reggio turned down the offer as he wanted to work with a smaller company so he could be more involved with the release. He chose Island Alive as the distributor, a company newly formed in 1983 by [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Founder: Chris Blackwell|url=http://www.islandoutpost.com/about_us/our_founder/|publisher=Island Outpost|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Koyaanisqatsi'' was the company's first release.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"/&gt;  Select theaters distributed a pamphlet that defined the title and the Hopi prophecies sung in the film, as well as a copy of the soundtrack from Island Records.  The first theatrical run featured four-track [[Dolby Stereo]] sound, while later runs featured [[monaural]] sound.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"/&gt;

The film's initial [[limited release]] began in [[San Francisco]] at the [[Castro Theatre]] on April 27, 1983.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/releases.php?mode=theatrical&amp;month=April&amp;year=1983|title=Theatrical Release Dates – April 1983|work=[[JoBlo.com]]|accessdate=September 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The producers spent $6,500 on marketing the initial release, which grossed $46,000 throughout its one-week run, and was the highest-grossing film in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] that week.  It was released in [[Los Angeles]] a month later where it grossed $300,000 at two theaters within 15 weeks.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"/&gt;  Additional releases in select cities throughout the United States continued in September 1983, beginning with a release in New York City on September 15.  In mid-October, ''Koyaanisqatsi'' was released onto 40–50 screens throughout the country.&lt;ref name="boxoffice"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Marketing of Koyaanisqatsi: Market It?

===Home media===
''Koyaanisqatsi'' was originally released on [[VHS]] and [[laserdisc]] by [[Michael Nesmith]]'s [[Pacific Arts Corporation|Pacific Arts Video]].

The [[film rights|rights]] to ''Koyaanisqatsi'' were passed through various multinational entertainment companies, which eventually prevented a home video release.  IRE enforced their legal and contractual rights by creating a [[United States federal courts|federal court]] [[lawsuit]]. IRE distributed a privately issued release of the film on DVD.  The release was available to those who made a donation of at least $180 to IRE, and was distributed in a sleeve that was signed by Reggio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109061600/http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org/howyoucanhelp/help_IRE.las |url=http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org/howyoucanhelp/help_IRE.las |title=How You Can Help: Getting Involved |accessdate=November 21, 2016 |work=Koyaanisqatsi.org |publisher=IRE |archivedate=November 9, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)]] eventually received the rights to the film, and ''Koyaanisqatsi'' was released on DVD by [[MGM Home Entertainment]] on September 18, 2002, coinciding with the release of ''[[Naqoyqatsi]]'' (2002).  Both films were available in a two-disc box set.  Each DVD includes a documentary with interviews by Reggio and Glass and trailers for the [[Qatsi trilogy|''Qatsi'' trilogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/dvdsavant/s582reggio.html|title=Koyaanisqatsi &amp; Powaqqatsi|first=Glenn|last=Erickson|work=DVD Savant|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the IRE release, which featured the film in the [[open matte]] format in which it was filmed, the MGM release was in cropped into a [[widescreen]] aspect as it was originally presented in theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|series=Comparison between the two versions|url=http://www.dvdbeaver.com/film/DVDCompare2/koyaanisqatsi.htm|accessdate=June 6, 2011|title=Koyaanisqatsi DVD Comparison|work=DVD Beaver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 13, 2012, a Blu-ray version (screen ratio 16:9) was released in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0063NT8UG|title=German Blu-ray release|work=Amazon.de|accessdate=April 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blu-ray was also released in Australia by [[Umbrella Entertainment]] on March 22, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umbrellaent.com.au/p-3302-koyaanisqatsi-blu-ray.aspx|title=Australian Blu-ray release|work=Umbrellaent.com.au|accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, [[The Criterion Collection|Criterion]] released in the US a remastered Blu-ray and DVD of ''Koyaanisqatsi'', as part of a box set containing the ''Qatsi'' Trilogy.

==Reception==
''Koyaanisqatsi'' has a score of 89% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] out of 18 reviews.&lt;ref name="rottent"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/koyaanisqatsi_life_out_of_balance |title=Koyaanisqatsi – Life Out of Balance (1982) |accessdate=2013-04-26 |work=Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the film was entered into the [[33rd Berlin International Film Festival]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1983/02_programm_1983/02_Programm_1983.html |title=Berlinale: 1983 Programme |accessdate=2010-11-17 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, ''Koyaanisqatsi'' was selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.koyaanisqatsi.org/aboutus/press.php|title=Koyaanisqatsi Added to the National Film Registry|date=December 31, 2000|accessdate=May 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Koyaanisqatsi'' is followed by the sequels ''[[Powaqqatsi]]'' and ''[[Naqoyqatsi]]'' and the shorts ''[[Anima Mundi (film)|Anima Mundi]]'' and ''Evidence.'' ''Naqoyqatsi'' was completed after a lengthy delay caused by funding problems and premiered in the United States on October 18, 2002. The film's [[cinematographer]], [[Ron Fricke]], went on to direct ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'', a [[pure cinema]] movie which is often compared to ''Koyaanisqatsi''.

==Influences==
* The film inspired the Belgian post-rock band [[We Stood Like Kings]] to write a new soundtrack under the title USA 1982, released in 2017 on the German label Kapitän Platte and presented at the cultural venue [[Centre for Fine Arts, Brussels]] in October 2017.  
* The trailer for ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'' resembles the style of the film, featuring different shots of the fictional Liberty City, with the track "Pruit Igoe" in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ndr *|title=GTA IV trailer|date=2007-03-29|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGXCyMrZ1jA|accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2009 film ''[[Watchmen (film)|Watchmen]]'' accompanies the [[origin story]] of its character [[Doctor Manhattan]] with a montage of the pieces "Prophecies" and "Pruit Igoe", and features the same tracks in its trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://movies.about.com/od/watchmen/a/watchmen-songs.htm|title=What Songs Appear on the 'Watchmen' Movie Soundtrack?|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The film inspired the album ''Music To Films'' by Dr. Atmo and [[Oliver Lieb]], released on the record label [[FAX +49-69/450464]]. The music is completely synchronized to the film.
*The film inspired filmmaker Param P. Tomanec to direct experimental documentary ''Rasa Yatra'' (2012).
* The film's title song was featured in two episodes of the TV series ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''. The first time was in "[[My New God]]" when the [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]]  gave the "evil eye" to J.D. The second time was in "[[My Chopped Liver]]" when the [[Janitor (Scrubs)|Janitor]] gave the "evil eye" to [[Carla (Scrubs)|Carla]] accompanied by [[The Todd|Todd]], [[Laverne Roberts|Laverne]] and [[Ted (Scrubs)|Ted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=My New God |episodelink=List of Scrubs episodes#Season 5: 2006 |series=Scrubs |serieslink=Scrubs (TV series) |network=[[NBC]] |season=5 |number=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=My Chopped Liver |episodelink=List of Scrubs episodes#Season 5: 2006 |series=Scrubs |serieslink=Scrubs (TV series) |network=[[NBC]] |season=5 |number=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The title song appears in Season Six of the CW series ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', in the episode "We've Got Magic to Do". Kirk performs an interpretive dance as the song plays in the background.
* The chanted "koyaanisqatsi" lyric from the film's title song was [[parody|parodied]] in [[P. D. Q. Bach]]'s "Prelude to Einstein on the Fritz" (itself a pun on the title of the opera ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'' composed by Philip Glass), replaced with the lyric "coy hotsy-totsy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/1999-01-19/music/classical-trash/ |title=Classical Trash |work=[[The Village Voice]] |first=Kyle |last=Gann |date=1999-01-19 |accessdate=2008-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Madonna's video for "[[Ray of Light (song)|Ray of Light]]" visually resembles ''Koyaanisqatsi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.beyondrobson.com/music/2006/02/glass_is_philip_qe_not_halfempty/ |title=Glass is Philip; QE not half-empty |work=Beyond Robson |date=2006-02-24 |accessdate=2008-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007151738/http://www.beyondrobson.com/music/2006/02/glass_is_philip_qe_not_halfempty/ |archive-date=October 7, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The film's title theme also inspired the soundtrack to the classic 1987 video game ''[[Delta (video game)|Delta]]'', which became one of the best known video game soundtracks by [[Rob Hubbard]].
* A 2010 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', "[[Stealing First Base]]", features a parody [[Itchy &amp; Scratchy]] film entitled ''Koyaanis-Scratchy: Death out of Balance''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Short |first1=Hogan |title=11 Films You Didn't Know Were Perfect to Watch on 4/20 |url=http://beatroute.ca/2017/04/17/11-films-didnt-know-perfect-watch-420/ |accessdate=25 August 2018 |work=BeatRoute Magazine |date=17 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 2013 comedy film ''[[Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa]]'' opens with shots of the Norfolk coastline similar to style to ''Koyaanisqatsi'', with the title track also playing. 
* Clips from the film were used in The B-52's music video for "[[Rock Lobster]]".
*Possibly, the film's iconic sped-up city imagery was inspired by the title sequence for [[Jack Garfein]]'s 1961 cult classic ''[[Something Wild (1961 film)|Something Wild]]''. The title sequence was created by [[Saul Bass]] and shows city imagery very reminiscent of ''Koyaanisqatsi''.

The '''laying on of hands''' is a religious practice. In [[Christianity|Christian churches]], this practice is used as both a symbolic and formal method of invoking the [[Holy Spirit]] primarily during [[baptism]]s and confirmations, [[Faith healing|healing service]]s, [[blessing]]s, and [[ordination]] of [[priest]]s, [[minister of religion|minister]]s, [[Elder (religious)|elder]]s, [[deacon]]s, and other church officers, along with a variety of other church [[sacrament]]s and holy ceremonies.

The practice of laying on of hands is also used in [[Navajo]] religious ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lewton|first1=Elizabeth L.|last2=Bydone|first2=Victoria|title=Identity and Healing in Three Navajo Religious Traditions: Sa'ah Naagháí Bik'eh Hózho|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|date=1 December 2000|volume=14|issue=4|pages=476–497|doi=10.1525/maq.2000.14.4.476|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1525/maq.2000.14.4.476/full|accessdate=22 June 2016|language=en|issn=1548-1387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewish tradition==
The laying on of hands was an action referred to on numerous occasions in the [[Tanakh]]  to accompany the conferring of a blessing or authority. 

[[Aaron]] and the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priests]] who succeeded him symbolically transferred the sins of the [[Children of Israel]] to a [[scapegoat|sacrificial goat]] by the laying on of hands: [[Leviticus]]{{bibleverse-nb||Leviticus|16:21|HE}}. [[Moses]] ordained [[Joshua]] through ''[[semikhah]]''—i.e. by the laying on of hands: {{Bibleverse|Num||27:15–23|HE}}, {{Bibleverse|Deut||34:9|HE}}. The Bible adds that Joshua was thereby "filled with the spirit of wisdom". Moses also ordained the 70 elders ({{Bibleverse|Num||11:16–25|HE}}). The elders later ordained their successors in this way. Their successors in turn ordained others. This chain of hands-on ''semikhah'' continued through the time of the [[Second Temple]], to an undetermined time.  The exact date that the original ''semikhah'' succession ended is not certain.  Many medieval authorities believed that this occurred during the reign of Hillel II, circa AD 360.&lt;ref&gt;Nachmanides, ''Sefer Hazekhut'', Gittin ch 4; Rabbenu Nissim, ibid; ''Sefer Haterumot'', Gate 45; R Levi ibn Haviv, ''Kuntras Hasemikhah''.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it seems to have continued at least until AD 425 when [[Theodosius II]] executed [[Gamaliel VI]] and suppressed the [[Nasi (Hebrew title)|Patriarchate]] and [[Sanhedrin]].{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Christian traditions==
{{main|Christian laying on of hands}}
[[File:Laying on of hands Finnish Lutheran ordination in Oulu.JPG|thumb|Laying on of hands Finnish Lutheran ordination in Oulu]]
In the [[New Testament]] the laying on of hands was associated with the receiving of the [[Holy Spirit]] (see [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|8:14–19|KJV}}). Initially the [[Twelve Apostles|Apostles]] laid hands on new believers as well as believers (see {{bibleverse||Acts|6:5–6|KJV}}). In the [[early church]], the practice continued and is still used in a wide variety of church ceremonies, such as during [[confirmation (sacrament)|confirmation]].

The [[New Testament]] also associates the laying on of hands with the conferral of authority or designation of a person to a position of responsibility. (See [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|6:6|KJV}}, [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|13:3|KJV}}; and {{bibleverse|1|Timothy|4:14|KJV}}. Also possibly [[Acts of the Apostles|Acts]] {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|14:23|KJV}}, where "ordained"—Greek: χειροτονήσαντες—may be translated "extended the hand".) The use of the laying on of hands for the [[ordination]] of church officers has continued in many branches of Christianity.

==State use==
{{main|Royal touch}}
{{refimprove section|date=May 2014}}

The laying on of hands, known as the [[royal touch]], was performed by [[Monarch|king]]s in [[England]] and [[France]], and was believed to cure [[scrofula]] (also called "King's Evil" at the time), a name given to a number of skin diseases. The rite of the king's touch began in France with [[Robert II the Pious]], but legend later attributed the practice to [[Clovis I|Clovis]] as [[Merovingian]] founder of the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] kingdom, and [[Edward the Confessor]] in England. The belief continued to be common throughout the [[Middle Ages]] but began to die out with [[the Enlightenment]]. [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] was the last British monarch to claim to possess this divine ability, though the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] [[pretender]]s also claimed to do so. The French monarchy maintained the practice up until the 19th century. The act was usually performed at large ceremonies, often at [[Easter]] or other holy days.

[[File:La masacre de San Bartolomé, por François Dubois.jpg|380px|thumb|The [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] (August 23, 1572) in Paris, France (painting by [[François Dubois]])]]
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being phased out due to its extreme size and impracticality. If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--Need to add: Jonestown Massacre--&gt;

The following is a list of events for which one of the commonly accepted names includes the word "[[massacre]]."&lt;ref name=Mikaberidze&gt;{{harvnb|Mikaberidze|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[:wikt:massacre|Massacre]]'' is defined in the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' as "the indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people or (less commonly) animals; carnage, butchery, slaughter in numbers". It also states that the term is used "in the names of certain massacres of history".&lt;ref name=OED_N&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;
The first recorded use in English of the word ''massacre'' in the name of an event is due to [[Christopher Marlow]] who in c. 1600 referred to what is now known as the  [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] as "The massacre at Paris"&lt;ref&gt;"Marlowe (c. 1600) (''title'') The massacre at Paris". [[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, n.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--
''Massacre'' can also be used as a verb, as "To kill (people or, less commonly, animals) in numbers, esp. brutally and indiscriminately".&lt;ref name=OED_V/&gt; The first usage of which was "(c. 1588) Men which make no conscience for gaine sake, to breake the law of the æternall, and massaker soules (...) are dangerous subjects",&lt;ref name=OED_V&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]] Massacre, v.&lt;/ref&gt; and this usage is not recorded in this list.--&gt;

The purpose of the list is to trace such of the term "massacre" specifically.
There are many alternative terms with similar connotations, such as [[:wikt:butchery|butchery]], [[:wikt:carnage|carnage]],  [[:wikt:bloodbath|bloodbath]], [[:wikt:mass killing|mass killing]], [[wikt:atrocity|atrocity]], etc. as well as euphemisms such as ''[[Sicilian Vespers|Vespers]]'', ''[[Blutgericht]]'' or "attack", "incident", "tragedy" (etc.), use of which are outside the scope of this list.
''Massacre'' is also used figuratively to describe dramatic events that did not involve any deaths, such as the "[[Hilo massacre]]" and the "[[Saturday Night Massacre]]"; this usage is also outside of the scope of this list.

==List of events==
&lt;!--This list may be in the process of being reduced in size due to current unwieldiness; events listed should only include events very widely, or overwhelmingly known under a name including the term "massacre".  If you are thinking of adding another massacre to this list, please instead consider adding it to the list of massacres in the country in which it occurred. If a list of massacres in that country is yet to have been created, please consider creating it, following the format for the existing lists. See discussion for more details.--&gt;
&lt;!--
;Inclusion criteria
#Inclusion in this list is based ''solely'' on evidence in multiple [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] that a name including the word "massacre" is one of the accepted names for that event. A reliable source that merely describes the event as ''being'' a massacre does not qualify the event for inclusion in this list. The word ''massacre'' must appear in the source as part of a ''name'' for the event.
#If possible, cite the date of the earliest authority giving the name in question under the "name" column
#Where there is dispute over this, discussion should be [[WP:MULTI|centralized]]. If it is discussed on the talk page of the article concerned, a link should be posted on the talk page of this list; if the discussion is on the talk page of this list, a link should be posted at the article's talk page.
;Notes
#Any name for the event which is established by use of [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable sources]] as being one of the accepted terms would usually also be included in the article on that event.
#Inclusion in this list does not ''of itself'' justify inclusion in the article, and nor does use of the name in an article justify inclusion in this list, because Wikipedia is not a [[Wikipedia:Verifiability#Reliable_sources|reliable source]]. Both uses must be based directly on explicit references to the sources, which should be cited in footnotes. However, it is hard to envisage any situation where a name including "massacre" could be included in this list but not mentioned in an article on the event (or vice versa); if that situation should arise, both the uses should be carefully examined.--&gt;

|[[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre|Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day]] (1835)&lt;br/&gt;"Massacre at Paris" (1600)&lt;ref&gt;Notable for the historically first use of "massacre" in the name of an event, by Marlowe (c. 1600); the name used by Marlowe was "The massacre at Paris".

''massacre de la Saint-Barthélemy'' which term had been in use since the 17th century (Louis Maimbourg, ''Histoire De La Ligue'', 1686).
Appositional "St. Bartholomew's Day massacre" (rather than genitival "Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day") first appears in American English in the first half of the 20th century (Oberlin Alumni Magazine 31.4, 1935, p. 102).&lt;/ref&gt;

|[[Boston Massacre]]&lt;br/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The event was almost immediately termed a "massacre" and used for propagandistic purposes, especially by [[Samuel Adams]]. A pamphlet with the title ''A short narrative of the horrid massacre in Boston, perpetrated in the evening of the fifth day of March, 1770, by soldiers of the 29th regiment, which with the 14th regiment were then quartered there; with some observations on the state of things prior to that catastrophe'' was printed still in 1770.
Appositional "Boston massacre" was in use by the early 1800s (Benjamin Austin, ''Constitutional Republicanism, in Opposition to Fallacious Federalism'', 1803, 
 [https://books.google.ch/books?id=fvY-AAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA314 p. 314]).
The term "[[Massacre Day]]" for the annual remembrance  held during 1771&amp;ndash;1783 dates to the late 19th century (Augusta De Grasse Stevens, ''Old Boston: An American Historical Romance'', 1888, p. 126) The 1772 "Massacre Day of Oration" by [[Joseph Warren]] was originally titled ''An Oration Delivered March 5th, 1772. At the Request of the Inhabitants of the Town of Boston; to Commemorate the Bloody Tragedy of the Fifth of March, 1770''.

Questionable list entries also include such names for pre-1930s events which were coined only significantly later.

|The Dominican military used machetes to brutally slash people to death and decapitate thousands of [[Afro-Haitians|black Haitians]]; they also took people to the port of Montecristi, where thousands of Haitians were thrown into the ocean to drown with their hands and feet bound.

Survivors who managed to cross the border and return to [[Haiti]] told stories of family members being hacked with machetes and strangled by the soldiers, and children dashed against rocks and tree trunks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galván|first1=Javier A.|title=Latin American Dictators of the 20th Century: The Lives and Regimes of 15 Rulers|date=2012|publisher=McFarland|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|During the 1990s, many [[Algerian Civil War#Village massacres|large-scale massacres of villagers]] in Algeria were perpetrated by groups attacking villages at night and cutting the throats of the inhabitants. The [[Armed Islamic Group]] (GIA) has avowed its responsibility for many of them. The massacres peaked in 1997 (with a smaller peak in 1994). According to a few reports former Algerian army officer, Habib Souaidia testified to his government's involvement in the massacres.

In fact, survivors who openly accuse the army for its failure to intervene also expressed no doubt about the identity of the killers, pointing to the Islamist guerrillas (e.g. Tuquoi 1997). Moreover, some of the troubling aspects of this story can be explained without reference to an army conspiracy. For example, in civil wars prisoners tend to be killed on the spot rather than taken prisoner (Laqueur 1998).11 Militiamen, the most likely to capture guerrillas, have openly stated that they took no prisoners (AI 1997b: 17). Journalists working in the field have found credible testimonies in support of the thesis that most massacres are organized by the rebels (Leclère 1997; Tuquoi 1997 among others). European foreign ministries believe that it is Islamist guerrillas who are responsible for the massacres (Observer 9 February 1998). Although, it is impossible to know the full truth at this point (see Charef 1998), the assumption that many massacres were committed by the Islamist guerrillas seems plausible and is widely adopted by area experts (Addi 1998: 44) and other authors (Smith 1998: 27). Likewise, the reluctance of the army to intervene and stop some of these massacres is also beyond doubt."&lt;/ref&gt;

|A group of 100 armed men, alleged to include police and private militia led by Andal Ampatuan, Jr., stopped a convoy of five cars transporting Genalyn Tiamzon-Mangudadatu, the wife of [[Esmael Mangudadatu]], who is running for provincial governor in the [[Philippine general election, 2010|2010 Philippine elections]]. She was en route to the town of [[Shariff Aguak, Maguindanao|Shariff Aguak]] to file a certificate of candidacy for her husband, accompanied by his sisters, other supporters, and members of the press. The attackers kidnapped and later killed all members of the Mangudadatu group; reports state that women in the group were raped before being killed.

'''Manx literature''' is literature in the [[Manx language]].

==History==
The earliest datable text in Manx (preserved in 18th century [[manuscript]]s), a poetic history of the [[Isle of Man]] from the introduction of [[Christianity]], dates to the 16th century at the latest.

Christianity has been an overwhelming influence on Manx literature. Religious literature was common, but surviving secular writing much rarer. The New Testament was first published in 1767.  The [[Book of Common Prayer]] and [[Bible]] were translated into Manx and published in 1610 and again in 1765. The first Manx Bible was printed between 1771 and 1775 and is the source and standard for modern Manx [[orthography]]. It was a collective translation undertaken by most the Manx clergy under the editorship of Philip Moore. Further editions followed in 1777 and a revised edition by the British and Foreign Bible Society 1819. A tradition of {{lang|gv|carvals}}, religious songs or [[Carol (music)|carols]], developed, probably with its roots in the pre-Reformation period. Until the 18th century, the authors of {{lang|gv|carvals}} were generally clergy, but in the 19th century new words would be put to popular tunes for use in churches and chapels.

The first printed work in Manx, {{lang|gv|Coyrle Sodjeh}}, dates from 1707: a translation of a Prayer Book [[catechism]] in English by [[Thomas Wilson (bishop)|Bishop Thomas Wilson]].

''Pargys Caillit'' was an abridged Manx version of [[Paradise Lost]] by [[John Milton]] published in 1796 by [[Thomas Christian]], vicar of Marown 1780-1799.

[[Edward Faragher]], ({{lang|gv|Neddy Beg Hom Ruy}}, 1831–1908) of [[Cregneash]] has been considered the last important native writer of Manx. From the age of 26, he wrote poetry, often on religious subjects, some of which were printed in the ''Mona's Herald'' and the ''Cork Eagle''. Some of his stories are reminiscences of his life as a fisherman, and in 1901 {{lang|gv|Skeealyn Aesop}}, translations of selected [[Aesop]]'s Fables,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Skeealyn ‘sy Ghailck
| last = Faragher
| first = Edward
 | publisher = Yn Çheshaght Ghailckagh
 | origyear = 1948
 | year = 1973
 | chapter = Editorial note (Basil Megaw, director of the Manx Museum)
}}&lt;/ref&gt; was published.

A large number of traditional Manx language songs and ballads were collected by the antiquarian and historian [[Arthur William Moore|A.W. Moore]] which he published in ''Manx Carols'' (1891) and ''Manx Ballads and Music'' (1896).

With the [[Language revival|revival]] of Manx, new literature has appeared, including {{lang|gv|Contoyryssyn Ealish ayns Cheer ny Yindyssyn}} a Manx translation of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland|Alice in Wonderland]]'' by [[Brian Stowell]], published in 1990.  In March 2006 the first full-length Manx novel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iomonline.co.im/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1143&amp;ArticleID=1397570 ''Isle of Man Today'' article on {{lang|gv|Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley}}] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826083707/http://www.iomonline.co.im/ViewArticle2.aspx?SectionID=1143&amp;ArticleID=1397570 |date=2006-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published: {{lang|gv|Dunveryssyn yn Tooder-Folley}} (''The Vampire Murders''), also by Brian Stowell.

The '''Marion Cemetery Receiving Vault''' is a funerary structure in the main cemetery of [[Marion, Ohio|Marion]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]].  Constructed in the 1870s, this [[receiving vault]] originally fulfilled the normal purposes of such structures, but it gained prominence as the semipermanent resting place of Marion's most prominent citizen, U.S. President [[Warren G. Harding]].

==Construction==
The vault is a [[limestone]] structure with a slate roof; it rests on a concrete [[foundation (engineering)|foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OHC NRHP|95001415|Marion Cemetery Receiving Vault}}, [[Ohio Historical Society]], 2007.  Accessed 2013-09-24.&lt;/ref&gt;  Plans to build it were formulated as early as 1873, when the [[cemetery association]] voted to make plans for one; funds were insufficient, so the association decided not to build until sufficient money had become available.  Six years later, the cemetery's trustees decided to build a vault, and to design it, they hired [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] architect D.W. Giffs.&lt;ref name=sites&gt;[http://www.marionohiocemetery.com/Historical%20Sites.htm MCA], Marion Cemetery Association, 2009.  Accessed 2013-09-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the association's reasons for building the vault was the desire to retard a modern form of [[grave robbery]]: the practice of [[body snatching]] was still relatively common, and the association wished to provide a place where bodies could be laid without risk of theft until they had [[Decomposition|decomposed]] so much that they would be useless to body snatchers.  Accordingly, the final design for the vault included iron gates with secure locks.  Other elements of the design included a [[Vault (architecture)|double-arched ceiling]], the creation of [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and related systems, and the placement of fine [[marble]] and [[carpet]] to beautify the structure and retard the harshness of death for decedents' family members at funerals.&lt;ref name=sites /&gt;  The entire structure is built into a hillside.&lt;ref&gt;"Harding Rests in Ivy-Clad Vault in Marion Cemetery".  ''[[The Day (New London)|The Day]]'', 1923-08-11: 1/13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardings==
[[Warren G. Harding|Warren Gamaliel Harding]] died in early August 1923 while in office as [[President of the United States]].  The suddenness of his death produced chaos even on a personal level, as funeral services and a burial location must be worked out suddenly, and [[Florence Harding|Mrs. Harding]] was forced to return to Washington, D.C. to wrap up her affairs and to move her possessions out of the White House in order to permit its new occupants, [[Calvin Coolidge|President]] and [[Grace Coolidge|Mrs.]] Coolidge, to move in.  Accordingly, no permanent burial place was employed immediately after his death, and funeral services were held at the Receiving Vault:&lt;ref&gt;"Mrs. Harding Arrives Back in Washington".  ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'' 1923-08-11, 1/2.&lt;/ref&gt; Harding's family already owned burial plots in the cemetery, but a grander destination was planned for the deceased chief executive; in the meantime, soldiers from [[Fort Hayes]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] guarded the vault for six months.&lt;ref&gt;"Harding Laid to Final Rest in Home Town", ''Polk County ''[North Carolina]'' News'', 1923-08-16: 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  As plans were being made for the construction of a [[Harding Tomb|permanent presidential tomb]] elsewhere in the city, his body remained in the vault, being joined by Mrs. Harding's body after her death in 1924.  The two continued to wait until the practical completion of the memorial in 1927; they were then moved to their permanent burial sites inside the memorial, although four more years passed before it was formally dedicated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hardinghome.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=36&amp;Itemid=64 The Harding Memorial], [[Harding Home]], 2010.  Accessed 2013-09-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==
Two weeks before Christmas 1995, the Receiving Vault was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]], qualifying both because of its architecture and because of the place it had played in the events of 1923.  It is one of two National Register-listed sites in Marion's city cemetery — the [[Soldiers' and Sailors' Memorial Chapel|chapel]] had been listed nine months before — and one of fourteen such locations throughout [[Marion County, Ohio|Marion County]].  Among these fourteen are Harding's permanent tomb and [[Harding Home|his home]] on Marion's east side.&lt;ref name=nris /&gt;

'''Medieval theatre''' refers to [[theatre|theatrical performance]] in the period between the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]] in the 5th century A.D. and the beginning of the [[Renaissance]] in approximately the 15th century A.D. Medieval Theatre covers all drama produced in Europe over that thousand-year period and refers to a variety of genres, including [[liturgical drama]], [[mystery plays]], [[morality plays]], [[farce]]s and [[masque]]s. Beginning with [[Hrosvitha]] of Gandersheim in the 10th century, Medieval drama was for the most part very religious and moral in its themes, staging and traditions. The most famous examples of Medieval plays are the English cycle dramas, the [[York Mystery Plays]], the [[Chester Mystery Plays]], the [[Wakefield Mystery Plays]] and the [[N-Town Plays]], as well as the [[morality play]], ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]''. One of the earliest surviving secular plays in English is ''[[The Interlude of the Student and the Girl]]'' (c. 1300).

Due to a lack of surviving records and texts, a low literacy rate of the general population, and the opposition of the clergy to some types of performance, there are few surviving sources on Medieval drama of the [[Early Middle Ages|Early]] and [[High Middle Ages|High]] Medieval periods. However, by the [[Late Middle Ages|late]] period, [[drama]] and [[theatre]] began to become more secularized and a larger number of records survive documenting [[play (theatre)|plays]] and performances.

==Early Medieval theatre==
[[File:Roswitha of Gandersheim.jpg|left|200px|thumb|[[Hrosvitha]] of Gandersheim, the first dramatist of the post-classical era.]]
Faced with the problem of explaining a new religion to a largely illiterate population, churches in the [[Early Middle Ages]] began staging dramatized versions of particular biblical events on specific days of the year. These dramatizations were included in order to vivify annual celebrations.&lt;ref name="Brockett_76"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 76)&lt;/ref&gt; Symbolic objects and actions ([[vestments]], [[altar]]s, [[censer]]s, and [[pantomime]] performed by priests) recalled the events which Christian ritual celebrates. These were extensive sets of visual signs that could be used to communicate with a largely illiterate audience. These performances developed into [[liturgical drama]]s, the earliest of which is the ''Whom do you Seek (Quem-Quaeritis)'' Easter trope, dating from ca. 925.&lt;ref name="Brockett_76"/&gt; Liturgical drama was sung responsively by two groups and did not involve actors impersonating characters. However, sometime between 965 and 975, [[Æthelwold of Winchester]] composed the ''Regularis Concordia (Monastic Agreement)'' which contains a playlet complete with directions for performance.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 77)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transition from Rome, 500-900 A.D.==
As the [[Western Roman Empire]] fell into severe decay through the 4th and 5th centuries A.D., the seat of Roman power shifted to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]], later called the [[Byzantine Empire]]. While surviving evidence about Byzantine theatre is slight, existing records show that [[mime]], [[pantomime]], scenes or recitations from [[tragedy|tragedies]] and [[comedy|comedies]], [[dance]]s, and other entertainments were very popular. Constantinople had two theatres that were in use as late as the 5th century A.D. However, the true importance of the Byzantines in theatrical history is their preservation of many classical Greek texts and the compilation of a massive encyclopedia called the [[Suda]], from which is derived a large amount of contemporary information on Greek theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 70)&lt;/ref&gt; In the 6th century, the Emperor [[Justinian]] finally closed down all theatres for good.

According to the [[binary opposition|binary]] thinking of the Church's early followers, everything that did not belong to [[God]] belonged to the [[Devil]]; thus all non-Christian gods and [[Paganism|religions]] were [[satanism|satanic]]. Efforts were made in many countries through this period to not only convert [[Jews]] and [[paganism|pagans]] but to destroy pre-Christian institutions and influences. Works of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] literature were burnt, the thousand-year-old [[Platonic Academy]] was closed, the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]] were banned and all theatres were shut down. The theatre itself was viewed as a diabolical threat to [[Christianity]] because of its continued popularity in [[Rome]] even among new converts. Church fathers such as [[Tatian]], [[Tertullian]] and [[Augustine]] characterized the stage as an instrument in the Devil's fiendish plot to corrupt men's souls, while [[acting]] was considered [[sin]]ful because of its cruel mockery of God's creation.&lt;ref name="Wise_Walker,184"&gt;Wise and Walker (2003, 184)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under these influences, the [[Christian Church|church]] set about trying to suppress theatrical spectacles by passing laws prohibiting and excluding [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[actors]]. They were forbidden to have contact with Christian women, own [[slavery|slaves]], or wear [[gold]]. They were officially [[excommunicated]], denied the [[sacraments]], including [[marriage]] and [[burial]], and were defamed and debased throughout [[Europe]]. For many centuries thereafter, clerics were cautioned to not allow these suddenly homeless, travelling actors to perform in their jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Wise_Walker,184"/&gt;

From the 5th century, [[Western Europe]] was plunged into a period of general disorder that lasted (with a brief period of stability under the [[Carolingian Empire]] in the 9th century) until the 10th century A.D. As such, most organized theatrical activities disappeared in [[Western Europe]]. While it seems that small nomadic bands traveled around Europe throughout the period, performing wherever they could find an audience, there is no evidence that they produced anything but crude scenes .&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 75)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hrosvitha]] (c.935-973), an aristocratic canoness and historian in northern [[Germany]], wrote six plays modeled on [[Terence]]'s comedies but using religious subjects in the 10th century A.D. Terence's comedies had long been used in [[monastery]] schools as examples of spoken [[Latin]] but are full of clever, alluring [[courtesans]] and ordinary human pursuits such as [[sex]], [[love]] and [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;McAlister, Linda. "Hypatia's Daughters: 1500 Years of Women Philosophers." Hypatia Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; In order to preempt criticism from the [[Christian Church|church]], Hrosvitha prefaced her collection by stating that her moral purpose to save Christians from the guilt they must feel when reading Classical literature. Her declared solution was to imitate the "laudable" deeds of women in Terence's plays and discard the "shameless" ones.&lt;ref&gt;Wise and Walker (2003, 190)&lt;/ref&gt; These six plays are the first known plays composed by a female dramatist and the first identifiable Western dramatic works of the post-Classical era.&lt;ref name="Brockett_Hildy,77"/&gt; They were first published in 1501 and had considerable influence on religious and didactic plays of the sixteenth century. Hrosvitha was followed by [[Hildegard of Bingen]] (d. 1179), a [[Benedictine]] abbess, who wrote a [[Latin]] [[music]]al drama called ''Ordo Virtutum'' in 1155.

The anonymous pagan play ''[[Querolus]]'', written c.420, was adapted in the 12th century by Vitalis of Blois.  Other secular Latin plays were also written in the 12th century, mainly in France but also in England (''[[Babio]]'').  There certainly existed some other performances that were not fully fledged theatre; they may have been carryovers from the original pagan cultures (as is known from records written by the clergy disapproving of such festivals). It is also known that mimes, minstrels, bards, storytellers, and jugglers traveled in search of new audiences and financial support. Not much is known about these performers' repertoire and few written texts survive. One of the most famous of the secular plays is the musical ''[[Jeu de Robin et Marion|Le Jeu de Robin et Marion]]'', written by [[Adam de la Halle]] in the 13th century, which is fully laid out in the original manuscript with lines, musical notation, and illuminations in the margins depicting the actors in motion.  Adam also wrote another secular play, ''Jeu de la Fueillee'' in [[Arras]], a French town in which theatre was thriving in the late 12th and 13th centuries. One play surviving from Arras, is ''Jeu de saint Nicolas'' by [[Jean Bodel]] (c.1200).

==High and Late Medieval theatre==
[[File:Castle of Perseverance staging.jpg|thumb|right|305px|Stage drawing from 15th-century [[vernacular]] [[morality play]] ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' (as found in the [[Macro Manuscript]]).]]
As the [[Viking]] invasions ceased in the middle of the 11th century A.D., [[liturgical drama]] had spread from [[Russia]] to [[Scandinavia]] to [[Italy]]. Only in [[Al-Andalus|Muslim-occupied Spain]] were liturgical dramas not presented at all. Despite the large number of liturgical dramas that have survived from the period, many churches would have only performed one or two per year and a larger number never performed any at all.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 78)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Feast of Fools]] was especially important in the development of comedy. The festival inverted the status of the lesser clergy and allowed them to ridicule their superiors and the routine of church life. Sometimes plays were staged as part of the occasion and a certain amount of [[burlesque]] and [[comedy]] may have entered the liturgical drama as a result of its influence.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 80).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Performance of religious plays outside of the church began sometime in the 12th century through a traditionally accepted process of merging shorter liturgical dramas into longer plays which were then translated into [[vernacular]] and performed by laymen and thus accessible to a wider segment of society inclusive of the working class. The use of vernacular enabled drama to be understood and enjoyed by a larger audience.  ''The Mystery of Adam'' (1150) gives credence to this theory as its detailed stage direction suggest that it was staged outdoors. A number of other plays from the period survive, including ''La Seinte Resurrection'' ([[Normans|Norman]]), ''The Play of the Magi Kings'' ([[Spain|Spanish]]), and ''Sponsus'' ([[France|French]]).

Economic and political changes in the [[High Middle Ages]] led to the formation of  [[guilds]] and the growth of towns, and this would lead to significant changes for theatre starting in this time and continuing into in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Trade guilds began to perform plays, usually religiously based, and often dealing with a biblical story that referenced their profession. For instance, a baker's guild would perform a reenactment of the [[Last Supper]].&lt;ref&gt;A History of English literature for Students, by Robert Huntington Fletcher, 1916: pp. 85-88&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[British Isles]], plays were produced in some 127 different towns during the Middle Ages. These vernacular "[[mystery plays]]" were written in cycles of a large number of plays: [[York Mystery Plays|York]] (48 plays), [[Chester Mystery Plays|Chester]] (24), [[Wakefield Mystery Plays|Wakefield]] (32) and [[N-Town Plays|Unknown]] (42). A larger number of plays survive from [[France]] and [[Germany]] in this period and some type of religious dramas were performed in nearly every European country in the [[Late Middle Ages]]. Many of these plays contained [[comedy]], [[devil]]s, [[villain]]s and [[clown]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 86)&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of actors in these plays were drawn from the local population. For example, at [[Valenciennes]] in 1547, more than 100 roles were assigned to 72 actors.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 95)&lt;/ref&gt; Plays were staged on [[pageant wagon]] stages, which were platforms mounted on wheels used to move scenery. Often providing their own costumes, amateur performers in England were exclusively male, but other countries had female performers. The platform stage, which was an unidentified space and not a specific locale, allowed for abrupt changes in location.

[[Morality plays]] emerged as a distinct dramatic form around 1400 and flourished until 1550. ''[[The Castle of Perseverance]]'' which depicts [[Human|mankind]]'s progress from birth to death. Though ''[[Everyman (play)|Everyman]]'' may possibly be the best known of this genre, it is atypical in many ways. Everyman receives [[Death]]'s summons, struggles to escape and finally resigns himself to necessity. Along the way, he is deserted by [[Kinship|Kindred]], [[Good (economics)|Goods]], and [[Fellow]]ship - only [[Good works|Good Deeds]] goes with him to the grave.

Secular drama was also staged throughout the Middle Ages, the earliest of which is ''The Play of the Greenwood'' by [[Adam de la Halle]] in 1276. It contains satirical scenes and [[Folklore|folk]] material such as [[faeries]] and other supernatural occurrences. [[Farce]]s also rose dramatically in popularity after the 13th century. The majority of these plays come from [[France]] and [[Germany]] and are similar in tone and form, emphasizing [[sex]] and bodily excretions.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 96)&lt;/ref&gt; The best known playwright of farces is [[Hans Sachs]] (1494–1576) who wrote 198 dramatic works. In England, ''[[The Second Shepherds' Play]]'' of the ''[[Wakefield Cycle]]'' is the best known early farce. However, farce did not appear independently in England until the 16th century with the work of [[John Heywood]] (1497–1580).

A significant forerunner of the development of [[Elizabethan]] drama was the [[Chamber of rhetoric|Chambers of Rhetoric]] in the [[Low Countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 99)&lt;/ref&gt; These societies were concerned with [[poetry]], [[music]] and [[drama]] and held contests to see which society could compose the best drama in relation to a question posed.

At the end of the [[Late Middle Ages]], professional actors began to appear in [[England]] and [[Europe]]. [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] and [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] both maintained small companies of professional actors. Their plays were performed in the [[great hall]] of a nobleman's residence, often with a raised platform at one end for the audience and a "screen" at the other for the actors. Also important were [[Mummers Play|Mummers' plays]], performed during the [[Christmas]] season, and court [[masque]]s. These masques were especially popular during the reign of [[Henry VIII]] who had a house of revels built and an [[Master of the Revels|office of revels]] established in 1545.&lt;ref&gt;Brockett and Hildy (2003, 101-103)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staging==
[[File:Valenciennes-stage-bnf-ms-fr-12536-f1v-2.jpg|right|thumb|320px|The [[Valenciennes]] [[Passion Play]]]]
Depending on the area of the performances, the plays were performed in the middle of the street, on [[pageant wagon]]s in the streets of great cities (this was inconvenient for the actors because the small stage size made stage movement impossible), in the halls of [[nobility]], or [[in the round]] in amphitheatres, as suggested by current archaeology in Cornwall and the southwest of England. The most detailed illustration of a mystery play stage design is the frontispiece to [[Hubert Cailleau]]'s ''The Passion and Resurrection of the Savior''. All medieval stage production was temporary and expected to be removed upon the completion of the performances. Actors, predominantly male, typically wore long, dark robes. Medieval plays such as the Wakefield cycle, or the Digby Magdalene featured lively interplay between  two distinct areas, the wider spaces in front of the raised staging areas, and the elevated areas themselves (called, respectively, the locus and the platea).&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, ''Cambridge Introduction to Early English Theatre'' (Cambridge: CUP, 2006), pp4-16.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically too, actors would move between these locations in order to suggest scene changes, rather than remain stationary and have the scene change around them as is typically done in modern theatres.
 
Scenery, stage machinery and costumes enabled a more realistic depiction of the message the play was trying to promote. Whether on a fixed stage, with more opportunity for spectacle, or on a pageant wagon that moved through the streets, the ornate details and tricks attributed to these productions enhanced the audience’s experience of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, J.L.,"The English Stage: A History of Drama and Performance"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes during Late Middle Ages==
Changing political and economic factors greatly affected theatre at the end of the Middle Ages and beginning of the [[Modern Era]]. First, the Protestant Reformation targeted the theatre, especially in England, in an effort to stamp out allegiance to Rome. In [[Wakefield]], for example, the local mystery cycle text shows signs of Protestant editing, with references to the [[pope]] crossed out and two plays completely eliminated because they were too Catholic. However, it was not just the Protestants who attacked the theatre of the time. The [[Council of Trent]] banned religious plays in an attempt to rein in the extrabiblical material that the Protestants frequently lampooned.

A revival of interest in [[culture of ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] and [[culture of Greece|Greek culture]] changed the tastes of the learned classes in the performing arts. [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[theatre of ancient Rome|Roman]] plays were performed and new plays were written that were heavily influenced by the classical style. This led to the creation of [[Commedia dell'arte]] and influenced [[History of theatre#Renaissance theatre|Renaissance theatre]].

A change of patronage also caused drastic changes to the theatre. In England the monarch and nobility started to support professional theatre troupes (including [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] and [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]), which catered to their upper class patrons' tastes.

Finally, the construction of permanent theaters, such as [[The Theatre]] signaled a major turning point. Permanent theaters allowed for more sophisticated staging and storytelling. 

==Contributions to modern theatre==

Many components of theatre that developed during the Middle Ages continue to be incorporated in productions around the world to this day, such as use of the vernacular, spectacle, stage direction and the use of farce. Performances that were spoken in the vernacular provided opportunities for larger audiences, who included members of lower socio-economic status, who would have otherwise been excluded from understanding the performances.&lt;ref&gt;Symes, Carol. ''A Common Stage:  Theatre and Public Life in Medieval Arras.'' Cornell University Press, 10-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval theatre differed from the classical theatre for it emphasized spectacle. In addition, it presented various actions on stage in time and space and presented a combination of the sublime with detailed realism. Approximately 1400 A.D., the dramas were performed with spectacle; no longer dependent exclusively on the spoken word, but incorporating music, dance, costume and set design.  The spectacle of the later Medieval theatre made it necessary to have detailed stage directions.  A sample of documented staging drawings and directions remain from the 15th-century morality play ''The Castle of Perseverance''.  The evolution to the dependence on detailed stage direction made possible the great Shakespearean stage.&lt;ref&gt;Styan, J.L. 1996. "The English Stage: A History of Drama and Performance." Cambridge University Press,1-45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern productions of Medieval theatre==
===Mummers plays===
Mummers plays are still performed regularly throughout the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannant (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; What relation they may bear to their medieval antecedents is unknown. The surviving texts of this oral tradition were recorded in the 18th century, at a time when the [[industrial revolution]] began to break up the rural communities in which the plays were performed.

===Mystery plays===
Mystery Plays are still produced regularly throughout the [[United Kingdom]]. The local cycles were revived in both [[York]] and [[Chester]] in 1951 as part of the [[Festival of Britain]], and are still performed by the local guilds.&lt;ref&gt;Rogerson, Margaret. [http://www.yorkmysteryplays.co.uk/the-plays-and-the-guilds/ The Plays and the Guilds], ''York Mystery Plays''&lt;/ref&gt; The N-Town cycle was revived in 1978 as the [[Lincoln mystery plays]],
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Normington|first=Katie |title=Modern mysteries: contemporary productions of medieval English cycle dramas|publisher=Boydell and Brewer|location=Melton, Suffolk, England|date=October 2007|isbn=978-1-84384-128-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1994 the [[Lichfield]] Mysteries were inaugurated (now the biggest community theatre event in the United Kingdom).&lt;ref name=lichmyst&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.lichfieldmysteries.co.uk/ | title = Lichfield Mysteries: Home Page| accessdate = 28 January 2011| publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] commissioned [[Tony Harrison]] to create ''[[The Mysteries (play)|The Mysteries]]'', a re-working of the [[Wakefield Cycle]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dodsworth|first=Martin|date=9 January 1986|title=A poet in the land of as if|journal=[[The Guardian]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revived in 1985 (whereupon the production was filmed for [[Channel 4|Channel 4 Television]]), and again as a part of the theatre's millennium celebration in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Harrison |first=Tony |authorlink= |title=The Mysteries |year=1985 |publisher=Faber |location=London |isbn=0-571-13790-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The productions won [[Bill Bryden]] the "Best Director" title in both the [[Evening Standard Awards|Evening Standard Theatre Awards]] and the [[Olivier Awards]] for 1985, the year the three plays first appeared together in performance at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]. An adaptation of Harrison's play was staged at [[Shakespeare's Globe]] in 2011 as ''The Globe Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe. [http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/discovery-space/previous-productions/the-globe-mysteries The Globe Mysteries]. 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2001, the Isango Ensemble produced an African version of the Chester Cycle at the [[Garrick Theatre]] in London as ''The Mysteries – Yiimimangaliso'', performing in a combination of the [[Xhosa language]], the [[Zulu language]], English, [[Latin]] and [[Afrikaans]]. They revived an adapted version of the production at Shakespeare's Globe in 2015 as ''The Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare's Globe. [http://www.shakespearesglobe.com/theatre/whats-on/concerts-by-candlelight/isango-ensemble-mysteries The Isango Ensemble Mysteries] 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, two mystery plays (one focusing on the Creation and the other on the Passion) were performed at Canterbury Cathedral, with actor [[Edward Woodward]] in the role of God. The large cast also included [[Daniel MacPherson]], [[Thomas James Longley]] and [[Joseph McManners]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/kent/3535002.stm Revival of Medieval Mystery Plays]. Thursday, 5 August, 2004,&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morality plays===
The first modern stage production of ''[[Everyman (modern play)|Everyman]]'' did not appear until July 1901, when The [[Elizabethan Stage Society]] of [[William Poel]] gave three outdoor performances at the [[Charterhouse Square|Charterhouse]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Kuehler, Stephen G., (2008), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tt1iRQrIhkYC Concealing God: The "Everyman" revival, 1901–1903],'' Tufts University (PhD. thesis), 104 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Poel then partnered with British actor [[Ben Greet]] to produce the play throughout Britain, with runs on the American [[Broadway theatre|Broadway stage]] from 1902 to 1918,&lt;ref&gt;{{IBDB show|id=3393|title=Everyman (Broadway play)}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concurrent tours throughout North America. These productions differed from past performances in that women were cast in the title role, rather than men. Film adaptations of the 1901 version of the play appeared in 1913 and 1914, with the 1913 film being presented with an early color two-process pioneered by [[Kinemacolor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1487900}} – 1913 film version.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|2466812}} – 1914 film version.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-known version of the play is ''[[Jedermann (play)|Jedermann]]'' by the [[Austria]]n playwright [[Hugo von Hofmannsthal]], which has been performed annually at the [[Salzburg Festival]] since 1920.{{sfn|Banham|1998|page=491}} The Hofmannsthal play was made into [[Jedermann (film)|a film of the same title]] in 1961. [[Frederick Franck]] published a modernised version of the tale entitled "Everyone", drawing on Buddhist influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sitm.info/history/Groningen/mateer.htm|title=Everyman’s God|work=sitm.info}}&lt;/ref&gt; A direct-to-video movie version of ''Everyman'' was made in 2002, directed by John Farrell, which updated the setting to the early 21st century, including Death as a businessman in dark glasses with a briefcase, and Goods being played by a talking personal computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0360551/|title=Everyman (2002)|date=17 July 2002|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modernized adaptation by [[Carol Ann Duffy]], the Poet Laureate, with [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]] in the title role, was performed at the [[National Theatre (UK)]] from April to July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b05spk34|title=BBC Radio 4 - Saturday Review, Everyman, Far from the Madding Crowd, Empire, Anne Enright, Christopher Williams|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miracle plays===
Performances of plays outside of churches are frequent during the Christmas season with reenactments of the Nativity, and many Christian schools and Sunday school groups regularly performs scenes from the bible with children. The reenactment of the Passion of Christ is performed throughout the world in the late Lenten season.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10410">The '''Melissa King assault case''' was an incident in [[Cleveland, Ohio]] when personal animosity between two girls led to an alleged attack by eighteen black and Hispanic youths aged between eight and fifteen on a thirteen-year-old white girl named Melissa King. Of the eighteen children, six were convicted. Although there were allegations that this was part of a customary "Beat up a White Kid" day, both prosecutors and defense lawyers agreed that the incident arose from a vendetta between two girls.

==2003 case==
On May 1, 2003, school officials and students at Wilbur Wright Middle School separately notified police that "a large fight" was planned for after school near the intersection of Almira Avenue and West 110th street in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="bigotry"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Regina Brett]] |date=June 18, 2003 |newspaper=[[The Plain Dealer]] |title=All bigotry is equally bad |department=Metro |page=B1 |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/plaindealer/access/348842511.html?dids=348842511:348842511&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jun+18%2C+2003&amp;author=REGINA+BRETT&amp;pub=The+Plain+Dealer&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=B.1&amp;desc=All+bigotry+is+equally+bad |accessdate=2007-05-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001000037/https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/plaindealer/access/348842511.html?dids=348842511%3A348842511&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS%3AFT&amp;date=Jun%2B18%2C%2B2003&amp;author=REGINA%2BBRETT&amp;pub=The%2BPlain%2BDealer&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=B.1&amp;desc=All%2Bbigotry%2Bis%2Bequally%2Bbad |archivedate=October 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="special"&gt;Miller, Steve.

Section: Forum; Page B9.&lt;/ref&gt; However, defense lawyers and prosecutors both agreed that the attack sprang from a personal vendetta between Melissa and one girl. This girl testified that Melissa had overheard her talking to a school counselor after she was sexually abused and attempted suicide, and claimed Melissa had spread gossip about this.{{cn|date=January 2016}} Within a few days of the attack, Wilbur Wright school responded by suspending five of the eighteen attackers from school for ten days.&lt;ref name="annual"/&gt;

==2003 fall-out==
When the attack was publicized a day later in ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'', more than 100 readers contacted the newspaper to confirm that the May Day ritual had been alive and well for years.&lt;ref name="violence"&gt;Brett, Regina. (June 20, 2003) ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' "May Day violence far from myth." Section: Metro; Page B1.&lt;/ref&gt; Many in their 20s recalled staying home sick from school on May Day in the 1990s or hurrying home to avoid getting hurt.&lt;ref name="violence"/&gt; Some teachers did not give homework that day because they knew attendance would be down.&lt;ref name="violence"/&gt; Although annual assaults on white children by minorities is rooted in certain public schools on Cleveland's West Side,&lt;ref name="annual"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Jim. (September 29, 2003) ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' "Prosecutors say race relations not on trial in 'May Day' case." Section: National; Page A1.&lt;/ref&gt; the event may have multiple origins. For example, one man recalled that when he served in the military, many of his friends reported, participated in, or became victims of this annual ritual.&lt;ref name="violence"/&gt; 

In June 2003, the juvenile justice unit of the [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]] prosecutor's office filed [[Assault#American jurisprudence|felonious assault]] and [[riot|aggravated riot]] [[juvenile court|juvenile charges]] against the eighteen attackers.&lt;ref name="teenage"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pitts Jr., Leonard. (June 21, 2003) ''[[Charleston Gazette]]'' "Racism occurs because America is racist." Section: Editorial; Page 4A.&lt;/ref&gt; Noting that the attack was some sort of May Day ritual with the "focus to beat up a white kid," the juvenile justice unit also charged the attackers with ethnic intimidation—a [[hate-crimes]] law.&lt;ref name="teenage"/&gt; In July, Cuyahoga County Juvenile Court Judge Joseph F. Russo entered not guilty pleas and appointed lawyers for the youth, and issued arrest warrants for the four who failed to attend the court hearing.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' (July 13, 2003) "May Day beating case in court." Section: Metro; Page B3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Judge Russo ended the trial on October 2003 with six convictions.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols, Jim. (October 21, 2003) ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' "Instigator apologizes for attack." Section: Metro; Page B4.&lt;/ref&gt; These six individuals admitted aggravated rioting, and two of those admitted to felonious assault. Judge Russo said that testimony from prosecution witnesses including Melissa was too conflicting, inconsistent and sometimes obviously false to prove the culpability of four defendants beyond reasonable doubt.{{cn|date=January 2016}} However he concluded that "based on the evidence I've heard, May Day is reality and the evidence was overwhelming that this was an attack based on May Day and that the victim was chosen because she was white."&lt;ref name="true"/&gt; In drawing his conclusion, Judge Russo suggested that white students in Cleveland's integrated public schools have reason to fear assaults by minorities in so-called May Day attacks every May 1.&lt;ref name="true"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brett, Regina. (October 8, 2003) ''[[The Plain Dealer]]'' "May Day ritual accepted as fact." Section: Metro; Page B1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nigel Bathurst Hankin''' was brought up by his grandmother in [[Bexhill-on-Sea|Bexhill, Sussex]]. He was sent to Burma during late [[World War II]] but the war ended around the time he reached Bombay, India (now [[Mumbai, India]]). He liked the bustle of the [[South Asia|Indian Subcontinent]] ([[Delhi, India]] in particular) and consequently he lived there for the rest of his life.

One of his early formative experiences was watching the crowds at the funeral for [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] while he still wore the uniform of the newly defunct [[British Raj]] just after the formal [[Partition of India]]. His subsequent eclectic activities in India included running a mobile cinema. Later he worked for the [[List of High Commissioners from the United Kingdom to India|British High Commission]] and during his tenure there he helped newcomers to India interpret the local mores and lingo. In 1992 he formally compiled his know-how into the book ""[[Hanklyn-Janklin]]"" which became well known to locals and foreigners to the [[South Asia|Subcontinent]] alike.  This cross cultural dictionary is what he is most well known for and many critics compare it to the 19th Century book [[Hobson-Jobson]].{{or|date=August 2018}}

Hankin never married, had no children and kept English traits such as eating an "English Breakfast" that included cornflakes. He also gave tours of Delhi which were highly sought after but hard to book. They featured sights such as hidden bazaars and Hankin's walk and talk through [[Coronation Park, Delhi|Coronation Park]]. His brother and other relatives occasionally visited him in India before his death at age 87.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Roland Watson Political Editor 7 December 2011 12:01AM |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article3118067.ece |title=The Times &amp;#124; UK News, World News and Opinion |publisher=Timesonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-12-07 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1574988/Nigel-Hankin.html |title=Nigel Hankin |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2008-01-09|accessdate=2011-12-07 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E2saAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=inauthor:%22Nigel+B.+Hankin%22&amp;dq=inauthor:%22Nigel+B.+Hankin%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BgUfTZ_EMcT6lweWlrC4DA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAA |title=Hanklyn-janklin: a stranger's rumble ... - Nigel B.

"'''Operation Time'''" is the eighth episode of ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]'', a 1960s British [[Supermarionation]] television series created by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]] and produced by their company [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21 Productions]]. Written by Richard Conway and Stephen J. Mattick and directed by [[Ken Turner (director)|Ken Turner]], it was first broadcast on 17 November 1967 on [[ATV Midlands]].

In this episode, the [[Mysteron]]s threaten to "kill time", confusing Spectrum until the target is found to be a military general who is about to undergo pioneering [[brain surgery]].

"Operation Time" reveals two natural weaknesses in Mysteron reconstructions that are further explored in "[[Spectrum Strikes Back]]".

==Plot==
When the [[Mysteron]]s (voiced by [[Donald Gray]]) confusingly threaten to "kill time", [[Colonel White]] (voiced by Donald Gray) dispatches senior Spectrum personnel to major cities to watch for potential targets. No promising intelligence surfaces until [[Captain Magenta]] (voiced by [[Gary Files]]) discovers that the Commander of Western Region World Defence, General J.F. Tiempo – whose surname means "time" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] – is at a clinic near London, where he is soon to undergo brain surgery. Believing that Tiempo's life is in danger, White has him flown to Cloudbase with his surgeon, Dr Magnus, who insists that the operation – to be carried out with the aid of a pioneering medical device called the "cerebral pulsator" – go ahead as planned. White reluctantly agrees and allows Magnus to use Cloudbase's [[sickbay]] as an [[operating theatre]].

Unknown to Spectrum, Magnus is a Mysteron reconstruction of the original doctor, who has been killed in a [[road accident]] engineered by [[Captain Black (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Black]] (voiced by Donald Gray). During the operation, the reconstruction deliberately overruns the cerebral pulsator to induce a fatal [[seizure]] in his masked patient. Dr Fawn (voiced by [[Charles Tingwell]]) then removes the mask to reveal the face of [[Captain Scarlet (character)|Captain Scarlet]] (voiced by [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]]), who unknown to Magnus had substituted for Tiempo. Exposed as a Mysteron agent, Magnus breaks out of sickbay and flees to Cloudbase's [[electrical room]], where he is cornered by [[Captain Blue (Captain Scarlet)|Captain Blue]] (voiced by [[Ed Bishop]]) and dies when he comes into contact with a bare cable. During this time, an abnormality has appeared on one of Tiempo's pre-operative [[radiograph]]s: Magnus's hand, which was accidentally caught in the image, has blocked the [[X-ray]]s and is showing as flesh. With Tiempo safe and Scarlet once again revived, White announces that Spectrum will develop technology to exploit the Mysterons' imperviousness to X-rays and vulnerability to electricity.

==Production==
Writers Richard Conway and Stephen J. Mattick named Magnus's colleague, Dr Turner, after the episode's director, [[Ken Turner (director)|Ken Turner]]. In the script, Conway and Mattick suggested that [[Wexham Park Hospital]] could be used to record footage showing the development of Tiempo's radiographs. In the end, however, the episode was filmed entirely at Century 21's studios on the [[Slough Trading Estate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bentley|first1=Chris|title=The Complete Book of Captain Scarlet|year=2001|publisher=[[Carlton Books]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-84222-405-2|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode's [[incidental music]] was recorded during a four-and-a-half-hour studio session held on 14 May 1967, when it was performed by a 12-member ensemble conducted by series composer [[Barry Gray]]. The music for "[[Renegade Rocket]]" was recorded during the same session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Klerk|first1=Theo|title=Complete Studio-Recording List of Barry Gray|url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67:complete-studio-recording-list-of-barry-gray&amp;catid=116:barry-gray&amp;Itemid=182|work=tvcentury21.com|date=25 December 2003|accessdate=20 March 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m00eATOK?url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67:complete-studio-recording-list-of-barry-gray&amp;catid=116:barry-gray&amp;Itemid=182|archivedate=13 December 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Operation Time" features voice actor [[Gary Files]]' first contributions to ''Captain Scarlet''. Files was unavailable for dialogue recording during the production of the first five episodes because he was providing voices for the film ''[[Thunderbird 6]]'', to which he had been signed on as a "try-out" for ''Captain Scarlet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gary Files Interview|url=http://www.thevervoid.com/media/scarlet_interview.htm|publisher=thevervoid.com|accessdate=11 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626072515/http://www.thevervoid.com/media/scarlet_interview.htm|archivedate=26 June 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Andrew Pixley and Julie Rogers of ''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' magazine note the "cryptic" nature of the Mysterons' threat to "kill time", humorously remarking that it could "[suggest] they'll be passing a few hours playing cards or watching ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]''." They also consider the "rather graphic" [[electrocution]] of the reconstructed Magnus to be one of the series' more violent moments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine|title=''Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons'': By Numbers|last1=Pixley|first1=Andrew|last2=Rogers|first2=Julie|editor1-last=Gillatt|editor1-first=Gary|magazine=[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]|issue=280|date=December 2001|publication-date=November 2001|publisher=[[Visual Imagination]]|location=London, UK|issn=0955-114X|oclc=79615651|pages=46 and 48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>According to [[Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Anime and manga/Archive 71]], master licensees should be listed. Funimation holds license in UK as well (according to the Anime Limited product listing ("This is a Funimation title being distributed by Anime Limited in the UK.")), so they should be listed.</comment>

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Overlord (novel series) characters}}
&lt;!--This MUST be in your own words, otherwise it is a violation of copyright.--&gt;
In the year 2126, a Dive Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Game or DMMORPG called Yggdrasil was released. It stands out among all other DMMORPGs due to its unusually high ability for the player to interact with the game. After an intense 12-year run the game servers are about to be shut down. Within the game exists a guild, Ainz Ooal Gown, once consisting of 41 members and credited as one of the strongest guilds in the game. Now only 4 of the members remain, the other 37 having quit the game. Of those 4 only one, an elder lich character named Momonga, continues to play as the guild leader and maintaining their headquarters, The Great Tomb of Nazarick. He invites the remaining guild members but of those only one appears and only for a short while before leaving. While saddened by this, he accepts the reality that his friends have their other lives (both lives are real) to take care of and decides to stay logged in until the servers shut down.

When the shut-down time arrives however, Momonga finds that the game hasn't vanished. Instead it appears as if Yggdrasil has been recreated as its own reality along with its various NPCs having been brought to life while Momonga has been trapped in the form of his game avatar, leaving him unable to use the normal player functions, such as General Message, or even to log out. With no other option, Momonga sets out to learn if anyone from the real world is also in this new world with him. Taking on the name of Ainz Ooal Gown, a message to any other players, Momonga begins exploring the world in an attempt to figure out what has happened while searching for anyone or anything that could help him solve this mystery, while ensuring the safety of Nazarick.

In reviewing the anime adaptation, [[Kotaku]] called the ''Overlord'' anime a "magnificent power fantasy" which "brings up a very relatable theme for anyone who has played an MMORPG before."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://kotaku.com/overlord-is-a-magnificent-power-fantasy-1737985647|title=Overlord is a Magnificent Power Fantasy|date=October 22, 2015|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=September 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a review by [[Monsters and Critics]] claimed that "fans were not too happy with the CGI animation" produced by studio Madhouse for the third season and the "biggest disappoint was Overlord Season 3 Episode 12, which animated the epic scene showing the Dark Youngs."&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.monstersandcritics.com/anime/overlord-season-4-release-date-story-in-kugane-maruyamas-overlord-light-novel-series-requires-a-2021-two-cour-anime-premiere-spoilers/|title=Overlord Season 4 release date: Story in Kugane Maruyama’s Overlord light novel series requires a 2021 two-cour anime premiere?

'''''Orange Prince (1984)''''' is a painting by American artist [[Andy Warhol]], of [[Prince (musician)|Prince Rogers Nelson]] (1958–2016), the American singer, songwriter, record producer, multi-instrumentalist, actor, and director.

''Orange Prince'' ''(1984)'' is considered an important late work referencing Warhol's portraits from the early 1960s, of movie stars and celebrity icons, such as [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Jacqueline Kennedy]]. Art historian and Warhol expert [[Thomas E. Crow]] believes that Warhol's portrait of Prince shows much greater freedom of expression, as in the early portraits. This is especially evident when compared to Warhol's more 'factory-line' style of portraits from the 1970s onwards, which were mainly commissions.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

Prince did not commission the Warhol portraits, which stayed in Warhol's private collection until he died. Crow believes Warhol was fascinated by Prince, who was not in Warhol's direct circle. He says that Warhol was drawn to Prince's edgy image, which acted as inspiration for the art work:&lt;blockquote&gt;"(Warhol's) evident fascination with Prince, known for sexual frankness in his music and an androgynous style in his clothes, make-up, and hairstyle, echoed similar traits among those he famously gathered around himself in the [[The Factory|Factory]] entourage of the 1960s."&lt;ref name="PM"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/44T6MBA/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0032.3.pdf |title=Expert analysis of Warhol's painting of Prince (1984) |author=Thomas E.

== Composition ==
''Orange Prince'' uses a photograph as its source image, which depicts Prince in the burgeoning stages of his career in 1981, three years before the painting was created. The original color photograph shows Prince in a full length pose, from which Warhol isolated the head only for the portrait.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/photographs/xx5frv/Prince-1981|title=Prince, 1981|website=www.morrisonhotelgallery.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;

The composition of ''Orange Prince'' makes direct reference to the portraits Warhol produced in the 1960s, as Crow points out in his 2018 analysis of the painting, and is similar in composition to Warhol's Marilyn series where the subject's head 'floats' in day-glo color.

According to Crow, the composition is distinct from other late portraits, the majority of which were commissions and followed a commercial formula, such as Warhol's portrait of [[Michael Jackson]] which was commissioned and created a few months before ''Orange Prince.'' As Crow says: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Warhol’s 1984 portrait (of Prince)...harked back to the independently conceived celebrity likenesses of his earlier career (from the 1960s). As Prince had not commissioned any of the paintings, Warhol could experiment with far more variations in background patterns and colors."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The face of the subject is depicted in a neon orange color, the same as the background. The facial outline, features and hair are in black. Highlights of green and blue are woven onto the screen amongst the black line around the subject's facial features, hair and ears. The overall effect is to make the subject [[Luminescence|luminesce]], with a trade-mark Warhol flatness to the image, due partly to the very little graduation of shading.

== Prince and Andy Warhol ==
Prince and Andy Warhol were personally acquainted, as Warhol's diary entries show.&lt;ref name="1928–1987" /&gt;

On a number of occasions in the early 1980s Prince had appeared in [[Interview (magazine)|''Andy Warhol's Interview Magazine'']]. In the April 1980 edition Prince appears in a full-page photograph by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/remembering-prince|title=Remembering Prince - Interview Magazine|date=2016-04-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glasstire.com/2016/04/22/prince-1958-2016/|title=Prince (1958-2016) – Glasstire|website=glasstire.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warhol attended a number of Prince concerts in the 1980s, including one of the very earliest in New York. On December 9, 1980, Prince played [[The Ritz (rock club)|The Ritz]] in New York as part of his ''[[Dirty Mind Tour]]''. The club was only half-full, but as music critic [[Nik Cohn]] reported, "Andy Warhol and his claque showed up, and so did a number of music-biz faces. Before the show, they lounged in poses of practised cool. Then Prince appeared, and cool went up in flames".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/prince-interview-quotes|title=Prince, the godfather of R&amp;B, had his fingerprints everywhere|last=Cohn|first=Nik|access-date=2018-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the December 1981 edition of Warhol's ''Interview'' magazine Prince appears in a controversial image showing him in the shower, and a crucifix on the wall behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.interviewmagazine.com/music/prince-showers-for-controversy|title=Flashback: Prince Showers for Controversy - Interview Magazine|date=2012-09-21|work=Interview Magazine|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 1984, Warhol created ''Orange Prince''. Prince had released the ''[[Purple Rain (album)|Purple Rain]]'' album and movie that year and was well known internationally. 

On August 2, 1986, Warhol was in the front row at Prince's concert at [[Madison Square Garden]]. In his diary entry of their meeting, Warhol described sitting down at the concert "...just as Prince jumps out naked, or almost, and it's the greatest concert I've ever seen there, just so much energy and excitement."&lt;ref name="1928–1987"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Andy Warhol diaries |last=Warhol |first=Andy |editor-last=Hackett |editor-first=Pat |isbn=9781455561452 |publisher=Twelve |location=New York, NY |oclc=881024850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards at the New York dance club, [[Palladium (New York City)|The Palladium]], Warhol reported that he was very excited to be invited to an after-party hosted by Prince, and fascinated by him. Warhol described arriving at the party and seeing Prince appear in the near-empty club "...in a white coat and pink bellbottoms, like a Puerto Rican at a prom, all by himself". He also stated Prince was a gracious host who remembered the names of the many individuals in Warhol's entourage that night, and how Prince made sure he danced with everyone.

The same party was also attended by [[Billy Idol]]; seeing Prince and Idol together, Warhol observed that "Hollywood glamour girls" such as [[Jean Harlow]] and [[Marilyn Monroe]] had been supplanted by "glamour boys" such as Prince and Idol—a development that Warhol found completely fascinating and "...so weird".&lt;ref name="1928–1987"/&gt;

That night, Prince agreed to appear on the December 1986 cover of Warhol's Interview magazine, which Warhol described in his diary:&lt;blockquote&gt;"We asked Prince if he would be our December cover and he said we'd have to talk to his manager and we said that we'd asked the manager and the manager said to ask him, and so they said they'd work it out. We were just shaking, it was so exciting."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Warhol's portrait of Prince was created in 1984, two years before their post-concert meeting in 1986, and remained in Warhol's own collection until he died in 1987.&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt; 

== Technique ==
''Orange Prince'' was created using a complex tracing and [[Screen printing|silkscreening]] process, using layers of colors of silkscreen ink on top of a hand-painted orange ground of acrylic polymer paint, applied to [[Canvas print|canvas]]. The technique was popularised by Warhol, and is synonymous with the artist from the 1960s onwards, when he produced his early portraits of [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Marlon Brando]], and other Hollywood movie stars and celebrities of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sothebys.com/en/news-video/blogs/all-blogs/21-days-of-andy-warhol/2013/11/andy-warhol-and-his-process.html|title=Andy Warhol &amp; His Process|last=Sotheby's|first=|date=10 Nov 2013|website=sothebys.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1989 MoMA catalogue of Warhol's work, includes a comprehensive description of Warhol's silkscreening technique, provided by the British curator and author Marco Livingstone under the title, “Do It Yourself: Notes on Warhol’s Technique.”&lt;blockquote&gt;A pencil tracing was taken from the full sized [transparent] acetate prepared for the photographic screen. Either by transferring the penciled line by pressing onto the front of the acetate or sheet of paper, or by placing a sheet of carbon paper beneath the tracing and then drawing the line one section at a time, a rough guide was established for each color area, for example, the lips and the eyelids. The colors were then brushed on by hand, often with the use of masking tape to create a clean junction between them, with the eventual imposition of the black screened image also serving to obscure any unevenness in the line. The acetates were examined by Warhol before they were made into screens, so that he could indicate by means of instructions, written and drawn with china-marking crayon, any changes to be made: for example, to increase the tonal contrast by removing areas of half-tone, thereby flattening the image. The position of the image would be established by taping the four corners of the acetate to the canvas and then tearing off the tape along the corner edges of the acetate; the fragments of tape remaining on the canvas would serve as a guide in locating the screen on top. The position of the screen would be confirmed by eye, and it would then be printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.moma.org/documents/moma_catalogue_1815_300161087.pdf |title=Andy Warhol, a retrospective : [brochure] the Museum of Modern Art, New York, February 6 to May 2, 1989 |date=1989 |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[File:Orange Marilyn, 1962, silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol.jpeg|thumb|''Orange Marilyn'', 1962, is a silkscreen painting by Andy Warhol from the Marilyn Flavors series.

== Warhol's orange paintings ==
A number of important silkscreen works by Andy Warhol use the color orange. Some of the first silkscreen works from the 1960s use orange as the dominant color, and Warhol continued to use orange in his paintings throughout his lifetime. ''Orange Prince'' shares a compositional style to ''Orange Marilyn'', 1962. A number of orange paintings by Warhol are in museum collections around the world:

The effect of bright colors in Warhol's work is to draw renewed focus to the subject matter. In the ''Death and Disaster'' series of paintings the graphic images Warhol took from tabloid newspaper stories of the time are a stark counterpoint to the candy-color palette. Another example of this is ''Twelve Electric Chairs'' from 1964, which consists of twelve highly contrasting colored images of the electric chair, including ''Orange Little Electric Chair,'' 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://hyperallergic.com/306853/death-and-death-and-death-by-warhol/|title=Death and Death and Death by Warhol|date=2016-06-22|work=Hyperallergic|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2017, a leading art industry newsletter, Baer Faxt, reported that Warhol’s Orange Marilyn sold in a private transaction for $250 million&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://assets2.pacermonitor.com/filings/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al/The_Andy_Warhol_Foundation_For_v_Goldsmith_et_al__nysdce-17-02532__0060.1.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=FQoGZXIvYXdzEIj%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDFbY044zFyY8bD2myiK3A68z6LvG76TbkfqGMpaaBS8m7uWWyVK5eCsEv%2FpI4Fnl7OjzcrzGEM21YaPitEAgKuEDBdDqovfp%2BV9TJ76lgbD%2FTNqp0POody5rediUNetECE2vNsLgWc2amy1ZOu3biDw4A%2FpXn1cbWZYUhTsUK3yKRcJ3RZ%2FTIpDrna9udqcgsYXSLdurozjAWQzsue5lxtWDVcBiaz9Ig4Xn3ytNO80slqq7DItFcrrxOv7Ywq6bdgx6hP0bptqayCko2tvQdUbAP2FXT6kjS8AFPpCFvmEDlv9hPDtshqNO2M%2BSHR%2F1EP3JwOoPmzaQxH%2Fg6zplJfq8jQYI8bS6hUOoftnD4ht5L1Ddg5WBajvIWXkHWLKuytWc4SC6jAOrsrBj%2FWoLyHGN6sOF1GcAMjr9axS6YqD%2Bk4shA2GTFBk1kJC%2F0CwursUeNaiJh1iyDGdKOEEe9CvwTuXAVvD6Ga7xs0FP%2Beca9hGlR%2BFuwoBqPIfkNzP98Ip%2BEshAtgoguAC%2Beh7EP99XLk4wXbGYL3HwNX%2B7Tp3jDwpJ50z%2FsW7tW3rAmh6KzBxyDdnlAlTuSSNjt%2FP4PVRcz88miwwo%2Fs2n3gU%3D&amp;X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&amp;X-Amz-Date=20181019T145627Z&amp;X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&amp;X-Amz-Expires=600&amp;X-Amz-Credential=ASIA5OSMEZQHIX2MTBXV%2F20181019%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&amp;X-Amz-Signature=03c5bd1110bde5df7cf53549731be259c6e59561b57eab01bbe6a38e78bda18d|title=Warhol expert, Laura Paulson, on Warhol's paintings of Prince|last=Laura|first=Paulson|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prince's favorite color was orange ==
In 2017 Prince's sister, Tyka Nelson, confirmed that Prince's favorite color was ''orange'', and not purple, as assumed. Also that Prince often wore all-orange stage outfits, had orange sets for concerts and his favorite item was his custom-built orange Cloud guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spin.com/2017/08/prince-orange-favorite-color-purple/|title=Prince’s Sister Says His Favorite Color Was Actually Orange, Not Purple|date=2017-08-29|work=Spin|access-date=2018-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern-day icon ==
Art historian, Thomas Crow, believes Warhol depicts Prince as a "modern-day icon" in his painting, referencing religious iconographic paintings: &lt;blockquote&gt;"[Warhol's portrait of Prince] returned Warhol to the origins of his art-critical credibility, that is, the flattened, emblematic, minimally descriptive manner that had characterized his first, definitive phase as an artist."&lt;ref name="PM" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''Marilyn Diptych'', 1962, is an early example of iconography in Warhol's work, the image repeated many times to emphasise the ubiquity of celebrity and references a form of religious painting in its title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/ap-art-history/later-europe-and-americas/modernity-ap/a/warhol-marilyn-diptych|title=Warhol, Marilyn Diptych|website=Khan Academy|access-date=2018-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marilyn "Flavors" portraits – thirteen unique paintings of Marilyn Monroe with different color backgrounds – are also amongst the first examples of Warhol's iconographic style, and graphic use of saturated block color, held by art historians to highlight a manufactured celebrity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/lotfinder/Lot/andy-warhol-1928-1987-orange-marilyn-4806391-details.aspx|title=Essay by Trevor Fairbrother on the iconographic style of Warhol's portraits including the Marilyn single portrait series from 1962|last=|first=|date=|website=www.christies.com|access-date=2018-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1=George Frei |editor2=Neil Printz |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Catalogue-Raisonn%C3%A9-Paintings-Sculptures-1961-1963/dp/0714840866/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1519842007&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=andy+warhol+catalogue+raisonne |title=Andy Warhol Catalogue Raisonné, Paintings and Sculptures 1961–1963 |author=Andy Warhol Foundation |date=11 Mar 2002 |publisher=Phaidon Press |isbn=9780714840864 |edition=Slp |location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Robert Rosenblum was personally close to Warhol and wrote about Warhol's Catholic religious observance, which informed Rosenblum's observation about the 1962 ''Gold Marilyn'' in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art: &lt;blockquote&gt;"When Warhol took a photographic silkscreen of Marilyn Monroe’s head, set it on gold paint, and let it float high in a timeless, spaceless heaven..., he was creating, in effect, a secular saint for the 1960s that might well command as much earthly awe and veneration as, say, a Byzantine Madonna hovering for eternity on a gold mosaic ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://laurel.lso.missouri.edu:2083/iii/encore/record/C__Rb13563936__Sjoe%20rosenblum__P0%2C17__Orightresult__X1;jsessionid=4912A4D75A4FD6B390E943219B91FEC2?lang=eng&amp;suite=mobum-sso |title=Robert Rosenblum selected writings on Andy Warhol and other artists|last=Rosenblum|first=R|date=1999|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Geralyn Huxley, curator of film and video at the [[The Andy Warhol Museum|Andy Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh, believes Warhol's preoccupation with celebrity portraits and the style in which he depicts them, stems from the artist's religious upbringing. As a child Warhol attended a local Catholic church which featured an [[iconostasis]], a screen situated in front of the altar featuring large-scale depictions of the faces of the [[Saint]]s.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Andy-Warhol-Treasures-Geralyn-Huxley/dp/1847960049|title=Andy Warhol Treasures|last=Huxley|first=Geralyn|last2=Wrbican|first2=Matt|date=2009-05-14|publisher=Goodman Books|isbn=9781847960047|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art historian Jane Daggett Dillenberger, in her book ''The Religious Art of Andy Warhol'', points out that Warhol's portraits of celebrities have a strong affinity with the sacred icons at the [[St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church]] in Pittsburgh: &lt;blockquote&gt;"Andy's earliest experience of art was of religious art...for Andy, art and religion were linked."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Religious-Art-Andy-Warhol/dp/082641334X |title=The Religious Art of Andy Warhol |last=Dillenberger |first=Jane Daggett |date=2001-05-10 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group Ltd. |isbn=9780826413345 |location=New York; London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In his New York Times review of the 1989 Warhol retrospective exhibition at [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]], art critic Michael Brenson says that Warhol's portraits, at their best, bring together diametrically opposite values, such as sensual excess and the purity of an icon, as seen in the portrait of Prince:&lt;blockquote&gt;“[Andy Warhol's] flat images, painted in a flat tone, existing in a non-space from which past and future have been banished ... make the present seem absolute and eternal—in other words, transcendent. Part of Warhol’s achievement was to legitimize his love of secular, profane subjects by attaching to them traditional religious values. ... Warhol argues that self-effacement and sensual excess, purity and trash, the moment and eternity can exist together.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/03/arts/review-art-looking-back-at-warhol-stars-super-heroes-and-all.html|title=Review/Art; Looking Back at Warhol, Stars, Super-Heroes and All|last=Brenson|first=Michael|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Publications ==
''Orange Prince'' painting has been reproduced in books, magazines and other media, most notably as the cover of a commemorative magazine published by [[Condé Nast]] just after Prince's death in 2016.

=== ''Vanity Fair'' ===
The portrait was featured in both the November 1984 and the April 2016 editions of [[Vanity Fair (magazine)|''Vanity Fair'']], reproduced in color on a full page to illustrate the article entitled ''Purple Fame'', about Prince's rise to fame in the wake of his celebrated [[1984]] album and movie ''[[Purple Rain (film)|Purple Rain]],'' the inspiration for Warhol's portrait.

The ''Vanity Fair'' article claims that Warhol's portrait of Prince captures the recording artist "...at the height of his powers"&lt;ref name="CondeNast"&gt;{{Cite magazine|date=2016|title=The Genius of Prince|url=https://www.amazon.com/The-Genius-of-Prince/dp/B01F27Q48M|magazine=Condé Nast}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is one of the first global pieces written as a critical appreciation of the musician, coinciding with the start of the recording artist's 98-date [[Purple Rain Tour]]. ''Purple Rain'' is frequently regarded as Prince's [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]; declaring that Prince had "...finally arrived", and Warhol's portrait shows Prince as a confident and celebrated musician, now on a world stage and internationally renowned.

=== ''The Genius of Prince'' ===
''Orange Prince (1984)'' was reproduced on the front cover of ''The Genius of Prince'', a commemorative magazine published in the wake of the musician's sudden death just months before. The magazine was published as a US edition by [[Condé Nast]], in June 2016, to wide acclaim and distributed internationally.&lt;ref name=CondeNast/&gt;

=== ''Andy Warhol Treasures'' ===
The portrait also features in ''Andy Warhol Treasures'', a book published in 2009 by Geralyn Huxley.&lt;ref name="Amazon" /&gt;

[[File:Qawalli at Ajmer Sharif dargah.jpg|thumb|Qawwali at Ajmer Sharif dargah]]
'''Qawwali''' ([[Nastaʿlīq script|Nastaʿlīq]]: {{Nastaliq|قوّالی}}; [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: {{lang|pa|ਕਵਾਲੀ}} &lt;small&gt;([[Gurmukhi]])&lt;/small&gt;; Hindi: क़व्वाली; [[Bangla script|Bangla]]: কাওয়ালি) is a form of [[Sufi]] [[devotional music]] originating from the [[Indian subcontinent]], and notably popular in the [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] and [[Sindh]] regions of [[Pakistan]]; in [[Hyderabad, India|Hyderabad]], [[Delhi]] and other parts of [[India]], especially [[North India]]; as well as [[Dhaka Division|Dhaka]], [[Chittagong Division|Chittagong]] and [[Sylhet division]]s of Bangladesh. It is part of a musical tradition that stretches back for more than 700 years.

Originally performed at Sufi shrines or [[dargahs]] throughout South Asia, it gained mainstream popularity and International audience in late 20th century. Qawwali music received international exposure through the work of the late Pakistani singers [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], [[Sabri Brothers]], and [[Aziz Mian]] largely due to several releases on the [[Real World Records|Real World]] label, followed by live appearances at [[WOMAD]] festivals. Other famous Qawwali singers include Pakistan's [[Amjad Farid Sabri]], [[Fareed Ayaz|Fareed Ayyaz &amp; Abu Muhammad]], [[Rahat Fateh Ali Khan]], [[Badar Ali Khan|Badar Maindad]], [[Rizwan-Muazzam|Rizwan &amp; Moazzam Duo]], [[Qawwal Bahauddin|Bahauddin Qutbuddin]].

==Origins of Qawwali==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Sufism]] --&gt;

[[Delhi]]'s Sufi saint [[Amir Khusro|Amir Khusro Dehlavi]] of  the [[Chisti]] [[Tariqah|order]] of [[Sufism|Sufis]] is credited with fusing the [[Persian traditional music|Persian]], [[Arabic music|Arabic]], [[Turkish music|Turkish]], and [[Music of India|Indian]] musical traditions in the late 13th century in India to create Qawwali as we know it today.&lt;ref name="'Aaj rang hai'- Qawwali revisited"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://twocircles.net/2013mar07/%E2%80%98aaj_rang_hai%E2%80%99_qawwali_revisited.html| title = ‘Aaj rang hai’ - Qawwali revisited|publisher = TwoCircle.net|accessdate = 8 March 2013}}, Retrieved 16 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Sama'' is often still used in [[Central Asia]] and Turkey to refer to forms very similar to Qawwali, and in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, the formal name used for a session of Qawwali is ''Mehfil-e-Sama''.

Qaul (Arabic: قَوْل) is an "utterance (of the prophet)", Qawwāl is someone who often repeats (sings) a Qaul, Qawwāli is what a Qawwāl sings.

The songs which constitute the qawwali repertoire are primarily in [[Farsi|Persian]], [[Urdu]], [[Hindi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Monograph Series, Issues 20-23|year=1979|publisher=Center for South and Southeast Asia Studies, University of California|page=124|quote=Qawwali texts exist in Persian, Urdu and Hindi. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are some in [[Persian language|Persian]] from the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal era]],{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and a smattering in [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]] and dialects of north India like [[Brajbhasha]] and Awadhi.&lt;ref name="The Day After-Qawwali"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dayafterindia.com/dec206/silver_screen1.html| title = Bollywood Reinvents the Qawwali – With a Vengeance|publisher = The Day After: An International Illustrated Newsmagazine of India|accessdate = 23 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Daily Times-Delhi’s Qawwal Bachchon ka Gharana lights up Ramadan night at T2F"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2007%5C09%5C22%5Cstory_22-9-2007_pg12_10| title = Delhi’s Qawwal Bachchon ka Gharana lights up Ramadan night at T2F|publisher = Daily Times: Leading News Resource of Pakistan|accessdate = 23 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also qawwali in some regional languages but the regional language tradition is relatively obscure. Also, the sound of the regional language qawwali can be totally different from that of mainstream qawwali. This is certainly true of Chhote Babu Qawwal, whose style of singing is much closer to the Bengali [[Baul]] music than to the qawwali of [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]], for example.

The poetry is implicitly understood to be spiritual in its meaning, even though the lyrics can sometimes sound wildly secular, or outright hedonistic. The central themes of qawwali are love, devotion and longing (of man for the Divine).

Qawwalis are classified by their content into several categories:
* A [[hamd]] (حمد), Arabic for praise, is a song in praise of [[Allah]]. Traditionally, a qawwali performance starts with a hamd.
* A [[na`at]] (نعت), Arabic for description, is a song in praise of [[Muhammad]]. The opening hamd is traditionally followed by a naat.
* A [[manqabat]] (plural manaqib, مناقب, which means characteristics) is a song in praise of either [[Imam Ali]] or one of the Sufi saints. Manaqib in praise of Ali are sung at both [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]] gatherings. If one is sung, it will follow right after the naat. There is usually at least one manqabat in a traditional programme. 
* A [[marsiya]] (مرثية), Arabic for lamentation for a dead person, is a lamentation over the death of much of Imam Husayn's family in the [[Battle of Karbala]]. This would typically be sung only at a [[Shi'a]] gathering.
* A [[ghazal]] (غزل), Arabic for love song, is a song that sounds secular on the face of it. There are two extended metaphors that run through ghazals—the joys of drinking and the agony of separation from the beloved. These songs feature exquisite poetry, and can certainly be taken at face value, and enjoyed at that level.&lt;ref name="cassette"&gt;{{cite book|last=Manuel|first=Peter Lamarche|title=Cassette culture: popular music and technology in north India|publisher=U of Chicago P|year=1993|pages=124|isbn=978-0-226-50401-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jxVa_Mg_wzkC&amp;pg=PA125|accessdate=3 April 2010}}, Google Books Article, Retrieved 17 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in Pakistan and India, ghazal is also a separate, distinct musical genre in which many of the same songs are performed in a different musical style, and in a secular context. In the context of that genre, the songs are usually taken at face value, and no deeper meaning is necessarily implied. But in the context of qawwali, these songs of intoxication and yearning use secular metaphors to poignantly express the soul's longing for union with the Divine, and its joy in loving the Divine. In the songs of intoxication, "wine" represents "knowledge of the Divine", the "cupbearer" (saaqi) is God or a spiritual guide, the "tavern" is the metaphorical place where the soul may (or may not) be fortunate enough to attain spiritual enlightenment. (The "tavern" is emphatically '''not''' a conventional house of worship. Rather, it is taken to be the ''spiritual context'' within which the soul exists.) Intoxication is attaining spiritual knowledge, or being filled with the joy of loving the Divine. In the songs of yearning, the soul, having been abandoned in this world by that cruel and cavalier lover, God, sings of the agony of separation, and the depth of its yearning for reunion.
* A [[kafi]] is a poem in [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Saraiki language|Seraiki]] or [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], which is in the unique style of poets such as [[Sultan Bahoo]], [[Shah Hussain]], [[Bulleh Shah]] and [[Sachal Sarmast]]. Two of the more well-known Kafis include ''Ni Main Jana Jogi De Naal'' and ''Mera Piya Ghar Aaya''.
* A '''munajaat''' (مناجاة), Arabic for a conversation in the night or a form of prayer, is a song where the singer displays his thanks to Allah through a variety of linguistic techniques. It is often sung in Persian, with Mawlana Jalāl-ad-Dīn Rumi credited as its author.

==Composition of a qawwali party==
A group of qawwali musicians, called a ''party'' (or '''Humnawa''' in [[Urdu]]), typically consists of eight or nine men including a lead singer, one or two side singers, one or two [[Pump organ|harmonium]]s (which may be played by the lead singer, side singer or someone else), and percussion. If there is only one percussionist, he plays the [[tabla]] and [[dholak]], usually the tabla with the dominant hand and the dholak with the other one (i.e. a left-handed percussionist would play the tabla with his left hand). Often there will be two percussionists, in which case one might play the tabla and the other the dholak. There is also a chorus of four or five men who repeat key verses, and who aid percussion by hand-clapping.

The performers sit cross-legged on the ground in two rows &amp;mdash; the lead singer, side singers and harmonium players in the front row, and the chorus and percussionists in the back row.

Before the fairly recent introduction of the harmonium, qawwalis were usually accompanied by the [[sarangi]]. The sarangi had to be retuned between songs; the harmonium didn't, and was soon preferred.

Women used to be excluded from traditional Muslim music, since they are traditionally prohibited from singing in the presence of men.  These traditions have changed, however, as is evident by the popularity (and acceptance) of female singers such as [[Abida Parveen]].  However, qawwali has remained an exclusively male business.  There are still no mainstream female qawwals.  Although Abida Parveen performs many songs that are in the traditional qawwali repertoire, she does not perform them in the traditional qawwali style.  Typically missing is the chorus which repeats key verses, as well as the handclapping.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Musical structure of Qawwali==
Songs are usually between 15 and 30 minutes long. However, the longest commercially released qawwali runs slightly over 115 minutes (Hashr Ke Roz Yeh Poochhunga by [[Aziz Mian|Aziz Mian Qawwal]]). The qawwali maestro [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] has at least two songs that are more than 60 minutes long.

Qawwalis tend to begin gently and build steadily to a very high energy level in order to induce hypnotic states both among the musicians and within the audience. Songs are usually arranged as follows:

# They start with an instrumental prelude where the main melody is played on the harmonium, accompanied by the tabla, and which may include improvised variations of the melody. 
# Then comes the [[alap]], a long tonal improvised melody during which the singers intone different long notes, in the [[raga]] of the song to be played.
# The lead singer begins to sing some preamble verses which are typically not part of the main song, although thematically related to it. These are sung unrhythmically, improvised following the raga, and accompanied only by the harmonium. After the lead singer sings a verse, one of the side singers will repeat the verse, perhaps with his own improvisation. A few or many verses will be sung in this way, leading into the main song.
# As the main song begins, the tabla, dholak and clapping begin. All members join in the singing of the verses that constitute the refrain. The lyrics of the main verses  are never improvised; in fact, these are often traditional songs sung by many groups, especially within the same lineage. However, the tunes are subtly improvised within the framework of the main melody. As the song proceeds, the lead singer or one of the side singers may break out into an alap. [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] also popularized the interjection of [[swara|sargam]] singing at this point. The song usually builds in tempo and passion, with each singer trying to outdo the other in terms of vocal acrobatics. Some singers may do long periods of sargam improvisation, especially alternating improvisations with a student singer. The songs usually end suddenly.

The singing style of qawwali is different from Western singing styles in many ways. For example, in words beginning with an "m", Western singers are apt to stress the vowel following the "m" rather than the "m" itself, whereas in qawwali, the "m" will usually be held, producing a muted tone. Also in qawwali, there is no distinction between what is known as the [[chest voice]] and the [[head voice]] (the different areas that sound will resonate in depending on the frequency sung). Rather, qawwals sing very loudly and forcefully, which allows them to extend their chest voice to much higher frequencies than those used in Western singing, even though this usually causes a more noisy or strained sound than would be acceptable in the West.

== Traditional sequence of a Chishtiya Sufi Order qawwali performance ==
* Instrumental: This is supposed to be the announcement of the arrival of [[Moinuddin Chishti]], as Sufi believes their saints are free of time-space. Also that [[Nabi (Universal Sufism)|Nabi]], [[Siddiq]], [[Shahid|Shaheed]], and [[Saleh]] category of faithfuls are never dead, just gone into some other state from where they visit whenever they are mentioned, especially if there is a function in their honor.
* [[Hamd]]
* [[Na`at]]
* [[Manqabat]] Ali
* Manqabats in praise of Sufi saints
* Manqabat Shaikh: Praise of the Shaikh/Pir if the performance is at an [[Urs]] celebration
* Rang or Badhawa: If it is an Urs performance, then it is usually Rang, a poem by [[Amir Khusro]]. The audience is often asked to stand when the Rang is sung. If it is the Shaikh's birthday, it is usually the Badhawa.

[[File:The Roman Aquaduct at Mória (Lesvos).ogv|thumb|Aerial footage of a Roman provincial aqueduct at Mória ([[Lesbos]])]]
The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] constructed [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueducts]] throughout their [[Roman Republic|Republic]] and later [[Roman Empire|Empire]], to bring water from outside sources into cities and towns. Aqueduct water supplied [[Thermae|public baths]], [[latrine]]s, fountains, and private households; it also supported mining operations, milling, farms, and gardens.

Aqueducts moved water through gravity alone, along a slight overall downward gradient within conduits of stone, brick, or [[Roman concrete|concrete]]; the steeper the gradient, the faster the flow. Most conduits were buried beneath the ground and followed the contours of the terrain; obstructing peaks were circumvented or, less often, tunneled through. Where valleys or lowlands intervened, the conduit was carried on [[list of Roman bridges#Aqueduct bridges|bridgework]], or its contents fed into high-pressure lead, ceramic, or stone pipes and siphoned across. Most aqueduct systems included sedimentation tanks, which helped reduce any water-borne debris. [[Sluice]]s and ''castella aquae'' (distribution tanks) regulated the supply to individual destinations. In cities and towns, the run-off water from aqueducts scoured the drains and sewers.

[[Rome]]'s first aqueduct was built in 312 BC, and supplied a water fountain at the city's cattle market. By the 3rd century AD, the city had eleven aqueducts, sustaining a population of over a million in a water-extravagant economy; most of the water supplied the city's many public baths. Cities and towns throughout the [[History of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]] emulated this model, and funded aqueducts as objects of public interest and civic pride, "an expensive yet necessary luxury to which all could, and did, aspire".&lt;ref&gt;Gargarin, M. and Fantham, E. (editors). ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, Volume 1''. p. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Roman aqueducts proved reliable and durable; some were maintained into the [[early modern]] era, and a few are still partly in use. Methods of aqueduct surveying and construction are noted by [[Vitruvius]] in his work ''[[De Architectura]]'' (1st century BC). The general [[Frontinus]] gives more detail in his [[De aquaeductu|official report]] on the problems, uses and abuses of Imperial Rome's public water supply. Notable examples of aqueduct architecture include the supporting piers of the [[Aqueduct of Segovia]], and the aqueduct-fed cisterns of [[Constantinople]].

Before the development of aqueduct technology, Romans, like most of their contemporaries in the ancient world, relied on local water sources such as springs and streams, supplemented by [[groundwater]] from privately or publicly owned wells, and by seasonal rain-water drained from rooftops into storage jars and [[cistern]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Mays, L. (editor). ''Ancient Water Technologies''. Springer. 2010. pp. 115–116.&lt;/ref&gt; The reliance of ancient communities upon such water resources restricted their potential growth. Rome's aqueducts were not strictly Roman inventions – their engineers would have been familiar with the water-management technologies of Rome's [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] and [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] allies – but they proved conspicuously successful. By the early Imperial era, the city's aqueducts supported a population of over a million, and an extravagant water supply for public amenities had become a fundamental part of Roman life.&lt;ref&gt;Gargarin, M. and Fantham, E. (editors). ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Ancient Greece and Rome, Volume 1''. Oxford University Press. 2010. pp. 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; The run-off of aqueduct water scoured the sewers of cities and towns. Water from aqueducts was also used to supply villas, ornamental urban and suburban gardens, market gardens, farms, and agricultural estates, the latter being the core of Rome's economy and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Bannon, ''Gardens and Neighbors: Private Water Rights in Roman Italy''.

===Rome's Aqueducts===
{{See also|List of aqueducts in the city of Rome}}
[[File:Aquae planrome.PNG|thumb|300px|Map of Rome's aqueducts]]
[[File:Aquae planlatium 2a.png|thumb|300px|Large scale map showing sources]]
Rome had several springs within its perimeter walls but its groundwater was notoriously unpalatable; water from the river [[Tiber]] was badly affected by pollution and [[waterborne disease]]s. The city's demand for water had probably long exceeded its local supplies by 312 BC, when the city's first aqueduct, the [[Aqua Appia]], was commissioned by the [[Roman censor|censor]] [[Appius Claudius Caecus]]. The Aqua Appia was one of two major public projects of the time; the other was a military road between Rome and [[Capua]], the first leg of the so-called [[Appian Way]]. Both projects had significant strategic value, as the [[Third Samnite War]] had been under way for some thirty years by that point. The road allowed rapid troop movements; and by design or fortunate coincidence, most of the Aqua Appia ran within a buried conduit, relatively secure from attack. It was fed by a spring 16.4&amp;nbsp;km from Rome, and dropped 10 metres over its length to discharge approximately 75,500 cubic metres of water each day into a fountain at Rome's cattle market, the [[Forum Boarium]], one of the city's lowest-lying public spaces.&lt;ref&gt;The Roman general and hydraulic engineer [[Frontinus]] later calculated its delivery at 1825 [[quinaria]]e (75,537 cubic meters) in 24 hours; see Samuel Ball Platner (1929, as completed and revised by Thomas Ashby): ''[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Europe/Italy/Lazio/Roma/Rome/_Texts/PLATOP*/Aqua_Appia.html A Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome]''. London: Oxford University. p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

A second aqueduct, the [[Aqua Anio Vetus]], was commissioned some forty years later, funded by treasures seized from [[Pyrrhus of Epirus]]. Its flow was more than twice that of the Aqua Appia, and it entered the city on raised arches, supplying water to higher elevations of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Julius [[Frontinus]]. ''The Aqueducts of Rome''. pp.1, 6–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 145 BC, the city had again outgrown its combined supplies. An official commission found the aqueduct conduits decayed, their water depleted by leakage and illegal tapping. The praetor [[Quintus Marcius Rex (praetor 144 BC)|Quintus Marcius Rex]] restored them, and introduced a third, "more wholesome" supply, the [[Aqua Marcia]], Rome's longest aqueduct and high enough to supply the [[Capitoline Hill]]. The works cost 180,000,000 [[sesterce]]s, and took two years to complete.&lt;ref&gt;"At that time the [[Decemviri|Decemvirs]], on consulting the [[Sibylline Books]] for another purpose, are said to have discovered that it was not right for the Marcian water, or rather the Anio (for tradition more regularly mentions this) to be brought to the Capitol. The matter is said to have been debated in the Senate, in the consulship of Appius Claudius and Quintus Caecilius, Marcus Lepidus acting as spokesman for the Board of Decemvirs; and three years later the matter is said to have been brought up again by Lucius Lentulus, in the consulship of Gaius Laelius and Quintus Servilius, but on both occasions the influence of Marcius Rex carried the day; and thus the water was brought to the Capitol." Sextus Julius Frontinus, ''The Aqueducts of Rome'', 6–20, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/De_Aquis/text*.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  As demand grew still further, more aqueducts were built, including the [[Aqua Tepula]] in 127 BC and the [[Aqua Julia]] in 33 BC. Aqueduct-building programmes reached a peak in the Imperial Era. Augustus' reign saw the building of the [[Aqua Virgo]], and the short [[Aqua Alsietina]] that supplied [[Trastevere]]'s artificial lake with water for staged [[Naumachia|sea-fights]] to entertain the populace. [[Aqua Augusta (Rome)|Another short Augustan aqueduct]] supplemented the Aqua Marcia with water of "excellent quality".&lt;ref name="Frontinus"&gt;The Aqua Alsietina was also known as "Aqua Augusta"; Frontinus distinguishes its "unwholesome" supply from the "sweet waters" of the Aqua Augusta that fed into the Aqua Marcia. On the one hand, he says the Naumachia's supply is "nowhere delivered for consumption by the people... [but the surplus is allowed] to the adjacent gardens and to private users for irrigation". On the other hand, "It is customary, however, in the district across the Tiber, in an emergency, whenever the bridges are undergoing repairs and the water supply is cut off from this side of the river, to draw from Alsietina to maintain the flow of the public fountains." Frontinus, ''The Aqueducts of Rome'' 1, 6–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Caligula]] added or began two aqueducts completed by his successor [[Claudius]]; the 69&amp;nbsp;km (42.8 mile) [[Aqua Claudia]], which gave good quality water but failed on several occasions; and the [[Anio Novus]], highest of all Rome's aqueducts and one of the most reliable but prone to muddy, discoloured waters, particularly after rain, despite its use of settling tanks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Frontinus/De_Aquis/text*.html Sextus Julius Frontinus, ''The Aqueducts of Rome'', 6–20]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Rome's aqueducts drew on various springs in the valley and highlands of the Anio, the modern river [[Aniene]], east of the Tiber. A complex system of aqueduct junctions, tributary feeds and distribution tanks supplied every part of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.maquettes-historiques.net/P9.html|title=THE AQUEDUCTS|first=André|last=CARON|website=www.maquettes-historiques.net|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trastevere]], the city region west of the Tiber, was primarily served by extensions of several of the city's eastern aqueducts, carried across the river by lead pipes buried in the roadbed of the river bridges, thus forming an inverted siphon.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Rabun (2002), ''[http://www3.iath.virginia.edu/waters/Journal2TaylorNew.pdf#page=16 Tiber River bridges and the development of the ancient city of Rome]'', pp. 16–17, accessed 22 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Whenever this cross-river supply had to be shut down for routine repair and maintenance works, the "positively unwholesome" waters of the Aqua Alsietina were used to supply Trastevere's public fountains.&lt;ref name="Frontinus"/&gt; The situation was finally ameliorated when the emperor [[Trajan]] built the [[Aqua Traiana]] in 109 AD, bringing clean water directly to Trastavere from aquifers around [[Lake Bracciano]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, A. Trevor, ''Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply'', Duckworth Archaeology, 2002, pp. 255 – 6, and note 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Esquilino - acquedotto Anio Vetus 1000968.JPG|thumb|Ruins of the [[Aqua Anio Vetus]], a Roman aqueduct built in 272 BC]]
By the late 3rd century AD, the city was supplied with water by 11 state-funded aqueducts. Their combined conduit length is estimated between 780 and a little over 800 kilometres, of which approximately {{convert|47|km|abbr=on}} were carried above ground level, on masonry supports. They supplied around 1 million cubic metres (300 million gallons) a day: a capacity 126% of the current{{when|date=April 2018}} water supply of the city of [[Bangalore]],{{cn|date=April 2018}} which has a population of 10 million.

===Aqueducts in the Roman Empire===
{{See also|List of aqueducts in the Roman Empire}}
[[File:Albarracín, Teruel, España, 2014-01-10, DD 002.JPG|thumb|"Galería de los Espejos" (Gallery of Mirrors), a tunneled part of a 25&amp;nbsp;km Roman aqueduct built during the 1st century AD near [[Albarracín]] ([[Spain]])]]
Hundreds of similar aqueducts were built throughout the Roman Empire. Many of them have since collapsed or been destroyed, but a number of intact portions remain. The [[Zaghouan Aqueduct]] is {{convert|92.5|km|abbr=on}} in length. It was built in the 2nd century to supply [[Carthage]] (in modern [[Tunisia]]). Surviving aqueduct bridges include the [[Pont du Gard]] in France and the [[Aqueduct of Segovia]] in Spain. The longest single conduit, at over 240&amp;nbsp;km, is associated with the [[Valens Aqueduct]] of Constantinople (Mango 1995). "The known system is at least two and half times the length of the longest recorded Roman aqueducts at Carthage and Cologne, but perhaps more significantly it represents one of the most outstanding surveying achievements of any pre-industrial society".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shca.ed.ac.uk/projects/longwalls/Water/context.htm Historical and Archaeological Context Constantinople and the longest Roman aqueduct] Accessed August 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Rivalling this in terms of length and possibly equaling or exceeding it in cost and complexity, is the provincial [[Aqua Augusta (Naples)|Aqua Augusta]] that supplied an entire region, which contained at least eight cities, including the major ports at  [[Naples]] and [[Misenum]]; sea voyages by traders and the Roman navy required copious supplies of fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;Da Feo, G., and Napoli, R. M. A., "Historical development of the Augustan Aqueduct in Southern Italy: twenty centuries of works from Serino to Naples", ''Water Science &amp; Technology Water Supply'', March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning, surveying and construction==

===Planning===
Whether state-funded or privately built, aqueducts were protected and regulated by law. Any proposed aqueduct had to be submitted to the scrutiny of civil authorities. Permission (from the senate or local authorities) was granted only if the proposal respected the water rights of other citizens; on the whole, Roman communities took care to allocate shared water resources according to need.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Bannon, ''Gardens and Neighbors: Private Water Rights in Roman Italy''. University of Michigan Press, 2009, pp. 5-10&lt;/ref&gt; The land on which a state-funded aqueduct was built might be state land (''[[ager publicus]]'') or privately owned, but in either case was subject to restrictions on usage and encroachment that might damage the fabric of the aqueduct. To this end, state funded aqueducts reserved a wide corridor of land, up to 15 feet each side of the aqueduct's outer fabric. Ploughing, planting and building were prohibited within this boundary. Such regulation was necessary to the aqueduct's long-term integrity and maintenance but was not always readily accepted or easily enforced at a local level, particularly when ''ager publicus'' was understood to be common property. Some privately built or smaller municipal aqueducts may have required less stringent and formal arrangements.&lt;ref name="Taylor, R. 2000, pp. 56-60"&gt;Taylor, R., ''Public Needs and Private Pleasures: Water Distribution, the Tiber River and the Urban Development of Ancient Rome'', (Studia Archaeologica), L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER, 2000, pp. 56-60&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sources and surveying===
Springs were by far the most common sources for aqueduct water; for example, most of Rome's supply came from various springs in the Anio valley and its uplands. Spring-water was fed into a stone or concrete springhouse, then entered the aqueduct conduit. Scattered springs would require several branch conduits feeding into a main channel. Some systems drew water from open, purpose-built, [[Roman dam|dammed]] reservoirs, such as the two (still in use) that supplied the aqueduct at the provincial city of [[Emerita Augusta]].&lt;ref&gt;Mays, L., (Editor), ''Ancient Water Technologies'', Springer, 2010. p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

The territory over which the aqueduct ran had to be carefully surveyed to ensure the water would flow at an acceptable gradient for the entire distance.&lt;ref name="Taylor, R. 2012"&gt;Taylor, R. (2012). Rome's Lost Aqueduct. (Cover story). Archaeology, 65(2), 34–40.&lt;/ref&gt; Roman engineers used various surveying tools to plot the course of aqueducts across the landscape. They checked horizontal levels with a ''[[chorobates]]'', a flatbedded wooden frame fitted with a water level. They plotted courses and angles could be plotted and checked using a ''[[Groma surveying|groma]]'', a relatively simple apparatus that was probably displaced by the more sophisticated [[dioptra]], precursor of the modern [[theodolite]]. In Book 8 of his [[De Architectura]], [[Vitruvius]] describes the need to ensure a constant supply, methods of prospecting, and tests for potable water.

===Health issues===
Greek and Roman physicians knew the association between stagnant or tainted waters and water-borne disease. They also knew the adverse health effects of lead on those who mined and processed it, and for this reason, ceramic pipes were preferred over lead. Where lead pipes were used, a continuous water-flow and the inevitable deposition of water-borne minerals within the pipes somewhat reduced the water's contamination by soluble lead.&lt;ref&gt;James Grout, ''Encyclopedia Romana,'' Lead Poisoning and Rome [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/~grout/encyclopaedia_romana/wine/leadpoisoning.html] (accessed 21 May 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the level of lead in this water was 100 times higher than in local spring waters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/111/18/6594|title=Lead in ancient Rome's city waters|first1=Hugo|last1=Delile|first2=Janne|last2=Blichert-Toft|first3=Jean-Philippe|last3=Goiran|first4=Simon|last4=Keay|first5=Francis|last5=Albarède|date=6 May 2014|publisher=|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=111|issue=18|pages=6594–6599|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.1400097111|pmid=24753588|pmc=4020092|bibcode=2014PNAS..111.6594D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conduits and gradients===
[[File:Aqüeducte de les Ferreres Tarragona 3.jpg|thumb|right|The water conduit of the [[Aqüeducte de les Ferreres|Tarragona Aqueduct]], Spain.]]
Most Roman aqueducts were flat-bottomed, arch-section conduits that ran 0.5 to 1&amp;nbsp;m beneath the ground surface, with inspection-and-access covers at regular intervals.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, A. Trevor, ''Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply,'' Duckworth Archaeology, 2002. pp. 93–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Conduits above ground level were usually slab-topped. Early conduits were ashlar-built but from around the late Republican era, brick-faced concrete was often used instead. The concrete used for conduit linings was usually [[Types of concrete#Old concrete recipes|waterproof]]. The flow of water depended on gravity alone. The volume of water transported within the conduit depended on the catchment hydrology – rainfall, absorption, and runoff – the cross section of the conduit, and its gradient; most conduits ran about two-thirds full. The conduit's cross section was also determined by maintenance requirements; workmen must be able to enter and access the whole, with minimal disruption to its fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, A. Trevor, ''Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply,'' Duckworth Archaeology, 2002. p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vitruvius]] recommends a low gradient of not less than 1 in 4800 for the channel, presumably to prevent damage to the structure through erosion and water pressure. This value agrees well with the measured gradients of surviving masonry aqueducts. The [[wiktionary:gradient|gradient]] of the [[Pont du Gard]] is only 34&amp;nbsp;cm per km, descending only 17&amp;nbsp;m vertically in its entire length of {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}}: it could transport up to 20,000 cubic metres a day. The gradients of temporary aqueducts used for [[hydraulic mining]] could be considerably greater, as at [[Dolaucothi]] in [[Wales]] (with a maximum gradient of about 1:700) and [[Las Medulas]] in northern [[Spain]]. Where sharp gradients were unavoidable in permanent conduits, the channel could be stepped downwards, widened or discharged into a receiving tank to disperse the flow of water and reduce its abrasive force.&lt;ref&gt;Mays, L., (Editor), ''Ancient Water Technologies'', Springer, 2010. p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The use of stepped cascades and drops also helped re-oxygenate and thus "freshen" the water.&lt;ref&gt;H. Chanson, "Hydraulics of Roman Aqueducts: Steep Chutes, Cascades, and Drop Shafts," ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 104 No. 1 (2000). 47-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bridgework and siphons===
[[File:Aqueduct of Segovia 08.jpg|thumb|left|277px|The arches of an elevated section of the Roman provincial [[Aqueduct of Segovia]], in modern [[Spain]].]]
Some aqueduct conduits were supported across valleys or hollows on arches of masonry, brick or concrete; the [[Pont du Gard]], one of the most impressive surviving examples of a massive masonry multiple-piered conduit, spanned the [[Gardon]] river-valley some 48.8&amp;nbsp;m (160 ft) above the Gardon itself. Where particularly deep or lengthy depressions had to be crossed, [[inverted siphon]]s could be used, instead of arched supports; the conduit fed water into a header tank, which fed it into pipes. The pipes crossed the valley at lower level, supported by a low "venter" bridge, then rose to a receiving tank at a slightly lower elevation. This discharged into another conduit; the overall gradient was maintained. Siphon pipes were usually made of soldered lead, sometimes reinforced by concrete encasements  or stone sleeves.  Less often, the pipes themselves were stone or ceramic, jointed as male-female and sealed with lead.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, A. Trevor, ''Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply,'' Duckworth Archaeology, 2002. pp. 110 – 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Vitruvius describes the construction of siphons and the problems of blockage, blow-outs and venting at their lowest levels, where the pressures were greatest. Nonetheless, siphons were versatile and effective if well-built and well-maintained. A horizontal section of high-pressure siphon tubing in the [[Aqueduct of the Gier]] was ramped up on bridgework to clear a navigable river, using nine lead pipes in parallel, cased in concrete.&lt;ref&gt;The sense of ''venter'' as "belly" is apparent in Vitruvius 8.6: "if there be long valleys, and when it [the water] arrives at the bottom, let it be carried level by means of a low substruction as great a distance as possible; this is the part called the ''venter'', by the Greeks ''koilia''; when it arrives at the opposite acclivity, the water therein being but slightly swelled on account of the length of the venter, it may be directed upwards... Over the venter long stand pipes should be placed, by means of which, the violence of the air may escape. Thus, those who have to conduct water through leaden pipes, may by these rules, excellently regulate its descent, its circuit, the venter, and the compression of the air."[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/8*.html Vitruvius, 8.6.5-6, trans Gwilt]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mays, L., (Editor), ''Ancient Water Technologies'', Springer, 2010. p.120.[https://books.google.com/books?id=AEzOzSZEAToC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;lpg=PA120&amp;dq=%22venter+bridge%22+Roman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CvtOLiuEYa&amp;sig=w1rR4BBxcire7L_wa3bubBP3TLs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MH-ZTqeSNo2WhQf29_G0BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22venter%20bridge%22%20Roman&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[hydraulics|hydraulic engineers]] use similar techniques to enable [[Sewerage|sewers]] and water pipes to cross depressions. At Arles, a minor branch of the main aqueduct supplied a local suburb via a lead siphon whose "belly" was laid across a riverbed, eliminating any need for supporting bridgework.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, R., ''Public Needs and Private Pleasures: Water Distribution, the Tiber River and the Urban Development of Ancient Rome'', (Studia Archaeologica), L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER, 2000, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inspection and maintenance===
[[File:F 57 Aqueduc Jouy aux Arches Bassin collecteur.JPG|right|thumb|210px|Catchment basin of the aqueduct of [[Metz]], [[France]]. The single arched cover protects two channels; either one could be closed off, allowing repair while the other continued to provide at least partial supply]]
Roman aqueducts required a comprehensive system of regular maintenance. The "clear corridors" created to protect the fabric of underground and overground conduits were regularly patrolled for unlawful ploughing, planting, roadways and buildings. Frontinus describes the penetration of conduits by tree-roots as particularly damaging.&lt;ref name="Taylor, R. 2000, pp. 56-60" /&gt; The aqueducts conduits would have been regularly inspected and maintained by working patrols, to reduce algal fouling, repair accidental breaches, to clear the conduits of gravel and other loose debris, and to remove channel-narrowing accretions of [[calcium carbonate]] in systems fed by [[hard water]] sources. Inspection and access points were provided at regular intervals on the standard, buried conduits. Accretions within syphons could drastically reduce flow rates, due to the already narrow diameter of their pipes. Some had sealed openings that might have been used as [[Drain rods|rodding eyes]], possibly using a pull-through device. In Rome, where a hard-water supply was the norm, mains pipework was shallowly buried beneath road kerbs, for ease of access; the accumulation of calcium carbonate in these pipes would have necessitated their frequent replacement.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, R., ''Public Needs and Private Pleasures: Water Distribution, the Tiber River and the Urban Development of Ancient Rome'' (Studia Archaeologica), L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER, 2000, pp. 30-33, for calcined accretions and replacement of pipework. Water regulations prescribed a 5 foot distance between buildings and mains piping; an urban version of the protective "corridors" afforded to aqueducts.&lt;/ref&gt;

The aqueducts were under the overall care and governance of a water commissioner (''curator aquarum''). It was a high status, high-profile appointment. In 97, Frontinus served both as consul and as ''curator aquarum'', under the emperor [[Nerva]].&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, A. Trevor, ''Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply'', Duckworth Archaeology, 2002, pp. 16-17: Frontinus had already had a distinguished career as consul, general and provincial governor; and he served again as consul in 100&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known of the day-to-day business of aqueduct maintenance teams (''aquarii''). Under the emperor [[Claudius]], Rome's contingent of imperial ''aquarii'' comprised a ''familia aquarum'' of 700 persons, both slave and free, funded through a combination of Imperial largesse and water taxes. They were supervised by an Imperial freedman, who held office as ''[[Procurator (Roman)|procurator]] aquarium''.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, R., ''Public Needs and Private Pleasures: Water Distribution, the Tiber River and the Urban Development of Ancient Rome'', (Studia Archaeologica), L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER, 2000, pp. 30-33&lt;/ref&gt; Theirs was probably a never-ending routine of patrol, inspection and cleaning, punctuated by occasional emergencies. Full closure of any aqueduct for servicing would have been a rare event, kept as brief as possible, with repairs preferably made when water demand was lowest, which was presumably at night.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, A. Trevor, ''Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply'', Duckworth Archaeology, 2002; debris and gravel, pp. 24−30, 275: calcium carbonate, pp. 2, 17, 98: apertures in pipes as possible rodding eyes, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The water supply could be shut off at its aqueduct outlet when small or local repairs were needed, but substantial maintenance and repairs to the aqueduct conduit itself required the complete diversion of water at any point upstream or at the spring-head itself.

[[File:Castellum_PS01.JPG|right|thumb|Urban distribution tank at Nîmes, France. Circular section pipes radiate from a central reservoir, fed by a square-sectioned aqueduct.]]

===Distribution===
Aqueduct mains could be directly tapped, but they more usually fed into public distribution terminals, known as ''castella aquae'', which supplied various branches and spurs, usually via large-bore lead or ceramic pipes. Thereafter, the supply could be further subdivided. Licensed, fee-paying private users would have been registered, along with the bore of pipe that led from the public water supply to their private property – the wider the pipe, the greater the flow and the higher the fee. Tampering and fraud to avoid or reduce payment were commonplace; methods included the fitting of unlicensed outlets, additional outlets, and the illegal widening of lead pipes; any of which might involve the bribery or connivance of unscrupulous aqueduct officials or workers. Official lead pipes carried [[lead pipe inscription|inscriptions]] with information on the pipe's manufacturer, its fitter, and probably on its subscriber and their entitlement.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, A. Trevor, ''Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply'', Duckworth Archaeology, 2002, pp. 291−298, 305−311, and footnotes.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Imperial era, lead production became an Imperial monopoly, and the granting of rights to draw water for private use from state-funded aqueducts was made an imperial privilege.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, R., ''Public Needs and Private Pleasures: Water Distribution, the Tiber River and the Urban Development of Ancient Rome'', (Studia Archaeologica), L'ERMA di BRETSCHNEIDER, 2000, pp. 85-86&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H B Evans, ''Water Distribution in Ancient Rome: The Evidence of Frontinus'', University of Michigan Press, 1997, pp. 41−43, 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

===Civic and domestic===
[[File:Tivoli Acquedotto Arci 0511-03.JPG|thumb|The ruins of the [[Aqua Marcia]] near [[Tivoli, Lazio|Tivoli]], built in 144–140 BC during the [[Roman Republic]]]]

Rome's first aqueduct (312 BC) discharged at very low pressure and at a more-or-less constant rate in the city's main [[Forum Boarium|trading centre and cattle-market]], probably into a low-level, cascaded series of troughs or basins; the upper for household use, the lower for watering the livestock traded there. Most Romans would have filled buckets and storage jars at the basins, and carried the water to their apartments; the better off would have sent slaves to perform the same task. The outlet's elevation was too low to offer any city household or building a direct supply; the overflow drained into Rome's main sewer, and from there into the Tiber. At this time, Rome had no [[Roman bath|public baths]]. The first were probably built in the next century, based on precursors in neighboring [[Campania]]; a limited number of private baths and small, street-corner public baths would have had a private water supply, but once aqueduct water was brought to the city's higher elevations, large and well-appointed public baths were built throughout the city, and drinking water was delivered to public fountains at high pressure. Public baths and fountains became distinctive features of Roman civilization, and the baths in particular became important social centres.&lt;ref&gt;For the earliest likely development of Roman public bathing, see Fagan, Garrett T., ''Bathing in Public in the Roman World'', University of Michigan Press, 1999, pp. 42−44. [https://books.google.com/books?id=R6tz_TzSVkAC&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;ots=cHtbhc4ju9&amp;dq=Roman%20baths%20first%20public&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA44#v=onepage&amp;q=Campania&amp;f=false googlebooks preview]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, A. Trevor, ''Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply'', Duckworth Archaeology, 2002, pp. 3, 5, 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of urban Romans lived in multi-storeyed blocks of flats (''[[Insula (building)|insulae]]''). Some blocks offered water services, but only to tenants on the more expensive, lower floors; the rest would have drawn their water ''gratis'' from public fountains.&lt;ref&gt;Gill N.S. (2007).

===Farming===
Between 65 and 90% of the Roman Empire's population was involved in some form of agricultural work. Farmers whose villas or estates were near a public aqueduct could draw, under license, a specified quantity of aqueduct water for summer irrigation at a predetermined time; this was intended to limit the depletion of water supply to users further down the gradient, and help ensure a fair distribution among competitors at the time when water was most needed and scarce. Water was possibly the most important variable in the agricultural economy of the Mediterranean world.  Roman Italy's natural water sources – springs, streams, rivers and lakes – were unevenly distributed across the landscape, and water tended to scarcity when most needed, during the warm, dry summer growing season. [[Columella]] recommends that any farm should contain a spring, stream or river;&lt;ref&gt;Columella, De Re Rustica, Book 1, English translation at Loeb Classical Library, 1941 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Columella/de_Re_Rustica/1*.html]&lt;/ref&gt; but acknowledges that not every farm did.

Farmland without a reliable summer water-source was virtually worthless. During the growing season, the water demand of a "modest local" irrigation system might consume as much water as the city of Rome; and the livestock whose manure fertilised the fields must be fed and watered all year round. At least some Roman landowners and farmers relied in part or whole on aqueduct water to raise crops as their primary or sole source of income but the fraction of aqueduct water involved can only be guessed at. More certainly, the creation of municipal and city aqueducts brought a growth in the intensive and efficient suburban market-farming of fragile, perishable commodities such as flowers (for perfumes, and for festival garlands), grapes, vegetables and orchard fruits; and of small livestock such as pigs and chickens, close to the municipal and urban markets.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Bannon, ''Gardens and Neighbors: Private Water Rights in Roman Italy''. University of Michigan Press, 2009, pp. 5−10; citing Hodge, ''Roman Aqueducts'', pp. 246 – 247 for estimate on water consumption by irrigation.&lt;/ref&gt;

A licensed right to aqueduct water on farmland could lead to increased productivity, a cash income through the sale of surplus foodstuffs, and an increase in the value of the land itself. In the countryside, permissions to draw aqueduct water for irrigation were particularly hard to get; the exercise and abuse of such rights were subject to various known legal disputes and judgements, and at least one political campaign; in the early 2nd century BC [[Cato the Elder|Cato]] tried to block all unlawful rural outlets, especially those owned by the landed elite - "Look how much he bought the land for, where he is channeling the water!" -  during his [[Roman censor|censorship]]. His attempted reform proved impermanent at best. Though illegal tapping could be punished by seizure of assets, including the illegally watered land and its produce, this law seems never to have been used, and was probably impracticable; food surpluses kept prices low. Grain shortages in particular could lead to famine and social unrest. Any practical solution must strike a balance between the water-needs of urban populations and grain producers, tax the latter's profits, and secure sufficient grain at reasonable cost for the Roman poor ([[Grain supply to the city of Rome|the so-called "corn dole"]]) and the army. Rather than seek to impose unproductive and probably unenforcable bans, the authorities issued individual water grants (though seldom in rural areas) and licenses, and regulated water outlets, with variable success. In the 1st century AD, [[Pliny the Elder]], like Cato, could fulminate against grain producers who continued to wax fat on profits from public water and public land.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Bannon, ''Gardens and Neighbors: Private Water Rights in Roman Italy''. University of Michigan Press, 2009, pp. 5−10; citing Hodge, ''Roman Aqueducts'', pp. 246−247 for estimate on water consumption by irrigation; p. 219 for Cato's legislation on misuse of water: the quotation is from Cato's speech against L. Furius Purpureus, who was consul in 196 BC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some landholders avoided such restrictions and entanglements by buying water access rights to distant springs, not necessarily on their own land. A few, of high wealth and status, built their own aqueducts to transport such water from source to field or villa; Mumius Niger Valerius Vegetus bought the rights to a spring and its water from his neighbour, and access rights to a corridor of intervening land, then built an aqueduct of just under 10 kilometres, connecting the springhead to his own villa. The senatorial permission for this "Aqua Vegetiana" was given only when the project seemed not to impinge on the water rights of other citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia Bannon, ''Gardens and Neighbors: Private Water Rights in Roman Italy''. University of Michigan Press, 2009, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial===
[[File:Canal romano de Llamas.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Rock-cut aqueduct feeding water to the mining site at [[Las Médulas]]]]
Some aqueducts supplied water to industrial sites, usually via an open channel cut into the ground, clay lined or wood-shuttered to reduce water loss. Most such [[leat]]s were designed to operate at the steep gradients that could deliver the high water volumes needed in mining operations. Water was used in [[hydraulic mining]] to strip the overburden and expose the ore by [[hushing]], to fracture and wash away metal-bearing rock already heated and weakened by [[fire-setting]], and to power water-wheel driven [[Trip hammer#Greco-Roman world|stamps and trip-hammers]] that crushed ore for processing. Evidence of such leats and machines has been found at [[Dolaucothi]] in south-west [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Andrew Wilson (classical archaeologist)|Wilson, Andrew]] (2002): "Machines, Power and the Ancient Economy", ''[[The Journal of Roman Studies]]'', Vol. 92, pp.&amp;nbsp;1–32 (21f.), p. 21f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, M.J.T., "Millstone and Hammer: the Origins of Water Power", Hull Academic Press, 1998, Section 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mining sites such as Dolaucothi and [[Las Medulas]] in northwest [[Spain]] show multiple aqueducts that fed water from local rivers to the mine head. The channels may have deteriorated rapidly, or become redundant as the nearby ore was exhausted. Las Medulas shows at least seven such leats, and Dolaucothi at least five. At Dolaucothi, the miners used holding reservoirs as well as hushing tanks, and sluice gates to control flow, as well as drop chutes for diversion of water supplies. The remaining traces (see [[palimpsest]]) of such channels allows the mining sequence to be inferred.
[[File:Dolaucothimap2.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Map of the gold mine at [[Dolaucothi]], showing its aqueducts]]
A number of other sites fed by several aqueducts have not yet been thoroughly explored or excavated, such as those at [[Longovicium]] near [[Lanchester, County Durham|Lanchester]] south of [[Hadrian's wall]], in which the water supplies may have been used to power trip-hammers for forging iron.

At [[Barbegal]] in [[Roman Gaul]], a reservoir fed an aqueduct that drove a cascaded series of 15 or 16 overshot water mills, grinding flour for the Arles region. Similar arrangements, though on a lesser scale, have been found in [[Caesarea]], [[Venafrum]] and Roman-era [[Athens]]. Rome's [[Aqua Traiana]] drove a flour-mill at the [[Janiculum]], west of the Tiber. A mill in the basement of the [[Baths of Caracalla]] was driven by aqueduct overspill; this was but one of many city mills driven by aqueduct water, with or without official permission. A law of the 5th century forbade the illicit use of aqueduct water for milling.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, A. Trevor, ''Roman Aqueducts and Water Supply'', Duckworth Archaeology, 2002. pp. 255−258. [Paperback] [https://www.amazon.com/Roman-Aqueducts-Supply-Duckworth-Archaeology/dp/0715631713]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline in use==
[[File:Eifelwasserleitung05.jpg|right|thumb|210px|A portion of the [[Eifel Aqueduct]], Germany, built in 80 AD. Its channel is narrowed by an accretion of [[calcium carbonate]], accumulated through lack of maintenance.]]
During the [[Decline of the Roman Empire|fall of the Roman Empire]], some aqueducts were deliberately cut by enemies but more fell into disuse because of deteriorating Roman infrastructure and lack of maintenance, such as the Eifel aqueduct (''pictured right'').&lt;!-- please retain this connection between text and pic --&gt; Observations made by the Spaniard [[Pedro Tafur]], who visited Rome in 1436, reveal misunderstandings of the very nature of the Roman aqueducts:
{{quote|Through the middle of the city runs a river, which the Romans brought there with great labour and set in their midst, and this is the Tiber. They made a new bed for the river, so it is said, of lead, and channels at one and the other end of the city for its entrances and exits, both for watering horses and for other services convenient to the people, and anyone entering it at any other spot would be drowned.&lt;ref&gt;Pedro Tafur, ''Travels and Adventures (1435–1439)'', trans. Malcolm Letts, Harper &amp; brothers, 1926.  [http://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/texts/tafur.html#ch3 link to washington.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

During the [[Renaissance]], the standing remains of the city's massive masonry aqueducts inspired architects, engineers and their patrons; [[Pope Nicholas V]] renovated the main channels of the Roman ''[[Aqua Virgo]]'' in 1453.&lt;ref name=gross&gt;{{cite book|last=Gross|first=Hanns|title=Rome in the Age of Enlightenment: the Post-Tridentine syndrome and the ancien regime|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1990|location=New York|isbn=0-521-37211-9|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many aqueducts in Rome's former empire were kept in good repair. The 15th-century rebuilding of [[Aqueduct of Segovia|aqueduct]] at [[Segovia]] in [[Spain]] shows advances on the [[Pont du Gard]] by using fewer arches of greater height, and so greater economy in its use of the raw materials. The skill in building aqueducts was not lost, especially of the smaller, more modest channels used to supply [[water wheel]]s. Most such mills in Britain were developed in the medieval period for bread production, and used similar methods as that developed by the Romans with [[leat]]s tapping local rivers and streams.

According to [[Catholic tradition]], '''Saint Amaro''' or '''Amarus the Pilgrim''' ({{lang-es|'''San Amaro'''}}, {{lang-gl|'''Santo Amaro'''}}) was an [[abbot]] and [[sailor]] who it was claimed sailed across the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to an earthly [[paradise]].  There are two historical figures who may have provided the basis for this legend.  The first was  a French [[penance|penitent]] of the same name who went on a [[pilgrimage]] to [[Santiago de Compostela]] in the thirteenth century.  On his return journey, he established himself at [[Burgos]], where he founded a [[hospital]] for [[leprosy|lepers]].

Saint Amaro has also been identified with [[Saint Maurus]], disciple of [[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]], who founded the first [[Benedictine]] [[monastery]] in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bairrodocatete.com.br/english/streets/SAmaro.htm | title = Rua Santo Amaro | accessdate = 2007-05-14 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928095621/http://www.bairrodocatete.com.br/english/streets/SAmaro.htm | archivedate = 2007-09-28 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the historical character of Saint Amaro converged many Pagan traditions present in Asturias and Galicia related with Gaelic ''[[immrama]]'' and ''[[echtrai]]'' like the voyages of [[Mael Dúin]], the [[The Voyage of the Uí Chorra|Úi Chorra]], [[The Voyage of Snedgus and Mac Riagla|Snegdus and Mac Riagla]] or [[The Voyage of Bran|Bran mac Febal]]. Many features of the Celtic [[Otherworld]] are present in the Periplus of Saint Amaro.

==The Periplus of Amaro==
Like [[Brendan|Saint Brendan]], Amaro is said to have travelled on a journey that echoes that of the Irish ''[[immram]]'' –the voyages to the paradisiacal islands of the West.  An edition of the ''Life of Saint Amaro'' was published at Burgos in 1552.&lt;ref&gt;Its full title was ''The Life of the Blessed Saint Amaro and of the Dangers that He Encountered Until He Reached the Earthly Paradise.'' See {{cite web | url = http://www.spanisharts.com/books/literature/i_lazarillo.htm | title = Hispanic Literature: Life of Lazarillo de Tormes and His Misfortunes and Adversities | publisher = SpanishArts.com | accessdate = 2007-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His legend holds that Amaro was a noble Catholic from Asia who was obsessed with the idea of visiting the earthly paradise.  With this goal in mind, he would inquire for more information from his guests.  Amaro was not successful in receiving information from them and was quite desperate and anguished about this until one night, [[God]] appeared to him and revealed how to reach his objective.  Amaro would have to build a boat and follow the path of the sun across the Atlantic Ocean.

Amaro took to the sea with some companions and sailed for six days and seven nights until he reached an island.  This was an extremely fertile land that was blessed with five cities inhabited by uncouth men –though the women were quite beautiful.

Amaro spent six months there until he heard a voice in his dreams telling him to depart the island.  Amaro sailed through the "[[Red Sea]]" until he reached the land of a beautiful fountain, where the people were beautiful and lived peaceful lives that lasted three hundred years.  Amaro remained there for three weeks until an old woman advised that he leave the island before he became accustomed to the good life.

[[Image:Solpor na Ria Cies ao fondo.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Sunset in the Western Galicia coast.]]They sailed for a long time into the vast unknown until they saw several vessels that they thought could assist them.  Unfortunately, they found that these vessels had been invaded by [[monster]]s, which had killed the sailors and taken their bodies down to the depths of the ocean.  Amaro was rescued by an apparition of a group of women, who advised him to empty his bottles of wine and oil into the sea, and then fill the bottles with air.  Amaro did this and was rescued from this "Mar Cuajado" (lit. "Still Sea"; [[Doldrums|the Doldrums]]).

Three days later they arrived at another [[desert island]], which was inhabited by savage beasts hostile to man.  There they found a hermit who informed them that the beasts there annihilated themselves by fighting one another on the day of [[John the Apostle|Saint John]]; the stench of the corpses persisted throughout the year.  The hermit provided them with supplies and recommended that they sail East, where there was a beautiful land that would satisfy all of their needs.

They sailed the next day and arrived in the afternoon, finding a monastery named Valdeflores.  A monk from this monastery, Leonites, greeted them and told Amaro that he was waiting for him: he was already informed of their arrival by means of a vision.  Leonites provided Amaro with instructions on how to reach the Earthly Paradise.

With Leonites, Amaro and his companions arrived at a natural harbor where they remained for a month, after which they traveled to an extensive and rugged valley, where Amaro will find what he was looking for: the Earthly Paradise.  First, however, Amaro stumbled upon a [[Convent|nunnery]] situated high upon a mountaintop called ''Flor de Dueñas'' (Flower of Ladies).

He remained there, receiving further instructions on how to reach Paradise from a holy woman named Baralides.  He is presented with a white [[Religious habit|habit]].  This is given to him by Brígida (Bridget), the niece of Baralides who lives in Paradise.  Unfortunately, Leonites began to cry: he's losing a dear friend.  But Baralides appears, and comforts Leonites with a gift.  She presents him with a branch of one of the two magical trees of the Earthly Paradise.

==Amaro in Paradise==
In Paradise, Amaro found an enormous castle built from gems and precious metals, with [[battlement]]s of gold and towers of rubies, walls made with multicolored bricks.

The castle’s gatekeeper informed Amaro that the castle was the Earthly Paradise, and thus no living being can enter it.  The saint begged the gatekeeper to allow him to look at Paradise through the keyhole.  Amaro was allowed to do this, and saw many things, including the [[Tree of life]] from which [[Adam]] ate; a primeval and eternal garden; enormous trees; birds whose song was so beautiful one could remain entranced by it for a thousand years; young musicians playing strange and unknown musical instruments; beautiful ladies adorned with a crown of flowers and dressed in white; the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]], who accompanied these young ladies.

Saint Amaro begged to be allowed in; the gatekeeper refused and informed him that during the saint's viewing of Paradise, three hundred years have passed.  Amaro returned to the coast to find his companions gone and a city named after him built there.

Amaro told the city’s inhabitants his story and they built him a house alongside the monastery of Valdeflores, where he lived for a number of years until he died.  He was buried alongside Baralides and Brígida.

==Veneration==
[[Image:ParroquiadeSanAmaro.JPG|right|150px|thumb|Ermita de San Amaro, Puerto de la Cruz.]]
There are a number of [[Hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]]s dedicated to Amaro in Spain.  There is a hermitage dedicated to Amaro in [[Puerto de la Cruz]], [[Tenerife]] (''Ermita de San Amaro'').  The town of [[San Amaro]] in [[Ourense (province)|Ourense province]] is named after him.

His cult was also diffused in [[Portugal]], where he is called ''Santo Amaro''.  In the districts of [[Coimbra]] and [[Viseu]], Saint Amaro is brought pinecones, nuts, and [[Common fig|dry figs]] as an [[ex-voto]] offering — but he only accepts these items if they have been stolen.  [[Matthew the Evangelist|Saint Matthew]], [[Simon the Zealot|Saint Simon]], and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Saint Bartholomew]] are also brought things that have been stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.portcult.com/OPS_03.htm | title = The Origins of  Popular Saints in Portugal: Saint Matthew: "don't go there empty-handed" | publisher = Portuguese Culture Web | accessdate = 2007-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also venerated with an annual religious festival in the parish of [[Ponta Delgada, Santa Cruz das Flores|Ponta Delgada]].

At [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]], the whitewashed church of Santo Amaro is one of just four pre-[[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] churches left in Portugal. Some parts date from the sixth century and the interior columns and [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] are carved with foliages and geometric designs from the seventh century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21186">'''Semantic change''' (also '''semantic shift''', '''semantic progression''', '''semantic development''', or '''semantic drift''') is the evolution of [[word]] usage—usually to the point that the modern meaning is radically different from the original usage. In [[historical linguistics|diachronic (or historical) linguistics]], semantic change is a change in one of the meanings of a [[Word (linguistics)|word]]. Every word has a variety of senses and [[connotations]], which can be added, removed, or altered over time, often to the extent that [[cognate]]s across space and time have very different meanings. The study of semantic change can be seen as part of [[etymology]], [[onomasiology]], [[semasiology]], and [[semantics]].

==Examples==
* Awful — Originally meant "inspiring wonder (or fear)". Used originally as a shortening for "full of awe", in contemporary usage the word usually has negative meaning.
* Demagogue — Originally meant "a popular leader". It is from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''dēmagōgós'' "leader of the people", from ''dēmos'' "people" + ''agōgós'' "leading, guiding". Now the word has strong connotations of a [[politician]] who panders to emotions and [[prejudice]].
* Egregious — Originally described something that was remarkably good. The word is from the [[Latin]] ''egregius'' "illustrious, select", literally, "standing out from the flock", which is from ''ex''—"out of" + ''greg''—(''grex'') "flock". Now it means something that is remarkably bad or flagrant.
* Guy —[[Guy Fawkes]] was the alleged leader of a [[Gunpowder Plot|plot]] to blow up the [[England|English]] [[Palace of Westminster|Houses of Parliament]] on 5 November 1605. The day was made a holiday, Guy Fawkes Day, commemorated by parading and burning a ragged, grotesque [[effigy]] of Fawkes, known as a ''Guy''. This led to the use of the word ''guy'' as a term for any "person of grotesque appearance" and then by the late 1800s—especially in the United States—for "any man", as in, e.g., "Some ''guy'' called for you." Over the 20th century, ''guy'' has replaced ''fellow'' in the U.S., and, under the influence of [[Culture of the United States|American popular culture]], has been gradually replacing ''fellow'', ''bloke'', ''chap'' and other such words throughout the rest of the [[English-speaking world]]. In the plural, it can refer to a mixture of genders (e.g., "Come on, you guys!" could be directed to a group of men and women).
* Gay — Originally meant (13th century) "lighthearted", "joyous" or (14th century) "bright and showy", it also came to mean "happy"; it acquired connotations of immorality as early as 1637, either sexual e.g., ''gay woman'' "prostitute", ''gay man'' "womanizer", ''gay house'' "brothel", or otherwise, e.g., ''gay dog'' "over-indulgent man" and ''gay deceiver'' "deceitful and lecherous". In the United States by 1897 the expression ''gay cat'' referred to a hobo, especially a younger hobo in the company of an older one; by 1935, it was used in prison slang for a homosexual boy; and by 1951 and clipped to ''gay'', referred to homosexuals.
:George Chauncey, in his book [[Gay New York]], would put this shift as early as the late 19th century among a certain "in crowd" knowledgeable of gay night life.

== Types ==
{{Redirect|Narrowing|E-unification in convergent term rewriting systems|Narrowing (computer science)}}
A number of classification schemes have been suggested for semantic change. 

=== Typology by Bloomfield (1933) ===

The most widely accepted scheme in the English-speaking academic world is from {{Harvcoltxt|Bloomfield|1933}}:
* Narrowing: Change from superordinate level to subordinate level. For example, ''[[skyline]]'' formerly referred to any [[horizon]], but now in the USA it has narrowed to a horizon decorated by skyscrapers.&lt;ref name="Jeffers129"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Jeffers|Lehiste|1979|p=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Widening: There are many examples of specific brand names being used for the general product, such as with ''[[Kleenex]]''.&lt;ref name="Jeffers129" /&gt; Such uses are known as generonyms: see [[genericization]].
* [[Metaphor]]: Change based on similarity of thing. For example, ''[[broadcast]]'' originally meant "to cast seeds out"; with the advent of radio and television, the word was extended to indicate the transmission of audio and video signals. Outside of agricultural circles, very few use ''broadcast'' in the earlier sense.&lt;ref name="Jeffers129" /&gt;
* [[Metonymy]]: Change based on nearness in space or time, e.g., ''jaw'' "cheek" → "mandible".
* [[Synecdoche]]: Change based on whole-part relation. The convention of using capital cities to represent countries or their governments is an example of this.
* [[Hyperbole]]: Change from weaker to stronger meaning, e.g., ''kill'' "torment" → "slaughter"
* [[Meiosis (figure of speech)|Meiosis]]: Change from stronger to weaker meaning, e.g., ''astound'' "strike with thunder" → "surprise strongly".
* Degeneration: e.g., ''knave'' "boy" → "servant" → "deceitful or despicable man".
* Elevation: e.g., ''knight'' "boy" → "nobleman".

=== Typology by Blank (1999) ===

However, the categorization of {{Harvcoltxt|Blank|1999}} has gained increasing acceptance:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Grzega|2004}} paraphrases these categories (except ellipses and folk etymology) as "similar-to" relation, "neighbor-of" relation, "part-of" relation, "kind-of" relation (for both specialization and generalization), "sibling-of" relation, and "contrast-to" relation (for antiphrasis, auto-antonymy, and auto-converse), respectively&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Metaphor]]: Change based on similarity between concepts, e.g., ''mouse'' "rodent" → "computer device".
* [[Metonymy]]: Change based on contiguity between concepts, e.g., ''horn'' "animal horn" → "musical instrument".
* [[Synecdoche]]: A type of metonymy involving a part to whole relationship, e.g. "hands" from "all hands on deck" → "bodies"
* Specialization of meaning: Downward shift in a taxonomy, e.g., ''corn'' "grain" → "wheat" (UK), → "maize" (US).
* Generalization of meaning: Upward shift in a taxonomy, e.g., ''hoover'' "Hoover vacuum cleaner" → "any type of vacuum cleaner".
* Cohyponymic transfer: Horizontal shift in a taxonomy, e.g., the confusion of ''mouse'' and ''rat'' in some dialects.
* [[Antiphrasis]]: Change based on a contrastive aspect of the concepts, e.g., ''perfect lady'' in the sense of "prostitute".
* [[Auto-antonymy]]: Change of a word's sense and concept to the complementary opposite, e.g., ''bad'' in the slang sense of "good".
* Auto-converse: Lexical expression of a relationship by the two extremes of the respective relationship, e.g., ''take'' in the dialectal use as "give".
* [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]]: Semantic change based on the contiguity of names, e.g., ''car'' "cart" → "automobile", due to the invention of the ''(motor) car''.
* [[Folk-etymology]]: Semantic change based on the similarity of names, e.g., French ''contredanse'', orig. English ''country dance''.

Blank considers it problematic, though, to include amelioration and pejoration of meaning as well as strengthening and weakening of meaning. According to Blank, these are not objectively classifiable phenomena; moreover, Blank has shown that all of the examples listed under these headings can be grouped into the other phenomena.

== Forces triggering change ==
Blank&lt;ref&gt;in {{Harvcoltxt|Blank|1997}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Blank|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; has tried to create a complete list of motivations for semantic change. They can be summarized as:
* Linguistic forces
* Psychological forces
* Sociocultural forces
* Cultural/encyclopedic forces

This list has been revised and slightly enlarged by {{Harvcoltxt|Grzega|2004}}:&lt;ref&gt;Compare {{Harvcoltxt|Grzega|2004}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Grzega|Schöner|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Fuzziness (i.e., difficulties in classifying the referent or attributing the right word to the referent, thus mixing up designations)
* Dominance of the prototype (i.e., fuzzy difference between superordinate and subordinate term due to the monopoly of the prototypical member of a category in the real world)
* Social reasons (i.e., contact situation with "undemarcation" effects)
* Institutional and non-institutional linguistic pre- and proscriptivism (i.e., legal and peer-group linguistic pre- and proscriptivism, aiming at "demarcation")
* Flattery
* Insult
* Disguising language (i.e., "misnomers")
* Taboo (i.e., taboo concepts)
* Aesthetic-formal reasons (i.e., avoidance of words that are phonetically similar or identical to negatively associated words)
* Communicative-formal reasons (i.e., abolition of the ambiguity of forms in context, keyword: "homonymic conflict and polysemic conflict")
* Wordplay/punning
* Excessive length of words
* Morphological misinterpretation (keyword: "folk-etymology", creation of transparency by changes within a word)
* Logical-formal reasons (keyword: "lexical regularization", creation of consociation)
* Desire for plasticity (creation of a salient motivation of a name)
* Anthropological salience of a concept (i.e., anthropologically given emotionality of a concept, "natural salience")
* Culture-induced salience of a concept ("cultural importance")
* Changes in the referents (i.e., changes in the world)
* Worldview change (i.e., changes in the categorization of the world)
* Prestige/fashion (based on the prestige of another language or variety, of certain word-formation patterns, or of certain semasiological centers of expansion)

== Practical studies ==
Apart from many individual studies, [[etymological dictionary|etymological dictionaries]] are prominent reference books for finding out about semantic changes.

== Theoretical studies ==
Recent overviews have been presented by Blank&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blank|1997|pp=7–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; and {{Harvcoltxt|Blank|Koch|1999}}. Semantic change had attracted academic discussions already in ancient times. The first major works of modern times were {{Harvcoltxt|Reisig|1839}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Darmesteter|1887}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bréal|1899}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Paul|1880}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Stern|1931}}, {{Harvcoltxt|Bloomfield|1933}} and [[Stephen Ullmann]].&lt;ref&gt;in {{Harvcoltxt|Ullmann|1957}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Ullmann|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies beyond the analysis of single words have been started with the word-field analyses of {{Harvcoltxt|Trier|1931}}, who claimed that every semantic change of a word would also affect all other words in a lexical field.&lt;ref&gt;An example of this comes from [[Old English]]: ''meat'' (or rather ''mete'') referred to all forms of solid food while ''flesh'' (''flæsc'') referred to animal tissue and ''food'' (''foda'') referred to animal fodder; ''meat'' was eventually restricted to ''flesh'' of animals, then ''flesh'' restricted to the tissue of humans and ''food'' was generalized to refer to all forms of solid food {{Harvcoltxt|Jeffers|Lehiste|1979|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; His approach was later refined by {{Harvcoltxt|Coseriu|1964}}. {{Harvcoltxt|Fritz|1974}} introduced [[Generative linguistics|Generative]] semantics. More recent works including [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] and [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive]] theories are those in {{Harvcoltxt|Warren|1992}}, [[Dirk Geeraerts]],&lt;ref&gt;in {{Harvcoltxt|Geeraerts|1983}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Geeraerts|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Harvcoltxt|Traugott|1990}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Blank|1997}}.

As stated above, the most currently used typologies are those by {{Harvcoltxt|Bloomfield|1933}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Blank|1999}} shown above. Other typologies are listed below.

=== Typology by Reisig (1839) ===
[[Christian Karl Reisig|Reisig's]] ideas for a classification were published posthumously. He resorts to classical rhetorics and distinguishes between
* Synecdoche: shifts between part and whole
* Metonymy: shifts between cause and effect
* Metaphor

=== Typology by Paul (1880) ===
* Generalization: enlargement of single senses of a word's meaning
* Specialization on a specific part of the contents: reduction of single senses of a word's meaning
* Transfer on a notion linked to the based notion in a spatial, temporal, or causal way

=== Typology by Darmesteter (1887) ===
* Metaphor
* Metonymy
* Narrowing of meaning
* Widening of meaning
The last two are defined as change between whole and part, which would today be rendered as ''synecdoche''.

=== Typology by Bréal (1899) ===
* Restriction of sense: change from a general to a special meaning
* Enlargement of sense: change from a special to a general meaning
* Metaphor
* "Thickening" of sense: change from an abstract to a concrete meaning

=== Typology by Stern (1931) ===
* Substitution: Change related to the change of an object, of the knowledge referring to the object, of the attitude toward the object, e.g., ''artillery'' "engines of war used to throw missiles" → "mounted guns", ''atom'' "inseparable smallest physical-chemical element" → "physical-chemical element consisting of electrons", ''scholasticism'' "philosophical system of the Middle Ages" → "servile adherence to the methods and teaching of schools"
* Analogy: Change triggered by the change of an associated word, e.g., ''fast'' adj. "fixed and rapid" ← ''faste'' adv. "fixedly, rapidly")
* Shortening: e.g., ''periodical'' ← ''periodical paper''
* Nomination: "the intentional naming of a referent, new or old, with a name that has not previously been used for it" (Stern 1931: 282), e.g., ''lion'' "brave man" ← "lion"
* Regular transfer: a subconscious Nomination
* Permutation: non-intentional shift of one referent to another due to a reinterpretation of a situation, e.g., ''bead'' "prayer" → "pearl in a rosary")
* Adequation: Change in the attitude of a concept; distinction from substitution is unclear.
This classification does not neatly distinguish between processes and forces/causes of semantic change.

=== Typology by Ullmann (1957, 1962) ===
Ullmann distinguishes between nature and consequences of semantic change:
* Nature of semantic change
** [[Metaphor]]: change based on a similarity of senses
** [[Metonymy]]: change based on a contiguity of senses
** [[Folk-etymology]]: change based on a similarity of names
** [[Ellipsis (linguistics)|Ellipsis]]: change based on a contiguity of names
* Consequences of semantic change
** Widening of meaning: rise of quantity
** Narrowing of meaning: loss of quantity
** Amelioration of meaning: rise of quality
** Pejoration of meaning: loss of quality

[[File:Studying (2759729091).jpg|thumb]]
'''Test preparation''' (abbreviated '''test prep''') or '''exam preparation''' is an educational course, [[tutoring]] service, educational material, or a learning tool designed to increase [[student]]s' performance on [[standardized test]]s. Examples of these tests include [[entrance examination]]s used for admissions to institutions of [[higher education]], such as [[college admission|college]] (e.g. the [[SAT]] and [[ACT (test)|ACT]]), [[business school]] (the [[GMAT]]), [[law school]] (the [[LSAT]] or [[LNAT]]), [[medical school]] (the [[MCAT]]), [[BMAT]], [[UKCAT]] and [[GAMSAT]] and [[graduate school]] (the [[Graduate Record Examination|GRE]]) and qualifying examinations for admission to [[gifted education]] programs.&lt;ref name="NYT021713"&gt;{{cite news|title=Schools Ask: Gifted or Just Well-Prepared?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/nyregion/new-york-city-schools-struggle-to-separate-the-gifted-from-the-just-well-prepared.html|accessdate=February 28, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 17, 2013|author=Jenny Anderson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preparation Options ==
it is important that before revising a person mind is relaxed for example playing playstation or xbox before revision is important. also during revision it is important because cramming too much revision is not helpful. a person should revise in 2:1 ratio so 1 hour of relaxing and then 30 mins of hard working revision. this enables information to be processed in the brain and make it easier to remember next time.
there are many resources and services on which students may draw as they prepare for standardized tests, including: 
* [[Mock Exams|Mock exams]]: Mock exams are practice exams that help students prepare for the real exam. They are intended to give students a clear indication of the structure and content of the actual exam, as well as a snapshot of their current performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/2015/dec/03/practice-makes-perfect-why-mock-exams-students-brains|title=Practice makes perfect: why mock exams are great for students’ brains|last=Busch|first=Bradley|date=2015-12-03|website=the Guardian|access-date=2016-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mind map|Mind Maps]]: Mind maps allow students to visually organize relevant concepts and information, showing relationships among pieces of the whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exam Tips|last=Smart|first=Ursulua|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|year=2006|location=|pages=162–166|doi=10.4135/9781446212127.n22|dos=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Study guide|Study Guides]]: Various organizations and individuals produce published materials that students can incorporate into their preparation. 
* [[Course (education)|Courses]]: Many test preparation courses are designed to expose students to the breadth of topics tested on the relevant exam and guide them through the process of studying.
* [[Tutor]]s: A tutor is a person with whom students work one-on-one to improve academic performance, in this case on an exam.
* Study groups: Studying as group facilitates collaboration and exposes students to different perspectives on the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Exam tips|last=Smartt|first=Ursulua|publisher=SAGE Publications Ltd|year=2006|location=|pages=162–166|doi=10.4135/9781446212127.n22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resource providers==
Most companies and educators that offer test preparation services also offer traditional (hard copy) and technology-based learning tools, such as books and other printed matter, software, websites, hand-held devices, or content for such devices. So do most test makers, publishers of self-help, instructional and educational materials, and makers of hardware and software.

===Test makers===
* [[ACT (test)|ACT, Inc.]] - publisher of the [[ACT (test)|ACT]]
* [[American Council on Education]] (ACE) - publisher of the [[GED]] test 
* [[Association of American Medical Colleges|Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC)]] - publisher of the [[MCAT]] test
* [[College Board]] - publisher of the [[SAT]] test
* [[Educational Testing Service|Educational Testing Service (ETS)]] - publisher of the [[GRE]] and [[TOEFL]] tests
* [[Graduate Management Admission Council|Graduate Management Admission Council (GMAC)]] - publisher of the [[GMAT]]
* [[Harcourt Assessment]] - publisher of the [[Miller Analogies Test]] (MAT)
* [[Law School Admissions Council]] (LSAC) - publisher of the [[LSAT]] test 

===Third parties===
* [[Barron's Educational Series]] - publisher of books and educational materials
* [[CliffsNotes]] - publisher of study guides
* The [[Complete Idiot's Guides]] - publisher of instructional reference books
* [[For Dummies]] - publisher of instructional/reference books 
* [[Gary Gruber]] - educator and author
* [[McGraw-Hill]] - publisher of books and educational materials 
* [[Peterson's]] - publisher of books and educational materials
* [[SparkNotes]] - publisher of study guides
* [[Study Notes]] - publisher of study guides
* [[Texas Instruments]] - technology company that offers test-maker approved calculators and a variety of test preparation and test-taking tools
* [[Magoosh]] - online test preparation service

==Criticism==
Some test-preparation programs have been proven to help students improve test scores, &lt;ref&gt;[[American Book Company (1996)|American Book Company]] [http://www.americanbookcompany.com/valstudy.html Validation Study]&lt;/ref&gt; but others may have little effect.

Test preparation for the SAT is a highly lucrative field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/682204/2009_worldwide_exam_preparation_and_tutoring&lt;/ref&gt;

A lot of people have criticism towards exams and testing in the primary and high school environment, the number one type of testing in Australia that receives criticism is NAPLAN. Parents and teachers have put forward numerous numbers of cases stating the stress it is having on children and how pointless it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vcaa.vic.edu.au/Documents/auscurric/articles/naplan_timeforadeepbreath.pdf|title=Time to take a breath|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The book follows a ship cat referred to only as "Cat" or "Ship's Cat" who serves as a swashbuckling crew member of the English [[privateer]] ship ''Alcestis''. The ship is eventually attacked by Spanish seamen, who capture the ship and its entire crew, who they take to the [[Panamanian]] port of [[Chagres]]. The cat is also imprisoned, only to be freed by the [[Prison officer|gaoler's]] daughter, who puts him to work in the officer's kitchen. There he waits until he has the perfect opportunity to free his crew. This opportunity arises on [[Philip the Apostle|Saint Philip's Day]], as the gaoler and his friends use it as an excuse to drink until they are very [[Alcohol intoxication|intoxicated]]. The cat frees his shipmates and together they manage to steal a ship, with the intent to sail back to England. Their acts are soon detected by the gaoler and his friends, who give chase until they come across [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]], who is just starting on his [[Francis Drake|expedition to circumnavigate the globe]]. Free of their pursuers, the cat reveals to the rest of the crew that their stolen ship contained treasure, to the crew's joy. The book ends with the crew returning home, where [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] knights the cat for his [[Courage|valor]].

== Reception ==
The ''West Coast Review of Books'' rated ''The Ship's Cat'' at three stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hjAuAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Ship%27s+Cat%22+Adams&amp;dq=%22Ship%27s+Cat%22+Adams&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ1eeO0sfNAhXBWD4KHRqoDIQ4ChDoAQglMAI|title=Review: The Ship's Cat|date=1977-01-01|publisher=West Coast Review of Books/Rapport Publishing Company|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6057">'''Urban Interventionism''' is a name sometimes given to a number of different kinds of activist design and art practices, art that typically responds to the social community, locational identity, the built environment, and public places. The goals are often to create new awareness of social issues, and to stimulate community involvement. Such practices have a history that includes certain street artists of the 1960s, such as The [[Diggers (theater)|Diggers]] of San Francisco, or the [[Provo (movement)|Provos]] of Amsterdam, among many others.

Contemporary artists often associated with urban interventionist practices are  [[Daniel Buren]], [[Gordon Matta-Clark]], [[Mierle Laderman Ukeles]], [[Krzysztof Wodiczko]],&lt;ref&gt;''Theatre, Theory, Postmodernism,'' by Johannes H. Birringer, Indiana University Press, 1991. p 38.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Hirschhorn]], [[Francis Alÿs]], [[Harrell Fletcher]], the [[Red Peristyle]] group, [[Banksy]] and many others.

== Social and spatial  ==
Urban Interventionism has been associated with a changed understanding of the relationship between the social and the spatial, called the "spatial turn" of the arts and sciences in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Soja, E. Postmodern geographies: the reassertion of space in critical social theory. Verso, London and New York. 1989&lt;/ref&gt; In this turn a new viewpoint was taken on public and urban spaces "...whereby urban spaces are seen not merely as containers for or outcomes of social processes, but as a medium through which they unfold and as having constitutive significance {{sic|themselve}}."&lt;ref name=pinder /&gt; According to this train of thought the spatial sights of a city have the power to shape interactions and create new experiences. This power is utilized by urban interventions through the works created by the artists.

== Ideology ==
Urban interventionism often target local communities as their targets. There are different strands of activity within urban interventionism. While mostly activistic, many artists have different focus points. George Yúdice, Professor of American Studies Program
and of Spanish and Portuguese at [[New York University]], defines the term as referring to "public or participatory art through which publics constitute themselves and experience something extraordinary in the process.&lt;ref&gt;''The Heuristics of Contemporary Urban Art Interventions Dimension,'' from introduction to "Urban Interventions: A Symposium on Art and the City," York University, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The famous street artist [[Banksy]], for example, has done a few famous urban interventions. Some of these are political statements, like his [http://www.stencilrevolution.com/banksy-art-prints/flying-balloons-girl/ stencil] of a girl using balloons filled with helium to float over the wall between Palestine and Israel.   Professor David Pinder of the [[University of London]] stated that urban interventions are often specifically directed towards the urban space that it is situated in: ''"(urban interventions)...are typically concerned less with representing political issues than with intervening in urban spaces so as to question, refunction and contest prevailing norms and ideologies, and to create new meanings, experiences, understandings, relationships and situations.''"&lt;ref name=pinder&gt;Pinder, David. Urban Interventions: Art, Politics and Pedagogy. International Journal of Urban and Regional Research. Volume 32.3, September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a more situational urban intervention is the [http://RedBall%20project RedBall project] by [[Kurt Perschke]]. The project consists of a large inflatable red ball that has been set up at many different sites worldwide, providing a new engaging space for people to interact with.

== Disciplines ==
Much of the work is multidisciplinary and intermedial, combining art forms or creating works that are hard to classify. Artists working in this international vein often utilize outdoor video projection, found objects, sculptural artifacts, posters, and performance events that might include and involve passersby on the street. Urban interventions are not first objects to pursue the creation of meaning in urban space through the combination of art forms, and they have been linked to artists and philosophers of the 1960's. In 1968 philosopher and sociologist [[Henri Lefebvre]] wrote the ''Le Droit à la ville'' ([[Right to the city|Right to the City]]), in which he states that: 
: "''To put art at the service of the urban does not mean to prettify urban space with works of art. This parody of the possible is a caricature. Rather, this means that time-spaces become works of art and that former art reconsiders itself as source and model of appropriation of space and time.''"&lt;ref&gt;Lefebvre, H. Right to the city. In H. Lefebvre, Writings on cities, E. Kofman and E. Lebas (trans. and eds.), Blackwell, Oxford [originally published in French]. 1996 (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

This also echoes other art forms that are connected to urban interventionalism like the 1960's [[Happening]]s and [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[Gesamtkunstwerk]]. These also saw urban space as a medium, bringing art into peoples' daily lives.

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Vampire Knight characters}}
Yuki's earliest memory is of a stormy night in winter, where she was attacked by a rogue vampire and rescued by Kaname Kuran, a Pureblood vampire. Now ten years later, Yuki Cross, the adopted daughter of the headmaster of Cross Academy, Kaien Cross, has grown up and become a guardian of the vampire race, protecting her childhood crush, Kaname, from discovery as he leads a group of vampires at the elite boarding school. At her side is Zero Kiryu, a childhood friend whose hatred for the creatures that destroyed everything he held dear leaves him determined never to trust them. This coexisting arrangement seems all well and good, but have the vampires truly renounced their murderous ways, or is there a darker truth behind their actions? In this world of secrets, nothing is as it seems. The price of misplaced trust may even be worse than death. Should Yuki truly find out what was in her past, is the truth going to hurt her worse than not knowing?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9742">The '''Vienna Ice Revue''' (Wiener Eisrevue) was an internationally highly successful ice show based upon Austria's great figure-skating tradition, presenting a large number of world-class figure skaters mainly from Vienna from 1945 to 1971. Representing a Viennese style, the Vienna Ice Revue was different from the competitor enterprise [[Holiday On Ice]]. In 1971 the Vienna Ice Revue was sold to Holiday On Ice and put on the back burner two years later.

== The roots ==
The Wiener Eisrevue (Vienna Ice Revue) had its roots in the success story of Austrian figure skaters before World War II.&lt;ref&gt;As a matter of fact, Austrian skaters won the most World titles in figure skating before World War II. In male single skating, Austrian skaters won 19 World titles before World War II - that was more than a half of all World titles awarded before World War II.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Karl Schäfer]], winner of eight European titles, seven World titles and two Olympic gold medals, was the most successful of these skaters.  He had a show that was named after him, the Karl Schäfer-Eisrevue, which also played a major role in the movie “Der weiße Traum” (“The White Dream”) in 1943. From an artistic point of view, this show was the forerunner of the Vienna Ice Revue.

== The show's ''creator'' Will Petter and composer Robert Stolz ==
In 1945, some months after the ending of World War II, the Wiener Eisrevue was founded. Will Petter, the “creator” of the Vienna Ice Revue, and his wife Edith who evolved into the revue's choreographer, carried out their idea of replacing “cold spots” with a story line. In 1952, [[Robert Stolz]] began to transpose this concept into music. He was destined to compose 19 “ice operettas” for the Vienna Ice Revue. Music by other composers was also integrated into the program. Most notably, the Blue Danube Waltz by [[Johann Strauß]] was played at the end of most productions. In one of the first New Year's Concerts with the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra to be broadcast on TV, the Vienna Ice revue danced one of the waltzes.

== Touring through Europe ==
The Vienna Ice Revue toured through most European countries including Switzerland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Italy, France and Spain. In 1953, the show made its first appearance in North Africa (Algier and Oran). Adolf Eder was the commercial director. In the middle of the 1950s, the Vienna Ice Revue was one of  the first “Western” institutions to appear in Moscow, Kiev and Leningrad following World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Russian programs of the Vienna Ice Revue in the 1950s - - - Wiener Zeitung (January 23rd, 2004), Die traditionsreiche Geschichte der Wiener Eisrevue: Operetten auf Eis&lt;/ref&gt;  In Berlin, Antwerp and Moscow, the program was shown annually about 50 times in each city with an audience of about 10,000 people watching each performance. Later, the Vienna Ice Revue also toured Israel and the United States.

== Figure skaters mainly from Austria ==
Many world-famous figure skaters from Austria starred in the Vienna Ice Revue such as Olympic runner-up [[Eva Pawlik]] (as a single skater and together with Rudi Seeliger as a couple), Olympic runner-up Helmut Seibt, European-, World- and Olympic Champions [[Sissy Schwarz]] and [[Kurt Oppelt]], Olympic bronze medalist [[Ingrid Wendl]], World runner-up Champion [[Hanna Eigel]], Olympic runner-up [[Regine Heitzer]] and World Champion [[Emmerich Danzer]]. World-class figure skaters from Germany that starred in the Vienna Ice Revue were World Champions [[Marika Kilius]] and [[Hans-Jürgen Bäumler]] and Olympic Champion [[Manfred Schnelldorfer]].

== Three European Champions from Austria in one show ==
From the fall of 1958 to the spring of 1960, the Vienna Ice Revue presented three World runner-up champions and European champions from Austria in one show: ''Eva Pawlik'', Hanna Eigel and ''Ingrid Wendl'', who made her debut as a professional skater in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Ingid Wendl, Eis mit Stil. Vienna 1979, page 149 - - - Arbeiterzeitung, Dec. 25th, 1958: „Die Wiener Eisrevue – beinahe ein Staatsakt“ - - - Die Presse, Jan. 16th, 1958: „Berliner Luft und die Wiener Eisrevue“ - - - Wiener Zeitung, Dec.30th, 1995: „Auch die Wiener Eisrevue wäre heute 50.

== Movies featuring the Vienna Ice Revue ==
[[Spring on Ice]] ''("Frühling auf dem Eis")'', produced in 1950, was the first movie presenting the Vienna Ice Revue. [[Eva Pawlik]] played the main role on the ice and in the frame story together with Austrian actors Hans Holt, Harry Fuß, Oskar Sima, Heinz Conrads and Albin Skoda. Further figure-skating stars presented in this movie: Emmy Puzinger, Hellmut May, Rudi Seeliger, Erni Zlam, Edith Petter and ice clown Bertl Capek.

Symphony in Gold ("''Symphonie in Gold''"), produced in 1956, presented the European bronze medalist [[Emmy Puzinger]] together with [[Fernand Leemans]] from Belgium and [[Jiřína Nekolová]] from Czechoslovakia who had finished fourth at the 1948 Olympics.

The movie Revue of Dreams ("''Traumrevue''"), produced in 1959, is a historical figure-skating document showing three European champions on the ice, with two of them performing in the frame story. [[Eva Pawlik]] played the role of a fictitious Hungarian figure-skating star. Besides, she was actress Waltraut Haas´ double on the ice. [[Ingrid Wendl]] was the second ice star who also played a role in the frame-story. The third European Champion of the Vienna Ice Revue ensemble presented in this movie was Hanna Eigel. Further figure-skating stars presented in this movie: Emmy Puzinger, Fernand Leemans, Rudi Seeliger, Inge and Willi Schilling, Charlotte Michiels and the ice clowns Herbert Bobek and Pieter van Gils.

In the movies ''[[Kauf dir einen bunten Luftballon]]'', produced in 1960, and A Star Is Falling From The Sky ("''Ein Stern fällt vom Himmel''"), produced in 1961, German Champion [[Ina Bauer (figure skater)|Ina Bauer]] played the main role on the ice and in the frame story together with Austrian thrice Olympic skiing Champion [[Toni Sailer]].

In the movies The Great Free Programme ("''Die große Kür''"), produced in 1964, and The Great Happiness ("''Das große Glück''"), produced in 1967, twice World Champions and Olympic runners-up [[Marika Kilius]] and [[Hans-Jürgen Bäumler]] were the main stars on the ice and in the frame story. Further figure-skating stars presented in these movies: Emmy Puzinger and Fernand Leemans, [[Ingrid Wendl]], Helmut Löfke and Norbert Felsinger.

== The show's expiration ==
In 1971, the Vienna Ice Revue slid into a dangerous financial crisis.  [[Morris Chalfen]], the boss of [[Holiday On Ice]], bought the enterprise. The Vienna Ice Revue went on dancing under American leadership for two years before the show was finally put on the back burner.

The '''Windsor Beauties''' are a famous collection of paintings by [[Peter Lely|Sir Peter Lely]], painted in the early to mid-1660s.  The name stems from the original location of the collection, which was housed in the Queen's bedchamber in [[Windsor Castle]]. They can now be seen at [[Hampton Court Palace]].

==The Portraits==
The [[Royal Collection]] includes 10 portraits as part of the set.  They show the women at three-quarter length in various poses.  Some women wear current fashions;  others are draped in loose robes intended to evoke classical antiquity.

==List of "Beauties"==
[[File:Lely (1670) - Elizabeth Hamilton (1640-1708).jpg|thumb|Elizabeth Hamilton, Countess of Gramont, c. 1663]]
The original set of "Beauties" painted by Lely include, depending on the source:

*[[Princess Henrietta of England|Madame Henrietta, Duchess of Orléans]]&lt;ref name="melville"/&gt;

The portraits for the first 10 names are included at the Royal Collection website as "probably commissioned by [[Anne Hyde|Anne Hyde, Duchess of York]]."

The Duchess of York does not figure in the above list often; but since she was largely responsible for the collection (and choosing the sitters), she was also painted as part of the series.  Possibly a little flattery from Lely was responsible for this.
