{{Gospel Jesus}}
The '''arrest of Jesus''' was a pivotal event in [[Christianity]] recorded in the [[canonical gospels]]. Jesus, a [[preacher]] whom Christians consider to be the [[Son of God (Christianity)|Son of God]], was arrested by the Temple guards of the [[Sanhedrin]] in the [[Garden of Gethsemane]]. It occurred shortly after the [[Last Supper]] (during which Jesus gave his [[Last Supper#Sermon|final sermon]]), and immediately after the [[kiss of Judas]], which is traditionally said to have been an act of betrayal since Judas made a deal with the chief priests to arrest Jesus. The event ultimately led, in the Gospel accounts, to [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus' crucifixion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=matthew+26:14-16|title=Bible Gateway passage: Matthew 26:14-16 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrest led immediately to his [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus|trial before the Sanhedrin]], during which they condemned him to death and handed him to Pilate the following morning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mark+15&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Mark 15 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Christian theology]], the events from the Last Supper until the [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]] of Jesus are referred to as [[Passion (Christianity)|the Passion]].

In the [[New Testament]], all four Gospels conclude with an extended narrative of Jesus' arrest, trial, crucifixion, [[Entombment of Christ|burial]], and resurrection. In each Gospel, these five events in the life of Jesus are treated with more intense detail than any other portion of that Gospel's narrative. Scholars note that the reader receives an almost hour-by-hour account of what is happening.&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;Powell, Mark A. ''Introducing the New Testament''. Baker Academic, 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-8010-2868-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.91}}

==Biblical narrative==
{{see also|Kiss of Judas}}
[[File:Fra Angelico 020.jpg|left|thumb|''The Capture of Christ'' by [[Fra Angelico]], c. 1440, depicting Judas and Peter, cutting the ear of the [[Malchus]], the servant of [[Caiaphas]].]]
{{Death of Jesus}}
According to the canonical gospels, after the Last Supper, Jesus and his disciples went out to [[Gethsemane]], a garden located at the edge of the [[Kidron Valley]], thought by scholars to probably have been an olive grove. Once there, he is described as leaving the group so that he can pray privately.&lt;ref name=Maj169 &gt;''The Synoptics: Matthew, Mark, Luke'' by Ján Majerník, Joseph Ponessa, Laurie Watson Manhardt 2005 {{ISBN|1-931018-31-6}} page 169&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zuck83 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Commentary: New Testament'' edited by John F. Walvoord, Roy B. Zuck 1983 {{ISBN|978-0-88207-812-0}} pages 83-85&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Synoptic Gospels|synoptic]]s state that Jesus asked God that his burden be taken from him, and requested not to need to undergo the events that he was due to, though giving the final choice to God. [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] states that an [[angel]] appeared and strengthened Jesus, who then returned to his disciples. The synoptics state that the three disciples that were with Jesus had fallen asleep, and that Jesus criticized them for failing to stay awake even for an hour, suggesting that they pray so that they could avoid temptation.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;

At that point, [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] [[the kiss of Judas|gave Jesus a kiss]], as a pre-arranged sign to those that had accompanied Judas as to who Jesus was.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt; Having been identified, the officers arrested Jesus, although one of Jesus' disciples thought to stop them with a sword, but cut off the ear of one of the arresting officers.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt; The [[Gospel of John]] specifies that it had been [[Simon Peter]] who had cut off the ear of [[Malchus]], the servant of [[Caiaphas]], the high priest.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt; Luke adds that Jesus healed the wound. John, [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and Luke state that Jesus criticized the violent act, insisting that they do not resist Jesus' arrest. In Matthew, Jesus made the well known statement "[[Live by the sword, die by the sword|all who live by the sword, shall die by the sword]]".&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 /&gt;

The account in the Gospel of John differs from that of the synoptics: only in John do Roman soldiers help to carry out the arrest. Judas leads the arresting party to Jesus, but rather than Judas pointing out Jesus, John has Jesus himself, "knowing all that was to happen to him", ask them whom they are looking for; when they say "Jesus of Nazareth", he replies "I am he",&lt;ref&gt;Note, the word "he" is supplied by the translators; the Greek has "I am", the [[Ego eimi]], which explains why the arresting party is stunned. {{Bibleref|John|18:4|9}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which point all members of the arrest party went backward and fell to the ground.&lt;ref name=Zuck83 /&gt;&lt;ref name=CEvans487 &gt;''The Bible Knowledge Background Commentary: Matthew-Luke, Volume 1'' by Craig A. Evans 2003 {{ISBN|0-7814-3868-3}} page 487-500&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrest of Jesus and Judas' role in acting as a guide to those arresting him are subsequently referred to by Peter in {{bibleverse||Acts|1:16|NKJV}}.

'''''Awakenings''''' is a 1990 American [[Drama (film and television)|drama film]] based on [[Oliver Sacks]]' 1973 [[Awakenings (book)|memoir of the same title]]. It tells the story of Malcolm Sayer, who, in 1969, discovered beneficial effects of the drug [[L-Dopa]]. He administered it to [[catatonia|catatonic]] patients who survived the 1917–28 epidemic of [[encephalitis lethargica]]. Leonard Lowe and the rest of the patients were awakened after decades and have to deal with a new life in a new time. The film was nominated for three [[Academy Awards]].

Directed by [[Penny Marshall]], the film was produced by [[Walter Parkes]] and [[Lawrence Lasker]], who first encountered Sacks's book as undergraduates at Yale University and optioned it a few years later. ''Awakenings'' stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Robin Williams]], [[Julie Kavner]], [[Ruth Nelson (actress)|Ruth Nelson]], [[John Heard (actor)|John Heard]], [[Penelope Ann Miller]], and [[Max von Sydow]]. The film features a [[cameo appearance]] by [[jazz]] musician [[Dexter Gordon]] (who died before the film's release) and then-unknowns [[Bradley Whitford]], [[Peter Stormare]], and [[Vincent Pastore]].

==Plot==
In 1969, Dr. Malcolm Sayer ([[Robin Williams]]) is a dedicated and caring physician at a local hospital in the [[New York City]] borough of [[The Bronx]]. After working extensively with the [[catatonia|catatonic]] patients who survived the 1917–1928 epidemic of [[encephalitis lethargica]], Sayer discovers certain stimuli will reach beyond the patients' respective catatonic states; actions such as catching a ball, hearing familiar music, and experiencing human touch all have unique effects on particular patients and offer a glimpse into their worlds. Leonard Lowe ([[Robert De Niro]]) proves elusive in this regard, but Sayer soon discovers that Leonard is able to communicate with him by using a [[Ouija]] board.

After attending a lecture at a conference on the subject of the L-Dopa drug and its success with patients suffering from [[Parkinson's disease]], Sayer believes the drug may offer a breakthrough for his own group of patients. A trial run with Leonard yields astounding results: Leonard completely "awakens" from his catatonic state. This success inspires Sayer to ask for funding from donors so that all the catatonic patients can receive the L-Dopa medication and experience "awakenings" back to reality.

Meanwhile, Leonard is adjusting to his new life and becomes romantically interested in Paula ([[Penelope Ann Miller]]), the daughter of another hospital patient. Leonard also begins to chafe at the restrictions placed upon him as a patient of the hospital, desiring the freedom to come and go as he pleases. He stirs up a revolt by arguing his case to Sayer and the hospital administration. Sayer notices that as Leonard grows more agitated, a number of [[Levodopa-induced dyskinesia|facial and body tics are starting to manifest]], which Leonard has difficulty controlling.

While Sayer and the hospital staff are thrilled by the success of L-Dopa with this group of patients, they soon find that it is a temporary measure. As the first to "awaken", Leonard is also the first to demonstrate the limited duration of this period of "awakening". Leonard's tics grow more and more prominent and he starts to shuffle more as he walks, and all of the patients are forced to witness what will eventually happen to them. He soon begins to suffer full body spasms and can hardly move. Leonard puts up well with the pain, and asks Sayer to film him, in hopes that he would someday contribute to research that may eventually help others. Leonard acknowledges what is happening to him and has a last lunch with Paula where he tells her he cannot see her anymore. When he is about to leave, Paula dances with him, and for this short period of time his spasms disappear. Leonard and Sayer reconcile their differences, but Leonard returns to his catatonic state soon after. The other patients' fears are similarly realized as each eventually returns to catatonia no matter how much their L-Dopa dosages are increased.

Sayer tells a group of grant donors to the hospital that although the "awakening" did not last, another kind — one of learning to appreciate and live life — took place. For example, he himself overcomes his painful shyness and asks Nurse Eleanor Costello ([[Julie Kavner]]) to go out for coffee, many months after he had declined a similar proposal from her. The nurses also now treat the catatonic patients with more respect and care, and Paula is shown visiting Leonard. The film ends with Sayer standing over Leonard behind a Ouija board, with his hands on Leonard's hands, which are on the planchette. "Let's begin," Sayer says.

==Production==
Principal photography for ''Awakenings'' began on October 16, 1989 at the functioning Kingsboro Psychiatric Center in [[Brooklyn, New York]] and lasted until February 16, 1990. According to Williams, actual patients were used in the filming of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Robin Williams Interview on the Tonight Show, 1991|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqdSagycCWc|work=[[Tonight Show]]|publisher=[[NBC]]|accessdate=February 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to Kingsboro, sequences were also filmed at the [[New York Botanical Garden]], [[Julia Richman High School]], the Casa Galicia, and [[Park Slope, Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Awakenings Details |url=http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/awakenings/details |work=[[Sony Pictures Television]] |publisher=[[Sony Movie Channel]] |accessdate=February 17, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429161211/http://www.sonymoviechannel.com/movies/awakenings/details |archivedate=April 29, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Awakenings'' opened in [[limited release]] on December 22, 1990 with an opening weekend gross of $417,076.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Awakenings (1990) – Box Office Mojo|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=awakenings.htm|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film then expanded to a [[wide release]] on January 11, 1991, opening in second place behind ''[[Home Alone]]''{{'}}s ninth weekend, with $8,306,532.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Home Alone in 9th Week as No. 1 Film : Movies: 'Godfather Part III' takes dramatic slide from second to sixth place in its third week out.

===Critical response===
The film received positive reviews from critics. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 88% of 33 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 6.7/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1032970-awakenings/ |title= Awakenings |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 74 based on 18 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.metacritic.com/movie/awakenings|title=Awakenings |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate= February 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film a four-out-of-four star rating, writing,
{{quote|After seeing ''Awakenings'', I read it, to know more about what happened in that Bronx hospital. What both the movie and the book convey is the immense courage of the patients and the profound experience of their doctors, as in a small way they reexperienced what it means to be born, to open your eyes and discover to your astonishment that "you" are alive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ebert|first=Roger|title=Awakenings :: rogerebert.com :: Reviews|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19901220/REVIEWS/41223003/1023|publisher=[[Chicago Sun-Times]]|accessdate=February 16, 2013|date=December 20, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' praised the film's performances, citing,
{{quote|There's a raw, subversive element in De Niro's performance: He doesn't shrink from letting Leonard seem grotesque. Yet ''Awakenings'', unlike the infinitely superior ''[[Rain Man]]'', isn't really built around the quirkiness of its lead character. The movie views Leonard piously; it turns him into an icon of ''feeling.'' And so even if you're held (as I was) by the acting, you may find yourself fighting the film's design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|title=Awakenings Review|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,318879,00.html|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=February 16, 2013|date=December 21, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Oliver Sacks]], the author of the memoir on which the film is based, "was pleased with a great deal of [the film]," explaining,
{{quote|I think in an uncanny way, De Niro did somehow feel his way into being Parkinsonian. So much so that sometimes when we were having dinner afterwards I would see his foot curl or he would be leaning to one side, as if he couldn’t seem to get out of it. I think it was uncanny the way things were incorporated. At other levels I think things were sort of sentimentalized and simplified somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Garner|first=Dwight|title=The last curious man|url=http://www.salon.com/1996/12/23/sacks961223/|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon]]|accessdate=February 16, 2013|date=December 23, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Desson Howe]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' felt the film's tragic aspects did not live up to the strength in its humor, saying that
{{quote|when nurse Julie Kavner (another former TV being) delivers the main Message (life, she tells Williams, is "given and taken away from all of us"), it doesn't sound like the climactic point of a great movie. It sounds more like a line from one of the more sensitive episodes of ''[[Laverne &amp; Shirley|Laverne and Shirley]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howe|first=Desson|title='Awakenings'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/awakeningspg13howe_a0b2d4.htm|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=February 16, 2013|date=January 11, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Similarly, [[Janet Maslin]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' concluded her review stating,
{{quote|''Awakenings'' works harder at achieving such misplaced liveliness than at winning its audience over in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maslin|first=Janet|title=Movie Review – Awakenings|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0CE4D6113CF933A15751C1A966958260|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=February 16, 2013|date=December 20, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for three [[63rd Academy Awards|Academy Awards]], including: the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], the [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay]], and the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] (Robert De Niro). Robin Williams was also nominated at the [[48th Golden Globe Awards]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor – Motion Picture Drama|Best Actor in a Motion Picture Drama]].

The Persian journal '''''Baba Shamal''''' was one of the most famous political satire magazines in [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia Iranica, http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ganjai-&lt;/ref&gt; It was published weekly between 1943 and 1945 by Reżā Ganjaʾī (1918–1995). After his return from Europe in 1947, 50 volumes more were distributed.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Elwell-Sutton, “Iranian Press 1941-47,” Iran 6, 1968, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia Iranica, http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/baba-samal&lt;/ref&gt;
Ganjaʾī was a cabinet member and a university professor for engineering. Before and after his publishership Ganjaʾī held some important positions in ministries and in the banking and insurance sector.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia Iranica, http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ganjai-&lt;/ref&gt; He published his articles under the [[pseudonym]] “Donb-al-mohandesīn“.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopaedia Iranica, http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ganjai-&lt;/ref&gt; Many well-known Iranian satirists, poets and authors belong to his supporters and co-workers, i.a. Rahī Moʿayyerī („Zāḡča“), Eqteṣād („Shaikh Pašm-al-Dīn“), Fozūnī („Mohandes-al-Šoʿarāʾ“) and Ṣahbā („Shaikh Somā“).
The journal was widespread in Iran and was characterized by its everyday language and colloquial style. The general [[satirical]] opinion of the authors found its expression in current daily politics which was supplemented by partly colored caricatures and drawings. In general the journal's position was nationalistic, independent and moderate. However, its critique led – under the pressure of censorship – to its suspension in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Elwell-Sutton, “Iranian Press 1941-47,” Iran 6, 1968, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Belgrade Fashion Week''' is a fashion show held in [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] twice a year. It is the largest event of its kind in the country. Attracting international buyers and industry experts, the show has helped launch the careers of several Serbian fashion designers, such as [[George Styler]], [[Ivana Pilja]], [[Ana Ljubinkovic]], and [[Boris Nikolic]]. British designer [[Roksanda Ilincic]], who is originally from Serbia, has regularly presented her collections at the show since 2002.&lt;ref name="vogue.it"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.it/en/vogue-talents/news/2016/12/20/xl-belgrade-fashion-week-serbia/|title=XL Belgrade Fashion Week|date=20 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belgradefashionweek.com/?s=Roksanda+Ilincic&amp;x=0&amp;y=0|title=Search Results for "Roksanda Ilincic" – FashionWeek|website=belgradefashionweek.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italian Vogue]] has called the festival "... the most interesting platform in the Balkans for designers and international buyers".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vogue.it/vogue-talents/news/2017/11/13/belgrade-fashion-week-2017-collezione-primavera-estate-2018/&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
Belgrade Fashion Week was founded in 1996 by Nenad Radujević who is also the festival's director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.it/en/vogue-talents/news/2017/11/13/belgrade-fashion-week-2017-spring-summer-2018-collections/|title=Belgrade Fashion Week and the Spring Summer 2018 collections|date=13 November 2017|publisher=|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fashion.hr/moda/svjetska-moda/intervju-nenad-radujevic-128802.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  The first fashion week to be held in Eastern Europe, it is supported by local media sponsorship and companies such as Textil distribution center and Matrix hair salons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belgradefashionweek.com/index.php/sponzori/|title=SPONSORS – FashionWeek|website=belgradefashionweek.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgrade Fashion Week takes place twice a year, at the end of October and in March, and lasts about two weeks.&lt;ref name="belgradefashionweek.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belgradefashionweek.com/index.php/about/|title=ABOUT US – FashionWeek|website=belgradefashionweek.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is mainly held at the Belexpocentar, a conference hall located in [[New Belgrade]]. Other venues are also employed, such as various galleries for the "Fashion and Art" segment or the Museum of Applied Arts for accompanying exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://style.rs/42-belgrade-fashion-week/51988/|title=42. Belgrade Fashion week|website=style.rs|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vogue.it"/&gt;

The primary goal of the event is to support local talent and young designers by promoting them in Serbia, as well as internationally, and also by combining the artistic and commercial aspects of fashion.&lt;ref name="belgradefashionweek.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belgradefashionweek.com/index.php/press/|title=PRESS – FashionWeek|website=belgradefashionweek.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show also presents designers from Croatia, Slovenia and Macedonia in the "Fashion Scout SEE" contest, which is judged by European fashion industry experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://zena.blic.rs/moda/nevena-ivanovic-predstavlja-svoj-neo-design-revijom-na-londonskoj-nedelji-mode/836fw4j|title=Nevena Ivanović predstavlja svoj Neo Design revijom na Londonskoj nedelji mode|publisher=|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vogue.it1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.it/en/vogue-talents/news/2017/07/17/neo-design-fashion-scout-see-nevena-ivanovic/|title=NEO Design: elegant dresses and futuristic silhouettes|date=17 July 2017|publisher=|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Highlights==
Belgrade Fashion Week features numerous activities that are related to the fashion industry. In 2006, students from Belgrade's [[University of Arts in Belgrade|Academy of Fine Arts]] were asked to present their designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coroflot.com/dijanamacura/MY-Fashion-Design-Class-PROJECTS|title=MY  Fashion Design Class- PROJECTS|website=Coroflot|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a one-off competition was held to design the uniforms of the pavilion staff representing Serbia at [[Expo 2010 Shanghai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cargocollective.com/greenlegs/BELGRADE-FASHION-WEEK-2009|title=BELGRADE FASHION WEEK 2009 - green legs|website=cargocollective.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Belgrade Fashion Week launched project "Zone 45", aimed at showcasing the best designers from the surrounding countries and further developing a fashion scene in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wannabemagazine.com/32-belgrade-fashion-week-koktel/|title=32. Belgrade Fashion Week: Koktel  — Wannabe Magazine|website=wannabemagazine.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, Indian designer [[Manish Arora]] was a special guest at the show, with the support of the Indian Embassy in Belgrade, Etihad Airways and Air Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stillinbelgrade.com/belgrade-fashion-week-35th-edition/|title=Belgrade Fashion Week 35th Edition • STILL IN BELGRADE|date=28 March 2014|publisher=|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Fashion Scout SEE" competition was introduced in 2017. The jury consisted of British fashion editor [[Hilary Alexander]], the Italian director of Rome's "Academia Costume e Moda" Adrien Yakimov Roberts, and Martyn Roberts who founded London's Fashion Scout showcase.&lt;ref name="vogue.it1"/&gt; The winner, Serbian designer [[Nevena Ivanovic]], got to compete in [[London Fashion Week]]'s "Ones to Watch" program, a contest that supports emerging designers. According to [[Hilary Alexander]], the event "...raises the profile of fashion for the whole region – with the winner being awarded the opportunity to show on the catwalk during London Fashion Week and thus potentially be seen by press and buyers from the UK, US, Asia and Europe".&lt;ref name="vogue.it1"/&gt;

In 2017, the show introduced "BFW Choice", a new concept in sales that supports local designers through pop-up shops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraf.rs/zivot-i-stil/moda/2908910-modni-performans-sonje-krstic-bfw-choice-foto|title=Modni performans Sonje Krstić &amp; BFW CHOICE (FOTO)|website=www.telegraf.rs|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, Belgrade Fashion Week had a special show featuring local designers whose clothing lines were purchased by Serbian department store Martini Vesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wannabemagazine.com/revije-istaknutih-domacih-autora-obelezile-trece-vece-42-belgrade-fashion-week/|title=Revije istaknutih domaćih autora obeležile treće veče 42. Belgrade Fashion Week-a — Wannabe Magazine|website=wannabemagazine.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbian pop singer [[Ana Stanic]] performed during the show wearing one of the mentioned designs.

In 2018, several designers from the Belgrade show were profiled at [[London Fashion Week]], in an event called "Belgrade Fashion Week Showcase". In addition, Serbian womenswear designer [[Ana Ljubinkovic]] presented her collection in London's "Ones to Watch" contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fashionscout.co.uk/ones-to-watch/|title=Ones To Watch|website=Fashion Scout|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clusterfacts.org.rs/2018/01/22/belgrade-fashion-week-begins-serbian-talent-and-quality-at-london-fashion-week/?lang=en|title=BELGRADE FASHION WEEK BEGINS SERBIAN TALENT AND QUALITY AT LONDON FASHION WEEK – FACTS|website=clusterfacts.org.rs|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.backstagetales.com/london-fashion-week-ones-watch-ss17/|title=London fashion Week: The Ones to Watch S/S17|date=23 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/shows/spring-summer-2017-ready-to-wear/ana-ljubinkovic|title=Ana Ljubinkovic Spring/Summer 2017 Ready-To-Wear show report|website=www.vogue.co.uk|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/shows/spring-summer-2016-ready-to-wear/ana-ljubinkovic|title=Ana Ljubinkovic Spring/Summer 2016 Ready-To-Wear show report|website=www.vogue.co.uk|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the Belgrade Fashion Week commemorated Serbian fashion designer [[Boris Nikolic]] who had passed away ten years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://belgradefashionweek.com/index.php/program/#|title=Program – FashionWeek|website=belgradefashionweek.com|accessdate=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An award is also named in his honour.

Currington and his bass guitarist were injured.  Organizers had just postponed the concert and were in the process of clearing spectators from the concert area when a storm front hit that caused the collapse.&lt;ref name="CgySunCollapse" /&gt;  [[Environment Canada]] had issued a severe thunderstorm warning for the Camrose area earlier; however, the organizers were not advised until just before the storm hit thus did not alert concert goers of the coming storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Withey |first=Elizabeth |url=https://edmontonjournal.com/news/stage+collapses+Alberta+storm/1853266/story.html |title=Stage collapses in Alberta storm |work=Edmonton Journal |date=2009-08-02 |accessdate=2009-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805064544/http://www.edmontonjournal.com/news/Stage%2Bcollapses%2BAlberta%2Bstorm/1853266/story.html |archivedate=2009-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The final day of the festival was cancelled.&lt;ref name="collapseCNN" /&gt;

'''''Christ in Concrete''''' is a [[1939 in literature|1939]] novel by [[Pietro di Donato]] about Italian-American [[construction worker]]s. The book, which made di Donato famous, was originally published by ''[[Esquire Magazine]]'' as a [[short story]] and was expanded into a novel by di Donato.

The novel was inspired by the death of di Donato's father in a construction accident on [[Good Friday]] in 1923. It tells the story of a bricklayer and his struggle to provide a home for his family.

As indicated by the title, the novel is noted for its rich religious imagery, presented in a largely [[Modernist literature|modernist]] stream-of-consciousness style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fontecchio|first=Mark|title=Italian American Narrative Style: a Study in Pietro di Donato's Fiction|url=http://www.markfontecchio.com/thesis/cover.html|work=College Thesis|publisher=unpublished thesis, University of Vermont|accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adapted into a [[1949 in film|1949]] motion picture, ''[[Give Us This Day (1949 film)|Give Us This Day]]'' (U.S. title ''Christ in Concrete'') and was directed by [[Edward Dmytryk]].

==Plot==
'''I. Geremio''': Geremio and his coworkers are gruesomely killed on the job when the building they are working on collapses. Geremio is swallowed in concrete, which crushes him to death as it dries. Because this accident occurs on [[Good Friday]], Geremio is the "Christ in concrete" of the title.

'''II. Job''': Geremio's pregnant widow, Annunziata, is left with no way to provide for their already-large family. Her brother Luigi promises to help, but soon he himself is injured at work and loses part of his leg. Geremio and Annunziata's oldest son, Paul, tries to find charity from local businesses and from the church, but with no success. He decides to take his father's place as brick-layer, and after a while is accepted by the other workers as having inherited his father's skills; yet, because of his youth, the company pays him only a pittance and Paul overworks himself. In this section, the word "job" is treated like a character and often capitalized.

'''III. Tenement''': Unable to work, Paul remains at home; di Donato uses this section to explore some of the other families in the tenement, including the Olsens, whose daughter Gloria attracts Paul, and the Molovs, Russian Jews whose son Louis befriends Paul after telling him about the death of his older brother back in Russia. Also in this section, Annunziata and Paul visit a psychic, who reassures them that Geremio is watching over and praying for them, and attend the hearing at the Compensation Bureau, which ends indecisively with the construction company blaming the workers for the accident and the insurance company claiming the accident falls outside the bounds of the policies they have with the construction company.

'''IV. Fiesta''': Paul gets a better-paying job as a bricklayer, and later gets a job working on skyscrapers. Luigi comes home from the hospital and eventually marries Cola, providing the fiesta of the title.

'''V. Annunaziata''': The [[Great Depression]] hits, and Paul helps his mentor Nazone get work, only to have Nazone fall to his death after a fight with the foreman. Distraught, Paul tells his mother that he no longer believes in God or in the afterlife, a confession that shatters her and for which he spends the final pages asking forgiveness.

'''Clarence Rivers King''' (January 6, 1842 – December 24, 1901) was an American [[geology|geologist]], [[mountaineer]], and [[author]].  He served as the first director of the [[United States Geological Survey]] from 1879 to 1881. King was noted for his exploration of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].

==Early life and education==
Clarence King was the son of James Rivers King and Florence Little King.  Clarence's father was part of a family firm engaged in trade with China, which kept him away from home a great deal, and he died in 1848, so Clarence was brought up primarily by his mother. By 1848 his only two siblings had also died.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=26-27}}

Clarence developed an early interest in outdoor exploration and natural history, which was encouraged by his mother and by Reverend Dr. Roswell Park, head of the Christ Church Hall school in [[Pomfret, Connecticut]] that Clarence attended until he was ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.buffalo.edu/pan-am/exposition/health/rpbiog.html|title=Biography of Dr. Roswell Park|publisher=University of Buffalo|accessdate=2014-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then attended schools in Boston and New Haven, and at age thirteen was accepted to the prestigious Hartford High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hartfordpublic.com/schoolhistory.htm|title=School History|publisher=Hartford Public High School|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328043442/http://www.hartfordpublic.com/schoolhistory.htm|archivedate=2014-03-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a good student and a versatile athlete, of short stature but unusually strong.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=29-32}}

His mother received an income from the King family business until it met with a series of problems and dissolved in 1857. After a few years of straitened circumstances, during part of which Clarence suffered from a serious depression, his mother married George S. Howland in July 1860. Howland financed Clarence's enrollment in the [[Sheffield Scientific School]] affiliated with [[Yale College]] in 1860.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=35-38}}

== College life and early career ==
[[File:Young Carence King.jpg|thumb|Clarence King as a young man]]
At Yale, King specialized in "applied chemistry" and also studied physics and geology. One inspiring teacher was [[James Dwight Dana]], a highly regarded geologist who had participated in a scientific expedition to the South Atlantic, South Pacific, and the west coasts of South and North America. King graduated with a Ph.B. in July 1862. He and several friends borrowed one of Yale's rowboats that summer for a trip along the shores of [[Lake Champlain]] and a series of Canadian rivers, then returned to New Haven for the fall regatta.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=41-52}}

In October 1862, on a visit to the home of his former professor [[George Jarvis Brush]], King heard Brush read aloud a letter he had received from [[William Henry Brewer]] telling of an ascent of [[Mount Shasta]] in California, then believed to be the tallest mountain in the country. King began to read more about geology, attended a lecture by [[Louis Agassiz]], and soon wrote to Brush that he had "pretty much made up my mind to be a geologist if I can get work in that direction."{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=53-54}} He was also fascinated by descriptions of the Alps by [[John Tyndall]] and [[John Ruskin]].

In late 1862 or early 1863, King moved to [[New York City]] to share an apartment with [[James Terry Gardiner]], a close friend from high school and college (who spelled his last name Gardner at the time). They associated with a group of American artists, writers, and architects who were admirers of John Ruskin. In February 1863 King became one of the founders, along with [[John William Hill]], [[Clarence Cook]] and others, of the Ruskinian [https://web.archive.org/web/20140330082817/http://www.siskiyous.edu/shasta/art/cla.htm Association for the Advancement of Truth in Art], an American group similar to the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], and was elected its first secretary. But he was anxious to see the mountains of the American West, and his friend Jim Gardiner was miserable in law school.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=57-60}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

By May 1863 King, Gardiner, and an acquaintance named William Hyde traveled by railroad to Missouri and then joined a [[wagon train]], which they left at [[Carson City, Nevada]].{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=61-71}}  King and Gardiner soon continued on to California, where King joined the [[California Geological Survey]] without pay, in which he worked with [[William Henry Brewer|William H. Brewer]], [[Josiah Whitney|Josiah D. Whitney]] and later Gardiner and [[Richard D. Cotter]]. In July 1864, King and Cotter made the first ascent of a peak in the Eastern Sierra that King named [[Mount Tyndall]] in honor of one of his heroes. From there they discovered several higher peaks, including the one that came to be named [[Mount Whitney]].{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=119-127}}

In September 1864, upon the designation by President Abraham Lincoln of the [[Yosemite Valley]] area as a permanent public reserve, King and Gardiner were appointed to make a boundary survey around the rim of Yosemite Valley. They returned to the East Coast by way of Nicaragua the following winter. King suffered from several bouts of malaria in the spring and summer of 1865 while Whitney, also in the East, worked on securing funding for further survey projects. King, Gardiner, Whitney, and Whitney's wife sailed back to San Francisco in the fall, where Whitney lined up a survey project for King and Gardiner in the [[Mojave Desert]] and Arizona under U.S. Army auspices. They returned to San Francisco in the spring, and King returned to Yosemite in the summer of 1866 to make more field notes for Whitney. When King heard of the death of his stepfather, he and Gardiner resigned from the Whitney survey and once again sailed to New York. They had been developing a plan for an independent survey of the Great Basin region for some time, and in late 1866 King went to Washington to secure funding from Congress for such a survey.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=149-182}}

== Fortieth Parallel Survey and diamond hoax discovery ==
[[File:Clarence King, Salt Lake City, Utah Camp, ClarenceKingClear.jpg|thumb|right|Clarence King; Camp near [[Salt Lake City]], Utah. The exploration of the Survey of the Fortieth Parallel.  Photo by [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]], October 1868.]]

King made a persuasive argument for how his research would help develop the west. He received federal funding and was named U.S. Geologist of the [[Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel]], commonly known as the Fortieth Parallel Survey, in 1867. He persuaded Gardiner to be his second in command, and they assembled a team that included, among others,  [[Samuel Franklin Emmons]], [[Arnold Hague]], [[A. D. Wilson]], the photographer [[Timothy H. O'Sullivan]], and guest artist [[Gilbert Munger]].

Over the next six years King and his team explored areas from eastern California to Wyoming. During that time he also published his famous ''Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada'' (1872).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.yosemite.ca.us/library/mountaineering_in_the_sierra_nevada/|first=Clarence|last=King|title=Mountaineering in the Sierra Nevada|location=New York|publisher=C. Scribner and sons|edition=tenth|year=1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
While King was finishing the 40th Parallel Survey, the western US was abuzz with news of a secret diamond deposit.  King and some of his crew tracked down the secret location in northwest Colorado, and exposed it as a fraud, now known as the [[Diamond hoax of 1872]].&lt;ref&gt;King, Clarence. 1872. Copy of official letter, addressed November 11th, 1872, to the Board of Directors of the San Francisco and New York Mining and Commercial Company, "... discovering the new diamond fields to be a fraud." San Francisco and New York Mining and Commercial Company. [San Francisco? 1872]. pp. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;  He became an international celebrity through exposing the hoax.{{sfn|Wilson|2006|pp=237-253}}

In 1878 King published ''Systematic Geology'', numbered Volume 1 of the Report of the Geological Exploration of the Fortieth Parallel, although it appeared later than all but one of the other seven volumes. In this work he narrated the [[Historical geology|geological history]] of the West as a mixture of [[uniformitarianism]] and [[catastrophism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://viking.som.yale.edu/will/west/dadess.htm|title=Clarence King's Fortieth Parallel Survey|first=William H.|last=Goetzmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This book was well received at the time and has been called "one of the great scientific works of the late nineteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aalto|first1=K.R.|title=Clarence King's Geology|journal=Earth Sciences History|date=2004|volume=23|issue=1|pages=9–31|url=http://hess.metapress.com/content/rx018782662jv071/|accessdate=16 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140717213511/http://hess.metapress.com/content/rx018782662jv071/|archivedate=17 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, the US Congress consolidated the number of geological surveys exploring the American West and created the United States Geological Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.wr.usgs.gov/outreach/highlights/clarence_king.html|title=A Clarence King Gallery – The First Director of the U.S. Geological Survey|publisher=United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt; King was chosen as its first director.  He took the position with the understanding that it would be temporary, and he resigned after twenty months, having overseen the organization of the new agency with an emphasis on mining geology. He named [[John Wesley Powell]] as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organizing the U.S. Geological Survey|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/circ/c1050/first.htm|website=U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of the Interior|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the remaining years of his life King withdrew from the scientific community and attempted to profit from his knowledge of mining geology, but the mining ventures he got involved in were not successful enough to support his expensive tastes in art collecting, travel, and elegant living, and he went heavily into debt.  He had a busy social life, with close friendships including [[Henry Brooks Adams]] and [[John Hay]], who admired him tremendously. But he suffered from physical ailments and depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aalto|first1=K.R.|title=Clarence King (1842-1901): Pioneering Geologist of the West|url=http://www.gsahist.org/gsat/gt04feb18_19.pdf|website=Rock Stars|publisher=Geological Society of America|accessdate=16 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common law marriage and passing as African-American==
King spent his last thirteen years leading a double life.  In 1887 or 1888, he met and fell in love with [[Ada Copeland King|Ada Copeland]], an African-American nursemaid (and former slave) from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], who had moved to [[New York City]] in the mid-1880s.  As [[miscegenation]] was strongly discouraged in the nineteenth century (and illegal in many places), King hid his identity from Copeland.  Despite his blue eyes and fair complexion, King convinced Copeland that he was an African-American [[Pullman Company#Porters|Pullman porter]] named James Todd.  The two entered into a [[common law marriage]] in 1888.  Throughout the marriage, King never revealed his true identity to Ada, pretending to be Todd, a black railroad worker, when at home, and continuing to work as King, a white geologist, when in the field.  Their union produced five children, four of whom survived to adulthood. Their two daughters married white men; their two sons served classified as blacks during World War I.&lt;ref name="PBS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=129250977|work=American Lives|title=The 'Strange' Tale of Clarence King|publisher=PBS|date=August 18, 2010|accessdate=21 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  King finally revealed his true identity to Copeland in a letter he wrote to her while on his deathbed in Arizona.&lt;ref name="martha"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sandweiss|first=Martha A.|year=2009|title=Passing Strange: A Gilded Age Tale of Love and Deception Across the Color Line|location=New York|publisher=Penguin Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  King's friends John Hay and Henry Adams supplied funds for the support of Ada and her family after his death.

==Death and legacy==
King died of [[tuberculosis]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and was buried in [[Newport, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GSln=King&amp;GSfn=Clarence&amp;GSby=1842&amp;GSbyrel=in&amp;GSdy=1901&amp;GSdyrel=in&amp;GSob=n&amp;GRid=14762735&amp;5 |title=Clarence King (1842–1901)|work=Find A Grave }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kings Peak (Utah)|Kings Peak]] in [[Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sa9SAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c38DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2503%2C5092871 | title=You name it - there's a town for it | work=The Deseret News | date=Jan 22, 1977 | accessdate=18 October 2015 | author=Van Atta, Dale | pages=W6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mount Clarence King]], and Clarence King Lake at [[Shastina]], California are named in his honor, as is [[King Peak (Antarctica)|King Peak in Antarctica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.geographic.org/geographic_names/antname.php?uni=7968&amp;fid=antgeo_112|website=geographic.org|agency=National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency|place=Bethesda, Maryland, United States|date=|title=Geographic Names: King Peak, Australia|quote= Named for Clarence King, the first director of the U.S. Geological Survey, 1879-81|accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="804">'''Concepción de Buena Esperanza''' (best known as '''Concepción del Bermejo''') was a [[Spain|Spanish]] city that existed between 1585 and 1632 in current [[Chaco Province]], [[Argentina]]. During its time it was of the most important cities in Río de la Plata government. Major economical activities were cotton, wax and commercial activities; Concepción was a must step in the road between [[Asunción del Paraguay]] and [[San Miguel de Tucumán]]. Between 1631 and 1632 was attacked by local Indians, who made that local inhabitants leave the city and ran away to [[Corrientes]].

{{2010 Commonwealth Games}}
A number of '''concerns and controversies''' surfaced before &lt;!-- add these only at the appropriate time:, during and after --&gt;the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]] in [[New Delhi]], India, which received widespread media coverage both in India (the host nation) and internationally.

The Commonwealth Games was severely criticised by several prominent Indian politicians and social activists because billions of dollars have been spent on the sporting event despite the fact that India has one of the world's largest [[poverty in India|concentration of poor people]].&lt;ref name="BBCCWG1"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11101288| title= Delhi loses patience with Commonwealth Games | date= 3 September 2010 | accessdate= 22 September 2010 |publisher=Live Mint}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AiyarMINT&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.livemint.com/2007/04/12131220/Commonwealth-Games-irrelevant.html| title= irrelevant to common man: Mani Shankar Aiyar | date= 12 April 2007 | accessdate= 22 September 2010 |publisher=Live Mint}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, several other problems related to the 2010 Commonwealth Games have been highlighted by Indian investigative agencies and media outlets; these include – serious corruption by officials of the Games' Organising Committee, delays in the construction of main Games' venues, infrastructural compromise, possibility of a terrorist attack, and exceptionally poor ticket sales before the event.

==Socio-economic impact==

===Financial costs===
[[File:Azimpremji.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Azim Premji]], founder of [[Wipro Technologies]], remarked that India faced several socio-economic challenges and "to instead spend on a grand sporting spectacle sounds like we [India] have got our priorities wrong."&lt;ref name=Premji/&gt;]]
Miloon Kothari, a leading Indian expert on socio-economic development, remarked that the 2010 Commonwealth Games will create "a negative financial legacy for the country" and asked "when one in three Indians lives below the poverty line and 40% of the hungry live in India, when 46% of India's children and 55% of women are malnourished, does spending billions of dollars on a 12-day sports event build national pride or is it a matter of national shame?"&lt;ref name="BBCCWG1"/&gt;

One of the outspoken critics of the Games is [[Mani Shankar Aiyar]], former Indian [[Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (India)|Minister for Youth Affairs and Sports]]. In April 2007, Aiyar commented that the Games are "irrelevant to the common man" and criticized the Indian government for sanctioning billions of dollars for the Games even though India requires massive investment in social development programs.&lt;ref name=AiyarMINT/&gt; In July 2010, he remarked that he would be "unhappy if the Commonwealth Games are successful".&lt;ref name=AiyarET&gt;{{cite news| url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/Will-be-happy-if-Commonwealth-Games-are-spoilt-Mani-Shankar-Aiyar/articleshow/6222619.cms| title= Will be happy if Commonwealth Games are spoilt: Mani Shankar Aiyar | date= 27 July 2010 | accessdate= 22 September 2010 |publisher=Live Mint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Azim Premji]] called the 2010 Commonwealth Games a "drain on public funds" and said that hosting the high-expense Games in India is not justified given that the country had more important priorities facing it, such as education, infrastructure and public health.&lt;ref name=Premji&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastasiantimes.com/indian-tycoon-slams-cost-of-commonwealth-games.htm|title=愛媛から宅配でジャイアントを高値で買取してもらえました - 自転車を売却した方必見！買取体験談をまとめました|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and environmental impact===
Nearly 400,000 people from three large slum cluster in Delhi have been relocated since 2004. Gautam Bhan, an Indian urban planner with the University of California-Berkeley, said that the 2010 Commonwealth Games have resulted in "an unprecedented increase in the degree, frequency and scale of indiscriminate evictions without proper resettlement. We haven’t seen these levels of evictions in the last five years since the Emergency."&lt;ref name=CWGEconomics&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livemint.com/2009/10/26205604/The-economics-of-the-Games.html|title=The economics of the Games - Livemint|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a [[Right to Information]] (RTI) application filed for study and statements by civil society groups, a report by the Housing and Land Rights Network (HLRN) - an arm of the [[Habitat International Coalition]] - detailed the social and environmental consequences of the event.&lt;ref&gt;The Housing and Land Rights Network (HLRN),"[http://www.habitants.org/news/inhabitants_of_asia/the_2010_commonwealth_games_whose_wealth_whose_commons The 2010 Commonwealth Games: Whose Wealth, Whose Commons?]"&lt;/ref&gt; It stated that ''no tolerance zones'' for [[beggars]] are enforced in Delhi, and the city has arbitrarily arrested homeless citizens under the "Bombay Prevention of Begging Act 1959".m

===Labour laws violations===
Campaigners in India have accused the organisers of enormous and systematic violations of [[labour laws]] at [[construction sites]]. [[Human Rights Law Network]] reports that independent investigations have discovered more than 70 cases where workers have died in accidents at construction sites since work began.&lt;ref&gt;Biswas, Soutik (22 March 2010). [http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/soutikbiswas/2010/03/a_commonwealth_shame.html A Commonwealth shame?]. [[BBC]]. Retrieved on 31 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Although official numbers have not been released, it is estimated that over 415,000 contract daily wage workers are working on Games projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report_commonwealth-games-hc-notices-to-govt-for-violation-of-labour-laws_1339960|title=Daily News and Analysis|accessdate=5 March 2010|date=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unskilled workers are paid {{INRConvert|85||1}} to {{INRConvert|100||1}} per day while skilled workers are paid {{INRConvert|120||1}} to {{INRConvert|130||1}} INR per day for eight hours of work. Workers also state that they are paid {{INRConvert|134||1}} to {{INRConvert|150||1}} for 12 hours of work (eight hours plus four hours of overtime). Both these wages contravene the stipulated Delhi state minimum wage of {{INRConvert|152||1}} for eight hours of work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.paycheck.in/main/officialminimumwages/delhi/minimum-wages-in-delhi-1|title=Minimum Wages in Delhi|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 50 construction workers have died in the past two years while employed on Games projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Magnay | last = Jacquelin | title = Commonwealth Games 2010: disastrous build-up has killed off India's Olympic dream | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/8016654/Commonwealth-Games-2010-disastrous-build-up-has-killed-off-Indias-Olympic-dream.html | newspaper = [[The Daily Telegraph]] | date = 21 September 2010 | accessdate = 25 September 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These represent violations of the Minimum Wages Act, 1948; Interstate Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Condition of Services) Act 1979, and the constitutionally enshrined fundamental rights per the 1982 Supreme Court of India judgement on Asiad workers.&lt;ref name="pudr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.pudr.org/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_details&amp;gid=179&amp;Itemid=63|title=Peoples Union for Democratic Rights Report|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The public have been banned from the camps where workers live and work – a situation which human rights campaigners say prevents the garnering of information regarding labour conditions and number of workers.&lt;ref name="pudr.org"/&gt;

There have been documented instances of the presence of young children at hazardous construction sites, due to a lack of child care facilities for women workers living and working in the labour camp style work sites.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/gallery/2010/feb/02/child-labour-commonwealth-games-india|title=Guardian Photo essay Commonwealth Games construction under labour spotlight | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2 February 2010 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, workers on the site of the main Commonwealth stadium have reportedly been issued with hard hats, yet most work in open-toed sandals and live in cramped tin tenements in which illnesses are rife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/sport/08-commonwealth-games-ts-01|title=The Dawn|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The High Court of Delhi is presently hearing a public interest petition relating to employers not paying employees for overtime and it has appointed a four-member committee to submit a report on the alleged violations of workers rights.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.in.com/news/current-affairs/fullstory-high-court-appoints-panel-to-probe-labour-violation-laws-at-commonwealth-games-sites-12663901-142073-1.html|title=Asia News International|accessdate=5 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the construction of the Games Village, there was controversy over financial mismanagement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/emaar-mgf-gets-rs-700-cr-games-bailout/357815/ Emaar-MGF gets Rs 700 cr Games bailout].

====Child labour====
CNN has broadcast evidence showing children, as young as seven, being used in the construction of the game venues. According to Siddharth Kara, who provided [[CNN]] with the evidence, he documented 14 cases of [[child labor]] within a few days. In reply to a question whether it could have been just a case of kids being present at the construction site along with their parents, he replied: "It's not just kids playing in the dirt or using a hammer as a toy." He further stated about the kids: "They're told to do the work and they just do the work. They don't know that they should be in school or that they should be playing."&lt;ref name="childlabor1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/asiapcf/09/23/commonwealth.games.child.labor/|title=Hard evidence of child labor at 2010 Commonwealth Games|publisher=CNN|date=24 September 2010|accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="childlabor2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1314976/COMMONWEALTH-GAMES-2010-Child-labourers-pictured-working-construction-sites.html|title=After Delhi's disgrace, the shame: Child labourers pictured working on construction sites in frantic effort to get Commonwealth Games stadiums ready|work=Daily Mail|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=29 September 2010|location=London|first=Jonathan|last=McEvoy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though the [[New Delhi]] [[chief minister]] [[Sheila Dikshit]] claimed that nobody had approached her, according to CNN, they had tried to contact her as far back as 23 July 2010. In spite of repeated attempts, according to them, no official reply was ever made.&lt;ref name="childlabor1"/&gt;

===Urban change===

Mitu Sengupta, a professor of politics at [[Ryerson University]], Canada, points out that there is a "tradition of using 'urban spectacles' such as the Olympics and World’s Fairs to enhance a city’s global recognition, image and status, and to push through controversial policy reforms that might otherwise linger in the pending file for years (it is easier to undercut local opposition under the pressure of a fixed deadline and the international spotlight).” She writes that the reforms involved are often "the invention of an affluent, globally connected minority that is relatively detached from local conditions and the local population". The 2010 Commonwealth Games, she says, are being used to invigorate an elite-driven program of urban transformation" that centers on privatization, securitization, and the construction of "monuments to vanity".&lt;ref name=CounterPunch&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.counterpunch.org/sengupta07302010.html |title= The Price of Being World Class |last= Sengupta |first= Mitu |date= 1 August 2010 |accessdate= 22 September 2010 |publisher=[[CounterPunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sengupta expands upon this argument in a subsequent article in [[Z Magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;http://zcommunications.org/indias-games-of-shame-by-mitu-sengupta&lt;/ref&gt; Amita Baviskar, a professor of sociology at the Institute of Economic Growth, [[University of Delhi]], makes a similar argument, on how mega-events, like the [[Olympics]] and Commonwealth Games, are used to advance narrow agendas of urban reform that cater to the middle class and rich. She focuses on how, in preparation for the Commonwealth Games, the city's slums were bulldozed in order to make room for shopping malls and expensive real estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metamute.org/en/Demolishing-Delhi |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070906123108/http://www.metamute.org/en/Demolishing-Delhi |archivedate=6 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sex slavery and prostitution boom===
There has been a boom in the number of young girls, mostly from impoverished parts of India, coming to Delhi after being offered jobs by disguised criminals, only to be taken prisoner and forced into sex slavery. The number of victims is believed to be in the hundreds. Many brothels have been running English courses for sex workers and upgrading their facilities in anticipation of a business upturn during the games.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, Amanda. "Girls lured to games for work being sold to brothels". ''The Australian''. p. 1. 30 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Overseas prostitutes are also expected to come as tourists and ply their trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-17/gurgaon/28230691_1_escort-services-social-networking-gurgaon | work=The Times of India | first1=Yogesh | last1=Kumar | title=Escort services network on sites to score big at Commonwealth Games | date=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One anti-trafficking NGO has claimed that there are reports of 40,000 women being brought in from northeastern India alone. A spokesperson said that recruits from that part of India were favoured because of their lighter skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sify.com/news/concern-over-40-000-northeast-women-hired-for-cwg-services-news-national-kj2s4eedhcj.html|title=Concern over 40,000 northeast women hired for CWG services|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been reported that over 3,000 bar girls in Mumbai have stopped going to work; this has been blamed on an exodus to Delhi for the Commonwealth Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2010/sep/190910-mumbai-bar-girls-cwg-delhi-escort.htm|title=Bar girls answer CWG call in Delhi|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisational failure==

===Vigilance-related irregularities and Over-Invoicing===
On 28 July 2010, the [[Central Vigilance Commission]], an Indian government body created to address governmental corruption, released a report showing irregularities in up to 14 CWG projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=The Economic Times | title=CVC finds irregularities in several CWG projects | url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/CVC-finds-irregularities-in-several-CWG-projects/articleshow/6229429.cms | date=28 July 2010 | accessdate=1 August 2010 | work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per official reports, in total 129 works in 71 organisations have been inspected.&lt;ref&gt;''Clarification–regarding inspection of works relating to Common Wealth Games.'', report issued by CVC. [http://www.cvc.nic.in/cwgclrf3072010.pdf Download pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The detailed preliminary findings included the award of work contracts at higher prices, poor quality assurance and management, and work contracts awarded to ineligible agencies.&lt;ref&gt;''INSPECTION OF WORKS RELATED TO COMMON WEALTH GAMES'', report by the CVC, [http://www.cvc.nic.in/cwgpress2972010.pdf Download PDF]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also allegations of widespread corruption in various aspects of organising the games including procurement and awarding contracts for constructing the game venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=NDTV India | title=Corruption scandal hits 2010 Games, organisers deny charges | url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/corruption-scandal-hits-2010-games-organisers-deny-charges-40991 | date=31 July 2010 | accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commonwealth Games Organising Committee on 5 August 2010 suspended joint director T S Darbari and M Jayachandran following the report of the three-member panel which was probing the financial irregularities related to the Queen's Baton Relay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=ibnlive | title=3 Kalmadi aides sacked from games panel | url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/senior-cwg-official-darbari-sacked/128262-5-23.html?from=tn | date=5 August 2010 | accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, Organising Committee treasurer Anil Khanna resigned from the post in the wake of allegations that his son's firm had secured a contract for laying synthetic courts at a tennis stadium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=timesofindia | title=Games scam: Kalmadi aide T S Darbari sacked | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/events-tournaments/commonwealth-games/top-stories/Games-scam-Kalmadi-aides-Darbari-Mohindroo-sacked/articleshow/6261909.cms | date=5 August 2010 | accessdate=5 August 2010 | work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[GlobalPost]] news agency reports that scandals have come to light, such as "shadowy off-shore firms, forged emails, inexplicable payments to bogus companies and inflated bills – for every purchase from toilet paper to treadmills."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/india/100812/new-delhi-commonwealth-games-corruption |title=Commonwealth Games &amp;#124; New Delhi &amp;#124; India Corruption |publisher=Globalpost.com |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the alleged corruption and defrauding of the games budget, toilet paper rolls valued at $2 were costed at $80, $2 soap dispensers at $60, $98 mirrors at $220, $11,830 altitude training simulators at $250,190.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-08-19/toilet-paper-scandal-in-india-shames-commonwealth-games-host.html |title=Toilet-Paper Scandal in India 'Shames' Commonwealth Games Host |publisher=BusinessWeek |date=19 August 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation delays===
In September 2009, CGF chief Mike Fennell reported that the games were at risk of falling behind schedule and that it was "reasonable to conclude that the current situation poses a serious risk to the Commonwealth Games in 2010". A report by the [[Indian Government]] released several months prior found that construction work on 13 out of the 19 sports venues was behind schedule.&lt;ref name="bbc_cg"&gt;{{Cite news|title=India admits 2010 Games problems|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8256127.stm|publisher=BBC | date=15 September 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chief of the Indian Olympic Association shri Narendra Modi has also expressed his concerns regarding the current state of affairs. Singh has called for the revamp of the Organising Committee commenting that India now has to "retrieve the games".&lt;ref name="reuters_cg"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Olympic official calls for revamp of Delhi Games committee|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/topNews/idINIndia-42471320090915|publisher=Reuters | date=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Indian officials have also expressed dismay at the ongoing delays but they have stated that they are confident that India will successfully host the games and do so on time.&lt;ref name="telegraph_cg"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Delhi Commonwealth Games 'at grave risk of collapse'|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/india/6190118/Delhi-Commonwealth-Games-at-grave-risk-of-collapse.html|author=Dean Nelson|work=Telegraph| location=London | date=15 September 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardian_cg"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Only a year to run – and Delhi is losing race to host Commonwealth Games|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article6834446.ece|author=Jeremy Page|publisher=Times Online | location=London | date=15 September 2009 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Times of India]] reports, all CWG projects were to be completed by May 2009 and the last year should have been kept for trial runs. The newspaper further reports that the first stadium was handed over for trial runs in July 2010 only.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author=Times of India | title=14 Commonwealth Games projects under CBI, CVC scanner | url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-07-29/india/28291275_1_cvc-scanner-cwg-projects-commonwealth-games | date=29 July 2010 | accessdate=1 August 2010 | work=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; To put the delays in perspective, [[Beijing National Stadium]] was completed much ahead of schedule for the [[2008 Summer Olympics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Milestones in the construction of the Bird's Nest|url=http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/venues/nst/headlines/n214423642.shtml|publisher=Beijing 2008 Official Site|location=Beijing|date=28 June 2008|accessdate=2 August 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824180648/http://en.beijing2008.cn/cptvenues/venues/nst/headlines/n214423642.shtml|archivedate=24 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the venues for [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London are scheduled to be delivered one year before the games and the construction of the venues is on track.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=London 2012 progress report: Will Britain deliver on Olympic promises?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jul/27/london-2012-progress-report-deliver-promises|author=Owen Gibson|publisher=Guardian UK| location=London| date=27 July 2010 | accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2010, the Cabinet Secretariat took a decision to appoint 10 officers of the rank of Joint and Additional Secretaries to oversee the progress of the construction of stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Kalmadi's wings clipped, Government takes control of Games panel|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/kalmadis-wings-clipped-government-takes-control-of-games-panel-45705|author=NDTV|publisher=NDTV|date=19 August 2010|accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each officer is allocated a stadium and given the responsibility to ensure that the work completes in time for the games.

===Mass volunteer walkout===
Around 10,000 of the 22,000 selected volunteers quit, less than a week before the event. This has been blamed on a lack of training for personnel, or dissatisfaction with assignments. There are reports that some who have quit have not returned their uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/30/3025846.htm?site=commonwealthgames/2010|title=Thousands of Games volunteers quit: report|date=30 September 2010|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poor ticket sales and attendance===
The start of the Games saw extremely poor ticket sales, with many venues near empty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/8042933/Commonwealth-Games-2010-ticket-queues-a-mile-long-claim-organisers-in-Delhi.html |title=Commonwealth Games 2010: ticket queues 'a mile long', claim organisers in Delhi |work=Telegraph|date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=5 October 2010 |location=London |first=Jacquelin |last=Magnay}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a press conference, organising chairman [[Suresh Kalmadi]] admitted that there were problems, and blamed empty venues on ticket booths not being set up outside stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-10-05/news/27608988_1_tickets-kalmadi-venues |title=CWG: Organisers admit ticket sales blunder |work=The Economic Times|date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonwealth Games chief Mike Fennell admitted that many venues had been nearly empty on the opening day of the Games, saying "A number of venues do not have lots of spectators [...] one area which causes us concern".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11474371 |title=Crowds giving Delhi Commonwealth Games a miss |publisher=BBC News |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=5 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the second day of competition, less than 100 people filled the hockey venue–the 19,000-seat MDC Stadium. Less than 20 people watched the first tennis match of the tournament in the 5,000-seat tennis stadium, and just 58 fans watched the netball opening match.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/10/05/ap/world/main6929789.shtml |title=Empty Seats Plague Commonwealth Games In India |publisher=CBS News |date=5 October 2010 |accessdate=6 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009045019/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/10/05/ap/world/main6929789.shtml |archivedate=9 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One Indian competitor tried to buy tickets for relatives online, only to be informed by the website that tickets were sold out. When he arrived to compete, he found the venue to be empty.&lt;ref name=crad/&gt;

The streets of Delhi were deserted for the cycling road races and walking event. {{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Spectators' response at opening ceremony===
At the opening ceremony, the chairman of the organising committee, Suresh Kalmadi, faced embarrassment, when he was booed by spectators at the start of his welcome speech to 60,000 spectators.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/sport/games-spectators-boo-delhi-chief-organiser-at-opening-ceremony-jd-03&lt;/ref&gt; Kalmadi came under further strain when he "thanked" the late [[Princess Diana]] for attending the opening ceremony of the games. The chairman made the blunder at a press conference saying 'Yes, Princess Diana was there,’ after which he immediately corrected himself by saying 'Prince Charles and (Camilla) the Duchess of Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/58752/princess-diana-was-there-kalmadi/|title=Princess Diana was there: Kalmadi - The Express Tribune|date=5 October 2010|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opening ceremony===
The [[Australia at the 2010 Commonwealth Games|Australian Commonwealth contingent]] expressed frustration over the opening ceremony, in which there were claims that the athletes and delegation support staff were "treated like cattle" and subjected to "disgraceful" and unbearable conditions.&lt;ref name="Opening ceremony"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/commonwealth-games-2010/comm-games-news/athletes-treated-like-cattle-before-opening-parade-20101005-166dy.html|title=Athletes 'treated like cattle' before opening parade|work=Sydney Morning Herald|date=6 October 2010|first1=Jake|last1=Niall|first2=New|last2=Delhi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's chef de mission [[Steve Moneghetti]] complained about the athletes being trapped in "absolute cauldron conditions" under the main stadium before marching for the opening ceremony. The Australians were stuck in a tunnel, where Moneghetti described the temperature as exceeding {{convert|40|C}} due to a lack of airconditioning and ventilation. When attempting to move out, the Australian delegation was stopped by staff. When the contestants were finally able to move out into the arena, they were described as being emotionally affected.

==Racism allegations==

African countries have complained that they are getting second-class treatment from the Games organisers, in spite of them offering India a hand in the preparation of the Games.&lt;ref name="racism1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/cwg-aus-scotland-arrive-africa-cries-racism/131766-5-23.html|title=CWG: Aus, Scotland arrive, Africa cries racism|publisher=CNN-IBN|date=26 September 2010|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have alleged that accommodation given to them was inferior compared to the accommodation provided to the Australian and New Zealand teams. They went on to state that India was complaining about being victims of racial bias in the reporting of the Games; while simultaneously perpetrating the same kind of racism against the African countries.&lt;ref name="racism1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-27/india/28218834_1_african-countries-african-nations-commonwealth-games|title=Racism at Commonwealth Games?

==Infrastructure issues==

===Transport infrastructure===

The [[Delhi Airport Metro Express]] built by [[Reliance Infrastructure]] and [[CAF Beasain]] missed its deadline of 31 July 2010 and the private consortium was fined Rs 112.5&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-01/delhi/28268221_1_dmrc-civil-structures-metro-rail-corporation | work=The Times of India | title=IGI line delay: Reliance subsidiary fined | date=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Venues===
Less than two weeks before the opening ceremony, Fennell wrote to the Indian cabinet secretary, urging action in response to the village being "seriously compromised." He said that though team officials were impressed with the international zone and main dining area, they were "shocked" by the state of the accommodation. "The village is the cornerstone of any Games and the athletes deserve the best possible environment to prepare for their competition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Sanjoy Majumder |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11379020 |title=Delhi Games village 'unfit for athletes' |publisher=BBC News |date= 21 September 2010|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC published photographs of the village taken two days before 23 September showing unfinished living quarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Commonwealth Games: Athletes' village photos |newspaper=[[BBC]] |date=23 September 2010 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9025907.stm |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New Zealand, Canada, Scotland and Northern Ireland have expressed concern about unliveable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rumu| last=Banerjee|agency=TNN |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/news/Commonwealth-Games-Village-unliveable-complain-four-countries/articleshow/6595540.cms |title=Commonwealth Games Village unliveable, complain four countries|work=The Times of India|date= 21 September 2010|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Times of India]] newspaper reports that the Scottish delegation apparently submitted a photograph of a dog defecating on a bed in the games village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=TNN |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/news/Now-smaller-teams-consider-withdrawal-from-Commonwealth-Games/articleshow/6605483.cms |title=Now, smaller teams consider withdrawal from Commonwealth Games|work=The Times of India|date= 22 September 2010|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooper said that there was "excrement in places it shouldn't be" in the athletes' quarters and that members of visiting delegations had to help clean up the unsanitary things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/22/3018287.htm |title=Filth, bridge collapse add to Delhi's woes - Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games News |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC released images of bathrooms with brown-coloured [[paan]] stains on the walls and floor, liquids on the floor, and brown paw prints on athletes' beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9025907.stm |title=BBC Sport - Commonwealth Games: Athletes' village photos |publisher=BBC News |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lalit Bhanot, the secretary general of the Organising Committee, rejected the complaint that sanitation was poor by saying that, due to cultural differences, there are different standards about cleanliness in India and the [[western world]], a statement for which he was widely ridiculed in Indian and international media.&lt;ref name="abcsanitation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abclive.in/abclive_sports/cwg/sanitation_standard_cwg_2010.html |title=Indian Sanitation Standard Vs Western Sanitation @ Commonwealth Games 2010 |author=Ramesh Kapoor |date=21 September 2010 |publisher=[[ABC Live]] |accessdate=22 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923084804/http://abclive.in/abclive_sports/cwg/sanitation_standard_cwg_2010.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhanot went on to say of the athletes' village that, "This is a world-class village, probably one of the best ever."&lt;ref name="abcsanitation"/&gt;

Meanwhile, Pakistan also made reservations over the condition of the athletes' village and asked for an alternate accommodation to be made available to its contingent while preparation was still in progress. The [[Pakistan Olympic Association]] president [[Syed Arif Hasan]] remarked: "We want the CGF to ensure that the athletes' village is in good condition. Athletes cannot stay at a substandard place." Hasan however added that there were no doubts over Pakistan’s participation and the contingent would leave as planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/55385/pakistan-%e2%80%98concerned%e2%80%99-over-athletes%e2%80%99-village/|title=Pakistan ‘concerned’ over athletes’ village|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, England's [[Chef de mission]] [[Craig Hunter]] praised the Games Village, remarking that "the Commonwealth Games Village here [in New Delhi] is better than the [[2008 Summer Olympic|Beijing Olympics]]". He added that the arrangements at the Games Village is much better than that at the 2008 Summer Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Delhi-Games-Village-better-than-Beijing-English-Chef-de-mission/Article1-600985.aspx |title=Hindustan Times - Archive News |accessdate=20 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021070232/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Delhi-Games-Village-better-than-Beijing-English-Chef-de-mission/Article1-600985.aspx |archivedate=21 October 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's sports minister also supported the Games, saying that big events always face issues, and the media often exaggerates them, as Canada found during the [[2010 Winter Olympics|Vancouver Winter Olympics]]. He added that "We are coming in full force."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/commonwealth-games-2010/news/After-delay-in-sending-athletes-Canada-minister-supports-CWG/articleshow/6632480.cms|date=26 September 2010|work=[[Times of India]] | title=After delay in sending athletes, Canada minister supports CWG}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Problems with functionality of equipment and infrastructure during events===
On the first night of swimming, debris landed in the swimming pool, causing delays ahead of a race. It is believed that part of the ceiling or its paint had fallen off.

Before the last night of swimming finals, the filtration system broke down and the pool was turbid and murky during the warmup session and the finals; it was described as the least clear ever seen for a swimming competition. A disproportionate number of swimmers fell ill with intestinal complaints, leading to concerns over the cleanliness and sanitation of the pool.&lt;ref name=pool&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/8053551/Commonwealth-Games-2010-shambles-continue-as-swimming-pool-filtration-system-fails.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first1=Jacquelin | last1=Magnay | first2=Rod | last2=Gilmour | title=Commonwealth Games 2010: shambles continue as swimming pool filtration system fails | date=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early suspicions rested on the quality of water in the swimming pools of the [[SPM Swimming Pool Complex|SPM Complex]], but other competing teams, including South Africa, reported no such illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecr.co.za/kagiso/content/en/east-coast-radio/east-coast-radio-news?oid=938225&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=490476&amp;SA-swimming-team-healthy-and-well |title=SA swimming team healthy and well |publisher=[[East Coast Radio (South Africa)]] |accessdate=14 October 2010 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daily water quality tests were being carried out on the water of the pools, as mandated by the event standards. Additional tests were ordered after news of the illnesses, but they also did not find anything amiss. The Australian team's chief doctor, Peter Harcourt, ruled that the "chances of the [Delhi] pool being the cause of the problem is very remote" and praised the hygiene and food quality in the Delhi Games Village.&lt;ref name="Illness"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/commonwealth-games-2010/comm-games-news/malaysia-camp-blamed-for-swimmers-bug-20101008-16bj1.html | work=Sydney Morning Herald | title=Malaysia camp blamed for swimmers' bug| date=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggested that it could be a common case of [[Traveler's diarrhea]] (locally called Delhi belly), or the Australian swimmers could have contracted the stomach virus during their training camp in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia.&lt;ref name="Illness"/&gt; English Olympic and Commonwealth gold-medalist swimmer [[Rebecca Adlington]] said that the water quality was absolutely fine.&lt;ref name="Did Delhi live up to expectations"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/jamespearce/2010/10/did_delhi_live_up_to_expectati.html |title=Did Delhi live up to expectations? |publisher=[[BBC]] Sport |date=14 October 2010|accessdate=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the opening ceremony, the ground at the athletics arena was damaged, and the grass infield and the track was still being re-laid two hours before competition started.

==Vandalism of Games Village by Athletes==

===Condoms and toilet blockages===
An Indian newspaper during the games reported that used [[condom]]s flushed down the toilets in the athlete's village had caused some drains to become blocked, necessitating action by plumbers to clear the pipes.&lt;ref name="Condoms"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/commonwealth-games/used-condoms-clog-village-toilets/story-fn66fst6-1225935545518|title=Used condoms clog athletes' village toilets in Delhi|work=The Australian|date=7 October 2010|first1=Robert|last1=Craddock|first2=Jess|last2=Halloran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletes under investigation for trashing apartments===
Australian athletes have been accused of vandalizing the towers of the athletes' village they were staying in by breaking furniture and electrical fittings.&lt;ref name="ToICricketLoss"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/cricket-loss-makes-oz-athletes-take-it-out-on-washing-machine/cwgarticleshow/6750851.cms|title=Cricket loss makes Oz athletes take it out on washing machine|work=TOI|date=15 October 2010|first1=Rahul|last1=Tripathi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Delhi Police did not press the case after the Organizing Committee refused to file a complaint while Indian external affairs minister SM Krishna dismissed it as a one-off incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/no-aussie-involved-in-village-hooliganism-crosswhite/cwgarticleshow/6752348.cms|title=Australia slams vandalism charges|work=TOI|date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A washing machine was hurled from the eighth floor of the same tower. Nobody on the ground was hit, but it is unclear who the culprit was. Indian newspapers have reported that the Australian Commonwealth Games Authority agreed to pay for the damages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.rediff.com/report/2010/oct/15/cwg-2010-delhi-australia-apologise-vandalism.htm|title=Aussies apologise for damaging washing machine|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and have apologised for the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cwg.ndtv.com/commonwealth/article/id/spoen20100156718/type/latest/cwg-australian-team-asked-to-pay-for-damages-60010.html |title=Aussies agree to pay damages |work=NDTV |date=15 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018052945/http://cwg.ndtv.com/commonwealth/article/id/spoen20100156718/type/latest/cwg-australian-team-asked-to-pay-for-damages-60010.html |archivedate=18 October 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.rediff.com/report/2010/oct/15/cwg-2010-delhi-australia-apologise-vandalism.htm|title=Aussies apologise for damaging washing machine|work=TOI|date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian High Commissioner rejected the claim, stating that the incident was the result of partying and celebrations.&lt;ref name="ToICricketLoss" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://cwg.ndtv.com/commonwealth/article/id/spoen20100156699/type/latest/Vandalism-Games-Village-Australian-High-Commissioners-59965.html{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}?&lt;/ref&gt; Later comments by Australian officials have contradicted claims by Lalit Bhanot that they had admitted responsibility. Perry Crosswhite said that it was still unclear if athletes from other nations present in the tower at the time had been responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/16/3040128.htm?site=commonwealthgames/2010|title=Officials deny athlete threw washing machine|date=16 October 2010|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety and security concerns==
Small monkeys roam Delhi's streets and prefer heavily urbanized areas with plenty of living space among buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Delhi ropes in monkeys for Commonwealth Games security |publisher=BBC|date=29 September 2010|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-11433539}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cannot be killed because many Indians see them as sacred so instead a larger, domesticated monkey, the [[langur]], is brought in to scare away the smaller monkeys.

On the second day of the games, three Ugandan officials were injured by a malfunctioning security barrier at the games' village, and a senior official from that country raised allegations of discrimination by Indian officials. Uganda's sports minister lashed out at Indian officials and demanded an apology for the accident. The officials had cuts and bruises and were hospitalized overnight for observation.&lt;ref name="Problems still mar Commonwealth Games in India"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101007/ap_on_sp_ot/com_commonwealth_games_problems|title=Problems still mar Commonwealth Games in India|work=[[Yahoo!

===Infrastructural compromise===
On 21 September 2010, a footbridge under construction for the Games near the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium collapsed, injuring at least 23 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = CWG: Bridge collapses near JLN stadium | date = 21 September 2010| url = http://www.zeenews.com/news656584.html | work = [[Zeenews.com]]| accessdate = 21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly workers, underscoring fears of poor workmanship. Commenting on the incident, [[Chief Minister of Delhi]] [[Sheila Dikshit]] controversially remarked that the footbridge was only meant for spectators and not for athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Commonwealth Games 2010 mess: Foot over-bridge at Nehru stadium collapses|url= http://cwg.ndtv.com/commonwealth/article/id/spoen20100153970/type/latest/Commonwealth-Games-2010-mess-Foot-over-bridge-Nehru-stadium-collapses-53751.html|agency= [[NDTV]]|work= NDTV India|date= 21 September 2010|accessdate= 21 September 2010|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100924023819/http://cwg.ndtv.com/commonwealth/article/id/spoen20100153970/type/latest/Commonwealth-Games-2010-mess-Foot-over-bridge-Nehru-stadium-collapses-53751.html#|archive-date= 24 September 2010|dead-url= yes|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the collapse, Fennell expressed concern that conditions at the Games Village, which had "shocked the majority", would seriously compromise the entire event.&lt;ref name="Vancouver Sun"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Scandals, filth give Commonwealth Games sinking feeling|date=21 September 2010 |url=https://vancouversun.com/sports/Scandals+filth+give+Commonwealth+Games+sinking+feeling/3555038/story.html|work=[[Vancouver Sun]]|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company that was building the foot bridge, P&amp;R Infraprojects, was subsequently blacklisted by the Delhi Government and was not allowed to get government contracts.&lt;ref name=the_age&gt;{{Cite news|date= 23 September 2010 |title= Safety cloud over Games venues| accessdate=23 September 2010|url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/safety-cloud-over-games-venues-20100922-15mye.html?from=age_sb|work= [[The Age]]  |author= Wade, Matt |author2=Ker, Peter | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly, progress was still slow and four or five accommodation towers built by [[Emaar]] at the Games village were unfinished, lacking facilities such as wireless internet, fitted toilets and plumbing. In addition, rubble, unused masonry and discarded bricks littered the unfinished gardens. According to sports historian Boria Majumdar, author of the ''Sellotape Legacy: Delhi and the Commonwealth Games'', India "may have to pull a miracle."&lt;ref name="Vancouver Sun"/&gt; The father of Australian track cyclist [[Kaarle McCulloch]] visited his daughter at the Olympic village. A builder in Australia, Grahame McCulloch criticised the structural soundness of the village; he said "those buildings are the dodgiest things I have ever seen...so substandard".&lt;ref name=crad/&gt; He told his daughter not to use the balcony, fearing that it was collapsible.&lt;ref name=crad&gt;Craddock, Robert (7 October 2010). "What games? We just won the cricket". ''The Advertiser''. p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 September 2010, part of the drop ceiling of the new Commonwealth Games weightlifting venue in New Delhi collapsed.&lt;ref name=Aust_2010_Sept_22&gt;{{Cite news| url= http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/games-roof-collapse-report/story-fn3dxity-1225928001831 | title= Games roof collapse - report  | date= 22 September 2010 | accessdate= 22 September 2010 |publisher=[[The Australian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian bantamweight boxer [[Akhil Kumar]]'s bed in the Games village collapsed when he sat on it. "I sat down on my bed to rest but suddenly it gave way. After that I noticed that part of it has no plywood", he said&lt;ref name="Express"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/54986/commonwealth-games-troubles-continue/|title=India tries to put modern face forward for Games|work=[[The Express Tribune]]|date=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 September 2010, a South African athlete reported that a snake was present in his room in the Games Village. A day earlier, animal authorities had to be called in to evacuate a [[king cobra]] from the tennis venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/27/3022745.htm |title=Snake found in Games athlete's room - Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games News |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=19 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October, a large scoreboard crashed to the ground at the rugby venue when a supporting chain snapped. The games however were due to start a week later so no major repercussions were experienced.&lt;ref name="Problems still mar Commonwealth Games in India"/&gt;

===Terror threats===
Following the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]], some athletes and their representative bodies expressed security fears during the games. In April 2010, during the [[Indian Premier League]], two low intensity bombs went off outside the [[M. Chinnaswamy Stadium]] in [[Bangalore]]. Although there were no casualties, this postponed the start of the game by an hour. Following this attack, foreign cricketers like [[Kevin Pietersen]] expressed fears for their safety and questions were raised regarding the safety of athletes during the Commonwealth Games [http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/cricket/3594506/Bombs-hit-Indian-Premier-League-match]. The UK and Canada also warned about potential attacks on commercial targets in Delhi ahead of the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/asia/article7105608.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Attack alerts in Delhi hit plans to stage Commonwealth Games | accessdate=23 April 2010 | first=Jeremy | last=Page | date=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/news/sports/commonwealth-games-security-lagging-behind-20603.php Commonwealth Games security lagging behind].

====Jama Masjid incident====
{{Main|2010 Jama Masjid attack}}

On 19 September 2010, unknown gunmen on a motorbike opened fire with an automatic pistol on a tourist bus outside the [[Jama Masjid, Delhi|Jama Masjid]] mosque in Delhi. The attacks, which came a fortnight before the start of the games, injured two Taiwanese tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/world/03-gunmen-open-fire-at-tourist-bus-in-new-delhi-ss-02 |title=Gunmen open fire at tourist bus in New Delhi |publisher=Dawn |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two hours later, a [[Maruti Suzuki|Maruti]] car exploded in the vicinity, reportedly from a deliberate low-intensity [[pressure cooker bomb]] which had been assembled inside. No fatalities or major damages were reported. The incidents, which were purportedly claimed by the [[Indian Mujahideen]], provoked fears about lack of security in the city for the upcoming games. However, police in Delhi initially denied the role of any organised terror group and instead blamed the attacks on "disgruntled youths and local criminal gangs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=PTI, 19 September 2010, 07.45pm IST |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-19/india/28266145_1_jama-masjid-taiwanese-nationals-pressure-cooker |title=No terror angle in Jama Masjid incidents: Police (The Times of India) |publisher=Timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date= 19 September 2010|accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Officials suggested that a possible motive of the strike was to instill fear in people ahead of the Commonwealth Games.

===Fear of dengue outbreak===

The heaviest monsoon rains in 15 years, along with large quantities of standing water on CWG construction sites as well as in tanks and ponds, raised concerns over increased levels of mosquito-borne disease in Delhi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Delhi's Richest Areas Hit By Dengue as City Prepares for Games|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=12 September 2010|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-09-12/delhi-s-wealthiest-areas-hit-by-dengue-outbreak-as-city-prepares-for-games.html|first=Mehul|last=Srivastava}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the run-up to the games it was reported that 65-70 cases of [[dengue fever]] were being diagnosed each day in the city, with the number of cases "likely to hit the 3,000 mark" by the opening on 3 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dengue cases on the rise |work=The Hindu|date=19 September 2010|url=http://hindu.com/2010/09/19/stories/2010091965210300.htm|location=Chennai, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illness===
Many swimmers were reported to have fallen ill. Initially, concerns were raised over the quality of water in the swimming pools of the [[SPM Swimming Pool Complex|SPM Complex]]. It was said that more than 20 percent of the English team's swimmers – about eight to 10 competitors – had been struck down with a stomach virus. The Australian team also reported that at least six of its swimmers had been sick, including [[Andrew Lauterstein]], who had to withdraw from the 50-meter butterfly. Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell said officials would conduct tests to make sure the pools were not the source of the illness. "If there is something unsafe, you cannot swim in that water. It is a matter we have to deal with a great deal of urgency," he said.&lt;ref name="Problems still mar Commonwealth Games in India"/&gt;

However, other competing teams, including South Africa, reported no such illness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ecr.co.za/kagiso/content/en/east-coast-radio/east-coast-radio-news?oid=938225&amp;sn=Detail&amp;pid=490476&amp;SA-swimming-team-healthy-and-well{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Daily water quality tests were being carried out on the water of the pools, as mandated by the event standards. Additional tests were ordered after news of the illnesses, but they also did not find anything amiss. The Australian team's chief doctor, Peter Harcourt, ruled that the "chances of the [Delhi] pool being the cause of the problem is very remote" and praised the hygiene and food quality in the Delhi Games Village.&lt;ref name="Illness"/&gt; He suggested that it could be a common case of [[Traveler's diarhoea]] (locally called Delhi belly), or the Australian swimmers could have contracted the stomach virus during their training camp in [[Kuala Lumpur]], Malaysia.&lt;ref name="Illness"/&gt; English Olympic and Commonwealth gold-medalist swimmer [[Rebecca Adlington]] said that the water quality was absolutely fine.&lt;ref name="Did Delhi live up to expectations"/&gt;

==Boycott==
Following the withdrawal of [[Dani Samuels]], the women's world discus champion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.smh.com.au/sport/australian-discus-thrower-bows-out-of-delhi-games-20100921-15l6r.html?from=smh_sb| title= Australian discus thrower bows out of Delhi Games
|last= Lane| first= Daniel| date= 21 September 2010| accessdate= 22 September 2010| work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; because "[her] safety [was] more important to them than a medal," [[Minister for Sport (Australia)|Australia's Minister for Sport]], [[Mark Arbib]], said CWG officials expected more competitors to follow suit.

The Scottish team's departure of its first 41 boxers, rugby players, wrestlers and support staff was delayed for 48 hours, and the Welsh team set a deadline of 22 September to receive reassurances that the venues would be fit for purpose. The first batch of English athletes, which included a lawn bowls team and a men's hockey squad, said the organisers were not making nearly enough progress just a day before they were to leave. ''[[The Guardian]]'' suggested a mass walkout remained an option with the "point of no return" less than a week before the scheduled start; they claimed the "main competing countries would be likely to act in concert." They also suggested the games were on the verge of "descending into farce."

Michael Cavanagh, the chairman of Commonwealth Games Scotland, said a decision to stay away would be a joint one, as he insisted a possible knock on effects for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Glasgow]] would not be a factor.  He said "In terms of withdrawal we don't see this as simply a Team Scotland decision, any decision to withdraw we would see as being a collective decision amongst the countries who are already there and already concerned. We can't allow ourselves to be influenced by thoughts of how it may impact on 2014, not when we have something as important as the safety of our athletes to consider."&lt;ref name="guardian"/&gt; [[Phillips Idowu]], the world triple jump champion, also withdrew from the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/sport/report_world-champion-phillips-idowu-pulls-out-of-games-due-to-safety-concerns_1441367|title=World champion Phillips Idowu pulls out of Games due to safety concerns|publisher=Daily News and Analysis|date=22 September 2010|accessdate=24 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Calls for boycott===
Amidst allegations of blatant corruption, shoddy construction work at venues and security concerns for participating athletes, the 2010 Commonwealth Games have faced numerous [[boycott]] calls from individuals in India, England and Australia.&lt;ref name="Bhagat" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DawnF" /&gt;

Within India, there were calls for boycott. Other celebrities who followed Aiyar's comments in expressing a call for boycott include former Indian cricket captain and [[spin bowler]] [[Bishan Singh Bedi]] and bestselling Indian author [[Chetan Bhagat]].
Bedi said the "CWG organisers have taken the country for a ride" and urged international athletes to boycott the "embarrassing" Delhi games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/events-tournaments/commonwealth-games/top-stories/Wonder-how-CWG-OC-slept-for-so-long-Bishen-Singh-Bedi/articleshow/6324637.cms |title=Wonder how CWG OC slept for so long: Bishen Singh Bedi |work=[[Times of India]] |date=17 August 2010 |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cricket.yahoo.com/cricket/news/article?id=item/2.0/-/story/cricket.ani.com/bishen-bedi-urges-athletes-boycott-embarrassing-delhi-commonwealth-games-20100817/ |title=Bishen Bedi urges athletes to boycott 'embarrassing' Delhi Commonwealth Games |publisher=Cricket.yahoo.com |date=17 August 2010 |accessdate=7 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717004245/http://cricket.yahoo.com/cricket/news/article?id=item%2F2.0%2F-%2Fstory%2Fcricket.ani.com%2Fbishen-bedi-urges-athletes-boycott-embarrassing-delhi-commonwealth-games-20100817%2F# |archive-date=17 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhagat, who is considered a youth icon in India with a huge fan following, called the Commonwealth games the "biggest and most blatant exercise in mass corruption since the country won independence six decades ago."&lt;ref name="Bhagat"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/sport/indian-author-blasts-corrupt-games-20100829-13xpb.html |title=Indian author blasts 'corrupt' Games |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=7 September 2010 | first=Matt | last=Wade}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/indian-paperback-king-slams-delhi-games-bribery-20100829-13xmk.html |title=Indian paperback king slams Delhi Games 'bribery' |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=30 August 2010 |accessdate=7 September 2010 | location=Melbourne | first1=Matt | last1=Wade}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhagat, who has sold more than 4 million books in India, also urged his readers to boycott the games event and not to watch them on TV, thereby using the "golden chance" to "put the corrupt and insensitive government to shame."&lt;ref name="Bhagat"/&gt;

The [[Jat people|Jat]] community seeking [[Reservation in India|reservation]] under the [[Other Backward Class|OBC]] quota have also planned to use the Commonwealth games as a platform and force the Indian government to relent to their needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-09-16/chandigarh/28236417_1_cwg-venues-jats-black-flags |title=Quota-seeking Jats to 'flood' CWG venues, disrupt games |work=timesofindia|date=16 September 2010 |accessdate=20 September 2010 |first1=Manveer |last1=Saini}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other countries also threatened to boycott the games. Considering the potential impact of a terror threat and other security concerns, rumors arose about a boycott of the Delhi Commonwealth Games by major participating nations including Scotland, England and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Dailyrec1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/scottish-news/2009/12/31/scotland-will-not-boycott-commonwealth-games-over-security-fears-86908-21933164/ |title=Scotland will not boycott Commonwealth Games over security fears |publisher=The Daily Record |accessdate=7 September 2010|date=2009-12-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZherald1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/sport/news/article.cfm?c_id=4&amp;objectid=10666732 |title=Call for athletes to boycott Games |publisher=[[Nzherald.co.nz]] |date=17 August 2010 |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rumors were soon put to rest by Commonwealth games committees in each of these countries who expressed a general level of satisfaction with the security arrangements.&lt;ref name="Dailyrec1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NZherald1"/&gt;

Australian quadruple Olympic gold medal winning swimmer [[Dawn Fraser]] called for Australia to boycott the games event, citing fears of a tragedy similar to that which unfolded in the [[Munich massacre|Munich Olympics of 1972]].&lt;ref name="DawnF"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Press Association |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/aug/19/australia-commonwealth-games-boycott-fraser |title=Dawn Fraser: Australia must consider Commonwealth Games boycott |work=The Guardian|date= 19 August 2010|accessdate=7 September 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fraser pronounced that reports of missed construction deadlines and other irregularities in games planning meant Indian authorities' "word for providing security should not be taken at its face value."&lt;ref name="DawnF"/&gt; However, the Australian Commonwealth Games Organising Committee was quick to dismiss Fraser's fears with ACGA chief executive, Perry Crosswhite saying he believed there will be no security issues during the games event.&lt;ref name="DawnF"/&gt; [[John Coates (sports administrator)|John Coates]], Australia's Olympic chief, came down hard on the organisers, alleging teams were being forced to temporary accommodation at hotels. "I don't think it is a cultural thing. When you agree to host [the Games], you are required to provide the basics in terms of health and hygiene for the athletes. The Games shouldn't have been awarded to Delhi in hindsight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/asia/2010/09/201092465930139915.html |title=Delhi games controversy continues - Central &amp; South Asia |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=24 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other withdrawals===
A number of athletes withdrew from the Games, for reasons related and non-related to the state of affairs in the days leading up to the event. Jamaican world record holder [[Usain Bolt]] and his predecessor [[Asafa Powell]] pulled out of the event citing the timing of the Games as a major reason for their decisions to stay away.&lt;ref name="Bolt Powell snub"&gt;{{Cite news| last=Stafford | first=Ian | title=Asafa Powell joins Usain Bolt in Commonwealth Games snub | date=2 September 2010 | url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/othersports/article-1305067/Asafa-Powell-joins-Usain-Bolt-Commonwealth-Games-snub.html | newspaper=[[Daily Mail]] | accessdate=27 September 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olympic cyclist champion [[Geraint Thomas]] pulled out for fear of contracting dengue fever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/8825573.stm |title=BBC Sport - Geraint Thomas pulls out of Commonwealth Games in Delhi |publisher=BBC News |date=23 September 2010 |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other notable athletes who have announced their non-attendance include [[Paula Radcliffe]], [[Jessica Ennis]], [[Jennifer Meadows]], [[Natasha Danvers]], [[Chris Hoy]], [[Bradley Wiggins]], [[Victoria Pendleton]] and [[Beth Tweddle]].&lt;ref name="Bolt Powell snub" /&gt;

==Sporting controversies==

===Doping===
Prior to the Games, four wrestlers, a shot-putter and two swimmers who were all part of India's Games squad tested positive for [[methylhexaneamine]]. Four others, who were not picked for the Games in the Indian capital, also failed drug tests conducted at the various training camps across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j49d60QFrmIIU4kvlmohXVrGwoOw |title=India stunned by failed dope tests ahead of Games|date=6 September 2010|work=[[Google News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/BreakingNews/Sport/Story/STIStory_575138.html|title=India's swimmers fail dope test|date=5 September 2010|work=[[The Straits Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Oludamola Osayomi]], the winner of the women's [[100-metre sprint]] event, was reported to have tested positive for a "banned substance" which was later revealed to be the stimulant [[methylhexaneamine]].&lt;ref name=abc_test_fail&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/11/3035197.htm?site=sport&amp;section=all

In July 2011, three of the four women from India's gold-medal winning 400-metre-relay team tested positive for performance-enhancing drugs. Two of the racers, [[Sini Jose]] and [[Jauna Murmu]], tested positive for the anabolic steroid [[methandienone]], and [[Tiana Mary Thomas]] tested positive for [[epi-methandienone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Westhead|first=Rick|title=Storybook win at Commonwealth Games.

===Archery===
While the audience's behaviour at the archery event provoked criticism from the English team, the silver medallist, [[Alison Williamson]], praised it on the other hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9077602.stm | work=BBC News | title=Williamson secures archery silver | date=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier reports held that the English team was upset because the loud chant of the crowd during the women's recurve event had distracted the archers. In an action condemned in the [[Indian media]], an English archery official allegedly abused an Indian coach, telling him to "f*** off." The comment came after the Indian team registered a one-point win over England to claim the gold medal. The Indian archery head coach, [[Limba Ram]], walked over to shake hands with officials of the rival team. In response, an English official showed his elbow in a gesture before uttering the remarks. Britain's archery team leader said she was unaware of the incident and added, "[the Indian coach] must find out whether the person was one among us. If he was not wearing a red jersey, he would not be part of the side. I will speak to the Indian coach about it." [[Limba Ram]] said that he failed to identify the person as he had chosen to ignore the one-off incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sify.com/sports/english-official-abuses-indian-archery-coach-news-others-kkisVJbcdci.html|title=English official abuses Indian archery coach|work=Sify Sports|date=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been accusations that Ram was called a monkey on two different occasions by an English official.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Racism-slur-now-hits-Commonwealth-Games/694899|title=Racism slur now hits Commonwealth Games - Indian Express|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletics===
[[File:Sally Pearson-cropped.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Pearson won the 100m sprint before being disqualified.]]
During the Final of the Women’s 100m sprint final, a controversy was caused by the eventual disqualification of [[Sally Pearson]] of Australia.  She had won the race on the third attempted start after one start was delayed because of excessive crowd noise and the second due to a false start by [[Laura Turner]] of England. Pearson was disqualified because she was deemed to have false-started in the second attempted restart along with Turner. This was as a direct result of a protest lodged by Team England. The controversy was caused as only Turner was disqualified from the race during the race because of a false start and not Pearson. Turner ran the race under protest. Pearson and other athletes were not informed of the protest until four hours after the race, as they were waiting to begin the medal presentation for the race. Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell called Pearson's treatment "unsatisfactory" and that the whole situation was caused by an "unacceptable communications blunder".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9073167.stm | title='Communication blunder' sees Pearson stripped of gold | publisher=BBC News| date=8 October 2010 | accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boxing===
During the weigh-in for the boxing competition, the scales were giving inaccurate readings with athletes recording higher body weights on the official scales. The scales were deemed to be broken and the weigh-in was delayed 24 hours to find and calibrate new scales. The initial wrong measurements led to angry shouting between coaches, athletes and organisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2010/s3029100.htm|title=Boxing row breaks out at the Commonwealth Games|date=4 October 2010|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the boxing competition there have been claims made by various teams including England and [[Botswana at the 2010 Commonwealth Games|Botswana]] that jabs were not being scored by judges. This was attributed to the removal of a white scoring zone placed on the boxers gloves which is usually present in amateur boxing events. The BBC commentating team also claimed there to be a bias in judges scores towards Indian competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/commonwealth_games/delhi_2010/9073167.stm | title=Boxing: latest fiasco in troubled Games | publisher=Reuters| date=4 October 2010 | accessdate=8 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cycling===
During the final of the Men’s [[Keirin]], Malaysian [[Azizulhasni Awang]] was disqualified for aggressive interference when he forced his way past two competitors. Race winner [[Josiah Ng]] said he was "mystified" over Awang's disqualification. In the semi-final round of the [[keirin]], Australia's [[Shane Perkins]] was disqualified for dangerous riding with the official reason not being made clear. Perkins subsequently won the classification race and was described by [[Chris Boardman]] from the BBC to "have aimed an angry V-sign at officials"; he gestured to the judges with his index and middle finger held together.  No subsequent action was taken against Perkins who later said, "the officials need to go back to school", referencing poor decisions he felt had been made in the sprint and keirin events.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/othersports/commonwealthgames/8045839/Commonwealth-Games-2010-David-Daniell-wins-silver-medal-following-keirin-controversy.html| title=Commonwealth Games 2010: David Daniell wins silver medal following keirin controversy | work=The Telegraph| date=6 October 2010 | accessdate=8 October 2010| location=London| first=Brendan| last=Gallagher}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swimming===
On another occasion, South African swimmer [[Roland Schoeman]] came under criticism when he referred to the crowd at the swimming as "going on like monkeys" in a post-race poolside interview. Schoeman's remarks came after he narrowly avoided being disqualified as he and England's [[Simon Burnett]] fell in at the start of the 50m freestyle when distracted by the crowd noise. The swimming has been persistently affected by Indian spectators ignoring etiquette and shouting out while the competitors were preparing for the start.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/commonwealth-games/swimmer-roland-schoeman-in-deep-end-for-monkeys-comment/story-fn66fst6-1225936234884 Swimmer Roland Schoeman in deep end for 'monkeys' comment: The Australian]&lt;/ref&gt; His comment was regarded as possibly being a racial ethnic slur, although he later said that the word was commonly used in South Africa to refer to mischievous behaviour. At an official press conference, organising committee secretary-general Lalit Bhanot took the complaints about monkeys literally. Not being aware of the complaints, Bhanot felt Delhi's wildlife was at issue: "We know especially at the swimming pool there are a lot of monkeys and we have made efforts to keep them away from the swimming pool."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/sport/commonwealth-games/schoeman/story-fn66fst6-1225936210819|title=Swimmer Roland Schoeman slams Aussies over 'monkeys' slur incident|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wrestling===
Australian wrestler Hassene Fkiri was ejected from the 96&amp;nbsp;kg Greco-Roman competition and stripped of the silver medal after making an obscene gesture at the international [[International Federation of Associated Wrestling Styles|FILA]] judges during the final. According to an Australian official, Fkiri was furious at his Indian rival Anil Kumar, who he accused of breaking the rules a number of times in the first period by holding Fkiri around the neck and head with two hands. The Australian received his first warning after he made a comment to the referee as he walked off the mat at the end of the two-minute period; when Kumar repeated the same move in the next round, Fkiri headbutted him and was issued a second warning. He then proceeded to swing his arms uncontrollably afterwards, which resulted in his third warning and eventual disqualification. After losing, Fkiri refused to shake hands with the victor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/commonwealth-games-2010/comm-games-news/bird-brain-how-happy-fkiri-got-leaner-and-meaner--then-stripped-of-silver-20101006-167b2.html|title=Bird brain: how 'happy' Fkiri got leaner and meaner ... then stripped of silver|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=6 October 2010|first=Georgina|last=Robinson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions and responses==
Responding to media concerns, the organisers said there were 48 hours to save the Games after warnings of a pull out.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{Cite news|author1=Jason Burke in Delhi |author2=Owen Gibson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/sep/22/commonwealth-games-crisis-48-hours |title=Commonwealth Games given 48 hours to save itself &amp;#124; Sport |work=The Guardian|date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=23 September 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous [[Bollywood]] actors also expressed their dismay at the state of the Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/commonwealth%20games/now-bollywood-brickbats-for-commonwealth-games-54047 |title=Now, Bollywood brickbats for Commonwealth Games |publisher=Ndtv.com |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four days before the start of the games, tickets for the opening, closing ceremonies, and the 100 m athletics were still not sold out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/29/3025464.htm|title=Thousands of tickets unsold in Delhi|date=29 September 2010|publisher=|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] wrote that despite Kalmadi's "blind optimism", the games were not going to be the best ever. Instead, it wrote that it was "probably the most interesting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-sport/most-interesting-games-ever-20101014-16lly.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | first=Paul | last=Mulvey | title=Most interesting Games ever | date=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2010 Commonwealth Games opening ceremony|opening ceremony]] played a key role in improving the image of the Games. As athletes arrived and competitions started, many earlier critics changed their view. The Australian Sports Minister said that India could now aim for the [[Olympics]], and the President of the [[International Olympic Committee]], [[Jacques Rogge]], said that India had made a good foundation for a future Olympics bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/commonwealth%20games/india-should-aim-for-olympics-australian-sports-minister-57139|title=India should aim for Olympics: Australian Sports Minister|publisher=[[NDTV]]|date=5 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/commonwealth-games-2010/news/Games-good-foundation-for-Olympic-bid-by-India-Rogge/articleshow/6680736.cms|title=Games good foundation for Olympic bid by India: Rogge|work=[[Times of India]] | date=4 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Games concluded, many observers remarked that they began on an apprehensive note, but were an exceptional experience with a largely positive ending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ca.news.yahoo.com/s/afp/101015/sports/cgames2010_aus |title=Australia praises India's 'exceptional' Games |date=15 October 2010 |publisher=[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/jamespearce/2010/10/did_delhi_live_up_to_expectati.html|title=Did Delhi live up to expectations?|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=14 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some observers accused sections of the media of bias, unfair expectations, and negative reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/commonwealth-games-2010/comm-games-news/its-time-to-reflect-on-how-delhi-got-it-right-20101014-16ltt.html|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=15 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010|first=Peter|last=Hanlon|title=It's time to reflect on how Delhi got it right}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within India, the Games saw criticism due to the Games' origins as a celebration of the British Empire, with [[Arindam Chaudhuri]] arguing for India's disassociation from the "slavish games" which he viewed as a "celebration of racial discrimination, colonialism [and] imperialism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Chaudhuri | first = Arindam | title =Instead of creating such hype around commonwealth games, India should have long ago stopped participating in these slavish games | work = The Sunday Indian | date = 26 September 2010 | url = http://thesundayindian.com/article.php?article_id=9555 | accessdate = 14 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism by Mani Shankar Aiyar===
[[Mani Shankar Aiyar]], a senior member of the ruling [[Indian National Congress]] party and former [[Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (India)|Minister of Youth and Sports Affairs]] was an early [[whistleblower]] from the [[Union Council of Ministers of India|Indian Union Cabinet]] who expressed concern over extensive delays in preparation leading to unplanned expenses which he said, could have been utilized for "ensuring a better sporting future for Indian children by providing them sports training".&lt;ref name="ECOtimes1"&gt;{{cite news|author=, 02.27PM IST,IANS |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics/nation/BJP-Mani-Shankar-Aiyar-embarrass-government-on-Commonwealth-Games/articleshow/6223040.cms |title=BJP, Mani Shankar Aiyar embarrass government on Commonwealth Games |work=The Economic Times|date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aiyar also said that he would be "unhappy" if the Games were a success and wished for the "Commonwealth Games to be spoiled."&lt;ref name="ECOtimes1"/&gt;

Aiyar's frank media admission proved a public embarrassment for Commonwealth Games Organising Committee chairman [[Suresh Kalmadi]] who labelled him "anti national" for wishing that the Commonwealth Games are "spoilt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Suresh-Kalmadi-dubs-Mani-Shankar-Aiyar-anti-national/Article1-578503.aspx |title=Suresh Kalmadi dubs Mani Shankar Aiyar anti-national |work=Hindustan Times|date=27 July 2010 |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalmadi's remark received extensive criticism in [[Media in India|Indian media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rajesh Kalra |url=http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/randomaccess/entry/patriotism-is-the-last-refuge |title='Patriotism is the last refuge of scoundrels' is no longer a mere quote : Sports : Rajesh Kalra : TOI Blogs |publisher=Blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aiyar also told an Australian TV channel that India is "probably the poorest country of the Commonwealth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2010/s3023269.htm |title=The 7.30 Report |publisher=ABC |date=27 September 2010 |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bangladesh, among other countries, has a lower GDP per capita/purchasing power parity.

==Allegations of corruption and financial irregularities==
The day after the conclusion of the Games, the Indian Government announced formation of a special committee to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement against the Organizing Committee (OC). The probe committee was led by former [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India]] VK Shunglu. This probe was in addition to the [[Directorate General of Income Tax Investigation]], [[Central Bureau of Investigation]] (CBI), [[Enforcement Directorate]], and [[Central Vigilance Commission]] (CVC) investigations already underway. The [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]], [[Manmohan Singh|Dr. Manmohan Singh]], had promised in mid-August, when reports of the bungling first surfaced, that corrupt officials will be given ''"severe and exemplary" punishment'' after the Games. The committee was given three months time to submit its report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-10-16/india/28259235_1_probe-panel-oc-bosses-alleged-misappropriation|title=CWG: Probe panel to report in 3 months | work=[[Times of India]] |date=16 October 2010 |accessdate=16 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article832511.ece|title=Centre orders probe into CWG issues|work=[[The Hindu]]|date=16 October 2010|accessdate=16 October 2010|location=Chennai, India|first=J.|last=Balaji}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of 53 corruption cases were being examined by the CVC. As of September 2012, 28 of them were still in different stages of investigation, 13 were referred to CBI for further investigation and 12 were closed.&lt;ref name="CVC Okays Closure of 12 CWG Graft Related Cases"&gt;{{cite news|title=CVC Okays Closure of 12 CWG Graft Related Cases|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=775433|accessdate=18 September 2012|newspaper=The Outlook India|date=17 September 2012|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Al6iAKJy?url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=775433|archivedate=18 September 2012|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====CBI investigation and chargesheet====
{{See also|First Information Report|Chargesheet}}

On 25 April 2011, CBI arrested former CWG Organising Committee (OC) chairman [[Suresh Kalmadi]] in the Timing-Scoring-Result (TSR) case. He was arrested under Sections 120 B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating) of the [[Indian Penal Code]].&lt;ref name="Kalmadi arrested by CBI in CWG scam case"/&gt;

On 20 May 2011, CBI filed the first [[chargesheet]] in a special CBI court against Kalmadi. The CBI alleged that he was the ''main accused'' in awarding TSR system contract to a Swiss firm. The chargesheet said, "Kalmadi is the main accused as he was the person with all supreme powers. He had the supreme over-riding powers in the Organising Committee of the CWG, 2010." In addition to Kalmadi, the CBI named two companies and eight persons including OC former Secretary General Lalit Bhanot and former Director General VK Verma as accused.&lt;ref name="CWG: Court takes cognisance of chargesheet against Kalmadi"&gt;{{cite news|title=CWG: Court takes cognisance of chargesheet against Kalmadi|url=http://www.deccanherald.com/content/163568/content/216700/beauty-mathematics.html|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=Deccan Herald|date=23 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CWG scam: Kalmadi named 'main accused' in first CBI charge sheet"&gt;{{cite news|title=CWG scam: Kalmadi named ‘main accused' in first CBI charge sheet|url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2035048.ece|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=The Hindu|date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused were charged under various provisions of the [[Indian Penal Code]] sections dealing with criminal conspiracy, forging documents and using fake documents as genuine, Section 13 (1) (d) of the [[Prevention of Corruption Act (India)|Prevention of Corruption Act]].&lt;ref name="CWG scam: Kalmadi named 'main accused' in first CBI charge sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CWG scam: CBI files first chargesheet against Suresh Kalmadi, 8 others"&gt;{{cite news|title=CWG scam: CBI files first chargesheet against Suresh Kalmadi, 8 others|url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/cwg-scam-cbi-files-first-chargesheet-against-suresh-kalmadi-8-others-107198|accessdate=17 August 2012|newspaper=NDTV|date=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the charge sheet, the accused allegedly awarded the lucrative contract to the Swiss firm to install a TSR system for the Commonwealth Games at an excessive cost, causing a loss of over {{INRConvert|900|m}} to the exchequer. The investigation revealed that officials of the OC had conspired with private persons for awarding the contract at an excessive net cost of about {{INRConvert|1576|m}} as compared to a net bid of Spain-based company for approximately {{INRConvert|620|m}}. This resulted in a loss of about {{INRConvert|956|m}} by wrongly eliminating all competitors of Swiss-based company.&lt;ref name="CWG scam: Kalmadi named 'main accused' in first CBI charge sheet"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CWG scam: CBI files first chargesheet against Suresh Kalmadi, 8 others"/&gt; Two bids were received for TSR contract from Swiss Timing and MSL Spain and they were opened on 4 November 2009. However, much before that, on 12 October 2009, Kalmadi and Verma had announced that the contract would be awarded to Swiss Timing.&lt;ref name="CWG: Charge Framing Order Against Kalmadi on 21 Nov"&gt;{{cite news|title=CWG: Charge Framing Order Against Kalmadi on Nov 21|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=777627|accessdate=8 October 2012|newspaper=Outlook India|date=8 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306190336/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=777627#|archive-date=6 March 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trial====

On 4 February 2013, the court of special CBI judge Ravinder Kaur found sufficient prima facie evidence and ordered framing of charges against all the accused. The charges framed were: cheating, forgery, criminal conspiracy and causing a loss of over Rs 900&amp;nbsp;million under the [[Prevention of Corruption Act (India)|Prevention of Corruption Act]]. As the accused pleaded not guilty, the court ordered that daily [[Trial|Criminal trial]] (for 5 days a week) will begin from 20 February.&lt;ref name="Suresh Kalmadi charged with criminal conspiracy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Suresh Kalmadi charged with criminal conspiracy|url=http://www.niticentral.com/2013/02/kalmadi-charged-with-criminal-conspiracy.html|accessdate=7 February 2013|newspaper=Niti Central|date=4 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208144426/http://www.niticentral.com/2013/02/kalmadi-charged-with-criminal-conspiracy.html#|archive-date=8 February 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CWG: Court Frames Charges Against Kalmadi, 9 Others"&gt;{{cite news|title=CWG: Court Frames Charges Against Kalmadi, 9 Others|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=788818|accessdate=7 February 2013|newspaper=Outlook India|date=4 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130204234833/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=788818#|archive-date=4 February 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Queen's Baton Relay (QBR) case===
{{further|Queen's Baton Relay}}

The QBR event was held on 29 October 2009. The allegation was that, the Organising Committee (OC) awarded the work of transportation in QBR event to AM Car and Van Hire Ltd at excessively high rates without following a standard tender process.&lt;ref name="CBI to file chargesheet in Queen’s baton scam"&gt;{{cite news|title=CBI to file chargesheet in Queen’s baton scam|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-08-09/india/29867663_1_standard-tender-process-chargesheet-suresh-kalmadi|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After completing investigations, CBI filed its second charge-sheet (after the charge-sheet in TSR case) in a special CBI court in Delhi. The CBI named OC officials T S Darbari, Sanjay Mohindroo, Jeychandran and London-based businessman Ashish Patel and his two companies AM Car n Van Hire and AM Films. The chargesheet alleged that OC members conspired to award contracts of local transportation and others to Patel's companies at excessive rates during the event held in London in 2009.&lt;ref name="CBI Chargesheet in One More CWG Scam Case"&gt;{{cite news|title=CBI Chargesheet in One More CWG Scam Case|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=772380|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=Outlook India|date=17 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818015315/http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=772380#|archive-date=18 August 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused were charged under Indian Penal Code sections relating to criminal conspiracy to cheat and forgery along with violations of [[Prevention of Corruption Act (India)|Prevention of Corruption Act]].&lt;ref name="CBI Chargesheet in One More CWG Scam Case"/&gt;

===Venue Development Support case===
A Swiss company  was awarded a contract of over {{INRConvert|700|m}} for providing venue development support services to the Organising Committee (OC). However, it was alleged that Prime Minister appointed VK Shunglu Committee found serious cases of forgery and irregularity with the contract. The committee said that, "Undue pressure was brought within the OC for engaging the company for the contract" and recommended that CBI or [[Enforcement Directorate|ED]] should take up the case for appropriate action.&lt;ref name="CBI files new case against Kalmadi, Bhanot in CWG scam"&gt;{{cite news|title=CBI files new case against Kalmadi, Bhanot in CWG scam|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-08-24/india/33365493_1_games-workforce-venue-development-eks|accessdate=24 August 2012|newspaper=The Times of India|date=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trouble for Kalmadi, CBI files another FIR in Swiss firm deal case"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trouble for Kalmadi, CBI files another FIR in Swiss firm deal case|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/trouble-for-kalmadi-cbi-files-another-fir-in-swiss-firm-deal-case/992337/|accessdate=24 August 2012|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on Shunglu Committee's findings, CBI registered an [[First Information Report|FIR]] against Suresh Kalmadi, Lalit Bhanot and AK Mattoo on 23 August 2012.&lt;ref name="CBI files new case against Kalmadi, Bhanot in CWG scam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Trouble for Kalmadi, CBI files another FIR in Swiss firm deal case"/&gt;

[[File:BEWARE FALLING COCONUTS sign in Honolulu Hawaii-Vector.svg|upright=1.2|thumb|Bilingual warning sign in [[Honolulu]], written in [[English language|English]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]].]]
Coconuts falling from their trees and striking individuals cause serious injury to the back, neck, shoulders and head. They can potentially be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barss|first=P.|date=November 1984|title=Injuries due to falling coconuts|journal=The Journal of Trauma|volume=24|issue=11|pages=990–991|issn=0022-5282|pmid=6502774|ref=27a|via=|doi=10.1097/00005373-198411000-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a 1984 study on "Injuries Due to Falling Coconuts", exaggerated claims spread concerning the number of deaths by falling coconuts. Falling coconuts, according to [[urban legend]], kill a few people a year. This legend gained momentum after the 2002 work of a noted expert on shark attacks was characterized as saying that falling coconuts kill 150 people each year worldwide.&lt;ref name="Perkins2006" /&gt; This statistic has often been contrasted with the number of [[shark attack|shark-caused deaths]] per year, which is around five.&lt;ref name=flmnh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shark.org.au/quotes.html |publisher=Shark Research Institute |title=International Shark Attack File |accessdate=9 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729014133/http://shark.org.au/quotes.html |archivedate=29 July 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concern about the risk of fatality due to gravity's pull on coconuts led local officials in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] to remove coconut trees from beaches in 2002. One newspaper dubbed coconuts "the killer fruit."&lt;ref name="Killer Fruit"/&gt; Historical reports of actual death by coconut nonetheless date back to the 1770s.&lt;ref name="MobileReference2008"/&gt; Coconuts also played a lethal role in the South Pacific during [[World War II]]. According to published accounts, [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese forces]] weaponized the tropical fruit by turning them into "coconut bombs" filled with acid and a hand grenade.&lt;ref name="coconut bomb"&gt;{{cite news|title='Coconut Bomb' Used by Japs in Battle on Leyte|newspaper=The Evening Independent|date=20 December 1944|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=t_ZPAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6411,2444009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Barss study}} The origin of the death by coconut legend was a 1984 research paper by Dr. Peter Barss, titled "Injuries Due to Falling Coconuts,: published in the ''Journal of Trauma'' (now known as the ''Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery'').&lt;ref name="Hartston2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Hartston|title=Mr. Hartston's Most Excellent Encyclopedia of Useless Information: The Supreme Miscellany of Fantastic Facts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDv6qRmUfH8C|pages=100–|date=August 2006|publisher=John Blake|isbn=978-1-84358-160-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his paper, Barss observed that in [[Papua New Guinea]] (where he was based), over a period of four years, 2.5% of trauma admissions were for those injured by falling coconuts, with at least two fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite work|last=Barss |first=P.|year=1984|title=Injuries due to Falling Coconuts|work=''Journal of Trauma-Injury Infection &amp; Critical Care''|volume=24|number=11|url=http://journals.lww.com/jtrauma/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=1984&amp;issue=11000&amp;article=00012}}&lt;/ref&gt; That figure went on to be misquoted as 150 worldwide, which was based on the assumption that other places would suffer a similar rate of falling coconut deaths.&lt;ref name=SRI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shark.org.au/quotes.html |publisher=Shark Research Institute |title=Mis quoted statistics |accessdate=25 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729014133/http://shark.org.au/quotes.html |archivedate=29 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, Barss received an "[[Ig Nobel Award]]" from the ''Annals of Improbable Research'' in recognition of research that "cannot or should not be replicated." In response to the dubious distinction, Barss told the ''[[Canadian Medical Association Journal]]'', "when you're treating these injuries daily, it's not funny at all."&lt;ref name=CMAJ&gt;{{cite news|title=The truth about falling coconuts|author=Susan Pinker|work=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=March 2012|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/content/166/6/801.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Urban legend}} Following the publication of Barss' study, exaggerated claims about the number of deaths by coconut began to spread. Reports of death by coconut became so widespread that ''[[The Straight Dope]]'', a newspaper column devoted to exposing myths, reported that it had become an urban legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Are 150 people killed each year by falling coconuts?|date=19 July 2012|work=The Straight Dope|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2405/are-150-people-killed-each-year-by-falling-coconuts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another writer, Joel Best, described the claim of widespread deaths as a "journalistic equivalent of a contemporary legend."&lt;ref name="Best2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Joel Best|title=More Damned Lies and Statistics: How Numbers Confuse Public Issues|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SWBr7D6VavoC&amp;pg=PA19|date=7 August 2004|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-93002-5|pages=19–}}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis by the Shark Research Institute cites a press release from Club Travel, a U.K.-based travel insurance company, as helping to spread the urban legend. In an attempt to market travel insurance to individuals traveling to [[Papua New Guinea]], the release stated that coconuts were "ten times more dangerous than sharks".&lt;ref name=SRI/&gt; In May 2002, the legend gained new momentum when [[George H. Burgess]], director of the [[International Shark Attack File]], claimed that "[f]alling coconuts kill 150 people worldwide each year."&lt;ref name="Perkins2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Perkins|title=Surviving Paradise|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k7OByJAe4VsC&amp;pg=PA241|date=1 October 2006|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-1-84728-935-3|pages=241–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns about death by coconut have been reported extensively in mainstream media sources. Such reports include:
* In February 1985, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on the hazards posed by coconut trees and noted that "falling coconuts could strike a person on the ground with a force of almost 2,000 pounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coconuts and Palm Trees Are Hazards in Paradise|author=Bayard Webster|date=5 February 1985|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/02/05/science/coconuts-and-palm-trees-are-hazards-in-paradise.html|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August 2001, the ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' reported that "a check with the experts" found that a human was more likely to be killed by a pig or a falling coconut than by "a shark on the prowl for dinner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Shark bites man' a non-story|newspaper=Toledo Blade|date=28 August 2001|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6lxIAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4064,4009205}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In February 2002, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that coconut trees were being removed from beaches in [[Queensland]], Australia, to guard against "death by coconut."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trees must go as Queensland guards against death by coconut|author=Ben Westwood|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=23 February 2002|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/723535/Trees-must-go-as-Queensland-guards-against-death-by-coconut.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In April 2002, the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' ran an op-ed piece titled "Travelers should watch out for coconuts – the killer fruit."

* Following shark sightings off the Massachusetts coast, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' in September 2009 quoted a local resident as saying, "You're less likely to get killed by a shark than by a coconut falling on your head."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sharks spotted off Chatham coast; but officials say threat is small|date=5 September 2009|newspaper=Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/09/05/sharks_spotted_off_chatham_coast_but_officials_say_threat_is_small/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2010, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the Indian government removed coconuts from the trees at [[Mumbai]]'s Gandhi museum "for fear that a nut would descend on to the head of President Obama" who had recently visited the city. The article cited the Barss study and observed: "Thanks to Indian officials and perhaps also to Barss, Obama's recent visit to Mumbai was devoid of coconut trauma."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Improbable research: mind your head!

* In October 2011, the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] broadcast a story in which Christopher Neff from the [[University of Sydney]] claimed that "while people may not pay attention to the statistics, you are more likely to be killed by a coconut than eaten by a shark."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Perfect Predators|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=25 October 2011|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-10-25/perfect-predators/3600334?section=wa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variations===
While the typical form of death by coconut is by trauma resulting from a coconut falling from a tree under the force of gravity, variations on the phenomenon have also been reported.

One of the most unusual variations occurred in India in the 1930s. Newspapers across the world reported that a schoolboy in India had been killed by a "magic" or "enchanted" coconut.&lt;ref name=CH&gt;{{cite news|title=Schoolboy Killed by Magic Coconut|newspaper=The Calgary Herald|date=17 March 1934|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=bRVkAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6232,1917093}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to determine who had taken a book from a classroom, an elementary school teacher at [[Harnahalli]] required each of his students to touch a coconut bearing a [[Thirunamam|namam]], a religious symbol. The teacher claimed that the one who took the book would face "divine wrath" upon touching the coconut. One student resisted, but was forced to touch the coconut.&lt;ref name=IE&gt;{{cite news|title="That Coconut": Sick Boy's Cry Before Death|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=1933|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DYk-AAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6468,3641123}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly contracted a high fever, fell into delirium, and died within an hour.&lt;ref name=CH/&gt;&lt;ref name=IE/&gt;

In April 1983, a coconut was cited as the cause of death for a female [[goose-beaked whale]]. The husk from a coconut became lodged in its intestine, and the whale beached itself on a sandbar at [[Siesta Key, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coconut Blamed In Whale's Death|author=Jack Gurney|newspaper=Sarasota Herald-Tribune|date=30 April 1983|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vuQbAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3209,8119697}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1997, a report of death by [[coconut oil]] was published. The production line manager at a factory in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]], drowned in a vat of coconut oil. His body was discovered after he was reported as missing, and police were investigating to determine whether he fell or was pushed into the coconut oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Coconut oil death|newspaper=The Victoria Advocate|date=21 May 1997|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19970521&amp;id=BDMKAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2074,4092633}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1923, a [[New Castle, Pennsylvania]], man was killed while trying to crack open a coconut with the butt end of a loaded revolver. The gun discharged, and the man was shot in the abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hits Coconut With Pistol; Is Killed|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=December 3, 1923|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18012280/hits_coconut_with_pistol_is_killed/|via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other occurrences involve coconuts being used as deadly weapons. These include:
* In 1944, reports were published that Japanese troops were using "coconut bombs" in defending against the American invasion of [[Leyte]]. Col. Allan Feldman reported that the bombs were created by placing hand grenades and [[picric acid]] inside hollowed-out coconuts. The coconuts were then sealed with wax, attached to a string, and thrown at the American troops.&lt;ref name="coconut bomb"/&gt;
* In July 2004, a 55-year-old [[Sri Lanka]]n man was killed when he was struck on the head by a coconut. Police concluded that the blow was not the result of a coconut falling from a tree, but rather had been sustained in a fight that developed after the victim invited "a group of friends to his hut to enjoy a hooch party."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Party end in tragedy|publisher=The Island|date=3 July 2004|author=Cyril Wimalasurendre|url=http://www.island.lk/2004/07/03/foreignnews8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been reports of deaths resulting from the collapse of coconut palm trees. These include:
* In April 1992, an 81-year-old man was killed in [[Malaysia]] when he was pinned under the trunk of a coconut tree that had been uprooted by high winds. His family noted that he had been employed as a "coconut plucker" and had previously survived a fall from a coconut tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Falling trees kill man, injure three|newspaper=New Strait Times|date=17 April 1992|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IsFUAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7082,3059904}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In May 2006, a man and a boy were killed by falling coconut palm trees during a tropical storm in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=At least 29 people killed in RP storm|newspaper=The China Post|date=14 May 2006|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/international/detail.asp?ID=82203&amp;GRP=D}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In August 2011, a 56-year-old man was killed after an entire coconut tree toppled onto him while he was motorcycling in Kampung Baru Seberang Takir, [[Kuala Terengganu]], Malaysia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/AsiaOne+News/Malaysia/Story/A1Story20110811-293850.html|title=Falling coconut tree kills 56-year-old boatman |date=11 August 2011 |newspaper=[[AsiaOne]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also in August 2011, the CEO of Milestone Capital, [[Ved Prakash Arya]], was crushed and killed when a coconut palm tree fell on him in [[Mumbai]]. Following the incident, the local municipal authority resisted proposals to cut down the trees, noting, "We don't allow chopping down of coconut trees.

==Coconuts and the law==
Deaths and injuries resulting from falling coconuts have been the subject of several legal proceedings that have been covered in the media.

In 1956, the City of Miami paid $300 to a woman after a coconut fell from a city-owned tree and struck her in the foot. In justifying the award, the city attorney explained that the city was allegedly on notice of the danger, because "a reasonable man would assume it was about to fall when it turns brown."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miami Pays Damages For Falling Coconut|newspaper=Ocala Star-Banner|date=4 October 1956|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X8YVAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5393,451196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, a jury in Hawaii awarded $39,000 to a police officer who was struck by a falling coconut. The officer was hit in the head while removing fronds from a public sidewalk in [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]]. The property owner was sued for failing to maintain the trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Damages collected for falling coconut|newspaper=The Spokesman-Review (AP story)|date=1 June 1977|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LfBLAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1912,389405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
The American poet [[Frederick Seidel]] wrote a poem titled "Coconut", which included the following lines:&lt;blockquote&gt;A coconut can fall and hit you on the head,&lt;br&gt;And if it falls from high enough can kind of knock you dead&lt;br&gt;Dead beneath the coconut palms, that's the life for me!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Frederick Seidel|title=Poems 1959–2009|page=15|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=0374126550}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On their 1995 CD ''Makin' A Mess'', the writing/singing team of [[Bob Gibson (musician)|Bob Gibson]] and [[Shel Silverstein]] included a song on this subject, entitled "Killed By A Coconut", which humorously describes a series of men and their fatal encounters with coconuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|author=Gibson, Bob|year=1995|title=Makin' A Mess|publisher=Asylum Records|type=CD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falling coconut injuries were featured in the American television series ''[[Gilligan's Island]]''. A June 1965 episode revolved around an injury sustained by Gilligan after a falling coconut hit him in the nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gilligan's Island on CBS|publisher=TV Guide|accessdate=26 July 2013|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/gilligans-island/videos-season-1/100178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actor [[Bob Denver]] explained the success of the series as follows: "Little kids seem to love it. It doesn't take a great intellect or reasoning power to be able to laugh at a monkey running off with Gilligan's dinner or a guy getting conked on the head by a coconut."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bob Denver &amp; Co. Will Glow More Brightly This Season on 'Gilligan's Island'|newspaper=The Milwaukee Journal|date=5 September 1965|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zf8pAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6110,2420691}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Denver died, the show's creator [[Sherwood Schwartz]] said that Denver didn't get enough credit for his talent as a slapstick actor: "A lot of people don't think it's hard to be an actor where all you have to do is react to a falling coconut."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bob Denver, classic TV's Gilligan, dead at age 70|author=Bill Keveney|newspaper=USA Today|date=6 September 2005|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-09-06-denver-obit_x.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film [[Cast Away]], the stranded character played by [[Tom Hanks]] is alarmed several times by loud thuds, which he cannot identify. He finally sees a coconut fall, making the sound.

In March 2006, ''[[Newsweek]]'' ran a satirical article on former Enron CEO [[Kenneth Lay]], stating he testified that he had sustained amnesia after being struck in the head by a falling coconut and as a result of the injury, was unable to recall the events that occurred during his time at [[Enron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ken Lay Claims Amnesia After Coconut Fell on His Head|publisher=Newsweek|date=14 March 2006|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NWEC&amp;p_theme=nwec&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=113FBF5E4AE41F18&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Keith Richards]] of [[The Rolling Stones]] underwent surgery and hospitalization for a brain injury in April 2006, some press reports erroneously blamed the injury on Richards' having been "conked by coconuts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keith Richards Conked By Coconuts|publisher=Pop Blend|date=30 April 2006|url=http://www.cinemablend.com/pop/Keith-Richards-Conked-By-Coconuts-197.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falling coconuts had not caused the injury as Richards had climbed a dead tree (not a coconut palm) and had then fallen from the tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keith Richards 'tree fall' injury |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4957948.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The video game ''[[Donkey Kong 3]]'' has the antagonist Donkey Kong throwing coconuts from overhead at the player, trying to kill him. A hit causes a missed turn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/wiiu-eshop/donkey_kong_3_nes|publisher=nintendo life|title=Review: Donkey Kong 3 (Wii U eShop / NES)|accessdate=22 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'' episode "Rock-a-Bye Bivalve", [[Patrick Star]] is addicted to a show where nothing happens except a man gets hit in the head by a coconut.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0707297/?ref_=ttpl_pl_tt&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Kirby (series)|Kirby]]'' video game series, explosive coconuts are a reoccurring obstacle that usually fall from trees.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1825">A '''doppelganger domain''' is a domain spelled identical to a legitimate [[fully qualified domain name]] (FQDN) but missing the dot between host/subdomain and domain, to be used for malicious purposes.

==Overview==
Typosquatting's traditional attack vector is through the web to distribute malware or harvest credentials. Other vectors such as email and remote access services such as SSH, RDP, and VPN also can be leveraged. In a whitepaper by Godai Group on doppelganger domains, they demonstrated that numerous emails can be harvested without anyone noticing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://godaigroup.net/publications/doppelganger-domains/ | work=Godai Group | title=Doppelganger Domain whitepaper | date=6 Sep 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==
If someone's email address is "someone@finance.somecompany.example", the doppelganger domain would be "financesomecompany.example". Hence, if someone is trying to send an email to that user and they forget the dot after "finance" (someone@financesomecompany.example), it would go to the doppelganger domain instead of the legitimate user.

The '''Downing Street memo''' (or the '''Downing Street Minutes'''), sometimes described by critics of the [[Iraq War]] as the '''smoking gun memo''', is the note of a 23 July 2002 secret meeting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iraqinquiry.org.uk/ |title=Iraq Inquiry - Home |website=www.iraqinquiry.org.uk |accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://downingstreetmemo.com/memos.html |title=The Downing Street Memos :: The text |last=citizens |first=concerned |website=downingstreetmemo.com |accessdate=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; of senior British government, defence and intelligence figures discussing the build-up to the war, which included direct reference to classified [[United States]] policy of the time. The name refers to [[10 Downing Street]], the residence of the [[List of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|British prime minister]].

The memo, written by Downing Street foreign policy aide [[Matthew Rycroft]], recorded the head of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] (MI6) as expressing the view following his recent visit to Washington that "[[George W. Bush|[George W.] Bush]] wanted to remove [[Saddam Hussein]], through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy."

It quoted [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]] as saying it was clear that Bush had "made up his mind" to take military action but that "the case was thin."

Straw also noted that Iraq retained "WMD capability" and that "Saddam would continue to play hard-ball with the UN."

The military asked about the consequences "if Saddam used WMD on day one," posing Kuwait or Israel as potential targets.

Attorney-General [[Lord Goldsmith]] warned that justifying the invasion on legal grounds would be difficult. However, the meeting took place several months before the adoption of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441]], the resolution eventually used as the legal basis for the invasion of Iraq.  UNR687 also provided a pre-existing basis, as it required Iraq to divest itself of "100%" of all WMD capacity, which the Memo agreed it had not.

A copy of the memo was obtained by British journalist [[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Michael Smith]] and published in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' in May 2005, on the eve of British elections.  Smith stated that the memo was equivalent to the [[Pentagon Papers]] which exposed American intentions in the [[Vietnam War]] and alleged the American media did not report more about it due to a perceived bias towards support for the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/06/14/DI2005061401261.html |title=The Downing Street Memo |author=Michael Smith |publisher=Washington Post |date=16 June 2005 |accessdate=10 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though its authenticity has never been seriously challenged, the British and American governments have stated that the contents do not accurately reflect their official policy positions at the time.

== Introduction ==
The memo was first published in ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' on 1 May 2005, during the last days of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005 |UK general election]] campaign.&lt;ref name="sundaytimes"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article387374.ece|title=The secret Downing Street memo |work=[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]] |location=London |date=1 May 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723222004/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article387374.ece |archivedate=23 July 2011 |accessdate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It went largely unremarked in the U.S. press at first, but was heavily covered in progressive [[blog]]s such as those on [[Daily Kos]], because of a remark attributed to [[Richard Dearlove]] (then MI6 head) that "the intelligence and facts were being fixed [by the U.S.] around the policy" of removing [[Saddam Hussein]] from power, which was interpreted to show that US intelligence on Iraq prior to the war was deliberately falsified, rather than simply mistaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0517/dailyUpdate.html |title=Why has "Downing Street memo" story been a "dud" in US? |work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310182232/http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0517/dailyUpdate.html |archivedate=10 March 2007 |accessdate=17 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As this issue began to be covered by American media (''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' on 12 May 2005, ''[[Washington Post]]'' on 13 May 2005, two other main allegations stemming from the memo arose: that the UN weapons inspection process was manipulated to provide a legal pretext for the war, and that pre-war air strikes were deliberately ramped up in order to soften Iraqi infrastructure in preparation for war, prior to the October U.S. Senate vote permitting the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/12/AR2005051201857.html |title=British Intelligence Warned of Iraq War:Blair Was Told of White House's Determination to Use Military Against Hussein |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=13 May 2005 |first=Walter |last=Pincus |accessdate=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some elements of the U.S. media have portrayed the document as faked or fraudulent, and Dana Perino referred in her daily White House press briefing on 4 December 2008 to the fact that the Bush administration has "debunked" the document previously. The British have tacitly validated its authenticity (as when Tony Blair replied to a press conference question by saying "that memorandum was written before we then went to the United Nations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/06/20050607-2.html |title=whitehouse.gov |accessdate=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

A group of 131 [[members of Congress]] led by [[John Conyers]], repeatedly requested that [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] respond to the contents of the document. A resolution of inquiry was filed by Representative [[Barbara Lee]], which would request that the President and the [[State Department]] turn over all relevant information with regard to US policy towards Iraq. The resolution had 70 co-sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:HE00375:@@@P |title=Thomas Query for current number |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Addressees of the memo'''&lt;br /&gt;
Copies of the minutes were sent to:
*[[Secretary of State for Defence]] [[Geoff Hoon]],
*[[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs]] [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]],
*[[Attorney General of England and Wales]] [[Peter Goldsmith, Baron Goldsmith|Lord Goldsmith]],
*[[Cabinet Secretary]] [[Richard Thomas James Wilson|Sir Richard Wilson]],
*Chairman of the [[UK Joint Intelligence Committee|Joint Intelligence Committee]] [[John Scarlett]],
*Director of the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] [[Francis Richards (diplomat)|Francis Richards]],
*[[Chief of the Defence Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Defence Staff]] [[Michael Boyce, Baron Boyce|Sir Michael Boyce]],
*Head of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] [[Richard Dearlove]],
*Prime Minister's Chief of Staff [[Jonathan Powell (chief of staff to Tony Blair)|Jonathan Powell]],
*Downing Street Director of Government Relations [[Sally Morgan, Baroness Morgan of Huyton|Sally Morgan]], and
*Downing Street Director of Communications and Strategy [[Alastair Campbell]].
&lt;/div&gt;

The minutes were meant to be kept confidential and were headed "This record is extremely sensitive. No further copies should be made. It should be shown only to those with a genuine need to know its contents." It deals with the lead-up to the 2003 [[Iraq War]], and comes at a point at which it becomes clear to those attending, that US President George W. Bush intended to remove Saddam Hussein from power by force.

The minutes run through the military options and then consider the political strategy in which an appeal for support from the international community and from domestic opinion would be most likely to be positively received. It suggests that an [[ultimatum]] for Saddam to allow back [[United Nations]] weapons inspectors be issued, and that this would help to make the use of force legal. Tony Blair is quoted as saying that the British public would support [[regime change]] in the right political context.

The most controversial paragraph is a report of a recent visit to Washington by head of the [[Secret Intelligence Service]] Sir Richard Dearlove (known in official terminology as 'C'):

{{quote|C reported on his recent talks in Washington. There was a perceptible shift in attitude. Military action was now seen as inevitable. Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and [[Weapons of mass destruction|WMD]]. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy. The [[United States National Security Council|NSC]] had no patience with the UN route, and no enthusiasm for publishing material on the Iraqi regime's record. There was little discussion in Washington of the aftermath after military action.}}

The British analysis of US policy is also stated elsewhere in the minutes:

{{quote|The Defence Secretary said that the US had already begun "spikes of activity" to put pressure on the regime. No decisions had been taken, but he thought the most likely timing in US minds for military action to begin was January, with the timeline beginning 30 days before the US Congressional elections.

The Foreign Secretary said he would discuss this with [[Colin Powell]] this week. It seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action, even if the timing was not yet decided. But the case was thin. Saddam was not threatening his neighbours, and his WMD capability was less than that of Libya, North Korea or Iran. We should work up a plan for an ultimatum to Saddam to allow back in the UN weapons inspectors. This would also help with the legal justification for the use of force.

The Attorney-General said that the desire for regime change was not a legal base for military action. There were three possible legal bases: self-defence, humanitarian intervention, or UNSC authorisation. The first and second could not be the base in this case. Relying on [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1205|UNSCR 1205]] of three years ago would be difficult. The situation might of course change.}}

The main sections covering the ultimatum are:

{{quote|The Prime Minister said that it would make a big difference politically and legally if Saddam refused to allow in the UN inspectors. There were different strategies for dealing with Libya and Iran. Regime change and WMD were linked in the sense that it was the regime that was producing the WMD. If the political context were right, people would support regime change. The two key issues were whether the military plan worked and whether we had the political strategy to give the military plan the space to work.

...John Scarlett assessed that Saddam would allow the inspectors back in only when he thought the threat of military action was real.

The Defence Secretary said that if the Prime Minister wanted UK military involvement, he would need to decide this early. He cautioned that many in the US did not think it worth going down the ultimatum route. It would be important for the Prime Minister to set out the political context to Bush.}}

The minutes also outlines potential risks of an invasion of Iraq:

{{quote|For instance, what were the consequences, if Saddam used WMD on day one, or if Baghdad did not collapse and urban warfighting began? You said that Saddam could also use his WMD on Kuwait. Or on Israel, added the Defence Secretary.}}

== Reaction ==

=== Proponents of an inquiry ===
In the United States, proponents of a formal congressional inquiry say that the minutes, along with testimonies from credible witnesses, shed sufficient doubt on the actions of the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush Administration]] to warrant a formal inquiry. In particular, they say that the minutes indicate that the Administration was determined to go to war with Iraq prior to considerations of legality, and with full knowledge that, at best, "the case was slim." And furthermore that they [[confirmation bias|selected and exaggerated intelligence so as to confirm]] their policy and developed a plan to manipulate public opinion. Also, proponents say that the contents (such as "Military action was now seen as inevitable.") and the ''date'' of the memo, 23 July 2002, contradicts the official White House position that President Bush did not finally decide to carry out the invasion of March 2003 until after [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Colin L. Powell]] presented the administration's case to the [[United Nations Security Council]], in a speech on 5 February 2003. They also say that the minutes are dated at a time when Bush stated that "we haven't made any decisions on Iraq, but all options are on the table."

Another paragraph has been taken to show that [[Geoff Hoon]] believed the timing of the war was intended to influence American elections:

{{quote|The Defence Secretary said that the US had already begun "spikes of activity" to put pressure on the regime. No decisions had been taken, but he thought the most likely timing in US minds for military action to begin was January, with the timeline beginning 30 days before the US Congressional elections.}}

It has been said that some of those present at the meeting believed that Iraq might possess [[weapons of mass destruction]] (WMD) "capacity". However, the minutes explicitly state that the capability was less than that of Libya, Iran, and North Korea, and that Saddam was not threatening his neighbours.&lt;ref name="sundaytimes"/&gt;

=== U.S. Congress ===
On 5 May 2005, Democratic [[Congressman]] [[John Conyers]] sent [[Wikisource:Letter from Congress regarding Downing Street memo|a letter]] to President Bush signed by 89 of his colleagues demanding an explanation of the "troubling revelations" in the memo. No specific White House response to the letter was ever made publicly. In response to the Bush Administration's refusal to answer the congressional delegation's questions, Conyers et al. considered sending a fact-finding mission to the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1622378,00.html |title=Blair faces US probe over secret Iraq invasion plan |author1=Tony Allen-Mills |author2=Tom Pattinson |date=22 May 2005 |work=The Sunday Times |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107023337/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1622378,00.html |archivedate=7 January 2006 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conyers initially requested 100,000 signatures from citizens (a petition) to request that President Bush answer the questions in his letter. The letter began accumulating between 20,000 and 25,000 signatures a day, boosted by progressive political action group [[MoveOn.org]], which joined the campaign on 9 June. By 13 June 2005, the letter had received over 540,000 signatures from citizens, and more congressmen had signed on, bringing the total to 94 – three days later, over 100 congressmen had signed the letter, including then-[[Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader]] [[Nancy Pelosi]].

On 16 June 2005, Conyers presided over an [[unofficial hearing]] or forum on the Downing Street memo in a basement room in the Capitol where notable opponents of the Iraq War [[Joseph C.

By the next morning the document was elevated to a major story on the Daily Kos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/5/1/115530/0288 |title=Bush / Iraq Bombshell This Morning |last=smintheus |date=1 May 2005 |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Democratic Congressman John Conyers learned of its existence.

A website, www.downingstreetmemo.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.downingstreetmemo.com |title=The Downing Street Memo(s) |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created on 13 May, "to fill a void left by the American mainstream media," and continues with its primary aim "to provide a resource for anyone who wants to understand the meaning and context of these documents as they relate to the Bush administration's case for war."

On 30 May 2005, in a "blogswarm" fueled by the memo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blogpulse.com/trend?query1=%22downing+street+memo%22&amp;label1=downing+street+memo&amp;query2=%22big+brass+alliance%22&amp;label2=big+brass+alliance&amp;query3=%22downing+street+minutes%22&amp;label3=downing+street+minutes&amp;query4=afterdowningstreet.org&amp;label4=afterdowningstreet&amp;query5=blogswarm&amp;label5=blogswarm&amp;days=180&amp;x=23&amp;y=8 |title=Blogpulse Tools Trend Results |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; hundreds of blogs joined together to form the Big Brass Alliance in support of After Downing Street.

=== Pundits ===
On 18 May, conservative pundit and former [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] advisor [[Paul Craig Roberts]] wrote an article calling for Bush's [[impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] for lying to Congress about the case for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.lewrockwell.com/roberts/roberts101.html| title= A Reputation in Tatters| first=Paul Craig| last=Roberts| date=17 May 2005| accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May, liberal consumer advocate and former Presidential hopeful [[Ralph Nader]] wrote an article on [[ZNet]] calling for Bush and Cheney’s impeachment under [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Impeachment|Article II, Section 4]] of the [[United States Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/article02/18.html#1| title=FindLaw: US Constitution: Article II: Annotations pg. 18 of 18|work=Findlaw| accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on that day, he and [[Kevin Zeese]] authored an [[op-ed]] for the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' to support the call for [[Movement to impeach George W. Bush|impeachment against Bush]], citing the memo as part of the evidence that the possibility of deliberate deception by the administration should be investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2005/05/31/the_i_word/| title=The 'I' word| author=Ralph Nader and Kevin Zeese| date=31 May 2005|work=The Boston Globe| accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January 2006, an article entitled ''The Impeachment of George W. Bush'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060130/holtzman | title= The Impeachment of George W. Bush| accessdate=17 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; written by [[Elizabeth Holtzman]] (Rep. NY-D 1973–1981, member of the House Judiciary Committee that held impeachment hearings of President [[Richard Nixon]]) was published by the left-wing periodical ''[[The Nation]]''. The article makes specific references to the Downing Street memo.

===Political groups===
A coalition of American groups known as [[After Downing Street]], co-founded by a group of longtime progressive and/or Democratic Party activists,&lt;ref&gt;afterdowningstreet.org, [http://afterdowningstreet.org/cofounders Co-Founders]. Retrieved 28 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; called on Congress to file a '''Resolution of Inquiry''', the first necessary legal step to determine whether President Bush had committed impeachable offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://rawstory.com/exclusives/alexandrovna/coalition_inquiry_downing_street_memo_526.htm| title= Coalition of citizen groups seek formal inquiry into whether Bush acted illegally in push for Iraq war| first= Larisa| last=Alexandrovna|work=The Raw Story| accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The formal Resolution of Inquiry request was written by [[Boston]] constitutional attorney [[John C.

{{quote|[The US President] has not given [the Senate] full information, but has concealed important intelligence which he ought to have communicated, and by that means induced them to enter into measures injurious to their country, and which they would not have consented to had the true state of things been disclosed to them.}}

Democrats.com raised one thousand dollars, offered as a reward to anyone who could get George Bush to answer the following question "Yes" or "No:

In addition a number of lesser prizes were offered for lesser responses, down to a $100 for posing the question clearly to Bush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.democrats.com/bush-question1| title=$1000 Reward For Getting Bush to Answer Downing Street Minutes| first= Bob| last= Fertik| date=28 May 2005| accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== News coverage ==
The Downing Street Minutes was a major story in the British press during the last few days of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election campaign]] and was also covered in other countries. The story initially had limited coverage in the US but later recently received greater attention in the American press. The organisation [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] has been among those that have criticised the US print media, saying they "continue to downplay [the] story." According to [[Media Matters for America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200506160002 |date=16 June 2005|title=Mainstream media cover-up: In five weeks following its disclosure, Downing Street memo drew little attention |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were some early mentions in ''[[The New York Times]]'', the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', the ''[[New York Sun]]'', and the ''[[Washington Post]]'', though coverage was slight (the ''Post''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; first article appeared in the "Style" section) and primarily aimed at the impact it would have on the British elections, rather than how it affected the Bush administration. The [[Knight-Ridder]] news service produced some reportage at the time, but independent articles were limited. The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and ''[[Star Tribune]]'' put local reporters on the story, and produced early articles on 12 May and 13 May, respectively.

At the ''Star Tribune'', initial interest had been piqued after a reader e-mailed information he had seen on the Internet to the paper's [[ombudsman]], who forwarded it to others in the news department. Being quite a distance from London, editors first waited for articles to come across on wire services. Undoubtedly, many other newspapers across the country reacted similarly. After a few days of no news, however, a local reporter was assigned. The article was initially scheduled to run on 11 May, but was pushed back so that it could have greater prominence on a slower news day later in the week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/5451062.html |title=404 error |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, much of the coverage about the memo has discussed the lack of coverage. One of the first reports include that topic was a 17 May article in the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]''. The report was one of the most extensive for a nationwide publication up until that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0517/dailyUpdate.html |title=Why has 'Downing Street memo' story been a 'dud' in US? |first=Matthew |last=Clark |work=Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=11 March 2006 |date=17 May 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060207140057/http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0517/dailyUpdate.html |archivedate=7 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 May 2005, [[Daniel Okrent]], the Public Editor at the time for ''The New York Times'', publicly assessed the coverage of the minutes in the paper in a forum on the NYT's website. He also stated that, due to continuing reader interest, the paper intends to give fuller coverage to the memo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://forums.nytimes.com/top/opinion/readersopinions/forums/thepubliceditor/danielokrent/index.html?offset=47&amp;fid=.f555e99/47 |title=Registration required for access|work=The New York Times |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Okrent stepped down at the end of May (the routine end of his term), on ''NewsHour'' on 8 June he suggested some possible reasons that the US media had been so slow to cover what he considered a very important story. He said it may have been assigned to 'foreign news' correspondents and wasn't seen as a Bush story, or it may be the US media was still working on researching it (although he then admitted he had no reason to believe that).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/media/jan-june05/ombuds_6-8.html |title=NewsHour transcript, audio and video |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 8 June, ''[[USA Today]]'' printed an article by their senior assignment editor for foreign news, Jim Cox, saying with respect to the memo, "We could not obtain the memo or a copy of it from a reliable source. … There was no explicit confirmation of its authenticity from (Blair's office). And it was disclosed four days before the British elections, raising concerns about the timing."

The ''Star Tribune'' revisited the Downing Street Minutes as part of the evidence in a [[Memorial Day]] editorial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/5427823.html |title=Editorial: Memorial Day/Praise bravery, seek forgiveness|date=30 May 2005|work=Star Tribune|accessdate=19 March 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050531234547/http://www.startribune.com/stories/1519/5427823.html |archivedate = 31 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stated explicitly,
{{quote|President Bush and those around him lied, and the rest of us let them. Harsh? Yes. True? Also yes. Perhaps it happened because Americans, understandably, don't expect untruths from those in power. But that works better as an explanation than as an excuse....

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported on the memos on 27 March 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/27/international/europe/27memo.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |title=Bush Was Set on Path to War, British Memo Says |first=Don |last=Van Natta Jr. |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=29 March 2006|work=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbian newspaper ''El Tiempo'' implicated the Prime Minister's role in the [[Iraq War]] on 9 May 2007 – and the Downing Street memo specifically – as "the principal reason for the UK's disillusionment with Tony Blair."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eltiempo.com/opinion/columnistas/otroscolumnistas/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR-3550290.html ''El Tiempo'' 9 May 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chilean newspaper ''[[La Segunda]]'' on 11 May 2007 called the Downing Street memo "one of the best-kept secrets in [[Tony Blair|Tony Blair's]] ten years as prime minister."

One of the first articles on the memo to appear in the US media quoted "a former senior US official", who, speaking on condition of anonymity, called the memo's account "an absolutely accurate description of what transpired" during the senior British intelligence officer's visit to Washington. UK [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] denied that anything in the memo demonstrated misconduct and said that it added little to what was already known about how British policy on Iraq developed, also commenting that "that memorandum was written before we went to the United Nations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2005/06/07/national/w152752D27.DTL |title=Text of Bush, Blair News Conference |agency=The Associated Press |date=7 June 2005 |accessdate=11 March 2006 |work=San Francisco Chronicle |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050915140748/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=%2Fn%2Fa%2F2005%2F06%2F07%2Fnational%2Fw152752D27.DTL |archivedate=15 September 2005 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*When asked about the contents of the memo by [[Plaid Cymru]] MP Adam Price in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on 29 June 2005, Blair again refrained from disputing the document's authenticity, saying only "[…]that memo and other documents of the time were covered by the Butler review. In addition, that was before we went to the United Nations and secured the second resolution, [[Resolution 1441|1441]], which had unanimous support."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/cm050629/debtext/50629-02.htm#50629-02_dpthd0 |title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 29 Jun 2005 (pt 2) |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to CNN, currently classified documents which were dated at the same month as the Downing Street memo, March 2002, were uncovered in Iraq, and contained evidence that Russian intelligence notified Iraq about the "determination of the United States and Britain to launch military action."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/04/13/sprj.irq.russia.spy/index.html |title=Russia spied for Iraq – paper |date=13 April 2003|publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US President George W. Bush ===
On 7 June 2005, at a joint George W. Bush-Tony Blair press briefing in the [[White House]], [[Reuters]] correspondent Steve Holland asked, "On Iraq, the so-called Downing Street memo from July 2002 says intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy of removing Saddam through military action. Is this an accurate reflection of what happened? Could both of you respond?" President Bush did not address the issue of the intelligence and facts being "fixed" around a decision to go to war, but he did deny that he had, at the time of the memo, already decided to use military force against Saddam Hussein, saying "There's nothing farther from the truth." Bush also questioned the motives of whoever leaked the memo during the British election, saying "Well, I—you know, I read kind of the characterisations of the memo, particularly when they dropped it out in the middle of his race. … I'm not sure who 'they dropped it out' is, but—I'm not suggesting that you all dropped it out there."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/47330.htm |title=President Welcomes British Prime Minister Blair to the White House |date=7 May 2005 |accessdate=19 March 2007 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315012654/http://www.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/47330.htm |archivedate=15 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UK Prime Minister Tony Blair ===
When the document was published, UK Prime Minister Tony Blair denied that anything in the memo demonstrated misconduct and said that it added little to what was already known about how British policy on Iraq developed.

Blair's response to Steve Holland at the joint news conference with Bush was "No, the facts were not being fixed in any shape or form at all". He also reiterated that he and Bush had continued to try to find a way to avert war, "As it happened, we weren't able to do that because – as I think was very clear – there was no way that Saddam Hussein was ever going to change the way that he worked, or the way that he acted,". He said the same thing in a 7 June 2005 interview with [[Gwen Ifill]] on ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/international/jan-june05/blair_6-07.html |work=Online NewsHour: |title=Tony Blair Discusses US Aid to Africa, the EU Constitution and the Downing Street Memo |date=7 June 2005 |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== White House spokesman Scott McClellan ===
On 16 May, presidential spokesman [[Scott McClellan]] said that the memo's statement that intelligence was "being fixed" to support a decision to invade Iraq was "flat out wrong". However, McClellan admitted that he has not read the memo, but has only received reports of what it contains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/05/16/iraq.memo/ |title=White House challenges UK Iraq memo |date=17 May 2005|publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May, McClellan told reporters that the White House saw "no need" to respond to the letter from Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/20/politics/20weapons.html |title=British Memo on US Plans for Iraq War Fuels Critics |first=Douglas |last=Jehl |date=20 May 2005 |accessdate=11 March 2006 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 May, when BTC News reporter Eric Brewer asked him about his 16 May statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.btcnews.com/btcnews/index.php?p=964 |title=BTC News White House writer Eric Brewer on "The Brad Show" |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; McClellan said:
{{quote|Let me correct you... let me correct you on the characterisation of the quote you attributed to me. I’m referring to some of the allegations that were made referring to a report.

In terms of the intelligence, the – if anyone wants to know how the intelligence was used by the administration, all they have to do is go back and look at all the public comments over the course of the lead-up to the war in Iraq, and that's all very public information.

The following day, a popular political blog, [[ThinkProgress]], posted a response titled "[https://web.archive.org/web/20080221073216/http://thinkprogress.org/index.php?p=951 Take the McClellan Challenge]", comparing what the intelligence was with how it was used by the administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/index.php?p=951 |title=Take the McClellan Challenge |accessdate=6 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429094859/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article527701.ece |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== US Secretary of State Rice and UK Foreign Secretary Straw ===
On 1 May 2005, US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw were questioned on the memo, although neither was able to give a detailed answer. Straw stated that he had not expected the question to come up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/46412.htm |title=Remarks with British Foreign Secretary Jack Straw After Meeting |publisher=US Department of State |accessdate=11 March 2006 |date=17 May 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060307115041/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/46412.htm |archivedate=7 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Veracity of the memo==
Following the advice of company lawyers, [[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Michael Smith]], the journalist who first reported on the Downing Street Memo, has said that he protected the identity of his source by reproducing all documents and returning the 'originals' back to the source. In some cases, a document was retyped from a photocopy, and the photocopy destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.downingstreetmemo.com/msmith-interview.html Interview with Michael Smith] [[DowningStreetMemo.com]] 27 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This has led some to question the document's authenticity, but no official source has questioned it, and it has been unofficially confirmed to various news organisations, including the Washington Post, NBC, The Sunday Times, and the LA Times. Several other documents obtained by Smith, and treated similarly (see below), were confirmed as genuine by the UK Foreign Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/guardianpolitics/story/0,,1308223,00.html| title=Leaks cast doubt on PM's motive| author=Ewen MacAskill and Michael White| date= 20 September  2004|work=The Guardian | accessdate=11 March 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Iraq document leak 18 September 2004}}

Previous to the appearance of the Downing Street Memo, six other British (Blair) Cabinet papers originating around March 2002 were obtained by [[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Michael Smith]] and used in two ''[[The Daily Telegraph|Daily Telegraph]]'' stories&lt;ref name="failure is not an option"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/18/nwar118.xml| title=Failure is not an option, but it doesn't mean they will avoid it| first=Michael|last=Smith| date=18 September 2004| accessdate=11 March 2006|work=Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2004/09/18/nwar18.xml| title=Secret papers show Blair was warned of Iraq chaos| first=Michael| last=Smith| date=18 September 2004| accessdate=11 March 2006 | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; published on 18 September 2004. The documents describe issues relating to the meetings held between Bush and Blair at Bush's Crawford, Texas, ranch in April 2002. They are:

#Iraq: Options Paper, prepared by the Overseas &amp; Defence Secretariat in the Cabinet Office, dated 8 March 2002, describing options available for pursuing regime change in Iraq
# Iraq: Legal Background, prepared by the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office Legal Department, dated 8 March 2002
# a report from [[David Manning]] to Tony Blair on his meeting with Condoleezza Rice, dated 14 March 2002
# a report from [[Christopher Meyer]] to [[David Manning]] on his meeting with [[Paul Wolfowitz]], dated 18 March 2002
# a memo from [[Peter Ricketts]], Political Director, Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office, to the Foreign Secretary, [[Jack Straw (politician)|Jack Straw]], dated 22 March 2002, with background and opinion for Straw's advice to Tony Blair ahead of his meeting with [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] in April
# a memo from Jack Straw to Tony Blair, 25 March 2002 containing advice ahead of Blair's meeting with George Bush in April.

On receipt of the documents, in September 2004, acting on the advice of lawyers, Smith says he photocopied them and returned the originals to his source, then, after the ''Telegraph''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s legal desk secretary typed transcripts on an "old fashioned typewriter", the ''Telegraph'' destroyed their copies of the originals, in order to frustrate any future police investigation of the leaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rawstory.com/news/2005/Backstory_Confirming_the_Downing_Street_0614.html |title=Confirming the Downing Street documents |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050617033709/http://rawstory.com/news/2005/Backstory_Confirming_the_Downing_Street_0614.html |archivedate=17 June 2005 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=21 September 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The documents were widely quoted in the British press immediately following the ''Telegraph''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s story, for example in ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1308368,00.html |title=Leaks cast doubt on PM's motive |author1=Ewen MacAskill |author2=Michael White |date=20 September 2004|work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Sunday Herald]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayherald.com/44911 |title=Bush and Blair: Secrets and Lies |work=Sunday Herald |date=19 September  2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060213073626/http://www.sundayherald.com/44911 |archivedate=13 February 2006 |accessdate=11 March 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 October 2004, facsimiles of these documents appeared online,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iraq/1472044/Secret-papers-show-Blair-was-warned-of-Iraq-chaos.html |title=Secret papers show Blair was warned of Iraq chaos}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided by Professor Michael Lewis of [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]], who had also housed the file at Iraq expert [[Glen Rangwala]]'s Middle East Reference website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.middleeastreference.org.uk |title=Middle East Reference: Chronologies and Biographies |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The file derives ultimately from the typed transcript of the documents made by Smith and the ''Telegraph''.

Interest in these documents was revived around 8 June 2005, following their appearance in a discussion thread at [[Democratic Underground]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.democraticunderground.com/discuss/duboard.php?az=view_all&amp;address=104x3809302| title=An earlier leaked memo to Downing Street ... |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0506/S00116.htm |title=Scoop: Another Downing St Memo – Wrongfooting Saddam |accessdate=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently they began to be quoted in US media, after Rawstory and [[NBC]] verified their authenticity with Smith and British government sources.

The ''Los Angeles Times'' published an article on 15 June 2005, describing several of the "new" documents; the article says that "[[Michael Smith (newspaper reporter)|Michael Smith]], the defense writer for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' who revealed the Downing Street minutes in a story 1 May, provided a full text of the six new documents to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-britmemos15jun15,0,7241602,full.story |title=New Memos Detail Early Plans for Invading Iraq |first=John |last=Daniszewski |date=15 June 2005 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six documents are available in PDF form from the Think Progress web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://thinkprogress.org/index.php?p=1078| title= FULL TEXT OF BRITISH BRIEFING PAPERS REVEALED: More Evidence Intel Was Fixed|work=Think Progress| accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A further document, a 21 July 2002, cabinet office paper titled "Conditions for Military Action", which is a briefing paper for the meeting of which the Downing Street Memo is the minutes, was published (with the last page missing) by ''The Sunday Times'' on 12 June 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Sunday Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2089-1648758,00.html |date=12 June  2005 |title=Cabinet Office paper: Conditions for military action |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718133829/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article531957.ece |archivedate=18 July 2011 |location=London |first=Ben |last=Hoyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another document was the Rycroft email, showing the author of the Downing Street Memo actually believed that Saddam should be removed because of a threat by Iraq getting WMDs into the hands of terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://img301.imageshack.us/img301/5055/rycroft5br.jpg |title=Matthew Rycroft email 11 September 2002 11:59 |format=JPG |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Matthew Rycroft email 11 September 2002 11:59 |format=PDF |url=http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-files/Politics/documents/2003/08/21/DOSSIER_mad.pdf |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 18 September 2004 ''Daily Telegraph'' article contains the only known reproductions of the original memos (scanned from a photocopy).  That article is called "Failure is not an option, but it doesn't mean they will avoid it".&lt;ref name="failure is not an option"/&gt;

On Thursday, 16 June 2005 Reuters mislabelled a photograph of what it claimed was "a copy of the Downing Street Memo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/050616/ids_photos_wl/r876363090.jpg |title=404 error |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It turned out to actually be a picture of a document found in a 28 April 2005 Guardian Unlimited story. (At this link, view this PDF:
07.03.03: Attorney general's full advice on Iraq war (pdf)) This PDF detailed Lord Goldsmith’s confidential advice on the legality of the Iraq war and does not match the text of any of the alleged Downing Street Memos. It's an entirely different document that describes legal authorisation for the invasion of Iraq under standing UN resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,2763,1472115,00.html |title=Full Iraq legal advice released |author=Simon Jeffery and Tom Happold |date=28 April 2005 |work=The Guardian |location=London |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of the memo==
Journalists such as [[Fred Kaplan (journalist)|Fred Kaplan]] point out that the later section of the memo that discusses potential consequences of an invasion, including Saddam's use of WMD against Kuwait or Israel, directly contradicts interpretations of the memo as a "smoking gun" about WMD fabrication.&lt;ref name="fixed"/&gt;

{{quote|For instance, what were the consequences, if Saddam used WMD on day one, or if Baghdad did not collapse and urban warfighting began? You said that Saddam could also use his WMD on Kuwait. Or on Israel, added the Defence Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.downingstreetmemo.com/docs/memotext.pdf |title=Downing street memo text |accessdate=16 March 2007&lt;!-- 2005--&gt; |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As mentioned above, shortly after the appearance of the memo, Tony Blair was asked:

{{quote|The so-called Downing Street memo from July 2002 says intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy of removing Saddam through military action. Is this an accurate reflection of what happened?}}

Blair responded:
{{quote|No, the facts were not being fixed in any shape or form at all.}}

It is not clear whether this is a criticism of the assessment of his own head of foreign intelligence (Dearlove) or a criticism of a particular interpretation of Dearlove's phrase "fixed around".

=== "Fixed" ===
The interpretation of the sentence: "But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy." has caused debate.

[[Robin Niblett]], a member of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank, has said it would be easy for Americans to misunderstand the reference to intelligence being "fixed around" Iraq policy. " 'Fixed around' in British English means 'bolted on' rather than altered to fit the policy," he says. This view was seconded by [[Christopher Hitchens]] and [[Fred Kaplan (journalist)|Fred Kaplan]].&lt;ref name="fixed"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2120886 |title=What's really in the downing street memo? |year=2007 |accessdate=16 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have suggested various British English usages of the phrase "were being fixed" (for example as a colloquialism meaning "to agree upon,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/fixed |title= fixed-in Compact Oxford English Dictionary |accessdate=8 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which are distinct from the usage (both American and British) derived from criminal [[argot]], meaning "fraudulently altered or changed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fixed |title= fix-See 7b in Merriam-Webster |accessdate=8 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The author of the memo, [[Matthew Rycroft]], employed the former usage in an e-mail when talking about an appointment, ''This is now fixed for 0800''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/isc/isc_3_0004.pdf |title=Email from Matthew Rycroft, 18 September 2002 17 52 |format=PDF |accessdate=11 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some detractors from the memo have appeared to make the argument or give the impression that the "fraudulently altered" sense of "fix" is uniquely American and does not exist in British English,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} but this is false.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2006/jan/08/features.sport13 |title=The Guardian January 2006 'Match Fixing: a history' Webster |location=London |date=8 January 2006 |accessdate=21 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other commentaters have dismissed this, saying that context makes it clear that "being fixed around" used "fix" in the sense of "fraudulently arrange the result",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200506170003| title=British sources confirm that meaning of "fixed" — as in "manipulated" or "cooked" — is the same in Britain and America |year=2005 |accessdate=21 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a common British usage (sense 12(b) of "fix" in the printed Concise Oxford English Dictionary, given as sense 7, "deviously influence the outcome of" in the Compact OED online version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/fix?view=uk |title=fix as "fraudulently arrange" in British English, see sense 7 of the verb |accessdate=8 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;) The argument has also been made that this view is supported by negative qualification implied by the presence of the word "But" at the start of the relevant sentence: "But the intelligence and facts were being (innocently) ''agreed upon'' around the policy" is, it is said, an implausible reading because there is nothing negative, per se, about agreement, whereas "But the intelligence and facts were being ''fraudulently arranged'' ...", it is argued, appears to make perfect sense, because it fulfills the negative expectation set up by the word "but".

Fred Kaplan noted that "Either way—'fixed' or 'fixed around'—Bush and his aides had decided to let policy shape intelligence, not the other way around; they were explicitly politicising intelligence."

When asked about the memo's implication that Iraq intelligence was being "fixed", White House spokesman Scott McClellan said, "The suggestion is just flat-out wrong."  But McClellan would later admit that intelligence was suited to fit the policy in a tell-all book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0517/dailyUpdate.html |title=Why has "Downing Street memo" story been a "dud" in US? |work=[[Christian Science Monitor]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070406142502/http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0517/dailyUpdate.html |archivedate=6 April 2007 |accessdate=22 September 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An Iraq "options paper", dated 8 March 2002, stated: "Despite sanctions, Iraq continues to develop WMD" (though it adds that intelligence on the matter is "poor").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thinkprogress.org/wp-images/upload/iraqoptionspaper.pdf |title=options paper |year=2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=9 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox 2011–present Libyan factional fighting}}
{{Campaignbox Libyan Crisis (2011–present)}}
Since the end of the [[2011 Libyan Civil War]], which overthrew [[Muammar Gaddafi]], there has been violence involving various militias and the new state security forces. The violence has escalated into the current [[2014 Libyan Civil War]].

The militias include guerrillas, [[Islamism|Islamists]], and militias who fought against Gaddafi but refused to lay down their arms when the war ended in October 2011. According to some civilian leaders, these latter militias shifted from merely delaying the surrender of their weapons to actively asserting a continuing political role as "guardians of the revolution". Some of the largest, and most well-equipped militias are associated with Islamist groups now forming political parties.&lt;ref name="nytoutlast"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/02/world/africa/in-libya-the-fighting-may-outlast-the-revolution.html|title=In Libya, Fighting May Outlast the Revolution|date=1 November 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|first=David D.|last=Kirkpatrick|accessdate=16 November 2011|location=Tripoli}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the official end of hostilities between loyalist and opposition forces, there were reports of sporadic clashes between rival militias, and vigilante revenge killings.&lt;ref name="nytoutlast"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8860684/Libya-revolutionaries-turn-on-each-other-as-fears-grow-for-law-and-order.html|title=Libya: revolutionaries turn on each other as fears grow for law and order|newspaper=The Telegraph|first=Nick|last=Meo|location=Tripoli|date=31 October 2011|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, Islamists [[2012 Benghazi attack|attacked]] the [[United States]] consulate building in [[Benghazi]], killing the US ambassador and three others.

==== November 2011====
On 1 November, a group of intoxicated [[Zintan]] fighters stormed a hospital in Tripoli and demanded the hand-over of a fighter who was wounded earlier in the day in a clash that also left another militiaman dead. The doctors refused and a Tripoli militia, in charge of hospital security, forced the Zintanis out, but not before they shot rounds in the hospital. Both groups received reinforcements and the fighting, involving heavy machine guns and anti-aircraft guns, lasted for three hours. There were no direct fatalities from the fighting, but three patients at the hospital died due to stress-related causes linked to the clashes. Three Tripoli fighters were wounded. The fighting reportedly ended after calls from a local imam and senior commanders from both groups talked by phone with their men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/11/02/world/africa/libya-infighting/index.html|title=Libyan war over, but fighting continues among regional militias|newspaper=CNN|accessdate=26 January 2012|date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November, it was evident that loyalist remnants were also still active in the country, even more than two weeks after their defeat, when a pro-Gaddafi convoy tried to cross the border into Niger and were intercepted by the Nigerien army. 13 loyalists and one Nigerien soldier were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/News/Middle-East/2011/Nov-10/153554-niger-army-clash-with-libyan-convoy-kills-14.ashx#axzz1dci9bHxS|title=Niger army clash with Libyan convoy kills 14 |newspaper=The Daily Star|date=10 November 2011|accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 8 and 12 November, large-scale fighting erupted between Zawiya and Tripoli between a Zawiya-based militia and a group from the Wershifanna tribe. The Zawiya group accused their opponents of belonging to loyalist remnants and they reported of seeing tanks and vehicles with the Gaddafi-era green flag and markings that said "Brigade of the Martyr Muammar Gaddafi". The Wershifanna denied this and stated that the men from Zawiya had been misled by a rumor that pro-Gaddafi fighters were in the area. The fighting was centered around the former loyalist Imaya military base and both sides vied for control. Grad rocket launchers were used at times during the clashes. 9–12 Zawiya fighters and nine Wershifanna fighters were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.armytimes.com/news/2011/11/ap-libya-rival-militias-clash-111311/ |title=Rival Libyan militias continue clashes |work=Army Times |accessdate=26 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holmes |first=Oliver |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/11/12/us-libya-clashes-idUSTRE7AB0HU20111112 |title=Fighters clash again near Tripoli, several dead |agency=Reuters |accessdate=26 January 2012 |date=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 December, Libya's interim government announced that, following consultations with [[Tripoli]]'s local council, it had given militias lingering in the capital until late December to hand over security to the authorities. Officials said residents of Tripoli would convene rallies in support of the initiative to clear the city of weapons and out-of-town fighters. If militias had not withdrawn by 20 December, the authorities and members of the public intended to close the whole city to traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFL5E7N64R920111206| title=Libyan government promises to disarm Tripoli | work=Reuters Africa | date=6 December 2011 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=11 December 2011|location=Tripoli|first1=Taha|last1=Zargoun|first2=Ali|last2=Shuaib}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 2012, the former rebels had dismantled most of their checkpoints, while some key bases still remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/programmes/insidestory/2012/01/2012156215196506.html|work=Al Jazeera|date=8 January 2012|accessdate=14 January 2012|title=Can Libya's armed groups be disbanded?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====October 2013====
In October a United Nations report said that torture and ill-treatment, sometimes resulting in death, was "widespread" in Libyan jails.
This torture was most frequently used "immediately after arrest and during the first days of interrogation" according to the report. The UN estimates about 8,000 people are still being held in relation to the 2011 conflict. The United Nations Support Mission in Libya said it has recorded 27 deaths in custody since late 2011 "where there is significant information to suggest that torture was the cause", with 11 of the cases occurring in 2013. The report did note however that the use of torture was happening "despite the efforts of the Libyan authorities which are committed at the highest level to ending torture and to ensuring the proper functioning of the criminal justice system" and  recommended that detainees held by brigades be handed over to "effective state control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-24356037 | work=BBC News | title=Torture 'widespread' in Libyan jails - UN report | date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====November 2013====
On 16 November, militias from Misrata clashed in Tajoura, an eastern Tripoli suburb where checkpoints were set up to keep outside militia from entering the city. The news followed imams calling for an end to the militias, which in turn led to violence that erupted at an anti-militia protest that also called for resignation of the government the previous day in Tripoli and occurred during mourning for the dead at that protest. At least 45 people were killed and 400 wounded, according to Justice Minister [[Salah al-Marghani]] said.&lt;ref name="Al Arabia"&gt;{{cite news |title=Libya: Misrata militias besiege Tripoli suburb |author=

He said: "We have declared a strike for three days from today, but if our demands are not met we will continue. We will not negotiate with them. Things are as clear as the sun, we want a decision." The call for a strike was to allow "the government, the police and the army." Businesses and schools were closed but essential services like pharmacies, hospitals and petrol pumps were open.

'''Ferdinand Waldo Demara Jr.''' (December 21, 1921&lt;ref&gt;This date is uncertain. Some sources say 12 December 1921, 12 December 1922 or 21 December 1922.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0218075/bio| title= Biography page for Ferdinand Demara| website= IMDb.com| publisher=| date= | access-date= December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; June 7, 1982), known as 'The Great Impostor', masqueraded as many people – from [[monk]]s to [[surgeon]]s to [[prison warden]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1900621_1900618_1900605,00.html | work=Time | title=Top 10 Imposters: Faking It: Ferdinand Demara | date=2009-05-26 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= tale&gt;{{cite news| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=flQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |first= Joe| last= McCarthy| work= Life| date= January 28, 1952 | title= The Master Imposter: An Incredible Tale | pages= 79–89| via= Google Books| access-date= December 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the subject of a movie, ''[[The Great Impostor]]'', in which he was played by [[Tony Curtis]].

Demara's impersonations included a ship's doctor, a [[civil engineer]], a [[sheriff|sheriff's deputy]], an assistant [[prison warden]], a doctor of [[applied psychology]], a hospital orderly, a [[lawyer]], a child-care expert, a [[Benedictine]] monk, a [[Trappist]] monk, an editor, a cancer researcher, and a teacher. One teaching job led to six months in prison. He never seemed to get (or seek) much monetary gain in what he was doing&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; just temporary respectability.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}

Many of Demara's unsuspecting employers, under other circumstances, would have been satisfied with Demara as an employee. Demara was said to possess a true [[Eidetic memory|photographic memory]] and was widely reputed to have an extraordinary IQ. He was apparently able to memorize necessary techniques from textbooks and worked on two cardinal rules: ''The [[legal burden of proof|burden of proof]] is on the accuser'' and ''When in danger, attack.'' He described his own motivation as "Rascality, pure rascality".&lt;ref name = TGI&gt;{{cite book|title=The Great Impostor |first= Robert| last= Crichton| publisher= Random House| year= 1959| isbn= 0-394-42714-9| url= https://archive.org/details/greatimpostor010210mbp}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|218}}

== Early life and adulthood ==
Demara, known locally as 'Fred', was born in [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1921, at 40 Texas Avenue in the lower southwest Tower Hill Neighborhood. His father, Ferdinand Waldo Demara Sr., was born in [[Rhode Island]] and worked in Lawrence's old Theatre District as a motion picture operator. Demara Sr. was financially well-off, and the family lived on Jackson St. in Lawrence, an upper-class neighborhood. Demara Sr.'s brother, Napoleon Louis Demara Sr. owned many of the theatres in Lawrence, in which Demara Sr. was an active [[trade union|union]] member. Early in the [[Great Depression]], Fred's father became financially insolvent, forcing the family to move from the Tower Hill neighborhood to the poorer section in the city.

During this financially troubled time, Demara Jr. ran away from home at age 16 to join the Cistercian monks in Rhode Island, where he stayed for several years.&lt;ref name="Time-1957"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,936819-1,00.html|title=AMERICANA: Ferdinand the Bull Thrower|date=February 25, 1957 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[United States Army]] in 1941.

== Impersonations ==
The following year, Demara began his new lives by borrowing the name of Anthony Ignolia, an army buddy, and going [[AWOL]]. After two more attempts in monasteries, he joined the Navy where he trained as a [[hospital corpsman]].&lt;ref name= tale /&gt;{{rp|80}} He did not reach the position he wanted, faked his suicide and borrowed another name, Robert Linton French, and became a religion-oriented psychologist, who taught psychology at [[Gannon College]] (now a university) in Erie, Pennsylvania. Afterwards, Demara served as an orderly in a Los Angeles sanitarium, and served as an instructor in St. Martin's College (now a university) in the state of Washington. The [[FBI]] captured him, and he served 18 months at the Naval Disciplinary Barracks, [[San Pedro, California|San Pedro]], [[California]] for desertion.&lt;ref name="Time-1957" /&gt;

After his release he assumed a fake identity and studied law at night at Northeastern University, then joined the Brothers of Christian Instruction in [[Maine]], a Roman Catholic order.&lt;ref name="Time-1957" /&gt;

While at the Brothers of Christian Instruction, he became acquainted with a young doctor named Joseph C. Cyr.&lt;ref name="Time-1957" /&gt;
That led to his most famous exploit, in which he masqueraded as Cyr, working as a [[trauma surgeon]] aboard [[HMCS Cayuga (R04)|HMCS ''Cayuga'']], a [[Royal Canadian Navy]] destroyer, during the [[Korean War]]. He managed to improvise successful major surgeries and fend off infection with generous amounts of [[penicillin]]. His most notable surgical practices were performed on some sixteen Korean combat casualties who were loaded onto the ''Cayuga''. All eyes turned to Demara, the only "surgeon" on board, as it became obvious that several of the casualties would require major surgery or certainly die. After ordering personnel to transport these variously injured patients into the ship's operating room and prep them for surgery, Demara disappeared to his room with a textbook on general surgery and proceeded to speed-read the various surgeries he was now forced to perform, including major chest surgery. None of the casualties died as a result of Demara's surgeries. Apparently, the removal of a bullet from a wounded man ended up in Canadian newspapers. One person reading the reports was the mother of the real Joseph Cyr; her son at the time of "his" service in Korea was actually practicing medicine in [[Grand Falls, New Brunswick|Grand Falls]], [[New Brunswick]]. When news of the impostor reached the ''Cayuga,'' still on duty off Korea, Captain James Plomer at first refused to believe Demara was not a doctor (and not Joseph Cyr). However, faced with the embarrassment of having allowed an impostor into its ranks, Canadian officials chose not to press charges. Instead, Demara was quietly dismissed from the Royal Canadian Navy and forced to return to the United States.

=== Philosophy behind Demara's impersonations ===
Demara told his biographer he was successful in his roles because he was able to fit into positions which no one else had previously occupied. Demara explained it in the following excerpt from his biography:{{quote|'(Demara) had come to two beliefs. One was that in any organization there is always a lot of loose, unused power lying about which can be picked up without alienating anyone. The second rule is, if you want power and want to expand, never encroach on anyone else's domain; open up new ones...'}}

Demara referred to it as 'expanding into the power vacuum,' and described as such; 'if you come into a new situation (there's a nice word for it) don't join some other professor's committee and try to make your mark by moving up in that committee. You'll, one, have a long haul and two, make an enemy.' Demara's technique was to find his own committee. 'That way there's no competition, no past standards to measure you by. How can anyone tell you aren't running a top outfit? And then there's no past laws or rules or precedents to hold you down or limit you. Make your own rules and interpretations. Nothing like it. Remember it, expand into the power vacuum!'&lt;ref name = TGI /&gt;{{rp|102–103}}

=== Founded a college ===
During Demara's impersonation as Brother John Payne of the Christian Brothers of Instruction (also known as [[Brothers of Christian Instruction]]), Demara decided to make the religious teaching order more prominent by founding a college in [[Alfred, Maine]]. Demara proceeded on his own, and actually got the college chartered by the state. He then promptly left the religious order in 1951, when the Christian Brothers of Instruction offended him by not naming him as rector or chancellor of the new college and chose what Demara considered to be a terrible name for the college.&lt;ref name = TGI /&gt;{{rp|115–119}} The college Demara founded, [[LaMennais College]] in Alfred, Maine, began in 1951 (when Demara left); in 1959 it moved to [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], [[Ohio]], and in 1960, became Walsh College (now [[Walsh University]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LaMennais Brothers Blogspot| url= http://lamennaisbrothers.blogspot.com/|accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minor fame ===
After this episode, he sold his tale to ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''&lt;ref name= tale /&gt; and worked in short-term jobs, since he had become widely known. He resorted to [[alcoholism|drinking]]. Only after he returned to his old tricks and possessed fake credentials could he get another job at a prison in [[Huntsville, Texas|Huntsville]], [[Texas]]. According to his biographer, Demara's past became known and his position untenable when an inmate found a copy of ''Life'' with an article about the impostor.

On November 5, 1959, Demara appeared on the surrealistic game show hosted by [[Ernie Kovacs]], ''[[Take a Good Look (TV series)|Take a Good Look]]''. The object was for one of the three celebrity panelists to guess his identity. One week later on November 12, 1959, he appeared on an episode of the TV quiz show ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', with Groucho Marx.  Demara recounted his exploits, and said the $1,000 he earned on the program was going to be donated to the 'Feed and Clothe Fred Demara Fund'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial| url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33Rz5yYCeks&amp;index=89&amp;list=PLHaioNpr_GDbvsTj_taM-jO6C1658N1PC | series= [[You Bet Your Life]] |number= 59-08 |title= Ferdinand Demara, 'The Great Imposter' | interviewer= Groucho Marx | first1= Carmen| last1= Phillips| first2= Ferdinand| last2= Demara|date= November 12, 1959| at= 6:48| via= YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demara continued to use new aliases but, as a result of his self-generated publicity, it became much harder to accomplish impersonations than before. In 1960, as a publicity stunt, Demara was given a small acting role in the horror film ''[[The Hypnotic Eye]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title| 0053931| The Hypnotic Eye}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appears briefly in the film as a (genuine) hospital surgeon. By this point, Demara's girth was so notable that he could not avoid attracting attention. Demara had already been considerably overweight during his impersonation of Joseph C. Cyr.

== Later life ==
In the early 1960s Demara worked as a counselor at the [[Union Rescue Mission]] in downtown Los Angeles. In 1967 Demara received a graduate certificate from [[Multnomah School of the Bible]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Oregon]]. His first ministerial assignment was a pastor of the Cherry Grove Baptist Church in [[Gaston, Oregon]]. He was very well liked but soon plagued with rumors about his old life, causing him to resign the position. Many parishioners felt this was yet another con, though many others felt he was taking the position seriously and had legitimate credentials.

Demara had various friendships with a wide variety of notable people during his life, including a close relationship with actor [[Steve McQueen]], to whom Demara delivered last rites in November 1980.

When Demara's past exploits and infamy were discovered in the late 1970s, he was almost dismissed from the Good Samaritan Hospital of Orange County in [[Anaheim, California]], where he worked as a visiting chaplain. Chief of Staff [[Philip S. Cifarelli]], who had developed a close personal friendship with Demara, personally vouched for him and Demara was allowed to remain as chaplain. Demara was a very active and appreciated minister, serving a variety of patients in the hospital. Few of those with whom he interacted at the hospital knew of his colorful past. Due to limited financial resources and his friendships with Cifarelli and Jerry Nilsson, one of the major owners of the hospital, Demara was allowed to live in the hospital until his death, even after illness forced him to stop working for them in 1980.

Demara died on June 7, 1982, at the age of 60 due to heart failure and complications from his diabetic condition, which had required both of his legs to be amputated. According to his obituary in ''[[The New York Times]]'', he had been living in [[Orange County, California]], for eight years. He died at Nilsson's home in Anaheim, California.

== In media ==
Demara's story was recounted in the 1960 book, ''The Great Impostor'', written by [[Robert Crichton (novelist)|Robert Crichton]] and published by [[Random House]]; the book was a ''New York Times'' bestseller and adapted into a 1961 film by the same name starring [[Tony Curtis]] as Demara. A second book by Crichton, ''The Rascal and the Road'', recounted Demara and Crichton's experiences together as Crichton conducted research for ''The Great Impostor''.

[[File:EdinburghNYE.jpg|thumb|right|Fireworks for [[Edinburgh's Hogmanay]]]]
{{Culture of Scotland}}'''Hogmanay''' ({{IPA-sco|ˌhɔɡməˈneː|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;''The Concise Scots Dictionary'' Cambers (1985) {{ISBN|0-08-028491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|lang|ˌ|h|ɒ|ɡ|m|ə|ˈ|n|eɪ}} {{respell|HOG|mə|NAY|'}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Oxford Dictionaries|Hogmanay}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the [[Scots language|Scots]] word for the last day of the year and is synonymous with the celebration of the [[New Year]] ([[Gregorian calendar]]) in the Scottish manner.  It is normally followed by further celebration on the morning of [[New Year's Day]] (1 January) or, in some cases, 2 January—a [[Bank holidays in Scotland|Scottish bank holiday]].

The origins of Hogmanay are unclear, but it may be derived from [[Norse activity in the British Isles|Norse]] and [[Gaels|Gaelic]] observances. Customs vary throughout Scotland, and usually include [[gift-giving]] and visiting the homes of friends and neighbours, with special attention given to the [[first-foot]], the first guest of the new year.

==Etymology==
The [[etymology]] of the word is obscure. The earliest proposed etymology comes from the 1693 ''Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence'', which held that the term was a corruption of the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''{{transl|el|agía mína}}'' ({{lang|el|αγία μήνα}}), or "holy month".&lt;ref name="SPE"&gt;{{cite book |title=Scotch Presbyterian eloquence display'd |publisher=J. Johnson |location=Rotterdam |last1=Crokatt |first1=Gilbert |last2=Monroe |first2=John |date=1738 |orig-year=First published 1693 |page=120 |quote=It is ordinary among some plebeians in the South of Scotland to go about from door to door upon New-years Eve, crying Hagmane, a corrupted Word from the Greek {{lang|el|αγια μηνη}}, which signifies the Holy Month. |url=https://archive.org/stream/scotchpresbyteri00crok#page/120/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three main modern theories derive it from a French, [[Norse language|Norse]] or [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] root.

The word is first recorded in a Latin entry in 1443 annals as ''hagnonayse''.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"hogmanay, n.". OED Online. December 2014. Oxford University Press. (accessed 22 December 2014).&lt;/ref&gt; The first appearance in English came in 1604 in the records of [[Elgin, Moray|Elgin]], as ''hagmonay''.&lt;ref&gt;"delatit to haue been singand hagmonayis on Satirday"&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent 17th-century spellings include ''Hagmena'' (1677),&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; ''Hogmynae night'' (1681),&lt;ref name="OED"/&gt; and ''Hagmane'' (1693) in an entry of the ''Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence''.&lt;ref name="SPE"/&gt;&lt;ref name=DSL&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/entry/snd/hogmanay |title=Hagmane |author= |date= |work=Dictionary of the Scots Language |publisher= |accessdate=21 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although "Hogmanay" is currently the predominant spelling and pronunciation, a number of variant spellings and pronunciations have been recorded, including:&lt;ref name=CSD&gt;Robinson, Mairi (ed) ''The Concise Scots Dictionary'' (1985) The Scottish National Dictionary Association {{ISBN|0-08-028491-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible French etymologies===
It may have been introduced to [[Middle Scots]] via French. The most commonly cited explanation is a derivation from the northern French dialectal word ''hoguinané'', or variants such as ''hoginane'', ''hoginono'' and ''hoguinettes'', those being derived from 16th century [[Middle French]] ''aguillanneuf'' meaning either a gift given at New Year, a children's cry for such a gift, or New Year's Eve itself.&lt;ref name=CSD/&gt;&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;[[John Gregorson Campbell|Campbell, John Gregorson]] (1900, 1902, 2005) ''The Gaelic Otherworld''. Edited by Ronald Black. Edinburgh, Birlinn Ltd. {{ISBN|1-84158-207-7}} p. 575: "'Hogmanay' is French in origin. In northern French dialect it was ''hoguinané'', going back to Middle French ''aguillaneuf'', meaning a gift given on New Year's eve or the word cried out in soliciting it."&lt;/ref&gt; Compare also the apparent Spanish cognate ''aguinaldo/aguilando'', with a suggested Latin derivation of ''{{lang|la|hoc in anno}}'' "in this year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://buscon.rae.es/drae/srv/search?val=aguilando |title=Aguilando |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=www.rae.es |publisher=Real Academia Española |access-date=21 September 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This explanation is supported by a children's tradition, observed up to the 1960s in some parts of Scotland at least, of visiting houses in their locality on New Year's Eve and requesting and receiving small treats such as sweets or fruit. The second element would appear to be ''{{lang|fr|l'an neuf}}'' (the New Year), with some sources suggesting a druidical origin of the practice overall.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica Vol I'' (1823) 6th Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Compare those to [[Norman language|Norman]] ''hoguinané'' and the obsolete customs in [[Jersey]] of crying ''ma hodgîngnole'', and in [[Guernsey]] of asking for an ''oguinane'', for a New Year gift (see also [[La Guiannee]]). In Québec, "la guignolée" was a door-to-door collection for the poor.&lt;ref&gt;Roy, Pierre-Georges [http://www.uquebec.ca/~uss1083/ssvdp/Texte%20de%20Pierre%20Georges%20ROY.pdf Les petites choses de notre histoire] Garneau (1944)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other suggestions include ''au [[wikt:gui#French|gui]] mener'' ("lead to the [[mistletoe]]"),&lt;ref name = Chambers&gt;Chambers, R. ''Popular Rhymes of Scotland'' Chambers (1841) 3rd Edition&lt;/ref&gt; ''à {{linktext|gueux}} mener'' ('bring to the beggars'),&lt;ref name=Chambers/&gt; ''au gui l'an neuf'' ('at the mistletoe the new year', or ''(l')homme est né'' ('(the) man is born').&lt;ref name="scotland.org"&gt;[http://www.scotland.org/whats-on/hogmanay/ "Hogmanay", Scotland.org]. Retrieved 14 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible Goidelic etymologies===
The word may have come from the [[Goidelic languages]]. [[James George Frazer|Frazer]] and Kelley report a [[Manx language|Manx]] new-year song that begins with the line ''To-night is New Year's Night, Hogunnaa'' but did not record the full text in Manx.&lt;ref&gt;Frazer, Sir James George ''The Golden Bough'' 1922&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelley, Ruth ''The Book of Hallowe'en'' (1919)&lt;/ref&gt; Kelley himself uses the spelling ''Og-u-naa... Tro-la-la''&lt;ref&gt;Y Kelley, Yuan ''Fockleyr Gailckagh as Baarlagh'' (1866) The Manx Society&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other sources parse this as ''hog-un-naa'' and give the modern Manx form as ''Hob dy naa''.&lt;ref name = Folklore&gt;''Folk-lore – A Quarterly Review of Myth, Tradition, Institution and Custom Vol II'' (1891) The Folk-lore Society&lt;/ref&gt; Manx dictionaries though give ''[[Hop-tu-Naa]]'' ({{IPA-gv|hopʰ tθu neː}}), generally glossing it as "Hallowe'en",&lt;ref name=Brod&gt;Broderick, G. ''A Handbook of Late Spoken Manx'' Niemeyer (1984) {{ISBN|3-484-42904-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fargher, Douglas ''Fockleyr Baarle-Gaelg'' (1979) Shearwater Press {{ISBN|0-904980-23-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; same as many of the more Manx-specific folklore collections.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, A.W. ''Manx Ballads &amp; Music'' (1896) G R Johnson&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context it is also recorded that in the south of Scotland (for example [[Roxburghshire]]), there is no {{angbr|m}}, the word thus being ''Hunganay'', which could suggest the {{angbr|m}} is intrusive.&lt;ref name = Folklore/&gt;

Another theory occasionally encountered is a derivation from the phrase ''thog mi an èigh/eugh'' ({{IPA-gd|hok mi ˈɲeː|}}, "I raised the cry"), which resembles ''Hogmanay'' in pronunciation and was part of the rhymes traditionally recited at New Year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article62422547 |title=Origin of Hogmanay |author= |date=5 January 1940 |work=Townsville Daily Bulletin |publisher= |accessdate=1 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it is unclear if this is simply a case of [[folk etymology]].

Overall, Gaelic consistently refers to the New Year's Eve as ''Oidhche na Bliadhn(a) Ùir(e)'' ("the Night of the New Year") and ''Oidhche Challainn'' ("the Night of the [[Calends]]").&lt;ref&gt;MacBain, A. ''Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language'' (1896)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dwelly, E. ''The Illustrated Gaelic-English Dictionary'' (1941)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark, Colin ''The Gaelic-English Dictionary'' (2004) Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-29761-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible Norse etymologies===
Some authors reject both the French and Goidelic theories, and instead suggest that the ultimate source both for the Norman French, Scots, and Goidelic variants of this word have a common Norse root.&lt;ref name = Harrison&gt;Harrison, W. ''Mona Miscellany'' (1869) Manx Society&lt;/ref&gt; It is suggested that the full forms
* "Hoginanaye-Trollalay/Hogman aye, Troll a lay" (with a Manx cognate ''Hop-tu-Naa, Trolla-laa'')
* "Hogmanay, Trollolay, give us of your white bread and none of your gray"&lt;ref&gt;Chambers, R. ''Popular Rhymes of Scotland'' (1841) W&amp;R Chambers p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
invoke the hill-men ([[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''haugmenn'', cf [[Old English|Anglo-Saxon]] ''hoghmen'') or "elves" and banishes the [[troll]]s into the sea (Norse ''á læ'' "into the sea").&lt;ref name = Harrison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Repp&gt;Repp, Thorl ''On the Scottish Formula of Congratulation on New Year's Eve – "Hogmanay, Trollalay" (1831) Transactions of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland Vol IV''&lt;/ref&gt; Repp furthermore makes a link between "Trollalay/Trolla-laa" and the rhyme recorded in ''[[Percy's Relics]]'': "Trolle on away, trolle on awaye. Synge heave and howe rombelowe trolle on away", which he reads as a straightforward invocation of troll-banning.&lt;ref name = Repp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Percy, Thomas ''Percy's Reliques'' (1765)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The roots of Hogmanay perhaps reach back to the celebration of the [[winter solstice]] among the [[Norsemen|Norse]],&lt;ref name=Johnson&gt;[http://www.historic-uk.com/HistoryUK/HistoryofScotland/The-History-of-Hogmanay/ Johnson, Ben. "The History of Hogmanay", Historic UK]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as incorporating customs from the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] celebration of [[Samhain]]. The [[Viking]]s celebrated [[Yule]],&lt;ref name=Johnson/&gt; which later contributed to the [[Twelve Days of Christmas]], or the "Daft Days" as they were sometimes called in Scotland. Christmas was not celebrated as a festival and Hogmanay was the more traditional celebration in Scotland.&lt;ref name="scotland.org" /&gt; This may have been a result of the [[Protestant Reformation]] after which Christmas was seen as "too [[Papist]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/12/1230_021231_hogmanay.html Bogle, Lara Suziedelis. "Scots Mark New Year With Fiery Ancient Rites", ''National Geographic News'', 31 December 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Customs==
There are many customs, both national and local, associated with Hogmanay.  The most widespread national custom is the practice of [[first-footing]], which starts immediately after midnight. This involves being the first person to cross the threshold of a friend or neighbour and often involves the giving of symbolic gifts such as [[salt]] (less common today), [[coal]], [[shortbread]], [[whisky]], and [[black bun]] (a rich [[fruit cake]]), intended to bring different kinds of luck to the householder. Food and drink (as the gifts) are then given to the guests. This may go on throughout the early hours of the morning and well into the next day (although modern days see people visiting houses well into the middle of January). The first-foot is supposed to set the luck for the rest of the year. Traditionally, tall, dark-haired men are preferred as the first-foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/highlandsandislands/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8434000/8434760.stm|title=Hogmanay traditions, old and new|publisher=BBC|date=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local customs===
{{refimprove section|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Stonehave fireballs 2003.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Stonehaven Fireballs Ceremony 2003|[[Stonehaven]] Fireballs Ceremony 2003]][[File:Catalonian Sun Goddess.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Catalan Sun Goddess from the Hogmanay Street Party, [[Edinburgh]] 2005]]
An example of a local Hogmanay custom is the fireball swinging that takes place in [[Stonehaven]], [[Aberdeenshire]], in northeast Scotland. This involves local people making up "balls" of chicken wire filled with old newspaper, sticks, rags, and other dry flammable material up to a diameter of {{convert|2|ft}}, each attached to about {{convert|3|ft}} of wire, chain or nonflammable rope.  As the Old Town House bell sounds to mark the new year, the balls are set alight and the swingers set off up the High Street from the Mercat Cross to the Cannon and back, swinging the burning balls around their heads as they go.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

At the end of the ceremony, any fireballs that are still burning are cast into the harbour. Many people enjoy this display, and large crowds flock to see it,&lt;ref name= "StonehavenFireballs"&gt;[http://www.stonehavenfireballs.co.uk/ Stonehaven Fireball Association] photos and videos of festivities. Retrieved 31 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; with 12,000 attending the 2007/2008 event.&lt;ref name="pandj"&gt;[http://www.thisisaberdeen.co.uk/displayNode.jsp?nodeId=148760&amp;command=displayContent&amp;sourceNode=148586&amp;contentPK=19422957&amp;folderPk=85349&amp;pNodeId=148317 Aberdeen Press and Journal] 2 January 2008. "around 12,000 turned out in Stonehaven to watch the town's traditional fireball ceremony." Retrieved 3 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, additional attractions have been added to entertain the crowds as they wait for midnight, such as [[Fire dancing|fire poi]], a [[pipe band]], street drumming and a firework display after the last fireball is cast into the sea. The festivities are now [[livestreaming|streamed live]] over the Internet.&lt;ref name="StonehavenFireballs" /&gt; 
Another example of a pagan fire festival is the [[burning the clavie]] in the town of [[Burghead]] in [[Moray]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In the east coast fishing communities and [[Dundee]], first-footers once carried a decorated [[herring]]. And in [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]] in [[Fife]], local men marched in torchlight procession to the top of the [[Lomond Hills]] as midnight approached. Bakers in [[St Andrews]] baked special cakes for their Hogmanay celebration (known as "Cake Day") and distributed them to local children.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Institutions also had their own traditions. For example, amongst the Scottish regiments, officers waited on the men at special dinners while at the bells, the Old Year is piped out of barrack gates. The sentry then challenges the new escort outside the gates: "Who goes there?" The answer is "The New Year, all's well."&lt;ref name="visitscotland"&gt;'[http://www.visitscotland.com/library/hogmanaytraditions Hogmanay Traditions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217033654/http://www.visitscotland.com/library/hogmanaytraditions |date=17 December 2007 }}' at ''[http://www.visitscotland.com Scotland's Tourism Board]''. Retrieved 21 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

An old custom in the Highlands – which has survived to a small extent and seen some degree of revival{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} – is to celebrate Hogmanay with the ''[[saining]]'' ([[Scots language|Scots]] for 'protecting, blessing') of the household and livestock. Early on New Year's morning, householders drink and then sprinkle 'magic water' from 'a dead and living [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]' around the house (a 'dead and living ford' refers to a river ford that is routinely crossed by both the living and the dead). After the sprinkling of the water in every room, on the beds and all the inhabitants, the house is sealed up tight and branches of juniper are set on fire and carried throughout the house and byre. The juniper smoke is allowed to thoroughly fumigate the buildings until it causes sneezing and coughing among the inhabitants.  Then all the doors and windows are flung open to let in the cold, fresh air of the new year.  The woman of the house then administers 'a restorative' from the whisky bottle, and the household sits down to its New Year breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first =F.

=== "Auld Lang Syne"===
{{main|Auld Lang Syne}}
[[File:John Masey Wright - John Rogers - Robert Burns - Auld Lang Syne.jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Masey Wright]] and John Rogers' c. 1841 illustration of ''[[Auld Lang Syne]]''.]]
The Hogmanay custom of singing "Auld Lang Syne" has become common in many countries. "Auld Lang Syne" is a Scots poem by [[Robert Burns]], based on traditional and other earlier sources. It is now common to sing this in a circle of linked arms that are crossed over one another as the clock strikes midnight for New Year's Day, though it is only intended that participants link arms at the beginning of the final verse, co-ordinating with the lines of the song that contain the lyrics to do so.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Auld Lang Syne is now sung regularly at "[[The Proms#Last Night of the Proms|The Last Night of the Proms]]" in London by the full audience with their arms crossed over one another.

==In the media==
Between 1957 and 1968, a New Year's Eve television programme, ''[[The White Heather Club]]'', was presented to herald in the Hogmanay celebrations.
The show was presented by [[Andy Stewart (musician)|Andy Stewart]] who always began by singing "Come in, come in, it's nice to see you...." The show always ended with Andy Stewart and the cast singing, "Haste ye Back":

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Haste ye back, we loue you dearly,
Call again you're welcome here.
May your days be free from sorrow,
And your friends be ever near.

May the paths o'er which you wander,
Be to you a joy each day.
Haste ye back we loue you dearly,
Haste ye back on friendship's way.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

The performers were [[Jimmy Shand]] and band, [[Ian Powrie]] and his band, Scottish country dancers: Dixie Ingram and the Dixie Ingram Dancers, Joe Gordon Folk Four, James Urquhart, Ann &amp; Laura Brand, [[Moira Anderson]] &amp; [[Kenneth McKellar (singer)|Kenneth McKellar]]. All the male dancers and Andy Stewart wore kilts, and the female dancers wore long white dresses with tartan sashes.
Following the demise of the ''White Heather Club'', Andy Stewart continued to feature regularly in TV Hogmanay shows until his retirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/a-funny-wee-idea-for-a-show-ian-jack-misses-andy-stewart-and-the-whole-white-heather-club-crowd-1511360.html|title=A funny wee idea for a show: Ian Jack misses Andy Stewart and the whole 'White Heather Club' crowd|publisher=The Independent|date=16 October 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last appearance was in 1992.

In the 1980s comedian [[Andy Cameron]] presented the ''Hogmanay Show'' (on STV in 1983 and 1984 and from 1985 to 1990 on [[BBC Scotland]]) while Peter Morrison presented the show ''A Highland Hogmanay'' on STV/Grampian, axed in 1993.

For many years, a staple of New Year's Eve television programming in Scotland was the [[comedy sketch]] show ''[[Scotch and Wry]]'', featuring the comedian [[Rikki Fulton]], which invariably included a hilarious monologue from him as the preternaturally gloomy Reverend I.M. Jolly.

Since 1993, the programmes that have been mainstays on BBC Scotland on Hogmanay have been ''[[Hogmanay Live]]'' and [[Jonathan Watson]]'s football-themed sketch comedy show, ''[[Only an Excuse?]]''.

==Presbyterian influence==
The 1693 ''Scotch Presbyterian Eloquence'' contained one of the first mentions of the holiday in official church records.&lt;ref name="SPE"/&gt; Hogmanay was treated with general disapproval. Still, in Scotland Hogmanay and New Year's Day are as important as [[Christmas Eve]] and [[Christmas Day]].

Although Christmas Day held its normal religious nature in Scotland amongst its [[Catholic Church in Scotland|Catholic]] and Episcopalian communities, the Presbyterian national church, the [[Church of Scotland]], discouraged the celebration of Christmas for nearly 400 years; it only became a public holiday in Scotland in 1958. Conversely, 1 and 2 January are public holidays and Hogmanay still is associated with as much celebration as Christmas in Scotland. Most Scots still celebrate New Year's Day with a special dinner, usually [[steak pie]].&lt;ref name="aberdeen"&gt;'[http://www.aboutaberdeen.com/hogmanaycustoms.php Scottish Hogmanay Customs and Traditions at New Year]' at ''[http://www.aboutaberdeen.com About Aberdeen]''.

[[File:Edinburgh Hogmanay Longship.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Viking longship]] is burnt during Edinburgh's annual Hogmanay celebrations (though Edinburgh has no historical connection with those [[Norse in Scotland|Norse who invaded]] Scotland).]]

==Major celebrations==
As in much of the world, the largest Scottish cities – [[Glasgow]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Aberdeen]] – hold all-night celebrations, as do [[Stirling]] and [[Inverness]].  The [[Edinburgh Hogmanay]] celebrations are among the largest in the world. Celebrations in Edinburgh in 1996–97 were recognised by the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as the world's largest New Years party, with approximately 400,000 people in attendance. Numbers have since been restricted due to safety concerns.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 2003-4 most of the organised events were cancelled at short notice due to very high winds. The Stonehaven Fireballs went ahead as planned, however, with some 6,000 people braving the stormy weather to watch 42 fireball swingers process along the High Street.&lt;ref name="sfa"&gt;'[http://stonehavenfireballs.co.uk/history History of the Stonehaven Fireballs Ceremony]', 3 January 2008, at ''Stonehaven Fireballs Association''. Retrieved 3 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the 2006–07 celebrations in Edinburgh, Glasgow and Stirling were all cancelled on the day, again due to high winds and heavy rain.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;'[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/6221557.stm Weather spoils Hogmanay parties]', 1 January 2007, at ''BBC News, Scotland''. Retrieved 21 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aberdeen celebration, however, went ahead, and was opened by the pop music group, [[Wet Wet Wet]].

==Handsel Day==
{{main|Handsel Day}}
Historically, presents were given in Scotland on the first Monday of the New Year. A roast dinner would be eaten to celebrate the festival. ''[[wikt:handsel|Handsel]]'' was a word for gift and hence "Handsel Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|Handsel}} "A gift or present (expressive of good wishes)".&lt;/ref&gt; In modern Scotland this practice has died out.

The '''Hove Festival''' ({{lang-no|Hovefestivalen}}) was a [[music festival]] held on the island [[Tromøya]] outside of [[Arendal]] in southern [[Norway]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crackintheroad.com/music/2002-review-hove-festival-norway  "Review: Hove Festival (Norway)"] ''Crack In The Road''&lt;/ref&gt; It was held for the first time from 26 – 30 June 2007. Running for eight years and at one time the largest festival music festival in Norway&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.last.fm/event/79571 Last FM Calendar]&lt;/ref&gt;, Hove Festival was discontinued after its 2014 show due to negative profits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.tnp.no/norway/culture/4627-traditional-hove-festival-is-shut-down-norway-music|title=Traditional Hove Festival is Shut Down|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hove Festival was acquired by [[Festival Republic]] in 2008 after going bankrupt. As with other [[Festival Republic]] events, there were no age restrictions, and children under the age of 12 were admitted free of charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hovefestivalen.no/Default.aspx?articleID=50 Hove Festival official website in Norwegian]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Hove strove to be an environmentally neutral festival&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/2185591 Hove Festival 2007: the DiS review]. ''Drowned in Sound''.&lt;/ref&gt;, both buying carbon offset quotes for all power and transportation used during and prior to the festival, and sorting and recycling all trash produced by the event. Preparation for the festival relied heavily on volunteer work. In 2010 there were a total of 2,500 people volunteering for security, stage hand, drivers, kitchen duty and post-festival cleanup.

Hove consisted of several different areas such as the camp area, festival area and "zero" area. The camp held up to 10,000 campers and was open throughout the festival. The festival area, including the shopping street, was open to everyone who had a day bracelet or festival bracelet. The zero area, which has several fast-food shops,  was open to everyone with or without bracelet.

The festival had three main performance stages: ''Hovescenen'', ''Amfiscenen'' and ''Teltscenen'' (tent stage), with ''Hovescenen'' being the largest. One of the more prominent acts at Hovescenen was [[Muse (band)|Muse]] in 2010.

'''Infinity Hall''' is an American performing arts venue located in [[Norfolk, Connecticut]], located in a historic building from 1883. Another venue also named Infinity Hall is operated by the same company in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].

==Infinity Hall, Norfolk==
===History===
The venue was constructed in 1883 and originally functioned as a combination [[opera house]], barber shop and saloon.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;Minor, E. Kyle (July 18, 1999). [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A03EED9173FF93BA25754C0A96F958260 "The View From/Norfolk; Raising the Curtain on an Old Jewel"]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. Retrieved July 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  The building was chartered as the '''Norfolk Village Hall''', although it was commonly known as the '''Norfolk Opera House'''. It was designed by the architect George Palliser, from Bridgeport, Connecticut, who published its design in his book, ''Palliser's Court Houses, Village, Town and City Halls, Jails and Plans of Other Public Buildings'' (1889).

The Norfolk Opera House hosted [[vaudeville]] and theatrical presentations until the late 1940s. For the following four decades, it was used as a [[restaurant]] and a [[grocery store]]. The building was closed in 1994 and remained vacant for four years.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;
In 1998 Kimberly Gelvin-Melville (now Kimberly Gelvin-Wilks) was given "right to first refusal" to try to get the townspeople or someone else to buy and restore the old opera house as a theater and not apartments or offices. She then produced a theater play in the dead of winter to try to draw public awareness of this glorious opera house she wished to run her own theater company in with the help of Trustees. '''The Four Poster''' was produced at '''The White Hart Inn''' in Salisbury and the Smithies saw the article in the tristate paper, Litchfield Times, about the building and Kimberly Gelvin-Melville's desire to save it. She gave the Smithies permission to purchase it because they liked all of her ideas to turn it back into a theater and run shops downstairs to help finance it. In 1998, the building was purchased by playwrights and theater producers Maura Cavanaugh and Richard Smithies for US$50,000, who undertook a US$650,000 restoration that included the rebuilding of an observation tower that was part of the original structure.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Cavanaugh and Smithies renamed the venue the '''Greenwoods Theater''' and brought dramatic and musical productions to its stage.  Mr. Smithie had asked Kimberly to play Cleopatra in a future production but sadly Mrs. Cavanaugh Smithie decided she did not wish to include Kimberly as a director or actress for fear of her getting the credit for their restorations. The theater was restored and Kimberly attended the opening but then returned to live in Australia with her former husband and daughter.

Cavanaugh and Smithies operated the Greenwoods Theater until early 2007, when financial difficulties forced them to close the venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=July 2016}} [http://www.courant.com/news/opinion/commentary/hc-plchosley.artjan04,0,5658414.story "A Pitch-Perfect Vision for Opera House"]. ''[[Hartford Courant]]''. January 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rebirth as Infinity Hall===
The venue was purchased by Dan Hincks for US $240,000 in a tax auction on February 3, 2007.&lt;ref name=FW&gt;{{dead link|date=July 2016}} [http://www.fairfieldweekly.com/article_print.cfm?aid=10062 "The New Guys"].  ''[[Fairfield Weekly]]''. October 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Hincks, the chief executive officer of the [[Farmington, Connecticut]]-based printing and publishing business Data Management, undertook further interior and exterior restorations of the venue, including substantial structural improvements, a new restaurant named Infinity Bistro, a Meyer sound system, modern [[green room]] facilities, cabaret mezzanine seating, new wood finishing and expansion of the lower level. The resulting renovation created a 300-seat performing arts theater and restaurant destination. Hincks renamed the venue as Infinity Hall, telling an interviewer: "I called it Infinity because the sky is the limit when it comes to bringing people together with music."&lt;ref name=FW /&gt;

Infinity Hall's opening night was October 17, 2008, with a concert by singer [[Kenny Rankin]]. Subsequent concerts featuring [[Melissa Manchester]], [[Spyro Gyra]], [[Richie Havens]] and [[Todd Rundgren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=July 2016}} [http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=20200890&amp;BRD=1666&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=553674&amp;rfi=6 "Center Stage – Music Hall Ready to Put on a Show"]. ''[[Farmington Post]]''. November 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2009, an in-house bistro was opened.&lt;ref name=FW /&gt;  In its first two years, Infinity Hall hosted more than 400 concerts attracting in excess of 80,000 patrons.  In 2010, Infinity Music Hall was voted Best Music Hall in New England by ''[[Yankee (magazine)|Yankee]]'' magazine.

Infinity Bistro, which opened May 1, 2009, was voted Best New Restaurant in [[Litchfield County, Connecticut|Litchfield County]] and runner-up statewide in 2010 by a readers poll for ''[[Connecticut Magazine]]''.

Beginning in 2012, [[Connecticut Public Television]] and [[American Public Television]] began a series of live musical performances at Infinity Hall by well-known artists as part of their ''Infinity Hall Live'' television series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ihlive.org/ "Infinity Hall Live"]. Television series, [[Connecticut Public Television]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infinity Hall, Hartford==
Infinity Hall, Hartford is located in a modern building on 32 Front Street, in the Front Street Entertainment District, near the [[Connecticut Convention Center]]. It seats about 500 total – 415 on the stage level plus 90 in the mezzanine. The mezzanine offers full wait service for dining before and during shows.

The '''2008 Istanbul Fireworks Explosion''' occurred on 1 February 2008. An unlicensed [[fireworks]] factory exploded accidentally, leaving by some reports at least 22 people dead and at least 100 injured;&lt;ref name = nytimes &gt;{{cite news | title = Fireworks Explosion in Istanbul Kills 22 | date = 2008-02-01 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/01/world/europe/01turkey.html?hp | work = THE NEW YORK TIMES | accessdate = 2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; others sources reported the death toll was 17 and 40 injured.&lt;ref name = skynews &gt;{{cite news | title = Illegal Fireworks Blast Leaves 17 Dead | date = 2008-01-31 | url = http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/1303378 | work = SKY News | accessdate = 2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The building that housed the unlicensed factory was in [[Davutpaşa]], an industrial neighborhood.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14370">'''Jaspal Singh Atwal''' (born 1955) is a convicted attempted murderer, Indo-Canadian businessman, a [[Khalistan]]i sympathizer, and a member of the now-banned [[Sikhism]] extremist group [[International Sikh Youth Federation]]. He is known for being among four [[Sikhism in Canada|Canadian Sikhs]] who attempted to assassinate [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] minister [[Malkiat Singh Sidhu]] in 1986.&lt;ref name=NationalPost /&gt; He was involved in the 1985 attack of [[List of premiers of British Columbia|33rd]] [[Premier of British Columbia]] [[Ujjal Dosanjh]], a strong opposer of the [[Khalistan]]i movement.&lt;ref name=NationalPost /&gt; In 2010, he was accused of being part of in an automobile fraud case but was ruled out by the Supreme Court of Canada.&lt;ref name=NationalPost /&gt; In February 2018, Atwal gained attention when he was invited by [[Canada]] prime minister [[Justin Trudeau]] to a reception during a visit to [[India]] and would eventually have his invitation revoked the next day. That same year, he was arrested for issuing death threats to a local radio in [[British Columbia]].

== Background ==
Jaspal Atwal was originally from [[Pharala]] near a [[Phagwara]] district in [[Punjab, India]].&lt;ref name=ThePrint&gt;https://theprint.in/security/terrorist-centre-trudeau-reception-row-chequered-past/37512/&lt;/ref&gt; He left for [[Canada]] at a young age and claimed to study at [[British Columbia Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=TheHindu&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/khalistan-separatist-jaspal-atwal-migrated-to-canada-at-a-young-age/article22828217.ece|title=Khalistan separatist Jaspal Atwal migrated to Canada at a young age|date=22 February 2018|publisher=|via=www.thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He visited [[India]] once in the past few years, with a [[Facebook]] post of him visiting the [[Taj Mahal]].&lt;ref name=ThePrint /&gt; He is involved in construction business and is currently associated with Media Wave Communications, which runs a Surrey-based online radio station.&lt;ref name=TheHindu /&gt; He was also involved in numerous liberal campaigns and was seen taking pictures with hockey star [[Wayne Gretzky]] and other liberal politicians such as [[Sukh Dhaliwal]], [[Justin Trudeau]], and [[Michael Ignatieff]].&lt;ref name=TheStar /&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== Assassination attempts ===
In 1985, Atwal was charged in an attack [[Ujjal Dosanjh]], a strong opposer of the Khalistan movement, but was later acquitted.&lt;ref name=NationalPost /&gt; Dosanjh stated that Atwal attacked him with an iron bar over his opposition to Sikh extremism.&lt;ref name=TheGlobeAndMail&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/trudeau-says-sikh-extremist-should-not-have-been-invitation-to-reception/article38062142/|title=Former B.C. premier ‘speechless’ about invite to Sikh extremist Atwal|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack left Dosanjh severely injured with 80 stitches and a broken hand.&lt;ref name=TheGlobeAndMail /&gt; Senior Punjab journalist Baljit Singh Balli, who met Atwal, claimed that Atwal was not involved in any attack and that he was being wrongly charged.&lt;ref name="ThePrint" /&gt; Dosanjh would go on to be the 33rd [[Premier of British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=ThePrint /&gt;

=== Justin Trudeau visit to India ===
Atwal sparked controversy when he was invited by [[Justin Trudeau]] to a reception during a visit to [[India]].&lt;ref name=NationalPost&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalpost.com/news/politics/what-we-know-about-jaspal-atwal|title=What we know about Jaspal Atwal, the attempted murderer invited to dine with Trudeau|date=22 February 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was seen photographed with [[Sophie Grégoire Trudeau]] and [[Minister of Infrastructure and Communities|Infrastructure Minister]] [[Amarjeet Sohi]] at an event in [[Mumbai]] and was invited to the event by [[Randeep Sarai]].&lt;ref name=NationalPost /&gt; Ujjal Dosanjh criticized Trudeau for inviting Atwal by stating "Do you have no shame?" and stated that the [[Canada–India relations|relations]] between Canada and India were rock bottom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/asithappens/as-it-happens-thursday-edition-1.4547153/former-liberal-cabinet-minister-blasts-trudeau-over-attempted-murderer-s-delhi-dinner-invite-1.4547156|title=Former Liberal cabinet minister blasts Trudeau over attempted murderer's Delhi dinner invite  - CBC Radio|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TheStar&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/02/22/trudeau-faces-more-trouble-on-india-trip-after-invitation-error-reports-of-snub-by-indian-pm-modi.html|title=India-Canada relations at ‘rock bottom’ after Trudeau invitation error, ex-Liberal cabinet minister says - The Star|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atwal's invitation was rescinded the next day and Trudeau stated that he should have never been invited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-43154358|title=Trudeau cancels invite to Sikh separatist|date=22 February 2018|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.business-standard.com/article/current-affairs/khalistani-terrorist-atwal-should-never-have-been-invited-justin-trudeau-118022200718_1.html|title=Khalistani terrorist Atwal should never have been invited: Justin Trudeau|first=|last=ANI|date=22 February 2018|publisher=|via=Business Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was removed from India's travel blacklist several months ago, while the Indian government stated that he wasn't a security threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2018/02/22/trudeau-says-convicted-sikh-extremist-should-not-have-been-invited-to-event-in-india.html|title=Convicted Sikh extremist had been removed from India’s travel blacklist, Star told - The Star|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kachin conflict''' or '''Kachin War''' is one of the multiple conflicts collectively referred to as the [[internal conflict in Myanmar]]. [[Kachin people|Kachin]] [[Insurgency|insurgents]] have been fighting [[Tatmadaw|government soldiers]] since 1961, with only one [[ceasefire]] being brokered between them, which lasted for 17 years from 1994 to 2011.

Since the resumption of hostilities in 2011, thousands of civilians have been killed, whilst over 100,000 have been displaced.

== Background ==
{{further|Kachin people}}
The [[Kachin people]] (or Jingpo) are a confederation of six [[ethnic group]]s whose homeland encompasses territory in the [[Kachin Hills]] of northern [[Myanmar]], in southern [[China]] ([[Yunnan]]) and in [[Northeast India|northeastern India]]. Following Burmese independence from the [[United Kingdom]], many ethnic minorities, including the Kachins, campaigned for [[self-determination]] and independence. The [[Kachin Independence Organisation]] (KIO) was founded in 1960 by dissidents as a result of the grievances between the majority-[[Bamar people|Bamar]] union government and the Kachin people. The [[Kachin Independence Army]] (KIA) was established as its armed wing in 1961, acting as a private army with 27 members. In the early 1960s the KIA began expanding and increasing in numbers, especially after the [[1962 Burmese coup d'état]] and its perceived threat by ethnic minorities.

== First conflict (1961–1994) ==
{{further|Kachin Independence Army#History}}
Following the unilateral abrogation of the [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–62|Union of Burma]]'s constitution by General [[Ne Win]] and his regime in 1962, many Kachin soldiers in the [[Tatmadaw]] (armed forces) defected and joined the [[Kachin Independence Army]] (KIA). The KIA did not only fight government soldiers, but occasionally clashed with [[Communism|communists]] outside and inside their own ranks. The [[Communist Party of Burma]] (CPB) had periodically been the KIA's ally and enemy during different years, and a communist-backed faction split from the KIA in 1989, becoming the [[New Democratic Army - Kachin]] (NDA-K).

Aside from its major towns and railway corridor, KIA-controlled areas in [[Kachin State]] remained virtually independent and isolated from the rest of Myanmar from the mid-1960s through 1994, with an economy based on cross-border [[Jade trade in Myanmar|jade trade]] with [[China]] and [[Illegal drug trade|narcotics trafficking]].

After a military offensive by the [[Myanmar Army]] in 1994 seized most of the jade mines in Kachin State, the KIA signed a ceasefire agreement with the then-ruling [[State Peace and Development Council|SLORC military junta]] on 24 February 1994, which resulted in an end to large-scale fighting that lasted until June 2011.

Armed clashes erupted between the [[Kachin Independence Army]] (KIA) and the [[Myanmar Army]] on 9 June 2011, when government forces broke the ceasefire and attacked KIA positions along the [[Taping River]] east of [[Bhamo]], [[Kachin State]], near the ''Taping [[hydroelectric plant]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{citation | title = More war than peace in Myanmar | first = Bertil | last = Lintner | newspaper = Asian Times | date = 18 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting occurred throughout Kachin State, as well as northwestern parts of [[Shan State]].&lt;ref name="kachinnews.com"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kachinnews.com/news/2269-burma-army-buildup-near-laiza-suggests-push-for-kio-capital.html |title=Burma army buildup near Laiza suggests push for KIO capital |publisher= Kachin news | accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 2014, KIA insurgents captured two hydroelectric plants and took six government soldiers and several Chinese workers hostage for several hours, before the Myanmar Army stormed the buildings. A total of six people were killed and four others were wounded in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://wikileaks.org/gifiles/docs/13/1353385_myanmar-instability-in-kachin-and-a-powerful-neighbor-to-the.html|title=Myanmar: Instability in Kachin and a Powerful Neighbor to the East |date=15 November 2011 |accessdate=5 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to news reports, the recent fighting broke out as a result of the Burmese government's attempts to seize KIA-controlled areas, which are located around lucrative energy projects in Kachin and Shan State [[China and the Kachin State|backed by the Chinese government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.dvb.no/news/kachin-army-ambush-leaves-30-dead/16494 |title=Kachin army ambush leaves 30 dead | publisher = DVB Multimedia Group |date=8 July 2011 |accessdate= 19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a December 2011 statement by Myanmar's President [[Thein Sein]] that he had ordered the Myanmar Army to cease its offensive in Kachin State, the conflict continued into 2012.&lt;ref name="theaustralian.com.au"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/suu-kyi-should-help-with-kachin/story-fn3dxix6-1226548136647 |title= Suu Kyi 'should' help with Kachin | work =The Australian |accessdate=19 February 2015 |date=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 ===
In 2012, the largest battles of the reignited conflict occurred in March, along the [[Myitkyina]]–[[Bhamo]] road.&lt;ref name="kachinnews.com" /&gt;  In April, the battle for Pangwa in [[Chipwi Township]] near [[Luchang]] was fought between the KIA and the government soldiers. Clashes erupted again in late April, when the KIA launched an offensive to capture Burmese military posts around [[Pangwa]]. The KIA offensive succeeded and the Myanmar Army retreated from the area by the end of April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kachinnews.com/~kngenmvs/news/2487-fighting-between-kio-and-army-continues-in-chipwe-pangwa.html |title=Fighting between KIO and army continues in Chipwe, Pangwa |publisher=Kachinnews.com |date=2013-02-25 |accessdate=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kachinnews.com/news/2285-kio-tightens-grip-on-former-nda-k-stronghold-pangwa.html |title=KIO tightens grip on former NDA-K stronghold Pangwa |publisher=Kachinnews.com |date= |accessdate=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://conflictsinburma.crowdmap.com/reports/view/821 |title=Kachin rebel forces seize Pangwa |publisher=Conflictsinburma.crowdmap.com |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the KIA claimed that 140 government troops were killed when they exploded mines buried inside the ''Myauk Phyu'' ("White Monkey") jade mine, which was owned by the ''Wai Aung Kaba Company''.&lt;ref name="Hpakant"&gt;{{cite news|title=KIA says 211 army soldiers die in two-month fighting in Hpakant|url=http://www.kachinnews.com/news/2418-kia-says-211-army-soldiers-die-in-two-month-fighting-in-hpakant.html|accessdate=12 March 2018|work=www.kachinnews.com|date=10 October 2012|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013–2014 ===
Fortified KIA positions were heavily damaged by airstrikes and artillery launched by the Myanmar Army from December 2012 to January 2013.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

On 19 November 2014, government soldiers attacked the KIA's headquarters near [[Laiza]], killing at least 22 insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/myanmars-kachin-rebels-22-dead-attack-27023038|title=Myanmar's Kachin Rebels Say 22 Dead in Fighting|date=19 November 2014|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2018 ===
In March 2018, the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Armed Forces) launched [[airstrike]]s against the KIA in [[Tanai Township]], which is part of a large mining region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mark|first1=Eugene|title=The 'Resource War' in Kachin State|url=https://thediplomat.com/2018/03/the-resource-war-in-kachin-state/|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=The Diplomat|date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1 to 6 April 2018, Tatmadaw soldiers allegedly attacked KIA positions in the KIA-controlled [[Mansi Township]], though no reports of fighting emerged from the region. The KIA later raided the Tatmadaw's Battalion 86 military base in [[Hpakant Township]] on 6 April 2018, killing eight government soldiers and capturing 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Weng|first1=Lawi|title=KIA Raids Tatmadaw Base, Claims to Detain More than a Dozen Troops|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/kia-raids-tatmadaw-base-claims-detain-dozen-troops.html|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=The Irrawaddy|date=9 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 10 April 2018, locals claimed that 18 Tatmadaw soldiers and three KIA insurgents had been killed in the clashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thar|first1=Chan|title=UN appeals to fighters to spare civilians|url=https://www.mmtimes.com/news/un-appeals-fighters-spare-civilians.html|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=The Myanmar Times|date=10 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accusations of abuses perpetrated by the Tatmadaw against civilians emerged in March and April 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hay|first1=Wayne|title='I feel helpless': Abuses plague Myanmar's Kachin conflict|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2018/03/i-feel-helpless-abuses-plague-myanmars-kachin-conflict-180327090110375.html|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=www.aljazeera.com|date=27 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which included allegations that Tatmadaw soldiers specifically targeted and killed two [[Kachin people|Kachin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lwin|first1=Nan|last2=Pwint|first2=Hnin|title=Army Brings Case Against Relative of 2 Kachin Villagers Allegedly Killed by Soldiers|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/army-brings-case-relative-2-kachin-villagers-allegedly-killed-soldiers.html|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=The Irrawaddy|date=29 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and six [[Shan people#Other Tai Shan groups|Shanni]] farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Six Shan Ni farmers missing after clashes in Kachin State|url=http://www.mizzima.com/news-domestic/six-shan-ni-farmers-missing-after-clashes-kachin-state|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=Mizzima|date=13 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several civilians were also wounded in the crossfire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar villagers caught in crossfire as Kachin conflict flares|url=http://www.unhcr.org/news/latest/2018/4/5acb37464/myanmar-villagers-caught-crossfire-kachin-conflict-flares.html|accessdate=15 April 2018|work=UNHCR|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By May 2018, 6,000 [[Internally displaced person|IDPs]] had fled armed clashes and shelling by the Myanmar Army, whilst hundreds more remained trapped in villages caught between the crossfire. Hunger became a prevalent issue for IDPs, with some resorting to eating [[banana]] stems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Simon|last2=Moon|first2=Sam Aung|title=Myanmar's northern offensive against rebels sparks youthful revolt|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-myanmar-kachin/myanmars-northern-offensive-against-rebels-sparks-youthful-revolt-idUSKBN1IC1LV|accessdate=11 May 2018|work=Reuters|date=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ceasefire attempts ===
Numerous rounds of ceasefire talks have taken place between the [[Kachin Independence Army]] and the government of Myanmar since fighting resumed in June 2011. According to a 18 December 2012 report by Swedish journalist [[Bertil Lintner]] in the [[Hong Kong]]-based ''[[Asia Times Online]]'', many people have criticised the foreign backed ceasefire efforts for "avoiding discussions of political issues and only emphasizing ceasefires, disarmament and economic development, those interlocutors—including a 'Peace Support Initiative' sponsored by the [[Norwegian government]] and in a separate initiative the [[Switzerland]]-based [[Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue]]—are essentially promoting the government's view".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; ''The Australian'' reported that some Kachin Business leaders were calling on [[Aung San Suu Kyi]] to help mediate the dispute&lt;ref name="theaustralian.com.au" /&gt; and on 6 January 2012, Aung San Suu Kyi said that she could not step into the negotiations without an official invitation from the government to do so, which she had not received.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mizzima.com/special/kachin-battle-report/8695-suu-kyi-refuses-to-intervene-in-kachin-conflict.html]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2013 ceasefire talks ====
On 18 January 2013, immediately prior to an international donors conference in Myanmar, President [[Thein Sein]] announced a unilateral ceasefire in the war between the army and the KIO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/burma/kachin-01192013175226.html |title=Kachin Ceasefire Ignored |publisher=Rfa.org |date= |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceasefire was said to take effect the following day, on 19 January, but light fighting was also reported the following day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/world/asia/cease-fire-in-myanmar-with-kachin-rebels-fails-to-take-hold.html?_r=0|title=A Cease-Fire With Rebels in Myanmar Doesn’t Hold|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 February 2015|first=Thomas|last=Fuller|date=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a full-scale government assault was reportedly launched on 20 January and included "sustained mortar and artillery fire" followed by "hundreds of Burmese troops" storming a KIA base on the outskirts of rebel-held town of [[Laiza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21107440 |title=BBC News - Burma attack breaks Kachin truce near China border |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=20 January 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of [[Thein Sein]] was reported to be under pressure from "political and business circles" who believed the "escalating conflict would undermine Myanmar’s emergence from decades of diplomatic isolation" and had passed a resolution in parliament calling on [[Min Aung Hlaing]], the military’s commander-in-chief, to scale down the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Robinson |first=Gwen |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121183737/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/458cdcba-618d-11e2-82cd-00144feab49a.html |title=Myanmar’s military to end Kachin attacks - FT.com |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2013-01-18 |accessdate=2018-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Min Aung Hlaing responded by stating that the military would only carry out attacks only in "self-defense"—the rationale it has consistently given since December 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2012/01/13/Hope-and-suspicion-dog-Myanmar-cease-fire/UPI-22521326469272/#ixzz2IZEDRwWR |title=Hope and suspicion dog Myanmar cease-fire |publisher=UPI.com |date=13 January 2012 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; for prosecuting a war against the KIA and the rationale it gave for allowing [[airstrike]]s on rebel positions starting on 26 December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/govt-says-kachin-air-strikes-self-defence/25551 |title=Govt says Kachin air strikes 'self-defence' - DVB Multimedia Group |publisher=Dvb.no |date=4 January 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 February, Burmese government and the Kachin Independence Army met in [[Ruili]], [[China]] and agreed to reduce military tension in Kachin State and hold further peace talks later in February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/4014-myanmar-govt-kio-agree-to-reduce-tension-hold-more-talks.html |title=Myanmar govt, KIO agree to reduce ‘tension’, hold more talks |publisher=Mmtimes.com |date= |accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However no talks took place later in February but almost no armed clash reportedly happened in Kachin State after the peace talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar military denies scaling up operations in conflict areas|url=http://elevenmyanmar.com/politics/2764-myanmar-military-denies-scaling-up-operations-in-conflict-areas|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=Eleven|date=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Mizzima news, on 26 February a KIO central committee member claimed that they would not be meeting with the government in February because they needed more time to consult with the "Kachin people" regarding the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mizzima.com/special/kachin-battle-report/8966-kio-postpones-talks-with-govt-peace-committee.html |accessdate=6 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130226120711/http://mizzima.com/special/kachin-battle-report/8966-kio-postpones-talks-with-govt-peace-committee.html |archivedate=26 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Burmese government and KIA renewed peace talks in Ruili, China on 11 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar government and Kachin rebels renew talks|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/afp_asiapacific/view/1259176/1/.html|accessdate=13 March 2013|newspaper=Channel News Asia|date=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese government’s refusal to allow observers from western countries at peace talks had delayed negotiations,  despite the Chinese rejecting the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Toe Lwin|first=Ei Ei|title=Questions over China’s role after delay in talks|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/in-depth/6463-questions-over-china-s-role-after-delay-in-talks.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=The Myanmar Times|date=22 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McLaughlin|first=Tim McLaughlin|title=Blame game over Kachin peace talk delays|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/6520-kachin-peace-talks-face-delays.html|accessdate=26 April 2013|newspaper=The Myanmar Times|date=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May, Burmese government and Kachin Independence Army signed a preliminary ceasefire agreement that would lead to further progress towards reaching a peace deal. The parties however, failed to reach an official ceasefire agreement. [[United Nations]] special adviser on Myanmar, [[Vijay Nambiar]], also joined the meeting as an observer, along with representatives of [[China]] and other ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Preliminary ceasefire reached through Kachin talks|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/6928-preliminary-ceasefire-reached-through-kachin-talks.html|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=The Myanmar Times|date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nyein Nyein|title=KIO, Govt Sign Preliminary Agreement, Hopeful of Reaching Ceasefire|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/36003|accessdate=30 May 2013|newspaper=The irrawaddt|date=30 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Burmese government and Kachin Independence Army failed to reach a permanent ceasefire agreement after several peace talks in 2013, but agreed to work together towards permanent ceasefire agreement and reduce hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/myanmar/kachin-10102013192125.html |title=Kachin Peace Talks Close Without Cease-Fire Pact |publisher=Rfa.org |date= |accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mmpeacemonitor.org/images/images/20131008-10_mpc_released_a_statement_for_kio_and_govt_talks.jpg |format=JPG |title=Myanmar Peace Center : Media Release |publisher=Mmpeacemonitor.org |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2014 ceasefire talks ====
Renewed fighting broke out in April 2014 when the Burmese army attacked various KIA positions around [[Mansi Township]], [[Kachin State]] and northern [[Shan State]] to eradicate timber smuggling and to control strategic routes around their strongholds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elevenmyanmar.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5811:kachin-conflict-damaging-trust-in-peace-talks&amp;catid=32:politics&amp;Itemid=354 |title=Kachin conflict damaging trust in peace talks |publisher=Eleven Myanmar |date=23 April 2014 |accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kachin Independence Army requested a meeting in [[Myitkyina]] on 10 May to lessen tensions between the sides.&lt;ref name="irrawaddy1"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/kachin-rebels-requests-ceasefire-meeting-recent-clashes.html |title=Kachin Rebels Requests Ceasefire Meeting After Recent Clashes |publisher=Irrawaddy.org |date= |accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Negotiations aimed at drafting a nationwide ceasefire agreement began in April 2014 at the [[Myanmar Peace Centre]] between representatives of various ethnic armed groups and the Burmese government, but the KIA and Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) were not among the negotiators.&lt;ref name="irrawaddy1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvb.no/news/rangoon-ceasefire-talks-a-historic-situation-says-gun-maw-burma-myanmar/39373 |title=Rangoon ceasefire talks a ‘historic situation’, says Gun Maw &amp;#124; DVB Multimedia Group |publisher=Dvb.no |date=6 April 2014 |accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KIA's deputy commander-in-chief [[Gun Maw]] urged the [[United States]] to get involved in the peace process in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pennington |first=Matthew |url=http://www.newsobserver.com/2014/04/22/3801662/myanmar-rebel-leader-urges-us.html |title=WASHINGTON: Myanmar rebel leader urges US role in peace talks &amp;#124; National Politics |publisher=NewsObserver.com |date=22 April 2014 |accessdate=29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Airstrikes ===
On 2 January 2013, the Burmese government confirmed that it carried out [[airstrike]]s a few days earlier against the ethnic rebels in northern Kachin, in response to attacks by the Kachin Independence Army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Burma Admits Air Strikes Targeted Kachin Rebels|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/burma-admits-air-strikes-targeted-kachin-rebels/1576299.html|accessdate=3 January 2013|newspaper=Voice of America|date=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US government stated that it would "be formally expressing our concern" over the escalation of force used by Myanmar government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/dpb/2013/01/202436.htm#BURMA |title=Daily Press Briefing - January 2, 2013 |publisher=State.gov |date=2 January 2013 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 January 2013, the KIA alleged that air-strikes had continued to occur for the sixth consecutive day in the area around [[Laiza]] and there were allegations that the [[Myanmar Armed Forces]] was also using [[chemical weapons]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/22883 |accessdate=4 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140410072040/http://www.irrawaddy.org/archives/22883 |archivedate=10 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[UN Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki Moon]] stated following the incidents that Burma's authorities should "desist from any action that could endanger the lives of civilians living in the area or further intensify conflict in the region".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lindsay Murdoch |url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/burmese-military-admits-air-strike-on-rebels-20130103-2c77a.html |title=Burmese military admits air strike on rebels |publisher=Theage.com.au |date= |accessdate=19 February 2015 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civilians and refugees ===
Civilians have also been killed in fighting as well as having been specifically targeted.&lt;ref name="oxmofm1"/&gt; Civilians were often displaced by fighting and faced dangers such as landmines which were frequently laid by government and rebel forces without regard for civilians. Although some civilians had crossed the border with China most remained in northern Burma as of December 2012.

Refugees were being forced by the Chinese government back into [[Myanmar]] in August 2012 despite the continued fighting there and the illegality of forcibly returning civilians to war zones under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19365075 |title=BBC News - China 'forcing Kachin refugees back to Burma' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=24 August 2012 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2012/08/24/china-refugees-forcibly-returned-burma |title=China: Refugees Forcibly Returned to Burma &amp;#124; Human Rights Watch |publisher=Hrw.org |date=24 August 2012 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women have played a significant role in the conflict as both combatants and victims. ''[[Time Magazine]]'' documented the presence of many female KIA soldiers in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lightbox.time.com/2012/04/19/kia/#ixzz2FgswYz5J |title=On the Front Lines with the Kachin Independence Army - LightBox |publisher=Lightbox.time.com |date= 19 April 2012|accessdate=19 February 2015 |first=Joe |last=Jackson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2013 the NGO Kachin Women's Association Thailand (KWAT) reported that the fighting had created over 100,000 refugees and that 364 villages had been wholly or partially abandoned since 2011.&lt;ref name="kachinwomen1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kachinwomen.com/publications/reports/105-state-terror-in-the-kachin-hills-.html |title=Kachin Women's Association Thailand - State terror in the Kachin hills |publisher=Kachinwomen.com |date= |accessdate=19 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411051706/http://www.kachinwomen.com/publications/reports/105-state-terror-in-the-kachin-hills-.html |archivedate=11 April 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation's report also stated that the Burmese Army deliberately attacked refugee camps and villages as well as committed alleged "war crimes" such as the rape and murder of civilians.&lt;ref name="kachinwomen1"/&gt;

The [[United Nations]] stated on 28 April 2018 that more than 4,000 people were displaced since armed clashes resumed earlier in the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-43933332|title=Myanmar violence: Thousands flee fresh fighting in Kachin state|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child soldiers ===
Child soldiers are a major part of the Myanmar Army's and insurgent groups' soldiers. ''The Independent'' reported in June 2012 that children were being sold to the Burmese military for "as little as $40 and a bag of rice or a can of petrol".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jerome Taylor |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/two-burmese-children-a-week-conscripted-into-military-7858858.html |title=Two Burmese children a week conscripted into military - Asia - World |publisher=The Independent |date=19 June 2012 |accessdate=19 February 2015 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN's Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, [[Radhika Coomaraswamy]], who stepped down from her position a week later, met representatives of the [[Government of Myanmar]] on 5 July 2012, and stated that she hoped the government's signing of an action plan would "signal a transformation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/briefings/docs/2012/120705_Guest.doc.htm |title=Press Conference on Action Plan to End Recruitment of Child Soldiers in Myanmar &amp;#124; Meetings Coverage and Press Releases |publisher=Un.org |date=5 July 2012 |accessdate=19 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflict at the beginning was mostly between the government of the [[House of Representatives (Libya)|House of Representatives]] (HoR) that was controversially [[Libyan House of Representatives election, 2014|elected]] in 2014, also known as the "[[Tobruk]] government"; and the rival [[General National Congress (2014)|General National Congress]] (GNC) endorsed government, also called the "[[National Salvation Government]]", based in the capital [[Tripoli]], established after [[Operation Odyssey Dawn]] and [[2014 Libyan coup d'état attempts|the failed military coup]].

The HoR, also known as the Council of Deputies, the strongest in eastern Libya, has the loyalty of the [[Libyan National Army]], under the command of General [[Khalifa Haftar]], and has been supported by airstrikes by [[Egypt]] and the [[United Arab Emirates|UAE]].&lt;ref name="guardianbriefing"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stephen|first1=Chris|title=War in Libya - the Guardian briefing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/29/-sp-briefing-war-in-libya|accessdate=19 February 2015|agency=The Guardian|date=29 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GNC, based in western Libya and backed by various different militias mainly Libya Dawn coalition in west Libya and [[Libya Shield]] in the east with some support from [[Qatar]], [[Sudan]] and [[Turkey]],&lt;ref name=guardianbriefing/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://carnegieendowment.org/2014/10/06/libya-s-legitimacy-crisis/hr9j |title=Libya's Legitimacy Crisis | publisher =Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|date=20 August 2014|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21638123-four-year-descent-arab-spring-factional-chaos-it-should-come|title=That it should come to this | publisher =The Economist|date=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/2/8/123755/World/Region/Bashir-says-Sudan-to-work-with-UAE-to-control-figh.aspx|agency=Ahram Online|title=Bashir says Sudan to work with UAE to control fighting in Libya|date=23 February 2015|accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially accepted the results of the 2014 election, but rejected them after the Supreme Constitutional Court nullified an amendment regarding the roadmap for Libya's transition and HoR elections.&lt;sup&gt;[[House of Representatives (Libya)#cite note-:0-13|[13]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Due to controversy about constitutional amendments, the HoR refused to take office from GNC in Tripoli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libya-analysis.com/libyan-elections/|title=Libyan Unity Government Extends Control Over Tripoli Ministries|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was controlled by powerful militias from the western coastal city of Misrata. Instead, the HoR established its parliament in Tobruk, which is controlled by General Haftar's forces.

In December 2015, after long talks in [[Skhirat]], the [[Libyan Political Agreement]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=52845#.VyJoBKMrLKI|title=UN welcomes 'historic' signing of Libyan Political Agreement|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was signed. The LPA was the result of protracted negotiations between rival political camps based in the capital, Tripoli, Tobruk and elsewhere which agreed to unite as the [[Government of National Accord]]. On 30 March 2016 [[Fayez al-Sarraj|Fayez Sarraj]], the head of the GNA, was able to arrive to Tripoli and started working from there despite opposition from GNC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/30/chief-libyas-un-backed-government-fayez-sarraj-arrives-tripoli|title=Chief of Libya's new UN-backed government arrives in Tripoli|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Government of National Accord is currently the only internationally-recognized government in the country, its authority is still not recognized by the HoR, as specific details acceptable to both sides have not yet been agreed upon, especially regarding the future of Haftar.

In addition to those three factions, there are also smaller rival groups: the Islamist [[Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries]], led by [[Ansar al-Sharia (Libya)]], which has had the support of the GNC and was [[Battle of Benghazi (2014-2017)|defeated]] in [[Benghazi]] in 2017;&lt;ref name="Benghazi"&gt;{{cite news|date=1 August 2014|work= The IB Times | title =Ansar Al-Sharia Claims Control Of Benghazi, Declares Islamic Emirate In Libya|url= http://www.ibtimes.com/ansar-al-sharia-claims-control-benghazi-declares-islamic-emirate-libya-1645328}}&lt;br/&gt;{{Citation | newspaper = The Star | date = 31 October 2014 | url = http://www.thestar.com.my/News/World/2014/10/31/Libyan-army-says-recaptures-four-barracks-in-Benghazi/ | title = Libyan army says recaptures four barracks in Benghazi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stronghold&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-12/29/c_136858201.htm|title=Libyan army takes over remaining militant stronghold in Benghazi|work=Xinhua News Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/11/18/omar-al-hassi-in-beautiful-ansar-row-while-100-gnc-members-meet/#axzz3cnd2kDDR| title= Omar Al-Hassi in "beautiful" Ansar row while "100" GNC members meet| publisher= Libya Herald| date= 18 November 2014| accessdate= 14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant in Libya|Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant's (ISIL's) Libyan provinces]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/03/06/libya-civil-war-tobruk-un-negotiations-morocco/  |title=Why Picking Sides in Libya won't work| publisher =Foreign Policy|date=6 March 2015}} "One is the internationally recognized government based in the eastern city of Tobruk and its military wing, Operation Dignity, led by General Khalifa Haftar.

==Background of discontent with General National Congress==

At the beginning of 2014, Libya was governed by the [[General National Congress]] (GNC), which won the popular vote in [[Libyan General National Congress election, 2012|2012 elections]]. The GNC was made of two major political groupings, the National Forces Alliance (NFC) and the [[Justice and Construction Party]] (JCP). The two major groups in parliament had failed to reach political compromises on the larger more important issues that the GNC faced.

Division among these parties, the row over the political isolation law, and a continuous unstable security situation greatly impacted the GNC's ability to deliver real progress towards a new constitution for Libya which was a primary task for this body.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Libya After Qaddafi: Lessons and Implications for the Future|last=Chivvis|first=Christopher S.|publisher=RAND Corporation|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GNC also included members associated with conservative Islamist Groups as well as revolutionary groups (thuwwar). Some members of the GNC had a conflict of interest due to associations with militias and were accused of channeling government funds towards some [[Libyan Crisis (2011–present)|armed groups]] and allowing others to conduct assassinations and kidnappings. Parties holding majority of seats and some holding minority of seats began to use boycotts or threats of boycotts which increased division and suppressed relevant debates by removing them from the congressional agenda;&lt;ref name="John, Ronald Bruce 2014 p. 201"&gt;{{Citation | last = St John | first = Ronald Bruce | date = 4 June 2014 | title = Historical Dictionary of Libya | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield | page = 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; voting to declare [[sharia law]] and establishing a special committee to "review all existing laws to guarantee they comply with Islamic law";&lt;ref name="reuters.com"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/04/us-libya-law-idUSBRE9B30M220131204 |title= Libyan assembly votes to follow Islamic law | publisher=Reuters|date=4 December 2013|accessdate= 26 August 2014 | last1 =Bosalum | first1 = Feras | last2 = Markey | first2 = Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt; imposing [[Gender segregation and Islam|gender segregation]] and compulsory [[hijab]] at Libyan universities; and refusing to hold new elections when its electoral mandate expired in January 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya congress extends its mandate until end-2014|url=http://www.mei.edu/content/libya-congress-extends-its-mandate-until-end-2014|work=AFP|date=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; until General Khalifa Haftar launched a large-scale military offensive against the Islamists in May 2014, code-named '''Operation Dignity''' ({{lang-ar |عملية الكرامة}}; 'Amaliya al-Karamah).&lt;ref name="Magharebia Shahat" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-27492354 | title = Profile: Libyan ex-General Khalifa Haftar | date = 16 October 2014 | first = Mohamed | last = Madi| publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political Fragmentation of the GNC ===
The 2012 elections, overseen by the Libyan electoral commission with the support of the UN Special Mission In Libya (UNSMIL) and nongovernmental organizations like the International Foundation for Electoral Systems (IFES), have been considered "fair and free" by most Libyans. However, the elections did not necessarily create a strong government because the Parliament was fragmented due to the lack of organized political parties in Libya post-revolution. The GNC was made up two major parties, the [[National Forces Alliance]] and the Justice and Construction Party, as well as independents in which some where moderates and others conservative Islamists. The GNC became a broad-based congress.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The GNA elected [[Nouri Abusahmain]] as president of the GNC in June 2013.&lt;ref name="transitions.foreignpolicy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transitions.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2013/06/26/can_the_new_libyan_president_live_up_to_expectations|title=Can the New Libyan President Live Up to Expectations?|date=26 June 2013|publisher=Foreign Policy|accessdate=26 August 2014|author=Eljarh, Mohamed}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="america.aljazeera.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://america.aljazeera.com/articles/2014/8/4/libya-parliamentmeets.html|title=Libya's new parliament meets amid rumbling violence|date=4 August 2014|publisher=Aljazeera America|accessdate=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was considered an independent Islamist and a compromise candidate acceptable to liberal members of the congress, as he was elected with 96 out of a total of 184 votes by the GNC.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=ISIS enters the Stage in the Libyan Drama – How the IS Caliphate expands in Northern Africa|last=Kotra|first=Johnathan|publisher=International Institute for Counter-Terrorism (ICT)|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GNC establishes the Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room (LROR) ===
{{main|Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room}}
The GNC was challenged due to increasing security concerns in Tripoli. The GNC itself was attacked many times from militias and armed protesters who stormed the GNC assembly hall.&lt;ref name="www.dw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/two-lawmakers-shot-in-libya-as-protesters-storm-parliament/a-17468646|title=Two lawmakers shot in Libya as protesters storm parliament {{!}} News {{!}} DW.COM {{!}} 03.03.2014|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his appointment, Abusahmain was tasked with providing security. He set up the [[Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room]] (LROR), which was initially intended to protect and secure Tripoli in August 2013. But this armed group was responsible for kidnapping Prime Minister Zeidan in October of that year resulting in the GNC dismissing it from its security function and Abusahmain himself as president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trackingterrorism.org/group/libya-revolutionaries-joint-operations-room-lror|title=Libya Revolutionaries Joint Operations Room (LROR) {{!}} Terrorist Groups {{!}} TRAC|website=www.trackingterrorism.org|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his term, Abusahmain blocked inquiries into the distribution of state funds and it was alleged that Abusahmain was channeling government funding towards the LROR.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The LROR was not an Islamist armed group but rather was made of rebels from the city of Gharyan. Its commander was Adel Gharyani.

In October 2013, following the kidnapping of the Prime Minister, Abusahmain used his presidency to change the agenda of the GNC in order to prevent a debate over disestablishing the LROR. At the same time, he cancelled a request to establish a committee to investigate the allocation, by Abusahmain himself, of 900 million Libyan Dinars (US $720 million) to the LROR and various other armed groups.&lt;ref name="John, Ronald Bruce 2014 p. 201" /&gt; Instead, the LROR had its responsibilities reduced by the GNC but was allowed to continue to operate, and no one was prosecuted for the incident.

=== [[Kidnapping]] of Prime Minister Zeidan ===
The kidnapping of Zeidan was believed to be a coup attempt supported by members of the GNC, who was viewed as too moderate (see: [[2013 Libyan coup d'état attempt]]).[[]]

Most journalists reported that it was the [[Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room]] (LROR) (Ghurfat Amaliyat al-Thuwar) created by Abusahmain by decree 143 of 7 July. Yet there is evidence to suggest that this is not the case and that armed groups such as the Duru3 actually conducted the kidnapping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libya-analysis.com/libyan-elections/|title=Libyan Elections {{!}} Libya Analysis|website=www.libya-analysis.com|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Expansion of armed groups during the GNC's term ===
Many Libyans blamed the GNC and the interim government for a continued lack of security in the country. The interim government struggled to control well-armed militias and armed groups that established during the revolution. Libyans in Benghazi especially began to witness [[assassinations]] and kidnapping and perceived the GNC to be turning a blind eye to the deteriorating security situation in the east.

But security concerns increased across the country allowing armed groups to expand in both Tripoli and in the east.

* The kidnapping of Egyptian diplomats in January 2014 also by the LROR took place.
* In March 2014, armed protesters allegedly linked to the LROR stormed the GNC parliament building, shooting and injuring two lawmakers and wounding several others.&lt;ref name="www.dw.com"/&gt;

=== GNC's political isolation law ===
Although Islamists were outnumbered by [[Liberalism|Liberals]] and [[Centrism|Centrist]]s in the GNC, in May 2013 they lobbied for a law "banning virtually everyone who had participated in Gaddafi's government from holding public office". While several Islamist political parties and independents supported the law, as they generally had no associations to the Qaddafi regime, the law enjoyed strong public support. Polls demonstrates that a large majority of the Libyan people supported the exclusion of high-ranking Qaddafi-regime officials.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The law particularly impacts elite expatriates and leaders of liberal parties. There existed reservations that such a law would eliminate technocratic expertise needed in Libya at the time.

Armed militiamen stormed government ministries, shut down the GNC itself and demanded the law's passage. This intimidated the GNC into passing the law in which 164 members approved the bill, with only four abstaining and no member opposing it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Suppression of women's rights===
GNC opponents argue that it was supporting Islamist actions against women. [[Sadiq Ghariani]], the [[Grand Mufti]] of Libya, is perceived to be linked closely to Islamist parties. He has issued fatwas ordering Muslims to obey the GNC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/02/07/grand-mufti-supports-congress-remaining-in-office-forbids-action-against-it/#axzz3BEEmEefL|title=Grand Mufti supports Congress remaining in office, forbids action against it.|work=Libya Herald|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fatwas ordering Muslims to fight against [[Haftar]]'s forces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magharebia.com/en_GB/articles/awi/features/2014/06/12/feature-01|title=Mufti call for violence angers Libyans|work=Magharebia|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, [[Sadiq Ghariani]], the [[Grand Mufti]], issued a fatwa against the ''UN Report on Violence Against Women and Girls''. He condemned the UN report for "advocating immorality and indecency in addition to rebelliousness against religion and clear objections to the laws contained in the Quran and Sunnah".&lt;ref name="Jones"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/libyas-grand-mufti-issues-fatwa-against-un-report-womens-rights|title=Libya's Grand Mufti Issues Fatwa Against U.N.

Later in 2013, lawyer Hamida Al-Hadi Al-Asfar, advocate of women's rights, was abducted, tortured and killed. It is alleged she was targeted for criticising the Grand Mufti's declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vivalibya.wordpress.com/2014/01/07/lawyer-who-supported-the-rights-of-women-found-dead/|title=Lawyer Who Supported the Rights of Women in Libya, Found Dead &amp;#124; Viva Libya !|publisher=Vivalibya.wordpress.com|date=7 January 2014|accessdate=16 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No arrests were made.

In June 2013, two politicians, Ali Tekbali and Fathi Sager, appeared in court for "insulting Islam" for publishing a cartoon promoting women's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/libya-must-drop-charges-against-politicians-over-women-s-rights-cartoon-2013-06-14 |title=Libya must drop charges against politicians over women's rights cartoon &amp;#124; Amnesty International |publisher=Amnesty.org |date= |accessdate=16 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140326023115/http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/libya-must-drop-charges-against-politicians-over-women-s-rights-cartoon-2013-06-14 |archivedate=26 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under sharia law they were facing a possible death penalty. The case caused widespread concern although they were eventually acquitted in March 2014. After the GNC was forced to accept new elections, Ali Tekbali was elected to the new House of Representatives.
[[File:Libyans protest GNC extension (II).jpg|thumb|Protesters stage a large demonstration in Shahat against the GNC's mandate extension plan.&lt;ref name="Magharebia Shahat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magharebia.com/en_GB/articles/awi/features/2014/02/04/feature-01|title=Shahat slams GNC|publisher=Magharebia|date=4 February 2014|accessdate=20 August 2014|author=Al-Gattani, Ali}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

During [[Nouri Abusahmain]]'s presidency of the GNC and subsequent to GNC's decision to enforce sharia law in December 2013, gender segregation and compulsory hijab were being imposed in Libyan universities from early 2014, provoking strong criticism from Women's Rights groups.

===GNC extends its mandate without elections===
The GNC failed to stand down at the end of its electoral mandate in January 2014, unilaterally voting on 23 December 2013 to extend its power for at least one year. This caused widespread unease and some protests. Residents of the eastern city of Shahat, along with protesters from Bayda and Sousse, staged a large demonstration, rejecting the GNC's extension plan and demanding the resignation of the congress followed by a peaceful power transition to a legitimate body. They also protested the lack of security, blaming the GNC for failing to build the army and police.&lt;ref name="Magharebia Shahat"/&gt; Other Libyans rejecting the proposed mandate rallied in Tripoli's Martyrs Square and outside Benghazi's Tibesti Hotel, calling for the freeze of political parties and the re-activation of the country's security system.&lt;ref name=magharebia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magharebia.com/en_GB/articles/awi/features/2014/02/10/feature-02|title=Libyans reject GNC extension|publisher=Magharebia|date=10 February 2014|accessdate=20 August 2014|author1=Mohamed, Essam |author2=Al-Majbari, Fathia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 February 2014, General [[Khalifa Haftar]] ordered the GNC to dissolve and called for the formation of a [[caretaker government]] committee to oversee new elections. However, his actions had little effect on the GNC, which called his actions "an attempted coup" and called Haftar himself "ridiculous" and labelled him an aspiring dictator. The GNC continued to operate as before. No arrests were made. Haftar launched Operation Dignity two months later, on 16 May.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

===House of Representatives versus GNC===
On 25 May 2014, about one week after Khalifa Haftar started his '''Operation Dignity''' offensive against the General National Congress, that body set 25 June 2014 as the date for [[Libyan House of Representatives election, 2014|new elections]].&lt;ref name=eognc-35&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ignc.net.ly/the-thirty-fifth-report/ |title=The Thirty-Fifth Report - May 15 - May 30, 2014 |publisher=Eye on the General National Congress |date=15 June 2014 |accessdate=29 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903100813/http://www.ignc.net.ly/the-thirty-fifth-report/ |archivedate=3 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamists were defeated, but rejected the results of the election, which saw only an 18% turnout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/06/libyans-mourn-rights-activist-amid-turmoil-2014626161436740827.html|title =Libyans mourn rights activist amid turmoil|work= Al-Jazeera | date =26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/08/21/tarhouna-rejects-house-of-representatives-declares-support-for-operation-dawn/ |title= Tarhouna rejects House of Representatives, declares support for Operation Dawn | work =Libya Herald|date=27 September 2014 | accessdate =6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/08/19/jabal-nefusa-towns-boycott-the-house-of-representatives-over-tobruk-meetings/ |title =Jabal Nefusa towns declare boycott of the House of Representatives|work= Libya Herald | date =19 August 2014|accessdate=6 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They accused the new [[House of Representatives (Libya)|House of Representatives]] parliament of being dominated by supporters of Gaddafi, and they continued to support the old GNC after the Council officially replaced it on 4 August 2014.&lt;ref name=guardianbriefing/&gt;&lt;ref name=transfer&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lamloum|first1=Imed|title=Libya power handover agreed as airport battle rages on|url=https://news.yahoo.com/libyas-congress-says-hand-power-parliament-august-4-115948954.html|publisher=Agence France-Presse (AFP)|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya's new parliament meets in Tobruk|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/08/04/libyas-new-parliament-meets-in-tobruk/#axzz39S15dqTQ|accessdate=4 August 2014|publisher=Libya Herald|date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conflict escalated on 13 July 2014, when Tripoli's Islamists and [[Misrata]]n militias launched '''Operation Libya Dawn''' to seize [[Tripoli International Airport]], capturing it from the [[Zintan]] militia on 23 August. Shortly thereafter, members of the GNC, whom had rejected the June election, reconvened as a [[General National Congress (2014)|new General National Congress]] and voted themselves as replacement of the newly elected House of Representatives, with Tripoli as their political capital, [[Nouri Abusahmain]] as president and [[Omar al-Hasi]] as prime minister. As a consequence, the majority of the House of Representatives were forced to relocate to [[Tobruk]], aligning themselves with Haftar's forces and eventually nominating him army chief.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya names anti-Islamist General Haftar as army chief|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-31698755|work=BBC News|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 November, the supreme court in Tripoli, dominated by the new GNC, declared the House of Representatives dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/libya-court-rules-june-elections-unconstitutional-26725959 | title = Libya Court Rules June Elections Unconstitutional| work= ABC News |date= 6 November 2014|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/libya-chaos-deepens-as/1457890.html |title=Libya chaos deepens as court nullifies parliament |work=Channel News Asia |date=6 November 2014 |accessdate=6 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106201804/http://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/libya-chaos-deepens-as/1457890.html |archivedate=6 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-29933121 |title= Libya supreme court 'invalidates' elected parliament| publisher = BBC| date = 6 November 2014 | accessdate =6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Representatives rejected this ruling as made "under threat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.middleeasteye.net/news/libya-parliament-rejects-court-ruling-experts-call-international-action-end-crisis-1302883080 |title = Libya parliament rejects court ruling, calls grow for international action | work =Middle East Eye|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposing forces==
===Pro-GNC===
The pro-GNC forces were a coalition of different militias with different ideologies although most of them are Islamist influenced especially in eastern Libya in [[Benghazi]] and [[Derna, Libya|Derna]]. Since LPA negotiations started in Skhirat there has been a rift within the militias over support for the UN-sponsored talks and the proposed Government of National Accord, which seeks to unite the rival governments.&lt;ref name=BBCGuide&gt;{{cite journal|title=Guide to key Libyan militias|journal=BBC|date=11 January 2016|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-19744533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since GNA started working from Tripoli in March 2015, Libya Dawn coalition the largest of Pro-GNC militias has been disbanded and most of its forces changed allegiances to GNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://eyeonisisinlibya.com/the-anti-isis-coalition/24-30-june-anti-gna-militias-evicted-from-tripoli/|title= Anti-GNA militias evicted from Tripoli|work=|accessdate=|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya Dawn====
The Islamist "[[Libya Dawn]]" has been described as "an uneasy coalition" identified as "terrorists" by the elected parliament in [[Tobruk]]&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt; including "former [[al-Qaeda]] jihadists" who fought against Qaddafi in the nineties, members of Libya's branch of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], and a "network of conservative merchants" from [[Misrata]], whose fighters make up "the largest block of Libya Dawn's forces".&lt;ref name=Anderson180215&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson|first1=Jon Lee|title=Letter from Libya.

The [[Zawiya, Libya|Zawia]] tribe has been allied to Libya Dawn since August 2014,&lt;ref name="libyaninsider.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaninsider.com/violent-clashes-zawia/|title=Violent Clashes in Zawia|work=The Libyan Insider|accessdate=6 April 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129044159/http://www.libyaninsider.com/violent-clashes-zawia/|archivedate=29 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; although in June 2014 at least one Zawia army unit had appeared to side with General Haftar, and reports in December claimed Zawia forces were openly considering breaking away from Libya Dawn.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2014/12/07/more-air-raids-as-national-army-claims-west-advances-while-zawia-reviews-dawn-commitment/#axzz3NbYucI2B|title=More air raids as national army claims west advances while Zawia “reviews Dawn commitment” -|website=www.libyaherald.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zawia militia have been heavily fighting the Warshefana tribe. In the current conflict, the Warshefana have been strongly identified with the forces fighting against both Libya Dawn and Al Qaeda. Zawia has been involved in a long-standing tribal conflict with the neighbouring Warshefana tribe since 2011.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15726099|title=BBC News - Libyan factions in deadly clashes near Zawiya|work=BBC News|accessdate=29 January 2015|date=14 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motivations of the Zawia brigades participation in the war have been described as unrelated to religion and instead deriving foremost from tribal conflict with the Warshafana and secondarily as a result of opposition to the Zintani brigades and General Haftar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20141112224132 |title=Libya's future lies on 'T Zone' |publisher=Saudi Gazette |date=11 November 2014 |accessdate=8 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150401110751/http://www.saudigazette.com.sa/index.cfm?method=home.regcon&amp;contentid=20141112224132 |archivedate=1 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the head of GNA [[Fayez al-Sarraj|Fayez Sarraj]] arrived in Tripoli, Libya Dawn has been disbanded as the interests of the militias forming it conflicted when some of them choose to support GNA others chose to stay loyal to GNC.

====Libya Shield====
The [[Libya Shield Force]] supports the Islamists. Its forces are divided, geographically, into the Western Shield, Central Shield and Eastern Shield. Elements of the Libya Shield Force were identified by some observers as linked to [[Al-Qaeda]] as early as 2012.&lt;ref name="inquisitr.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; The term "Libya Shield 1" is used to refer to the Islamist part of the [[Libya Shield Force]] in the east of Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/6398/19/Haftar-escalates.aspx|title=Haftar-escalates - Al-Ahram Weekly|publisher=Weekly.ahram.org.eg|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In western Libya, the prominent Islamist forces are the Central Shield (of the [[Libya Shield Force]]), which consists especially of [[Misrata]] units, and the [[Libya Revolutionaries Operations Room]]. Two smaller organizations operating in western Libya are ''Ignewa Al-Kikly'' and the "Lions of Monotheism".

[[Al-Qaeda]] leader [[Abd al-Muhsin Al-Libi]], also known as Ibrahim Ali Abu Bakr or Ibrahim Tantoush&lt;ref name="un.org"/&gt; has been active in western Libya, capturing the special forces base called Camp 27 in April 2014 and losing it to anti-Islamist forces in August 2014.&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"/&gt; The Islamist forces around Camp 27 have been described as both [[Al-Qaida]]&lt;ref name="thedailybeast.com"/&gt; and as part of the [[Libya Shield Force]].&lt;ref name="libyaherald.com"/&gt; The relationship between [[Al-Qaeda]] and [[Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] is unclear, and their relationship with other Libyan Islamist groups is unclear. [[Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb]] are also active in [[Fezzan]], especially in border areas.

Libya western and central Libya Shield force fought alongside Libya Dawn and were disbanded with it in 2015. While the eastern Libya Shield forces merged later with other Islamist militias and formed Revolutionary Shura Council to fight Hafter LNA.

====Revolutionary Shura Councils====

In [[Benghazi]], the Islamist armed groups have organized themselves into the [[Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries]]. These are:
*[[Ansar al-Sharia (Libya)|Ansar al-Sharia]]
*[[Libya Shield 1]] 
*[[February 17th Martyrs Brigade]]
*[[Rafallah al-Sahati Brigade]]

The Shura Council of Benghazi has been strongly linked with [[ISIS]] as they fought together against Hafter in [[Battle of Benghazi (2014–2017)|Battle of Benghazi]]. Yet, the Shura Council never pledged allegiance to ISIS.&lt;ref name="BBCGuide"/&gt;

Meanwhile, in [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] the main Islamist coalition [[Shura Council of Mujahideen in Derna|Shura Council of Mujahideen]] which was formed in 2014 is an [[al-Qaeda]]-affiliated group. The coalition has been in fight with ISIS in 2015 and drove them out from the city.&lt;ref name="BBCGuide"/&gt;

[[Ajdabiya]] had its own [[Shura Council of Ajdabiya Revolutionaries|Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries]], which is the most ISIS linked among the three Shura councils. Its leader Muhammad al-Zawi and a number of the council pledging allegiance to ISIS played a major role in strengthening the Islamist group grip on [[Sirte]].&lt;ref name="BBCGuide"/&gt;

====Benghazi Defense Brigades====
[[Benghazi Defense Brigades]] was formed in June 2016 to defend Benghazi and the Shura Council from the [[Libyan National Army]], the Benghazi Defence Brigades (BDB) included various [[Libya Dawn]] militias and was organized under the banner of the former [[Grand mufti]] [[Saddiq Al-Ghariyani]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Libyan revolutionary factions form Defend Benghazi Brigades |newspaper=The Libya Observer|date=2 June 2016 |url=http://www.libyaobserver.ly/news/libyan-revolutionary-factions-form-defend-benghazi-brigades |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160603140324/http://www.libyaobserver.ly/news/libyan-revolutionary-factions-form-defend-benghazi-brigades |archivedate=3 June 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OJA"&gt;{{cite web|date=6 June 2016 |title=Other Jihadi Actors |publisher=Eyes on ISIS in Libya |url=http://eyeonisisinlibya.com/other-jihadi-actors/other-6-june-2016/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160608100410/http://eyeonisisinlibya.com/other-jihadi-actors/other-6-june-2016/ |archivedate=8 June 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even thought it pledged to support the GNA &lt;ref name="OJA" /&gt; and apparently working under [[Mahdi Al-Barghathi]], the Defence Minister of the GNA.&lt;ref name="Al-Jufra-attack"&gt;{{Cite news|date=8 December 2016 |title=Haftar's warplanes strike Al-Jufra airbase, kill one, injure 14 GNA Defence Ministry forces |newspaper=Libyan Express |url=http://www.libyanexpress.com/haftars-warplanes-strike-al-jufra-airbase-kill-one-injure-14-gna-defence-ministry-forces/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161208202211/http://www.libyanexpress.com/haftars-warplanes-strike-al-jufra-airbase-kill-one-injure-14-gna-defence-ministry-forces/ |archivedate=8 December 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GNA never recognized the BDB with some members calling for it to be demarcated as a "terrorist organization".&lt;ref name="LibyaAnalysis-1"&gt;{{cite web|date=22 June 2016 |title=Benghazi Defence Brigades is Causing More Fractions Among GNA and Eastern Militias |publisher=LibyaAnalysis |url=http://www.libya-analysis.com/benghazi-defence-brigades-is-causing-more-fractions-among-gna-and-eastern-militias/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624021446/http://www.libya-analysis.com/benghazi-defence-brigades-is-causing-more-fractions-among-gna-and-eastern-militias/ |archivedate=24 June 2016 |deadurl=no |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Amazigh militias====
Even though the [[Berbers|Amazigh]] militias mainly situated in [[Zuwara]] and [[Nafusa Mountains]] fought alongside Libya Dawn, they consider themselves pushed towards that because Zintan brigades and the rest of their enemies has been sided with HoR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/12/libya-berbers-fear-ethnic-conflict-2014123065353199495.html|title=Libya's Berbers fear ethnic conflict|first=Karlos|last=Zurutuza|website=www.aljazeera.com|accessdate=27 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still though, the Amazigh main motivations for fighting against Haftar is his [[Pan-Arab]]ic ideas which is conflicting with their demands of recognition their [[Tamazight|language]] in the constitution as an [[official language]].

While keeping their enmity towards Haftar, the Amazigh militias mostly became neutral later in the war especially since the formation of GNA.

===Operation Dignity===
The anti-Islamist Operation Dignity forces are built around Haftar's faction of the Libyan National Army, including land, sea and air forces along with supporting local militias.

====LNA====
[[File:General Haftar.jpg|thumb|General [[Khalifa Haftar]]]]

The [[Libyan National Army]], formally known as "Libyan Arab Armed Forces", was gradually formed by General [[Khalifa Haftar]] as he fought in what he named [[Operation Dignity]]. On 19 May 2014, a number of Libyan military officers announced their support for Gen. Haftar, including officers in an air force base in [[Tobruk]], and others who have occupied a significant portion of the country's oil infrastructure, as well as members of an important militia group in Benghazi. Haftar then managed to gather allies from [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]], 125 miles east of Benghazi.&lt;ref name="WPost 3"&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=21 May 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/rival-militias-prepare-for-showdown-in-tripoli-after-takeover-of-parliament/2014/05/19/cb36acc2-df6f-11e3-810f-764fe508b82d_story.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6RWgPhDXp?url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/rival-militias-prepare-for-showdown-in-tripoli-after-takeover-of-parliament/2014/05/19/cb36acc2-df6f-11e3-810f-764fe508b82d_story.html|archivedate=2 August 2014|author1=Abigail Hauslohner |author2=Sharif Abdel Kouddous |title=Khalifa Hifter, the ex-general leading a revolt in Libya, spent years in exile in Northern Virginia|date=20 May 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A minority portion of the [[Libya Shield Force]] had been reported to not have joined the Islamist forces, and it is not clear if this means they had joined the LNA forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyaherald.com/2013/06/09/benghazi-libya-shield-protests-at-least-27-dead/#ixzz2neES20PM|title=Benghazi Libya Shield Protests: at least 27 dead|work=Libya Herald|accessdate=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then Haftar continued to strengthen his LNA by recruiting new soldiers along with the advancements he made on the ground. In 2017 Haftar said that his forces are now larger by "hundred times" and now they are about 60 thousand soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alwasat.ly/ar/news/libya/133367/|title=حفتر: تعداد الجيش تضاعف 100 مرة.. و90% من خسائرنا نتيجة الألغام|work=Alwasat|accessdate=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Salafist militias====
[[Salafi movement|Salafists]], called [[Madkhalism|Madkhalis]] by their enemies fought alongside Haftar LNA since the beginning against the Islamist militias especially [[Shura Council of Benghazi Revolutionaries]] and [[ISIS]] whom they considered [[Khawarij]] after a [[fatwa]] from [[Saudi]] [[Rabee al-Madkhali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/64846|title=Quite No More?|work=Carnegie Middle East Center|accessdate=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zintan brigades====
Since the [[Battle of Tripoli Airport]], armed groups associated with [[Zintan]] and the surrounding [[Nafusa]] region have become prominent. The Airport Security Battalion is recruited in large part from [[Zintan]]. The "Zintan Brigades" fall under the leadership of the Zintan Revolutionaries' Military Council.

====Wershefana militias====

===May 2014–January 2015: Operation Dignity v Operation Libya Dawn===
Hostilities first broke out early in the morning of Friday 16 May 2014 when Gen. Haftar's forces assaulted the bases of certain Benghazi Islamist militia groups, including the one blamed for the [[2012 Benghazi attack|2012 assassination of US ambassador Christopher Stevens]]. Haftar has vowed to not stop until the extremists groups are purged.&lt;ref name="CNN election announcement"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/20/world/africa/libya-violence/ |author1=Jomana Karadsheh |author2=Ben Brumfield |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Libya announces elections: Will it help calm the violence? |date=May 20, 2014 |agency=[[CNN]] |accessdate=May 23, 2014 |archivedate=24 May 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524005343/http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/20/world/africa/libya-violence/ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Jomana Karadsheh |author2=Ashley Fantz |lastauthoramp=yes |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/18/world/africa/libya-violence/ |title=Turmoil in Libya: Fighting sweeps across Tripoli following violence in Benghazi |date=May 19, 2014 |accessdate=May 23, 2014 |agency=CNN |archivedate=24 May 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524005350/http://edition.cnn.com/2014/05/18/world/africa/libya-violence/ |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the assault Haftar reportedly asked a close friend, "Am I committing suicide?"&lt;ref name="Haftar's doubts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libyastories.com/2014/05/30/libya-karama-some-notes-on-kahlifa-hafters-operation-dignity/|title=Karama – Some Notes On Khalifa Hafter's Operation Dignity|last=Oakes|first=John|date=May 30, 2014|publisher=Libya Stories|accessdate=May 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation, codenamed "Operation Dignity" by Haftar.

On 17 May, Haftar held a press conference in which he proclaimed that the current GNC was no longer representing the Libyan people and was illegitimate. He explained that his primary aim was to "purge" Islamist militants from Libya, specifically the "terrorist" Muslim Brotherhood.&lt;ref name="Haftar's press release"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aawsat.net/2014/05/article55332486 |title=Khalifa Haftar: My forces will reach Tripoli soon |last=Mahmoud |first=Khalid |date=May 22, 2014 |newspaper=[[Asharq Al-Awsat]] |accessdate=May 31, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712012422/http://www.aawsat.net/2014/05/article55332486 |archivedate=12 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May, Gen. Haftar's militia allies in Tripoli attacked parliament, sending lawmakers fleeing for their lives as gunmen ransacked the legislature, declaring the body suspended. A commander in the military police in Libya read a statement announcing the body's suspension on behalf of a group led by Haftar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=May 22, 2014 |deadurl=no |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/05/18/libyan_lawmakers_run_for_lives_as_gunmen_ransack_legislature.html |title=Libyan lawmakers run for lives as gunmen ransack legislature |date=May 18, 2014 |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |agency=Associated Press |author1=Exam Mohamed |author2=Sarah El Deeb |lastauthoramp=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140522104923/http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2014/05/18/libyan_lawmakers_run_for_lives_as_gunmen_ransack_legislature.html |archivedate=22 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next day evening a group of 5 officers, who identified themselves as the Leaders of the Libyan Army, announced the suspension of the General National Congress.

And thus on 16 March the [[European Union]] agreed to implement sanctions, travel bans, and asset freezes, on Nouri Abusahmain, the president of the Tripoli-based new GNC, Khalifa al-Ghwell, the new GNC's prime minister, and Aguila Saleh, the president of the Tobruk-based House of Representatives&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/europe-agrees-sanctions-libyan-leaders-blocking-unity-government-172552076.html|work=Yahoo!

====Algeria====
Early in May 2014, the Algerian military said it was engaged in an operation aimed at tracking down militants who infiltrated the country's territory in [[Tamanrasset Province|Tamanrasset]] near the Libyan border, during which it announced that it managed to kill 10 "terrorists" and seized a large cache of weapons near the town of Janet consisting of automatic rifles, rocket-propelled grenades and ammunition boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/05/algeria-terrorism-egypt-alliance-libya.html |title=Algeria considers Egypt alliance to confront Libyan terror threat |publisher=[[Al-Monitor]] |date=21 May 2014 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |author=Shabbi, Omar |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051807/http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2014/05/algeria-terrorism-egypt-alliance-libya.html |deadurl=no |archivedate= 8 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' reported on 30 May that Algerian forces were strongly present in Libya and it was claimed shortly after by an Algerian journalist from ''[[El Watan]]'' that a full regiment of 3,500 paratroopers logistically supported by 1,500 other men crossed into Libya and occupied a zone in the west of the country. They were later shown to be operating alongside French special forces in the region. However, all of these claims were later denied by the Algerian government through Prime Minister [[Abdelmalek Sellal]] who told the senate that "Algeria has always shown its willingness to assist [our] sister countries, but things are clear: the Algerian army will not undertake any operation outside Algerian territory".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/truth-and-algerian-involvement-libya-1979161660 |title=Truth and Algerian involvement in Libya |work=[[Middle East Eye]] |date=7 July 2014 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |author=Keenan, Jeremy |archivedate=23 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723030325/http://www.middleeasteye.net/columns/truth-and-algerian-involvement-libya-1979161660 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 May 2014, the Algerian government responded to a threat on its embassy in Libya by sending a team of special forces to Tripoli to escort its diplomatic staff in a military plane out of the country. "Due to a real and imminent threat targeting our diplomats the decision was taken in coordination with Libyan authorities to urgently close our embassy and consulate general temporarily in Tripoli," the Algerian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/16/us-algeria-libya-idUSBREA4F0J420140516 |title=Algeria evacuates diplomats from Libya after threats |agency=Reuters |date=16 May 2014 |accessdate=31 July 2014 |author=Chikhi, Lamine |archivedate=13 July 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713111645/https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/16/us-algeria-libya-idUSBREA4F0J420140516 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, the Algerian government shut down all of its border crossings with Libya and the army command raised its security alert status by tightening its presence along the border, especially on the Tinalkoum and Debdab border crossings.

Egyptian authorities have long expressed concern over the instability in eastern Libya spilling over into Egypt due to the rise of jihadist movements in the region, which the government believes to have developed into a safe transit for wanted Islamists following the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|2013 coup d'état]] in Egypt that ousted [[Muslim Brotherhood]]-backed president [[Mohamed Morsi]].

'''Male unemployment''' is [[unemployment]], being out of work and actively seeking to work, among [[Man|men]].

The [[2008–2012 global recession]] has been called a "mancession" because of the disproportionate number of men who lost their jobs as compared to women.  This gender gap became wide in the United States in 2009, when 10.5% of men in the [[labor force]] were unemployed, compared with 8% of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |work=The Sunday Times |date=June 7, 2009

"'''May you live in interesting times'''" is an [[English proverbs|English expression]] purported to be a translation of a traditional [[Chinese culture|Chinese]] [[curse]]. While seemingly a blessing, the expression is normally used ironically, with the clear implication that "uninteresting times" of [[peace]] and [[tranquillity]] are more life-enhancing than interesting ones, which, from a historical perspective, usually include disorder and conflict.

Despite being so common in English as to be known as the "'''Chinese curse'''", the saying is [[apocryphal]], and no actual Chinese source has ever been produced. The most likely connection to Chinese culture may be deduced from analysis of the late-19th-century speeches of [[Joseph Chamberlain]], probably erroneously transmitted and revised through his son [[Austen Chamberlain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Toole|first1=Garson|title=May You Live in Interesting Times|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/12/18/live/|website=Quote Investigator: Exploring the Origins of Quotations|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Despite being widely attributed as a Chinese curse, there is no known equivalent expression in Chinese.&lt;ref&gt;Bryan W. Van Norden. ''Introduction to Classical ChinesePhilosophy''. (Indianapolis: Hackett, 2011; {{ISBN|9781603844697}}), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TtK5750bm30C&amp;pg=PA53 p. 53], sourcing Fred R. Shapiro, ed., ''The Yale Book of Quotations'' (New Haven: Yale University Press 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TtK5750bm30C&amp;pg=PA257 p. 669]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006133720/https://books.google.com/books?id=TtK5750bm30C&amp;pg=PA53 |date=October 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nearest related [[Chinese proverbs|Chinese expression]] is "{{lang|zh|{{linktext|寧|為|太平|犬}}，{{linktext|莫|做|亂|離|人}}}}" (''nìng wéi tàipíng quǎn, mò zuò luàn lí rén''), which is usually translated as "Better to be a dog in a peaceful time, than to be a human in a chaotic (warring) period."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammarphobia.com/blog/2012/07/interesting-times.html May you live in interesting times], The Grammarphobia Blog&lt;/ref&gt; The expression originates from Volume 3 of the 1627 short story collection by [[Feng Menglong]], ''[[Stories to Awaken the World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Feng Menglong]]|title=[[:wikisource:zh:醒世恆言/第03卷|Stories to Awaken the World (醒世恆言)]]|date=1627|volume=3 |accessdate=2015-09-06|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic premise of the curse may also be found in a quote by the German philosopher [[Hegel]]:

{{quote|text=World history is not the ground of happiness. The periods of happiness are empty pages in her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mh-oDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT284&amp;lpg=PT284&amp;dq=%22world+history+is+not+the+ground+of+happiness%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=CABIOe_HoQ&amp;sig=0ny4mpjkLLIBZj4LyyH4pkCKrgA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwimg_bF95vYAhUDWCYKHQJ1C0AQ6AEIETAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22world%20history%20is%20not%20the%20ground%20of%20happiness%22&amp;f=false|title=Romancing Decay: Ideas of Decadence in European Culture|last=St John|first=Michael|date=2016-12-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351902564|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;|author=Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel}}

Evidence that the phrase was in use as early as 1936 is provided in a memoir written by [[Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen]], the British Ambassador to China in 1936 and 1937, and published in 1949. He mentions that before he left England for China in 1936, a friend told him of a Chinese curse, "May you live in interesting times."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knatchbull-Hugessen |first=Hughe |title=Diplomat in Peace and War |publisher=John Murray |year=1949 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjMvAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=interesting+times |page=ix }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Frederic René Coudert, Jr.]] also recounts having heard the phrase at the time:

{{quote|Some years ago, in 1936, I had to write to a very dear and honoured friend of mine, who has since died, Sir Austen Chamberlain, brother of the present Prime Minister, and I concluded my letter with a rather banal remark "that we were living in an interesting age". Evidently he read the whole letter, because by return mail he wrote to me and concluded as follows: "Many years ago I learned from one of our diplomats in China that one of the principal Chinese curses heaped upon an enemy is, 'May you live in an interesting age.{{'"}} "Surely", he said, "no age has been more fraught with insecurity than our own present time." That was three years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frederic R. |last=Coudert |title=Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=1940 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2mIKAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=interesting |page=269 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=="Chamberlain Curse"?==
Research by philologist Garson O'Toole shows a probable origin in the mind of Austen Chamberlain's father [[Joseph Chamberlain]] dating around the late-19th and early 20th centuries. Specifically, O'Toole cites the following statement Joseph made during a speech in 1898:

{{quote|I think that you will all agree that ''we are living in most interesting times.'' (Hear, hear.) I never remember myself a time in which our history was so full, in which day by day brought us new objects of interest, and, let me say also, ''new objects for anxiety.'' (Hear, hear.) [emphasis added]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Toole|first1=Garson|title=May You Live in Interesting Times|url=http://quoteinvestigator.com/2015/12/18/live/|website=Quote Investigator: Exploring the Origins of Quotations|accessdate=27 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From this it is likely that the Chamberlain family may have inadvertently transmitted a folk etymology by expanding Joseph Chamberlain's use of the concept to refer to some Chinese curse. 

The phrase is again described as a "Chinese curse" in an article published in ''Child Study: A Journal of Parent Education'' in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Child Study: A Journal of Parent Education |volume=21 |page=52 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IipEAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=interesting+times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Melodifestivalen'''{{Ref_label|A|a|none}} ({{IPA-sv|mɛlʊ²diːfɛstɪˌvɑːlɛn}}; literally "The Melody Festival"){{Ref_label|B|b|none}} is an annual [[music competition]] organised by [[Sweden|Swedish]] public broadcasters [[Sveriges Television]] (SVT) and [[Sveriges Radio]] (SR). It determines the country's representative for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], and has been staged almost every year since 1959. Since 2000, the competition has been the most popular television programme in Sweden;&lt;ref name="popularprogramme"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060513205318/http://www.sweden.se/templates/cs/Article____12358.aspx Television in Sweden].

In 2012, the semifinals averaged 3.3&amp;nbsp;million viewers, and over an estimated four million people in Sweden watched the final, almost half of the Swedish population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Månadsrapport Februari 2012|url=http://mms.se/_dokument/rapporter/manad/M%C3%A5nadsrapport_2012-02.pdf|publisher=MMS - Mediamätning i Skandinavien|accessdate=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lindström|first=Therese|title=Över fyra miljoner såg finalen|url=http://www.aftonbladet.se/nojesbladet/melodifestivalen/article14510903.ab|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=Aftonbladet|date=12 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival has produced six [[Eurovision Song Contest winners|Eurovision winners]] and eighteen top-five placings for [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest|Sweden at the contest]]. The winner of the Melodifestival has been chosen by panels of jurors since its inception. Since 1999, the juries have been joined by a public [[televoting|telephone vote]] which has an equal influence over the final outcome. The competition makes a considerable impact on music charts in Sweden.

The introduction of semifinals in 2002 raised the potential number of contestants from around twelve to thirty-two. A children's version of the competition, [[Lilla Melodifestivalen]], also began that year. Light orchestrated pop songs, known locally as ''[[schlager]]'' music, are so prevalent that the festival is sometimes referred to as ''Schlagerfestivalen'' ("The schlager festival") by the [[Media in Sweden|Swedish media]].&lt;ref name="schlagerfestivalen"&gt;[http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/noje/story/0,2789,135505,00.html "Jag koncentrerar mig på schlagerfestivalen"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061017011745/http://www.aftonbladet.se/vss/noje/story/0,2789,135505,00.html |date=2006-10-17 }} {{sv icon}} ["I am concentrating on schlagerfestivalen"].

With seven nations competing, the first [[Eurovision Song Contest]] took place in [[Lugano]], [[Switzerland]] in May 1956. Sweden's first contest was the third, in 1958. Without broadcasting a selection, Sveriges Radio (SR){{Ref_label|C|c|none}} chose to send [[Alice Babs]] to the contest in Hilversum. The song selected was "Samma stjärna lyser för oss två", later renamed "Lilla stjärna".&lt;ref&gt;Leif Thorsson. ''Melodifestivalen genom tiderna'' ["Melodifestivalen through time"] (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;12. Stockholm: Premium Publishing AB. {{ISBN|91-89136-29-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It finished fourth at Eurovision on 12 March 1958.

The first Melodifestival, incorporated into the ''Säg det med musik'' radio series, took place on 29 January 1959 at [[Cirkus (Stockholm)|Cirkus]] in [[Stockholm]]; eight songs participated. Four "expert" juries in [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]], [[Malmö]], and [[Luleå]] decided the winner.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p.&amp;nbsp;19&lt;/ref&gt; The competition was won by [[Siw Malmkvist]] performing "Augustin", but SR decided that the winning song—regardless of its original performer—would be performed by [[Brita Borg]] at Eurovision. This policy, of selecting the artist for Eurovision internally and having other artists perform potential Swedish entries at Melodifestivalen, was stopped in 1961. The competition became a stand-alone television programme in 1960, known as the ''Eurovisionschlagern, svensk final''. In the event's early years, it was broadcast to [[Norway]] and [[Denmark]] through the [[Nordvision]] network.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; The competition adopted its current name, ''Melodifestivalen'', in 1967.

The Melodifestival has failed to be staged on three occasions. In 1964, the competition was cancelled due to an artist's strike; Sweden did not send a song to Eurovision that year.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden was absent at Eurovision for a second time in 1970 because of a Nordic boycott of the voting system, which had led to a four-way tie for first place at the 1969 contest.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, pp.&amp;nbsp;82–83.&lt;/ref&gt; After SR staged the 1975 contest in Stockholm, [[left-wing]] groups argued that Sweden should not spend money to win and host Eurovision again. This led to mass demonstrations against commercial music and the organisation of an anti-commercial ''Alternativfestivalen''.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, pp.&amp;nbsp;118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Sweden decided not to send a song to Eurovision 1976, but returned in 1977.

[[Image:ESC 2008 - Sweden - Charlotte Perrelli, 2nd semifinal.jpg|thumb|left|[[Charlotte Perrelli]], the 2008 winner of Melodifestivalen, performing on [[Eurovision song contest]] in [[Belgrade]] ]]Hundreds of songs and performers have entered Melodifestivalen since its debut. Although songwriters living outside Sweden were once not allowed to enter Melodifestivalen, the 2012 contest marked the first time foreign songwriters could submit entries, provided that they collaborated with a Swedish songwriter. To be eligible, songwriters and performers must be at least sixteen years of age on the day of the first [[Eurovision Song Contest#Semi-finals|Eurovision semifinal]].&lt;ref name="songlength"&gt;[http://www.svtstatic.se/image-cms/svtse/1335528737/melodifestivalen/article52429.svt/BINARY/Melodifestivalen_2007_tavlingsregler.pdf Melodifestivalen 2007—Tävlingsregler] {{sv icon}} ["Melodifestivalen 2007—Competition rules"].

Until 2001, participation in the festival was limited to a single night. The number of contestants ranged from five to twelve. A two-round system was used intermittently between 1981 and 1998, in which all but five of the contestants were eliminated in a first round of voting. Failure to reach the second round under this system was seen as a major failure for a prominent artist; when [[Elisabeth Andreassen]] failed to qualify in 1984, it almost ended her career.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p.&amp;nbsp;171.&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of weekly semifinals in 2002 increased the number of contestants to thirty-two. At least ten of the contestants must perform in [[Swedish language|Swedish]].&lt;ref name="songlength"/&gt; A [[Compact disc|CD]] of each year's competing songs has been released since 2001, and a [[DVD]] of the semifinals and final since 2003.

Melodifestivalen has been the launch-pad for the success of popular local acts, such as [[ABBA]], [[Tommy Körberg]], and [[Lisa Nilsson]]. The competition has played host to performers from outside Sweden, including [[Baccara]], [[Alannah Myles]], [[Katrina Leskanich]], and [[Cornelis Vreeswijk]]. Melodifestivalen participants have also represented—and unsuccessfully tried to represent—other countries at Eurovision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hemsida.biggweb.net/christofer/esc/swedes_abroad.html Swedes abroad].

The impact that the competition makes on the Swedish charts means an artist need not win the competition to earn significant domestic record sales. For example, the song which finished last at Melodifestivalen 1990, "Symfonin" by [[Loa Falkman]], topped the Swedish singles chart.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p.&amp;nbsp;213.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent occurrence was 2016 with [[Samir &amp; Viktor]]'s song "[[Bada Nakna]]".

== Selection of contestants ==
The process of narrowing thousands of potential entries down to twenty-eight lasts over seven months. SVT directly selects fourteen entries from amongst the submissions from the public at large. Thirteen additional entries come from special invitations made by SVT or other entries that SVT has selected from amongst the submissions. Finally, the twenty-eighth entry is selected via the "Svensktoppen Nästa" competition. The entire process can begin as early as May of the previous year and is finished by January.

In the pre-selection, song length is limited to three minutes and twenty seconds; songs must be shortened to three minutes if they reach the final twenty-eight and qualifying songs may also be remixed.&lt;ref name="songlength"/&gt;

The submission process is overseen by members of the Swedish Music Publishers Association (SMFF), whose task is to reduce the number of songs, which have numbered over 3,000 a year since 2002, to around 1,200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=3969 |title=One month left for Melodifestivalen Entries |last=Fisher |first=Luke |date=2008-08-25 |publisher=''Oikotimes'' |accessdate=2008-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301050602/http://www.oikotimes.com/v2/index.php?file=articles&amp;id=3969 |archivedate=2009-03-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3,440 entries received in the preselection for [[Sweden in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009#Melodifestivalen 2009|Melodifestivalen 2009]] is the most in the competition's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12324|title=Recordbreaker for Melodifestivalen entries|last=Viniker|first=Barry|date=2008-09-26|publisher=''ESCToday''|accessdate=2008-09-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080928180831/http://www.esctoday.com/news/read/12324|archivedate=2008-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SMFF's choices are then given to a sixteen-person jury of music professionals, SVT staff and other members of the public.&lt;ref name="mfjury"&gt;[http://hemsida.biggweb.net/christofer/esc/mel2006.html#uttagning Melodifestivalen 2006—selection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070219221723/http://hemsida.biggweb.net/christofer/esc/mel2006.html |date=2007-02-19 }}.

This is often followed by fervent speculation over who will perform the songs. Songwriters that qualify must provide interviews to SVT, attend a press conference before the competition, and remain open to promotional appearances if their song reaches the final.&lt;ref name="songlength"/&gt;

=== Artists and wildcards ===
SVT selects performers for the entries. Artists who perform the demo of a song automatically enter the competition; they must perform their songs if suitable alternate performers cannot be found. The artists' songs risk disqualification if they refuse.&lt;ref name="songlength"/&gt; In the past, this rule led to the disqualification of, among others, Carola's "När löven faller" in 2003 and [[Stephen Simmonds]]'s "So Good" in 2006.&lt;ref name="narlovenfaller"&gt;Sietse Bakker (17 December 2002).

The contestants that will perform the twenty-eight qualifiers from the preselection are announced in late November. [[Singer-songwriter]]s are common.

The competition first took place outside Stockholm in 1975 as part of a [[decentralisation]] policy at SR.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt; Stockholm has hosted thirty-seven finals in total, including the first fourteen. Gothenburg has hosted eight, and [[Malmö]] seven. The competition's final has never been held outside these cities. Before the expansion, the host of the previous year's Melodifestival would host the Eurovision Song Contest in the event of a Swedish victory. Hence, the 1985 Eurovision was held in Gothenburg, and the 1992 contest in Malmö.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escsweden.com/esc1985.htm Eurovision Song Contest 1985] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724090109/http://escsweden.com/esc1985.htm |date=2008-07-24 }} {{sv icon}}.

== Televised rounds ==
The televised Melodifestival lasts five weeks and consists of six live shows: four semifinals, in which eight songs compete; a Second Chance round featuring songs which narrowly missed out on qualification from the semifinals; and a grand final. Ten songs comprise the final: two automatic qualifiers from each of the semifinals, and the two most popular songs in the Second Chance round. In 2015, there are seven songs for each semifinal, and twelve (eight winners and four from Andra Chansen) in the final.

=== Semifinals and Second Chance ===
Prior to the introduction of the current format of semifinals (''deltävlingar'') in 2002, the competition was usually a single live show. Under the current system, four semifinals are broadcast at 20:00&amp;nbsp;[[Central European Time|CET]] on consecutive Saturday nights. The semifinals begin in early February, and seven songs compete in each show.

Unlike in the final, no juries are used; televoting decides the results. The songs are performed live with telephone lines open for the first round of voting; two songs with the fewest votes do not qualify to the second round. The top five battle for a place in the final and Andra chansen round - the 1st and 2nd placed songs qualifying to the final, and the 3rd and 4th placed songs progressing to Andra chansen.
Both finalists reprise their entries at the end of the broadcast. The organisation of a semifinal system for Melodifestivalen popularised televised heats at national Eurovision selections.&lt;ref&gt;[[Svante Stockselius]]. ''Melodifestivalen genom tiderna'' (2006), foreword p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar system was adopted by the Eurovision itself in 2004.

The Second Chance round (''Andra chansen'') is the fifth heat in which the remaining four entries to the final are chosen. The third- and fourth-placed songs from each semifinal (eight songs in total) compete in the event. The first Second Chance round in 2002 had a panel of former winners decide the two finalists.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p.&amp;nbsp;299.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2003 and 2006, the semifinal performances were re-broadcast, and a round of voting narrowed the songs to three or four. Another round then determined the two finalists. The programme was broadcast on the Sunday afternoon after the fourth semifinal. It was held in a smaller venue than those that would have hosted the semifinals—such as [[Berns Salonger]] in Stockholm, which hosted the Second Chance round in 2005.

In 2007, the Second Chance round became a full semifinal, taking place in a venue comparable in size to those hosting the others. The expanded Second Chance takes place on a Saturday night, adding an extra week to the event's timetable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=47345&amp;a=637174&amp;lid=puff_637174&amp;lpos=rubrik Melodifestivalens cup] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930044429/http://www.svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=47345&amp;a=637174&amp;lid=puff_637174&amp;lpos=rubrik |date=2007-09-30 }} {{sv icon}} ["Melodifestivalen's cup"]. SVT.se (11 August 2006). Retrieved on 28 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The format of voting also changed with the introduction of a knock-out system. The system pairs the eight songs off against each other, then narrows them down to four before pairing them off again. The winners of the two second round pairings go through to the final. The two finalists do not reprise their songs at the end of the programme.

In 2015, the system was changed again. The eight songs are divided into four duels, with one song from each duel qualifying into the final, bringing the number of finalists to 12.

=== Final ===
The final takes place at 20:00&amp;nbsp;CET on a Saturday in mid-March. Twelve songs (11 songs in [[Melodifestivalen 2009|2009]], 10 before [[Melodifestivalen 2015|2015]]) participate: two from each semifinal, four from the Second Chance round, and, only in 2009,  the international jury's choice. A running order is decided by the competition's supervisors the week before to ensure that similar songs and artists are kept apart in the final.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Keech (4 March 2007).

As at Eurovision, a broadcast of the EBU logo introduces and closes the television coverage, accompanied by the prelude to [[Marc-Antoine Charpentier]]'s setting of "[[Te Deum (Charpentier)|Te Deum]]". Video "postcards" introduce the entries. The final includes interval performances, which are performed while the juries deliberate and before the televote closes. Former Melodifestivalen contestants have performed as interval acts in the past, including Lena Philipsson in 2005 and the multi-artist medley of former entries in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carolainternational.com/history/index.html Carola Häggkvist Biography] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106090711/http://www.carolainternational.com/history/index.html |date=2007-11-06 }}.

The winner receives a trophy, ''Den stora Sångfågeln'' (''The Great Songbird''), from the previous year's winner. The trophy, designed by [[Ernst Billgren]], was unveiled in 2005 and awarded to all previous Melodifestivalen winners at the ''[[Alla tiders Melodifestival]]'' gala in March of that year.&lt;ref name="mfwaterloo"/&gt; The winner of the competition reprises their song at the end of the event.

== Voting ==
{{main|Voting at Melodifestivalen}}

[[Image:Melodifestivalen voting 2005.jpg|thumb|left|Ulf Elfving announcing the votes of the Stockholm jury at the 2005 final. The points scored by each entry are shown on a graphic scoreboard.]]Before the introduction of the current voting system in 1999, a group of regional or age-based juries decided the winner of Melodifestivalen. In 1993, televoting was used experimentally, but proved unsuccessful. The Swedish telephone network collapsed due to the number of calls, and claims by the Swedish tabloid press suggested the use of televoting had drastically altered the results. Evening newspapers released what they claimed to be the back-up juries' votes, which showed that the winner, [[Arvingarna]]'s "[[Eloise (Arvingarna song)|Eloise]]", would have finished fourth had the juries' votes counted. SVT never confirmed the accuracy of these claims.&lt;ref&gt;The tabloid's "winner" was Nick Borgen's "We are All the Winners". Thorsson, p.&amp;nbsp;233.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Melodifestivalen juries labelled.png|right|thumb|SVT has eleven regional news districts, which have been represented by a jury in the final of Melodifestivalen in past editions.]]
The current voting format introduced in 1999 is a [[positional voting system]], similar to that used at the [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision Song Contest]]. The voting is made up of two segments, in the first of which juries announce their votes; in the second segment the televoting result is announced. The total value of votes has usually been 2 x 473 points  (2 x 638 since 2018), which means that televotes and juries have an equal 50/50 weighing in the final result. The juries, usually 11, have represented either Swedish regions or, since 2010, countries participating in the year's Eurovision Song Contest. Until 2017, each jury awarded 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 points to their top seven songs; however, since 2018, the points have been changed to 1 to 7, 8, 10 and 12 points. After the jury voting, the televoting result is revealed by the hosts in ascending order. Between 1999 and 2010, the televoting points were fixed; the top seven songs would receive 11, 22, 44, 66, 88, 110 and 132 points. Starting in 2011, televoting points are given to each entry based on its percentage of total vote. If an entry receives 10% of the televotes it will be equivalent to 10% of 473 points, i.e. 48 points (or 638 and 64 points respectively since 2018). The song with the highest number of points at the end of the voting is the winner.

Telephone lines open immediately after the radio preview for the final and do not close until the juries have voted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/Press/programinformation/index.asp?Pubid=806334&amp;dtDate1=2006-03-18&amp;intPressUnitId=0&amp;interval=2&amp;newdate=2 Melodifestivalen 2006—ikväll avgörs det!] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001001408/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/Press/programinformation/index.asp?Pubid=806334&amp;dtDate1=2006-03-18&amp;intPressUnitId=0&amp;interval=2&amp;newdate=2 |date=2007-10-01 }} {{sv icon}} ["Melodifestivalen 2006—this evening it is decided!"].

The votes of the juries are announced by spokespeople who are not members of the juries. The votes are read in ascending order, beginning with one point and finishing with twelve. When read, they are repeated by the host, for example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Spokesperson: "Ett poäng till melodi nummer två." (''One point to song number two.'')&lt;br /&gt;
Presenter: Ett poäng till (name song)." (''One point to (name song).'')&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 2012, most spokespeople have announced the points in English, with the hosts repeating them in Swedish.

As the votes are announced, they are collated on a graphic scoreboard. SVT varies the way the jury votes are announced from year to year. For example, the finalists of ''[[Expedition: Robinson]]'' acted as spokespeople in 2004, and in 2006 [[Fredrik Lindström (writer)|Fredrik Lindström]] announced jury tallies using the [[Swedish dialects|dialects]] of each region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=11507&amp;a=190231 Melodifestivalen 2004: Juryn vs Folket] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927190409/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=11507&amp;a=190231 |date=2007-09-27 }} {{sv icon}} ["Melodifestivalen 2004: The jury vs. the people"].

Sweden has the second highest number of wins for a country at Eurovision; only [[Ireland in the Eurovision Song Contest|Ireland]] has won the contest more often.

== Rules ==
Most of Melodifestivalen's rules are dictated by [[rules of the Eurovision Song Contest|those of the Eurovision Song Contest]].  However, regulations have been introduced by the Swedish broadcasters. The competition's official rules are released by SVT early in preparation for each year's Melodifestival, to ensure any changes are noted by songwriters and performers.

There was a limit of six people on stage for each performance. This included the Melodifestivalen choir (''huskören'', literally "the house choir"), a five-person group of flexible backing singers used by most participants. Artists could use some or all of the back-up singers, or use their own group. All vocals had to be completely live; human voices were not allowed on backing tracks.&lt;ref name="songlength"/&gt; However, from 2009, the number of performers allowed on stage was eight, and voices were allowed on backing tracks.&lt;ref name="2009changes"&gt;[http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=79613&amp;a=1228443&amp;lid=puff_1228435&amp;lpos=extra_0 Melodifestivalen förändras] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226152910/http://svt.se/svt/jsp/Crosslink.jsp?d=79613&amp;a=1228443&amp;lid=puff_1228435&amp;lpos=extra_0 |date=2009-02-26 }} {{sv icon}} ["Melodifestivalen changes"]. Sveriges Television. Retrieved on 27 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; A live [[orchestra]] was used every year from the event's debut to 2000, except 1985 and 1986. Two orchestras were used between 1960 and 1963, a large orchestra and ''Göte Wilhelmsons kvartett'', a jazz quartet.&lt;ref&gt;Later a quintet. Thorsson, pp.&amp;nbsp;19,&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2001, participants have performed to [[backing track]]s.

Entries cannot be publicly broadcast until the semifinals are previewed on radio.&lt;ref name="preview"&gt;[http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/mall/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2350&amp;Artikel=1175411 Hör låtarna först i Sveriges Radio P4] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930224938/http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/mall/artikel.asp?ProgramID=2350&amp;Artikel=1175411 |date=2007-09-30 }} {{sv icon}} ["Hear the songs first on Sveriges Radio P4"]. SR.se (30 January 2007). Retrieved on 4 May 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; Entries eliminated in the semifinals may be broadcast as soon as the semifinal has finished. An embargo is placed on songs that qualify for the later rounds until the previews for the Second Chance are broadcast. After this, restrictions on the broadcast of contestant songs are lifted.&lt;ref name="songlength"/&gt;

Broadcasters sometimes make sweeping changes to winning songs before they go to Eurovision. For example, at Melodifestivalen 1961, Siw Malmkvist won with "April, April". Performing after her victory, she stumbled on the lyrics of the song and laughed out loud. The press criticised this as childish. SR replaced her with [[Lill-Babs]] for the Eurovision Song Contest.&lt;ref name="malmkvist"&gt;The press literally described it as having "played the monkey". [http://www.gylleneskor.se/contest/melodifestivalen-1961 Melodifestivalen 1961] {{sv icon}}. Gylleneskor.se. Retrieved on 11 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1987 winner "[[Boogaloo (song)|Fyra bugg och en Coca Cola]]", performed by [[Lotta Engberg]], is another example; the song's title was changed to "Boogaloo" for Eurovision, as use of a brand name was against the Contest's rules. This name was chosen as Sweden's two previous Eurovision winners had also included the suffix "-loo".&lt;ref&gt;Christer Björkman (2005). ''Melodifestivalen 50 år: vinnarna'' [DVD]. Pan Vision/SVT.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1999, competing songs were only permitted in Swedish, apart from 1965, 1973, 1974, 1975. This did not stop most winning entries recording English (and other language) versions of their songs. Since the abolition of Eurovision's language restrictions in 1999, regardless of the performance language at Melodifestivalen, every Swedish entry has been in English. Spanish, French, [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] are among the other languages to have featured. [[Cameron Cartio]]'s entry in Melodifestivalen 2005 was performed in a [[constructed language]].&lt;ref&gt;Pourya E.

== Media coverage ==
Melodifestivalen is broadcast on television, radio and the internet. It is broadcast on [[SVT1]] with international coverage on [[SVT World]]. Until 1987, the competition was broadcast on Sveriges&amp;nbsp;Radio&amp;nbsp;TV, later known as TV1. Between 1988 and 2000, the event was broadcast on different channels depending on where it was held. Finals in Stockholm were broadcast on Kanal&amp;nbsp;1 (formerly TV1) while finals in Gothenburg or Malmö were broadcast on [[SVT2|TV2]].&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p.&amp;nbsp;196.&lt;/ref&gt; Sveriges Radio has broadcast the event on [[SR P1|P1]], [[SR P3|P3]] and [[SR P4|P4]], where is currently broadcast.

Although the final is traditionally held on a Saturday, in 1990 it was held on a Friday.  TV2 suggested this would attract more viewers. In 1991, it was held on [[Easter|Easter Sunday]] for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, pp.&amp;nbsp;210,&amp;nbsp;216.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 final was delayed by a week for coverage of the [[2002 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;Thorsson, p.&amp;nbsp;300.&lt;/ref&gt;

The competition has had an official website since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19990421065133/http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/1999/index.html Melodifestivalen 1999] {{sv icon}}.

SVT.se (2005). Retrieved on 20 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2006, between February and the Eurovision final in May, SR has webcast a radio station dedicated to the competition called ''P4&amp;nbsp;Melodifest''. On P4, the public previews semifinalists every Friday.&lt;ref name="preview"/&gt; Broadcast the night after the final, a ''dagen efter'' ("the day after") television programme acts as an [[epilogue]] to the event. It gauges the reactions of the finalists after the competition's climax. No commentary is given for the event on television. [[Carolina Norén]] is commentator on the event for [[Sveriges Radio]].&lt;ref name="mf2007"/&gt; The festival has been broadcast in widescreen since 2002 and [[Dolby Digital]] since 2004.

The competition's viewing figures have been rising since 2002. In 2007, approximately 4.1&amp;nbsp;million Swedes—almost 44% of the country's population—watched the final, and between 2.9&amp;nbsp;million and 3.2&amp;nbsp;million viewers watched each of the semifinals. The viewing figures for the 2007 festival are nearly two million short of the highest recorded viewing figures from 1990.&lt;ref name="ratings"&gt;[http://hemsida.biggweb.net/christofer/esc/mftittare.html Melodifestivalen—Viewing figures].

Melodifestivalen's image has evolved throughout its existence, but one word has defined the competition's music: ''[[schlager]]''. In Sweden, schlager (a German word literally meaning a "hit") represents any song associated with the competition, from the [[jazz music]] featured heavily in the 1960s to entries such as [[Linda Bengtzing]]'s in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kindaposten.se/article/articleview/17721/1/67/ Schlaget om Leksand] {{sv icon}} ["The battle (word pun on "schlager") of Leksand"].

On-stage [[gimmick]]s have long been a part of performances at the competition. [[Lena Philipsson]]'s use of a microphone stand in her performance of "[[Det gör ont]]" at the 2004 competition is an example.

After the 2007 event, Karolina Lassbo of ''Dagens Media'' criticised the festival's musical content and production, arguing that the 1988 competition was "the time when Melodifestivalen was still a schlager competition" and the event had become "a cross between [reality series] ''Fame Factory'' and [inter-city game show] ''Stadskampen''".&lt;ref&gt;Karolina Lassbo (16 March 2007).

'''Deanna Lee Criswell''' (officially known as "'''Jane Doe 19'''" and informally as the "'''Pima County Jane Doe'''" while she was unidentified)&lt;ref name=spokesman/&gt; (September 20, 1971 - {{circa}} November 1987) was a sixteen-year-old [[Americans|American]] girl who was found murdered on November 25, 1987 in [[Marana, Arizona]]. Her body went unidentified for 27 years until February 11, 2015 when relatives came across her unidentified person's profile online and submitted their DNA. She had been shot to death, most likely by William Ross Knight, who was known for his criminal career in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

==Background and disappearance==
Criswell's parents divorced when she was three years old. Her father was a trucker and her mother, who had custody of Deanna in [[Spokane, Washington]], worked two jobs to support their family. Her older sister, fourteen years her senior, had left home a year after their parents divorced. She often spent time with her grandfather while her mother was away and became a "rebellious teen" following his death and was involved with a questionable group of older peers. She later moved into her father's residence in [[Seattle]], where her behavior improved until age 15 when similar pattern of actions resurfaced. She then took a bus back to Spokane to live with her mother once more.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; 

Six months before her death, she had run away from home and lived on the streets, still calling her father on occasion.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; She eventually began a relationship with 36-year-old William "Bill" Ross Knight, who then relocated to Tucson, Arizona and sent Criswell a bus ticket in September 1987 to reunite.&lt;ref name="spokesman" /&gt; She failed to call with her father after arriving. He was not immediately concerned due to the fact that she was able to "take care of herself." By the time Christmas arrived, he attempted to file a missing person report, yet local officials declined to cooperate due to her history of running away.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;&lt;ref name=of&gt;{{cite news|title=Victim of 1987 Killing in Arizona Identified as Spokane Teen|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/victim-1987-killing-arizona-identified-spokane-teen-28903227|accessdate=16 February 2015|work=ABC News Now|publisher=ABC|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==

Criswell's decomposing body was located in a culvert along [[Interstate 10]] on November 25, 1987 in [[Marana]], [[Pima County, Arizona]] by a homeless man.&lt;ref name=solved&gt;{{cite news|last1=Batarags|first1=Matiss|title=28-Year-Old Cold Case Solved, Victim Identified As Deanna Lee Criswell|work=Opposing Views|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jrn&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ronquillo|first1=Ina|title=Cold case homicide victim from 1987 identified|url=http://www.jrn.com/kgun9/news/Cold-case-homicide-victim-from-1987-identified-killer-identified-291546891.html|accessdate=16 February 2015|agency=ABC|issue=KGUN 9 News|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The man walked to the local police station to report the find. Tire tracks were present at the scene, indicating she had been killed at another location and deposited out of sight after death.&lt;ref name=who&gt;{{Cite episode |title=The Disappearing Doe |series=Who Killed Jane Doe? |first=Linda |last=Hendin |network=[[Investigation Discovery]] |date=20 February 2018 |season=2 |number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was estimated to have been between seventeen and twenty-one, at a height of around five feet, three inches and a weight of 138 pounds. It was believed that the victim was white or possibly a Hispanic or Native American female with fair skin. The victim's brown hair was determined to be short and curly. Her eye color could not be determined, as she had begun to decompose after exposure to the hot environment for several days or weeks.&lt;ref name=namus/&gt;&lt;ref name=of/&gt; There were no distinctive scars, birthmarks or tattoos on the body.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

She was wearing several layers of clothing, including a denim jacket with its sleeves rolled, a white jacket, gray sweater, a multicolored flannel shirt, black jeans, white shoes and purple underwear, the large amount of clothing indicating she was a runaway or perhaps a migrant.&lt;ref name=namus&gt;{{cite web|title=NamUs UP # 6773|url=https://identifyus.org/en/cases/6773|website=identifyus.org|publisher=[[National Missing and Unidentified Persons System]]|accessdate=12 January 2015|date=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A purple sweater had been placed over her face, indicating her killer knew her during life.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; The victim also had unusual and large upper front teeth that had a gap in between and had cared well for her teeth, also receiving adequate dental care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Case File: 753UFAZ|url=http://www.doenetwork.org/cases/753ufaz.html|website=doenetwork.org|publisher=[[The Doe Network]]|accessdate=12 January 2015|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jane Doe 1987|url=http://www.missingkids.org/poster/NCMU/1158630/1#poster|website=missingkids.org|publisher=[[National Center for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]|accessdate=12 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was shot five times with a .22 caliber firearm.&lt;ref name=spokesman/&gt; Criswell suffered four wounds to the torso and one to the neck at close range.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

==Investigation==

[[File:Pima County Jane Doe (1987).jpg|thumb|3D reconstruction of Criswell, created by the [[FBI]]]]

After the discovery of the body, the remains were transported to the Pima County Medical Examiner for an autopsy, where the cause of death would be determined and physical characteristics were estimated. It was discovered the victim had recently had sex, but had not been raped, as no trauma characteristic of a violent attack was found.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

Details of the case were released in efforts to identify the victim but proved fruitless. Several missing females were compared to the case; many of which were excluded based on dental characteristics. Additionally, fingerprints were used for comparison. After the investigation stalled, she was buried in the Pima County Cemetery in 1989.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

The case was eventually reopened in 2009 and the victim's body was exhumed.&lt;ref name=crime/&gt;&lt;ref name=case&gt;{{cite news|title=Marana Police Solve 1987 Cold Case|url=http://www.arizonadailyindependent.com/2015/02/13/marana-police-solve-1987-cold-case/|accessdate=16 February 2015|work=Arizona Daily Independent|date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were no suspects at the time, as the man who discovered the body had long since been cleared of any involvement. Additionally, another person of interest was eliminated from the case in 1988. Benjamin Batson, a convicted sex offender, previously seen with an unknown teenage girl, was stopped by police for a traffic violation near the location where the body was found. No trace of Criswell was located in his vehicle&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; At their location in Virginia, the FBI completed a [[forensic facial reconstruction]] of the victim in 2010, after her exhumation, in hopes that someone who knew the victim in life could possibly recognize her.&lt;ref name=spokesman/&gt;&lt;ref name=manaraPD&gt;{{cite web|title=Deanna Lee Criswell poster|url=http://tucson.com/deanna-lee-criswell-poster/image_c56c1f24-b224-11e4-80d8-23e9a05ac956.html|website=tucson.com|publisher=Manara Police Department|accessdate=16 February 2015|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her DNA was also processed by the agency.&lt;ref name=of/&gt;

In 2011, a partial DNA profile was generated from evidence at the crime scene, which was not possible to perform in the past because of limitations with technology.&lt;ref name=spokesman/&gt;&lt;ref name=solved/&gt; The profile matched William Knight, who was now known for his spree robberies in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=press&gt;{{cite news|title=1987 shooting victim identified as Spokane girl, police in Arizona say|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/pacific-northwest-news/index.ssf/2015/02/spokane_girl_identified_as_198.html|accessdate=16 February 2015|work=Oregon Live|agency=Associated Press|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; One particular robbery in 1987 involved a .22 caliber pistol, which was the same caliber used in Criswell's murder.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt; Knight died in 2005 due to liver complications while serving time in prison and was never charged with her murder.&lt;ref name=crime&gt;{{cite news|last1=Murillo|first1=Lupita|title=Crime Trackers: Marana PD solves 28 year cold-case|url=http://www.kvoa.com/story/28087761/crime-trackers-marana-pd-solves-28-year-cold-case|accessdate=12 February 2015|work=News 4 Tucsan|agency=NNC|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although a suspect was identified, the victim's DNA had yet to match with any individual in the [[CODIS]] database.&lt;ref name=manaraPD/&gt; Investigators feared with Knight being deceased, they would be unable to identify the victim, due to the fact that he could not be questioned or prosecuted.&lt;ref name="who" /&gt;

===Identification===

It was announced that Criswell's body was identified on February 11, 2015.&lt;ref name=press/&gt; Her estranged aunt and uncle, who at first were hoping she was still alive, eventually turned to online databases, to search through unidentified persons cases after their hope dwindled.&lt;ref name=spokesman/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Ames, John |author2=Lisaius, Som |title=Marana Police ID victim in 1987 murder case|url=http://www.tucsonnewsnow.com/story/28084055/marana-police-id-victim-in-1987-murder-case|accessdate=16 February 2015|work=Tucsan News Now|agency=WorldNow|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kxly&gt;{{cite news|last1=LeFriec|first1=Alex|title=Missing Spokane teen identified as Arizona cold case victim|url=http://www.kxly.com/news/spokane-news/missing-spokane-teen-identified-as-arizona-cold-case-victim/31229018|accessdate=16 February 2015|work=KXLY|agency=CNN|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criswell was never reported missing by her family members, which is most likely a major reason why she remained unnamed for decades. Because of her history of running away from home, her family made the assumption that she would "contact them when she wanted to," as she had called her sister once after arriving in Tucson.&lt;ref name=spokesman&gt;{{cite news|author1=Brunt, Jonathan |author2=Culver, Nina |title=With persistence of aunt and uncle, ‘Jane Doe 19’ becomes Deanna Criswell|url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2015/feb/14/persistence-aunt-and-uncle-jane-doe-19-becomes-dea/|accessdate=16 February 2015|work=The Spokesman-Review|date=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kxly/&gt; The pair began to search through cases in Arizona, as they eventually learned that Criswell had been given a bus ticket by Knight to the area that she was later found dead.&lt;ref name=spokesman/&gt; 

Approximately five to ten months before her identification, they had discovered the unidentified person case on [[The Doe Network]] and believed that the Jane Doe was their missing niece, as the reconstruction bore a strong resemblance to her.&lt;ref name=solved/&gt;&lt;ref name=kxly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Craig|title=Cold case murder solved after 28 years|url=http://www.jrn.com/kgun9/news/Cold-case-murder-solved-after-28-years-291603631.html|accessdate=16 February 2015|work=KGUN 9 News|agency=ABC|date=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other characteristics, such as the height and weight approximation, were also similar.&lt;ref name=crime/&gt; After the pair contacted authorities, DNA samples were taken from Criswell's immediate family members to compare to the then-unidentified remains.&lt;ref name=case/&gt; The gravestone that stands over her remains was removed and updated to bear the victim's name.&lt;ref name=spokesman/&gt;

The '''National Prize for Plastic Arts''' ({{lang-es|'''Premio Nacional de Artes Plásticas'''}}) was created in [[Chile]] in 1992 under Law 19169 as one of the replacements of the [[National Prize of Art of Chile|National Prize of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idNorma=30536&amp;idVersion=1992-09-26 |title=Ley 19169: Establece normas sobre otorgamiento de Premios Nacionales |trans-title=Law 19169: Establishes Rules on Granting National Prizes |publisher=[[Ministry of Education (Chile)|Ministry of Education]] |language=Spanish |date=26 September 1992 |access-date=8 December 2017 |via=Library of the National Congress of Chile}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is granted "to the person who has distinguished himself by his achievements in the respective area of the arts" (Article 8 of the aforementioned law). It is part of the [[National Prize of Chile]].

The prize, which is awarded every two years, consists of a diploma, the sum of 6,576,457 [[Chilean peso|pesos]] ({{US$|{{To USD|6576457|CHL|round=yes}}}}) which is adjusted every year, according to the previous year's [[consumer price index]], and a pension of 20 {{ill|Monthly tax unit|es|Unidad tributaria mensual|lt=monthly tax units}} (approximately US$1,600).

'''The Nederland Music &amp; Arts Festival (aka NedFest)''' is an annual three-day outdoor music, arts and microbrew festival with camping located in the mountains of [[Nederland, Colorado]] on the shores of [[Barker Meadow Reservoir]], just 17 miles (27&amp;nbsp;km) west of (3, 000&amp;nbsp;ft. (900 m) above) [[Boulder, Colorado]] in the [[United States]], typically held the last weekend of August. The music featured is in the [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[jazz]], [[jamband]], jamgrass and [[worldbeat]] genres, or moreover, a sound that blends these styles and others together. Up to six bands perform each day on one stage with acoustic 'tweener sets between each band.

==History==

The first NedFest happened at Nederland's Chipeta Park in 1996. After a short hiatus it was resurrected during the first weekend of August 1999 at its current site, The Jeff Guercio Memorial Baseball Park, and happens annually during the last weekend in August.

==Management==

NedFest was founded by "Michigan" Mike Torpie, with Nederland Music &amp; Arts Festival managing all bookings, promotions and infrastructure, and [[Nederland Music Association]] handling administrative work. Mr Torpie was found dead in his car on Thanksgiving Day of 2011. The 2011 festival was dedicated as a memorial event to him.

==Attendance==
There is a limit of 2,000 tickets sold for each day. In addition to three full days of music, the festival also features arts and crafts, local [[microbrew]] beer, food, merchandise, service and information booths.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6718">A '''pin prick attack''' is a hypothetical assault on another person with a [[Hypodermic needle|needle]] or [[syringe]] tainted with the blood of somebody carrying a [[blood-borne disease]], such as [[HIV]]. Although there have been numerous cases of people being attacked with needles and syringes, the idea that people infected with AIDS have deliberately attempted to infect others in this manner is generally considered an [[urban legend]].  Only two documented cases exist of a pin prick attack leading directly to the transmission of HIV.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Origins==
Although fanciful tales of so-called "needle men" or [[Sexual slavery|white slavers]], who supposedly injected unsuspecting young girls with morphine before carrying them away into a life of [[prostitution]], had been around since the 1930s, the legend probably has its roots in a 1989 incident where ten teenage girls were arrested and later charged with stabbing numerous women with pins in the [[Upper West Side]] area of [[New York City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Craig Wolff |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/04/nyregion/10-teen-age-girls-held-in-upper-broadway-pinprick-attacks.html |title=10 Teen-Age Girls Held in Upper Broadway Pinprick Attacks - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=1989-11-04 |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming near the height of the 1980s HIV scares, this led to a great deal of panic amongst the local community although health officials were keen to stress that the chances of anybody contracting the virus in this way were practically zero, and nobody affected in the attacks subsequently tested positive for HIV.

==As an email/Internet scare story==
The rise of the Internet in the 1990s led to the rise of numerous urban legends concerning the pin prick attack, which could be quickly spread via email and discussion forums and which soon assumed a standardised form. The email would take the form of a warning to others that a young person had been visiting a [[Movie theater|cinema]] or a [[night club]] when the person felt a slight prick on his or her arm. Not taking any notice, the person would carry on with his or her leisure activity, and it was only later that the person would find stuck to his or her clothes or in his or her pocket a badge or sticker carrying the slogan "welcome to the AIDS club", followed a few months later with a positive HIV test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tafkac.org/ulz/needles.html |title=Urban Legend Zeitgeist: Hypodermic Hysteria |accessdate=August 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107005418/http://tafkac.org/ulz/needles.html |archivedate=November 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These rumours bear similarities to the so-called [[AIDS Mary]] legends of the 1980s, whereby a man would enjoy a one-night stand with a stranger at his house and awaken the next morning to find the stranger gone and the words "Welcome to the AIDS Club" written in red lipstick on his bathroom mirror.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msgboard.snopes.com/cgi-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=print_topic;f=91;t=000711 |title=snopes.com: Welcome to the AIDS club |publisher=Msgboard.snopes.com |date=2003-12-26 |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the American [[Center for Disease Control]] has stressed on numerous occasions that it has yet to confirm a single case of HIV as being transmitted in this fashion and has dismissed such emails as a [[hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/faq/faq5a.htm |title=Internet Archive Wayback Machine |publisher=Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention |date=2000-06-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000621193159/http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/pubs/faq/faq5a.htm |archivedate=2000-06-21 |accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motive behind such emails appears to be little more than a [[scare story]] intended to frighten the recipient into staying away from leisure establishments by playing on the public fear of AIDS and the notion that an individual could be infected with a killer disease through no fault of one's own.

==Documented Examples==
A pin prick attack leading to the deliberate transmission of HIV occurred at the [[Long Bay Jail]] in [[Sydney]] on July 22, 1990, when prison officer Geoffrey Pearce was attacked by HIV-infected prisoner Graham Farlow, who stabbed him with a syringe full of his own infected blood. Despite immediate medical attention and the "one in 200" chance of being infected, Pearce tested positive for the disease a few months later, and died of an AIDS related illness in 1997 at age 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1991-09-18 | url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardResult.aspx#/docid/HANSARD-1323879322-95432 | title=Prisons (Syringe Prohibition) Amendment Bill |publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] |accessdate=2017-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2001-06-14 | url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2001/s313015.htm | title=Hepatitis C thrives in jail |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=2007-02-09 | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/1500-pay-tribute-to-fallen-prison-guard/2007/02/09/1170524281480.html?page=2 | title=1500 pay tribute to fallen prison guard |publisher=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Brryan Jackson was injected with a syringe of HIV-infected blood by his father. Jackson was diagnosed with AIDS that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hancock|first1=Lucy|title=Brryan Jackson: My father injected me with HIV|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-37696071|accessdate=5 October 2017|agency=BBC World Service|publisher=BBC|date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, [[Richard J. Schmidt]], a physician in Lafayette, Louisiana, was convicted of attempted murder after injecting a former lover, Janice Trahan, with AIDS and [[Hepatitis C]]-tainted blood, claiming to be giving her a vitamin shot. Trahan developed both Hep-C and HIV as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=1999-05-24 | url=http://people.com/archive/act-of-revenge-vol-51-no-19/ | title=Act of Revenge – Vol. 51 No. 19 |work=[[People (magazine)|People]] |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=2015-06-15 | url=http://www.theadvocate.com/acadiana/news/article_4f2c8962-fd3c-5fa7-87cf-048188f626e3.htm | title=State board denies parole to former Lafayette doctor convicted of injecting mistress with AIDS, hepatitis C |publisher=[[The Acadiana Advocate]] |accessdate=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Piper Alpha''' was an [[oil platform|oil production platform]] in the [[North Sea]] approximately {{convert|120|mi|km}} north-east of [[Aberdeen]], Scotland, that was operated by [[Occidental Petroleum|Occidental Petroleum (Caledonia) Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;''OPCAL’s share 36.5%, Texaco’s share 23.5%, Union Texas Petroleum’s share 20%, and Thomson’s share 20%.'' CAPLAN, section 1.2&lt;/ref&gt; It began production in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;''by the end of 1976 and Claymore by the end of 1977'', CAPLAN 1.2&lt;/ref&gt; initially as an oil-only platform but later converted to add gas production.

An explosion and resulting oil and gas fires destroyed Piper Alpha on 6 July 1988, killing 167 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/pogofish/2643251484/|title=IMG_1777|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; including two crewmen of a rescue vessel;&lt;ref name="nightseacaughtfire"&gt;{{cite news | author=Peter Ross | title=The night the sea caught fire: Remembering Piper Alpha | url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/spectrum/The-night-the-sea-caught.4184800.jp | work= | date=15 June 2008  | accessdate=3 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 61 workers escaped and survived. Thirty bodies were never recovered. The total insured loss was about £1.7 billion ($3.4 billion), making it one of the costliest manmade catastrophes ever. At the time of the disaster, the platform accounted for approximately ten percent of [[North Sea oil]] and gas production, and the accident is the worst offshore oil disaster in terms of lives lost and industry impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Steven Duff | date=6 June 2008 |title=Remembering Piper Alpha disaster|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7438774.stm| work=BBC News|accessdate=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Aberdeen, the [[Kirk of St Nicholas]] in Union Street has dedicated a chapel in memory of those who died containing a Book of Remembrance listing all who died. There is a memorial sculpture in the Rose Garden of [[Hazlehead Park]].

==Piper oilfield==
{{main|Piper oilfield}}
Four companies that later transformed into the OPCAL joint venture obtained an oil exploration licence in 1972, discovered the [[Piper oilfield]] located at  {{Coord|58|28|N|0|15|E}}&lt;!-- http://www.og.dti.gov.uk/information/bb_updates/appendices/fields/piper.htm --&gt; in early 1973 and commenced fabrication of the platform, pipelines and onshore support structures. Oil production started in 1976 with about {{convert|250000|oilbbl|m3}} of oil per day increasing to {{convert|300000|oilbbl|m3}}. A gas recovery module was installed by 1980. Production declined to {{convert|125000|oilbbl|m3}} by 1988. OPCAL built the [[Flotta]] [[oil terminal]] in the [[Orkney Islands]] to receive and process oil from the Piper, [[Claymore oilfield|Claymore]] and [[Tartan oilfield|Tartan]] oilfields, each with its own platform. One {{convert|30|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter main oil pipeline ran {{convert|128|mi}} from ''Piper Alpha'' to Flotta, with a short oil pipeline from the Claymore platform joining it some {{convert|20|miles}} to the west. The Tartan field also fed oil to Claymore field and then onto the main line to Flotta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbd-data.co.uk/bb1998/append11.htm|title=Appendix 11 - Offshore Oil and Gas Trunk and Interfield Pipelines|publisher=DBD Data|accessdate=3 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201074452/http://www.dbd-data.co.uk/bb1998/append11.htm|archivedate=1 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separate {{convert|18|in|cm|adj=on}} diameter gas pipelines run from Tartan platform to the Piper, and from Piper to the gas compressing platform MCP-01 some {{convert|30|mi|km}} to the northwest.

==Construction==
A large fixed platform, ''Piper Alpha'' was situated on the Piper oilfield, approximately 120 miles (193&amp;nbsp;km) northeast of [[Aberdeen]] in 474 feet (144 m) of water, and comprised four modules separated by firewalls.&lt;ref&gt;''were not designed as blast protection walls and their function was to localise fire'' CAPLAN 2.6.1&lt;/ref&gt;
The platform was constructed by [[McDermott International|McDermott Engineering]] at [[Ardersier]] and [[Union Industrielle d'Entreprise]] at [[Cherbourg]], with the sections united at Ardersier before tow out during 1975, with production commencing in late 1976.
For safety reasons the modules were organised so that the most dangerous operations were distant from the personnel areas. The conversion from oil to gas broke this safety concept, with the result that sensitive areas were brought together; for example, the gas compression next to the control room, which played a role in the accident. It produced [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]] from 24 [[oil well|wells]] for delivery to the Flotta oil terminal on Orkney and to other installations by three separate [[pipeline transport|pipelines]]. At the time of the disaster, ''Piper'' was one of the heaviest platforms (along with [[Magnus oilfield|Magnus]] and [[Miller oilfield|Brae B]]) operating in the North Sea.

==Timeline of the incident==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2013}}
During the late 1970s, major works were carried out to enable the platform to meet UK Government gas export requirements and after this work had been completed, Piper Alpha was operating in what was known as phase 2 mode (operating with the Gas Conservation Module (GCM)) since the end of 1980 up until July 1988; phase 2 mode was its normal operating state. In the late 1980s, major construction, maintenance and upgrade works had been planned by Occidental and by July 1988, the rig was already well into major work activities, with six major projects identified including the change-out of the GCM unit which meant that the rig had been put back into its initial phase 1 mode (i.e. operating without a GCM unit). Despite the complex and demanding work schedule, Occidental made the decision to continue operating the platform in phase 1 mode throughout this period and not to shut it down, as had been originally planned. The planning and controls that were put in place were thought to be adequate. Therefore, Piper continued to export oil at just under 120,000 barrels per day and to export Tartan gas at some 33 MMSCFD (million standard cubic feet per day) during this demanding period.

Because the platform was completely destroyed, and many of those involved died, analysis of events can only suggest a possible chain of events based on known facts.  Some witnesses to the events question the official timeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/215866.stm|title=Piper Alpha pair 'wrongly blamed'|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''12:00 noon'''
Two [[Natural-gas condensate|condensate]] pumps, designated A and B, displaced the platform's condensate for transport to the coast. On the morning of 6 July, Pump A's pressure safety valve (PSV #504) was removed for routine maintenance. The pump's two-yearly overhaul was planned but had not started. The open condensate pipe was temporarily sealed with a disk cover (flat metal disc also called a ''blind [[flange]]'' or blank flange). Because the work could not be completed by 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., the disc cover remained in place. It was hand-tightened only. The on-duty engineer filled in a permit which stated that Pump A was not ready and must not be switched on under any circumstances.

'''6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.'''
The day shift ended, and the night shift started with 62 men running ''Piper Alpha''. As he found the on-duty custodian busy, the engineer neglected to inform him of the condition of Pump A. Instead he placed the permit in the control centre and left. This permit disappeared and was not found. Coincidentally there was another permit issued for the general overhaul of Pump A that had not yet begun.

'''7:00&amp;nbsp;p.m.'''
Like many other offshore platforms, ''Piper Alpha'' had an [[automatic fire suppression|automatic fire-fighting system]], driven by both diesel and electric pumps (the latter were disabled by the initial explosions). The diesel pumps were designed to suck in large amounts of sea water for fire fighting; the pumps had an automatic control to start them in case of fire (although they could not be remotely started from the control room in an emergency). However, the fire-fighting system was under manual control on the evening of 6 July: the ''Piper Alpha'' procedure adopted by the [[Offshore installation manager|Offshore Installation Manager]] (OIM) required manual control of the pumps whenever divers were in the water (as they were for approximately 12 hours a day during summer) although in reality, the risk was not seen as significant for divers unless a diver was closer than {{convert|10–15|ft|m|0}} from any of the four {{convert|120|ft|m|-1}} level caged intakes. A recommendation from an earlier audit had suggested that a procedure be developed to keep the pumps in automatic mode if divers were not working in the vicinity of the intakes as was the practice on the Claymore platform, but this was never developed or implemented.&lt;ref&gt;The Case for Safety: The North Sea Piper Alpha Disaster; NASA Safety Center, System Failure Case Study, May 2013 Volume 7 Issue 4, p3.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''9:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.'''
Because of problems with the methanol system earlier in the day, [[methane clathrate]] (a flammable ice) had started to accumulate in the gas compression system pipework, causing a blockage. Due to this blockage, condensate (natural gas liquids NGL) Pump B stopped and could not be restarted. As the entire power supply of the offshore construction work depended on this pump, the manager had only a few minutes to bring the pump back online, otherwise the power supply would fail completely. A search was made through the documents to determine whether Condensate Pump A could be started.

'''9:52&amp;nbsp;p.m.'''
The permit for the overhaul was found, but not the other permit stating that the pump must not be started under any circumstances due to the missing safety valve. The valve was in a different location from the pump and therefore the permits were stored in different boxes, as they were sorted by location. None of those present were aware that a vital part of the machine had been removed. The manager assumed from the existing documents that it would be safe to start Pump A. The missing valve was not noticed by anyone, particularly as the metal disc replacing the safety valve was several metres above ground level and obscured by machinery.

'''9:55&amp;nbsp;p.m. First Explosion'''
Condensate Pump A was switched on. Gas flowed into the pump, and because of the missing safety valve, produced an overpressure which the loosely fitted metal disc did not withstand.&lt;ref&gt;''leakage of condensate from a blind flange assembly at the site of a pressure safety valve'' CAPLAN volume 2 chapter 5 Causation 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Gas audibly leaked out at high pressure, drawing the attention of several men and triggering six gas alarms including the high level gas alarm. Before anyone could act, the gas ignited and exploded, blowing through the firewall made up of {{convert|2.5|by|1.5|m|ft|adj=on|0|abbr=on}} panels bolted together, which were not designed to withstand explosions. The custodian pressed the emergency stop button, closing huge valves in the sea lines and ceasing all oil and gas extraction.

Theoretically, the platform would then have been isolated from the flow of oil and gas and the fire contained. However, because the platform was originally built for oil, the firewalls were designed to resist fire rather than withstand explosions. The first explosion broke the firewall and dislodged panels around Module (B). One of the flying panels ruptured a small condensate pipe, creating another fire.

'''10:04&amp;nbsp;p.m.'''
The control room of ''Piper Alpha'' was abandoned. "[[Mayday]]" was signalled via radio by radio operator David Kinrade.  ''Piper Alpha's'' design made no allowances for the destruction of the control room, and the platform's organisation disintegrated. No attempt was made to use loudspeakers or to order an evacuation.

Emergency procedures instructed personnel to make their way to lifeboat stations, but the fire prevented them from doing so. Instead many of the men moved to the fireproofed accommodation block beneath the helicopter deck to await further instructions. Wind, fire and smoke prevented helicopter landings and no further instructions were given, with smoke beginning to seep into the personnel block.

As the crisis mounted, two men donned protective gear and attempted to reach the diesel pumping machinery below decks and activate the firefighting system. They were never seen again.

The fire would have burnt out were it not being fed with oil from both Tartan and the Claymore platforms, the resulting back pressure forcing fresh fuel out of ruptured pipework on Piper, directly into the heart of the fire. The Claymore platform continued pumping oil until the second explosion because the manager had no permission from the Occidental control centre to shut down. Also, the connecting gas pipeline to Tartan continued to pump, as its manager had been directed by his superior. The reason for this procedure was the huge cost of such a shut down. It would have taken several days to restart production after a stop, with substantial financial consequences.

Gas pipelines of both {{convert|16|inch|cm|adj=on|abbr=on}} and {{convert|18|inch|cm|adj=on|abbr=on}} diameter ran to ''Piper Alpha''. Two years earlier Occidental management ordered a study, the results of which warned of the dangers of these gas lines.  Because of their length and diameter, it would have taken several hours to reduce their pressure, which meant fighting a fire fuelled by them would have been all but impossible. Although the management admitted how devastating a gas explosion would be, Claymore and Tartan were not switched off with the first emergency call.

'''10:05&amp;nbsp;p.m.'''
The Search and Rescue station at [[RAF Lossiemouth]] receives the first call notifying them of the possibility of an emergency, and a [[No. 202 Squadron RAF|No. 202 Sqn]] [[Westland Sea King|Sea King]] helicopter, "Rescue 138", takes off at the request of the [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|Coastguard]] station at Aberdeen. The station at [[RAF Boulmer]] is also notified, and a [[Hawker Siddeley Nimrod]] from [[RAF Kinloss]] is sent to the area to act as "On-Scene Commander" and "Rescue Zero-One".

'''10:20&amp;nbsp;p.m. Tartan Gas Line Rupture'''
Tartan's gas line (pressurised to 120 Atmospheres) melted and ruptured, releasing 15-30 tonnes of high pressure gas every second, which immediately ignited. From that moment on, the platform's destruction was assured.

'''10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.'''
The ''[[Tharos]]'', a large [[semi-submersible]] fire fighting, rescue and accommodation vessel, drew alongside ''Piper Alpha''. The ''Tharos'' used its water cannon where it could, but it was restricted, because the cannon was so powerful it would injure or kill anyone hit by the water.

'''10:50&amp;nbsp;p.m. MCP-01 Gas Line Rupture'''
The second gas line ruptured (the riser for the MCP-01 platform), ejecting millions of cubic feet of gas into the conflagration and increased its intensity. Huge flames shot over {{convert|300|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} in the air. The ''Tharos'' was driven off by the fearsome heat, which began to melt the surrounding machinery and steelwork. It was only after this explosion that the Claymore platform stopped pumping oil.  Personnel still left alive were either desperately sheltering in the scorched, smoke-filled accommodation block or leaping from the various deck levels, including the [[helideck]], {{convert|175|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} into the North Sea. The explosion also killed two crewmen on a fast rescue boat launched from the standby vessel ''Sandhaven'' and the six ''Piper Alpha'' crewmen they had rescued from the water.&lt;ref name="nightseacaughtfire" /&gt;

'''11:18&amp;nbsp;p.m. Claymore Gas Line Rupture'''
The gas pipeline connecting ''Piper Alpha'' to the Claymore Platform ruptured, adding even more fuel to the already massive firestorm that engulfed Piper Alpha.

'''11:35&amp;nbsp;p.m.'''
Helicopter "Rescue 138" from Lossiemouth arrives at the scene.

'''11:37&amp;nbsp;p.m.'''
''Tharos'' contacts Nimrod "Rescue Zero-One" to apprise him of the situation. A standby vessel has picked up 25 casualties, including three with serious burns, and one with an injury. ''Tharos'' requests the evacuation of its non-essential personnel to make room for incoming casualties. "Rescue 138" is requested to evacuate 12 non-essential personnel from ''Tharos'' to transfer to ''Ocean Victory'', before returning with paramedics.

'''11:50&amp;nbsp;p.m.'''
With critical support structures burned away, and with nothing to support the heavier structures on top, the platform began to collapse. One of the cranes collapsed, followed by the drilling derrick. The generation and utilities Module (D), which included the fireproofed accommodation block, slipped into the sea, taking the crewmen huddled inside with it. The largest part of the platform followed it. "Rescue 138" lands on ''Tharos '' and picks up the 12 non-essential personnel, before leaving for ''Ocean Victory''.

'''11:55&amp;nbsp;p.m.'''
"Rescue 138" arrives at ''Ocean Victory'' and lands the 12 passengers before returning to ''Tharos'' with 4 of ''Ocean Victory'''s paramedics.

'''00:07&amp;nbsp;a.m., 7 July'''
"Rescue 138" lands paramedics on ''Ocean Victory''.

'''00:45&amp;nbsp;a.m.
The entire platform had gone. Module (A) was all that remained of ''Piper Alpha''.

'''00:48&amp;nbsp;a.m.
"Rescue 138" lands on ''Tharos'' with three casualties picked up from MV ''Silver Pit''.

'''00:58&amp;nbsp;a.m.

"Rescue 138" lands on ''Tharos'' with the bodies of two fatalities. "Rescue 138" then leaves to refuel on the drilling rig ''Santa Fe 140''.

'''05:15&amp;nbsp;a.m.
"Rescue 137" arrives at ''Tharos'' and after landing, then leaves taking casualties to Aberdeen.

'''06:21&amp;nbsp;a.m.
Uninjured survivors of ''Piper Alpha'' leave ''Tharos'' by civilian S-61 helicopter for Aberdeen.

'''07:25&amp;nbsp;a.m.
"Rescue 138" picks up remaining survivors from ''Tharos'' for transfer to Aberdeen.

At the time of the disaster 226 people were on the platform; 165 died and 61 survived.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Energy, The Public Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster (The Hon Lord Cullen), Vol 2, Appendix H, p463.&lt;/ref&gt; Two men from the Standby Vessel ''Sandhaven'' were also killed.

==Aftermath==
There is controversy about whether there was sufficient time for more effective [[emergency evacuation]]. The main problem was that most of the personnel who had the authority to order evacuation had been killed when the first explosion destroyed the control room. This was a consequence of the platform design, which did not include blast walls. Another contributing factor was that the nearby connected platforms Tartan and Claymore continued to pump gas and oil to ''Piper Alpha'' until its pipeline ruptured in the heat in the second explosion. Their operations crews did not believe they had authority to shut off production, even though they could see that ''Piper Alpha'' was burning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.versatel.nl/the_sims/rig/pipera.htm|title=Persoonlijke webpagina|publisher=Versatel &amp; Zonnet - Tele2|accessdate=3 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161020164827/http://home.versatel.nl/the_sims/rig/pipera.htm|archivedate=20 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nearby diving support vessel ''Lowland Cavalier'' reported the initial explosion just before 10:00 pm, and the second explosion occurred twenty two minutes later.  By the time civil and military rescue helicopters reached the scene, flames over 100 metres in height and visible as far away as 100&amp;nbsp;km (120&amp;nbsp;km  from the ''Maersk Highlander'') away prevented safe approach. The largest number of survivors (37 out of 59) were recovered by the Fast Rescue Boat of the Standby Safety Vessel, MV ''Silver Pit''; coxswain James Clark later received the [[George Medal]]. Others awarded the George Medal were Charles Haffey from Methil [http://www.fifetoday.co.uk/news/local-headlines/piper-alpha-remembered-25-years-on-1-2986031], Andrew Kiloh from Aberdeen, and James McNeill from Oban [http://news.stv.tv/north/231236-piper-alpha-rescuer-relives-going-through-flames-to-rescue-workers/][http://www.brighthubengineering.com/marine-history/116049-piper-alpha-oil-rig-disaster/].

The blazing remains of the platform were eventually extinguished three weeks later by a team led by firefighter [[Red Adair]], despite reported conditions of {{convert|80|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} winds and {{convert|70|ft|m|-1|sing=on}} waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2281867.stm|title=Obituary: Red Adair|publisher=BBC NEWS |accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The part of the platform which contained the galley where about 100 victims had taken refuge was recovered in late 1988 from the sea bed, and the bodies of 87 men were found inside.&lt;ref name="nightseacaughtfire" /&gt;

As they rise up the window the colour lightens as the souls rise to Heaven]]

The Cullen Inquiry was set up in November 1988 to establish the cause of the disaster. It was chaired by the Scottish judge [[William Cullen, Baron Cullen of Whitekirk|William Cullen]]. After 180 days of proceedings,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Piper Alpha Public Inquiry: Records|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/SearchUI/details/C7084-piper-alpha-public-inquiry-records-details|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it released its report ''Public Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster'' (short: ''Cullen Report'') in November 1990.&lt;ref name=CullenReport&gt;{{cite book|last=Cullen|first=The Hon. Lord William Douglas|title=The Public Inquiry into the Piper Alpha Disaster, Presented to Parliament by the Secretary of State for Energy by Command of Her Majesty|date=November 1990|publisher=H.M.

The inquiry was critical of ''Piper Alpha's'' operator, Occidental, which was found guilty of having inadequate maintenance and safety procedures, but no criminal charges were ever brought against the company.&lt;ref name="nightseacaughtfire" /&gt;

The second part of the report made 106 recommendations for changes to North Sea safety procedures:
*37 recommendations covered procedures for operating equipment, 32 the information of platform personnel, 25 the design of platforms and 12 the information of emergency services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parthenon.uk.com/disaster-piper-alpha-fire.htm|title=Learning From Major Disasters - Piper Alpha Oil and Gas Platform Explosion and Fire|publisher=Parthenon Press|accessdate=3 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318145904/http://www.parthenon.uk.com/disaster-piper-alpha-fire.htm|archivedate=18 March 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The responsibility to implement was for 57 with the regulator, 40 for the operators, 8 for the industry as a whole and 1 for stand-by ship owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/cmsfiles/modules/publications/pdfs/HS048.pdf|title=Piper Alpha: Lessons Learnt, 2008|publisher=Oil and Gas UK Magazine|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004232924/http://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/cmsfiles/modules/publications/pdfs/HS048.pdf|archivedate=4 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most significant of these recommendations was that operators were required to present a [[safety case]] and that the responsibility for enforcing safety in the North Sea should be moved from the [[Department of Energy (United Kingdom)|Department of Energy]] to the [[Health and Safety Executive]], as having both production and safety overseen by the same agency was a conflict of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.newscientist.com/article/mg12817431.100-piper-alpha-rewrites-the-rules-on-offshore-safety-.html|title=''Piper Alpha'' rewrites the rules on offshore safety|publisher=[[New Scientist]]|accessdate=3 February 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027124017/http://media.newscientist.com/article/mg12817431.100-piper-alpha-rewrites-the-rules-on-offshore-safety-.html|archivedate=27 October 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disaster led to insurance claims of around $1.4 billion USD, making it at that time the largest insured man-made catastrophe. The insurance and reinsurance claims process revealed serious weaknesses in the way insurers at [[Lloyd's of London]] and elsewhere kept track of their potential exposures, and led to their procedures being reformed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lloyds.com/News-and-Insight/News-and-Features/Archive/2008/07/Twenty_years_on_Piper_Alphas_legacy_23072008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140815012909/https://www.lloyds.com/News-and-Insight/News-and-Features/Archive/2008/07/Twenty_years_on_Piper_Alphas_legacy_23072008 |title=Twenty years on - Piper Alpha’s legacy |date=July 2008 |archive-date=15 August 2014 |publisher=Lloyd's |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Survivors and relatives of those who died went on to form the ''Piper Alpha'' Families and Survivors Association, which campaigns on North Sea safety issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/north_east/7483428.stm|title=Widows hope deaths not in vain|publisher=BBC News |access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wreck buoy marking the remains of the Piper is approximately 1.1 nautical miles from the replacement [[Piper Bravo]] platform. A lasting effect of the ''Piper Alpha'' disaster was the establishment of Britain's first "post-[[Margaret Thatcher]]" trade union, the [[Offshore Industry Liaison Committee]].

A memorial sculpture, showing three oil workers, was erected in the Rose Garden within Hazlehead Park in Aberdeen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article4282147.ece |title=Login|publisher=The Times |access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The figures represent on the west the physical nature of offshore trades, the east  youth and eternal movement and the north holds an unwinding spiral that represents oil in the left hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/the-scotsman/scotland/stephen-mcginty-true-cost-of-a-nation-s-wealth-1-2333749|title=Stephen McGinty: True cost of a nation’s wealth |publisher=[[The Scotsman]] |accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculptor is [[Sue Jane Taylor]], the Scottish artist who had visited the Piper platform the previous year, and based much of her work around what she saw in and around the oil industry. One of the survivors was used as a model for one of the figures. In 1991, Scottish composer [[James MacMillan (composer)|James MacMillan]] wrote "Tuireadh", a piece for clarinet and string orchestra, as a musical complement to the memorial sculpture. In 2008, to mark the 20th anniversary of the disaster, a stage play, ''Lest We Forget'' was commissioned by [[Aberdeen Performing Arts]] and written by playwright Mike Gibb. It was performed in Aberdeen in the week leading up to the anniversary with the final performance on 6 July 2008, twenty years to the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hamepages.com/theatre_works_lest_we_forget.html|title=コンビニのキャッシングと便利な活用方法|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905055203/http://www.hamepages.com/theatre_works_lest_we_forget.html|archive-date=5 September 2017|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1998, one month after the tenth anniversary, Professor David Alexander, director of the Aberdeen Centre for Trauma Research at [[Robert Gordon University]] carried out a study into the long-term psychological and social effects of Piper Alpha. He managed to find thirty-six survivors who agreed to give interviews or complete questionnaires. Almost all of this group reported psychological problems. More than 70% of those interviewed reported psychological and behavioural symptoms of [[post traumatic stress disorder]]. Twenty-eight said they had difficulty in finding employment following the disaster; it appears that some offshore employers regarded Piper Alpha survivors as Jonahs – bringers of bad luck, who would not be welcome on other rigs and platforms. The family members of the dead and surviving victims also reported various psychological and social problems. Alexander also wrote that "some of these lads are stronger than before Piper. They've learned things about themselves, changed their values, some relationships became stronger. People realised they have strengths they didn't know they had. There was a lot of heroism took place."&lt;ref name="nightseacaughtfire" /&gt;

In 2013, on the 25th anniversary of the disaster, the video ''Remembering Piper - The Night That Changed Our Lives'' was released by Step Change in Safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joinedup-thinking.co.uk/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130306042854/http://www.joinedup-thinking.co.uk/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 March 2013 |title=Remembering Piper |publisher=joinedup-thinking.co.uk/ |accessdate=6 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-day conference was held in Aberdeen to reflect on lessons learned from Piper Alpha and industry safety issues in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-north-east-orkney-shetland-22942306|title=Piper Alpha: Aberdeen offshore conference teaching disaster lessons|first=Kevin|last=Keane|date=18 June 2013|publisher=|accessdate=3 February 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/events/Piper25.cfm Piper 25] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130708235623/http://www.oilandgasuk.co.uk/events/Piper25.cfm |date=8 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==

The incident was featured in the 1990 [[Scottish Television|STV]] documentary television series ''[[Rescue (UK TV series)|Rescue]]'', about the [[RAF Search and Rescue Force]] at [[RAF Lossiemouth]], in the episode "Piper Alpha". Coincidently, the film crew had been documenting the rescue teams at Lossiemouth at the time of the ''Piper Alpha'' accident.

On 6 July 2008, BBC Radio 3 broadcast a 90-minute Drama on Three entitled ''Piper Alpha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00cdbpc|title=Piper Alpha, Drama on 3 - BBC Radio 3|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on the actual evidence given to the Cullen Inquiry the events of that night were retold twenty years to the minute after they happened.

[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] featured this incident in an episode of its [[Seconds From Disaster#Episodes|''Seconds From Disaster'']] documentary. The 2013 documentary film ''[[Fire in the Night]]'' is about the disaster.

In 2018, the disaster was featured on ''James Nesbitt's Disasters That Changed Britain''. Testimonials were heard from survivors and relatives of victims.

'''''Polybius''''' is a fictitious&lt;!--The game has been proven by articles and documentaries to be a fictitious game--&gt; [[arcade game]], the subject of an [[urban legend]] that supposedly first emerged in early 2000.&lt;ref name="skeptoid"&gt;{{Skeptoid|id=4362|number=362|title=Polybius: Video Game of Death|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="documentary" /&gt; It has served as inspiration for several free and commercial games by the same name.

The real game allegedly was part of a government-run psychology experiment based in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Gameplay supposedly produced intense [[psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] and addictive effects in the player. These few publicly staged arcade machines were said to have been visited periodically by [[men in black]] for the purpose of data-mining the machines and analyzing these effects. Eventually, all of these ''Polybius'' arcade machines allegedly disappeared from the arcade market.

''Polybius'' is also the name of the Greek historian, [[Polybius]],&lt;ref name="skeptoid" /&gt; who was known for his assertion that historians should never report what they cannot verify through interviews with witnesses.

An entry for the title was added to arcade game resource [http://www.coinop.org/ coinop.org] on February 6, 2000.&lt;ref name="documentary"&gt;{{cite AV media | people=Stuart Brown | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7X6Yeydgyg | date=September 8, 2017 | title= POLYBIUS - The Video Game That Doesn't Exist | medium=Documentary | publisher=[[YouTube]] | access-date=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Although Coinop lists the page as originating in 1998, it appears to have defaulted to that time without any known creation time existing in the database.&lt;/ref&gt; The entry mentions the name ''Polybius'' and a copyright date of 1981,&lt;ref name="clickto"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.clickto.com/coinop/GamePage/Polybius.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000303224844/http://www.clickto.com/coinop/GamePage/Polybius.html | archivedate=March 3, 2000 |title=Polybius at The Clickto Network | publisher=Clickto | accessdate=October 13, 2014 | author=coinop.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; although no such copyright has ever been registered.&lt;ref name="United States Copyright Office Public Catalog"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=polybius&amp;Search_Code=TALL&amp;PID=_ATy2OT-fDwOzxOnhAKAj77aTwqT&amp;SEQ=20170508165147&amp;CNT=25&amp;HIST=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170508205337/http://cocatalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?Search_Arg=polybius&amp;Search_Code=TALL&amp;PID=_ATy2OT-fDwOzxOnhAKAj77aTwqT&amp;SEQ=20170508165147&amp;CNT=25&amp;HIST=1 | archivedate=May 8, 2017 |title=Search Request: polybius}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author of the entry claims in the description to be in possession of a [[ROM image]] of the game, and to have extracted fragments of text from it, including "1981 Sinneslöschen".&lt;ref name="clickto" /&gt; The remainder of the information about the game is listed as "unknown",&lt;ref name="skeptoid" /&gt; and its "About the game" section describes the "bizarre rumors" that make up the legend.&lt;ref name="clickto" /&gt;

The story tells of an unheard-of new arcade game appearing in several suburbs of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], Oregon in 1981, something of a rarity at the time. The game is described as proving popular to the point of [[Behavioral addiction|addiction]],&lt;ref name="skeptoid" /&gt; with lines forming around the machines often resulting in fighting over who would play next. The urban legend describes how the machines were visited by [[men in black]], who collected unknown data from the machines,&lt;ref name="skeptoid" /&gt; allegedly testing responses to the game's [[psychoactive]] effects. Players supposedly suffered from a series of unpleasant side effects, including [[amnesia]], [[insomnia]], [[night terrors]] and [[hallucination]]s.&lt;ref name="silverman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videogames.yahoo.com/feature/video-game-myths-fact-or-fiction-/1182040-2|title=Video Game Myths: Fact or Fiction? – Video Game Feature|last=Silverman|first=Ben|date=January 25, 2008|publisher=Yahoo!

The company named in most accounts of the game is ''Sinneslöschen''.&lt;ref name="skeptoid" /&gt; The word is described by writer [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] as "not-quite-idiomatic German" meaning "sense delete" or "sensory deprivation".  These meanings are derived from ''[[wikt:Sinn#German|Sinne]]'', "senses" and ''[[wikt:löschen#German|löschen]]'', "to extinguish" or "to delete".&lt;ref name="skeptoid" /&gt;

Some time prior to September 2003, Kurt Koller, the owner of coinop.org, submitted a tip-off to the video game magazine ''[[GamePro]]'' about ''Polybius''.&lt;ref name="documentary"/&gt; ''Polybius'' then appeared in the September 2003 issue of ''GamePro'', as part of a feature story on video games called "Secrets and Lies." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elektro|first=D.|date=September 2003|title=Secrets and Lies|type=magazine|page=41|work=[[GamePro]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was noteworthy, as it was the first known printed mention of the game, exposing the legend to a mass-market audience.&lt;ref name="skeptoid" /&gt; The article declared the existence of the game to be "inconclusive," &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/30667.shtml|title=Secrets &amp; Lies (page 2) Feature|publisher=GamePro.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202180456/http://www.gamepro.com/gamepro/domestic/games/features/30667.shtml|archivedate=December 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping to both spark curiosity and spread the story.

Following the appearance in ''GamePro'' magazine, a number of individuals came forward claiming to have some involvement with ''Polybius.''&lt;ref name="documentary" /&gt; In 2006, a man named Steven Roach claimed he had been one of the original programmers and that his company developed a game with very intense and cutting-edge graphics.&lt;ref name="clickto" /&gt; However, according to Roach, a boy experienced an epileptic seizure while playing, and the cabinets were withdrawn by the company in a panic.&lt;ref name="clickto" /&gt; Although Roach offered no proof for his claims, his story added details on the gameplay, which later inspired Rogue Synapse's game based on the legend.&lt;ref name="documentary" /&gt;

==Analysis==
[[File:EFOIA Request.png|thumb|right|[[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|E-FOIA]] request for ''Polybius'', which came back with no results.]]
The original game's existence has never been authoritatively proven.&lt;ref name="skeptoid" /&gt; [[Snopes.com]] claims to have debunked the existence of the game as a modern-day version of 1980s rumors of "[[men in black]]" visiting arcades and taking down the names of high scorers at arcade games. This led to the hypothesis that the government was hosting some sort of experiment and sending [[subliminal message]]s to the players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/inboxer/hoaxes/roundup.asp|title=Urban Legends Reference Pages: Hoax Round-Up|date=November 29, 2007|work=[[Snopes.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magazines of the time period dedicated to electronic gaming make no mention of a ''Polybius'', and mainstream news also fails to note such a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2017/6/17/15825030/polybius-rom-download-cia-reader-exhibits-antisocial-pattern-bulletin-terminate-orders-immediate-out|title=Was Polybius real?|last=Good|first=Owen S.|date=2017-06-17|website=Polygon|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a number of mockup cabinets and games inspired by the myth do exist, no authentic cabinets or [[ROM image|ROM]] dumps have ever been located.&lt;ref name="documentary" /&gt; Ben Silverman of [[Yahoo! Games]] remarked: "Unfortunately, there is no evidence that the game ever existed, no less turned its users into babbling lunatics ... Still, ''Polybius'' has enjoyed cult-like status as a throwback to a more technologically paranoid era."&lt;ref name="silverman" /&gt;

Skeptics and researchers have differing ideas on how and why the story of ''Polybius'' came about. American producer and author [[Brian Dunning (author)|Brian Dunning]] believes ''Polybius'' to be an [[urban legend]] that grew out of a mixture of influences in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="skeptoid" /&gt; He notes that two players fell ill in Portland on the same day in 1981, one collapsing with a [[migraine]] headache after playing ''[[Tempest (arcade game)|Tempest]]'',&lt;ref name="skeptoid" /&gt; and another suffering from stomach pain after playing ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]'' for 28 hours in a filmed attempt to break a world record at the same arcade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19811129&amp;id=arRQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=V-IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6688,7639998|title=Eugene Register-Guard – Google News Archive oSearch|publisher=|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunning records that the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] raided several video arcades in the area just ten days later, where the owners were suspected of using the machines for gambling, and the lead-up to the raid involved FBI agents monitoring arcade cabinets for signs of tampering and recording high scores. Dunning suggests that these two events were combined in an urban legend about government-monitored arcade machines making players ill. He believes that such a myth must have been established by 1984, and that it influenced the plot of the film ''[[The Last Starfighter]]'', in which a teenager is recruited by aliens who monitored him playing a covertly-developed arcade game.&lt;ref name="skeptoid" /&gt; Dunning considers "Sinneslöschen" to be the kind of name that a non-German speaker would generate if they tried to create a compound word using an English-to-German dictionary.&lt;ref name="skeptoid" /&gt;

The game ''[[Cube Quest]]'', released in arcades in 1983, is a shooting game with surreal visuals which played from a [[laserdisc]]; as such its visuals were far ahead of typical games of the time, and it would be frequently visited for maintenance (because of frequent breakdowns of laserdisc players in arcade games) and often removed from arcades after a short time for the same reason. Many commentators believe that players claiming to remember having played or seen ''Polybius'' may actually be recalling ''Cube Quest''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patrickkellogg.com/hobbies/polybius.htm|title=Patrick Kellogg - Polybius|accessdate=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some skeptics believe that the ''Polybius'' myth has a far more recent origin. British filmmaker and video game journalist Stuart Brown, after his investigation of the legend's origin, did not find any evidence of the ''Polybius'' myth existing until the year 2000.&lt;ref name="documentary" /&gt; He concluded that ''Polybius'' was an intentional hoax made by Kurt Koller, owner of coinop.org, in order to drive traffic to his website. The hoax capitalized on the popularity of conspiracy theories and the highly viral nature of other recent Internet hoaxes. In Brown's view, the reasons for a 1980s origin are simply retroactive justifications of the hoax's existence which served as inspiration to Koller to craft his tale.&lt;ref name="documentary" /&gt;  He also theorized that people remembering seeing something about it on Usenet in 1994 were misremembering articles on [[Publius Enigma]]. Brown also noticed striking similarities between the logo of Polybius, provided by the image on coinop.org in 2000, and other [[Arcade game#Arcade video games|arcade video games]] like [[Bubbles (video game)|Bubbles]] and [[Robotron: 2084]]. He concluded that the bottom text is similar to that of Robotron: 2084, and the font in which the logo is made in is almost identical to that of Bubbles, with only the O different and the H flipped. He later stated that this could be a copycat fan of [[Williams Electronics]] as both Bubbles and Robotron: 2084 were made by them and that both were released a year later than when Polybius was said to first appear.&lt;ref name="documentary"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Though the original has never been authoritatively located, several video games have been published using the name ''Polybius'', drawing upon the urban legend as inspiration. The claims made in the urban legend of psychoactive or subliminal effects do not apply to these games.

=== Polybius for PC (2007) ===

In 2007, PC [[freeware]] developers and arcade constructors Rogue Synapse registered the domain &lt;code&gt;sinnesloschen.com&lt;/code&gt; and offered a free downloadable game titled ''Polybius'' for PC. The game's design is partly based on a contested description of the ''Polybius'' arcade machine posted on a forum by an individual named Steven Roach who had claimed to have worked on the original.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://serious.gameclassification.com/EN/games/43494-Polybius/index.html |title=Serious Game Classification : Polybius (1981) |accessdate=May 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rogue Synapse's ''Polybius'' is a 2D shooter resembling ''[[Star Castle]]'' with extremely intense graphical effects. It also exactly duplicates the distinctive title screen and font referred to in the urban legend, and is compatible with PCs mounted inside arcade cabinets. As a result, fans were able to create "playable ''Polybius'' arcade machines" using this version, which fueled the popularity of the urban legend. Most people claiming to have found the "lost Polybius arcade machine" are referring to this game.

To complete the illusion, Rogue Synapse's owner Dr. Estil Vance founded a Texas-based corporation bearing the name ''Sinnesloschen'' (without accents) in 2007.&lt;ref name="Taxable Entity Search - Texas Comptroller"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://mycpa.cpa.state.tx.us/coa/|title=Taxable Entity Search}}&lt;/ref&gt; He transferred to it the "Rogue Synapse" trademark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://trademarks.justia.com/765/64/rogue-76564186.html|title=Justia Trademarks}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a newly registered trademark on "Polybius".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tmsearch.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=4803:iytlyw.2.1 |title=USPTO Trademark Search}}{{better source|date=September 2018|reason=This web page is now only a session expired message}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author does not make any claim that his version of ''Polybius'' is the authentic original, stating clearly on its page that it is an "attempt to recreate the ''Polybius'' game as it might have existed in 1981".&lt;ref name="attempt"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sinnesloschen.com/1.php | title=What is Your Pleasure Sir | accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polybius for Atari 2600 (2013) ===

Chris Trimiew, owner of Lost Classics, is the author of a [[Atari 2600 homebrew|homebrew]] [[Atari 2600]] game named ''Polybius''. Gameplay is not claimed to be based on the original game, and the author expressed doubt that the Atari 2600 hardware would be able to emulate anything close to the claimed original arcade game. It is a simple crosshair-based shooting game resembling ''[[Star Raiders]]'', except that occasionally the screen flashes [[subliminal messages]] such as "DEATH", "PAIN", and "SUFFER".&lt;ref name="polybius2600"&gt;{{cite av media | via=YouTube | author=Lost Classics | date=Dec 3, 2013 | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RRyotVTwmy0 | title=Polybius Atari 2600 | accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He marketed the game on October 5, 2013 at the Portland Retro Gaming Expo, as a limited run of 30 cartridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=October 20, 2013|first=Pete |last=Cottell |title=Pac From the Grave: 128 bytes and 35 years later, people are still making new games for the Atari 2600 |publisher= Willamette Week |url=http://www.wweek.com/portland/article-21212-pac_from_the_grave.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polybius for PlayStation 4 (2017) ===

{{main|Polybius (2017 video game)}}

In 2016, [[Llamasoft]] announced a game called ''Polybius'' for the [[PlayStation 4]] with support for the [[PlayStation VR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/a-video-game-called-polybius-is-actually-coming-out-will-it-kill-you/|title=A video game called Polybius is actually coming out.

=== In popular culture ===
''Polybius'' machines have appeared in the background of arcade scenes on television shows and in other media. In the 2006 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', titled "[[Please Homer, Don't Hammer 'Em]]", a ''Polybius'' cabinet appears in an arcade full of outdated arcade machines from the 1970s and 1980s, bearing a single button and printed with the words "property of US Government". The game also appears in the background of two episodes of the 2014 television show ''[[The Goldbergs (2013 TV series)|The Goldbergs]]'' and a poster advertising the game is present in the local theater, in the comic ''[[Batman Inc.]]'' No. 1 (2012), on a T-shirt in Vertigo's 2008 ''[[House of Mystery (Vertigo)|House of Mystery]]'' series, and as the central theme in the fourth episode of season one of the sci-fi series ''[[Dimension 404]]'' (2017). A ''Polybius'' arcade cabinet (with an Out of Order sign) can be seen in the background of a video arcade in the 2018 Canadian horror mystery film ''[[Summer of 84]]''.

The ''Polybius'' legend is an integral part of the plot{{clarify|date=August 2016}} of ''Doomsday Arcade'', a video series hosted by ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|Escapist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/videos/view/doomsday-arcade/492-Episode-One|title=Episode One – Doomsday Arcade Video Gallery – The Escapist|work=The Escapist|accessdate=October 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used as part of the plot setup in ''[[Armada (novel)|Armada: A Novel]]'' by [[Ernest Cline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therobotsvoice.com/2015/07/armada_ernest_cline_ready_player_one_wing_commande.php|title=8 Reasons Ernest Cline's Armada Is Nothing Like Ready Player One (and Why That's Not a Bad Thing) – The Robot's Voice|date=July 24, 2015|work=therobotsvoice.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation and promulgation of the Polybius myth were explored in the [[Radiotopia]] podcast ''The Polybius Conspiracy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.radiotopia.fm/showcase/the-polybius-conspiracy/|title=The Polybius Conspiracy|website=Radiotopia|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; which originally aired in 2017. The story blends facts from the period with fictional characters and storylines.

The music video for the song "[[Less Than (song)|Less Than]]", by [[Nine Inch Nails]], features a videogame named Polybius.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDV-dOvqKzQ&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was the subject of episodes of ''[[Game Theory (series)|Game Theory]]'' in 2012&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDXSr8jjpVk&lt;/ref&gt; and was the focus of a Halloween-themed episode of ''[[Angry Video Game Nerd]]'' in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4hktqhBpzY&lt;/ref&gt; It will also be the subject of a feature film by YouTuber [[Stuart Ashen]], labelled "Ashens and the Polybius Heist", to be released in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/ashens-and-the-polybius-heist-youtube#/|title=Ashens and the Polybius Heist|website=Indiegogo|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An arcade machine of the game can be seen in season 4, episode 29 of the cartoon series [[Bravest Warriors]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="49246">{{Rape}}
'''Rape in the United States''' is defined by the Department of Justice as "Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." While definitions and terminology of [[rape]] vary by jurisdiction in the [[United States]], the [[FBI]] revised its definition to eliminate a requirement that the crime involve an element of force.&lt;ref name="FBI FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about the Change in the UCR Definition of Rape|url=https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/recent-program-updates/new-rape-definition-frequently-asked-questions|publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=22 March 2015|date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 study found that rape may be grossly underreported in the United States.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2013"&gt;National Research Council. ''Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault.'' Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a 2014 study suggested that police departments may eliminate or undercount rapes from official records in part to "create the illusion of success in fighting violent crime".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Yung, C. R. (2014). How to Lie with Rape Statistics: America's Hidden Rape Crisis. Iowa Law Review, 99(1197).&lt;/ref&gt; For the last reported year, 2013, the [[prevalence rate]] for all sexual assaults including rape was 0.1% (prevalence represents the number of victims, rather than the number of assaults since some are victimized more than once during the reporting period).  The survey included males and females aged 12+.&lt;ref name="BJS 2014 Prevalence"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langton|first1=Lynn|last2=Truman|first2=Jennifer L.|title=Criminal Victimization, 2013|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=5111|accessdate=26 March 2015|page=5|date=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since rapes are a subset of all sexual assaults, the prevalence of rape is lower than the combined statistic.&lt;ref name = "BJS"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langton|first1=Lynn|last2=Sinozich|first2=Sofi|title=Rape and Sexual Assault Victimization Among College-Age Females, 1995–2013|url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rsavcaf9513.pdf|publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics|accessdate=21 December 2014|date=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those assaults, the [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] stated that 34.8% were reported to the police, up from 29.3% in 2004.&lt;ref name = "BJS 2014 Reported Rate"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langton|first1=Lynn|last2=Truman|first2=Jennifer L.|title=Criminal Victimization, 2013|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=5111|accessdate=26 March 2015|page=7|date=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definitions ==
{{Further|Sexuality in the United States}}
In the United States, at the Federal level, the FBI's Uniform Crime Report (UCR) definitions are used when collating national crime statistics from states across the US. The UCR's definition of rape was changed on January 1, 2013 to remove the requirement of force against a female and to include a wider range of types of penetration.&lt;ref name="FBI FAQ"/&gt; The new definition reads:

{{quote|Penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim.}}

For 80 years prior to the 2013 change, the UCR's definition  of rape was "carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will".&lt;ref name=legacy&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2013/crime-in-the-u.s.-2013/rape-addendum/rape_addendum_final|title=Rape Addendum|author=|date=|website=fbi.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the state level, there is no uniform legal definition of rape ; instead, each state has their own laws. These definitions can vary considerably, but many of them do not use the term ''rape'' anymore, instead using ''sexual assault'', ''criminal sexual conduct'', ''sexual abuse'', ''sexual battery'', etc.

One legal definition, which is used by the United States Armed Forces is found in the United States [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]] [Title 10, Subtitle A, Chapter 47X, Section 920, Article 120], defines rape as:

{{quote|(a) Rape. — Any person subject to this chapter who commits a sexual act upon another person by —  
(1) using unlawful force against that other person;

(2) using force causing or likely to cause death or grievous bodily harm to any person;

(3) threatening or placing that other person in fear that any person will be subjected to death, grievous bodily harm, or kidnapping;

=== Prevalence and number of incidents ===
Rape prevalence among women in the U.S. (the percentage of women who experienced rape at least once in their lifetime so far) is in the range of 15–20% according to different studies (National Violence against Women survey, 1995, found 17.6% prevalence rate;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Tjaden|first1=Patricia|last2=Thoennes|first2=Nancy|date=November 1998|title=Prevalence, Incidence, and Consequences of Violence against Women: Findings from the National Violence against Women Survey.

According to a March 2013 report from the U.S. Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice Statistics, from 1995 to 2010, the estimated annual rate of female rape or sexual assault declined 58%, from 5.0 victimizations per 1,000 females age 12 or older to 2.1 per 1,000. Assaults on young women aged 12–17 declined from 11.3 per 1,000 in 1994-1998 to 4.1 per 1,000 in 2005-2010; assaults on women aged 18–34 also declined over the same period, from 7.0 per 1,000 to 3.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/female-victims-sexual-violence-1994-2010 | title=Female Victims of Sexual Violence, 1994-2010 |website=JournalistsResource.org |access-date=March 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Berzofsky | first1 = Marcus  | last2 = Krebs | first2 = Christopher  | last3 =Langton | first3 =  Lynn | last4 =Planty | first4 =Michael | last5 = Smiley-McDonald | first5 = Hope | date =March 7, 2013   | title =Female Victims of Sexual Violence, 1994-2010 | journal = Bureau of Justice Statistics | url = http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=4594}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 Uniform Crime Report (UCR), which measures rapes that are known to police, estimated that there were 90,185 rapes reported to law enforcement in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=2015 |title=Uniform Crime Report: Crime in the United States, 2015 |url=https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/rape |publisher=Federal Bureau of Investigation |access-date=2017-10-09 |quote="There were an estimated 90,185 rapes (legacy definition) reported to law enforcement in 2015." }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), which measures sexual assaults and rapes that may not have been reported to the police, found that there were 431,840 incidents of rape or sexual assault in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Truman |first1=Jennifer L. |last2=Morgan |first2=Rachel E. |date=October 2015 |title=Criminal Victimization, 2015 |url=https://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=5804 |publisher=Bureau of Justice Statistics |page=2 |access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other government surveys, such as the Sexual Victimization of College Women study, critique the NCVS on the basis it includes only those acts perceived as crimes by the victim, and report a much higher victimization rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/182369.pdf|title=Sexual Victimization of College Women|last=Fischer|first=Bonnie S.|last2=Cullen|first2=Francis T.|date=December 2000|website=NCJRS.gov|access-date=2018-06-22|last3=Turner|first3=Michael G.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates from other sources typically report much higher levels of both rape and sexual assault than either the NCVS or UCR. A 2010 study conducted by the Centers for Disease Control found that around 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men had experienced an attempted or completed rape in their lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |date=November 2011 |title=The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey: 2010 Summary Report |url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/nisvs/summaryreports.html |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |page=1 |access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/sv-datasheet-a.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in survey samples, definitions of rape and sexual assault, and the wording of survey questions likely contribute to these differences, and there is no consensus on the best way to measure rape and sexual assault. Both the NCVS and UCR are believed to significantly under-count the number of rapes and sexual assaults that occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |editor-last1=Kruttschnitt |editor-first1=C |editor-last2=Kalsbeek |editor-first2=WD |editor-last3=House |editor-first3=CC |date=7 April 2014 |title=Panel on Measuring Rape and Sexual Assault in Bureau of Justice Statistics Household Surveys; Committee on National Statistics; Division on Behavioral and Social Sciences and Education; |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK202252/ |publisher=National Research Council |page=1 |access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the available data, 21.8% of American rapes of female victims are [[gang rape]]s.&lt;ref name="Horvath, Miranda 2013, page 15"&gt;Horvath, Miranda et al. ''Handbook on the Study of Multiple Perpetrator Rape''. Routledge 2013, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical trends===
[[Image:Rapes per 1000 people 1973-2003.jpg|right|thumb|{{citation needed|Rape rates in the U.S. per 1000 people, 1973-2003.|date=November 2018}}]]
Over the last four decades, rape has been declining. According to the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]], the adjusted per-capita [[victimization]] rate of rape has declined from about 2.4 per 1000 people (age 12 and above) in 1980 (that is, 2.4 persons from each 1000 people 12 and older were raped during that year) to about 0.4 per 1000 people, a decline of about 85%. There are several possible explanations for this, including stricter laws, education on security for women, and a correlation with the rise in [[Internet pornography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = D'Amato | first = Anthony | title = Porn Up, Rape Down | journal = Social Science Research Network | date = 23 June 2006 | ssrn = 913013 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics of attackers and victims===
The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] have also collected data cases involving victims and perpetrators of rape:

Sex offense victims in 2012 (FBI):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/nibrs/2012/table-pdfs/victims-sex-by-offense-category-2012|title = Victims sex by offense category|date = 2012|access-date = |website = FBI|publisher = Federal Bureau of Investigation|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 4,394 female
* 70,930 male

Most rape research and reporting to date has concentrated on male-female forms of rape. Male-male and female-male rape has not been as thoroughly researched, and almost no research has been done on [[Lesbian rape|female-female rape]].

A 1997 report by the U.S. [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] found that 91% of rape victims are female and 9% are male, and that 99% of arrestees for rape are male.&lt;ref name="BJSRape"/&gt;{{rp|10}} However, these statistics are based on reports of "forced penetration". This number excludes instances where men were "made to penetrate" another person, which are assessed separately under "sexual violence". Denov (2004) states that societal responses to the issue of female perpetrators of sexual assault "point to a widespread denial of women as potential sexual aggressors that could work to obscure the true dimensions of the problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53192104 |title=Perspectives on female sex offending : a culture of denial |last=Denov |first=Myriam S. |date=2004 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=0754635651 |location=Aldershot, Hampshire, England |oclc=53192104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study of college campus rape statistics by the BJS found that 63% of reported rapes against females aged 18 to 24 are done by white males, 19% are done by black males and 10% are done by another race and 8% are unknown. The study used data from 1995-2013, and show that rape in college are independent of race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/rsavcaf9513.pdf |title=Rape and sexual assault victimization among college-age females, 1995-2013 |first1=Sofi |last1=Sinozich |first2=Lynn |last2=Langton |website=Bureau of Justice Statistics |language=en |access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Violence Against Women Survey found that 34% of American Indian female respondents had experienced attempted or completed rape in their lifetime. The rapist was more likely to be a non-Native than a Native.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/223691.pdf |title=Violence Against American Indian and Alaska Native Women and the Criminal Justice Response: What is Known |first1=Ronet |last1=Bachman |first2=Heather |last2=Zaykowski |first3=Rachel |last3=Kallmyer |first4=Margarita |last4=Poteyeva |first5=Christina |last5=Lanier |date=August 2018 |website=National Criminal Justice Reference System |access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey found that 13.1% of lesbians, 46.1% of bisexual women, and 17.4% of heterosexual women have been raped, physically assaulted, or stalked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/nisvs_sofindings.pdf |title=The National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey: 2010 Findings on Victimization by Sexual Orientation |last1=Walters |first1=M.L. |last2=Chen |first2=J. |last3=Breiding |first3=M.J. |date=January 2013 |website=CDC.gov |access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relationship between attacker and victim====

An examination of the relationship between the victim and his or her attacker indicates the following:

|-
| Another relative || 7%
|-
| Friend or acquaintance || 38%

About four out of ten sexual assaults take place at the victim's own home.&lt;ref name="BJSRape"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/SOO.PDF | format=PDF | title=Sex Offenses and Offenders | publisher=[[U.S. Department of Justice]] | work=[[Bureau of Justice Statistics]] | date=February 1997 | accessdate=June 21, 2016 | author=Greenfeld, Lawrence A. | page=3 |id=NCJ-163392}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

===Underreporting===
A 2013 study found that rape is significantly underreported in the United States.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2013"/&gt; Furthermore, a 2014 study determined that police departments eliminate or undercount rapes from official records in part to "create the illusion of success in fighting violent crime".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

A 2014 report by the Department of Justice estimated that 34.8% cases of sexual assaults are reported to the authorities.&lt;ref name = "BJS 2014 Reported Rate"/&gt;

When sufficient DNA or injury evidence was procured from a woman's body, she was more likely to follow through with the legal process of prosecution as there was more confidence in a favorable outcome for her. Women who experienced forced sexual assault more frequently were less likely to follow through with the legal process than women who do not experience forced sexual assault frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher BS, Kaplan A, Budescu M, Fargo JD, Tiller DA, Everett JS, Sommers MS.

===Prosecution rate===
Based on Department of Justice and FBI data from 2010-2014, RAINN (Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network) calculates&lt;ref name="rainn_stats" /&gt; that for every 1,000 rapes, 384 are reported to police, 57 result in an arrest, 11 are referred for prosecution, 7 result in a felony conviction, and 6 result in incarceration. This compares to a higher rate at every stage for similar crimes, such as robbery. Out of 1,000 incidents of [[Assault|assault and battery]], 627 are reported to police, 255 result in an arrest, 105 are referred to prosecution, 41 result in a felony conviction, and 33 result in incarceration.

Definitions of rape can vary, and since not all rapes are reported, researchers instead rely on surveys of student and nonstudent populations to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the prevalence. Survey design including the questions and the sample quality and scope can also create wide ranges in rates. Research estimates anywhere from approximately 10%&lt;ref name="CSA"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/221153.pdf|title= The Campus Sexual Assault Survey|publisher= National Institute of Justice|accessdate=2015-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 29%&lt;ref name="RennisonAddington2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rennison|first1=C.

Methodological differences, such as the method of survey administration, the definition of rape or sexual assault used, the wording of questions, and the time period studied contribute to these disparities.&lt;ref name="RennisonAddington2014" /&gt;

===Jurisdiction===
In the United States, the principle of [[Dual sovereignty doctrine|dual sovereignty]] applies to rape, as to other crimes. If the rape is committed within the borders of a state, that state has [[jurisdiction]]. If the victim is a federal official, an [[ambassador]], [[consul (representative)|consul]], or other foreign official under the protection of the United States, or if the crime took place on federal property or involved crossing state borders, or in a manner that substantially affects [[interstate commerce]] or [[national security]], then the federal government also has jurisdiction.

If a crime is not committed within any state, such as in the [[District of Columbia]] or on a [[United States Navy|naval]] or U.S.-[[Flag state|flag]]ged [[merchant vessel]] in [[international waters]], then federal jurisdiction is exclusive. In cases where the rape involves both state and federal jurisdictions, the offender can be tried and punished separately for each crime without raising issues of [[double jeopardy]]. When a state has jurisdiction over a rape case, as a matter of policy, federal prosecution will not be pursued for a rape charge unless the case presents a matter of federal interest, that interest was not adequately addressed by a state-level prosecution, and the government believes that a federal prosecution will be successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sec. 9-2.031 - Dual and Successive Prosecution Policy ("Petite Policy")|url=https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-2000-authority-us-attorney-criminal-division-mattersprior-approvals#9-2.031|website=U.S. Attorney's Manual|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice|accessdate=9 October 2017|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jurisdiction issues also complicate the handling of campus rape, due in part to overlapping jurisdiction of campus and local law enforcement, and differences in how various police agencies and prosecutors handle sex offenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/2905637/campus-rape-assault-prosecution/|title=Why Victims of Rape in College Don't Report to the Police|work=TIME.com|author=Eliza Gray|date=June 23, 2014|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal law===
Federal law does not use the term "rape". Rape is grouped with all forms of non-consensual sexual acts under chapter 109a of the [[United States Code]] ({{usc|18|2241|2248}}).

Under federal law, the punishment for rape can range from a fine to [[life imprisonment]]. The severity of the punishment is based on the use of violence, the age of the victim, and whether drugs or intoxicants were used to override consent. If the perpetrator is a repeat offender the law prescribes automatically doubling the maximum sentence.

Whether the victim is an adult&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Coker v. Georgia|vol=433|reporter=U.S.|opinion=584|date=1997|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13789703704209593383|via=Google Scholar|accessdate=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or of a child,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Kennedy v.

Capital punishment remains available as a penalty where the victim dies, or where the defendant acts with intent to kill the victim but the victim survives.

==Investigations==
{{Further|Rape investigation}}
Medical personnel in the United States of America typically collect evidence for potential rape cases commonly referred to as [[rape kit]]s. Though normally collected, the rape kits are not always sent off for testing.  Reasons given by the police for rape kits not being tested include cost (processing a kit can cost up to $1,500), decisions being made to not prosecute, and victims either recanting or declining to progress the case.&lt;ref name="cbsnews.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/09/cbsnews_investigates/main5590118.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody | work=CBS News | title=Exclusive: Rape in America: Justice Denied | date=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As identifying injury is an important part of identifying rape victims, particular attention must be given to examinations of patients with dark skin, particularly the thighs, labia majora, posterior fourchette, and fossa navicularis.&lt;ref&gt;Baker RB, Fargo JD, Shambley-Ebron D, Sommers MS. A source of healthcare disparity: Race, skin color, and injuries after rape among adolescents and young adults. Journal of Forensic Nursing, 2010; 6: 144-150&lt;/ref&gt;

Newspaper ''[[Northern Virginia Sun]]'' drew national attention in the late 1970s when owner Herman J. Obermayer said the Sun would print the name of accusers in [[rape]] cases that came to trial, out of a sense of "fairness" between the two sides.&lt;ref name="naming names"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,945911,00.html?iid=chix-sphere|title=Press: Naming Names|date=30 January 1978|work=TIME.com|accessdate=12 September 2016|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time (magazine)|''Time magazine'']] reported that Obermayer's policy was "hotly denounced by local [[feminist]]s, [[police]], [[prosecutor]]s, [[hospital]] officials and nearly all the Sun readers who have written or telephoned Obermayer to comment." ''Time'' quoted [[Benjamin C. Bradlee]], executive editor of the [[Washington Post]], as saying, "It's wrong. It's misguided. We wouldn't do it."&lt;ref name="naming names"/&gt;

It is important for lawyers selecting jury members to be aware of the stigmas surrounding rape victims and to be able to determine which jurors would be able to come to a guilty verdict according to the law, without being clouded by one's preconceived ideas of what a "typical" rape victim or perpetrator should look like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aequitasresource.org/EducatingJuriesInSexualAssaultCasesPart1.pdf |title=Educating Juries in Sexual Assault Cases - Part 1: Using Voir Dire to Eliminate Jury Bias |last=Mallios |first=Christopher |last2=Meisner |first2=Toolsi |date=July 2010 |website= |access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment of rape victims==
Insurance companies have denied coverage for rape victims, claiming a variety of bases for their actions. In one case, after a victim mentioned she had previously been raped 17 years before, an insurance company refused to pay for her rape exam and also refused to pay for therapy or medication for trauma, because she "had been raped before" – indicating a preexisting condition.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/21/insurance-companies-rape-_n_328708.html |title= Rape Victim's Choice: Risk AIDS or Health Insurance? |first= Danielle |last= Ivory |date=October 21, 2009 |work= [[The Huffington Post]] |accessdate= 2 December 2009 |quote= Other patients and therapists wrote in with allegations that insurers are routinely denying long-term mental health care to women who have been sexually assaulted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some insurance companies have allegedly denied sexual-assault victims mental-health treatment, stating that the service is not medically necessary.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

The [[VAWA|2005 Violence Against Women Act]] requires states to ensure that victims receive access to a forensic examination free of charge regardless of whether the victim chooses to report a sexual assault to law enforcement or cooperate with the criminal-justice system. All states must comply with the VAWA 2005 requirement regarding forensic examination in order to receive STOP Violence Against Women Formula Grant Program (STOP Program) funds. Under 42 U.S.C. § 3796gg-4, a State is not entitled to funds under the STOP Program unless the State or another governmental entity "incurs the full out-of-pocket cost of forensic medical exams ... for victims of sexual assault."&lt;ref name="Fact Sheets"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/ovw-fs.htm |title=USDOJ: OVW: Fact Sheets |date=2011-02-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205001022/http://www.ovw.usdoj.gov/ovw-fs.htm |archivedate=2011-02-05 |deadurl=yes |access-date=2018-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that, if no other governmental entity or insurance carrier pays for the exam, states are required to pay for forensic exams if they wish to receive STOP Program funds. The goal of this provision is to ensure that the victim is not required to pay for the exam. The effect of the VAWA 2005 forensic examination requirement is to allow victims time to decide whether to pursue their case. Because a sexual assault is a traumatic event, some victims are unable to decide whether they want to cooperate with law enforcement in the immediate aftermath of a sexual assault. Because forensic evidence can be lost as time progresses, such victims should be encouraged to have the evidence collected as soon as possible without deciding to initiate a report. This provision ensures victims receive timely medical treatment.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheets"/&gt;

Due to bureaucratic mismanagement in some areas, and various loopholes, the victim is sometimes sent a bill anyway, and has difficulty in getting it fixed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/07/30/despite-promises-some-rap_n_248144.html|title=Despite Promises, Some Rape Victims Stuck Paying Exam Bills|last=Baram|first=Marcus|date=2009-11-04|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2018-06-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sexual assaults affected girls as young as 12 years old; a young slave girl named Celia was the frequent target of her master, Robert Newsom's abuse. After having three children with him in a relationship that began when she was only 14, Celia killed her master in self-defense after another attempt at sexual assault. She was found guilty in court and sentenced to death by hanging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and Capital Punishment in the United States: An Analytical History|author=David V. Baker|publisher=McFarland|date=November 23, 2015|pages=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slave women were also subject to sexual abuse by slave traders and were routinely assaulted on slave ships; the perpetrators faced no legal punishment. The rape of slave women was also done by masters to result in a substantial growth of their slaves as property and increase profit.

=== Contemporary history ===

Rape, in many US states, before the 1970s, could incur [[capital punishment]]. The 1977 Supreme Court case of ''[[Coker v. Georgia]]'' held that the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] forbade the death penalty for the crime of [[rape]] of an adult woman. The court held that "Life is over for the victim of the murderer; for the rape victim, life may not be nearly so happy as it was, but it is not over, and normally is not beyond repair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|url=http://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/433/584/case.html|litigants=Coker v. Georgia|vol=433|reporter=U.S.|opinion=584|date=1977|via=justia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminism]] politicized and publicized [[rape culture|rape as an institution]] in the late 20th century.

{{quote|New York Radical Feminists held a Rape Speak Out, where women discussed rape as an expression of male violence against women, and organized women to establish rape crisis centers and work towards reforming existing rape laws. This was the first attempt to focus political attention on the issue of rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Klein|first= Ethel|title= Gender Politics: from consciousness to mass politics|year= 1984|publisher= Harvard University Press|location= Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn= 0-674-34197-X|page= 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Feminist writings on rape include ''[[Against Our Will|Against Our Will: Men, Women, and Rape]]'', by [[Susan Brownmiller]]. Concepts such as [[date rape]] and [[marital rape]] were brought to public attention.

The [[murder of Megan Kanka]], which occurred in 1994 in [[New Jersey]], when the seven-year-old girl was raped and murdered by her neighbor, has led to the introduction of [[Megan's Law]], which are laws which require law enforcement to disclose details relating to the location of registered sex offenders.

Several developments in regard to rape legislation have occurred in the 21st century. Following the intensely publicized case of the 2005 [[murder of Jessica Lunsford]], a 9-year-old girl from Florida who was kidnapped, raped and murdered by a man with prior convictions for sexual attacks, states have started enacting laws referred to as [[Jessica's Law]], which typically mandate life imprisonment with a [[mandatory minimum sentence]] of 25 years in prison, and lifetime electronic monitoring, for adults convicted of raping children under 12 years. Furthermore, [[US sex offender registries]] contain other sanctions, such as housing and presence restrictions.

===26 January in India===
{{Main|Republic Day (India)}}
India gained its independence on 15 August 1947, after which the process of preparing a constitution was started. The [[Constitution of India|Constitution]] was passed on 26 November 1949 in the [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]]. It was adopted on 26 January 1950 with a democratic government system. 26 January was selected, because it was this day in 1930 when the [[Purna Swaraj|Declaration of Indian Independence]] was passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.sandhira.com/7-republic-day-facts-that-every-indian-should-know.html |title=7 Republic day facts that every Indian should know |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131165034/http://articles.sandhira.com/7-republic-day-facts-that-every-indian-should-know.html |archivedate=31 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
India achieved independence from British rule on 15 August 1947 following the Indian independence movement noted for largely peaceful nonviolent resistance and civil disobedience led by the Indian National Congress. The independence came through the Indian Independence Act 1947 (10 &amp; 11 Geo 6 c. 30), an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that partitioned British India into the two new independent Dominions of the British Commonwealth (later Commonwealth of Nations): India and Pakistan. India obtained its independence on 15 August 1947 as a constitutional monarchy with George VI as head of state and the Earl Mountbatten as governor-general. The country, though, did not yet have a permanent constitution; instead its laws were based on the modified colonial Government of India Act 1935. On 28 August 1947, the Drafting Committee was appointed to draft a permanent constitution, with Dr.B. R. Ambedkar as chairman. While India's Independence Day celebrates its freedom from British Rule, the Republic Day celebrates of coming into force of its constitution.

A draft constitution was prepared by the committee and submitted to the Assembly on 4 November 1947. The Assembly met, in sessions open to public, for 166 days, spread over a period of 2 years, 11 months and 18 days before adopting the Constitution. After many deliberations and some modifications, the 308 members of the Assembly signed two hand-written copies of the document (one in Hindi and one in English) on 24 January 1950. Two days later, it came into effect throughout the nation. The main Republic Day celebration is held in the national capital of New Delhi at the [[Rajpath]] before the [[President of India]].

On 29 November 1943, the [[AVNOJ|Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] established the foundations of post-war [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] as a [[federal republic]], which was officially proclaimed on the same date in 1945. Republic Day (local name: ''Dan Republike'' or Дан Републике) marked the occasion two consecutive days, 29 and 30 November, and was likely the most important holiday (the other two-day holidays were New Year and May Day).

In elementary schools first graders were inducted into the [[Pioneer Movement]] on or around Republic Day.  Employees merged the holiday with weekends and extra days off to form weekends of three, four or even five days. Urban dwellers took the occasion to visit their relatives in the country, who marked the event with [[pig slaughter]] and the ensuing feast.

In the 1980s, as the authority of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia#Politics|central government]] and [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|League of Communists]] eroded, dissenters targeted Republic Day celebrations for criticism.  In 1987, [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] [[garage rock]] band ''[[Zabranjeno pušenje]]'' published a song entitled ''Dan Republike'', in which they criticized the [[Economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia#Collapse of the Yugoslav economy|state of the economy]] and protested the general indifference to the ideals behind the holiday. The band had to [[censorship|change some of the lyrics]] before being allowed to air the song.

In 1990, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] was the first federal republic to cease observing the holiday. Other seceded republics followed suit as [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia dissolved]]. The [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] kept the holiday until 2002.

The date "29.XI.1943" figured prominently on the [[Coat of arms of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav coat of arms]].

'''Rock The Desert''' is a [[Christian music festival]] held in [[Midland, Texas]] United States every August.

==Background==
Rock the Desert began in August 1999 on the parking lot of Holy Trinity Episcopal Church in Midland, Texas. An idea birthed by Jeff Fouts, the associate Rector, to provide a free concert as a project to reach out to the church neighborhood has grown to become an area-wide event.

[[File:Soul Saturday Kollyva offerings.jpg|right|thumb|Kollyva offerings of boiled wheat blessed liturgically on Soul Saturday (''Psychosabbaton'').]]
'''Saturday of Souls''' (or Soul Saturday) is a day set aside for the commemoration of the dead within the [[liturgical year]] of the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and Byzantine Catholic Churches. Saturday is a traditional day of prayer for the dead, because Christ lay dead in the [[Holy Sepulchre|Tomb]] on Saturday.
There are several Soul Saturdays throughout the year:
* The Saturday of Meatfare Week (the second Saturday before [[Great Lent]])
* The second Saturday of Great Lent
* The third Saturday of Great Lent
* The fourth Saturday of Great Lent
* Radonitsa (Monday or Tuesday after St. Thomas Sunday, i.e. Second Sunday of Easter)
* The Saturday before [[Pentecost]]
* Demetrius Saturday (the Saturday before the feast of Saint Demetrius of Thessaloniki, i.e. 26 October).

In the Bulgarian Orthodox Church there is a commemoration of the dead on the Saturday before the feast of Saint Michael the Archangel, i.e. on 8 November (instead of the Demetrius Soul Saturday).
These days are devoted to prayer for departed relatives and others among the faithful who would not be commemorated specifically as saints. The Divine Services on these days have special hymns added to them to commemorate the departed. There is normally a Panikhida (Memorial Service) either after the Divine Liturgy on Saturday morning or after Vespers on Friday evening, for which Koliva (a dish made of boiled wheatberries or rice and honey) is prepared and placed on the Panikhida table. After the Service, the priest blesses the Koliva. It is then eaten as a memorial by all present.

All Orthodox and Byzantine Catholics observe Soul Saturdays on Meatfare Saturday (i.e., two Saturdays before the beginning of Great Lent); the second, third and fourth Saturdays of Great Lent; and the Saturday before Pentecost.
Others, such as the Serbian Orthodox, observe commemorations of the dead on the Saturdays before 8 August and before 24 October. The Russians observe memorials on the Saturdays closest to 26 October (Saint Demetrius) and 23 September (Conception of St. John the Forerunner).

Another Memorial Day, Radonitsa, does not fall on a Saturday, but on either Monday or Tuesday of the second week after Pascha (Easter). Radonitsa does not have special hymns for the dead at the Divine Services. Instead, a Panikhida will follow the Divine Liturgy, and then all will bring paschal foods to the cemeteries to greet the departed with the joy of the Resurrection.

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], a '''Saturday sports paper''' was a local [[newspaper]] published on a Saturday evening containing information about [[sport]]s matches played on that day. Throughout most of the twentieth century they were very popular, representing one of the few up to date sources of information available to sports fans. Gradually, circulations fell and all had ceased publication by December 2017.

Saturday sports papers were published locally, with a different paper produced in each area covering local teams in depth. They were often connected to the local newspaper. In [[Cardiff]], for example, the [[South Wales Echo|Western Mail and Echo]] published the South Wales Sport Echo (previously the Football Echo.)&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4607366.stm Final whistle for sports 'pink'], [[BBC News]], 15 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In all areas Saturday sports papers were commonly nicknamed according to the colour of the paper they were printed on, which usually was not white. The "sports pink" or "green 'un" were common names.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-end-of-saturday-sports-papers-522178.html The end of Saturday sports papers?], [[The Independent]], 9 January 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Saturday sports papers focus on [[football (soccer)|football]], providing match reports of games involving local teams and a full listing of final scores. Many also cover other traditional sports such as [[Rugby football|rugby]]&lt;ref name="indy"/&gt; or [[cricket]]&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; and some have expanded into covering newer sports such as [[ice hockey]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intothestorm.co.uk/following.html Following Manchester Storm], intothestorm.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Saturday sports papers are published as soon after full-time as possible. Cardiff's South Wales Sports Echo was available to buy within twenty minutes of the end of the game, featuring half-time reports and full-time scores, with a fuller edition later in the evening.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Many sports fans have fond memories of going out to buy a Saturday sports paper as soon as it was printed to find out how their team had done.&lt;ref name="will"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/gloucestershire/content/articles/2008/01/29/wills_magic_weekend_feature.shtml Will's magic weekend], [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the advent of radio, Saturday sports papers were the only way most fans had of finding out sporting results&lt;ref name="will"/&gt; and consequently they were very popular, some with circulations of more than 50,000.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; Since the start of the 21st century, however, Saturday sports papers declined dramatically in sales. [[Birmingham]]'s ''[[Sports Argus]]'', which used to be the biggest selling Saturday sports paper in the country, was one of many to be forced to close, publishing its last issue on 13 May 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=33821&amp;sectioncode=1 Birmingham sport paper to close], Press Gazette, 14 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Those that remained saw declining sales&lt;ref name="indy"/&gt; or switched to providing [[website]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/news/2007/05may/070531sport.shtml Papers close Saturday sports editions in online move], HoldtheFrontPage.co.uk, 31 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of factors have adversely affected the popularity of Saturday sports papers. [[Broadcasting of sports events|Televised sport]] means that matches (particularly football) frequently do not take place on Saturday afternoons so they cannot be adequately covered by a Saturday evening publication. Another issue is the rise of alternative sources of information. The [[internet]], [[mobile phone]]s and [[teletext]] services also allowed sports fans to follow their team's progress without the need for Saturday sports papers.&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt;

==The final titles==
The [[Sheffield Star Green 'Un]] closed in the summer of 2013 and the [[Sunderland Echo]] Pink followed at the end of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McGarthy|first1=Emma|title=Sunderland Echo replaces Pink football paper with free page-turning digital edition|url=http://www.pressgazette.co.uk/sunderland-echo-replaces-pink-football-paper-with-free-page-turning-digital-edition/|accessdate=14 December 2017|publisher=pressgazette.co.uk|date=9 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This left only two Saturday sports papers in existence - Portsmouth's Sports Mail which had only just been resurrected for the 2013-14 season (having originally run from 1903 until 2012) and the [[Southern Daily Echo]]'s Sports Pink. 

The Sports Mail moved its publication date to a Sunday in October 2016. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revived Saturday sports paper set to close unless more readers found|url=http://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2016/news/revived-saturday-sports-paper-set-to-close-unless-more-readers-found/|accessdate=26 November 2016|publisher=holdthefrontpage.co.uk|date=19 Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Neil|first1=Allen|title=Last Chance for an Old Friend|url=http://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/football/pompey/last-chance-for-an-old-friend-1-7606234|accessdate=26 November 2016|date=30 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sports Mail Gets A Makeover|url=https://www.portsmouth.co.uk/sport/football/pompey/sports-mail-gets-a-makeover-1-7582319|accessdate=14 December 2017|publisher=portsmouth.co.uk|date=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Daily Echo's Sports Pink therefore remained the final Saturday Sports paper until it too closed on 9 December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Pink|url=http://www.dailyecho.co.uk/sport/the_pink/|accessdate=26 November 2016|publisher=Southern Daily Echo}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sharman|first1=David|title=Regional daily axes Saturday sports edition after 119 years|url=https://www.holdthefrontpage.co.uk/2017/news/regional-daily-shuts-saturday-sports-edition-after-119-years/|accessdate=14 December 2017|publisher=holdthefrontpage.co.uk|date=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Soest Feud''' ({{lang-de|Soester Fehde}}), or '''Feud of Soest''', was a [[feud]] that took place from 1444 to 1449 in which the town of [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] claimed its freedom from Archbishop [[Dietrich II of Moers|Dietrich]] of [[Electoral Cologne|Cologne]] (1414–1463), who tried to restore his rule. The town of Soest opposed this attempt on 5&amp;nbsp;June 1444 by accepting a new suzerain,  [[John I of Cleves-Mark|John&amp;nbsp;I]], the Duke of Cleves-Mark, who guaranteed the town its old rights as well as new ones. As a result Emperor [[Frederick III (HRR)|Frederick&amp;nbsp;III]] imposed the [[imperial ban]] on the town. The victory of the town (as a result of the Archbishop of Cologne abandoning his attempt) meant that Soest had ''de facto'' more freedom than a [[free imperial city]] until it was annexed by [[Prussia]], but at the same time it had to forfeit its economic power because it was now an enclave within Cologne's territory.

The '''2009–present phase of the [[Somali Civil War]]''' is concentrated in southern [[Somalia]]. It began in early February 2009 with the conflict between the forces of the [[Federal Government of Somalia]], assisted by [[African Union]] [[peacekeeping]] troops, and various militant terrorist groups and factions. The violence has displaced thousands of people in the southern part of the country. The conflict has also seen fighting between the [[Sufi]] [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a]] and [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]]. 

On 16 October 2011, the [[Kenya Army|Kenyan Army]] crossed the border into Somalia in [[Operation Linda Nchi]] against Al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name="Eanbkois2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/africa/East-African-Nations-Back-Kenyan-Offensive-in-Somalia-132374053.html|agency=Voice of America|title=E.

In 2012, Kismayo was [[Battle of Kismayo (2012)|captured]].

In August 2014, the Somali government-led [[Operation Indian Ocean]] was launched to clean up the remaining insurgent-held pockets in the countryside.&lt;ref name="Spsgdncfmaep"/&gt;

In 2017, the [[14 October 2017 Mogadishu bombings|14 October]] and [[28 October 2017 Mogadishu bombings|28 October Mogadishu bombings]] killed more than 500 and injured more than 400.

==Background==
{{main article|War in Somalia (2006–2009)}}
Established in 2004 and internationally recognized, the [[Transitional Federal Government]]'s (TFG) support in Somalia was waning until the United States-backed 2006 intervention by the Ethiopian military, which helped drive out the rival [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU) in Mogadishu and solidify the TFG's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/153/26334.html |title=Ethiopian Invasion of Somalia |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=14 August 2007 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this defeat, the ICU splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including [[Al-Shabaab (Somalia)|Al-Shabaab]], regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured [[Baidoa]] but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to withdraw from the country, leaving behind an underequipped [[African Union]] (AU) peacekeeping force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,USCIRF,,,4a4f272bc,0.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510005900/http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,USCIRF,,,4a4f272bc,0.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=10 May 2011 |title=USCIRF Annual Report 2009 – The Commission's Watch List: Somalia |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A power sharing deal ensued between an Islamist splinter group led by Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed's Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia Djibouti faction (ARS-D) and TFG Prime Minister Nur Hassan in [[Djibouti]]. Al-Shabaab, which had separated from the moderate Islamists of the insurgency, rejected the peace deal and continued to take territories. It was joined by [[Hizbul Islam]], which is an amalgamation of four Islamist group including the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia – [[Asmara]] faction. Another Islamist group, Ahlu Sunnah Waljama'ah, which was allied with the TFG and supported by Ethiopia, continues to attack al-Shabaab and take over towns as well although they have been effective only in the central region of [[Galguduud]], where they ousted al-Shabaab from most of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/africa/news/article_1456455.php/Moderate_Islamists_seize_town_from_Somali_insurgents_ |title=Moderate Islamists seize town from Somali insurgents |publisher=Monstersandcritics.com |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731075516/http://monstersandcritics.com/news/africa/news/article_1456455.php/Moderate_Islamists_seize_town_from_Somali_insurgents_ |archivedate=31 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mareeg.com/fidsan.php?sid=10277&amp;tirsan=3 |title=Moderate Islamic group claims victory over rival hardline group |publisher=Mareeg.com |date=1 January 1996 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethioforum.org/wp/archives/759 |title=Ahlu Suna Wal Jamea supported by Ethiopian government |publisher=Ethioforum.org |accessdate=20 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213185644/http://ethioforum.org/wp/archives/759 |archivedate=13 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamist-ARS/TFG coalition conflict===

On 4 February 2009, four Islamist groups, including Hassan Dahir Aweys' Eritrean branch of the [[Alliance for the Reliberation of Somalia|ARS]] merged and created the group [[Hisbi Islam]], to fight the new government of Sharif Ahmed. [[Al-Shabaab (Somalia)|Al-Shabaab]] also vowed to fight the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200902050135.html | title=Somalia: Islamist Groups Merge to Fight Sheikh Sharif | publisher=allAfrica | date=4 February 2009 | accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 February 2009, they declared war on the new government of Sharif Ahmed and the AU peace-keepers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200902080003.html | title=Somalia: Islamic Party Insurgents Declare War On New Govt | publisher=allAfrica | date=7 February 2009 | accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New TFG President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed arrived in Mogadishu as a president for the first time on 7 February 2009. The al-Shabaab and other radical Islamists began firing at the new TFG president hours later. They accused the new President of accepting the secular transitional government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g7OaI4_kjeHA-o4UhlmP7vlWmrrwD966RU880 Radical Islamists attack new president Ahmed's palace] {{Dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 February, heavy fighting broke out in southern [[Mogadishu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail.aspx?id=85107&amp;sectionid=351020501 |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.ir |accessdate=20 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410150456/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=85107&amp;sectionid=351020501 |archivedate=10 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[al-Shabaab (Somalia)|al-Shabaab]] leader Sheikh Mukhtar Robow (Abu Mansur) met with Sharif Ahmed for peace talks during his visit to [[Mogadishu]], while Omar Iman rejected the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=85097&amp;sectionid=351020501 |title=Somali president gears up for peace |publisher=Presstv.ir |accessdate=20 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090611083240/http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=85097&amp;sectionid=351020501 |archivedate=11 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During these negotiations, Sharif Ahmed said that he would be prepared to enforce [[Sharia Law]] in Somalia, which is now the radical groups' main demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200902091418.html | title=Somalia: President Ready to Practice Sharia Law | publisher=allAfrica | date=9 February 2009 | accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sheikh Mukhtar Robow, a former Al-Shabab spokesman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200905140395.html |title=Somalia: Al Shabaab Leader Speaks, More Fighting in Mogadishu |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=13 May 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; denied having talked to Sharif Ahmed and vowed to continue fighting until his demands for Sharia Law were met. Sheikh Mukhtar Robow warned [[Nigeria]] against sending peace keepers to Somalia, as al-Shabaab views the AU peace keepers as occupying forces and will continue fighting them until they withdraw from the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200902120738.html|title=Somalia: Al-Shabaab Spokesman Denies Media Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=allAfrica.com|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 February, al-Shabaab launched an offensive to take the Bakool province. Government officials who had been ousted from Baidoa had been amassing troops in the city of Hudur (Xudur) and planning a major offensive to re-take Baidoa. Islamist forces attacked the province and reached the capital where they started a battle against government forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200902110007.html|title=Somalia: Tensions in Southwest Between Govt Forces, Al Shabaab|last=|first=|date=|website=allAfrica.com|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200902100717.html|title=Somalia: Government Soldiers And Islamists Fight in South-Western Town|last=|first=|date=|website=allAfrica.com|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Galmudug, Clan militia took the town of Masagaway from al-Shabaab.

On 12 February, the spokesman for al-Shabaab, Sheikh Mukhtar Robow (Abu Mansur), rebuffed reports from several media outlets that a mutual agreement between him and newly elected president Sharif Ahmed was made. He also added that he had no intention to contact the president on any matters, and that they would continue fighting against foreign troops and what he described as an "apostate" government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiiraan.com/news2/2009/feb/al_shabaab_reiterates_opposition_to_new_somali_leader.aspx |title=Al-Shabaab reiterates opposition to new Somali leader |publisher=Hiiraan.com |date=12 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, they vowed war against the new government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.somaliaonline.com/community/topic/al-shabaab-vow-war-against-new-govt-port-attacked/ |title=Al Shabaab vow war against new govt, port attacked |publisher=Somalia Online |date=13 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{main article|2009 African Union base bombing in Mogadishu|Battle of South Mogadishu}}
On 22 February, a double suicide bomb attack on an AU base in Mogadishu left 11 Burundian soldiers dead and another 15 wounded. Two days later heavy fighting erupted in the city as TFG and AU forces attempted to retake the city from radical Islamist forces. The fighting lasted for two days and killed 87 people, including: 48 civilians, 15 insurgents and 6 TFG policemen.

At the same time as the fighting raged in Mogadishu, al-Shabaab forces took the town of Hudor, to the north-west, in fighting that killed another 20 people: 10 TFG soldiers, 6 insurgents and 4 civilians.

On 28 February, it appeared that [[Hisbi Islam]] would sign a ceasefire with the [[Transitional Federal Government]].&lt;ref name="HisbiPeace?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/02/2009228161951283106.html|title=Somalia in truce with rebel group|date=28 February 2009|accessdate=20 March 2009|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1 March, it was clear that no ceasefire would be given, despite President [[Sharif Ahmed]] having agreed to proposals for a [[truce]] and having offered to accept the implementation of [[Sharia|Sharia Law]] but refused to move troops from civilian areas despite the Islamists doing so.&lt;ref name="NoHisbiPeace"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/03/20093117498433881.html|title=Somali rebels reject ceasefire|date=1 March 2009|accessdate=20 March 2009|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somaliweyn.org/pages/news/Mar_09/4Mar23.html|title=Somalia: Elder Ahmed Diriye condemns Somali government|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|accessdate=21 March 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311043106/http://www.somaliweyn.org/pages/news/Mar_09/4Mar23.html|archivedate=11 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Battle of Mogadishu (2009)}}
On 7 May, a fierce battle for control of Mogadishu started between al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam against the TFG. Hundreds were killed and injured and tens of thousands were displaced. By 11 May, rebel forces gained the upper hand and made large gains taking over most of the capital. Fighting continued until 14 May and, though they came close, the rebels didn't manage to overthrow the government. There were new rounds of fighting all through August.

16 May, al-Shabaab captured the strategic town of [[Jowhar]], which connects Mogadishu with central Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sun 17 23 May:30:24 2009 |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200905170014.html |title=Somalia: Al-Shabab Captures Strategic Town |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=17 May 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4 July, Sheik Abdinasir Jalil, a former commander of the training for ICU administration in Beledweyn town joined Hizbul Islam with his men and vowed to fight TFG forces in the city and attack Ethiopian forces in El-gal village, which lies 18&amp;nbsp;km from Beledweyn.

===Al-Shabaab-Hizbul Islam conflict===
The armed conflict between Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab began due to a dispute between the faction of the Ras Kamboni Brigades led by Sheikh Ahmed "Madoobe" and al-Shabaab,&lt;ref name="UNSCSOM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somalitalkradio.com/2010/mar/un_report_somalia.pdf |pages= 16 &amp; 18|title=Etpu |format=PDF |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; over a power sharing agreement in [[Kisimayo]]. Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab had made a power sharing agreement for the city, where the power would rotate between the two factions, with each faction controlling the city for periods of six months. However, due to clan politics al-Shabaab refused to let the power rotation take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/10/200910185652850176.html |title=Somali factions battle in Kismayo |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=1 October 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to internal problems within Hizbul Islam as its ARS-A and [[JABISO]] factions, which were aligned with al-Shabaab in Hiran and Mogadishu, refused to support the Ras Kamboni Brigades, while Anole remained neutral. It also led to a split within the Ras Kamboni Brigades, with a faction led by Hizbul Islam's deputy chairman Sheikh Hassan "Turki" refusing to back Ahmad "Madoobe" and instead siding with al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name="UNSCSOM"/&gt;

On 1 October, [[Battle of Kisimayo (2009)|heavy fighting]] broke out. By the afternoon, al-Shabaab controlled most of the city with dozens of casualties reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/86387/somalia-civilians-flee-fighting-kismayo |title=Civilians flee fighting in Kismayo |publisher=IRIN| date=1 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 17 people were killed in a series of battles overnight on 5 October.&lt;ref name="garoweonline.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_17_killed_in_renewed_clashes_near_Kismayo.shtml |title=17 killed in renewed clashes near Kismayo |publisher=Garowe Online |date=5 October 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007173220/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_17_killed_in_renewed_clashes_near_Kismayo.shtml |archivedate=7 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Hizbul Islam spokesman claimed that they had captured foreign fighters in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Hizbul_Islam_claims_to_capture_foreign_fighters.shtml |title=Somalia: Hizbul Islam claims to capture 'foreign fighters' |publisher=Garowe Online |date=6 October 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010180535/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Hizbul_Islam_claims_to_capture_foreign_fighters.shtml |archivedate=10 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle was decisively won by al-Shabaab which expelled Madbobe's Ras Kamboni Brigade forces from the city.&lt;ref name="circle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200912090585.html |title=Somalia: Al-Shabaab's Encirclement Strategy |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=8 December 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout November 2009, fighting between the two factions continued in Southern Somalia&lt;ref name="UNSCSOM"/&gt; and as  a result insurgent attacks in Mogadishu targeting TFG and AMISOM forces decreased.&lt;ref name="garoweonline.com"/&gt; However [[Ahmed Mohamed Islam|Sheikh Ahmad Madobe]]'s forces were soon overpowered by al-Shabaab and its local allies and forced to withdraw from the [[Jubbada Hoose|Lower Jubba region]] and most of Southern Somalia.&lt;ref name="UNSCSOM"/&gt;&lt;ref name="circle"/&gt; In February 2010, Sheikh Hassan Turki's branch of the Ras Kamboni Brigades declared a merge with al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name="UNSCSOM"/&gt; He encouraged other groups in Hizbul Islam to also join al-Shabaab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201002020211.html |title=Somalia: Notorious Islamist Guerrilla Leader Joins Al Shabaab |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=1 February 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Galmudug and Islamists===
Government officials from the [[Galmudug]] administration in the north-central [[Hobyo]] district also reportedly attempted to use pirate gangs as a bulwark against Islamist insurgents from southern Somalia's conflict zones.&lt;ref name="jgtle"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/02/world/africa/02pirates.html |title=In Somali Civil War, Both Sides Embrace Pirates |work=The New York Times |date= 1 September 2010|accessdate=27 March 2011 |first=Jeffrey |last=Gettleman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other pirates are alleged to have reached agreements of their own with the Islamist groups, although a senior commander from the [[Hizbul Islam]] militia vowed to eradicate piracy by imposing [[sharia law]] when his group briefly took control of Harardhere in May 2010 and drove out the local pirates.&lt;ref name="jgtle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sivteppfws"&gt;{{cite news|last=Haji |first=Mustafa |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j0OwOfeiTIzFFb3Vb2e8dxaI5qHA |title=Somali Islamists vow to end piracy, pirates flee with ships |agency=Agence France-Presse |work=Google News |date=2 May 2010 |accessdate=27 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223194103/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5j0OwOfeiTIzFFb3Vb2e8dxaI5qHA |archivedate=23 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 February 2011, it was reported that AMISOM troops destroyed a large complex of al-Shabaab trenches, and killed six al-Shabaab commanders in Mogadishu.

On 25 February, 15 people were killed as al-Shabaab fighters attempted to re-take lost territory in Mogadishu. Additionally, rebels displayed one wounded and five dead Burundian AMISOM soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_15_civilians_killed_in_Mogadishu_clashes.shtml |title=15 civilians killed in Mogadishu_clashes |publisher=Garowe Online |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=20 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301085930/http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_15_civilians_killed_in_Mogadishu_clashes.shtml |archivedate=1 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 February, an offensive by TFG troops with support of Ethiopian soldiers was opened in the southern Somali town of [[Bula Hawo]]. Until 28 February, 33 people were killed in TFG and Ethiopian shelling.

By 5 March, AMISOM and TFG forces claimed to control seven of the city's districts, while six were contested and three were controlled by anti-government forces. Al-Shabaab responded to the government offensive by putting up roadblocks to prevent the movement of goods from the seaport. This adversely affected both sides of the conflict, as the TFG controlled the port and its profits, while the Bakaara Market, where many of the goods were bound to be sold, was controlled by the insurgents.&lt;ref name="Gashandiga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/174/Ahlu_Sunna_Gedo_Leader_Dies_After_Ambush|title=SomaliaReport: AMISOM Vows To Keep Fighting For Mogadishu|work=somaliareport.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that by 5 March, up to 53 AMISOM may have died in the clashes.

===Defeat of Al-Shabaab in Mogadishu===
{{Main|Battle of Mogadishu (2010–11)}}

On 6 August 2011, the Transitional Federal Government's troops and their AMISOM allies managed to capture all of Mogadishu from the Al-Shabaab militants. Witnesses reported Al-Shabaab vehicles abandoning their bases in the capital for the south-central city of [[Baidoa]].

==Foreign involvement==

===African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM)===
{{Main|African Union Mission to Somalia}}

The African Union has deployed more than 16,000 soldiers to Somalia, mandated to support transitional governmental structures, implement a national security plan, train the Somali security forces, and assist in creating a secure environment for the delivery of [[humanitarian aid]].&lt;ref name="UN_SRES17722007_page3"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1772(2007) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2007 |resolution_number=1772 |page=3 |accessdate=13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of its duties, AMISOM also supports the [[Transitional Federal Government]]'s forces in their battle against Al-Shabaab militants.

AMISOM was created by the African Union's [[Peace and Security Council]] on 19 January 2007 with an initial six month mandate.&lt;ref name="69TH-MEETING-PEACE-SECURITY-COUNCIL"&gt;{{cite news|title=69th meeting of the peace and Security Council |url=http://www.apanews.net/article.php3?id_article=19420 |date=22 January 2007 |publisher=Agence de Presse Africaine |accessdate=9 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828223759/http://www.apanews.net/article.php3?id_article=19420 |archivedate=28 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 2007 the [[United Nations Security Council]] approved the mission's mandate.&lt;ref name="UN_SRES17442007"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1744(2007) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2007 |resolution_number=1744 |accessdate=13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent six-monthly renewals of AMISOM's mandate by the African Union Peace and Security Council have also been authorised by the United Nations Security Council.&lt;ref name="UN_SRES17722007"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1772(2007) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2007 |resolution_number=1772 |accessdate=13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_SRES18012008"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1801(2008) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2008 |resolution_number=1801 |accessdate=13 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AMISOM's UN mandate was extended for a further six months in August 2008 by UNSCR 1831.&lt;ref name="UN_SRES18312008"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-RES-1831(2008) |type=Resolution |body=Security Council |year=2008 |resolution_number=1831 |accessdate=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UN_SPV5942_2008"&gt;{{UN document |docid=S-PV-5942 |date=23 July 2008 |type=Verbatim Report |body=Security Council |meeting=5942 |accessdate=21 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AMISOM’s mandate has been extended each period that it has been up for review.

On 12 November 2013, the UN Security Council adopted SC Resolution 2124 (2013) extending AMISOM's mandate from 28 February 2014 to 31 October 2014. Acting upon the force's request, the resolution also increases AMISOM's maximum authorized strength from 17,731 to 22,126 troops.&lt;ref name="UN SC DOC"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/2124(2013)|title=United Nations Official Document|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The force, which has been reportedly engaged in fighting in Mogadishu and throughout the country, has reportedly suffered significant casualties during their mission, although no precise figures have been issued by the contributing countries.&lt;ref&gt;Report of AMISOM amphibious assault in UK Daily Telegraph.

===United States and UN===
The [[United National Development Program]] for Somalia spends about $50 million each year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.so.undp.org/index.php/Donors-and-partners.html UNDP in Somalia: Donors and Expenditures] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130161205/http://www.so.undp.org/index.php/Donors-and-partners.html |date=30 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though these funds are not related to military aid. Instead these programs, such as Employment Generation for Early Recovery (EGER).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.so.undp.org/index.php/Somalia-Stories/Employment-Generation-for-Early-Recovery.html Employment Generation for Early Recovery] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004140954/http://www.so.undp.org/index.php/Somalia-Stories/Employment-Generation-for-Early-Recovery.html |date=4 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2010, the U.S. State Department noted the United States directly obligated over $229 million to support AMISOM, and paid for other UN assistance for the mission indirectly through its obligations to the international body.&lt;ref name="US-State-Dept-Somalia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2863.htm|title=Background Note: Somalia |publisher=US State Department|date=3 January 2011|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the U.S. announced that it was set to exchange diplomatic notes with the new central government of Somalia, re-establishing official ties with the country for the first time in 20 years. According to the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], the decision was made in recognition of the significant progress that the Somali authorities had achieved on both the political and war fronts. The move is expected to grant the Somali government access to new sources of development funds from American agencies as well as international bodies like the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]], thereby facilitating the ongoing reconstruction process.&lt;ref name="Usstfrsgatyh"&gt;{{cite news|title=US set to formally recognise Somali government after 20-year hiatus|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/17/hillary-clinton-to-recognise-somalian-government|accessdate=18 January 2013|newspaper=Reuters|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Usstrsg"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. Set to Recognize Somali Government|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/us-set-to-recognize-somali-government/1585876.html|accessdate=18 January 2013|newspaper=VOA|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to diplomatic ties; roughly 50 U.S. special operations troops operate at undisclosed locations across southern Somalia advising and assisting, Kenyan, Somali and Ugandan forces in their fight against Al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name="edition.cnn.com"/&gt;

At the behest of the Somali and American federal governments, among other international actors, the [[United Nations Security Council]] unanimously approved [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2093]] during its 6 March 2013 meeting to suspend the 21-year [[arms embargo]] on Somalia. The endorsement officially lifts the purchase ban on light weapons for a provisional period of one year, but retains certain restrictions on the procurement of heavy arms such as surface-to-air missiles, howitzers and cannons.&lt;ref name="Aueoaefs"&gt;{{cite news|title=UN eases oldest arms embargo for Somalia|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/un-eases-oldest-arms-embargo-for-somalia/story-fn3dxix6-1226592031840|accessdate=6 March 2013|newspaper=AAP|date=6 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 April 2013, the U.S. government likewise approved the provision of defense articles and services by the American authorities to the Somali Federal Government.&lt;ref name="Usearfs"&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. eases arms restrictions for Somalia|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/Special/2013/04/09/US-eases-arms-restrictions-for-Somalia/UPI-82061365516759/|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=UPI|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the request of the Somali authorities and [[AMISOM]], the U.S. military in late 2013 also established a small team of advisers in Mogadishu to provide consultative and planning support to the allied forces.&lt;ref name="Umadtsftsbd"&gt;{{cite news|last=Martinez|first=Luis|title=U.S. Military Advisers Deployed to Somalia: First Time Since Blackhawk Down|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2014/01/u-s-military-advisers-deployed-to-somalia-first-time-since-blackhawk-down/|accessdate=12 January 2014|newspaper=ABC News|date=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Kingdom is also involved in combating Islamist terrorists in Somalia, since 2009, members of the [[Special Air Service]] and the [[Special Reconnaissance Regiment]] have been deployed to Camp Lemonnier to conduct counter-terrorist operations against Islamist terrorists in Somalia; they have carrying out surveillance missions of Britons believed to be travelling to Somalia for terrorist training and they are also working with US counterparts observing and "targeting" local terror suspects. They have also been carrying out a similar role in Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/8104119/Cargo-bomb-plot-SAS-hunting-al-Qaeda-in-Yemen.html|title=Cargo bomb plot: SAS hunting al-Qaeda in Yemen|publisher=the telegraph|date=2 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/politics/uk-and-us-spend-millions-to-counter-yemeni-threat-2121366.html|title=UK and US spend millions to counter Yemeni threat|publisher=the independent|date=30 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, it was reported that 70 [[British armed forces|UK military]] personnel have arrived in Somalia to counter Al-Shabaab as part of a UN peacekeeping mission; 10 soldiers will offer medical, engineering and logistical support to AMISOM. Personnel will also be sent to South Sudan to carry out a similar role.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

On 16 October 2016, the ''New York Times'' reported that American officials said the [[White House]] had quietly broadened the president’s authority for the use of force in Somalia by allowing airstrikes to protect American and African troops as they combat fighters from al-Shabaab. About 200 to 300 American Special Operations troops work with soldiers from Somalia and other African nations like Kenya and Uganda to carry out more than a half-dozen raids per month, according to senior American military officials. The operations are a combination of ground raids and drone strikes. [[SEAL Team 6]] has been heavily involved in many of these operations. American military officials said once ground operations are complete, American troops working with Somali forces often interrogate prisoners at temporary screening facilities, including one in [[Puntland]], before the detainees are transferred to more permanent Somali-run prisons. The Pentagon has only acknowledged a small fraction of these operations, announcing 13 ground raids and airstrikes so far in 2016 (3 of which took place in September) — up from 5 in 2015; according to data compiled by New America (a Washington [[Think tank]]) the strikes have killed about 25 civilians and 200 people suspected of being militants. At a [[Baledogle Airfield|former Russian fighter jet base in Baledogle]], U.S. Marines and private contractors are working to build up a Somali military unit designed to combat Al-Shabaab throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/world/africa/obama-somalia-secret-war.html?_r=0|title=In Somalia, U.S. Escalates a Shadow War|publisher=New York Times|date=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 March 2017, CNN reported that [[President of the United States|US President]] [[Donald Trump]] signed off a decision by the White House which approved a new strategy granting AFRICOM the authority to step up counterterrorism strikes in Somalia; under the new strategy, the US military will now be able to conduct precision airstrikes in support of the Somalia National Army and AMISOM forces. The new authorization designates some regions of Somalia an "area of active hostilities," freeing counterterrorism strikes there from restrictions governing other strikes outside the areas; an official said that the designated areas will not include Mogadishu and Puntland. Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon Spokesman said that "The additional support provided by this authority will help deny al-Shabaab safe havens from which it could attack US citizens or US interests in the region." Another official said that the legal basis for the new authority is the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|2001 AUMF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2017/03/30/politics/trump-ramps-up-somalia-anti-terror-campaign/|title=Trump approves plan to ramp up Somalia anti-terror campaign|publisher=CNN|date=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-April 2017, it was reported that 40 soldiers from the [[101st Airborne Division]] were deployed to Somalia on 2 April 2017 to improve the capabilities of the Somalia Army in combating Islamist militants. AFRICOM stated that the troops will focus on bolstering the Somali army's logistics capabilities; an AFRICOM spokesman said that "This mission is not associated with teaching counterextremism tactics" and that the Somali government requested the training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stripes.com/news/middle-east/2.1198/101st-airborne-troops-deploy-to-somalia-for-training-mission-1.463504#.WPaKo_WcGUm|title=101st Airborne troops deploy to Somalia for training mission|publisher=Stars and Stripes|date=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They advanced deep into Gedo region in the direction of the towns of Beledehawa and Elwak, accompanied by militia of pro-Ethiopian, Somali fraction leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.golisnews.com/other-links/the-scramble-for-somalia/ |title=The Scramble for Somalia &amp;#124; Golis News |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=2017-10-22 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101211021859/http://www.golisnews.com/other-links/the-scramble-for-somalia/ |archivedate=11 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hiraan, Ethiopian forces which entered along with TFG-forces exchanged fire with al-Shabaab militants and advanced until the Kalaber junction, near Beledweyne. The Ethiopian troops then withdrew to Ferfer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-08-27/world/somalia.militants.offensive_1_ethiopian-troops-abdirahman-omar-osman-ethiopian-forces?_s=PM:WORLD | work=CNN | title=Islamist fighters seize Somali government seat | date=26 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 August, there was a second Ethiopian incursion. A large number of Ethiopian forces in military vehicles, accompanied by highly trained TFG forces, entered several villages in al-Shabaab controlled Hiraan region. This came at a time when al-Shabaab militants regularly ventured near the border. Hussein Abdallah, an ASWJ loyalist claimed that the movements were a preliminary action to signal that Ethiopian authorities are able of weakening the Islamist insurgents, to al-Shabaab's leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiiraan.com/news2/2010/aug/ethiopia_troops_in_somalia_to_battle_radicals.aspx |title=Ethiopia troops in Somalia to battle radicals |publisher=Hiiraan.com |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September, Ethiopian forces moved deeper into Gedo region, via Dolow, entering the TFG-held village of Yeed. TFG officials in the region reported they were planning to capture the entire Bay and Bakool regions from al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name="Ethi"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716071740/http://www.simbanews.com/simba2010/english7/01sep_news003.htm Ethiopian troops cross into Somalia again], 1 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 December, TFG forces clashed with Ethiopian troops in the Jawil district, near Beledweyne, after Ethiopian forces took a TFG soldier into custody. One TFG soldier and one civilian were injured in the clashes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201012300419.html |title=Somalia: Govt Forces, Ethiopian Military Clash in Central Region |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=30 December 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2011====
3 January, Ahlu Sunna Waljamaa official [[Sheikh Abdi Badel Sheikh Abdullahi]], complained about Ethiopian forces in the town of Dolo, in Gedo region. The town is controlled by 300 ASWJ and TFG forces, but it is also home to several Ethiopian military bases. Ethiopian forces had called on ASWJ fighters in the district to lay down their arms. According to a TFG official, three Ethiopian commanders had then come to the town of Dolo and ordered TFG forces to disarm. Ethiopian troops then disarmed a number of TFG and ASWJ forces. Sheikh Abdullahi alleged that Ethiopian forces were doing this because they were outraged by ASWJ's military capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201101030695.html|title=Somalia: Moderate Ahlu Sunna Complain of Ethiopian Forces|publisher=allAfrica.com|date=3 January 2011|accessdate=20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shabelle.net/article.php?id=1613 |title=Somalia: Moderate Ahlu Sunna complain of Ethiopian forces |publisher=Shabelle |date=3 November 2010 |accessdate=20 April 2011 }}{{Dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November, eyewitness reported large number of Ethiopian troops crossing into Somalia. Ethiopian authorities denied this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15807215|work=[[BBC News]]|title=Ethiopian troops 'cross border into Somalia'|author=Will Ross|date=19 November 2011|accessdate=20 November 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120112905/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15807215|archivedate=20 November 2011|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After a multinational conference held on 25 November in [[Addis Ababa]], IGAD announced that the Ethiopian government had agreed to support the allied forces' campaign against Al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name="Eatbsaois"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-27/ethiopia-agrees-to-back-somalia-army-operations-igad-says.html|title=Ethiopia Agrees to Back Somalia Army Operations, IGAD Says|date=27 November 2011|work=[[Businessweek]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111129011203/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-11-27/ethiopia-agrees-to-back-somalia-army-operations-igad-says.html|archivedate=29 November 2011|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 December 2011, the Transitional Federal Government soldiers and around 3,000 allied Ethiopian army troops attacked [[Beledweyne]] in the early morning, capturing it after hours of fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16372453|title=Ethiopian troops capture Beledweyne from Somalia militants|work=BBC News|accessdate=31 December 2011|date=31 December 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231173743/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16372453|archivedate=31 December 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later took control of [[Baidoa]], among other areas.

====2012====
On 22 October 2012, the Spokesman of [[African Union Mission to Somalia]] (AMISOM) Col. Ali Aden Humed speaking to journalists in Mogadishu on Saturday said that Ethiopian forces present in parts of the regions of Somalia will soon pull out from the country.
The spokesman said AMISOM troops will take over the areas where Ethiopian forces are holding at the moment. "The plan by AMISOM is to take over the positions held by Ethiopian forces in parts of the regions of the country, Ethiopian troops will soon retreat back to their position along Somalia border" said Col. Ali Aden Humed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somaliamediamonitoring.org/october-22-2012-daily-monitoring-report/ |title=October 22, 2012 &amp;#124; Daily Monitoring Report. - AMISOM Daily Media Monitoring |publisher=Somaliamediamonitoring.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013====
In 2013, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom announced that Ethiopian troops were pulling out of Baidoa as the situation on the ground was relatively stable and the Somali military and AMISOM forces were now able to assume security duties. The withdrawal was well planned and coordinated. Adhanom added that a pullout could have occurred twelve months earlier, but the allied forces were at the time unprepared to take over, so the move was postponed. Additionally, he asserted that Eritrea was attempting to destabilize Somalia and environs, and that the international community should take the situation seriously since Eritrea was also still allegedly supporting Al-Shabaab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201307231513.html|title= Ethiopia - No Plan for Full Troops Withdrawal From Somalia|work=allAfrica.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Westgate shopping mall attack|Westgate shooting]] in Nairobi by Al Shabaab operatives, the Ethiopian government halted its plans to withdraw completely out of Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africadaily.net/reports/Ethiopia_says_no_plans_to_withdraw_troops_from_Somalia_999.html|title=Ethiopia says no plans to withdraw troops from Somalia|work=africadaily.net|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013, the Ethiopian government announced that it would integrate its troops that are deployed in Somalia into the AMISOM multinational force. Somalia's Foreign Minister Fowzia Haji Yussuf welcomed the decision, stating that the move would galvanize AMISOM's campaign against the insurgent group. She also emphasized the importance of collaboration between Somalia and Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dalsanradio.com/articles/2197/Somali-government-welcomes-Ethiopia-AMISOM-integration|title=Somali government welcomes Ethiopia AMISOM integration|publisher=|accessdate=9 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223116/http://dalsanradio.com/articles/2197/Somali-government-welcomes-Ethiopia-AMISOM-integration|archivedate=2 December 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ethiopian authorities' announcement came a month after a failed October bombing attempt by Al-Shabaab in the Ethiopian capital of [[Addis Ababa]], and a week after Ethiopia received a renewed terrorism threat from the insurgent group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2013/10/ethiopia-al-shabab-hit-list-201310211211366477.html|title=Is Ethiopia on al-Shabab's hit list?|author=Jacey Fortin|work=aljazeera.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Ambassador Dina Mufti, the Ethiopian military's decision to join AMISOM is intended to render the peacekeeping operation more secure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201311131037.html|title= Somalia: Ethiopia Decides to Join Amisom Force in Somalia|work=allAfrica.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysts also suggested that the move was primarily motivated by financial considerations, with the Ethiopian forces' operational costs now slated to be under AMISOM's allowance budget. It is believed that the Ethiopian military's long experience in Somali territory, its equipment such as helicopters, and the potential for closer coordination will help the allied forces advance their territorial gains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hiiraan.com/news4/2013/Nov/52023/somali_war_expertise_and_superior_combat_kits_to_boost_anti_terror_campaign.aspx|title=Somali war expertise and superior combat kits to boost anti-terror campaign|work=hiiraan.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, there is a certain amount of unease following Ethiopia's entry into AMISOM given local animosity originating from Ethiopia's heavy handed intervention in 2006. There are also fears that Al Shabaab could use Somali animosity towards Ethiopia as a rallying cry and to recruit more members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/02/201422122028512719.html|title=Somalis balk at plans for Ethiopian troops|author=Malkhadir Muhumed|work=aljazeera.com|accessdate=29 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also believed that some Ethiopian troops in Somalia operate independently from AMISOM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Somalia unrest: Baidoa raid 'leaves eight dead'|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-31849530?print=true|publisher=BBC|accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2014====
In December 2014, the Ethiopian government offered to replace the last AMISOM contingent from Sierra Leone with fresh Ethiopian military reinforcements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/ethiopia-says-ready-boost-somalia-troops-sleone-exit-191409286.html|title=Ethiopia says ready to boost Somalia troops after SLeone exit|date=22 December 2014|work=Yahoo News|accessdate=26 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2015====
In 2015, the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), announced a new military operation against Al Shabaab, for removing it in the last strong holds in Somalia. The operation involved Ethiopian National Defence and [[Kenya]] Defence Forces too.

At the end of the month of July 2015, [[AMISOM]] and [[Somalia]] National Army regained many villages and major towns of [[Bardera|Baardhere]] and [[Dinsoor]].&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

===Kenya===

====Recruitment from Kenya====
According to press reports, Somali and Kenyan government officials have recruited and trained Somali refugees in Kenya and Kenyan nationals who are ethnic Somalis to fight insurgents in Somalia. However, the Somali chief of military staff and spokesmen from the Kenyan government have denied this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsday.com/news/world/ap-impact-kenyans-recruited-to-fight-in-somalia-1.1591947 |title=AP IMPACT: Kenyans recruited to fight in Somalia |work=Associated Press via Newsday |date=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010 Kenya-Al-Shabaab border clash====
{{Main article|2010 Kenya–Al-Shabaab border clash}}
On 20 July 2010 border clashes between Kenya and Al-Shabaab insurgents occurred when gunmen from the militia attacked a Kenyan border patrol along the border area in [[Liboi]], [[Lagdera Constituency|Lagdera]]. There was a subsequent fierce exchange of fire between the two sides leading to the deaths of 2 militia and the wounding of one Kenyan officer.&lt;ref name=reuters&gt;Ali, Noor.[https://af.reuters.com/article/kenyaNews/idAFLDE66J1TM20100720?pageNumber=1&amp;virtualBrandChannel=0&amp;sp=true 2 Kenyan forces, al-Shabaab rebels clash on border], Reuters, 20 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Hundreds of security personnel were later deployed to the border following the clash and because of continued fighting between two militia groups in the neighbouring town of Dobley, Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120329115547/http://www.standardmedia.co.ke/InsidePage.php?id=2000014901&amp;cid=4&amp;ttl=Border%20security%20intensified%20as%20rival%20militias%20clash Border security intensified as rival militias clash], The Standard, 29 July 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Al-Shabaab had previously claimed responsibility for a deadly suicide bombing in [[July 2010 Kampala attacks|Uganda in July]].&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;

'''St Giles' Fair''' (also '''St Giles Fair''') is an annual fair held in [[St Giles', Oxford|St Giles']], a wide thoroughfare in central north [[Oxford]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxford.openguides.org/wiki/?St._Giles%27_Fair St. Giles' fair], [http://oxford.openguides.org/ The Oxford Guide].&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the fair can be traced back to medieval times where it became one of England's dynamic trading centers. The fair has survived medieval times and is organised for a two-day duration in September each year&lt;ref name="petch"&gt;{{cite web |first=Alison |last=Petch |url=http://england.prm.ox.ac.uk/englishness-st-giles-fair.html |title=Calendar related artefacts: St Giles Fair |work=England: The Other Within |publisher=[[Pitt Rivers Museum]] |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
by the [[Oxford City Council]] with the London and Home Counties section of the [[Showmen's Guild of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="nfa-oxford"&gt;[http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/history/charter/oxford.html Oxford St. Giles] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821143947/http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/history/charter/oxford.html |date=21 August 2009}}, [http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/ National Fairground Archive], [[The University of Sheffield]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===A dynamic medieval trading place===
The earliest reference for the fair is from The Session Rolls of James I, and the origins of the fair related to [[St Giles' Church, Oxford|St Giles' Church]] at the north end of St Giles (Oxford, Oxfordshire)'.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Leslie Wood, [http://www.st-giles-church.org/History.htm St Giles' Oxford: Yesterday and Today — The Story of the Parish of St Giles'] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130113064052/http://www.st-giles-church.org/History.htm |date=2013-01-13 }}, June 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; This was originally completed in 1120, but the church was not actually consecrated until 1200, by [[St Hugh of Lincoln]], a [[Carthusian]] monk and bishop. As part of the commemoration of the consecration, St Giles' Fair was established. The fair was parted between the `college' and the `city' side, with the college side tracing its rights to the fair from the Manor of Walton. 

The medieval fair was held in [[Walton Manor]], where it took place in the St Giles' churchyard on St Giles Day and during the following week.&lt;ref name="nfa-oxford"/&gt; There were also various pleasant traditions, such as anyone with a beershop was allowed to bring barrels of beer to St Giles' Fair for sale.&lt;ref name="nfa-stgiles"&gt;[http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/history/shows/giles.html The Story of St. Giles and the Show], [http://www.nfa.dept.shef.ac.uk/ National Fairground Archive], [[The University of Sheffield]], UK.&lt;/ref&gt; Another custom was that any householder in St Giles itself could sell beer and spirits during the fair by hanging the bough of a tree over their front door.

===A popular annual event===
The fair had [[Queen Elizabeth I]] stayed in Oxford between 3–10 September 1567 and watched the fair from the windows of [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] on the east side of St Giles'. It evolved from the St Giles' parish wake, first recorded in 1624, and which became known as St Giles' Feast.&lt;ref name="petch"/&gt; In the 1780s, it was a toy fair, with cheap items for sale. By 1800, it had become a more general fair with stalls and rides. From the 1830s, the fair included adult amusements and it became more rowdy, so much so that there were calls for it to be closed.

[[File:St Giles’ Fair, Oxford, 1905.jpg|thumb|The fair in 1905, photographed by [[Henry Taunt]]]]
By the [[Victorian era]], with train travel excursions becoming available, the fair was attracting people from places as far away as [[Birmingham]] and [[Cardiff]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In 1930 Oxford's city corporation, now the [[Oxford City Council]], took over the running of the fair. In the 1930s the poet [[John Betjeman]] described the fair as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''It is about the biggest fair in England. The whole of St Giles' and even [[Magdalen Street]] by [[Elliston and Cavell's]] right up to and beyond the War Memorial, at the meeting of the [[Woodstock Road (Oxford)|Woodstock]] and [[Banbury Road|Banbury]] roads, is thick with [[freak show]]s, [[Carousel|roundabouts]], [[Cakewalk (carnival game)|cake-walks]], [[The Whip (ride)|the whip]], and the [[Witching Waves|witching waves]].''&lt;ref name="petch"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fair continues to this day, nowadays as a [[funfair]], held on the Monday and Tuesday after the Sunday following 1 September, which is [[St Giles' Day]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.st-giles-church.org/fair.htm St Giles' Fair] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120911004515/http://www.st-giles-church.org/fair.htm |date=11 September 2012}}, [http://www.st-giles-church.org/ St Giles' Church].&lt;/ref&gt; It is unusual for an English fair, being held in a major street of a city and blocking traffic for its two-day duration in September each year.&lt;ref name="petch"/&gt;
It is organised by the [[Oxford City Council]] with the London and Home Counties section of the [[Showmen's Guild of Great Britain]].&lt;ref name="nfa-oxford"/&gt;

The street is closed to traffic for two days each September for this traditional fair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.headington.org.uk/oxon/stgiles/fair/ St Giles' Fair] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060522084223/http://www.headington.org.uk/oxon/stgiles/fair/ |date=2006-05-22 }}, [http://www.headington.org.uk/oxon/ Oxford History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060515200959/http://www.headington.org.uk/oxon/ |date=2006-05-15 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Formerly, the [[University Parks]] were also closed at the same time to show that they are owned by the [[University of Oxford]] rather than formally being public. The fair also extends into [[Magdalen Street]] to the south and [[Banbury Road]] and [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]] to the north.

'''''Swooner Crooner''''' is a 1944 ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' cartoon directed by [[Frank Tashlin]]. The cartoon was nominated for the 1945 Academy Award for Best Short Subject (Cartoons), which it lost to the ''[[Tom and Jerry]]'' cartoon "[[Mouse Trouble]]".&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1945&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Porky Pig is the supervisor of the "Flockheed Eggcraft Factory", where dozens of hens lay eggs for the war effort (in this case, World War II). The hens suddenly get distracted from their egg laying when a handsome rooster named Frankie (who sings like [[Frank Sinatra]]) is heard singing outside. Frankie's renditions of "It Can't Be Wrong" by Dick Haymes and "As Time Goes By" (from ''Casablanca'', 1942) causes all the hens to swoon.

Porky rushes to investigate. Soon, he is auditioning for a new crooner; those showing up are rooster caricatures of [[Nelson Eddy]] &lt;ref name=IMDb/&gt; ("Shortnin' Bread"), [[Al Jolson]] ("September in the Rain"), [[Jimmy Durante]] ("Lullaby of Broadway"), [[Cab Calloway]] ("Minnie the Moocher", "Blues in the Night"), and [[Bing Crosby]] ("When My Dream Boat Comes Home").&lt;ref name=IMDb&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0037339/soundtrack IMDb soundtrack listing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Porky asks the Bing Crosby rooster (who introduced himself as "The Old Groaner") to be the crooner, provoking a competition with Frankie. Between the two of them, the overexcited hens' egg production is increased to a level beyond what Porky can handle, including a just-hatched hen chick laying an egg many times her own size.

Surveying literal hills and mountains of eggs all over his farm, Porky is impressed and asks the two roosters, "How did you ever m-m-make 'em lay all those eggs." The roosters demonstrate their technique by crooning at Porky, who lays a mountainful of eggs himself as a result.

==Notes==
*"Swooner Crooner" is the first ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' entry to be re-released into the [[List of Warner Bros. cartoons with Blue Ribbon reissues|Blue Ribbon]] program. It was re-released on February 12, 1949 with the original opening, credits, and closing titles replaced. 
*This is the only Blue Ribbon re-release as a ''Looney Tunes'' short to keep the original Porky Pig drum ending music. The original ending music was later replaced with the 1995 Turner print, which changed it to the 1941-55 rendition of ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (song)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', which the DVD sets use as the source of the soundtrack. Later ''Looney Tunes'' re-releases that originally had the Porky Pig drum ending would have their ending music changed to the 1941-55 rendition of ''Merrily We Roll Along'' by default.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5734">A '''tertulia''' ({{IPA-es|teɾˈtulja|lang}}; {{IPA-gl|teɾˈtulja|lang}}; {{lang-pt|tertúlia}} {{IPA-pt|tɨɾˈtuliɐ|}}; {{lang-ca|tertúlia}} {{IPA-ca|təɾˈtuliə|}}) is a social gathering with literary or artistic overtones, especially in [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]] or in [[Latin America]]. Tertulia also means an informal meeting of people to talk about current affairs, arts, etc. The word is originally [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (borrowed by [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]), but it has only moderate currency in English, used mainly in describing Latin cultural contexts.

==Format==

A tertulia is rather similar to a [[salon (gathering)|salon]], but a typical tertulia in recent centuries has been a regularly scheduled event in a public place such as a bar, although some tertulias are held in more private spaces, such as someone's living room. Participants, known as ''contertulios'', may share their recent creations such as [[poetry]], [[short stories]], other writings, and even artwork or songs. Usually, but not always, the participants in a regularly scheduled tertulia are in some respects like-minded, with similar political or literary tastes.{{fact|date=December 2017}}

==Etymology==
[[Philip II of Spain]], in the 16th century, was very interested in the ancient world and its cultures. Within his court, he employed [[polymath]]s such as [[Juan de Mal Lara]] to compose poetry to accompany [[artwork]]s which enriched his various palaces. Of great interest to the king were the works of the Christian author [[Tertullian|Quintus Septimius Florens Tertullianus]]. Courtiers and academics would gather to discuss such works with their royal patron, and so ''tertulia'' emerged as a term for learned discussion.{{sfn|Etimología de Tertulia}}

==In the Spanish colonies==

At ''tertulias'' before 1810 in at the houses of  [[Buenos Aires]] society women such as [[Mercedes de Lasalde Riglos]], [[Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson]] and [[Flora Azcuénaga]] the discussions led up to the [[May Revolution]], the first stage in the struggle for Argentine independence from Spain.{{sfn|Ellas también hicieron el 25 de Mayo}}
"Madame Riglos" could be seen as the chief lady of the Tory (conservative) faction in Buenos Aires.
She was sparkling and familiar, although highly aristocratic.{{sfn|Galasso|1994|p=35}}
Doña Melchora de Sarratea, queen of fashion and of the Buenos Aires salons, was so well aware of public and private affairs that she was held to be an enthusiastic supporter of Whig (liberal) principles.{{sfn|Galasso|1994|p=35}}
Mariquita Sánchez de Thompson's forte was foreign relations.{{sfn|Galasso|1994|p=36}}
Similar ''tertulias'' were being held during this period in [[Lima]], Peru, by women such as Manuela Rábago de Avellafuertes de Riglos and Narcisa Arias de Saavaedra.{{sfn|Davies|Brewster|Owen|2006|p=32}}

[[:es:José Antonio Wilde|José Antonio Wilde]] (1813–87) described Buenos Aires in the period immediately following independence.
He wrote that it was a widespread custom among the more notable and well-to-do families, and also with many decent families, to give ''tertulias'' at least once a week.
Usually the guests danced only from 8:00 to 12:00 at night, in which case only [[Mate (drink)|mate]] was served, but if it went on later chocolate would be added.
Dress was not elaborate, and dancing, music and conversation were the only entertainment, so the cost was low.
A piano player might be hired, or the young people might play dance pieces, or some old and complacent aunt might play some [[contradanza]].
Even if it was old, the thing was to dance.{{sfn|Wilde|1908}}

'''''Thunderbirds''''' is a British science-fiction television series created by [[Gerry Anderson|Gerry]] and [[Sylvia Anderson]], filmed by their production company [[AP Films]] (APF) and distributed by [[ITC Entertainment]]. It was produced between 1964 and 1966 using a form of electronic [[marionette]] puppetry (dubbed "[[Supermarionation]]") combined with [[scale model]] special effects sequences. Two series were filmed, comprising a total of thirty-two 50-minute episodes; production ceased following the completion of the second series' sixth episode when [[Lew Grade]], the Andersons' financial backer, failed in his efforts to sell the programme to American network television.

Set in the mid-2060s, ''Thunderbirds'' is a follow-up to the earlier Supermarionation productions ''[[Four Feather Falls]]'', ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'', ''[[Fireball XL5]]'' and ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]]''. It follows the exploits of International Rescue (IR), a life-saving organisation equipped with technologically-advanced land, sea, air and space rescue craft; these are headed by a fleet of five vehicles named the [[Thunderbirds machines|''Thunderbirds'']] and launched from IR's secret base in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The main characters are ex-astronaut [[Jeff Tracy]], the founder of IR, and his five adult sons, who pilot the ''Thunderbird'' machines.

''Thunderbirds'' began its first run in the United Kingdom on the [[ITV network]] in 1965 and has since been broadcast in at least 66 other countries.&lt;ref name="Mitchell"/&gt; Periodically repeated, it was adapted for radio in the early 1990s and has influenced many TV programmes and other media. As well as inspiring [[Thunderbirds merchandise|various merchandising campaigns]], the series has been followed by two feature-length film sequels (''[[Thunderbirds Are Go]]'' and ''[[Thunderbird 6]]'', released in 1966 and 1968 respectively), [[Thunderbirds (2004 film)|a 2004 live-action film adaptation]] and a mimed stage show tribute. The second of two TV remakes, the computer-animated ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go (TV series)|Thunderbirds Are Go]]'', premiered in 2015, in honour of the original show's 50th anniversary.&lt;ref name="TBAG Premiere"/&gt;

Widely considered to be the Andersons' most popular and commercially successful series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/442090/|title=''Thunderbirds'' (1965–66)|author=Clark, Anthony|work=[[Screenonline]]|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|location=London, UK|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530232412/http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/442090|archivedate=30 May 2014|deadurl=no|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor and Trim, 71"/&gt; ''Thunderbirds'' has received particular praise for its effects (directed by [[Derek Meddings]]) and musical score (composed by [[Barry Gray]]).&lt;ref name="Sangster and Condon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomas, 24"/&gt; It is also well remembered for its [[title sequence]], which opens with an often-quoted countdown by actor [[Peter Dyneley]] (who voiced the character of Jeff): "5, 4, 3, 2, 1: ''Thunderbirds'' Are Go!"&lt;ref name="O'Brien, 83"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knowles"/&gt; A real-life rescue service, the [[International Rescue Corps]], is named after the organisation featured in the series.

==Premise==
{{Main article|List of Thunderbirds episodes}}
Set between 2065 and 2067,&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;42 and 95.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thunderbirds'' follows the exploits of the Tracy family, headed by American ex-astronaut turned multi-millionaire philanthropist [[Jeff Tracy]]. He is a widower with five adult sons: [[Scott Tracy|Scott]], [[John Tracy (Thunderbirds)|John]], [[Virgil Tracy|Virgil]], [[Gordon Tracy|Gordon]] and [[Alan Tracy|Alan]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Listed by age, in descending order, as stated in Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;53–57. According to Marriott 1993, pp.&amp;nbsp;116–117, Virgil is the second-oldest son and John the third-oldest.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tracys form International Rescue (IR), a secret organisation dedicated to saving human life. They are aided in this mission by technologically advanced land, sea, air and space vehicles, which are called into service when conventional rescue techniques prove ineffective. The most important of these are five machines named the "''Thunderbirds''", each assigned to one of the five Tracy brothers:

*''[[Thunderbird 1]]'': a [[hypersonic]] rocket plane used for fast response and accident zone reconnaissance. Piloted by primary rescue co-ordinator Scott Tracy.
*''[[Thunderbird 2]]'': a [[supersonic]] carrier aircraft that transports [[Thunderbird 2 pod vehicles|rescue vehicles and equipment]] to accident zones in detachable capsules known as "pods". Piloted by Virgil.
*''[[Thunderbird 3]]'': a [[single-stage-to-orbit]] spacecraft. Piloted alternately by Alan and John, with Scott as co-pilot.
*''[[Thunderbird 4]]'': a utility [[submersible]]. Piloted by Gordon and normally launched from ''Thunderbird 2''.
*''[[Thunderbird 5]]'': a [[space station]] that relays distress calls from around the world. Manned alternately by "space monitors" John and Alan.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005: vehicle descriptions, pp.&amp;nbsp;45–49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bleathman, Graham|title=Thunderbirds FAB Cross-Sections: Exposing the Secrets of the Craft, Machinery and Headquarters of International Rescue|year=2000|publisher=[[Carlton Books]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-1-84222-091-7|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the engineer [[Brains (Thunderbirds)|Brains]] and [[Grandma Tracy|Jeff's elderly mother]],&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 95"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Malaysian manservant [[Kyrano]] and his daughter [[Tin-Tin Kyrano|Tin-Tin]] (who serves as Brains' assistant), the family reside in a luxurious villa on [[Tracy Island]],&lt;ref group="Note" name="Names"&gt;The names "Tracy Island" and "Hood" are not used in the TV series, appearing only in tie-in media.&lt;/ref&gt; their hidden base in the [[South Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;44.&lt;/ref&gt; In this location, IR is safe from criminals and spies who envy the organisation's technology and seek to acquire the secrets of its machines.

Despite its humanitarian principles, some of IR's operations are necessitated not by misadventure but deliberate sabotage motivated by greed for power and wealth. For missions that require criminal investigation, the organisation incorporates a network of undercover agents headed by English aristocrat [[Lady Penelope Creighton-Ward]] and her butler [[Aloysius Parker]]. Based at [[Creighton-Ward Mansion]] in Kent, Penelope and Parker's primary mode of transport is [[FAB 1]], a specially-modified [[List of Rolls-Royce motor cars|Rolls-Royce]]. The most persistent of IR's adversaries is the criminal known only as the "[[Hood (Thunderbirds)|Hood]]".&lt;ref group="Note" name="Names"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;61.&lt;/ref&gt; Operating from a temple in the Malaysian jungle, and possessing abilities of hypnosis and [[dark magic]], he exerts a powerful telepathic control over Kyrano, his estranged half-brother, and manipulates the Tracys into missions that unfold according to his nefarious designs. This allows him to spy on the ''Thunderbird'' machines and, by selling their secrets, make himself rich.

I was thinking, 'Rescue, yes, rescue, but how to make it science fiction? What about an international rescue organisation?'|source=&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[Gerry Anderson]] on the premise&lt;ref name="Bentley, 8-9"&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;|align=right|salign=right|width=30%}}

''Thunderbirds'' was the fourth Supermarionation puppet TV series to be produced by APF, which was founded by the husband-and-wife duo of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson (née Thamm) with their business partners [[Arthur Provis]], [[Reg Hill]], and [[John Read (producer)|John Read]]. Pitched in late 1963, the series was commissioned by Lew Grade of ITC, APF's parent company, on the back of the positive audience response to ''[[Stingray (1964 TV series)|Stingray]].''&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 95"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerry Anderson drew inspiration for the series' underlying concept from the [[West German]] mining disaster known as the ''[[Wunder von Lengede]]'' ("Miracle of Lengede"). In October 1963, the collapse of a nearby dam flooded an iron mine in the municipality of [[Lengede]], killing 29 miners and trapping 21 others underground.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking the means to drill an escape shaft, the authorities were forced to requisition a heavy-duty bore from [[Bremen]]; despite the considerable time necessary to transport the bore by rail significantly reducing the chances of a successful rescue, 11 of the trapped miners were eventually saved.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;/ref&gt; Recognising the advantages of swifter crisis response, Anderson conceived the idea of an "international rescue" organisation that could use supersonic aircraft to transport specialised rescue equipment quickly over long distances.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 8-9"/&gt;

Seeking to distinguish his 26-episode proposal from APF's earlier productions, Anderson attempted to pitch stories at a level that would appeal to both adults and children. Whereas previous series had been shown during the late afternoon, Anderson wanted ''Thunderbirds'' to be broadcast in a family-friendly [[primetime]] slot.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 12"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; Sylvia remembers that "our market had grown and a 'kidult' show&amp;nbsp;... was the next step."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; The Andersons retired to their holiday villa in Portugal to expand the premise, script the pilot episode and compose a [[Bible (writing)|scriptwriters' guide]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 106"/&gt; According to Sylvia, the writing process depended on a "division of labour", whereby Gerry created the action sequences while she managed [[characterisation]].&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 106"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to make a father and his sons the main characters was influenced by the premise of ''[[Bonanza]]'', as well as Sylvia's belief that the use of more than one heroic character would broaden the series' appeal.&lt;ref name="Anderson, 31"&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cull: Media, 202"&gt;Cull 2006 (August), p.&amp;nbsp;202.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tracy brothers were named after [[Mercury Seven]] astronauts: [[Scott Carpenter]], [[John Glenn]], [[Gus Grissom|Virgil "Gus" Grissom]], [[Gordon Cooper]] and [[Alan Shepard]].&lt;ref name="BentleyCharacterBiographies"/&gt;

The series' title was derived from a letter written by Gerry's brother, Lionel, while he had been serving overseas as an [[RAF]] flight sergeant during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 13"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt; While stationed in Arizona, Lionel had made reference to [[Thunderbird Field No. 1|Thunderbird Field]], a nearby [[United States Army Air Forces]] base.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 111"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt; Drawn to the "punchiness" of "''Thunderbirds''", Anderson dropped his [[working title]] of "''International Rescue''" and renamed both the series and IR's rescue vehicles, which had previously been designated ''Rescues 1'' to ''5''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 13"/&gt; His inspiration for the launch sequences of ''Thunderbirds 1'', ''2'' and ''3'' originated from contemporary [[United States Air Force]] launch procedure: Anderson had learnt how the [[Strategic Air Command]] would keep its pilots on permanent standby, seated in the cockpits of their aircraft and ready for take-off at a moment's notice.&lt;ref name="Cull: Media, 198"&gt;Cull 2006 (August), p.&amp;nbsp;198.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the DVD documentary ''The Thunderbirds Companion'', Anderson explained how a rise in filming costs had made overseas distribution revenue even more important and essentially caused ''Thunderbirds'' to be made "as an American show".&lt;ref name="MakingSecrets"&gt;{{Cite AV media|people=Meyers, Simon; Middleton, Guy (producers)|year=2000|title=Thunderbirds: The Making of the Secrets|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Carlton Communications|Carlton International Media]]|location=London, UK|asin=B0002475OI|time=05:22–06:22}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the character development and voice casting process, the Andersons' main priority was to ensure that the series had [[Transatlantic relations|transatlantic]] appeal, thus increasing the chances of winning an American network deal and the higher audience figures that this market had to offer.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bignell, 81"&gt;Bignell, p.&amp;nbsp;81.&lt;/ref&gt; Scripts were typed in American English and printed on US-style [[Bookbinding#Terms and techniques|quarto-size]] paper.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p.&amp;nbsp;82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
''Thunderbirds'' was filmed at APF's studios on the [[Slough Trading Estate]] between 1964 and 1966.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 22"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;/ref&gt; In preparation, the number of full-time crew was expanded to 100.&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt; Shooting began in September 1964 after five months of pre-production.&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 16"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;16.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the new series' technical complexity, this was a period longer than for any of APF's earlier productions.&lt;ref&gt;La Rivière, pp.&amp;nbsp;110–111.&lt;/ref&gt; To speed up the filming, episodes were shot in pairs, at a rate of one per month, on separate [[soundstage]]s and by separate crews (designated "A" and "B").&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;23 and 36.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1964, APF was the UK's largest commercial user of colour film, consuming more than three million feet (570&amp;nbsp;miles or 910&amp;nbsp;kilometres) of stock per year.&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p.&amp;nbsp;85.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Pattillo]], a longtime scriptwriter and director for APF, was appointed the company's first official [[script editor]] in late 1964.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 24"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt; This move was aimed to reduce the burden on Gerry Anderson who, while reserving his producer's right to overall creative control, had grown weary of revising scripts himself.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 25"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cull 2006 (August), p.&amp;nbsp;196.&lt;/ref&gt; Direction of episodes was assigned in pairs: veterans Pattillo and [[David Elliott (director)|David Elliott]] alternated with the less-experienced [[Desmond Saunders]] and newcomer [[David Lane (director)|David Lane]] for each month's filming.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 122"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;122.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the difficulties of setting up takes, progress was slow: even on a productive day, it was rare for the crew to complete more than two minutes of puppet footage.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 123"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;123.&lt;/ref&gt; In a contemporary interview, Hill noted that ''Thunderbirds'' contained several times as many shots as a typical live-action series.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 121"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;121.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained that rapid editing was necessary on account of the characters' lack of facial expression, which made it difficult to sustain the viewer's interest for more than a few seconds per shot.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 121"/&gt;

{{Quote box|quote=Lew watched ["Trapped in the Sky"] and at the end he jumped up shouting, 'Fantastic, absolutely fantastic! This isn't a television series – this is a feature film! You've got to make this as an hour!'&amp;nbsp;... I'm glad we did it, because it made the series much bigger and much more important. But it was still a very, very difficult job.|source=&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[Gerry Anderson]] on the format change&lt;ref name="Bentley, 26"/&gt;|salign=right|width=30%}}

After viewing the completed 25-minute pilot, "[[Trapped in the Sky]]",&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 121"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 26"/&gt; Lew Grade was so impressed by APF's work that he instructed Anderson to double the episode length and increased the series' budget per episode from £25,000 to £38,000.&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 26"/&gt; As a result, ''Thunderbirds'' became not only the company's longest and highest-budgeted production, but also among the most expensive TV series to have been made up to that point.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 26"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt; The crew, who had been filming at a rate of two 25-minute episodes per [[fortnight]], faced significant challenges during the transition to the new format: eight episodes had already been completed,&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p.&amp;nbsp;87.&lt;/ref&gt; scripts for up to ten more had been written,&lt;ref name="Bentley, 26"/&gt; and substantial rewrites would be necessary to satisfy the longer running time.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;23 and 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson lamented: "Our time-scale was far too drawn out. ITC's New York office insisted that they should have one show a fortnight&amp;nbsp;... Everything had to move at twice the speed."&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;122.&lt;/ref&gt; APF spent over seven months extending the existing episodes.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 28"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;28.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tony Barwick]], who had impressed Pattillo and the Andersons with an unsubmitted script that he had written for ''[[Danger Man]]'', was recruited to assist in the writing of subplots and [[Filler (media)|filler]] material.&lt;ref&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt; He found that the longer format created opportunities to strengthen the characterisation.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt; Science-fiction writer [[John Peel (writer)|John Peel]] suggests that "small character touches" make the puppet cast of ''Thunderbirds'' "much more rounded" than those of earlier APF series.&lt;ref name="Peel, 14"&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; He compares the writing favourably to that of live-action drama.&lt;ref name="Peel, 14"/&gt; The new footage proved useful during the development of the first series finale, "Security Hazard": since the previous two episodes ("[[Attack of the Alligators!]]" and "[[The Cham-Cham]]") had overspent their budgets, Pattillo devised a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]-dominated [[clip show]] containing only 17 minutes of new material to reduce costs.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 31"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 128"/&gt;

Filming of Series One was completed in December 1965.&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 95"/&gt; A second series was also commissioned late that year and entered production in March 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;31 and 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Barwick became a full-time member of the writing staff and took over the role of script editor from the outgoing Pattillo.&lt;ref&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;264.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 141"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;141.&lt;/ref&gt; The main puppet cast and vehicles were rebuilt;&lt;ref name="Marriott, 187"&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;187.&lt;/ref&gt; in addition, the [[art department]] expanded some of the standing sets, including the Tracy Villa lounge and the ''[[Thunderbird 5]]'' control room.&lt;ref&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;103.&lt;/ref&gt; To accommodate the simultaneous filming of the TV series and ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go]]'', APF purchased two more buildings on the Slough Trading Estate and converted them into new stages.&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;136.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt; As crew and studio space were divided between the two productions, filming of the TV series progressed at half the previous speed, as APF's B crew produced one episode per month.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 36"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;36.&lt;/ref&gt; Filming on ''Thunderbirds Are Go'' was completed by June, allowing A crew to resume work on the series to shoot what would prove to be its penultimate episode, "Ricochet".&lt;ref name="Bentley, 36"/&gt;

Production of ''Thunderbirds'' ended in August 1966 with the completion of the sixth episode of Series Two.&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 37"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;37.&lt;/ref&gt; In February that year, it had been reported that Grade had been unable to sell the series in the United States due to disagreements over timeslots.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 142"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;145.&lt;/ref&gt; In July, he [[Cancellation (television)|cancelled]] ''Thunderbirds'' after failing in his second attempt to secure an American buyer.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 37"/&gt; The three major US networks of the time&amp;nbsp;– [[NBC]], [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]&amp;nbsp;– had all bid for the series, with Grade repeatedly increasing the price. When NBC withdrew its offer, the other two immediately followed.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 37"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Nicholas J.

By the time of its cancellation, ''Thunderbirds'' had become widely popular in the UK and was being distributed extensively overseas.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 125"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;202.&lt;/ref&gt; Grade, however, believed that without the financial boost of an American network sale, a full second series would fail to recover its production costs.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 142"/&gt; He therefore asked Anderson to devise a new concept that he hoped would stand a greater chance of winning over the profitable US market.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 141"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 142"/&gt; This became ''[[Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons]]''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 37"/&gt;

Voice-recording sessions were supervised by Pattillo and the Andersons, with Sylvia Anderson in charge of casting.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 106"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 20"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt; Dialogue was recorded once per month at a rate of two scripts per session.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 117"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporting parts were not pre-assigned, but negotiated by the cast among themselves.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 20"/&gt; Two recordings would be made at each session: one to be converted into electronic pulses for the puppet filming, the other to be added to the soundtrack during post-production.&lt;ref&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; The tapes were edited at Gate Recording Theatre in [[Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;19–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the interest of transatlantic appeal, it was decided that the main characters would be mostly American and therefore actors capable of producing an appropriate accent were used.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 12"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bignell, 81"/&gt; British, Canadian and Australian actors formed most of the voice cast;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 17"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;17.&lt;/ref&gt; the only American involved was stage actor [[David Holliday]], who was noticed in London's [[West End of London|West End]] and given the part of Virgil Tracy.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 18"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the completion of the first series, Holliday returned to the US. The character was voiced by English-Canadian actor [[Jeremy Wilkin]] for ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go]]'', Series Two and ''[[Thunderbird 6]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;

British actor [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]] was among the first to be cast.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; He had previously voiced characters in ''[[Four Feather Falls]]'', ''[[Supercar (TV series)|Supercar]]'', ''[[Fireball XL5]]'' and ''Stingray''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 18"/&gt; Beyond the APF productions, he had supplied one of the original [[Dalek]] voices on ''[[Doctor Who]]''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 18"/&gt; Cast alongside Graham was Australian actor [[Ray Barrett]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 17"/&gt; Like Graham, he had worked for the Andersons before, having voiced Titan and Commander Shore in ''Stingray''.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 116"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;/ref&gt; A veteran of radio drama, Barrett was skilled at performing a range of voices and accents in quick succession.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 17"/&gt; [[Villains of the week]] would typically be voiced by either Barrett or Graham.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 18"/&gt; Aware of the sensitive political climate of the [[Cold War]] and not wishing to "perpetuate the idea that Russia was the enemy with a whole generation of children watching",&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p.&amp;nbsp;94.&lt;/ref&gt; Gerry Anderson decided the Hood (voiced by Barrett) should be Oriental and placed his temple hideout in Malaysia to defy the viewer's expectations.&lt;ref name="Cull: Media, 197"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Lady Penelope and Parker (the latter voiced by Graham) were among the first characters developed, neither was conceived as a major role.&lt;ref name="Anderson, 30"&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 92"&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt; Parker's [[Cockney]] manner was based on a waiter at a pub in [[Cookham]] that was sometimes visited by the crew.&lt;ref name="Archer and Nicholls, 92"/&gt; On Gerry Anderson's recommendation, Graham dined there regularly to study the accent.&lt;ref&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;122.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson's first choice for the role of Penelope had been [[Fenella Fielding]], but Sylvia insisted she take the part herself.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 18"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p.&amp;nbsp;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Her Penelope voice was intended to emulate Fielding and [[Joan Greenwood]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 18"/&gt; On Penelope and Parker's secondary role as [[comic relief]], Gerry explained, "We British can laugh at ourselves, so therefore we had Penelope and Parker as this comedy team. And in America they love the British aristocracy too.'"&lt;ref name="Bignell, 81"/&gt;

As well as Jeff Tracy, English-Canadian actor [[Peter Dyneley]] voiced the recurring character of Commander Norman, chief of air traffic control at London International Airport. His supporting character voices were typically those of upper-class Englishmen.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 117"/&gt; [[Shane Rimmer]], the voice of Scott, was cast on the strength of his performance on the BBC soap opera ''[[Compact (TV series)|Compact]]''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 17"/&gt; Meanwhile, fellow Canadian [[Matt Zimmerman (actor)|Matt Zimmerman]] was selected at a late stage in the process.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 117"/&gt; The expatriate West End actor was given the role of Alan on the recommendation of his friend, Holliday: "They were having great difficulty casting the part of Alan as they wanted a certain sound for him, being the youngest brother. David, who [was] a bit older than I am, told them that he had this friend, me, who would be great."&lt;ref name="Bentley, 19"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christine Finn]], known for her role in the TV serial ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'', provided the voices of Tin-Tin Kyrano and [[Grandma Tracy]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 18"/&gt; With Sylvia Anderson, she was also responsible for voicing most of the female and child supporting characters. Supporting parts were occasionally voiced by [[John Tate (actor)|John Tate]] (the father of ''[[Space: 1999]]'' actor [[Nick Tate]]), [[Paul Maxwell]] and [[Bud Tingwell|Charles Tingwell]]; the latter two joined the cast in Series Two following their contributions to ''Thunderbirds Are Go''. None of these three actors were credited for their performances.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 19"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;351.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and effects===
The puppet stages used for the filming of ''Thunderbirds'' were only one-fifth the size of those used for a standard live-action production, typically measuring {{Convert|12|by|14|by|3|m}} in length, width and height.&lt;ref name="Marriott, 162"&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;75.&lt;/ref&gt; Bob Bell, assisted by [[Keith Wilson (production designer)|Keith Wilson]] and Grenville Nott, headed the art department for Series One.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 114"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt; During the simultaneous filming of Series Two and ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go]]'' in 1966, Bell attended mainly to the film, entrusting [[set design]] for the TV series to Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;35–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since it was necessary for the art department's interior sets to conform to the effects department's exterior plans, each team closely monitored the other's work.&lt;ref name="Anderson, 67"&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sylvia Anderson, Bell's challenge was to produce complex interiors on a limited budget while resisting the effects department's push for "more extravagant" design.&lt;ref name="Anderson, 67"/&gt; This task was complicated by the unnatural proportions of the puppets: Bell struggled to decide whether the sets should be built to a scale proportionate to their bodies or their oversized heads and hands.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 14"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;14.&lt;/ref&gt; He used the example of FAB 1 to illustrate the problem: "As soon as we positioned [the puppets] standing alongside [the model], they looked ridiculous, as the car towered over them."&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 111"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt; He ultimately adopted a "mix-and-match" approach, in which smaller items, such as tableware, were scaled to their hands and furniture to their bodies.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 14"/&gt;

While designing the Creighton-Ward Mansion sets, Bell and his staff strove for authenticity, ordering miniature [[Tudor period|Tudor]] paintings, {{Frac|1|3}}-scale [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]]- and [[Regency architecture|Regency]]-style furniture and carpeting in the shape of a polar bear skin.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 14"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 111"/&gt; This realism was enhanced by adding scrap items acquired from household waste and electronics shops.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 114"/&gt; For example, a vacuum cleaner pipe serves as Virgil Tracy's launch chute.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Puppets====
The head puppet sculptor was [[Christine Glanville]], who also served as the lead puppeteer.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 115"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;/ref&gt; Glanville's four-person team built the 13 members of the main cast in six months at a cost of between £250 and £300 per puppet (approximately £{{Inflation|UK|250|1964|fmt=c|r=-2}} and £{{Inflation|UK|300|1964|fmt=c|r=-2}} in {{Inflation-year|UK}}).&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 15"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; Since pairs of episodes were being filmed simultaneously on separate stages, the characters needed to be sculpted in duplicate.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 23"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;23.&lt;/ref&gt; Facial expressions were diversified by means of replaceable heads: as well as a head with a neutral expression, each main character was given a "smiler", a "frowner" and a "blinker".&lt;ref name="Bentley, 16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;92.&lt;/ref&gt; The finished puppets were approximately {{Convert|22|in|cm}} tall, or {{Frac|1|3}} adult human height.&lt;ref name="Marriott, 162"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Peel, 18"&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The puppets were made up of more than 30 individual components, the most important of which was the [[solenoid]] that synchronised lip movements with the characters' pre-recorded dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;72.&lt;/ref&gt; This device was positioned inside the head unit; consequently, torsos and limbs appeared relatively small.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 111"/&gt; The puppets' likenesses and mechanics are remembered favourably by puppeteer Wanda Brown, who preferred the ''Thunderbirds'' marionettes over the accurately-proportioned ones that first appeared in ''Captain Scarlet'': "The puppets were easier to operate and more enjoyable because they had more character to them&amp;nbsp;... Even some of the more normal-looking faces, such as Scott and Jeff, for me had more character than the puppets in the series that came afterwards."&lt;ref name="Bentley, 15"/&gt; Rimmer speaks positively of the puppets' still being "very much caricatures", since it made them "more lovable and appealing&amp;nbsp;... There was a naive quality about them and nothing too complex."&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The appearances of the main characters were inspired by those of actors and other entertainers, who were typically selected from the show business directory ''[[Spotlight (directory)|Spotlight]]''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 15"/&gt; According to Glanville, as part of a trend away from the strong caricature of previous series, APF was seeking "more natural faces" for the puppets.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 111"/&gt; The face of Jeff Tracy was based on that of [[Lorne Greene]],&lt;ref name="Cull: Media, 202"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 16"/&gt; Scott on [[Sean Connery]],&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 111"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 15"/&gt; Alan on [[Robert Reed]],&lt;ref name="Bentley, 16"/&gt; John on [[Adam Faith]] and [[Charlton Heston]],&lt;ref name="Peel, 19"&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rhema.co.nz/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=6975:thunderbirds-are-go-%E2%80%93-again |title=''Thunderbirds'' Are Go – Again! |date=5 February 2013 |author=Anderson, Anne |work=rhema.co.nz |publisher=[[Rhema Broadcasting Group]] |location=[[Auckland]], New Zealand |accessdate=14 October 2013 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131019223058/http://www.rhema.co.nz/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=6975:thunderbirds-are-go-%E2%80%93-again |archivedate=19 October 2013 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Brains on [[Anthony Perkins]]&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 115"/&gt; and Parker on [[Ben Warriss]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;49.&lt;/ref&gt; Sylvia Anderson brought the character of Penelope to life in likeness as well as voice: after her test moulds were rejected, sculptor Mary Turner decided to use Anderson herself as a template.&lt;ref&gt;La Rivière, pp.&amp;nbsp;108–109.&lt;/ref&gt;

Main character heads were initially sculpted in either [[Plasticine]] or clay. Once the general aspect had been finalised, this served as the template for a [[silicone rubber]] mould.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 16"/&gt; This was coated with Bondaglass ([[fibreglass]] mixed with resin) and enhanced with Bondapaste, a putty-like substance, to accentuate contours.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 115"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marriott, 171"&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;171.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bondaglass shell was then fitted with a solenoid, leather mouth parts and plastic eyes, as well as incisor teeth&amp;nbsp;– a first for a Supermarionation production.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;10 and 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Puppets known as "revamps", which had plastic heads, portrayed the supporting characters.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt; These marionettes started their working lives with only a mouth and eyes; their faces were remoulded from one episode to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;169.&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly striking revamp moulds were retained and, as their numbers increased, photographed to compile an internal casting directory.&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p.&amp;nbsp;97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wigs were made of [[mohair]] or, in the case of the Penelope puppet, human hair.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 16"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 115"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;/ref&gt; Puppet bodies were built in three sizes: "large male" (specifically for the Tracys and the Hood), "small male" and "small female".&lt;ref name="Bentley, 16"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; Sylvia Anderson, the head costume designer, devised the main characters' attire.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;44.&lt;/ref&gt; To give the puppets increased mobility, the costume department generally avoided stiff synthetic materials, instead working with cotton, silk and wool.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 16"/&gt; Between 1964 and 1966, the department's stock numbered more than 700 costumes.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each puppet's head was fitted with about 10 thin [[tungsten steel]] wires.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 115"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p.&amp;nbsp;99.&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming, dialogue was played into the studio using modified tape recorders that converted the feed into electronic pulses.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 20"/&gt; Two of the wires relayed these pulses to the internal solenoid, completing the Supermarionation process.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 20"/&gt; The wires, which were sprayed black to reduce their visibility,&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt; were made even less noticeable through the application of powder paint that matched the background colours of the set.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 23"/&gt; Glanville explained the time-consuming nature of this process: "[The puppeteers] used to spend over half an hour on each shot getting rid of these wires, looking through the camera, puffing a bit more [paint] here, anti-[[Lens flare|flare]] there; and, I mean, it's very depressing when somebody will say to us, 'Of course the wires showed.'"&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 123"/&gt; Positioned on an overhead gantry with a hand-held cruciform, the puppeteers co-ordinated movements with the help of a [[viewfinder]]-powered [[CCTV]] feedback system.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 22"/&gt; As filming progressed, the crew started to dispense with wires and instead manipulate the puppets from the studio floor [[Rod puppet|using rods]].&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p.&amp;nbsp;124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|quote=Since we always tried to minimise walking, we'd show the puppets taking one step only, then promptly cut.

Due to their low weight and the fact that they had only one control wire per leg, the puppets were unable to walk convincingly. Therefore, scenes involving movement were filmed from the waist up, with a puppeteer holding the legs below the level of the camera and using a "bobbing" action to simulate motion.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 128"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peel, 19"/&gt; Alternatively, dynamic shots were eliminated altogether: in an interview with ''[[New Scientist]]'', director of photography John Read spoke of the advantages of circumventing the lack of agility so that the puppets "appear, for example, to walk through doors (although the control wires make this impossible) or pick up a coffee cup (although their fingers are not in fact jointed)."&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;39.&lt;/ref&gt; Live-action shots of human hands were inserted whenever scripts called for more dexterous actions to be performed.&lt;ref name="Peel, 20"&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;20.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Special effects====
The effects for all the APF series from ''Supercar'' to ''[[UFO (TV series)|UFO]]'' were directed by [[Derek Meddings]], who later worked on the ''[[James Bond in film|James Bond]]'' and ''[[Superman in film|Superman]]'' films.&lt;ref&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowing that ''Thunderbirds'' would be the "biggest project [APF] had worked on", Meddings found himself struggling to manage his workload with the single filming unit that had produced all the effects for ''Stingray''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 24"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;104.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore established a second unit under technician [[Brian Johncock]], and a third exclusively for filming airborne sequences.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 24 and 28"&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;24 and 28.&lt;/ref&gt; This expansion increased the number of APF crews and stages to five each.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 24 and 28"/&gt; A typical episode contained around 100 effects shots;&lt;ref name="Bignell, 76"&gt;Bignell, p.&amp;nbsp;76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;40.&lt;/ref&gt; Meddings' team completed up to 18 per day.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;63.&lt;/ref&gt;

An addition to the effects department was [[Mike Trim]], who served as Meddings' assistant in designing vehicles and buildings.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 24"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;60.&lt;/ref&gt; Meddings and Trim jointly pioneered an "organic" design technique in which the exteriors of models and sets were customised with parts from model kits and children's toys.&lt;ref&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor and Trim, p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt; Models and sets were also "dirtied down" with powder paint or [[pencil lead]] to create a used look.&lt;ref name="Andersonic9"&gt;{{Cite journal|date=Spring 2010|title=Interview: Mike Trim – Designs on the Future|journal=Andersonic|volume=1|issue=9|pages=4–12|editor=Farrell, Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;/ref&gt; Toy cars and vans were used in [[long shot]], while scale vehicles were equipped with basic steering and [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] for added realism.&lt;ref&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 107"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;107.&lt;/ref&gt; Miniature fans and [[Jetex]] pellets, which are capable of issuing air jets or chemical exhaust, were attached to the undersides to simulate dust trails.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 25"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 107"/&gt; Another of Meddings' inventions was a closed, cyclical effects stage nicknamed the "rolling road": consisting of two or more loops of canvas running at different speeds, this device allowed shots of moving vehicles to be filmed on a static set to make more efficient use of the limited studio space.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bignell, p.&amp;nbsp;79.&lt;/ref&gt; Airborne aircraft sequences were mounted against a "rolling sky", with smoke fanned across to simulate passing clouds.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 22"/&gt;

[[File:Stourhead House (8349738431).jpg|thumb|Stourhead House, designed in the [[Palladian]] style by [[Colen Campbell]] and completed in 1725, inspired the architecture of [[Creighton-Ward Mansion]].&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 113"/&gt;|alt=A mansion with two adjacent wings, with a gravel drive and lawn in front]]

One of Meddings' first tasks was to shoot [[stock footage]] of the ''Thunderbird'' machines and the series' main locations, Tracy Island and Creighton-Ward Mansion.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 21"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt; The finished island model was a composite of more than a dozen smaller sets that could be detached from the whole and filmed separately.&lt;ref&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;43.&lt;/ref&gt; The architecture of the mansion was based on that of Stourhead House, located on the [[Stourhead|Stourhead Estate]] in Wiltshire.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 113"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of head designer Reg Hill, who was serving as [[associate producer]], Meddings was further tasked with designing the ''Thunderbird'' fleet and FAB 1.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 12"/&gt; Scale models for the six main vehicles were built by a contractor, Master Models of Middlesex.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taylor and Trim, 12"&gt;Taylor and Trim, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt; Models and puppet sets combined, more than 200 versions of the ''Thunderbird'' machines were created for the series.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the designing and filming process, Meddings' first priorities were realism and credibility.&lt;ref&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;44.&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of ''Thunderbird 5'', each vehicle was built in three or four scales.&lt;ref&gt;Archer, p.&amp;nbsp;93.&lt;/ref&gt; Meddings' [[swing-wing]] concept for ''[[Thunderbird 1]]'' was inspired by his wish to create something "more dynamic" than a fixed-wing aircraft.&lt;ref name="Meddings, 45"&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;45.&lt;/ref&gt; He remained unsatisfied with the prototype of ''[[Thunderbird 2]]'' until he inverted the wings, later commenting, "...&amp;nbsp;at the time, all aircraft had swept-back wings. I only did it to be different."&lt;ref name="Bentley, 13"/&gt; This decision was made out of personal preference and was not informed by any expert knowledge on Meddings' part.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 105"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;105.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meddings, 46"&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;46.&lt;/ref&gt; He described the ''Thunderbird 2'' launch as "probably the most memorable" sequence that his team devised for an APF production.&lt;ref name="Meddings, 46"/&gt;

The largest model of ''[[Thunderbird 3]]'', whose design was loosely based on the Soviet ''[[Soyuz (rocket)|Soyuz]]'' rocket, was {{Convert|6|ft|spell=in}} tall.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 13"/&gt; ''[[Thunderbird 4]]'' was particularly difficult to film: as the scale of the model did not correspond to the water inside the shooting tank, creative camera angles and rapid editing were used to produce a sense of realistic perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;52.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thunderbird 5'', the most difficult vehicle for Meddings to visualise, was based on the Tracy Island Round House.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 14"/&gt; Since most of the space station's appearances were provided by stock footage, the model was rarely filmed.&lt;ref&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;58.&lt;/ref&gt; Pod Vehicles were designed on an episode-by-episode basis and built from balsa wood, [[Jelutong]] wood or fibreglass.&lt;ref&gt;Meddings, pp.&amp;nbsp;52 and 54.&lt;/ref&gt; To save time and costs, other minor vehicles were built in-house from radio-controlled model kits.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 13"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Andersonic9"/&gt;

As the puppets of Lady Penelope and Parker needed to fit inside, the largest of all the models was the seven-foot FAB 1, which cost £2,500 (approximately £{{Inflation|UK|2500|1964|r=-3|fmt=c}} in {{inflation-year|UK}}) to build.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rolls-Royce's name and colour were both chosen by Sylvia Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;65.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce Ltd.]] supervised the construction of the plywood model and supplied APF with an authentic [[radiator grille]] for close-up shots of the front of the car.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 106"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;112.&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange for its cooperation, the company requested that a [[Spirit of Ecstasy]] be fixed to the chassis and that the characters avoid referring to the brand with abbreviations such as "Rolls".&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 106"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;66.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hawker Siddeley Gnat T1, UK - Air Force AN2239232.jpg|thumb|left|Some of the aircraft sound effects were created by recording the RAF's [[Red Arrows]] aerobatics display team in flight.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 119"/&gt;|alt=A squadron of one-man jet aircraft, with their canopies open, lined up at a military airbase.]]

Scale explosions were created using substances such as [[fuller's earth]], [[petrol]] gel, magnesium strips and [[Cordtex]] explosive.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 123"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;59.&lt;/ref&gt; They were originally filmed at up to 120 [[frames per second]] (f.p.s.), so that when slowed down to the regular [[24p|24 f.p.s.]], their apparent magnitude and length would be increased.&lt;ref name="MakingSecrets"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marriott, 173"&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;173.&lt;/ref&gt; Gunpowder canisters were ignited to create rocket jets.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 28"/&gt; The wires that electronically fired the rockets also allowed a member of the crew, holding a cruciform and positioned on an overhead gantry, to "fly" the model over the set.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 28"/&gt; By far the most unwieldy model was ''Thunderbird 2'', which Meddings remembered as being "awful" to fly.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 105"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Marriott, 172"&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;172.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of unreliable rockets and weak wiring frequently caused problems: should the former be slow to ignite, the current quickly caused the latter to overheat and snap, potentially damaging the model and even setting fire to the set.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 105"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Meddings, 50"&gt;Meddings, p.&amp;nbsp;50.&lt;/ref&gt; Conditions above the studio floor were often dangerous due to the heat and smoke.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 122"/&gt; Although many of the exhaust sound effects used in the series were drawn from an audio library, some were specially recorded during a [[Red Arrows]] display at [[RAF Little Rissington]] in Gloucestershire.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 119"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1966, Meddings' commitments were split between Series Two and ''Thunderbirds Are Go''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 31"/&gt; While Meddings worked on the film, camera operator Jimmy Elliott assumed the responsibility of directing the TV effects.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; By this stage, the basic frame of ''Thunderbird 2'' had been damaged so many times that the model had needed to be rebuilt from scratch.&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 132"&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;132.&lt;/ref&gt; Meddings was displeased with the result, reflecting that the replacement was "not only the wrong colour, it was a completely different shape&amp;nbsp;... I never felt our model-makers managed to recapture the look of the original."&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 132"/&gt;

Critic David Garland suggests that the challenge facing the ''Thunderbirds'' effects department was to strike a balance between the "conventional science-fiction imperative of the 'futuristic'" and the "seeping hyper-realist concerns mandated by the Andersons' approach to the puppets".&lt;ref&gt;Garland, p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thunderbirds'' has been praised for the quality of its effects. Jim Sangster and Paul Condon, writers of ''Collins Telly Guide'', consider the model work "uniformly impressive".&lt;ref name="Sangster and Condon"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Collins Telly Guide|author1=Sangster, Jim |author2=Condon, Paul |year=2005|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-00-719099-7|pages=758–760}}&lt;/ref&gt; To [[Paul Cornell]], [[Martin Day]] and [[Keith Topping]], writers of ''The Guinness Book of Classic British TV'', the effects are "way beyond anything seen on TV previously".&lt;ref name="Cornell, Day and Topping"&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[Paul Cornell|Cornell, Paul]]; [[Martin Day|Day, Martin]]; [[Keith Topping|Topping, Keith]]|title=The Guinness Book of Classic British TV|editor=Marshall, Anne|year=1996|origyear=1993|edition=2nd|publisher=[[Guinness Publishing]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-85112-628-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed by their work on ''Thunderbirds'', film director [[Stanley Kubrick]] hired several members of Meddings' staff to supervise the effects shooting for ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;143.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;La Rivière, p.&amp;nbsp;139.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Title sequence====
[[File:Gerry Anderson.jpg|thumb|alt=Gerry Anderson|Series co-creator [[Gerry Anderson]] storyboarded the ''Thunderbirds'' [[title sequence]].]]

The series' [[title sequence]], storyboarded by Gerry Anderson, is made up of two parts. It opens with a countdown of "5, 4, 3, 2, 1: ''Thunderbirds'' Are Go!", provided by Dyneley in character as Jeff Tracy.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 121"/&gt; In a departure from the style of ''Stingray'', the ''Thunderbirds'' title sequence varies with each episode: the first part consists of an action montage that serves as a preview of the plot. Simon Archer and Marcus Hearn, biographers of Gerry Anderson, compare this device favourably to a film [[Trailer (promotion)|trailer]].&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 121"/&gt;

The second part, accompanied by composer [[Barry Gray]]'s "The ''Thunderbirds'' March", features portraits of the main puppet cast superimposed on various vehicles and settings.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 121"/&gt; Peel describes this as "ostensibly a return to the 'series stars' concept long known in TV",&lt;ref&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;241.&lt;/ref&gt; while Garland considers such imagery demonstrative of Anderson's commitment to "incremental realism" through a convergence of human and puppet characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Garland, p.&amp;nbsp;66.&lt;/ref&gt; Essayist Jonathan Bignell suggests that the use of portraits conveys Anderson's partiality to "visual revelation of machines and physical action".&lt;ref name="Bignell, 78"&gt;Bignell, p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Daniel O'Brien, writer of ''SF:UK: How British Science Fiction Changed the World'', the ''Thunderbirds'' title sequence encapsulates the reasons for the series' enduring popularity.&lt;ref name="O'Brien, 83"&gt;O'Brien, p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; Dyneley's countdown is particularly well remembered and has been widely quoted.&lt;ref name="Knowles"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations|author=Knowles, Elizabeth|year=2007|edition=3rd|origyear=1991|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|location=New York, US|isbn=978-0-19-920895-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: J-Z|series=The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English|volume=2|author=[[Eric Partridge|Partridge, Eric]]|editor1=Dalzell, Tony|editor2=Victor, Terry|year=2006|publisher=[[Routledge]]|location=[[Abingdon-on-Thames|Abingdon]], UK; New York City, New York|isbn=978-0-415-25938-5|page=1,960}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/thunderbirds-are-go-again-itv-commissions-26-episodes-from-lord-of-the-rings-special-effects-team-8479716.html|title=''Thunderbirds'' Are Go (again)!

The score was composed by Gray, who served as musical director for all of the Anderson productions up to the first series of ''[[Space: 1999]]''. In response to Gerry Anderson's request that the main theme have a "military feel", Gray produced a [[Brass instrument|brass]]-dominated piece titled "The ''Thunderbirds'' March", which was recorded in December 1964 at [[Olympic Studios]] in London.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="LampMusic"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lampmusic.co.uk/downloads/barry_gray_biog.pdf |title=Barry Gray Biography |author=Titterton, Ralph; Ford, Cathy; Bentley, Chris; [[Barry Gray|Gray, Barry]] |work=lampmusic.co.uk |format=[[PDF]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rP7v8Ktg?url=http://www.lampmusic.co.uk/downloads/barry_gray_biog.pdf |archivedate=22 July 2010 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The end titles were originally to have been accompanied by "Flying High", a lyrical track sung by [[Gary Miller (singer)|Gary Miller]] with backing by [[Ken Barrie]].&lt;ref name="La Rivière, 128"/&gt; Ultimately, a variation of the march was used instead.&lt;ref name="LampMusic"/&gt; [[Incidental music]] was recorded over nine months between March and December 1965.&lt;ref name="LampMusic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TVCentury21"&gt;{{Cite web |author=de Klerk, Theo |title=Complete Studio-Recording List of Barry Gray |url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67:complete-studio-recording-list-of-barry-gray&amp;catid=116:barry-gray&amp;Itemid=182 |work=tvcentury21.com |date=25 December 2003 |accessdate=16 November 2013 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5m00eATOK?url=http://www.tvcentury21.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=67:complete-studio-recording-list-of-barry-gray&amp;catid=116:barry-gray&amp;Itemid=182 |archivedate=13 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As most of the music budget was spent on the series' earlier episodes, later instalments drew heavily on APF's ever-expanding music library.&lt;ref name="LampMusic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TVCentury21"/&gt;

Peel considers "The ''Thunderbirds'' March" to be "one of the best TV themes ever written – perfect for the show and catchy when heard alone".&lt;ref&gt;Peel, pp.&amp;nbsp;29–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Morag Reavley of [[BBC Online]] argues that the piece is "up there&amp;nbsp;... in the quintessential soundtrack of the Sixties" with the ''James Bond'' films and the songs of [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Elvis]] and [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref name="Reavley"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/6hw6|author=Reavley, Morag|title=''Thunderbirds (Original Television Soundtrack) Volume 1''|year=2003|work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|location=London, UK|accessdate=5 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212184659/http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/6hw6|archivedate=12 February 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, he praises the series' "catchy, pulse-quickening tunes", as well as Gray's aptitude for "musical nuance" and the mixing of genres.&lt;ref name="Reavley"/&gt; Heather Phares of [[Allmusic]] considers "Thunderbirds Are Go!" – the track accompanying the launch sequences of ''Thunderbirds 1'', ''2'' and ''3'' – to be a reflection of the [[Mod (subculture)|mod]] aspect of 1960s British spy fiction.&lt;ref name="Phares"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/thunderbirds-original-tv-soundtrack-mw0000593528|author=Phares, Heather|title=''Thunderbirds (Original Television Soundtrack) Volume 1''|work=[[AllMusic]]|publisher=All Media Network|location=San Francisco, California|accessdate=16 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131122015125/http://www.allmusic.com/album/thunderbirds-original-tv-soundtrack-mw0000593528|archivedate=22 November 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also highlights Gray's homage to – and divergence from – musical norms, commenting that his score "sends up the spy and action/adventure conventions of the '60s very stylishly and subtly".&lt;ref name="Phares"/&gt;

''Thunderbirds'' premiered on British television on 30 September 1965 on the [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchises [[ATV Midlands]], [[Westward Television|Westward]] and [[Channel Television|Channel]].&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 96"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;96.&lt;/ref&gt; Other broadcasters, including [[Associated Television|ATV London]] and [[ITV Granada|Granada]], started transmissions the following month.&lt;ref name="Archer and Hearn, 125"&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 96"/&gt; The Christmas-themed series finale, "[[List of Thunderbirds episodes#Series Two (1966)|Give or Take a Million]]", was first broadcast on 25 December 1966.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 95"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Grade's decision to extend the running time, the series was also sold in a 25-minute format that effectively doubled the number of episodes; this was the version used by Granada for their original broadcasts.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 26"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;13.&lt;/ref&gt; In this area, two instalments aired on the same night, separated by the [[ITN Evening News]], and the conclusion would begin with a narration by Shane Rimmer summarising the previous episode's action.&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 114"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;114.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Midlands, ATV broadcast the complete hour-long versions in a 7.00pm slot for the first 26 episodes. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=TV World (Midlands edition)|date=2 October 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second series, together with repeats of series one, was shown in the two-part format on consecutive evenings in a 5.25pm slot. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=TV World (Midlands edition)|date=18 March 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Granada transmitted ''Thunderbirds'' in its original, 50-minute format for the first time with the start of repeats in 1966.&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 114"/&gt; In 1968, the franchise briefly aired episodes in three parts due to timeslot restrictions.&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 114"/&gt; The availability of repeats during the 1960s and 1970s varied among regions. ATV Midlands screened the series regularly into the early 1970s; by contrast, ''Thunderbirds'' was entirely absent from [[Yorkshire Television]] between 1968 and 1976.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 37"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 124"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;124.&lt;/ref&gt; The series was last transmitted on the ITV franchises in 1981.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 124"/&gt;

In 1990, 8 of the [[List of Thunderbirds episodes#Audio episodes|19 audio episodes released by APF Records]] were converted into radio dramas, which were transmitted on [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|BBC Radio 5]].&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 114"/&gt; The success of the radio series encouraged the BBC to acquire the rights to the TV episodes, which it broadcast simultaneously in all regions from September 1991 on [[BBC2]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 124"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cull: Fifty, 5"&gt;Cull 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Peel, ''Thunderbirds'' is "without a doubt the peak of the Supermarionation achievement".&lt;ref name="Peel, 240"&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;240.&lt;/ref&gt; Suggesting that the series is pitched at a "more adult" level than its predecessors, he adds that its sense of adventure, effective humour and "gripping and convincing" episodes ensured that "everyone in the audience found something to love about it."&lt;ref name="Peel, 242"&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;242.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peel, p.&amp;nbsp;244.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Simon Heffer]], a fan of ''Thunderbirds'' in childhood, commented positively on the series for ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in 2011: "All the elements we children discerned in whatever grown-up television we had been allowed to watch were present in ''Thunderbirds'': dramatic theme and incidental music; well-developed plots; goodies and baddies; swaggering Americans, at a time when the whole of Britain was in a [[cultural cringe]] to them; and, of course, glamorous locations&amp;nbsp;...

In his foreword to John Marriott's book, ''Thunderbirds Are Go!'', Anderson put forward several explanations for the series' enduring popularity: it "contains elements that appeal to most children&amp;nbsp;– danger, jeopardy and destruction. But because International Rescue's mission is to save life, there is no gratuitous violence."&lt;ref name="Marriott: Thunderbirds, 7"&gt;Marriott 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anderson, ''Thunderbirds'' incorporates a "strong family atmosphere, where Dad reigns supreme".&lt;ref name="Marriott: Thunderbirds, 7"/&gt; Both O'Brien and script editor Alan Pattillo have praised the series' positive "family values".&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;180.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Heffer and others have written of its cross-generational appeal.&lt;ref name="Heffer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Evans, Jeff|title=The Penguin TV Companion|year=2003|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|location=London, UK|isbn=978-0-14-101221-6|page=721}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, shortly before the series' BBC revival, [[Brian Viner]] remarked in ''Radio Times'' that ''Thunderbirds'' was on the point of "captivating yet another generation of viewers".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=[[Brian Viner|Viner, Brian]]|date=2 September 2000|title=New Shows Are Go!|journal=[[Radio Times]]|location=London, UK|publisher=[[BBC Magazines]]|volume=306|issue=3,993|page=16|issn=0033-8060|oclc=1763373}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stuart Hood]], writing for ''[[The Spectator]]'' in 1965, praised ''Thunderbirds'' as a "modern fairy tale"; adding that it "can sometimes be frightening", he recommended that children watch it accompanied by their parents.&lt;ref name="Hood"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hood, Stuart|date=31 December 1965|title=Arts and Amusements – Television: ''Funderbirds''|journal=[[The Spectator]]|publisher=[[Press Holdings]]|issue=7,175|page=14|issn=0038-6952|oclc=1766325|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/31st-december-1965/14/television |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140128004555/http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/31st-december-1965/14/television|accessdate=16 October 2014|archivedate=28 January 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing for ''[[Dreamwatch]]'' in 1994, Andrew Thomas described ''Thunderbirds'' as only "nominally" a children's programme: "Its themes are universal and speak as much to the adult in the child as the child in the adult."&lt;ref name="Thomas, 22"&gt;Thomas, p.&amp;nbsp;22.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jeff Evans]], author of ''The Penguin TV Companion'', argues that the series' 50-minute format allows for stronger character development and "tension-building".&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; O'Brien is less positive in his appraisal of the writing, asserting that the plots are often "formulaic" and are sometimes "stretched to snapping point" by the extended running time.&lt;ref name="O'Brien, 83"/&gt; Cornell, Day and Topping are critical: they consider the writing at times "woefully poor" and argue that ''Thunderbirds'' as a whole is "often as clichéd as previous Anderson series".&lt;ref name="Cornell, Day and Topping"/&gt; Peel, despite praising the storylines and characterisation, suggests that the "tongue-in-cheek" humour of ''Stingray'' is less evident.&lt;ref&gt;Peel, pp.&amp;nbsp;240–248.&lt;/ref&gt; Where ''Thunderbirds'' improves on its predecessor, Peel believes, is in its rejection of fantasy plot devices, child and animal characters, comical and stereotyped villains and what he terms the "standard Anderson sexism": female characters, marginalised in earlier series, are more commonly seen to play active and sometimes heroic roles.&lt;ref&gt;Peel, pp.&amp;nbsp;242–243.&lt;/ref&gt;

Noting the attention to detail of the series' launch sequences, Jonathan Bignell argues that part of the motivation for dedicating large amounts of screen time to the ''Thunderbird'' craft is the need to compensate for the limited mobility of the puppet cast.&lt;ref name="Bignell, 78"/&gt; The focus on futuristic machines has also been explored by cultural historian [[Nicholas J. Cull]], who comments that of all the Andersons' series, ''Thunderbirds'' is the most evocative of a recurring theme: the "necessity of the human component of the machine", whereby the failures of new technology are overcome by "brave human beings and technology working together".&lt;ref&gt;Cull 2006 (August), pp.&amp;nbsp;197–198.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cull: Fifty, 6"&gt;Cull 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;6.&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the series' vision of the 2060s "wonderfully [[humanistic]] and reassuring".&lt;ref name="Cull: Media, 197"/&gt; O'Brien similarly praises this optimism, comparing the Tracy family to guardian [[Übermensch]].&lt;ref name="O'Brien, 83"/&gt; Writing for ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired UK]]'' magazine, [[Warren Ellis]] asserts that the series' scientific vision could inspire the next generation of "mad and frightening engineers", adding that ''Thunderbirds'' "trades in vast, demented concepts&amp;nbsp;... immense and very beautiful ideas as solutions to problems."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2009/10/start/thunderbirds-will-grow-a-generation-of-mad-engineers|title=''Thunderbirds'' will Grow a Generation of Mad Engineers|author=[[Warren Ellis|Ellis, Warren]]|journal=[[Wired UK]]|date=2 September 2009|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|location=New York City, New York|accessdate=18 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121153514/http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2009/10/start/thunderbirds-will-grow-a-generation-of-mad-engineers|archivedate=21 January 2013|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas argues that the world of ''Thunderbirds'' is similar to the 1960s to the extent that contemporary [[capitalism]] and [[class structure]]s appear to have survived mostly intact. He also observes, however, that wealth and high social status are often depicted as character flaws rather than strengths.&lt;ref name="Thomas, 24"&gt;Thomas, p.&amp;nbsp;24.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas, a contributing factor to the series' lasting popularity is the realism of IR's machines.&lt;ref name="Thomas, 22"/&gt; Newman, for his part, suggests that "the point isn't realism. The 21st century of ''Thunderbirds'' is detailed&amp;nbsp;... but also de-populated, a high-tech toyland".&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt; He is more negative in his comparisons of contemporary and future values, noting the "square, almost 50s" attitudes to race, gender and class.&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt; With regard to stereotyping, Hood comments that he "would be happier if [villains] didn't seem to be recognisable by their pigmentation".&lt;ref name="Hood"/&gt; Cull, by contrast, considers the series largely progressive on the subject of race, arguing that it rejects negative [[stereotyping]] through the use of "positive non-white characters" such as Kyrano and Tin-Tin.&lt;ref name="Cull: Media, 197"&gt;Cull 2006 (August), p.&amp;nbsp;197.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he deems many of the one-off villains derivative, commenting that these characters are typically presented as "corrupt businessmen, [[spiv]]s and gangsters familiar from crime films".&lt;ref name="Cull: Media, 197"/&gt;

Various commentators&amp;nbsp;– including Bignell, Cull and O'Brien – have also discussed ''Thunderbirds'' as a product of the Cold War era. Bignell comments that the Hood's Oriental appearance and mysterious powers draw parallels with ''James Bond'' villains and fears of China operating as "a 'third force' antagonistic to the West".&lt;ref name="O'Brien, 83"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bignell, p.&amp;nbsp;83.&lt;/ref&gt; Cull observes that, despite the series' focus on the dangers of nuclear technology, the ''Thunderbird'' machines contradict this particular theme: in their case, "an image of technology associated with the threat of Cold War mass destruction&amp;nbsp;– the rocket emerging from the hidden silo&amp;nbsp;– was appropriated and deployed to ''save'' life rather than to take it."&lt;ref name="Cull: Media, 198"/&gt; He argues that the series adheres more closely to cultural norms by drawing on the "Cold War cult of the secret agent whose skills defend the home from enemies unknown", noting Lady Penelope's role as a spy in addition to two episodes ("[[30 Minutes After Noon]]" and "The Man from MI.5") that are heavily influenced by the ''James Bond'' novels and film adaptations.&lt;ref&gt;Cull 2006 (August), p.&amp;nbsp;199.&lt;/ref&gt;

During a 2001 exhibition dedicated to the series, Masaaki Hirakata, curator at the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography]], likened ''Thunderbirds'' to "a modern sci-fi expression of [[bunraku]], which probably explains why it was accepted so readily [in Japan]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gilhooly |first=Rob |title=Still F.A.B.

The series' presentation of smoking was the subject of a study published in the medical journal ''Tobacco Control'' in 2002. Despite identifying examples in 26 episodes, Kate Hunt of the [[University of Glasgow]] concluded that ''Thunderbirds'' does not actively promote smoking&amp;nbsp;– a view opposed by the [[Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation]] (RCLCF) at the time of the series' relaunch on BBC 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hunt, Kate|year=2002|title=Re-Evaluating Smoking and Gender in ''Thunderbirds'' 35 Years On|journal=Tobacco Control|volume=11|issue=2|pages=151–153|location=New York City, New York|publisher=[[BMJ|BMJ Publishing Group]]|format=PDF|issn=1468-3318|oclc=645295997|doi=10.1136/tc.11.2.151|accessdate=15 August 2013|url=http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/11/2/151.full|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718234818/http://tobaccocontrol.bmj.com/content/11/2/151.full|archivedate=18 July 2012|deadurl=no|pmc=1763855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCSmoking"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1193980.stm|title=Lady Penelope in the Dock|date=28 February 2001|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC|location=London, UK|accessdate=7 December 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110517065052/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1193980.stm|archivedate=17 May 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting the RCLCF's proposal that the remastered episodes be edited to digitally erase all visible cigarettes and cigars, the BBC stated that the series "does not glorify or encourage smoking" and described the activity as "incidental to the plot".&lt;ref name="BBCSmoking"/&gt;

==Later productions==
{{Main article|Works based on Thunderbirds}}
''Thunderbirds'' has been followed by two film sequels, a live-action film adaptation, two animated TV remakes and several re-edited presentations for TV broadcast and home video. The second of the remakes, ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go (TV series)|Thunderbirds Are Go]]'', premiered on ITV in 2015, the 50th anniversary year of the original.&lt;ref name="TBAG Premiere"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/itvplayer/thunderbirds-are-go/series-1/episode-1-ring-of-fire-part-1-|title=''Thunderbirds Are Go'' Episode 1: ''Ring of Fire'' (Part 1)|date=4 April 2015|work=[[ITV Player]]|publisher=[[ITV plc]]|location=London, UK|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817163923/https://www.itv.com/itvplayer/thunderbirds-are-go/series-1/episode-1-ring-of-fire-part-1-|archivedate=17 August 2015|accessdate=17 August 2015|deadurl=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
The feature-length film sequels ''[[Thunderbirds Are Go]]'' and ''[[Thunderbird 6]]'' were released in 1966 and 1968. The first was [[greenlit]] by Lew Grade before the TV series had started its broadcast run.&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Nicholls, p.&amp;nbsp;112.&lt;/ref&gt; Written and produced by the Andersons and directed by David Lane, both films were distributed by [[United Artists]]. Neither was a critical or commercial success, and [[AP Films#Century 21|Century 21 Cinema]]'s plans for further sequels were abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;159.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, episodes of ''Thunderbirds'' and other Supermarionation series were re-edited by ITC's New York offices to create a series of [[compilation film]]s.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 117"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt; Branded "Super Space Theater", this format was mostly intended for family viewing on American cable and [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] TV.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 117"/&gt; Three ''Thunderbirds'' features were produced: ''Thunderbirds to the Rescue'', ''Thunderbirds in Outer Space'' and ''Countdown to Disaster''.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;361–362.&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for a live-action film adaptation were first announced in 1993.&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 115"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;161.&lt;/ref&gt; These eventually culminated in the 2004 film ''[[Thunderbirds (2004 film)|Thunderbirds]]'', directed by [[Jonathan Frakes]] and produced by [[StudioCanal]] and [[Working Title Films]]. It was a critical and commercial failure and was poorly received by fans of the TV series.&lt;ref name="Cull: Fifty, 6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;163.&lt;/ref&gt;

===TV===
The Andersons sold their intellectual and [[Residual (entertainment industry)|profit participation]] rights to ''Thunderbirds'' and their other productions in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;111.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archer and Hearn, p.&amp;nbsp;222.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they had no developmental control over subsequent adaptations of their works.&lt;ref name="Cull: Fifty, 6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anderson 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;88.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thunderbirds'' was first remade for TV in the early 1980s as ''[[Thunderbirds 2086]]''.&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 117"&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cull: Fifty, 6"/&gt; In this [[anime]] re-imagining, set 20 years after the original, the vastly expanded IR is based within an [[arcology]] and operates 17 ''Thunderbird'' machines.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 118"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt; It was inspired by ''Thunderhawks'', an updated story concept by Gerry Anderson and Reg Hill that later served as the basis for Anderson's [[Supermarionation#Supermacromation|Supermacromation]] series ''[[Terrahawks]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;227 and 363.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;188.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two re-edited series, based on condensed versions of 13 of the original episodes, aired in the US in 1994.&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 115"/&gt; The first, ''Thunderbirds USA'', was broadcast as part of the [[Fox Kids]] programming block; the second, ''Turbocharged Thunderbirds'', was syndicated by [[UPN]].&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;121–122.&lt;/ref&gt; Developed as a comedy, ''Turbocharged Thunderbirds'' moved the action to the planet "Thunder-World" and combined the original puppet footage with new live-action scenes featuring a pair of human teenagers.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 122"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as ''Thunderhawks'', Anderson developed other ideas for a remake. A 1976 concept, ''Inter-Galactic Rescue 4'', was to have featured a variable-configuration craft capable of performing rescues on land and sea, in air and in space; Anderson pitched the idea to NBC, who rejected it.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 117"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;336.&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 1984 by another proposed updating, ''T-Force'', which at first could not be pursued owing to a lack of funding.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;325.&lt;/ref&gt; Development resumed in 1993, when it was decided to produce the series, now titled ''GFI'', using [[cel animation]]. But Anderson was disappointed with the results and the production was abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2008, pp.&amp;nbsp;319–320.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Anderson re-affirmed his wish to remake ''Thunderbirds'' but stated that he had been unable to secure the necessary rights from [[Granada plc|Granada Ventures]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 5"/&gt; His negotiations with the company and its successor, [[ITV plc]], continued for the next few years.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 5"&gt;Bentley 2005: Foreword by Gerry Anderson, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCTalkingShop"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Talking Shop: Gerry Anderson|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7655589.stm|accessdate=7 October 2008|work=BBC News Online|publisher=BBC|location=London, UK|date=7 October 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212051511/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7655589.stm|archivedate=12 February 2009|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he expressed his commitment to creating an "updated" version, ideally using [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]];&lt;ref&gt;Bentley 2008: Foreword by Gerry Anderson, p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt; three years later, he announced that work on the series had commenced.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fanderson.org.uk/news/newseriesofthunderbirds.html|title=Anderson Mania – New ''Thunderbirds'' and Stamps|date=11 January 2011|publisher=[[Fanderson]]|location=[[Bradford]], UK|accessdate=11 January 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731073518/http://www.fanderson.org.uk/news/newseriesofthunderbirds.html|archivedate=31 July 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Anderson's death in December 2012, it was confirmed that a deal had been struck between [[ITV Studios]] and [[Pukeko Pictures]] to remake ''Thunderbirds'' using a combination of CGI and live-action model sets.&lt;ref name="ITV"&gt;{{Cite press release|date=4 February 2013|title=''Thunderbirds'' Are Go!|url=http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/thunderbirds-are-go|deadurl=no|type=Press release|work=[[itv.com]]|publisher=ITV plc|location=London, UK|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004214024/http://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/thunderbirds-are-go|archivedate=4 October 2013|accessdate=22 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plunkett"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/sep/30/thunderbirds-are-go-itv|title=''Thunderbirds Are Go!''

''Thunderbirds'' has influenced TV programmes, films and various other media.&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 117"/&gt; The puppet comedy of the film ''[[Team America: World Police]]'' was directly inspired by the idiosyncrasies of ''Thunderbirds''-era Supermarionation techniques.&lt;ref name="Cull: Fifty, 7"&gt;Cull 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/news/06/5406.php|title=Trey Parker and Matt Stone Talk ''Team America: World Police''|date=4 October 2004|work=[[MovieWeb]]|publisher=WATCHR Media|location=[[Las Vegas]], Nevada|accessdate=19 January 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706155146/http://www.movieweb.com/news/06/5406.php|archivedate=6 July 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allusion and homage are also evident in ''[[Wallace and Gromit]]: [[A Close Shave]]'', ''[[Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me]]'' and ''[[Spaced]]'',&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 117"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cull: Fifty, 7"/&gt; as well as the character design of ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008 TV series)|Star Wars: The Clone Wars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/BC_Beat/10161-George_Lucas_Talks_Clone_Wars_.php|author=Weprin, Alex|title=George Lucas Talks ''Clone Wars''|date=3 April 2008|work=broadcastingcable.com|publisher=[[NewBay Media]]|location=New York City, New York|accessdate=17 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127104128/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/blog/BC_Beat/10161-George_Lucas_Talks_Clone_Wars_.php|archivedate=27 November 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC sketch comedy ''[[Not Only...

IR's life-saving mission inspired the founding of the volunteer [[International Rescue Corps]], originally made up of a group of British firemen who contributed to the humanitarian effort following the [[1980 Irpinia earthquake]].&lt;ref name="Bentley, 117"/&gt; [[Virgin Group]] has used the series in branding its services: [[Virgin Atlantic]] operates a [[Boeing 747-400]] airliner named ''Lady Penelope'', while [[Virgin Trains]] owns a fleet of locomotives that are all named after main characters and vehicles and used specifically to "rescue" broken-down trains.&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 117"/&gt;

A mimed stage show, ''Thunderbirds: F.A.B.'', has toured internationally and popularised a staccato style of movement known colloquially as the "''Thunderbirds'' walk".&lt;ref name="Bentley, 119"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marriott 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;181.&lt;/ref&gt; The production has periodically been revived as ''Thunderbirds: F.A.B. – The Next Generation''.&lt;ref name="Bentley, 118"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 119"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cover versions of "The ''Thunderbirds'' March" have been released by musicians and bands such as [[Billy Cotton]], [[Joe Loss]], [[Frank Sidebottom]], [[The Rezillos]] and [[The Shadows]].&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 117"/&gt; Groups who have written songs inspired by the series include [[We've Got a Fuzzbox and We're Gonna Use It|Fuzzbox]] (with "International Rescue"), [[TISM]] (with "[[Thunderbirds Are Coming Out]]"), [[Busted (band)|Busted]] (with "[[Thunderbirds / 3AM]]") and [[V6 (band)|V6]] (with "Thunderbirds – Your Voice").&lt;ref name="Bentley: EG, 117"/&gt; In 1991, Anderson filmed the music video for the [[Dire Straits]] single "[[Calling Elvis]]" with a collection of ''Thunderbirds''-style puppets.&lt;ref name="Marriott, 190"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bentley, 121"&gt;Bentley 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;121.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Wayne's World''''' is a 1992 American [[comedy film]] directed by [[Penelope Spheeris]], produced by [[Lorne Michaels]], and written by [[Mike Myers]] and [[Bonnie and Terry Turner]]. It stars Myers in his feature film debut as Wayne Campbell and [[Dana Carvey]] as Garth Algar, a pair of rock fans who broadcast a [[public-access television|public-access television show]]. It also features [[Rob Lowe]], [[Tia Carrere]], [[Lara Flynn Boyle]], [[Brian Doyle-Murray]], [[Chris Farley]], [[Ed O'Neill]], [[Ione Skye]], [[Meat Loaf]], and [[Alice Cooper]].

''Wayne's World'' was released in the US on February 14, 1992. It was the eighth-highest-grossing film of 1992 and it remains the highest-grossing [[List of Saturday Night Live feature films|film based on ''Saturday Night Live'' skits]]. A sequel, ''[[Wayne's World 2]]'', was released on December 10, 1993.

==Plot==
In [[Aurora, Illinois]], rock fans Wayne Campbell and Garth Algar host a [[public-access television]] show, ''Wayne's World'', from Wayne's parents' basement. After they sell the rights to the show to television producer Benjamin Oliver for $10,000, they celebrate at a night club, where they avoid Wayne's troubled ex-girlfriend Stacy. Wayne falls for Cassandra Wong, vocalist and bassist of the band performing that night, Crucial Taunt, and impresses her with his [[Cantonese]]. He purchases a 1964 [[Fender Stratocaster]] electric guitar he has long coveted.

Benjamin attempts to steal Cassandra from Wayne by using his wealth and good looks. He distracts Wayne and Garth with all-access tickets to an [[Alice Cooper]] concert in Milwaukee, while offering to produce a [[music video]] for Crucial Taunt. At the concert, Wayne and Garth make the acquaintance of a bodyguard to music producer Frankie Sharp, head of Sharp Records.

While filming the revamped ''Wayne's World'' under Benjamin's oversight, Wayne and Garth find it difficult to adjust to the professional studio environment. Their contract obliges them to give a promotional interview to their [[Sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]], Noah Vanderhoff, who owns a franchise of [[amusement arcade]]s. After Wayne publicly ridicules Vanderhoff, he is fired from the show, causing a rift in his friendship with Garth. Jealous of the attention Benjamin is giving Cassandra, Wayne attempts to prevent her from participating in the Crucial Taunt music video shoot. She breaks up with him, furious at his lack of trust.

Wayne and Garth reunite and hatch a plan to win Cassandra back by having Sharp hear Crucial Taunt play. While Garth and their friends infiltrate a satellite station with the aid of Benjamin's assistant, Wayne goes to Cassandra's video shoot, but embarrasses himself in an attempt to expose Benjamin's ulterior motive. As he leaves, Cassandra changes her mind about Benjamin. Wayne apologizes and they return to Aurora.

The ''Wayne's World'' crew hacks into Sharp's satellite television and broadcast the Crucial Taunt performance from Wayne's basement, where Sharp and Benjamin converge. Sharp declines to offer Crucial Taunt a record contract, Cassandra breaks up with Wayne and departs with Benjamin for a tropical resort, Stacy reveals that she is pregnant with Wayne's child, and a fire destroys Wayne's house.

Dissatisfied, Wayne and Garth turn to the film's audience and halt proceedings. They restart the scene and unmask Benjamin as "Old Man Withers" in a ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'' parody ending. Still unsatisfied, they start again with a "mega happy ending" in which Cassandra signs a record contract and reunites with Wayne, Garth begins a relationship with a waitress, and Benjamin learns that money and good looks do not necessarily bring happiness.

==Production==
''Wayne's World'' was greenlit by [[Paramount Pictures]] in 1991. It was the second [[List of Saturday Night Live feature films|film based on a ''Saturday Night Live'' sketch]] following ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://nypost.com/2017/02/02/mike-myers-couldnt-drive-during-waynes-world/ |title=Mike Myers couldn't drive during 'Wayne's World' |work=[[New York Post]] |date=2017-02-02 |accessdate=2017-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Lorne Michaels]] hired [[Penelope Spheeris]] to direct, who had directed several music [[documentary film|documentaries]]. Spheeris said, "I had been just struggling as a female director in this business for many years. I was 45 years old when I got that job. I just kept hanging in there. And ''Wayne's World'' happened, and it sort of flipped my life around."&lt;ref name="Vanity-Fair"&gt;{{cite news |last=Pirnia |first=Garin |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/02/wanyes-world-25th-anniversary-penelope-spheeris-interview |title=How Wayne's World Made—and Broke—Its Director's Career |work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]] |date=2017-02-06 |accessdate=2017-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spheeris clashed with Myers during filming. She told ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' that Myers was "emotionally needy and got more difficult as the shoot went along. You should have heard him bitching when I was trying to do that 'Bohemian Rhapsody' scene: 'I can't move my neck like that! Why do we have to do this so many times? No one is going to laugh at that!'" She said she attempted to assuage Myers by having her daughter provide him snacks,&lt;ref name="ew"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/article/2008/06/16/mike-myers-man-mystery/|title=Mike Myers: Man of Mystery|date=2008-06-16|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on one occasion he stormed off the set, upset that there was no margarine for his bagel.&lt;ref name="ew" /&gt; Myers and Spheeris argued over the [[final cut (film editing)|final cut]] of the film, causing Myers to prevent Spheeris from directing ''[[Wayne's World 2|Wayne' World 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Brandon Kirby |agency= |title=Mike Myers, Dana Carvey Set Aside 'Wayne's World' Feud at Academy Screening |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/waynes-world-feud-mike-myers-445044 |quote=Carvey and Spheeris both notoriously fell out with Myers despite the 1992 film's huge success.

===Critical response===
On [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film has an 84% "Certified Fresh" rating based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10, with the critical consensus stating, "An oddball comedy that revels in its silliness and memorable catchphrases, ''Wayne's World'' is also fondly regarded because of its endearing characters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/waynes_world/|title=Wayne's World|website=Rottentomatoes.com|accessdate=2017-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 53 out of 100, based on 13 critics, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/waynes-world |title=Wayne's World Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Roger Ebert]] said in his review: "I walked into ''Wayne's World'' expecting a lot of dumb, vulgar comedy, and I got plenty, but I also found what I didn't expect: a genuinely amusing, sometimes even intelligent, undercurrent." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/waynes-world-1992|title=Wayne's World Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (1992) {{!}} Roger Ebert|last=Ebert|first=Roger|website=Rogerebert.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Desson Howe]] wrote in the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' that making a movie out of such a "teeny sketch" is "better than you'd expect" but criticized the finale as "an attempt to lampoon movie endings" "and a despair-driven inability to end the movie".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/waynesworldpg13howe_a0aea2.htm|title=Wayne's World (PG-13)|last=Howe|first=Desson|website=Washingtonpost.com|access-date=2017-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on pop culture===
[[File:WaynesWorldAMCPacer.jpg|thumb|right|Wayne's World AMC Pacer clone at Planet Hollywood in New York City]]

Filled with [[pop culture]] references, the sketches and the film started catchphrases such as "''Schwing!''" and "[[Sarcasm|Schyea]]", as well as popularizing "[[That's what she said]]", "Party on!" and the use of "[[Not!]]" after apparently affirmative sentences in order to state the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstshowing.net/2013/schwing-mike-myers-dana-carveys-waynes-world-reunion-recap/ |title=Schwing!

The '''winter of 1990–91''' was a particularly cold winter in [[Western Europe]], noted especially for its effect on the [[United Kingdom]], and for two significantly heavy falls of [[snow]] which occurred in December 1990 and February 1991. Sandwiched in between was a period of high winds and heavy rain which caused widespread damage. The winter was the coldest since [[January 1987 Southeast England snowfall|January 1987]], and the snowfall experienced in many parts of the United Kingdom would not be seen again until the [[February 2009 Great Britain and Ireland snowfall|snowfall of February 2009]].&lt;ref name="http1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7864395.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Heavy snow hits much of Britain |publisher=BBC |work= BBC News |date=2 February 2009 |accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==December 1990==

The snowfall of early December 1990 was particularly disruptive to large parts of the United Kingdom, although heavy snow was also reported across much of Western Europe.&lt;ref name=http2&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/10/world/heavy-snow-snarls-much-of-west-europe.html|title= Heavy Snow Snarls Much of West Europe|publisher= |work= New York Times|date= 10 December 1990|accessdate= 25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United Kingdom snow began to fall over the  [[English Midlands|Midlands]], [[Wales]] and the [[Pennines]] on the night of 7–8 December 1990 and continued for much of the following day. The rate of snowfall was quite heavy, around {{convert|6|cm}} an hour, and as a result many areas were covered within half an hour of the snow starting to fall. Coupled with this were high winds which reached gale force in many areas leading to blizzard conditions. Many parts of the Midlands reported at least {{convert|20|cm}} of snow while depths reached {{convert|60|cm}} in the [[Derby]] area. On the Welsh Mountains there were drifts of up to {{convert|4|m}}. Snow fell in Western Europe the following day, 9 December.&lt;ref name=http4&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=g_YVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OBQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6497,3902250&amp;dq=snow&amp;hl=en|title= Snow blusters through Britain, western Europe|publisher= |work= Morning Star|date= 10 December 1990|accessdate= 25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wildcroft Road in snow,1990 - geograph.org.uk - 1073452.jpg|thumb|left|Snow in [[Canley]], [[Coventry]] on 8 December 1990.]]

Transport was severely disrupted with many people trapped in their cars and all rail services in the Midlands cancelled, while elsewhere in western Europe, roads and airports were closed.&lt;ref name=http2/&gt; In northern Spain traffic officials were forced to shut mountain passes due to heavy snow while rail services in [[Ticino|Tessin]], southern [[Switzerland]] were also severely disrupted. The state's [[Lugano Airport]] was also closed.&lt;ref name=http2/&gt; In France the main highway between [[Lyon]] and [[Grenoble]] was blocked and traffic had to be rerouted, while the [[Mont Blanc tunnel]] linking France and Italy through the Alps was also inaccessible.&lt;ref name=http3&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/11/world/12-dead-and-9-missing-as-europe-digs-out-after-a-heavy-snowfall.html|title= 12 Dead and 9 Missing as Europe Digs Out After a Heavy Snowfall|publisher= |work= New York Times|date= 11 December 1990|accessdate= 25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many roads in parts of Austria's [[East Tyrol]] and western [[Carinthia (state)|Carinthia]] were closed due to avalanche fears. Snow also fell in Italy where [[Turin]] saw its first pre-Christmas snow since 1964.&lt;ref name=http3/&gt; At the same time much of southern Europe experienced high winds and heavy rain,&lt;ref name=http3/&gt; with ferry services suspended in [[Venice]] following floods.&lt;ref name=http5&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=hPYVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OBQEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4056,4218657&amp;dq=snow&amp;hl=en|title= Snow plagues continent|publisher= |work= Morning Star|date= 11 December 1990|accessdate= 25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The harsh weather conditions brought down power lines across England leading to loss of electricity for many areas. Power was also disrupted in parts of France.&lt;ref name=http2/&gt; In the UK some 650,000 people were without power, and about 1.2 million without water supplies for several days. The [[British Army|Army]] was called in to help restore utility supplies to outlying areas.&lt;ref name=http4/&gt; In addition, the adverse weather conditions had a negative economic impact with takings at stores on what was the third Saturday before [[Christmas]] considerably lower than normal.

The severe weather led to the deaths of ten people in the United Kingdom. Three were killed in road accidents in [[Northern Ireland]] which was hit by gale force winds.&lt;ref name=http2/&gt; In Austria a 21 car pile up was caused by ice on the [[Inntal Autobahn|Inntal highway]] injuring several people.&lt;ref name=http3/&gt;

Most of the snow had gone within four days, but its effects were felt for several days afterward. Much of the rest of December was unsettled, and the United Kingdom was hit by heavy storms over the Christmas and New Year period. High winds and heavy rain on Christmas Day caused disruption and power cuts for some parts of the United Kingdom, while the UK and Ireland experienced severe gales on 5 and 6 January 1991. Gusts of up to 70&amp;nbsp;mph brought down trees and power lines leaving thousands of homes blacked out across Ireland and the southwest of England, resulting in the deaths of 30 people.&lt;ref name=http12&gt;{{cite news|title= Gales claim 30 more lives across Britain and ireland|publisher= Cowles Publishing Company|work= Spokane Chronicle|date= 7 January 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dead included 11 crew members who were lost off two merchant vessels, a couple out walking on the beach near [[Brighton]] and 13 people who died in Ireland as a result of falling trees and other accidents.&lt;ref name=http13&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=QmcQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=y4sDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3378,758565&amp;dq=storms+ireland&amp;hl=en|title= Gales kill 30 in Britain, Ireland|publisher= |work= The Free Lance Star|date= 7 January 1991|accessdate= 26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven of the Irish deaths occurred when a tree crashed onto a minibus.

==February 1991==
[[File:It did used to snow in Darfield. - geograph.org.uk - 529728.jpg|thumb|right|upright|People sledging in [[Darfield, South Yorkshire|Darfield]], [[South Yorkshire]] in February 1991.]]
The second snow event of the winter occurred in early February 1991 and brought the coldest weather since January 1987. Unlike the previous storm it hit much of Europe, freezing rivers and lakes, and even the canals of Venice which froze over for the first time since 1985.&lt;ref name=http6&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qboTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UJADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4853,1925765&amp;dq=snow&amp;hl=en|title= Europe hit by bad winter|publisher= |work= New Straits Times Malaysia|date= 8 February 1991|accessdate= 25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In France the [[French Riviera]] experienced its heaviest snowfall for five years leading to traffic chaos – many drivers were stranded on the coastal road between [[Nice]] and [[Antibes]],&lt;ref name=http7&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Zk8QAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=II8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4092,4049515&amp;dq=snow&amp;hl=en|title= Snow blankets the Riviera|publisher= |work= Ellensburg Daily Record|date= 7 February 1991|accessdate= 25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; while elsewhere two people were killed after becoming exposed to the cold weather,&lt;ref name=http6/&gt; and horse racing at the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] resort of [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]] was cancelled due to snowfall.&lt;ref name=http6/&gt; The southern [[Soviet Union]] which usually experienced fairly mild winters saw temperatures fall to −10C,&lt;ref name=http6/&gt; while [[Spitsbergen]] in Norway enjoyed unseasonably mild weather.&lt;ref name=http6/&gt;

In the United Kingdom the snow was brought in by a cold easterly wind.&lt;ref name=http11/&gt; At first it was mostly concentrated in the eastern counties of England, although it quickly spread inland. By the evening of 6 February many parts of England and Wales were experiencing snow showers, and by the following morning many areas woke to a covering of powdery snow. Along with this came a severe frost coupled with sub-zero temperatures, and heavy snowfalls which continued to fall throughout the day. Temperatures were as low as {{convert|-11.7|C}} and did not exceed {{convert|-5|C}} in many areas. Snow depths were in excess of {{convert|10|cm}} across England and drifted in the easterly wind. On higher ground levels reached {{convert|30|cm}}.&lt;ref name=http11/&gt; Villages on [[Exmoor]] were cut off by drifts approaching {{convert|2|m}}.

Once again the snow brought travel chaos to much of the country, particularly to the railways, with [[British Rail]] making its now infamous excuse that severe delays to services were being caused by [[the wrong type of snow]].&lt;ref name=http8&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/topics/weather/4434770/Snow-Britain-Wrong-kind-of-snow-strikes-again.html|title= Snow Britain: Wrong kind of snow strikes again|publisher= Telegraph Media Group|work= Daily Telegraph|first= Philip|last= Eden|date= 2 February 2009|accessdate= 26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Heathrow Airport]] was forced to cancel flights, while [[Birmingham Airport, England|Birmingham]] and [[Gatwick Airport|Gatwick]] were closed.&lt;ref name=http10&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.travelweekly.co.uk/Articles/2009/02/02/30130/timeline-how-snow-has-hit-uk-flights-1991-2009.html|title= Timeline: How snow has hit UK flights, 1991 – 2009|publisher= |work= Travel Weekly|date= 2 February 2009|accessdate= 26 November 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Cars were abandoned as roads and motorways became impassable, and canals, ponds and even part of the [[Bristol Channel]] froze over.

By 8 February conditions had deteriorated further, with depths of snow approaching {{convert|20|cm}} in many areas. [[London]] recorded {{convert|20|cm}},&lt;ref name=http11&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1138692/More-snow-way-severe-frost-grips-country-throw-decades-ago.html|title= More snow on the way as severe frost grips the country in a throw back to two decades ago|publisher= Associated Newspapers Ltd|work= Mail Online|date= 7 February 2009|accessdate= 26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with parts of [[Yorkshire]] recording {{convert|51|cm}}.&lt;ref name=http9&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/weather/article5633815.ece|title= Snow storms will be most widespread in 18 years, Met Office warns|publisher= News International|work= Times Online|first= Louise|last= Cohen|date= 1 February 2009|accessdate= 26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bingley]] in [[West Yorkshire]] had {{convert|47|cm}} and [[Pencelli]] in [[Powys]] {{convert|35|cm}}. After temperatures dropped to {{convert|-10|C}} on the night of 8–9 February, conditions eased slightly the following day and continued to do so on 10 February. However, night-time temperatures remained low, and there was a fresh snowfall on 12 February. After this high pressure began to move across the UK and despite further night time frosts a slow thaw began. On 20 February an Atlantic system arrived bringing mild south westerly winds and rain which escalated the thaw and allowed temperatures to return to double figures.
