      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8933">{{about|the representative body of the social sciences in the United Kingdom}}

The '''Academy of Social Sciences''' is a representative body for [[Social Sciences|social sciences]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. The Academy promotes social science through its sponsorship of the [[Campaign for Social Science]], its links with Government on a variety of matters, and its own policy work in issuing public comment, responding to official consultations, and organising meetings and events about social science. It confers the title of Fellow upon nominated social scientists following a process of peer review. The Academy comprises over 1000 Fellows and 41 [[Learned society|learned societies]] based in the UK and Europe.

== History and structure ==
The Academy’s origins lie in the formation of a representative body for the social science learned societies in 1982, the '''Association of Learned Societies in the Social Sciences''' ('''ALSISS'''). From 1999 to 2007 it was called the Academy of Learned Societies for the Social Sciences before changing to its current name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jordanwatch.co.uk/reports/details/03847936/academyofsocialsciences.html JordanWatch.uk], retrieved on 17 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy is run by a Council of 21 members, with Professor Roger Goodman FAcSS as its current Chair, and Professor Sir [[Ivor Crewe]] FAcSS, Master of [[University College, Oxford]], as its current President. 7 Council members are elected by the Academy’s Fellows, 7 by its Learned Societies and 7 are appointed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://acss.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Academy-of-Social-Sciences-Memorandum-and-Articles-of-Association-amended-March-2013.pdf Academy website]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advocacy ==
The Academy advocates social science by interacting with Government and other organisations, and co-ordinates the responses of social scientists to Government consultation documents. Past consultations include:

* Independent Review of Implementation of [[RCUK]] Policy on Open Access.
* [[Public Administration Select Committee]] Enquiry on 'Building Civil service Skills for the Future'
* The [[Office for National Statistics]] consultation on the future of the Census &lt;ref&gt;[http://acss.org.uk/publication-category/consultation-responses/ Academy website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy also puts forward suggestions to the Government about which social scientists should carry out its Foresight research projects,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bis.gov.uk/foresight/ BIS website]&lt;/ref&gt; which look at important issues and how these might change over the next 20 to 80 years.

A developing part of the Academy’s work is to bring researchers and organisations using research closer together to improve the evidence upon which public policy is based and to increase the impact of research.

== Publications and events ==
The Academy has produced a series of [http://acss.org.uk/publication-category/making-the-case/ ‘Making the Case for the Social Sciences’] booklets which give examples of important social science research which has made a difference to policy or practice. These are: Wellbeing; Ageing; Sustainability; the Environment and Climate Change; Crime; Sport and Leisure; Management; Scotland; Longitudinal Studies, Mental Wellbeing, Wales and Dementia. Further titles are in preparation. The Academy also publishes a cross-disciplinary peer-reviewed journal, [http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/rsoc21/current#.Uo34U9K9lA0 ''Contemporary Social Science'']. The Academy holds regular events, such as conferences on the ethics of social media research and the future of the [[Research Excellence Framework]]. It holds an Annual Lecture each summer, and its President's Lunch each winter. It also arranges (with the [[British Library]]) a public lecture series Enduring Ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.bl.uk/reshelp/bldept/socsci/events/socscievents.html | title=Social sciences}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fellows==
{{main|Fellow of the Academy of Social Sciences}}
Part of the Academy’s work is to recognise social scientists who are held in esteem by their peer group and whose life and work have had an impact in advancing social science. They are nominated and the nominations are then subject to peer review. Fellows are academics, policy-makers and practitioners, and are entitled to use the letters "FAcSS" after their name. In November 2014 there were 1000 Fellows, just over 1% of the 90,000 total membership of the 41 learned society members of the Academy.

Fellows were previously known as Academicians and used the post-nominal letter "AcSS". This was changed in July 2014 to bring the Academy in line with other British [[learned societies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academicians now 'Fellows of the Academy of Social Sciences'|url=http://acss.org.uk/news/academicians-now-fellows-academy-social-science/|website=News|publisher=Academy of Social Sciences|accessdate=4 September 2014|date=4 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campaign for Social Science ==
The Academy launched the [[Campaign for Social Science]] in January 2011 to advocate social science to Government and the general public. The Campaign is self-funded. It has campaigned for the restoration of the post of Government Chief Social Scientific Adviser,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2012/mar/19/the-case-for-a-chief-social-scientist Guardian]&lt;/ref&gt; promotes social science in the media and on the web, and organises roadshows around the country to emphasise the value and importance of social science.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11788">{{Main article|Aphasia}}
'''Aphasiology''' is the study of [[language]] impairment usually resulting from [[brain damage]], due to  neurovascular accident—hemorrhage, stroke—or associated with a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, including different types of [[dementia]]. It is also the name of a [[scientific journal]] covering the area. These specific language deficits, termed [[aphasia]]s, may be defined as impairments of language production or comprehension that cannot be attributed to trivial causes such as [[deafness]] or oral [[paralysis]].  A number of aphasias have been described, but two are best known:  [[expressive aphasia]] (Broca's aphasia) and [[receptive aphasia]] (Wernicke's or sensory aphasia).

==Acute aphasias==
'''Acute aphasias''' are often the result of tissue damage following a [[stroke]].

===Expressive aphasia===
{{Main article|Expressive aphasia}}
First described by the [[France|French]] neurologist [[Paul Broca]] in the nineteenth century, expressive aphasia causes the speech of those afflicted to display a considerable vocabulary but to show grammatical deficits.&lt;ref name="Burns 2010"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Burns MS, Fahy J |title=Broca's area: rethinking classical concepts from a neuroscience perspective |journal=Top Stroke Rehabil |volume=17 |issue=6 |pages=401–10 |year=2010 |pmid=21239364 |doi=10.1310/tsr1706-401 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is characterized by a halting speech consisting mainly of content words, i.e. nouns and verbs, and, at least in [[English language|English]], distinctly lacking small grammatical function words such as articles and prepositions.  This observation gave rise to the terms telegraphic speech and, more recently, [[agrammatism]].  The extent to which expressive aphasics retain knowledge of grammar is a matter of considerable controversy.  Nonetheless, because their comprehension of spoken language is mostly preserved, and because their speech is usually good enough to get their point across, the agrammatic nature of their speech suggests that the disorder chiefly involves the expressive mechanisms of language that turn thoughts into well-formed sentences.&lt;ref name="Hillis 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hillis AE |title=Aphasia: progress in the last quarter of a century |journal=Neurology |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=200–13 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17620554 |doi=10.1212/01.wnl.0000265600.69385.6f |url=http://cel.huji.ac.il/courses/structureandprocesses/Bibliography/Hillis_2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view of expressive aphasia as an expressive disorder is supported by its frequent co-occurrence with facial motor difficulties, and its anatomical localization.  Although expressive aphasia may be caused by brain damage to many regions, it is most commonly associated with the [[inferior frontal gyrus]], a region that overlaps with [[motor cortex]] controlling the [[Human mouth|mouth]] and [[tongue]], extending into the periventricular white matter.&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks 2004"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Albert, Martin L. |author2=Helm-Estabrooks, Nancy |title=Manual of aphasia and aphasia therapy |publisher=Pro-Ed |location=Austin, Tex |year=2004 |pages= |isbn=0-89079-963-6 |oclc=51009586 |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, this region has come to be known as "[[Broca's area]]".  However, an intriguing line of research has demonstrated specific comprehension deficits in expressive aphasics as well.  These deficits generally involve sentences that are grammatical, but atypical in their word order.  The simplest example is sentences in the [[passive voice]], such as "The boy was chased by the girl."  Expressive aphasics may have quite a hard time realizing that the girl is doing the chasing, but they do much better with "The mouse was chased by the cat," where world knowledge constraints contribute to the correct interpretation.  However, "The cat was chased by the mouse" would likewise be incomprehensible.  This evidence suggests that grammatical competence may be a specific function of Broca's area.

Lesions exclusively to Broca's area (the foot of the [[inferior frontal gyrus]]) do not produce Broca's aphasia, but instead mild [[dysprosody]] and [[agraphia]], sometimes accompanied by word-finding pauses and mild [[dysarthria]]. Not much is known about what other areas must be damaged in order to produce Broca's aphasia, but some maintain damage to the inferior pre-Rolandic motor strip (the motor cortex region responsible [[glossopharyngeal]] muscle control) is also necessary.

===Receptive aphasia===
{{Main article|Receptive aphasia}}
Receptive aphasia was originally described by the German neurologist [[Karl Wernicke]], a contemporary of Broca.  Receptive aphasics produce speech that seems fluent and grammatical, but is largely devoid of sensible content.  Comprehension is severely impaired, but while patients display a great deal of difficulty comprehending individual words, they can more easily understand words in context.&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks 2004" /&gt;  Receptive aphasia is associated with the posterior third of the [[superior temporal gyrus]] in the distribution of the inferior division of the [[middle cerebral artery]],&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks 2004" /&gt; known as "[[Wernicke's area]]", an area adjacent to the [[Cerebral cortex|cortex]] responsible for auditory processing.  If the damage extends posteriorly, visual connections are disrupted, and the patient will have difficulty understanding written language. Therefore, the localization of the two best-known aphasias mirrors the grossest dichotomy in brain organization:  anterior areas are specialized for motor output, and posterior areas for sensory processing.

A fascinating corollary of this has come from research on aphasias in deaf users of sign language, who show deficits in signing and comprehension analogous to Expressive and Receptive aphasias in hearing populations.  These studies demonstrate that the grammatical functions of Broca's area and the semantic functions of Wernicke's area are indeed deep, abstract properties of the language system independent of its modality of expression.

===Global aphasia===
{{Main article|Global aphasia}}
Another less commonly known aphasia is [[global aphasia]], which generally manifests itself after a stroke affecting an extensive portion of the brain occurs, including infarction of both divisions of the [[middle cerebral artery]] and generally both Broca's area and Wernicke's area.&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks 2004" /&gt; Survivors with global aphasia may have great difficulty understanding and forming words and sentences, and generally experience a great deal of difficulty when trying to communicate.&lt;ref name="Hillis 2007"/&gt; With considerable speech therapy rehabilitation, global aphasia may progress into expressive aphasia or receptive aphasia.

===Anomic aphasia===
{{Main article|Anomic aphasia}}
A person with [[anomic aphasia]] have word-finding difficulties. Anomic aphasia, also known as anomia, is a non-fluent aphasia, which means the person speaks hesitantly because of a difficulty naming words and/or producing correct syntax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gale|first=Thomson|title=Anomia|url=http://www.healthline.com/galecontent/anomia|work=Healthline|publisher=Gale Encyclopedia of Public Health|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The person struggles to find the right words for speaking and writing.&lt;ref name="Maher 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Maher LM, Raymer AM |title=Management of anomia |journal=Top Stroke Rehabil |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=10–21 |year=2004 |pmid=14872396 |doi= 10.1310/318R-RMD5-055J-PQ40|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects tend to use circumulations, in which they speak around the word they can not find, to make up for their loss. People also with anomic aphasia tend to know how to use an object, but rather can not name the aforementioned object.  Any damage in or near the zone of language can result in anomic aphasia. Other forms of aphasia often transition into a syndrome of primarily anomic aphasia in the process of recovery.&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks 2004" /&gt;

===Conduction aphasia===
{{Main article|Conduction aphasia}}
Conduction Aphasia is a rare form of aphasia in which fibres in the arcuate fasciculus and [[superior longitudinal fasciculus]] are damaged.&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks 2004" /&gt; These fibres are the link between the Wernicke's and Broca's area. Damage to the area connecting comprehension and expression together has the following symptoms: fluent speech, good comprehension, poor oral reading, repetition is poor and transpositions of sounds within words is very common.

==Primary progressive aphasias==
{{Main article|Primary progressive aphasia}}
'''Primary progressive aphasia''' is a rare disorder where people slowly lose their ability to talk, read, write, and comprehend what they hear in conversation over a period of time. It was first described as a distinct syndrome by Mesulam in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mesulam M |title=Slowly progressive aphasia without generalized dementia |journal=Ann. Neurol. |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=592–8 |year=1982 |pmid=7114808 |doi=10.1002/ana.410110607}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three variants:  [[progressive nonfluent aphasia|progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA)]],&lt;ref name="Mesulam, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mesulam MM |title=Primary progressive aphasia |journal=Ann.

==History==

The nineteenth century marked the most important time in the evolution of aphasiology, beginning with the works of [[Franz Josef Gall]]. Gall is the founder of the more modern localization theory and is the origin of the idea of a language center in the brain. However, supporting evidence for the theory that language had its own anatomical representation was not found until the case study of Mr. Leborgne, also known as Tan, by Paul Broca in 1861. The discovery of what is now known as Broca's area was followed years later by Carl Wernicke's famous work, 'The Symptom-Complex of Aphasia: A Psychological Study on an Anatomical Basis' in 1874. This paper is regarded as one of the most influential works in the history of the field of aphasiology. In it, Wernicke described many of the different classifications of aphasia and is the basis for the classical model of aphasia.&lt;ref&gt;Tesak, Juergen; &amp; Code, Chris (2008).

A '''Bachelor of Environmental Science''' is an [[undergraduate]] [[bachelor's degree]] awarded for courses taken in the study of [[environmental science]] or related disciplines, such as sustainable resource development, [[environmental health]], or [[ecological sustainability]], and may also be known as a Bachelor of Environmental Science and Management degree in some schools. This is a interdisciplinary degree course, some universities offers four year honors degree programme  

The Bachelor of Environmental Science degree is frequently abbreviated as '''B.Env.Sc.''', (sometimes B.E.Sc, B.S.E.S, or even B.E.S - the latter of which can cause confusion with a Bachelor of Environmental ''Studies'' degree) especially in the use of post-nominals where an Environmental Studies degree may be either B.S. or B.A.

In Australia, those who graduate with a B.Env.Sc. are eligible for membership in the [[Environment Institutes|Environment Institute of Australian and New Zealand]].

==List of institutions awarding Bachelor of Environmental Science degrees==
&lt;!-- NOTE: Only list institutions that award a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree - those that award BSc's with specialization do not count --&gt;
This listing only includes institutions that award a Bachelor of Environmental Science degree.  Although there are similar programs that are [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees that specialize in Environmental Science or Environmental Studies, they are not included in this list. In many cases, the differences are political or administrative in nature, as opposed to content.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11323">'''Beat deafness''' is a form of congenital [[amusia]] characterized by a person's inability to distinguish musical [[rhythm]] or move in time to it.&lt;ref name=ScienceNews&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bower|first=Bruce|title=A man lost in musical time|journal=[[Science News]]|date=26 March 2011|volume=179|issue=7|pages=9|url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/70584/title/A_man_lost_in_musical_time|accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
Generally, humans have the ability to hear musical beat and rhythm beginning in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Stewart | first1 = L | year = 2011 | title = Characterizing congenital amusia | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 64 | issue = 4| pages = 625–638 | doi=10.1080/17470218.2011.552730}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people, however, are unable to identify [[Beat (music)|beat]] and [[rhythm]] of [[music]], suffering from what is known as beat deafness.  Beat deafness is a newly discovered form of [[congenital amusia]], in which people lack the ability to identify or “hear” the beat in a piece of music.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Silver"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Phillips-Silver | first1 = J. | last2 = Toiviainen | first2 = P. | last3 = Gosselin | first3 = N. | last4 = Piche | first4 = O. | last5 = Nozaradan | first5 = S. | last6 = Palmer | first6 = C. | last7 = Peretz | first7 = I. | year = 2011 | title = Born to dance but beat deaf: a new form of congenital amusia | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 49 | issue = 5| pages = 961–969 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2011.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most hearing impairments in which an individual is unable to hear any sort of sound stimuli, those with beat deafness are generally able to hear normally, but unable to identify beat and rhythm in music. Those with beat deafness are also unable to [[dance]] in step to any type of music. Even people who do not dance well can at least coordinate their movements to the song they are listening to, because they can easily keep time to the beat.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Silver"/&gt;

==Rarity==
The first reported case of beat deafness was of a Canadian graduate student, whom researchers have identified as “Mathieu”.  Phillips-Silver et al. (2011) examined the human ability to recognize musical beat in a sample of individuals who had had no previous musical training in their lives. The researchers presented a series of songs from different genres and the participants were instructed to simply bounce up and down to the beat of the music. Results indicated that all participants except for Mathieu were able to move in sync with the beat of the music. The researchers also presented video clips which showed a person dancing to music. Mathieu could not identify when the person was or was not dancing in time to the music.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Silver"/&gt; Other participants demonstrated no problem with this task.

==Neural basis==
When [[sound waves]] reach the ears, the energy they contain is converted into electrical signals, which are sent via the [[auditory nerve]]s to the brain. Sound processing begins when these electrical signals reach the primary auditory receiving area in the core part of the [[temporal lobe]].&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, E. B. (2010). Sensation and perception. California: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning&lt;/ref&gt; Signals then travel to the area surrounding the core, known as the belt area, and are then transmitted to the parabelt area, which is located next to the belt. Simple sounds such as [[pure tone]]s are able to activate the core area of the brain, but both the belt and parabelt areas are activated by only complex sounds, such as those found in [[speech]] and music.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"/&gt; The [[auditory cortex]] in the left hemisphere of the brain is responsible for processing beat and rhythm in music. The right auditory cortex is primarily used in distinguishing between different [[harmonics]], which are simple pure tones that combine to create complex tones.&lt;ref name="Jourdain"&gt;Jourdain, R. (1997). Music, the brain, and ecstasy: How music captures our imagination. New York: William Morrow and Company&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips-Silver et al. (2011) propose that beat deafness is the result of neurological problems in the areas of the brain that are used for recognizing musical beat, rhythm, and time. The main area responsible for processing musical rhythm is the left auditory cortex,&lt;ref name="Jourdain"/&gt; however other areas are most likely involved as well. According to the hypothesis of Phillips-Silver and coworkers, it should therefore be functional abnormalities in the left auditory cortex that cause beat deafness.&lt;ref name="Honing"&gt;Honing, H. ([http://musiccognition.blogspot.com/2011/12/case-of-congenital-beat-deafness-part-2.html 2011]). A case of congenital beat deafness? Amsterdam: Music Matters | A blog on music cognition.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other areas of Mathieu’s brain appeared to be functioning normally, including the areas responsible for [[Auditory system|hearing]] in general and for [[motor control]], which is used in performing the moves in dancing.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Silver"/&gt; Mathieu’s deficiencies are therefore not caused by the inability to hear efficiently or control the movement of his body while dancing. Beat deafness has also not been shown to affect other areas of [[cognitive function]] such as language, which does not involve any sort of underlying beat or sporadic rhythm changes that are associated with music.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Silver"/&gt; Given the normal functioning of Mathieu’s brain, the hypothesis about the beat perception deficit occurring in the brain area for rhythm processing in particular is most likely correct.

Beat deafness is however, a very recent discovery and further research is necessary in gaining complete understanding of the phenomenon and its underlying brain processes.&lt;ref name="Honing"/&gt; In 2016 a study was published that examined the neural correlates of beat perception in two beat-deaf individuals, Mathieu and Marjorie, and a group of control participants. It provided partial support for abnormalities in later cognitive stages of beat processing, reflected in an unreliable P3b component exhibited by Mathieu—but not Marjorie—compared to control participants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 26941591 | doi=10.3389/fnins.2016.00040 | volume=10 | title=Electrical Brain Responses to Beat Irregularities in Two Cases of Beat Deafness | pmc=4764698 | journal=Front Neurosci | pages=40 | last1 = Mathias | first1 = B | last2 = Lidji | first2 = P | last3 = Honing | first3 = H | last4 = Palmer | first4 = C | last5 = Peretz | first5 = I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to tone deafness==
[[Tone deafness]] is characterized by the inability to discriminate between different [[pitch (music)|pitch]]es, which are directly related to the [[frequencies]] of sound waves.&lt;ref name="Foxton"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Foxton | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Nandy | first2 = R.K. | last3 = Griffiths | first3 = T.D. | year = 2006 | title = Rhythm deficits in 'tone deafness' | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 62 | issue = 1| pages = 24–29 | doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2006.03.005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tone deafness is a related, but distinct disorder from beat deafness. People with tone deafness can recognize beat and can move in time to music, but they cannot perceive pitch. People with beat deafness on the other hand, can recognize and distinguish between different tones as well as the average person and can usually sing in tune, so musical pitch is not the issue.&lt;ref name="Phillips-Silver"/&gt; Different areas of the brain in the auditory cortex are involved in the perception of musical pitch and melody, and researchers theorize that tone deafness can potentially be from any of these sections.&lt;ref name="Foxton"/&gt; Both beat deafness and tone deafness are derived from these same areas within the brain.

==Beat perception in animals==
[[File:Cacatua galerita Risdon.jpg|right|thumb|[[Sulphur-crested cockatoo]]s can detect the beat in music.]]
A research team led by Aniruddh D. Patel of [[The Neurosciences Institute]] concluded that [[sulphur-crested cockatoo]]s have the ability to perceive the beat in music and are able to rhythmically move to the tempo of the music as it changes.  Only vocal learning species such as dolphins and parrots are hypothesized to have the ability to perceive beat.  This is because beat perception and movement rely on complex vocal learning which require motor and auditory circuits in the brain. Vocal learning and beat perception do some overlapping in the parts of the brain that account auditory and motor areas. There is no significant evidence for beat perception in nonvocal learning species such as dogs and cats.&lt;ref name="Patel et al"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patel | first1 = A.D. | last2 = Iversen | first2 = J.R. | last3 = Bregman | first3 = M.R. | last4 = Schulz | first4 = I. | year = 2009 | title = Studying synchronization to a musical beat in nonhuman animals | url = http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/spackled/2009readings/Patel_Iversen_Bregman_Schulz_NYAS_in_press.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 1169 | issue = 1| pages = 459–469 | doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.2009.04581.x | pmid=19673824}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[California sea lion]]s, a nonvocal learning animal, have demonstrated the ability to perceive beats in music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cook|first=Peter|last2=Rouse|first2=Andrew|last3=Wilson|first3=Margaret|last4=Reichmuth|first4=Colleen|title=A California sea lion (Zalophus californianus) can keep the beat: Motor entrainment to rhythmic auditory stimuli in a non vocal mimic.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0032345|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=127|issue=4|pages=412–427|doi=10.1037/a0032345|pmid=23544769|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCB, polychorinated biphenyls, are a type of chemical that was widely used in the 1960s and 1970s, and which is a contamination source of soil and water. They are fairly stable and therefore persistent in the environment. '''Bioremediation of PCBs''' is the use of microorganisms to degrade PCBs from contaminated sites, which can be either a soil or aqueous environment. It is a process relying on multiple microorganisms' co-metabolism. [[Anaerobic microorganism]]s dechlorinate PCBs first, and other microorganisms that are capable of doing [[BH pathway]] can break down the dechlorinated PCBs to usable intermediates like [[acyl-CoA]] or [[carbon dioxide]]. If no BH pathway-caple microorganisms are present, dechlorinated PCBs can be mineralized with help of fungi and plants. However, there are multiple limiting factors for this co-metabolism.

== Overview ==

=== PCBs ===
[[File:PCB_general_structure.svg|right|254x254px]]
[[Polychlorinated biphenyl]]s (PCBs) are various [[biphenyl]] based artificial products that are widely used as a [[dielectric]] fluid, industrial [[coolant]], and [[lubricant]]s in the 1960s and 1970s. There is no evidence its synthesis occurs naturally.  They are classified as persistent organic pollutants. PCBs share the basic chemical structure of biphenyl and one or more of the hydrogen atoms on the [[aromatic ring]]s are replaced by chlorine atoms.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Passatore|first=Laura|last2=Rossetti|first2=Simona|last3=Juwarkar|first3=Asha A.|last4=Massacci|first4=Angelo|date=2014-08-15|title=Phytoremediation and bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs): State of knowledge and research perspectives|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389414003963|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|volume=278|pages=189–202|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2014.05.051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCBs is in viscous liquid form at normal temperature and has a poor solubility in water. The aromatic hydrocarbon structure gives PCBs relatively high molecular stability. The chlorine substitution further reinforces its insolubility and chemical stability. Hence, the degradation of PCBs in the natural environment is very slow, which can range from 3 to 37 years depending on the number of chloride substitutions and their positions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Bioremediation ===
[[Bioremediation]] is a waste removal method that uses microorganisms to degrade or remove wastes like organic waste and heavy metal from contaminated sites including both soil and water. The advantages of bioremediation are that it is environment-friendly, inexpensive and can remove multiple wastes simultaneously comparing with traditional chemical and physical processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/805006965|title=Bioremediation methods and protocols|last=P.,|first=Cummings, Stephen|date=2010-01-01|publisher=Humana Press|isbn=9781607614395|oclc=805006965}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Degradation Process ==
Various microorganisms are involved in a two-stage process of degradation of PCBs, which happens in aerobic and anaerobic environments. Degrading PCBs is similar to the degradation of biphenyl.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the chlorines on PCBs prevent them from being utilized as a substrate of biphenyl degradation. Due to high chemical stability, PCBs cannot be used as energy sources.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ohtsubo|first=Yoshiyuki|last2=Kudo|first2=Toshiaki|last3=Tsuda|first3=Masataka|last4=Nagata|first4=Yuji|date=2004-08-01|title=Strategies for bioremediation of polychlorinated biphenyls|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00253-004-1654-y|journal=Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology|language=en|volume=65|issue=3|pages=250–258|doi=10.1007/s00253-004-1654-y|issn=0175-7598}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the chlorination, PCBs can be used as electron acceptors in anaerobic respiration to store energy, which is also the first stage of the degradation pathway, reductive dechlorination.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Once the PCBs are dechlorinated to a certain degree, usually lower than five chlorines presenting in the structure and one aromatic ring has no chlorine,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; they can undergo the biphenyl degradation pathway (BP pathway) to be degraded to accessible carbon or CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the aerobic environment. BP pathway is a pathway that utilizes series of enzymes ([[BphA]], B, C, D, E, F, G) to convert biphenyl to [[TCA Cycle|TCA cycle]] intermediates ([[pyruvate]] and [[Acyl-CoA]]) and [[benzoate]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, there are few microorganisms that can dechlorinate substrate under natural conditions. Even with selective media, the accumulation of PCB dechlorinating microorganisms is still slow, which is one reason for the slow degradation rate. As a result, PCBs usually go through a co-metabolism pathway that involving different microorganism species.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vasilyeva|first=G. K.|last2=Strijakova|first2=E. R.|date=2007-12-01|title=Bioremediation of soils and sediments contaminated by polychlorinated biphenyls|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1134/S002626170706001X|journal=Microbiology|language=en|volume=76|issue=6|pages=639–653|doi=10.1134/S002626170706001X|issn=0026-2617}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally speaking, there are four steps in this process:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# In order for PCBs to enter the cell, they firstly need to be solubilized.
# PCBs are dechlorinated by anaerobic bacteria, then transport the metabolites to [[aerobic bacteria]] or fungi through a [[biofilm]].
# The presence of PCBs metabolites triggers the expression of enzymes in BP pathway.
# PCBs are broken down to Acetyl-CoA and then can be utilized or carbon dioxide.
The Figure below shows the complete degradation pathway.  [[File:PCBs' Degradation Pathway.jpg|thumb|495x495px]]

== Limiting Factors ==

=== PCBs entering the cells ===
PCBs have low water solubility, so they adhere tightly to soil and cannot be easily accessed by bacteria. Especially, if the contaminations site has been exposed to PCBs for long period, PCBs can be integrated into soil or sediment matrices, then further decrease their bioavailability. Some surfactants can help solubilize but cannot increase the rate of PCBs degrading. However, if PCBs are linked to surfactants tightly too, then this process cannot promote the absorption of PCBs and even lower it. Also, many surfactants have been proven to be toxic to cells and the high cost of surfactants is another issues.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== PCBs properties ===
PCBs are toxic to bacterial communities above 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. However, if the concentration is too low (lower than 50&amp;nbsp;mg/kg), the degradation slows down significantly, for there is not enough material to stimulate the expression of required genes and support the growth of competent microorganisms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; PCBs includes various different compounds with slightly different structures. Those slight differences make big differences in metabolic rate. Generally speaking, the more chlorines in a PCB molecule, the harder for it to be degraded. In particular,  microorganisms cannot degrade di- and tetra-ortho substituted well. It is possible that those structures prevent enzymes from accessing reaction sites.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Soil and sediment characteristics ===
First, the soil and [[sediment]] structures will determine how tightly PCBs are adhered to them and affect the absorption of PCBs into cells. The PCBs’ availability suffers from increasing organic carbon and clay content, for they promote the absorption of PCBs into soil or sediment matrices.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Second, the soil contains necessary nutrition for the growth of microbes and anaerobic and aerobic environments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Finally, the local microbial population has significant impacts on the rate of degradation of PCBs, which varies based on the microbial strains and their activities. Then, if there is no history of exposure to PCBs, it may take months for microbes to activates their ability to dechlorinate PCBs and break them down.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Gene expression and bottleneck effect of metabolites ===
PCBs or biphenyl cannot provide energy for microbes, so they are primary energy and carbon sources. As stated before it takes months sometimes for microorganisms to activate their gene for dichlorine after the first exposure to PCBs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It has been proposed to use analogs to promote the activation of genes. However, even after the metabolic pathway is activated, the intermediates of the pathway create a bottleneck effect due to their toxicity. Also, there is the possibility that BP pathway leads to [[protoanemonin]] which is a dead-end metabolite that cannot be utilized by cells. Due to the high energy cost of this pathway, if no preferred energy source present in the system, cells will not activate this pathway.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2520">'''Bolster heath''' or '''cushion moorland''' is a type of vegetation community that features a patchwork of very low growing, tightly packed plants found at the limits of some [[Alpine climate|alpine]] environments. The [[cushion plant]]s form a smooth surfaced 'cushions' from several different plants, hence the common name of '''cushion heath'''.  The cushion growth habit provides protection against the desiccating wind and help keep the cluster warm.

Bolster heath is very slow growing and thus very fragile.  Most propagation is by slow expansion, although two species, ''[[Abrotanella forsteroides]]'' and ''[[Pterygopappus lawrencei]]'' produce enough viable seed to survive fire.  The other species are generally permanently destroyed by fire.

The soil in bolster heath is generally quite poor, often gravel with a thin layer of [[peat]].

The lane labelled "control" is for quality control purposes and contains the DNA fragment but not treated with [[DNase]]I. ]]

A '''DNase footprinting assay'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0076-6879(86)30011-9 |vauthors=Brenowitz M, Senear DF, Shea MA, Ackers GK |title=Quantitative DNase footprint titration: a method for studying protein-DNA interactions |journal=Methods in Enzymology |volume=130 |issue= |pages=132–81 |year=1986 |pmid=3773731 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[DNA footprinting]] technique from [[molecular biology]]/[[biochemistry]] that detects [[DNA]]-[[protein]] interaction using the fact that a protein bound to DNA will often protect that DNA from enzymatic cleavage. This makes it possible to locate a protein binding site on a particular DNA molecule. The method uses an enzyme, [[deoxyribonuclease]] (DNase, for short), to cut the radioactively end-labeled DNA, followed by [[gel electrophoresis]] to detect the resulting cleavage pattern.

For example, the DNA fragment of interest may be [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]] amplified using a &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P 5' labeled primer, with the result being many DNA molecules with a radioactive label on one end of one strand of each double stranded molecule. Cleavage by DNase will produce fragments. The fragments which are smaller with respect to the &lt;sup&gt;32&lt;/sup&gt;P-labelled end will appear further on the gel than the longer fragments. The gel is then used to expose a special photographic film.

The cleavage pattern of the DNA in the absence of a DNA binding protein, typically referred to as free DNA, is compared to the cleavage pattern of DNA in the presence of a DNA binding protein. If the protein binds DNA, the binding site is protected from enzymatic cleavage. This protection will result in a clear area on the gel which is referred to as the "footprint".

By varying the concentration of the DNA-binding protein, the binding affinity of the protein can be estimated according to the minimum concentration of protein at which a footprint is observed.

This technique was developed by David Galas and Albert Schmitz at Geneva in 1977&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Galas DJ, Schmitz A |title=DNAse footprinting: a simple method for the detection of protein-DNA binding specificity |journal=Nucleic Acids Research |volume=5 |issue=9 |pages=3157–70 |date=Sep 1978 |pmid=212715 |pmc=342238 |doi= 10.1093/nar/5.9.3157|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=212715}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2172">'''de Vaucouleurs' law''', also known as the '''de Vaucouleurs profile''' or '''de Vaucouleurs model''', describes how the surface brightness &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of an [[elliptical galaxy]] varies as a function of apparent distance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; from the center of the galaxy:&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1948AnAp...11..247D  Recherches sur les Nebuleuses Extragalactiques]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\ln I(R) = \ln I_{0} - k R^{1/4}.
&lt;/math&gt;

By defining ''R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' as the radius of the [[Contour_line#Other_phenomena|isophote]] containing half of the total luminosity, de Vaucouleurs' profile may be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\ln I(R) = \ln I_{e} + 7.669 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{R}{R_{e}} \right)^{1/4} \right]
&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;
I(R) = I_{e} e^{-7.669 \left[ \left(\frac{R}{R_{e}}\right)^{1/4} - 1 \right]}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''I&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the surface brightness at ''R&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''. This can be confirmed by noting

:&lt;math&gt;
\int^{R_e}_0 I(r)2\pi r dr = \frac{1}{2} \int^{\infty}_0 I(r)2\pi r dr  .
&lt;/math&gt;

de Vaucouleurs' model is a special case of [[Sersic's law|Sersic's model]], with [[Sersic index]] n=4.  A number of (internal) density profiles that approximately reproduce de Vaucouleurs' law after projection onto the plane of the sky include [[Jaffe profile|Jaffe's model]] and [[Dehnen profile|Dehnen's model]].

The model is named after [[Gérard de Vaucouleurs]] who first formulated it in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Gerard Henri de Vaucouleurs (1918 - 1995)|journal=Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="American Institute of Physics 2015"&gt;{{cite web | title=Gerard De Vaucouleurs | website=American Institute of Physics | date=2015-01-15 | url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/33930 | access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although an empirical model rather than a law of physics, it was so entrenched in astronomy during the 20th century that it was referred to as a "law".

The '''Developmental Leadership Program''' (DLP, or DLPROG) is an international research and policy initiative. The Program looks at the political processes that underpin development goals such as sustainable economic growth, political stability and inclusive social development.  In particular, DLP explores the central role of leaders, elites and coalitions in developing countries and how they can help or hinder the positive reform of institutions and policies in the public, private and civil society sectors. DLP is funded primarily by [http://aid.dfat.gov.au/makediff/Pages/default.aspx the Australian Aid Program].

==Background==

===The core aims and activities of DLP===
The core aim of DLP is to develop a clearer understanding of the political processes that support developmental change and to embed that understanding in the thinking, policies and practices of the wider development community. DLP does this by:
* Undertaking, commissioning and publishing high quality, policy-relevant research. 
* Organising international seminars and workshop sessions. 
* Providing clear policy guidance, country-level operational guidance and political analysis tools for development practitioners and policy makers.

===Central argument: politics is the key===
* At the core of DLP’s work is the recognition that politics is central to the development process.   
* Development is not just a technical challenge or a question or transferring information, skills or resources. These are important but it is also crucial that development is supported and sustained by local political agents and processes.     
* Politics is understood by DLP in very broad terms, as all of the various activities of conflict, negotiation and co-operation that occur when people with different interests, ideas and degrees of influence have to make collective decisions about rules, resources and power.  
* Politics occurs at all levels and in all sectors and organisations in society. It unfolds through formal rules and institutions but also informal norms, customs and understandings.  Politics is the key to the peaceful management of differences and disagreements, from energy policy in China and India through to the informal networks that promote women’s rights in Egypt and Jordan.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example: Harrison, T. and Kostka, G. (2012) “Manoeuvres for a Low Carbon State: The Local Politics of Climate Change in China and India”, DLP Research Paper 22; and Tadros, M. (2011) “Working Politically Behind Red Lines: Structure and agency in a comparative study of women’s coalitions in Egypt and Jordan”, DLP Research Paper 12. http://www.dlprog.org/ftp/&lt;/ref&gt;    
* Leadership is central to politics and DLP aims to improve understanding of the role of leaders, elites and coalitions in promoting (or frustrating) inclusive political settlements, stable polities, sustainable economic growth and inclusive social development – particularly in the context of weak and fragile states.

==Organisational structure==
DLP is run by a Program Management Team. While DLP's funding comes primarily from the Australian national government, the Program is independent and autonomous.  	
As of July 2014, DLP's management team consists of:

* ''[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/government-society/marquette-heather.aspx Heather Marquette]'', International Development Department, University of Birmingham - Director
* ''[http://www.ucl.ac.uk/spp/people/david-hudson David Hudson]'', Department of Political Science, University College London - Deputy Director
* ''[http://www.latrobe.edu.au/humanities/about/staff/profile?uname=croche Chris Roche]'', Institute for Human Security and Social Change, La Trobe University, Melbourne - Senior Research Partner
* ''Heather Lyne de Ver'', International Development Department, University of Birmingham - Program Manager

===History===
DLP has its origins in the work of the Leaders, Elites and Coalitions Research Program (LECRP), which began in 2007.  It evolved into the Leadership Program: Developmental Leaders, Elites and Coalitions (LPDLEC) in 2009 before adopting its current form.

== Activism ==
Reynaga became a sex worker at 19.  After being a victim of institutional violence and experiencing imprisonment multiple times in Argentinar, she travelled to work in Spain for a time. She   returned to Argentina and founded AMMAR in 1994  in response to police harassment and violence. 

According to the organization, between 1996 and 2001, 41 member of AMMAR were murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ammar.org.ar/-Quienes-somos-.html|title=ammar.org.ar|website=www.ammar.org.ar|access-date=2018-06-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016135956/http://www.ammar.org.ar/-Quienes-somos-.html|archivedate=2017-10-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; AMMAR operates as a trade union and since 1995 it has been an affiliated member of the [[Argentine Workers' Central Union]] (''Central de Trabajadores de la Argentina''). AMMAR has also been part of RedTraSex since 1997;  Reynaga has been its Executive Secretary since 1999. The organization works for the defence, promotion, recognition and respect for human rights of sex workers in fifteen countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.redtrasex.org/-Sobre-Nosotras-|title=RedTraSex|website=www.redtrasex.org|access-date=2018-06-04|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205234300/http://www.redtrasex.org/-Sobre-Nosotras-|archivedate=2017-12-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reynaga co-edited  ''Un Movimiento de Tacones Altos'' (The High Heels Movement) a manual for the defense of sex workers' rights published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.redtrasex.org/IMG/pdf/armado-manual.pdf|title=El Movimiento de Tacones Altos|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180608115936/https://www.redtrasex.org/IMG/pdf/armado-manual.pdf|archivedate=2018-06-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[intelligent agent]] that interacts with the environment through a physical body within that environment.  Agents that are represented graphically with a body, for example a human or a cartoon animal, are also called embodied agents, although they have only virtual, not physical, embodiment. A branch of artificial intelligence focuses on empowering such agents to interact autonomously with [[human being]]s and the environment. [[Mobile robot]]s are one example of physically embodied agents; [[Ananova]] and [[Microsoft Agent]] are examples of graphically embodied agents. '''Embodied conversational agents''' are embodied agents (usually with a graphical front-end as opposed to a robotic body) that are capable of engaging in conversation with one another and with humans employing the same verbal and nonverbal means that humans do (such as gesture, facial expression, and so forth).

Face-to-face communication allows communication protocols that give a much richer communication channel than other means of communicating. It enables pragmatic communication acts such as conversational [[turn-taking]], facial expression of [[emotion]]s, information structure and emphasis, visualisation and iconic gestures, and orientation in a three-dimensional environment.  This communication takes place through both verbal and non-verbal channels such as [[gaze]], [[gesture]], spoken intonation and body posture.

Research has found that users prefer a non-verbal visual indication of an embodied system's internal state to a verbal indication,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

One example result from a recent study indicates the power of a character when moderating search inquiries. When a character asked people to type search requests into a window, people used, on average, three more words in their requests (averaging about 7 words per inquiry) compared to identical requests made without a character. Character suggest that a conversational style is appropriate, resulting in higher liking for the
interaction on the part of the user, and better accuracy for the engine generating the required results.&lt;ref name="The Benefits of Interactive Online Characters"&gt;{{cite web

This rich style of communication that characterises human [[conversation]] makes conversational interaction with embodied [[conversational agents]] ideal for many non-traditional interaction tasks. A familiar application of graphically embodied agents is [[computer games]]; embodied agents are ideal for this setting because the richer communication style makes interacting with the agent enjoyable.  Embodied conversational agents have also been used in [[E-Learning|virtual training environments]], portable personal navigation guides, interactive fiction and [[storytelling]] systems, [[interactive online character]]s and automated presenters and commentators.{{cn|date=April 2017}}

An '''emission intensity''' (also '''carbon intensity''', '''C.I.''') is the emission rate of a given [[pollutant]] relative to the intensity of a specific activity, or an industrial production process; for example [[gram]]s of [[carbon dioxide]] released per [[megajoule]] of energy produced, or the ratio of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions produced to [[gross domestic product]] (GDP). Emission intensities are used to derive estimates of [[air pollutant]] or greenhouse gas emissions based on the amount of fuel [[combustion|combusted]], the number of animals in [[animal husbandry]], on industrial production levels, distances traveled or similar activity data. Emission intensities may also be used to compare the environmental impact of different fuels or activities. In some case the related terms '''emission factor''' and '''carbon intensity''' are used interchangeably. The jargon used can be different, for different fields/industrial sectors; normally the term "carbon" excludes other pollutants, such as particulate emissions. One commonly used figure is '''carbon intensity per kilowatt-hour''' ('''CIPK'''), which is used to compare emissions from different sources of electrical power.

==Methodologies==
Different methodologies can be used to assess the carbon intensity of a process. Among the most used methodologies there are:
* The whole [[life-cycle assessment]] (LCA): this includes not only the carbon emissions due to a specific process, but also those due to the production and end-of-life of materials, plants and machineries used for the considered process. This is a quite complex method, requiring a big set of variables.
* The well-to-wheels (WTW), commonly used in the Energy and Transport sectors: this is a simplified LCA considering the emissions of the process itself, the emissions due to the extraction and refining of the material (or fuel) used in the process (also "Upstream emissions", but excluding the emissions due to the production and end-of-life of plants and machineries. This methodology is used, in the U.S.A., by the [[GREET model]] and in Europe in the [http://iet.jrc.ec.europa.eu/about-jec/jec-well-wheels-analyses-wtw JEC WTW].
* WTW-LCA hybrid methods, trying to fill in the gap between the WTW and LCA methods. In example, for an Electric Vehicle, an hybrid method considering also the GHG due to the manufacturing and the end of life of the battery gives GHG emissions 10-13% higher, compared to the WTW  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Helmers E|title=A new hybrid method for reducing the gap between WTW and LCA in the carbon footprint assessment of electric vehicles|journal=Int J Life Cycle Assess |volume=22|pages=4–14|doi=10.1007/s11367-015-0954-z|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Methods not considering LCA aspects but only the emissions occurring during a specific process; i.e. just the combustion of a fuel in a power plant, without considering the Upstream emissions.&lt;ref&gt;This method is used by the [[International Energy Agency]] in the annual report: [https://www.iea.org/statistics/relateddatabases/co2emissionsfromfuelcombustion/ CO2 emissions from fuel combustion].&lt;/ref&gt;

Different calculation methods can lead to different results. The results can largely vary also for different geographic regions and timeframes (see, in example, [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1361920916307933 how C.I. of electricity varies, for different European countries, and how varied in a few years]: from 2009 to 2013 the C.I. of electricity in the European Union fell on average by 20%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Lonza L|title=Electricity carbon intensity in European Member States: Impacts on GHG emissions of electric vehicles|journal=Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment|volume=64|pages=5–14|doi=10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.012|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; So while comparing different values of Carbon Intensity it is important to correctly consider all the boundary conditions (or initial hypotheses) considered for the calculations. For example, Chinese oil fields emit between 1.5 to more than 40 g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq per MJ with about 90% of all fields emitting 1.5–13.5 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;eq.&lt;ref name="Masnadi"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Masnadi|first1=M.|title=Well-to-refinery emissions and net-energy analysis of China's crude-oil supply|journal=Nature Energy|date=2018|volume=3|issue=3|pages=220–226|doi=10.1038/s41560-018-0090-7|bibcode=2018NatEn...3..220M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such highly skewed carbon intensity patterns necessitate disaggregation of seemingly homogenous emission activities and proper consideration of many factors for understanding.&lt;ref name="Höök2018"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Höök|first1=M|title=Mapping Chinese supply|journal=Nature Energy|date=2018|volume=3|issue=3|pages=166–167|doi=10.1038/s41560-018-0103-6|bibcode=2018NatEn...3..166H}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:AirPollutionSource.jpg|thumb|right|155px|An air pollution emission source]]

== Estimating emissions ==

Emission factors assume a linear relation between the intensity of the activity and the emission resulting from this activity:

''Emission&lt;sub&gt;pollutant&lt;/sub&gt; = Activity * Emission Factor&lt;sub&gt;pollutant&lt;/sub&gt;''

Intensities are also used in projecting possible future scenarios such as those used in the [[International Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] assessments, along with projected future changes in population, economic activity and energy technologies. The interrelations of these variables is treated under the so-called [[Kaya identity]].

The level of uncertainty of the resulting estimates depends significantly on the source category and the pollutant. Some examples: 
*[[Carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) emissions from the combustion of fuel can be estimated with a high degree of certainty regardless of how the fuel is used as these emissions depend almost exclusively on the [[carbon]] content of the fuel, which is generally known with a high degree of precision. The same is true for [[sulphur dioxide]] (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), since sulphur contents of fuels are also generally well known. Both carbon and sulphur are almost completely oxidized during combustion and all carbon and sulphur atoms in the fuel will be present in the [[flue gas]]es as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.
*In contrast, the levels of other air pollutants and non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; greenhouse gas emissions from combustion depend on the precise technology applied when fuel is combusted. These emissions are basically caused by either incomplete combustion of a small fraction of the fuel ([[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], [[non-methane volatile organic compound]]s) or by complicated chemical and physical processes during the combustion and in the smoke stack or tailpipe. Examples of these are [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulates]], NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;, a mixture of [[nitric oxide]], NO, and [[nitrogen dioxide]], NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
*[[Nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) emissions from agricultural soils are highly uncertain because they depend very much on both the exact conditions of the soil, the application of [[fertilizers]] and [[Meteorology|meteorological]] conditions.

==Energy sources emission intensity per unit of energy generated==

In 2009 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity of GDP in the OECD countries reduced by 2.9%  and amounted to 0.33 kCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/$05p in the OECD countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yearbook.enerdata.net/CO2-intensity-data.html|title=CO2 intensity - Map World CO2 Intensity by region - Enerdata|website=yearbook.enerdata.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; ("$05p" = 2005 US dollars, using purchasing power parities). The USA posted a higher ratio of 0.41 kCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/$05p while Europe showed the largest drop in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity compared to the previous year (−3.7%). CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity continued to be roughly higher in non-OECD countries. Despite a slight improvement, China continued to post a high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity (0.81 kCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/$05p). CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity in Asia rose by 2% during 2009 since energy consumption continued to develop at a strong pace. Important ratios were also observed in countries in CIS and the Middle East.

=== Carbon intensity in Europe ===

Total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from energy use were 5% below their 1990 level in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odyssee-indicators.org/|title=Energy Efficiency Trends &amp; Policies - ODYSSEE-MURE|website=www.odyssee-indicators.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the period 1990–2007, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from energy use have decreased on average by 0.3%/year although the economic activity (GDP) increased by 2.3%/year. After dropping until 1994 (−1.6%/year), the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions have increased steadily (0.4%/year on average) until 2003 and decreased slowly again since (on average by 0.6%/year). Total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions per capita decreased from 8.7 t in 1990 to 7.8 t in 2007, that is to say a decrease by 10%.
Almost 40% of the reduction in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity is due to increased use of energy carriers with lower emission factors.
Total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions per unit of GDP, the “CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intensity”, decreased more rapidly than energy intensity: by 2.3%/year and 1.4%/year, respectively, on average between 1990 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;This section deals with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from energy combustion published in official inventories from the European Environment Agency. The indicators are not expressed under normal climate conditions (i. e. with climate corrections) to comply with the official definition of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inventories. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions of final consumers include the emissions of auto producers.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commodity Exchange Bratislava]] (CEB) has calculated carbon intensity for [[Voluntary Emissions Reduction]] projects carbon intensity in 2012 to be 0.343 tn/MWh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kbb.sk/files/calculation-of-cabon-intensity-2012.pdf Calculation of carbon intensity in 2012] kbb.sk, Slovakia&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emission factors for greenhouse gas inventory reporting ==

One of the most important uses of emission factors is for the reporting of national [[Greenhouse gas inventory|greenhouse gas inventories]] under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC). The so-called [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex I Parties]] to the UNFCCC have to annually report their national total emissions of greenhouse gases in a formalized reporting format, defining the source categories and fuels that must be included.

The UNFCCC has accepted the '''Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gl/invs6.html |title=Revised 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories |publisher=IPCC |author=Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories |year=1996 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed and published by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) as the emission estimation methods that must be used by the parties to the convention to ensure transparency, completeness, consistency, comparability and accuracy of the national greenhouse gas inventories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2004/sbsta/08.pdf |title=FCCC/SBSTA/2004/8 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; These IPCC Guidelines are the primary source for default emission factors. Recently IPCC has published the '''2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories'''. These and many more greenhouse gas emission factors can be found on IPCC's Emission Factor Database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/EFDB/main.php |title=Emission Factor Database – Main Page |publisher=IPCC |year=2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercially applicable organisational greenhouse gas emission factors can be found on the search engine, EmissionFactors.com.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://emissionfactors.com/ |title=Emission Factors |work=emissionfactors.com |year=2012 |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly for non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, there is often a high degree of uncertainty associated with these emission factors when applied to individual countries. In general, the use of country-specific emission factors would provide more accurate estimates of emissions than the use of the default emission factors. According to the IPCC, if an activity is a major source of emissions for a country ('key source'), it is 'good practice' to develop a country-specific emission factor for that activity.

== Emission factors for air pollutant inventory reporting ==
The [[UNECE|United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] and the EU [[National Emission Ceilings Directive]] (2016) require countries to produce annual National Air Pollution Emission Inventories under the provisions of the [[Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution]] (CLRTAP).

The [[European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme]] (EMEP) Task Force of the [[European Environment Agency]] has developed methods to estimate emissions and the associated emission factors for air pollutants, which have been published in the EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.eea.europa.eu/themes/air/emep-eea-air-pollutant-emission-inventory-guidebook EMEP/CORINAIR Emission Inventory Guidebook].eea.europa.eu, 2016, retrieved 13.7.2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emep.int/|title=EMEP Home|website=www.emep.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Emission Inventories and Projections TFEIP.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080315073635/http://tfeip-secretariat.org/unece.htm TFEIP], 2008-03-15 tfeip-secretariat&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. plans to cut carbon intensity per dollar of GDP by 18% by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/04/20070420-9.html White house fact sheet: Earth day 2007] (see section on ''providing a Realistic growth-orientated approach to climate change''&lt;/ref&gt; This has been criticised by the World Resources Institute as this approach does not ensure absolute reductions if GDP grows faster than intensity declines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wri.org/stories/2007/04/chinas-carbon-intensity-target# |title=China's Carbon Intensity Target |author=Tim Herzog |publisher=World resources Institute |date=2007-04-27 |accessdate=2010-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1990 to 2000, the carbon intensity of the U.S. economy declined by 17%, yet total emissions increased by 14%.&lt;ref name=bfr&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth-policy.org/index.php?/indicators/C52/carbon_emissions_2002 |title=Carbon Emissions Climbing |publisher=Earth Policy Institute |accessdate=2006-08-12 |year=2001 |last=Fischlowitz-Roberts |first=Bernie}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the U.S. National Environmental trust labelled carbon intensity, "a bookkeeping trick which allows the administration to do nothing about global warming while unsafe levels of emissions continue to rise."&lt;ref name=net.org&gt;[http://www.net.org/reports/rollbacks/warming.vtml "National Environmental Trust Special Reports", 2002.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4882">An '''Exposure Action Value''' ('''EAV''') or '''Action Value''' ('''AV''') is a limit set on occupational exposure to noise where, when those values are exceeded, employers must take steps to monitor the exposure levels.  These levels are measured in [[decibels]].  The American [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) set the EAV to 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A).  When the eight-hour time-weighted average (TWA) reaches 85&amp;nbsp;dB(A), employers are required to administer a continuing, effective [[hearing conservation program]].  The program consists of monitoring, employee notification, observation, an audiometric testing program, hearing protectors, training programs, and record keeping requirements.

== Purpose ==
The purpose of the EAV is to ensure that employees are not suffering from high levels of noise exposure.  OSHA requires employers to take steps to reduce exposure levels when the TWA reaches 90 dB(A).  The EAV is to ensure that the exposure levels do not reach 90 dB(A) or more.  It is also to ensure that employees are not experiencing [[noise-induced hearing loss]].

== Use ==
A [[noise dosimeter]] is used to measure noise exposures to employees.  Dosimeters can be used to determine the TWA.  If it is determined that levels of noise exposure have reached the EAV, employers are required to implement a hearing conservation program.  The hearing conservation program consists of many different aspects.

The first aspect is monitoring.  The employer is required to monitor noise exposure for all of its employees who may be exposed at a TWA at or above 85 dB(A).  This is to identify employees for inclusion in the hearing conservation program and to enable the proper selection of hearing protectors.

The second aspect is the audiometric testing program.  Employees exposed to levels at or above the EAV will undergo audiometric testing.  The first test is called a baseline.  It provides a standard to compare future audiometric tests to.  If a significant change in hearing capabilities occurs (called a standard threshold shift) greater steps must be taken to ensure the employee is protected from high levels of noise exposure.

The third aspect is the implementation of hearing protection.  Employers must make hearing protection available to all employees who are exposed to noise levels of 85 dB(A) or greater.  This is to be at no cost to employees.  Employees can pick whichever type of hearing protection they prefer.  This also requires an ongoing evaluation of the hearing protection.

The fourth aspect is a training program.  The training program must cover the effects of noise on hearing, the purpose of hearing protection, and the purpose of audiometric testing.

The last aspect is record keeping.  Records of employee audiometric tests must be retained for two years.  This information must also be available to the employees.

== Vibration ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[image: Hse-gov-uk-elv-values.JPG|thumb|550px|right|''EAV's'' and ''ELV's'' given by the Health and Safety Executive of the UK|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 6 September 2009}}]] --&gt;
Just like the Exposure Action Value or Action Value for noise, safety administrations across the world are publishing values for vibrations.  As of right now, The American Occupational Safety and Health Administration has not officially published a list of appropriate, time-weighted EAV guidelines for employers to follow.  However, companies in the United States are encouraged by the [[NIOSH|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] to follow the vibration limits set up by the [[American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists|ACGIH]], which publishes a ''Threshold Limit Value'' or ''TLV'' in their annual book of TLVs and BEIs.  The goal is for employers to have these numbers in order to make a conscious effort to lower the amount of harmful exposure absorbed by their workers.  Since the link from physical vibration to damage caused by [[Raynaud's phenomenon]] is less clearly defined between the EAV for noise and noise-induced hearing loss, an upper extreme limit ''Exposure Limit Value'' or ''ELV'' is provided as well to give a margin.

A '''Finite State Machine with Datapath''' (FSMD) is a [[mathematical abstraction]] that is sometimes used to design [[digital logic]] or [[computer program]]s.

An FSMD is a digital system composed of a [[finite-state machine]], which controls the [[program flow]], and a [[datapath]], which performs data processing operations.

FSMDs are essentially sequential programs in which statements have been scheduled into states, thus resulting in more complex state diagrams.

Here, a program is converted into a complex state diagram in which states and arcs may include [[arithmetic expression]]s, and those expressions may use external inputs and outputs as well as variables.

FSMs do not use variables or arithmetic operations/conditions, thus FSMDs are more powerful than FSMs.

The FSMD level of abstraction is often referred to as the [[register-transfer level]].

FSMD is equivalent to [[Turing machine]] in power.

[[File:Yaw Axis Corrected.svg|right|325px]]

'''Flight dynamics''' is the science of [[aircraft|air]] vehicle orientation and control in three dimensions. The three critical flight dynamics parameters are the [[angles of rotation]] in three [[dimensions]] about the vehicle's  [[center of mass]], known as ''pitch'', ''roll'' and ''yaw''.

[[Aerospace engineer]]s develop [[control system]]s for a vehicle's orientation (attitude) about its [[center of mass]]. The control systems include actuators, which exert forces in various directions, and generate rotational forces or [[moment (physics)|moment]]s about the [[aerodynamic center]] of the aircraft, and thus rotate the aircraft in pitch, roll, or yaw.  For example, a [[pitching moment]] is a vertical force applied at a distance forward or aft from the aerodynamic center of the [[aircraft]], causing the aircraft to pitch up or down.

Roll, pitch and yaw refer to rotations about the respective axes starting from a defined [[steady flight]] equilibrium state.  The equilibrium roll angle is known as wings level or zero bank angle, equivalent to a level [[Heeling (sailing)|heeling]] angle on a ship. Yaw is known as "heading".  The equilibrium [[pitch angle (engineering)|pitch angle]] in submarine and airship parlance is known as "trim", but in aircraft, "trim" usually refers to the equilibrium [[angle of attack]], rather than orientation.  However, common usage ignores this distinction between equilibrium and dynamic cases.

The most common aeronautical convention defines the roll as acting about the longitudinal axis, positive with the starboard (right) wing down.  The yaw is about the vertical body axis, positive with the nose to starboard. Pitch is about an axis perpendicular to the longitudinal plane of symmetry, positive nose up.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A [[fixed-wing aircraft]] increases or decreases the lift generated by the wings when it pitches nose up or down by increasing or decreasing the [[angle of attack]] (AOA). The roll angle is also known as bank angle on a fixed-wing aircraft, which usually "banks" to change the horizontal direction of flight. An aircraft is usually streamlined from nose to tail to reduce [[Drag (physics)|drag]] making it typically advantageous to keep the sideslip angle near zero, though there are instances when an aircraft may be deliberately "sideslipped" for example a [[Slip (aerodynamic)|slip]] in a fixed-wing aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Introduction ==

=== Reference frames ===
{{main|axes conventions}}
Three [[Right-hand rule|right-handed]], [[Cartesian coordinate systems]] see frequent use in flight dynamics. The first coordinate system has an origin fixed in the reference frame of the Earth:
*Earth frame
** Origin - arbitrary, fixed relative to the surface of the Earth
** ''x&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive in the direction of [[north]]
** ''y&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive in the direction of [[east]]
** ''z&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive towards the center of the Earth
In many flight dynamics applications, the Earth frame is assumed to be inertial with a flat ''x&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'',''y&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''-plane, though the Earth frame can also be considered a [[spherical coordinate system]] with origin at the center of the Earth.

The other two reference frames are body-fixed, with origins moving along with the aircraft, typically at the center of gravity. For an aircraft that is symmetric from right-to-left, the frames can be defined as:
*Body frame
** Origin - airplane center of gravity
** ''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive out the nose of the aircraft in the plane of symmetry of the aircraft
** ''z&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - perpendicular to the ''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis, in the plane of symmetry of the aircraft, positive below the aircraft
** ''y&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - perpendicular to the ''x&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'',''z&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''-plane, positive determined by the [[right-hand rule]] (generally, positive out the right wing)
*Wind frame
** Origin - airplane center of gravity
** ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - positive in the direction of the velocity vector of the aircraft relative to the air
** ''z&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - perpendicular to the ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis, in the plane of symmetry of the aircraft, positive below the aircraft
** ''y&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis - perpendicular to the ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'',''z&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''-plane, positive determined by the right hand rule (generally, positive to the right)

Asymmetric aircraft have analogous body-fixed frames, but different conventions must be used to choose the precise directions of the ''x'' and ''z'' axes.

The Earth frame is a convenient frame to express aircraft translational and rotational kinematics. The Earth frame is also useful in that, under certain assumptions, it can be approximated as inertial. Additionally, one force acting on the aircraft, weight, is fixed in the +''z&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction.

The body frame is often of interest because the origin and the axes remain fixed relative to the aircraft. This means that the relative orientation of the Earth and body frames describes the aircraft attitude. Also, the direction of the force of thrust is generally fixed in the body frame, though some aircraft can vary this direction, for example by [[thrust vectoring]].

The wind frame is a convenient frame to express the aerodynamic forces and moments acting on an aircraft. In particular, the net [[aerodynamic force]] can be divided into components along the wind frame axes, with the [[Aerodynamic drag|drag force]] in the −''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction and the [[Lift (force)|lift force]] in the −''z&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' direction.

In addition to defining the reference frames, the relative orientation of the reference frames can be determined. The relative orientation can be expressed in a variety of forms, including:
* [[rotation matrix|Direction cosine or rotation matrices]]
* [[Euler angles]]
* [[Quaternion]]s
The various Euler angles relating the three reference frames are important to flight dynamics. Many Euler angle conventions exist, but all of the rotation sequences presented below use the ''z-y'-x"'' convention. This convention corresponds to a type of [[Euler angles#Tait–Bryan angles|Tait-Bryan angles]], which are commonly referred to as Euler angles. This convention is described in detail below for the roll, pitch, and yaw Euler angles that describe the body frame orientation relative to the Earth frame. The other sets of Euler angles are described below by analogy.

To transform from the Earth frame to the body frame using Euler angles, the following rotations are done in the order prescribed. First, rotate the Earth frame axes ''x&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''y&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' around the ''z&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;'' axis by the yaw angle ''ψ''. This results in an intermediate reference frame with axes denoted ''x{{'}}'',y{{'}}'',z{{'}}'', where ''z'=z&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;''. Second, rotate the ''x{{'}}'' and ''z{{'}}'' axes around the ''y{{'}}'' axis by the pitch angle ''θ''. This results in another intermediate reference frame with axes denoted ''x",y",z"'', where ''y"=y{{'}}''. Finally, rotate the ''y"'' and ''z"'' axes around the ''x"'' axis by the roll angle ''φ''. The reference frame that results after the three rotations is the body frame.

Based on the rotations and axes conventions above, the yaw angle ''ψ'' is the angle between north and the projection of the aircraft longitudinal axis onto the horizontal plane, the pitch angle ''θ'' is the angle between the aircraft longitudinal axis and horizontal, and the roll angle ''φ'' represents a rotation around the aircraft longitudinal axis after rotating by yaw and pitch.

To transform from the Earth frame to the wind frame, the three Euler angles are the bank angle ''μ'', the flight path angle ''γ'', and the heading angle ''σ''. When performing the rotations described above to obtain the wind frame from the Earth frame, (''μ'',''γ'',''σ'') are analogous to (''φ'',''θ'',''ψ''), respectively. The heading angle ''σ'' is the angle between north and the horizontal component of the velocity vector, which describes which direction the aircraft is moving relative to cardinal directions. The flight path angle ''γ'' is the angle between horizontal and the velocity vector, which describes whether the aircraft is climbing or descending. The bank angle ''μ'' represents a rotation of the lift force around the velocity vector, which may indicate whether the airplane is [[Banked turn#Banked turn in aeronautics|turning]].

To transform from the wind frame to the body frame, the two Euler angles are the [[angle of attack]] ''α'' and the [[Slip (aerodynamic)|sideslip angle]] ''β''. When performing the rotations described earlier to obtain the body frame from the wind frame, (''α'',''β'') are analogous to (''θ'',''ψ''), respectively; the angle analogous to ''φ'' in this transformation is always zero. The sideslip angle ''β'' is the angle between the velocity vector and the projection of the aircraft longitudinal axis onto the ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'',''y&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''-plane, which describes whether there is a lateral component to the aircraft velocity, also known as sideslip.  The angle of attack ''α'' is the angle between the ''x&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'',''y&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''-plane and the aircraft longitudinal axis and, among other things, is an important variable in determining the magnitude of the force of lift.

===Design cases===
In analyzing the stability of an aircraft, it is usual to consider perturbations about a nominal [[steady flight]] state. So the analysis would be applied, for example, assuming:
::Straight and level flight
::Turn at constant speed
::Approach and landing
::[[Takeoff]]

The speed, height and trim angle of attack are different for each flight condition, in addition, the aircraft will be configured differently, e.g. at low speed [[Flap (aircraft)|flaps]] may be deployed and the [[Landing gear|undercarriage]] may be down.

Except for [[asymmetric designs]] (or [[symmetric designs]] at significant sideslip), the longitudinal equations of motion (involving pitch and lift forces) may be treated independently of the lateral motion (involving roll and yaw).

The following considers perturbations about a nominal straight and level flight path.

To keep the analysis (relatively) simple, the control surfaces are assumed fixed throughout the motion, this is stick-fixed stability. Stick-free analysis requires the further complication of taking the motion of the control surfaces into account.

Furthermore, the flight is assumed to take place in still air, and the aircraft is treated as a [[rigid body]].

== Forces of flight ==

Three forces act on an aircraft in flight: [[weight]], [[thrust]], and the [[aerodynamic force]].

=== Aerodynamic force ===

{{main|Aerodynamic force}}

==== Components of the aerodynamic force ====

The expression to calculate the aerodynamic force is:

::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_A = \int_\Sigma (-\Delta p \mathbf{n} + \mathbf{f}) \,d\sigma  &lt;/math&gt;

where:
::&lt;math&gt; \Delta p \equiv &lt;/math&gt; Difference between static pressure and free current pressure
::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{n} \equiv &lt;/math&gt; outer normal vector of the element of area
::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{f} \equiv &lt;/math&gt; tangential stress vector practised by the air on the body
::&lt;math&gt; \Sigma \equiv &lt;/math&gt; adequate reference surface

projected on wind axes we obtain:

::&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_A = -(\mathbf{i}_w D + \mathbf{j}_w Q + \mathbf{k}_w L) &lt;/math&gt;

where:
::&lt;math&gt; D \equiv &lt;/math&gt; Drag
::&lt;math&gt; Q \equiv &lt;/math&gt; Lateral force
::&lt;math&gt; L \equiv &lt;/math&gt; Lift

==== Aerodynamic coefficients ====

[[Dynamic pressure]] of the free current &lt;math&gt; \equiv q = \tfrac12\, \rho\, V^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Proper reference [[flight control surface|surface]] ([[wing]] surface, in case of [[airplane|plane]]s) &lt;math&gt; \equiv S &lt;/math&gt;

[[Pressure coefficient]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv C_p = \dfrac{p-p_\infty}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Friction coefficient]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv C_f = \dfrac{f}{q}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Drag coefficient]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv C_d = \dfrac{D}{qS} = - \dfrac{1}{S} \int_\Sigma [ (-C_p) \mathbf{n} \bullet \mathbf{i_w} + C_f \mathbf{t} \bullet \mathbf{i_w}] \,d\sigma &lt;/math&gt;

Lateral force coefficient &lt;math&gt; \equiv C_Q = \dfrac{Q}{qS} = - \dfrac{1}{S} \int_\Sigma [ (-C_p) \mathbf{n} \bullet \mathbf{j_w} + C_f \mathbf{t} \bullet \mathbf{j_w}] \,d\sigma &lt;/math&gt;

[[Lift coefficient]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv C_L = \dfrac{L}{qS} = - \dfrac{1}{S} \int_\Sigma [ (-C_p) \mathbf{n} \bullet \mathbf{k_w} + C_f \mathbf{t} \bullet \mathbf{k_w}] \,d\sigma &lt;/math&gt;

It is necessary to know C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; in every point on the considered surface.

==== Dimensionless parameters and aerodynamic regimes ====

In absence of thermal effects, there are three remarkable dimensionless numbers:

* Compressibility of the flow:
:[[Mach number]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv M = \dfrac{V}{a}&lt;/math&gt;
* Viscosity of the flow:
:[[Reynolds number]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv Re = \dfrac{\rho V l}{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;
* Rarefaction of the flow:
:[[Knudsen number]] &lt;math&gt; \equiv Kn = \dfrac{\lambda}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

::&lt;math&gt; a = \sqrt{k R \theta} \equiv &lt;/math&gt; speed of [[sound]]
:::&lt;math&gt; R\equiv &lt;/math&gt; [[gas constant]] by mass unity
:::&lt;math&gt; \theta \equiv &lt;/math&gt; absolute [[temperature]]
::&lt;math&gt; \lambda = \dfrac{\mu}{\rho} \sqrt{\dfrac{\pi}{2 R \theta}} = \dfrac{M}{Re} \sqrt{\dfrac{k \pi}{2}} \equiv &lt;/math&gt; [[mean free path]]

According to λ there are three possible rarefaction grades and their corresponding motions are called:
* Continuum current (negligible rarefaction): &lt;math&gt; \dfrac{M}{Re} \ll 1&lt;/math&gt;
* Transition current (moderate rarefaction): &lt;math&gt; \dfrac{M}{Re} \approx 1&lt;/math&gt;
* Free molecular current (high rarefaction): &lt;math&gt; \dfrac{M}{Re} \gg 1&lt;/math&gt;

The motion of a body through a flow is considered, in flight dynamics, as continuum current. In the outer layer of the space that surrounds the body [[viscosity]] will be negligible. However viscosity effects will have to be considered when analysing the flow in the nearness of the [[boundary layer]].

Depending on the compressibility of the flow, different kinds of currents can be considered:
* [[Incompressible flow|Incompressible subsonic current]]: &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; M &lt;  0.3 &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Compressible flow|Compressible subsonic current]]: &lt;math&gt; 0.3 &lt; M &lt;  0.8 &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Transonic|Transonic current]]: &lt;math&gt; 0.8 &lt; M &lt;  1.2 &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Supersonic|Supersonic current]]: &lt;math&gt; 1.2 &lt; M &lt;  5 &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Hypersonic|Hypersonic current]]: &lt;math&gt; 5 &lt; M &lt;/math&gt;

==== Drag coefficient equation and aerodynamic efficiency ====

If the geometry of the body is fixed and in case of symmetric flight (β=0 and Q=0), pressure and friction coefficients are functions depending on:
::&lt;math&gt; C_p = C_p ( \alpha , M , Re , P) &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; C_f = C_f ( \alpha , M , Re , P) &lt;/math&gt;
where:
::&lt;math&gt; \alpha \equiv  &lt;/math&gt; [[angle of attack]]
::&lt;math&gt; P \equiv  &lt;/math&gt; considered point of the surface

Under these conditions, [[Drag coefficient|drag]] and [[lift coefficient]] are functions depending exclusively on the [[angle of attack]] of the body and [[Mach number|Mach]] and [[Reynolds number]]s. Aerodynamic efficiency, defined as the relation between lift and drag coefficients, will depend on those parameters as well.

::&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
C_D = C_D ( \alpha , M , Re) \\
C_L = C_L ( \alpha , M , Re) \\
E = E ( \alpha , M , Re) = \dfrac{C_L}{C_D} \\
\end{cases}
 &lt;/math&gt;

It is also possible to get the dependency of the [[drag coefficient]] respect to the [[lift coefficient]]. This relation is known as the drag coefficient equation:
::&lt;math&gt; C_D = C_D ( C_L , M , Re ) \equiv &lt;/math&gt; drag coefficient equation
The aerodynamic efficiency has a maximum value, E&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, respect to C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; where the tangent line from the coordinate origin touches the drag coefficient equation plot.

The drag coefficient, C&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, can be decomposed in two ways. First typical decomposition separates pressure and friction effects:
::&lt;math&gt; C_D = C_{Df} + C_{Dp} \begin{cases} C_{Df} = \dfrac{D}{qS} = - \dfrac{1}{S} \int_\Sigma C_f \mathbf{t} \bullet \mathbf{i_w} \,d\sigma \\ C_{Dp} = \dfrac{D}{qS} = - \dfrac{1}{S} \int_\Sigma (-C_p) \mathbf{n} \bullet \mathbf{i_w} \,d\sigma \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

There's a second typical decomposition taking into account the definition of the drag coefficient equation. This decomposition separates the effect of the [[lift coefficient]] in the equation, obtaining two terms C&lt;sub&gt;D0&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;Di&lt;/sub&gt;. C&lt;sub&gt;D0&lt;/sub&gt; is known as the parasitic drag coefficient and it is the base draft coefficient at zero lift. C&lt;sub&gt;Di&lt;/sub&gt; is known as the induced drag coefficient and it is produced by the body lift.
::&lt;math&gt; C_D = C_{D0} + C_{Di} \begin{cases} C_{D0} = (C_D)_{C_L = 0} \\ C_{Di} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

==== Parabolic and generic drag coefficient ====

A good attempt for the induced drag coefficient is to assume a parabolic dependency of the lift

:&lt;math&gt; C_{Di} = k C_L^2 \Rightarrow C_D = C_{D0} + k C_L^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Aerodynamic efficiency is now calculated as:

:&lt;math&gt; E = \dfrac{C_L}{C_{D0} + k C_L^2} \Rightarrow \begin{cases} E_{max} = \dfrac{1}{2 \sqrt{k C_{D0}}} \\ (C_L)_{Emax} = \sqrt{ \dfrac{C_{D0}}{k} } \\ (C_{Di})_{Emax} = C_{D0} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

If the configuration of the plane is symmetrical respect to the XY plane, minimum drag coefficient equals to the parasitic drag of the plane.

:&lt;math&gt; C_{Dmin} = (C_D)_{CL=0} = C_{D0} &lt;/math&gt;

In case the configuration is asymmetrical respect to the XY plane, however, minimum flag differs from the parasitic drag. On these cases, a new approximate parabolic drag equation can be traced leaving the minimum drag value at zero lift value.

:&lt;math&gt; C_{Dmin} = C_{DM} \neq (C_D)_{CL=0} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; C_D = C_{DM} + k (C_L - C_{LM})^2 &lt;/math&gt;

==== Variation of parameters with the Mach number ====
The [[Coefficient of pressure]] varies with [[Mach number]] by the relation given below:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=John D.|title=Introduction to flight|year=2005|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=9780071238182|edition=5. ed., internat.|pages=274–275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;C_{p} = \frac {C_{p0}} {\sqrt {|1-{M_{\infty}}^2|}}&lt;/math&gt;
where
*  C&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; is the compressible [[pressure coefficient]]
*  C&lt;sub&gt;p0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[incompressible]] [[pressure coefficient]]
*  ''M&lt;sub&gt;∞&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the freestream Mach number.
This relation is reasonably accurate for 0.3 &lt; M &lt; 0.7 and when ''M = 1'' it becomes ∞ which is impossible physical situation and is called [[Prandtl–Glauert singularity]].

== Static stability and control ==

===Longitudinal static stability===
see [[Longitudinal static stability]]

===Directional stability===
{{main|Directional stability}}
Directional or weathercock stability is concerned with the [[static margin|static stability]] of the airplane about the z axis. Just as in the case of longitudinal stability it is desirable that the aircraft should tend to return to an equilibrium condition when subjected to some form of yawing disturbance. For this the slope of the yawing moment curve must be positive.
An airplane possessing this mode of stability will always point towards the relative wind, hence the name weathercock stability.

== Dynamic stability and control ==
{{see also|Relaxed stability}}

===Longitudinal modes===
It is common practice to derive a fourth order [[characteristic polynomial|characteristic equation]] to describe the longitudinal motion, and then factorize it approximately into a high frequency mode and a low frequency mode. The approach adopted here is using qualitative knowledge of aircraft behavior to simplify the equations from the outset, reaching the result by a more accessible route.

The two longitudinal motions (modes) are called the [[short period]] pitch oscillation (SPPO), and the [[phugoid]].

====Short-period pitch oscillation====

A short input (in [[control systems]] terminology an [[impulse (physics)|impulse]]) in pitch (generally via the elevator in a standard configuration fixed-wing aircraft) will generally lead to overshoots about the trimmed condition. The transition is characterized by a damped [[simple harmonic motion]] about the new trim. There is very little change in the trajectory over the time it takes for the oscillation to damp out.

Generally this oscillation is high frequency (hence short period) and is damped over a period of a few seconds. A real-world example would involve a pilot selecting a new climb attitude, for example 5° nose up from the original attitude. A short, sharp pull back on the control column may be used, and will generally lead to oscillations about the new trim condition. If the oscillations are poorly damped the aircraft will take a long period of time to settle at the new condition, potentially leading to [[Pilot-induced oscillation]]. If the short period mode is unstable it will generally be impossible for the pilot to safely control the aircraft for any period of time.

This [[Damping|damped]] [[Simple harmonic motion|harmonic motion]] is called the [[short period]] pitch oscillation, it arises from the tendency of a stable aircraft to point in the general direction of flight. It is very similar in nature to the [[weathercock]] mode of missile or rocket configurations. The motion involves mainly the pitch attitude &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; (theta) and incidence &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (alpha). The direction of the velocity vector, relative to inertial axes is &lt;math&gt;\theta-\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. The velocity vector is:
[[File:Longitudinal.svg]]

::&lt;math&gt;u_f=U\cos(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;w_f=U\sin(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_f&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;math&gt; w_f&lt;/math&gt; are the inertial axes components of velocity. According to [[Newton's Second Law]], the [[acceleration]]s are proportional to the [[force]]s, so the forces in inertial axes are:

::&lt;math&gt;X_f=m\frac{du_f}{dt}=m\frac{dU}{dt}\cos(\theta-\alpha)-mU\frac{d(\theta-\alpha)}{dt}\sin(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Z_f=m\frac{dw_f}{dt}=m\frac{dU}{dt}\sin(\theta-\alpha)+mU\frac{d(\theta-\alpha)}{dt}\cos(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the [[mass]].
By the nature of the motion, the speed variation &lt;math&gt;m\frac{dU}{dt}&lt;/math&gt; is negligible over the period of the oscillation, so:

::&lt;math&gt;X_f= -mU\frac{d(\theta-\alpha)}{dt}\sin(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;Z_f=mU\frac{d(\theta-\alpha)}{dt}\cos(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

But the forces are generated by the [[pressure]] distribution on the body, and are referred to the velocity vector. But the velocity (wind) axes set is not an [[inertial]] frame so we must resolve the fixed axes forces into wind axes.  Also, we are only concerned with the force along the z-axis:

::&lt;math&gt;Z=-Z_f\cos(\theta-\alpha)+X_f\sin(\theta-\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
Or:
::&lt;math&gt;Z=-mU\frac{d(\theta-\alpha)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

In words, the wind axes force is equal to the [[centripetal]] acceleration.

The moment equation is the time derivative of the [[angular momentum]]:
::&lt;math&gt;M=B\frac{d^2 \theta}{dt^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where M is the pitching moment, and B is the [[moment of inertia]] about the pitch axis.
Let: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d\theta}{dt}=q&lt;/math&gt;, the pitch rate.
The equations of motion, with all forces and moments referred to wind axes are, therefore:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\alpha}{dt}=q+\frac{Z}{mU}&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq}{dt}=\frac{M}{B}&lt;/math&gt;
We are only concerned with perturbations in forces and moments, due to perturbations in the states &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and q, and their time derivatives.  These are characterized by [[stability derivatives]] determined from the flight condition.  The possible stability derivatives are:

::&lt;math&gt;Z_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; Lift due to incidence, this is negative because the z-axis is downwards whilst positive incidence causes an upwards force.

::&lt;math&gt;Z_q&lt;/math&gt; Lift due to pitch rate, arises from the increase in tail incidence, hence is also negative, but small compared with &lt;math&gt;Z_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;M_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; [[Pitching moment]] due to incidence - the static stability term.  [[Longitudinal static stability|Static stability]] requires this to be negative.

::&lt;math&gt;M_q&lt;/math&gt;  Pitching moment due to pitch rate - the pitch damping term, this is always negative.

Since the tail is operating in the flowfield of the wing, changes in the wing incidence cause changes in the downwash, but there is a delay for the change in wing flowfield to affect the tail lift, this is represented as a moment proportional to the rate of change of incidence:

::&lt;math&gt;M_\dot\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

The delayed downwash effect gives the tail more lift and produces a nose down moment, so &lt;math&gt;M_\dot\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is expected to be negative.

The equations of motion, with small perturbation forces and moments become:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\alpha}{dt}=\left(1+\frac{Z_q}{mU}\right)q+\frac{Z_\alpha}{mU}\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dq}{dt}=\frac{M_q}{B}q+\frac{M_\alpha}{B}\alpha+\frac{M_\dot\alpha}{B}\dot\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

These may be manipulated to yield as second order linear [[differential equation]] in &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2\alpha}{dt^2}-\left(\frac{Z_\alpha}{mU}+\frac{M_q}{B}+(1+\frac{Z_q}{mU})\frac{M_\dot\alpha}{B}\right)\frac{d\alpha}{dt}+\left(\frac{Z_\alpha}{mU}\frac{M_q}{B}-\frac{M_\alpha}{B}(1+\frac{Z_q}{mU})\right)\alpha=0 &lt;/math&gt;

This represents a [[Damping|damped]] [[simple harmonic motion]].

We should expect &lt;math&gt;\frac{Z_q}{mU}&lt;/math&gt; to be small compared with unity, so the coefficient of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; (the 'stiffness' term) will be positive, provided &lt;math&gt;M_\alpha&lt;\frac{Z_\alpha}{mU}M_q&lt;/math&gt;. This expression is dominated by &lt;math&gt;M_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, which defines the [[longitudinal static stability]] of the aircraft, it must be negative for stability.  The damping term is reduced by the downwash effect, and it is difficult to design an aircraft with both rapid natural response and heavy damping. Usually, the response is underdamped but stable.

====Phugoid====
{{main|Phugoid}}

If the stick is held fixed, the aircraft will not maintain straight and level flight, but will start to dive, level out and climb again. It will repeat this cycle until the pilot intervenes. This long period oscillation in speed and height is called the [[phugoid]] mode. This is analyzed by assuming that the [[short period|SSPO]] performs its proper function and maintains the angle of attack near its nominal value. The two states which are mainly affected are the climb angle &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; (gamma) and speed. The small perturbation equations of motion are:

::&lt;math&gt;mU\frac{d\gamma}{dt}=-Z&lt;/math&gt;

which means the centripetal force is equal to the perturbation in lift force.

For the speed, resolving along the trajectory:

::&lt;math&gt;m\frac{du}{dt}=X-mg\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

where g is the [[standard gravity|acceleration due to gravity at the earths surface]]. The acceleration along the trajectory is equal to the net x-wise force minus the component of weight. We should not expect significant aerodynamic derivatives to depend on the climb angle, so only &lt;math&gt;X_u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z_u&lt;/math&gt; need be considered. &lt;math&gt;X_u&lt;/math&gt; is the drag increment with increased speed, it is negative, likewise &lt;math&gt;Z_u&lt;/math&gt; is the lift increment due to speed increment, it is also negative because lift acts in the opposite sense to the z-axis.

The equations of motion become:
::&lt;math&gt; mU\frac{d\gamma}{dt}=-Z_u u&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; m\frac{du}{dt}=X_u u -mg\gamma&lt;/math&gt;

These may be expressed as a second order equation in climb angle or speed perturbation:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2u}{dt^2}-\frac{X_u}{m}\frac{du}{dt}-\frac{Z_ug}{mU}u=0&lt;/math&gt;
Now lift is very nearly equal to weight:
::&lt;math&gt;Z=\frac{1}{2}\rho U^2 c_L S_w=W&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the air density, &lt;math&gt;S_w&lt;/math&gt; is the wing area, W the weight and &lt;math&gt;c_L&lt;/math&gt; is the lift coefficient (assumed constant because the incidence is constant), we have, approximately:

::&lt;math&gt;Z_u=\frac{2W}{U}=\frac{2mg}{U}&lt;/math&gt;

The period of the phugoid, T, is obtained from the coefficient of u:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\pi}{T}=\sqrt{\frac{2g^2}{U^2}}&lt;/math&gt;
Or:
::&lt;math&gt;T=\frac{2\pi U}{\sqrt{2}g}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the lift is very much greater than the drag, the phugoid is at best lightly damped. A [[Propeller (aircraft)|propeller]] with fixed speed would help. Heavy damping of the pitch rotation or a large [[rotational inertia]] increase the coupling between short period and phugoid modes, so that these will modify the phugoid.

===Lateral modes===
With a symmetrical rocket or missile, the [[directional stability]] in yaw is the same as the pitch stability; it resembles the short period pitch oscillation, with yaw plane equivalents to the pitch plane stability derivatives.  For this reason, pitch and yaw directional stability are collectively known as the "weathercock" stability of the missile.

Aircraft lack the symmetry between pitch and yaw, so that directional stability in yaw is derived from a different set of stability derivatives. The yaw plane equivalent to the short period pitch oscillation, which describes yaw plane directional stability is called Dutch roll. Unlike pitch plane motions, the lateral modes involve both roll and yaw motion.

====Dutch roll====
{{main|Dutch roll}}
It is customary to derive the equations of motion by formal manipulation in what, to the engineer, amounts to a piece of mathematical sleight of hand. The current approach follows the pitch plane analysis in formulating the equations in terms of concepts which are reasonably familiar.

Applying an impulse via the rudder pedals should induce [[Dutch roll]], which is the oscillation in roll and yaw, with the roll motion lagging yaw by a quarter cycle, so that the wing tips follow elliptical paths with respect to the aircraft.

The yaw plane translational equation, as in the pitch plane, equates the centripetal acceleration to the side force.

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\beta}{dt}=\frac{Y}{mU}-r&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; (beta) is the [[sideslip angle]], Y the side force and r the yaw rate.

The moment equations are a bit trickier. The trim condition is with the aircraft at an angle of attack with respect to the airflow. The body x-axis does not align with the velocity vector, which is the reference direction for wind axes. In other words, wind axes are not [[Aircraft principal axes|principal axes]] (the mass is not distributed symmetrically about the yaw and roll axes). Consider the motion of an element of mass in position -z, x in the direction of the y-axis, i.e. into the plane of the paper.
[[File:Product of inertia.png|thumb]]

If the roll rate is p, the velocity of the particle is:

:::&lt;math&gt;v=-pz+xr&lt;/math&gt;

Made up of two terms, the force on this particle is first the proportional to rate of v change, the second is due to the change in direction of this component of velocity as the body moves. The latter terms gives rise to cross products of small quantities (pq, pr,qr), which are later discarded.  In this analysis, they are discarded from the outset for the sake of clarity. In effect, we assume that the direction of the velocity of the particle due to the simultaneous roll and yaw rates does not change significantly throughout the motion.  With this simplifying assumption, the acceleration of the particle becomes:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{dv}{dt}=-\frac{dp}{dt}z+\frac{dr}{dt}x&lt;/math&gt;

The yawing moment is given by:

:::&lt;math&gt;\delta m x \frac{dv}{dt}=-\frac{dp}{dt}xz\delta m + \frac{dr}{dt}x^2\delta m &lt;/math&gt;

There is an additional yawing moment due to the offset of the particle in the y direction:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dr}{dt}y^2\delta m&lt;/math&gt;

The yawing moment is found by summing over all particles of the body:

:::&lt;math&gt;N=-\frac{dp}{dt}\int xz dm +\frac{dr}{dt}\int x^2 + y^2 dm =-E\frac{dp}{dt}+C\frac{dr}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

where N is the yawing moment, E is a product of inertia, and C is the moment of inertia about the [[yaw axis]].
A similar reasoning yields the roll equation:

:::&lt;math&gt;L=A\frac{dp}{dt}-E\frac{dr}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

where L is the rolling moment and A the roll moment of inertia.

==== Lateral and longitudinal stability derivatives ====
The states are &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; (sideslip), r (yaw rate) and p (roll rate), with moments N (yaw) and L (roll), and force Y (sideways).  There are nine stability derivatives relevant to this motion, the following explains how they originate. However a better intuitive understanding is to be gained by simply playing with a model airplane, and considering how the forces on each component are affected by changes in sideslip and angular velocity:
[[File:LowWing.png]]

:::&lt;math&gt;Y_\beta&lt;/math&gt; Side force due to side slip (in absence of yaw).

Sideslip generates a sideforce from the fin and the fuselage.  In addition, if the wing has dihedral, side slip at a positive roll angle increases incidence on the starboard wing and reduces it on the port side, resulting in a net force component directly opposite to the sideslip direction.  Sweep back of the wings has the same effect on incidence, but since the wings are not inclined in the vertical plane, backsweep alone does not affect &lt;math&gt;Y_\beta&lt;/math&gt;.  However, anhedral may be used with high backsweep angles in high performance aircraft to offset the wing incidence effects of sideslip. Oddly enough this does not reverse the sign of the wing configuration's contribution to &lt;math&gt;Y_\beta&lt;/math&gt; (compared to the dihedral case).

:::&lt;math&gt;Y_p&lt;/math&gt; Side force due to roll rate.

Roll rate causes incidence at the fin, which generates a corresponding side force.  Also, positive roll (starboard wing down) increases the lift on the starboard wing and reduces it on the port. If the wing has dihedral, this will result in a side force momentarily opposing the resultant sideslip tendency. Anhedral wing and or stabilizer configurations can cause the sign of the side force to invert if the fin effect is swamped.

:::&lt;math&gt;Y_r&lt;/math&gt; Side force due to yaw rate.

Yawing generates side forces due to incidence at the rudder, fin and fuselage.

:::&lt;math&gt;N_\beta&lt;/math&gt; Yawing moment due to sideslip forces.

Sideslip in the absence of rudder input causes incidence on the fuselage and [[empennage]], thus creating a yawing moment counteracted only by the directional stiffness which would tend to point the aircraft's nose back into the wind in horizontal flight conditions. Under sideslip conditions at a given roll angle &lt;math&gt;N_\beta&lt;/math&gt; will tend to point the nose into the sideslip direction even without rudder input, causing a downward spiraling flight.

:::&lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt; Yawing moment due to roll rate.

Roll rate generates fin lift causing a yawing moment and also differentially alters the lift on the wings, thus affecting the induced drag contribution of each wing, causing a (small) yawing moment contribution.  Positive roll generally causes positive &lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt; values unless the [[empennage]] is anhedral or fin is below the roll axis. Lateral force components resulting from dihedral or anhedral wing lift differences has little effect on &lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt; because the wing axis is normally closely aligned with the center of gravity.

:::&lt;math&gt;N_r&lt;/math&gt; Yawing moment due to yaw rate.

Yaw rate input at any roll angle generates rudder, fin and fuselage force vectors which dominate the resultant yawing moment. Yawing also increases the speed of the outboard wing whilst slowing down the inboard wing, with corresponding changes in drag causing a (small) opposing yaw moment. &lt;math&gt;N_r&lt;/math&gt; opposes the inherent directional stiffness which tends to point the aircraft's nose back into the wind and always matches the sign of the yaw rate input.

:::&lt;math&gt;L_\beta&lt;/math&gt; Rolling moment due to sideslip.

A positive sideslip angle generates empennage incidence which can cause positive or negative roll moment depending on its configuration.  For any non-zero sideslip angle dihedral wings causes a rolling moment which tends to return the aircraft to the horizontal, as does back swept wings.  With highly swept wings the resultant rolling moment may be excessive for all stability requirements and anhedral could be used to offset the effect of wing sweep induced rolling moment.
[[File:Planform.png]]

:::&lt;math&gt;L_r&lt;/math&gt; Rolling moment due to yaw rate.

Yaw increases the speed of the outboard wing whilst reducing speed of the inboard one, causing a rolling moment to the inboard side.  The contribution of the fin normally supports this inward rolling effect unless offset by anhedral stabilizer above the roll axis (or dihedral below the roll axis).

:::&lt;math&gt;L_p&lt;/math&gt; Rolling moment due to roll rate.

Roll creates counter rotational forces on both starboard and port wings whilst also generating such forces at the empennage. These opposing rolling moment effects have to be overcome by the aileron input in order to sustain the roll rate. If the roll is stopped at a non-zero roll angle the &lt;math&gt;L_\beta&lt;/math&gt; ''upward'' rolling moment induced by the ensuing sideslip should return the aircraft to the horizontal unless exceeded in turn by the ''downward'' &lt;math&gt;L_r&lt;/math&gt; rolling moment resulting from sideslip induced yaw rate. Longitudinal stability could be ensured or improved by minimizing the latter effect.

====Equations of motion====
Since [[Dutch roll]] is a handling mode, analogous to the short period pitch oscillation, any effect it might have on the trajectory may be ignored.  The body rate ''r'' is made up of the rate of change of sideslip angle and the rate of turn. Taking the latter as zero, assuming no effect on the trajectory, for the limited purpose of studying the Dutch roll:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\beta}{dt}= -r&lt;/math&gt;

The yaw and roll equations, with the stability derivatives become:

::&lt;math&gt;C\frac{dr}{dt}-E\frac{dp}{dt}=N_\beta \beta - N_r \frac{d\beta}{dt} + N_p p&lt;/math&gt; (yaw)

::&lt;math&gt;A\frac{dp}{dt}-E\frac{dr}{dt}=L_\beta \beta - L_r \frac{d\beta}{dt} + L_p p&lt;/math&gt; (roll)

The inertial moment due to the roll acceleration is considered small compared with the aerodynamic terms, so the equations become:

::&lt;math&gt;-C\frac{d^2\beta}{dt^2} = N_\beta \beta - N_r \frac{d\beta}{dt} + N_p p&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;E\frac{d^2\beta}{dt^2} = L_\beta \beta - L_r \frac{d\beta}{dt} + L_p p&lt;/math&gt;

This becomes a second order equation governing either roll rate or sideslip:

::&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{N_p}{C}\frac{E}{A}-\frac{L_p}{A}\right)\frac{d^2\beta}{dt^2}+
\left(\frac{L_p}{A}\frac{N_r}{C}-\frac{N_p}{C}\frac{L_r}{A}\right)\frac{d\beta}{dt}-
\left(\frac{L_p}{A}\frac{N_\beta}{C}-\frac{L_\beta}{A}\frac{N_p}{C}\right)\beta = 0&lt;/math&gt;

The equation for roll rate is identical. But the roll angle, ''&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;'' (phi) is given by:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi}{dt}=p&lt;/math&gt;

If ''p'' is a damped simple harmonic motion, so is ''&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;'', but the roll must be in [[Quadrature phase|quadrature]] with the roll rate, and hence also with the sideslip.  The motion consists of oscillations in roll and yaw, with the roll motion lagging 90 degrees behind the yaw.  The wing tips trace out elliptical paths.

Stability requires the "[[stiffness]]" and "damping" terms to be positive. These are:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{L_p}{A}\frac{N_r}{C}-\frac{N_p}{C}\frac{L_r}{A}}
{\frac{N_p}{C}\frac{E}{A}-\frac{L_p}{A}}&lt;/math&gt; (damping)

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{\frac{L_\beta}{A}\frac{N_p}{C}-\frac{L_p}{A}\frac{N_\beta}{C}}
{\frac{N_p}{C}\frac{E}{A}-\frac{L_p}{A}}&lt;/math&gt;  (stiffness)

The denominator is dominated by &lt;math&gt;L_p&lt;/math&gt;, the roll damping derivative, which is always negative, so the denominators of these two expressions will be positive.

Considering the "stiffness" term: &lt;math&gt;-L_p N_\beta&lt;/math&gt; will be positive because &lt;math&gt;L_p&lt;/math&gt; is always negative and &lt;math&gt;N_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is positive by design.  &lt;math&gt;L_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is usually negative, whilst &lt;math&gt;N_p&lt;/math&gt; is positive.  Excessive dihedral can destabilize the Dutch roll, so configurations with highly swept wings require anhedral to offset the wing sweep contribution to &lt;math&gt;L_\beta&lt;/math&gt;.

The damping term is dominated by the product of the roll damping and the yaw damping derivatives, these are both negative, so their product is positive.  The Dutch roll should therefore be damped.

The motion is accompanied by slight lateral motion of the center of gravity and a more "exact" analysis will introduce terms in &lt;math&gt;Y_\beta&lt;/math&gt; etc. In view of the accuracy with which stability derivatives can be calculated, this is an unnecessary pedantry, which serves to obscure the relationship between aircraft geometry and handling, which is the fundamental objective of this article.

====Roll subsidence====
Jerking the stick sideways and returning it to center causes a net change in roll orientation.

The roll motion is characterized by an absence of natural stability, there are no stability derivatives which generate moments in response to the inertial roll angle. A roll disturbance induces a roll rate which is only canceled by pilot or [[autopilot]] intervention. This takes place with insignificant changes in sideslip or yaw rate, so the equation of motion reduces to:

::&lt;math&gt;A\frac{dp}{dt}=L_p p.&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;L_p&lt;/math&gt; is negative, so the roll rate will decay with time. The roll rate reduces to zero, but there is no direct control over the roll angle.

====Spiral mode====
Simply holding the stick still, when starting with the wings near level, an aircraft will usually have a tendency to gradually veer off to one side of the straight flightpath.  This is the (slightly unstable)  '''spiral mode'''.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=====Spiral mode trajectory=====
In studying the trajectory, it is the direction of the velocity vector, rather than that of the body, which is of interest.  The direction of the velocity vector when projected on to the horizontal will be called the track, denoted ''&lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;'' ([[Mu (letter)|mu]]).  The body orientation is called the heading, denoted ''&lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;'' (psi).  The force equation of motion includes a component of weight:{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mu}{dt}=\frac{Y}{mU} + \frac{g}{U}\phi&lt;/math&gt;

where ''g'' is the gravitational acceleration, and ''U'' is the speed.

Including the stability derivatives:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\mu}{dt}=\frac{Y_\beta}{mU}\beta + \frac {Y_r}{mU}r + \frac{Y_p}{mU}p + \frac{g}{U}\phi&lt;/math&gt;

Roll rates and yaw rates are expected to be small, so the contributions of &lt;math&gt;Y_r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_p&lt;/math&gt; will be ignored.

The sideslip and roll rate vary gradually, so their time [[derivative]]s are ignored. The yaw and roll equations reduce to:

::&lt;math&gt;N_\beta \beta + N_r\frac{d\mu}{dt} + N_p p = 0&lt;/math&gt;  (yaw)

::&lt;math&gt;L_\beta \beta + L_r\frac{d\mu}{dt} + L_p p = 0&lt;/math&gt; (roll)

Solving for ''&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;'' and ''p'':

:::&lt;math&gt;\beta=\frac{(L_r N_p - L_p N_r)}{(L_p N_\beta - N_p L_\beta)}\frac{d\mu}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

:::&lt;math&gt;p=\frac{(L_\beta N_r - L_r N_\beta)}{(L_p N_\beta - N_p L_\beta)}\frac{d\mu}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for sideslip and roll rate in the force equation results in a first order equation in roll angle:

:::&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\phi}{dt}=mg\frac{(L_\beta N_r - N_\beta L_r)}{mU(L_p N_\beta - N_p L_\beta)-Y_\beta(L_r N_p - L_p N_r)}\phi&lt;/math&gt;

This is an [[Exponential growth|exponential]] growth or decay, depending on whether the coefficient of ''&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;'' is positive or negative.  The denominator is usually negative, which requires &lt;math&gt;L_\beta N_r &gt; N_\beta L_r&lt;/math&gt; (both products are positive).  This is in direct conflict with the Dutch roll stability requirement, and it is difficult to design an aircraft for which both the Dutch roll and spiral mode are inherently stable.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Since the [[spiral divergence|spiral mode]] has a long time constant, the pilot can intervene to effectively stabilize it, but an aircraft with an unstable Dutch roll would be difficult to fly.  It is usual to design the aircraft with a stable Dutch roll mode, but slightly unstable spiral mode.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35748">Since the advent of [[genetic engineering]] in the 1970s, concerns have been raised about the dangers of the technology.  Laws, regulations, and treaties were created in the years following to '''contain [[genetically modified organisms]]''' and prevent their '''escape.'''

Nevertheless, there are several examples of failure to keep GM crops separate from conventional ones.

==History of regulation==

The development of a regulatory framework concerning genetic engineering began in 1975, at [[Asilomar Conference Grounds|Asilomar]], California. The first use of [[Recombinant DNA]] (rDNA) technology had just been successfully accomplished by [[Stanley Norman Cohen|Stanley Cohen]] and [[Herbert Boyer]] two years previously and the scientific community recognized that as well as benefits this technology could also pose some risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.185.4148.303|journal=Science|year=1974|volume=185|issue=4148|page=303|title=Letter: Potential biohazards of recombinant DNA molecules|vauthors=Berg P, Baltimore D, Boyer HW, Cohen SN, Davis RW, Hogness DS, Nathans D, Roblin R, Watson JD, Weissman S, Zinder ND |url=http://beck2.med.harvard.edu/week13/The%20Science%20Letter.pdf|pmid=4600381|bibcode = 1974Sci...185..303B |pmc=388511}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Asilomar conference on recombinant DNA|Asilomar meeting]] recommended a set of guidelines regarding the cautious use of recombinant technology and any products resulting from that technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1073/pnas.72.6.1981|journal=Proc.

==Co-existence==
In the context of agriculture and food and feed production, co-existence means using cropping systems with and without [[genetically modified crops]] in parallel. In some countries, such as the US, co-existence is not governed by any single law but instead is managed by regulatory agencies and [[tort]] law.  In other regions, such as Europe, regulations require that the separation and the identity of the respective food and feed products must be maintained at all stages of the production process.

===Rationale===
Many consumers are critical of genetically modified plants and their products, while, conversely, most experts in charge of GMO approvals do not perceive concrete threats to health or the environment. The compromise chosen by some countries  - notably the European Union - has been to implement regulations specifically governing co-existence and [[traceability]]. Traceability has become commonplace in the food and feed supply chains of most countries in the world, but the traceability of GMOs is made more challenging by the addition of very strict legal thresholds for unwanted mixing.  Within the [[European Union]], since 2001, conventional and organic food and feedstuffs can contain up to 0.9% of authorised GM material without being labelled GM&lt;ref name = JRC&gt;Czarnak-Klos, Marta et al (2010) [http://ecob.jrc.ec.europa.eu/documents/Maize.pdf Best Practice documents for coexistence of Genetically Modified Crops with Conventional and Organic Crops] JRC, European Commission, Retrieved 13 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  (any trace of non-authorised GM products and would cause shipments to be rejected.&lt;ref name = JRC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/feedarticle?id=7134548 EU caught in quandary over GMO animal feed imports] The Guardian 7 December 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208074849/http://www.guardian.co.uk/feedarticle?id=7134548 |date=December 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In the US there is no legislation governing the co-existence of neighboring farms growing organic and GM crops; instead the US relies on a "complex but relaxed" combination of three federal agencies (FDA, EPA, and USDA/APHIS) and the common law [[tort]] system, governed by state law, to manage risks of co-existence.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Baram. "Governance of GM Crop and Food Safety in the United States" pp 15-56 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=PdlLGJ39_xQC&amp;l Governing Risk in GM Agriculture], eds. Michael Baram, Mathilde Bourrier.  Cambridge University Press 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|44}}  In the face of continuing concerns about the economic losses that might be suffered by organic farmers by unintended intermixing, the US Secretary of Agriculture convened an Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st Century Agriculture (AC21) to study the issue and make recommendations as to whether to address these concerns and if so, how. economic losses to farmers caused by unintended presence of genetically engineered materials, as well as how such mechanisms might work.  The members  of AC21 included representatives of the biotechnology industry, the organic food industry, farming communities, the seed industry, food manufacturers, State government, consumer and community development groups, the medical profession, and academic researchers.  The AC21 recommended that a study should be conducted to answer the question of whether and to what extent there are any economic losses to US organic farmers; recommended that if the losses are serious, that a crop insurance program for organic farmers be put in place, and that an education program should be undertaken to ensure that organic farmers are putting appropriate contracts in place for their crops and that neighboring GM crop farmers are taking appropriate containment measures. Overall the report supported a diverse agriculture system in which many different farming systems could co-exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan |last=Flynn |work=[[Food Safety News]]|date= November 12, 2012 |url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2012/11/ac21-wants-usda-to-investigate-crop-insurance-for-genetic-harm-to-organic-crops/#.UbUj1fYaePU|title=AC21 Wants USDA to Investigate Crop Insurance for Genetic Harm To Organic Crops}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;USDA Advisory Committee on Biotechnology and 21st Century Agriculture (AC21).

===Measures for ensuring co-existence===
To limit mixing in the first stages of production, researchers and politicians are developing codes of [[good agricultural practice]] for GM crops. In addition to the thorough cleaning of machinery, recommended measures include the establishment of "isolation distances" and "pollen barriers". Isolation distances are the minimum distances required between GM and non-GM cultivations for most of the GM pollen to fall to the ground before reaching non-GM plants. Pollen barriers attempt actively catch pollen, and can consist of hedges and trees which physically hinder pollen movement. Pollen barriers consisting of conventional crops of the same species as the GM crop have a special advantage, as the conventional plants not only physically limit the GM pollen flow, but also produce competitive, conventional pollen. During harvest, the buffer strip of conventional crops is considered part of the GM crop yield.

====Biological approaches to aid co-existence====
In addition to agricultural measures, there may be also biological tools to prevent the genetically modified crop from fertilising conventional fields. Researchers are investigating methods either to prevent GM crops from producing pollen at all (for example [[Male sterility|male-sterile plants]]), or to develop GM crops with pollen that nonetheless does not contain the additional, genetically engineered material. In an example of the latter, [[transplastomic plants]] can be generated in which the genetic modification has been integrated in the DNA of [[chloroplasts]] - the cell nucleus contains no transgenes and thus the pollen contains no chloroplasts and thus no transgenes. Two important research projects on co-existence are and [[Co-Extra]]. With the end of the de facto moratorium on genetically modified plants in Europe, several research programmes (e.g. [[SIGMEA]], [[Co-Extra]], and [[Transcontainer]]) have begun investigating biological containment strategies for GMOs.

Another approach, developed recently, is the generation of [[transplastomic plants]]. As the chloroplasts of plants are maternally inherited, the transgenes are not spread by pollen thus achieving biological containment.

===Research on co-existence===
While SIGMEA was focused on co-existence at the farm level, Co-Extra studies co-existence along the whole production chain, and has a second focus on the traceability of GMOs, since co-existence cannot work without traceability. To be able to monitor and enforce compliance with co-existence regulations, authorities require the ability to trace, [[Detection of genetically modified organisms|detect and identify GMOs]].

==Compensation for failure to maintain separation ==
Since GM-free products yield higher prices in many countries, some governments have introduced limits for the mixing of both production systems, with compensation for non-GM farmers for economic losses in cases where mixing inadvertently occurred.&lt;ref name=CompensationReport2007&gt;Bernhard A. Koch (ed.) [Liability and Compensation Schemes for Damage Resulting from the Presence of Genetically Modified Organisms in Non-GM Crops http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/analysis/external/liability_gmo/full_text_en.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004213820/http://ec.europa.eu/agriculture/analysis/external/liability_gmo/full_text_en.pdf |date=2013-10-04 }}] April 2007, produced under contract from the European Commission.&lt;/ref&gt;  One tool for compensation is a liability fund, to which all GM farmers, and sometimes GM seed producers, contribute.&lt;ref name=CompensationReport2007/&gt;{{rp|88–91}}

==Escapes==
Mixing can occur already at the agricultural stage. Fundamentally, two reasons exist for the presence of GMOs in the harvest of a non-GM cultivation: first, that the seed has been contaminated already or, secondly, that the plants in the non-GM field have received [[pollen]] from neighbouring GM fields.  Mixing may also occur post-harvest, anywhere in the production chain.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Riddle, University of Minnesota Outreach Service.

In 1997, [[Percy Schmeiser]] discovered that [[canola]] growing on his farm was genetically modified to be resistant to [[glyphosate|Roundup]] although he had not planted GM seed. He had initially discovered that some canola growing by a roadside along one of his fields was Roundup resistant when he was killing weeds along the road; this led him to spray a 3- to 4‑acre section of his adjacent field and 60% of the canola survived. Schmeiser harvested the seed from the surviving, Roundup resistant plants, and planted the seed in 1998. [[Monsanto]] sued Schmeiser for patent infringement for the 1998 planting. Schmeiser claimed that because the 1997 plants grew from seed that was blown into his field from neighboring fields, that he owned the harvest and was entitled to do with it whatever he wished, including saving the seeds from the 1997 harvest and planting them in 1998. The case went to the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Supreme Court]] which took the case and held for Monsanto by a 5‑4 vote in late May 2004.&lt;ref name=CanadianSC&gt;[http://scc.lexum.org/en/2004/2004scc34/2004scc34.html Canadian Supreme Court ruling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905011001/http://scc.lexum.org/en/2004/2004scc34/2004scc34.html |date=2012-09-05 }}.

The wheat had been created by [[Monsanto]], and was a strain that was field-tested from 1998 to 2005 and was in the American regulatory approval process before Monsanto withdrew it based on concern that importers would avoid the crop. The last field test in Oregon had occurred in 2001.

'''Geotargeting''' in [[geomarketing]] and [[internet marketing]] is the method of determining the [[geolocation]] of a website visitor and delivering different [[Web content|content]] to that visitor based on their location. This includes country, region/state, city, metro code/[[zip code]], organization, [[IP address]], [[ISP]] or other criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Freedman, Mythili Vutukuru, Nick Feamster and Hari Balakrishnan, Geographic Locality of IP Prefixes, Internet Measurement Conference (IMC), 2005&lt;/ref&gt; A common usage of geo targeting is found in [[online advertising]], as well as [[internet television]] with sites such as [[iPlayer]] and [[Hulu]]. In these circumstances, content is often restricted to users geolocated in specific countries; this approach serves as a means of implementing [[digital rights management]]. Use of [[proxy server]]s and [[virtual private network]]s may give a false location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/16/technology/internet/16privacy.html?ref=technology | title=Many See Privacy on Web as Big Issue, Survey Says | work=Nytimes.com | date=March 15, 2009 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=STEPHANIE CLIFFORD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographical information provided by the visitor==
In geotargeting with [[geolocation software]], the [[geolocation]] is based on geographical and other personal information that is provided by the visitor or others.

===Different content by choice===
Typical examples for different content by choice in geotargeting are the [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] websites where users have the choice to select their country location first and are then presented with different site or article content depending on their selection.

===Automated different content===
In internet marketing and geomarketing, the delivery of different content based on the geographical [[geolocation]] and other personal information is automated.&lt;ref name=automated&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703294904575385532109190198?mod=googlenews_wsj Wall Street Journal, “On the Web's Cutting Edge, Anonymity in Name Only”, August 4, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; A good example is the Ace Hardware website at www.acehardware.com. The company utilizes geolocation software to power the “My Local Ace” section of its website. Based on a site visitor’s location, the website's [[online locator service]] can show the visitor how many stores are in their area, as well as a city-level locator map to help the customer find the store closest to their address.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsicommerce.com/assets/docs/pdf/generic/CSA-AceHardware-Nov08.pdf Chain Store Age, “Making it Personal”, November, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

==IP spidering==
The automated discovery of user person/organisation/city-level geolocation information based on [[IP address]]es by [[traceroute]], [[Ping (networking utility)|ping]]s, and a combination of other tools and methods is far more advanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adexchanger.com/online-advertising/digital-element-rob-friedman-ip-targeting/|title=Digital Element Finding Demand for Granular IP targeting|accessdate=2010-04-28|date=2009-08-20}} Discussing automated spidering technology&lt;/ref&gt;

It is dependent on the pre-analysis of the entire IP address space. There are more than 4 billion possible IP addresses, and detailed analysis of each of them is a Herculean task, especially in light of the fact that IP addresses are constantly being assigned, allocated, reallocated, moved and changed due to routers being moved,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/02/22/google-says-ip-addresses-arent-personal/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;ref=technology&amp;_r=0 | title=Google Says I.P. Addresses Aren’t Personal | work=Nytimes.com | date=February 22, 2008 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=SAUL HANSELL}}&lt;/ref&gt; enterprises being assigned IP addresses or moving, and networks being built or changed. In order to keep up with these changes, complex algorithms, bandwidth measurement and mapping technology, and finely tuned delivery mechanisms are necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/03/technology/personaltech/how-to-muddy-your-tracks-on-the-internet.html | title=How to Muddy Your Tracks on the Internet | work=Nytimes.com | date=May 2, 2012 | accessdate=12 February 2014 | author=KATE MURPHY}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once all of the IP space is analyzed, each address must be periodically updated to reflect changes in the IP address information, without invading a user's privacy. This process is similar in scale to the task of [[Web crawler|Web spidering]].

==IP delivery in SEO==
{{main|Cloaking}}
IP delivery for [[search engine optimization]] (SEO) is the method of delivering different content to search engine spiders (also known as robots and crawlers) than to human visitors. The determination if the visitor is a known search engine spider is done based on the IP address. SEOs compare the visitor's IP address with their list of IP addresses, which are known to be servers that are owned by a search engine and used to run their crawler applications (spiders). The delivery of different content to search engine spiders than to human visitors is called [[cloaking]] and is against most search engines' webmaster guidelines.&lt;ref name=gguide&gt;[http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=35769 Google webmaster guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yguide&gt;[http://help.yahoo.com/help/us/ysearch/indexing/indexing-14.html Yahoo! search content quality guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=msguide&gt;[http://search.msn.com/docs/siteowner.aspx?t=SEARCH_WEBMASTER_REF_GuidelinesforOptimizingSite.htm MS Search guidelines for successful indexing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819035446/http://search.msn.com/docs/siteowner.aspx?t=SEARCH_WEBMASTER_REF_GuidelinesforOptimizingSite.htm |date=2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the search engine guidelines seem to imply that any type of cloaking is bad, there are cases where cloaking might be legitimate. The subject is very controversial and SEO experts continue to debate about when cloaking might be acceptable and when not.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Sherman (July 18, 2001), [http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2157341 Search Engine Cloaking: The Controversy Continues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113063408/http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=2157341 |date=2007-11-13 }}, ''Search Engine Watch'', retrieved on December 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

"Cloaking" via IP delivery works differently from cloaking via "[[user agent]]". While [[IP address spoofing]] is harder than [[User agent#User agent spoofing|user-agent spoofing]] and more reliable, it is also harder to keep the list of IP addresses used by search engines for their crawlers up-to-date. An outdated list with active crawler IP addresses missing enables the search engines to detect the cloaking and may result in a removal of the site from the search engine's index.

A '''grooming dance''', '''grooming invitation dance''' or '''shaking dance''' is a dance performed by [[honeybees]] to initiate [[social grooming|allogrooming]].  It was first reported in 1945 by biologist Mykola H. Hadak.&lt;ref&gt;Haydak, M. H. (1945) The language of the honeybees. ''American Bee Journal.'' Volume 85. pp. 316—317.&lt;/ref&gt;   An increase in the frequency of the grooming dance has been observed among the bees of mite-infested colonies,&lt;ref&gt;Pettis, J.S., T. Pankiw. (May–June 1998) Grooming behavior by Apis mellifera L. in the presence of Acarapis woodi (Rennie) (Acari: Tarsonemidae). ''Apidologie.'' Volume 29, Issue 3. pp. 241-253.&lt;/ref&gt; and among bees who have been dusted with small particles of chalk dust.&lt;ref&gt;Land, B. B., T. D. Seeley.

'''Hauling-out''' is a [[ethology|behaviour]] associated with [[pinniped]]s ([[true seals]], [[sea lions]], [[fur seals]] and [[walruses]]) temporarily leaving the water.&lt;ref name=":Hoelzel" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt; Hauling-out typically occurs between periods of [[foraging]] activity.&lt;ref name=":Hoelzel" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":Kovacs" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":Gales" /&gt; Rather than remain in the water, pinnipeds haul-out onto land or sea-ice for reasons such as [[reproduction]] and rest.&lt;ref name=":Gales"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt; Hauling-out is necessary in seals for mating (with the exception of the [[Baikal seal]]&lt;ref name=":Hoelzel" /&gt;) and giving birth (although a distinction is generally made between reproductive aggregations, termed "[[rookeries]]", and non-reproductive aggregations, termed "haul-outs").&lt;ref name=":Gales" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":Loughlin" /&gt; Other benefits of hauling-out may include [[predator avoidance]], [[thermoregulation]], social activity, [[parasite]] reduction and rest.&lt;ref name=":Gales" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":Loughlin" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

There is much variation in haul-out patterns among different seal [[species]].&lt;ref name=":Hoelzel"&gt;Hoelzel, A. Rus. (2002). ''Marine Mammal Biology: An Evolutionary Approach''. Blackwell Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-632-05232-5}}. p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;  Haul-out sites may be segregated by age and sex within the same species.&lt;ref name=":Kovacs"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kovacs | first1 = Kit M. | last2 = Jonas | first2 = Krista M. | last3 = Welke | first3 = Sylvia E. | year = 1990 | title = Sex and age segregation by ''Phoca vitulina concolor'' at haul-out sites during the breeding season in the Passamaquoddy Bay region, New Brunswick | url = | journal = Marine Mammal Science | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 204–214 | doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.1990.tb00244.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many species of pinniped have only a few localized rookeries where they breed, but periodically occupy hundreds of haul-out sites throughout the range.&lt;ref name=":Loughlin" /&gt;  For example, the [[Australian fur seal]]s breed on only nine islands in [[Bass Strait]] but also occupy up to 50 haul-out sites in south-east Australian waters,&lt;ref name=":Gales"&gt;Gales, Nick; Gales, Nicholas; Hindell, Mark; &amp; Kirkwood, Roger. (2003). ''Marine Mammals: Fisheries, Tourism and Management Issues''. CSIRO Publishing. {{ISBN|978-0-643-06953-4}}. p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steller sea lions]] have around 50 rookeries throughout their range, but several hundred haul-out sites.&lt;ref name=":Loughlin"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loughlin | first1 = Thomas R. | last2 = Rugh | first2 = David J. | last3 = Fiscus | first3 = Clifford H. | year = 1984 | title = Northern Sea Lion Distribution and Abundance: 1956-80 | url = | journal = The Journal of Wildlife Management | volume = 48 | issue = 3| pages = 729–740 | doi=10.2307/3801420}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hauling-out behaviour provides numerous benefits to pinnipeds besides reproduction. This behaviour has been shown to be used for activities such as thermoregulation, predator avoidance, [[moulting]], [[nursing]], and resting.&lt;ref name=":A"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=London|first1=Josh M.|last2=Ver Hoef|first2=Jay M.|last3=Jefferies|first3=Steven J.|last4=Lance|first4=Monique M.|last5=Boveng|first5=Peter L.|title=Haul-Out Behavior of Harbor Seals (Phoca vitulina) in Hood Canal, Washington|journal=PLoS ONE|date=June 18, 2012|volume=7|issue=6|page=e38180|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0038180|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3377645/pdf/pone.0038180.pdf|accessdate=24 September 2017|pmc=3377645|pmid=22723851}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haul-out frequency, duration, and site location (ie. sea-ice, floating-ice, and terrestrial) are all influenced by physical constraints (ie. air temperature, wind speed, and time of day) and biological constraints (ie. moulting, age, and sex).&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Variations in hauling-out behaviour exist among pinnipeds for reasons such as geographical location.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Examples==
=== Weddell seals ===
[[File:Weddell Seal (js)1.jpg|thumb|[[Weddell seal]] on terrestrial haul-out site.]]
Haul-out sites of [[Weddell seal]]s are not necessarily geographically distinct from one another and vary due to physical factors (ie. food availability) and biological factors (ie. age).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boeheme|first1=Lars|last2=Baker|first2=Amy|last3=Fedak|first3=Mike|last4=Ârthun|first4=Marius|last5=Nicholls|first5=Keith|last6=Robinson|first6=Patrick|last7=Costa|first7=Dan|last8=Biuw|first8=Martin|last9=Photopoulou|first9=Theoni|title=Bimodal Winter Haul-Out Patterns of Adult Weddell Seals (Leptonychotes weddellii) in the Southern Weddell Sea|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2016|volume=11|issue=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0155817|page=e0155817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weddell seals are high latitude [[Antarctic]] inhabitants, allowing them to haul-out onto ice as adults year round for foraging.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Similar to other pinnipeds, Weddell seals haul-out for reasons such as feeding, rest, avoidance of predators, and thermoregulation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lake|first1=S.E.|last2=Burton|first2=H.R.|last3=Hindell|first3=M.A.|title=Influence of time of day and month on Weddell seal haul-out patterns at the Vestfold Hills, Antarctica|journal=Polar Biology|date=1997|volume=18|pages=319–324|doi=10.1007/s003000050194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seasonal variation has been indicated to influence the haul-out patterns of this species, environmental factors such as air temperature and wind speed trigger a shift from long-duration [[diurnal cycle|diurnal]] haul-outs to short-duration [[nocturnal]] patterns.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Following moulting season the number of haul-outs performed increases allowing the seals to benefit from the increased air temperature and thus decreasing the energetic cost of growing new hair.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
The haul-out patterns of female Weddell seal are heavily influenced by the age of their pups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thomas|first1=Jeanette|last2=DeMaster|first2=Douglas|title=Diel haul-out patterns of Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli) females and their pups|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1983|volume=61|issue=9|pages=2084–2086|doi=10.1139/z83-273}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first week post [[parturition]], haul-out frequency is high and females remain hauled-out for longer periods prior to the pups starting to swim. Haul-out frequency decreases as the pups are [[wean]]ed and mating begins.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Walruses===
[[File:Noaa-walrus9.jpg|thumb|Group of [[walrus]]es on sea-ice haul-out.]]
[[Walrus]]es tend to occupy both terrestrial and sea ice haul-out sites, alternating between the two depending on resource availability.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Udevitz|first1=Mark|last2=Chadwick|first2=Jay|last3=Fischbach|first3=Anthony|last4=Garlich-Miller|first4=Joel|title=Modeling haul-out behavior of walruses in Bering Sea ice|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=2009|volume=87|issue=12|pages=1111–1128|doi=10.1139/Z09-098}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walruses haul-out onto land primarily for birthing, moulting, nursing, and resting, meanwhile using sea-ice haul-out sites for foraging and predator avoidance.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These physiological factors are correlated with both the duration and frequency of haul-outs among walruses.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Sea ice sites are more commonly used for shorter and more frequent haul-outs compared to terrestrial sites, which are commonly used to fulfill more time consuming requirements (ie. breeding and birthing).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Hauling-out is also used as a method of thermoregulation, therefore it is influence by various environmental factors such as wind speed, temperature, and even time of day.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Accounting for these environmental factors, walruses more frequently haul-out from late morning to early evening and avoid hauling-out during weather periods of intense cold or high winds.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Haul-out frequency is at a [[Maxima and minima|maximum]] for walruses during the summer using terrestrial haul-out sites as sea ice sites are then further from foraging grounds.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
As female walruses haul-out for parturition, the males are [[territorial]] of the haul-out site surrounding the female [[herd]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamilton|first1=Charmain|last2=Kovacs|first2=Kit|last3=Lydersen|first3=Christian|title=Year-round haul-out behaviour of male walruses Odobenus rosmarus in the Northern Barents Sea|journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series|date=2015|volume=519|pages=251–263|doi=10.3354/meps11089}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these instances, hauling-out provides an opportunity for more [[aggressive]] and territorial males to mate.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Charrier|first1=Isabelle|last2=Burlet|first2=Armandine|last3=Aubin|first3=Thierry|title=Social vocal communication in captive Pacific walruses Odobenus rosmarus divergens|journal=Mammalian Biology|volume=76|pages=622–627|doi=10.1016/j.mambio.2010.10.006|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ringed seal===
[[File:Pusa hispida hispida NOAA 1.jpg|thumb|[[Ringed seal]] on sea-ice haul-out.]]
[[Ringed seal]] hauling-out occurs throughout any point in the year, however it reaches a maximum during the spring.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Born|first1=E. W.|last2=Teilmann|first2=J.|last3=Riget|first3=F.|title=Haul-out activity of Ringed seals (Phoca hispida) determined form satellite telemetry|journal=Marine Mammal Science|date=2002|volume=18|issue=1|pages=167–181|doi=10.1111/j.1748-7692.2002.tb01026.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to other pinniped species, ringed seals haul-out with a shorter duration year round.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; Ringed seals have a [[diel]] haul-out pattern in which they spend more time hauled-out out during the night, an uncommon feature among [[pinniped]]s.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=T. G.|title=Population dynamics of the ringed seal in the Canadian eastern Arctic|journal=Fisheries Research Board of Canada Bulletin|volume=181|page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hauling-out spikes an increase in the herding behaviour of ringed seals, particularly in the Ladoga subspecies.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sipilä|first1=Tero|last2=Medvedev|first2=Nikolai|last3=Hyvärinen|first3=Heikki|title=The Ladoga seal (Phoca hispida ladogensis Nordq.)|journal=Hydrobiologia|date=1996|volume=322|pages=193–198|doi=10.1007/bf00031827}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Subspecies of the ringed seal prefer different haul-out sites depending on their geographical location and environmental constraints.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=Thomas|last2=Stirling|first2=Ian|title=The breeding habitat of the ringed seal (Phoca hispida). The birth lair and associated structures|journal=Canadian Journal of Zoology|date=1975|volume=53|issue=9|pages=1297–1305|doi=10.1139/z75-155}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 5 subspecies of ringed seals prefer hauling-out onto land-fast ice, however ''Phoca hispida ochotensis'' prefers drifting pack ice, meanwhile ''Phoca hispida hispida'' occupies both land-fast ice and far offshore areas of relatively stable ice.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The majority of ringed seals however use terrestrial haul-out sites to create birth layers in the snow for newborn seal pups.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===Harbour seal===
[[File:Harbor seal rocks.jpg|thumb|[[Harbour seal]]s on [[intertidal]] site]]
[[Harbour seal]]s are the most abundant pinniped in the eastern [[North Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt; Much like other pinnipeds, harbour seals haul-out for reasons such as thermoregulation, breeding, mating, moulting, resting, and foraging.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt; They commonly haul-out onto [[intertidal]] ledges, [[mudflat]]s, [[beaches]], and ice floes year round.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Terhune|first1=John|title=Meteorological influences on harbour seal haul-out|journal=Aquatic Mammals|date=1987|volume=13|issue=3|pages=114–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haul-out sites are often revisited on a regular basis by the same herd&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt; and are heavily affected by tide height.&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Harbour seals are likely to move haul-out sites in response to inclement weather conditions (ie. wind chill and wave size) to more favourable sites in rocky reefs, mudflats, and beaches that are exposed during lower tides.&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; 
Frequency and duration of the behaviour is at a maxima during early afternoon when lower tides and higher air temperatures are prevalent.&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; During parturition and weaning, females spend more time hauled-out ashore until their pups begin to swim, meanwhile males spend less time hauled-out and maintain aquatic [[territories]] instead.&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt; Moulting and predation risk also increase the time spent hauled-out.&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt; Despite the increased time ashore for females and decreased time ashore or males during birthing and weaning, biological constraints such as age and sex have not been shown to effect harbour seal haul-outs.&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt; Both male and female harbour seals of all ages are consistent with time spent hauled-out.&lt;ref name=":A" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;
Harbour seals commonly inhabit regions susceptible to human [[disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]]s (ie. industries such as the [[fishery]]), a factor that has been studied and shown to alter haul-out patterns.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Härkönen|first1=T. J.|title=Influence of feeding on haul-out patterns and sizes of sub-populations in harbour seals|journal=Netherlands Journal of Sea Research|date=1987|volume=21|issue=4|pages=331–339|doi=10.1016/0077-7579(87)90007-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human disturbances negatively influence the duration and frequency of harbour seal haul-outs, decreasing the occurrence of this behaviour as human interference increases.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

[[Multitrack recording]] of sound is the process in which sound and other electro-acoustic signals are captured on a recording medium such as [[magnetic tape]], which is divided into two or more audio tracks that run parallel with each other. Because they are carried on the same medium, the tracks stay in perfect synchronisation, while allowing multiple sound sources to be recorded asynchronously. The first system for creating [[stereophonic sound]] (using [[telephone]] technology) was demonstrated by [[Clément Ader]] in Paris in 1881. The [[pallophotophone]], invented by [[Charles A. Hoxie]] and first demonstrated in 1922, recorded optically on 35&amp;nbsp;mm film, and some versions used a format of as many as twelve tracks in parallel on each strip.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gereports.com/edison-speaks-cracking-the-pallophotophone-code/ Edison speaks! Cracking the pallophotophone code | GE Reports&lt;!-- bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The tracks were recorded one at a time in separate passes and were not intended for later [[Audio mixing|mixdown]] or stereophony; as with later half-track and quarter-track monophonic tape recording, the multiple tracks simply multiplied the maximum recording time possible, greatly reducing cost and bulk. British [[EMI]] engineer [[Alan Blumlein]] patented systems for recording stereophonic sound and [[surround sound]] on disc and film in 1933. The history of modern multitrack audio recording using magnetic tape began in 1943 with the invention of [[stereo]] tape recording, which divided the recording head into two tracks.

The next major development in multitrack recording came in the mid-1950s, when the [[Ampex]] corporation devised the concept of 8-track recording, utilizing its "Sel-Sync" (Selective Synchronous) recording system, and sold the first such machine to musician [[Les Paul]]&lt;ref name="snyder"&gt;[http://aes-media.org/historical/pdf/snyder_sel-sync.pdf ARSC Journal, Sel-sync and the "Octopus": How Came to be the First Recorder to Minimize Successive Copying in Overdubs]&lt;/ref&gt;. However, for the next 35 years, multitrack audio recording technology was largely confined to specialist radio, TV and music recording studios, primarily because multitrack tape machines were both very large and very expensive - the first Ampex 8-track recorder, installed in Les Paul's home studio in 1957, cost a princely US$10,000 - roughly three times the [[Average Indexed Monthly Earnings#Indexing yearly income|US average yearly income]] in 1957, and equivalent to around $90,000 in 2016. However, this situation changed radically in 1979 with the introduction of the TASCAM [[Portastudio]], which used the inexpensive [[compact audio cassette]] as the recording medium, making good-quality 4-track (and later 8-track) multitrack recording available to the average consumer for the first time. Ironically, by the time the Portastudio had become popular, electronics companies were already introducing digital audio recording systems, and by the 1990s, computer-based digital multitrack recording systems such as [[Pro Tools]] and [[Cubase]] were being adopted by the recording industry, and soon became standard. By the early 2000s, rapid advances in home computing and digital audio software were making digital multitrack audio recording systems available to the average consumer, and high-quality digital multitrack recording systems like [[GarageBand]] were being included as a standard feature on home computers.

==Overview==
Stereo sound recording on tape was perfected in 1943 by German audio engineers working for the [[AEG]] corporation. Around 250 stereo tape recordings were made during this period (of which only three have survived), but the technology remained a closely guarded secret within Germany until the end of World War II. After the war, American audio engineer [[John T. Mullin]] and the [[Ampex]] corporation pioneered the commercial development of tape recording in the USA, and the technology was rapidly taken up by radio and the music industry due to its superior sound fidelity and because tape - being a linear recording medium - could be easily edited, by physically cutting and splicing the tape, to remove unwanted elements and create a 'perfect' recording. 2-track tape recording was rapidly adopted for modern music in the 1950s because it enabled signals from two or more separate microphones to be recorded simultaneously, enabling stereophonic recordings to be made and edited conveniently, which in turn facilitated the rapid expansion of the consumer high-fidelity ("HiFi") market. Stereo (either true binaural two-microphone stereo or multimixed) quickly became the norm for commercial classical recordings and radio broadcasts, although many pop music and jazz  recordings continued to be issued in monophonic sound until the late 1960s.

Much of the credit for the development of multitrack recording goes to guitarist, composer and technician [[Les Paul]], who lent his name to Gibson's first solid-body electric guitar. His experiments with tapes and recorders in the early 1950s led him to order the first custom-built eight-track recorder from Ampex, and his pioneering recordings with his then wife, singer [[Mary Ford]]. But it was [[Patti Page]] who was the first vocalist to record her own voice, sound on sound, with a song called [[Confess_(song)|'Confess']], in 1947: Bill Putnam, an engineer for Mercury Records, was able to overdub Page's voice, due to his well-known use of technology. Thus, Page became the first pop artist to overdub her vocals on a song. This was months before [[Les Paul]] and [[Mary Ford]] had their first multi-voiced release. Paul was the first to make use of the technique of multitracking to record separate elements of a musical piece asynchronously — that is, separate elements could be recorded at different times. Paul's technique enabled him to listen to the tracks he had already taped and record new parts in time alongside them. In 1963, solo jazz pianist, Bill Evans, recorded [[Conversations with Myself (album)|Conversations with Myself]], an innovative solo album using the unconventional (in jazz solo recordings) technique of overdubbing over himself, in effect creating a two-piano duet of jazz improvisations.

Despite [[Ampex]] having created the first 8-track tape machines for [[Les Paul]] and [[Atlantic Records]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bmi.com/news/entry/Remembering_Ahmet_Ertegun_and_Atlantics_Early_Years |title=Remembering Ahmet Ertegun and Atlantic’s Early Years |publisher=BMI|date=2006-12-20 |accessdate=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;, multitrack recording was taken up in a more limited way in the industry via 3-track recorders. These proved extremely useful for popular music, since they enabled backing music to be recorded on two tracks (either to allow the overdubbing of separate parts, or to create a full stereo backing track) while the third track was reserved for the lead vocalist. Three-track recorders remained in widespread commercial use until the mid-1960s and many famous pop recordings — including many of [[Phil Spector]]'s so-called "Wall of Sound" productions and early [[Motown]] hits — were taped on 3-track recorders.

The next evolution was 4-track recording, which was the studio standard through the mid 1960s. Many of the most famous recordings by [[The Beatles]] and [[The Rolling Stones]] were recorded on 4-track, and the engineers at London's [[Abbey Road Studios]] became particularly adept at the technique called "reduction mixes" in the UK and "bouncing down" in the United States, in which multiple tracks were recorded onto one 4-track machine and then mixed together and transferred (bounced down) to one track of a second 4-track machine. In this way, it was possible to record literally dozens of separate tracks and combine them into finished recordings of great complexity.

By the mid-1960s, the ready availability of the most up-to-date multitrack recorders - which were by then standard equipment in the leading Los Angeles recording studios - enabled [[Brian Wilson]] of [[The Beach Boys]] to become one of the first pop producers to exploit the huge potential of multitrack recording. During the group's most innovative period of music-making, from 1964 to 1967, Wilson developed elaborate techniques for assembling the band's songs, which combined elements captured on both 4-track and 8-track recorders, as well as making extensive use of tape editing. By 1964, Wilson's increasingly complex arrangements had far outstripped the group's limited musical abilities - singer-guitarist [[Carl Wilson]] was the only group member who regularly contributed to these tracking sessions - so Wilson began routinely recording all the instrumental backing tracks for his songs using the team of top-rank professional studio musicians who came to be known as "[[The Wrecking Crew (music)|The Wrecking Crew]]". For the group's landmark ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' album in 1965, Wilson recorded all the album's elaborate backing tracks using The Wrecking Crew and other session musicians, while the Beach Boys were away touring; the session musicians typically performed these instrumental tracks as ensemble performances, which were recorded and mixed live, direct to a 4-track recorder. When the other Beach Boys returned from touring, they moved to Columbia's Hollywood studio, which was equipped with the latest 8-track technology; by this time, Wilson and his engineers had 'reduced' the pre-recorded 4-track backing tracks to a mono mix, which was then dubbed onto one track of the 8-track master tape; Wilson then recorded the vocal tracks, assigning one individual track to each of the six vocalists (including soon-to-be permanent member [[Bruce Johnston]]), leaving the eighth track available for final 'sweetening' elements, such as additional vocal or instrumental touches, and lastly, all these elements were mixed down to the mono master tape. Nearly all of the Beach Boys' 4-track and 8-track masters from this period are preserved in Capitol's archive, allowing the label to release several expansive boxed sets of this music; ''[[The Pet Sounds Sessions]]'' (1997), includes nearly all the separate backing and vocal tracks from the album, as well as new stereo mixes of all the songs, while the 9-CD ''[[The Smile Sessions]]'' (2011) features a wide cross-section of the huge amount of instrumental and vocal material (totalling around 50 hours of recordings) that was recorded for the group's never-completed 1967 ''magnum opus'', ''[[Smile (The Beach Boys album)|Smile]]''.

All of the Beatles classic mid-1960s recordings, including the albums ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'' and ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', were recorded in this way. There were limitations, however, because of the build-up of noise during the bouncing-down process, and the Abbey Road engineers are still justly famed for the ability to create dense multitrack recordings while keeping background noise to a minimum.

4-track tape also led to a related development, [[quadraphonic]] sound, in which each of the four tracks was used to simulate a complete 360-degree surround sound. A number of albums including Pink Floyd's ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon]]'' and Mike Oldfield's ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' were released both in stereo and quadrophonic format in the 1970s, but 'quad' failed to gain wide commercial acceptance. Although it is now sometimes considered a gimmick, it was the direct precursor of the [[surround sound]] technology that has become standard in many modern home theater systems.

In a [[professional audio]] setting today, such as a [[recording studio]], [[audio engineer]]s may use 64 tracks or more for their recordings, utilizing one or more tracks for each instrument played.

The combination of the ability to edit via tape splicing, and the ability to record multiple tracks, revolutionized studio recording. It became common studio recording practice to record on multiple tracks, and mix down afterward. The convenience of tape editing and multitrack recording led to the rapid adoption of [[magnetic tape]] as the primary technology for commercial musical recordings. Although 33⅓ rpm and 45 rpm vinyl records were the dominant consumer format, recordings were customarily made first on [[magnetic tape]], then transferred to disc, with [[Bing Crosby]] leading the way in the adoption of this method in the United States.

== Ampex's original 8-track recorder ==

The original Ampex 8-track recorder (not to be confused with [[8-track tape]] endless-loop cartridge players), model 5258, was an internal Ampex project.  It was based on an Ampex 1" data recorder transport with modified Ampex model 350 electronics.  It stood over {{convert|7|ft|m}} tall and weighed {{convert|250|lb|kg}}.  8 tracks were chosen because that was the number of {{convert|0.070|in|mm}} recording tracks with {{convert|0.060|in|mm}} guard tracks that would fit on a {{convert|1|in|mm}} recording tape, the widest tape available at the time.&lt;ref name="snyder" /&gt;

The first of the Ampex 8-track recorders was sold to [[Les Paul]] for $10,000 in 1957 and was installed in his home recording studio by [[David Sarser]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reevesaudio.com/studiothree.html Studio 3: A Place of Recording Studio History...]&lt;/ref&gt;  It became known as the "Octopus".

The second Ampex model 5258 8-track was sold to [[Atlantic Records]] at [[Tom Dowd|Tom Dowd's]] insistence in late 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/30/arts/tom-dowd-77-an-innovator-in-the-art-of-recording-music.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jon | last=Pareles | title=Tom Dowd, 77, an Innovator In the Art of Recording Music | date=October 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atlantic was the first record company to use a multi-track (as opposed to stereo or 3-track) recorder in their studio.

== Multi-channel recorders ==

Multi-track recording differs from [[overdubbing]] and sound on sound because it records separate signals to individual tracks.  Sound on sound which Les Paul invented adds a new performance to an existing recording by placing a second playback head in front of the erase head to play back the existing track before erasing it and re-recording a new track.

Multi-track recorders also differ from early stereo and three track recorders that were available at the time in that they can record individual tracks while preserving the other tracks.  The original multi-channel recorders could only record all tracks at once.

The earliest multitrack recorders were analog magnetic tape machines with two or three tracks. [[Elvis Presley]] was first recorded on multitrack during 1957, as [[RCA]]'s engineers were testing their new machines. [[Buddy Holly]]'s last studio session in 1958 employed three-track, resulting in his only stereo releases not to include overdubs. The new three-track system allowed the lead vocal to be recorded on a dedicated track, while the remaining two tracks could be used to record the backing tracks in full stereo.

== Other early multi-track recorders ==

[[Frank Zappa]] experimented in the early 1960s with a custom built 5-track recorder built by engineer Paul Buff in his [[Pal Recording Studio]] in [[Rancho Cucamonga, California]]. Buff later went on to work in larger Hollywood studios. However, recorders with four or more tracks were restricted mainly to major American recording studios until the mid-to-late 1960s, mainly because of import restrictions and the high cost of the technology. In England, pioneering independent producer [[Joe Meek]] produced all of his innovative early 1960s recordings using monophonic and two-track recorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cleveland|first1=Barry|title=Joe Meek's Bold Techniques|date=2013|publisher=ElevenEleven|isbn=978-0-615-73600-6|pages=121|edition=Second|url=http://www.barrycleveland.com/jm-about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Meek, [[EMI]] house producer [[George Martin]] was considered an innovator for his use of two-track as a means to making better mono records, carefully balancing vocals and instruments; [[Abbey Road Studios]] installed Telefunken four-track machines in 1959 and 1960 (replaced in 1965 by smaller, more durable Studer machines), but [[The Beatles]] would not have access to them until late 1963, and all recordings prior to their first world hit single ''[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]'' (1964) were made on two-track machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title= Recording The Beatles |last= Kehew |first= Brian |publisher= Curvebender Publishing |author2=Kevin Ryan |pages= 216 |year= 2006 |isbn= 0-9785200-0-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on popular music==

The artistic potential of the multitrack recorder came to the attention of the public in the 1960s, when artists such as [[the Beatles]] and [[the Beach Boys]] began to multitrack extensively, and from then on virtually all popular music was recorded in this manner. The technology developed very rapidly during these years. At the start of their careers, the Beatles and Beach Boys each recorded live to mono, two-track (the Beatles), or three-track (the Beach Boys); by 1965 they used multitracking to create pop music of unprecedented complexity.

The Beach Boys' acclaimed 1966 LP ''[[Pet Sounds]]'' relied on multitrack recorders for its innovative production. [[Brian Wilson]] pretaped all the instrumental backing tracks with a large ensemble, recording the performances live, direct to a four-track recorder. These four-track backing tapes were then '[[overdubbing|dubbed down]]' to one track of an eight-track tape. Six of the remaining seven tracks were then used to individually record the vocals of each member of The Beach Boys, and the eighth track was reserved for any final 'sweetening' overdubs of instruments or voices.

[[3M]] introduced the 1-inch eight-track version of their model M-23 recorder in 1966, probably the first mass-produced machine of this format.  It remained in production until 1970 and was used by many top studios worldwide including Abbey Road Studios in London.  Both [[Pete Townshend]] and [[John Lennon]] had 3M 8-track machines in their home [[project studio]]s c. 1969-1970.  Ampex began mass production of their competing 1-inch eight-track MM1000 in 1967.  One of the first 8-track machines in Los Angeles was built by [[Scully Recording Instruments]] of Bridgeport, Connecticut and installed at American Recorders in late 1967.  The [[Steppenwolf (Steppenwolf album)|debut album]] by [[Steppenwolf (band)|Steppenwolf]] was recorded there and was released in January 1968.

Because The Beatles did not gain access to eight-track recorders until 1968, their groundbreaking ''[[Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' LP (1967) was created using pairs of four-track machines; the group also used [[vari-speed]] (also called [[pitch shift]]) to achieve unique sounds, and they were the first group in the world to use an important offshoot of multitrack recording, the [[Automatic Double Tracking]] (ADT) system invented by Abbey Road staff engineer [[Ken Townsend]] in 1966.

Other artists began experimenting with multitrack's possibilities also, with [[the Music Machine]] (of "Talk Talk" fame) recording on a custom-built ten-track setup, and [[Pink Floyd]] collaborating with former Beatles [[recording engineer]] [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman "Hurricane" Smith]], who produced their first albums.

The first eight-track recorder in the UK was built by Scully and installed at London's [[Advision Studios]] in early 1968.  Among the first eight-track recordings made there were the single ''[[Dogs (The Who song)|Dogs]]'' by [[The Who]] and the album ''[[My People Were Fair and Had Sky in Their Hair... But Now They're Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows]]'' by the band [[T. Rex (band)|Tyrannosaurus Rex]].  [[Trident Studios]] obtained their first eight-track recorder soon afterward.  It was during The Beatles' recording of their ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' sessions of late 1968 that [[EMI]]'s [[Abbey Road Studios]] finally had eight-track recorders installed, until then the group went to Trident to record with eight-tracks.  The Beatles used eight-track to record portions of  the ''White Album'', the single "[[Hey Jude]]" and the later ''[[Abbey Road]]''.

Other western countries also lagged well behind the USA – in [[Australia]], the largest local recording label, [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]], did not install a four-track recorder until late 1966; the first eight-track recorders did not appear there until the late 1960s.

==Large format analog recorders==

In 1967 [[Ampex]] built its first prototype 16-track [[professional audio]] recorder at the request of Mirasound Studios in New York City.  This machine used reels of 2-inch tape on a modified tape transport system originally built  for video recording.  In 1968 it introduced the 16-track production model MM-1000, the first commercially available 16-track machine.  Machines of this size are difficult to move and costly to maintain.  Prices were very high, typically $10,000 to $30,000 U.S. dollars.

One of the first 16-track recorders was installed at CBS Studios in [[New York City]] where it was used to record the second album by ''[[Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears (Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears album)|Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears]]'' released in December 1968.  The [[Grateful Dead]] released their first 16-track recordings ''[[Aoxomoxoa]]'' in June 1969 and ''[[Live/Dead]]'' in November 1969.  TTG Studios in [[Los Angeles]] built its own 16-track machine in 1968.  This was used on [[Frank Zappa]]'s album ''[[Hot Rats]]'' released in October 1969. ''[[Volunteers (Jefferson Airplane album)|Volunteers]]'' by [[Jefferson Airplane]] was released in November 1969. The back of the Jefferson Airplane album cover includes a picture of the 16-track MM-1000.

Advision and Trident were also among the first in the U.K. to install 16-track machines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}  Trident installed its first 16-track machine in late 1969. "After The Flood", a song from the [[Van der Graaf Generator]] album ''[[The Least We Can Do Is Wave To Each Other]]'', was recorded at this studio on 16 tracks in December 1969. Production of 16-track machines boomed and the number of studios worldwide using these machines exploded during 1970 and 1971.  By the end of 1971 there were at least 21 studios in London using 16-track recorders in conjunction with [[Dolby]] noise reduction.&lt;ref&gt;"Spotlight on London" Billboard Magazine, November 13, 1971 - advertisement, pg. L-26&lt;/ref&gt; Groups using Trident at this time also included [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] and [[David Bowie]] as well as [[Queen (band)|Queen]] who experimented with multitracking extensively most prominently on their albums [[Queen II]] and ''[[A Night at the Opera (Queen album)|A Night at the Opera]]''.

Australia's first sixteen-track recorder was installed at [[Armstrong's Studios]] in [[Melbourne]] in 1971; Festival installed Australia's first 24-track recorder at its Sydney studio in 1974.  During the 1970s, sixteen, twenty-four, and thirty-two tracks became common in professional studios, with recording tape reaching two and three inches (5.08&amp;nbsp;cm - 7.62&amp;nbsp;cm) wide.  The so-called "golden age" of large format professional analog recorders would last into the 1990s when the technology was mostly replaced with digital tape machines, and later on, computer systems using [[hard disk drive]]s instead of tape.  Some music producers and musicians still prefer working with the sound of vintage analog recording equipment despite the additional costs and difficulties involved.

Large format analog multitrack machines can have up to 24 tracks on a tape two inches wide which is the widest analog tape that is generally available. Prototype machines, by [[Music Center Incorporated|MCI]] in 1978, using 3" tape for 32 tracks never went into production, though [[Otari Incorporated|Otari]] made a 32 track 2" MX-80.  A few studios still operate large format analog recorders, though much of the time their use is only to copy sounds onto a modern digital format.  Maintaining these machines has become increasingly difficult as new parts are rarely available.  New tape is still available but prices have risen significantly in recent years.

[[File:TEAC 2340.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] 2340, a popular early (1973) home multitrack recorder, four tracks on ¼ inch tape.]]

==Home systems==

In 1972 [[TEAC Corporation|TEAC]] marketed their consumer 4-channel [[quadraphonic]] tape recorders for use as home multitrack recorders.  The result were the popular TEAC 2340 and 3340 models.  Both used ¼ inch tape.  The 2340 ran at either 3¾ or 7½ inches per second and used 7-inch reels while the 3340 ran at 7½ or 15&amp;nbsp;inches per second and used 10½ inch reels.  The 2340 was priced at under U.S. $1,000 making it very popular for home use.

The advent of the [[compact audio cassette]] (developed in 1963) ultimately led to affordable, portable four-track machines such as the [[Tascam]] [[Portastudio]] which debuted in 1979. Cassette-based machines could not provide the same audio quality as [[reel-to-reel]] machines, but served as a useful tool for professional and semi-pro musicians in making [[demo (music)|song demos]]. The Portastudio had a revolutionary effect on the emerging [[punk rock]] genre, because it enabled young bands to make recordings without signing to a [[record label]]. In the early years of punk, many bands self-produced their own recordings and sold them at gigs and by putting advertisements in underground [[zine]]s. [[Bruce Springsteen|Bruce Springsteen's]] 1982 album ''[[Nebraska (album)|Nebraska]]'' was made this way, with Springsteen choosing the album's earlier demo versions over the later studio recordings.

The familiar tape cassette was designed to accommodate four channels of audio – in a commercially recorded cassette these four tracks would normally constitute the stereo channels (each consisting of two tracks) for both 'sides' of the cassette – in a four-track cassette recorder all four tracks of a cassette are utilized together, often with the tape running at twice the normal speed (3¾ instead of 1⅞ inches per second) for increased fidelity. A separate signal can be recorded on to each of four tracks. (As such, the four-track machine does not utilize the two separate sides of the cassette in the conventional sense; if the cassette is inserted the other way round, all four tracks play in reverse.) As with professional machines, two or more tracks can be bounced down to one. When recording is complete, the volume level of each track is optimized, [[effect unit|electronic effects]] such as [[reverb]] are added to certain tracks where desired, each track is separately 'panned' to the desired point in the stereo field and the resulting stereo signal is mixed down to a separate stereo machine (such as a conventional cassette recorder).

[[File:Alesis-HD24.jpg|thumb|300px|The Alesis HD24 stand-alone multitrack hard disk recorder.]]

==Digital multitracking==

By the early 1970s, Thomas Stockham of Sound Stream Digital, created the first practical use of [[pulse code modulation]], also called PCM [[digital recording]], for [[high fidelity]] purposes. The first to be released were rereleased cleaned up versions of acoustic recordings made by the great tenor, [[Enrico Caruso]]. Early computer algorithms were used in the process of cleaning up the scratchy old 78 RPM records. The process could not be done in "real time" as the early computers were not very powerful or fast, compared to 2010-era computers. All of the data had to be stored on linear digital tape and then played back, in real time. The actual ingest from the 78 RPM records to the digital tape was also done in real-time. The computer processing to clean up the surface noise, pops and scratches took the early computers quite some time to process.

By the late 1970s, [[3M]] introduced the first digital multi-track recorder. It utilized 1-inch wide tape and recorded 32 tracks. Unlike analog tape, edits could not be accomplished with a grease pencil, razor blades and splicing tape. So a secondary 4 track editing &amp; mix down recorder was also created with an electronically-controlled edit controller to make effective digital edits. This early system used a 16-bit digital "word". The only converters of the day were 12 bit &amp; 4 bit. So two were cascaded/daisy-chained to create the necessary 16-bit "word" for 96 DB of dynamic range. The signal was then sampled faster than any other digital recordings made up until that time at 50,000 times per second (50&amp;nbsp;kHz). It was known to be the best sounding{{Disputed inline|Talk page section|date=April 2018}} of all the later digital multi-track recorders because their use of 50&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling did not become the industry standards later established as 44.1&amp;nbsp;kHz for CD's &amp; 48&amp;nbsp;kHz for digital video.

The accepted world standard was created by [[Sony]] along with Philips. Sony created a 24 track digital recorder and [[Mitsubishi Corporation]] created a different 32 track digital recorder. The Mitsubishi recorded their data differently and it could be edited, the old-fashioned analog way, with a razor blade and splicing tape. The Sony used 1/2 inch tape whereas the Mitsubishi used 1 inch wide tape. So the first recordings that were released produced on the 3M, 32 track digital recorder were still analog vinyl releases, since the CD had yet to be invented. These professional linear tape digital recorders established the "DASH" format meaning, " Digital Audio Stationary Head". By the time the other manufacturers released their digital multi-track recorders, the CD had already been developed. The sampling rate dictates the upper range of the frequency response, whereas the bit depth dictates the [[dynamic range]] and [[signal to noise ratio]]s.

Starting in 1992, the ALESIS Corporation, a company which made digital [[drum machine]]s and inexpensive analog [[audio mixer]]s introduced the first multitrack, eight track, project studio, digital 8 track machine. It was named the ADAT, after the earlier 2 track digital recorders of the time known as DAT (Digital Audio Tape), which were based upon a small spinning head, similar to a consumer video recorder. The ADAT machine recorded its data in an already well-established consumer format based on VHS videotape recorder technology. Eight separate data tracks were recorded within the same bandwidth it took to record a TV show on a home video recorder (VHS). Numerous machines could be electronically locked together with a single cable. You could plug in enough 8 track machines together to create one giant 128 track machine. And like the professional studio recorders before it, a large full function [[remote control]] was also available.

The following year, the TEAC/TASCAM Corporation, introduced their DA-88. Those used the smaller 8&amp;nbsp;mm video format tapes. Those recorded four duplexed pairs of data tracks and would require a "read before write" function for [[overdubbing]] purposes of adjacent tracks. A full size remote and remote metering was also made available. Later units introduced by both companies provided for higher bit depths such as 20 &amp; 24 bit. These machines like the early home studio TEAC's before them, slashed the prices of professional digital multitrack recording. It changed the recording industry forever.
[[File:Korg D888.jpg|right|thumb|Korg D888 eight-track digital recorder]]
By the late 1990s, dedicated multitrack recorders faded with the introduction of the [[classic Mac OS|Macintosh operating system]] and [[Windows operating system]]s in personal computers. Some of the first companies jumping on board with this technology were New England Digital and Digidesign, from the US &amp; Fairlight, from Australia. Through the 1990s, multitrack recorders became digital, using a variety of technologies and media types. These including digital tape format (such as [[ADAT]]), or in some cases [[Minidisc]]s.

Some of the leading providers of multitrackers were [[Tascam]] (hard drive or cassette based), [[Alesis]] (ADAT digital tape based), [[Roland Corporation|Roland]]/[[Boss Corporation|Boss]] (hard drive based), [[Fostex]] (hard drive based), [[Yamaha Corporation|Yamaha]] (hard drive based), and [[Korg]].

A highly competitive market and rapidly falling costs for this equipment has made it common to find multitrack recording technology outside a typical recording studio.

== Computer-based recording ==

The first software-based digital multi-track recorder, called Deck, was released in 1990. The core engine technology and much of the user interface was programmed and designed by Josh Rosen, Mats Myrberg and John Dalton from a small San Francisco based company.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.12/osc.html Wired article on Digidesign/OSC history]&lt;/ref&gt; They formed the platform upon which [[Pro Tools]] was built in 1991. The same technology lay behind the 1992 release of [[Cubase]] Audio, the first version to offer audio support in addition to [[MIDI]] sequencing capabilities.

While hardware costs have fallen the power of the personal computer have increased, so that in the 2010s, a good quality home computer is sufficiently powerful to serve as a complete multitrack recorder, if a band or performer has a USB microphone or a regular microphone and a [[sound card]] adapter, using inexpensive hardware and software. Since 2012, the multitracking software [[GarageBand]] is offered as a free download for all of [[Apple Inc.|Apple's]] new computers or $4.99 for older models.  GarageBand added to the many free or under $100 solutions available to the Windows platform that run on less expensive but often more powerful hardware.  In a price range between $150 and usually under $1000, superior software mimicking complex recording studios that once could cost a hundred thousand dollars, or more, are also available  However solutions this powerful are not needed for most applications.  This is a far cry from the days when multitrack recorders cost thousands of dollars and few people could afford them.  In early (circa) 2000 the availability of low cost CakeWalk for windows provided opportunities for many to get a start in multi-track digital recording on the Windows for around $50 to $100.  After hardware became more powerful, more capabilities became available, including more digital channels and plug in effects.

In the 2010s, the availability of inexpensive software coupled with low cost hardware solutions, have enabled many [[singer-songwriter]]s to self-produce their first recordings without paying high fees for a professional recording studio or audio engineer. The most popular DAW today are: Pro Tools, Reaper, Live, Cubase, Logic and Digital Performer.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
The scientific study of [[speciation]] — how [[species]] evolve to become new species — began around the time of [[Charles Darwin]] in the middle of the 19th century. Many naturalists at the time recognized the relationship between [[biogeography]] (the way species are distributed) and the [[evolution]] of species. The 20th century saw the growth of the field of speciation, with major contributors such as [[Ernst Mayr]] researching and documenting species' geographic patterns and relationships. The field grew in prominence with the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] in the early part of that century. Since then, research on speciation has expanded immensely.

The language of speciation has grown more complex. Debate over classification schemes on the mechanisms of speciation and [[reproductive isolation]] continue. The 21st century has seen a resurgence in the study of speciation, with new techniques such as molecular [[phylogenetics]] and [[systematics]]. Speciation has largely been divided into discrete modes that correspond to rates of gene flow between two incipient populations. Today however, research has driven the development of alternative schemes and the discovery of new processes of speciation.

[[Charles Darwin]] introduced the idea that species could evolve and split into separate lineages, referring to it as ''specification'' in his 1859 book ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name="Singh2012"&gt;{{Citation |title=Concepts of species and modes of speciation | author=B. N. Singh | journal=Current Science | year=2012 | volume=103 | issue=7 | pages=784–790 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1906 that the modern term ''speciation'' was coined by the biologist [[Orator F. Cook]].&lt;ref name="Singh2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cook |first=Orator F. |authorlink=Orator F.

Allen Orr | date=2004 | pages=1–545 | publisher=Sinauer Associates | isbn=0-87893-091-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} It is almost universally accepted that Darwin's book did not directly address its title.&lt;ref name="Mallet2008"&gt;{{Citation | title=A century of evolution: Ernst Mayr (1904-2005): Mayr's view of Darwin: was Darwin wrong about speciation? | author=James Mallet | journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | year=2008 | volume=95 | issue=1 | pages=3–16 | doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.2008.01089.x | url=https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/95/1/3/2701309 | deadurl=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203072521/https://academic.oup.com/biolinnean/article/95/1/3/2701309 | archive-date=2018-02-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin instead saw speciation as occurring by species entering new [[ecological niche]]s.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|125}}

=== Darwin's views ===
Controversy exists as to whether [[Charles Darwin]] recognized a true geographical-based model of speciation in his publication ''On the Origin of Species''.&lt;ref name=Mallet2010/&gt; In chapter 11, "Geographical Distribution", Darwin discusses geographic barriers to migration, stating for example that "barriers of any kind, or obstacles to free migration, are related in a close and important manner to the differences between the productions of various regions [of the world]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Darwin |first1=Charles |title=On the Origin of Species |date=1859 |publisher=Murray |page=347 |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081005185317/http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?itemID=F373&amp;viewtype=text&amp;pageseq=1 |archive-date=2008-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; F. J. Sulloway contends that Darwin's position on speciation was "misleading" at the least&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Geographic isolation in Darwin's thinking: the vicissitudes of a crucial idea | author=F. J. Sulloway | journal=Studies in the History of Biology | year=1979 | volume=3 | issue= | pages=23–65 | pmid=11610987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and may have later misinformed Wagner and David Starr Jordan into believing that Darwin viewed sympatric speciation as the most important mode of speciation.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|83}} Nevertheless, Darwin never fully accepted Wagner's concept of geographical speciation.&lt;ref name=Mallet2010/&gt;

The evolutionary biologist [[James Mallet]] maintains that the mantra repeated concerning Darwin's ''Origin of Species'' book having never actually discussed speciation is specious.&lt;ref name="Mallet2008"/&gt; The claim began with [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] and [[George Romanes]] (contemporaries of Darwin's), who declared that Darwin failed to explain the origins of inviability and sterility in hybrids.&lt;ref name="Mallet2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mallet2013"&gt;Mallet, James (2013). Darwin and species. In Michael Ruse (eds) ''The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Darwin and Evolutionary Thought'', Cambridge University Press, Pp. 109–115.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar claims were promulgated by the [[Mutationism|mutationist]] school of thought during the late 20th century, and even after the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern evolutionary synthesis]] by [[Richard Goldschmidt]].&lt;ref name="Mallet2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mallet2013"/&gt; Another strong proponent of this view about Darwin came from Mayr.&lt;ref name="Mallet2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mallet2013"/&gt; Mayr maintained that Darwin was unable to address the problem of speciation, as he did not define species using the biological species concept.&lt;ref name="Kottler1978"&gt;{{Citation |title=Charles Darwin's biological species concept and theory of geographic speciation: the transmutation notebooks |author=Malcolm J. Kottler |journal=Annals of Science |year=1978 |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=275–297 |doi=10.1080/00033797800200251 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Mayr's view has not been entirely accepted, as Darwin's transmutation notebooks contained writings concerning the role of isolation in the splitting of species.&lt;ref name="Kottler1978"/&gt; Furthermore, Many of Darwin's ideas on speciation largely match the modern theories of both [[adaptive radiation]] and [[ecological speciation]].&lt;ref name=Mallet2010/&gt;

{{see also|Geographic speciation}}
Recognition of geographic factors involved in species populations was present even before Darwin, with many naturalists aware of the role of isolation in species relationships.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"&gt;{{Citation | title=Animal Species and Evolution | edition= | author=Ernst Mayr | date=1963 | pages=1–797 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|482}} In 1833, [[C. L. Gloger]] published ''The Variation of Birds Under the Influence of Climate'' in which he described geographic variations, but did not recognize that geographic isolation was an indicator of past speciation events.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|482}} Another naturalist in 1856, [[Thomas Vernon Wollaston|Wollaston]], studied island beetles in comparison to mainland species.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|482}} He saw isolation as key to their differentiation.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|482}} However, he did not recognize that the pattern was due to speciation.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|483}} One naturalist, [[Christian Leopold von Buch|Leopold von Buch]] (1825) did recognize the geographic patterns and explicitly stated that geographic isolation may lead to species separating into new species.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|483}} Mayr suggests that Von Buch was likely the first naturalist to truly suggest geographic speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=The Evolutionary Synthesis: Perspectives on the Unification of Biology | edition= | author=Ernst Mayr | date=1998 | pages=36 | publisher=Harvard University Press | isbn=978-0674272262 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other naturalists, such as [[Henry Walter Bates]] (1863), recognized and accepted the patterns as evidence of speciation, but in Bate's case, did not propose a coherent model.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|484}}

In 1868, [[Moritz Wagner]] was the first to propose the concept of geographic speciation&lt;ref name=Jordan1905&gt;{{Citation |title=The Origin of Species Through Isolation | author=David Starr Jordan | journal=Science | year=1905 | volume=22 | issue=566 | pages=545–562 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|484}} in which he used the term ''Separationstheorie''.&lt;ref name=Mallet2010&gt;{{Citation |title=Why was Darwin’s view of species rejected by twentieth century biologists? | author=James Mallet | journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy | year=2010 | volume=25 | pages=497–527 | doi=10.1007/s10539-010-9213-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]], the evolutionary biologist and a strong proponent of the importance of natural selection, highlighted the role of geographic isolation in promoting speciation,&lt;ref name="Modes and Mechanisms of Speciation"&gt;{{Citation |title=Modes and Mechanisms of Speciation | author=Hannes Schuler, Glen R.

Wagner and other naturalists who studied the geographic distributions of animals, such as [[Karl Jordan]] and [[David Starr Jordan]], noticed that closely related species were often geographically isolated from one another (allopatrically distributed) which lead to the advocation of the importance of geographic isolation in the origin of species.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Karl Jordan is thought to have recognized the unification of mutation and isolation in the origin of new species — in stark contrast to the prevailing views at the time.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|486}} David Starr Jordan reiterated Wagner's proposal in 1905, providing a wealth of evidence from nature to support the theory,&lt;ref name="Jordan1905"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Law of Geminate Species | author=David Starr Jordan | journal=American Naturalist | year=1908 | volume=42 | pages=73–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|2}} and asserting that geographic isolation is obvious but had been unfortunately ignored by most geneticists and experimental evolutionary biologists at the time.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|487}} [[Joel Asaph Allen]] suggested the observed pattern of geographic separation of closely related species be called "Jordan's Law" (or Wagner's Law).&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|487}} Despite the contentions, most taxonomists did accept the geographic model of speciation.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|487}}

Many of the early terms used to describe speciation were outlined by Ernst Mayr.&lt;ref name="Harrison2012"&gt;{{Citation |title=The Language of Speciation | author=Richard G. Harrison | journal=Evolution | year=2012 | volume=66 | issue=12 | pages=3643–3657 | doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01785.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first to encapsulate the then contemporary literature in his 1942 publication ''[[Systematics and the Origin of Species|Systematics and the Origin of Species, from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist]]'' and in his subsequent 1963 publication ''[[Animal Species and Evolution]]''. Like Jordan's works, they relied on direct observations of nature, documenting the occurrence of geographic speciation.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|86}} He described the three modes: geographic, semi-geographic, and non-geographic; which today, are referred to as allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric respectively.&lt;ref name="Harrison2012"/&gt; Mayr's 1942 publication, influenced heavily by the ideas of Karl Jordan and Poulton, was regarded as the authoritative review of speciation for over 20 years—and is still valuable today.&lt;ref name="Mallet2003"/&gt;

A major focus of Mayr's works was on the importance of geography in facilitating speciation; with islands often acting as a central theme to many of the speciation concepts put forth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=A century of evolution: Ernst Mayr (1904–2005): Speciation on islands: what are we learning? | author=Brent C. Emerson | journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society | year=2008 | volume=95 | issue=1 | pages=47–52 | doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of which was the concept of [[peripatric speciation]], a variant of allopatric speciation&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, E. 1954.

Processes of speciation in animals. In: ''Mechanisms of Speciation'' (A. R. I. Liss, ed.), pp. 1–19. Alan R.

This concept arose by an interpretation of Wagner's ''Separationstheorie'' as a form of [[founder effect]] speciation that focused on small geographically isolated species.&lt;ref name=Mallet2010/&gt; This model was later expanded and modified to incorporate [[sexual selection]] by [[Kenneth Y.

== Modern evolutionary synthesis ==
{{main|Modern synthesis (20th century)}}
Many geneticists at the time did little to bridge the gap between the genetics of natural selection and the origin of reproductive barriers between species.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|3}} [[Ronald Fisher]] proposed a model of speciation in his 1930 publication ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'', where he described disruptive selection acting on sympatric or parapatric populations — with reproductive isolation completed by reinforcement.&lt;ref name="Coyne1994"/&gt; Other geneticists such as [[J. B. S. Haldane]] did not even recognize that species were real, while [[Sewall Wright]] ignored the topic, despite accepting allopatric speciation.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|3}}

The primary contributors to the incorporation of speciation into modern evolutionary synthesis were Ernst Mayr and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]].&lt;ref name="Coyne1994"&gt;{{Citation |title=Ernst Mayr and the origin of species | author=Jerry A. Coyne | journal=Evolution | year=1994 | volume=48 | issue=1 | pages=19–30| doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.1994.tb01290.x |pmid=28567778 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobzhansky, a geneticist, published ''[[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]'' in 1937, in which he formulated the genetic framework for how speciation could occur.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|2}} He recognized that speciation was an unsolved problem in biology at the time, rejecting Darwin’s position that new species arose by occupation of new niches — contending that reproductive isolation was instead based on barriers to gene flow.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Subsequently, Mayr conducted extensive work on the geography of species, emphasizing the importance of geographic separation and isolation, in which he filled Dobzhansky‘s gaps concerning the origin of biodiversity (in his 1942 book).&lt;ref name="Mayr2004"&gt;{{Citation | title=80 years of watching the evolutionary scenery | author=Ernst Mayr | journal=Science | year=2004 | volume=305 | issue=5680 | pages=46–47 | doi=10.1126/science.1100561 | url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/305/5680/46.full.pdf | deadurl=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180203071559/http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/305/5680/46.full.pdf | archive-date=2018-02-03 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of their works gave rise, not without controversy, to the modern understanding of speciation; stimulating a wealth of research on the topic.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Furthermore, this extended to plants as well as animals with [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]]’s book, ''[[Variation and Evolution in Plants]]'' and the much later, 1981 book, ''[[Plant Speciation]]'' by [[Verne Grant]].

In 1947, "a consensus had been achieved among geneticists, paleontologists and systematists and that evolutionary biology as an independent biological discipline had been established" during a Princeton University conference.&lt;ref name="Haffer2007"&gt;{{Citation | title=Ornithology, Evolution, and Philosophy: The Life and Science of Ernst Mayr 1904–2005 | edition= | author=Jürgen Haffer | date=2007 | pages=183–241 | publisher=Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg  | isbn=978-3-540-71777-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This 20th century synthesis incorporated speciation. Since then, the ideas have been consistently and repeatedly confirmed.&lt;ref name="Mayr2004"/&gt;

== Contemporary work ==
After the synthesis, speciation research continued largely within natural history and biogeography — with much less emphasis on genetics.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|4}} The study of speciation has seen its largest increase since the 1980s&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|4}} with an influx of publications and a host of new terms, methods, concepts, and theories.&lt;ref name="Harrison2012"/&gt; This "third phase" of work — as [[Jerry Coyne|Jerry A. Coyne]] and [[H. Allen Orr]] put it — has led to a growing complexity of the language used to describe the many processes of speciation.&lt;ref name="Harrison2012"/&gt; The research and literature on speciation have become, "enormous, scattered, and increasingly technical".&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|1}}

From the 1980s, new research tools increased the robustness of research,&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|4}} assisted by new methods, theoretical frameworks, models, and approaches.&lt;ref name="Harrison2012"/&gt; Coyne and Orr discuss the modern, post-1980s developments centered around five major themes:
# genetics (also a primary factor in the Modern Synthesis),
# [[molecular biology]] and analysis (namely, [[phylogenetics]] and [[systematics]]);
# comparative analysis;
# mathematical modeling and computer simulations; and
# the role of [[ecology]].&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Ecologists became aware that the ecological factors behind speciation were under-represented. This saw the growth in research concerning ecology's role in facilitating speciation — rightly designated [[ecological speciation]].&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|4}} This focus on ecology generated a host of new terms relating to the barriers to reproduction&lt;ref name="Harrison2012"/&gt; (''e.g.'' allochronic speciation, in which gene flow is reduced or removed by timing of breeding periods; or habitat isolation, in which species occupy different habitats within the same area). [[Sympatric speciation]], regarded by Mayr as unlikely, has become widely accepted.&lt;ref name="Theory and speciation"&gt;{{Citation |title=Theory and speciation | author=Michael Turelli| author2=Nicholas H.

Researchers have long debated the roles of [[sexual selection]], natural selection, and [[genetic drift]] in speciation.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|383}} Darwin extensively discussed sexual selection, with his work greatly expanded on by Ronald Fisher; however, it was not until 1983 that the biologist [[Mary Jane West-Eberhard]] recognized the importance of sexual selection in speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=2003 Sewall Wright Award: Mary Jane West‐Eberhard | author=Marlene Zuk | journal=American Naturalist | year=2004 | volume=163 | issue=1 | pages=i–ii | doi=10.1086/381946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|3}} Natural selection plays a role in that any selection towards reproductive isolation can result in speciation — whether indirectly or directly. Genetic drift has been widely researched from the 1950s onwards, especially with peak-shift models of speciation by genetic drift.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|388}}  Mayr championed [[founder effect]]s, in which isolated individuals, like those found on islands near a mainland, experience a strong population bottleneck, as they contain only a small sample of the genetic variation in the main population.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|390}}&lt;ref&gt;Mayr, Ernst (1954).

(eds) ''Evolution as a Process'', George Allen and Unwin, London, Pp. 157–180.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, other biologists such as [[Hampton L. Carson (biologist)|Hampton L. Carson]], [[Alan Templeton]], [[Sergey Gavrilets]], and [[Alan Hastings]] developed related models of speciation by genetic drift, noting that islands were inhabited mostly by endemic species.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Provine|Provine, William Ball]] (1989).

The three primary geographic modes of speciation ([[Allopatric speciation|allopatric]], [[Parapatric speciation|parapatric]], and [[Sympatric speciation|sympatric]]) can exist within this continuum, as well as other non-geographic modes.]]
Throughout the history of research concerning speciation, classification and delineation of modes and processes have been debated. [[Julian Huxley]] divided speciation into three separate modes: geographical speciation, genetic speciation, and ecological speciation.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|427}} Sewall Wright proposed ten different, varying modes.&lt;ref name="Mayr1963"/&gt;{{rp|427}} Ernst Mayr championed the importance of physical, geographic separation of species populations, maintaining it to be of major importance to speciation. He originally proposed the three primary modes known today: geographic, semi-geographic, non-geographic;&lt;ref name="Harrison2012"/&gt; corresponding to allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric respectively.

The phrase "modes of speciation" is imprecisely defined, most often indicating speciation occurring as a result of a species geographic distribution.&lt;ref name="eLS2012Shaw"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Shaw | first =Kerry L. | title =Species and Speciation: Overview | journal =eLS | publisher =John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd | location =Chichester | date =2012 | url =http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470015902.a0001742.pub2/abstract | doi =10.1002/9780470015902.a0001742.pub2 | deadurl =no | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20180125135943/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470015902.a0001742.pub2/abstract | archive-date =2018-01-25 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; More succinctly, the modern classification of speciation is often described as occurring on a gene flow continuum (i.e., allopatry at &lt;math&gt;m=0&lt;/math&gt; and sympatry at &lt;math&gt;m=0.5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Gavrilets2004"&gt;{{Citation | title=Fitness landscapes and the origin of species | edition= | author=Sergey Gavrilets | date=2004 | pages=13 | publisher=Princeton University Press | isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Perspectiver: Models of Speciation: What have we Learned in 40 Years? |author=Sergey Gavrilets |journal=Evolution |year=2003 |volume=57 |issue=10 |pages=2197–2215 |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00233.x |pmid=14628909 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00233.x/epdf |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211160348/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.0014-3820.2003.tb00233.x/epdf |archive-date=2018-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;) This gene flow concept views speciation as based on the exchange of genes between populations instead of seeing a purely geographic setting as necessarily relevant. Despite this, concepts of biogeographic modes can be translated into models of gene flow (such as that in the image at left); however, this translation has led to some confusion of language in the scientific literature.&lt;ref name="Harrison2012"/&gt;

== History of modes and mechanisms ==
=== Sympatric speciation ===
[[Sympatric speciation]], from its beginnings with Darwin (who did not coin the term), has been a contentious issue.&lt;ref name="eLS2012Shaw"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|125}} Mayr, along with many other evolutionary biologists, interpreted Darwins's view of speciation and the origin of biodiversity as arising by species entering new [[ecological niche]]s—a form of sympatric speciation.&lt;ref name="Mallet2008"/&gt; Before Mayr, sympatric speciation was regarded as the primary mode of speciation. In 1963, Mayr provided a strong criticism, citing various flaws in the theory.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|126}} After that, sympatric speciation fell out of favor with biologists and has only recently seen a resurgence in interest.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|126}} Some biologists, such as James Mallet, believe that Darwin's view on speciation was misunderstood and misconstrued by Mayr.&lt;ref name="Mallet2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Speciation in the 21st century | author=James Mallet | journal=Heredity | year=2005 | volume=95 | issue=1 | pages=105–109 | doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800686 | issn=0018-067X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, sympatric speciation is supported by evidence from laboratory experiments and observations from nature.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|127}}&lt;ref name="Theory and speciation"/&gt;

=== Hybrid speciation ===
For most of the history of speciation, hybridization (polyploidy) has been a contentious issue, as botanists and zoologists have traditionally viewed hybridization's role in speciation differently.&lt;ref name="Harrison2012"/&gt; [[Carl Linnaeus]] was the earliest to suggest hybridization in 1760,&lt;ref name="eLS2012Abbott"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Abbott | first=Richard J. | last2=Reiseberg | first2=Loren H. | title=Hybrid Speciation | journal=eLS | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd | location=Chichester | date=2012 | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470015902.a0001753.pub2/abstract | doi=10.1002/9780470015902.a0001753.pub2 | deadurl=no | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707151410/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470015902.a0001753.pub2/abstract | archive-date=2017-07-07 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Øjvind Winge]] was the first to confirm allopolyploidy in 1917,&lt;ref name="eLS2012Abbott"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Interspecific Hybridization in Nicotiana.

Historically, zoologists considered hybridization to be a rare phenomenon, while botanists found it to be commonplace in plant species.&lt;ref name="Harrison2012"/&gt; The botanists [[G. Ledyard Stebbins]] and [[Verne Grant]] were two of the well known botanists who championed the idea of hybrid speciation during the 1950s to the 1980s.&lt;ref name="Harrison2012"/&gt; Hybrid speciation, also called polyploid speciation (or polyploidy) is speciation that results by an increase in the number of sets of chromosomes.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|321}} It is effectively a form of sympatric speciation that happens instantly.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|322}} Grant coined the term [[recombinational speciation]] in 1981; a special form of hybrid speciation where a new species results from hybridization and is itself, reproductively isolated from both its parents.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|337}} Recently, biologists have increasingly recognized that hybrid speciation can occur in animals as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Hybrid speciation |author=James Mallet |journal=Nature |year=2007 |volume=446 |issue=7133 |pages=279–283 |doi=10.1038/nature05706 |pmid=17361174 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05706 |deadurl=no |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180211160349/https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05706 |archive-date=2018-02-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reinforcement ===
[[File:Alfred Russel Wallace 1862 - Project Gutenberg eText 15997.png|thumb|right|150px|The young naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in 1862]]
The concept of [[Reinforcement (speciation)|speciation by reinforcement]] has a complex history, with its popularity among scholars changing significantly over time.&lt;ref name="Noor1999"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|353}} The theory of reinforcement experienced three phases of historical development:&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|366}}
# plausibility based on unfit hybrids
# implausibility based on the finding that hybrids may have some fitness
# plausibility based on empirical studies and biologically complex and realistic models

It was originally proposed by [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] in 1889,&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|353}} termed the Wallace effect—a term rarely used by scientists today.&lt;ref name="eLS2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last =Sætre | first =Glenn-Peter | title =Reinforcement | journal =eLS | publisher =John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd | location =Chichester | date =2012 | url =http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470015902.a0001754.pub3/abstract | doi =10.1002/9780470015902.a0001754.pub3 | deadurl =no | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20180211160349/http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470015902.a0001754.pub3/abstract | archive-date =2018-02-11 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace's hypothesis differed from the modern conception in that it focused on post-zygotic isolation, strengthened by [[group selection]].&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|353}}&lt;ref&gt;Littlejohn, M. J. (1981). Reproductive isolation: A critical review. In W. R. Atchley and D. S. Woodruff (eds) ''Evolution and Speciation'', Cambridge University Press, Pp. 298–334.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Natural Selection: Methods and Applications | author=Mario A. Fares | date=2015 | pages=3 | publisher=CRC Press | isbn=9781482263725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobzhansky was the first to provide a thorough, modern description of the process in 1937,&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|353}} though the actual term itself was not coined until 1955 by [[W. Frank Blair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Mating call and stage of speciation in the ''Microhyla olivacea-M. carolinensis'' complex | author=Blair, W. Frank | journal=Evolution | year=1955 | volume=9 | issue= | pages=469–480 | doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, [[Ronald Fisher]] laid out the first genetic description of the process of reinforcement in ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]'', and in 1965 and 1970 the first computer simulations were run to test for its plausibility.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|366}} Later, population genetic&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=On the evolution of behavioral reproductive isolation: The Wallace effect | author=Stanley Sawyer and Daniel Hartl | journal=Theoretical Population Biology | year=1981 | volume=19 | issue=1 | pages=261–273 | doi=10.1016/0040-5809(81)90021-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and quantitative genetic&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=A Two-Sex Polygenic Model for the Evolution of Premating Isolation.

Marshall, Michael L. Arnold, and Daniel J. Howard | journal=Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | year=2002 | volume=17 | issue=12 | pages=558–563 | doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(02)02636-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of theoretical objections arose at the time. Since the early 1990s, reinforcement has seen a revival in popularity, with perceptions by evolutionary biologists accepting its plausibility—due primarily from a sudden increase in data, empirical evidence from laboratory studies and nature, complex computer simulations, and theoretical work.&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|372–375}}

The scientific language concerning reinforcement has also differed over time, with different researchers applying various definitions to the term.&lt;ref name="eLS2012"/&gt; First used to describe the observed mating call differences in ''[[Gastrophryne]]'' frogs within a secondary contact hybrid zone,&lt;ref name="eLS2012"/&gt; reinforcement has also been used to describe geographically separated populations that experience secondary contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Genetics And the Origin of Species | author=Theodosius Dobzhansky | date=1937 | publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Butlin]] demarcated incomplete post-zygotic isolation from complete isolation, referring to incomplete isolation as reinforcement and completely isolated populations as experiencing [[reproductive character displacement]].&lt;ref name="Butlin1989"&gt;Butlin, Roger K. (1989). Reinforcement of premating isolation. In Otte, D. and Endler, John A. (eds) ''Speciation and its Consequences'', Sinauer Associates, pp. 158–179, {{ISBN|0-87893-657-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Daniel J. Howard]] considered reproductive character displacement to represent either [[assortive mating]] or the [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] of traits for mate recognition (specifically between sympatric populations).&lt;ref name="eLS2012"/&gt; Under this definition, it includes pre-zygotic divergence and complete post-zygotic isolation.&lt;ref name="Howard1993"&gt;Howard, D. J. (1993). Reinforcement: origin, dynamics and fate of an evolutionary hypothesis. In: Harrison, R. G. (eds) ''Hybrid Zones and the Evolutionary Process'', Oxford University Press, pp. 46–69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maria R. Servedio]] and [[Mohamed Noor]] consider any detected increase in pre-zygotic isolation as reinforcement, as long as it is a response to selection against mating between two different species.&lt;ref name="Servedio&amp;Noor"&gt;{{Citation |title=The Role of Reinforcement in Speciation: Theory and Data | author=Maria R. Servedio and Mohamed A. F. Noor | journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | year=2003 | volume=34 | issue= | pages=339–364 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coyne and Orr contend that, "true reinforcement is restricted to cases in which isolation is enhanced between taxa that can still exchange genes".&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt;{{rp|354}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8293">Integrated Asset Modelling (or IAM) is the generic term used in the [[petroleum industry|oil industry]] for computer modelling of both the [[reservoir simulation|subsurface]] and the [[artificial lift|surface elements]] of a field development. Historically the [[petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] has always been modelled separately from the surface network and the facilities. In order to capture the interaction between those two or more standalone models, several time consuming iterations were required. For example, a change in the water breakthrough leads to a change in the deliverability of the surface network which in turn leads to a production acceleration or deceleration in the reservoir. In order to go through this lengthy process more quickly the industry has slowly &lt;ref&gt;http://www.epmag.com/IT/item31595.php , retrieved 24/9/2011&lt;/ref&gt;  been adopting a more integrated approach which captures the constraints imposed by the infrastructure on the network immediately.

== Basis ==
As the aim of an IAM is to provide a production forecast which honours both the physical realities of the reservoir and the infrastructure it needs to contain the following elements;[[File:IAM virtual components.jpg|thumb|Typical Components of an IAM]]

*A pressure network
*A subsurface saturation model
*An availability model
*A constraint manager
*A production optimisation algorithm
Some but not all models also contain an economics and risk model component so that the IAM can be used for economic evaluation.

== IAM vs. IPM ==
The term ''Integrated Asset Modeling'' was first used by British Petroleum (BP). Historically the terms ''Integrated Production Modeling'' and ''Integrated Asset Modeling'' have been used interchangeably. The modern use of ''Integrated Production Modeling'' was coined when Petroleum Experts, Ltd. joined their MBAL modeling software with their GAP and Prosper modeling software to form an ''Integrated Production Model''.

== Benefits of Integrated Asset Modelling ==
Having an IAM built of an asset or future project offers several advantages;
*Faster runtimes which allow scenario analysis and [[monte carlo method|Monte Carlo analysis]]
*Insight in the interactions between various components of a development
*An answer in economic rather than recovery terms (not always available)

== Difficulties of Integrated Asset Modelling ==
By its very nature an IAM requires a multi disciplinary approach. Most companies are too compartmentalised for this to be easy, as a result of this an integrated approach has the following drawbacks;
*More difficult to spot errors
*Requires constant communication between various departments, ownership is either vague or too much part of one silo.
The biggest barrier to adoption of IAM is frequently the resistance of reservoir engineers to any simplification of the subsurface. This argument is sometimes valid, sometimes not, see below.

== Appropriate use of IAM&lt;ref&gt;http://petex.pesgb.org.uk/cgi-bin/somsid.cgi?page=html/abstracts/abstractid25, retrieved 24/9/2011&lt;/ref&gt; ==
As with any other software because of the inherent limitations in any virtual model use of an IAM is only appropriate during various stages of a project life. There are no hard and fast rules for this as there are a variety of software packages on the market which offer very accurate modelling of a very small scope to very rough modelling of a very large scope and anything in between. Currently the definition of IAM contains anything from daily optimisation to portfolio management. The success or failure of an IAM implementation project therefore depends on selecting the tool which is as complex as it needs to be but no more.
The following contains some examples of areas where an IAM is the appropriate decision support tool
* Concept Select
* Debottlenecking and optimisation of very large or complex infrastructures
* Life of field analysis of production optimisation scenarios
Note that for most of these areas the accuracy of the reservoir proxy is not important, the decision is made based on relative performance differences, not absolute values.

== Approach ==
Several different software packages are commercially available and there is a clear difference in philosophy between some of them. 
[[File:RAVE IAM GUI.jpg|thumb|RAVE GUI screenshot]]

=== Linked Existing Software ===
Some vendors who have previously marketed standalone software for the subsurface and the surface are now marketing additional software which provides a datalink between the various packages. The obvious benefit of this approach is that there is no loss in accuracy and it does not require a remodelling exercise. However this approach also has its drawbacks, there is no time gain and the integration component of the entire package requires expertise which is not readily available, external specialist are frequently called upon to build and maintain the links between the components.

=== Bespoke Software ===
There are relatively few software packages on the market which are truly integrated, however these can offer the benefit of shorter runtimes and lower expertise thresholds.

=== Software as a service ===
A number of the established service companies now offer integrated asset modelling as a service. In practice this means that existing models will be either converted or linked by specialists to form an integrated solution. This solution is expensive but frequently the preferred option if the highest accuracy is required.

{{Beyond the Standard Model|expanded=Theories}}
In [[physics]], '''Kaluza–Klein theory''' ('''KK theory''') is a classical [[unified field theory]] of [[gravitation]] and [[electromagnetism]] built around the idea of a [[Five-dimensional space#Physics|fifth dimension]] beyond the usual four of [[spacetime|space and time]] and considered an important precursor to [[string theory]].

The five-dimensional theory developed in three steps. The original hypothesis came from [[Theodor Kaluza]], who sent his results to Einstein in 1919,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |last=Pais |first=Abraham |date=1982 |title=Subtle is the Lord ...: The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |pages=329–330}}&lt;/ref&gt; and published them in 1921,&lt;ref name=kal&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaluza |first=Theodor |authorlink= |date=1921 |title=Zum Unitätsproblem in der Physik |journal=[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Sitzungsber. Preuss. Akad. Wiss.]] Berlin. (Math. Phys.) |volume= |issue= |pages=966–972 |issn= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which detailed a purely classical extension of [[general relativity]] to five dimensions and includes 15 components. Ten components are identified with the four-dimensional spacetime metric, four components with the electromagnetic vector potential, and one component with an unidentified [[scalar field]] sometimes called the "[[Radion (physics)|radion]]" or the "dilaton". Correspondingly, the five-dimensional Einstein equations yield the four-dimensional [[Einstein field equations]], the [[Maxwell equations]] for the [[electromagnetic field]], and an equation for the scalar field. Kaluza also introduced the "cylinder condition" hypothesis, that no component of the five-dimensional metric depends on the fifth dimension. Without this assumption, the field equations of five-dimensional relativity grow enormous in complexity.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=January 2016}} Standard four-dimensional physics seems to manifest the cylinder condition.

In 1926, [[Oskar Klein]] gave Kaluza's classical five-dimensional theory a quantum interpretation,&lt;ref name=KZ&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klein |first=Oskar |authorlink= |date=1926 |title=Quantentheorie und fünfdimensionale Relativitätstheorie |journal=[[Zeitschrift für Physik A]] |volume=37 |issue=12 |pages=895–906 |doi=10.1007/BF01397481 |url= |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 1926ZPhy...37..895K }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=KN&gt;{{cite journal | last=Klein | first=Oskar |date=1926 |journal=Nature |volume=118 |pages=516 |doi=10.1038/118516a0 |title=The Atomicity of Electricity as a Quantum Theory Law|bibcode = 1926Natur.118..516K }}&lt;/ref&gt; to accord with the then-recent discoveries of Heisenberg and Schrödinger. Klein introduced the hypothesis that the fifth dimension was curled up and microscopic, to explain the cylinder condition. Klein suggested that the geometry of the extra fifth dimension could take the form of a circle, with the radius of {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−30&lt;/sup&gt;}} cm.&lt;ref&gt;Yau and Nadis 2010, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Klein also calculated a scale for the fifth dimension based on the quantum of charge.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=May 2016}}

== Kaluza hypothesis ==
In his 1921 paper,&lt;ref name="kal"/&gt; Kaluza established all the elements of the classical five-dimensional theory: the metric, the field equations, the equations of motion, the stress-energy tensor, and the cylinder condition. With no [[free parameter]]s, it merely extends general relativity to five dimensions. One starts by hypothesizing a form of the five-dimensional metric &lt;math&gt; \widetilde{g}_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, where Latin indices span five dimensions. Let one also introduce the four-dimensional spacetime metric &lt;math&gt; {g}_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, where Greek indices span the usual four dimensions of space and time; a 4-vector &lt;math&gt; A^\mu &lt;/math&gt; identified with the electromagnetic vector potential; and a scalar field &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then decompose the 5D metric so that the 4D metric is framed by the electromagnetic vector potential, with the scalar field at the fifth diagonal. This can be visualized as:

:&lt;math&gt;
\widetilde{g}_{ab} \equiv \begin{bmatrix}g_{\mu\nu} + \phi^2 A_\mu A_\nu &amp; \phi^2 A_\mu \\ \phi^2 A_\nu &amp; \phi^2\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

One can write more precisely

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{g}_{\mu\nu} \equiv g_{\mu\nu} + \phi^2 A_{\mu} A_{\nu} , \qquad
\widetilde{g}_{5\nu} \equiv \widetilde{g}_{\nu 5} \equiv \phi^2 A_{\nu} , \qquad
\widetilde{g}_{55} \equiv \phi^2&lt;/math&gt;

where the index &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; indicates the fifth coordinate by convention even though the first four coordinates are indexed with 0, 1, 2, and 3. The associated inverse metric is

:&lt;math&gt;
\widetilde{g}^{ab} \equiv \begin{bmatrix}g^{\mu\nu} &amp; -A^\mu \\ -A^\nu &amp; g_{\alpha\beta}A^\alpha A^\beta + {1 \over \phi^2} \end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;.

This decomposition is quite general and all terms dimensionless. Kaluza then applies the machinery of standard [[general relativity]] to this metric. The field equations are obtained from five-dimensional [[Einstein equations]], and the equations of motion from the five-dimensional geodesic hypothesis. The resulting field equations provide both the equations of general relativity and of electrodynamics; the equations of motion provide the four-dimensional [[geodesic equation]] and the [[Lorentz force law]], and one finds that electric charge is identified with motion in the fifth dimension.

The hypothesis for the metric implies an invariant five-dimensional length element &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{d}\!s&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\operatorname{d}\!s^2 \equiv \widetilde{g}_{ab}\operatorname{d}\!x^a \operatorname{d}\!x^b = g_{\mu\nu}dx^\mu \operatorname{d}\!x^\nu + \phi^2 (A_\nu \operatorname{d}\!x^\nu + \operatorname{d}\!x^5)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

== Field equations from the Kaluza hypothesis ==
The field equations of the 5-dimensional theory were never adequately provided by Kaluza or Klein, mainly regarding the scalar field. The full Kaluza field equations are generally attributed to Thiry,&lt;ref name="thry"/&gt; who obtained vacuum field equations, although Kaluza &lt;ref name=kal/&gt; originally provided a stress-energy tensor for his theory and Thiry included a stress-energy tensor in his thesis. But as described by Gonner,&lt;ref name="gon"/&gt; several independent groups worked on the field equations in the 1940s and earlier. Thiry is perhaps best known only because an English translation was provided by Applequist, Chodos, &amp; Freund in their review book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Kaluza–Klein Theories |last=Appelquist |first=Thomas |authorlink= |author2=Chodos, Alan |author3=Freund, Peter G. O.  |date=1987 |publisher=Addison–Wesley |location=Menlo Park, Cal. |isbn=0-201-09829-6 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applequist et al. also provided an English translation of Kaluza's paper. There are no English translations of the Jordan papers.&lt;ref name="jor1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jor2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jor3"/&gt;

To obtain the 5D field equations, the 5D connections &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\Gamma}^a_{bc} &lt;/math&gt; are calculated from the 5D metric &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{g}_{ab} &lt;/math&gt;, and the 5D Ricci tensor &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{R}_{ab} &lt;/math&gt; is calculated from the 5D connections.

The classic results of Thiry and other authors presume the cylinder condition:
:&lt;math&gt; {\partial \widetilde{g}_{ab}\over\partial x^5} = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Without this assumption, the field equations become much more complex, providing many more degrees of freedom that can be identified with various new fields. Paul Wesson and colleagues have pursued relaxation of the cylinder condition to gain extra terms that can be identified with the matter fields,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Space-Time-Matter, Modern Kaluza-Klein Theory |last=Wesson |first=Paul S. |authorlink= |date=1999 |publisher=World Scientific |location=Singapore |isbn=981-02-3588-7 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for which Kaluza &lt;ref name=kal /&gt; otherwise inserted a stress-energy tensor by hand.

It has been an objection to the original Kaluza hypothesis to invoke the fifth dimension only to negate its dynamics. But Thiry argued &lt;ref name=gon/&gt; that the interpretation of the Lorentz force law in terms of a 5-dimensional geodesic militates strongly for a fifth dimension irrespective of the cylinder condition. Most authors have therefore employed the cylinder condition in deriving the field equations. Furthermore, vacuum equations are typically assumed for which

:&lt;math&gt; \widetilde{R}_{ab} =0&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; \widetilde{R}_{ab} \equiv \partial_c \widetilde{\Gamma}^c_{ab} - \partial_b \widetilde{\Gamma}^c_{ca} + \widetilde{\Gamma}^c_{cd}\widetilde{\Gamma}^d_{ab} - \widetilde{\Gamma}^c_{bd}\widetilde{\Gamma}^d_{ac}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{\Gamma}^a_{bc}\equiv {1\over 2} \widetilde{g}^{ad} (\partial_b \widetilde{g}_{dc} + \partial_c \widetilde{g}_{db} - \partial_d \widetilde{g}_{bc} ) &lt;/math&gt;
The vacuum field equations obtained in this way by Thiry &lt;ref name=thry/&gt; and Jordan's group &lt;ref name=jor1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jor2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=jor3 /&gt; are as follows.

The field equation for &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from
:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{R}_{55} = 0 \Rightarrow \Box \phi = {1\over 4} \phi^3 F^{\alpha\beta}F_{\alpha\beta} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; F_{\alpha\beta} \equiv \partial_\alpha A_\beta - \partial_\beta A_\alpha &lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\Box \equiv g^{\mu\nu}\nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu &lt;/math&gt;, and where &lt;math&gt; \nabla_{\mu} &lt;/math&gt; is a standard, 4D covariant derivative. It shows that the electromagnetic field is a source for the scalar field. Note that the scalar field cannot be set to a constant without constraining the electromagnetic field. The earlier treatments by Kaluza and Klein did not have an adequate description of the scalar field, and did not realize the implied constraint on the electromagnetic field by assuming the scalar field to be constant.

The field equation for &lt;math&gt;A^\nu&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from
:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{R}_{5\alpha} = 0 = {1\over 2} g^{\beta\mu} \nabla_\mu (\phi^3 F_{\alpha\beta}) &lt;/math&gt;
It has the form of the vacuum Maxwell equations if the scalar field is constant.

The field equation for the 4D Ricci tensor &lt;math&gt;R_{\mu\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is obtained from
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\widetilde{R}_{\mu\nu} - {1\over 2}\widetilde{g}_{\mu\nu} \widetilde{R} &amp;= 0 \Rightarrow \\ R_{\mu\nu} - {1\over 2} g_{\mu\nu} R &amp;= {1\over 2} \phi^2 \left ( g^{\alpha\beta} F_{\mu\alpha} F_{\nu\beta} - {1\over 4}g_{\mu\nu}F_{\alpha\beta} F^{\alpha\beta}\right ) + {1\over \phi} \left ( \nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu \phi - g_{\mu\nu}\Box\phi\right )
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the standard 4D Ricci scalar.

This equation shows the remarkable result, called the "Kaluza miracle", that the precise form for the [[electromagnetic stress-energy tensor]] emerges from the 5D vacuum equations as a source in the 4D equations: field from the vacuum. This relation allows the definitive identification of &lt;math&gt;A^\mu&lt;/math&gt; with the electromagnetic vector potential. Therefore, the field needs to be rescaled with a conversion constant &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;A^\mu \rightarrow kA^\mu&lt;/math&gt;.

The relation above shows that we must have
:&lt;math&gt;{k^2\over 2} =  {8\pi G\over c^4} {1\over \mu_0} = {2G\over c^2} {4\pi \epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]] and &lt;math&gt;\mu_0&lt;/math&gt; is the [[permeability of free space]]. In the Kaluza theory, the gravitational constant can be understood as an electromagnetic coupling constant in the metric. There is also a stress-energy tensor for the scalar field. The scalar field behaves like a variable gravitational constant, in terms of modulating the coupling of electromagnetic stress energy to spacetime curvature. The sign of &lt;math&gt;\phi^2&lt;/math&gt; in the metric is fixed by correspondence with 4D theory so that electromagnetic energy densities are positive. This turns out to imply that the 5th coordinate is spacelike in its signature in the metric.

In the presence of matter, the 5D vacuum condition can not be assumed. Indeed, Kaluza did not assume it. The full field equations require evaluation of the 5D Einstein tensor
:&lt;math&gt; \widetilde{G}_{ab} \equiv \widetilde{R}_{ab} - {1\over 2}\widetilde{g}_{ab}\widetilde{R}&lt;/math&gt;
as seen in the recovery of the electromagnetic stress-energy tensor above. The 5D curvature tensors are complex, and most English-language reviews contain errors in either &lt;math&gt; \widetilde{G}_{ab}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt; \widetilde{R}_{ab}&lt;/math&gt;, as does the English translation of.&lt;ref name=thry /&gt; See &lt;ref name="LLW"/&gt; for a complete set of 5D curvature tensors under the cylinder condition, evaluated using tensor algebra software.

== Equations of motion from the Kaluza hypothesis ==
The equations of motion are obtained from the five-dimensional geodesic hypothesis &lt;ref name=kal/&gt; in terms of a 5-velocity &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{U}^a \equiv dx^a/ds&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\widetilde{U}^b \widetilde{\nabla}_b \widetilde{U}^a = {d\widetilde{U}^a\over ds} + \widetilde{\Gamma}^a_{bc} \widetilde{U}^b \widetilde{U}^c =0
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be recast in several ways, and it has been studied in various forms by authors including Kaluza,&lt;ref name=kal/&gt; Pauli,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pauli|first1=Wolfgang|title=Theory of Relativity|date=1958|publisher=Pergamon Press|location=New York|pages=Supplement 23|edition=translated by George Field}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gross &amp; Perry,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gross|first1=D.J.|last2=Perry|first2=M.J.|journal=Nucl. Phys. B|date=1983|volume=226|pages=29–48|doi=10.1016/0550-3213(83)90462-5|title=Magnetic monopoles in Kaluza-Klein theories|bibcode = 1983NuPhB.226...29G }}&lt;/ref&gt; Gegenberg &amp; Kunstatter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gegenberg|first1=J.|last2=Kunstatter|title=The motion of charged particles in Kaluza-Klein space-time|first2=G.|journal=Phys. Lett.|date=1984|volume=106A|page=410}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Wesson &amp; Ponce de Leon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wesson|first1=P.S.|last2=Ponce de Leon|first2=J.|title=The equation of motion in Kaluza-Klein cosmology and its implications for astrophysics|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|date=1995|volume=294|page=1|bibcode = 1995A&amp;A...294....1W }}&lt;/ref&gt;
but it is instructive to convert it back to the usual 4-dimensional length element &lt;math&gt;c^2d\tau^2 \equiv g_{\mu\nu} dx^\mu dx^\nu&lt;/math&gt;, which is related to the 5-dimensional length element &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; as given above:
:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = c^2 d\tau^2 + \phi^2 (kA_\nu dx^\nu + dx^5)^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Then the 5D geodesic equation can be written &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Williams| first=L.L. |date=2012 |journal=Proceedings of 48th AIAA Joint Propulsion Conference| volume=AIAA 2012-3916| doi=10.2514/6.2012-3916| url= |title=Physics of the Electromagnetic Control of Spacetime and Gravity}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the spacetime components of the 4velocity, &lt;math&gt;U^\nu \equiv dx^\nu /d\tau&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
{dU^\nu\over d\tau} + \widetilde{\Gamma}^\mu_{\alpha\beta} U^\alpha U^\beta + 2 \widetilde{\Gamma}^\mu_{5\alpha} U^\alpha U^5 + \widetilde{\Gamma}^\mu_{55} (U^5)^2 + U^\mu {d\over d\tau}\ln \left ( {cd\tau\over ds} \right ) = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

The term quadratic in &lt;math&gt;U^\nu&lt;/math&gt; provides the 4D [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesic equation]] plus some electromagnetic terms:
:&lt;math&gt;
\widetilde{\Gamma}^\mu_{\alpha\beta} = \Gamma^\mu_{\alpha\beta} + {1\over 2} g^{\mu\nu}k^2 \phi^2 (A_{\alpha} F_{\beta\nu} + A_\beta F_{\alpha\nu}- A_\alpha A_\beta \partial_\nu \ln \phi^2 )
&lt;/math&gt;

The term linear in &lt;math&gt;U^\nu&lt;/math&gt; provides the [[Lorentz force law]]:
:&lt;math&gt;
\widetilde{\Gamma}^\mu_{5\alpha}={1\over 2} g^{\mu\nu} k\phi^2 (F_{\alpha\nu} - A_\alpha \partial_\nu \ln \phi^2)
&lt;/math&gt;
This is another expression of the "Kaluza miracle". The same hypothesis for the 5D metric that provides electromagnetic stress-energy in the Einstein equations, also provides the Lorentz force law in the equation of motions along with the 4D geodesic equation. Yet correspondence with the Lorentz force law requires that we identify the component of 5-velocity along the 5th dimension with electric charge:
:&lt;math&gt;
kU^5 = k {dx^5\over d\tau} \rightarrow {q\over mc}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is particle mass and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is particle electric charge. Thus, electric charge is understood as motion along the 5th dimension. The fact that the Lorentz force law could be understood as a geodesic in 5 dimensions was to Kaluza a primary motivation for considering the 5-dimensional hypothesis, even in the presence of the aesthetically-unpleasing cylinder condition.

Yet there is a problem: the term quadratic in &lt;math&gt;U^5&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;
\widetilde{\Gamma}^\mu_{55} = -{1\over 2}g^{\mu\alpha}\partial_\alpha \phi^2
&lt;/math&gt;
If there is no gradient in the scalar field, the term quadratic in &lt;math&gt;U^5&lt;/math&gt; vanishes. But otherwise the expression above implies
:&lt;math&gt;U^5 \sim c {q/m \over G^{1/2}}
&lt;/math&gt;
For elementary particles, &lt;math&gt;U^5 &gt; {\rm 10}^{20} c&lt;/math&gt;. The term quadratic in &lt;math&gt;U^5&lt;/math&gt; should dominate the equation, perhaps in contradiction to experience. This was the main shortfall of the 5-dimensional theory as Kaluza saw it,&lt;ref name=kal/&gt; and he gives it some discussion in his original article.

The equation of motion for &lt;math&gt;U^5&lt;/math&gt; is particularly simple under the cylinder condition. Start with the alternate form of the geodesic equation, written for the covariant 5-velocity:
:&lt;math&gt;
{d\widetilde{U}_a\over ds} = {1\over 2} \widetilde{U}^b  \widetilde{U}^c {\partial \widetilde{g}_{bc}\over\partial x^a}
&lt;/math&gt;
This means that under the cylinder condition, &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{U}_5&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of the 5-dimensional motion:
:&lt;math&gt;
\widetilde{U}_5 = \widetilde{g}_{5a}\widetilde{U}^a = \phi^2 {cd\tau\over ds} (kA_\nu U^\nu + U^5) = {\rm constant}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Kaluza's hypothesis for the matter stress-energy tensor ==
Kaluza &lt;ref name=kal/&gt; proposed a 5D matter stress tensor &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{T}_M^{ab}&lt;/math&gt; of the form

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{T}_M^{ab} = \rho {dx^a\over ds} {dx^b\over ds}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a density and the length element &lt;math&gt;ds&lt;/math&gt; is as defined above.

Then, the spacetime component gives a typical "dust" stress energy tensor:
:&lt;math&gt;
\widetilde{T}_M^{\mu\nu} = \rho {dx^\mu\over ds} {dx^\nu\over ds}
&lt;/math&gt;

The mixed component provides a 4-current source for the Maxwell equations:
:&lt;math&gt;
\widetilde{T}_M^{5\mu} = \rho {dx^\mu\over ds} {dx^5\over ds} = \rho U^\mu {q\over kmc}
&lt;/math&gt;

Just as the five-dimensional metric comprises the 4-D metric framed by the electromagnetic vector potential, the 5-dimensional stress-energy tensor comprises the 4-D stress-energy  tensor framed by the vector 4-current.

== Quantum interpretation of Klein ==
Kaluza's original hypothesis was purely classical and extended discoveries of general relativity. By the time of Klein's contribution, the discoveries of Heisenberg, Schrödinger, and de Broglie were receiving a lot of attention. Klein's ''Nature'' paper &lt;ref name="KN"/&gt; suggested that the fifth dimension is closed and periodic, and that the identification of electric charge with motion in the fifth dimension be interpreted as standing waves of wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda^5&lt;/math&gt;, much like the electrons around a nucleus in the Bohr model of the atom. The quantization of electric charge could then be nicely understood in terms of integer multiples of fifth-dimensional momentum. Combining the previous Kaluza result for &lt;math&gt;U^5&lt;/math&gt; in terms of electric charge, and a de Broglie relation for momentum &lt;math&gt;p^5 = h/\lambda^5&lt;/math&gt;, Klein &lt;ref name=KN /&gt; obtained an expression for the 0th mode of such waves:

:&lt;math&gt;
mU^5 =  {cq\over G^{1/2}} = {h\over \lambda^5} \qquad \Rightarrow \qquad  \lambda^5 \sim {hG^{1/2}\over cq}
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the Planck constant. Klein found &lt;math&gt;\lambda^5 \sim {\rm 10}^{-30}&lt;/math&gt; cm, and thereby an explanation for the cylinder condition in this small value.

Klein's ''Zeitschrift für Physik'' paper of the same year,&lt;ref name="KZ"/&gt; gave a more-detailed treatment that explicitly invoked the techniques of Schroedinger and de Broglie. It recapitulated much of the classical theory of Kaluza described above, and then departed into Klein's quantum interpretation. Klein solved a Schroedinger-like wave equation using an expansion in terms of fifth-dimensional waves resonating in the closed, compact fifth dimension.

== Group theory interpretation ==
[[Image:Kaluza Klein compactification.svg|frame|left|The space ''M'' × ''C'' is compactified over the compact set ''C'', and after Kaluza–Klein decomposition one has an [[effective field theory]] over M.]]
A splitting of [[fifth dimension (geometry)|five-dimensional]] [[spacetime]] into the [[Einstein equation]]s and Maxwell equations in four dimensions was first discovered by [[Gunnar Nordström]] in 1914, in the context of [[Nordström's theory of gravitation|his theory]] of gravity, but subsequently forgotten. Kaluza published his derivation in 1921 as an attempt to unify electromagnetism with Einstein's general relativity.

In 1926, Oskar Klein proposed that the fourth spatial dimension is curled up in a circle of a very small [[radius]], so that a [[Elementary particle|particle]] moving a short distance along that axis would return to where it began. The distance a particle can travel before reaching its initial position is said to be the size of the dimension. This extra dimension is a [[compact set]], and construction of this compact dimension is referred to as [[compactification (physics)|compactification]].

In modern geometry, the extra fifth dimension can be understood to be the [[circle group]] [[U(1)]], as [[electromagnetism]] can essentially be formulated as a [[gauge theory]] on a [[fiber bundle]], the [[circle bundle]], with [[gauge group]] U(1). In Kaluza–Klein theory this group suggests that gauge symmetry is the symmetry of circular compact dimensions.  Once this geometrical interpretation is understood, it is relatively straightforward to replace ''U''(1) by a general [[Lie group]].  Such generalizations are often called [[Yang–Mills theory|Yang–Mills theories]]. If a distinction is drawn, then it is that Yang–Mills theories occur on a flat space-time, whereas Kaluza–Klein treats the more general case of curved spacetime. The base space of Kaluza–Klein theory need not be four-dimensional space-time; it can be any ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]])[[Riemannian manifold]], or even a [[supersymmetry|supersymmetric]] manifold or [[orbifold]] or even a [[noncommutative space]].

The construction can be outlined, roughly, as follows.&lt;ref&gt;David Bleecker, "[https://zulfahmed.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/88623149-bleecker-d-gauge-theory-and-variational-principles-aw-1981-ka-t-201s-pqgf.pdf Gauge Theory and Variational Principles]" (1982) D. Reidel Publishing ''(See chapter 9'')&lt;/ref&gt; One starts by considering a [[principal fiber bundle]] ''P'' with [[gauge group]] ''G'' over a [[manifold]] M. Given a [[connection (fibred manifold)|connection]] on the bundle, and a [[metric tensor|metric]] on the base manifold, and a gauge invariant metric on the tangent of each fiber, one can construct a [[metric (vector bundle)|bundle metric]] defined on the entire bundle. Computing the [[scalar curvature]] of this bundle metric, one finds that it is constant on each fiber: this is the "Kaluza miracle". One did not have to explicitly impose a cylinder condition, or to compactify: by assumption, the gauge group is already compact. Next, one takes this scalar curvature as the [[Lagrangian density]], and, from this, constructs the [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] for the bundle, as a whole.  The equations of motion, the [[Euler–Lagrange equations]], can be then obtained by considering where the action is [[stationary state|stationary]] with respect to variations of either the metric on the base manifold, or of the gauge connection.  Variations with respect to the base metric gives the [[Einstein field equations]] on the base manifold, with the [[energy-momentum tensor]] given by the [[curvature form|curvature]] ([[field strength]]) of the gauge connection. On the flip side, the action is stationary against variations of the gauge connection precisely when the gauge connection solves the [[Yang-Mills equation]]s. Thus, by applying a single idea: the [[principle of least action]], to a single quantity: the scalar curvature on the bundle (as a whole), one obtains simultaneously all of the needed field equations, for both the space-time and the gauge field.

As an approach to the unification of the forces, it is straightforward to apply the Kaluza–Klein theory in an attempt to unify gravity with the [[strong force|strong]] and [[electroweak]] forces by using the symmetry group of the [[Standard Model]], [[SU(3)]] × [[SU(2)]] × [[U(1)]]. However, an attempt to convert this interesting geometrical construction into a bona-fide model of reality flounders on a number of issues, including the fact that the [[fermion]]s must be introduced in an artificial way (in nonsupersymmetric models). Nonetheless, KK remains an important [[Touchstone (metaphor)|touchstone]] in theoretical physics and is often embedded in more sophisticated theories. It is studied in its own right as an object of geometric interest in [[K-theory]].

Even in the absence of a completely satisfying theoretical physics framework, the idea of exploring extra, compactified, dimensions is of considerable interest in the [[experimental physics]] and [[astrophysics]] communities. A variety of predictions, with real experimental consequences, can be made (in the case of [[large extra dimension]]s and [[warped model]]s). For example, on the simplest of principles, one might expect to have [[standing wave]]s in the extra compactified dimension(s). If a spatial extra dimension is of radius ''R'', the invariant  [[mass]] of such  standing waves would be ''M''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''nh''/''Rc'' with ''n'' an [[integer]], ''h'' being [[Planck's constant]] and ''c'' the [[speed of light]]. This set of possible mass values is often called the '''Kaluza–Klein tower'''.  Similarly, in [[Thermal quantum field theory]] a compactification of the euclidean time dimension leads to the [[Matsubara frequency|Matsubara frequencies]] and thus to a discretized thermal energy spectrum.

However, Klein's approach to a quantum theory is flawed{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} and, for example, leads to a calculated electron mass in the order of magnitude of the [[Planck mass]] &lt;ref&gt; Ravndal,F., Oskar Klein and the fifth dimension, arXiv:1309.4113 [physics.hist-ph] &lt;/ref&gt;.

Examples of experimental pursuits include work by the [[Collider Detector at Fermilab|CDF]] collaboration, which has re-analyzed [[particle collider]] data for the signature of effects associated with large extra dimensions/[[warped model]]s.

Brandenberger and Vafa have speculated that in the early universe, [[cosmic inflation]] causes three of the space dimensions to expand to cosmological size while the remaining dimensions of space remained microscopic.

== Space–time–matter theory ==
One particular variant of Kaluza–Klein theory is '''space–time–matter theory''' or '''induced matter theory''', chiefly promulgated by [[Paul S. Wesson|Paul Wesson]] and other members of the Space–Time–Matter Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://5dstm.org 5Dstm.org]&lt;/ref&gt; In this version of the theory, it is noted that solutions to the equation

:&lt;math&gt;\widetilde{R}_{ab}=0&lt;/math&gt;

may be re-expressed so that in four dimensions, these solutions satisfy [[Einstein's equation]]s

:&lt;math&gt;G_{\mu\nu} = 8\pi T_{\mu\nu}\,&lt;/math&gt;

with the precise form of the ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''μν''&lt;/sub&gt; following from the [[Ricci-flat condition]] on the five-dimensional space. In other words, the cylinder condition of the previous development is dropped, and the stress–energy now comes from the derivatives of the 5D metric with respect to the fifth coordinate. Because the [[energy–momentum tensor]] is normally understood to be due to concentrations of matter in four-dimensional space, the above result is interpreted as saying that four-dimensional matter is induced from geometry in five-dimensional space.

In particular, the [[soliton]] solutions of &lt;math&gt;\widetilde{R}_{ab}=0&lt;/math&gt; can be shown to contain the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] in both radiation-dominated (early universe) and matter-dominated (later universe) forms.  The general equations can be shown to be sufficiently consistent with classical [[tests of general relativity]] to be acceptable on physical principles, while still leaving considerable freedom to also provide interesting [[cosmological model]]s.

== Geometric interpretation ==
The Kaluza–Klein theory has a particularly elegant presentation in terms of geometry. In a certain sense, it looks just like ordinary gravity in [[free space]], except that it is phrased in five dimensions instead of four.

=== Einstein equations ===
The equations governing ordinary gravity in free space can be obtained from an [[action (physics)|action]], by applying the [[variational principle]] to a certain [[action (physics)|action]]. Let ''M'' be a ([[pseudo-Riemannian manifold|pseudo-]])[[Riemannian manifold]], which may be taken as the [[spacetime]] of [[general relativity]]. If ''g'' is the [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] on this manifold, one defines the [[action (physics)|action]] ''S''(''g'') as

:&lt;math&gt;S(g)=\int_M R(g) \mathrm{vol}(g)\,&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R''(''g'') is the [[scalar curvature]] and vol(''g'') is the [[volume element]].  By applying the [[variational principle]] to the action

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta S(g)}{\delta g} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

one obtains precisely the [[Einstein equation]]s for free space:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{ij} - \frac{1}{2}g_{ij}R = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Here, ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Ricci tensor]].

=== Maxwell equations ===
By contrast, the [[Maxwell equation]]s describing [[electromagnetism]] can be understood to be the [[de Rham cohomology|Hodge equations]] of a [[principal bundle|principal U(1)-bundle]] or [[circle bundle]] π: ''P'' → ''M'' with fiber [[U(1)]].  That is, the [[electromagnetic field]] ''F'' is a [[harmonic form|harmonic 2-form]] in the space Ω&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'') of differentiable [[2-form]]s on the manifold ''M''. In the absence of charges and currents, the free-field Maxwell equations are

:d''F'' = 0 and d*''F'' = 0.

where * is the [[Hodge star]].

=== Kaluza–Klein geometry ===
To build the Kaluza–Klein theory, one picks an invariant metric on the circle '''S'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; that is the fiber of the U(1)-bundle of electromagnetism. In this discussion, an ''invariant metric'' is simply one that is invariant under rotations of the circle. Suppose this metric gives the circle a total length of Λ. One then considers metrics &lt;math&gt;\widehat{g}&lt;/math&gt; on the bundle ''P'' that are consistent with both the fiber metric, and the metric on the underlying manifold ''M''.  The consistency conditions are:
* The projection of &lt;math&gt;\widehat{g}&lt;/math&gt; to the [[vertical bundle|vertical subspace]] &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Vert}_pP \subset T_pP&lt;/math&gt; needs to agree with metric on the fiber over a point in the manifold ''M''.
* The projection of &lt;math&gt;\widehat{g}&lt;/math&gt; to the [[horizontal bundle|horizontal subspace]] &lt;math&gt;\mbox{Hor}_pP \subset T_pP&lt;/math&gt; of the [[tangent space]] at point ''p'' ∈ ''P'' must be isomorphic to the metric ''g'' on ''M'' at π(''p'').

The Kaluza–Klein action for such a metric is given by

:&lt;math&gt;S(\widehat{g})=\int_P R(\widehat{g}) \;\mbox{vol}(\widehat{g})\,&lt;/math&gt;

The scalar curvature, written in components, then expands to

:&lt;math&gt;R(\widehat{g}) = \pi^*\left( R(g) - \frac{\Lambda^2}{2} \vert F \vert^2\right)&lt;/math&gt;

where π* is the [[pullback (differential geometry)|pullback]] of the fiber bundle projection π: ''P'' → ''M''. The connection ''A'' on the fiber bundle is related to the electromagnetic field strength as

:&lt;math&gt;\pi^*F = \mathrm{d}A&lt;/math&gt;

That there always exists such a connection, even for fiber bundles of arbitrarily complex topology, is a result from [[homology (mathematics)|homology]] and specifically, [[K-theory]]. Applying [[Fubini's theorem]] and integrating on the fiber, one gets

:&lt;math&gt;S(\widehat{g})=\Lambda \int_M \left( R(g) - \frac{1}{\Lambda^2} \vert F \vert^2  \right) \;\mbox{vol}(g) &lt;/math&gt;

Varying the action with respect to the component ''A'', one regains the Maxwell equations.  Applying the variational principle to the base metric ''g'', one gets the Einstein equations

:&lt;math&gt;R_{ij} - \frac{1}{2}g_{ij}R = \frac{1}{\Lambda^2} T_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

with the [[stress–energy tensor]] being given by

:&lt;math&gt;T^{ij} = F^{ik}F^{jl}g_{kl}
- \frac{1}{4}g^{ij} \vert F \vert^2,&lt;/math&gt;

sometimes called the [[Maxwell stress tensor]].

The original theory identifies Λ with the fiber metric ''g''&lt;sub&gt;55&lt;/sub&gt;, and allows Λ to vary from fiber to fiber.  In this case, the coupling between gravity and the electromagnetic field is not constant, but has its own dynamical field, the [[Radion (physics)|radion]].

=== Generalizations ===
In the above, the size of the loop Λ acts as a coupling constant between the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field.  If the base manifold is four-dimensional, the Kaluza–Klein manifold ''P'' is  five-dimensional. The fifth dimension is a [[compact space]], and is called the '''compact dimension'''.  The technique of introducing compact dimensions to obtain a higher-dimensional manifold is referred to as [[compactification (physics)|compactification]]. Compactification does not produce group actions on chiral fermions except in very specific cases: the dimension of the total space must be 2 mod 8 and the G-index of the Dirac operator of the compact space must be nonzero.&lt;ref&gt;L. Castellani et al., Supergravity and superstrings, Vol 2, chapter V.11&lt;/ref&gt;

The above development generalizes in a more-or-less straightforward fashion to general [[principal G-bundle|principal ''G''-bundles]] for some arbitrary [[Lie group]] ''G'' taking the place of [[U(1)]].  In such a case, the theory is often referred to as a [[Yang–Mills theory]], and is sometimes taken to be synonymous.  If the underlying manifold is [[supersymmetric]], the resulting theory is a super-symmetric Yang–Mills theory.

==Empirical tests==
No experimental or observational signs of extra dimensions have been officially reported. Many theoretical search techniques for detecting Kaluza–Klein resonances have been proposed using the mass couplings of such resonances with the [[top quark]]. However, until the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) reaches full operational power, observation of such resonances are unlikely. An analysis of results from the LHC in December 2010 severely constrains theories with [[large extra dimensions]].&lt;ref name="arxiv.org 1"&gt;CMS Collaboration, "Search for Microscopic Black Hole Signatures at the Large Hadron Collider", https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.3375&lt;/ref&gt;

The observation of a [[Higgs boson|Higgs]]-like boson at the LHC establishes a new empirical test which can be applied to the search for Kaluza–Klein resonances and supersymmetric particles.
The loop [[Feynman diagram]]s that exist in the Higgs interactions allow any particle with electric charge and mass to run in such a loop. Standard Model particles besides the [[top quark]] and [[W and Z bosons|W boson]] do not make big contributions to the cross-section observed in the H → γγ decay, but if there are new particles beyond the Standard Model, they could potentially change the ratio of the predicted Standard Model H → γγ cross-section to the experimentally observed cross-section. Hence a measurement of any dramatic change to the H → γγ cross section predicted by the Standard Model is crucial in probing the physics beyond it.

Another more recent paper from July 2018&lt;ref name="arxiv.org 2"&gt;Limits on the number of spacetime dimensions from [[GW170817]], https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.08160&lt;/ref&gt; does bode some hope for this theory; In the paper they dispute that gravity is leaking into higher dimensions as in brane theory.  However the paper does demonstrate that EM and Gravity share the same number of dimensions and this fact lends support to Kaluza–Klein theory, whether the number of dimensions is really 3+1 or in fact 4+1 is the subject of further debate.

According to legend, the [[Gautama Buddha]]  visited [[Dhanyawadi]], the capital city of Arakan during his travels on a [[Proselytization]] mission to spread Buddhism.&lt;ref name="Daw"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Buddhist art of ancient Arakan: an eastern border state beyond ancient India, east of Vanga and Samatata|publisher=Volume 43, Issue 4 of Burmese cultural microfilm collection, Daw Saw Saw|year=1979|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 26th anniversary of the King at the time, a devout Buddhist, the Buddha accompanied by Shin Ananda and 500 disciples&lt;ref name="Daw"/&gt; landed at Salagiri mountain peak near Khaukrah town.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"&gt;Schober, p.267&lt;/ref&gt; The King of Arakan, along with his Chief Queen Sandra Mala (with her retinue of 1,600 ladies in waiting), and an entourage of ministers, generals and officials, paid homage to the Buddha.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; They were deeply moved by his teachings and upon his departure to Thawuthi ([[Sravasti]]), the King insisted that he leave his image for people to worship.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; For this purpose, the Buddha then sat under a [[Bodhi tree]] for a week of meditation.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; During this time [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Sakka]] (in [[Pāli]], the ruler of the [[Trāyastriṃśa]] Heaven in [[Buddhist cosmology]], supported by his assistant Vissakamma, moulded a lifelike image of the Buddha using ornaments donated by the king and his people.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; It is also said that Sakka and Vissakamma (or Vishvakarman) created a separate pavilion for the Buddha to live and enjoy during these seven days.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt; After looking at his own lifelike image, believed at the time to have been his only true-likeness,&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, p.32&lt;/ref&gt; Buddha was pleased and "imbued the image with his spiritual essence", or "enlivened and consecrated" the image, naming it "Candasara".&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt; He also stated that the image would last for five thousand years as his representative.&lt;ref name=legend/&gt;&lt;ref name=Aung&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aung |first=Myo|author2=H.Kraft|title= Upper Myanmar Mandalay Pyin Oo Lwin Sagaing Monywa Mingun Mogok Shwebo|work=Mahamuni Buddha|pages=4–5|accessdate=2010-03-24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zt2T_QO6OtAC&amp;pg=PT2&amp;dq=Mahamuni+Buddha+Pagoda,+Mandalay&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Sr-pS7C2INKfrAf25dGmAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CGcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true|publisher= Books on Asia|isbn=9789749290859}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.268"&gt;Schober, p.268&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian Juliane Schober has very succinctly explained this legend and the cult worship that has evolved around the "living" double image of Mahamuni Buddha:
{{clear}}
{{quotation|The rich and complex mythology associated with this image includes episodes that parallel other stories about the Buddha...The rituals and myths of Mahamuni thus accomplish two aims simultaneously: they place local contexts and actors within a universal Buddhist cosmology, and they locate a continuing biography of the Buddha in the Buddhist politics of Arakan and Upper Burma. [[Theravada]] politics characteristically extended the biographical mode of recreating the Buddha's presence and associated with it the power of kings and other patrons of this image. The veneration of this Buddha image is thus informed by local conceptions of religious patronage in sociopolitical domains.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.260"&gt;Schober, p.260&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Buddha in Sarnath Museum (Dhammajak Mutra).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Gautama Buddha]]]]
Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle relates to the nine phenomena that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; the water from the tank that was used for washing the Buddha's head would retain its quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt in the direction of the Buddha image; birds would not fly over the temple; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.269"&gt;Schober, p.269&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|left|The large bronze statues.jpg|160|The large Bronze Figures.jpg|175|Left: Large bronze statues believed to have healing powers when rubbed. Right: [[Airavata]]–Three headed Elephant and other statues of [[Shiva]].}}
Another legend narrated is linked to the six [[Cambodia|Khmer]] bronze statues (three lions–with heads substituted later in Burmese style, a three-headed elephant known as [[Airavata]], and two warriors in the form of [[Shiva]]), which are installed in the temple in the northern end of the courtyard. These statues were originally at the [[Angkor Wat]] temple complex in [[Cambodia]].&lt;ref name= "Abbott, p.33"&gt;Abbott, p.33&lt;/ref&gt; Devotees believe that the statues have healing qualities to rub a particular part of the body against the statues to cure themselves of various ailments and diseases.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt;&lt;ref name=legend/&gt;

===Image history===

[[File:Prince Thado Minsaw.JPG|thumb|left|[[Thado Minsaw]], Crown Prince and son of [[Bodawpaya]] carried off the Mahamuni to Mandalay.]]

In the ancient history of Arakan, King [[Anawratha]] of [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan]] (r. 1044–1077) attempted to move the image to [[Bagan|Pagan]], without success.&lt;ref name= "Schober p.260"&gt;Schober p.260&lt;/ref&gt; In 1784, the [[Bamar|Burmese]] under the military leadership of Crown Prince [[Thado Minsaw]] of [[Konbaung dynasty]] conquered the Kingdom of [[Mrauk U]].&lt;ref name=rlf-109&gt;{{cite book | title=The River of Lost Footsteps--Histories of Burma | author=Thant Myint-U | pages=109–110 | year=2006 | publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux | isbn=978-0-374-16342-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The religious relics of the kingdom, including the Mahamuni Buddha image, were confiscated and installed in the Mahamuni temple or Pagoda at [[Amarapura]], on the outskirts of the old capital of Mandalay. As the Mahamuni image was too large to transport as a whole, it was cut into sections and later reassembled and housed in the new temple.&lt;ref name= "Schober p.266"&gt;Schober p.266&lt;/ref&gt;  Mandalay became the capital under King [[Mindon Min|Min]]don (r. 1853–1878).&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, p.685&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the capital under his son [[Thibaw Min|Thibaw]] (r. 1878–1885) of the [[Konbaung Dynasty]] (1752–1885). When the British annexed Upper Burma in 1885 to prevent the French from dominating it, monarchic rule ended.&lt;ref&gt;Shulman, p.84&lt;/ref&gt; However, veneration of the Mahamuni image has continued, and is visited and idolised by many pilgrims, mainly [[Rakhine people|Rakhine]], [[Mon people|Mon]] and [[Bamar|Burmans]] peoples.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.260-261"&gt;Schober, p.260-261&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fink&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fink|first=Christina|title= Living silence: Burma under military rule

Several old bronze statues that line the courtyard of the temple have a long history as war loot. They were originally [[Khmer architecture|Khmer statues]], found at [[Angkor Wat]] in [[Cambodia]], and were taken to [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] in 1431 by the [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Siamese]].&lt;ref name= "Abbott, p.33"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vella, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "Greenwood, p.128"&gt;Greenwood, p.128&lt;/ref&gt; In 1564, the Burmese king [[Bayinnaung]] conquered Ayutthaya and took thirty such statues to [[Bago, Burma|Bago]] (Pegu).&lt;ref name= "Greenwood, p.128"/&gt;&lt;ref name=geh&gt;{{cite book | last=Harvey | first=G.E. | title=History of Burma | page=168 | chapter=Toungoo Dynasty: IIIrd Siege of Ayuthia | year=1925 | publisher=Frank Cass &amp; Co.

They are a major attraction because of their purported healing qualities.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt;

===Damage===
[[File:Mahamuni.JPG|right|thumb|A statue of Maha Muni Buddha or Maha Myat Muni Paya or Rakhine Paya or Payagyi enshrined in a temple/pagoda at [[Mandalay]].]]
The Mahamnuni image and its precincts suffered damage from fires in 1879 and 1884.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"&gt;Schober, p.263&lt;/ref&gt; In the fire that broke out during the reign of King Thibaw, the seven-tiered spire on the brick temple, devotional halls, causeways and others were burnt down, although the Great Image itself was saved. Gold recovered after the fire was made into a robe that currently adorns the image. In 1887, Minister [[Kinwun Mingyi U Kaung]] took charge of the site and in 1896 constructed the present temple around the original shrine built by King Bodawpaya.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;

In 1996, the [[State Law and Order Restoration Council|military rulers]] in Burma undertook renovation work on the Mahamuni Pagoda. During this period, the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared in the belly of the Great Image.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"&gt;Fink, p.219&lt;/ref&gt; It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night, resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; Whilst the meeting was in progress, attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not been raped at all.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt; However, the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all.&lt;ref name="Fink, p.219"/&gt;

==Architecture==

===Main Temple/Pagoda===
{{double image|right|Mahamuni Pagoda.jpg|205|Freshly painted - Maha Muni.jpg|230|Mahamuni pagoda}}
The Mahamuni Temple or Pagoda is a complex of structures located along a road from Mandalay leading to the southwest. It was originally located on A brick paved road which was constructed from the Royal Palace of King [[Bodawpaya]] to the eastern gate of the temple, although only remnants of this road can still be seen.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt; A major teaching monastery of some 400 monks of the [[Thudhamma Nikaya]] (order), is one among the many monasteries which are adjacent to the Pagoda. The temple has a central shrine and is framed by an extensive grass lawn. The arcades leading to the main shrine have many kiosks, selling religious paraphernalia such as incense, candles, rosaries, flowers, robes, sandals etc., and various restaurants and tea shops. The [[sanctum sanctorum]], where the large Mahamuni image is deified, is a small chamber and has a roof covering made up of seven ''[[pyatthat]]'' meaning tiered roofs (derivative of the [[Sanskrit Language|Sanskrit]] word ''prasada'').&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt;&lt;ref name=palace&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=619905|title=The Reconstruction of  Mandalay Palace: An Itermi Report on Aspects of Design|publisher=|quote=...epitomized by tiered roofs, the ''pya-that'' found in both royal and religious architecture. It comes from the Sanskrit ''prasada'', a palatial building often with multiple roofs.|volume=56|pages=335–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceiling has an ornate mosaic covering. The arcades are supported by 252 gilded and carved columns adorned with fine frescoes.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"/&gt;

}}
The Mahamuni Buddha image is housed in a  small chamber, seated on a throne in a divine posture known as the ''Bhumisparsa [[Mudra]]''. This posture or mudra symbolises Buddha's vanquishing of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]). The legs are crossed with feet turned inwards, and the right hand touches the ground ritualistically, as a witness of his past deeds.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt; The image is cast in [[bronze]] and weighs 6.5 tonnes and is erected on a {{convert|1.84|m|ft}} high pedestal and reaches a height  of {{convert|3.82|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt; Its shoulders measure {{convert|1.84|m|ft}} and its waist measures {{convert|2.9|m|ft}}.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt; It is draped in royal costumes with "Brahmanic cords (''[[salwe]]'') and regalia crossing his chest".&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt; The image is crowned, bejewelled with [[diamond]]s, [[Ruby|rubies]] and [[sapphire]]s. The left hand appears imprecise, unusually large, and is seen resting in the lap with an upturned palm.

[[Gold leaf|Gold leaves]] are regularly applied to the face of the Mahamuni Buddha by male devotees. Consequent to the frequent application of gold leaves, the coating of gold (thickness {{convert|15|cm|in}}) has given a shapeless contour to the Mahamuni image. However, it is also noted that the right hand, crown and other iconographic characteristics of royalty are free of gold leaf covering, which gives an impression that these were later additions to the original image of the Mahamuni.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name=Mara/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pagoda&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myokyawhtun.com/photo-gallery/mahamuni-buddha.html|title=Mahamuni Pagoda|accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, when the pagoda was burnt down, {{convert|91|kg|lbs}} of gold was recovered from the site, which represents the continued historical veneration and perpetuation of the cult of Mahamuni.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"&gt;Schober, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other features===
[[File:Sacred fish pond @ Maha Muni.jpg|thumb|left| Sacred fish and tortoise pond near the Mahamuni Pagoda.]]
A large number of 'inscription stones' collected by King Bodawpaya are seen in a long gallery in the southeastern corner of the temple courtyard. These inscriptions, some of which are made from gilded marble and sandstone, have been collected from many regions of the country.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= Keown/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pagoda/&gt; There is also a large water tank in the southeast direction of the temple where fish and turtles are fed with [[rice cake]]s by the large number of pilgrims who visit the temple every day.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"&gt;Schober, p.267&lt;/ref&gt; Adjacent to the Buddha temple is the Mahamuni Museum, which contains displays of Buddhism throughout [[Asia]].

==Daily rituals==
{{double image|right|Mahamuni Buddha (1).jpg|200|Mahamuni Buddha (2).jpg|200|Left: Early morning ritual of face wash to Mahamuni Buddha. Right: Early morning brushing the teeth of Mahamuni Buddha.}}
On February 17, 1988, the present Ven Sayadaw Buddhanta Panya Vamsa of [[Htilin Monastery]] and Pitaka Kyaung initiated the ritual of daily face washing of the deity at dawn. This ritual commences every morning at 4 am or 4:30 am when [[monks]] wash the face and brush the teeth of the Buddha image.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt; It is an elaborate ritual performed for over an hour by a senior monk dressed in monastic attire, assisted by several lay helpers, dressed in white and wearing formal headdress. As soon as the drums are struck, the senior monk residing in the adjoining monastery enters the sanctum and starts the formal face washing ritual with a succession of fresh towels, offered by devotees. He then performs the act of cleaning the Mahamuni's teeth with a large brush followed by one more sequence of cleaning with fresh towels.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.263"/&gt; After this, [[sandalwood]] paste is applied to the image and it is again cleaned with towels and finally sprinkled with scented water. After the ceremony is completed, the used towels are returned to the devotees who keep these towels with reverence in their home shrines.&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;

On special occasions, such as [[Uposatha]] day, an orange stole is placed around its shoulders by the presiding monk and is fanned.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.264"&gt;Schober, p.264&lt;/ref&gt; A major congregation of devotees witness the rituals; some men sit in the front enclosure while others including women and children sit in the middle and rear end of the foyer. Devotees offer food and other items brought by them on a tray to the deity and chant prayers while the rituals are being performed.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt; During the winter season, the image is covered by a cloak of the monastic order.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.264"/&gt;

During the reign of Burmese monarchs, offerings were made daily to the Great Image in a formal way. Food and other offerings, sheltered by a Royal white umbrella, were taken in a procession from the palace, escorted by a Minister, as an honour due to a sovereign head of the state.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.267"&gt;Schober, p.267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Aung/&gt;

==Festival==
A major annual [[pagoda festival]] known as the 'Mahamuni Paya Pwe' ('pwe' meaning "festival") is held in early February, at the end of the [[Vassa|Buddhist Lent]] to celebrate the history of the pagoda. During this festival, aside from the daily rituals,  the ''[[Patthana]]'' from a "Book of Conditional Relations" is recited.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.272"&gt;Schober, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; This book is a philosophical text which Buddha recounted to his mother in a sermon in ''[[Tavatimsa]]'' heaven and is a sacred scripture in the [[Pali language]].&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.272"&gt;Schober, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; The Pattana recitation is a special feature, which continues for several days. Monks recite from the scriptures, in groups of two or three. The festivities also include various forms of entertainment programmes such as dance, music, theatre etc., and there is also a social event, allowing families and friends gather to greet each other.&lt;ref name= "Schober, p.272"&gt;Schober, p.272&lt;/ref&gt; Given that large crowds of pilgrims are attracted during the festive season, guards are posted near the Great Image and video cameras are placed in many parts of the temple precincts to protect it.&lt;ref name= Reid/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11594">'''Mediterranean Editors and Translators''' ('''MET''') is a non-profit, interdisciplinary association for [[language professional]]s who work mainly with or into English within the Mediterranean area. The association's members include [[translators]], [[authors' editor]]s, [[copy editors]], writing and presentation coaches, teachers of [[academic writing]], applied linguists, interpreters, professional writers and more. MET offers training workshops, an annual conference, networking and other opportunities of continuing professional development for its members. The activities of the association are guided by six objectives, summarized as follows:

# Maintain a stable network and means to hold events for English language consultants 
# Communicate knowledge that can contribute to improving the quality of language support services available in the Mediterranean 
# Be a conduit for exchanging information between language consultants in our geographic area and those in other parts of Europe and the world 
# Stimulate research in Mediterranean communities on the needs of academics, scientists and others and on promising practices that meet their needs well 
# Identify local expertise in language support and help our experts share their knowledge with a wider audience 
# Help users of language support services locate appropriate solutions to their needs and promote mutual understanding between suppliers and users of these services

== History and organization ==
MET was founded in Barcelona, Spain, in the spring of 2006 after an initial, exploratory meeting the preceding autumn. It is registered in the [[Generalitat de Catalunya]] and has a legally binding charter (written in [[Catalan language|Catalan]] but translated into English). Its activities are directed by a Governing Council. The council, elected every two years, is composed of council chair and vice-chair, secretary, treasurer, officers for membership, continuing professional development and promotion, and a webmaster.

MET is a member of the VERTICE network of Spanish associations of translators, interpreters and editors, and of the Spanish Network of the [[Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialogue Between Cultures|Anna Lindh Euro-Mediterranean Foundation for the Dialog Between Cultures]]. It also maintains relationships with the Society for Editors and Proofreaders (SfEP), [[European Association of Science Editors]] (EASE), SENSE (based in the Netherlands), Eastern Mediterranean Association of Medical Editors (EMAME), Associazione Italiana Traduttori e Interpreti (AITI), APTIC (association of translators and interpreters in Catalunya), and Nordic Editors and Translators (NEaT). The founding of NEaT was inspired by, and based on information from, MET.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Juhola|first1=Virve|last2=Uusinarkaus|first2=Julie|title=Nordic Editors and Translators: founding a new networking and peer-training association (with thanks to MET)|url=http://www.metmeetings.org/en/neat:774|website=www.metmeetings.org|accessdate=3 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; MET and all these "sister associations" support each other to further the development of the language profession.

== Members and membership ==

MET's members are mostly based in the Mediterranean region and elsewhere in Europe, but some members from further away join because of their shared interests. MET has both individual and institutional members.

MET's more than 300 individual members hail from about 25 countries in Europe, North America, Asia, Africa, Australia and Canada (data of August 2017). They are employed in freelance, entrepreneurial and institutional settings and work in a wide range of subject areas including science, technology, engineering, medicine, business, commerce, finance, law, politics, art and other cultural areas. Because of the association's focus on communication in the English language, many members originate from countries where English is the vernacular.

MET’s institutional membership is a way for institutions and companies to access continuing professional development activities for their staff and to support the association’s mission. Currently there are about 10 institutional members.

== Conferences ==
MET holds a conference every year, usually in early autumn. This is also the occasion for the general assembly of the members. Conferences tend to last 1.5 days and are preceded by two half-days of training workshops. Each “MET meeting” is named with the acronym of METM followed by the last two digits of the year. For example, METM18 is the name given to next year's meeting, to be held on 4-6 October 2018 in [[Girona]], Spain.

== Workshop program ==
MET organizes a workshop day every spring. A full day of workshops is also offered prior to the annual conference. The workshops are usually developed and delivered by MET members and offer continuing professional development for editors and translators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Coveney|first1=Kymm|title=Mediterranean Editors and Translators: All About Editing|url=http://blog.sfep.org.uk/editing-translators/|website=SfEP blog|accessdate=18 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The topics dealt with include knowledge updates in specialized fields, language issues, tools for language professionals, and business development.

== Publications ==
MET members have written a guide entitled "The English-Language Consultant: MET’s guidelines for choosing an editor, translator, interpreter or other language service provider"; the second, revised edition is available on the association's website. 

Discussions at two MET conferences have led to the publication of multiauthor, edited volumes about academic writing. In 2013, a limited group of MET members and their colleagues published the edited volume ''Supporting Research Writing: Roles and challenges in multilingual settings''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supporting Research Writing: Roles and challenges in multilingual settings|year=2013|publisher=Chandos|location=Oxford|isbn=1 84334 666 4|editor=Matarese, Valerie|url=https://www.elsevier.com/books/supporting-research-writing/matarese/978-1-84334-666-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; (based on a panel discussion at METM09). In 2017, another group of members, invited speakers and colleagues published the edited volume ''Publishing Research in English as an Additional Language: Practices, pathways and potentials''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Cargill|editor1-first=Margaret|editor2-last=Burgess|editor2-first=Sally|title=Publishing Research in English as an Additional Language: Practices, pathways and potentials|date=2017|publisher=University of Adelaide Press|isbn=978-1-925261-52-3|url=https://www.adelaide.edu.au/press/titles/english-pathways/|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (based on talks presented at METM15; free e-book).

Additional publications by MET members related to the annual conferences, including reviews of the meetings and papers based on the presentations, are listed on the association's website.

'''''Memories with Maya''''' is a [[hard science fiction]] novel by the author Clyde Dsouza. It has been received well by the [[transhumanism]] and the science community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/book-review-memories-with-maya |title=book review &amp;#124; Memories with Maya |publisher=KurzweilAI |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The novel looks at how [[augmented reality]] and [[artificial intelligence|AI]] will merge to augment human beings in ways that will affect emotions, intimate human relationships, and our evolution as a species.

==Plot==
The story is a first person narrative told through the eyes of [[protagonist]] Daniel (Dan). Dan lives life on his own terms, convinced that he can hack his destiny through the use of technology to better his condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://io9.com/in-memories-with-maya-human-sexuality-gets-an-upgrade-1172882567 |title=In Memories with Maya, human sexuality gets an upgrade |publisher=Io9.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes that prayer is panacea for the weak and he can steer the course of his life through the use of logic, technology and science.

With his close friend Krish, they merge [[artificial intelligence]] and [[augmented reality]] technology to create the ''Wizer'', a [[smartglasses|wearable visor]] much like [[Google Glass]] but powered by [[artificial general intelligence]]. The Wizer plays a key role in advancing the story and has uses in entertainment, sports, and even [[cyber sex]] via ''Dirrogates'' (a portmanteau of the words Digital and Surrogate, invented by the author)

Mid way through the story a dark side of ''Wizer'' technology and augmented reality comes to the front, with a major tragedy occurring in a nightclub. It changes the course of Dan and Krish's life. Dan experiences a loss that challenges him in no uncertain terms to prove he is capable of hacking his destiny. He faces internal turmoil, battling moral and ethical issues to emerge a [[transhuman]], both in mind and body.

==Reception==
The novel has received praise by science fiction reviewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hardsf.org/HSFRMemo.htm |title=Review - Memories With Maya by Clyde DeSouza |publisher=Hard SF |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924024935/http://www.hardsf.org/HSFRMemo.htm |archivedate=2015-09-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] has featured the novel on their list of publications &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/publications#books |title=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies: Publications |publisher=Ieet.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professionals and science fiction enthusiasts, have said the novel has more than [[hard science fiction]] in its pages, and some reviewers say they were touched on an emotional level as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tedhowardnz.wordpress.com/2013/06/09/book-review-memories-with-maya/ |title=Book review – Memories with Maya &amp;#124; Ted Howard NZ's Blog |publisher=Tedhowardnz.wordpress.com |date=2013-06-09 |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A writer for the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|IEET]] wrote an essay titled: ''Till Death do us part - The ethics and evolution of human relationships''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/nickence20130904 |title=Till Death do us part - The ethics and evolution of human relationships |publisher=Ieet.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; that interprets the reach of the technology described in the book and its effect on human relationships, even after death.

{{Linguistics}}
'''Metalinguistics''' is the branch of [[linguistics]] that studies [[language]] and its relationship to other [[culture|cultural behavior]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}{{dubious|date=December 2014}} It is the study of dialogue relationships between units of speech communication as manifestations and enactments of co-existence.{{clarify|date=January 2013}} [[Jacob L. Mey]] in his book, ''Trends in Linguistics'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cpfyF9W6xiMC&amp;pg=PA354&amp;dq=metalinguistics&amp;ei=qb2wS6j8Ho20MN3eraYM&amp;cd=9#v=onepage&amp;q=metalinguistics&amp;f=false |title=When Voices Clash: A Study in Literary Pragmatics|author=Jacob L. Mey |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes [[Mikhail Bakhtin]]'s interpretation of metalinguistics as "encompassing the life history of a speech community, with an orientation toward a study of large events in the speech life of people and embody changes in various cultures and ages."


==Definitions==

Jean-Émile Gombert, teaching genetic psychology at Dijon University, France, states that one thing is to find an adequate way to treat the comprehension and the production of language, and another is to successfully adopt a reflexive attitude regarding the language objects and their manipulation. This is the second time that a psycholinguistic tradition recently developed has been given the name metalinguistics.

The linguist Noam Chomsky defines the field of metalinguistics as the subject knowledge of the characteristics and the operation of language or, from a more functionalist perspective, of its structure, its operation and its use. The relevant psychological description cannot be based on abstraction, it requires that the researchers and theorists widen their scopes till the point they can embrace the importance of the behavioural actions in the cognitive context of the subjects that realise them. The French linguist [[Jules Gilliéron]] wrote that ''All consciousness is necessarily 'meta' from the vantage point of the beholder, as it is not based on the real, but on its intelligibility of the real''.

==Literacy development==
Metalinguistic skills involve amplified and logical understanding of the rules used to govern language. Scholar Patrick Hartwell points out how substantial it is for students to develop these capabilities, especially heightened [[phonological awareness]], which is a key precursor to literacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/376562|title=Grammar, Grammars, and the Teaching of Grammar|author=Patrick Hartwell|publisher=College English|volume=47|date=February 1985|pages=105–127|accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An essential aspect to language development is focused on the student being aware of language and the components of language.

This idea is also examined in the article, 'Metalinguistic Awareness and Literacy Acquisition in Different Languages',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED391147&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED391147 |title=Metalinguistic Awareness and Literacy Acquisition in Different Languages. Technical Report No. 618|author1=Nagy, William E.|author2=Anderson, Richard C.|publisher=Eric.ed.gov |date=1964-05-15 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; that centers on how the construction of a language and writing strategy shape an individual's ability to read. It also discusses the manner in which bilingualism increases particular elements of metalinguistic awareness.

Published research studies by Elizabeth McAllister have concluded that metalinguistic abilities are associated to cognitive development and is contingent on metalinguistic awareness which relates to reading skill level, academic success and cultural environment that starts at infancy and continues through preschool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED308489&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED308489 |title=The Literacy of Metalinguistic Awareness|date=1989|author=McAllister, Elizabeth|publisher=Eric.ed.gov|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Text in Education and Society'', some examples of metalinguistic skills include discussing, examining, thinking about language, grammar and reading comprehension. The text also states that a student's recognition or self-correction of language in verbal and written form helps them further advance their skills. The book also illustrates manners in which literature can form connections or create boundaries between educational intelligence and practical knowledge.

Gail T. Gillion wrote the book, ''Phonological Awareness'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDWymkbfP30C&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=Metalinguistics+awareness&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RiL7T5XJu2&amp;sig=wAewxCdualj97xznyWOgxhJshas&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=MImxS-zkOYaKNPWLvKME&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Metalinguistics%20awareness&amp;f=false |title=Phonological Awareness: From Research to Practice|author=Gail T. Gillon|date=2004 |publisher=Books.google.com |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which illustrates the connection between phonological awareness and metalinguistic awareness's in literacy learning. It essentially states that a student's ability to understand the spoken word and their ability to recognize a word and decode it are dependent on each other.

[[Linguists]] use this term to designate activities associated with ''[[metalanguage]]'', a language composed of the entirety of words forming linguistic terminology (for example, [[syntax]], [[semantics]], [[phoneme]], [[lexeme]]... as well as terms in more current usage, such as word, sentence, letter, etc.) Metalinguistics is used to refer to the language, whether natural or formalized (as in [[logic]]), which is itself used to speak of language; to a language whose sole function is to describe a language.  The language itself must constitute the sole sphere of application for the entire vocabulary.&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=TMuhVO7LBdAC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=metalinguistics&amp;ots=YAATKdlPLa&amp;sig=W2K52EEyrK6GnmtQxQnAf3G0-BE#v=onepage&amp;q=metalinguistics&amp;f=true |title=Metalinguistic Development |author=Jean Émile Gombert|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|date=1992|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Experts are undecided about the value of awareness of metalanguage to language learners, and some "schools of thought" in language learning have been heavily against it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thornbury|first1=Scott|title=An A-Z of ELT (Methodology)|date=2006|publisher=Macmillan Education|location=Oxford|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metalinguistic awareness and bilingualism==
[[Metalinguistic awareness]]  refers to the understanding that language is a system of communication, bound to rules, and forms the basis for the ability to discuss different ways to use language (Baten, Hofman, &amp; Loeys, 2011). In other words, it is the ability to consciously analyze language and its sub-parts, to know how they operate and how they are incorporated into the wider language system (Beceren, 2010). An individual with such ability is aware that linguistic forms and structure can interact and be manipulated to produce a vast variety of meanings. Words are only arbitrarily and symbolically associated with their referents, and are separable from them. For example, a dog is named "Cat", but the word "Cat" is only a representation for the animal, dog. It does not make the dog a cat.

The term was first used by Harvard professor Courtney Cazden in 1974 to demonstrate the shift of linguistic intelligence  across languages.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}{{dubious|date=December 2014}} Metalinguistic awareness in [[bilingual]] learners is the ability to objectively function outside one language system and to objectify languages’ rules, structures and functions. [[Code-switching]] and translation are examples of bilinguals’ metalinguistic awareness. Metalinguistics awareness was used as a construct in research extensively in the mid 1980s and early 1990s.
 
Metalinguistic awareness is a theme that has frequently appeared in the study of bilingualism. It can be divided into four subcategories, namely phonological, word, syntactic and pragmatic awareness (Tunmer, Herriman, &amp; Nesdale, 1988). Amongst the four, phonological and word awareness are the two aspects of metalinguistic awareness that have garnered the greatest attention in bilingual literacy research. Research has shown metalinguistic awareness in bilinguals to be a crucial component because of its documented relationship and positive effects on language ability, symbolic development and literacy skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edweb.sdsu.edu/people/jmora/moramodules/MetaLingResearch.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225082333/http://edweb.sdsu.edu/people/jmora/moramodules/MetaLingResearch.htm|date=February 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, many studies investigating the impact of bilingualism on phonological and word awareness have indicated a positive bilingual effect (Baten, et al., 2011; Chen et al., 2004; Goetz, 2003; Kang, 2010; Ransdell, Barbier, &amp; Niit, 2006; Whitehurst &amp; Lonigan, 1998). Bilinguals are simultaneously learning and switching between two languages, which may facilitate the development of stronger phonological awareness. It is postulated that bilinguals’ experiences of acquiring and maintaining two different languages aid them in developing an explicit and articulated understanding of how language works (Adesope, Lavin, Thompson, &amp; Ungerleider, 2010). Hence they are equipped with stronger metalinguistic awareness as compared to their monolingual counterparts.

In their book ''Literacy and Orality'',&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=VKSIC5H8sd8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA251&amp;dq=metalinguistics&amp;ots=roD1IxtB-e&amp;sig=oWlgDG1nC_elQbjBs9kxB_IZgbc#v=onepage&amp;q=metalinguistics&amp;f=false |title=Literacy and Orality|author1=Olson, David R.|author2=Torrance, Nancy |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1991-07-26 |accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  scholars David R. Olson and Nancy Torrance explore the relationship between literacy and metalinguistic awareness, citing a link that arises from the fact that, in both reading and writing, language can become the object of thought and discussion.  Prose reading and writing can be an instrument of metalinguistic reflection and in those cases one must assess the particular meaning of terms and of grammatical relations between them in order, either to understand such texts or write them.&lt;ref name="google2"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11280">'''Microspherulites''' are microscopic spherical particles with diameter less than two&amp;nbsp;mm, usually in the 100 micrometre range, mainly consisting of mineral material (the Greek ''litos'' means "stone"). Only bodies created by natural physico-chemical processes, with no contribution of either biological (in [[aqueous]] [[depositional environment|sedimentary environments]] this contribution is possible) or human activity, are considered to be microspherulites.
Generally speaking, the common feature ([[sphericity]]) indicates that each sphere represents an internal equilibrium of forces within a fluid medium (water, air).

==Classification==

Several types of these forms are found in nature. Depending on the formational environment, microspherulites can be classed as [[oolite]]s, [[micrometeorite]]s, impact spherulites, [[iberulite]]s, [[pisolite]]s, [[Meteorite|aerolites]], [[chondrule]]s, [[biolite]]s, pellets, bubbles, or carbonaceous microspherules.

===Aqueous environment===
[[File:Detailed group of oolites.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Figure 1: Oolites observed with a transmitted light microscope.]]

* Oolites are internally structured spheres, composed mainly by [[calcium carbonate]] (Figure 1).  They are a type of constituent in [[limestone]]. The size of these [[ooid]]s ranges between 0.25 and 2&amp;nbsp;mm. The name derives from the Greek ''ooion'' (egg). They are formed by growing larger and accreting material as they move around. They accomplish this either (a) by physical attachment of [[Granularity|fine-grained]] material as they roll around, much in the manner of a snowball, and (b) by the [[Precipitation (chemistry)|chemical precipitation]] of material in solution, much as salt crystallizes from water during evaporation. In the former case they have thin concentric layers, and in the latter they have radiating sprays of crystals. However, a combination of both processes can be found. Microbes could contribute to their development.

===Aerial environment===

* Micrometeorites are typically metallic microspherules (iron or iron and nickel) but can also be formed by [[silicate minerals]], whose dimensions must range from tens of micrometres to one millimetre. They correspond to pieces of extraterrestrial [[meteoroids]], resulting from melting and vaporization during entry into the [[Earth's atmosphere|Earth’s atmosphere]]. During this melt stage a significant loss of mass can occur through holes in their surface. The degree of heating and their original composition determine that only a few minerals have been founded in micrometeorites. They have not yet been properly classified.
* Impact spherulites occur when a large extraterrestrial object strikes Earth at cosmic velocity, melts and vaporizes, silicate materials can condense into high spheroidal, sand-sized particles deposited around the point of impact. Unaltered impact spherulites consist entirely of glass ([[Tektite|microtektites]]) or a combination of glass and crystals grown in flight (microkrystites). Primary crystals are only common in microspherulites from two [[Phanerozoic]] impact layers: the Upper Eocene microkrystite or [[clinopyroxene]] spherule layer &lt;ref name="vr1"&gt;Glass, B.P., Burns, C.A., Crosbie, J.R., DuBois, D.L., 1985. Late Eocene North American Microtektites and Clinopyroxene-Bearing Spherules, Proceedings of the Sixteenth Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. Part 1. [[Journal of Geophysical Research]] 90, D 175-D 196.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary]] (K/T boundary) layer.&lt;ref name="vr2"&gt;Smit, J., 1999: The global stratigraphy of the.

[http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/action/doSearch?action=runSearch&amp;type=advanced&amp;result=true&amp;prevSearch=%2Bauthorsfield%3A(Smit%2C+J.)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Other crystalline phases may be [[olivine]], ''Fe-rich pyroxene'', [[spinel]]s and [[feldspar]]s. Frequently the crystals are replaced by [[Diagenesis|diagenetic]] phases such as [[goethite]], [[pyrite]], [[glauconite]], ''[[K-feldspar]]s'', [[quartz]], [[sericite]], [[Chlorite group|chlorite]], and ''carbonates''.

[[File:Group of iberulites.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 2: Group of iberulites observed under Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The arrows show vortex position.]]
* [[Iberulite]]s are ''co-associations'' of well-defined minerals, together with non-crystalline compounds, with axial geometry and a characteristic depression (vortex), structured around a coarse-grained core with a [[Clay minerals|smectite]]  rind, and pinkish colour (Figure 2). They are formed at present in the [[troposphere]] by complex [[aerosol]]-water-gas interactions. The modal size is in the 60-90 micrometre range, and the shapes are almost perfect spheres. Their name comes from the [[Iberian Peninsula]], indicating the place where they were discovered.&lt;ref name="vr3"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L., 2000.

[http://estudiosgeol.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosgeol/article/viewFile/147/146]&lt;/ref&gt;  They are related to intrusions of aerosol plumes from the [[Sahara desert]]. The mineralogy of the core (tens of micrometres thick) is commonly formed by [[quartz]], [[calcite]], [[dolomite]]  and [[feldspar]]s, while the most frequent minerals of the rind (a few micrometres thick) are [[clay minerals]], mainly smectites (beidellite, [[montmorillonite]]) and [[illite]], amorphous [[Silicon dioxide|silica]]  and impregnation of [[sulfate minerals]]   (mainly [[gypsum]], [[alunite]] and [[jarosite]]) and [[halide minerals|chlorides]].&lt;ref name="vr4"&gt;Díaz-Hernández, J.L., Párraga, 2008.

==Other related terms==

* Pisolites are spheroidal particles, larger in size and commonly more distorted than ooids. The name derives from the Greek ''pisos'' (pea). Mineral concentrations ([[bauxite]]s, [[limonite]]s, [[siderite]]s) and the pedogenic [[Caliche (mineral)|caliches]] (subaerial environment) can have pisolitic structure. They usually reach 5–8&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter and for this reason they can not strictly be considered microspherulites. Dunham (1969) &lt;ref name="vr5"&gt;Dunham, R.J., 1969. Vadose pisolites in the Capitan Reefs (Permian) New Mexico and Texas, in Depositional Environments in carbonate rocks: Soc. Econ. Palaeontologists and Mineralogists Spec. Publ. 14, 182-191.&lt;/ref&gt;  considered them associated to caliches, while Pray and Esteban (1977) &lt;ref name="vr6"&gt;Esteban, M., Pray, L.C., 1977. Origin of the pisolite facies of the shelf crest. In: Upper Guadalupian facies Permian Reef complex, Guadalupe Mountains, New Mexico and West Texas. 1977 Field Conference Guidebook. Society of Economic Paleontologists and Mineralogists, Permian Basin Section, Publication 77-16: 479-483.
[http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/gumo/1993_26/bibliography.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; suggested they were formed by inorganic precipitation from [[brine]]s.

* Aerolite is a generic term indicating lithogenic elements gathered from the atmosphere. This term does not imply sphericity or microscopic size.
* Chondrules are the microscopic constituents of [[chondrite]]s that represent 80% of the [[meteorite]]s that fall to the Earth per the   [[Meteoritical Society]]{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}. Chondrules range in diameter from a few micrometres to over 1&amp;nbsp;cm. They are formed by rapid heating of solid precursor material and subsequent melting, followed by slow cooling. Their main composition is silicate minerals such as olivine and [[pyroxene]], surrounded by feldspars (crystalline or glassy); minor minerals are ''Fe-sulfide'', metallic Fe-Ni and [[oxide]]s.
* Biolites are biologically produced, many organisms can produce mineral particles dubbed in general biolites. Their shape, size and composition may be very varied. As examples we can cite [[otolith|otolites]] (compounds of the [[vestibular system]] of the [[inner ear]]) and the calculi resulting from various [[histopathology|histopathologies]]. Studies have confirmed that microorganisms are able to precipitate minerals.&lt;ref name="vr7"&gt;Verrecchia, E.P., Freytet, P., Verrecchia, K.E., Dumont, J.L., 1995. Spherulites in calcrete laminar crusts: biogenic CaCO3, precipitation as a major contributor to crust formation. J. Sed. Research A65, 690–700.
[http://jsedres.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/reprint/65/4a/690?maxtoshow=&amp;HITS=10&amp;hits=10&amp;RESULTFORMAT=1&amp;author1=Verrecchia&amp;andorexacttitle=and&amp;field_name=fulltext&amp;searchid=1&amp;FIRSTINDEX=0&amp;sortspec=relevance&amp;fdate=5/1/1931&amp;tdate=10/31/2008&amp;resourcetype=HWCIT]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Pellets are those homogeneous aggregates with no internal structure, consisting of [[Micrite|micritic calcite]], spherical to ellipsoidal in shape and with sizes between 0.03 and 0.15&amp;nbsp;mm. They are thought to be faecal particles from aquatic organisms.

[[File:Glass microspherulites.jpg|thumb|350px|Figure 3: Solid glass microspheres used like ingredients in road and street signaling paintings.]]
* Bubbles include frequently unstable spherules which may be produced by the dispersion of two immiscible fluids forming an emulsion. Usually this term is applied to air-water [[emulsion]]s, but it is also valid for water-air (hazes, drops) or other liquid fluids (oil-water).
* Carbonaceous microspherules are a type of [[soot]] particle floating in the atmosphere, produced by [[Anthropogenic hazard|anthropogenic]] combustion processes of fuels, and may be coated with a layer of adsorbed hydrocarbons, sulfates or both. These particles are hollow microspherules that are black in colour, and made up of carbon or [[graphite]]. The size ranges from tens to a hundred micrometres.
* Artefacts are spherules intentionally produced spherical particles for use in industry or medicine. The shape is often perfectly spherical, truly uniform and size ranging ~ 50&amp;nbsp;nm to 1000&amp;nbsp;nm ([[Nanoparticle|nanospheres]]), or 1&amp;nbsp;µm to 1000&amp;nbsp;µm ([[microsphere]]s). They may be made up of organic-inorganic compounds and provided with different properties. In fact, commercially, microspheres can be found manufactured from materials such as glass, polymers (polyethylene, polystyrene) or ceramic. Microspheres can be solid or hollow, and so their density will be very different as well as their applications. Hollow microspheres usually are added to reduce the density of a material. Solid microspheres have numerous applications depending on their size and their manufacture material. Solid glass microspheres are used in fields such as roads and streets signaling (Figure 3). They are added to paintings used for traffic signs and roadway surface signaling to incorporate the retroreflective effect. So they improve the night visibility of the way.

The '''Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives program''' under the Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] armies was established in 1943 to help protect cultural property in war areas during and after [[World War II]]. The group of approximately 400 service members and civilians worked with military forces to safeguard historic and cultural monuments from war damage, and as the conflict came to a close, to find and return works of art and other items of cultural importance that had been [[Nazi plunder|stolen by the Nazis]] or hidden for safekeeping.

Many of the men and women of the MFAA, also known as '''Monuments Men''', went on to have prolific careers. Largely art historians and museum personnel, they had formative roles in the growth of many of the United States’ greatest cultural institutions, including the [[National Gallery of Art]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[New York City Ballet]], as well as in museums and other institutions in Europe.

== Formation ==
Even before the U.S. entered World War II, art professionals and organizations such as the American Defense Harvard Group and the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (ACLS) were working to identify and protect European art and monuments in harm’s way or in danger of Nazi plundering. The groups sought a national organization affiliated with the military which would have the same goal. [[Francis Henry Taylor]], director of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], took their concerns to Washington, D.C. Their efforts ultimately led to the establishment by [[U.S. President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] of the "American Commission for the Protection and Salvage of Artistic and Historic Monuments in War Areas" on June 23, 1943.

What began as a brain trust of the art world’s finest during the war became a group of 345 men and women from 13 countries that comprised the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section unit. They spent 1945 seeking out more than 1,000 troves containing an estimated 5 million pieces of artwork and cultural items stolen from wealthy Jews, museums, universities, and religious institutions. And for six years after the surrender, a smaller group of about 60 Monuments Men continued scouring Europe as art detectives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2014/02/08/where-the-nazis-hid-their-art-the-castle-behind-monument-men.html|title=Where the Nazis Hid Their Art: The Castle Behind ‘Monuments Men’|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly referred to as the [[Roberts Commission]] after its chairman, Supreme Court Justice [[Owen J. Roberts]], the group was charged with promoting the preservation of cultural properties in war areas, including the European, Mediterranean, and Far Eastern Theaters of Operations, providing that this mission did not interfere with military operations. Headquartered at the National Gallery of Art in Washington D.C., the Commission drew up lists of and reports on European cultural treasures and provided them to military units, in hopes that these monuments would be protected whenever possible.

The Commission helped establish the MFAA branch within the Civil Affairs and Military Government Sections of the Allied armies, led by Major [[L. Bancel LaFarge]]. After the war, the Roberts Commission helped the MFAA and Allied Forces return Nazi-confiscated artworks to rightful owners. It also promoted public awareness of looted cultural works. The group was dissolved in June 1946, when the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] took over its duties and functions.

[[General (United States)|General]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] facilitated the work of the MFAA by forbidding looting, destruction, and billeting in structures of cultural significance. He also repeatedly ordered his forces to assist the MFAA as much as possible. This was the first time in history an army attempted to fight a war and at the same time reduce damage to cultural monuments and property.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Prior to this war, no army had thought of protecting the monuments of the country in which and with which it was at war, and there were no precedents to follow.... All this was changed by a general order issued by Supreme Commander-in-Chief [General Eisenhower] just before he left Algiers, an order accompanied by a personal letter to all Commanders...the good name of the Army depended in great measure on the respect which it showed to the art heritage of the modern world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lambourne|first=Nicola|title=War Damage in Western Europe: The Destruction of Historic Monuments During the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u7oyrzWBRLIC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=Prior+to+this+war,+no+army+had+thought+of+protecting+the+monuments+of+the+country&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NnTABpxkkB&amp;sig=I1q9LbppwC-vLK2RtgJJwU85Acc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JK6mS_S6IM6Utge9gJX2CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Prior%20to%20this%20war%2C%20no%20army%20had%20thought%20of%20protecting%20the%20monuments%20of%20the%20country&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 April 2015|year=2001|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=978-0-7486-1285-7|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== War operations ==
As Allied Forces made their way through Europe, liberating [[Nazi-occupied territories]], Monuments Men were present in very small numbers at the front lines. Lacking handbooks, resources, or supervision, this initial handful of officers relied on their museum training and overall resourcefulness to perform their tasks. There was no established precedent for what they confronted. They worked in the field under the Operations Branch of SHAEF ([[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]], Europe, commanded by Eisenhower), and were actively involved in battle preparations. In preparing to take [[Florence]], which was used by the Nazis as a supply distribution center due to its central location in [[Italy]], Allied troops relied on aerial photographs provided by the MFAA which were marked with monuments of cultural importance so that pilots could avoid damaging such sites during bombings.

When damage to monuments did occur, MFAA personnel worked to assess damage and buy time for the eventual restoration work that would follow. Monuments officer [[Deane Keller]] had a prominent role in saving the [[Camposanto Monumentale|Campo Santo]] in [[Pisa]] after a mortar round started a fire that melted the lead roof, which then bled down the iconic 14th century [[fresco]]-covered walls. Keller led a team of Italian and American troops and restorers in recovering the remaining fragments of the frescoes and in building a temporary roof to protect the structure from further damage. Restoration of the frescoes continues even today.

Countless other monuments, churches, and works of art were saved or protected by the dedicated personnel of the MFAA section. Frequently entering liberated towns and cities ahead of ground troops, Monuments Men worked quickly to assess damage and make temporary repairs before moving on with Allied Armies as they conquered Nazi territory.

== Art repositories ==
American and allied forces in Europe discovered hidden caches of priceless treasures. Many were the product of looting by [[Adolf Hitler]] and the Nazis. Others had been legitimately evacuated from museums for safekeeping. Monuments Men oversaw the safeguarding, cataloguing, removal and packing of all works from all these repositories.

In Italy, museum officials had sent their holdings to various countryside locations such as the [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] villa of Montegufoni, which housed some of the Florentine collections.  As Allied forces advanced through Italy, the German army retreated north, stealing paintings and sculptures from these repositories as they fled. As German forces neared the [[Austria]]n border, they were forced to store most of their loot in various hiding places, such as a castle at [[Sand in Taufers]] and a jail cell in [[San Leonardo, Friuli|San Leonardo]].

Beginning in late March 1945, Allied forces began discovering these hidden repositories in what would become the "greatest treasure hunt in history". In Germany alone, U.S. forces found about 1,500 repositories of art and cultural objects looted from institutions and individuals across Europe, as well as German and Austrian museum collections that had been evacuated for safekeeping.  Soviet forces also made discoveries, such as treasures from the extraordinary [[Dresden Transport Museum]]. Hundreds of the artifacts were surrendered by, or had their locations reported by, [[SS]] General [[Karl Wolff]] as part of [[Operation Sunrise (World War II)|Operation Sunrise]], his secret negotiation with the [[Office of Strategic Services]]. These included the contents of the [[Uffizi Palace|Uffizi]] and [[Pitti Palace|Pitti]] palaces and paintings by Titian and Botticelli.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XHYkBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT381&amp;lpg=PT381&amp;dq=Pitti+and+Uffizi.+wolff&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=q6UZf1Ja6A&amp;sig=Dj0HX_js5Co7--J-Il6fzVvFUkY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjr_p253rDZAhUSSN8KHW4TBhcQ6AEwD3oECAcQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Pitti%20and%20Uffizi.%20wolff&amp;f=false|title=The Last 100 Days: The Tumultuous and Controversial Story of the Final Days of World War II in Europe|last=Toland|first=John|date=2014-11-26|publisher=Random House Publishing Group|isbn=9780804180948|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the repositories discovered by Monuments Men in Germany, Austria, and Italy were:
*[[Berchtesgaden]], Germany: The [[101st Airborne Division]], known as the "Screaming Eagles", found more than 1,000 paintings and sculptures stolen by German [[Reichsmarschall]] [[Hermann Göring]]. The cache had been evacuated from his country estate, [[Carinhall]], and moved to Berchtesgaden in April 1945 to protect it from the invading Russians.
*[[Breitenworbis|Bernterode]], Germany: Americans found four coffins containing the remains of Germany’s greatest leaders, including those of Frederick the Great ([[Frederick II of Prussia]]) and [[Generalfeldmarschall|field marshal]] [[Paul Von Hindenburg]].  Also found in the mine were 271 paintings, including court portraits from the [[Prussia]]n [[Sanssouci]] palace in [[Potsdam]], Germany, which had been hidden behind a locked door and a brick wall nearly five feet thick. The site was originally used as an ammunition and military supply complex manned by hundreds of slave laborers.
*[[Merkers]], Germany: The Kaiserode mine at Merkers was discovered by the U.S. 3rd Army under General [[George S. Patton]] in April 1945. [[Reichsbank]] gold, along with 400 paintings from the Berlin museums and numerous other crates of treasures were also discovered.  More dismal discoveries included gold and personal belongings from [[Nazi concentration camp]] victims.
*[[Neuschwanstein Castle]], Germany: Over 6,000 items stolen by the ERR ([[Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg]], [[Alfred Rosenberg]]’s task force that handled the "legalized" looting of Jews) from private collectors in [[France]] were found here, including furniture, jewelry (see [[Nazi gold]]), paintings and other belongings. Monuments Man [[Captain (United States)|Capt.]] [[James Rorimer]] oversaw the evacuation of the repository, which also held ERR documents.
*[[Altaussee#Nazi repository for stolen art|Altaussee]], Austria: This extensive complex of salt mines served as a huge repository for art stolen by the Nazis, but it also contained holdings from Austrian collections. More than 6,500 paintings alone were discovered at Altaussee. The contents included: [[Belgian]]-owned treasures such as [[Michelangelo]]’s ''[[Madonna of Bruges]]'' stolen from the [[Church of Our Lady (Bruges)|Church of Our Lady]] in [[Bruges]], and [[Jan van Eyck]]’s ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' stolen from [[Saint Bavo Cathedral]] in [[Ghent]]; [[Vermeer]]’s ''[[The Astronomer (Vermeer)|The Astronomer]]'' and ''[[The Art of Painting]]'' which were to be focal points of Hitler’s [[Führermuseum]] in [[Linz]], Austria; and paintings from the [[Capodimonte Museum]] in [[Naples]], Italy that had been stolen by the Hermann Göring Tank Division ([[Fallschirm-Panzer Division 1 Hermann Göring]]) at [[Monte Cassino]] in Italy.
*[[San Leonardo, Italy|San Leonardo]], Italy:  In the jail cell of this far northern town, Allied officials discovered paintings from the [[Uffizi]] that had been hurriedly unloaded by retreating German troops.  Among the masterpieces were paintings by [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Filippo Lippi]] and [[Giovanni Bellini]].

== Restitutions ==
In early May 1945, [[Lieutenant Colonel (United Kingdom)|Lt. Col]]. [[Geoffrey Webb]], British MFAA chief at Eisenhower’s headquarters, proposed that U.S. forces quickly prepare buildings in Germany so that they might receive large shipments of artworks and other cultural property found in the numerous repositories. Eisenhower directed his subordinates to immediately begin preparing such buildings, ordering that art objects were to be handled only by MFAA personnel. Suitable locations with little damage and adequate storage space were difficult to find.

By July 1945, U.S. forces had established two central collecting points within the [[Allied-occupied Germany#American Zone of Occupation|U.S. Zone in Germany]]: [[Munich]] and [[Wiesbaden]]. Secondary collecting points were also established in various German towns, including: [[Bad Wildungen]], [[Heilbronn]], [[Marburg]], [[Nuremberg]], and [[Oberammergau]]. One of the more critical of these secondary collecting points was at [[Offenbach (district)|Offenbach]], where officials processed millions of Nazi-looted books, archives, manuscripts, Jewish objects such as [[Torah scroll]]s, and property seized from [[Masonic]] lodges.

In summer 1945, Capt. Walter Farmer became the collecting point's first director. The first shipment of artworks arriving at Wiesbaden. When his superiors ordered that he send to the U.S. 202 German-owned paintings in his custody, Farmer and 35 others who were in charge of the Wiesbaden collection point gathered to draw up what has become known as the [[Wiesbaden manifesto]] on 7 November 1945, declaring "We wish to state that, from our own knowledge, no historical grievance will rankle so long or be the cause of so much justified bitterness as the removal for any reason of a part of the heritage of any nation even if that heritage may be interpreted as a prize of war." Among the co-signers was [[Lieutenant|Lt.]] [[Charles Percy Parkhurst]] of the U.S. Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Walter I. |last=Farmer |title=The Safekeepers: A Memoir of the Arts at the End of World War II |location=Berlin and New York |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=2000 |isbn=978-3-11-016897-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas C. |last=Howe Jr.|year=1946 |title=Salt mines and castles: The discovery and restitution of looted European art |location=Indiana |publisher=Bobbs-Merrill Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once an object arrived at a collecting point, it was recorded, photographed, studied, and sometimes conserved so that it could be returned to its country of origin as soon as possible. Some objects were easily identifiable and could be quickly returned, such as the [[Veit Stoss]] [[Altar of Veit Stoss]] from [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków|St. Mary's Basilica]] in [[Kraków]], which had been discovered in the [[Nuremberg Castle]]. Others, such as unmarked paintings or library collections, were much more difficult to process.
Among the facilities were:
*[[Munich Central Collecting Point]] (MCP):  Monuments officer Lt. Craig Hugh Smyth established the MCP in July 1945. He converted the former ''Führerbau'', which housed Hitler’s office, into a functional art depot complete with photography studios and conservation labs. This facility primarily housed art stolen by the ERR from private collections and Hitler’s collection found at Altaussee.
*Wiesbaden Collecting Point (WCP): Monuments officer Capt. Walter Farmer helped establish this facility in July 1945. Art from the [[Berlin]] museums and other items found in the mines at Merkers were processed here. Museum collections stored at [[Siegen]] and [[Grasleben]] also were sent to Wiesbaden.
*[[Offenbach Archival Depot|Offenbach Collecting Point (OCP)]], also known as the Offenbach Archival Depot:  Established in July 1945 in the I.G. Farben building on the Main River just outside [[Frankfurt]], [[Offenbach am Main|Offenbach]] primarily served as an archival depot. Because the OCP housed the largest collection of Jewish cultural property in the world, including the entire holdings of the Rothschild Library in Frankfurt and cultural objects from Masonic lodges, restitutions were complicated. Identification of the millions of books, religious objects and other materials was tedious. Many of the owners had become victims of the [[Holocaust]] leaving no one alive to pursue claims. The facility was closed in 1948 and its remaining unclaimed items were transferred to Wiesbaden.

==Occupation of Japan==
As the war neared its end in Japan in 1945, George Stout and fellow Monuments Man [[Major (United States)|Major]] [[Laurence Sickman]] recommended creating an MFAA division there. Consequently, the Arts and Monuments Division of the Civil Information and Education Section of GHQ of the Supreme Command of the Allied Powers in Tokyo was established. Stout was the Chief of the Division from about August 1945 until the middle of 1946.&lt;ref name=ueno&gt;{{cite web|last=Ueno|first=Rihoko|title=Monuments Men in Japan: Discoveries in the George Leslie Stout papers|url=http://blog.aaa.si.edu/2012/10/monuments-men-in-japan-discoveries-in-the-george-leslie-stout-papers.html|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=20 September 2013|date=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Langdon Warner]], archaeologist and curator of Oriental art at Harvard’s Fogg Museum, advised the MFAA Section in Japan from April to September 1946. Other members who served in [[Tokyo]]’s Arts and Monuments Division include Howard Hollis,  [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lt. Col.]] [[Harold Gould Henderson]], Lt. [[Sherman Lee]], and Lt. [[Patrick Lennox Tierney]].&lt;ref name=ueno /&gt;&lt;ref name=weber&gt;{{cite news |last=Weber |first=Bruce |title=Sherman Lee, Who Led Cleveland Museum, Dies at 90 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=July 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kappes |first=John |title=Sherman Lee, who led the Cleveland Museum of Art to global renown, dead at 90 |newspaper=The Plain Dealer |location=Cleveland |date=July 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MFAA personnel==
{{Hatnote|For a list of MFAA personnel, see [[List of Monuments, Fine Arts, and Archives (MFAA) personnel]]}}
The American museum establishment led the efforts to create the MFAA section. Included in this group were current museum directors, curators and art historians, as well as those who aspired to join their ranks. Upon returning home from service overseas, these men and women led the creation or improvement of some of the leading cultural institutions in the United States. Many major museums employed one or more MFAA officers before or after the war, including the [[National Gallery of Art]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], the [[Museum of Modern Art]], the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], and the [[Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art]].

Many other Monuments Men were professors at esteemed universities such as [[Harvard]], [[Yale]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[New York University]], [[Williams College]], and [[Columbia University]], among others. [[Paul J. Sachs]]’ famous "Museum Course" at Harvard educated dozens of future museum personnel in the decades preceding World War II. [[S. Lane Faison]]'s passion for art history was passed on to hundreds of students and future museum leaders at Williams College in the 1960s and 1970s, some of whom are currently directors at major United States museums.

Other MFAA personnel became founders, presidents, and members of cultural institutions such as the [[New York City Ballet]], the [[New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission]], the [[American Alliance of Museums|American Association of Museums]], the American Association of Museum Directors, the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], the [[Society of Architectural Historians]], the [[American Society of Landscape Architects]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], as well as respected artists, architects, musicians, and [[archivist]]s.

Two monuments officers were killed in Europe, both near the front lines of the Allied advance into Germany: Captain Walter Huchthausen, an American scholar and architect attached to the [[United States 9th Army|U.S. 9th Army]], was killed in April 1945 by [[small arms]] fire somewhere north of Essen and east of Aachen, Germany;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Robert M. |last=Edsel |title=The Monuments Men: Allied Heroes, Nazi Thieves, and the Greatest Treasure Hunt in History |location=New York |publisher=Center Street |year=2009 |pages=284-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Major (United Kingdom)|Major]] [[Ronald Edmond Balfour]], a British scholar attached to the [[Canadian First Army]], was killed in March 1945 by an explosion in Cleves, Germany.&lt;ref&gt; Edsel, (2009), pp. 242-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''#NEWPALMYRA''' (Also known as the '''New Palmyra Project''') is an effort to reconstruct the ancient city of [[Palmyra]] as an immersive virtual environment, based on archaeological and other clues.  The project was started from photos [[Bassel Khartabil]] had been taking of Palmyra since 2005.  He began building models of the ancient city, with support from [[Al Aous Publishers]].   
In 2012, Khartabil was arrested, and the original project and open source files were lost.  Barry Threw took over as director of the project, renamed #NEWPALMYRA, and a community of developers, modelers, and archaeologists began collaborating to model, restore, and later recreate from scratch those historical structures captured on film and camera.

In 2015, ISIL captured Palmyra and began destroying some of its famous historical sites. In late 2015, the [[Institute for Digital Archaeology]] began contributing to the New Palmyra Project, sending archaeologists with cheap 3D cameras to capture any  further structures that ISIL might decide to destroy.

; Arch of Triumph&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newpalmyra.org/models/arch-of-triumph/|title=Arch of Triumph|website=#NEWPALMYRA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arch-of-triumph-3D-print.stl|thumb|right|100px|Arch of Triumph as a 3D model]]
One of the best known structures in Palmyra was the monumental Arch of Triumph (قوس النصر). Constructed during the reign of Emperor [[Septimius Severus]] (193 to 211), it was sometimes mistakenly referred to as [[Hadrian]]’s arch. It was restored in the 1930s, and then destroyed completely during the [[Syrian Civil War]] in 2015.

Palmyra's main streets were not at right angles, and this arch was famously built at a 30-degree turn in the colonnade between the tetrapylon (التترابيل) and the Temple of Bel (معبد بل), with two richly carved façades angled away from one another.

A square platform, each corner containing a group of four columns. This was erected during the renovations of Diocletian at the end of the 3rd century. Each column had a pedestal in its center that originally supported a statue. The original columns were brought from Egypt and carved out of pink granite.  Only one was undamaged in 1963 when the whole was restored with concrete. Destroyed again by [[ISIL]] on January 20, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2016/1210/ISIS-recaptures-Palmyra-A-fresh-assault-on-heritage-sites-video|title=ISIS recaptures Palmyra: A fresh assault on heritage sites?

[[Image:Bassel-bel-3.jpg|thumb|alt=Temple of Bel rendering|Temple of Bel rendering.|100x100px]]This ancient temple was dedicated to the Mesopotamian god Bel in 32 AD.  Bel was worshipped at Palmyra along with the moon god Aglibol and the sun god Yarhibol.  The ruins of the temple were among the best preserved at Palmyra.  they were destroyed by ISIL in August, 2015.

'''Organology''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|ὄργανον}} – ''organon'', "instrument" and λόγος – ''logos'', "study") is the science of [[musical instrument]]s and their classification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.music.vt.edu/musicdictionary/texto/Organology.html Organology]&lt;/ref&gt; It embraces study of instruments' history, instruments used in different cultures, technical aspects of how instruments produce sound, and [[musical instrument classification]]. There is a degree of overlap between organology, [[ethnomusicology]] (being subsets of [[musicology]]) and the branch of the science of [[acoustics]] devoted to musical instruments.

==History==
A number of ancient cultures left documents detailing the musical instruments used and their role in society; these documents sometimes included a classification system. The first major documents on the subjects from the west, however, date from the 16th century, with works such as [[Sebastian Virdung]]'s ''Musica getuscht und ausgezogen'' (1511), and [[Martin Agricola]]'s ''Musica instrumentalis deudsch'' (1529).

One of the most important organologists of the 17th century is [[Michael Praetorius]]. His ''Syntagma musicum'' (1618) is one of the most quoted works from that time on the subject, and is the source of much of what we know about [[renaissance music|renaissance]] musical instruments. Praetorius's ''Theatrum instrumentorium'' (1620) contains possibly the first pictures of [[Africa]]n instruments in a European publication.

For much of the 18th and 19th centuries, little work was done on organology. Explorers returned to Europe with instruments from different cultures, however, so that by the end of the 19th century, some musical instrument collections were quite large. This led to a renewed interest in the subject.

One of the most important organologists of the 20th century was [[Curt Sachs]], who, as well as writing ''Real-Lexicon der Musikinstrumente'' (1913) and ''The History of Musical Instruments'' (1940), devised with [[Erich von Hornbostel]] the [[Hornbostel-Sachs]] scheme of instrument classification, which was first published in 1914 in the  Zeitschrift für Ethnologie([[Hornbostel–Sachs]]). This system classified musical instruments into four distinct categories: idiophones, membranophones, chordophones, and aerophones. &lt;ref&gt;Hornbostel, Erich M. von, and Curt Sachs. 1961. “Classi cation of Musical Instruments.” Translated by 
A. Baines and K. Wachsmann. ''The Galpin Society Journal'' 14:3–29.&lt;/ref&gt; This system of classification was updated several times by Sachs and Hornbostel and still continues to be updated periodically. &lt;ref&gt;Kartomi, Margaret J. “Part One: On the Nature of Classification of Musical Instruments.” In ''On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments'', 1-31. London: Univ. of Chicago, 1990. Pp.172&lt;/ref&gt; One update to the system was made by Sachs in 1940 through the addition of a 5th category-electrophones, a category encompassing instruments which produce music electronically.&lt;ref&gt;Kartomi, Margaret J. “Part One: On the Nature of Classification of Musical Instruments.” In ''On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments'', 1-31. London: Univ. of Chicago, 1990. Pp.172&lt;/ref&gt; Sachs' 1940 book, ''The History of Musical Instruments'' was meant to be a comprehensive compilation of descriptions of instruments from many cultures and their functions within their societies. &lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Curt.''The History of Musical Instruments''. New York: Norton, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is primarily divided into four chronological periods of instruments- early instruments, antiquity, the middle ages, and the modern occident. These periods are further subdivided into regions and then to significant time periods within those regions.&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Curt.''The History of Musical Instruments''. New York: Norton, 1940.&lt;/ref&gt;  
[[Andre Schaeffner]] introduced a system based on state-of-matter of the sound-producing mechanism, giving rise to two top-level categories: solid (containing strings and percussion), and gas (containing woodwind and brass).&lt;ref&gt;Kartomi (1990) On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments, Chicago: University of Chicago Press, xix + 329 pp&lt;/ref&gt; With the invention of [[hydraulophone]], the physics-based organology has been expanded to use solid, liquid, and gas, wherein the top-level category is the state-of-matter of the material that makes the sound. Reference to Kartomi's book, page 173.

A number of societies exist dedicated to the study of musical instruments. Among the more prominent are the [[Galpin Society]], based in the [[United Kingdom]]; and the [[American Musical Instrument Society]], based in the [[United States]].

==Outside Perspectives on the Sachs-Hornbostel Classification System==
According to one paper written by Henry M. Johnson published by the University of Oxford, “the universally used classification system established by musical instruments of Hornbostel and Sachs has become the paradigm of organology in many cultures”. &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Henry M. “An Ethnomusicology of Musical Instruments: Form, Function, and Meaning.” ''Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford'' 26, no. 3 (1995): 257-69.
Pp.261&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Eliot Bates states in a paper published in the Journal of the Society of Ethnomusicology that “The Hornbostel-Sachs system was not intended to classify the specificity of unique instruments, but rather to highlight commonalities across the world of instruments.” &lt;ref&gt;Bates, Eliot. “The Social Life of Musical Instruments.” ''Ethnomusicology'' 56, no. 3 (2012): 363-395. Pp.379&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Alternative Perspectives on the Classification of Musical Instruments==
Margaret Kartomi, professor and chairperson in the Department of Music at Monash University in Melbourne, approached the topic of musical instrument classification in 1990 with the intention of understanding how musical instruments are classified across cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Kartomi, Margaret J. “Part One: On the Nature of Classification of Musical Instruments.” In ''On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments'', 1-31. London: Univ. of Chicago, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach was justified by her observation that the concepts upon which an outside European researcher might classify musical instruments of a particular culture are likely different from the way that those native to the culture choose to classify their musical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Kartomi, Margaret J. “Part One: On the Nature of Classification of Musical Instruments.” In ''On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments'', 1-31. London: Univ. of Chicago, 1990. Pp.xv&lt;/ref&gt; Her book emphasizes the complexity that underlies the process of classifying musical instruments, as the classification system is often shaped by “socially influenced or structured ideas or belief systems”. &lt;ref&gt;Kartomi, Margaret J. “Part One: On the Nature of Classification of Musical Instruments.” In ''On Concepts and Classifications of Musical Instruments'', 1-31. London: Univ. of Chicago, 1990. Pp.271&lt;/ref&gt;

==Connections to Ethnomusicology== 
The 8th edition of UCLA’s publication on Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology published in 1990 was devoted to Issues in Organology. The first paper in the journal written by Sue Carole DeVale entitled “Organizing Organology” attempted to provide a more comprehensive system for defining the study of organology, particularly within the context of ethnomusicology.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ‘’Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology’’ 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.3&lt;/ref&gt; DeVale defines organology as “the science of sound instruments”.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.4&lt;/ref&gt; The word choice in this definition is very intentional- DeVale avoids the use of the term “music” or “musical” but rather "sound" because the function of some instruments, such as the Balinese slit drum, serves to signal an event rather than aid in a musical performance.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.4-5&lt;/ref&gt; She also defines three primary branches-classificatory, analytical, and applied- that serve as the basis for the study of organology.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.5&lt;/ref&gt; The classificatory branch essentially encompasses all of the ways in which musical instruments have been categorized, both cross-culturally and through cultural-specific systems.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.6&lt;/ref&gt; The analytical branch contains the body of work done on analyzing specific aspects of sound instruments and the cultural context/implications of the instruments.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.15&lt;/ref&gt; The applied branch is the aspects of organology that exist within the realm of museum work that involves the preservation of musical instruments, as well as instrument making.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.27&lt;/ref&gt; Devale also emphasizes throughout the paper the importance of the connections which exist between the three branches, as it is often essential to consider aspects of organology within all of three branches when doing work or research of any kind within the field.&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.27&lt;/ref&gt; She states that “these branches are independent in theory, but in practice, research and processes conducted with and on instruments and their sounds continuously flow between them and permeate the whole.”&lt;ref&gt;DeVale, Sue Carole. “Organizing Organology.” ''Selected Reports in Ethnomusicology'' 8 (1990): 1-34. Pp.27&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable paper on the topic of the connection between ethnomusicology and organology was written by Henry M. Johnson and published in 1995 in the Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford. This paper sought to demonstrate the contribution that the field of ethnomusicology can make to the study of musical instruments. Johnson defines four facets of the connection between ethnomusicology and organology- form, context, performance environment, and the interrelationship between instrument, performer and sound object.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Henry M. “An Ethnomusicology of Musical Instruments: Form, Function, and Meaning.” 
''Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford'' 26, no. 3 (1995): 257-69. Pp.258&lt;/ref&gt; These categories were meant to provide a more detailed look at the cultural significance of musical instruments. Johnson states, “Ethnomusicology can… produce a study of the instruments that includes an examination of the interrelationship between the material object, its context and its music, together with an understanding of the meanings connected with each of these areas in specific and general environments (i.e. the contexts in which a sound-producing instrument is played or understood)”.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Henry M. “An Ethnomusicology of Musical Instruments: Form, Function, and Meaning.” ''Journal of the Anthropological Society of Oxford'' 26, no. 3 (1995): 257-69. Pp.258&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2012, Eliot Bates of Cornell University approached the topic of the ethnomusicological study of musical instruments by focusing specifically on what he terms “the social life of musical instruments”.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Eliot. “The Social Life of Musical Instruments.” Ethnomusicology 56, no. 3 (2012): 363-395. Pp.364&lt;/ref&gt;Bates argues that “‘the social’ has not been adequately studied and theorized because of a paucity of attention given to how social relations are mobilized around material objects and the thing-power that they possess.”&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Eliot. “The Social Life of Musical Instruments.” Ethnomusicology 56, no. 3 (2012): 363-395. Pp.364&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, Bates states that material objects often hold significant social value. It is important to study the object not necessarily for the sake of categorization or understanding the way that it is played or how it works but the meaning that it holds for the musician and the audience.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34879">'''Payments for ecosystem services''' ('''PES'''), also known as '''payments for environmental services''' (or '''benefits'''), are incentives offered to farmers or landowners in exchange for managing their land to provide some sort of ecological service. They have been defined as "a transparent system for the additional provision of environmental services through conditional payments to voluntary providers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tacconi | first1 = L | year = 2012 | title = Redefining payments for environmental services | url = | journal = Ecological Economics | volume = 73 | issue = 1| pages = 29–36 | doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.09.028}}&lt;/ref&gt; These programmes promote the conservation of [[natural resources]] in the [[marketplace]].

[[Ecosystem services]] have no standardized definition but might broadly be called "the benefits of nature to households, communities, and economies"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-DP-06-02.pdf James Boyd and Spencer Banzhaf, What Are Ecosystem Services?

The report defined the broad categories of ecosystem services as food production (in the form of [[crops]], [[livestock]], capture [[fisheries]], [[aquaculture]], and [[Wildness|wild]] foods), [[fiber]] (in the form of [[timber]], [[cotton]], [[hemp]], and [[silk]]), [[Genetics|genetic]] [[resources]] ([[biochemicals]], [[natural]] [[medicines]], and [[pharmaceuticals]]), fresh [[water]], [[air quality]] [[regulation]], [[climate]] [[regulation]], [[water]] [[regulation]], [[erosion]] [[regulation]], [[Purified water|water purification]] and [[waste treatment]], [[disease]] [[regulation]], [[pest (organism)|pest]] [[regulation]], [[pollination]], [[natural hazard]] [[regulation]], and [[cultural]] services (including [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[religious]], and [[aesthetic]] [[values]], [[recreation]] and [[ecotourism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.millenniumassessment.org/documents/document.429.aspx.pdf |title=Living Beyond Our Means; Statement from the board of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, however, there is a "big three" among these 24 services which are currently receiving the most money and interest worldwide. These are climate change mitigation, watershed services and biodiversity conservation, and demand for these services in particular is predicted to continue to grow as time goes on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/010/a1200e/a1312e00.pdf |title=Paying Farmers for Environmental Services.

The same research project also estimated between $4.3 to 20.2 trillion a year of losses to ecosystem services, due to land use change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Changes in the global value of ecosystem services|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378014000685|journal = Global Environmental Change|date = 2014-05-01|pages = 152–158|volume = 26|doi = 10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.04.002|first = Robert|last = Costanza|first2 = Rudolf|last2 = de Groot|first3 = Paul|last3 = Sutton|first4 = Sander|last4 = van der Ploeg|first5 = Sharolyn J.|last5 = Anderson|first6 = Ida|last6 = Kubiszewski|first7 = Stephen|last7 = Farber|first8 = R.

PES has also been touted as a tool for rural development. In 2007, the [[World Bank]] released a document outlining the place of PES in development.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTEEI/Resources/ProPoorPES-2col.pdf|title=Guidelines for "Pro-Poor" Payments for Environmental Services|last=Pagiola|first=Stefano|date=|website=worldbank.org|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the link between the environment and development had been officially recognized long before with the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|Stockholm Conference on the Human Environment]] and later reaffirmed by the [[Earth Summit|Rio Conference on Environment and Development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/documents.multilingual/default.asp?documentid=97&amp;articleid=1503|title=Stockholm 1972 - Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment - United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)|last=UNEP|first=|date=|website=www.unep.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/documents.multilingual/default.asp?documentid=78&amp;articleid=1163|title=Rio Declaration - Rio Declaration on Environment and Development - United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)|last=UNEP|first=|date=|website=www.unep.org|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note PES programs are usually not designed to be primarily poverty alleviation schemes, although they may incorporate development mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pagiola|first=Stefano|last2=Arcenas|first2=Agustin|last3=Platais|first3=Gunars|date=2005-02-01|title=Can Payments for Environmental Services Help Reduce Poverty?

Some PES programs involve contracts between consumers of ecosystem services and the suppliers of these services. However, the majority of the PES programs are funded by governments and involve intermediaries, such as non-government organisations. The party supplying the environmental services normally holds the [[property rights]] over an environmental good that provides a flow of benefits to the demanding party in return for compensation. In the case of private contracts, the beneficiaries of the [[ecosystem]] services are willing to pay a price that can be expected to be lower than their welfare gain due to the services. The providers of the ecosystem services can be expected to be willing to accept a payment that is greater than the cost of providing the services.

== Theoretical perspectives ==
There are three main theoretical perspectives concerning PES. The first is that of environmental economics, the second of ecological economics, and the third of those who reject the very idea of ecosystem services.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tacconi|first=Luca|date=2012-01-15|title=Redefining payments for environmental services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800911004046|journal=Ecological Economics|volume=73|pages=29–36|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2011.09.028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental economics ===
The basic conceptualization of nature from the perspective of environmental economics is that manufactured capital can be used as a substitute for [[natural capital]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gómez-Baggethun|first=Erik|last2=de Groot|first2=Rudolf|last3=Lomas|first3=Pedro L.|last4=Montes|first4=Carlos|date=2010-04-01|title=The history of ecosystem services in economic theory and practice: From early notions to markets and payment schemes|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S092180090900456X|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Special Section - Payments for Environmental Services: Reconciling Theory and Practice|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1209–1218|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of PES provided by environmental economics is the most popular: a voluntary transaction between a service buyer and service seller that takes place on the condition that either a specific ecosystem service is provided or land is used in a way to secure that service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wunder|first=Sven|year=2005|title=Payments for environmental services: Some nuts and bolts|journal=Center for International Forestry Research|volume=Occasional Paper No.42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is directly related to the Coase theorem, upon which PES is strongly based from the environmental economics perspective, which states that in a competitive market, in the absence of transaction costs and in the presence of clear property rights, direct negotiation between private parties can lead to efficient outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coase|first=R. H.|title=[[The Problem of Social Cost]]|url=|journal=The Journal of Law and Economics|volume=3|pages=1–44|doi=10.1086/466560|year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in reality, transaction costs are virtually always present and private parties cannot always reach agreements on their own. One of the main reasons is lack of sustained financing, which often leads governments to provide some type of funding assistance. The environmental economics theorists acknowledge that PES systems can resemble an environmental subsidy, complicating the strict Coasian backing.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engel|first=Stefanie|last2=Pagiola|first2=Stefano|last3=Wunder|first3=Sven|date=2008-05-01|title=Designing payments for environmental services in theory and practice: An overview of the issues|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800908001420|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Payments for Environmental Services in Developing and Developed Countries|volume=65|issue=4|pages=663–674|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2008.03.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecological economics ===
The conceptualization of nature as understood by ecological economics is that manufactured capital and natural capital are not exclusive or substitutable, but rather complementary.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; PES as understood by ecological economics comprises three schematic components.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muradian|first=Roldan|last2=Corbera|first2=Esteve|last3=Pascual|first3=Unai|last4=Kosoy|first4=Nicolás|last5=May|first5=Peter H.|date=2010-04-01|title=Reconciling theory and practice: An alternative conceptual framework for understanding payments for environmental services|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800909004558|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Special Section - Payments for Environmental Services: Reconciling Theory and Practice|volume=69|issue=6|pages=1202–1208|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2009.11.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first surrounds the importance of the economic incentive. This idea concerns the relative weight an economic incentive may carry when understood in relation to social, moral, or other non-economic incentives.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The second component is directness of the transfer, referring to the extent of interaction between ultimate buyers and sellers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt; The most direct program would occur between one buyer and one seller, with no intermediaries. A relatively indirect program would remove the buyers and sellers from each other, placing intermediaries between them, commonly in the form of NGOs and governments. The third and final component is the degree of commodification. This addresses the extent to which the environmental service (ES) being provided can be specifically and clearly assessed and measured. Some ES may be relatively easy to assess, such as tons of carbon sequestered, while others may prove difficult.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Rejection of ecosystem services ===
Those who reject the idea of valuation of ecosystem services argue that nature should be conserved and valued for nature's sake, and that nature's value is impossible to quantify because its value is inherently infinite.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCauley|first=Douglas J.|date=2006-09-07|title=Selling out on nature|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v443/n7107/full/443027a.html?cookies=accepted|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=443|issue=7107|pages=27–28|doi=10.1038/443027a|issn=0028-0836}}&lt;/ref&gt; They posit that the attempt to force the idea of ecosystem services into the market system leads to conservation only when it is deemed useful for human life, abandoning ideals environmental conservation when nature conflicts with human interest or simply does not affect human activity.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There are also those who support the valuation of nature from a purely practical standpoint, expressed in the idea that "something is better than nothing." They realize and acknowledge the problematic nature of the quantitative valuation of nature but at the same time argue that practically, in a highly commodified society, it is a necessary measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costanza|first=Robert|last2=Daly|first2=Herman|year=1992|title=Natural Capital and Sustainable Development|journal=Conservation Biology|volume=6|doi=10.1046/j.1523-1739.1992.610037.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Commodification]] of natural capital results in undervaluing ecological systems by not accounting for the innumerable wide-range services provided. PES may decrease in utility as 1) wealth becomes concentrated to the point that natural resource scarcity results in higher short-term value for unsustainable resource extraction, and 2) the long-term cost to engineer limited-range replacement services is [[Externality|externalized]] onto citizens. This occurs either through increased expense to the existing systems or as justification to privatize services for further profit. For example, a parent corporation can profit both from the exploitation of an ecosystem, and by engineering and operating the services formerly provided.

==Organizations and motives for incentivizing production of ecosystem services==

Though the goal of all PES programs is the procurement of some sort of ecosystem service, the reasons why organizations or governments would incentivize the production of these services are diverse. For example, the world's largest and longest running PES program is the United States' [[Conservation Reserve Program]],&lt;ref name=jenk/&gt; which pays about $1.8 billion a year under 766,000 contracts with farmers and landowners to "rent" a total {{convert|34700000|acre|km2}} of what it considers "environmentally-sensitive land."&lt;ref name=programe&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/!ut/p/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB/.cmd/ad/.ar/sa.retrievecontent/.c/6_2_1UH/.ce/7_2_5JM/.p/5_2_4TQ/.d/1/_th/J_2_9D/_s.7_0_A/7_0_1OB?PC_7_2_5JM_contentid=2008%2F10%2F0251.xml&amp;PC_7_2_5JM_parentnav=LATEST_RELEASES&amp;PC_7_2_5JM_navid=NEWS_REL |title=USDA Issues $1.8 Billion in Conservation Reserve Payments |publisher=United States Department of Agriculture |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; These farmers agree to plant "long-term, resource-conserving covers to improve water quality, control soil erosion and enhance habitats for waterfowl and wildlife."&lt;ref name=programe/&gt; This program has existed in some form or another since the wake of the American [[Dust Bowl]], when the federal government began paying farmers to avoid farming on poor quality, erodible land.&lt;ref name=jenk/&gt;

In 1999, the Chinese central government announced an even more expensive project under its $43 billion [[Grain for Green]] program, by which it offers farmers grain in exchange for not clearing forested slopes for farming, thereby reducing erosion and saving the streams and rivers below from the associated deluge of sedimentation.&lt;ref name="ecosystemmarketplace1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecosystemmarketplace.com/pages/article.news.php?component_id=4193&amp;component_version_id=6082&amp;language_id=12 |title=Grain for Green |publisher=Ecosystem Marketplace |date=2006-02-24 |accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably, some sources cite the cost of the entire program at $95 billion.&lt;ref name=jenk/&gt; Many less extensive nationally funded PES projects which bear resemblances to the American and Chinese land set-aside programs exist around the world, including programs in Canada, the EU, Japan and Switzerland.&lt;ref name="ecosystemmarketplace1"/&gt;

==Examples==

=== North America ===

==== United States ====
In [[Jamestown, Rhode Island]], [[United States]], farmers usually harvest the hay in their fields twice a year. However, this practice destroys the habitats of many local grassland birds. Economists from the University of Rhode Island and EcoAssets Markets Inc. raised money from residents of Jamestown who were willing to help the birds. The range of investments was between $5 and $200 per person for a total of $9,800. This money was enough to compensate three Jamestown farms for the cost of reducing their yearly harvests and getting their hay from another source. In this way, the birds have sufficient time to nest and leave the grounds without being subject to a hay harvest. In this example, the farmers benefit because they only have to harvest their fields once a year instead of twice, and the contributors benefit because they value the lives of the birds more than the money they contributed to the project.

[[Salt Lake City|Salt Lake City, Utah]], [[United States]] has managed the majority of its watershed since the 1850s through multi-jurisdictional regulatory mechanisms such as specifying allowable uses (and restricting them), and purchasing land or conservation easements. This long-standing, legally-defensible, yet often-overlooked strategy preserves ecosystem services, while still allowing widely utilized recreation including skiing, snowboarding, hiking, mountain biking, and fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blanchard|first=Libby|last2=Vira|first2=Bhaskar|last3=Briefer|first3=Laura|date=2015-10-24|title=The Lost Narrative: Ecosystem service narratives and the missing Wasatch watershed conservation story|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212041615300462|journal=Ecosystem Services|volume=16|pages=105–111|doi=10.1016/j.ecoser.2015.10.019}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing uses of the land are generally unaffected, and commercial enterprises are restricted to no- or low-impact tourism-related activities.

=== Central and South America ===

==== Costa Rica ====
[[File:Costa_Rica_map_shaded_relief.png|thumb|Costa Rica]]
Costa Rica's PES program, ''Pagos por servicios ambientales'' (PSA) was established in 1997, and was the first PES program to be implemented on a national scale.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pagiola|first=Stefano|date=2008-05-01|title=Payments for environmental services in Costa Rica|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800907004235|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Payments for Environmental Services in Developing and Developed Countries|volume=65|issue=4|pages=712–724|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.07.033}}&lt;/ref&gt; It came on the back of Forestry Law 7575 of 1996 which prioritized environmental services over other forest activities such as timber production, and which established the national fund for forest financing (''Fondo Nacional de Financiamento Forestal),'' FONAFIFO.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ringhofer|first=Lisa|last2=Singh|first2=Simron J.|last3=Smetschka|first3=Barbara|year=2013|title=Climate Change Mitigation in Latin America: A Mapping of Current Policies, Plans and Programs|journal=Institute for Social Ecology|publisher=Alpen-Adria University, Vienna|volume=Working Paper 143|issn=1726-3816}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PSA follows several years of different environmental programs in Costa Rica including the Forest Credit Certificate (''Certificado de Abono Forestal'', CAF) of 1986 and the Forest Protection Certificate (''Certificado para la Protección del Bosque,'' CPB) of 1995.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; One of the main reasons for establishing the PSA program was to reframe conservation subsidies as payments for services.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matulis|first=Brett Sylvester|date=2013-01-01|title=The narrowing gap between vision and execution: Neoliberalization of PES in Costa Rica|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016718512001868|journal=Geoforum|series=Global Production Networks, Labour and Development|volume=44|pages=253–260|doi=10.1016/j.geoforum.2012.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explicitly recognized four environmental services:  mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions, hydrological services, biodiversity protection, and provision of scenic beauty.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; During the early years of the PSA program from 2001 to 2006, it was funded by a World Bank loan and a grant from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) under the project name "Ecomarkets."&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; From 2007 to 2014, the World Bank renewed its support for the program through a new project called "Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.projects.worldbank.org/P093384/mainstreaming-market-based-instruments-environmental-management-project?lang=en|title=Projects  : Mainstreaming Market-Based Instruments for Environmental Management Project {{!}} The World Bank|website=www.projects.worldbank.org|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This support also generated FONAFIFO's Sustainable Biodiversity Fund (FBS), designed to target PES programs at owners of small pieces of land, indigenous communities, and communities with low development rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fonafifo.go.cr/home/projects/fbs.html#HERMES_TABS_1_1|title=Sustainable Biodiversity Fund (FBS)|website=www.fonafifo.go.cr|access-date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financing of PSA activities was initially accomplished in part through a fuel tax established by Forestry Law 7575. The tax was used to flexibly target ecologically important areas. In 2006 a water tariff was introduced to provide additional funding. The water tariff has a relatively narrow application when compared to the fuel tax. Under the water tariff, holders of water concessions pay fees, a portion of which is transferred for use in the PSA exclusively within the watershed in which the revenues were generated. This removes the potential for revenues to be distributed as needed and has been criticized for concentrating funding in select areas, despite their relatively low ecological importance.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

FONAFIFO acts as a semi-autonomous intermediary organization between service buyers and service sellers. As of 2004, FONAFIFO had contracted 11 different companies in agribusiness, hydropower, municipal water supply, and tourism to pay for the water services they receive. Since then, FONAFIFO has reached agreements with several more companies.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

By the end of 2005, 95% of land enrolled in Costa Rica's PSA was under forest conservation contracts, covering 10% of the country.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; It is estimated that from the time the program began to 2005, forest cover area increased form 394,000 hectares to 2.45 million hectares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wri.org/sites/default/files/WRI_Restoration_Diagnostic_Case_Example_Costa_Rica.pdf|title=The Restoration Diagnostic - Case Example: Costa Rica|last=Buckingham|first=Kathleen|last2=Hanson|first2=Craig|date=|website=www.wri.org|publisher=World Resources Institute|orig-year=2015|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also estimated that the PSA prevented 11 million tons of carbon emissions between 1999 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/env/cc/38523758.pdf|title=Incentives to Reduce GHG Emissions from Deforestation: Lessons Learned from Costa Rica and Mexico|last=Karousakis|first=Katia|date=|year=2007|website=www.oecd.org|publisher=Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these successes, the PSA has been criticized for critical shortcomings. As it stands, the PSA payment system employs a flat rate cash payment to all participating landowners. This has resulted in large swaths of ecologically high value areas being left unenrolled in the program due to associated higher opportunity costs for land-use change not being adequately compensated for by the flat rate payment scheme.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
[[File:22nd_meridian_Bolivia.png|thumb|Bolivia]]

==== Los Negros, Bolivia ====
The program in Los Negros, Bolivia is a small user-financed program of combined payments for watershed and biodiversity services started by local NGO Fundación Natura Bolivia in 2003.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asquith|first=Nigel M.|last2=Vargas|first2=Maria Teresa|last3=Wunder|first3=Sven|date=2008-05-01|title=Selling two environmental services: In-kind payments for bird habitat and watershed protection in Los Negros, Bolivia|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921800907006076|journal=Ecological Economics|series=Payments for Environmental Services in Developing and Developed Countries|volume=65|issue=4|pages=675–684|doi=10.1016/j.ecolecon.2007.12.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The target area of the program is the watershed in Los Negros valley servicing the town of Santa Rosa and other downhill towns. By August 2007, 2774 hectares of  native vegetation were enrolled in the program under 46 landowners.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Funding for the program was initially provided by the US Fish and Wildlife Service, before the Municipality of Pampagrande began making payments for the services&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One of the program's most unique aspects is the landowners' specific request that they be paid in-kind with beehives. They claimed that they wanted their compensation to last beyond a simple cash transfer. Along with the beehives, payment recipients are able to receive training in apiculture. It also allowed for those who prefer cash to sell their hives.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

An organizational obstacle to the program is that some farmers fear that the scheme is just a way to dispossess them of their land. This was a major factor in deciding to be paid in-kind as it is perceived as less of an attempt at land appropriation. Natura is addressing this issue by maintaining a constant presence in the community and leveraging social networks to convince farmers of the program's benefits.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Another issue regards the service buyer of the program. The Municipality of Pampagrande has received some limited support from irrigators in contributing to the program payments. This structure essentially provides the environmental services to downstream users essentially free of charge. Natura is working to implement a strategy through which beneficiaries of environmental services will directly contribute to their maintenance.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Program evaluation has been impeded by two factors, namely a lack of baseline data and insufficient data as the program develops. These are important in order to establish the additionality of the program. This issue is not unique to Los Negros, however, as many programs suffer from a lack of sufficient monitoring and evaluation mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

==== Honduras ====
In [[Jesús de Otoro]], [[Honduras]], the Cumes River is the town's main source of clean water. Coffee producers were dumping their waste into the river upstream, polluting the source and directly affecting the consumers downstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watershedmarkets.org/documents/Honduras_Jesus_de_Otoro.pdf|title=Honduras - Jesus de Otoro PASOLAC Initiative|publisher=watershedmarkets.org|accessdate=25 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To solve this problem, the local Council for Administration of Water and Sewage Disposal (JAPOE) created a payment program to benefit coffee producers upstream and the town's inhabitants who lived downstream. The villagers downstream paid around $0.06 per household per month to JAPOE, who redirected the money toward the upstream farmers. The farmers complied with guidelines, such as construction of irrigation ditches, proper management of waste, and use of organic fertilizers.

Pico Bonito Forests, near [[La Ceiba]], Honduras, is a mission-driven, for-profit venture between the [[Pico Bonito]] National Park Foundation and the [[EcoLogic Development Fund]]. [[Carbon credits]] are generated by planting native trees to capture, or [[Carbon sequestration|sequester]], carbon dioxide. The credits are then sold though the World Bank's BioCarbon Fund to countries aiming to meet their [[carbon emissions]] reduction targets. The project offers a unique business model because it is owned jointly by investors and the communities near the park. Community members earn income and share profits from implementing the sustainable forestry practices that capture carbon. By 2017, the project is expected to sequester from .45-.55 Mt of carbon through [[reforestation]] and [[agroforestry]] and up to an additional .5 Mt of carbon through avoided [[deforestation]] as destructive practices are replaced with sustainable practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://carbonfinance.org/Router.cfm?Page=BioCF&amp;FID=9708&amp;ItemID=9708&amp;ft=Projects&amp;ProjID=9637|title=Carbon Finance|date=|publisher=Carbon Finance|accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
The Scolel Té program in [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]], aims to create a market for positive externalities of [[shade-grown coffee]] plantations. Designed by the [[University of Edinburgh]]'s Institute of Ecology and Resource Management along with the Edinburgh Centre for Carbon Management, using the Plan Vivo System, Scolel Té is a PES program under which farmers agree to responsible farming and reforestation practices in exchange for payment for carbon offsets. The NGO Ambio manages Scolel Té. Farmers submit their reforestation plans to Ambio, which judges their financial benefits and the amount of carbon sequestration associated with each plan. The farmers then receive payments from the Fondo BioClimatico, managed by Ambio. Funding for the Fondo BioClimatico comes from the sale of [[Voluntary Emissions Reduction]] (VERs) to private groups at a price of $13 per ton of Carbon sequestered.

==== Hoima and Kibaale, Uganda ====
[[File:Ug-map.png|thumb|Uganda]]

The Hoima and Kibaale PES intervention took place from 2010 to 2013 and was especially unique because it was the first PES program set up specifically for a randomized control trial to empirically determine its impact on deforestation&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jayachandran|first=Seema|last2=de Laat|first2=Joost|last3=Lambin|first3=Eric F.|last4=Stanton|first4=Charlotte Y.|year=2016|title=Cash for Carbon: A Randomized Controlled Trial of Payments for Ecosystem Services to Reduce Deforestation|journal=Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA)|volume=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2016/07/06/this-experiment-could-help-save-endangered-chimps-and-slow-global-warming-at-the-same-time/|title=A cheap, simple experiment just found a very effective way to slow deforestation|website=Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the treatment villages, owners of forested land were paid $28 per year over the course of two years for every hectare of forest land that was left intact, with the possibility of additional payment for planting new trees. The payment scheme amounted to 5% of average annual income for the typical participating landowner.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The program evaluation found there to be significantly less deforestation in participating villages (2%-5%) than in control villages (7%-10%).&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

It is important to note that the program did not carry on beyond the evaluation period, and it is assumed that previous forest practice will resume once landowners stop receiving program payments.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2374">[[Image:ProlongedSine.png|thumb|350px|The two typical dependencies of the bending speed from the reorientation angle (experimental data from Metzner, 1929).]]

'''The law of the prolonged [[sine]]''' was observed when measuring strength of the reaction of the plant stems and roots in response to turning from their usual vertical orientation. Such organisms maintained their usual vertical growth, and, if turned, start bending back toward the vertical. The prolonged sine law was observed when measuring the dependence of the bending speed from the angle of reorientation.

==The observed law==
It was observed that deviation form the desired growth direction by more than the 90 degrees causes further increase of the bending speed. After turning the 135 degrees the reoriented [[plant]] or [[fungi]] understands that it is places "head down" and bends faster than turned by just 45 degrees. Poul Larsen in 1962 &lt;ref&gt;Larsen P, (1962), Ortho-geotropism in shoots and coleoptiles, in Encyclopedia of plant physiology, W. Ruhland ed., Springer, Berlin, pp. 153-199. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larsen P, (1969), The optimum angle of geotropic stimulation and its relation to the
starch statolith hypothesis, Physiologia Plantarum, vol. 22, pp. 469-488. &lt;/ref&gt; proposed, that the intensity of the gravitropic reaction (bending rate) is proportional to

:&lt;math&gt;g \times a\sin\alpha \times (1-b\cos\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

where α is the angle of reorientation, g - gravity vector and constants a and b are determined experimentally. &lt;ref&gt;Сила тяжести в процессах роста растений / А. И. Меркис; Отв. ред. Г.Б. Максимов. - М. : Наука, 1990. - 185 с. : ил., граф., табл. - Библиогр.: с. 169-184. - {{ISBN|5-02-004731-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
Following the popular [[hypothesis]] of the mechanism of the plant spatial orientation, the bending from the horizontal position is caused by some small heavy particles that after turning put the pressure on the side [[Cell (biology)|cell]] wall, irritating some system and activating the bending process. The pressure of such particle to the cell was would be proportional to the sine of the reorientation angle and would be equal for the reorientations by both 45 and 135 degrees.

'''Runtime error detection''' is a [[software verification]] method that analyzes a software application as it executes and reports [[Software bug|defects]] that are detected during that execution. It can be applied during [[unit testing]], [[component testing]], [[integration testing]],  [[system testing]] (automated/scripted or manual), or [[penetration test]]ing.

Runtime error detection can identify defects that manifest themselves only at runtime (for example, file overwrites) and zeroing in on the root causes of the application crashing, running slowly, or behaving unpredictably. Defects commonly detected by runtime error detection include:
* [[Race condition]]s
* [[Interrupt|Exceptions]]
* [[Resource leak]]s
* [[Memory leak]]s
* [[Vulnerability (computing)|Security attack vulnerabilities]] (e.g., [[SQL injection]])
* [[Null_pointer|Null pointers]]
* [[Memory corruption|Uninitialized memory]]
* [[Buffer overflow]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parasoft.com/jsp/capabilities/runtime_error_detection.jsp Runtime Error Detection] by [[Parasoft]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Runtime error detection tools can only detect errors in the executed control flow of the application.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-11261-4_5 MUST: A Scalable Approach to Runtime Error Detection in MPI Programs] by  Tobias Hilbrich, Martin Schulz, Bronis R. de Supinski, Matthias S. Müller, in Tools for High Performance Computing 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

This assists SSEC in "fulfilling its aims through the study of the [[New Testament]] in its times, including its [[Jewish Christianity|Jewish context]], and the development of [[Early Christianity]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/about_us/ About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327131245/http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/about_us/ |date=2012-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and purpose==

The Society was established by the Vice-Chancellor on 8 May 1987, and a Constitution for the Society was approved by the Council of Macquarie University in December 1987. The society has no ecclesiastical ties, however it collaborates on academic occasions with [[Christian theology|Christian]] and [[Jewish theology]] colleges and communities. The current president is [[Alanna Nobbs]]. The society circulates three newsletters a year outlining their activities.

The society lists its aims as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/about_us/ About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327131245/http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/about_us/ |date=2012-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* To encourage the study of the [[New Testament]] in its times and related topics.
* To build up resources for this study (for example, books, papyri, coins).
* To organise conferences, public lectures, seminars and other activities to which the Society's members are invited.
* To circulate three newsletters a year outlining forthcoming activities.

==Projects==
The Society supports a number of associated projects including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/associated_projects/ SSEC Associated Projects] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327154717/http://www.mq.edu.au/about_us/faculties_and_departments/faculty_of_arts/department_of_ancient_history/community_partners/ssec/associated_projects/ |date=2012-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sociological theories''' are statements of how and why particular facts about the social world are related.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Edition"/&gt; They range in scope from concise descriptions of a single social process to [[paradigm]]s for analysis and [[interpretation (philosophy)|interpretation]]. Some [[sociology|sociological]] theories explain aspects of the social world and enable prediction about future events,&lt;ref name="What is Sociological Theory?"/&gt; while others function as broad perspectives which guide further sociological analyses.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002"/&gt;

==Sociological theory vs. social theory==
Kenneth Allan&lt;ref name="Allan2006"/&gt; proposed the distinction between sociological theory and [[social theory]]. In Allan's usage, sociological theory consists of abstract and testable propositions about society.&lt;ref name="Allan2006"/&gt; It often heavily relies on the [[scientific method]], which aims for [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]], and attempts to avoid passing [[value judgment]]s. In contrast, social theory, according to Allan, focuses on commentary and critique of [[modern society]] rather than explanation.&lt;ref name="Allan2006"/&gt; Social theory is often closer to [[Continental philosophy]]; thus, it is less concerned with [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] and derivation of testable propositions, and more likely to pass normative judgments.&lt;ref name=sanderson/&gt;

Prominent sociological theorists include [[Talcott Parsons]], [[Robert K. Merton]], [[Randall Collins]], [[James Samuel Coleman]], [[Peter Blau]], [[Niklas Luhmann]], [[Marshal McLuhan]], [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], [[George Homans]], [[Harrison White]], [[Theda Skocpol]], [[Gerhard Lenski]], [[Pierre van den Berghe]] and [[Jonathan H. Turner]].&lt;ref name=sanderson/&gt; Prominent social theorists include: [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Anthony Giddens]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Dorothy E. Smith|Dorothy Smith]], [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger|Roberto Unger]], [[Alfred Schütz]], [[Jeffrey Alexander]], and [[Jacques Derrida]].&lt;ref name="sanderson"/&gt; There are also prominent scholars who could be seen as being in-between social and sociological theories, such as [[Harold Garfinkel]], [[Herbert Blumer]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Pierre Bourdieu]] and [[Erving Goffman]].&lt;ref name=sanderson/&gt;

==History of sociological theories==
{{Details|History of sociology}}
The field of [[sociology]] itself–and sociological theory by extension–is relatively new. Both date back to the 18th and 19th centuries. The drastic social changes of that period, such as [[industrialization]], [[urbanization]], and the rise of [[democracy|democratic states]] caused particularly Western thinkers to become aware of society. The oldest sociological theories deal with broad historical processes relating to these changes. Since then, sociological theories have come to encompass most aspects of [[society]], including [[community|communities]], [[organization]]s and [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s.&lt;ref name="Calhoun2002-5"/&gt;

==Central theoretical problems==

Overall, there is a strong consensus regarding the central theoretical questions and the central problems that emerge from explicating such questions. Sociological theory attempts to answer the following three questions: (1) What is action? (2) What is social order? and (3) What determines social change? In the myriad attempts to answer these questions, three predominately theoretical (i.e. not empirical) problems emerge. These problems are largely inherited from the classical theoretical traditions. The consensus on the central theoretical problems is: how to link, transcend or cope with the following "big three" dichotomies:&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=vQbjnVBKRAkC&amp;pg=PP1 Rational Choice Theory: Resisting Colonization&lt;/ref&gt; [[subjectivity and objectivity]], [[structure and agency]], and [[synchrony and diachrony]]. The first deals with ''knowledge'', the second with ''agency'', and the last with ''time''. Lastly, sociological theory often grapples with the problem of integrating or transcending the divide between micro, meso and macro-scale social phenomena, which is a subset of all three central problems. These problems are not altogether empirical problems, rather they are epistemological: they arise from the conceptual imagery and analytical analogies that sociologists use to describe the complexity of social processes.

===Objectivity and subjectivity===
{{Main|Objectivity (science)|Objectivity (philosophy)|Subjectivity}}

The problem of subjectivity and objectivity can be divided into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions, and, on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge. In the former, the subjective is often equated (though not necessarily) with the individual, and the individual's intentions and interpretations of the objective. The objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome, on up to society writ large. A primary question for social theorists, is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective, that is to say: how is ''[[intersubjectivity]]'' achieved? While, historically, qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations, quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities. Also, some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description [[in situ]].

The latter concern with scientific knowledge results from the fact that a sociologist is part of the very object they seek to explain. Bourdieu puts this problem rather succinctly:

{{quote| How can the sociologist effect in practice this radical doubting which is indispensable for bracketing all the presuppositions inherent in the fact that she is a social being, that she is therefore socialized and led to feel "like a fish in water" within that social world whose structures she has internalized? How can she prevent the social world itself from carrying out the construction of the object, in a sense, through her, through these unself-conscious operations or operations unaware of themselves of which she is the apparent subject| Pierre Bourdieu|"The Problem of Reflexive Sociology" in ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology''&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Bourdieu, "The Problem of Reflexive Sociology" in ''An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology'', 1992, pg 235, 1992, pg 235&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Structure and agency===
{{Main|Structure and agency}}
Structure and agency, sometimes referred to as determinism versus voluntarism,&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=SMbNRp5EseMC&amp;pg=PA65 Realist Social Theory: The Morphogenetic Approach&lt;/ref&gt; form an enduring ontological debate in social theory: "Do social structures determine an individual's behaviour or does human agency?" In this context '[[agency (sociology)|agency]]' refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices, whereas '[[social structure|structure]]' relates to factors which limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals (such as social class, religion, gender, ethnicity, and so on). Discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological [[epistemology]] ("What is the social world made of?", "What is a cause in the social world, and what is an effect?").&lt;ref name="The Constitution of Society"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Giddens, A |title=The Constitution of Society|publisher=University of California Press |location=California |year=1996|pages=14–19|isbn= 978-0-520-05728-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A perennial question within this debate is that of "[[social reproduction]]": how are structures (specifically, structures producing inequality) reproduced through the choices of individuals?

===Synchrony and diachrony===

Synchrony and diachrony, or statics and dynamics, within social theory are terms that refer to a distinction emerging out of the work of [[Levi-Strauss]] who inherited it from the linguistics of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]].&lt;ref name="Lizardo, Omar 2010"&gt;Lizardo, Omar. "Beyond the antinomies of structure: Levi-Strauss, Giddens, Bourdieu, and Sewell." Theory and society 39.6 (2010): 651-688.&lt;/ref&gt; The former slices moments of time for analysis, thus it is an analysis of static social reality. Diachrony, on the other hand, attempts to analyze dynamic sequences. Following Saussure, synchrony would refer to social phenomena as a static concept like a ''language'', while diachrony would refer to unfolding processes like actual ''speech''. In Anthony Giddens' introduction to ''Central Problems in Social Theory'', he states that, "in order to show the interdependence of action and structure...we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction." And like structure and agency, time is integral to discussion of [[social reproduction]]. In terms of sociology, historical sociology is often better positioned to analyze social life as diachronic, while survey research takes a snapshot of social life and is thus better equipped to understand social life as synchronic. Some argue that the synchrony of social structure is a methodological perspective rather than an ontological claim.&lt;ref name="Lizardo, Omar 2010"/&gt; Nonetheless, the problem for theory is how to integrate the two manners of recording and thinking about social data.

==Classical theoretical traditions&lt;!--'Classical sociology' and 'Classical social theory' redirect here--&gt;==

The contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic.&lt;ref name="Abend"&gt;Abend, Gabriel. 2008. "The meaning of 'Theory'." Sociological Theory, 26:2&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Randall Collins]]' well-cited survey of sociological theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://wur.on.worldcat.org/oclc/782169682|title=Four sociological traditions : selected readings|first=Randall|last=Collins|date=6 May 1994|publisher=Oxford University Press|website=worldcat.org|accessdate=6 May 2018|isbn=9780195087024}}&lt;/ref&gt; he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: functionalism, conflict, symbolic interactionism, and utilitarianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.flatworldknowledge.com/bookhub/reader/2?e=barkbrief-ch01_s03|title=Sociology: Understanding and Changing the Social World, Brief Edition v1.0  -  FlatWorld|author=|date=|website=flatworldknowledge.com|accessdate=6 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centered (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural ([[Georg Simmel|Simmel]]) and [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] ([[George Herbert Mead|Mead]], [[Charles Cooley|Cooley]]) theories of social interaction. [[Utilitarianism]], also known as "rational choice" or "social exchange", although often associated with [[economics]], is an established tradition within sociological theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=2952549 |title=Archived copy }} Sociological Rational Choice Theory&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, James S., and Thomas J. Fararo. "Rational choice theory." Nueva York: Sage (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, as argued by [[Raewyn Connell]], a tradition that is often forgotten is that of [[social Darwinism]], which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=QZ_rAAAAMAAJ Southern theory: the global dynamics of knowledge in social science&lt;/ref&gt; This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Lester F. Ward]] and [[William Graham Sumner]]. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.

===Structural functionalism===
{{Anchor|Functionalism}}
{{Main|Structural functionalism}}
A broad historical paradigm in both sociology and [[anthropology]], functionalism addresses the [[social structure]] as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements. A common analogy (popularized by [[Herbert Spencer]]) is to regard [[norm (sociology)|norm]]s and [[institution]]s as 'organs' that work toward the proper-functioning of the entire 'body' of society.&lt;ref name="Sociology beyond societies: mobilities for the twenty-first century"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Urry |first=John |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ogyDBobOHVEC&amp;pg=PA23 |title=Sociology beyond societies: mobilities for the twenty-first century |chapter=Metaphors |publisher=Routledge |year=2000 |page=23 |isbn=978-0-415-19089-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of Comte, but was theorized in full by Durkheim, again with respect to observable, structural laws. Functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as [[Marcel Mauss]], [[Bronisław Malinowski]] and [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]]. It is in Radcliffe-Brown's specific usage that the prefix 'structural' emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/function.htm |title=Department of Anthropology College of Arts and Sciences The University of Alabama: Anthropological theories |publisher=As.ua.edu |accessdate=2011-11-04 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105202737/http://www.as.ua.edu/ant/Faculty/murphy/function.htm |archivedate=2011-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of [[social evolutionism]]. As [[Anthony Giddens|Giddens]] states: "Functionalist thought, from Comte onwards, has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science. Biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analyzing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation ... functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts (i.e. its constituent actors, human subjects)."&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, Anthony "The Constitution of Society" in ''The Giddens Reader'' Philip Cassell (eds.) MacMillan Press pp.88&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict theory===
{{Main|Conflict theories}}
[[Social conflict]] is the struggle between segments of society over valued resources.&lt;ref name="aghababa"/&gt; From the [https://books.google.co.in/books?id=YjGpDAAAQBAJ perspective of social conflict theory], in the West, by the nineteenth century, a small population had become capitalists. Capitalists are people who own and operate factories and other businesses in pursuit of profits. In other words, they own virtually all large-scale means of production. However, capitalism turned most other people into industrial workers, whom Marx called proletarians. Proletarians are people who, because of the structure of capitalist economy, must sell their labor for wages. Conflict theories draw attention to power differentials, such as class, gender and race conflict, and contrast historically dominant ideologies. It is therefore a macro level analysis of society that sees society as an arena of inequality that generates conflict and social change.&lt;ref name="Sociology"/&gt; Karl Marx is the father of the [[social conflict theory]], which is a component of the four major paradigms of sociology.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Other important sociologists associated with this theory include [[Harriet Martineau]], [[Jane Addams]] and [[W. E. B. Du Bois]]. This sociological approach doesn't look at how social structures help society to operate, but instead looks at how "social patterns" can cause some people in society to be dominant, and others to be oppressed.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed"/&gt; However, some criticisms to this theory are that it disregards how shared values and the way in which people rely on each other help to unify the society.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed"/&gt;

===Symbolic interactionism===
{{Main|Symbolic interactionism|Dramaturgy (sociology)|Interpretive sociology|Phenomenological sociology}}
[[Symbolic interaction]], often associated with [[interactionism]], [[phenomenological sociology]], [[dramaturgy]], and [[Antipositivism|interpretivism]], is a sociological tradition that places emphasis on subjective meanings and the empirical unfolding of social processes, generally accessed through analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, John J. (2012). Sociology 14th Edition. Boston: Pearson. p. 16. {{ISBN|978-0-205-11671-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach focuses on creating a framework for building a theory that sees society as the product of the everyday interactions of individuals. Society is nothing more than the shared reality that people construct as they interact with one another. This approach sees people interacting in countless settings using symbolic communications to accomplish the tasks at hand. Therefore, society is a complex, ever-changing mosaic of subjective meanings.&lt;ref&gt;Gerber, John J. Macionis, Linda M. ''Sociology'' (7th Canadian ed. ed.). Toronto: Pearson Canada. p. 19. {{ISBN|978-0-13-700161-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics of this approach argue that it only looks at what is happening in a particular social situation, and disregards the effects that culture, race or gender (i.e. social-historical structures) may have in that situation.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed"/&gt; Some important sociologists associated with this approach include [[Max Weber]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[George Homans]] and [[Peter Blau]]. It is also in this tradition that the radical-empirical approach of [[Ethnomethodology]] emerges from the work of [[Harold Garfinkel]].

===Utilitarianism===
{{Main| Utilitarianism|Rational choice theory|Exchange theory}}
 
Utilitarianism is often referred to as [[exchange theory]] or [[rational choice theory]] in the context of sociology. This tradition tends to privilege the agency of individual rational actors and assumes that within interactions individuals always seek to maximize their own self-interest. As argued by [[Josh Whitford]], rational actors are assumed to have four basic elements, the individual has (1) "a knowledge of alternatives," (2) "a knowledge of, or beliefs about the consequences of the various alternatives," (3) "an ordering of preferences over outcomes," (4) "A decision rule, to select amongst the possible alternatives".&lt;ref&gt;"Pragmatism and the untenable dualism of means and ends: Why rational choice theory does not deserve paradigmatic privilege" Theory and Society 31 (2002): 325-363.&lt;/ref&gt; Exchange theory is specifically attributed to the work of [[George C. Homans]], [[Peter Blau]] and [[Richard Emerson]].&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, R M. "Social Exchange Theory." Annual Review of Sociology 2.1 (1976): 335-362.&lt;/ref&gt; Organizational sociologists [[James G. March]] and [[Herbert A. Simon]] noted that an individual's [[bounded rationality|rationality is bounded]] by the context or organizational setting. The utilitarian perspective in sociology was, most notably, revitalized in the late 20th century by the work of former [[American Sociological Association|ASA]] president [[James Samuel Coleman|James Coleman]].

==List of contemporary theories==

[[Anomie theory]] seeks to understand ''[[normlessness]]'', where society provides little moral guidance to individuals.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 134"/&gt; Sociologist Emile Durkheim observed that social periods of disruption result in greater anomie and higher rates of suicide and crimes.&lt;ref name="sociology13"/&gt; Merton theorizes that [[anomie]] (normative breakdown) and some forms of [[Deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] derive largely from a disjunction between “culturally prescribed aspirations” of a society and “socially structured avenues for realizing those aspirations". In ''[[The Division of Labor in Society]]'', [[Durkheim]] described [[anomie]] as one result of an inequitable division of labour within the society. Broadly speaking, then, during times of great upheaval, increasing numbers of individuals "cease to accept the moral legitimacy of society,” as sociologist Anthony R. Mawson, University of Keele, UK, notes.&lt;ref name="sociology13"/&gt;

[[Critical theory]] is a lineage of sociological theory, with reference to such groups as the Frankfurt School, that aims to critique and change society and culture, not simply to document and understand it.&lt;ref name="sociology9"/&gt;

[[Dramaturgy (sociology)|Dramaturgy]] or dramaturgical perspective is a specialized symbolic interactionism paradigm developed by [[Erving Goffman]], seeing life as a performance. As "actors," we have a status, which is the part that we play, where we are given various roles.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 16"/&gt; These roles serve as a script, supplying dialogue and action for the characters (the people in reality).&lt;ref name="sociology10"/&gt; They also involve props and certain settings. For instance, a doctor (the role), uses instruments like a heart monitor (the prop), all the while using medical terms (the script), while in his doctor's office (the setting).&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 pp. 134"/&gt; In addition, our performance is the "presentation of self," which is how people perceive us, based on the ways in which we portray ourselves.&lt;ref name="sociology11"/&gt; This process, sometimes called impression management, begins with the idea of personal performance.&lt;ref name="dramaturgical"/&gt;

[[Engaged theory]] is an approach that seeks to understand the complexity of social life through synthesizing empirical research with more abstract layers of analysis, including analysis of modes of practice, and analysis of basic categories of existence such a time, space, embodiment, and knowledge.

[[Feminism]] is a collection of movements aimed at defining, establishing, and defending equal political, economic, and social rights for women.&lt;ref name="Feminism – Definition and More from the Free Merriam-Webster Dictionary"/&gt; The theory focuses on how [[gender inequality]] shapes social life.&lt;ref name="New Feminist Sociological Directions"/&gt; This approach shows how sexuality both reflects patterns of [[social inequality]] and helps to perpetuate them. Feminism, from a [[social conflict]] perspective, focuses on gender inequality and links sexuality to the domination of women by men.&lt;ref name="Sociology5"/&gt;

[[Field theory (sociology)|Field theory]] examines social fields, which are social environments in which competition takes place (e.g., the field of electronics manufacturers). It is concerned with how individuals construct such fields, with how the fields are structured, and with the effects the field has on people occupying different positions in it.

[[Grounded theory]] is a systematic methodology in the social sciences involving the generation of theory from data.&lt;ref name="fsu"/&gt;

[[Interpretive sociology]] is a theoretical perspective based on the work of Max Weber, proposes that social, economic and historical research can never be fully empirical or descriptive as one must always approach it with a conceptual apparatus.&lt;ref name="Gerber, John J 2010 pp. 132"/&gt;

[[Middle range theory (sociology)|Middle range theory]] is an approach to sociological theorizing aimed at integrating theory and empirical research. It is currently the de facto dominant approach to sociological theory construction, especially in the United States. Middle range theory starts with an empirical phenomenon (as opposed to a broad abstract entity like the social system) and abstracts from it to create general statements that can be verified by data.&lt;ref name="structure"/&gt;

[[Mathematical sociology|Mathematical theory]], also known as formal theory, is the use of [[mathematics]] to construct social theories. Mathematical sociology aims to take sociological theory, which is strong in intuitive content but weak from a formal point of view, and to express it in formal terms. The benefits of this approach include increased clarity and the ability to use mathematics to derive implications of a theory that cannot be arrived at intuitively. The models typically used in mathematical sociology allow sociologists to understand how predictable local interactions are often able to elicit global patterns of social structure.&lt;ref name="formalization"/&gt;

[[Positivism]] is a philosophy developed by [[Auguste Comte]] in the middle of the 19th century that stated that the only authentic knowledge is [[scientific knowledge]], and that such knowledge can only come from positive affirmation of theories through strict [[scientific method]].&lt;ref name="educational"/&gt; Society operates according to laws like the physical world. Introspective and [[intuitional]] attempts to gain knowledge are rejected. The positivist approach has been a recurrent theme in the history of [[western thought]], from ancient times to the present day.

[[Network theory]] is a structural approach to sociology that is most closely associated with the work of [[Harrison White]], who views norms and behaviors as embedded in chains of social relations.&lt;ref name="Gerber, John J 2010 pp. 132"/&gt;

[[Phenomenological sociology]] is an approach within the field of sociology that aims to reveal what role human awareness plays in the production of social action, social situations and social worlds. In essence, phenomenology is the belief that society is a human construction. The social phenomenology of [[Alfred Schütz]] influenced the development of the [[social constructionism]] and [[ethnomethodology]]. It was originally developed by [[Edmund Husserl]].

[[Post-colonial theory]] is a post-modern approach that consists of the reactions to and the analysis of colonialism.

[[Postmodernism]] is a theoretical perspective approach that criticises [[modernism]], instead adhering to anti-theory and anti-method, and has a great mistrust of [[Grand theory|grand theories]] and ideologies. Due to human subjectivity, theorists believe that discovering the objective truth is impossible or unachievable.&lt;ref name="MacionisandGerber2011-10"/&gt; This is due to a perspective that sees society as ever-changing along with the assumption that truth is constantly subject to change. A post-modern theorist's purpose is to achieve understanding through observation, rather than data collection. This approach uses both micro and macro level analysis.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 53"/&gt; A question that is asked by this approach would be, "How do we understand societies or interpersonal relations, while rejecting the theories and methods of the social sciences, and our assumptions about human nature? or How does power permeate social relations or society, and change with the circumstances? "&lt;ref name="sociology10"/&gt; An example of a prominent postmodernist is the French philosopher [[Michael Foucault]].

[[Pure sociology]] is a theoretical paradigm developed by [[Donald Black (sociologist)|Donald Black]] that explains variation in social life with [[social geometry]], that is, locations in social space. A recent extension of this idea is that fluctuations in social space — called social time — are the cause of social conflict.&lt;ref name="Black, Donald 2011"/&gt;

[[Rational choice theory]] models social behavior as the interaction of utility maximizing individuals. "Rational" implies cost-effectiveness is balanced against cost to accomplish a utility maximizing interaction. Costs are extrinsic, meaning intrinsic values such as feelings of guilt will not be accounted for in the cost to commit a crime.

[[Social constructionism]] is a sociological theory of knowledge that considers how social phenomena develop in particular social contexts.&lt;ref name="interpretive"/&gt;

[[Socialization]] theory is an approach to understanding the means by which human infants begin to acquire the skills necessary to perform as a functional member of their society&lt;ref name="sociological"/&gt; Sociologists use the term socialization to refer to the lifelong social experience by which people develop their human potential and learn culture. Unlike other living species, humans need socialization within their cultures for survival.&lt;ref name="Macionis, John J. 2011"/&gt;

[[Social exchange theory]] says that the interaction that occurs between people can be partly based on what someone may "gain and lose" by being with others. For example, when people think about who they may date, they'll look to see if the other person will offer just as much (or perhaps more) than they do. This can include judging an individual's looks and appearance, or their social status.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed"/&gt;

[[Thomas theorem]] refers to situations that are defined as real are real in their consequences.&lt;ref name="contemporary"/&gt; Suggests that the reality people construct in their interaction has real consequences for the future. For example, a teacher who believes a certain student to be intellectually gifted may well encourage exceptional academic performance.&lt;ref name="organizational"/&gt;

==Theories in subfields of sociology==

===Criminology===
[[File:Scale of justice 2.svg|thumb|left|200px|alt=text|'''Criminology''' - The scientific study of crime and criminals]]
{{Main|Criminology}}
* The general [[theory of crime]]: States that the main factor behind criminal behaviour is the individual's lack of [[self-control]].
* [[Differential association]] theory: The theory was developed by [[Edwin Sutherland]] and it examines the acts of a criminal from the perspective that they are learned behaviours.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed37"/&gt;
* [[Labeling theory]]: It is the main idea that deviance and conformity result not so much from what people do as from how others respond to these actions.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 203"/&gt; It also states that a society's reaction to specific behaviors are a major determinant of how a person may come to adopt a "deviant" label.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed38"/&gt; This theory stresses the relativity of deviance, the idea that people may define the same behavior in any number of ways. Thus the labelling theory is a micro-level analysis and is often classified in the social-interactionist approach.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 203"/&gt; Bryant, Lee. [http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/labelling_theory.htm "The Labelling Theory"], History Learning Site, 2000-2012, retrieved March 13, 2013.
* [[Control theory]]: The theory was developed by [[Travis Hirschi]] and it states that a weak bond between an individual and society itself allows the individual to defy societal norms and adopt behaviors that are deviant in nature.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed39"/&gt;
* [[Rational choice theory]]: States that people commit crimes when it is rational for them to do so according to analyses of costs and benefits, and that crime can be reduced by minimizing benefits and maximizing costs to the "would be" criminal.
* [[Social disorganization theory]]: States that crime is more likely to occur in areas where social institutions are unable to directly control groups of individuals.
* [[Social learning theory]]: States that people adopt new behaviors through observational learning in their environments.&lt;ref name="psychology"/&gt;
* [[Strain theory (sociology)|Strain theory]]: States that a social structure within a society may cause people to commit crimes. Specifically, the extent and type of deviance people engage in depend on whether a society provides the means to achieve cultural goals.&lt;ref name="Sociology 14th Edition"/&gt;
* [[Subcultural theory]]: States that behavior is influenced by factors such as class, ethnicity, and family status. This theory's primary focus is on juvenile delinquency.
* [[Psychopath]]: serious criminals who do not feel shame or guilt from their actions. They do not fear punishment and have little sympathy for the people they harm.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed40"/&gt; These individuals are said to have a psychological disorder as psychopathy or antisocial personality disorder. They exhibit a variety of maladaptive traits such as rarely experiencing genuine affection for others. They are skilled at faking affection, are irresponsible, impulsive, tolerate little frustration and they pursue immediate gratification.&lt;ref name="Psychology themes &amp; variations 2nd Canadian Ed"/&gt; Robert Hare, one of the world's leading experts on psychopathy, developed an important assessment device for psychopathy, the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised. For many, this measure is the single, most important advancement to date toward what will hopefully become our ultimate understanding of psychopathy (McCann, Weiten, 641).
* [[Containment theory]]: when an individual has a stronger conscience it will make one more tolerable to frustrations and therefore are less likely to be involved in criminal activities.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 198–199"/&gt;
* [[White-collar crime]]: defined by [[Edwin Sutherland]] as crime committed by persons of high social position in the course of their occupation (Sutherland and Cressey, 1978:44).&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 206"/&gt; The white-collar crime involves people making use of their occupational position to enrich themselves and others illegally, which often causes public harm.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 206"/&gt; In white-collar crime, public harm wreaked by false advertising, marketing of unsafe products, embezzlement, and bribery of public officials is more extensive than most people think, most of which go unnoticed and unpunished.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 206"/&gt;
* [[Corporate crime]]: refers to the illegal actions of a corporation or people acting on its behalf. Corporate crime ranges from knowingly selling faulty or dangerous products to purposely polluting the environment. Like white-collar crime, most cases of corporate crime go unpunished, and many are not never even known to the public.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 206"/&gt;
* [[Organized crime]]: a business that supplies illegal goods or services, including sex, drugs, and gambling.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 206"/&gt; This type of crime expanded among immigrants, who found that society was not always willing to share its opportunities with them.&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 206"/&gt; A famous example of organized crime is the [[Italian Mafia]].&lt;ref name="Macionis and Gerber 2010 206"/&gt;
* [[Hate crime]]: a criminal act against a person or a person's property by an offender motivated by racial, ethnic, religious or other bias. Hate crimes may refer to race, ancestry, religion, sexual orientation and physical disabilities. According to a [[Statistics Canada]] publication, "Jewish" community has been the most likely the victim of [[hate crime in Canada]] during 2001-2002. Overall, about 57 percent of hate crimes are motivated by ethnicity and race, targeting mainly Blacks and Asians, while 43 percent target religion, mainly Judaism and Islam. A relatively small 9 percent is motivated by sexual orientation, targets gays and lesbians.&lt;ref name="Sociology 7th Canadian Ed41"/&gt;

Physical traits do not distinguish criminals from non criminals, but genetic factors together with environmental factors are strong [[Crime prediction|predictors]] of adult crime and violence.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 198–199"/&gt; Most psychologists see deviance as the result of "unsuccessful" socialization and abnormality in an individual personality.&lt;ref name="Macionis, Gerber 2010 198–199"/&gt;

===Sociology of science and technology===
{{Main|Sociology of scientific knowledge}}
Sociologists have been active in developing theories about the nature of science and technology:
* "Institutional" sociology of science ([[Robert K. Merton]]) (1960s)
* [[Social construction of technology]] (1980s) − variant of SSK focusing on technology studies
* [[Actor-network theory]] (1980s)
* [[Normalization process theory]] (2000s)
* [[Theories of technology]]

===Social movements===
[[File:Martin Luther King - March on Washington.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=text|[[American Civil Rights Movement]] is one of the most famous social movements of the 20th century. Here, [[Martin Luther King]] is giving his "[[I Have a Dream]]" speech, in front of the [[Lincoln Memorial]] during the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]]]
{{Main|Social movement}}
Sociologists have developed various theories about social movements [Kendall, 2005]. Chronologically (by approximate date of origin) they include:
* [[Collective behavior]]/[[collective action]] theories (1950s)
* [[Relative deprivation theory]] (1960s)
* [[Value-added theory]] (1960s)
* [[Resource mobilization]]/[[political process]] theory (1970s)
* [[Framing (social sciences)|Frame analysis theory]] (1970s)
* [[New social movement theory]] (1980s)
* New [[cultural theory]] (1990s) — [[James M. Jasper]], [[Jeff Goodwin]] et al.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8239">The imitation of [[natural sounds]] in various cultures is a diverse phenomenon and can fill in various functions. In several instances, it is related to the belief system ([[yoik]]s of the [[Sami people|Sami]],&lt;ref name=shamyoik&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 56, 76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spell&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ykt&gt;[http://www.uit.no/ssweb/dok/Somby/Ande/95.htm Somby 1995] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20080325110925/http://www.uit.no/ssweb/dok/Somby/Ande/95.htm |date=2008-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yoikbel&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 74&lt;/ref&gt; some other shamanic songs and rituals,&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=calf&gt;Hoppál 2005: 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bear&gt;[http://haldjas.folklore.ee/~aado/tent.htm Lintrop]&lt;/ref&gt; [[overtone singing]] of some cultures). It may serve also such practical goals as luring in the hunt;&lt;ref name=natt/&gt; or entertainment ([[katajjaq]]s of [[Inuit]]).&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;&lt;ref name=desch/&gt;

Among some peoples of the [[Altai-Sayan region]], including [[Tofalar|Tofa]], the ability to mimic sounds of the environment includes hunting calls, and is present also in a traditional singing tradition preserved only by some old people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Song ond sound mimesis|publisher=Foundation for Endangered Languages |url=http://www.ogmios.org/164.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fields ==
=== Shamanism ===
{{Main|Imitation of sounds in shamanism}}
[[Shamanism]] in various cultures shows great diversity.&lt;ref name=div&gt;Hoppál 2005: 15&lt;/ref&gt; In some cultures, the music or songs related to shamanistic practice may mimic natural sounds, sometimes with [[onomatopoiea]].&lt;ref name=onom&gt;[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf  Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Entertainment ===

The intention to mimic natural sounds is not necessarily linked to shamanistic beliefs or practice alone. [[Katajjaq]] (a "genre" of [[Inuit music|music of some Inuit groups]]) is a game played by women, for entertainment. In some instances, [[natural sounds]] (mostly those of animals, e.g. geese) are imitated.&lt;ref name=natt&gt;Nattiez: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desch&gt;[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm Deschênes 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Luring animals ===

The kind of [[katajjaq]] mentioned above, which mimics the cry of geese, shows some similarities with the practice of the hunters to lure game.&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;

Some Eskimo peoples used a tool (shaped like a claw) to scratch the ice of the frozen sea in order to attract seals.&lt;ref&gt;Burch &amp; Forman 1988: 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Birket-Smith 1969: 127&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''subvariety''' (Latin: '''''subvarietas''''') in [[botanical nomenclature]] is a [[taxonomic rank]]. They are rarely used to classify organisms.

==Plant taxonomy==
Subvariety is ranked: 
*below that of [[Variety (biology)|variety]] (''varietas'')
*above that of [[Form (botany)|form]] (''forma'').

Subvariety is an [[infraspecific taxon]]. 
===Name===
Its name consists of three parts: 
#a genus name (genera)
#a specific epithet (species)
#an infraspecific epithet  (subvariety)

To indicate the subvariety rank, the abbreviation '''"subvar."''' is put before the infraspecific epithet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6871">'''Sustainable land management''' (SLM&lt;ref name=worldbank/&gt;) refers to practices and technologies that aim to integrate the [[land management|management of land]], [[water management|water]], [[biodiversity]], and other [[Environmental resource management|environmental resource]]s to meet human needs while ensuring the long-term [[sustainability]] of [[ecosystem]] services and livelihoods. The term sustainable land management is used, for example, in [[regional planning]] and [[soil]] or [[environmental protection]], as well as in property and estate management.

== Examples ==

The [[World Bank]] defines sustainable land management as a process in a charged environment between [[environmental protection]] and the guarantee claim of [[ecosystem services]] on the one hand. On the other hand, it is about productivity of [[agriculture]] and [[forestry]] with respect to [[demographic growth]] and increasing pressure in [[land consumption|land use]].

{{quote|SLM is defined as a knowledge-based procedure that helps integrate land, water, biodiversity, and environmental management (including input and output externalities) to meet rising food and fiber demands while sustaining ecosystem services and livelihoods. SLM is necessary to meet the requirements of a growing
population. Improper land management can lead to [[land degradation]] and a significant reduction in the productive and service (biodiversity niches, [[hydrology]], [[carbon sequestration]]) functions of watersheds and landscapes."&lt;ref name=worldbank&gt;[https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstream/handle/10986/7132/366540PAPER0Su11PUBLIC0as0of0July71.txt?sequence=2 The World Bank (2006): Sustainable Land Management. Challenges, Opportunities, and Trade-offs. Washington, DC]&lt;/ref&gt;|The World Bank}}
  
The [[United Nations Economic Commission for Europe]] (UNECE) applies the term in a much wider context. Besides agriculture and forestry they include the mineral extraction sector, property and estate management.

{{quote|Land management is the process by which the resources of land are put to good effect. It covers all activities concerned with the management of land as a resource both from an environmental and from an economic perspective. It can include farming, mineral extraction, property and estate management, and the physical planning of towns and the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1996|title=Land Administration Guideline. With Special Reference to Countries in Transition|publisher=UN Economic Commission for Europe, Geneva, ECE/HBP/96|url=http://www.unece.org/fileadmin/DAM/hlm/documents/Publications/land.administration.guidelines.e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the course of national politics and programmes, few [[Europe]]an states use the terminology "sustainable land management". Here [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] are to be mentioned, as both countries have agreed on sustainable land management with respect to climate change as part of their government programmes.&lt;ref&gt;vgl. Australian Government – Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities&lt;/ref&gt;

In the European context, the definition of the European Network for Land Use Management for Sustainable European Cities (LUMASEC)&lt;ref&gt;http://urbact.eu/en/projects/metropolitan-governance/lumasec/homepage&lt;/ref&gt; may be used as a reference. It emphasizes the inter- and transdisciplinary cooperation on sustainable land management:  

{{quote|As management is the human activity meaning the action of people working together in the aim to accomplish desired goals, land use management is a process of managing use and development of land, in which spatial, sector-oriented and temporary aspects of urban policy are coordinated. Resources of land are used for different purposes, which may produce conflicts and competitions, and land use management has to see those purposes in an integrated way. Therefore, land management covers the debate about norms and visions driving the policy-making, sector-based planning both in the strategic and more operative time spans, spatial integration of sectoral issues, decision-making, budgeting, implementation of plans and decisions and the monitoring of results and evaluation of impacts.&lt;ref&gt;Didier Vancutsem (LEAD Expert): 2008 Land Use Management for Sustainable European Cities&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Research examples==

Since 2010, the [[German Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] (BMBF) funds an international research program on "sustainable land management".&lt;ref&gt;Weith, T., Schulz, K., Gaasch, N., Seppelt, R., Werntze, A., Eppink, F. (2010): Towards Integration: Sustainable Land Management. A new German Research Funding Measure&lt;/ref&gt; Module A of the program investigates interactions between land management, [[climate change]], and ecosystem services.&lt;ref&gt;Seppelt, R., Dormann, C., Eppink, F. V., Lautenbach, S., Schmidt, S. (2011): A quantitative review of ecosystem studies: Approaches, shortcomings and the road ahead, Journal of Applied Ecology&lt;/ref&gt; It includes projects operating in [[South America]], [[Africa]], Europe, [[Central Asia]], and [[South Asia]]. Module B seeks "innovative system solutions" in 13 projects with a Central European focus.

Furthermore, [[Economics of Land Degradation Initiative | the Economics of Land Degradation (ELD) Initiative]] seeks to establish a cost benefit analysis on the practice of sustainable land management highlighting its economic benefits. This economic analysis will enable decision makers to take appropriate measures combat [[land degradation]] globally. Additionally, the Initiative supports regional case studies focusing on [[Africa]] and [[Central Asia]].

The '''symbol grounding problem''' is related to the problem of how [[word]]s  ([[symbol]]s) get their [[Meaning (psychology)|meanings]], and hence to the problem of what meaning itself really is. The problem of meaning is in turn related to the problem of [[consciousness]], or how it is that [[mental state]]s are meaningful.

==Background==

===Referents===
[[Gottlob Frege]] distinguished a referent (the thing that a word refers to) and the word's meaning. This is most clearly illustrated using the proper names of concrete individuals, but it is also true of names of kinds of things and of abstract properties: (1) "Tony Blair", (2) "the prime minister of the UK during the year 2004", and (3) "Cherie Blair's husband" all have the same referent, but not the same meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Although this article draws in places upon Frege's view of semantics,  it is very anti-Fregean in stance. Frege was a fierce critic of psychological accounts that attempt to explain meaning in terms of mental states.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that the meaning of a (referring) word is the rule or features that one must use in order to successfully pick out its referent. In that respect, (2) and (3) come closer to wearing their meanings on their sleeves, because they are explicitly stating a rule for picking out their referents: "Find whoever was prime minister of the UK during the year 2004", or "find whoever is Cherie's current husband". But that does not settle the matter, because there's still the problem of the meaning of the components of that rule ("UK," "during", "current", "PM", "Cherie", "husband"), and how to pick ''them'' out.

The phrase "Tony Blair" (or better still, just "Tony") does not have this recursive component problem, because it points straight to its referent, but how? If the meaning is the rule for picking out the referent, what is that rule, when we come down to non-decomposable components like proper names of individuals (or names of ''kinds'', as in "an unmarried man" is a "bachelor")?

===Referential process===

Humans are able to pick out the intended referents of words{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}, such as "Tony Blair" or "bachelor," but this process need not be explicit.  It is probably an unreasonable expectation to know the explicit [[Philosophical Investigations#Rules|rule]] for picking out the intended referents{{why|date=October 2016}}.

So if we take a word's meaning to be the means of picking out its referent, then meanings are in our brains. That is meaning in the ''narrow'' sense. If we use "meaning" in a ''wider'' sense, then we may want to say that meanings include both the referents themselves and the means of picking them out. So if a word (say, "Tony-Blair") is located inside an entity (e.g., oneself) that can use the word and pick out its referent, then the word's wide meaning consists of both the means that that entity uses to pick out its referent, and the referent itself: a wide causal nexus between (1) a head, (2) a word inside it, (3) an object outside it, and (4) whatever "processing" is required in order to successfully connect the inner word to the outer object.

But what if the "entity" in which a word is located is not a head but a piece of paper (or a computer screen)? What is its meaning then? Surely all the (referring) words on this screen, for example, have meanings, just as they have referents.

In the 19th century, the semiotician [[Charles Saunders Peirce]] suggested what some think is a similar model: according to his triadic sign model, meaning requires (1) an interpreter, (2) a sign or representamen, (3) an object, and is (4) the virtual product of an endless regress and progress called [[Semiosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Charles S. The philosophy of Peirce: selected writings. New York: AMS Press, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Some have interpreted Peirce as addressing the problem of grounding, feelings, and intentionality for the understanding of semiotic processes.&lt;ref&gt;Semeiosis and Intentionality T. L. Short Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Vol. 17, No. 3 (Summer, 1981), pp. 197-223&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, Peirce's theory of signs has been rediscovered by an increasing number of artificial intelligence researchers in the context of symbol grounding problem.&lt;ref&gt;C.S. Peirce and artificial intelligence: historical heritage and (new) theoretical stakes; Pierre Steiner; SAPERE - Special Issue on Philosophy and Theory of AI 5:265-276 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grounding process ===

{{expand section|date=October 2016}}

There would be no connection at all between written symbols and any intended referents if there were no minds mediating those intentions, via their own internal means of picking out those intended referents.

So the meaning of a word on a page is "ungrounded."&lt;ref&gt;Or, "imputed" as read below the dotted baseline of the [[triangle of reference]] since 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor would looking it up in a dictionary help: If one tried to look up the meaning of a word one did not understand in a [[dictionary]] of a language one did not already understand, one would just cycle endlessly from one meaningless definition to another. One's search for meaning would be ungrounded.

In contrast, the meaning of the words in one's head—those words one ''does'' understand—are "grounded"{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. That mental grounding of the meanings of words mediates between the words on any external page one reads (and understands) and the external objects to which those words refer.&lt;ref&gt;This is the [[causal theory of reference|causal]], [[contextual theory of reference]] that [[C. K. Ogden|Ogden]] &amp; [[I. A. Richards|Richards]] packed in ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'' (1923).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [[semantic externalism]] as claimed in "The Meaning of 'Meaning'" of ''Mind, Language and Reality'' (1975) by [[Hilary Putnam|Putnam]] who argues: "Meanings just ain't in the head." Now he and [[Michael Dummett|Dummett]] seem to favor [[anti-realism]] in favor of [[intuitionism]], [[psychologism]], [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivism]] and [[contextualism]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requirements for symbol grounding===

Another symbol system is [[natural language]] (Fodor 1975). On paper or in a computer, language, too, is just a formal symbol system, manipulable by rules based on the arbitrary shapes of words. But in the brain, meaningless strings of squiggles become meaningful thoughts. Harnad has suggested two properties that might be required to make this difference:

*capacity to pick referents
*consciousness

====Capacity to pick out referents====
One property that static paper or, usually, even a dynamic computer lack that the brain possesses is the capacity to pick out symbols' referents. This is what we were discussing earlier, and it is what the hitherto undefined term "grounding" refers to. A symbol system alone, whether static or dynamic, cannot have this capacity (any more than a book can), because picking out referents is not just a computational (implementation-independent) property; it is a dynamical (implementation-dependent) property.

To be grounded, the symbol system would have to be augmented with nonsymbolic, sensorimotor capacities—the capacity to interact autonomously with that world of objects, events, actions, properties and states that its symbols are systematically interpretable (by us) as referring to. It would have to be able to pick out the referents of its symbols, and its sensorimotor interactions with the world would have to fit coherently with the symbols' interpretations.

The symbols, in other words, need to be connected directly to (i.e., grounded in) their referents; the connection must not be dependent only on the connections made by the brains of external interpreters like us. Just the symbol system alone, without this capacity for direct grounding, is not a viable candidate for being whatever it is that is really going on in our brains when we think meaningful thoughts (Cangelosi &amp; Harnad 2001).

Meaning as the ability to recognize instances (of objects) or perform actions is specifically treated in the paradigm called "Procedural Semantics", described in a number of papers including "Procedural Semantics" by Philip N.  Johnson-Laird &lt;ref&gt;Philip N.  Johnson-Laird  "Procedural Semantics" (Cognition, 5  (1977) 189; see http://www.nyu.edu/gsas/dept/philo/courses/mindsandmachines/Papers/procedural.pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; and expanded by William A. Woods in "Meaning and Links".&lt;ref&gt;William A. Woods. "Meaning and Links" (AI Magazine Volume 28 Number 4 (2007); see http://www.aaai.org/ojs/index.php/aimagazine/article/view/2069/2056)&lt;/ref&gt;  A brief summary in Woods' paper reads: "The idea of procedural semantics is that the semantics of natural language sentences can be characterized in a formalism whose meanings are defined by abstract procedures that a computer (or a person) can either execute or reason about. In this theory the meaning of a noun is a procedure for recognizing or generating instances, the meaning of a proposition is a procedure for determining if it is true or false, and the meaning of an action is the ability to do the action or to tell if it has been done."

====Consciousness====
The necessity of groundedness, in other words, takes us from the level of the pen-pal [[Turing test]], which is purely symbolic (computational), to the robotic Turing test, which is hybrid symbolic/sensorimotor (Harnad 2000, 2007). Meaning is grounded in the robotic capacity to detect, categorize, identify, and act upon the things that words and sentences refer to (see entries for [[Affordance]] and for [[Categorical perception]]). On the other hand, if the symbols (words and sentences) refer to the very bits of '0' and '1', directly connected to their electronic implementations, which a (any?) computer system can readily manipulate (thus detect, categorize, identify and act upon), then even non-robotic computer systems could be said to be "sensorimotor" and hence able to "ground" symbols in this narrow domain. 

To categorize is to do the right thing with the right ''kind'' of thing. The categorizer must be able to detect the sensorimotor features of the members of the category that reliably distinguish them from the nonmembers. These feature-detectors must either be inborn or learned. The learning can be based on trial and error induction, guided by feedback from the consequences of correct and incorrect categorization; or, in our own linguistic species, the learning can also be based on verbal descriptions or definitions. The description or definition of a new category, however, can only convey the category and ground its name if the words in the definition are themselves already grounded category names (Blondin-Massé et al. 2008). So ultimately grounding has to be sensorimotor, to avoid infinite regress (Harnad 2005).

But if groundedness is a necessary condition for meaning, is it a sufficient one? Not necessarily, for it is possible that even a robot that could pass the Turing test, "living" amongst the rest of us indistinguishably for a lifetime, would fail to have in its head what Searle has in his: It could be a [[Philosophical zombie|zombie]], with no one home, feeling feelings, meaning meanings (Harnad 1995). However, it is possible that different interpreters (including different intelligent species of animals) would have different mechanisms for producing meaning in their systems, thus one cannot require that a system different from a human "experiences" meaning in the same way that a human does, and vice-versa. 

Harnad thus points at consciousness as a second property. The problem of discovering the causal mechanism for successfully picking out the referent of a category name can in principle be solved by cognitive science. But the problem of explaining how consciousness could play an "independent" role in doing so is probably insoluble, except on pain of [[Psychokinesis|telekinetic]] [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualism]]. Perhaps symbol grounding (i.e., robotic TT capacity) is enough to ensure that conscious meaning is present, but then again, perhaps not. In either case, there is no way we can hope to be any the wiser—and that is Turing's methodological point (Harnad 2001b, 2003, 2006).

==Formulation==
To answer this question we have to formulate the symbol grounding problem itself [http://cogprints.org/3106/ (Harnad 1990)]:

{{expand section|date=October 2016}}

==Functionalism==

There is a school of thought according to which the computer is more like the brain—or rather, the brain is more like the computer: According to this view (called "[[Computational theory of mind|computationalism]]", a variety of [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]]), the future theory explaining how the brain picks out its referents (the theory that cognitive neuroscience may eventually arrive at) will be a purely computational one (Pylyshyn 1984). A computational theory is a theory at the software level. It is essentially a computer algorithm: a set of rules for manipulating symbols. And the algorithm is "implementation-independent." That means that whatever it is that an algorithm is doing, it will do the same thing no matter what hardware it is executed on. The physical details of the [[dynamical system]] implementing the computation are irrelevant to the computation itself, which is purely formal; any hardware that can run the computation will do, and all physical implementations of that particular computer algorithm are equivalent, computationally.

A computer can execute any computation. Hence once computationalism finds a proper computer algorithm, one that our brain could be running when there is meaning transpiring in our heads, meaning will be transpiring in that computer too, when it implements that algorithm.

How would we know that we have a proper computer algorithm? It would have to be able to pass the [[Turing test]]. That means it would have to be capable of corresponding with any human being as a pen-pal, for a lifetime, without ever being in any way distinguishable from a real human pen-pal.

==Searle's Chinese room argument==
{{main|Chinese room}}
[[John Searle]] formulated the "[[Chinese room]] argument" in order to disprove computationalism{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}. The Chinese room argument is based on a thought experiment: in it, Searle stated that if the Turing test were conducted in Chinese, then he himself, Searle (who does not understand Chinese), could execute a program that implements the same algorithm that the computer was using without knowing what any of the words he was manipulating meant. 

At first glance, it would seem that if there's no meaning going on inside Searle's head when he is implementing that program, then there's no meaning going on inside the computer when it is the one implementing the algorithm either, computation being implementation-independent. But on a closer look, for a person to execute the same program that a computer would, at very least it would  have to have access to a similar bank of memory that the computer has (most likely externally stored). This means that the new computational system that executes the same algorithm is no longer just Searle's original head, but that plus the memory bank (and possibly other devices). 
In particular, this additional memory could store a digital representation of the intended referent of different words (like images, sounds, even video sequences), that the algorithm would use as a model of, and to derive features assotiated with, the intended referent. The "meaning" then is not to be searched in just Searle's original brain, but in the overall system needed to process the algorithm. (Just like when Searle is reading English words, the meaning is not to be located in isolated logical processing areas of the brain, but probably in the overall brain, likely including specific long-term memory areas). 
Thus, Searle's not perceiving any meaning in his head alone when simulating the work of a computer, does not imply lack of meaning in the overall system, and thus in the actual computer system passing an advanced Turing test.

=== Implications ===
How does Searle know that there is no meaning going on in his head when he is executing such a Turing-test-passing program? Exactly the same way he knows whether there is or is not meaning going on inside his head under any other conditions: He ''understands'' the words of English, whereas the Chinese symbols that he is manipulating according to the algorithm's rules mean nothing whatsoever to him (and there is no one else in his head for them to mean anything to). However, the complete system that is manipulating those Chinese symbols - which is not just Searle's brain, as explained in the previous section - may have the ability to extract meaning from those symbols, in the sense of being able to use  internal (memory) models of the intended referents, pick out the intended referents of those symbols, and generally identifying and using their features appropriately.

Note that in pointing out that the Chinese words would be meaningless to him under those conditions, Searle has appealed to consciousness. Otherwise one could argue that there ''would'' be meaning going on in Searle's  head under those conditions, but that Searle himself would simply not be conscious of it. That is called the [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/#4.1 "Systems Reply"] to Searle's Chinese Room Argument, and Searle [http://cogprints.org/4023/ rejects] the Systems Reply as being merely a reiteration, in the face of negative evidence, of the very thesis (computationalism) that is on trial in his thought-experiment: "Are words in a running computation like the ungrounded words on a page, meaningless without the mediation of brains, or are they like the grounded words in brains?"

In this either/or question, the (still undefined) word "ungrounded" has implicitly relied on the difference between inert words on a page and consciously meaningful words in our heads. And Searle is asserting that under these conditions (the Chinese Turing test), the words in his head would not be consciously meaningful, hence they would still be as ungrounded as the inert words on a page.

So if Searle is right, that (1) both the words on a page and those in any running computer program (including a Turing-test-passing computer program) are meaningless in and of themselves, and hence that (2) whatever it is that the brain is doing to generate meaning can't be just implementation-independent computation, then what ''is'' the brain doing to generate meaning [http://cogprints.org/4023/ (Harnad 2001a)]?

==Brentano's notion of intentionality==
"[[Intentionality]]" has been called the "mark of the mental" because of some observations by the philosopher [[Franz Brentano|Brentano]] to the effect that mental states always have an inherent, intended (mental) object or content toward which they are "directed": One sees something, wants something, believes something, desires something, understands something, means something etc., and that object is always something that one has ''in mind''. Having a mental object is part of having anything in mind. Hence it is the mark of the mental. There are no "free-floating" mental states that do not also have a mental object. Even hallucinations and imaginings have an object, and even feeling depressed feels like something. Nor is the object the "external" physical object, when there is one. One may see a real chair, but the "intentional" object of one's "intentional state" is the mental chair one has in mind. (Yet another term for intentionality has been "aboutness" or "representationality": thoughts are always ''about'' something; they are (mental) "representations" ''of''  something; but that something is what it is that the thinker has in mind, not whatever external object may or may not correspond to it.)

If this all sounds like skating over the surface of a problem rather than a real break-through, then the foregoing description has had its intended effect: No, the problem of intentionality is not the symbol grounding problem; nor is grounding symbols the solution to the problem of intentionality. The symbols inside an autonomous dynamical symbol system that is able to pass the robotic Turing test are grounded, in that, unlike in the case of an ungrounded symbol system, they do not depend on the mediation of the mind of an external interpreter to connect them to the external objects that they are interpretable (by the interpreter) as being "about"; the connection is autonomous, direct, and unmediated. But ''grounding is not meaning''. Grounding is an input/output performance function. Grounding connects the sensory inputs from external objects to internal symbols and states occurring within an autonomous sensorimotor system, guiding the system's resulting processing and output.

Meaning, in contrast, is something mental. But to try to put a halt to the name-game of proliferating nonexplanatory synonyms for the mind/body problem without solving it (or, worse, implying that there is more than one mind/body problem), let us cite just one more thing that requires no further explication: ''feeling''. The only thing that distinguishes an internal state that merely has grounding from one that has meaning is that it ''feels like something'' to be in the meaning state, whereas it does not feel like anything to be in the merely grounded functional state. Grounding is a functional matter; feeling is a felt matter. And that is the real source of Brentano's vexed peekaboo relation between "intentionality" and its internal "intentional object":  All mental states, in addition to being the functional states of an autonomous dynamical system, are also feeling states: Feelings are not merely "functed," as all other physical states are; feelings are also felt.

Hence feeling ([[sentience]]) is the real mark of the mental. But the symbol grounding problem is not the same as the mind/body problem, let alone a solution to it. The mind/body problem is actually the feeling/function problem: Symbol-grounding touches only its functional component.  This does not detract from the importance of the symbol grounding problem, but just reflects that it is a keystone piece to the bigger puzzle called the mind.

The neuroscientist [[Antonio Damasio]] investigates this marking function of feelings and emotions in his [[Somatic marker hypothesis]]. Damasio adds the notion of biologic [[homeostasis]] to this discussion, presenting it as an automated bodily regulation process providing intentionality to a mind via emotions. Homeostasis is the mechanism that keeps all bodily processes in healthy balance. All of our actions and perceptions will be automatically "evaluated" by our body hardware according to their contribution to homeostasis. This gives us an implicit orientation on how to survive. Such bodily or somatic evaluations can come to our mind in the form of conscious and non-conscious feelings ("gut feelings") and lead our decision-making process. The meaning of a word can be roughly conceptualized as the sum of its associations and their expected contribution to homeostasis, where associations are reconstructions of sensomotor perceptions that appeared in contiguity with the word. Yet, the Somatic marker hypothesis is still hotly debated and critics claim that it has failed to clearly demonstrate how these processes interact at a psychological and evolutionary level. The recurrent question that the Somatic marker hypothesis does not address remains: how and why does homeostasis (as in any [[servomechanism]] such as a thermostat and furnace) become ''felt'' homeostasis?

A '''taijitu''' ({{lang-zh|t=太極圖|s=太极图|p=tàijítú|w=t'ai⁴chi²t'u²}})  is a [[Character (symbol)|symbol or diagram]] ({{lang|zh|图}} ''tú'') in [[Chinese philosophy]] representing [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] ({{lang|zh|太极}} ''tàijí'' "great pole" or "supreme ultimate") representing both its monist (''[[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]'') and its dualist ([[yin and yang]]) aspects. Such a diagram was first introduced by  [[Song Dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism|philosopher]] [[Zhou Dunyi]] (周敦頤 1017–1073) in his ''Taijitu shuo'' 太極圖說.

The modern [[Taoism|Taoist]] canon, compiled during the [[Ming China|Ming era]], has at least half a dozen variants of such ''taijitu''. The two most similar are the "Taiji [[Xiantiandao|Primal Heaven]]" (太極先天圖 ''tàijí  xiāntiān tú'') and the "[[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]]" (無極圖 ''wújí tú'') diagrams, both of which have been extensively studied during the Qing period for their possible connection with Zhou Dunyi's ''taijitu''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Adler, ''Reconstructing the Confucian Dao: Zhu Xi's Appropriation of Zhou Dunyi'',  SUNY Press, 2014,
[https://books.google.com/books?id=09ouAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA153 p. 153]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ming period author [[Lai Zhide]] (1525–1604) simplified the ''taijitu'' to a design of two interlocking spirals. In the Ming era, the combination of the two interlocking spirals of the ''taijitu'' with two black-and-white dots superimposed on them became identified with the ''[[Yellow River Map|He tu]]'' or "Yellow River diagram" (河圖). This version was reported in Western literature of the late 19th century as the "Great Monad",&lt;ref&gt;Labelled "The Great Monad" by [[Hampden Coit DuBose]], ''The Dragon, Image, and Demon: Or, The Three Religions of China; Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism'' (1887), [https://archive.org/stream/dragonimageandd00bosegoog#page/n359/mode/2up p. 357]&lt;/ref&gt; and has been widely popularised in Western popular culture as the "yin-yang symbol" since the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;"The 'River Diagram' is the pattern of black-and-white dots which appears superimposed on the interlocking spirals [...] Those spirals alone form the ''Taiji tu'' or 'Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate', often known in English since the 1960s as the 'yin-yang symbol'.) These dots were believed to be collated with the eight trigrams, and hence with the concepts of roundness and of the heavens, while the equally numinous 'Luo River Writing' was a pattern of dots accosiated with the number nine, with squareness and with the earth."
Craig Clunas, ''Pictures and Visuality in Early Modern China'' (1997), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Q06pemllwx0C&amp;pg=PA107  p. 107].
&lt;/ref&gt; The contemporary Chinese term for the modern symbol is {{lang|zh|太极兩儀图}} "two-part Taiji diagram".

[[Unicode]] features the "yin-yang symbol" in the [[Miscellaneous Symbols]] block, at code point U+262F  (YIN YANG ☯). The related "double body symbol" is included at U+0FCA  (TIBETAN SYMBOL NOR BU NYIS -KHYIL ࿊), in the [[Tibetan alphabet|Tibetan]] block.
The [[Soyombo symbol]], that includes a taijitu, is available in Unicode as U+11A9E, 𑪞, U+11A9F, 𑪟, and U+11AA0, 𑪠.

Ornamental patterns with visual similarity to the "yin-yang symbol" are found in archaeological artefacts of [[European prehistory]]; such designs are sometimes descriptively dubbed "yin yang symbols" in archaeological literature by modern scholars.&lt;ref name="Celtic yin yang"&gt;{{harvnb|Peyre|1982|pp=62–64, 82 (pl.

== Structure ==
[[File:ZhoushiTaijitu.png|thumb|right|Ming-era Daoist ''Taijitu'']]
The ''taijitu'' consists of five parts. Strictly speaking, the "yin and yang symbol", itself popularly called ''taijitu'', represents the second of these five parts of the diagram.

*At the top, an empty circle depicts the absolute (''[[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]]'')
*A second circle represents the Taiji as harboring Dualism, [[yin and yang]], represented by filling the circle in a black-and-white pattern. In some diagrams, there is a smaller empty circle at the center of this, representing Emptiness as the foundation of duality.
*Below this second circle is a five-part diagram representing the Five Agents (''[[Wu Xing|Wuxing]]''), representing a further stage in the differentiation of Unity into Multiplicity. The Five Agents are connected by lines indicating their proper sequence,  Wood (木) → Fire (火) → Earth (土) → Metal (金) → Water (水).
*The circle below the Five Agents represents the conjunction of Heaven and Earth, which in turn gives rise to the "ten thousand things". This stage is also represented by the Eight Trigrams (''[[Bagua]]'').
*The final circle represents the state of multiplicity, glossed  "The ten thousand things are born by transformation" (萬物化生; modern 化生万物)

== History ==
{{See also|Taiji (philosophy)|Yin and yang}}
The term ''taijitu'' in modern Chinese is commonly used to mean the simple "divided circle" form ([[File:Taijitu - Small (CW).svg|18px]]), but it may refer to any of several schematic diagrams that contain at least one circle with an inner pattern of [[symmetry]] representing [[yin and yang]].

=== Song era ===
While the concept of [[yin and yang]] dates to Chinese antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;in the ''[[I Ching]]'', originally a divination manual of the [[Western Zhou]] period (c. 1000–750 BC),  yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (⚋) and yang is solid (⚊).&lt;/ref&gt;
the interest in "diagrams" (圖 ''tú'') is an intellectual fashion of [[Neo-Confucianism]] during the [[Song China|Song period]] (11th century), and it declined again
in the Ming period, by the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Adler152"&gt;Joseph A. Adler, ''Reconstructing the Confucian Dao: Zhu Xi's Appropriation of Zhou Dunyi'',  SUNY Press, 2014,
[https://books.google.com/books?id=09ouAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA152 p. 152]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original description of a ''taijitu'' is due to Song era philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] (1017–1073), author of the ''Taijitu shuo'' {{lang|zh|太極圖說}} "Explanation of the Diagram of the Supreme Ultimate", which became the cornerstone of [[Neo-Confucianist]] cosmology. His brief text synthesized aspects of [[Chinese Buddhism]] and Taoism with [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] discussions in the ''[[Yijing]]''.

Zhou's key terms [[Wuji (philosophy)|Wuji]] and [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] appear in the opening line {{lang|zh|無極而太極}}, which Adler notes could also be translated "The Supreme Polarity that is Non-Polar".
&lt;blockquote&gt;Non-polar (''wuji'') and yet Supreme Polarity (''taiji'')! The Supreme Polarity in activity generates ''yang''; yet at the limit of activity it is still. In stillness it generates ''yin''; yet at the limit of stillness it is also active. Activity and stillness alternate; each is the basis of the other. In distinguishing ''yin'' and ''yang'', the Two Modes are thereby established. The alternation and combination of ''yang'' and ''yin'' generate water, fire, wood, metal, and earth. With these five [phases of] ''qi'' harmoniously arranged, the Four Seasons proceed through them. The Five Phases are simply ''yin'' and ''yang''; ''yin'' and ''yang'' are simply the Supreme Polarity; the Supreme Polarity is fundamentally Non-polar. [Yet] in the generation of the Five Phases, each one has its nature.&lt;ref&gt;Adler, Joseph A. (1999). [http://www2.kenyon.edu/Depts/Religion/Fac/Adler/Writings/Chou.htm "Zhou Dunyi: The Metaphysics and Practice of Sagehood"], in ''Sources of Chinese Tradition'', William Theodore De Bary and Irene Bloom, eds. 2nd ed., 2 vols. Columbia University Press. pp. 673–674.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Instead of usual ''Taiji'' translations "Supreme Ultimate" or "Supreme Pole", Adler uses "Supreme Polarity" (see Robinet 1990) because [[Zhu Xi]] describes it as the alternating principle of [[yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']], and ...
&lt;blockquote&gt;insists that ''taiji'' is not a thing (hence "Supreme Pole" will not do). Thus, for both Zhou and Zhu, ''taiji'' is the ''yin-yang'' principle of bipolarity, which is the most fundamental ordering principle, the cosmic "first principle." ''Wuji'' as "non-polar" follows from this. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the 12th century, there has been a vigorous discussion in Chinese philosophy regarding the ultimate origin of Zhou Dunyi's diagram.
[[Zhu Xi]] (12th century) insists that Zhou Dunyi had composed the diagram himself, against the prevailing view that he had received it from Daoist sources.
Zhu Xi could not accept a Daoist origin of the design, because it would have undermined the claim of uniqueness attached to the Neo-Confucian concept of ''dao''.&lt;ref name="Adler152"/&gt;

While [[Zhou Dunyi]] (1017–1073) popularized the circular diagram,&lt;ref name="Yao2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Xinzhong Yao|title=An introduction to Confucianism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tAE2OJ9bPG0C&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate=29 October 2011|date=13 February 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-64430-3|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt; the introduction of "swirling" patterns first appears in the Ming period.

Zhao Huiqian (趙撝謙, 1351–1395) was the first to introduce the "swirling" variant of the ''taijitu'' in his ''Liushu benyi'' (六書本義, 1370s).
The diagram is combined with the eight trigrams (''[[bagua]]'') and called the "River Chart spontaneously generated by Heaven and Earth".
By the end of the Ming period, this diagram had become a widespread representation of [[Chinese cosmology]].&lt;ref&gt;François Louis,
'The Genesis of an Icon: The "Taiji" Diagram's Early History', ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 63.11 (June 2003),  145–196.&lt;/ref&gt;
The dots were introduced in the later Ming period (replacing the droplet-shapes used earlier, in the 16th century) and are encountered more frequently in the [[Qing dynasty|Qing period]].&lt;ref&gt;Louis (2003) has diagrams with dots dated to 1623 (p. 187) and 1688 (p. 146, p. 190).&lt;/ref&gt; The dots represent the seed of yin within yang and the seed of yang within yin; the idea that neither can exist without the other. 

Lai Zhide's design is similar to the ''[[Gankyil|gakyil]]'' (''dga' 'khyil'' or "wheel of joy") symbols of [[Tibetan Buddhism]];
but while the Tibetan designs have three or four swirls (representing the [[Three Jewels]] or the [[Four Noble Truths]], i.e. as a [[triskele]] and a [[tetraskelion]] design), Lai Zhide's taijitu has two swirls, terminating in a central circle.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Beer, ''The Handbook of Tibetan Buddhist Symbols'', 2003, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-3804Ud9-4IC&amp;pg=PA209#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p. 209]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern yin-yang symbol ==
The Ming-era design of the taijitu of two interlocking spirals has been reported as "yin-yang symbol" in the first half of the 20th century.
The [[flag of South Korea]], originally introduced as the flag of [[Joseon]] era Korea in 1882, shows this symbol in red and blue. This was a modernisation of the older (early 19th century) form of the [[Bat Quai Do]] used as the Joseon royal standard.

Since the 1960s, "yin-yang symbol" is most widely applied to the ''He tu'' symbol which combines the two interlocking spirals with two dots.
In the standard form of the contemporary "yin-yang symbol", one draws on the [[diameter]] of a [[circle]] two non-overlapping circles each of which has a diameter equal to the [[radius]] of the outer circle. One keeps the line that forms an "S", and one erases or obscures the other line.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Peyre|1982|pp=62f.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design is also described{{according to whom|date=December 2015}}{{year needed|date=December 2015}} "pair of fishes nestling head to tail against each other".&lt;ref name="Robinet 2008, 934"&gt;{{harvnb|Robinet|2008|p=934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soyombo symbol]] of Mongolia may be prior to 1686.
It combines several abstract shapes, including a ''Taiji'' symbol illustrating the mutual complement of man and woman. In socialist times, it was alternatively interpreted as two fish symbolizing vigilance, because fish never close their eyes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pu̇revsambuu |first1=G. |title=Mongolia |location=Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia |publisher=[[Montsame]] |year=2006 |isbn=99929-0-627-8 |page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
