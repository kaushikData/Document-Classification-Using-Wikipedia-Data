The quotation "'''All men are created equal'''" has been called an "immortal declaration," and "perhaps [the] single phrase" of the [[American Revolution]]ary period with the greatest "continuing importance."&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Jack P. Greene, ''All Men Are Created Equal: Some Reflections on the Character of the American Revolution'' (1000. p. 5: "Perhaps no single phrase from the Revolutionary era has had such continuing importance in American public life as the dictum 'all men are created equal'".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Wynne Jeudwine, ''Pious Phrases in Politics: An Examination of Some Popular Catchwords, their Misuse and Meanings'' (1919), p. 27, quoting Senator [[Lyman Trumbull]] of [[Illinois]], author of the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], as referencing the "immortal declaration that all men are created equal".&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Jefferson]] first used the phrase in the [[United States Declaration of Independence|U.S. Declaration of Independence]], which he penned in 1776 during the beginning of the American Revolution. It was thereafter quoted and incorporated into speeches by a wide array of substantial figures in American political and social life in the United States. The final form of the phrase was stylized by [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, Merrill. ''Thomas Jefferson and the New Nation: A biography''. p. 90. Oxford University Press, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of Thomas Jefferson's use of the phrase==
Thomas Jefferson, through his friendship with Lafayette, was heavily influenced by French philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], such as Voltaire, Rousseau and Montesquieu. In their often censored writings, those philosophers advocated that men were born free and equal. This later led to the French Revolution of 1789 and the concept of Human Rights (Droits de l'Homme in French).  At the age of 33, Jefferson may have also borrowed the expression from an Italian friend and neighbor, [[Philip Mazzei]],&lt;ref&gt;Philip Mazzei, [[The Virginia Gazette]], 1774. Translated by a friend and neighbor, Thomas Jefferson:&lt;br&gt;
{{quote|''Tutti gli uomini sono per natura egualmente liberi e indipendenti. Quest'eguaglianza è necessaria per costituire un governo libero. Bisogna che ognuno sia uguale all'altro nel diritto naturale.''}} 
Translated by Jefferson as follow: 
{{quote|All men are by nature equally free and independent. Such equality is necessary in order to create a free government.
All men must be equal to each other in natural law}}

He may also have influenced [[Thomas Paine]]'s [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']].

{{quote|All men are by nature equally free and independent. Such equality is necessary in order to create a free government.&lt;br /&gt;All men must be equal to each other in natural law}}&lt;/ref&gt; as noted by Joint Resolution 175 of the [[103rd United States Congress|103rd Congress]] as well as by [[John F. Kennedy]] in ''[[A Nation of Immigrants]]''.{{refn|According to Joint Resolution 175 of the 103rd Congress, "the phrase in the Declaration of Independence 'All men are created equal' was suggested by the [[Italians|Italian]] [[patriotism|patriot]] and [[immigrant]] Philip Mazzei.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103hjres175eh/pdf/BILLS-103hjres175eh.pdf|title=103D CONGRESS : 2D SESSION : H. J. RES. 175|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;"The great doctrine 'All men are created equal' incorporated into the Declaration of Independence by Thomas Jefferson, was paraphrased from the writing of Philip Mazzei, an Italian-born patriot and pamphleteer, who was a close friend of Jefferson." by John F. Kennedy, ''A Nation of Immigrants'' pp. 15–16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1776 the [[Second Continental Congress]] asked Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, [[John Adams]], [[Robert R. Livingston (chancellor)|Robert Livingston]], and [[Roger Sherman]] to write the Declaration of Independence.  This [[Committee of Five]] voted to have Thomas Jefferson write the document.  After Jefferson finished he gave the document to Franklin to proof. Franklin suggested minor changes, one of which stands out far more than the others:  "We hold these truths to be sacred and un-deniable..." became "We hold these truths to be self-evident."

The second paragraph of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] starts as follows: 
{{quote|We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are [[Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness|Life, Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness]].-- That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,;&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States Declaration of Independence]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Virginia Declaration of Rights]], chiefly authored by [[George Mason]] and approved by the [[Fifth Virginia Convention|Virginia Convention]] on June 12, 1776, contains the wording:
{{quote|all men are by nature equally free and independent, and have certain inherent rights of which . . . they cannot deprive or divest their posterity; namely, the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.&lt;ref&gt;[[Virginia Declaration of Rights]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

George Mason was an elder-planter who had originally stated [[John Locke]]'s theory of natural rights:
{{quote|All men are born equally free and independent and have certain inherent natural rights of which they cannot, by any compact, deprive or divest their posterity; among which are the enjoyment of life and liberty, with the means of acquiring and possessing property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety.&lt;ref&gt;Blumrosen, Alfred W. and Ruth G., Slave Nation: How Slavery United the Colonies and Sparked the American Revolution, Sourcebooks, 2005, pp. 125–26.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Mason's draft was accepted by a small committee and then rejected by the Virginia Convention.  Thomas Jefferson, a competent Virginia lawyer, saw this as a problem in legal writing and chose words that were more acceptable to the Second Continental Congress.

The [[Massachusetts Constitution]], chiefly authored by [[John Adams]] in 1780, contains in its  [[Massachusetts Constitution#Part the First: A Declaration of the Rights of the Inhabitants of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts|Declaration of Rights]] the wording:

{{quote|Article I. All men are born free and equal, and have certain natural, essential, and unalienable rights; among which may be reckoned the right of enjoying and defending their lives and liberties; that of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property; in fine, that of seeking and obtaining their safety and happiness.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1780)#Article I|Article I, Constitution of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts (1780)]]&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
 
The plaintiffs in the cases of ''[[Mum Bett|Brom and Bett v. John Ashley]]'' and ''[[Commonwealth v. Nathaniel Jennison]]'' argued that this provision abolished slavery in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPvq0-taGAEC |pages=74–75 |title=Founding the Republic |author=John J. Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The latter case resulted in a "sweeping declaration . . . that the institution of slavery was incompatible with the principles of liberty and legal equality articulated in the new Massachusetts Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/courts/sjc/constitution-slavery-e.html The Massachusetts Constitution, Judicial Review and Slavery – The Quock Walker Case], Massachusetts Judicial Branch (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase has since been considered a hallmark statement in democratic constitutions and similar human rights instruments, many of which have adopted the phrase or variants thereof.{{refn|UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Preamble: Whereas recognition of the inherent dignity, and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world &amp; Article 1: All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. They are endowed with reason and conscience and should act towards one another in a spirit of brotherhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/|title=Universal Declaration of Human Rights|publisher=The United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Slavery and the phrase==
The contradiction between the claim that "all men are created equal" and the existence of American slavery attracted comment when the Declaration of Independence was first published. Before final approval, Congress, having made a few alterations to some of the wording, also deleted nearly a fourth of the draft, including a passage criticizing the slave trade.  At that time many members of Congress, including Jefferson, owned slaves, which clearly factored into their decision to delete the controversial "anti-slavery" passage. Jefferson, an abolitionist at heart, believed adding such a passage would dissolve the independence movement. Jefferson decades before the declaration of independence, argued in court for abolition of a slave. The court dismissed the case outright. In writing the declaration, Jefferson believed the phrase "all men are created equal" to be self evident, and would ultimately resolve slavery.  &lt;ref name=AFP&gt;Armitage, David. The Declaration Of Independence: A Global History. 76–77. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-674-02282-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1776, [[abolitionist]] [[Thomas Day]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;If there be an object truly ridiculous in nature, it is an American patriot, signing resolutions of independency with the one hand, and with the other brandishing a whip over  his affrighted slaves.&lt;ref name=AFP/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==
The phrase "all men are created equal" has received criticism from [[Elitism|elitists]] and [[Traditional conservatism|traditional conservatives]]. For instance, [[Richard M. Weaver]] writing in one of the cornerstone works of traditional conservatism, ''[[Ideas Have Consequences]]'' (1948), paraphrased a 19th-century writer in writing that "no man was ever created free and no two men [were] ever created equal". He continues:
{{quote|The comity of peoples in groups large or small rests not upon this chemerical notion of equality but upon [[fraternity]], a concept which long antedates it in history because it goes immeasurably deeper in human sentiment. The ancient feeling of brotherhood carries obligations of which equality knows nothing. It calls for respect and protection, for brotherhood is status in family, and family is by nature hierarchical.&lt;ref name=WEA&gt;Weaver, Richard. Ideas Have Consequences. 41-42. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1971. {{ISBN|0-226-87678-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Legacy==
The [[Proclamation of Independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam|Vietnamese proclamation of independence]], written in 1945, uses the phrase "all men are created equal" and mentions the [[United States Declaration of Independence|U.S. Declaration of Independence]] in it as well.

The [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence|Rhodesian declaration of independence]], ratified in November 1965, is based on the American one, however, it omits the phrase "all men are created equal", along with "[[Consent of the governed|the consent of the governed]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Alvin Plantinga's free will defense''' is a [[Problem of evil#Logical problem of evil|logical argument]] developed by American [[Analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] [[Alvin Plantinga]], the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the [[University of Notre Dame]], and published in its final version in his 1977 book ''God, Freedom, and Evil''.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=God, Freedom, and Evil|last=Plantinga|first=Alvin|publisher=Eerdmans|year=1977|isbn=0-8028-1731-9|location=Grand Rapids, MI:|pages=Chapter 4|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Free Will Defense", in [[Max Black]] (ed), ''Philosophy in America''. Ithaca: Cornell UP / London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's argument is a defense against the [[Problem of evil#Logical problem of evil|logical problem of evil]] as formulated by philosopher [[J. L. Mackie]] beginning in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Evil and Omnipotence|journal=Mind|volume=64|issue=210|pages=455–465|doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mackie's formulation of the logical problem of evil argued that three attributes of God, omniscience, omnipotence, and omnibenevolence, in orthodox Christian theism are logically incompatible with the existence of evil. In 1982, Mackie conceded that Plantinga's defense successfully refuted his argument in ''The Miracle of Theism,'' though he did not claim that the problem of evil had been put to rest.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Miracle of Theism.|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1982|isbn=|location=Oxford:|pages=154|quote=Since this defense is formally [that is, logically] possible, and its principle involves no real abandonment of our ordinary view of the opposition between good and evil, we can concede that the problem of evil does not, after all, show that the central doctrines of theism are logically inconsistent with one another. But whether this offers a real solution of the problem is another question.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mackie's logical argument from evil ==

The logical argument from evil argued by J. L. Mackie, and to which the free will defense responds, is an argument against the existence of the Christian God based on the idea that a logical contradiction exists between four theological tenets in orthodox Christian theology. Specifically, the argument from evil asserts that the following set of propositions are, by themselves, logically inconsistent or contradictory:
# God is omniscient (all-knowing)
# God is omnipotent  (all-powerful)
# God is omnibenevolent (morally perfect)
# There is evil in the world
Most orthodox Christian theologians agree with the first three propositions describing God as all-knowing (1), all-powerful (2), and morally perfect (3), and agree with the proposition that there is evil in the world, as described in proposition (4). The logical argument from evil asserts that a God with the attributes (1-3), must know about all evil, would be capable of preventing it, and as morally perfect would be motivated to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mackie|first=J. L.|year=1955|title=Evil and Omnipotence|journal=Mind|volume=64|pages=200–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCloskey|first=H. J.|year=1960|title=God and Evil|journal=Philosophical Quarterly|volume=10|pages=97–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument from evil concludes that the existence of the orthodox Christian God is, therefore, incompatible with the existence of evil and can be logically ruled out.

== Plantinga's free will defense ==
Plantinga's [[free will]] defense begins by asserting that Mackie's argument failed to establish an ''explicit'' logical contradiction between God and the existence of evil. In other words Plantinga shows that (1-4) are not on their own contradictory, and that any contradiction must originate from an atheologian's ''implicit'' unstated assumptions, assumptions representing premises not stated in the argument itself. With an ''explicit'' contradiction ruled out, an atheologian must add premises to the argument for it to succeed.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nonetheless, if Plantinga had offered no further argument then an atheologian's intuitive impressions that a contradiction must exist would have remained unanswered. Plantinga sought to resolve this by offering two further points.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

First, Plantinga pointed out that God, though [[omnipotent]], could not be expected to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create beings with free will that would never choose evil.&lt;sup&gt;[[Alvin Plantinga's free will defense#cite note-3|[3]]]&lt;/sup&gt; Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Plantinga's defense has received strong support among Christian academic philosophers and theologians.&lt;ref name="Howard-Snyder"&gt;"It used to be widely held by philosophers that God and evil are incompatible. Not any longer. Alvin Plantinga's Free Will Defense is largely responsible for this shift."{{cite journal|last=Howard-Snyder|first=Daniel|year=1999|title=Transworld Sanctity and Plantinga's Free Will Defense|url=http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Howard-Snyder-Transworld-Sanctity-and-Plantingas-Free-Will-Defense.pdf|journal=International Journal for the Philosophy of Religion|volume=16|issue=3|pages=336–351|author2=John O’Leary-Hawthorne|access-date=2013-09-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215091750/http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/Howard-Snyder-Transworld-Sanctity-and-Plantingas-Free-Will-Defense.pdf|archive-date=2011-12-15|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meister"&gt;"Most philosophers have agreed that the free will defense has defeated the logical problem of evil.

In addition to Plantinga's free will defense, there are other arguments purporting to undermine or disprove the logical argument from evil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Plantinga's free will defense is the best known of these responses at least in part because of his thoroughness in describing and addressing the relevant questions and issues in ''God, Freedom, and Evil.''&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

As opposed to a [[theodicy]] (a ''justification'' for God's actions), Plantinga puts forth a ''defense'', offering a new proposition that is intended to demonstrate that it is logically possible for an omnibenevolent, omnipotent and omniscient God to create a world that contains moral evil. Significantly, Plantinga does not need to assert that his new proposition is true, merely that it is logically valid. In this way Plantinga's approach differs from that of a traditional theodicy, which would strive to show not just that the new propositions are valid, but that the argument is sound, [[prima facie]] plausible, or that there are good grounds for making it.&lt;ref name="Surin1995p193"&gt;{{harvnb|Surin|1995|p=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the burden of proof on Plantinga is lessened, and yet his approach may still serve as a defense against the claim by Mackie that the simultaneous existence of evil and an omnipotent and omnibenevolent God is "positively irrational".&lt;ref name="Mackie200"&gt;{{harvnb|Mackie|1955|p=200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As Plantinga summarised his defense:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1974|pp=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;A world containing creatures who are significantly free (and freely perform more good than evil actions) is more valuable, all else being equal, than a world containing no free creatures at all. Now God can create free creatures, but He can't ''cause'' or ''determine'' them to do only what is right. For if He does so, then they aren't significantly free after all; they do not do what is right ''freely''. To create creatures capable of ''moral good'', therefore, He must create creatures capable of moral evil; and He can't give these creatures the freedom to perform evil and at the same time prevent them from doing so. As it turned out, sadly enough, some of the free creatures God created went wrong in the exercise of their freedom; this is the source of [[moral evil]]. The fact that free creatures sometimes go wrong, however, counts neither against God's omnipotence nor against His goodness; for He could have forestalled the occurrence of moral evil only by removing the possibility of moral good.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Plantinga's argument is that even though God is omnipotent, it is ''possible'' that it was not in his power to create a world containing moral good but no moral evil; therefore, there is no logical inconsistency involved when God, although wholly good, creates a world of free creatures who choose to do evil.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1991 130–133"&gt;{{harvnb|Peterson|Hasker|Reichenbach|Basinger|1991|pp=130–133}}&lt;/ref&gt; The argument relies on the following propositions:
# There are possible worlds that even an omnipotent being can not actualize.
# A world with morally free creatures producing only moral good is such a world.
Plantinga refers to the first statement as "Leibniz's lapse" as the opposite was assumed by Leibniz.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second proposition is more contentious. Plantinga rejects the compatibilist notion of freedom whereby God could directly cause agents to only do good without sacrificing their freedom. Although it would contradict a creature's freedom if God were to cause, or in Plantinga's terms ''strongly actualize'', a world where creatures only do good, an omniscient God would still know the circumstances under which creatures would go wrong. Thus, God could avoid creating such circumstances, thereby ''weakly actualizing'' a world with only moral good. Plantinga's crucial argument is that this possibility may not be available to God because all possible morally free creatures suffer from "transworld depravity".

== Reception ==
According to Chad Meister, professor of philosophy at [[Bethel College (Indiana)|Bethel College]], most philosophers accept Plantinga's free will defense and thus see the logical problem of evil as having been sufficiently rebutted.&lt;ref name="Meister134"/&gt; [[Robert Merrihew Adams|Robert Adams]] says that "it is fair to say that Plantinga has solved this problem. That is, he has argued convincingly for the consistency of [[God and evil]]."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{harvnb|Howard-Snyder|O'Leary-Hawthorne|1998|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Alston]] has said that "Plantinga [...] has established the possibility that God could not actualize a world containing free creatures that always do the right thing."&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{harvnb|Alston|1991|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William L. Rowe]] has written "granted [[incompatibilism]], there is a fairly compelling argument for the view that the existence of evil is logically consistent with the existence of the theistic God", referring to Plantinga's argument.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rowe|1979|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Arguing about Gods'', [[Graham Oppy]] offers a dissent, acknowledging that "[m]any philosophers seem to suppose that [Plantinga's free will defense] utterly demolishes the kinds of 'logical' arguments from evil developed by Mackie" but continuing "I am not sure this is a correct assessment of the current state of play".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Oppy|2006|pp=262–263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concurring with Oppy, A.M. Weisberger writes “contrary to popular theistic opinion, the logical form of the argument is still alive and beating.”&lt;ref name="Weisberger 1999 39"&gt;{{harvnb|Weisberger|1999|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among contemporary philosophers, most discussion on the [[problem of evil]] presently revolves around the ''evidential'' problem of evil, namely that the existence of God is unlikely, rather than illogical.&lt;ref name="BeebeIEP"&gt;{{harvnb|Beebe|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Additional objections and responses ==

=== Incompatibilist view of free will === 
[[File:FreeWillTaxonomy2.svg|right|thumb|250px|alt=A diagram. At the top, an orange box labeled "Determinism?" with two arrows pointing to other boxes. The arrow labeled "True" points to an orange box labeled "Free will?", the arrow labeled "False" points to a light-blue box labeled "Libertarianism". The box labeled "Free will?" has two arrows pointing to other boxes. The arrow labeled "True" points to a light-blue box labeled "Compatibilism", the arrow labeled "False" points to a light-blue box labeled "Hard determinism". The two light-blue boxes labeled "Hard determinism" and "Libertarianism" are surrounded by a grey ellipse labeled "Incompatibilism".|A simplified taxonomy of the main positions on the nature of free will.]]
Critics of Plantinga's argument, such as philosopher [[Antony Flew]], have responded that it presupposes a libertarian, [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|incompatibilist]] view of free will (free will and determinism are metaphysically incompatible), while their view is a [[Compatibilism and incompatibilism|compatibilist]] view of free will (free will and determinism, whether physical or divine, are metaphysically compatible).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackie|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Flew|1973}}&lt;/ref&gt; The view of compatibilists is that God could have created a world containing moral good but no moral evil. In such a world people could have chosen to only perform good deeds, even though all their choices were predestined.&lt;ref name="Peterson 1991 130–133"/&gt;

Plantinga dismisses compatibilism, stating "this objection... seems utterly implausible. One might as well claim that being in jail doesn't really limit one's freedom on the grounds that if one were not in jail, he'd be free to come and go as he pleased".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transworld depravity ===
Plantinga's idea of weakly actualizing a world can be viewed as having God actualizing a subset of the world, letting the free choices of creatures complete the world. Therefore, it is certainly possible that a person completes the world by only making morally good choices; that is, there exist possible worlds where a person freely chooses to do no moral evil. However, it may be the case that for each such world, there is some morally significant choice that this person would do differently if these circumstances were to occur in the actual world. In other words, each such possible world contains a ''world segment'', meaning everything about that world up to the point where the person must make that critical choice, such that if that segment was part of the actual world, the person would instead go wrong in completing that world. Formally, ''transworld depravity'' is defined as follows:&lt;ref name="Plantinga 1977 48"&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|
A person ''P suffers from transworld depravity'' if and only if the following holds: for every world ''W'' such that ''P'' is significantly free in ''W'' and ''P'' does only what is right in ''W'', there is an action ''A'' and a maximal world segment ''S´'' such that
# ''S´'' includes ''A'' 's being morally significant for ''P''
# ''S´'' includes ''P'' 's being free with respect to ''A''
# ''S´'' is included in ''W'' and includes neither ''P'' 's performing ''A'' nor ''P'' 's refraining from performing ''A''
# If ''S´'' were actual, ''P'' would go wrong with respect to ''A''.}}
Less formally: Consider all possible (not actual) worlds in which someone always chooses the right. In all those, there will be a subpart of the world that says that person was free to choose a certain right or wrong action, but does not say whether they chose it. If that subpart were actual (in the real world), then they would choose the wrong.

Plantinga responds that "What is important about the idea of transworld depravity is that if a person suffers from it, then it wasn't within God's power to actualize any world in which that person is significantly free but does no wrong—that is, a world in which he produces moral good but no moral evil"&lt;ref name="Plantinga 1977 48" /&gt; and that it is logically ''possible'' that every person suffers from transworld depravity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|1977|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mathematics '''Antoine's necklace''' is a topological embedding of the [[Cantor set]] in 3-dimensional Euclidean space, whose complement is not [[simply connected]]. It also serves as a counterexample to the claim that all [[Cantor space]]s are ambiently homeomorphic to each other. It was discovered by {{harvs|txt=yes|authorlink= Louis Antoine|last=Antoine|first=Louis|year=1921}}.

==Construction==

Antoine's necklace is constructed iteratively like so: Begin with a [[solid torus]] ''A''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (iteration 0). Next, construct a "necklace" of smaller, linked tori that lie inside ''A''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. This necklace is ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (iteration 1). Each torus composing ''A''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; can be replaced with another smaller necklace as was done for ''A''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. Doing this yields ''A''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (iteration 2).

This process can be repeated a countably infinite number of times to create an ''A''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; for all ''n''. Antoine's necklace ''A'' is defined as the intersection of all the iterations.

==Properties==

Since the solid tori are chosen to become arbitrarily small as the iteration number increases, the connected components of ''A'' must be single points.  It is then easy to verify that ''A'' is [[closure (mathematics)|closed]], [[dense-in-itself]], and [[totally disconnected]], having the [[cardinality of the continuum]]. This is sufficient to conclude that as an abstract metric space ''A'' is homeomorphic to the Cantor set.

However, as a subset of Euclidean space ''A'' is not ambiently homeomorphic to the standard Cantor set ''C'', embedded in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; on a [[line segment]]. That is, there is no bi-continuous map from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; that carries ''C'' onto ''A''. To show this, suppose there was such a map ''h'' : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and consider a loop ''k'' that is interlocked with the necklace. ''k'' cannot be continuously shrunk to a point without touching ''A'' because two loops cannot be continuously unlinked. Now consider any loop ''j'' disjoint from ''C''. ''j'' can be shrunk to a point without touching ''C'' because we can simply move it through the gap intervals. However, the loop ''g'' = ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''k'') is a loop that ''cannot'' be shrunk to a point without touching ''C'', which contradicts the previous statement. Therefore, ''h'' cannot exist.

Antoine's necklace was used by {{harvs|txt|last=Alexander|first=James Waddell|authorlink=James Waddell Alexander II|year=1924}} to construct '''Antoine's horned sphere''' (similar to but not the same as [[Alexander's horned sphere]]).

Gautam|publisher=Publication Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; the negative characteristics of which prevent man from attaining ''[[moksha]]'' or salvation. 

These are the fundamental tenets of [[Kali Yuga]]. The more each individual fights them, the longer will be the life of ''[[Dharma]]'' in this yuga.

#''[[kama]]''                  — lust
#''krodha''                    — anger
#''[[lobha]]''                 — greed
#''moha''                      — delusory emotional attachment or temptation 
#''[[mada]]''  — pride, hubris, (being possessed by) 
#''matsarya''                  — envy, jealousy

According to the Hindu scriptures, ''kama'' and ''krodha'' (lust and anger) are responsible for all kinds of difficult experiences we face in our lives.

With ''mada'' or ''ahankar'', the false ego up and active, all our actions in the world are for selfish ends. Hence there is no other factor causing the illusory duality of differentiation between 'us' and 'them' and the repeated pain and delusion it entails than the psychological ego-sense. When the materially identified ego has sided with the materialistic forces of creation ([[Maya (illusion)|Maya]]), it is said to have the following faults: ''kama'', ''krodha'', ''lobha'', ''moha'', ''mada'' and ''matsarya''. Also called evil passions, man's spiritual heritage constantly gets looted by these internal thieves (and their numerous variations), causing him to lose knowledge of his True Being.

If a person is virtually a prisoner of ''arishadvargas'' (the six internal enemies), then his life is completely governed by destiny. As a person moves ahead on the path of Self-Realization, the grip of destiny over him loosens and he gets more and more leverage to change his destiny. When a person identifies himself with the Self, then he becomes part of the power of destiny. Merely his power of ''[[Sankalpa]]'' is good enough to materialize and change any situation either for good or bad according to his ''sankalpa''.

Through ''[[bhakti]]'' and renunciation, these 6 vices can be overcome. The great [[Vaishnavism|Vaishnava]] Saint [[Chaitanya Mahaprabhu]] exhorted, "''Krishna Nama Sankirtan''" i.e. the constant chanting of the Lord's name is the supreme healer in [[Kali Yuga]]. It destroys sins and purifies the hearts through ''Bhakti'' and ensures universal peace.

'''Audre Lorde''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɔː|d|r|i|_|l|ɔr|d}}; born '''Audrey Geraldine Lorde'''; February 18, 1934 – November 17, 1992) was an American [[writer]], [[feminist|intersectional feminist]], [[Womanism|womanist]], [[librarian]], and [[civil rights]] activist. As a poet, she is best known for technical mastery and emotional expression, as well as her poems that express anger and outrage at civil and social injustices she observed throughout her life.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2018-03-18|title=Audre Lorde|url=https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/audre-lorde|date=17 March 2018|website=Poetry Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her poems and prose largely deal with issues related to civil rights, feminism, and the exploration of black female identity.

In relation to non-intersectional feminism in the United States, Lorde famously said, "those of us who stand outside the circle of this society's definition of acceptable women; those of us who have been forged in the crucibles of difference – those of us who are poor, who are lesbians, who are Black, who are older – know that survival is not an academic skill. It is learning how to take our differences and make them strengths. For the master's tools will never dismantle the master's house. They may allow us temporarily to beat him at his own game, but they will never enable us to bring about genuine change. And this fact is only threatening to those women who still define the master's house as their only source of support."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Early life==
Lorde was born in [[New York City]] to Caribbean immigrants, her father from [[Barbados]] and her mother [[Grenada|Grenadian]] from the island of [[Carriacou]], Frederick Byron Lorde (known as Byron) and Linda Gertrude Belmar Lorde, who settled in [[Harlem]]. Lorde's mother was of mixed ancestry but could "[[Passing (racial identity)|pass"]] for '[[Latino|Spanish]]',&lt;ref name="Lorde" /&gt; which was a source of pride for her family. Lorde's father was darker than the Belmar family liked, and they only allowed the couple to marry because of Byron Lorde's charm, ambition, and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Veaux|first1=Alexis|title=Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde|date=2004|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=0-393-01954-3|pages=7–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Myopia|Nearsighted]] to the point of being [[legally blind]] and the youngest of three daughters (her two older sisters were named Phyllis and Helen), Lorde grew up hearing her mother's stories about the [[Caribbean|West Indies]]. At the age of four, she learned to talk while she learned to read, and her mother taught her to write at around the same time. She wrote her first poem when she was in the eighth grade.

Born Audrey Geraldine Lorde, she chose to drop the "y" from her first name while still a child, explaining in ''[[Zami: A New Spelling of My Name]]'' that she was more interested in the artistic symmetry of the "e"-endings in the two side-by-side names "Audre Lorde" than in spelling her name the way her parents had intended.&lt;ref name=Parks&gt;{{cite web|last=Parks|first=Rev. Gabriele|title=Audre Lorde|work=|publisher=Thomas Paine Unitarian Universalist Fellowship|date=August 3, 2008|url=http://www.tpuuf.org/?p=130|accessdate=July 9, 2009}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lorde&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorde|first=Audre|title=Zami: A New Spelling of My Name|publisher=Crossing Press|year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorde's relationship with her parents was difficult from a young age. She spent very little time with her father and mother, who were both busy maintaining their real estate business in the tumultuous economy after the Great Depression. When she did see them, they were often cold or emotionally distant. In particular, Lorde's relationship with her mother, who was deeply suspicious of people with darker skin than hers (which Lorde's was) and the outside world in general, was characterized by "tough love" and strict adherence to family rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=De Veaux|first1=Alexis|title=Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde|date=2004|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=0-393-01954-3|pages=15–20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorde's difficult relationship with her mother figured prominently in her later poems, such as ''[[Coal (book)|Coal]]'''s "Story Books on a Kitchen Table."&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Audre Lorde|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/audre-lorde|website=Audre Lorde: The Poetry Foundation|publisher=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Lorde struggled with communication, and came to appreciate the power of poetry as a form of expression.&lt;ref name="W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kimerly W. Benston|authorlink1=Audre Lorde|editor1-last=Gates, Jr.|editor1-first=Henry Louis|editor2-last=Smith|editor2-first=Valerie A.|title=The Norton Anthology of African-American Literature: Volume 2|date=2014|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-393-92370-4|pages=637–39|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; She memorized a great deal of poetry, and would use it to communicate, to the extent that, "If asked how she was feeling, Audre would reply by reciting a poem."&lt;ref name="Audre Lorde's Life and Career"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Threatt Kulii|first1=Beverly|last2=Reuman|first2=Ann E.|last3=Trapasso|first3=Ann|title=Audre Lorde's Life and Career|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lorde/life.htm|website=Audre Lorde's Life and Career|publisher=Modern American Poetry|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the age of twelve, she began writing her own poetry and connecting with others at her school who were considered "outcasts," as she felt she was.&lt;ref name="Audre Lorde's Life and Career"/&gt;

She attended [[Hunter College High School]], a secondary school for intellectually gifted students, and graduated in 1951. While attending Hunter, Lorde published her first poem in ''[[Seventeen (American magazine)|Seventeen]]'' magazine after her school’s literary journal rejected it for being inappropriate. Also in high school, Lorde participated in poetry workshops sponsored by the [[Harlem Writers Guild]], but noted that she always felt like somewhat of an outcast from the Guild. She felt she was not accepted because she “was both crazy and [[queer]] but [they thought] I would grow out of it all.”&lt;ref name="W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc" /&gt;

==Career==
In 1954, she spent a pivotal year as a student at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|National University of Mexico]], a period she described as a time of affirmation and renewal. During this time, she confirmed her identity on personal and artistic levels as both a [[lesbian]] and a poet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lorde/life.htm|title=Audre Lorde's Life and Career|website=www.english.illinois.edu|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On her return to New York, Lorde attended [[Hunter College]], and graduated in the class of 1959.  While there, she worked as a librarian, continued writing, and became an active participant in the [[Sexuality and gender identity-based cultures#LGBT culture|gay culture]] of [[Greenwich Village]]. She furthered her education at [[Columbia University]], earning a master's degree in [[library science]] in 1961. During this period, she worked as a public librarian in nearby [[Mount Vernon, New York]].&lt;ref name="Kulii"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kulii|first=Beverly Threatt|title=Audre Lorde's Life and Career|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lorde/life.htm|work=University of Illinois Department of English website|publisher=University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|accessdate=March 8, 2013 |author2=Ann E. Reuman |author3=Ann Trapasso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 Lorde was writer-in-residence at [[Tougaloo College]] in Mississippi.&lt;ref name="poets.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Audre Lorde|work=|publisher=Poets.org|url=http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/306|accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lorde's time at Tougaloo College, like her year at the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|National University of Mexico]], was a formative experience for her as an artist. She led workshops with her young, black undergraduate students, many of whom were eager to discuss the civil rights issues of that time. Through her interactions with her students, she reaffirmed her desire not only to live out her "crazy and queer" identity, but also to devote attention to the formal aspects of her craft as a poet. Her book of poems, ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/867827324 Cables to Rage],'' came out of her time and experiences at Tougaloo.&lt;ref name="W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc"/&gt;

From 1972 to 1987, Lorde resided in [[Staten Island]]. During that  time, in addition to writing and teaching she co-founded [[Kitchen-Table: Women of Color Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Audre Lorde Residence|url=https://www.nyclgbtsites.org/site/audre-lorde-residence/|publisher=NYC LGBT Historic Sites Project|accessdate=19 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Lorde became an associate of the [[Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press]] (WIFP).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wifp.org/who-we-are/associates/|title=Associates {{!}}&amp;nbsp; The Women’s Institute for Freedom of the Press|website=www.wifp.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; WIFP is an American nonprofit publishing organization. The organization works to increase communication between women and connect the public with forms of women-based media.

Lorde taught in the Education Department at [[Lehman College]] from 1969 to 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/women/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/lorde-audre-1934-1992|title=Lorde, Audre (1934–1992)|last=Morehouse|first=Susan Perry|date=2002|website=Encyclopedia.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; then as a professor of English at [[John Jay College of Criminal Justice]] (part of the [[City University of New York]]) from 1970 to 1981. There, she fought for the creation of a [[black studies]] department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Justice Matters|url=http://www.jjay.cuny.edu/sites/default/files/News/Justice_Matters_50.pdf|publisher=John Jay College of Criminal Justice|accessdate=18 March 2017|page=10|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, she went on to teach at her alma mater, [[Hunter College]] (also CUNY), as the distinguished Thomas Hunter chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Blanche Wiesen|last2=Coss|first2=Claire M.|editor1-last=Ware|editor1-first=Susan|title=Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary Completing the Twentieth Century, Volume 5|date=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|page=395|chapter=Lorde, Audre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Lorde was among the founders of the [http://wcstx.org/ Women’s Coalition of St. Croix],&lt;ref name="W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc" /&gt; an organization dedicated to assisting women who have survived sexual abuse and [[intimate partner violence]] (IPV). In the late 1980s, she also helped establish Sisterhood in Support of Sisters (SISA) in South Africa to benefit black women who were affected by [[apartheid]] and other forms of injustice.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1985, Audre Lorde was a part of a delegation of black women writers who had been invited to Cuba. The trip was sponsored by The Black Scholar and the Union of Cuban Writers. She embraced the shared sisterhood as black women writers. They visited Cuban poets Nancy Morejon and Nicolas Guillen. They discussed whether the Cuban revolution had truly changed racism and the status of lesbians and gays there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Veaux|first=Alexis|date=2000|title=Searching for Audre Lorde|jstor=3299519|journal=Callaloo|volume=23|issue=1|pages=64–67}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Berlin years ===
In 1984, Lorde started a visiting professorship in [[West Berlin]] at the [[Free University of Berlin]]. She was invited by FU lecturer [[Dagmar Schultz]] who had met her at the UN "World Women's Conference" in Copenhagen in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.audrelorde-theberlinyears.com/bios.html#.WWtAzojyiM-|title=Audre Lorde - The Berlin Years|website=www.audrelorde-theberlinyears.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her time in Germany, Lorde became an influential part of the then-nascent Afro-German movement.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;[[Dagmar Schultz]] (2015). "Audre Lorde - The Berlin Years, 1984 to 1992". In Broeck, Sabine; Bolaki, Stella. ''Audre Lorde's Transnational Legacies''. Boston, MA: University of Massachusetts Press. pp. 27–38. {{ISBN|978-1-62534-138-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Together with a group of black women activists in Berlin, Audre Lorde coined the term "Afro-German" in 1984 and, consequently, gave rise to the black movement in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michaels|first=Jennifer|date=2006|title=The Impact of Audre Lorde's Politics and Poetics on Afro-German Women Writers.|url=|journal=German Studies|volume=29| issue =  1|pages=21–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her many trips to Germany, Lorde became a mentor to a number of women, including [[May Ayim]], [[Ika Hügel-Marshall]], and Helga Emde.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Gerund, Katharina (2015). "Transracial Feminist Alliances?". In Broeck, Sabine; Bolaki, Stella. ''Audre Lorde's Transnational Legacies''.

"Inscribing the Past, Anticipating the Future". In Broeck, Sabine; Bolaki, Stella. Audre Lorde's Transnational Legacies. Boston, MA: University of Massachusetts Press. pp. 222–24. {{ISBN|978-1-62534-138-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Her impact on Germany reached more than just Afro-German women; Lorde helped increase awareness of intersectionality across racial and ethnic lines.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Lorde's impact on the Afro-German movement was the focus of the 2012 documentary by Dagmar Schultz. "[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2200975/?ref_=ttawd_awd_tt Audre Lorde: The Berlin Years 1984–1992]" was accepted by the [[Berlin International Film Festival|Berlin Film Festival]], Berlinale, and had its World Premiere at the 62nd Annual Festival in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/2012/02_programm_2012/02_Filmdatenblatt_2012_20122675.php#tab=filmStills|title={{!}} Berlinale {{!}} Archive {{!}} Annual Archives {{!}} 2012 {{!}} Programme – Audre Lorde – The Berlin Years 1984 to 1992|website=www.berlinale.de|access-date=2017-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film has gone on to film festivals around the world, and continues to be [http://www.audrelorde-theberlinyears.com/festivals.html#.WJOvFhsrI2w viewed at festivals even in 2016].

==Work==
[[File:Audre Lorde, Meridel Lesueur, Adrienne Rich 1980.jpg|thumb|right| Audre Lorde (left) with writers [[Meridel Le Sueur]] (middle) and [[Adrienne Rich]] (right) at a writing workshop in Austin, Texas, 1980]]

===Poetry===
Lorde focused her discussion of difference not only on differences between groups of women but between conflicting differences within the individual. "I am defined as other in every group I'm part of," she declared. Audre Lorde states that "the outsider, both strength and weakness. Yet without community there is certainly no liberation, no future, only the most vulnerable and temporary armistice between me and my oppression".&lt;ref name="Lorde1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=Audre Lorde|title=The Cancer Journals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Id0oAQAAMAAJ|year=1997|publisher=Aunt Lute Books|isbn=978-1-879960-73-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12–13}} She described herself both as a part of a "continuum of women"&lt;ref name="Lorde1997"/&gt;{{rp|17}} and a "concert of voices" within herself.&lt;ref name="Lorde1997"/&gt;{{rp|31}}

Her conception of her many layers of selfhood is replicated in the multi-genres of her work. Critic Carmen Birkle wrote: "Her multicultural self is thus reflected in a multicultural text, in multi-genres, in which the individual cultures are no longer separate and autonomous entities but melt into a larger whole without losing their individual importance."&lt;ref&gt;Birkle, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Her refusal to be placed in a particular category, whether social or literary, was characteristic of her determination to come across as an individual rather than a stereotype. Lorde considered herself a "lesbian, mother, warrior, poet" and used poetry to get this message across.&lt;ref name="Audre Lorde"&gt;{{cite web|title=Audre Lorde|url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/audre-lorde|publisher=Poetry Foundation|accessdate=February 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorde's poetry was published very regularly during the 1960s – in [[Langston Hughes]]' 1962 ''New Negro Poets, USA''; in several foreign anthologies; and in black literary magazines. During this time, she was also politically active in [[civil rights movement|civil rights]], [[peace movement|anti-war]], and [[feminist movement]]s.

In 1968, Lorde published ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/12420176 The First Cities]'', her first volume of poems. It was edited by [[Diane di Prima]], a former classmate and friend from Hunter College High School. ''The First Cities'' has been described as a "quiet, introspective book,"&lt;ref name="Audre Lorde" /&gt; and [[Dudley Randall]], a poet and critic, asserted in his review of the book that Lorde "does not wave a black flag, but her blackness is there, implicit, in the bone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Randall|first=Dudley|author2=various|title=Books Noted|journal=Negro Digest|date=September 1968|volume=17|issue=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PjoDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 March 2013|editor1-first=Johnson|editor1-last=John H.|page=13|publisher=Johnson Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second volume, ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/867827324 Cables to Rage]'' (1970), which was mainly written during her tenure as poet-in-residence at [[Tougaloo College]] in Mississippi, addressed themes of love, betrayal, childbirth, and the complexities of raising children. It is particularly noteworthy for the poem "Martha," in which Lorde openly confirms her homosexuality for the first time in her writing: "[W]e shall love each other here if ever at all."

Nominated for the [[National Book Award]] for poetry in 1973, ''From a Land Where Other People Live'' (Broadside Press) shows Lorde's personal struggles with identity and anger at social injustice. The volume deals with themes of anger, loneliness, and injustice, as well as what it means to be a Black woman, mother, friend, and lover.&lt;ref name="Kulii"/&gt;

1974 saw the release of ''New York Head Shop and Museum'', which gives a picture of Lorde's New York through the lenses of both the civil rights movement and her own restricted childhood:&lt;ref name="poetryfoundation.org"/&gt; stricken with poverty and neglect and, in Lorde's opinion, in need of political action.&lt;ref name="Kulii"/&gt;

Despite the success of these volumes, it was the release of ''[[Coal (book)|Coal]]'' in 1976 that established Lorde as an influential voice in the [[Black Arts Movement]], and the large publishing house behind it – Norton – helped introduce her to a wider audience. The volume includes poems from both ''The First Cities'' and ''Cables to Rage'', and it unties many of the themes Lorde would become known for throughout her career: her rage at racial injustice, her celebration of her black identity, and her call for an intersectional consideration of women's experiences. Lorde followed ''Coal'' up with ''Between Our Selves'' (also in 1976) and ''Hanging Fire'' (1978).

In Lorde's volume ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/930257509 The Black Unicorn]'' (1978), she describes her identity within the mythos of African female deities of creation, fertility, and warrior strength. This reclamation of African female identity both builds and challenges existing Black Arts ideas about [[pan-Africanism]]. While writers like [[Amiri Baraka]] and [[Ishmael Reed]] utilized African [[cosmology]] in a way that "furnished a repertoire of bold male gods capable of forging and defending an aboriginal black universe," in Lorde's writing "that warrior ethos is transferred to a female vanguard capable equally of force and fertility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kimerly W. Benston|authorlink1=Audre Lorde|editor1-last=Gates, Jr.|editor1-first=Henry Louis|editor2-last=Smith|editor2-first=Valerie A.|title=The Norton Anthology of African-American Literature: Volume 2|date=2014|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=978-0-393-92370-4|page=638|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorde's poetry became more open and personal as she grew older and became more confident in her sexuality. In ''[[Sister Outsider|Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches]]'', Lorde states, "Poetry is the way we help give name to the nameless so it can be thought…As they become known to and accepted by us, our feelings and the honest exploration of them become sanctuaries and spawning grounds for the most radical and daring ideas."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Taylor | first= Sherri | title = Acts of remembering: relationship in feminist therapy | journal = [[Women &amp; Therapy]], special issue: Sisters of the heart: women psychotherapist reflections on female friendships | volume = 36 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 23–34 | publisher = Taylor and Francis | doi = 10.1080/02703149.2012.720498 | date = 2013 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02703149.2012.720498 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sister Outsider'' also elaborates Lorde's challenge to European-American traditions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorde|first=Audre|title=[[Sister Outsider]]: Essays and Speeches|publisher=Crossing Press|location=Berkeley| isbn= 978-0895941411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prose===
''[[The Cancer Journals]]'' (1980), derived in part from personal journals written in the late seventies, and ''A Burst of Light'' (1988) both use non-fiction prose to preserve, explore, and reflect on Lorde's diagnosis, treatment, and recovery from [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name="W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc"/&gt; In both works, Lorde deals with Western notions of illness, treatment, and physical beauty and [[prosthesis]], as well as themes of death, fear of mortality, victimization versus survival, and inner power.&lt;ref name="Kulii"/&gt;

Lorde's deeply personal novel ''[[Zami: A New Spelling of My Name]]'' (1982), described as a "biomythography," chronicles her childhood and adulthood. The narrative deals with the evolution of Lorde's sexuality and self-awareness.&lt;ref name="W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc"/&gt;

In ''[[Sister Outsider|Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches]]'' (1984), Lorde asserts the necessity of communicating the experience of marginalized groups in order to make their struggles visible in a repressive society.&lt;ref name="W. W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc"/&gt; She emphasizes the need for different groups of people (particularly white women and African-American women) to find common ground in their lived experience.&lt;ref name="Kulii"/&gt;

One of her works in ''Sister Outsider'' is "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House."  Lorde questions the scope and ability for change to be instigated when examining problems through a racist, patriarchal lens.  She insists that women see differences between other women not as something to be tolerated, but something that is necessary to generate power and to actively "be" in the world.  This will create a community that embraces differences, which will ultimately lead to liberation.  Lorde elucidates, "Divide and conquer, in our world, must become define and empower."&lt;ref name="Lorde, Audre 2015"&gt;Lorde, Audre. "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House." ''This Bridge Called My Back,'' edited by Cherrie Moraga and Gloria Anzaldua, State University of New York Press, 2015, 94–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, one must educate themselves about the oppression of others because expecting a marginalized group to educate the oppressors is the continuation of racist, patriarchal thought. She explains that this is a major tool utilized by oppressors to keep the oppressed occupied with the master's concerns.  She concludes that in order to bring about real change, we cannot work within the racist, patriarchal framework because change brought about in that will not remain.&lt;ref name="Lorde, Audre 2015"/&gt;

Also in ''Sister Outsider'' is "The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action." Lorde discusses the importance of speaking, even when afraid because one's silence will not protect them from being marginalized and oppressed.  Many people fear to speak the truth because of how it may cause pain, however, one ought to put fear into perspective when deliberating whether to speak or not.  Lorde emphasizes that "the transformation of silence into language and action is a self-revelation, and that always seems fraught with danger."&lt;ref name="Lorde, Audre 2007"&gt;Lorde, Audre. "The Transformation of Silence into Language and Action.*" ''Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches,'' Ten Speed Press, 2007, 40–44.&lt;/ref&gt; People are afraid of others' reactions for speaking, but mostly for demanding visibility, which is essential to live.  Lorde adds, "We can sit in our corners mute forever while our sisters and ourselves are wasted, while our children are distorted and destroyed, while our earth is poisoned; we can sit in our safe corners mute as bottles, and we will still be no less afraid."&lt;ref name="Lorde, Audre 2007"/&gt; People are taught to respect their fear of speaking more than silence, but ultimately, the silence will choke us anyway, so we might as well speak the truth.

In ''Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference'', Lorde emphasizes the importance of educating others. However, she stresses that in order to educate others, one must first be educated. Empowering people who are doing the work does not mean using privilege to overstep and overpower such groups; but rather, privilege must be used to hold door open for other allies. Lorde describes the inherent problems within society by saying, "racism, the belief in the inherent superiority of one race over all others and thereby the right to dominance. Sexism, the belief in the inherent superiority of one sex over the other and thereby the right to dominance. Ageism. Heterosexism. Elitism. Classism." Lorde finds herself among some of these "deviant" groups in society, which set the tone for the status quo and what "not to be" in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Out There: Marginalization and Contemporary Cultures|last=Ferguson|first=Russell|publisher=The New Museum of Contemporary Art and Massachusetts Institute of Technology|year=1990|isbn=0-262-56064-X|location=United States of America|pages=|contributor=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorde argues that women feel pressure to conform to their "oneness" before recognizing the separation among them due to their "manyness", or aspects of their identity. She stresses that this behavior is exactly what "explains feminists' inability to forge the kind of alliances necessary to create a better world." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38016566|title=Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction|first=Rosemarie|last=Tong|isbn=0813332958|edition=Second|location=Boulder, Colorado|oclc=38016566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980, together with [[Barbara Smith]] and [[Cherríe Moraga]], she co-founded [[Kitchen Table: Women of Color Press]], the first U.S. publisher for women of color. Lorde was State Poet of New York from 1991 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/poetry-criticism/lorde-audre|title=Audre Lorde 1934–1992|publisher=Enotes.com|accessdate=2009-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
Lorde had several films that highlighted her journey as an activist in the 1980s and 1990s.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

''The Berlin Years: 1984-1992'' documented Lorde's time in Germany as she led [[Afro-Germans]] in a movement that would allow black people to establish identities for themselves outside of stereotypes and discrimination. After a long history of systemic racism in Germany, Lorde introduced a new sense of empowerment for minorities. As seen in the film, she walks through the streets with pride despite stares and words of discouragement. Including moments like these in a documentary was important for people to see during that time. It inspired them to take charge of their identities and discover who they are outside of the labels put on them by society. The film also educates people on the history of racism in Germany. This enables viewers to understand how Germany reached this point in history and how the society developed. Through her promotion of the study of history and her example of taking her experiences in her stride, she influenced people of many different backgrounds.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

The film documents Lorde's efforts to empower and encourage women to start the Afro-German movement. What began as a few friends meeting in a friend's home to get to know other Black people, turned into what is now known as the Afro-German momvement. Lorde inspired Black women to refute the designation of "[[Mulatto]]", a label which was imposed on them, and switch to the newly-coined, self-given "Afro-German", a term that conveyed a sense of pride. Lorde inspired AfroGerman women to create a community like-minded people. Some Afro-German women, such as [[Ika Hügel-Marshall|Ika Hugel-Marshall]], had never met another Black person and the meetings offered opportunities to express thoughts and feelings.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Theory==
Her writings are based on the "theory of difference," the idea that the binary opposition between men and women is overly simplistic; although feminists have found it necessary to present the illusion of a solid, unified whole, the category of women itself is full of subdivisions.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Lester C.; "Liabilities of Language: Audre Lorde Reclaiming Difference."&lt;/ref&gt;

Lorde identified issues of class, race, age, gender, and even health – this last was added as she battled cancer in her later years – as being fundamental to the female experience. She argued that, although differences in gender have received all the focus, it is essential that these other differences are also recognized and addressed. "Lorde," writes the critic Carmen Birkle, "puts her emphasis on the authenticity of experience. She wants her difference acknowledged but not judged; she does not want to be subsumed into the one general category of 'woman.'"&lt;ref&gt;Birkle, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is today known as [[intersectionality]].

While acknowledging that the differences between women are wide and varied, most of Lorde's works are concerned with two subsets that concerned her primarily – race and sexuality. In Ada Gay Griffin and [[Michelle Parkerson]]'s documentary ''A Litany for Survival: The Life and Work of Audre Lorde'', Lorde says, "Let me tell you first about what it was like being a Black woman poet in the '60s, from jump. It meant being invisible. It meant being really invisible. It meant being doubly invisible as a Black feminist woman and it meant being triply invisible as a Black lesbian and feminist".&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Ada Gay; Michelle Parkerson. [http://bombsite.com/issues/56/articles/1961 "Audre Lorde"], ''[[BOMB Magazine]]'' Summer 1996. Retrieved 19 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In her essay "[[The Erotic]] as Power," written in 1978 and collected in ''Sister Outsider'', Lorde theorizes [[the Erotic]] as a site of power for women only when they learn to release it from its suppression and embrace it. She proposes that the Erotic needs to be explored and experienced wholeheartedly, because it exists not only in reference to sexuality and the sexual, but also as a feeling of enjoyment, love, and thrill that is felt towards any task or experience that satisfies women in their lives, be it reading a book or loving one's job.&lt;ref name="New York 2007"&gt;Audre Lorde, "The Erotic as Power" [1978], republished in Audre Lorde, Sister Outsider (New York: Ten Speed Press, 2007), 53–58&lt;/ref&gt; She dismisses "the false belief that only by the suppression of the erotic within our lives and consciousness can women be truly strong. But that strength is illusory, for it is fashioned within the context of male models of power."&lt;ref&gt;Lorde, Audre. "Uses of the Erotic: Erotic as Power." ''Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches,'' The Crossing Press, 2007, pp. 53–59.&lt;/ref&gt; She explains how patriarchal society has misnamed it and used it against women, causing women to fear it.  Women also fear it because the erotic is powerful and a deep feeling. Women must share each other's power rather than use it without consent, which is abuse.  They should do it as a method to connect everyone in their differences and similarities. Utilizing the erotic as power allows women to use their knowledge and power to face the issues of racism, patriarchy, and our anti-erotic society.&lt;ref name="New York 2007"/&gt;

===Contemporary feminist thought===
Lorde set out to confront issues of racism in feminist thought. She maintained that a great deal of the scholarship of white feminists served to augment the oppression of black women, a conviction that led to angry confrontation, most notably in a blunt open letter addressed to the fellow radical lesbian feminist [[Mary Daly]], to which Lorde claimed she received no reply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sister Outsider|last=Lorde|first=Audre|year=1984|publisher=Crossing Press|location=Berkeley|page=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3Ct8Qw3de8C|isbn=1-58091-186-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daly's reply letter to Lorde,&lt;ref&gt;''Amazon Grace'' (N.Y.: Palgrave Macmillan, 1st ed.  2006), pp. 25–26 (reply text).&lt;/ref&gt; dated 4 months later, was found in 2003 in Lorde's files after she died.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazon Grace'', supra, pp. 22–26, esp. pp. 24–26 &amp; nn. 15–16, citing ''Warrior Poet: A Biography of Audre Lorde'', by Alexis De Veaux (N.Y.: W.W. Norton, 1st edn 2004) ({{ISBN|0-393-01954-3}} or {{ISBN|0-393-32935-6}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

This fervent disagreement with notable white feminists furthered Lorde's persona as an outsider: "In the institutional milieu of [[black feminist]] and black lesbian feminist scholars [...] and within the context of conferences sponsored by white feminist academics, Lorde stood out as an angry, accusatory, isolated black feminist lesbian voice".&lt;ref&gt;De Veaux, p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt;

The criticism was not one-sided: many white feminists were angered by Lorde's brand of feminism. In her 1984 essay "The Master's Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master's House,"&lt;ref&gt;''Sister Outsider'', pp. 110–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Lorde attacked underlying racism within feminism, describing it as unrecognized dependence on the [[patriarchy]]. She argued that, by denying difference in the category of women, white feminists merely furthered old systems of oppression and that, in so doing, they were preventing any real, lasting change. Her argument aligned white feminists who did not recognize race as a feminist issue with white male slave-masters, describing both as "agents of oppression."&lt;ref&gt;De Veaux, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lorde's comments on feminism===
Lorde held that the key tenets of feminism were that all forms of oppression were interrelated; creating change required taking a public stand; differences should not be used to divide; revolution is a process; feelings are a form of self-knowledge that can inform and enrich our activism; and acknowledging and experiencing our pain helps us to transcend it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.writingonglass.com/audre-lorde/|title=The Essential Audre Lorde|website=Writing on Glass|language=en-US|access-date=October 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Lorde's "Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference," she writes: "Certainly there are very real differences between us of race, age, and sex. But it is not those differences between us that are separating us. It is rather our refusal to recognize those differences, and to examine the distortions which result from our misnaming them and their effects upon human behavior and expectation." More specifically she states: "As white women ignore their built-in privilege of whiteness and define woman in terms of their own experience alone, then women of color become 'other'."&lt;ref name="Crossing Press" /&gt; Self-identified as "a forty-nine-year-old Black lesbian feminist socialist mother of two,"&lt;ref name="Crossing Press" /&gt; Lorde is considered as "other, deviant, inferior, or just plain wrong"&lt;ref name="Crossing Press" /&gt; in the eyes of the normative "white male heterosexual capitalist" social hierarchy. "We speak not of human difference, but of human deviance,"&lt;ref name="Crossing Press" /&gt; she writes. In this respect, her ideology coincides with [[womanism]], which "allows black women to affirm and celebrate their color and culture in a way that feminism does not."

In her "Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference, Western European History conditions people to see human differences. Human differences are seen in "simplistic opposition" and there is no difference recognized by the culture at large. There are three specific ways Western European culture responds to human difference. First, we begin by ignoring our differences. Next, is copying each other's differences. And finally, we destroy each other's differences that are perceived as "lesser".

Lorde defines racism, sexism, ageism, heterosexism, elitism and classism altogether and explains that an "ism" is an idea that what is being privileged is superior and has the right to govern anything else. Belief in the superiority of one aspect of the mythical norm. Lorde explains that a mythical norm is what all bodies '''should''' be. The mythical norm of US culture is white, thin, male, young, heterosexual, Christian, financially secure.

===Influences on black feminism===
Lorde's work on [[black feminism]] continues to be examined by scholars today.  Jennifer C. Nash examines how black feminists acknowledge their identities and find love for themselves through those differences.&lt;ref name="Nash, Jennifer C 2011"&gt;Nash, Jennifer C. "Practicing Love: Black Feminism, Love-Politics, And Post-Intersectionality." ''Meridians: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism 2'' (2011): 1. ''Literature Resource Center.'' Web. 4 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nash cites Lorde, who writes: "I urge each one of us here to reach down into that deep place of knowledge inside herself and touch that terror and loathing of any difference that lives there. See whose face it wears. Then the personal as the political can begin to illuminate all our choices."&lt;ref name="Nash, Jennifer C 2011"/&gt; Nash explains that Lorde is urging black feminists to embrace politics rather than fear it, which will lead to an improvement in society for them.  Lorde adds, "Black women sharing close ties with each other, politically or emotionally, are not the enemies of Black men. Too frequently, however, some Black men attempt to rule by fear those Black women who are more ally than enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=March 18, 2018|title=Audre Lorde on Being a Black Lesbian Feminist|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lorde/feminist.htm|website=www.english.illinois.edu|publisher=''Modern American Poetry''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorde’s 1979 essay “Sexism: An American Disease in Blackface” is a sort of rallying cry to confront sexism in the black community in order to eradicate the violence within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thefeministwire.com/2014/02/the-magic-and-fury-of-audre-lorde-feminist-praxis-and-pedagogy/|title=The Magic and Fury of Audre Lorde: Feminist Praxis and Pedagogy – The Feminist Wire|date=February 24, 2014|work=The Feminist Wire|access-date=October 28, 2017|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lorde insists that the fight between black women and men must end in order to end racist politics.

=== Personal identity ===
Throughout Lorde's career she included the idea of a collective identity in many of her poems and books. She did not just identify with one category but she wanted to celebrate all parts of herself equally.&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Yakini B. (2004). "Writing Power: Identity Complexities and the Exotic Erotic in Audre Lorde's writing". ''Studies in the Literary Imagination''. '''37''': 22–36.&lt;/ref&gt; She was known to describe herself as black, lesbian, feminist, poet, mother, etc. In her novel ''[[Zami: A New Spelling of My Name]]''  Lorde focuses on how her many different identities shape her life and the different experiences she has because of them. She shows us that personal identity is found within the connections between seemingly different parts of life. Personal identity is often associated with the visual aspect of a person, but as Lies Xhonneux theorizes when identity is singled down to just to what you see, some people, even within minority groups, can become invisible.&lt;ref&gt;Xhonneux, Lies (2012). "The Classic Coming out Novel: Unacknowledged Challenges to the Heterosexual Mainstream". ''College Literature''. '''39''': 94–118.&lt;/ref&gt; In her late book [[The Cancer Journals]] she said "If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive." This is important because an identity is more than just what people see or think of a person, it is something that must be defined by the individual. "The House of Difference" is a phrase that has stuck with Lorde's identity theories. Her idea was that everyone is different from each other and it is the collective differences that make us who we are, instead of one little thing. Focusing on all of the aspects of identity brings people together more than choosing one piece of an identity.&lt;ref&gt;Leonard, Keith D. (September 28, 2012). [https://muse.jhu.edu/article/486572 ""Which Me Will Survive": Rethinking Identity, Reclaiming Audre Lorde"]. ''Callaloo''. '''35''' (3): 758–77. {{doi|10.1353/cal.2012.0100}}. {{ISSN|1080-6512}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

While highlighting Lorde’s intersectional points through a lens that focuses on race, gender, socioeconomic status/class and so on, we must also embrace one of her salient identities; lesbianism. She was a lesbian and navigated spaces interlocking her womanhood, gayness and blackness in ways that trumped white feminism, predominately white gay spaces and toxic black male masculinity. Lorde used those identities within her work and ultimately it guided her to create pieces that embodied lesbianism in a light that educated people of many social classes and identities on the issues black lesbian women face in society.

=== Contributions to the third-world feminist discourse ===
Around the 1960s, [[Second-wave feminism]] became centered around discussions and debates about capitalism as a “biased, discriminatory, and unfair” &lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Development and Social Change: A Global Perspective|last=McMichael|first=Phillip|publisher=Pine Forge Press|year=2008|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks, California|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; institution, especially within the context of the rise of [[Globalization]]. [[Third-wave feminism]] emerged in the 1990s after calls for “a more differentiated feminism” by first-world women of color and women in developing nations, such as Audre Lorde, who maintained her critiques of first world feminism for tending to veer toward "third-world homogenization.” This term was coined by radical dependency theorist, [[Andre Gunder Frank]], to describe the inconsideration of the unique histories of developing countries (in the process of forming development agendas).&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Audre Lorde was critical of the first world feminist movement “for downplaying sexual, racial, and class differences” and the unique power structures and cultural factors which vary by region, nation, community, etc.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Theories of Development: Contentions, Arguments, Alternatives|last=Hartwick|first=Elaine|last2=Peet|first2=Richard|publisher=Guilford Press|year=1999|isbn=|edition=2nd|location=New York City|pages=161–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other feminist scholars of this period, like [[Chandra Talpade Mohanty]], echoed Lorde’s sentiments. Collectively they called for a “feminist politics of location, which theorized that women were subject to particular assemblies of oppression, and therefore that all women emerged with particular rather than generic identities”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;While they encouraged a global community of women, Audre Lorde, in particular, felt the [[Cultural homogenization]] of third-world women could only lead to a disguised form of oppression with its own forms of "othering" ([[Other (philosophy)]]) women in developing nations into figures of deviance and non-actors in theories of their own development. Audre Lorde cautioned against the “institutionalized rejection of difference” in her essay, “Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference,” fearing that when “...we do not develop tools for using human difference as a springboard for creative change within our lives [,] we speak not of human difference, but of human deviance”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Lorde saw this already happening with the lack of inclusion of literature from women of color in the second-wave feminist discourse. She found that “the literature of women of Color [was] seldom included in women’s literature courses and almost never in other literature courses, nor in women’s studies as a whole” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and pointed to the “othering” of women of color and women in developing nations as the reason. By homogenizing these communities and ignoring their difference, “...women of Color become ‘other,’ the outside whose experiences and tradition is too ‘alien’ to comprehend”,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and thus, seemingly unworthy of scholarly attention and differentiated scholarship. Audre Lorde called for the embracing of these differences. In the same essay, she proclaimed, “now we must recognize difference among women who are our equals, neither inferior nor superior, and devise ways to use each others’ difference to enrich our visions and our joint struggles” &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp; Doing so would lead to more inclusive and thus, more effective global feminist goals. Lorde theorized that true development in Third World communities would and even “the future of our earth may depend upon the ability of all women to identify and develop new definitions of power and new patterns of relating across differences." &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp; In other words, the individual voices and concerns of women and color and women in developing nations would be the first step in attaining the autonomy with the potential to develop and transform their communities effectively in the age (and future) of [[Globalization]].

In a keynote speech at the National Third-World Gay and Lesbian Conference on October 13, 1979 titled, “When will the ignorance end?” Lorde reminded and cautioned the attendees, “There is a wonderful diversity of groups within this conference, and a wonderful diversity between us within those groups. That diversity can be a generative force, a source of energy fueling our visions of action for the future. We must not let diversity be used to tear us apart from each other, nor from our communities that is the mistake they made about us. I do not want us to make it ourselves….and we must never forget those lessons: that we cannot separate our oppressions, nor yet are they the same” &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=I Am Your Sister: Collected and Unpublished Writings of Audre Lorde|last=Lorde|first=Audre|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|isbn=|editor-last=Byrd|editor-first=Rudolph|location=Oxford|pages=209–212|editor-last2=Cole|editor-first2=Johnetta|editor-last3=Guy-Sheftall|editor-first3=Beverly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; In other words, while common experiences in racism, sexism, and homophobia had brought the group together and that commonality could not be ignored, there must still be a recognition of their individualized humanity. Years later, on August 27, 1983, Audre Lorde delivered an address apart of the “Litany of Commitment” at the [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom]]. “Today we march,” she said, “lesbians and gay men and our children, standing in our own names together with all our struggling sisters and brothers here and around the world, in the Middle East, in Central America, in the Caribbean and South Africa, sharing our commitment to work for a joint livable future. We know we do not have to become copies of each other in order to be able to work together. We know that when we join hands across the table of our difference, our diversity gives us great power. When we can arm ourselves with the strength and vision from all of our diverse communities, then we will in truth all be free at last.” &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Afro-German feminist scholar and author, Dr. Marian Kraft interviewed Audre Lorde in 1986 to discuss a number of her literary works and poems. In this interview, Audre Lorde articulated hope for the next wave of feminist scholarship and discourse. When asked by Miriam Kraft, “Do you see any development of the awareness about the importance of differences within the white feminist movement?” Lorde replied with both critiques and hope; “Well, the feminist movement, the white feminist movement, has been notoriously slow to recognize that racism is a feminist concern, not one that is altruistic, but one that is part and parcel of feminist consciousness... I think, in fact, though, that things are slowing changing and that there are white women now who recognize that in the interest of genuine coalition, they must see that we are not the same. [[Black feminism]] is not white feminism in [[Blackface]]. It is an intricate movement coming out of the lives, aspirations, and realities of Black women. We share somethings with white women, and there are other things we do not share. We must be able to come together around those things we share.” &amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Audre Lorde's Transnational Legacies|last=Broeck|first=Sabine|last2=Bolaski|first2=Stella|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=Boston|pages=45–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Miriam Kraft summarized Lorde’s position when reflecting on the interview; “Yes, we have different historical, social, and cultural backgrounds, different sexual orientations; different aspirations and visions; different skin colors and ages. But we share common experiences and a common goal. Our experiences are rooted in the oppressive forces of racism in various societies, and our goal is our mutual concern to work toward ‘a future which has not yet been’ in Audre’s words.” &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Lorde and womanism==
Lorde's criticism of feminists of the 1960s identified issues of race, class, age, gender and sexuality. Similarly, author and poet [[Alice Walker]] coined the term "[[womanist]]" in an attempt to distinguish black female and minority female experience from "[[feminism]]". While "feminism" is defined as "a collection of movements and ideologies that share a common goal: to define, establish, and achieve equal political, economic, cultural, personal, and social rights for women" by imposing simplistic opposition between "men" and "women,"&lt;ref name="Crossing Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lorde|first1=Audre|title=Sister Outsider: Essays and Speeches|date=1984|publisher=Crossing Press|pages=114–23}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theorists and activists of the 1960s and 1970s usually neglected the experiential difference caused by factors such as race and gender among different social groups.

===Womanism and its ambiguity===
Womanism's existence naturally opens various definitions and interpretations. Alice Walker's comments on womanism, that "womanist is to feminist as purple is to lavender," suggests that the scope of study of womanism includes and exceeds that of feminism. In its narrowest definition, womanism is the black feminist movement that was formed in response to the growth of racial stereotypes in the feminist movement. In a broad sense, however, womanism is "a social change perspective based upon the everyday problems and experiences of black women and other women of minority demographics," but also one that "more broadly seeks methods to eradicate inequalities not just for black women, but for all people" by imposing [[socialist]] ideology and equality. However, because womanism is open to interpretation, one of the most common criticisms of womanism is its lack of a unified set of tenets. It is also criticized for its lack of discussion of sexuality.

Lorde actively strove for the change of culture within the feminist community by implementing womanist ideology. In the journal "Anger Among Allies: Audre Lorde's 1981 Keynote Admonishing the [[National Women's Studies Association]]," it is stated that her speech contributed to communication with scholars' understanding of human biases. While "anger, marginalized communities, and US Culture" are the major themes of the speech, Lorde implemented various communication techniques to shift subjectivities of the "white feminist" audience.&lt;ref name="Academic Search Complete"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Olson|first1=Lester|title=Anger Among Allies: Audre Lorde's 1981 Keynote Admonishing The National Women's Studies Association|journal=Quarterly Journal of Speech|date=2011|volume=97.3|issue=3|pages=283–308|doi=10.1080/00335630.2011.585169}}&lt;/ref&gt; She further explained that "we are working in a context of oppression and threat, the cause of which is certainly not the angers which lie between us, but rather that virulent hatred leveled against all women, people of color, lesbians and gay men, poor people – against all of us who are seeking to examine the particulars of our lives as we resist our oppressions, moving towards coalition and effective action."&lt;ref name="Academic Search Complete"/&gt;

===Critique of womanism===
A major critique of womanism is its failure to explicitly address homosexuality within the female community. Very little womanist literature relates to lesbian or bisexual issues, and many scholars consider the reluctance to accept homosexuality accountable to the gender simplistic model of womanism. According to Lorde's essay "Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference", "the need for unity is often misnamed as a need for homogeneity." She writes: "A fear of lesbians, or of being accused of being a lesbian, has led many Black women into testifying against themselves."

Contrary to this, Lorde was very open to her own sexuality and sexual awakening. In ''Zami: A New Spelling of My Name'', her "biomythography" (a term coined by Lorde that combines "biography" and "mythology") she writes, "Years afterward when I was grown, whenever I thought about the way I smelled that day, I would have a fantasy of my mother, her hands wiped dry from the washing, and her apron untied and laid neatly away, looking down upon me lying on the couch, and then slowly, thoroughly, our touching and caressing each other's most secret places."&lt;ref name="Academic Search Complete-2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hua|first1=Anh|title=Audre Lorde's Zami, Erotic Embodied Memory, and the Affirmation of Difference|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|date=2015|volume=36.1|pages=113–35|doi=10.5250/fronjwomestud.36.1.0113}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar Anh Hua, Lorde turns female abjection – menstruation, female sexuality, and female incest with the mother – into powerful scenes of female relationship and connection, thus subverting patriarchal heterosexist culture.&lt;ref name="Academic Search Complete-2" /&gt;

With such a strong ideology and open-mindedness, Lorde's impact on lesbian society is also significant. An attendee of a 1978 reading of Lorde's essay [[The Erotic|"Uses for the Erotic: the Erotic as Power"]] says: "She asked if all the lesbians in the room would please stand. Almost the entire audience rose."&lt;ref name=JSTOR&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aptheker|first1=Bettina|title=Audre Lorde, Presente|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|date=2012|volume=autumn/winter|pages=289–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tributes==
The [[Callen-Lorde Community Health Center]] is an organization in New York City named for [[Michael Callen]] and  Lorde, which is dedicated to providing medical health care to the city's LGBT population without regard to ability to pay. Callen-Lorde is the only primary care center in New York City created specifically to serve the LGBT community.

The [[Audre Lorde Project]], founded in 1994, is a [[Brooklyn]]-based organization for LGBT people of color. The organization concentrates on community organizing and radical nonviolent activism around progressive issues within New York City, especially relating to LGBT communities, AIDS and HIV activism, pro-immigrant activism, prison reform, and organizing among youth of color.

The [[Audre Lorde Award]] is an annual literary award presented by [[Publishing Triangle]] to honor works of lesbian poetry, first presented in 2001.

In 2014 Lorde was inducted into the [[Legacy Walk]], an outdoor public display in [[Chicago|Chicago, Illinois]] that celebrates [[LGBT]] history and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-gay-plaque-wrigleyville-20141012-story.html|title=Legacy Walk honors LGBT 'guardian angels'|date=11 October 2014|work=chicagotribune.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advocate.com/pride/2014/10/11/photos-7-lgbt-heroes-honored-plaques-chicagos-legacy-walk?page=full|title=Photos: 7 LGBT Heroes Honored With Plaques in Chicago's Legacy Walk|work=Advocate.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last years==
Lorde was first diagnosed with [[breast cancer]] in 1978 and underwent a [[mastectomy]]. Six years later, she was diagnosed with [[liver cancer]]. After her diagnosis, she wrote ''[[The Cancer Journals]],'' which won the [[American Library Association]] Gay Caucus Book of the Year Award in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lorde/life.htm|title=Audre Lorde's Life and Career|publisher=|accessdate=29 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was featured as the subject of a documentary called ''A Litany for Survival: The Life and Work of Audre Lorde,'' which shows her as an author, poet, human rights activist, feminist, lesbian, a teacher, a survivor, and a crusader against bigotry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/133603/A-Litany-for-Survival-The-Life-and-Work-of-Audre-Lorde/overview | work=The New York Times |title=A Litany for Survival: The Life and Work of Audre Lorde (1995)}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is quoted as saying: "What I leave behind has a life of its own. I've said this about poetry; I've said it about children. Well, in a sense I'm saying it about the very artifact of who I have been."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Litany For Survival: The Life and Work of Audre Lorde|url=https://www.pbs.org/pov/alitanyforsurvival/film_description.php|work=POV|publisher=PBS|date=June 18, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1991 until her death, she was the New York State [[Poet laureate|Poet Laureate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/main/poets/newyork.html|work=US State Poets Laureate|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=May 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When designating her as such, then-governor Mario Cuomo said or Lorde, "“Her imagination is charged by a sharp sense of racial injustice and cruelty, of sexual prejudice…She cries out against it as the voice of indignant humanity. Audre Lorde is the voice of the eloquent outsider who speaks in a language that can reach and touch people everywhere.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://alp.org/about/audre|title=About Audre Lorde {{!}} The Audre Lorde Project|website=The Audre Lorde Project|language=en|access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, she received the [[Bill Whitehead Award]] for Lifetime Achievement from [[Publishing Triangle]].

==Personal life==
In 1962, Lorde married attorney Edwin Rollins. She and Rollins divorced in 1970 after having two children, Elizabeth and Jonathan. In 1966, Lorde became head librarian at Town School Library in New York City, where she remained until 1968.&lt;ref name="Kulii"/&gt;

From 1977 to 1978, Lorde had a brief affair with the sculptor and painter [[Mildred Thompson]]. The two met in Nigeria in 1977 at the Second World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture ([[FESTAC 77]]). Their affair ran its course during the time that Thompson lived in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name="de_Veaux"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Biography of Audre Lorde|last=De Veaux|first=Alexis|last2=|first2=|publisher=W.W.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12518">'''Billionaires for Bush''' was a [[culture jamming]] political [[street theater]] organization that satirically purported to support [[George W. Bush]], drawing attention to policies which were perceived to benefit [[corporation]]s and the super-wealthy. The group would typically dress as parodies of wealthy "establishment" figures in tuxedos while proclaiming slogans such as "Two Million Jobs Lost—It's a Start".

A secret [[New York City Police Department]] intelligence report, based on undercover surveillance of the group in 2003 and 2004 in advance of the [[2004 Republican National Convention]] in [[New York City]], described the Billionaires as "an activist group forged as a mockery of the current president and political policies".&lt;ref name=Satire/&gt;

==History==
===Forbes 1999===
The organization had first been founded by Andrew Boyd as "Billionaires for Forbes", but Forbes left the 2000 race for the Republican Presidential nomination early due to a lack of adequate voter support. In 1999, Billionaires were present as [[Steve Forbes]] announced his candidacy for President and jeered him as he signed a [[flat tax]] pledge in [[New Hampshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Zuckman, Jill. [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADDD973B3F2A6A&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "FORBES SIGNS N.H. ANTITAX PLEDGE FLAT-TAX PROPOSAL PROTESTED AS ELITIST BY BOSTON GROUP"], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', March 17, 1999. Accessed August 18, 2008. "But as he stood with his back to the state capitol and promoted his proposal to eliminate the current federal tax code and institute a 17 percent flat tax, protesters from Boston began chanting ''billionaires for Forbes'' ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The Billionaire Manual describes the action:

&lt;blockquote&gt;They wore conservative jackets and ties (but no bowler hats, etc.) and carried innocuous signs such as "Run, Steve, Run." Happy to have grass-roots support, the Forbes handlers (who believed the Billionaires were students from a nearby business school) placed them in front of the cameras, very near to the podium from which Forbes was speaking. However, each of their signs had another sign behind it. And behind their banner (which read "Forbes 2000: He wants YOU to win") was another banner, waiting. At the most dramatic moment of his announcement, the Billionaires flipped their signs, and pulled away the large banner to reveal one which read: "Billionaires for Forbes: Because Inequality isn't Growing Fast Enough." The Billionaires started chanting "Let workers pay the tax so investors can relax!" and other slogans. Forbes and his handlers were completely thrown off, a little tussle ensued, and the Billionaires were pushed off to the side away from the cameras. Not wanting to miss the action, half the TV crews left the Forbes speech to cover the Billionaires. The action got lots of coverage.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Bush (or Gore) 2000===
During the [[2000 U.S. presidential election]] the organization was led by Andrew Boyd and Jenny Levison as "Billionaires for Bush (or Gore)," with the message that whichever candidate became president, corporations and the wealthy were guaranteed to benefit. The group spoke out under the motto "Because Economic Inequality Is Not Growing Fast Enough".&lt;ref&gt;DiFilippo, Dana. [http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DN&amp;s_site=philly&amp;p_multi=PI|DN&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB7312136BDD38B&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM "FUNNY WAY TO RUN A PROTEST"], ''[[The Philadelphia Daily News]]'', July 29, 2000. Accessed August 18, 2008. "THE WAY MILLIE O'Nair sees it, it doesn't matter whether George W. Bush or Al Gore wins the presidency. ... ''Whoever wins, we win!'' said O'Nair, who co-chairs Billionaires for Bush (or Gore).&lt;/ref&gt;

The group appeared at the [[2000 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Los Angeles, California]], satirically praising major corporations for their financial support of the convention by attempting to deliver thank you cards to [[FleetBoston Financial|Fleet Bank]], [[Fidelity Investments]] and [[Verizon Communications]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/10/03/debate.protests.01/index.html "Nader tossed off grounds at debate site"], ''[[CNN]]'', October 3, 2000. Accessed August 18, 2008. "Others—dressed in fake pearls and top hats—dubbed themselves ''Billionaires for Bush or Gore'', and satirically praised the corporations helping underwrite the debate.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Billionaires planned a "Million Billionaires March" at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]] in [[Philadelphia]] held the day before the convention. Other activities included a "Vigil for [[corporate welfare]]" and an auction of corporate advertising rights for the [[Liberty Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;Shaffer, Gwen. [http://www.citypaper.net/articles/072700/con.counter.side.shtml "C'mon Buy!"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070621152630/http://www.citypaper.net/articles/072700/con.counter.side.shtml |date=2007-06-21 }}, ''[[Philadelphia City Paper]]'', July 27, 2000. Accessed August 18, 2008. "The Billionaires may be a hoax, but the events they’ve planned are very real, starting with a Million Billionaire March the day before the convention."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bush 2004===
At a March 2004 fundraiser on [[Long Island]] attended by President Bush, Billionaires for Bush came to show their "support", with men dressed in tuxedos with top hats and women in evening gowns and long gloves. The groups laminated posters featured such slogans as "Leave No Billionaire Behind" and "Corporations Are People Too."&lt;ref&gt;Hitt, Jack. [https://www.nytimes.com/2004/03/28/magazine/28ENCOUNTER.html?position=&amp;ei=5007&amp;en=2a84e4f3a12ac7a0&amp;ex=1395810000&amp;partner=USERLAND&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position= "The Birth of the Meta-Protest Rally?"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 28, 2004. Accessed August 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Their largest events to date took place as part of the [[2004 Republican National Convention protest activity]]. A separate group, however, continued on in the plague-on-both-your-houses style as "Billionaires For Bush Or Kerry".

A "Million Billionaires March" on July 27, 2004, in conjunction with the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], attracted 150 marchers who presented a faux check made out for the amount of "whatever it takes" to the local offices of the Republican Party, as part of an effort to "defeat" Kerry.&lt;ref&gt;Vozick-Levinson, Simon. [http://www.thecrimson.com/printerfriendly.aspx?ref=503234 "'Wealthy' Protesters Make Case Outside DNC"], ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', July 30, 2004. Accessed August 18, 2008. "We therefore call upon all loyal People of Wealth to defy the Democratic National Convention and converge on the streets of Boston for a Million Billionaire March on July 27. And converge they did—150 of them, according to those who attended—to take back the streets for the silver-spoon set and present a symbolic check in the amount of “whatever it takes” to the local GOP headquarters."&lt;/ref&gt;

Lawsuits filed against the [[New York City Police Department]] after the 2004 Republican Convention uncovered the fact that Billionaires for Bush had been among groups infiltrated by the NYPD by its undercover officers gathering intelligence in advance of the convention.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/19/opinion/19tue4.html?ref=opinion "Editorial: The Convention Papers"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 18, 2008. Accessed August 19, 2008."The department later said that its actions were based on intelligence gathered by a special unit of undercover officers who had infiltrated dozens of protest groups, including innocuous ad hoc outfits like the comical Billionaires for Bush."&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 and beyond===
The group remained active after 2004, but was less prominent. It used its established [[meme]] to raise awareness to a myriad of economic issues including [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] privatization, the [[Iraq War]], the [[Estate Tax]] and [[gentrification]].

The group was led by a triumvirate of co-chairs Elissa Jiji, [[Marco Ceglie]], and Melody Bates.

==Attire==
Members typically dressed in stereotypically wealthy attire, such as [[tuxedo (clothing)|tuxedos]] and [[top hat]]s or [[evening gown]]s and [[pearl]]s and adopt names like "Mo Bludfer Oyle" (more blood for oil, a reference to the Iraq war) and "Phil T. Rich" (filthy rich).

Members also dressed in less stereotypical attire to perform more subtle pranks, as described in the Forbes example, above.

==Events==
Examples of Billionaire events include:
* Musical entertainment at anti-Bush events
* Thanking [[George W. Bush]] on his birthday for their tax cuts
* Protesting protests of the Bush administration

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="50459">'''Child migration''' or "children in migration or mobility" (sometimes more generally "children on the move"&lt;ref name="Child Labour p. 30"&gt;{{cite book | title=Migrant Children in Child Labour, A vulnerable group in need of attention, International Organisation of Migration, Children on the Move |author1=Van de Glind, Hans  |author2=Anne Kou | year=2013 | pages=27–43, p. 30.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the movement of people ages 3–18 within or across political borders, with or [[Unaccompanied minor|without their parents]] or a [[legal guardian]], to another country or region. They may travel with or without legal [[travel documents]]. They may arrive to the destination country as [[refugees]], [[asylum seekers]], or [[economic migrants]].

== Reasons for migration ==
The motivations for children to migrate are as diverse as the individuals who migrate. They include economic reasons, educational aspirations, reasons related to gender or culture, personal motivations as well as emergencies, natural disasters, persecution and humanitarian crises. Some children leave in search of better opportunities while others escape violence, exploitation, abuse or conflict. Multiple reasons often coincide. When parents migrate or separate, children may move to another place or country with one or both parents, or they might be left behind by their parents and are then indirectly affected by migration.&lt;ref name="Child Labour p. 30"/&gt;

== Rights of children in migration and mobility ==

=== The right to be heard ===
The right to be heard is a child rights principle as defined by the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]]. According to Article 12 of the Convention, children have the right to express their views in all matters affecting them, and their views have to be given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. This right applies equally to children’s participation in social and political matters as well as in judicial and administrative proceedings. As a general principle, the child’s right to be heard reflects the concept of children's ‘agency’, viewing children not only as vulnerable persons in need of special protection, but also as informed decision makers, rights holders and active members of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Heart of the Matter, Assessing credibility when children apply for asylum in the European Union | publisher=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees | year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Working with Children and Young People Subject to Immigration Control, Guidelines for best practice, Second Edition, Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association | author=Crawley, Heaven | year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many children are reluctant to share information with the authorities in the country of destination due to fears that disclosing information might not be in their interest and that telling their story might lead to being returned to their country of origin. Children might have been instructed by third persons to reveal only certain parts of their story, there might be threats and fears of reprisals involved, and the child might not trust the police and local authorities will be able to protect them. A reception system that demonstrates respect and upholds the dignity of the child can achieve to foster a sense of trust in the child towards the officials and professionals whom she or he meets with. Interpreters might influence the information gathering process in asylum procedures and criminal investigations as they affect how the child’s story is being understood and perceived. Inaccurate translation might compromise the child’s statement, leading to decisions on the basis of incorrect information. This relates not only to the content translated but also to the style and semantic choices made by the child and how the interpreters convey the message.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley, Heaven, Working with Children and Young People Subject to Immigration Control, Guidelines for best practice, Second Edition, Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Best interests’ assessment and determination ===
[[Best interests]] is defined in Article 3 of the [[UN Convention on the Rights of the Child]], which says that “in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by public or private social welfare institutions, courts of law, administrative authorities or legislative bodies, the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration”. Assessing the best interests of a child means to evaluate and balance “all the elements necessary to make a decision in a specific situation for a specific individual child or group of children”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 14 (2013), par. 47 | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right of the child to have her or his best interests taken as a primary consideration means that the child’s interests have high priority and are not just one of several considerations. The assessment is specific to the child as an individual, making it important to establish a trust-based relationship with the child and to communicate effectively in a language that the girl or boy understands. The assessments ideally involves a multi-disciplinary team of qualified professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, United Nations Children’s Fund, Safe and Sound, What States can do to ensure respect for the best interests of [[Unaccompanied minor|unaccompanied and separated children]] in Europe, 2014. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR Guidelines on Formal Determination of the Best Interests of the Child, 2006. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Risk and resilience assessments are a central component of the best interests’ determination process because they consider the context of the countries of destination and origin and also how the risks and resiliency of the child will change on the basis of any decision taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=CARDET, Defence for Children International – Italy et al., IMPACT, Improving Monitoring and Protection Systems Against Child Trafficking and Exploitation, Transnational Analysis, 2013. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Conclusion on Children at Risk, Executive Committee Conclusions, No. 107(LVIII), 5 October 2007. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In transnational cases, a comprehensive best interests’ assessment and determination process considers the following:

* Establishing the child’s identity and the identity of any accompanying persons and the quality of their relations
* Case assessment, including the following components: 
** Hearing the child 
** Assessment of the child’s situation, background and needs 
** Social situation and family assessment
** Gathering evidence including through forensic examinations and interviews with the child 
** Risk and security assessments
** Mapping sources of support, skills, potentials and resources for empowerment 
* Developing a life project 
* Comprehensive child impact assessment of any potential decisions 
* Identification of a durable solution 
* Continued assessments during the implementation of the durable solution with due follow-up, review and monitoring, and adjustments to the durable solution arrangements, if and as required, according to the best interests of the child

In the country of Ghana, there is a topic focused on the education comparison between migrant and non-migrant students. It is shown that the non-migrant students received more attention, and therefore, scored higher than the migrant students. More attention needs to be shown to the migrants just as much as its shown to all the other students. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tamanja|first1=Emmanuel|title=Child Migration and Academic Performance: The Case of Basic Education in Ghana|website=eric.ed.gov |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1103112|publisher=Tamanja, Emmanuel Makabu J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Right to non-discrimination: Status, access and jurisdiction ===
The Convention on the Rights of the Child affords a broad protection from discrimination and the essential and equal inalienable rights afforded to all human beings. It  stipulates that States Parties shall respect and ensure the rights set forth in the Convention to each child within their jurisdiction without discrimination of any kind, irrespective of the child’s or his or her parent’s or legal guardian’s race, color, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national, ethnic or social origin, property, disability, birth or other status.&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] Article 2.1&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights afforded under the Convention apply to non-national children, regardless of their immigration status or the migration status of their parents. This includes children who are visiting, refugees, children of migrant workers and undocumented children. The right to non-discrimination entitles each child to immediate assistance and support while the situation of the child and her or his best interests are being assessed. Non-discrimination does not imply that a child is granted an automatic permit of stay, but that a decision is taken on the basis of the [[best interests]]’ determination, whether a child shall be [[Repatriation#Difference between repatriation and return|returned]] or whether the country of destination assumes jurisdiction over the child.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission, Tackling Multiple Discrimination: Practices, Policies and Laws, Directorate-General for Employment, Social Affairs and Equal Opportunities, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, Handbook on European Non-discrimination Law, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

While assessing the child’s case and situation, state authorities have a responsibility to clarify which state has the jurisdiction over a child and, if required and appropriate, transfer or establish jurisdiction in the country of destination. When jurisdiction over a non-national child remains unclear, the child risks staying in a state of uncertainty and might benefit only from temporary services and protection measures, until the child’s status is fully regularised or the child returns to the country holding jurisdiction. Common factors that affect jurisdiction include: 
* There could be a case pending at court in which the child is involved, 
* Social services in another country may have been monitoring the child and her or his family; 
* The child’s situation may have been under law enforcement investigations in another country, including where child trafficking is suspected;
* The child may have handed in an asylum application in another country; 
* The child may be registered as a ‘missing child’ abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Hague Conference on Private International Law, Practical Handbook on the Operation of the 1996 Child Protection Convention, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development ===
The rights of the child to life, survival and development is afforded under Article 6 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. These rights are recognized by

States and are related to survival, security and health as a precondition for physical development as well as the mental, spiritual, moral, intellectual, cognitive, emotional and sociology-cultural development of the child. This is in effort to ensure the maximum survival, growth and potential of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohchr.org/EN/ProfessionalInterest/Pages/CRC.aspx|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child|website=www.ohchr.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Post-deportation Monitoring pp68-69"&gt;{{cite web | title=Podeszfa, Leana and Friederike Vetter, Post-deportation Monitoring: Why, how and by whom?, University of Oxford, Refugee Study Centre, Forced Migration Review, Detention, alternatives to detention and deportation, Issue 44, September 2013, pp. 68-69, p. 68. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Between a rock and a hard place"&gt;{{cite web | title=Refugee Council, ‘Between a rock and a hard place: the dilemma facing refused asylum seekers’, December 2012. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of care has a direct effect on a child's development. Promoting the child’s developmental rights and needs means enabling her to grow up in her family of origin or in a family-based or family-like alternative care placement, wherever this is in the best interests of the child. The care arrangements and access to quality services for health and education are important when assessing the child’s developmental needs.&lt;ref name="Post-deportation Monitoring pp68-69"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Between a rock and a hard place"/&gt;

The following factors are relevant when assessing the development needs of a child (with reference to the relevant articles under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child):
* The right to preserve her or his identity, including nationality, name and family relations (Article 8);
* The continuity in the child's care and upbringing, with due regard to the child's ethnic, religious, cultural and linguistic background (Article 20); 
* The right of the child to enjoy the highest attainable standard of health (Article 24); 
* The right of every child to a standard of living adequate to the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development (Article 27);  
* Access to education (Articles 28 and 29);  
* The right of the child to rest and leisure, to engage in play and recreational activities appropriate to her or his age (Article 31).

=== Access to justice ===

==== Children and justice in transnational cases ====
Children on the move sometimes are affected by or are in conflict with the law, including with cross-border family disputes and matters of parental responsibility and contact, as asylum seekers or victims of crime and, in some cases, as children who are in conflict with the law for immigration matters or for illegal and criminal matters. Some children in conflict with the law are actually victims of crime. International and European law provide for clear standards regulating the treatment, rights and entitlement of children in contact with the judiciary, as victims, defendants or perpetrators of crime.

==== Child victims of crime ====
The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child prohibits the exploitation of children in any form and in any context (Articles 19, 32-36). Any child who is exposed to violence, exploitation or abuse can be considered a victim of crime and enjoys the correlated rights and entitlements, including access to assistance, protection and support, services for recovery and rehabilitation, access to justice, with due procedural safeguards in any related legal or administrative proceedings. Children at risk of exploitation should be identified as being at risk and referred to assistance and support in order to prevent their exploitation or any other harm.

==== Children exploited in illegal and criminal activities ====
An important safeguard for child victims of crime is the ‘non-punishment clause’. It means that child victims of criminal offences, including human trafficking, are to be protected from sanctions or prosecution for acts that they committed in relation to their situation as victims. The non-punishment clause protects children who are exploited in illegal or criminal activities and child victims of exploitation and/or trafficking who were forced to enter a country without valid travel documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations Economic and Social Council, Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/20, 2005. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UN Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime emphasis that “children who are victims and witnesses may suffer additional hardship if mistakenly viewed as offenders when they are in fact victims and witnesses.”  The Guidelines say child victims should be protected from prosecution irrespective of any form of ‘consent’ or their active involvement in an offence and irrespective of the child’s age in relation to national laws defining the age of criminal liability. A child victim should be considered and treated as such “... regardless of their role in the offence or in the prosecution of the alleged offender or groups of offenders”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations Economic and Social Council, Guidelines on Justice in Matters involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Economic and Social Council Resolution 2005/20, 22 July 2005, par. 7e. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking and the UNICEF Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking reiterate the right to non-criminalisation specifically in relation to the situation of victims of trafficking who are to be protected from criminal liability for “any criminal offence that was a direct result from being trafficked”.  This provision is further strengthened by the non-punishment clause of the 2011 EU Anti-trafficking Directive and the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, and is therefore made binding upon States Parties: “Each Party shall, in accordance with the basic principles of its legal system, provide for the possibility of not imposing penalties on victims for their involvement in unlawful activities, to the extent that they have been compelled to do so.” (Article 26).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, United Nations Children’s Fund, Justice in Matters Involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Child-Friendly Version, 2009. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, United Nations Children’s Fund, Justice in Matters Involving Child Victims and Witnesses of Crime, Model Law and Related Commentary, 2009. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a non-national child is in conflict with the law and there are no indications that the child has been exploited in illegal activities or has otherwise been victimized, the same standards of juvenile justice applies to national children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations Economic and Social Council, Recommended Principles and Guidelines on Human Rights and Human Trafficking, Report of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights to the Economic and Social Council, E/2002/68/Add.1, 20 May 2002. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=United Nations Children’s Fund, Guidelines on the Protection of Child Victims of Trafficking, UNICEF Technical Notes, 2006. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=European Council of Refugees and Exiles, Right to Justice: Quality Legal Assistance for Unaccompanied Children, Annex 1: Guiding principles for quality legal assistance for unaccompanied children, 2014. | accessdate=8 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right to consular assistance===
Children who are outside of their country of residence have a right to assistance by embassies and consular offices representing their country. Consular staff can play an important role in supporting and assisting children abroad, establishing supportive contacts and referral, and mobilizing help. Consular staff may contact central authorities or national contact points for technical advice in cases involving children. Under the 1963 [[Vienna Convention on Consular Relations]] of the United Nations, consular functions include helping and assisting nationals of the sending state. This could involve measures to safeguard the interests of children who are nationals of the sending State within the limits imposed by the laws and regulations of the receiving State, particularly when a guardian needs to be appointed.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention on Consular Relations Article 5e and h&lt;/ref&gt; The authorities of the country of destination must inform the competent consular office without delay when the appointment of a guardian for a child is considered. The laws and regulations of the receiving State concerning the appointment of a guardian apply and are not affected by the information sharing with the relevant consular offices.&lt;ref&gt;Vienna Convention on Consular Relations Article 37b&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Migration and mobility within the European Union ===
All individuals, including parents, families with children and [[Unaccompanied minor|unaccompanied children]], enjoy freedom of movement within the European area. In the European area of freedom of movement, citizens of EU Member States and the EFTA States Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland are entitled to enter and reside in other EU Member States for a period of up to three months without registration and are granted a permit to stay when they can demonstrate an income. The rights of children as unaccompanied migrants in the European area of freedom of movement are not explicitly defined and the related institutional responsibilities remain unclear. The way that national governments interpret and regulate the rules of freedom of movement for unaccompanied children under 18 years of age differs among the countries.&lt;ref&gt;European Parliament and Council Directive 2004/38/EC of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asylum  ===
The UN [[Refugee convention|UN Refugee Convention]] and its Protocol regulate the right of persons to seek international protection. Children enjoy special safeguards and have a right to have their asylum application examined individually. Child-specific grounds of persecution need to be considered irrespective of whether the child applies alone or together with a parent or caregiver. The European Union Member States have re-elaborated these standards for the EU context and have adopted [[List of international and European law on child protection and migration|a series of Directives]] regulating the qualification and reception conditions of asylum seekers in the EU as well as asylum procedures and matters of return.

==Vulnerability==
Children on the move are routinely referred to as ‘vulnerable’ although the meaning of the term has not been defined or clarified for the child protection context. Vulnerability is often understood as a deficit and equated with weakness and a need of protection. From a child rights-based approach, vulnerability refers to the limited chances of a child to fully exercise her or his rights as afforded under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.&lt;ref name="CARDET 2013"&gt;CARDET, Defence for Children International – Italy et al., IMPACT, Improving Monitoring and Protection Systems Against Child Trafficking and Exploitation, Transnational Analysis, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Refugees 2007"&gt;United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Conclusion on Children at Risk, Executive Committee Conclusions, No. 107(LVIII), 5 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Existing definitions of vulnerability that are in use in the context of poverty reduction, health and nutrition can be useful in the child protection context.

== Safe migration ==
Some children migrate well-protected and cared for and some succeed to achieve the goals that motivated their journeys. When migration is safe and successful, children have opportunities to increase their well-being, to access higher-quality services and to benefit from better education. Safe migration opportunities can support children significantly in their transition into adulthood and an independent life. They will have improved life chances, including in their transition into adulthood and the labor market, with better working conditions, higher salaries and an increased potential to contribute proactively to their communities and societies, in countries of origin and destination. Children and young adults might support their families through remittances and support the development of their communities of origin.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Relief Services, Child Migration, The Detention and repatriation of unaccompanied Central American children from Mexico, Research Study, 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Inter-Agency Group on Children on the Move, Why Children Matter, Experiences and lessons learnt from interventions to protect children on the move, The High Level Dialogue on International Migration and Development 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Side Event to the 46th Session of the Commission on Population and Development: “New Trends in Migration: Demographic Aspects”, 24 April 2013, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, United Nations Children’s Fund, Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean, Children and International Migration in Latin America and the Caribbean, Challenges, Newsletter on progress towards the Millennium Development Goals from a child rights perspective, Number 11, 2010, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks for children in migration ==
For children who migrate to escape difficult living situations, violence or conflict, migration can constitute an opportunity to reduce risks. Others encounter more severe risks during migration or at the place of destination. Some groups of children are vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, including trafficking, because of weak social safety nets. The risks a child is exposed to are often closely intertwined and are considered cumulative. A child who is already living in a vulnerable situation, such as poverty, abuse or school-drop out, is considered even more vulnerable when additional risks come in, such as exploitative relationships or risky migration.&lt;ref name="CARDET 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Refugees 2007"/&gt;

Many child migrants are exposed to harm during the journey and at destination. Children face violence, exploitation and abuse at the hands of people they encounter in transit and at destination, including employers, transporters, smugglers and traffickers. They might experience significant levels of indifference or abuse by state officials, including police, border guards, immigration officials and staff in reception or detention facilities. Some migrants die on the journey from dehydration, malnourishment, suffocation or transportation accidents or drown at sea.&lt;ref&gt;Catholic Relief Services, Child Migration, The Detention and repatriation of unaccompanied Central American children from Mexico, Research Study, 2010, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unsafe migration conditions, by their nature, create risks for children. In addition to experiencing acts of violence, children risk to come into conflict with the law if they travel without the required documents, if they engage in illegal or criminal activities to make a living, or if they are persuaded or forced by others to do so. In situations of habitual mobility or circular migration, such conditions can influence the well-being, safety and development significantly of the child.&lt;ref name="CARDET 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Refugees 2007"/&gt;

===Exploitation===
Children on the move are at risk of different forms of exploitation. They include [[sexual exploitation]] in [[prostitution]] and [[pornography]], traveling sex offenders through web-cams, child abuse images and illegal content on the internet. Exploitation takes place in [[child labour]] and domestic work, as au-pairs, in factories, construction, asphalt laying, restaurants and cleaning industries, agriculture and berry picking and in begging. There are also transnational cases of early and [[forced marriage]] of children. The exploitation of children could be organised by families, small groups or large-scale criminal networks. Children are exploited also in illegal and criminal activities, including in drug production and drug trafficking, pick-pocketing or burglary.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund Innocenti Research Centre, Child Trafficking in Europe, A broad vision to put children first, Innocenti Insight, 2008, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund Innocenti Research Centre, Child Trafficking in the Nordic Countries, Rethinking strategies and national responses, A Technical Report, 2012, pp. 18-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Child trafficking|Child victims of trafficking]] are also increasingly used by traffickers for purposes such as begging, benefit fraud, identity fraud, credit fraud and insurance fraud.&lt;ref&gt;Europol, The THB Financial Business Model, Assessing the current state of knowledge, 2015, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trafficking===
[[Child trafficking]] is defined in the [[Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and Children|UN Trafficking Protocol of 2000]] as the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of a child for the purpose of exploitation. While this definition applies only to transnational cases and/or cases involving organized criminal groups, child trafficking is now typically recognized well outside these parameters.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=I.L.O, UNICEF, and UN.GIFT|title=Training Manual to Fight Child Trafficking in Children for Labour, Sexual and Other Forms of Exploitation – Textbook 1: Understanding Child Trafficking|year=2009|url=http://www.unicef.org/protection/Textbook_1.pdf|accessdate=February 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The International Labour Organization expands definition to include movement and exploitation as key aspects of child trafficking.&lt;ref name="TngManualFightTrafficking-Textbk1"/&gt;

Victims of transnational trafficking might cross borders with or without legal travel documents and with or without the assistance of smugglers. Persons are often recruited into trafficking only after they have crossed an international border. In many cases, trafficking takes place within countries and there are no border crossings involved. The UN Trafficking Protocol of 2000 considers the means of trafficking and the consent of the child to any of the trafficking acts as irrelevant in the identification of a trafficking victim. Forms of exploitation that could constitute trafficking include, “at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs”.&lt;ref&gt;UN Trafficking Protocol, Article 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Child trafficking can be prosecuted when it is possible to prove the intent to exploit the child, even when exploitation has not yet taken place. Varying interpretations sometimes make it difficult to distinguish child trafficking from other types of exploitation.

====Definitions of child trafficking in Europe====
The Council of Europe Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings (2005) adopted the international definition, identical in wording, underlining however that victims shall be protected also in cases where trafficking takes place within countries and without the involvement of large-scale organised crime groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/fr/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/197&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU Anti-Trafficking Directive (2011) broadened the notion of exploitation in the trafficking concept. It explicitly includes the purpose of exploitation in criminal activities as part of the definition of human trafficking. Article 2.3 clarifies that the “‘exploitation of criminal activities’ should be understood as the exploitation of a person to commit, inter alia, pick-pocketing, shop-lifting, drug trafficking and other similar activities which are subject to penalties and imply financial gain”. The Directive states that “the exploitation of begging, including the use of a trafficked dependent person for begging, falls within the scope of the definition of trafficking in human beings only when all the elements of forced labour or services occur”.&lt;ref&gt;The European Parliament and Council of the European Union, Directive 2011/36/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2011 on preventing and combating trafficking in human beings and protecting its victims, and replacing Council Framework Decision 2002/629/JHA, Official Journal of the European Union, Brussels, 15 April 2011, par. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Smuggling===
The United Nations [[Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air|Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air]] defines human smuggling as the “procurement, in order to obtain, directly or indirectly, a financial or other material benefit of the illegal entry of a person into a State Party of which the person is not a national or a permanent resident”.  A smuggler facilitates the border crossing of others without the required travel documents and for financial or other gain. Once a smuggler has facilitated the border crossing or ensured the migrant’s arrival at the agreed destination, the contact between the smuggler and the smuggled migrants usually ceases. The smuggling of persons across international borders can be part of the act of trafficking when it is done for the purpose of exploiting the persons in the country of destination.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CTOC/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Protocol Against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air, Supplementing the United Nations Convention Against Transnational Organised Crime, Article 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although smuggling is considered a crime against the state, persons who are using the services of smugglers might be victimised by acts of violence while being smuggled or they might die due to unsafe transportation conditions.

===Sale of children===
The sale of children means any act or transaction whereby a child is transferred by any person or group of persons to another for remuneration or any other consideration. While trafficking could involve the purchase and sale of persons, the sale of children may lead to exploitation but does not necessarily have to. Children are sometimes sold in illegal adoptions, for instance. Children are also sold for sexual exploitation or labour. In these cases, there may be an overlap between trafficking and sale as two criminal acts within a single case.&lt;ref&gt;Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the sale of children, child prostitution and child pornography, Article 2(a).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Migration and sustainable development ==
The link between migration and development have been widely recognised. Migration is directly relevant to the [[2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. According to current demographic trends, the populations in richer countries will continue to age disproportionately while the younger generations are overrepresented in lower income countries, causing strain on the labour market, social security, education and nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform, Transforming Our World – The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration can mitigate these population imbalances on both ends. It has a potential to increase the work force and strengthen the younger generations in numbers where needed. This would mean increased contributions to the social welfare systems in higher income countries of destination and a reduced strain on the social welfare systems in countries of origin with high poverty and unemployment rates. Migration and mobility policies should ideally facilitate a mutual exchange of knowledge, capacity and human resources while preventing one directional movements and brain drain. Seen from this point of view, migration holds potential benefits for poverty reduction and for fostering more equitable and sustainable global development.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Children’s Fund, United Nations Population Division, University of Houston, International Migration, Children and Adolescents, Population Dynamics, October 2013, pp. 1, 4.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cortina, Jeronimo 2013, p. 2"&gt;Cortina, Jeronimo, Children, Education and Migration: Win-win policy responses for co-development, QScience Proceedings, Family, Migration and Dignity Special Issue, University of Houston and United Nations Children’s Fund, Bloomsbury Qatar Foundation Journals, 2013, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  The linkages between migration and development have implications for policy and practice in these areas and relevant measures need to be coordinated in countries of destination and origin.

From a human rights-based and development oriented perspective, countries of origin and destination share the responsibility for managing migration. Maximising the good developments and minimising the risks from migration could include developing the human capital of migrants and investing in migration management cooperation between countries of origin and destination in social, economic and political terms.&lt;ref name="Cortina, Jeronimo 2013, p. 2"/&gt;

==History of child migration by country==

=== Australia ===
During the  late 19th and early 20th centuries, many [[Aboriginal Australian]] children were removed from their families and placed in institutions and foster homes, in what became known as the [[Stolen Generations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Read | first = Peter | title = The Stolen Generations: The Removal of Aboriginal children in New South Wales 1883 to 1969 | publisher = Department of Aboriginal Affairs (New South Wales government) | year = 1981 | url = http://www.daa.nsw.gov.au/publications/StolenGenerations.pdf | isbn = 0-646-46221-0 | format = PDF | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120409231929/http://www.daa.nsw.gov.au/publications/StolenGenerations.pdf | archivedate = 2012-04-09 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

130,000 children were migrated to Australia under assisted [[Home Children|child migration schemes]] from Great Britain alone, with a small number from Malta. Child migrants were adopted or brought up in children's homes, institutions, orphanages or foster care. A large portion of these children were used in slave labour by the churches in Australia. Many of these children experienced [[Child neglect|neglect]] and [[Child abuse|abuse]] while in institutional care.

In November 2009 [[Australian Prime Minister]], [[Kevin Rudd]] formally apologized to "[[Forgotten Australians]]" and child migrants on behalf of the nation.&lt;ref name="sorry" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pm.gov.au/node/6321 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405065659/http://www.pm.gov.au/node/6321 |archivedate=2010-04-05 |df= }} PMs apology&lt;/ref&gt; "Forgotten Australians" is a term the Australian Senate has used to describe children who were brought up in orphanages, children's homes, institutions or foster care in Australia. Child migrants are a specific group of "Forgotten Australians".&lt;ref&gt;http://guides.slv.vic.gov.au/content.php?pid=55757&amp;sid=582660 Adoption &amp; Forgotten Australians - Child Migrants&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
Child migration was a phenomenon associated with the migration of Bulgarian market-gardeners to Austria-Hungary in the second half of 19th and early 20th Century, due to the use of child labor (mostly boys) in market-gardening. Child labor brought master gardeners the biggest profit since children did not get paid but worked as apprentices for their keep only. Younger children helped in the gardens and learned gardening skills, while those who were already physically strong performed specialized gardening activities. Different patterns of child migration can be distinguished based on the autobiographies and personal life stories of market-gardeners: children who migrated with their market-gardening parents as a family or those of market-gardeners who were born abroad; children who migrated with one of the parents (usually the market-gardening father) or with relatives of the market-gardening father so as to “learn the craft”; children who migrated with their market-gardening parents as a family, then the parents returned to their homeland with the younger children, while the older child was left abroad to work “on a garden” and make his own living, thus supporting his family financially.&lt;ref&gt;http://penkapeykovska.blogspot.hu/p/blog-page_20.html Peykovska, Penka, Child Migration, Child Labor and School Attainment.

=== Canada ===
{{main|Canadian Indian residential school system}}
The Canadian Indian residential school system, founded in the 19th century, was intended to force the assimilation of the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada]] into European-Canadian society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alberni School Victim Speaks Out |url=http://www.firstnationsdrum.com/education/Default.htm |work=First Nations Drum |accessdate=2009-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726170335/http://www.firstnationsdrum.com/education/Default.htm |archivedate=July 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last residential school was closed in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/05/16/f-timeline-residential-schools.html|title=A timeline of residential schools|publisher=CBC|date=2008-05-16|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 11, 2008, [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] apologized, on behalf of the sitting [[Cabinet of Canada|Cabinet]], in front of an audience of Aboriginal delegates, and in an address that was broadcast nationally on the [[CBC Television|CBC]], for the past governments' policies of assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2008/06/11/aboriginal-apology.html PM cites 'sad chapter' in apology for residential schools] - cbc.ca, June 11, 2008. Retrieved 2009-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2009, [[Pope Benedict XVI]] expressed his sorrow at "the anguish caused by the deplorable conduct of some members of the Church" and offered his "sympathy and prayerful solidarity".&lt;ref&gt;[http://212.77.1.245/news_services/bulletin/news/23774.php?index=23774&amp;lang=en Communique of the Holy See Press Office]. 29.4.2009. Retrieved 2009-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malta ===
310 children were emigrated from Malta to Australia between 1950 and 1965 under the ‘Child Migration to Australia Scheme’ following an agreement between the Australian Catholic Immigration committee and the Emigration and Labour Minister on 9 December 1949.&lt;ref name="apology"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.com.mt/news.asp?newsitemid=97331|title=Australian PM apologises for child abuse|last=Attard|first=Elaine|work=The Malta Independent online|publisher=Standard Publications Ltd|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the Maltese children sent to Australia under this scheme came either from government orphanages or Church children’s homes and all were said to have left with their parents’ consent. The Australian government had offered to welcome Maltese boys, aged between eight and 11, and girls aged between five and 10 years into Catholic institutions and promised to offer them employment supervised by the responsible Catholic authorities.&lt;ref name="apology" /&gt; One of these children became a priest and many others embarked on a career though many grew up hurt knowing that their parents had consented to their departure from home.&lt;ref name="apology" /&gt; The Maltese emigrants were included in the Australian Prime Minister's 2009 public apology to those who suffered abuse at the hands of their carers in institutions, orphanages and foster care.&lt;ref name="apology" /&gt;

===Mandatory Palestine===
During World War II, thousands of [[unaccompanied minor]]s from Jewish families in Nazi-occupied Europe were [[Youth Aliyah|transported to relative safety in Mandatory Palestine]] (now Israel).

=== United Kingdom ===
{{Main|Home Children}}
The practice of sending poor or [[orphan]]ed children to the [[English overseas possessions|English]] [[settler colony|settler colonies]], to help alleviate the shortage of labour, began in [[Kingdom of England|England]] in 1618, with the rounding-up and transportation of 100 [[vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] children to the [[Virginia Colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldonian.org/barnardo/child_migrationl.htm|title=A child migration timeline|work=The Goldonian|publisher=Goldonian Web|accessdate=2009-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the second half of the twentieth century, the Home Children programme was seen as a way to move impoverished children to a "better life" in Australia, Canada and elsewhere, also providing good "white stock" to former colonies.  The children and parents were not consulted, and often siblings were separated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Child Labor]] By Sandy Hobbs, Jim McKechnie, [[Michael Lavalette]] p. 33, 34&lt;/ref&gt; In total 130,000 children were sent from the United Kingdom to Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and Australia.  Often children were lied to about their parents being dead and many faced abuse in their new homes.&lt;ref name="sorry"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/8361389.stm|title=Australia 'sorry' for child abuse|last=Anon|date=16 November 2009|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010 [[British Prime Minister]], [[Gordon Brown]] issued an official apology for the 'shameful' child resettlement programme and announced a £6 million fund designed to compensate the families affected by the "misguided" programme.&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article7039505.ece|title=Gordon Brown sorry for 'shameful' colonial child resettlement programme|last=Ralph|first=Alex|date=24 February 2010|work=The Times|publisher=Times Newspapers Ltd|accessdate=26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Child Migrants Trust has since set up the Family Restoration Fund in order to use this money to help reunite former child migrants with their families as part of the British government's package of support to former child migrants and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childmigrantstrust.com/services/family-restoration-fund|title=Family Restoration Fund|last=Anon|work=Child migrants Trust|publisher=Child Migrants Trust|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]], some 3.5 million children were evacuated from areas at risk of aerial bombing to rural locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evacuees.org.uk/|title=Home page|last=Anon|work=The Evacuees Reunion Association.|publisher=The Evacuees Reunion Association.|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Evacuations of civilians in Britain during World War II]].)

Also during World War II, nearly 10,000 [[unaccompanied minor]]s from Jewish families in Nazi-occupied Europe were [[Kindertransport|transported to safety in the UK]].

A study completed in 2012 by the [[University of Oxford]]'s Centre on Migration, Policy and Society (COMPAS) led by Dr Nando Sigona has shed light on the situation of children with no right to live in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;http://irregularvoices.wordpress.com/2012/05/15/no-way-out-no-way-in-migrant-children-fall-through-the-net/&lt;/ref&gt; The study, 'No way out, no way in: Irregular migrant children and families in the UK', estimates a population of 120,000 children without status, of whom 65,000 were born in the UK to parents with no right to live in the country.

=== United States ===
During the 19th century there were a number of attempts to move children from crowded east coast cities to midwestern and western rural families &amp; orphanages. Most famous was the [[orphan train]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first = John | last =Torigoe |date=24 December 2008| title =He rode the 'Orphan Train' across the country| journal =CNN | url =http://www.cnn.com/2008/LIVING/wayoflife/12/24/orphan.trains/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally Native American children were separated from their families &amp; sent to [[Americanization (of Native Americans)#Native American education and boarding schools|boarding schools]] to force them into assimilating western culture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/amnestynow/soulwound.html  Andrea Smith, "Soul Wound: The Legacy of Native American Schools"], ''Amnesty Magazine'', Amnesty International website&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Finland ===
During the Second World War, when Finland was at war with Russia, about 70 000 Finnish children were transported by train and boat mainly to Sweden, but also to Norway and Denmark. These children are commonly referred to as [[Finnish war children|war children]]. By the end of the war, thousands of children were adopted by their "new" parents.

{{Christianity and gender|positions}}

'''Christian egalitarianism''' (derived from the [[French language|French]] word '''égal''', meaning ''equal'' or ''level''), also known as '''biblical equality''', is a Christian form of [[egalitarianism]]. It holds that all human persons are created equally in God's sight—equal in fundamental worth and moral status. This view does not just apply to gender, but to religion, skin colour and any other differences between individuals. It does not imply that all have equal skills, abilities, interests, or physiological or genetic traits. Christian egalitarianism holds that all people are equal before [[God in Christianity|God]] and in [[Jesus in Christianity|Christ]]; have equal responsibility to use their gifts and obey their calling to the glory of God; and are called to roles and ministries without regard to class, gender, or race.&lt;ref&gt;Padgett, Alan G. "What Is Biblical Equality?" ''Priscilla Papers'', Summer 2002: 16:3 Padgett is professor of Systematic Theology at Luther Seminary, St. Paul, MN.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender equality==
According to Christian egalitarianism, [[gender equality]] is biblically sound in Christian church leadership (including [[pastor]]s) and in Christian marriage. Its theological foundations are interpretations of the teachings and example of [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus Christ]] and other [[New Testament]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;The Blue Parakeet: Rethinking How You Read the Bible  Scot McKnight - 2008 "The former is often called "complementarian" and the latter "egalitarian," though simple labels mask both the seriousness of the views as well as nuances within and between such views. The term "complementarian" fudges the reality; ... "&lt;/ref&gt;

It refers to a biblically-based belief that gender, in and of itself, neither privileges nor curtails a believer's gifting or calling to any ministry in the church or home. It does not imply that [[women]] and [[men]] are identical or undifferentiated, but affirms that God designed men and women to complement and benefit one another.&lt;ref&gt;Groothuis, Rebecca Merrill. "The Bible and Gender Equality." [http://www.cbeinternational.org Christians for Biblical Equality Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Linda Belleville"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Linda Belleville|authorlink1=Women in Ministry: an egalitarian perspective|editor1-last=Beck|editor1-first=James R.|title=Two views on women in ministry|date=2009|isbn=0-310-86451-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=pXcMvBsrMLgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=biblical+views+of+women#v=onepage&amp;q=biblical%20views%20of%20women&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Egalitarian beliefs are generally subscribed to by [[Quaker]]s, [[The United Methodist Church|United Methodist Churches]], The Presbyterian Church (USA), The Covenant Order of Evangelical Presbyterians (ECO), [[American Baptist Churches USA|Northern Baptists]], [[Church of the Nazarene]], [[Wesleyan Church]], [[Evangelical Covenant Church|The Evangelical Covenant Church]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.covchurch.org/wc/2011/07/what-do-you-think/|title="What do you think?" - Worship Connect|date=2011-07-15|work=Worship Connect|access-date=2017-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some Pentecostal churches such as the [[Assemblies of God]] and [[United Church of God]].

The opposing view is [[complementarianism]], a view which holds that differing, often non-overlapping roles between men and women, manifested in marriage, church leadership, and elsewhere, are biblically required. Complementarianism is the belief that men were created for the headship role and women were created for the support role.

== Biblical foundations ==

All three Synoptic Gospels record Jesus as saying:
{{Quotation|You know that the rulers of the Gentiles ''lord it over'' them, and their high officials ''exercise authority'' over them. But it shall not be so among you".{{bibleref2c|Matthew|20:25–26||Mt 20:25–26a}} {{bibleref2c|Mk|10:42}} {{bibleref2c|Lk|22:25}}}} According to Clive Marsh and Steve Moyise, while "lord it over" implies abusive leadership, Jesus' words "exercise authority" have no connotation of abuse of authority.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Clive, Steve Moyise. ''Jesus and the Gospels.'' Continuum International Publishing Group, 2006. {{ISBN|0-567-04073-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Apostle Paul]] wrote:

{{quotation|There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.|{{Bibleref2|Galatians|3:28}}}}

Christian egalitarians' interpretation of scriptures and spiritual convictions bring them to the conclusion that the manner and teaching of Jesus ''abolished'' [[discrimination]] against racial minorities, slaves, and women in both the church and marriage. They believe that the Bible teaches the fundamental equality of believers of all racial and ethnic groups and all economic classes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiritrestoration.org/Church/ministry-profile-christians-for-biblical-equality.htm Christians for Biblical Equality&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary inline|date=October 2015}}{{Self-published inline|date=October 2015}} They consider overarching principles of the [[Bible]] to be that [[Gender equality|men and women are equally created]] in God's image, equally responsible for sin, equally redeemed by Christ, and equally gifted by God's Spirit for service and held responsible for using their God-given gifts.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, B. (2011) ''Let My People Go: A Call to End the Oppression of Women in the Church.'' Charleston, SC: Createspace. {{ISBN|978-1-4664-0111-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the six times [[Aquila and Priscilla|Aquila and his wife Priscilla]] are mentioned by name in the New Testament, they are listed together as a couple. Their order of appearance alternates in a perfect odd-even equality, with each mentioned first three times. Aquila appears first in the first, third and fifth mentions, and Priscilla (Prisca) first in the second, fourth and sixth mentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Acts|18:2|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:18|KJV}}, {{bibleverse-nb||Acts|18:26|KJV}}, {{bibleverse||Romans|16:3|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|1|Corinthians|16:19|KJV}}, {{bibleverse|2|Timothy|4:19|KJV}} Authorized Version&lt;/ref&gt; Some revisions of the Bible put Priscilla rather than Aquila first, in Acts 18:26, following the Vulgate and a few Greek texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://studybible.info/compare/Acts%2018:26 Acts 18:26 multi-version]&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars suggest that Priscilla was the head of the family unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Achtenmeier |first=P.J. |title=HarperCollins Bible Dictionary |publisher=HarperCollins |edition=revised |year=1996 |page=882 |isbn=0-06-060037-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Christian egalitarianism holds that all people are equal in fundamental worth and moral status. A significant source of this trend of thought is the Christian notion that humankind were created in the living [[image of God]] ''(Imago Dei)''.

Jesus Christ did not conform to a mentality unfavorable to women, but reacted against inequalities based on sexual differences.&lt;ref&gt;Stagg, Evelyn and Frank. ''Woman in the World of Jesus.'' Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

Illustrative of efforts to institutionalize this notion are these excerpts from the organizational ''Statement of Faith'' of [[Christians for Biblical Equality]], a major Christian Egalitarian organization:

==History==
The first organization whose purpose was advocating Christian egalitarianism was "Men, Women and God", established in the United Kingdom in 1984. The American organization [[Christians for Biblical Equality]] was established by [[evangelicals]] in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CBE's History|url=http://www.cbeinternational.org/content/cbes-history|website=CBE International|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Egalitarian anthropologies ==
Titled in accordance with [[Rosemary Radford Ruether]]'s work in Christian theology, Egalitarian anthropologies explore varying views of gender equality in Christianity. These include [[Eschatology|eschatological]] feminism, [[liberal feminism]], and romantic feminism. According to Ruether, the commonality among these anthropologies is the belief that gender equality was the original intention of God and that it was somehow skewed by humanity. Ruether goes on to point out that the belief in the ideal of gender equality "leaves room for considerable variation in relating this equality to woman's present subjugated state in history under patriarchy."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexism and God-Talk|last=Ruether|first=Rosemary Radford|publisher=Beacon Press|year=1986|isbn=0-8070-1205-X|location=Boston, MA|pages=99–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the preceding statement, Ruether qualifies the need for further exploration into the following anthropologies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Eschatological feminism ===
Ruether connects eschatological feminism to [[mysticism]] and [[asceticism]] by way of its roots in [[transcendentalism]]. Her assertion is that the original human, Adam, was androgynous and that "[[Fall of man|the fall]]" was the initial creation of gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruether|first=Rose Radford|date=2014|title=Sexism and Misogyny in the Christian Tradition: Liberating Alternatives|url=|journal=Buddhist-Christian Studies|volume=34|pages=83–94|via=|doi=10.1353/bcs.2014.0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reaffirms this point in a later article, "Sexism and Misogyny in the Christian Tradition: Liberating Alternatives", referencing Galatians 3:28,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians+3:28&amp;version=NIV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Galatians 3:28 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; saying that through baptism androgyny is restored.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Sexuality, the main division between genders, is said to be the root of female subordination. Relationships that are typically rooted in sexuality (marriage and motherhood) place women in roles that are subordinate in accordance with society's patriarchal norms. The path to equality is believed to be found when women transcend these roles- traditionally through celibacy (as seen in the life of Paul&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians%207|title=Bible Gateway passage: 1 Corinthians 7 - New International Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Transcending worldly norms, which the Bible instructs Christians to do,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+12:2&amp;version=ESV|title=Bible Gateway passage: Romans 12:2 - English Standard Version|website=Bible Gateway|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; brings men and women to the state of androgyny that eliminates gender subordination; thus, Christianity is intended to manifest gender equality. Ruether says that transcendence is the core of eschatological feminism; women reach equality with men by separating from the world, rather than changing it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Liberal feminism ===
Liberal feminism rejects the notion that creation established the patriarchy; Ruether asserts that gender equality originally existed, but was distorted by historical injustices against women. This branch of egalitarianism dictates that gender equality must be restored rather than introduced. This restoration will be accomplished by economic, political, social, and systemic reformation. Ruether includes the church in her discussion of social reform, displaying its participation in gender subordination. Ruether continues saying, "The Church as a bearer of redeemed humanity ought especially to represent this equality of men and women in its institutional life. But it does so as a paradigm of what all social institutions should become, not as a representative of an eschatological humanity outside of and beyond history."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Here she distinguishes liberal from eschatological feminism stating that liberal feminism calls for liberation within society, rather than removal from it.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Romantic feminism ===
Ruether states that in romantic feminism the distinction between genders is found primarily in "spiritual" traits. Ruether references a sixteenth century humanist, Cornelius Agrippa, saying that women have an "affinity with divine Wisdom that gives them  moral and spiritual superiority."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Montanist Oracles and Testimonia|last=Heine|first=Ronald E.|publisher=Mercer University Press|year=1989|isbn=|location=Macon, GA|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are perceived to be innately altruistic, sensitive, and pure- traits that are considered morally superior compared to "male traits." Ruether continues saying that men and women are both inherently capable of goodness, but because of the patriarchy placing men into positions of power, more negative character traits are manifested (pride, aggression, dominance, etc.). Since women are not allowed into positions of power, Ruether supposes that they retain humanity's natural goodness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Romantic feminism contains varying ideologies in itself which are as follows.

==== Conservative romanticism ====
According to Ruether, conservative romanticism suggests that women remain in the home in order to maintain their goodness. Ruether says, "If a woman leaves the home to take up a traditional male occupation, she will straightaway lose this good femininity and become a she-male, a monstrous virago, or will become debased to carnal femaleness, fallen woman." In one survey conducted in 1999 a researcher concluded based on participants' responses, "Even though husbands were not always the sole providers, for the majority of men they remained symbolically so, such that women's employment was nearly  always described as secondary, even expendable, in light of wives' responsibility to rear and nurture children."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gallagher|first=Sally K.|last2=Smith|first2=Christian|date=1999|title=Symbolic Traditionalism and Pragmatic Egalitarianism: Contemporary Evangelicals, Families, and Gender|jstor=190389|journal=Gender and Society|volume=13|issue=2|pages=211–233|doi=10.2307/190389}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservative romanticism opposes gender equality in the work force in order to better preserve traditional roles in the home. Women's innate goodness makes her the ideal candidate to raise children and to support the husband. In turn, this spousal support allows the husband to perform better in the workforce; this trickle effect of women sending good husbands and sons into the world is how conservative romantics suppose women make an impact.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Reformist romanticism ====
Reformist romanticism aligns with conservative romanticism except in the reformist belief that the inherent goodness of women cannot be lost by equality in society. Ruether says that this ideology prescribes women to morally reform men and male-centric institutions, but to do so they require education, voting rights, and political power. Reformist romanticism believes that the innate goodness of women is needed in leadership positions to improve the nature of the world. It is also believed that the nature of women is incompatible with war and that under female leadership, the world would be at peace.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Radical romanticism ====
Radical feminism rejects the entirety of male culture and debates whether males can be redeemed at all. Ruether says that radical feminists desire a utopian society completely independent from males in which women's inherent goodness is unimpeded by male inferiority.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Catholic views on egalitarianism==
The [[Roman Catholic Church]] has formally opposed ''[[radical egalitarianism]]'' and has stated that the differences between men and women are not merely phenomenal, but are in fact ontological in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcatholicreporter.org/update/bn073104.htm National Catholic Reporter]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2004 ''Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on the Collaboration of Men and Women in the Church and in the World'', Cardinal [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]] warned against a related tendency to see gender as culturally constructed, which has generated "a new model of polymorphous sexuality", which reflects an "attempt to be free from one’s biological conditioning".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vis.pcn.net/doc/040731x_en.htm VIS]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collaborative language systems''' is a therapeutic approach largely based in contemporary [[hermeneutics]], the study of interpretation as a way to produce understanding, while considering both context and cognition, as well as [[social constructionism]]. This approach involves a reciprocal relationship between both the therapist and client, through which the client works through his or her clinical problems using [[dialogical conversation]] with the therapist. The therapist and client work together, utilizing their own, individual knowledge and understanding of the issues, to conceptualize and illuminate the client’s problems and provide new context, meaning and comprehension to those problems based on the collaboration.

== Early sources ==

The theoretical approach known as collaborative language systems evolved from the traditional basis of collaborative therapy. Together, Harlene Anderson and Harry Goolishian took the core values incorporated into practiced therapeutic techniques involving reciprocal approaches toward the client-patient relationship and applied a cooperative understanding of the use of modern language and the role it plays in the formulation of ideas and perception, as well as [[Carl Rogers|Rogerian]] theory towards the therapeutic relationship. Goolishian and Anderson were later joined by Lynn Hoffman in expanding the application of their ideas. The approach corrected by the collective contributors was eventually expounded upon by Tom Andersen, who thrust the theories into a broader range of practice within the field [[family therapy|family systems therapy]].&lt;ref name="Family Therapy Review"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coombs|first=Robert|title=Family Therapy Review|year=2005|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|isbn=0-8058-4312-4|pages=148–149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creating collaborative therapy ==

Collaborative therapy emerged as a [[postmodernist]] concept rooted in philosophical principles as a way to challenge existing [[psychotherapeutic]] approaches. The basic foundations upon which collaborative language systems are based involve the formation of our understanding of events and situations based on the words used to describe them. Through narration and dialogue, it is theorized, we give meaning to situations. This meaning changes given the context of the conversation and how we choose to describe it. Collaborative therapists believe that knowledge and language, and thus the meaning each is given, are interdependent, dynamic processes that change through the exchange of information and ideas.&lt;ref name="The New Language of Change"&gt;{{cite book|last=Anderson|first=Harlene|chapter=On a roller coaster: A collaborative language systems approach to therapy |editor-first=Steven |editor-last=Friedman |title=The New Language of Change: Constructive Collaboration In Psychotherapy|year=1993|publisher=The Guilford Press|location=New York, New York|isbn=0-89862-145-3|pages=323–326}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Therapist–client relationship ==

Unlike traditional psychotherapy, the collaborative [[therapist]] plays a more active role in the therapist/patient relationship. As narration is essential to this form of therapy, the therapist constantly invites and facilitates the dialogue in order to sustain a constant exchange of ideas and experience. The therapist’s goal is to gain an understanding of the client’s problems through their narration by attempting to comprehend meaning from the perspective of the client. This process serves as a co-learning experience during which the therapist pays close attention to both what and how things are being said. Any comments or suggestions made by the therapist are used simply as a basis for continued conversation rather than an attempt at guidance or persuasion. The role of a collaborative therapist is to provide a context in which the client can begin to author, edit, and re-edit their own lives through the development and exchange of language. Despite the implicit implications regarding influence during this mutual exchange,&lt;ref name="Collaborative Influence"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strong|first=Tom|title=Collaborative Influence|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Family Therapy|year=2000|volume=21|issue=3|pages=144–145|url=http://www.anzjft.com/pages/articles/140.pdf|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the process most closely resembles the ethical practice of re-framing rather than coaching. The collaborative therapist believes that the open exchange of ideas and continuous dialogue will create opportunities for growth and transformation within the client.

== Application of Ideas ==

Collaborative language systems holds to certain core concepts during the conversational practice of therapy. Those concepts are:

* Conversational Partners
* Client Expertise
* "Not Knowing"
* Transparency
* Uncertainty
* "Everyday Ordinary Life"
* Mutual Transformation&lt;ref name="Postmodern Collaborative and Person-Centered Therapies"&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson|first=Harlene|title=Postmodern Collaborative and Person-Centered Therapies|url=http://www.harleneanderson.org/Pages/rogers.htm|work=Journal of Family Therapy|accessdate=8 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These philosophies attempt to ensure, while working in tandem, the relationship between client and therapist grows in a mutually inclusive way, expounding upon the knowledge and understanding of situations by placing both the parties on the same level, providing the client the ability to share and explore their understanding openly and freely while setting and meeting their goals for therapy based on the end points they set for themselves. In this way, collaborative therapy builds upon the [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic]] ideals with the client as the expert. It then builds upon the social constructionist view of identity through open dialogue. This theory involves the creation and understanding of problem an situations based upon the context and exchange in which they are formed. As the client and the therapist build their relationship through dialogical conversation, the context and meaning the client gives to the problems they are facing is altered as new perspectives and alternative viewpoints are offered by the therapist for consideration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3266">In the theory of [[differential form]]s, a '''differential ideal''' ''I'' is an ''algebraic ideal'' in the ring of smooth differential forms on a [[smooth manifold]], in other words a [[graded algebra|graded ideal]] in the sense of [[ring theory]], that is further closed under [[exterior differentiation]] ''d''. In other words, for any form α in ''I'', the exterior derivative ''d''α is also in ''I''.

In the theory of [[differential algebra]], a '''differential ideal''' ''I'' in a differential ring ''R'' is an ideal which is mapped to itself by each differential operator.

== Exterior differential systems and partial differential equations ==
An '''exterior differential system''' consists of a smooth manifold &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and a differential ideal

:&lt;math&gt; I\subset \Omega^*(M) &lt;/math&gt;.

An '''integral manifold''' of an exterior differential system &lt;math&gt;(M,I)&lt;/math&gt; consists of a [[submanifold]] &lt;math&gt;N\subset M&lt;/math&gt; having the property that the pullback to &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of all differential forms contained in &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; vanishes identically.

One can express any [[partial differential equation]] system as an exterior differential system with independence condition. Say that we have ''k''th order partial differential equation systems for maps &lt;math&gt; f: \mathbb{R}^m \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, given by

:&lt;math&gt; F^r(x, u, \frac{\partial^{|I|}u }{\partial x^I})=0, \quad 1\le |I|\le k &lt;/math&gt;.

The solution of this partial differential equation system is the submanifold &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt; of the [[jet (mathematics)|jet space]] consisting of integral manifolds of the pullback of the [[jet bundle|contact system]] to &lt;math&gt; \Sigma &lt;/math&gt;.

This idea allows one to analyze the properties of partial differential equations with methods of differential geometry. For instance, we can apply [[Cartan's method]] on partial differential equation systems by writing down the exterior differential system associated with it.

== Perfect differential ideals ==
A differential ideal &lt;math&gt;I \, &lt;/math&gt; is perfect if it has the property that if it contains an element &lt;math&gt; a \in I &lt;/math&gt; they contain any element &lt;math&gt; b \in I &lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; b^n = a &lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt; n &gt; 0 \, &lt;/math&gt;.

'''Dwarf-tossing''', or '''midget-tossing''', is a [[Public house|pub]]/[[Bar (establishment)|bar]] attraction in which people with [[dwarfism]], wearing special padded clothing or Velcro costumes, are thrown onto mattresses or at Velcro-coated walls.&lt;ref&gt;International Dwarf Tossing Association&lt;/ref&gt; Participants compete to throw the dwarf the farthest. A related formerly practiced activity was dwarf-bowling, in which a person with dwarfism was placed on a skateboard and used as a bowling ball.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gothamist.com/2008/02/28/dwarf_bowling_o.php Dwarf Bowling on Staten Island Lands in Gutter: Gothamist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701002832/http://gothamist.com/2008/02/28/dwarf_bowling_o.php |date=1 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dwarf Tossing was started in Australia as a form of Pub entertainment in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ozzienews.com/news/is-dwarf-tossing-coming-to-melbourne/ Dwarf Tossing Coming to Melbourne]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://twistededge.org/Funny_As_Hell/World_According/Midget_Throwing/ World according to Midget Throwing]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality==

===Australia===
Commonly thought of as the place where dwarf tossing originated. Laws may prohibit dwarf tossing implicitly, but there are not explicit laws preventing a consenting dwarf from being 'tossed'.

In [[Ontario]], Canada, the Dwarf Tossing Ban Act was introduced in 2003 by [[Windsor West]] [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]] [[Sandra Pupatello]].&lt;ref name="OntLA1"&gt;[http://www.ontla.on.ca/web/bills/bills_detail.do?locale=en&amp;BillID=1128 Dwarf Tossing Ban Act, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; This [[private member's bill|private member's public bill]] did not proceed beyond its introduction to second or third readings, nor did it receive royal assent, and therefore died at the close of the 37th [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario|Legislature]].&lt;ref name="OntLA1"/&gt; The bill proposed a fine of not more than $5,000, imprisonment of not more than six months, or both. The bill was hastily advanced in response to a dwarf-tossing contest&lt;ref name="OntLA2"&gt;[http://www.ontla.on.ca/house-proceedings/transcripts/files_html/2003-06-12_L025.htm#PARA511 Legislative Assembly of Ontario Transcript of Debates for Thursday, June 12, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; that was held at Leopard's Lounge in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], Ontario with a dwarf nicknamed "Tripod".&lt;ref name = "GlobeAndMail1"&gt;{{cite news

===France===
The [[mayor]] of the small French town of [[Morsang-sur-Orge]] prohibited dwarf-tossing. The case went through the appeal chain of administrative courts to the ''[[Council of State (France)|Conseil d'État]]'', which found that an administrative authority could legally prohibit dwarf-tossing on grounds that the activity did not respect human [[dignity]] and was thus contrary to public order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?oldAction=rechJuriAdmin&amp;idTexte=CETATEXT000007877723 Conseil d'État statuant au contentieux, n°136727, lecture du 27 octobre 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; The question raised legal questions as to what was admissible as a motive for an administrative authority to ban an activity for motives of public order, especially as the ''conseil'' did not want to include "public morality" in public order. The ruling was taken by the full assembly and not a smaller panel—proof of the difficulty of the question.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-etat.fr/fr/presentation-des-grands-arrets/27-octobre-1995-commune-de-morsang-sur-orge.html Commentary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927062531/http://www.conseil-etat.fr/fr/presentation-des-grands-arrets/27-octobre-1995-commune-de-morsang-sur-orge.html |date=27 September 2011 }} of the ruling on the Conseil d'État's site&lt;/ref&gt; The ''conseil'' ruled similarly in another case between an entertainment company and the city of [[Aix-en-Provence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?oldAction=rechJuriAdmin&amp;idTexte=CETATEXT000007882056&amp; Conseil d'État statuant au contentieux, n°143578, lecture du 27 octobre 1995]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Human Rights Committee decided on July 26, 2002, that the ban was not discriminatory with respect to dwarfs. It ruled that the ban could be considered as "necessary to protect public order, which brings into play considerations of human dignity".&lt;ref&gt;http://juris.ohchr.org/Search/Details/1010&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, dwarf-tossing is not prohibited outright in France. The ''Conseil d'État'' decided that a public authority could use gross infringement on human dignity as a motive of public order to cancel a spectacle, and that dwarf-tossing constituted such a gross infringement. However, it is up to individual authorities to make specific decisions regarding prohibition.

===United States===
Robert and Angela Van Etten, [[Florida]] members of the [[Little People of America]], convinced the state's legislators in 1989 that dwarf-tossing be made illegal. A measure banning dwarf-tossing was passed by a wide margin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2001_Dec_10/ai_80677114/ Florida Ban on Dwarf Tossing Must Be Upheld, Announces LPA, Inc.; Dwarf-Tossing is a Dangerous, Demoralizing Activity That Poses Specific Hazards to Persons with Dwarfism]&lt;/ref&gt; [[New York (state)|New York]] later followed suit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://twistededge.org/Funny_As_Hell/World_According/Midget_Throwing/ Midget Throwing: A Lost Art]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-07-25/news/mn-1001_1_dwarf-tossing |work=Los Angeles Times |title=Cuomo Signs Bill to Ban Dwarf Tossing |date=July 25, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Dave Flood, who appeared on the MJ Morning Show as "Dave the Dwarf," filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the 1989 law allowing the state to fine or revoke the [[liquor license]] of a bar that allows dwarf-tossing. The pastime was popular in some Florida bars in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=lQFQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=r1UDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1342,4094341 "Florida Radio Personality Files Suit to Allow Return of 'Dwarf Tossing'"]. ''Ludington Daily News'', December 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, [[Ritch Workman]] introduced legislation that would overturn the ban on dwarf-tossing, claiming such a ban to be an "unnecessary burden on the freedom and liberties of people" and "an example of Big Brother government". Although not a personal advocate of the activity, Workman stated "if a little person wants to make a fool out of themselves for money, they should have the same right to do so as any average sized person".&lt;ref name="PBP dwarves"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/cerabino-lawmaker-wants-state-to-reinstate-dwarf-tossing-1898183.html |work=The Palm Beach Post |first=Frank |last=Cerabino |title=Lawmaker Wants State to Reinstate Dwarf Tossing |date=2011-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1590">'''Electron equivalent''' is a concept commonly used in [[redox chemistry]], reactions involving [[electron transfer]], to define a quantity (e.g. energy or moles) relative to one electron. [[Gibbs free energy|Energies of formation]] are often given as kilojoules per electron equivalent to enable calculation of specific reaction energies on a "per electron" basis.  Reactions containing movement of electrons are often balanced such that reaction quantities are given in relation to the transfer of a single electron, allowing quantification of reactants and products in relation to a single electron transfer.

'''Fairfield Materials Management Ltd''' is a [[Manchester]] based  [[social enterprise]] that operates a community waste management project at Manchester’s New Smithfield Market focused on minimising waste, and bringing social and environmental benefits to Greater Manchester.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

By utilising '[[in-vessel composting]]', Fairfield Materials Management established the UK’s first sustainable [[biodegradable]] [[waste management]] system to operate on a wholesale market,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; diverted 16,500 tonnes of organic market waste material away from [[landfill]] between 2003 and 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/what_we_do.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairfield has developed a composting production model that processes fruit, vegetable, plant and woody waste into [[peat]]-free, [[British Standards Institution]] PAS 100&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrap.org.uk/composting/compost_
specifications/bsi_pas_100/bsi_pas_100_1.
&lt;/ref&gt; accredited compost.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.letsrecycle.com/materials/composting/news.jsp?story=5785&lt;/ref&gt; It operates on a site fully licensed by the [[Environment Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Fairfield was recognised as the most innovative social enterprise within its sector by The Composting Association.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.compostingconference.com/Community_Init_Award.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Fairfield Materials Management was founded in 2003 by a small group of ecological activists, horticulturists and social entrepreneurs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fairfield Materials Management was initiated by Val Rawlinson (Director) after she became involved in an East Manchester anti-incineration campaign in 1996. The incinerator was not built, but Lucy Danger and Val Rawlinson realised that they had to show Manchester that environmental and social alternatives were available and working successfully throughout the United Kingdom and so Fairfield Composting was established by Val who began promoting home composting and supplying compost bins.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.debdale-eco-centre.com&lt;/ref&gt; and Lucy set up EMERGE Recycling recruiting Val as a director.

Val also recognised the need for a commercial sized composting system for New Smithfield Market and choose a Vertical Composting Unit (VCU) system as the preferred technology; Emma Smith was recruited as a waste auditor in November 2001 to undertake a waste composition analysis of Smithfield Market's waste.  Chris Walsh joined the team and between 2001 and 2003 the group secured several hundred thousand pounds through grants and loans,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adventurecapitalfund.org.uk/content/view/28/59/&lt;/ref&gt; designed the site, obtaining planning permission and a waste management licence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.communitycompost.org/hotrotters/fmm.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Fairfield began operating and initially diverted waste from four market traders, taking in [[green waste]] from [[Manchester City Council]] and producing compost.  In 2004 a further two composting units were added and in 2005 a final three units were added to the system.  This enabled Fairfield to process all of the market's fruit and vegetable waste through the in-situ technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fairfieldcompost.co.uk/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst remaining a director of Fairfield Val set up Debdale Eco Centre(DEC) and with Emma's help secured funding to promote home composting.  WRAP funding later enabled DEC to run a project supplying low cost compost bins which achieved high home composting levels.  When Manchester City Council working in partnership with BIFFA introduced the Green Bin home composting levels were reduced negating the work undertaken by Val. Val retired from DEC aged 70 in 2010 but continues as a Director of Fairfield  

The business became sustainable through the efforts of Ian Trippier who was recruited as office manager bringing his vast experience of social enterprises and business acumen to the organisation. Ian and Eric Lowry, Operations Manager, have proved an invaluable partnership raising standards in Waste Management and turning Fairfield into a very successful organisation.   

In 2009 the Fairfield Group in partnership national [[renewable energy]] business Bio Group Ltd &lt;ref&gt;http://www.crainsmanchesterbusiness.co.uk/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090106/FREE/301069997/1046/energy&lt;/ref&gt; secured planning permission in [[Bredbury]], [[Stockport]] for their second waste management site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.englandsnorthwest.com/invest/news/archive/8162-food-recycle-plant-approved.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Victimization ==
{{Main|Victimisation}}
Victimization has profound psychological consequences and impacts the social development of an individual.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Macmillan|first=Ross|date=2001|title=Violence and the Life Course: The Consequences of Victimization for Personal and Social Development|url=|journal=Annual Review of Sociology|volume=27|issue=1|pages=1–22|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is considerable evidence that victimization is a precursor to involvement in crime.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; While victimization is a risk factor for both men and women's criminal behavior, it is a stronger predictor for women.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cauffman|first=Elizabeth|date=2008|title=Understanding the Female Offender|jstor=20179981|journal=The Future of Children|volume=18|issue=2|pages=119–142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both men and women may experience victimization in their lifetime, women experience and respond to victimization differently than men due to [[Gender inequality|gender inequalities]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Offender: Girls, Women, and Crime|last=Chesney-Lind|first=Meda|publisher=Sage Publication|year=1997|isbn=|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incarcerated women experience higher rates of victimization than both incarcerated men and the general female population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Opsal|first=Tara|last2=Foley|first2=Allison|date=2013|title=Making it on the Outside: Understanding Barriers to Women's Post-Incarceration Reintegration|journal=Sociology Compass|volume=7|issue=4|pages=265–277|doi=10.1111/soc4.12026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women’s imprisonment is frequently attributed to [[Addiction|drug addiction]], [[prostitution]], and retaliation to an abuser.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DeHart|first=Dana D.|date=2008|title=Pathways to Prison Impact of Victimization in the Lives of Incarcerated Women|url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/14/12/1362|journal=Violence Against Women|volume=14|issue=12|pages=1362–1381|doi=10.1177/1077801208327018|pmid=19008544}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these attributions are characterized as crimes, research has also begun to conceptualize them as survival strategies to cope with victimization.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; A young girl, for example, may run away from an abusive home and turn to prostitution as a way to make a living. Literature on victimization has often created a division between victims and offenders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Deadman|first=Derek|last2=MacDonald|first2=Ziggy|date=2004|title=Offenders as Victims of Crime?: An Investigation into the Relationship between Criminal Behaviour and Victimization|jstor=3559799|journal=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society|volume=167|issue=1|pages=53–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these two groups are not as separate as was once understood.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

It was not until the 1970s that research analyzed victimization, traumas, and past abuse as factors that can influence women to commit crimes. In the early 20th century, the personal histories of women in crime were not a focus of research. Early literature suggested women were antisocial due to their biology, environment, and socialization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[Cesare Lombroso|Lombroso]], for instance, distinguished female offenders from non-offenders based on their physical anatomies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Offender|last=Lombroso|first=Cesare|last2=Ferrero|first2=Guglielmo|last3=Morrison|first3=William Douglas|publisher=D. Appleton &amp; Company|year=1895|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These early explanatory factors were understood [[Individualistic culture|individualistically]] outside of a [[Social environment|social-historical context]].

=== Connection to criminal activity ===
There is a well-documented association between criminal behavior and victimization among female offenders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; That said, the age and gendered patterns of victimization risk, context, and consequences are highly visible and exacerbated among incarcerated women. There is evidence to support that women involved with crime often have extensive histories of physical and sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Female offenders are more likely to have been abused than male offenders&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and more likely to have been victimized than female non-offenders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A survey of national correctional populations found that over half of female inmates have been physically or sexually abused, compared to fewer than one in five male inmates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Literature suggests female offenders' victimization often begins at a young age and persists through her lifetime.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Browne|first=Angela|last2=Miller|first2=Brenda|last3=Maguin|first3=Eugene|date=1999|title=Prevalence and Severity of Lifetime Physical and Sexual Victimization Among Incarcerated Women|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160252799000114|journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry|volume=22|issue=3–4|pages=301–322|doi=10.1016/S0160-2527(99)00011-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly two thirds of incarcerated women have experienced at least one event of abuse by age eleven.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Ninety-two percent of girls under 18 in the California [[Juvenile court|juvenile justice system]] report having faced emotional, sexual, or physical abuse. Eighty percent of women in prison in the United States have experienced an event of physical or sexual abuse in her lifetime.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This lifetime of violence is "pervasive and severe."&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The literature suggests that the prevalence of victimization among incarcerated women and its cumulative impact indicates that victimization is a central factor for women's entry into crime.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Demographics of victimization ==
The feminist pathways perspective is not meant to suggest that victimization is unique to women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Instead, this perspective addresses how gender impacts the experience of victimization, and how this difference in experience paves the path to crime for women. An individual's risk of victimization is shaped by environmental context, social networks, and demographics.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; [[Life course approach|Life course researchers]] maintain that people are exposed to violence to various degrees based on their location, socioeconomic circumstance, and lifestyle choices.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to the lifestyle exposure perspective, sociodemographic traits give rise to lifestyle differences which may put an individual at an increased risk of victimization.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Criminal Victimization in Eight American Cities|last=Hindelang|first=Michael|publisher=Ballinger|year=1976|isbn=|location=Cambridge|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, someone from a low-income neighborhood who spends time in public places at night and among strangers may be more likely to encounter offenders, and therefore at a greater risk of victimization.

=== Age ===
[[File:Age of victimization chart.png|thumb|Estimated Rates (Per 1,000 Persons 12 Years of Age or Older) of Personal Victimization, By Age (Hindelang 1976)|472x472px]]
Age is strongly associated with victimization risk, especially for property and violent crimes.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Victimization tends to be concentrated early in life.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Young people are significantly more likely to experience violent victimization than older adults.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Victimization risk peaks between ages 16 and 19.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; According to the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]], the risk of victimization increases by 8 percent from ages 12 to 15 and 16 to 19.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics- 1998|last=Bureau of Justice Statistics|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice.|year=1999|isbn=|location=Washington D.C.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Crime opportunity theory|opportunity perspective]] attributes this tendency to the way social activities are structured by age. Young adults are more likely to be in situations where they can be exposed to offenders, or engage in activities where they can be easily targeted.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The young age at which the risk of victimization peaks has significant implications on the psychological and social development of the victim.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Childhood is a [[critical period]] of growth, and child victims, according to the [[Cycle of violence|cycle of violence thesis]], will be more likely to be involved in violent crime in the future.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Thus, victimization during developmental years has the potential to disrupt the normal maturation of an individual, and shape the paths this individual may take– including the pathway to prison.

=== Gender ===
Gender shapes the risk, context, and consequences of victimization.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; According to government statistics, with the exception of rape, men are more likely than women to be victims of all violent crimes.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gender of Crime|last=Britton|first=Dana|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year=2011|isbn=|location=Lanham, MD|pages=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women are underrepresented as victims in official data, and are much more likely than men to be targets of certain types of victimization, such as [[rape]] and [[domestic violence]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Women are more likely to have been victims of [[child abuse]] than men&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Asscher|first=Jessica|last2=Put|first2=Claudia|last3=Stams|first3=Geert Jan J. M.|date=2015|title=Gender Differences in the Impact of Abuse and Neglect Victimization on Adolescent Offending Behavior|journal=Journal of Family Violence|volume=30|issue=2|pages=215–225|doi=10.1007/s10896-014-9668-4|pmid=25663744|pmc=4315896}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more likely to have experienced abuse at an early age.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The way victimization is gendered also impacts how women experience and respond to their victimization. Although victimization during childhood or adolescence is a predictor for female and male offending, the literature suggests it is a stronger predictor for females.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Researchers provides multiple explanations for why victimization has such a prominent effect on women’s future delinquency. Girls grow up in what [[Meda Chesney-Lind|Chesney-Lind]] describes as a “different world”&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; than boys, and therefore experience a different form of [[socialization]]. Feminist criminologists argue that women adapt to traumas differently than men due to gender inequalities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Women tend to have limited opportunities to cope with stress openly.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dornfeld|first=Maude|last2=Kruttschnitt|first2=Candace|date=1992|title=Do the Stereotypes Fit? Mapping Gender-Specific Outcomes and Risk Factors|url=|journal=Criminology|language=|volume=30|issue=3|pages=397–420|doi=10.1111/j.1745-9125.1992.tb01110.x|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, it is thought that women  internalize traumas as feelings of worthlessness, fear, or distress.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As a result, the negative effect of stressors is magnified in women.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; The literature proposes that gendered expectations and gender roles also shape how traumas impact women differently than men.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; For instance, society teaches women that they are values by the strength of their [[Social network|familial and social networks]]. That said, poor interpersonal relationships are a stronger risk factor for female offending than male offending.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Trauma theorists argue that traumas are rarely treated professionally.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women, therefore, may adapt to victimization by turning to activities or substances, like drugs, that are considered criminal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These crimes can be framed as coping strategies.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

=== Polyvictimization ===
Polyvictimization refers to experiencing different and simultaneous episodes of victimization.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Most incarcerated women who have experienced victimization have survived multiple traumas over a lifespan.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; These repeated traumas have an aggregate impact.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; A disproportionally high number of all victimizations account for polyvictimizations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Women are more likely to be polyvictimized than men.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; This is likely because females are more likely to be abused than males, and find themselves in abusive relationships from childhood to adulthood.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Research has recognized both the prevalence and mounting consequences of repeat victimization. Polyvictimization can disrupt multiple relationships and aspects of a woman’s life.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The ripple effects of these disruptions can push a woman off the "path of normalcy."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; There is evidence that unrelenting traumas in the early stages of a young girl’s life can lead her to act criminally or "out of the mainstream"&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Main Routes from Victimization to Crime ===
Women's victimization has both direct and indirect effects that relate to women's criminal behavior.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Among the many traumas female offenders experience in a lifetime, child abuse and partner abuse have well-documented associations with female criminal behavior.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==== Child abuse ====
[[File:Sample Pathways From Victimization to Crime.png|thumb|Sample pathways from child abuse to crime. Inspired by DeHart (2008).|470x470px]]
Female [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile delinquents]] are more frequently victims of sexual or physical abuse than male juvenile delinquents.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Eighty-two percent of the incarcerated women interviewed by Browne, Miller, and Maguin&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; at the [[Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women|Bedford Hills Maximum Security Correctional Facility]] were abused during childhood, and nearly 60 percent had been sexually abused by a parental figure.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Research suggests that girls experience [[child abuse]]– both physical and sexual –differently than boys.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; For instance, girls are more likely to have experienced penetrative abuse and less likely to have been physically abused.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Childhood victimization is a strong predictor of future criminal behavior and future mental health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anumba|first=Natalie|last2=Dematteo|first2=David|last3=Heilbrun|first3=Kirk|date=2012|title=Social Functioning, Victimization, and Mental Health among Female Offenders|url=http://cjb.sagepub.com/content/39/9/1204|journal=Criminal Justice and Behavior|volume=39|issue=9|pages=1204–1218|doi=10.1177/0093854812443489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the gender differences in child abuse experience, the association between child abuse and delinquency is also distinct for males and females. According to data collected from the Washington State Court Juvenile Assessment data, physical child abuse is a strong predictor of women's violent behavior.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; However, there is little research on the specific mechanism that links childhood victimization and delinquent behavior.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Feminist criminologists understand childhood victimization as a structured theme throughout the lives of incarcerated women. The long-term effects of childhood victimization are essential to understanding how women become incarcerated. For some women, childhood victimization directly relates to their involvement in crime.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Compelled to Crime: The Gender Entrapment of Battered Black Women|last=Richie|first=Beth|publisher=Routledge|year=1996|isbn=|location=London|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these situations, children may be "missocialized" by caregivers who offer them drugs, force them to steal, or exploit them as prostitutes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

[[Child abuse|Childhood victimization]] also has indirect links to future offending. There is evidence that girls from abusive households are more at risk to run away before adulthood, therefore subjecting themselves to an increased risk of becoming involved with drugs or prostitution.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; The majority of female juvenile offenders report that their first arrest was for running away from an abusive home.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Prostitution]], [[property crime]]s, and [[Illegal drug trade|drug distribution]] become means of survival for young female runaways.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Additionally, women who were physically or sexually abused as children by caretakers have a significantly higher risk of drug abuse and addiction.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;  Some young women become dependent on drugs to desensitize themselves from their traumatic histories.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Women's involvement in drugs or [[prostitution]] then significantly increases their chances of arrest or incarceration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Partner abuse ====
Studies have observed large numbers of incarcerated women who experienced [[intimate partner violence]] prior to incarceration.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; Seventy-five percent of the women studied by Browne, Miller, and Maguin&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; at the [[Bedford Hills Correctional Facility for Women|Bedford Hills Maximum Security Correctional Facility]] reported histories of partner abuse. Rates of partner abuse among female offenders are higher than those among male offenders.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;Harlow, Caroline Wolf. (1999). ''Prior Abuse Reported by Inmates and Probationers (Report No. NCJ 172879)''. Washington, DC: Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/ref&gt; A national correctional population survey from 1999 found that 61.3 percent of women had been abused by an intimate partner prior to incarceration, compared to only 5.9 percent of men.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Research on incarcerated women suggests there is an association between childhood sexual assault and adulthood sexual assault.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; This suggests that a lifetime of victimization is characteristic of the female offender.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raj|first=Anita|last2=Rose|first2=Jennifer|last3=Decker|first3=Michele R.|last4=Rosengard|first4=Cynthia|last5=Hebert|first5=Megan R.|last6=Stein|first6=Michael|last7=Clarke|first7=Jennifer G.|date=2008|title=Prevalence and Patterns of Sexual Assault Across the Life Span Among Incarcerated Women|url=http://vaw.sagepub.com/content/14/5/528|journal=Violence Against Women|language=en|volume=14|issue=5|pages=528–541|doi=10.1177/1077801208315528|issn=|pmid=18408171}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partner abuse is common within this lifetime of victimization.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Intimate partner violence has both direct and indirect implications for a woman's entry into crime.

Some feminist criminologists suggest that partner abuse coerces, if not forces, women to become involved in crime.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; In these situations, an abusive partner may entrap a woman into crime.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vawnet.org|title=Women's Experiences of Abuse as a Risk Factor for Incarceration|last=Gilfus|first=Mary|date=2002|website=|publisher=VAWnet: A Project of the National Resource Center on Domestic Violence/Pennsylvania Coalition Against Domestic Violence|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence that incarcerated women were forced by their partners– through physical attacks or threats –to commit murders, robbery, check fraud,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and sell or carry drugs.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Richie observed this gender entrapment among battered African-American women in New York City jails, whom she described as being "compelled to crime."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; [[Economic abuse|Financially abusive]] partners may manipulate women into debt until they are left with no resources, and as a result, are more likely to turn to criminal activities to support themselves.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

Partner abuse also has indirect effects on the pathway to crime. There is evidence that women are sometimes implicated for crimes related to their partner abuse.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some women, for example, retaliated against their abuser and were imprisoned for homicide-related charges.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Some women were implicated in the abuse of their children, who were also harmed by the abusive partner.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Research also finds that victims of intimate partner violence are likely to be involved with drugs.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Drugs are either introduced by the abuser,&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; or they become a self-medicated coping mechanism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Abusive partners sometimes isolate a woman from her social networks, thus structurally dislocating her from all legitimate institutions, such as family.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnold|first=Regina|date=1990|title=Processes of Victimization and Criminalization of Black Women|jstor=29766565|journal=Social Justice|volume=17.3|issue=41|pages=153–166|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women reported feeling a sense of rejection and worthlessness as a result of this isolation, and often coped by using drugs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Battered women are surrounded by extreme stress and can become dependent on these substances.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; Obtaining drugs puts these women at an increased risk of arrest.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

== Critique of the victimization explanation ==

=== Women's agency ===

The feminist perspective on crime is sometimes criticized for overemphasizing or disregarding women's agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sexed Work: Gender, Race, and Resistance in a Brooklyn Drug Market|last=Maher|first=Lisa|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Oxford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional feminist approaches to women in crime often overlook women's locations in society and place too much emphasis on women's individual choices.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Criminology|last=Schram|first=Pamela|last2=Tibbetts|first2=Stephen|publisher=Sage Publication|year=2014|isbn=978-1-4833-0228-7|location=Thousand Oaks|pages=307–309|chapter=Chapter 11: Feminist Theories of Crime}}&lt;/ref&gt; This paints female offenders as active participants who are compelled to act criminally. In contrast, some research strips women of their agency and portrays them as "passive victims of oppressive social structures, relations, and substances, or some combination thereof."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Invisible Woman: Gender, Crime, and Justice|last=Belknap|first=Joanne|publisher=Cengage Learning|year=2015|isbn=|location=Stamford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This portrayal perpetuates the notion that women are always submissive to social structures.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Critics hold that it is essential for research on women in crime to consider both the social-historical context and the woman's individual motivations.

=== Intersectionality ===

Although the feminist pathways perspective attempts to differentiate the experience of men and women in crime, it does not take into account the complex factors that also impact a woman's experiences and histories, such as race and class.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Some critics argue that a "feminist" perspective too often only considers the experiences of a white, middle-class woman.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Just as gender acts as an organizing principle in society, race and class also shape opportunity structures and social positions.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gender Through the Prism of Difference|last=Zinn|first=Maxine Baca|last2=Hondagneu-Sotelo|first2=Pierrette|last3=Denissen|first3=Amy|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A suburban upper-class, white woman, for instance, will likely encounter different forms of victimization in her lifetime than a lower-income, African American woman who lives in a crime-ridden neighborhood. An [[Intersectionality|intersectional]], or interlocking, perspective takes into account that other social identities impact an individual's victimization and path into crime. [[White feminism|Multicultural feminism]] is necessary to fully understand how social identities interact with traumatic life course events to pave the way to prison.

=== Separating offenders and victims ===

Feminist scholars have strongly discouraged researchers from portraying female offenders and victims as mutually exclusive groups.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Instead, critics argue the line between them should be blurred because women's involvement in crime is so often linked to their subordinate social positions, which make them vulnerable to victimization.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilfus|first=Mary|date=1993|title=From Victims to Survivors to Offenders|journal=Women &amp; Criminal Justice|volume=4|issue=1|pages=63–89|doi=10.1300/J012v04n01_04|issn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Critics hold that women can only be understood as criminals if they are also understood as victims, necessitating fluidity between offenders and victims.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In [[philosophy]], '''fraternity''' is a kind of [[ethics|ethical]] relationship between people, which is based on [[love]] and [[solidarity]]. A synonym of fraternity is '''brotherhood'''.

Fraternity is mentioned in the national motto of France, ''Liberté, égalité, fraternité'' ([[Liberty, equality, fraternity]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/french-court-rules-in-favor-of-humanitarian-aid-to-illegal-migrants-1530906461|title=French Court Rules in Favor of Humanitarian Aid to Illegal Migrants|first1=Josh|last1=Jacobs|first2=Sam|last2=Schechner|date=6 July 2018|publisher=|via=www.wsj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of former Yugoslavia ''[[Brotherhood and unity]]''.

'''Freedom of information''' is an extension of [[freedom of speech]], a fundamental [[human right]] recognized in [[international human rights law|international law]], which is today understood more generally  as [[freedom of expression]] in any medium, be it orally, in writing, print, through the [[Internet]] or through art forms.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} This means that the protection of freedom of speech as a right includes not only the content, but also the means of expression.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Puddephatt, Freedom of Expression, The essentials of Human Rights, Hodder Arnold, 2005, pg.128&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom of information also refers to the [[right to privacy]] in the content of the [[Internet]] and [[information technology]]. As with the right to freedom of expression, the [[right to privacy]] is a recognised [[human right]] and freedom of information acts as an extension to this right.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://freenetproject.org/papers/freenet-ieee.pdf Protecting Free Expression Online with Freenet - Internet Computing, IEEE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, freedom of information can include [[criticism of patents|opposition to patents]], [[Criticism of copyright|opposition to copyrights]] or [[criticism of intellectual property|opposition to intellectual property]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://somerandomnerd.com/node/647|title=Freedom of Information vs. Protection of Intellectual Property}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pirate Parties International|international]] and [[United States Pirate Party]] have established political platforms based largely on freedom of information issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Avast Network, What is the Pirate Party—and why is it helping Wikileaks?|url=http://www.tnr.com/article/world/81963/pirate-party-wikileaks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In law==
In June 2006 nearly 70 countries had freedom of information legislations applying to information held by government bodies and in certain circumstances to private bodies. In 19 of these countries the freedom of information legislation also applied to private bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=211 &amp; 223|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to information was increasingly recognised as a prerequisite for transparency and accountability of governments, as facilitating consumers' ability to make informed choices, and as safeguarding citizens against mismanagement and corruption. This has led an increasing number of countries to enact freedom of information legislation in the past 10 years.&lt;ref name="Mazhar Siraj 2010 213"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=213|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, private bodies have started to perform functions which were previously carried out by public bodies. Privatisation and de-regulation saw banks, telecommunications companies, hospitals and universities being run by private entities, leading to demands for the extension of freedom of information legislation to cover private bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=222|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government bodies ===
As of 2006, 70 countries had comprehensive freedom of information legislation for public bodies, nearly half of which had been enacted in the past 10 years. Such legislation was pending in a further 50 countries.&lt;ref name="Mazhar Siraj 2010 213"/&gt;

=== Private bodies ===
As of 2006, the following 19 countries had freedom of information legislation that extended to government bodies and private bodies: [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Angola]], [[Armenia]], [[Colombia]], the [[Czech Republic]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Iceland]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Panama]], [[Poland]], [[Peru]], [[South Africa]], [[Turkey]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Slovakia]], and the [[United Kingdom]]. The degree to which private bodies are covered under freedom of information legislation varies, in Angola, Armenia and Peru the legislation only applies to private companies that perform what are considered to be public functions. In the Czech Republic, the Dominican Republic, Finland, Trinidad and Tobago, Slovakia, Poland and Iceland private bodies that receive public funding are subject to freedom of information legislation. Freedom of information legislation in Estonia, France and UK covers private bodies in certain sectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=223|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa the access provisions of the Promotion of Access to Information Act have been used by individuals to establish why their loan application has been denied. The access provisions have also been used by minority shareholders in private companies and environmental groups, who were seeking information on the potential environmental damage caused by company projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=Journal of Alternative Perspectives on Social Sciences|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=223–224|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Consumer protection ====
In 1983 the [[United Nations Commission on Transnational Corporations]] adopted the [[United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection]] stipulating eight consumer rights, including "consumer access to adequate information to enable making informed choices according to individual wishes and needs". Access to information became regarded as a basic consumer right, and preventive disclosure, i.e. the disclosure of information on threats to human lives, health and safety, began to be emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mazhar Siraj|first=|title=Exclusion of Private Sector from Freedom of Information Laws: Implications from a Human Rights Perspective|journal=[[Journal of Alternative Perspectives in the Social Sciences]]|year=2010|volume=2|number=1|pages=216|url=http://www.japss.org/upload/11._Mazhar%5B1%5D.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Investors ====
Secretive decision making by company directors and corporate scandal led to freedom of information legislation to be published for the benefits of investors.

Freedom of information (or information freedom) also refers to the protection of the right to [[freedom of expression]] with regard to the [[Internet]] and [[information technology]]. Freedom of information may also concern [[censorship]] in an information technology context, i.e. the ability to access [[Web content]], without [[censorship]] or [[digital rights|restrictions]].

=== The Information Society and freedom of expression ===
The [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS) Declaration of Principles adopted in 2003 reaffirms [[democracy]] and the universality, indivisibility and interdependence of all [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms. The Declaration also makes specific reference to the importance of the right to [[freedom of expression]] for the "[[information society|Information Society]]" in stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We reaffirm, as an essential foundation of the [[information society|Information Society]], and as outlined in Article 19 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], that everyone has the right to [[Freedom of speech|freedom of opinion and expression]]; that this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers. Communication is a fundamental social process, a basic human need and the foundation of all social organisation. It is central to the Information Society. Everyone, everywhere should have the opportunity to participate and no one should be excluded from the benefits the Information Society offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Klang | first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age | year = 2005| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=USksfqPjwhUC&amp;dq=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights&amp;cad=0| publisher = Routledge |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 2004 WSIS Declaration of Principles also acknowledged that "it is necessary to prevent the use of information resources and technologies for criminal and terrorist purposes, while respecting human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Klang | first1 = Mathias| last2 = Murray| first2 = Andrew| title = Human Rights in the Digital Age | year = 2005| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=USksfqPjwhUC&amp;dq=%22digital+rights%22+human+rights&amp;cad=0| publisher = Routledge |page=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wolfgang Benedek comments that the WSIS Declaration only contains a number of references to human rights and does not spell out any procedures or mechanism to assure that human rights are considered in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Internet Governance and the Information Society |last=Benedek |first=Wolfgang |author2=Veronika  Bauer |author3=Matthias Kettemann  |year=2008 |publisher= Eleven International Publishing |location= |isbn=90-77596-56-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ie7Yqiw85TcC&amp;vq=%22Internet+Bill+of+rights%22&amp;dq=%22digital+rights%22+%22human+rights%22&amp;cad=0 |page=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hacktivismo ===
{{main|Hacktivismo}}
The [[digital rights]] group [[Hacktivismo]], founded in 1999, argues that access to information is a basic [[human right]]. The group's beliefs are described fully in the "Hacktivismo Declaration" which calls for the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) to be applied to the [[Internet]]. The Declaration recalls the duty of member states to the ICCPR to protect the right to [[freedom of expression]] with regard to the internet and in this context freedom of information.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;http://www.cultdeadcow.com/cDc_files/declaration.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Hacktivismo Declaration recognises "the importance to fight against human rights abuses with respect to reasonable access to information on the Internet" and calls upon the [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] community to "study ways and means of circumventing state sponsored [[censorship]] of the internet" and "implement technologies to challenge information rights violations". The Hacktivismo Declaration does, however, recognise that the right to [[freedom of expression]] is subject to limitations, stating "we recognised the right of governments to forbid the publication of properly categorized [[state secrets]], [[child pornography]], and matters related to personal [[privacy]] and [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]], among other accepted restrictions." However, the Hacktivismo Declaration states "but we oppose the use of state power to control access to the works of critics, [[intellectuals]], [[artists]], or religious figures."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

=== Global Network Initiative ===
On October 29, 2008 the [[Global Network Initiative]] (GNI) was founded upon its "Principles on Freedom of Expression and Privacy". The Initiative was launched in the 60th Anniversary year of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] (UDHR) and is based on internationally recognized laws and standards for [[human rights]] on [[freedom of expression]] and [[privacy]] set out in the UDHR, the [[International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights]] (ICCPR) and the [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] (ICESCR).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php Global Network Initiative, FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090309234331/http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/faq/index.php |date=2009-03-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the Initiative include the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[Human Rights Watch]], [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], other major companies, human rights NGOs, investors, and academics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/english/docs/2008/10/29/global20097.htm Internet Rights Protection Initiative Launches]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalnetworkinitiative.org/participants/index.php Global Network Initiative, Participants]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to reports [[Cisco Systems]] was invited to the initial discussions but didn't take part in the initiative. [[Harrington Investments]], which proposed that Cisco establish a human rights board, has dismissed the GNI as a voluntary code of conduct not having any impact. Chief executive John Harrington called the GNI "meaningless noise" and instead calls for bylaws to be introduced that force boards of directors to accept human rights responsibilities.&lt;ref name="Glanville"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/17/censorship-internet |title=The big business of net censorship |last=Glanville  |first=Jo |date=17 November 2008 |publisher= The Guardian | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet censorship ===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Internet police officer chacha.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Internet [[police officer]] [[Jingjing and Chacha|Chacha]], one of the [[cartoon]] [[mascots]] of the Internet Surveillance Division of the Public Security Bureau in [[Shenzhen]], [[China]].]] --&gt;
{{main|Internet censorship}}
Jo Glanville, editor of the [[Index on Censorship]], states that "the internet has been a revolution for censorship as much as for free speech".&lt;ref name="Glanville"/&gt; The concept of freedom of information has emerged in response to state sponsored censorship, monitoring and surveillance of the internet. Internet censorship includes the control or suppression of the publishing or accessing of information on the [[Internet]].
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Iran Web screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|A screenshot of a blocked website in Iran.]] --&gt;

According to the [[Reporters without Borders]] (RSF) "internet enemy list" the following states engage in pervasive internet censorship: [[Cuba]], [[Iran]], [[Maldives]], [[Myanmar]]/[[Burma]], [[North Korea]], [[Syria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=19603 List of the 13 Internet enemies] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102000000/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=19603 |date=January 2, 2008 }} RSF, 2006 November&lt;/ref&gt; A widely publicised example is the so-called "[[Great Firewall of China]]" (in reference both to its role as a [[firewall (networking)|network firewall]] and to the ancient [[Great Wall of China]]). The system blocks content by preventing [[IP address]]es from being routed through and consists of standard firewall and [[proxy server]]s at the [[Internet]] [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]]s. The system also selectively engages in [[DNS poisoning]] when particular sites are requested. The government does not appear to be systematically examining Internet content, as this appears to be technically impractical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/china/story/0,,1713317,00.html|title=War of the words |publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Watts | date=2006-02-20 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China]] is conducted under a wide variety of laws and administrative regulations. In accordance with these laws, more than sixty Internet regulations have been made by the People's Republic of China (PRC) government, and censorship systems are vigorously implemented by provincial branches of state-owned [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s, business companies, and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/china0806/3.htm|title= II.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], speaking on behalf of the [[United States]], declared 'we stand for a single internet where all of humanity has equal access to knowledge and ideas'. In her 'Remarks on Internet Freedom' she also draws attention to how 'even in authoritarian countries, information networks are helping people discover new facts and making governments more accountable', while reporting President [[Barack Obama]]'s pronouncement 'the more freely information flows, the stronger societies become'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2010/01/135519.htm |title=Remarks on Internet Freedom |publisher=US Department of State website |accessdate=December 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inner peace''' (or '''peace of mind''') refers to a deliberate state of psychological or spiritual calm despite the potential presence of [[Stressor|stressors]]. Being "at peace" is considered by many to be healthy ([[homeostasis]]) and the opposite of being stressed or anxious, and is considered to be a state where our mind performs at an optimal level with a positive outcome.  Peace of mind is thus generally associated with [[wiktionary:bliss|bliss]], [[happiness]] and [[contentment]].

Peace of mind, [[wiktionary:serenity|serenity]], and [[calmness]] are descriptions of a disposition free from the effects of stress.  In some cultures, inner peace is considered a state of [[consciousness]] or [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] that may be cultivated by various forms of training, such as [[prayer]], [[meditation]], [[tai chi]] or [[yoga]], for example.  Many spiritual practices refer to this peace as an experience of [[Know thyself|knowing oneself]].  Finding inner peace (Shanti, Santhi or Shanthi, from {{lang-sa|शान्तिः}}, {{IAST|śāntiḥ}}, {{IPA-sa|ʃaːnt̪iɧ}}; √ शम śam: ‘be calm’) means peace, rest, calmness, tranquility, or bliss is often associated with traditions such as  [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]] and [[Jainism]].

People have difficulties embracing their inner spirituality because everyday stressors get the best of them; finding peace and happiness in the little joys of life can seem like a lot of work, and results do not seem all that gratifying.  Achieving spirituality is a step-by-step process; there are ways through which one can become more spiritual every day.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

[[Tenzin Gyatso]], the current and 14th [[Dalai Lama]], emphasizes the importance of inner peace in the world: 
{{quote|text=The question of real, lasting world peace concerns human beings, so basic human feelings are also at its roots.  Through inner peace, genuine world peace can be achieved.  In this the importance of individual responsibility is quite clear; an atmosphere of peace must first be created within ourselves, then gradually expanded to include our families, our communities, and ultimately the whole planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

{{BLP refimprove|date=May 2016}}
'''Jean Marie Syjuco''' (born June 26, 1952) is a [[Painting|painter]], [[installation artist]], and [[performance artist]] from [[Manila]], [[Philippines]].

Through the 1980s and the 1990s, Jean Marie brought attention and institutional support to the maverick art-form of [[Performance Art]] in the Philippines. Beginning in the 1970s as an extension of her work as a [[visual artist]], her performance works developed from conceptual pieces of marked brevity rooted in anti-narrative devices, to the thematic spectacles and large-scale collaborations and video documentations for which she is now better known.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aaa.org.hk/Collection/Details/25051&lt;/ref&gt;

For over 3 decades, she has balanced her roles as a painter of Abstract and Fantasy genres, sculptor, installation and performance artist.  Since she was awarded the ''Gold Medal for Sculpture in the 1980 AAP (Art Institution of the Philippines) Annual Art Competition'', her transmedia objects and installations have occupied a unique place in contemporary art for their [[avant-garde]] melding of folk and technological elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Castillones |first=Danny |url=http://cuadrofilipino.blogspot.com/2008/04/orphaned-egg-weapons-of-mass.html |title=CuadroFilipino: Weapons of Mass Destruction in Cesare &amp; Jean Marie Syjuco’s Aesthetics |website=Cuadrofilipino.blogspot.com |date=2008-04-24 |accessdate=2016-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean Marie Syjuco was a recipient of the 1990 [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]] Gawad CCP Para Sa Sining Biswal Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://fineartmanila.com/artists/biography/syjuco&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, she is building the ''New “Art Lab”'', a non-profit developmental art facility (founded with her husband, [[Cesare Syjuco]]), which served as the haven of experimental art in the 1990s. &lt;ref&gt;[http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/89493/a-home-or-a-gallery-or-both]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Park rzeźby na bródnie bródno 2.jpg|thumb|"Bródno" – Bródno Sculpture Park in Warsaw (Poland)]]
'''Jens Haaning''' (born 1965) is a Danish conceptual, contemporary artist living and working in [[Copenhagen]].

Haaning has produced a body of artworks since the 1990s, which – when seen together – offers an acute reflection of a complex and changing society in the West. The works address the existing structures of power and communication in the global society and necessitate a debate around subjects such as migration, displacement, nationalism, and other aspects related to our coexistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gibca.se/index.php/en/2017/artists-gibca-2017/jens-haaning|title=GIBCA • Jens Haaning|website=www.gibca.se|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often the works consist of interventions in institutional structures or public spaces. Examples of these are: ‘Middelburg Summer 1996’ (1996), which was a temporary relocation of a factory employing immigrant workers to the exhibition space De Vleeshal, Middelburg, The Netherlands, and ‘Turkish Jokes’ (1994) a sound piece with a tape-recording of jokes, told by Turks in their native language, which was originally played in a public square in Oslo, Norway.

==Exhibitions==
Haaning has exhibited extensively, the main exhibitions include: [[Documenta11|Documenta XI]], [[Kassel]], Germany (2002), the 9th [[Istanbul Biennial]], [[Istanbul]], Turkey (2005), Traffic at [[CAPC Museé d'art contemporain]], [[Bordeaux]], France (1996), [[Vienna Secession]], [[Vienna]], Austria (1997, 1998, 2007), Publicness at [[Institute of Contemporary Arts|ICA]], [[London]], England (2003), the 6th [[Gwangju Biennale]], [[Gwangju]], South Korea (2002, 2006) and latest a large survey of Haaning’s works from the 1990s until 2017 at Göteborg International Biennial for Contemporary Art, [[Gothenburg]], Sweden (2017).

A '''kangaroo court''' is a court that ignores recognized standards of law or justice, and often carries little or no official standing in the territory within which it resides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kangaroo%20court| title = kangaroo court |website = Merriam-Webster Dictionary |accessdate = 2011-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may also apply to a court held by a legitimate judicial authority who intentionally disregards the court's legal or ethical obligations. The defendants in such courts are often denied access to legal representation and in some cases, proper defence.

Prejudicial bias of the decision-maker or from political decree are among the most publicized causes of kangaroo courts.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} Such proceedings are often held to give the appearance of a fair and just trial, even though the verdict was already decided before the trial actually began.

A kangaroo court could also develop when the structure and operation of the forum result in an inferior brand of adjudication. A common example of this is when institutional disputants ("repeat players") have excessive and unfair structural advantages over individual disputants ("one-shot players").&lt;ref&gt;Stempel, Jeffrey W. 8 Nev. L.J. 251 (2007-2008) Keeping Arbitrations from becoming Kangaroo Courts&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''kangaroo court'' is often erroneously believed to have its origin from the courts of Australia's penal colonies.&lt;ref name="Etymology" /&gt; However, the first published instance of the term is from an American source in the year 1853.&lt;ref name=OED&gt;{{cite dictionary|dictionary=Oxford English Dictionary|title=kangaroo court|accessdate=3 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources suggest that it may have been popularized during the [[California Gold Rush]] of 1849, along with ''mustang court'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=kangaroo+court&amp;searchmode=none |title=Kangaroo Court |website=Etymology Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a description of the hastily carried-out proceedings used to deal with the issue of [[Land claim#Mining claim (United States)|claim jumping]] miners.&lt;ref name=Etymology&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=What's the origin of "kangaroo court"? Is "kangaroo" aborigine for "I don't know"?|url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/491/whats-the-origin-of-kangaroo-court|publisher=The Straight Dope|accessdate=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ostensibly the term comes from the notion of justice proceeding "by leaps", like a [[kangaroo]]&lt;ref name=brockbond&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/x1331803980/Minor-League-Baseball-In-this-court-most-anything-goes#axzz2Nq4oSU1r|archive-date=April 11, 2013|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130411120510/http://www.norwichbulletin.com/sports/x1331803980/Minor-League-Baseball-In-this-court-most-anything-goes%23axzz2Nq4oSU1r#axzz2Nq4oSU1r|dead-url=yes|title=Minor League Baseball In this court most anything goes|website=The Bulletin}}&lt;/ref&gt; – in other words, "jumping over" (intentionally ignoring) evidence that would be in favour of the defendant. Another possibility is that the phrase could refer to the pouch of a kangaroo, meaning the court is in someone's pocket. The phrase is popular in the UK, US, Australia and New Zealand and is still in common use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Kangaroo+Court |title=Kangaroo Court |website=Legal Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As informal proceedings in sports==
The term is sometimes used without any negative connotation. For example, many [[Major League Baseball]] and [[Minor League Baseball]] teams have a kangaroo court to punish players for [[error (baseball)|errors]] and other mistakes on the field, as well as for being late for a game or practice, not wearing proper attire to road games, or having a messy locker in the clubhouse. Fines are allotted, and at the end of the year, the money collected is given to [[Charitable organization|charity]]. The organization may also use the money for a team party at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bouton | first = Jim | authorlink = Jim Bouton | title = Ball Four | publisher = [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|Wiley]] | date = 1990 | edition = 2nd | isbn = 0-02-030665-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
Some examples of adjudication venues described as kangaroo courts are the [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]] (Volksgerichtshof) of [[Nazi Germany]] that convicted people who were suspected of being involved with the [[20 July plot#Aftermath|failed plot to assassinate Hitler on July 20, 1944]].

Another example is the trial of [[Pol Pot]] and his brother Ieng San by the [[People's Revolutionary Tribunal (Cambodia)|People's Revolutionary Tribunal]] in [[Cambodia]] in August 1979. After a lengthy trial with a duration of five days, both were sentenced to death ''[[in absentia]]'' on August 19, 1979.&lt;ref name="Schlund-Vials, C. J. 2012"&gt;Schlund-Vials, C. J. (2012), ''War, Genocide and Justice'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press&lt;/ref&gt; Conclusive evidence showed that the verdicts and the sentencing papers had been prepared in advance of the trial.&lt;ref name=chandler&gt;{{cite journal |last= Chandler |first= David |date =  2008|title= Cambodia Deals with its Past: Collective Memory, Demonisation and Induced Amnesia |url = https://doi.org/10.1080/14690760802094933 |language = en |journal = Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions |volume= 9 |issue=2-3 |pages= 355–369 |doi= 10.1080/14690760802094933|access-date= 2018-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relying on this evidence the United Nations proceeded to delegitimize the tribunal stating that it did not comply with standards of international law.&lt;ref name="Schlund-Vials, C. J. 2012"/&gt;

During the [[Romanian Revolution]] in 1989, [[President of Romania|President]] and [[General Secretary of the Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party General Secretary]] [[Nicolae Ceausescu]] and his wife [[Elena Ceausescu|Elena]] were [[Trial of Nicolae and Elena Ceausescu|sentenced to death]] by a kangaroo court of soldiers from the [[Romanian People's Army]], which recently switched to the side of the revolutionaries.

'''Kliper''' ('''Клипер''', [[English language|English]]: '''Clipper''') was an early-2000s proposed partly- &lt;!--orbital section and probably thermal protection shield are not reusable--&gt;[[Reusable launch system|reusable]] manned [[spacecraft]] concept by [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|RSC Energia]]. Due to lack of funding from the ESA and RSA, the project was indefinitely postponed by 2006.

Designed primarily to replace the [[Soyuz spacecraft]], Kliper was proposed in two versions: as a pure [[lifting body]] design and as [[spaceplane]] with small [[wing]]s. In either case, the craft would have been able to glide into the atmosphere at an angle that produces much less stress on the human occupants than the current Soyuz. Kliper was intended to be designed to be able to carry up to six people and to perform ferry services between Earth and the [[International Space Station]].

==Development==

===Announcement of the program===
[[File:Soyuz TMA-6 spacecraft.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Soyuz TMA-6]] spacecraft approaching the International Space Station - the Soyuz spacecraft would have been replaced by Kliper]]
In February 2004 Nikolai Moiseyev, the deputy director of [[Russian Federal Space Agency]] (FSA) told journalists that the Kliper project had been included in the Russian federal space program for 2005-15. At that point he announced that if the program is implemented successfully the first launch may even take place in five years' time. Kliper had been developed since 2000 and reportedly relied heavily on research studies as well as proposals for a small Russian [[lifting body]] spacecraft from the 1990s. Externally its design was comparable to the cancelled European minishuttle [[Hermes (shuttle)|Hermes]] or the [[NASA]] study [[X-38]]. It was planned to be the successor to the veteran spacecraft Soyuz, which has been built in various modifications since 1961.

===Early search for support===
In 2005 Kliper was displayed in several [[airshow|air show]]s around Europe and Asia, in order to reach out to international partners who would be interested to co-fund and co-develop the spacecraft. The [[Russian Space Agency]] especially looked to Europe as the European Space Agency ([[ESA]]) had become its major partner in space activities during the last years. In May 2005 rumours started in the press that Europe would join the Kliper project in a specially funded venture that would be part of the [[Aurora Programme]]. These rumours turned out to be correct when both Russian and European space officials announced their cooperation to build Kliper during the [[Paris Air Show]] in [[Le Bourget]] on June 10, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news4524.html|title=ESA to join Russia's Kliper program|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsvote.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/4286086.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Science/Nature - Plans for Euro-Russian spaceplane|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vladimir Taneev, the leading designer of the Kliper system, speculated on the contribution of Europe to the project in the following way:{{when|date=October 2016}}
:The European companies will likely contribute avionics, materials, and cabin systems. Many different options are on the table, and in the near future we expect to form Russian-European working groups specialized in different subsystems and fields of design.

The Russian Space Agency as well as ESA announced{{when|date=October 2016}} that they would continue to look for other international partners such as [[Japan]] to invest in Kliper. A substantive cooperation with NASA was unlikely, due to the parallel development of America's own next-generation manned launch vehicle, the [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]] (CEV).{{cn|date=October 2016}}

A further element of this process was made public on October 12, 2005, when various press agencies revealed that [[JAXA]], the Japanese space agency, had been officially approached by Russia to participate in the project. [[JAXA]] has made it clear that they are more likely to join the project if ESA does so first, which was in doubt after ESA members rejected a study for Europe's involvement in the Kliper project in December 2005.{{cn|date=October 2016}} The addition of Japan would make Kliper a truly multinational project, potentially combining the rugged reliability of Russian launchers with Japanese computer technology. A greater pan-national consensus would have allowed for a lighter funding burden on each participant as well.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

===Estimated costs===
Announcements and speculations following the February 2004 press conference suggested a development budget of {{currency|10 billion|RUB}}  (about {{currency|400 million|USD}}). However, in looking at today's costs for human space travel it was clear that the 10 billion rubles figure was a rather low estimate. In May 2005 [[The Guardian]] reported that costs are estimated to be roughly {{currency|3 billion|USD}} (for development and construction of Kliper until 2015) of which the bulk of {{currency|1.8 billion|USD}} was speculated to come from Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/space/article/0,14493,1489679,00.html|title=Europe to hitch space ride on Russia's rocket|author=Robin McKie|work=the Guardian|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different sources in 2005 have reported that the money needed for the program would be {{currency|1.5 billion|euro}} (about {{currency|1.8 billion|USD}})&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1649104,00.html|title=Europeans Take on NASA|work=DW.COM|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on December 12, 2005 an article stated it would be {{currency|1 billion|euro}} (solely in relation to development costs).&lt;ref name="DWeurope"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1812755,00.html|title=Europe Keen to Join Russia in New Spaceship Project|work=DW.COM|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 14, 2005 the Russian government approved the national space program for 2006 to 2015 with a budget of {{currency|305 billion|RUB}} (about {{currency|11 billion|USD}}). The whole budget for the 10-year period was to have been {{currency|425 billion|RUB}} (about {{currency|15 billion|USD}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2005/07/15/afx2141304.html |date=15 July 2005 | work=Forbes | title=Russian govt agrees 12.5 bln eur 10-yr space programme |archivedate=1 May 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070501124334/http://www.forbes.com/finance/feeds/afx/2005/07/15/afx2141304.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The budget included the needed funding for the Kliper program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rbcnews.com/free/20050714122650.shtml|title=RosBusinessConsulting - News Online|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus in face of Europe's denial to fund a {{currency|50 million|euro}} feasibility study for the Kliper project at the European space summit in December 2005, Russian space officials have announced that Russia would fund Kliper even without any European contribution.&lt;ref name="DWeurope" /&gt;

The most recent article on Kliper stated that the project would have incurred {{currency|16 billion|RUB}} (about {{currency|600 million|USD}}) in development costs, {{currency|11 billion|RUB}} of which will be financed by the government and {{currency|5 billion|RUB}} by contractors.&lt;ref name="notflightglobal"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2006/02/14/Navigation/177/204620/Kliper+choice+delayed.html |title=Flight International: Kliper choice delayed |access-date=27 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First launch and target for regular flights===
In 2004 it was announced that it was likely that Kliper would make its first launch as early as 2010 or 2011, the same time the [[Space Shuttle]] was scheduled to be retired.  However, it was reported by [[BBC]] News on September 27, 2005, that the first flight tests were not planned until 2011, with the first manned flights in 2012 and the [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]] being phased out over time until 2014. An article on December 3, 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20051202/42288677.html|title=Russian technologies can put cosmonauts on Moon|author=Sputnik|date=2 December 2005|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; cited the president of the [[NPO Energia|Energia]] Rocket and Space Corporation [[Nikolai Sevastyanov]] that "the first regular lift-off is scheduled for 2012, while a complete transport system will be in place by 2015." After the termination of the Russian Space Agency's tender for a new spacecraft, Energia announced that this would push its Kliper proposal's first flight&amp;nbsp;— if developed at all&amp;nbsp;— back further.  In the event, the development project did not continue.

===ESA's part in Kliper — uncertainty over European cooperation===
[[File:International Space Station after undocking of STS-132.jpg|Kliper was planned to be Russia's and even Europe's primary access route to the [[International Space Station]]|300px|right|thumb]]

On September 28, 2005 the [[BBC News|BBC]] reported that Alan Thirkettle, head of ESA's Human Spaceflight Development Department, stated that Kliper would be used: "For future exploration, when we have the objective of going to the Moon, it is important to have several possibilities to go there, and within this framework of cooperation to have our own access to orbit around the Moon."  In the same context, Alain Fournier-Sicre, head of the ESA permanent mission in the Russian Federation, also stated that: "The objective is to have a vehicle which is more comfortable than the Soyuz capsule which will be used with pilots and four passengers…  It is meant to service the space station and to go between Earth and an orbit around the Moon with six crew members."

Although there seemed to be a lot of enthusiasm for Kliper within Alan Thirkettle’s team at ESA (as outlined in the above paragraph), on December 7, 2005, the European space summit of governmental officials of ESA member states declined to approve a 50-million-euro two-year study focusing on ESA's potential involvement in the Kliper project. In denying funding for the study ESA members stated that, among other factors that seemed unfavourable, under the current Russian proposal Europe would not share control over the design of the program and would be limited to being a small industrial contributor.

[[Jean-Jacques Dordain]], ESA's Director General, put the refusal to fund the study into context: "It is not a question of member states for and member states against.  I think the decision could not be taken for reasons that are not linked to Clipper itself.  The decision could not be taken because of budgetary restraints."  Dordain concluded that he was convinced that European support for Kliper was vital for ESA's future involvement in space transport and that a favourable decision can be achieved until June 2006. In concluding "We need two transportation systems in the world",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2005/051205/full/051205-7.html |publisher=Nature |title=Europe unites over space budget |date=12 May 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Dordain also outlined shortly after the European Space Summit that the primary requirement of Europe's involvement in the Kliper project was to rely on two separate systems to support the [[International Space Station|ISS]] as had been proven vital after the [[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]] Space Shuttle disaster in 2003.

Dordain's remarks were echoed by Daniel Sacotte, ESA's director of human spaceflight, microgravity and exploration, in saying simply that "The Russians are not going to finance it, we will finance it from our side", despite adding a cautionary note that "We needed the support from at least two states out of France, Italy and Germany. We didn't get it."  What this means in practical terms remains to be seen; however, what is clear is that ESA officials are still pushing for Europe's involvement in the Kliper project.

Very negative comments relative to Kliper were brought by the various national delegations at the December meeting, in particular by the French Minister of Research [[François Goulard]]. In short, there remain for the time being member states strongly committed to Kliper, and others just as strongly opposed. The long-term view remains uncertain.

In 2006, Jean-Jacques Dordain explained that money allocated to space transportation development, which ESA currently funds in the amount of 300 million for the next 3 years, could be used for Europe's involvement in the project. Given the February 2006 statement that 5 billion rubles (~$200 million) of the development costs will come from "contractors", a limited involvement of ESA in Kliper might have been forthcoming.{{cn|date=October 2016}}

===Russian Space Agency's tender for Kliper===
At the end of 2005, [[Roskosmos]] announced that a tender for Kliper would be held in January 2006 between [[RKK Energia]], [[Khrunichev]] and [[OKB-4 Molniya|Molniya]] with a selection date of February 3, 2006. However concerns about the bids led to a delay in the process, with a resubmittal deadline of March, 2006 and selection was rescheduled for April 2006. Following further delays, the tender was cancelled on 18 July 2006.&lt;ref name=flightglobal&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/07/18/Navigation/200/207935/Farnborough+Russia's+Federal+Space+Agency+cancels+manned+spacecraft.html www.flightglobal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- RSC Energia, along with two other companies, [[Khrunichev]] and [[OKB-4 Molniya|Molniya]], submitted proposals to the Russian Space Agency [[Roskosmos]] for the state tender of the Russian Space Agency for the Soyuz successor spacecraft. On July 18, 2006, the tender, that was unofficially tied with suggested ESA financial support, was cancelled. None of the three proposals were chosen by the Russian Federal Space Agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/07/18/Navigation/200/207935/Farnborough+Russia's+Federal+Space+Agency+cancels+manned+spacecraft.html Flightglobal: Russia's Federal Space Agency cancels manned spacecraft tender]&lt;/ref&gt; After cancellation of the tender the Russian Space Agency has decided to collaborate with the European Space Agency on a study to develop a capsule-type spacecraft under the [[CSTS|Crew Space Transportation System]].--&gt;

In late July 2006, the Russian Space Agency and the European Space Agency agreed to collaborate on a different project to develop a new spacecraft. They decided to fund a study under a program labelled Crew Space Transportation System ([[CSTS]]) which started in September 2006 and evaluate a capsule type concept, derived from Soyuz. While this program is the follow-on project of the RSA's and ESA's collaboration on a new spacevehicle, this program is no longer connected to Energia's winged Kliper design.

&lt;!-- Energia has announced that it will try to seek private funding to develop and build its winged Kliper spacecraft, but has conceded that without the funding by the Russian government Kliper will take longer until flyoff, if it is eventually developed and built. --&gt;
RSC Energia continued to pursue the project without Russian government support and announced that it would seek private investment for the craft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/Articles/2006/07/19/Navigation/200/207953/Farnborough+Energia’s+Kliper+work+continues+with+wind+tunnel.html Flightglobal: Farnborough Air Show - Energia's Klipper work continues]&lt;/ref&gt; News reports in Russia indicated that Kliper was still expected to be ready for [[Russian Space Agency]] test flights around the year 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20061226/57833667.html|title=Russia remains leader in spacecraft launches - space agency|author=Sputnik|date=26 December 2006|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of Russian spacecraft upgrade program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20061220/57396095.html|title=Russia set to implement ambitious space program (Part II)|author=Sputnik|date=20 December 2006|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energia.ru/english/energia/news/news-2006/public_07-01.html RSC Energia: Concept of Russian Manned Space Navigation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070701035626/http://www.energia.ru/english/energia/news/news-2006/public_07-01.html |date=2007-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has been officially halted in June 2007, after the major proponent of the project, Nikolai Sevastyanov, was dismissed from the position of the president of RSC Energia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/spacenews/archive07/energia_0723.html Energia Chief Dismissed Amid Differences with Roskosmos]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly appointed president of RSC Energia, Vitaly Lopota, confirmed that Kliper would not be displayed on the 2007 MAKS aviation and space show. He said that Energia would spend more time on the project analysis, perform additional dynamic modeling, revise the design and appearance and then would come up with new proposals for Roscosmos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazeta.ru/2007/07/31/oa_245696.shtml|title=Акционеры РКК "Энергия" избрали Виталия Лопоту президентом|work=Газета.Ru|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Vitaly Lopota shared his vision about new Russian spacecraft. He mentioned two possible options: a space capsule, which better suits missions to the Moon and Mars, and a lifted body design for low Earth orbit missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rg.ru/2008/02/05/lopota.html|title=Виталий Лопота: Нужно прийти к тому, чтобы новый образец космической техники появлялся не через десятилетия, а через месяцы|work=Российская газета|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ng.ru/style/2008-04-23/24_cliper.html|title=К "Клиперу" вернулась "Энергия"|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to new plans, instead of Kliper the new [[Prospective Piloted Transport System|PPTS (Rus)]] will be developed since 2009 to 2017-2018.
&lt;!--
=== Current Progress: Kliper now part of Russian spacecraft upgrade program ===
It has recently been reported that Kliper will be developed as the final stage of Russian manned and cargo spacecraft "overhaul". According to the article, the spacecraft upgrade program stages are: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20061220/57396095.html|title=Russia set to implement ambitious space program (Part II)|author=Sputnik|date=20 December 2006|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Stage one: Starting in 2007, upgrade of Soyuz space vehicles. As a rule, each Soyuz crew consists of two professional astronauts and one space tourist. The revamped Soyuz, due to lift off in 2011, will carry two professionals and two passengers. Most importantly, it will be able to dock with the International Space Station, fly around the Moon and return to Earth at speeds of about 40 000 kilometers per hour (25 000 miles per hour), the equivalent of its [[escape velocity]]. ''(Note the similarity to [[European Space Agency|ESA]] requirements - this may effectively make CSTS development redundant)''
*Stage Two: Development of the Parom (Ferry) reusable transport system, which will replace the Progress cargo craft. The Parom system will comprise a reusable orbiter and expendable 12-metric-ton freight containers. This is a remarkable achievement because Progress spacecraft can now deliver just 2.5 metric tons of dry and liquid cargo to the ISS.
*Stage Three: This stage will witness the launch of a Kliper-type reusable space shuttle featuring technologies that will be streamlined during the first and second stages.

''The stages described in this report are very consistent to [[S.P. Korolev Rocket and Space Corporation Energia|Energia]]'s "Concept of national manned space navigation" proposal, as described by chief Nikolay Sevastiyanov on May 24, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energia.ru/english/energia/news/news-2006/public_07-01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;''

Energia's lead designer of the Kliper project has said that there are plans for a manned flight in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,391480,00.html|title=International Space Race Heats Up as More Players Jump In|work=Fox News|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
--&gt;

==Design==
Given the Russian Space Agency's preference for Energia's lifting body proposal this part of the article concentrates entirely on Energia's design for Kliper.

===Overview===
Kliper's [[design]] was another attempt to solve the geometric problems of spacecraft. Soyuz has an Orbital Module, a hollow sphere, to be used for eating and hygiene, and an airlock located above the Reentry module (the capsule), with the docking mechanism at the top. In the event of an emergency, it would be lifted away from the rocket along with the reentry module, and the fairing over the spacecraft was designed to successfully split apart either circumferentially just below the reentry module in such an emergency or longitudinally if the flight should be successful. Kliper was designed with the Orbital Module below its reentry module, and the docking mechanism below that. This was made possible by constructing a reentry module broader than the orbital module, so that a pair of rocket nozzles for orbital maneuvering could have been fitted alongside it, as the later [[Salyut]] space stations had.

In connection with this new design, Kliper would feature a launch escape system that would enable it to detach from the [[carrier rocket]] if an abort of the mission during orbital ascent is required. An abort would be possible during every phase of the launch with the limitation of the first seconds after launch.&lt;ref name="RIAN-launch"/&gt;

===Lifting body design===

On return from space, Kliper's [[lifting body]] design would not only allow a smoother descent into Earth's atmosphere than the [[space capsule|capsule]] design, such as Soyuz; but also permit control. [[RKK Energia]] claimed that the craft would be able to land in a predetermined one-square-kilometre area. Artistic impressions showed that the Kliper would have resembled a cylinder topped by a cone. Originally, landing proposals involved both a landing by [[parachute]] and as an alternative, in a modified version, a landing on a runway similar to an aircraft, or the Space Shuttle. However, leading designer [[Vladimir Daneev]] commented on this issue in June 2005:
:''We are 99% sure that it will be a spaceship with upturned little wings, enabling the Kliper to land on any class-one military airfield with a runway from three to three and a half kilometres in length.''&lt;ref name=RIAN-launch&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/science/20050614/40521455.html|title=Russia's new spaceship to save crew in possible LV accident|author=Sputnik|date=14 June 2005|publisher=|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kliper, as a vehicle alone, would have been primarily a manned spaceship, carrying six cosmonauts and payloads of up to 700 kilograms (mostly experiments and other equipment used for carrying through experiments in orbit) and was planned to stay in orbit for approximately 15 days independently and for up to 360 days if [[space rendezvous|docked]] to the International Space Station. This highlighted both the Russian/European and the American change in space transportation philosophy. Rather than focusing on the lifting of cargo and a crew, in the same way as the Space Shuttle or [[Shuttle Buran|Buran]], the Russian space agency adopted a 'people first' philosophy with the aim of 'bolting' extra capabilities for more advanced missions onto Kliper at a later date. Each orbiter was intended to make 25 flights prior to retirement.

===Using a space tug===
During autumn of 2005 Kliper's design was changed again. In order to fit the Kliper on the planned upgraded version of the Soyuz-2 rocket, labeled the Soyuz-2-3, Kliper would be 'split up' into two spacecraft, the Kliper crew vehicle and [[Parom]] (rus. ''"ferry"''), a space tug. Parom would have been a permanent orbital spacecraft awaiting Kliper in orbit, docking with it and then providing orbital manoeuvering and boosting Kliper to higher orbits in order to dock with the [[International Space Station]]. The Parom was planned to be indefinitely reusable, refueling itself via the cargo container, space station, or spacecraft that it is attached to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.russianspaceweb.com/kliper.html Kliper (Clipper) spacecraft&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2005/11/01/Navigation/200/202471/Lighter+Kliper+could+make+towed+trip+to+ISS.html Lighter Kliper could make towed trip to ISS-01/11/2005-Flight International&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final version of Energia's proposal===

The version of Kliper presented during the bid in January 2006 differs again from the original design. It showed a lifting body with larger wings, that, according to Energia officials, could be folded around the core crew module and unfold after atmospheric re-entry in order to provide cross-range and better landing accuracy for the spacecraft. The light Kliper version proposed was stripped down to 7 tons and uses the 'split-up'-option with Parom as a spacetug.

==Missions==

The Kliper program was proposed as the Russian-European counterpart to the American [[Orion (Constellation program)|Orion Spacecraft]] and was therefore designed (similar to the Orion) to be part of a modular system that enabled it to be both a [[Low Earth Orbit|LEO]]-shuttle type vehicle as well as part of a spacecraft able to go beyond Earth orbit to the Moon and even Mars (there were outline suggestions of lunar applications in September 2005).  The modular design would have included the Kliper crew module and - depending on the mission - a mission module or propulsion module. Although far-fetched, this corresponds to announcements by the [[Russian Space Agency]] that according to a lunar mission study, using the [[Soyuz spacecraft|Soyuz]], a landing on the Moon could be achieved within the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20051229144901/http://www.mosnews.com/news/2005/11/24/moon.shtml Mosnews.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Information on Kliper's beyond LEO mission capabilities were expanded further by RSC Energia, with a picture released in December 2005 of what a possible Kliper interplanetary configuration might have looked like. The design was entirely theoretical but made for a view of where [[RSC Energia]] saw the Kliper operating, and how it might have done so. This configuration was unlike anything seen so far for a manned space vehicle, with the solar arrays needed for electrical power vastly bigger than the habitable volume at the centre. It was also unclear what the mode of propulsion was. The very large solar array suggested an [[ion propulsion]] system might have been contemplated for such a mission, though it might also simply be that there was another reason for such a large array, such as increased power for better telemetry transmission rates over large distances.

==Carrier rockets==
The present [[Soyuz (rocket family)|Soyuz rocket]] would not be able to lift Kliper into low earth orbit, because the spacecraft (the version designed without Parom) was expected to weigh between 13 and 14.5 metric tons (with payload and crew) whereas Soyuz only has a lifting capacity of around 8 metric tons. It was originally planned to heavily enhance the Soyuz rocket - a project that was labelled the [[Onega rocket]] or Soyuz-3. Until fall of 2005 it was much more likely that Kliper would have used an [[Angara rocket|Angara-A3]] rocket, which was scheduled to make its first launch in 2012 (however the Angara program has been delayed and Angara-A3 may not be developed in light of the funding of the development of Soyuz 2-3) or possibly a [[Zenit rocket]] that is built in [[Ukraine]].

At the end of 2005, Kliper's design was changed again (as outlined above) and the most likely solution for a carrier rocket became the [[Soyuz 2-3]], an upgraded [[Soyuz-2 (rocket)|Soyuz 2]] rocket. This enhanced Soyuz should have been able to launch Kliper into space because of weight reduction resulting in the use of the [[Parom]] as a [[space tug]].&lt;ref name=FIN-Parom&gt;[http://www.flightinternational.com/Articles/2005/11/01/Navigation/200/202471/Lighter+Kliper+could+make+towed+trip+to+ISS.html Flight International]&lt;/ref&gt;

With regard to launch sites for Kliper, further information became available as of October 2005, with a planning-stage declaration from Nikolai Moiseev, Deputy Director of the Russian Space Agency that Kliper could have been launched from ESA's [[Guiana Space Centre]] in [[French Guiana]]. Though this aim had already been suggested, the comment was made in the context of facility upgrades for Kourou that are already under way since 2003 and are expected to be finished in 2007 with the first launch of a Soyuz rocket from French Guiana in 2008. It had been suggested that Kliper could have been launched from both [[Baikonur]] and [[Kourou]], by Alan Thirkettle, head of ESA's human spaceflight, microgravity and exploration directorate, in December 2005.&lt;ref name=FIN-Parom/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/051207_tech_wednesday.html|title=Russia's Next Spaceship: Alternative to NASA's CEV|work=Space.com|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Latvia}}

A '''constitutional referendum''' on the "Amendments to the [[Constitution of Latvia|Constitution of the Republic of Latvia]]"  was held on 18 February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.delfi.lv/news/national/politics/valodas-referendums-notiks-18februari.d?id=42026900|title=Valodas referendums notiks 18.februārī|publisher=Delfi.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed amendments included Articles 4, 18, 21, 101 and 104 of the Constitution of Latvia by adding the condition about [[Russian language|Russian]] as the second official language, as well as prescribing two working languages&amp;nbsp;— Latvian and Russian&amp;nbsp;— for self-government institutions.&lt;ref name="juridicainternational.eu"&gt;[http://www.juridicainternational.eu/index.php?id=15331 Jarinovska, Kristine. "Popular Initiatives as Means of Altering the Core of the Republic of Latvia", ''Juridica International''. Vol. 20, 2013.  p. 152], {{ISSN|1406-5509}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum's question was "Do you support the adoption of the Draft Law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia" that provides for the Russian language the status of the second official language?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cvk.lv/pub/public/28361.html |title=Referendum on the Draft Law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia" |publisher=Web.cvk.lv |date=2012-01-18 |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2000 census, Russian was the [[native language]] of 37.5% and the [[second language]] of 43.7% of the residents. Since 2000, Russian has been regarded as a foreign language according to the Official Language Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vvk.lv/index.php?sadala=134&amp;id=164 |title=Valsts valodas likums |publisher=Vvk.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In 2010, the [[National Alliance (Latvia)|National Alliance]] started to collect signatures to force a referendum on whether all publicly financed schools would have to use [[Latvian language|Latvian]] exclusively. By 9 June 2011, they had gathered 120,433 signatures of the minimum 153,232 signatures required, failing to force a referendum.

Protesting against the National Alliance initiative, on 15 February 2011, the youth movement "[[United Latvia]]" ({{lang-ru|Единая Латвия}}), led by Eduard Svatkov, announced the idea of making [[Russian language|Russian]] an official language, alongside Latvian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vienotalatvija.lv/lv/home/153.html |title=Vienota Latvija: Krievu valodai ir jābūt oficiālai valsts valodai |publisher=Vienotalatvija.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/02/16/44711142.html |title=Activitists want Russian to be Latvia"s 2nd state language: Voice of Russia |publisher=: |date=2011-02-16 |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 March 2011, "United Latvia", together with the newly created organisation "Mother Tongue" ({{lang-ru|Родной Язык}}), led by activist [[Vladimir Linderman]] (former leader of the Latvian branch of the Russian [[National Bolshevik Party]]), [[Yevgeny Osipov (politician)|Yevgeny Osipov]] (leader of "Osipov Party"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ves.lv/article/70511 |title="Партия Осипова" официально зарегистрирована|publisher=Ves.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aleksandr Gaponenko]] (director of the Institute of European Studies, economist), started to collect signatures for a [[initiative|referendum petition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vienotalatvija.lv/lv/home/155.html |title="Vienota Latvija" sāk parakstu vākšanu par krievu valodas nostiprināšanu Satversmē |publisher=Vienotalatvija.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vienotalatvija.lv/ru/home/155.html |title="Единая Латвия" начинает сбор подписей для закрепления русского языка в Сатверсме |publisher=Vienotalatvija.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They gathered 187,378 signatures, forcing a referendum.&lt;ref name="BT"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/30608/ |title=The voice of the people |publisher=[[The Baltic Times]] |date=2012-02-15 |accessdate=2012-02-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurotopics.net/en/home/presseschau/archiv/article/ARTICLE100367-Don-t-panic-at-Russian-referendum-in-Latvia |title=Don't panic at Russian referendum in Latvia |publisher=eurotopics.net, [[Bundeszentrale für politische Bildung]] |date=2012-02-09 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kp.ru/daily/25824.4/2800855/ |script-title=ru:Владимир Линдерман, инициатор референдума в Латвии: "Не врите, что русский язык был ввезен в Прибалтику на танках"|publisher=[[Komsomolskaya Pravda]] |date=2012-01-25 |accessdate=2012-02-16 |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referendum was held after the [[Saeima]] rejected the draft law "Amendments to the Constitution of the Republic of Latvia" supported by more than one-tenth of the voters during the Collection of signatures. At least half of the entire electorate has to vote Yes in the referendum in order for it to be valid (771,893).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvnet.lv/zinas/latvija/407778-referendums_notiks_18februari_visi_dodamies_balsot |title=Referendums notiks; 18.februārī visi dodamies balsot|publisher=Tvnet.lv|language=Latvian|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal scholars stated that beside statehood elements, the initiative would have influenced multiple basic human rights and general principles of law protected by the Constitution of Latvia, such as the right to preserve and develop the Latvian language and Latvian ethnic and cultural identity, to participate in the work of the state and of local government, and to hold a position in the civil service; the right to choose one’s employment and workplace freely; the right to education; the rights of a child; and the right to equality and non-discrimination, principles of proportionality, legal certainty, and legitimate expectations.&lt;ref name="juridicainternational.eu"/&gt;

The referendum organisers did not deny that the main achievement would be to show a large number of Russian language supporters and the final goal would be to change the status of Russian from foreign to some legal (i.e. regional) in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ves.lv/article/197269 |title=Линдерман: получение русским официального статуса и в интересах латышей тоже|publisher=Ves.lv |date= |accessdate=2012-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official status for Russian was requested due to the fact that the Constitution and Official Language Law do not have any other definitions for language status other than making a language official. Amendments for granting any other status for Russian (i.e. regional) would have had a higher risk of rejection by the [[Constitutional Court of Latvia|Constitutional Court]], thus cancelling the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasha.lv/rus/novosti/news/Interwie/46990.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Around three-quarters of voters voted against Russian as a second national language, with only the eastern region of [[Latgale]] seeing a majority of citizens voting for the change. The referendum had considerably higher voter participation than in previous elections and referendums, with more than 71.1% of registered voters casting ballots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tn2012.cvk.lv/report-results.html Provisional results of the referendum] Retrieved 2012-02-19. (in Latvian)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
A large part of the Russian speaking community in Latvia (290,660 or 14.1% of Latvia's entire population) could not vote in this referendum because, since 1991, they have held [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizen]] status and thus have no right to vote. However, the above numbers also show that non-citizens could not have changed the result of the referendum if they had been allowed to vote. If all 290,660 members of the Russian community had participated and voted in favor of the motion, the proposal would still have been rejected with 59.15% against and 40.60% in favor, with turnout increasing to 75.68% from 71.11%.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==Analysis==
Analysts say the turnout, at nearly 70 percent, indicates the strength of feeling among many ordinary Latvians, who are keen to distance themselves culturally from their former Soviet rulers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euronews.net/2012/02/19/latvians-say-no-in-russian-language-vote Latvians say “no” in Russian language vote] www.euronews.net. Retrieved 2012-02-19.&lt;/ref&gt; The referendum can widen the schism in society and the government will have to undertake serious efforts to consolidate the country's two groups. Though the Russians who spearheaded the referendum admitted they had no chance at winning the plebiscite, they at least hope the approximate 25 percent of support will force Latvia's center-right government to begin a dialogue with national minorities. Many fear the disgruntled minority will keep up the pressure by calling for more referendums to change Latvia's constitution for minorities' benefit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/18/latvia-russian-language_n_1286544.html?ref=world Latvia Russian Language Referendum Has High Turnout] The Huffington Post.

Several [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]] scripts have been used by [[Maldivians]] during [[History of the Maldives|their history]]. The early Dhivehi scripts fell into the [[abugida]] category, while the more recent Taana has characteristics of both an abugida and a true alphabet. An ancient form of [[Nagari script]], as well as the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Latin script|Latin]] scripts, have also been extensively used in the Maldives, but with a more restricted function. Latin was official only during a very brief period of the [[Maldives|Islands']] history.

The language of the [[Maldives]] has had its very own script since very ancient times. It is likely that the first Dhivehi script appeared in association with the expansion of Buddhism throughout South Asia. This was over two millennia ago, in the [[Mauryan]] period, during emperor [[Ashoka]]'s time. Manuscripts used by Maldivian Buddhist monks were probably written in a script that slowly evolved into a characteristic Dhivehi form. None of those ancient documents have been discovered yet and the early forms of the Maldivian script are only found etched on a few coral rocks and copper plates.

==Ancient scripts (Evēla Akuru)==
{{See also|Dhivehi language|History of the Maldives}}

[[Image:Div ak01.PNG|thumb|right|The most ancient Dhivehi script]]
''Divehi Akuru'' "island letters" is a script formerly used to write the Dhivehi language. Unlike the modern Thaana script, Divehi Akuru has its origins in the [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]] script and thus was written from left to right.

Divehi Akuru was separated into two variants, a more recent and an ancient one and christened "Dives Akuru" and "Evēla Akuru" respectively by [[Harry Charles Purvis Bell]] in the early 20th century. Bell was [[United Kingdom|British]] and studied Maldivian [[epigraphy]] when he retired from the colonial government service in [[Colombo]].

Bell wrote a monograph on the archaeology, history and epigraphy of the Maldives. He was the first modern scholar to study these ancient writings and he undertook an extensive and serious research on the available epigraphy. The division that Bell made based on the differences he perceived between the two types of Dhivehi scripts is convenient for the study of old Dhivehi documents.

The Divehi Akuru developed from the [[Grantha alphabet]]. The letters on old inscriptions resemble the southern Grantha of the [[Pallava dynasty]] and [[Chola dynasty]] periods of [[South India]]. However, this does not mean that the Maldives were dependent on those kingdoms, for the Maldives have been an independent nation for practically all their history. There has been very little interference, cultural or otherwise, from other neighboring kingdoms in South India and [[Sri Lanka]].

The early form of this script was also called Divehi Akuru by Maldivians, but it was renamed Evēla Akuru "ancient letters" in a tentative manner by H. C. P. Bell in order to distinguish it from the more recent variants of the same script. This name became established and so the most ancient form of the Maldive script is now known as Evēla Akuru. The ancient name of the Evēla Akuru was ''Dīvī Grantha''. This is the script that evolved at the time when the Maldives was an independent kingdom and it was still in use one century after the conversion to [[Islam]].
  
[[Image:Standard indic table8.PNG|thumb|right|Standard Indic ([[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST]]). This table is provided as a reference for the position of the letters on all the tables.]]

Evēla can be seen in the [[Lōmāfānu]] (copper plate grants) of the 12th and 13th centuries and in inscriptions on coral stone (hirigā) dating back from the Maldive Buddhist period. Two of the few copper plate documents that have been preserved are from [[Haddhunmathi Atoll]].

The oldest inscription found in the Maldives to date is an inscription on a [[coral]] stone found at an archaeological site on [[Landhoo (Noonu Atoll)|Landhū Island]] in [[Southern Miladhunmadulu Atoll]], where there are important Buddhist archaeological remains including a large [[stupa]]. The Landhū inscription is estimated to be from the 8th century A.D. Even though long before that time Maldivian Buddhist monks had been writing and reading manuscripts in their language, older documents have not yet been discovered yet.

The reason why even at that time the local script was known as "Divehi Akuru" by Maldivians was because another non-Maldivian script was used in the country. This was a [[Devanagari]] script related to the form used by [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and it had a ceremonial value. The oldest paleographically-datable inscription found in the Maldives is a [[Prakrit]] inscription of [[Vajrayana]] [[Buddhism]] dating back to the 9th or 10th century AD. This inscription is written in an early form of the Nagari script. Thus the name "Divehi Akuru" was used historically by Maldivians to distinguish their own writing system from foreign scripts. Foreign scripts were learned and introduced at that time when Maldivian monks visited the Buddhist learning centers of [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramashila]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Xavier Romero-Frias]], ''The Maldive Islanders, A Study of the Popular Culture of an Ancient Ocean Kingdom'', Barcelona 1999, {{ISBN|84-7254-801-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later Dhivehi or ''Dhives Akuru''==
{{main|Dhives Akuru}}
[[Image:Div ak02.PNG|thumb|right|The last version of the Dhivehi script used after the conversion to Islam]]

Among the ''Divehi Akuru'' scripts, the later form of the Dhivehi script was the script that evolved from the ancient Dhivehi script or Evēla Akuru after the conversion of the Maldives to [[Islam in the Maldives|Islam]]. It was still used in some atolls in the South Maldives as the main script until around 70 years ago. Since then it is rarely used, not even having a ceremonial role in scrolls of [[coats-of-arms]] or badges of government entities and associations, where [[Arabic]] is favoured.

This script can be found on gravestones, old grants in paper and wood, and in some monuments, including the stone base of the pillars supporting the main structure of the ancient Friday Mosque in [[Malé]]. 
British researcher H. C. P. Bell obtained an astrology book written in Divehi Akuru in [[Addu Atoll]], in the south of Maldives, during one of his trips. This book is now kept in the National Archives of [[Sri Lanka]] in Colombo.

Apparently, the Dhivehi script was abandoned in other parts of the [[Maldives]] in favour of the modern Thaana script about 200 years earlier, perhaps at the beginning of the 18th century. Some modern Dhivehi historians want to believe that the Thaana script was introduced a few centuries before that. But the claim that the Thaana letters were devised in the 16th century is not supported by historical documents, for the oldest writing specimens in the Thaana script, interspersed with Arabic, are from the 18th century.

==The modern script==
{{main|Thaana}}
[[Image:Tana table b.PNG|thumb|right|Thaana, the contemporary official Dhivehi script]]

[[Thaana]] is the first Dhivehi script written from right to left. It was inspired by numbers. It uses numerals as consonants and adds the diacritical (vowel) marks of the Arabic language.

The first Thaana manuscripts are written in a crude early version of this script called Gabulhi Thaana (incipient Thaana), where the Arabic numerals have not yet been slanted 45 degrees and still look like numbers. Since no ancient writings in Thaana written before the 18th century have been found, it is doubtful that this script could be much older.

The main reason why the Divehi Akuru were abandoned in favour of the Thaana script was owing to the need the learned Maldivians had to include words and sentences in Arabic while writing in the [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]] language.

The most intriguing fact about the Thaana alphabet is its order (hā, shaviyani, nūnu, rā, bā, etc.). Its sequence does not follow the ancient order of the other [[Indic scripts]] (like [[Sinhala alphabet|Sinhala]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]]) or the order of the [[Arabic alphabet]]. In fact, the order of the Thaana alphabet has no logic at all. This points to a likely esoteric origin of Thaana, namely to a script that was scrambled on purpose in order to keep it secret from average islanders. At their origin the Thaana characters, which are based on Arabic numerals and other symbols, were used in ''fandita'' (local magic or sorcery) to write magical spells. Many of these arcane incantations included Arabic quotations, which were written from right to left. Maldivian learned men, who were all well versed in sorcery, eventually saw the advantages of writing in this simplified hidden script. Hence, with the passing of time, Thaana came out of the shadows and was gradually adopted for everyday use.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

This script is currently in use as the sole Dhivehi writing system. While at their origin documents written in Thaana were full of Arabic words and quotations, the tendency is now to include as little Arabic script as possible, especially since special Thaana letters with dots were introduced to replace Arabic letters. The Thaana script is widely used nowadays by Maldivians both in official and unofficial documents, for the literacy rate of the Maldive society is very high by South Asian standards.

===Abolishment of the letter naviyani===
The letter [[naviyani]] '''ޱ''', representing the retroflex nasal]] {{IPA|/ɳ/}} sound common to all Indic languages ([[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Hindi]], etc.), was abolished from official documents in 1950 by Muhammad Amin, the ruler of Maldives. The reason why this particular retroflex sound was abolished and not others like Lhaviyani, Daviyani or Taviyani is not known.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Letter Naviyani's former position in the Thaana alphabet was the nineteenth, between letters Daviyani and Zaviyani. It is still seen in reprints of traditional old books like the Bodu Tartheebu. It is also used by people of [[Addu Atoll|Addu]] and [[Fuvahmulah]] when writing songs or poetry in their language variants.

===The letter ''Shaviyani''===
Letter [[Sha viyani|Shaviyani]] ('''ށ''') is the second letter of the [[Thaana alphabet]]. It represents the [[voiceless retroflex fricative]] {{IPA|[ʂ]}}, and is only found at the ends of words.

==The ''Divehi Akuru'' book==
In 1959, during Sultan Mohammed Farid’s reign, former Prime Minister (and later President) [[Ibrahim Nasir]] expressed a wish to have a book written about the former Dhivehi script which by that time was largely ignored by Maldivians. Thus, he contacted As-Sayyid [[Bodufenvalhuge Sidi]], an eminent Maldivian scholar, who swiftly obliged. 
[[Image:Div Akuru F21.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Cover of the "Divehi Akuru" book written by Bodufenvalhuge Sidi]]
By means of this small book Bodufenvalhuge Sidi (1888–1970) wanted to clearly show the fact that in ancient times Maldivians were writing from left to right in their own script. Hence ''Divehi Akuru'' is perhaps the only book ever written in Thaana that opens from the left side.

As-Sayyid Bodufenvalhuge Sidi was one of the very few Maldivian people of modern times who understood the now-forgotten ancient Dhivehi letters in which parts of royal grants, warrants and deeds were written. He learnt this ancient script in [[Addu Atoll]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Until early in the twentieth century, all government correspondence to and from Addu Atoll was written using these ancient Dhivehi letters.
 
The last chapter of this book shows a text where the Divehi Akuru are coming along with Arabic script. As the reader acquainted with Dhivehi writing can see, this book is Volume 1 (evvana bai). Perhaps Bodufenvalhuge Sidi had the intention of publishing a second, or perhaps even a third volume on the subject. But he died before being able to do so.

Even though H. C. P. Bell undertook very careful and thorough research on the Dhivehi documents, Prime Minister [[Ibrahim Nasir]]'s intention was to have a book on the ancient script of the Maldives written by a Maldivian. Prime Minister Nasir's request to Bodufenvalhuge Sidi was done in order to clarify Bell's misinterpretations, no matter how few. A staunch Maldivian nationalist, Nasir took this issue as a matter of national pride.

Present day members of Maldivian cultural institutions are aware of the lacunae in Bell's research and of Bodufenvalhuge Sidi's valuable contribution to mend matters, but little has been done to correct those inaccuracies. Still, Bell's broad and valuable contributions to the study of the Dhivehi language and scripts should not be underestimated.

==Latin transliteration==
Towards the mid 1970s, during President [[Ibrahim Nasir]]'s tenure, [[Telegraphy|Telex]] machines were introduced by the Maldivian Government in the local administration. The new telex equipment was viewed as a great progress, however the local Thaana script was deemed to be an obstacle because messages on the [[Teleprinter|telex machines]] could only be written in the [[Malé Latin|Latin script]].
Following this, ''Dhivehi Letin'', an official Latin transliteration, was swiftly approved by the Maldivian government in 1976 and was quickly implemented by the administration. Booklets were printed and dispatched to all Atoll and Island Offices, as well as schools and merchant liners. This was seen by many as the demise of the Thaana script.

Clarence Maloney, the American anthropologist who was in the Maldives at the time of the change, lamented the crude inconsistencies of ''Dhivehi Letin'' and wondered why the modern [[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|IAST Standard Indic]] transliteration had not been considered. Standard Indic is a consistent script system that is well adapted to writing practically all languages of South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Clarence Maloney; People of the Maldive Islands&lt;/ref&gt;

The Thaana script was reinstated by President [[Maumoon Abdul Gayoom]] shortly after he took power in 1978. There was widespread relief in certain places, especially rural areas, where the introduction of Latin had been regarded as a preliminary to the introduction of infidel mores. However, the substandard Latin transcription of 1976 continues to be widely used.

== Devanagari script for Mahl ==
[[Image:Mahldevanagari.png|thumb|300px|Devanagari script for Mahal]]
Although the Mahl dialect of the Dhivehi language spoken in the island of [[Minicoy]] in [[Lakshadweep|Union territory of Lakshadweep]], [[India]] is also written mainly using the [[Thaana]] alphabet, in the 1950s a Devanagari script was modified to write the Maldivian dialect.

{{Manipulative methods}}

'''Manual therapy''', or '''manipulative therapy''', is a physical treatment primarily used by [[physical therapist]]s, [[physiotherapist]]s, [[occupational therapist]]s, [[chiropractor]]s, [[massage therapist]]s, [[athletic trainer]]s, [[osteopath]]s, and [[Osteopathic medicine in the United States| physicians]] to treat musculoskeletal pain and disability; it most  includes kneading and manipulation of muscles, [[joint mobilization]] and [[joint manipulation]].&lt;ref name=French1&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=French HP, Brennan A, White B, Cusack T |title=Manual therapy for osteoarthritis of the hip or knee - a systematic review |journal=Manual Therapy |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=109–17 |year=2010 |month= |pmid=21146444 |pmc= |doi=10.1016/j.math.2010.10.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Soft Tissue Sports Massage|url=http://www.thetreatmenttable.com/treatments/deep-soft-tissue-massage/|website=The Treatment Table|publisher=The Treatment Table|accessdate=2016-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 literature review indicates that placebo is one of likely many potentially relevant mechanisms through which manual therapy improves clinical outcomes related to musculoskeletal pain conditions.&lt;ref name="pmid22294849"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Bialosky JE, Bishop MD, George SZ, Robinson ME| title=Placebo response to manual therapy: something out of nothing? | journal=J Man Manip Ther | year= 2011 | volume= 19 | issue= 1 | pages= 11-9 | pmid=22294849 | doi=10.1179/2042618610Y.0000000001 | pmc=3172952 | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=22294849  }} &lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapy Description of Advanced Specialty Practice'' manual therapy is defined as a clinical approach utilizing specific hands-on techniques, including but not limited to manipulation/mobilization, used by the physical therapist to diagnose and treat soft tissues and joint structures for the purpose of modulating pain; increasing range of motion (ROM); reducing or eliminating soft tissue inflammation; inducing relaxation; improving contractile and non-contractile tissue repair, extensibility, and/or stability; facilitating movement; and improving function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapy Description of Advanced Specialty Practice |url=https://aaompt.org/aaompt_data/documents/AAOMPT_2008_MT_DASP_FINAL.pdf |website=aaompt.org |publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Manual Physical Therapists |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A consensus study of US chiropractors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gatterman MI, Hansen DT | title = Development of chiropractic nomenclature through consensus | journal = J Manipulative Physiological Therapeutics | volume = 17 | issue = 5 | pages = 302–309 | year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined manual therapy (generally known as the "chiropractic adjustment" in the profession) as "Procedures by which the hands directly contact the body to treat the articulations and/or soft tissues."

== Use and method ==

In [[Western Europe]], [[North America]] and [[Australasia]], manual therapy is usually practiced by members of specific health care professions (e.g. [[Chiropractor]]s, Occupational Therapists, [[Osteopath]]s, [[Osteopathic physician]]s, [[Physiotherapist]]s/Physical Therapists, Massage Therapists and [[Physiatrist]]s).&lt;ref name="French1"/&gt; However, some lay practitioners (not members of a structured profession), such as [[bonesetters]] also provide some forms of manual therapy.

A survey released in May 2004 by the [[National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health]] focused on who used [[:category:alternative medicine|complementary and alternative medicine]] (CAM), what was used, and why it was used in the United States by adults during 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=More Than One-Third of U.S. Adults Use Complementary and Alternative Medicine, According to New Government Survey|url=http://nccih.nih.gov/news/2004/052704.htm|work=National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health|publisher=National Institute for Health|accessdate=11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massage was the fifth most commonly use CAM in the [[United States]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Most Common CAM Therapies Among Adults - 2007 |url=https://nccih.nih.gov/research/statistics/2007/most-common-cam-therapies-among-adults |website=nccih.nih.gov |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Techniques ===

* [[Myofascial]] Therapy targets the muscle and fascial systems, promotes flexibility and mobility of the body's connective tissues. It is said to mobilize adhesions and reduce severity/sensitivity of scarring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paul van den Dolder, Paulo Ferreira, and Kathryn Refshauge|title=Is soft tissue massage an effective treatment for mechanical shoulder pain? A study protocol|pmc=3103116|website=National Institutes of Health|publisher=US National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; A critical analysis finds that the relevance of fascia to therapy doubtful.&lt;ref name=fascia&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ingraham |first1=Paul |title=Does Fascia Matter? |url=https://www.painscience.com/articles/does-fascia-matter.php |website=painscience.com |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Massage]] may be used as part of a treatment. Proponents claim this may reduce inflammation. Science writer Paul Ingraham notes that there is no evidence to support the claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ingraham |first1=Paul |title=Massage does not reduce inflammation and promote mitochondria |url=https://www.painscience.com/articles/research-crane.php |website=painscience.com |accessdate=12 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Friction massage is said to increase mobilization of adhesions between fascial layers, muscles, compartments and other soft tissues. They are thought to create an inflammatory response and instigate focus to injured areas. A 2012 systematic review found that no additional benefit was incurred from the inclusion of deep tissue friction massage in a therapeutic regime, although the conclusions were limited by the small sample sizes in available randomized clinical trials.&lt;ref name="Brosseau Casimiro Milne Welch p. "&gt;{{cite | last=Brosseau | first=Lucie | last2=Casimiro | first2=Lynn | last3=Milne | first3=Sarah | last4=Welch | first4=Vivian | last5=Shea | first5=Beverley | last6=Tugwell | first6=Peter | last7=Wells | first7=George A | editor-last=Brosseau | editor-first=Lucie | title=Deep transverse friction massage for treating tendinitis | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd | publication-place=Chichester, UK | date=21 October 2002 | doi=10.1002/14651858.cd003528 | page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Soft Tissue Technique]] is firm, direct pressure to relax hypertonic muscles and stretch tight fascial structures. A 2015 review concluded that the Technique is ineffective for [[Low back pain|lower back pain]], and the quality of research testing its effectiveness is poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Muscle energy technique for non-specific low-back pain |vauthors=Franke H, Fryer G, Ostelo R, Kamper S |journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD009852.pub2 |url=http://cochranelibrary-wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009852.pub2/full}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Trigger Point techniques claim to address [[Myofascial]] [[Trigger points]], though the explanation of how this works is controversial&lt;ref name=fascia/&gt; and reviews in 2008 and 2009 call into question whether trigger points are a valid diagnosis at all given the small amounts of poor quality evidence available.&lt;ref name="pmid19158550"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Lucas N, Macaskill P, Irwig L, Moran R, Bogduk N| title=Reliability of physical examination for diagnosis of myofascial trigger points: a systematic review of the literature. | journal=Clin J Pain | year= 2009 | volume= 25 | issue= 1 | pages= 80-9 | pmid=19158550 | doi=10.1097/AJP.0b013e31817e13b6 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=19158550  }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18503816"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Myburgh C, Larsen AH, Hartvigsen J| title=A systematic, critical review of manual palpation for identifying myofascial trigger points: evidence and clinical significance. | journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil | year= 2008 | volume= 89 | issue= 6 | pages= 1169-76 | pmid=18503816 | doi=10.1016/j.apmr.2007.12.033 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=18503816  }} &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stretching ===
{{Main|Stretching}}

From the main article's effectiveness section:
*[[evidence-based medicine|Medical evidence]] has shown stretching has no meaningful benefit in preventing muscle soreness.&lt;ref name=coch&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Herbert RD, de Noronha M, Kamper SJ |title=Stretching to prevent or reduce muscle soreness after exercise |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume= |issue=7 |pages=CD004577 |year=2011 |pmid=21735398 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004577.pub3 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Apart from before running, stretching does not appear to reduce risk of injury during exercise.&lt;ref name=behm&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Behm DG, Blazevich AJ, Kay AD, McHugh M |title=Acute effects of muscle stretching on physical performance, range of motion, and injury incidence in healthy active individuals: a systematic review |journal=Appl Physiol Nutr Metab |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=1–11 |year=2016 |pmid=26642915 |doi=10.1139/apnm-2015-0235 |type=Systematic review}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some evidence shows that pre-exercise stretching may increase range of movement.&lt;ref name=behm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Current concepts in muscle stretching for exercise and rehabilitation |journal=International Journal of Sports Physical Therapy | pmc=3273886 | pmid=22319684 |volume=7 |year=2012 |pages=109–19 |author=Page P}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Mayo Clinic]] advises against bouncing, and to hold for thirty seconds. They suggest warming up before stretching or stretching post-exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/stretching/art-20047931|title=Stretching is not a warm up! Find out why|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Taping ===
{{Main|Elastic therapeutic tape}}

Manual therapy practitioners often use therapeutic taping to relieve pressure on injured soft tissue, alter muscle firing patterns or prevent re-injury.  Some techniques are designed to enhance [[lymphatic fluid]] exchange. After a soft tissue injury to muscles or tendons from sports activities, over exertion or [[repetitive strain injury]] swelling may impede blood flood to the area and slow healing.  Elastic taping methods may relieve pressure from swollen tissue and enhance circulation to the injured area.

According to the [[medical]] and [[skeptical]] community there is no known benefit from this technique and it is a [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name=SBM2012&gt;{{cite web|last1=Novella|first1=Steven|authorlink1=Steven Novella|title=Olympic Pseudoscience|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/olympic-pseudoscience/|website=Sciencebasedmedicine.org|publisher=Science-Based Medicine|accessdate=13 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312234517/https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/olympic-pseudoscience/|archivedate=13 March 2018|date=25 July 2012|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SBM2018&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Clay|title=A Miscellany of Medical Malarkey Episode 3: The Revengening|url=https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-miscellany-of-medical-malarkey-episode-3-the-revengening/|website=ScienceBasedMedicine.org|publisher=Science-Based Medicine|accessdate=13 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313003054/https://sciencebasedmedicine.org/a-miscellany-of-medical-malarkey-episode-3-the-revengening/|archivedate=13 March 2018|date=9 March 2018|dead-url=no}}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WebMD&gt;{{cite web|title=Kinesio Tape for Athletes: A Big Help, or Hype?|url=https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/kinesio-tape-athletes-help-hype#1|website=WebMD.com|publisher=Web MD|accessdate=13 March 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312235007/https://www.webmd.com/fitness-exercise/features/kinesio-tape-athletes-help-hype#1|archivedate=13 March 2018||dead-url=no}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Styles of manual therapy ==

There are many different styles of manual therapy. It is a fundamental feature of [[ayurvedic]] medicine, [[traditional Chinese medicine]] and some forms of [[New Age]] [[alternative medicine]] as well as being used by mainstream medical practitioners. Hands-on bodywork is a feature of therapeutic interactions in traditional cultures around the world.

In India, Tamil traditional Medicinal system is present since centuries ago called "Siddha Maruthuvam"("Siddha Medicine").
In Siddha system of medicine, "Thokkanam and Varmam" are the external therapeutic modalities.It is present in the medical syllabus of siddha medicine which is now followed by syllabus committee members in The Tamilnadu Dr. M. G. R. Medical university, Guindy, Tamilnadu.People should be aware of the Siddha system which offers manual therapy too.

The '''map–territory relation''' describes the relationship between an object and a representation of that [[Object (philosophy)|object]], as in the relation between a geographical territory and a [[map]] of it. Polish-American scientist and philosopher [[Alfred Korzybski]] remarked that "the map is not the territory" and that "the word is not the thing", encapsulating his view that an [[abstraction]] derived from something, or a reaction to it, is not the thing itself. Korzybski held that many people do confuse maps with territories, that is, confuse [[conceptual model|models]] of reality with reality itself.  The relationship has also been expressed in other terms, such as [[Alan Watts]]'s "The menu is not the meal."

=="A map is not the territory"==
The expression first appeared in print in "A Non-Aristotelian System and its Necessity for Rigour in Mathematics and Physics", a paper that Alfred Korzybski gave at a meeting of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] in [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] on December 28, 1931. The paper was reprinted in ''Science and Sanity'', 1933, pp. 747–61.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Korzybski |first=Alfred |authorlink=Alfred Korzybski |title=Science and Sanity.

The Belgian [[surrealist]] artist [[René Magritte]] illustrated the concept of "perception always intercedes between reality and ourselves"&lt;ref&gt;Rene Magritte's surrealism to be to illustrate the point that, "perception always intercedes between reality and ourselves". See for example, p.&amp;nbsp;15-16 [https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;vid=ISBN0791434354&amp;id=ZiTpRxkTMwUC&amp;vq=korzybski&amp;dq=Korzybski%2BMagritte&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;pg=PA16&amp;sig=hZWrqDZMqGm7tKpdQfkhM-rCOQY Visual Intelligence: Perception, Image, and Manipulation in Visual Communication] by Ann Marie Barry ([http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/communication/faculty/fulltime/barry/ bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051129012811/http://www.bc.edu/schools/cas/communication/faculty/fulltime/barry/ |date=2005-11-29 }})&lt;/ref&gt; in a number of paintings including a famous work entitled ''[[The Treachery of Images]]'', which consists of a drawing of a pipe with the caption, ''Ceci n'est pas une pipe'' ("This is not a pipe").

In ''[[The Medium Is the Message]]'', [[Marshall McLuhan]] expanded this argument to electronic media.  Media representations, especially on screens, are abstractions, or virtual "extensions" of what our sensory channels, bodies, thinking and feeling do for us in real life.

This concept occurs in the discussion of exoteric and esoteric [[religion]]s. [[Exoteric]] concepts are concepts which can be fully conveyed using [[Epithet|descriptors]] and [[language]] constructs, such as [[mathematics]]. [[Esoteric]] concepts are concepts which cannot be fully conveyed except by direct experience. For example, a person who has never tasted an [[apple]] will never fully understand through language what the taste of an apple is. Only through direct experience (eating an apple) can that experience be fully understood.

[[Lewis Carroll]], in ''[[Sylvie and Bruno Concluded]]'' (1893), made the point humorously with his description of a fictional map that had "the scale of a mile to the mile". A character notes some practical difficulties with such a map and states that "we now use the [[country]] itself, as its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well."

[[Jorge Luis Borges]]'s one-paragraph short story "[[On Exactitude in Science]]" (1946) also describes a map that has the same scale as its territory, here an entire empire where cartography has become exactingly precise.

[[Laura Riding]], in her poem ''The Map of Places'' (1927), deals with this relation: "The map of places passes. The reality of paper tears."

The [[University of Cambridge]] economist [[Joan Robinson]] (1962) emphasized the disutility of 1:1 maps and other overly detailed models: "A model which took account of all the variation of reality would be of no more use than a map at the scale of one to one."

Korzybski's argument about the map and the territory also influenced the Belgian [[surrealist]] writer of comics [[Jan Bucquoy]] for a storyline in his comic ''Labyrinthe'': a map can never guarantee that one will find the way out, because the accumulation of events can change the way one looks at reality.

Historian of religions [[Jonathan Z. Smith|J. Z. Smith]] wrote a book entitled ''Map Is not Territory: Studies in the History of Religions'' (1978, [[University of Chicago Press]] 1993 paperback: {{ISBN|0-226-76357-9}}).

Author [[Robert M. Pirsig]] uses the idea both theoretically and literally in his book ''[[Lila: An Inquiry into Morals|Lila]]'' when the main character/author becomes temporarily lost due to an over reliance on a map, rather than the territory that the map describes.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M Pirsig ''Lila: An Inquiry into Morals'' (1991, pp.&amp;nbsp;363-364)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, French author [[Michel Houellebecq]] published his novel, ''La carte et le territoire'', translated into English as ''[[The Map and the Territory]]''. The title was a reference to Alfred Korzybski's [[aphorism]]. The novel was awarded the French literary prize, the [[Prix Goncourt]].

[[Robert Anton Wilson]], in his book ''[[Prometheus Rising]]'', also makes this point about the map not being reality. He explicitly attempts to explain this important principle to the reader.

The mathematician James A. Lindsay made the idea that the map is not reality a primary theme of his 2013 book ''Dot, Dot, Dot: Infinity Plus God Equals Folly''. In it, he argues that all of our scientific theories, mathematics, and even the idea of God are conceptual maps often confused "for the terrain" they attempt to explain. In a foreword to the book, physicist [[Victor J. Stenger]] expresses agreement with this point of view.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay, James A. (2013). ''Dot, Dot, Dot: Infinity Plus God Equals Folly'', Fareham: Onus Books&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Ugly Duckling Presse published a book of poetry by Marília Garcia called ''The Territory Is Not the Map'', translated from the Portuguese (''O país não é o mapa'') by Hilary Kaplan. 

[[Yuval Noah Harari]]'s 2018 book, [[21 Lessons for the 21st Century]], has a description of people following directions from their navigation software and driving into the ocean.   

==Relationship==
[[Gregory Bateson]], in "Form, Substance and Difference", from ''[[Steps to an Ecology of Mind]]'' (1972), argued the essential impossibility of knowing what any actual territory is.  Any understanding of any territory is based on one or more sensory channels reporting adequately but imperfectly:

{{quote|We say the map is different from the territory. But what is the territory? Operationally, somebody went out with a retina or a measuring stick and made representations which were then put on paper. What is on the paper map is a representation of what was in the retinal representation of the man who made the map; and as you push the question back, what you find is an infinite regress, an infinite series of maps. The territory never gets in at all. […] Always, the process of representation will filter it out so that the mental world is only maps of maps, ''[[ad infinitum]]''.}}

Elsewhere in that same volume, Bateson argued that the usefulness of a map (a representation of reality) is not necessarily a matter of its literal truthfulness, but its having a [[structure]] analogous, for the purpose at hand, to the territory. Bateson argued this case at some length in the essay ''The Theology of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]''.

To paraphrase Bateson's argument, a culture that believes that [[common colds]] are transmitted by evil spirits, that those spirits fly out of you when you sneeze, can pass from one person to another when they are inhaled or when both handle the same objects, etc., could have just as effective a "map" for public health as one that substituted microbes for spirits.

Another basic quandary is the problem of [[accuracy]]. Jorge Luis Borges' "On Exactitude in Science" describes the tragic uselessness of the perfectly accurate, one-to-one map:

{{quote|In time, those Unconscionable Maps no longer satisfied, and the Cartographers Guild drew a Map of the Empire whose size was that of the Empire, coinciding point for point with it. The following Generations, who were not so fond of the Study of Cartography saw the vast Map to be Useless and permitted it to decay and fray under the Sun and winters.

In the Deserts of the West, still today, there are Tattered Ruins of the Map, inhabited by Animals and Beggars; and in all the Land there is no other Relic of the Disciplines of Geography.}}

A more extreme literary example, the fictional [[Paradoxes of set theory#The diary of Tristram Shandy|diary of Tristram Shandy]] is so detailed that it takes the author one ''year'' to set down the events of a single ''day'' – because the map (diary) is more detailed than the territory (life), yet must fit into the territory (diary written in the course of his life), it can never be finished. Such tasks are referred to as [[supertask]]s.

With this  quotation of Josiah Royce, Borges describes a further conundrum of when the map is contained within the territory, you are led into [[infinite regress]]:

{{quote
|text=The inventions of philosophy are no less fantastic than those of art: [[Josiah Royce]], in the first volume of his work ''The World and the Individual'' (1899), has formulated the following: 'Let us imagine that a portion of the soil of England has been levelled off perfectly and that on it a cartographer traces a map of England. The job is perfect; there is no detail of the soil of England, no matter how minute, that is not registered on the map; everything has there its correspondence. This map, in such a case, should contain a map of the map, which should contain a map of the map of the map, and so on to infinity.' Why does it disturb us that the map be included in the map and the thousand and one nights in the book of the ''Thousand and One Nights''? Why does it disturb us that Don Quixote be a reader of the ''Quixote'' and Hamlet a spectator of ''Hamlet''? I believe I have found the reason: these inversions suggest that if the characters of a fictional work can be readers or spectators, we, its readers or spectators, can be fictions.
|author=Jorge Luis Borges
|source=''[[Partial Enchantments of the Quixote]]'' (1964)}}

[[Neil Gaiman]] retells the parable in reference to [[storytelling]] in ''[[Fragile Things]]'' (it was originally to appear in ''[[American Gods]]''):

{{quote|One describes a tale best by telling the tale. You see? The way one describes a story, to oneself or the world, is by telling the story. It is a balancing act and it is a dream. The more accurate the map, the more it resembles the territory. The most accurate map possible would be the territory, and thus would be perfectly accurate and perfectly useless. The tale is the map that is the territory.}}

The development of electronic media blurs the line between map and territory by allowing for the [[simulation]] of ideas as encoded in electronic signals, as [[Baudrillard]] argues in ''[[Simulacra and Simulation]]'' (1994, p.&amp;nbsp;1):

{{quote|Today abstraction is no longer that of the map, the double, the mirror, or the concept. Simulation is no longer that of a territory, a referential being or substance. It is the generation by models of a real without origin or reality: A [[Hyperreality|hyperreal]]. The territory no longer precedes the map, nor does it survive it. It is nevertheless the map that precedes the territory—precession of simulacra—that engenders the territory.}}

The philosopher [[David Schmidtz]] draws on this distinction in his book ''Elements of Justice'', apparently deriving it from [[Wittgenstein]]'s [[private language argument]].

The fundamental trade-off between accuracy and usability of a map, particularly in the context of modelling, is known as [[Bonini's paradox]], and has been stated in various forms, poetically by [[Paul Valéry]]: "Everything simple is false. Everything which is complex is unusable."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4064">In philosophy, '''metaphysical necessity''', sometimes called '''broad logical necessity''',&lt;ref&gt;Brian Leftow, ''God and Necessity'' (2012). {{ISBN|0191654876}}, 9780191654879&lt;/ref&gt; is one of many different kinds of [[wikt:necessity|necessity]], which sits between logical necessity and nomological (or physical) necessity, in the sense that logical necessity entails metaphysical necessity, but not vice versa, and metaphysical necessity entails physical necessity, but not vice versa.  A [[proposition]] is said to be ''necessary'' if it could not have failed to be the case.  Nomological necessity is necessity according to the laws of physics and logical necessity is necessity according to the laws of logic, while metaphysical necessities are necessary in the sense that the world could not possibly have been otherwise.  What facts are metaphysically necessary, and on what basis we might view certain facts as metaphysically but not logically necessary are subjects of substantial discussion in contemporary philosophy.

The concept of a metaphysically necessary being plays an important role in certain arguments for the existence of God, especially the [[ontological argument]], but metaphysical necessity is also one of the central concepts in late 20th century [[analytic philosophy]].  Metaphysical necessity has proved a controversial concept, and criticized by [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[J. L. Mackie]], and [[Richard Swinburne]], among others.

Metaphysical necessity is contrasted with other types of necessity.  For example, the philosophers of religion [[John Hick]]&lt;ref&gt;John Hick (1961): Necessary Being. - ''Scottish Journal of Theology'', 1961: 353-369.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[William L. Rowe]]&lt;ref&gt;William L. Rowe (1998): ''The Cosmological Argument''. Fordham Univ Press, 273 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished the following three:
# factual necessity (existential necessity): a factually necessary being is not causally dependent on any other being, while any other being is causally dependent on it.
# causal necessity (subsumed by Hicks under the former type): a causally necessary being is such that it is logically impossible for it to be causally dependent on any other being, and it is logically impossible for any other being to be causally independent of it.
# [[Logical truth|logical necessity]]: a logically necessary being is a being whose non-existence is a logical impossibility, and which therefore exists either timeless or eternally in all possible worlds.
While many theologians (e.g. [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[René Descartes]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]) considered God to be a logically or metaphysically necessary being, Richard Swinburne argued for factual necessity, and [[Alvin Plantinga]] argues that God is a causally necessary being. Because a factually or causally necessary being does not exist by logical necessity, it does not exist in all logically possible worlds.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald H. Nash (1983): ''The Concept of God''. Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Swinburne used the term "ultimate brute fact" for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Swinburne (2004): ''The Existence of God''. 2nd ed. Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 96&lt;/ref&gt;

== A priori and necessary truths == 
In [[Naming and Necessity]],&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. 1980. ''Naming and Necessity''. [[Harvard University Press]]: 22.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saul Kripke]] argued that there were [[a posteriori]] truths, such as Hesperus is Phosphoros, or Water is H20, that were nonetheless metaphysically necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6944">The ''' New Man ''' is a [[utopia]]n concept that involves the creation of a new ideal human being or [[citizen]] replacing un-ideal human beings or citizens. The meaning of a New Man has widely varied and various alternatives have been suggested by a variety of religions and political ideologies, including [[Christianity]], [[communism]], [[classical liberalism]], [[fascism]], and [[utopian socialism]].

==Philosophical and religious versions==

===Christian New Man===
The doctrines of [[Paul the Apostle]] speak of [[Adam]] both as the fallen "Old Adam" and a "New Adam" as referring collectively to the fallen Old Man of humanity and a resurrected "New Man" (Ephesians 2:15, The Holy Bible) following [[Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;Jung Hoon Kim, Chŏng-hun Kim. ''The significance of clothing imagery in the Pauline Corpus''. New York, New York, USA: T&amp;T Clark International, 2004. Pp. 182.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nietzschean ''Übermensch''===
Philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s concept of an ''[[Übermensch]]'' ("Overman") was that of a New Man who would be a leader by example to humanity through an [[Existentialism|existentialist]] [[will to power]] that was [[Vitalism|vitalist]] and [[Irrationalism|irrationalist]] in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hans van Stralen. ''Choices and conflict: essays on literature and existentialism''. Pp. Brussels, Belgium: Peter Lang, 2005. 127-128.&lt;/ref&gt; Nietzsche developed the concept in response to his view of the [[herd mentality]] of and inherent [[nihilism]] of Christianity, and the void in existential meaning that is realized with the [[death of God]]. The Übermensch emerges as the new meaning of the Earth, a norm-repudiating individual who overcomes himself and is the master in control of his impulses and passions.

==Political versions==

===Liberal New Man===
[[Thomas Paine]] and [[William Godwin]] believed that the spread of liberalism in [[France]] and the [[United States]] constituted the birth of a New Man and a new era.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Claeys. The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utopian Socialist New Man===
[[Utopian socialism|Utopian socialists]] such as [[Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]] and [[Robert Owen]] saw a future [[Golden Age]] led by a New Man who would reconstruct society.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Gregory Claeys. The Cambridge Companion to Utopian Literature. Cambridge, England, UK: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Pp. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communist New Man===
{{see also|New Soviet man}}
[[Marxism]], though heavily critical of [[utopianism]], postulates the development of a New Man and New Woman in a [[communist society]] following the values of a non-essential nature of the state and the importance of [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|freely associated]] work for the affirmation of a person's humanity. Marxism does not see the New Man/Woman as a goal or prerequisite for achieving full communism, but rather as a product of the social conditions of pure communism. [[Che Guevara]]'s essay "Socialism and man in [[Cuba]]" and [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Soul of Man under Socialism]]'' are two examples of the 'new man' archetype in socialist literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/guevara/1965/03/man-socialism.htm|title=Socialism and man in Cuba|first=Che|last=Guevara|website=www.marxists.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fascist New Man===
[[Fascism]] supports the creation of a New Man who is a figure of action, violence, and [[masculinity]], committed as a component of a disciplined mass that has shorn itself of [[individualism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires.

===Transhumanist New Man===
[[Transhumanism]] welcomes the creation of a literal ''new man'' by enhancements through cybernetics and other "human enhancements", and look to the [[Transhumanism#Artificial intelligence and the technological singularity|singularity]] as that point in time when the new man arrives, his birthday if you will.  Scholar [[Klaus Vondung]] argues that Transhumanism represents the final revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dsIwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA364|title=Revolutions: Finished and Unfinished, From Primal to Final|first1=Paul|last1=Caringella|first2=Wayne|last2=Cristaudo|first3=Glenn|last3=Hughes|date=21 February 2013|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have made similar observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40309-013-0014-5|title=New man in utopian and transhumanist perspective|first=Richard|last=Saage|date=1 December 2013|publisher=|journal=European Journal of Futures Research|volume=1|issue=1|pages=14|via=link.springer.com|doi=10.1007/s40309-013-0014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3rABgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91 Knowing New Biotechnologies: Social Aspects of Technological Convergence], p. 77-91&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2454">The '''Nordic sexual morality debate''' (Danish: ''sædelighedsfejden'', Swedish: ''sedlighetsdebatten'', Norwegian: ''sedelighetsdebatten'') was the name for a cultural movement and public debate in [[Scandinavia]] in the 1880s, where sexuality and sexual morals were discussed in newspapers, magazines, books and theatrical plays.

The topic was criticism of the contemporary sexual [[double standard]]s, in which it was socially acceptable for men to have premarital sexual experience, while women were expected to be virgins, and the contemporary view on prostitution, which was sanctioned as a "necessary evil" because of this double standard, an issue that had been raised by [[Svenska Federationen]] in 1878.  

The debate was divided in two sides: the moderate one, where [[Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson]] was the most known representative, wished to solve this double standard by demanding that men also be virgins on their wedding night, as women were. The radical one, where [[Edvard Brandes]] and [[Georg Brandes]] were the most known representatives, demanded that women be free to enjoy a sexual life prior to marriage, as men were.

[[Getting Married (collection)|''Getting Married'' (collection)]] by [[August Strindberg]] and the legal court case that surrounded it was one of the perhaps most known incidents during the debate. It also caused a debate within the literary world whether literature should touch these questions at all. Other well-known works in the debate are [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''A Doll's House'' (Et Dukkehjem), the novel ''Money'' (Pengar) by [[Viktoria Benedictsson]], and the novel ''Pyrhussegrar'' by [[Stella Kleve]].

&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{Liberalism sidebar |Ideas}}
The '''open society''' was conceived in 1932 by French philosopher [[Henri Bergson]].&lt;ref&gt;• Henri Bergson ([1932] 1937).  ''Les Deux Sources de la morale et de la religion'', [[wikisource:fr:Les Deux Sources de la morale et de la religion/Chapitre I|ch. I, pp. 1-103,]] &amp; [[wikisource:fr:Les Deux Sources de la morale et de la religion/Chapitre IV|ch. IV, pp.  287–343]]. Félix Alcan.&lt;br /&gt;• Translated as ([1935] 1977), ''[https://archive.org/stream/twosourcesofmora033499mbp#page/n1/mode/2up The Two Sources of Morality and Religion]''  Internet Archive (left or right arrow buttons select succeeding pages), pp. 18-27, 45-65, 229-34.&lt;!-- these excerpts distinguish between closed &amp; open societies. 6/20/2017 --&gt;, trs., R. A. Audra and C. Brereton, with assistance of W. H. Carter. Macmillan press, Notre Dame.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Leszek Kołakowski]], ''Modernity on Endless Trial'' (1997), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was further developed during the Second World War by Austrian-born British philosopher [[Karl Popper]].&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, ''[[The Open Society and its Enemies]]'', 2 vols. ([1945] 1966), 5th ed.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[A. N. Wilson]], ''Our Times'' (2008), pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Bergson describes a '''closed society''' as a closed system of law or religion.  It is static, like a [[closed mind]].&lt;ref name=mautner&gt;Thomas Mautner (2005), 2nd ed. ''The Penguin Dictionary of Philosophy'' ["open society" entry], p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt; Bergson suggests that if all traces of civilization were to disappear, the instincts of the closed society for including or excluding others would remain.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, '' The Two Sources of Morality and Religion'', pp. [https://archive.org/stream/twosourcesofmora033499mbp#page/n1/mode/2up 20-21.] 1935, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;   In contrast, an open society is dynamic and inclined to [[moral universalism]].&lt;ref name=mautner/&gt;

Popper saw the open society as part of a historical continuum reaching from the organic, [[tribe|tribal]], or [[Authoritarianism|closed society]], through the open society marked by a critical attitude to tradition, to the abstract or depersonalized society lacking all [[face-to-face interaction]] transactions.&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, ''[[The Open Society and its Enemies]]'' (1945), v 1:1 and 174–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In open societies, the [[government]] is expected to be responsive and tolerant, and its political mechanisms [[Transparency (humanities)|transparent]] and flexible.  It can be characterized as opposed to [[authoritarianism]].&lt;!-- This paragraph is borderline incoherent and deeply questionable. "An insider of Vienna thinkers?" What does the open society have to do with Game Theory? What does Game Theory have to do with Vienna? Why is Thorstein Veblen cited, even though he died before the concept of Open Society was developed? Finally, his name is misspelt. The whole paragraph should be deleted. --&gt;

==History==
Popper saw the classical Greeks as initiating the long slow transition from tribalism towards the open society, and as facing for the first time the strain imposed by the less personal group relations entailed thereby.&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:175–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Whereas tribalistic and [[collectivism|collectivist]] societies do not distinguish between natural laws and social customs, so that individuals are unlikely to challenge traditions they believe to have a sacred or magical basis, the beginnings of an open society are marked by a distinction between natural and man-made law, and an increase in personal responsibility and accountability for moral choices (not incompatible with religious belief).&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., ''The Open Society and Its Enemies, Volume One'' (Routledge, 1945, reprint 2006), chapter 5, part III.&lt;/ref&gt;

Popper argued that the ideas of individuality, criticism, and [[humanitarianism]] cannot be suppressed once people have become aware of them, and therefore that it is impossible to return to the closed society,&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., ''The Open Society and Its Enemies, Volume One'' (Routledge, 1945, reprint 2006), chapter 10, part VIII.&lt;/ref&gt; but at the same time recognized the continuing emotional pull of what he called “the lost group spirit of tribalism”, as manifested for example in the [[totalitarianism]]s of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:199–200&lt;/ref&gt;

While the period since Popper's study has undoubtedly been marked by the spread of the open society, this may be attributed less to Popper's advocacy and more to the role of the economic advances of [[late modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 403&lt;/ref&gt; Growth-based industrial societies require literacy, anonymity and social mobility from their members&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Gellner]], ''Nationalism'' (1997), pp. 25–9&lt;/ref&gt; — elements incompatible with much traditional-based behavior but demanding the ever-wider spread of the abstract social relations [[Georg Simmel]] saw as characterizing the metropolitan mental stance.&lt;ref&gt;M. Hardt/K. Weeks, ''The Jameson Reader'' (2000), pp. 260–6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Popper defined the open society as one "in which individuals are confronted with personal decisions" as opposed to a "magical or tribal or collectivist society."&lt;ref&gt;Popper, K., ''The Open Society and Its Enemies, Volume One'' (Routledge, 1945, reprint 2006), chapter 10, part I.&lt;/ref&gt;

He considered that only democracy provides an institutional mechanism for reform and leadership change without the need for bloodshed, [[revolution]] or [[coup d'état]].&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:4&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern advocates of the open society suggest that [[society]] would keep no secrets from itself in the public sense, as all are trusted with the knowledge of all. [[Freedom (political)|Political freedoms]] and [[human rights]] are claimed to be the foundation of an open society.{{by whom|date=December 2011}}

==Critical knowledge==
Popper's concept of the open society is [[epistemological]] rather than political.&lt;ref name="Soros-2006"&gt;Soros, George, "The Age of Fallibility," ''Public Affairs'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; When Popper wrote ''[[The Open Society and its Enemies]]'', he believed that the social sciences had failed to grasp the significance and the nature of [[fascism]] and [[communism]] because these sciences were based on what he saw to be faulty epistemology.&lt;ref name="Popper-vol2-23-24"&gt;Popper, K., ''The Open Society and Its Enemies, Volume Two'' (Routledge, 1945, reprint 2006), chapters 23 and 24.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Totalitarianism]] forced knowledge to become political which made critical thinking impossible and led to the destruction of knowledge in totalitarian countries.&lt;ref name="Popper-vol2-23-24"/&gt;

Popper's theory that knowledge is provisional and fallible implies that society must be open to alternative points of view. An open society is associated with [[cultural pluralism|cultural]] and [[religious pluralism]]; it is always open to improvement because knowledge is never completed but always ongoing: “if we wish to remain human, then there is only one way, the way into the open society... into the unknown, the uncertain and insecure”.&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:201&lt;/ref&gt;

In the '''closed society''', claims to certain knowledge and ultimate truth lead to the attempted imposition of one version of reality.  Such a society is closed to freedom of thought.  In contrast, in an open society each citizen needs to engage in critical thinking, which requires freedom of thought and expression and the cultural and legal institutions that can  facilitate this.&lt;ref name="Soros-2006"/&gt;

==Further characteristics==
[[Humanitarianism]], [[egalitarianism|equality]] and [[Freedom (political)|political freedom]] are ideally fundamental characteristics of an open society. This was recognized by [[Pericles]], a statesman of the [[Athenian democracy]], in his laudatory funeral oration: "advancement in public life falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being allowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if a man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity of his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends also to our ordinary life."&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides, ''The History of the Peloponnesian War'', [http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pericles.htm Book II: Pericles' Funeral Oration].&lt;/ref&gt;

Arguably however it was the tension between a traditional society and the new, more open space of the emerging ''polis'' which most fully marked classical Athens,&lt;ref&gt;J. Boardman ''et al.'', ''The Oxford History of the Classical World'' (1991), p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; and Popper was very aware of the continuing emotional appeal of what he called "holism...longing for the lost unity of tribal life"&lt;ref&gt;K. R. Popper, 1945:80&lt;/ref&gt; into the modern world.

== Caveats ==
Investor and philanthropist [[George Soros]], a self-described follower of Karl Popper,&lt;ref&gt;Soros, George, ''Soros on Soros'' (John Wiley and Sons, 1995), page 33.&lt;/ref&gt; argued that sophisticated use of powerful techniques of subtle deception borrowed from modern advertising and cognitive science by conservative political operatives such as [[Frank Luntz]] and [[Karl Rove]] casts doubt on Popper's view of open society.&lt;ref name="Soros-nov-8-2007"&gt;Soros, George, [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/soros36 "From Karl Popper to Karl Rove - and Back"], ''Project Syndicate'' (November 8, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Because the electorate's perception of reality can easily be manipulated, democratic political discourse does not necessarily lead to a better understanding of reality.&lt;ref name="Soros-nov-8-2007"/&gt;  Soros argues that in addition to the need for separation of powers, free speech, and free elections, an explicit commitment to the pursuit of truth is imperative.&lt;ref name="Soros-nov-8-2007"/&gt; "Politicians will respect, rather than manipulate, reality only if the public cares about the truth and punishes politicians when it catches them in deliberate deception."&lt;ref name="Soros-nov-8-2007"/&gt;

Popper however, did not identify the open society either with democracy or with capitalism or a ''laissez-faire'' economy, but rather with a critical frame of mind on the part of the individual, in the face of communal [[group think]] of whatever kind.&lt;ref&gt;I. C. Jarvie ''et al.'' eds., ''Popper's Open Society after fifty years'' (1999), pp. 43–6&lt;/ref&gt; An important aspect in Popper's thinking is the notion that the truth can be lost. Critical attitude does not mean that the truth is found.

Throughout the research literature, overconfidence has been defined in three distinct ways: (1) ''overestimation'' of one's actual performance; (2) ''overplacement'' of one's performance relative to others; and (3) ''overprecision'' in expressing unwarranted certainty in the accuracy of one's beliefs.&lt;ref name="MooreHealy2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moore|first1=Don A.|last2=Healy|first2=Paul J.|title=The trouble with overconfidence|journal=Psychological Review|volume=115|issue=2|year=2008|pages=502–517|doi=10.1037/0033-295X.115.2.502|pmid=18426301|url=http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1340&amp;context=tepper|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141106041057/http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1340&amp;context=tepper|archivedate=2014-11-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Don A.|last2=Schatz|first2=Derek|date=August 2017|title=The three faces of overconfidence|url=http://doi.wiley.com/10.1111/spc3.12331|journal=Social and Personality Psychology Compass|language=en|volume=11|issue=8|pages=e12331|doi=10.1111/spc3.12331|issn=1751-9004|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common way in which overconfidence has been studied is by asking people how confident they are of specific beliefs they hold or answers they provide.  The data show that confidence systematically exceeds accuracy, implying people are more sure that they are correct than they deserve to be. If human confidence had perfect calibration, judgments with 100% confidence would be correct 100% of the time, 90% confidence correct 90% of the time, and so on for the other levels of confidence. By contrast, the key finding is that confidence exceeds accuracy so long as the subject is answering hard questions about an unfamiliar topic. For example, in a spelling task, subjects were correct about 80% of the time, whereas they claimed to be 100% certain.&lt;ref name=Adams1960&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adams|first1=P. A.|last2=Adams|first2=J. K.|title=Confidence in the recognition and reproduction of words difficult to spell|journal=The American Journal of Psychology|date=1960|volume=73|pages=544–552|pmid=13681411|doi=10.2307/1419942|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put another way, the error rate was 20% when subjects expected it to be 0%.  In a series where subjects made true-or-false responses to general knowledge statements, they were overconfident at all levels. When they were 100% certain of their answer to a question, they were wrong 20% of the time.&lt;ref name="state"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lichtenstein|first= Sarah|first2=Baruch |last2=Fischhoff |first3=Lawrence D. |last3=Phillips |chapter=Calibration of probabilities: The state of the art to 1980 |editor-last1=Kahneman|editor-first1=Daniel|editor-last2=Slovic|editor-first2=Paul|editor-last3=Tversky|editor-first3=Amos|title=Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases| publisher=Cambridge University Press| date=1982| isbn=978-0-521-28414-1|pages=306–334}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overconfidence distinctions ==

=== Overestimation ===
One manifestation of the overconfidence effect is the tendency to overestimate one's standing on a dimension of judgment or performance. This subsection of overconfidence focuses on the certainty one feels in their own ability, performance, level of control, or chance of success. This phenomenon is most likely to occur on hard tasks, hard items, when failure is likely or when the individual making the estimate is not especially skilled. Overestimation has been seen to occur across domains other than those pertaining to one's own performance. This includes the ''[[illusion of control]]'', ''[[planning fallacy]]''.&lt;ref name="MooreHealy2008" /&gt;

==== Illusion of control ====
Illusion of control describes the tendency for people to behave as if they might have some control when in fact they have none.&lt;ref name="Langer1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langer|first1=Ellen J.|title=The illusion of control|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=32|issue=2|year=1975|pages=311–328|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.32.2.311}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, evidence does not support the notion that people systematically overestimate how much control they have; when they have a great deal of control, people tend to underestimate how much control they have.&lt;ref name="GinoSharek2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gino|first1=Francesca|last2=Sharek|first2=Zachariah|last3=Moore|first3=Don A.|title=Keeping the illusion of control under control: Ceilings, floors, and imperfect calibration|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=114|issue=2|year=2011|pages=104–114|doi=10.1016/j.obhdp.2010.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Planning fallacy ====
The [[planning fallacy]] describes the tendency for people to overestimate their rate of work or to underestimate how long it will take them to get things done.&lt;ref name="BuehlerGriffin1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Buehler|first1=Roger|last2=Griffin|first2=Dale|last3=Ross|first3=Michael|title=Exploring the "planning fallacy": Why people underestimate their task completion times|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=67|issue=3|year=1994|pages=366–381|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.3.366}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is strongest for long and complicated tasks, and disappears or reverses for simple tasks that are quick to complete.

==== Contrary evidence ====
Wishful-thinking effects, in which people overestimate the likelihood of an event because of its desirability, are relatively rare.&lt;ref name="KrizanWindschitl2007"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krizan|first1=Zlatan|last2=Windschitl|first2=Paul D.|title=The influence of outcome desirability on optimism|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=133|issue=1|year=2007|pages=95–121|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.133.1.95|url=http://public.psych.iastate.edu/zkrizan/pdf/krizan_windschitl_06db.pdf|pmid=17201572|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141217083929/http://public.psych.iastate.edu/zkrizan/pdf/krizan_windschitl_06db.pdf|archivedate=2014-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This may be in part because people engage in more [[defensive pessimism]] in advance of important outcomes,&lt;ref name="NoremCantor1986"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norem|first1=Julie K.|last2=Cantor|first2=Nancy|title=Defensive pessimism: Harnessing anxiety as motivation|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=51|issue=6|year=1986|pages=1208–1217|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.51.6.1208|pmid=3806357}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an attempt to reduce the disappointment that follows overly optimistic predictions.&lt;ref name="McGrawMellers2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McGraw|first1=A.

=== Overprecision ===
Overprecision is the excessive confidence that one knows the truth. For reviews, see Harvey (1997) or Hoffrage (2004).&lt;ref name="Harvey1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harvey|first1=Nigel|title=Confidence in judgment|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=1|issue=2|year=1997|pages=78–82|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(97)01014-0|pmid=21223868}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter = Overconfidence|editor-first = Rüdiger |editor-last =Pohl|first = Ulrich|last = Hoffrage|title = Cognitive Illusions: a handbook on fallacies and biases in thinking, judgement and memory|publisher = Psychology Press|date = 2004|isbn = 978-1-84169-351-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much of the evidence for overprecision comes from studies in which participants are asked about their confidence that individual items are correct. This paradigm, while useful, cannot distinguish overestimation from overprecision; they are one and the same in these item-confidence judgments. After making a series of item-confidence judgments, if people try to estimate the number of items they got right, they do not tend to systematically overestimate their scores. The average of their item-confidence judgments exceeds the count of items they claim to have gotten right.&lt;ref name=Gigerenzer1993&gt;{{cite book|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;uid=1994-97037-011|last1=Gigerenzer|first1= Gerd|year=1993|chapter= The bounded rationality of probabilistic mental models|editor-first1= K. I.|editor-last1= Manktelow |editor-first2=D. E. |editor-last2=Over|title=Rationality: Psychological and philosophical perspectives |pages=127–171|location=London|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415069557}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One possible explanation for this is that item-confidence judgments were inflated by overprecision, and that their judgments do not demonstrate systematic overestimation.

==== Confidence intervals ====
The strongest evidence of overprecision comes from studies in which participants are asked to indicate how precise their knowledge is by specifying a 90% confidence interval around estimates of specific quantities. If people were perfectly calibrated, their 90% confidence intervals would include the correct answer 90% of the time.&lt;ref name="AlpertRaiffa1982"&gt;{{cite book|last=Alpert|first= Marc|first2=Howard |last2=Raiffa|chapter=A progress report on the training of probability assessors|editor-last1=Kahneman|editor-first1=Daniel|editor-last2=Slovic|editor-first2=Paul|editor-last3=Tversky|editor-first3=Amos|title=Judgment Under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases | publisher=Cambridge University Press| date=1982| isbn=978-0-521-28414-1|pages=294–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In fact, hit rates are often as low as 50%, suggesting people have drawn their confidence intervals too narrowly, implying that they think their knowledge is more accurate than it actually is.

=== Overplacement ===
Overplacement is perhaps the most prominent manifestation of the overconfidence effect.  Overplacement is a judgment of your performance compared to another. This subsection of overconfidence occurs when people believe themselves to be better than others, or "better-than-average".&lt;ref name="MooreHealy2008" /&gt; It is the act of placing yourself or rating yourself above others (superior to others). Overplacement more often occurs on simple tasks, ones we believe are easy to accomplish successfully. One explanation for this theory is its ability to self-enhance.

==== Manifestations ====

===== Better-than-average effects =====
{{main|Illusory superiority}}
Perhaps the most celebrated better-than-average finding is Svenson's (1981) finding that 93% of American drivers rate themselves as better than the median.&lt;ref name="Svenson1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Svenson|first1=Ola|title=Are we all less risky and more skillful than our fellow drivers?|journal=Acta Psychologica|volume=47|issue=2|year=1981|pages=143–148|doi=10.1016/0001-6918(81)90005-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The frequency with which school systems claim their students outperform national averages has been dubbed the "Lake Wobegon" effect, after Garrison Keillor's apocryphal town in which "all the children are above average."&lt;ref name=Cannell1989&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cannell|first1=John Jacob|year=1989|title=How public educators cheat on standardized achievement tests: The "Lake Wobegon" report|url=http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED314454|journal=Friends for Education|location=Albuquerque, NM|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107152116/http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED314454|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Overplacement has likewise been documented in a wide variety of other circumstances.&lt;ref name="Dunning2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunning|first=David|title=Self-Insight: Roadblocks and Detours on the Path to Knowing Thyself|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IAh2VRu4wGgC|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn= 978-1841690742 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kruger (1999), however, showed that this effect is limited to "easy" tasks in which success is common or in which people feel competent. For difficult tasks, the effect reverses itself and people believe they are worse than others.&lt;ref name="Kruger1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruger|first1=Justin|title=Lake Wobegon be gone! The "below-average effect" and the egocentric nature of comparative ability judgments|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=77|issue=2|year=1999|pages=221–232|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.77.2.221|pmid=10474208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Comparative-optimism effects =====
Some researchers have claimed that people think good things are more likely to happen to them than to others, whereas bad events were less likely to happen to them than to others.&lt;ref name="Weinstein1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinstein|first1=Neil D.|title=Unrealistic optimism about future life events|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=39|issue=5|year=1980|pages=806–820|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.39.5.806}}&lt;/ref&gt;
But others have pointed out that prior work tended to examine good outcomes that happened to be common (such as owning one's own home) and bad outcomes that happened to be rare (such as being struck by lightning).&lt;ref name="ChambersWindschitl2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambers|first1=John R.|last2=Windschitl|first2=Paul D.|title=Biases in Social Comparative Judgments: The Role of Nonmotivated Factors in Above-Average and Comparative-Optimism Effects|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=130|issue=5|year=2004|pages=813–838|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.5.813|pmid=15367082}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChambersWindschitl2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chambers|first1=John R.|last2=Windschitl|first2=Paul D.|last3=Suls|first3=Jerry|title=Egocentrism, Event Frequency, and Comparative Optimism: When what Happens Frequently is "More Likely to Happen to Me"|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|volume=29|issue=11|year=2003|pages=1343–1356|doi=10.1177/0146167203256870|pmid=15189574}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KrugerBurrus2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kruger|first1=Justin|last2=Burrus|first2=Jeremy|title=Egocentrism and focalism in unrealistic optimism (and pessimism)|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=40|issue=3|year=2004|pages=332–340|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2003.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Event frequency accounts for a proportion of prior findings of comparative optimism.  People think common events (such as living past 70) are more likely to happen to them than to others, and rare events (such as living past 100) are less likely to happen to them than to others.

===== Positive illusions =====
{{Main|Positive illusions}}
Taylor and Brown (1988) have argued that people cling to overly positive beliefs about themselves, illusions of control, and beliefs in false superiority, because it helps them cope and thrive.&lt;ref name="TaylorBrown1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=Shelley E.|last2=Brown|first2=Jonathon D.|title=Illusion and well-being: A social psychological perspective on mental health|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=103|issue=2|year=1988|pages=193–210|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.103.2.193|pmid=3283814}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although there is some evidence that optimistic beliefs are correlated with better life outcomes, most of the research documenting such links is vulnerable to the alternative explanation that their forecasts are accurate.

Overconfidence has been called the most "pervasive and potentially catastrophic" of all the cognitive biases to which human beings fall victim.&lt;ref name="Plous1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Plous|first=Scott|title=The Psychology of Judgment and Decision Making|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvWOQgAACAAJ|year=1993|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=978-0-07-050477-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been blamed for lawsuits, strikes, wars, and stock market bubbles and crashes.

Strikes, lawsuits, and wars could arise from overplacement. If plaintiffs and defendants were prone to believe that they were more deserving, fair, and righteous than their legal opponents, that could help account for the persistence of inefficient enduring legal disputes.&lt;ref name="ThompsonLoewenstein1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thompson|first1=Leigh|last2=Loewenstein|first2=George|title=Egocentric interpretations of fairness and interpersonal conflict|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes|volume=51|issue=2|year=1992|pages=176–197|url=https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gl20/GeorgeLoewenstein/Papers_files/pdf/EgocentricInterpretationsFairness.pdf|doi=10.1016/0749-5978(92)90010-5|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107192223/https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gl20/GeorgeLoewenstein/Papers_files/pdf/EgocentricInterpretationsFairness.pdf|archivedate=2014-11-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If nations were prone to believe that their militaries were stronger than were those of other nations, that could explain their willingness to go to war.&lt;ref name="Johnson2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Dominic D. P.|title=Overconfidence and War: The Havoc and Glory of Positive Illusions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ccu7OhgusaAC|year=2004|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-01576-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overprecision could have important implications for investing behavior and stock market trading.  Because Bayesians cannot agree to disagree,&lt;ref name="Aumann1976"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aumann|first1=Robert J.|title=Agreeing to Disagree|journal=The Annals of Statistics|volume=4|issue=6|year=1976|pages=1236–1239|doi=10.1214/aos/1176343654}}&lt;/ref&gt; classical finance theory has trouble explaining why, if stock market traders are fully rational Bayesians, there is so much trading in the stock market.  Overprecision might be one answer.&lt;ref name="DanielHirshleifer1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Daniel|first1=Kent|last2=Hirshleifer|first2=David|last3=Subrahmanyam|first3=Avanidhar|title=Investor Psychology and Security Market Under- and Overreactions|journal=The Journal of Finance|volume=53|issue=6|year=1998|pages=1839–1885|doi=10.1111/0022-1082.00077}}&lt;/ref&gt; If market actors are too sure their estimates of an asset's value is correct, they will be too willing to trade with others who have different information than they do.

This allowed confidence to be compared against accuracy. As the subjects were given more information about the case study, their confidence increased from 33% to 53%. However their accuracy did not significantly improve, staying under 30%. Hence this experiment demonstrated overconfidence which increased as the subjects had more information to base their judgment on.&lt;ref name="oskamp" /&gt;

Even if there is no general tendency toward overconfidence, social dynamics and [[adverse selection]] could conceivably promote it.  For instance, those most likely to have the courage to start a new business are those who most overplace their abilities relative to those of other potential entrants.  And if voters find confident leaders more credible, then contenders for leadership learn that they should express more confidence than their opponents in order to win election.&lt;ref name="RadzevickMoore2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Radzevick |first1=J.

Overconfidence can be beneficial to individual [[self-esteem]] as well as giving an individual the [[Volition (psychology)|will]] to succeed in their desired goal. Just believing in oneself may give one the will to take one's endeavours further than those who do not.&lt;ref name=Seed2011&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Johnson|first2=Dominic D.

'''Partner-optimized inventory management''', also known as '''partnerized inventory management''' or sometimes just the abbreviation '''PIM''' is an [[inventory]] management technique or model often used in [[Deterministic system|deterministic]] inventory systems in which a significant portion of the total inventory regularly becomes [[Stochastic process|stochastic]] in nature, due to slowing and/or low demand such as is typical in heavy machinery and construction equipment where the products themselves are extremely durable and have long lives in the field. Inventory in these cases needs to be maintained for an extended time to allow for repairs and product support perhaps as much as two or more decades after a manufacturer has ceased production.

Traditional inventory management techniques break down in cases where a manufacturer maintains inventory to supply future maintenance of their in-service equipment. As demand for [[finished goods|goods]] approaches zero, liquidation of inventory is indicated in most [[revenue management]] models.&lt;ref name="SAXENA2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=R. S. SAXENA|title=INVENTORY MANAGEMENT: Controlling in a Fluctuating Demand Environment|date=1 December 2009|publisher=Global India Publications|isbn=978-93-8022-821-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zero inventory to service products in the field, however, fails the organization in other business areas. Possible costs to manufacture replacement inventory and the harder-to-calculate costs of [[Customer experience|customer confidence]] erosion can be greater over time than the immediate financial concerns that are remedied by liquidating inventory entirely by [[scrap]]ping or discarding it as [[waste]].&lt;ref&gt;“Are Your Inventory Management Practices Outdated,” AberdeenGroup, 1 March 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

While scrapping returns inventory to a state of raw materials, Partner-Optimized Inventory Management (PIM) returns inventory to the market as [[intermediate good]]s to be used in production of other goods or non-capital [[spare part]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=PIM: A Dynamic Model for Inventory Management|year=2012|publisher=Lippert Enterprises|location=Ashland, Ohio|url=http://lippertent.com/free-whitepaper.html|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An organization that uses the PIM model mitigates the immediate [[Pinch point (economics)|pinch point]] caused by inventory reduction by retaining as-needed mutual access to inventory through the marketplace for an indeterminate time rather than losing access immediately and irrevocably through scrapping or discarding the inventory as waste.

'''Persecution''' is the systematic mistreatment of an individual or group by another individual or group. The most common forms are [[religious persecution]], [[racism]] and [[political persecution]], though there is naturally some overlap between these terms. The inflicting of suffering, [[harassment]], [[imprisonment]], [[internment]], fear, or pain are all factors that may establish persecution, but not all suffering will necessarily establish persecution. The suffering experienced by the victim must be sufficiently severe. The threshold level of severity has been a source of much debate.&lt;ref&gt;S. Rempell, Defining Persecution, http://ssrn.com/abstract=1941006&lt;/ref&gt;

==International law==
As part of the [[Nuremberg Principles]], [[crimes against humanity]] are part of international law. Principle VI of the [[Nuremberg Principles]] states that
{{quotation|The crimes hereinafter set out are punishable as crimes under international law:...

(c) Crimes against humanity:
:Murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation and other inhumane acts done against any civilian population, or persecutions on political, racial, or religious grounds, when such acts are done or such persecutions are carried on in execution of or in connection with any crime against peace or any [[war crime]].}}

[[Telford Taylor]], who was Counsel for the Prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials wrote "[at] the Nuremberg war crimes trials, the tribunals rebuffed several efforts by the prosecution to bring such 'domestic' atrocities within the scope of international law as 'crimes against humanity'".&lt;ref&gt;Telford Taylor [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04EFDC1439F93BA15750C0A964948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all "When people kill a people"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 28, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; Several subsequent international treaties incorporate this principle, but some have dropped the restriction "in connection with any crime against peace or any war crime" that is in Nuremberg Principles.

The [[Rome Statute]] of the [[International Criminal Court]], which is binding on 111 states, defines crimes against humanity in Article 7.1. The article criminalises certain acts "committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed against any civilian population, with knowledge of the attack". These include:

{{quotation|(h) Persecution against any identifiable group or collectivity on political, racial, national, ethnic, cultural, religious, gender&lt;ref&gt;Article 7.3 of the Rome Statute, which constitutes "compromise text" states that "For the purpose of this Statute, it is understood that the term 'gender' refers to the two sexes, male and female, within the context of society. The term 'gender' does not indicate any meaning different from the above." While under international criminal law persecution based on Gender Identity is also prohibited, during the Rome Diplomatic Conference that adopted the ICC Statute, it was decided to define gender narrowly in order to overcome opposition from the Holy See and other states that were concerned that the ICC could theoretically also look into discriminatory practices of religious institutions. This provision was balanced with that of Article 10, which states that "Nothing in this Part shall be interpreted as limiting or prejudicing in any way existing or developing rules of international law for purposes other than this Statute."&lt;/ref&gt;...or other grounds that are universally recognized as impermissible under international law, in connection with any act referred to in this paragraph [e.g. murder, extermination, enslavement, deportation, imprisonment, torture, sexual violence, apartheid, and other inhumane acts] or any crime within the jurisdiction of the Court}}

==Religious==
{{Main|Religious persecution}}
Religious persecution is systematic mistreatment of an individual or group due to their [[Religion|religious affiliation]]. Not only theorists of [[secularization]] (who presume a decline of [[religiosity]] in general) would willingly assume that religious persecution is a thing of the past{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. However, with the rise of [[fundamentalism]] and [[Religious terrorism|religiously related terrorism]], this assumption has become even more controversial{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. Indeed, in many countries of the world today, religious persecution is a Human Rights problem.

===Atheists===
{{Main|Persecution of atheists}}
[[Atheism|Atheist]]s have experienced persecution throughout history. Persecution may refer to unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, beating, torture, or execution. It also may refer to the confiscation or destruction of property.

===Bahá'ís===
{{Main|Persecution of Bahá'ís}}
The persecution of Bahá'ís refers to the [[religious persecution]] of Bahá'ís in various countries, especially in [[Iran]],&lt;ref name="fdih1"&gt;{{cite web | date = 2003-08-01 | title = Discrimination against religious minorities in Iran | author = International Federation for Human Rights | publisher = fdih.org | accessdate = 2006-10-20 | url = http://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/ir0108a.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has one of the largest Bahá'í populations in the world. The [[Bahá'í Faith]] originated in Iran, and it represents the largest religious minority in that country.

===Christians===
{{Main|Persecution of Christians}}
[[File:Siemiradzki Christian Dirce.jpg|thumb|400px|''A Christian Dirce'', by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]]. A Christian woman is martyred under [[Nero]] in this re-enactment of the myth of [[Dirce]] (painting by [[Henryk Siemiradzki]], 1897, [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]], [[Warsaw]]).]]
The persecution of Christians is [[religious persecution]] that [[Christian]]s may undergo as a consequence of professing [[Christianity|their faith]], both historically and in the current era.  [[Early Christians]] were persecuted for their [[Faith in Christianity|faith]] at the hands of both [[Persecution of Christians by the Jews|Jews]] from [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|whose religion Christianity arose]] and the [[Persecution of Christians in the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]] which controlled much of the [[Early centers of Christianity|land across which early Christianity was distributed]]. [[Christianity in the 4th century|Early in the fourth century]], the religion was legalized by the [[Edict of Milan]], and it eventually became the [[State church of the Roman Empire]].

[[Christian missionaries]], as well as the people that they converted to Christianity, have been the target of persecution, many times to the point of being [[Martyrdom|martyred for their faith]].

There is also a history of individual [[Christian denominations]] suffering persecution at the hands of other Christians under the charge of [[Heresy in Christianity|heresy]], particularly during the 16th century [[Protestant Reformation]] as well as throughout the Middle Ages when various Christian groups deemed heretical were persecuted by the Papacy.

In the 20th century, Christians have been persecuted by various groups, and by [[state atheism|atheistic states]] such as the [[USSR]] and [[North Korea]]. During the [[Second World War]] members of many Christian churches were persecuted in [[Germany]] for resisting the [[Nazi]] ideology.

In more recent times the Christian missionary organization [[Open Doors]] (UK) estimates 100&amp;nbsp;million Christians face persecution, particularly in [[List of Muslim-majority countries|Muslim-dominated countries]] such as [[Pakistan]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Open Doors]]: [http://www.opendoorsuk.org/resources/country_profiles.php The worst 50 countries for persecution of Christians] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304014428/http://www.opendoorsuk.org/resources/country_profiles.php |date=2012-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Open Doors: [http://www.opendoors-de.org/downloads/wvi/weltverfolgungsindex2012.pdf Weltverfolgungsindex 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120713221505/http://www.opendoors-de.org/downloads/wvi/weltverfolgungsindex2012.pdf |date=2012-07-13 }}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Society for Human Rights]], up to 80% of all acts of persecution are directed against people of the Christian faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Philpott |first=Daniel |title=Pope Francis and Religious Freedom |url=http://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/pope-francis-and-religious-freedom |publisher=Berkley Center for Religion, Peace &amp; World Affairs |location=Washington, DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (Mormonism)====
{{Main|Anti-Mormonism}}
With the Missouri [[Missouri Executive Order 44|extermination order]] Mormons became the only religious group to have a state of the United States legalize the extermination of their religion. This was after a speech given by Sideny Rigdon called the [[Rigdon's July 4th oration|July 4th Oration]] which while meant to state that Mormons would defend their lives and property was taken as inflammatory. Their forcible expulsion from the state caused the death of over a hundred due to exposure, starvation, and resulting illnesses.  The Mormons suffered through [[tarring and feathering]], their lands and possessions being repeatedly taken from them, mob attacks, false imprisonments, and the US sending an army to Utah to deal with the "Mormon problem" in the [[Utah War]] which resulted in the Mormons massacring settlers at the [[Mountain Meadows Massacre]]. A government militia slaughtered Mormons in what is now known as the [[Haun's Mill massacre]].  The founder of the church, [[Joseph Smith]], was killed in [[Carthage, Illinois]] by a mob of about 200 men, almost all of whom were members of the Illinois state militia including some members of the militia who were assigned to guard him.

====Jehovah's Witnesses====
{{Main|Persecution of Jehovah's Witnesses}}
Throughout the history of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], their beliefs, doctrines and practices have engendered [[Criticism of Jehovah's Witnesses|controversy]] and opposition from local governments, communities, and mainstream Christian groups.

===Falun Gong===
{{Main|Persecution of Falun Gong}}
[[Falun Gong]] was introduced to the general public by [[Li Hongzhi]](李洪志) in [[Changchun]], [[China]], in 1992. For the next few years, Falun Gong was the fastest growing ''[[qigong]]'' practice in Chinese history and, by 1999, there were between 70 and 100 million people practicing Falun Gong in China.&lt;ref name=Stats&gt;Source of Statistical Information, [http://www.faluninfo.net/article/517/?ci=5 Number of Falun Gong practitioners in China in 1999: at least 70 million, Falun Dafa Information Center], accessed 01/01/08&lt;/ref&gt; Following the seven years of widespread popularity, on July 20, 1999, the government of the [[People's Republic of China]] began a nationwide persecution campaign against Falun Gong practitioners, except in the special administrative regions of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]].&lt;ref&gt;Faison, Seth (April 27, 1999) [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/042799china-protest.html "In Beijing: A Roar of Silent Protesters"] ''New York Times'', retrieved June 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, Joseph (April 27, 1999) [http://partners.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/042799china-protest-leader.html "Notoriety Now for Exiled Leader of Chinese Movement"] ''New York Times'', retrieved June 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1999, legislation was created to outlaw "heterodox religions" and retroactively applied to Falun Gong.&lt;ref name="Leung"&gt;Leung, Beatrice (2002) 'China and Falun Gong: Party and society relations in the modern era', Journal of Contemporary China, 11:33, 761 – 784&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amnesty International]] states that the persecution is "politically motivated" with "legislation being used retroactively to convict people on {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}driven charges, and new regulations introduced to further restrict fundamental freedoms".&lt;ref name=Amnesty1&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030711022606/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/engASA170112000 The crackdown on Falun Gong and other so-called ''heretical organizations'' ], The Amnesty International&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hindus===
{{Main|Persecution of Hindus}}
Persecution of Hindus refers to the [[religious persecution]] inflicted upon [[Hindu]]s. Hindus have been historically persecuted during the [[Islam]]ic rule of the [[Indian subcontinent]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Durant|first=Will|title=The Story of Civilization: Our Oriental Heritage|page=459|quote=The Mohammedan Conquest of India is probably the bloodiest story in history. It is a discouraging tale, for its evident moral is that civilization is a precarious thing, whose delicate complex of order and liberty, culture and peace may at any time be overthrown by barbarians invading from without or multiplying within. The Hindus had allowed their strength to be wasted in internal division and war; they had adopted religions like Buddhism and Jainism, which unnerved them for the tasks of life; they had failed to organize their forces for the protection of their frontiers and their capitals, their wealth and their freedom, from the hordes of Scythians, Huns, Afghans and Turks hovering about India's boundaries and waiting for national weakness to let them in. For four hundred years (600–1000 AD) India invited conquest; and at last it came.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and during [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Goa Inquisition|rule]] of [[Goa]]. In modern times, Hindus in [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] have also suffered persecution. Most recently, thousands of Hindus from [[Sindh]] province in Pakistan have been fleeing to [[India]] voicing fear for their safety. After the [[Partition of India]] in 1947, there were 8.8 million Hindus in Pakistan (excluding Bangladesh) in 1951. In 1951, Hindus constituted 22% of the Pakistani population (including present-day Bangladesh which formed part of Pakistan).&lt;ref&gt;Census of Pakistan, 1951&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7zNuAAAAMAAJ Hindu Masjids] by Prafull Goradia, 2002 "In 1951, Muslims were 77 percent and Hindus were 22 percent."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the Hindu minority amounts to 1.7 percent of Pakistan's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/area_pop/area_pop.html Census of Pakistan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222185234/http://www.statpak.gov.pk/depts/pco/statistics/area_pop/area_pop.html |date=December 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] (1971) resulted in one of the largest genocides of the 20th century. While estimates of the number of casualties was 3,000,000, it is reasonably certain that Hindus bore a disproportionate brunt of the Pakistan Army's onslaught against the Bengali population of what was East Pakistan. An article in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]] dated 2 August 1971, stated "The Hindus, who account for three-fourths of the refugees and a majority of the dead, have borne the brunt of the Muslim military hatred."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,878408,00.html |title=World: Pakistan: The Ravaging of Golden Bengal - Printout |publisher=TIME |date=2 August 1971 |accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] wrote in a report that was part of [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] testimony dated 1 November 1971, "Hardest hit have been members of the Hindu community who have been robbed of their lands and shops, systematically slaughtered, and in some places, painted with yellow patches marked "H". All of this has been officially sanctioned, ordered and implemented under martial law from [[Islamabad]]". In the same report, Senator Kennedy reported that 80% of the refugees in India were Hindus and according to numerous international relief agencies such as [[UNESCO]] and [[World Health Organization]] the number of East Pakistani refugees at their peak in India was close to 10 million. In a syndicated column "The Pakistani Slaughter That Nixon Ignored", [[Pulitzer Prize]]–winning journalist [[Sydney Schanberg]]  wrote about his return to liberated Bangladesh in 1972. "Other reminders were the yellow "H"s the Pakistanis had painted on the homes of Hindus, particular targets of the Muslim army" (by "Muslim army", meaning the [[Pakistan Army]], which had targeted Bengali Muslims as well), ([[Newsday]], 29 April 1994).
 	
In Bangladesh, on 28 February 2013, the [[International Crimes Tribunal (Bangladesh)|International Crimes Tribunal]] sentenced [[Delwar Hossain Sayeedi]], the Vice President of the [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]] to death for the war crimes committed during the 1971 [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. Following the sentence, activists of [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]] and its student wing [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami#Bangladesh Islami Chhatra Shibir|Islami Chhatra Shibir]] attacked the Hindus in different parts of the country. Hindu properties were looted, Hindu houses were burnt into ashes and Hindu temples were desecrated and set on fire.&lt;ref name="English reference"&gt;{{cite news|title=Hindus Under Attack in Bangladesh|url=http://en.newsbharati.com/Encyc/2013/3/3/Hindus-under-attack-in-Bangladesh.aspx|accessdate=March 26, 2013|newspaper=News Bharati|date=March 3, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130317035708/http://en.newsbharati.com/Encyc/2013/3/3/Hindus-under-attack-in-Bangladesh.aspx|archivedate=March 17, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bagerhat Hindu Temple Set on Fire|url=http://dev-bd.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=241410&amp;cid=2|accessdate=March 20, 2013|newspaper=bdnews24.com|date=March 2, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130407194310/http://dev-bd.bdnews24.com/details.php?id=241410&amp;cid=2|archivedate=April 7, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The violence included the looting of Hindu properties and businesses, the burning of Hindu homes, the rape of Hindu women,{{cn|date=August 2018}} and the [[desecration]] and destruction of, according to community leaders, more than 50 [[Hindu temples]]; 1,500 Hindu homes were destroyed in 20 districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bangladesh: Wave of violent attacks against Hindu minority|url=http://amnesty.org/en/for-media/press-releases/bangladesh-wave-violent-attacks-against-hindu-minority-2013-03-06#.UTeKDSrYyD8.twitter|work=Press releases|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc09032013-1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-21712655|title=Bangladesh minorities 'terrorised' after mob violence|last=Ethirajan|first=Anbarasan|date=9 March 2013|work=BBC News|accessdate=17 March 2013|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the government has held the [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]] responsible for the attacks on the minorities, the [[Bangladesh Jamaat-e-Islami|Jamaat-e-Islami]] leadership has denied any involvement.

Persecution of Jews is a recurring phenomenon throughout [[Jewish history]]. It has occurred on numerous occasions and in widely different geographical locations. It may include [[pogrom]]s, [[looting]] and demolition of private and public Jewish property (e.g., [[Kristallnacht]]), unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, [[torture]], killing, or even mass execution (in [[World War II]] alone, approximately 6 million people were deliberately killed for the sole reason of being Jewish). They have been expelled from their hometowns/countries, hoping to find havens in other polities. In recent times [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitism]] has often been manifested as [[Anti-Zionism]],&lt;ref&gt;[[New antisemitism]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/viewSubCategory.asp?id=84|title=New Anti-Semitism: Disguised As "Anti-Zionism" - Discover the Networks|website=www.discoverthenetworks.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/Antizionism.htm|title=Anti-zionism as an expression of anti-Semitism in recent years&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|website=huji.ac.il|accessdate=22 October 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512173240/http://sicsa.huji.ac.il/Antizionism.htm|archivedate=12 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that there are various Jewish groups whose members themselves oppose the idea of [[Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Anti-Zionism#Jewish anti-Zionism]]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Persecution of Muslims|Persecution of Ahmadis|}}
The persecution of [[Muslim]]s has been a recurring phenomenon throughout the [[history of Islam]]. Persecution may refer to unwarranted arrest, imprisonment, beatings, torture, or execution. It may also refer to the confiscation or destruction of property, or incitement to hate Muslims.

Persecution can extend beyond those who perceive themselves to be Muslims and include those who are perceived by others as Muslims, or it can include Muslims who are considered non-Muslims by fellow Muslims. The [[Ahmadiyya]] regard themselves as Muslims, but are seen by many other Muslims as non-Muslims and "heretics". In 1984, the Government of [[Pakistan]], under General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq|Zia-ul-Haq]], passed [[Ordinance XX]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepersecution.org/50years/paklaw.html|title=Government of Pakistan – Law for Ahmadis|website=www.thepersecution.org|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which banned proselytizing by Ahmadis and also banned Ahmadis from referring to themselves as [[Muslim]]s. According to this ordinance, any Ahmadi who refers to oneself as a Muslim by words, either spoken or written, or by visible representation, directly or indirectly, or makes the call for prayer as other Muslims do, is punishable by imprisonment of up to 3 years. Because of these difficulties, [[Mirza Tahir Ahmad]] migrated to London.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

==Ethnic==
{{Main|Racism}}
Ethnic persecution refers to perceived persecution based on [[ethnicity]]. Its meaning is parallel to that of [[racism]], (based on [[Race (human classification)|race]]).  The [[Rwandan genocide]] remains an atrocity that the indigenous [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]] peoples still believe is unforgivable.  The [[Japanese occupation of China]] caused the death of millions of people, mostly peasants who were murdered after the [[Doolittle Raid]] in early-World War II.

===Germans===
{{Main|Organised persecution of ethnic Germans}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2009}}
The persecution of [[ethnic German]]s refers to systematic activity against groups of ethnic Germans based on their ethnicity. &lt;!-- There should be some mention in this section of the article of the English aristocracy, who were of German lineage (i.e. the Hapsburgs...) changing their Germanic names to Anglicized versions... ~~~~ --&gt;

Historically, this has been due to two causes: the German population was considered, whether factually or not, linked with German nationalist regimes such as those of the [[Nazis]] or [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]]. This was the case in the World War I era persecution of Germans in the [[United States]], and also in Eastern and Central Europe following the end of World War II.  While many victims of these persecutions did not, in fact, have any connection to those regimes, cooperation between German minority organisations and Nazi regime did occur, as the example of [[Selbstschutz]] shows, which is still used as a pretense of hostilities against those who did not take part in such organisations. After World War II, many such [[Volksdeutsche]] were killed or driven from their homes {{Who|date=December 2009}} in acts of vengeance, others in ethnic cleansing of territories prior to populating them with citizens of the annexing country.{{Where|date=July 2011}} In other cases (e.g. in the case of the formerly large German-speaking populations of Russia, Estonia, or the Transylvanian (Siebenbürgen) German minority in Rumania and the Balkans) such persecution was a crime committed against innocent communities who had played no part in the [[Third Reich]].

===Hazara people===
{{Main|Persecution of Hazara people}}
The [[Hazara people]] of central [[Afghanistan]] have been persecuted by [[Afghan]] rulers at various times in the history. Since the tragedy of 9/11, [[Sunni|Sunni Muslim]] [[terrorism|terrorists]] have been attacking the Hazara community in southwestern Pakistani town of [[Quetta]], home to some 500,000 Hazara who fled persecution in neighbouring Afghanistan. Some 2,400 men, women and children have been killed or wounded with [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] claiming responsibility for most of the attacks against the community. Consequently, many thousands have fled the country seeking [[asylum in Australia]].

===Roma===
{{Main|Antiziganism|Porajmos}}
Antiziganism is hostility, [[prejudice]], discrimination or [[racism]] directed against the [[Romani people]] as an ethnic group, or people who are perceived as being of Romani heritage.

The ''Porajmos'' was the planned and attempted effort, often described as a [[genocide]], during [[World War II]] by the government of [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies to exterminate the Romani (Gypsy) people of Europe. Under the rule of [[Adolf Hitler]], a supplementary decree to the [[Nuremberg Laws]] was issued on 26 November 1935, defining Gypsies as "enemies of the race-based state", the same category as Jews. Thus, the fate of Roma in Europe in some ways paralleled that of the Jews.&lt;ref name=USHMM_2&gt;{{cite web |title=Holocaust Encyclopedia - Genocide of European Roma (Gypsies), 1939-1945 |publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum (USHMM) |url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005219 |accessdate=9 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians estimate that 220,000 to 500,000 Romani were killed by the Nazis and their collaborators, or more than 25% of the slightly less than 1 million Roma in Europe at the time.&lt;ref name=USHMM_2/&gt; [[Ian Hancock]] puts the death toll as high as 1.5 million.&lt;ref name=Milton_estimates&gt;{{Citation |chapter=True Romanies and the Holocaust: A Re-evaluation and an overview |chapter-url=http://www.radoc.net/radoc.php?doc=art_e_holocaust_porrajmos&amp;lang=en&amp;articles= |author=Hancock, Ian |title=The Historiography of the Holocaust |isbn=1-4039-9927-9 |pages=383–396 |year=2005 |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rohingyas===
{{Seealso|2017 Rohingya persecution in Myanmar}}
The UN human rights chief slammed Myanmar's apparent "systematic attack" on the [[Rohingya]] minority, warning that "ethnic cleansing" seemed to be underway.
Ethnic Rohingya Muslims fleeing security forces in Myanmar’s Rakhine State have described killings, shelling, and arson in their villages that have all the hallmarks of a campaign of “ethnic cleansing,” Human Rights Watch said.
“Rohingya refugees have harrowing accounts of fleeing Burmese army attacks and watching their villages be destroyed,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia director. “Lawful operations against armed groups do not involve burning the local population out of their homes.” &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thedailystar.net/world/south-asia/atrocities-rohingyas-myanmar-have-hallmarks-ethnic-cleansing-hrw-1459276&lt;/ref&gt;

==Based on genetics==

===People with albinism===
{{Main|Persecution of people with albinism}}
Persecution on the basis of [[albinism]] is frequently based on the belief that albinos are inferior to persons with higher concentration of [[melanin]] in their skin. As a result, albinos have been persecuted, killed and dismembered, and graves of albinistic people dug up and desecrated. Such people have also been ostracized and even killed because they are presumed to bring ''bad'' luck in some areas.  Haiti also has a long history of treating albinistic people as accursed, with the highest incidence under the influence of [[François Duvalier|François "Papa Doc" Duvalier]].

==Of people with autism==
{{Main|Persecution of people with autism}}
People with [[autism spectrum disorder]]s have commonly been victims of persecution, both throughout history and in the present era. In [[Cameroon]] children with autism are commonly accused of [[witchcraft]] and singled out for torture and even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africaontheblog.com/the-thin-line-between-autism-and-witchcraft-in-cameroon/|title=The Thin Line Between Autism and Witchcraft in Cameroon|date=11 April 2014|website=africaontheblog.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icare4autism.org/news/2010/07/children-with-autism-branded-as-witches/|title=Autism Services - New York - ICare4Autism|website=Autism Services - New York - ICare4Autism|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it is speculated that many of the disabled children murdered during [[Action T4]] in [[Nazi Germany]] may have been autistic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.plos.org/yoursay/2015/11/02/neurotribes-steve-silberman-on-a-haunting-history-and-new-hope-for-autistic-people/|title=NeuroTribes, Steve Silberman on a haunting history and new hope for autistic people - Your Say|website=Your Say|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making autistic people among the first victims of [[The Holocaust]].

==LGBT==
{{Globalize|section|date=July 2017}}

A number of countries, especially those in the [[Western world]], have passed measures to alleviate discrimination against [[sexual minorities]], including laws against anti-gay [[hate crimes]] and [[workplace discrimination]]. Some have also legalized [[same-sex marriage]] or [[civil union]]s in order to grant same-sex couples the same protections and benefits as opposite-sex couples. In 2011, the [[United Nations]] passed its first resolution recognizing [[LGBT rights by country or territory|LGBT rights]] and, in 2015, same-sex marriage was legalized in all states of the [[United States]].

==Based on military service==
Persecution on the basis of army service (or the lack of it) operates in [[Israeli society]]. In the [[State of Israel]], Jewish citizens who receive an exemption from [[Conscription in Israel | service]] in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] cannot take up many prestigious career options, especially in the field of [[security (disambiguation) | security]]. The root of discrimination on the basis of army service lies in the practice that at age 17, non-Arab citizens (including [[Druze]]) are called up to be examined for eligibility to [[compulsory military service]]. A record for each potential conscript is made. Those who actually serve in the military are distinguished from those rejected from service by a Discharge Card, which has additional information on it, including the soldier's rank, military profession, and behavior during army service. Potential employers show a particular interest in Discharge Cards, since they constitute a universally available source of information about a potential employee. Employers frequently look down upon  citizens rejected from the army, typically believing that "those who are unfit for army service are also unfit for the work environment",{{cn|date=September 2016}} and that  those who succeeded in the army are also likely to become good employees. Job advertisements in Israel very frequently specify a requirement of "Full Army Service", thus the decisions taken by the draft board regarding a 17-year-old minor may affect entire careers.

In fiction, [[Robert A. Heinlein]] depicts a society where [[suffrage]] rights depend on military service in his 1959 novel ''[[Starship Troopers]].''

A '''pivot language''', sometimes also called a '''bridge language''', is an [[artificial language|artificial]] or [[natural language]] used as an intermediary language for translation between many different languages – to translate between any pair of languages A and B, one translates A to the pivot language P, then from P to B. Using a pivot language avoids the [[combinatorial explosion (communication)|combinatorial explosion]] of having translators across every combination of the supported languages, as the number of combinations of language is linear (&lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt;), rather than quadratic &lt;math&gt;\left(\textstyle{\binom{n}{2}}=\frac{n^2-n}{2}\right)&lt;/math&gt; – one need only know the language A and the pivot language P (and someone else the language B and the pivot P), rather than needing a different translator for every possible combination of A and B.

The disadvantage of a pivot language is that each step of retranslation introduces possible mistakes and ambiguities – using a pivot language involves two steps, rather than one. For example, when [[Hernán Cortés]] communicated with [[Mesoamerican]] Indians, he would speak Spanish to [[Gerónimo de Aguilar]], who would speak [[Mayan language|Mayan]] to [[Malintzin]], who would speak [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] to the locals.

== Examples ==
{{See also|Interlingual machine translation}}
[[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Russian language|Russian]], and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are often used as pivot languages.  [[Interlingua]] has been used as a pivot language in international conferences and has been proposed as a pivot language for the [[European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Breinstrup, Thomas. "Linguaphobos? Non in le UE". [Linguaphobes? Not in the EU]. ''[[Panorama in Interlingua]]'', 2006, Issue 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Esperanto]] was proposed as a pivot language in the [[Distributed Language Translation]] project and has been used in this way in the Majstro Tradukvortaro at the Esperanto website [http://www.majstro.com/ Majstro.com].  The [[Universal Networking Language]] is an artificial language specifically designed for use as a pivot language.

== In computing ==
{{see also|Intermediate language|Data conversion#Pivotal conversion}}
Pivot coding is also a common method of translating data for computer systems.  For example, the [[internet protocol]], [[XML]] and [[high level language]]s are pivot codings of computer data which are then often rendered into internal binary formats for particular computer systems.

[[Unicode]] was designed to be usable as a pivot coding between various major existing character encodings, though its widespread adoption as a coding in its own right has made this usage unimportant.

== In machine translation (MT) ==
Current statistical machine translation ([[Statistical machine translation|SMT]]) systems use [[parallel corpora]] for source (s) and target (t) languages to achieve their good results, but good parallel corpora are not available for all languages. A pivot language (p) enables the bridge between two languages, to which existing parallel corpora are entirely or partially not yet at hand.

Pivot translation can be problematic because of the potential lack of fidelity of the information forwarded in the use of different corpora. From the use of two bilingual corpora (s-p &amp; p-t) to set up the s-t bridge, linguistic data are inevitably lost. Rule-based machine translation ([[RBMT]]) helps the system rescue this information, so that the system does not rely entirely on statistics but also on structural linguistic information.

Three basic techniques are used to employ pivot language in MT: (1) ''triangulation'', which focuses on phrase paralleling between source and pivot (s-p) and between pivot and target (p-t); (2) ''[[Transfer-based machine translation|transfer]]'', which translates the whole sentence of the source language to a pivot language and then to the target language; and (3) ''synthesis'', which builds a corpus of its own for system training.

The '''triangulation''' method (also called ''phrase table multiplication'') calculates the probability of both translation correspondences and lexical weight in s-p and p-t, to try to induce a new s-t phrase table. The '''transfer''' method (also called ''sentence translation strategy'') simply carries a straightforward translation of s into p and then another translation of p into t without using probabilistic tests (as in triangulation). The '''synthetic''' method uses an existing corpus of s and tries to build an own synthetic corpus out of it that is used by the system to train itself. Then a bilingual s-p corpus is synthesized to enable a p-t translation.

A direct comparison between triangulation and transfer methods for SMT systems has shown that triangulation achieves much better results than transfer.

All three pivot language techniques enhance the performance of SMT systems. However, the ''synthetic'' technique  doesn't work well with RBMT, and systems' performances are lower than expected. Hybrid SMT/RBMT systems achieve better translation quality than strict-SMT systems that rely on bad parallel corpora.

The key role of RBMT systems is that they help fill the gap left in the translation process of s-p → p-t, in the sense that these parallels are included in the SMT model for s-t.

The concept of a '''random sequence''' is essential in [[probability theory]] and [[statistics]]. The concept generally relies on the notion of a [[sequence]] of [[random variable]]s and many statistical discussions begin with the words "let ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''X&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' be independent random variables...". Yet as [[D. H. Lehmer]] stated in 1951: "A random sequence is a vague notion... in which each term is unpredictable to the uninitiated and whose digits pass a certain number of tests traditional with statisticians".&lt;ref&gt;"What is meant by the word Random" in ''Mathematics and common sense'' by Philip J. Davis 2006 {{ISBN|1-56881-270-1}} pages 180-182&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Probability axioms|Axiomatic probability theory]] ''deliberately'' avoids a definition of a random sequence.&lt;ref&gt;''Inevitable Randomness in Discrete Mathematics'' by József Beck 2009 {{ISBN|0-8218-4756-2}} page 44&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional probability theory does not state if a specific sequence is random, but generally proceeds to discuss the properties of random variables and stochastic sequences assuming some definition of randomness. The [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki school]] considered the statement "let us consider a random sequence" an [[abuse of terminology|abuse of language]].&lt;ref&gt;''Algorithms: main ideas and applications'' by Vladimir Andreevich Uspenskiĭ, Alekseĭ, Lʹvovich Semenov 1993 Springer {{ISBN|0-7923-2210-X}} page 166&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early history==
[[Émile Borel]] was one of the first mathematicians to formally address randomness in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;E. Borel, ''Les probabilites denombrables et leurs applications arithmetique'' Rend. Circ. Mat. Palermo 27 (1909) 247-271&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 [[Richard von Mises]] gave the first definition of algorithmic randomness, which was inspired by the law of large numbers, although he used the term ''collective'' rather than random sequence. Using the concept of the [[impossibility of a gambling system]], von Mises defined an infinite sequence of zeros and ones as random if it is not biased by having the ''frequency stability property'' i.e. the frequency of zeros goes to 1/2 and every sub-sequence we can select from it by a "proper" method of selection is also not biased.&lt;ref&gt;Laurant Bienvenu "Kolmogorov Loveland Stochastocity" in STACS 2007: 24th Annual Symposium on Theoretical Aspects of Computer Science by Wolfgang Thomas {{ISBN|3-540-70917-7}} page 260&lt;/ref&gt;

The sub-sequence selection criterion imposed by von Mises is important, because although 0101010101... is not biased, by selecting the odd positions, we get 000000... which is not random. Von Mises never totally formalized his definition of a proper selection rule for sub-sequences, but in 1940 [[Alonzo Church]] defined it as any [[recursion#Functional recursion|recursive function]] which having read the first N elements of the sequence decides if it wants to select element number N+1. Church was a pioneer in the field of computable functions, and the definition he made relied on the [[Church Turing Thesis]] for computability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Church | first1 = Alonzo | authorlink = Alonzo Church | year = 1940 | title = On the Concept of Random Sequence | doi = 10.1090/S0002-9904-1940-07154-X| journal = Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. | volume = 46 | issue = | pages = 130–136 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is often called ''Mises-Church randomness''.

==Modern approaches==
During the 20th century various technical approaches to defining random sequences were developed and now three distinct paradigms can be identified. In the mid 1960s, [[A. N. Kolmogorov]] and [[D. W. Loveland]] independently proposed a more permissive selection rule.&lt;ref&gt;A. N. Kolmogorov, ''Three approaches to the quantitative definition of information'' Problems of Information and Transmission, 1(1):1--7, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Loveland, ''A new interpretation of von Mises' concept of random sequence'' Z. Math. Logik Grundlagen Math 12 (1966) 279-294&lt;/ref&gt; In their view Church's recursive function definition was too restrictive in that it read the elements in order. Instead they proposed a rule based on a partially computable process which having read ''any'' N elements of the sequence, decides if it wants to select another element which has not been read yet. This definition is often called ''Kolmogorov-Loveland stochasticity''. But this method was considered too weak by [[Alexander Shen]] who showed that there is a Kolmogorov-Loveland stochastic sequence which does not conform to the general notion of randomness.

In 1966 [[Per Martin-Löf]] introduced a new notion which is now generally considered the most satisfactory notion of [[algorithmic randomness]]. His original definition involved measure theory, but it was later shown that it can be expressed in terms of [[Kolmogorov complexity]]. Kolmogorov's definition of a random string was that it is random if has no description shorter than itself via a [[universal Turing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to Kolmogorov complexity and its applications'' by Ming Li, P. M. B. Vitányi 1997 0387948686 pages 149-151&lt;/ref&gt;

Three basic paradigms for dealing with random sequences have now emerged:&lt;ref&gt;R. Downey, ''Some Recent Progress in Algorithmic Randomness'' in Mathematical foundations of computer science 2004: by Jiří Fiala, Václav Koubek 2004 {{ISBN|3-540-22823-3}} page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The ''frequency / measure-theoretic'' approach. This approach started with the work of Richard von Mises and Alonzo Church. In the 1960s Per Martin-Löf noticed that the sets coding such frequency-based stochastic properties are a special kind of [[measure zero]] sets, and that a more general and smooth definition can be obtained by considering all effectively measure zero sets.

:* The ''complexity / compressibility'' approach. This paradigm was championed by A. N. Kolmogorov along with contributions Levin and [[Gregory Chaitin]]. For finite random sequences, Kolmogorov defined the "randomness" as the entropy, i.e. [[Kolmogorov complexity]], of a string of length K of zeros and ones as the closeness of its entropy to K, i.e. if the complexity of the string is close to K it is very random and if the complexity is far below K, it is not so random.

:* The ''predictability'' approach. This paradigm was due to [[Claus P. Schnorr]] and uses a slightly different definition of constructive [[Martingale (probability theory)|martingales]] than martingales used in traditional probability theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schnorr | first1 = C. P. | year = 1971 | title = A unified approach to the definition of a random sequence | url = | journal = Mathematical Systems Theory | volume = 5 | issue = 3| pages = 246–258 | doi=10.1007/bf01694181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schnorr showed how the existence of a selective betting strategy implied the existence of a selection rule for a biased sub-sequence. If one only requires a recursive martingale to succeed on a sequence instead of constructively succeeds on a sequence, then one gets the recursively randomness concepts. [[Yongge Wang]] showed&lt;ref&gt;Yongge Wang: Randomness and Complexity. PhD Thesis, 1996. http://webpages.uncc.edu/yonwang/papers/IPL97.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wang | first1 = Yongge | year = 1999 | title = A separation of two randomness concepts | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020019098002026 | journal = Information Processing Letters | volume = 69 | issue = 3| pages = 115–118 | doi=10.1016/S0020-0190(98)00202-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; that recursively randomness concept is different from Schnorr's randomness concepts.

In most cases, theorems relating the three paradigms (often equivalence) have been proven.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgan Merkel, ''Kolmogorov Loveland Stochasticity'' in Automata, languages and programming: 29th international colloquium, ICALP 2002, by Peter Widmayer et al. {{ISBN|3-540-43864-5}} page 391&lt;/ref&gt;

It is important to realize that for each of the definitions given above for infinite sequences, if one adds a billion zeros to the front of the random sequence the new sequence will still be considered random. Hence any application of these concepts to practical problems needs to be performed with care.&lt;ref&gt;''Algorithms: main ideas and applications'' by Vladimir Andreevich Uspenskiĭ, Alekseĭ, Lʹvovich Semenov 1993 Springer {{ISBN|0-7923-2210-X}} page 176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Origin histograma raw data.png|thumb|right|200px|The two columns to the right of the left-most column in this computerized table are raw data.]]
'''Raw data''', also known as '''primary data''', is [[data]] (e.g., numbers, instrument readings, figures, etc.) collected from a source. If a scientist sets up a computerized [[thermometer]] which records the temperature of a chemical mixture in a test tube every minute, the list of temperature readings for every minute, as printed out on a spreadsheet or viewed on a computer screen is "raw data".  Raw data has not been subjected to processing, "cleaning" by researchers to remove [[outlier]]s, obvious instrument reading errors or data entry errors, or any analysis (e.g., determining [[central tendency]] aspects such as the [[arithmetic mean|average]] or [[median]] result). As well, raw data has not been subject to any other manipulation by a software program or a human researcher, analyst or technician. It is also referred to as ''primary'' data. Raw data is a relative term (see [[data]]), because even once raw data has been "cleaned" and processed by one team of researchers, another team may consider this processed data to be "raw data" for another stage of research.  Raw data can be inputted to a [[computer program]] or used in manual procedures such as analyzing [[statistics]] from a [[statistical survey|survey]]. The term "raw data" can refer to the [[Binary number|binary]] data on electronic storage devices, such as hard disk drives (also referred to as "low-level data").

== Generating data ==
Data has two ways of being created or generated. The first is what is called 'captured data',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Data Revolution|last=Kitchin|first=Rob|publisher=Sage|year=2014|isbn=|location=United States|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is found through purposeful investigation or analysis. The second is called 'exhaust data',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and is gathered usually by machines or terminals as a secondary function. For example, cash registers, smartphones, and speedometers serve a main function but may collect data as a secondary task. Exhaustive data is usually too large or of little use to process and becomes 'transient'&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; or thrown away.

==Examples==
In [[computing]], raw data may have the following attributes: it may possibly contain human, machine, or instrument errors, it may not be validated; it might be in different areen ([[colloquial]]) formats; [[Code|uncoded]] or unformatted; or some entries might be "suspect" (e.g., [[outlier]]s), requiring [[confirmation]] or [[citation]]. For example, a data input sheet might contain dates as raw data in many forms: "31st January 1999", "31/01/1999", "31/1/99", "31 Jan", or "today". Once captured, this raw data may be [[Data processing|processed]] stored as a normalized format, perhaps a [[Julian date]], to make it easier for computers and humans to interpret during later processing. Raw data (sometimes colloquially called "sourcey" data or "eggy" data, the latter a reference to the data being "uncooked", that is, "unprocessed", like a raw [[egg]]) are the data input to processing. A distinction is  made between ''data'' and ''information'', to the effect that information is the ''end'' product of ''data'' processing. Raw data that has undergone processing are sometimes referred to as "cooked" data in a colloquial sense.{{dubious|date=September 2016}}  Although raw data has the potential to be transformed into "[[information]],"  extraction, organization, analysis and formatting for presentation are required before raw data can be transformed into usable information.

For example, a [[point-of-sale terminal]] (POS terminal, a computerized [[cash register]]) in a busy supermarket collects huge volumes of raw data each day about customers' purchases. However, this list of grocery items and their prices and the time and date of purchase does not yield much information until it is processed. Once processed and analyzed by a [[software program]] or even by a researcher using a pen and paper and a [[calculator]], this raw data may indicate the particular items that each customer buys, when they buy them, and at what price; as well, an analyst or manager could calculate the average total sales per customer or the average expenditure per day of the week by hour. This processed and analyzed data provides information for the manager, that the manager could then use to help her determine, for example, how many cashiers to hire and at what times.  Such ''information'' could then become ''data'' for further processing, for example as part of a predictive [[marketing]] campaign. As a result of processing, raw data sometimes ends up being put in a [[database]], which enables the raw data to become accessible for further processing and analysis in any number of different ways.

[[Tim Berners-Lee]] (inventor of the [[World Wide Web]]) argues that sharing raw data is important for society.  [http://www.w3.org/2009/Talks/0204-ted-tbl/#(34) Inspired] by [http://blog.okfn.org/2007/11/07/give-us-the-data-raw-and-give-it-to-us-now/ a post] by [[Rufus Pollock]] of the [[Open Knowledge Foundation]] his call to action is [http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/tim_berners_lee_on_the_next_web.html "Raw Data Now"], meaning that everyone should demand that governments and businesses share the data they collect as raw data. He points out that "data drives a huge amount of what happens in our lives… because somebody takes the data and does something with it." To Berners-Lee, it is essentially from this sharing of raw data, that advances in science will emerge. Advocates of [[open data]] argue that once citizens and civil society organizations have access to data from businesses and governments, it will enable citizens and NGOs to do their ''own'' analysis of the data, which can empower people and civil society. For example, a government may claim that its policies are reducing the [[unemployment rate]], but a [[poverty]] advocacy group may be able to have its staff [[econometrics|econometricians]] do their own analysis of the raw data, which may lead this group to draw different conclusions about the data set.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4668">The '''Rokeach Value Survey''' ('''RVS''') is a [[value (personal and cultural)|value]]s classification instrument. Developed by social psychologist [[Milton Rokeach]], the instrument is designed for rank-order scaling of 36 values, including  18 terminal 18 instrumental values.&lt;ref name=Rokeach73&gt;{{cite book|last=Rokeach|first=Milton|date=1973|title=The Nature of Human Values|location=New York|publisher=The Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The task for participants in the survey is to arrange the 18 terminal values, followed by the 18 instrumental values, into an order "of importance to YOU, as guiding principles in YOUR life".&lt;ref name=Rokeach73/&gt;{{rp|27}}

The RVS has been studied in the context of [[personality psychology]], [[Behaviorism|behavior]], [[marketing]], [[social structure]] and [[cross-cultural studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Bojan|last1=Musil|first2=Velko S.|last2=Rus|first3=Janek|last3=Musek|title=The Rokeach Value Survey in comparative study of Japanese and Slovenian students: Towards the Underlying Structure|journal=Studia Psychologica|volume=51|issue=1|pages=53–68|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Johnston&gt;{{cite journal|last=Johnston|first=Charles S.|date=1995|title= The Rokeach Value Survey: Underlying structure and multidimensional scaling|journal=Journal of Psychology|volume= 129|issue=5|pages=583–597}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a number of attempts to reduce the 18 instrumental values and 18 terminal values into a set of underlying factors, but without consistent success. Attempts have included that by Feather and Peay in 1975&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Feather|first1=N. T.|last2=Peay|first2=E. R.|date=1975|title=The structure of terminal and instrumental values: Dimensions and clusters|journal=Australian Journal of Psychology|volume=27|issue=2|pages=151–164}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Charles Johnston in 1995.&lt;ref name=Johnston/&gt;

Rokeach's RVS is based on a 1968 volume (''Beliefs, Attitudes, and Values'') which presented the philosophical basis for the association of fundamental values with [[belief]]s and [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rokeach|first=Milton|date=1968|title=Beliefs, attitudes, and values: A theory of organization and change|location=San Francisco, CA|publisher=Jossey-Bass}}&lt;/ref&gt; His value system was instrumentalised into the Rokeach Value Survey in his 1973 book ''The Nature of Human Values''.&lt;ref name=Rokeach73/&gt;

==Terminal Values==
'''Terminal Values''' refer to desirable end-states of existence. These are the goals that a person would like to achieve during his or her lifetime. These values vary among different groups of people in different cultures.

'''The terminal values in RVS are:''' 
{{colbegin}}
#True [[Friendship]]
#Mature [[Love]]
#Self-Respect
#[[Happiness]]
#Inner Harmony
#Equality
#[[Freedom]]
#[[Pleasure]]
#Social Recognition
#[[Wisdom]]
#[[Salvation]]
#Family Security
#[[National Security]]
#A Sense of Accomplishment
#A World of [[Beauty]]
#A World at [[World Peace|Peace]]
#A Comfortable Life
#An Exciting Life
{{colend}}

==Instrumental Values==
'''Instrumental Values''' refer to preferable modes of behavior. These are preferable modes of behavior, or means of achieving the terminal values.

'''The Instrumental Values are:''' 
{{colbegin}}
#Cheerfulness
#Ambition
#[[Love]]
#Cleanliness
#Self-Control
#Capability
#[[Courage]]
#Politeness
#[[Honesty]]
#[[Imagination]]
#[[Independence]]
#Intellect
#Broad-Mindedness
#[[Logic]]
#Obedience
#Helpfulness
#[[Personal responsibility|Responsibility]]
#[[Forgiveness]]
{{colend}}

==Criticisms==
Keith Gibbons and Iain Walker question whether the values included in the RVS are the ones that are critical. They argue that Rokeach, who started with several hundred values suggested by 130 individuals and a literature review, had an inadequate criteria for reducing the values. They also questioned the validity of Rockeach's measures, suggesting that when people rank the values they may not even be ranking the same referents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Keith|last1=Gibbins|first2=Iain|last2=Walker|journal=Journal of Social Psychology|date=December 1993|volume=133|issue=6|pages=797–805|title=Multiple Interpretations of the Rokeach Value Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SOGLogo1a.jpg|thumb|Sea of Faith logo.]]
The '''Sea of Faith Network''' ('''SoF''') is an organisation with the stated aim to explore and promote  religious faith as a human creation.

==History==
The SoF movement started in 1984 as a response to [[Don Cupitt]]'s book and [[Sea of Faith (TV series)|television series]], both titled ''Sea of Faith''.&lt;ref name="Bill Cooke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooke|first=Bill|title=Dictionary of Atheism, Skepticism, and Humanism|year=2005|publisher=Prometheus Books|location=Amherst NY|isbn=978-1591022992|pages=470|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sA6_jqohqRUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cupitt was educated in both science and theology at the University of Cambridge in the 1950s, and is a philosopher, theologian, [[Anglican]] priest, and former Dean of [[Emmanuel College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Cupitt: Life Fellow and former Dean of Emmanuel College Cambridge, England|url=http://www.westarinstitute.org/Fellows/cupitt.html|publisher=Westar Institute|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book and TV series, he surveyed western thinking about religion and charted a transition from traditional realist religion to the  view that religion is simply a human creation.&lt;ref name="Jeremy Stangroom"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stangroom|first1=Jeremy|last2=Baggini|first2=Julian|authorlink1=Jeremy Stangroom|authorlink2=Julian Baggini|title=What Philosophers Think|year=2005|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|location=London|isbn=978-0826484741|pages=95–104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P6jT10cRPXQC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Sea of Faith is taken from [[Matthew Arnold]]'s nostalgic mid 19th century poem "[[Dover Beach]]", in which the poet expresses regret that belief in a supernatural world is slowly slipping away; the "sea of faith" is withdrawing like the ebbing tide.&lt;ref name="Don Cupitt sea of faith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cupitt|first=Don|title=The Sea of Faith|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521344203|pages=21–22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SCXcdgWck_8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=don+cupitt+dover+beach&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fLrsUL3zC6j22gWH_YGICw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the television series, a small group of radical Christian clergy and laity began meeting to explore how they might promote this new understanding of religious faith. Starting with a mailing list of 143 sympathisers, they organised the first UK conference in 1988.&lt;ref name="Peter B. Clarke"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=Peter B.|title=Encyclopedia Of New Religious Movements|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York|isbn=978-0415453837|pages=595}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second conference was held in the following year shortly after which the SoF Network was officially launched. Annual national conferences have been a key event of the network ever since.&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network: Key facts"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network: Key facts|url=http://www.thatreligiousstudieswebsite.com/Religious_Studies/Phil_of_Rel/Atheism_Agnosticism/sea_of_faith_network.php|work=That Religious Studies Website|publisher=Pelusa Media Group|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Sea Of Faith Network holds national and regional conferences and promotional events each year. There is an active network of local groups who meet regularly for discussion and exploration.&lt;ref name=sofn&gt;[http://www.sofn.org.uk/ Sea of Faith Network] retrieved 21 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's magazine ''Sofia'' is published bi-monthly in the United Kingdom. It has a circulation beyond the SoF membership. The group also maintains a web site and an on-line discussion group.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

Currently there are national networks in the UK, New Zealand and Australia with scattered membership in the USA, Northern Ireland, South Africa, France and The Netherlands. The world-wide membership, as of 2004, stood at about 2,000. Each national network is run by a steering committee elected from its members.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

==Beliefs==
SoF has no official creed or statement of belief to which members are required to assent, seeing itself as a loose network rather than a formal religious movement or organisation. Its stated aim is to "explore and promote religious faith as a human creation".&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are|url=http://www.sofn.org.uk/sof/who_we_are.html|publisher=Sea of Faith Network|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this it spans a broad spectrum of faith positions from uncompromising non-realism at one end to critical realism at the other.&lt;ref name="The Sea of Faith Network - Who we are" /&gt;  Some members describe themselves as on the liberal or radical wing of conventional belief (see [[liberal Christianity]]) while others choose to call themselves [[religious humanism|religious]] or [[Christian humanism|Christian humanists]] (see [[humanism]]). Some even refer to themselves as agnostic, atheist, or simply nontheist (see [[Christian atheism]]).

SoF possesses no religious writings or ceremonies of its own; many members remain active in their own religion (mainly but not exclusively Christian) while others have no religious affiliation at all.&lt;ref name=sofn/&gt;

==Philosophy==
A number of commentators have identified SoF as closely associated with the non-realist approach to religion.&lt;ref name="andrew moore"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Andrew|title=Realism and Christian Faith: God, Grammar, and Meaning|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0521524155|pages=108|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54AgRQ0QbZIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cathey&gt;{{cite book|last=Cathey|first=Robert Andrew|title=God In Postliberal Perspective: Between Realism and Non-Realism|year=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|location=Burlington VT|isbn=978-0754616801|pages=188|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vLkVppp6cfcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This refers to the belief that God has no "real", objective, or empirical existence, independent of human language and culture; God is "real" in the sense that he is a potent symbol, metaphor or projection, but he has no objective existence outside and beyond the practice of religion.&lt;ref name="peter mullen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mullen|first=Peter|title=Faith and Reason Cupitt's arrows lie blunted by the reality of reasoned discussion|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/faith-and-reason-cupitts-arrows-lie-blunted-by-the-reality-of-reasoned-discussion-1391036.html|accessdate=9 January 2013|newspaper=The Independent|date=31 Dec 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Non-realism therefore entails a rejection of all supernaturalism, including concepts such as miracles, the afterlife, and the agency of spirits.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Sea of Faith Network|url=http://www.stoa.org.uk/topics/sof/sea-of-faith-network.html|publisher=Faversham Stoa|accessdate=9 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founder's influence==
Since he began writing in 1971, Cupitt has produced 36 books. During this time his views have continued to evolve and change.&lt;ref name="nigel leaves"&gt;{{cite book|last=Leaves|first=Nigel|title=Odyssey on the Sea of Faith: The Life &amp; Writings of Don Cupitt|year=2004|publisher=Polebridge Press|location=Santa Rosa CA|isbn=978-0944344620|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his early books such as ''Taking Leave of God'' and ''The Sea of Faith'' Cupitt talks of God alone as non-real,&lt;ref name="Don Cupitt on Non-Realism About God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Cupitt on Non-Realism About God|url=http://philosophybites.com/2008/11/don-cupitt-on-nonrealism-about-god.html|work=philosophy bites|publisher=Institute of Philosophy|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by the end of the 1980s he moved into [[postmodernism]], describing his position as empty radical humanism:&lt;ref name="About Non-Realism"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Non-Realism|url=http://www.doncupitt.com/non-realism|publisher=Don Cupitt|accessdate=4 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; that is, there is nothing but our language, our world, and the meanings, truths and interpretations that we have generated.

While Cupitt was the founding influence of SoF and is much respected for his work for the network, it would not be true to say that he is regarded as a guru or leader of SoF. Members are free to dissent from his views and Cupitt himself has argued strongly that SoF should never be a fan club.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt;  Both Cupitt and the network emphasise the importance of autonomous critical thought and reject authoritarianism in all forms.&lt;ref name="faversham stoa" /&gt;

'''Section&amp;nbsp;116 of the [[Constitution of Australia]]''' precludes the Commonwealth of Australia (''i.e.'', the federal parliament) from making laws for establishing any religion, imposing any religious observance, or prohibiting the free exercise of any religion. Section&amp;nbsp;116 also provides that no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth. The product of a compromise in the pre-[[Federation of Australia|Federation]] constitutional conventions, Section&amp;nbsp;116 is based on similar provisions in the [[United States Constitution]]. However, Section&amp;nbsp;116 is more narrowly drafted than its US counterpart, and does not preclude the [[States and territories of Australia|states of Australia]] from making such laws.

Section&amp;nbsp;116 has been interpreted narrowly by the [[High Court of Australia]]: while the definition of "religion" adopted by the court is broad and flexible, the scope of the protection of religions is circumscribed. The result of the court's approach has been that no court has ever ruled a law to be in contravention of Section&amp;nbsp;116, and the provision has played only a minor role in [[Constitutional history of Australia|Australian constitutional history]]. Among the laws that the High Court has ruled not to be in contravention of Section&amp;nbsp;116 are laws that provided government funding to religious schools, that authorised the [[Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses v Commonwealth|dissolution of a branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses]], and that enabled the forcible removal of [[Indigenous Australian]] children from their families.

[[Federal Government of Australia|Federal Governments]] have twice proposed the amendment of Section&amp;nbsp;116, principally to apply its provisions to laws made by the states. On each occasion—in [[Australian referendum, 1944|1944]] and [[Australian referendum, 1988 (Rights and Freedoms)|1988]]—the proposal failed in a referendum.

==Text of the provision and location in the Constitution==

Section&amp;nbsp;116 states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Commonwealth shall not make any law for establishing any religion, or for imposing any religious observance, or for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion, and no religious test shall be required as a qualification for any office or public trust under the Commonwealth.&lt;ref name="Constitution"&gt;{{Cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|coaca430|Constitution|116}} Commonwealth not to legislate in respect of religion&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section&amp;nbsp;116 has four limbs.  The first three limbs prohibit the Commonwealth from making certain laws: laws "for establishing any religion"; laws "for imposing any religious observance"; and laws "for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion".  The fourth limb proscribes the imposition of religious tests to qualify for any Commonwealth office or public trust.&lt;ref name="Williams1165"&gt;{{Harvnb|Blackshield &amp; Williams|2010|p=1165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the "establishing religion" and "prohibiting free exercise" limbs have been the subject of cases before the High Court.&lt;ref name="Williams1165"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanks1207"/&gt;

The section sits in Chapter V of the Constitution, which deals with the states of Australia.  However, Section&amp;nbsp;116 does not apply to the states.&lt;ref name="Hanks1207"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each state has its own constitution, and only Tasmania's has a provision similar to Section&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blake|2009|p=287}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators attribute the erroneous location of Section&amp;nbsp;116 to a drafting oversight caused by the weariness of the committee charged with finalising the draft Constitution.&lt;ref name="Hanks1207"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|La Nauze|1972|p=228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Hbhiggins.jpg|thumb|left|[[H. B. Higgins]], proponent of Section&amp;nbsp;116 in the pre-Federation constitutional conventions|alt=A black and white portrait of [[H. B. Higgins]]]]

The Constitution was the product of a series of constitutional conventions in the 1890s. The issues of religious freedom and secularism were not prominent in the convention debates, which focused on the economic and legislative powers of the proposed Commonwealth parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first draft of Section&amp;nbsp;116, approved by the Melbourne Convention of 1891, would have prohibited the states from passing laws prohibiting the free exercise of religion. The Commonwealth was not mentioned because it was assumed that the Commonwealth parliament would have no power to make such laws.&lt;ref name="QG"&gt;{{Harvnb|Quick &amp; Garran|1901|p=951}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Melbourne Convention of 1897, Victorian delegate [[H. B. Higgins]] expressed concern about this assumption and moved to expand the provision to cover the Commonwealth as well as the states.&lt;ref name="QG"/&gt; The amendment was initially defeated, but Higgins later succeeded in having the eventual version of Section&amp;nbsp;116 adopted by the convention in a 25–16 vote.&lt;ref name="QG"/&gt; Higgins feared opposition to the provision from convention delegates concerned that the provision would impede the states' legislative powers, so the version passed by the convention did not mention the states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|2002|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposed inclusion of Section&amp;nbsp;116 in the Constitution was the subject of some dissent in the 1897 Melbourne Convention and the final convention in 1898.  Protestant churches in New South Wales argued that the Constitution should state that divine providence is the "ultimate source of law", while convention delegates [[John Quick (politician)|John Quick]] and [[Patrick Glynn]] moved to have God explicitly recognised in the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|p=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] campaigned for a strict separation of church and state, being concerned that the Commonwealth might prohibit its members from working on Sundays.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|pp=218–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides to some extent achieved their objectives: Section&amp;nbsp;116 was approved by the final convention, while Glynn successfully moved for the symbolic mention of "Almighty God" in the preamble to the British statute that was to contain the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McLeish|1992|pp=218–220}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution was then approved by popular referendums in each of the six colonies and took effect on 1 January 1901 (the colonies thus became the states of Australia).&lt;ref name="Constitution"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Irving|1999|pp=415–416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section&amp;nbsp;116 reflects two provisions of the [[United States Constitution]]: the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], which prohibits the making of laws for the establishment of religion and guarantees the free exercise of religion; and [[Article Six of the United States Constitution|Article&amp;nbsp;VI]], Section&amp;nbsp;3, which [[No religious test clause|prohibits the imposition of religious tests]] for public offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cumbrae-Stewart|1946|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bailey"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bailey|1951|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academic Clifford L. Pannam, writing in 1963, called Section&amp;nbsp;116 a "fairly blatant piece of transcription" of its US counterparts.&lt;ref name="Pannam41"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pannam|1963|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in practice, Section&amp;nbsp;116 has been interpreted more narrowly than the US provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|pp=163–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial consideration==

The High Court's consideration of Section&amp;nbsp;116 has generally been limited to three areas: the definition of "religion"; the meaning of "law for establishing any religion"; and the meaning of "law for prohibiting the free exercise of any religion".&lt;ref name="Hanks1209"/&gt;  The two other elements of the provision—the clauses prohibiting the Commonwealth from imposing of religious observance and from prescribing religious tests for public offices—have not been the subject of any cases before the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Villalta Puig &amp; Tudor|2009|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court has never ruled a legislative provision to be in contravention of Section&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1228}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the court's narrow and literal interpretation of Section&amp;nbsp;116, the provision has played a minor role in Australian constitutional history.&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{Harvnb|Williams|1994|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meaning of "religion"===

A threshold test considered by courts applying Section 116 is whether a belief seeking constitutional protection is a "religion".&lt;ref name="Hanks1209"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1209}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leading authority on the question is the 1983 judgment of the High Court in ''Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic)''.&lt;ref name="Church of New Faith"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|1983|litigants=Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic) |parallelcite=(1953) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 120 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The court found that [[Scientology]] was a religion, despite some justices commenting that its practices were "impenetrably obscure". In reaching this finding, the court argued that the definition of religion needed to be flexible but should recognise the need to be sceptical of disingenous claims of religious practice.&lt;ref name="Hanks1209"/&gt; Justices [[Anthony Mason (judge)|Anthony Mason]] and [[Gerard Brennan]] held:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;the criteria of religion [are] twofold: first, belief in a supernatural, Being, Thing or Principle; and second, the acceptance of canons of conduct in order to give effect to that belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|1983|litigants=Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic) |parallelcite=(1953) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 120 |courtname=auto}} per Mason and Brennan JJ at para. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Justices [[Ronald Wilson]] and [[William Deane]] were less prescriptive, setting out five "indicia" of a religion: a belief in the supernatural; a belief in ideas relating to "man's nature and place in the universe"; the adherence to particular standards, codes of conduct or practices by those who hold the ideas; the existence of an identifiable group of believers, even if not a formal organisation; and the opinion of the believers that what they believe in constitutes a religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|pp=1209–1210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|40|1983|litigants=Church of the New Faith v Commissioner for Pay-Roll Tax (Vic) |parallelcite=(1953) 154 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 120 |courtname=auto}} per Wilson and Deane JJ at para. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Establishing any religion"===

The courts have taken a narrow approach to the interpretation of the prohibition against "establishing any religion", deriving from the 1981 case of ''[[Attorney-General (Vic) (Ex rel Black) v Commonwealth]]'' (the ''DOGS'' case),&lt;ref name="DOGS HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|2|1981|litigants=[[Attorney-General (Vic); Ex Rel Black v Commonwealth]] ("DOGS case") |parallelcite=(1981) 146 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 559 |date=2 February 1981 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in which the High Court held that Commonwealth funding of religious schools did not contravene Section&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|pp=143–145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[Garfield Barwick]] held that a law would only contravene the provision if establishing a religion was its "express and single purpose", while Justice [[Harry Gibbs]] argued that the section only prohibits the establishment of an official state religion.  Each justice in the majority contrasted Section&amp;nbsp;116 with its equivalent in the US Constitution to find that Section&amp;nbsp;116 is narrower. The court noted that the US Constitution prohibits laws respecting "establishment of religion" generally, whereas the prohibition in Section&amp;nbsp;116 is against the establishment of "''any'' religion": this meant that Section&amp;nbsp;116 did not encompass laws that benefit religions generally; it only proscribed laws that established a particular religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|pp=143–144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach of the High Court to the establishment limb of Section&amp;nbsp;116 thus largely reflects the views expressed by Constitutional scholars [[John Quick (politician)|John Quick]] and [[Robert Garran]] in 1901, that establishment means "the erection and recognition of a State Church, or the concession of special favours, titles, and advantages to one church which are denied to others."&lt;ref name="QG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Prohibiting the free exercise of any religion"===

The protection of the free exercise of religion was also interpreted narrowly in early High Court judgments.&lt;ref name="Hanks12171218"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|pp=1217–1218}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912, the court in ''Krygger v Williams'',&lt;ref name="Krygger"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|65|1912|litigants=Krygger v Williams |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1912/65.pdf (1912) 15 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 366] |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; held that a person could not object to compulsory military service on the ground of religious belief.&lt;ref name="Hanks12171218"/&gt; The court considered that Section&amp;nbsp;116 would only protect religious observance from government interference; it would not permit a person to be excused from a legal obligation merely because the obligation conflicted with his or her religious beliefs. In a 1929 case, Higgins, then a Justice of the High Court, suggested (as ''[[obiter dictum]]'') that a person could lawfully object to [[compulsory voting]] on the grounds of religious belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1218}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 1943, the court continued the narrow approach it took in ''Krygger v Williams'', upholding war-time regulations that caused the [[Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses v Commonwealth|Adelaide branch of the Jehovah's Witnesses]] to be dissolved and have its property acquired by the Commonwealth government. The government had declared the branch to be an organisation whose activities were "prejudicial to the defence of the Commonwealth": one of the branch's professed beliefs was that the government was an "organ of [[Satan]]". Chief Justice [[John Latham (judge)|John Latham]] held that the Constitution permitted the court to "reconcile religious freedom with ordered government".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|pp=1218–1223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|12|1943|litigants=Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses Incorporated v Commonwealth |link=Adelaide Company of Jehovah's Witnesses v Commonwealth |parallelcite=[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1943/12.pdf (1943) 67 {{abbr|CLR|Commonwealth Law Reports}} 116] |courtname=auto}} per Latham CJ at para. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1997 case known as the [[Kruger v Commonwealth|''Stolen Generations Case'']],&lt;ref name="Stolen HCA"&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|27|1997|litigants=[[Kruger v Commonwealth]] (Stolen Generations case) |parallelcite=(1997) 190 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 1 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the court upheld an ordinance issued in 1918 that enabled the forcible removal of [[Indigenous Australian]] children from their families. The court reasoned that the purpose of the ordinance was not to prohibit the free exercise of religion even though the ordinance may have had that effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|pp=1223–1224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Edge, an academic specialising in religion and the law, thus concludes that Section&amp;nbsp;116 will only "prevent legislation that has a prohibited purpose, rather than a prohibited effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Edge|2006|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her judgment, Gaudron J, while finding that the provision 'cannot be construed as impliedly conferring an independent or free-standing right which, if breached, sounds in damages at the suit of the individual whose interests are thereby affected' left open the possibility that it might nonetheless, in limiting Commonwealth legislative power, apply to a provision that has the effect, as opposed merely to the purpose, of limiting free exercise.&lt;ref name="Stolen HCA"/&gt;

==Commentary==

When the Constitution took effect in 1901, Quick and Garran argued that Section&amp;nbsp;116 was redundant as the Commonwealth had not been given the legislative power under [[Section 51 of the Australian Constitution|Section&amp;nbsp;51]] to establish a religion or prohibit its free exercise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Quick &amp; Garran|1901|p=952}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Pannam wrote that the provision was regarded "by all as having little practical value". Pannam considered the provision would only become significant if the High Court held that it applied to laws made by governments of the territories.&lt;ref name="Pannam41"/&gt;

Constitutional scholar [[George Williams (lawyer)|George Williams]], writing in 1994, criticised the court's literal interpretation of the provision and others in the Constitution, saying the court has "transformed the Constitution into a wasteland of civil liberties". Williams argues that as an "express guarantee of personal freedom", the provision should be interpreted broadly and promote "individual liberty over the arbitrary exercise of legislative and executive power".&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt; Academics Gonzalo Villalta Puig and Steven Tudor have called for the court to broaden Section&amp;nbsp;116 by finding in it an implied right to the freedom of thought and conscience. In their view most Australians correctly "believe that the Constitution protects the right to freedom of thought and conscience just like it protects other civil and political freedoms", and that the court should give effect to that belief. They argue there is precedent for the court finding implied constitutional rights, such as the 1992 case of ''[[Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AustLII|HCA|45|1992|litigants=[[Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth]] |parallelcite=(1992) 177 [[Commonwealth Law Reports|CLR]] 106 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; where the court found that the Constitution guaranteed the freedom of political communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Villalta Puig &amp; Tudor|2009|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In defence of Section&amp;nbsp;116 and the High Court's interpretation of it, Joshua Puls argues that the provision is appropriately limited, suggesting that a rigid "wall of separation" between religion and the state is undesirable, and that the stronger Constitutional protection of religion in the United States has become overly politicised.&lt;ref name="Puls 1998 160" /&gt; Fellow academics Jennifer Clarke, Patrick Keyzer and James Stellios argue that the court's narrow interpretation of the provision is consistent with the intention of the Constitution's drafters, who never intended for it to be a protection of individual rights,&lt;ref name="Hanks1227"&gt;{{Harvnb|Clarke, Keyzer &amp; Stellios|2009|p=1227}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Kevin Booker and Arthur Glass say the provision has "symbolic value".

{{See also |Australian referendum, 1944 |Australian referendum, 1988 (Rights and Freedoms)}}
Federal governments have twice proposed [[Referendums in Australia|referendums]] to expand the scope of Section&amp;nbsp;116: in 1944 and in 1988. In 1944, [[John Curtin]]'s [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government put a package of measures, known as the "Fourteen Powers referendum", to the Australian public. The purpose of the package was mainly to widen the Commonwealth's legislative powers for the purposes of post-war reconstruction. The widening of powers would [[sunset provision|sunset]] after five years. One of the measures in the package was to extend Section&amp;nbsp;116 so that it prohibited the states, not merely the Commonwealth, from making the laws proscribed by the section.&lt;ref name="Bailey"/&gt; The package's 14 measures—which included diverse matters such as powers to provide family allowances and legislate for "national health"—were bound together in a single question. [[H. V. Evatt]], the Labor [[Attorney-General of Australia|Attorney-General]], argued that [[freedom of religion]] was "fundamental to the whole idea of democracy" and that the suppression of civil rights by dictatorships in Europe demonstrated the need for Australia to have a strong Constitutional guarantee of the freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Galligan |1995 |p=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative [[United Australia Party]], then in opposition and led by [[Robert Menzies]], campaigned against the package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Nethercote |2001 |p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Fadden]], leader of the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]], claimed a "yes" vote would permit the government to implement a "policy of socialisation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6UwQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=75QDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7101,5695609&amp;hl=en |title=Country Party's "No" Campaign |date=25 July 1944 |work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |accessdate=10 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The package was rejected: the national "yes" vote was less than 46 per cent, and there was majority support for the package only in South Australia and Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/referendums/Referendum_Dates_and_Results.htm |title=Referendum Dates and Results 1906 – present |work=[[Australian Electoral Commission]] |accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reason for the rejection was the bundling of multiple controversial proposals into one question: voters could not vote in favour of the measures they supported and against those they opposed, giving them reason to vote against the entire package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bennett |first=Scott |title=Constitutional Referenda in Australia |publisher=Department of the Parliamentary Library, Parliament of Australia |location=Canberra |year=1999 |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1999-2000/2000rp02.htm#ACCOUNT |accessdate=2 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207163730/http://www.aph.gov.au/library/pubs/rp/1999-2000/2000rp02.htm#ACCOUNT |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar proposal to amend Section&amp;nbsp;116 was put to the Australian people in a referendum in 1988. The referendum contained four questions, the last of which sought to amend Section&amp;nbsp;116 and other constitutional "rights and freedoms". Again, the proposal was initiated by a Labor government (under [[Bob Hawke]]); again, the proposal was opposed by the conservative parties;&lt;ref name="Frozen Continent"/&gt; and again, multiple controversial proposals were bound into one question, being "to alter the Constitution to extend the right to trial by jury, to extend freedom of religion, and to ensure fair terms for persons whose property is acquired by any government." The proposal in respect of Section&amp;nbsp;116 was to extend its operation to the states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=tq9EAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fZYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5910,5678604&amp;dq=referendum+religion+states+constitution+australia&amp;hl=en |title=Political maturity put to the test |last=Hamer |first=Rupert |date=9 August 1988 |work=[[The Age]] |p=13 |accessdate=2 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and expand the protection to cover any government act (not just legislation) that established a religion or prohibited its free exercise.&lt;ref name="Puls 1998 160"&gt;{{Harvnb|Puls|1998|p=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some church officials objected to the proposal, fearing that funding of religious schools by the states could become unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com.au/newspapers?id=U1kpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=gZYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3303,3701810&amp;dq=referendum+religion+australia&amp;hl=en |title=Bishops to deal blow on referendum |last=Grattan |first=Michelle |author2=Doogue, Edmund  |date=15 August 1988 |work=The Age |accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bowen assurance to schools on 'yes' vote |last=Seccombe |first=Mike |date=16 August 1988 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question failed to pass, being opposed by a majority of voters in each of the states.&lt;ref name="Frozen Continent"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Constitutional change : select sources on constitutional change in Australia 1901–1997 |publisher=House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs |location=Canberra, Australia |year=1997 |pages=113–114 |isbn=0-644-48410-1 |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/House/committee/laca/ConstitutionalChange/part2.pdf |accessdate=2 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050719100831/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/laca/ConstitutionalChange/part2.pdf |archivedate=19 July 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 70 to 30 per cent nationwide vote against the proposal was the largest margin by which a proposal to amend the Constitution had ever been defeated at a referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Williams |2002 |p=252}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams attributes the failure of the proposal mainly to the absence of bipartisan support for it, highlighting the "determined and effective" opposition of senior [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] politician [[Peter Reith]].&lt;ref name="Frozen Continent"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/frozen-continent/2008/03/28/1206207408050.html?page=2 |title=Frozen continent |last=Williams |first=George |date=29 March 2008 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams also points to the "notorious reluctance" of Australians to support Constitutional referendums: of the 44 proposals to amend the Constitution, only eight have succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb |Williams |1994 |p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt; 
'''Self-Persuasion''' is used to explain one aspect of [[social influence]]. This [[theory]] postulates that the receiver takes an active role in persuading himself or herself to change his or her attitude or behavior.&lt;ref name="Theories of self-persuasion"&gt;{{cite web|title=Theories of self-persuasion|url=http://www.sp.uconn.edu/~alw03009/P3.2.ppt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the direct technique of Persuasion, Self-persuasion is indirect and entails placing people in situations where they are motivated to persuade themselves to change.&lt;ref name=Aronson&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aronson|first=E.|title=The power of self-persuasion.|journal=American Psychologist Press|year=1995|pages=875–884|doi=10.1037/h0088188|volume=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically what characterizes a self-persuasion situation is that no direct attempt is made to convince anyone of anything.&lt;ref name=Aronson/&gt; Thus, with self-persuasion, people are convinced that the motivation for change has come from within, so the persuasion factors of another person’s influence is irrelevant. Therefore, Self-persuasion is almost always a more powerful form of persuasion (deeper, longer lasting) than the more traditional persuasion techniques. Self-Persuasion, also has an important influence in [[Social judgment theory]], [[Elaboration Likelihood Model]], [[Cognitive Dissonance]] and [[Narrative paradigm]].

==History==
Self-Persuasion came about based on the more traditional or direct strategies of persuasion, which have been around for at least 2,300 years and studied by eminent social psychologists from Aristotle to Carl Hovland, that focused their attention on these three principal factors: the nature of the message, the characteristics of the communicator, and the characteristics of the audience. It wasn’t until later that the theory of self-persuasion was developed by Dr. Carl Hovland, of Psychology, who had conducted studies during his time at Yale University during the 1940s and '50s. His argument in creating the concept of self-persuasion was that the factors within us determine our decision making; for example, one’s own personality, self-esteem, education, or interest.&lt;ref&gt;Persuasion: Theoretical and practical concerns, Available: http://www.uky.edu/CommInfoStudies/JAT/Telecommunications/hertog/520/lectures/Persuasion2.ppt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivation==
How can motivation and self-persuasion be connected? Webster defines motivation as the act or process of giving someone a reason for doing something: the act or process of motivating someone. Motivation involving self-persuasion pertains to the ability to motivate oneself for a higher reason or rewards. Convincing a person to believe in your belief can be a challenge, however, trying to convince yourself is all together another effort and challenge. Persuasion allows the mind the ability to be persuaded for reasons that exist for beneficial factors. Consider this: if you conquer your fears, would you consider this a giant feat or success? Through self-persuasion along with motivation, many people are able to tackle their fears, which in turn allow them to move to the next level or simply a higher level within society.

Self-persuasion permits a person’s mind the ability to be influenced or persuaded if they choose so. The mind through persuasion can also deny or resist if it so chooses, regardless of self-persuasion. Self-persuasion is directly related to processes of a person’s own mind and the influence of motivation the mind perceives. People would rather listen to themselves than to other people normally, except for those people that are indecisive. When people are trying to convince themselves or be persuaded into changing their mind, it can sometimes involves motivation or the act of motivation. People will listen to themselves and will automatically generate arguments that have personal relevance for them.&lt;ref&gt;T. Millon &amp; M. J. Lerner (Eds.), Comprehensive handbook of psychology (2nd ed). New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

It might sound crazy to some people, but people are being encouraged to persuade themselves all the time and many of these times are through motivation intensity.&lt;ref title=Understanding your mind&gt;{{cite journal|title=Understanding your mind.|journal=Psychology Blog|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As people know, motivation can be a driving ambition that can easily sway people based on reward, self-persuasion through motivation can achieve great results.

Encouraging a person to change their mind through motivation can be attributed to levels of acceptance through a variety of levels of motivation. A good example would be if a parent informs their child to do well in school and if levels of success are achieved, then rewards will follow. This is an example of self-persuasion; the child is utilizing self-persuasion to achieve the goal of pleasing the mom and dad as well as receiving a reward. The child is convinced to improve their grades while being motivated by money. Think of it like this: when a child goes to the dentist, it is usually persuaded by a parent that the dentist is not bad and if they do well while at the dentist, they will receive a reward. This is self-persuasion brought on by rewards. When we want to change our behavior, say, to healthier eating, we might try to convince ourselves we don’t like the forbidden foods as much as we do, knowing that forbidden food attract weight gain and health issues, therefore self-persuasion decreases the need for the forbidden food.&lt;ref title=Understanding your mind&gt;{{cite journal|title=Understanding your mind.|journal=Psychology Blog|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role Playing==
The experiment below discusses the effects that role-playing can have on self-persuasion.

Subjects first expressed their own positions on whether college education should be general (liberal arts) or specialized (career preparatory), then were led to accept that they would write essays supporting one or the other of these positions. Next, they judged the validity of a standard set of statements representing both views and again expressed their opinions on the same issue. Validity judgments indicated that subjects tended strongly to accept arguments supporting their own positions and reject opposing ones when expecting to defend their own positions, but accepted nearly equal numbers of arguments on both sides when expecting to advocate the opposing position. Final opinion judgments were influenced in the direction of the assigned position even though the role-playing task was not performed. It was concluded that the effectiveness of role-playing in inducing opinion change may be due in large to its success in getting subjects to evaluate.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony G. Greenwald, Ohio State University. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 1969. Open Mindedness of Counterattitudinal Role Player&lt;/ref&gt;

As time moves forward, role-playing and self-persuasion have amassed. It has become established as a very effective tool for education, management, forecasting choices in conflicts and negotiations. The understanding of role-playing also allows us opportunities to understand the situations that we may not have seen prior to involving a number of things from social economics, environmental situations, and political viewpoints. Role-playing is also a way for people to develop certain skills such as listening, conflict resolution and management effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 2009 | title =  | url = | journal = Journal Media and Communication Studies | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 023–032 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through recent studies involving role-playing and the ability role-playing has on changing a person’s mind is producing information that indicates passive affects role-playing once had are less now and communication through role-playing is more accepted. The base for the effectiveness of role-playing procedures in persuasion is poorly understood, although a number of hypotheses have been advanced. 
The five hypotheses below, although not directly tested in present research, must be regarded as promising.

:•''Selective learning'': Playing the role of an advocate of a given position may facilitate opinion change by prompting selective attention to or retention of arguments supporting that position.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald and Albert, 1968; Watts 1967&lt;/ref&gt; 
:•''Biased scanning'': When the role-playing assignment is accepted, the subject may become temporally motivated to seek arguments that support his assigned position.&lt;ref&gt;Elms and Janis, 1965 Janis and Gilmore 1965&lt;/ref&gt;
:•''Self as source'': Arguments perceived as self-originated may be more readily accepted than ones perceived as externally originated.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald 1968, King and Janis 1956&lt;/ref&gt;
:•''Hand tailoring'': An individual may be able to construct a communication that is uniquely effective for his own belief structure.  
:•''Dissonance'': Acceptance of the role-played position may be in the service of reducing dissonance aroused by counterattitidinal performance.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger 1957&lt;/ref&gt;

==Issue Importance==
Issue importance, within self-persuasion, is to be treated in terms of the priority of a self-interest that is at stake for individuals as members of a significant group.&lt;ref name=Sarup&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sarup|first=G.|title=Role playing, issue importance, and attitude change.|journal=Social Behavior and Personality|year=1981|pages=191–202|doi=10.2224/sbp.1981.9.2.191|volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals who become emotionally involved with an issue will be influenced the most. Thus, issues of high importance would produce a higher need of opinion change, which would then cause a maximal attitude change. Low issue importance would therefore create a minimal attitude change.&lt;ref name=Sarup/&gt;

==Attitude Change==
Role playing and issue importance can cause attitude change. The degree of involvement is based on the extent to which an attitudinal position is derived from and upheld by the individual and to the importance of the attitude to the individuals self.&lt;ref name=Sarup/&gt; “Counterattitudinal role playing has generally come to be accepted as a more efficacious technique of attitude change; while issue importance has generally pertained to the social significance and personal value of an attitudinal object.”(p.&amp;nbsp;191).&lt;ref name=Sarup/&gt; For Example, if you wish to play the role of a person who has a lot of courage and this particular issue is of high importance to you, you may through self-persuasion change your attitude in order to portray that attitude to others.

Theorists have identified ways in which people might be able to change their own attitudes simply by thinking differently about an attitude object. These cognitive strategies used in self-persuasion are known as: Epistemic and Teleologic. “Epistemic strategies involve re-conceptualizing the attitude objects known shortcomings in a more positive light. Teleologic strategies involve altering the accessibility of thoughts about those shortcomings” (p.&amp;nbsp;615).&lt;ref name=Resch&gt;{{cite journal|last=Resch|first=H.|title=Individual differences in using epistemic and teleologic strategies for deliberate self-persuasion.|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2011|pages=615–620|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2010.12.005|volume=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies for deliberate self-persuasion presumably take some cognitive effort; that is why individuals high in need for cognition, who find effortful reasoning and problem solving less stressful than individuals low in need for cognition, would be more inclined to use these two types of self-persuasion.&lt;ref name=Resch/&gt;

As seen in persuasion, an attitude may be adopted simply because it is associated with a highly credible, likeable, or powerful communicator; but this form of attitude change will only persist as long as the cues that elicited it remain of high importance to the individual.&lt;ref name=McFarland&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFarland|first=C.|title=Self-persuasion and self-presentation as mediators of anticipatory attitude change.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1984|pages=529–540|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.46.3.529|volume=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, individuals who utilize self persuasion prior to a speech or a social gathering, can alter their attitudes before they receive a message. This way allows the individual to persuade themselves of its merits and avoid appearing gullible or easily influenced(p.&amp;nbsp;530).&lt;ref name=McFarland/&gt; Therefore, the self-persuasion processes could become an important mediator of anticipatory attitude change. Anticipatory shifts occur when individuals merely expecting to hear a counterattitudinal communication, will then change their attitudes in the direction of the anticipated message.&lt;ref name=McFarland/&gt;

===Directional Changes in Attitudes (pro and counter)===
Pro and Counter Attitude: the majority of people are aware that pro anything means you are for the issue. On the other hand, the majority of people are also aware that the term counter is against. For the most part, people also tend to collaborate with the idea that people with high self-esteem, seem to demonstrate their ability is a more than pro way when dealing with topics. Attitude affects nearly everything a person does, from success to defeat.  A pro attitude in a person can be a confidence booster as well as a mechanism to allow persuasion into a discussion with the attempts to persuade change within the discussion.  Attitude persuasion can affect the end result of a debate as related to powerful self-esteem. Distractions can weigh heavily on the ability of a person involved in persuasion change with regards to counter attitude.

As in many types of communication efforts, there have been a multitude of theories.  During 1950 and 1960 theories were raised to focus on motives and functions have on individuals and their attitudes.  Based on theory, the research identified that attitudes served a multitude of purposes and needs involving the importance to psychological function.  During the research, different function labels were used within each theory.  The grouping of the functions provided information that attitudes serve a knowledge function assisting to organize a persons environment and this will provide consistency in a person’s ability to shift attitude for pro or counter needs?

All attitudes likely serve this basic function to some extent. In addition, attitudes likely serve any of a number of other motives. Many attitudes serve a utilitarian function,&lt;ref&gt;Katz, 1960; see also Smith et al., 1956&lt;/ref&gt; helping to maximize the rewards and minimize the punishments obtained from objects in the environment. Such utilitarian attitudes serve to summarize the outcomes intrinsically associated with objects and to guide behavioral responses that maximize one’s interests. For example, one’s attitude toward ice cream may serve a utilitarian function because it is likely to be based on the rewards, such as a craving and punishments such as the idea that ice cream will increase the chances of weight gain associated with ice cream. In the pro and counter approach, self-persuasion relates directly to the ice cream and whether or not to take part with it.&lt;ref&gt;The Role of Attitude Functions in Persuasion and Social Judgment, SHARON SHAVITT MICHELLE R. NELSON, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

This type of attitude change would blossom into a counter attitude involving self-persuasion. In theory, when trying to self persuade, the counter attitude affects one's mind can have on self-persuasion, could be related to the counter affects within the body.

==Four Theories That Utilize Self-Persuasion==

===Social Judgement Theory===

[[Social judgment theory]] (SJT) is a persuasion theory proposed by Carolyn Sherif, Muzafer Sherif, and Carl Hovland&lt;ref&gt;Mallard, Jessica. "Engaging Students In Social Judgment Theory." Communication Teacher 24.4 (2010): 197-202. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1961, and was defined by Sherif and Sherif as the perception and evaluation of an idea by comparing it with current attitudes.

The social judgment theory aims to explain how audiences process messages. The receiver of a message processes the information as a comparison to existing ideas or beliefs on the issue, a sort of lens use of accepting or rejecting the message.

A fundamental of the social judgment theory surrounds two internal elements present with every individual, the first being the anchor point or more commonly referred to as attitudes. This lens is always present, and is a major component in decision-making. Some of the important characteristics of individual attitudes are:
•	Stronger attitudes have more influence on any decision to accept or not accept a message.
•	Not all attitudes or opinions carry equal weight, and attitudes can be negative or positive.
•	Attitudes are extremely hard to predict since they are unique to any individual.
•	Behavior does not always indicate a person’s attitude.
The second element in the social judgment theory is ego involvement. Someone expressing high ego involvement in a topic usually has personal involvement in that topic. This level of ego involvement will help shape an individual’s stand on a particular issue. 
If a message does not conform to the ego involvement of the receiver, that message will likely not be received well, if at all. Falling in this category are politics or religion, or any other controversial topics. It is for this reason that like-minded individuals tend to associate with each other and accept the same ideas.

The combination of beliefs and attitudes regarding any topic come to be known as individual latitudes. Latitudes are generally grouped into three different categories, either the latitude of acceptance, the latitude of rejection, or the latitude of non-commitment.
In the latitude of acceptance category, messages and ideas get stored if the listener agrees with the message. Likewise, unacceptable messages get stored in the latitude of rejection category. Messages with no agreement or disagreement, so school he followed the latitude of non-commitment category. Many times, messages cross these categories, especially when judging one’s self or judging others. For example, a political stance one finds unacceptable may be acceptable to a friend. While that position is unacceptable to an individual, they do not necessarily find the other person unacceptable.

The aim of the social judgment is to explain how likely a person might be change their opinion, the likely direction the change of opinion will head, the ability to tolerate the opinions of other people, and the extent to which a person is committed to the position.&lt;ref&gt;[[Social judgment theory]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elaboration Likelihood Model ===

The [[Elaboration Likelihood Model]] (ELM), developed in 1986 by [[Richard E. Petty]] and [[John Cacioppo]], is based on the idea that any one variable can influence attitudes in a number of different ways and can serve to either increase or decrease persuasion through several different mechanisms (Petty et al., 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Petty | first1 = R. | display-authors = etal   | year = 2002 | title = Thought confidence as a determinant of persuasion: the self validation hypothesis | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 82 | issue = | pages = 722–741 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.82.5.722}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

ELM assumes that there are two routes of persuasive influence: central and peripheral. The key factor in selecting the routes in ELM is involvement; how much a person thinks and invests in a subject in order to form an opinion. When a person is actively thinking and internally processing the content of a subject, elaboration is high and will most likely follow the central persuasive route. However, when a person is not interested in a subject elaboration is low, which will result in information processed through the peripheral route.

This model proposes that when people are motivated to process information and are cognitively able to engage in the subject, they make decisions through the central route. This type of decision making results in a permanent attitude shift and the person will begin to elaborate on the arguments presented, further strengthening the argument. When the person is not actively processing the information, the person is subject to making decisions based on periphery issues—like or dislike of speaker, music in commercials. Petty et al. note that a person’s motivation to engage in a subject is not static. For example, a person who suffers from lung cancer may be more motivated to actively consume information on smoking cessation programs. The same person may not be as interested in consuming information about gardening and will therefore process the information on a peripheral level.

ELM also assumes that there are two variables that effect how people think: situational and personality. Other factors that influence how a person chooses to process information received include intelligence, time available, how much the person already knows about the topic, communication distractions, and how often the message is repeated (Rucker &amp; Petty, 2006;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rucker | first1 =  | last2 = Petty | year = 2006 | title = Increasing the Effectiveness of Communications to Consumers: Recommendations Based on Elaboration Likelihood and Attitude Certainty Perspectives | url = | journal = Journal of Public Policy &amp; Marketing | volume = 25 | issue = 1| pages = 39–52 | doi=10.1509/jppm.25.1.39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wagner &amp; Petty, 2011&lt;ref&gt;Wagner, B. C., &amp; Petty, R. E. (2011). The elaboration likelihood model of persuasion: Thoughtful and non-thougful social influence. In D. Chadee (Ed.), Theories in social psychology (pp. 96-116). Oxford: Blackwell.&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Cognitive Dissonance===

[[Cognitive Dissonance]] expresses an individuals desire consistency between what they expect and the reality of any situation; however with the lack of this agreement, comes cognitive dissonance, according to many theorists, the first of which being Leon Festinger. When developing his Cognitive Dissonance Theory, Festinger concluded: “There are two major sources of cognition, namely, own experience and communication from others.”&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L. (1954). Social Communication and Cognition: A Very Preliminary and Highly Tentative Draft. Wash. DC: American Psychological Press. Pp. 381-386.&lt;/ref&gt; (p.&amp;nbsp;382).

Festinger asserted that individuals understand that different inputs are not necessarily psychologically consistent with one another. When given the option between inconsistent inputs, the person suffering the dissonance will, in one way or another, try to make the option more consistent; or, in other words, strive for internal consistency(p.&amp;nbsp;93).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Festinger | first1 = L | year = 1962 | title = Cognitive Dissonance | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 207 | issue = 4| pages = 93–106 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican1062-93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whenever presented with two bits of information that do not seem to fit together psychologically, the result is a dissonant relationship between the two. Understanding that cognitive dissonance works as a motivator towards states of affairs, the individual suffering the dissonance can often change their attitude, thus making the two competing ideas least dissonant.
Festinger theorized the key to relationships between various cognitions fall into one of three categories:

:''Consonant relationship'' – Cognitions or actions consistent with one another
:''Irrelevant relationship'' – Cognitions or actions unrelated to one another
:''Dissonant relationship'' – Cognitions or actions that are inconsistent with one another

The amount of dissonance, and the corresponding mental distress relies on two basic factors:  1) the importance of the cognitions, where the greater the personal value of the elements is, the greater the resulting level of dissonance. For example, a matter involving cutting funding for schools in order to cut taxes will have wide-ranging amounts of dissonance between a parent and a nonparent.; 2) the ratio of the cognitions, where the relationship between dissonant and consonant elements vary in proportion. In the school example, a parent, a potential parent, and a person who has decided to never have children will view the scenario differently, since the weight of what is desirable (consonant) and what is undesirable (dissonant) differs between those affected by the decision.

Other Work on the Theory

While Festinger first conceptualized the theory, there have been others with different or will you like it to the nicer encouragement slightly different views regarding what causes dissonance. In one interpretation, drive is a key factor, “Dissonance theory, in general, concerns the relationship between various cognitions. The theory posits the existence of a drive-like motivation to maintain consistency among relevant cognitions”(p.&amp;nbsp;465).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fazio | first1 = R.H. | last2 = Zanna | first2 = M.P. | last3 = Cooper | first3 = J. | year = 1977 | title = Dissonance and self-perception: An integrative view of each theory's proper domain of application | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 464–479 | doi=10.1016/0022-1031(77)90031-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Festinger’s rivals, as referred by many - Daryl J. Bem offers his alternative to the theory and calls it self-perception. Bem emphasizes the following ideas of social input, and socialization. “Self-awareness, one’s ability to respond differently to his own behavior and its controlling variables, is a product of social interaction”(p.&amp;nbsp;199).&lt;ref name=Bem&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bem|first=D.J.|title= An experimental analysis of self-perception.|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=1965|pages=199–218|doi=10.1016/0022-1031(65)90026-0|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, “again, it is evident that self-awareness is a set of behaviors which must be learned from a socializing community that sets up the necessary contingencies of reinforcement for establishing the discriminations”(p.&amp;nbsp;217).&lt;ref name=Bem/&gt;

Arguably, when examining Festinger’s and Bem’s theories, Miller (1995) addresses a few curious questions: “How closely and accurately do people actually examine their own behaviors? Are both theories comparable in the degree, accuracy or level of self-awareness they require?  How necessary is self-evaluation on a conscious level for either or both theories?”(p.&amp;nbsp;8).&lt;ref&gt;Miller C., (1995). A reflection paper on the theories of cognitive dissonance and self-perception. Motivation vs. Self-Perception. University of Arizona&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Narrative Paradigm===

[[Walter Fisher (professor)|Walter Fisher]]’s Narrative Paradigm Theory posits that all meaningful communication is a form of storytelling or giving a report of events, and that human beings experience and comprehend life as a series of ongoing narratives, each with its own conflicts, characters, beginning, middle, and end. Fisher believes that all forms of communication that appeal to our reason are best viewed as stories shaped by history, culture, and character, and all forms of human communication are to be seen fundamentally as stories&lt;ref&gt;[[Narrative paradigm]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main points of the Narrative Paradigm are:

1. People are essentially storytellers.

2. People make decisions because they feel they had a good reason to do so rather than because of evidence.

3. What people do and how people think is swayed by history, biography, culture, and character.

4. People are continually choosing personal stories and these stories are constantly changing.

5. Narrative rationality is determined by the coherence and fidelity of the story, which measure a story's truthfulness and humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = W | year = 1984 | title = The Narrative Paradigm: In the Beginning | url = | journal = Journal of Communication | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 74–89 | doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1984.tb02986.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This paradigm suggests that people choose what they want to believe, and that the beliefs are influenced by external factors. Communicating in the narrative enables people to share their understandings of how the world works and allows them to identify with one another, particularly if people share similar beliefs.

Fisher's original theory was published in 1984 under The Narrative Paradigm: In the Beginning, however he clarifies his position in 1985 in The Narrative Paradigm: The Elaboration. Fisher writes that the narrative paradigm is a paradigm in the sense of a philosophical view of human communication; it is not a model of discourse as such. The primary function of the paradigm is to offer a way of interpreting and assessing human communication that leads to critique, a determination of whether or not a given instance of discource provides a reliable, trustworthy, and desirable guide to thought and action in the world. It predicts that all normal human discourse is meaningful and is subject to the tests of narrative rationality (p 351.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = W | year = 1985 | title = The Narrative Paradigm: An elaboration | url = | journal = Communication monographs | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 347–367 | doi=10.1080/03637758509376117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Social simulation''' is a research field that applies [[computer|computational]] methods to study issues in the [[social sciences]]. The issues explored include problems in [[computational law]], [[psychology]],&lt;ref name="Hughes et al (2012) JOOP"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hughes | first1 = H. P.

Social simulation aims to cross the gap between the descriptive approach used in the social sciences and the formal approach used in the natural sciences, by moving the focus on the processes/mechanisms/behaviors that build the social reality.

In social simulation, computers support human reasoning activities by executing these mechanisms. This field explores the simulation of societies as [[complex system|complex non-linear systems]], which are difficult to study with classical mathematical equation-based models. [[Robert Axelrod]] regards social simulation as a third way of doing science, differing from both the deductive and inductive approach; generating data that can be analysed inductively, but coming from a rigorously specified set of rules rather than from direct measurement of the real world. Thus, simulating a phenomenon is akin to generating it—constructing artificial societies. These ambitious aims have encountered [[#Criticisms|several criticisms]].

The social simulation approach to the social sciences is promoted and coordinated by three regional associations, [[European Social Simulation Association|ESSA]] for Europe, North America (reorganizing under the new CSSS name), and PAAA [https://archive.is/20130413115754/http://www.paaa.econ.kyoto-u.ac.jp/ Pacific Asia].

==History and development==

The history of the agent-based model can be traced back to the [[Self-replicating machine|Von Neumann machine]], a theoretical machine capable of reproducing itself. The device [[von Neumann]] proposed would follow precisely detailed instructions to fashion a copy of itself. The concept was then improved by von Neumann's friend [[Stanislaw Ulam]], also a mathematician; Ulam suggested that the machine be built on paper, as a collection of cells on a grid. The idea intrigued von Neumann, who drew it up&amp;mdash;creating the first of devices later termed [[cellular automata]].

Another improvement was brought by mathematician, [[John Horton Conway|John Conway]]. He constructed the well-known [[Conway's Game of Life|Game of Life]]. Unlike the von Neumann's machine, Conway's Game of Life operated by simple rules in a virtual world in the form of a 2-dimensional [[checkerboard]].

The birth of the agent-based model as a model for social systems was primarily brought about by a computer scientist, [[Craig Reynolds (computer graphics)|Craig Reynolds]]. He tried to model the reality of lively biological agents, known as the [[artificial life]], a term coined by [[Christopher Langton]].

[[Joshua M. Epstein]] and [[Robert Axtell]] developed the first large scale agent model, the [[Sugarscape]], to simulate and explore the role of social phenomena such as seasonal migrations, pollution, sexual reproduction, combat, transmission of disease, and even culture.

[[Kathleen M. Carley]] published "Computational Organizational Science and Organizational Engineering" defining the movement of simulation into
organizations, established a journal for social simulation applied to organizations and complex socio-technical systems: [[Computational and Mathematical Organization Theory]], and was the founding president of the North American Association of Computational Social and Organizational Systems that morphed into the current CSSSA.

[[Nigel Gilbert]] published with [[Klaus G. Troitzsch]] the first textbook on Social Simulation: Simulation for the Social Scientist (1999) and established its most relevant journal: the [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]].

More recently, [[Ron Sun]] developed methods for basing agent-based simulation on models of human cognition, known as [[cognitive social simulation]] (see {{Harv|Sun|2006}})

==Topics==

Here are some sample topics that have been explored with social simulation:

* '''[[norm (social)|Social norms]]''': [[Robert Axelrod]] has used simulations to investigate the foundation of morality;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Axelrod (1986): [http://www-personal.umich.edu/~axe/Axelrod%20Norms%20APSR%201986%20(2).pdf An Evolutionary Approach to Norms]&lt;/ref&gt; others have modeled the emergence of norms using [[meme]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Felix Flentge, Daniel Polani and Thomas Uthmann (2001) [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/4/4/3.html Modelling the Emergence of Possession Norms using Memes]&lt;/ref&gt; or how social norms and emotions can regulate each other.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Staller and Paolo Petta (2001): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/4/1/2.html Introducing Emotions into the Computational Study of Social Norms: A First Evaluation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See Martin Neumann (2008): [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/11/4/6.html Homo Socionicus: a Case Study of Simulation Models of Norms] for an overview of the recent (as of 2008) research.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of simulation and modeling==
Social simulation can refer to a general class of strategies for understanding social dynamics using computers to simulate social systems. Social simulation allows for a more systematic way of viewing the possibilities of outcomes.

There are four major types of social simulation: 
#System level simulation.
#System level modeling.
#Agent-based simulation.
#Agent-based modeling.

A social simulation may fall within the rubric of [[computational sociology]] which is a recently developed branch of [[sociology]] that uses [[computation]] to analyze social phenomena. The basic premise of computational sociology is to take advantage of [[computer simulation]]s {{Harv|Polhill|Edmonds|2007}} in the construction of social theories. It involves the understanding of [[social agent]]s, the interaction among these agents, and the effect of these interactions on the social aggregate.  Although the subject matter and methodologies in [[social science]] differ from those in [[natural science]] or [[computer science]], several of the approaches used in contemporary social [[simulation]] originated from fields such as [[physics]] and [[artificial intelligence]].

===System level simulation===
System Level Simulation (SLS) is the oldest level of social simulation. System level simulation looks at the situation as a whole. This theoretical outlook on social situations uses a wide range of information to determine what should happen to society and its members if certain variables are present. Therefore, with specific variables presented, society and its members should have a certain response to the new situation. Navigating through this theoretical simulation will allow researchers to develop educated ideas of what will happen under some specific variables.

For example, if [[NASA]] were to conduct a system level simulation it would benefit the organization by providing a cost effective research method to navigate through the simulation. This allows the researcher to steer through the virtual possibilities of the given simulation and develop [[safety]] procedures, and to produce proven facts about how a certain situation will play out. {{Harv|National Research|2006}}

===System level modeling===

System level modeling (SLM) aims to specifically predict (unlike system level simulation's generalization in prediction) and convey any number of actions, behaviors, or other theoretical possibilities of nearly any person, object, construct et cetera within a system using a large set of mathematical equations and computer programming in the form of models.

A model is a representation of a specific thing ranging from objects and people to structures and products created through mathematical equations and are designed, using computers, in such a way that they are able to stand-in as the aforementioned things in a study. Models can be either simplistic or complex, depending on the need for either; however, models are intended to be simpler than what they are representing while remaining realistically similar in order to be used accurately. They are built using a collection of data that is translated into computing languages that allow them to represent the system in question. These models, much like simulations, are used to help us better understand specific roles and actions of different things so as to predict behavior and the like.

===Agent-based simulation===

[[Agent-based social simulation]] (ABSS) consists of modeling different societies after artificial agents, (varying on scale) and placing them in a computer simulated society to observe the behaviors of the agents.  From this data it is possible to learn about the reactions of the artificial agents and translate them into the results of non-artificial agents and simulations.  Three main fields in ABSS are agent-based computing, social science, and computer simulation.

Agent-based computing is the design of the model and agents, while the computer simulation is the part of the simulation of the agents in the model and the outcomes.  The social science is a mixture of sciences and social part of the model.  It is where the social phenomena is developed and theorized. The main purpose of ABSS is to provide models and tools for agent-based simulation of social phenomena.  With ABSS we can explore different outcomes for phenomena where we might not be able to view the outcome in real life.  It can provide us valuable information on society and the outcomes of social events or phenomena.

===Agent-based modeling===

[[Agent-based modeling]] (ABM) is a system in which a collection of agents independently interact on networks. Each individual agent is responsible for different behaviors that result in collective behaviors. These behaviors as a whole help to define the workings of the network. ABM focuses on human social interactions and how people work together and communicate with one another without having one, single "group mind". This essentially means that it tends to focus on the consequences of interactions between people (the agents) in a population. Researchers are better able to understand this type of modeling by modeling these dynamics on a smaller, more localized level. Essentially, ABM helps to better understand interactions between people (agents) who, in turn, influence one another (in response to these influences). Simple individual rules or actions can result in coherent [[group behavior]]. Changes in these individual acts can affect the collective group in any given population.

Agent-based modeling is an experimental tool for theoretical research. It enables one to deal with more complex individual behaviors, such as adaptation. Overall, through this type of modeling, the creator, or researcher, aims to model behavior of agents and the communication between them in order to better understand how these individual interactions impact an entire population. In essence, ABM is a way of modeling and understanding different global patterns.

==Current research==

There are several current research projects that relate directly to modeling and agent-based simulation the following are listed below with a brief overview.

*"Generative e-Social Science for Socio-Spatial Simulation" or (GENESIS) is a research node of the UK National Centre for e-Social Science funded by the UK research council [http://www.esrc.ac.uk ESRC]. For further details please see: [https://web.archive.org/web/20091209031009/http://www.genesis.ucl.ac.uk/ GENESIS Web Page] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20091114023426/http://www.casa.ucl.ac.uk/genesisblog/ Blog].
*"National e-Infrastructure for Social Simulation" or (NeISS) is a UK-based project funded by [http://www.jisc.ac.uk JISC]. For further details please see: [http://www.neiss.org.uk The NeISS Web Pages].
*"Network Models Governance and R&amp;D collaboration networks" or (N.E.M.O) is a research centre whose main focus is to identify ways to create and to assess desirable network structures for typical functions; (e.g. knowledge, creation, transfer, and distribution.) This research will ultimately aid [[policy-makers]] at all political levels in improving the effectiveness and efficiency of network-based policy instruments at promoting the knowledge economy in Europe.
*"Agent-based Simulations of Market and Consumer Behavior" is another research group that is funded by the Unilever Corporate Research. The current research that is being conducted is investigating the usefulness of agent-based simulations for modeling [[consumer behavior]] and to show the potential value and insights it can add to long-established marketing methods.
*"New and Emergent World Models Through Individual, Evolutionary and Social Learning" or (New Ties) is a three-year project that will ultimately create a virtual society developed by agent-based simulation. The project will develop a simulated society capable of exploring the environment and developing its own image of this environment and the society through interaction. The goal of the research project is for the simulated society to exhibit [[individual learning]], [[evolutionary learning]] and [[social learning (social pedagogy)|social learning]].
*Bruch and Mare's project on neighborhood [[Residential segregation|segregation]]: The purpose of the study is to figure out the reasoning for neighborhood segregation based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and to figure out the [[tipping point (sociology)|tipping point]] or when people become uncomfortable with the integration levels into their neighborhood, and decide to flee from the neighborhood. They set up a model using flash cards, and put the agent's house in the middle and put houses of different races surrounding the agent's house. They asked people how comfortable they would feel with different situations; if they were okay with one situation, they asked another until the neighborhood was fully integrated. Bruch and Mare's results showed that the tipping point was at 50%. When a neighborhood became 50% minority and 50% white, people of both races began to become uncomfortable and [[white flight]] began to rise. The use of agent-based modeling showed how useful it can be in the world of sociology, people did not have to answer why they would become uncomfortable, just which situation they were uncomfortable with.
*The MAELIA Program (Multi-Agent Emergent Norms Assessment) is a project dealing with the relationships between the users and managers of a natural resource, in that case water, and the related norms and laws that are to be built within them (conventions) or are imposed to them by other actors (institutions). The purpose of the project is to build a generic multiscale platform which is planned to deal with [[water conflict]]-related issues.
*The [http://www.gsi.dit.upm.es/mosi/ Mosi-Agil project] is a four-year program funded by the Autonomous Region of Madrid through the program MOSI-AGIL-CM (grant S2013/ICE-3019, co-funded by EU Structural Funds FSE and FEDER). It aims at creating a body of knowledge and practical tools which are necessary to handle more effectively the behavior of occupants of large facilities. Therefore, the project studies the development of ambient intelligence and intelligent environments supported by the use of Agent-Based Social Simulation.

Agent-based modeling is most useful in providing a bridge between micro and macro levels, which is a large part of what sociology studies. Agent-based models are most appropriate for studying processes that lack central coordination, including the emergence of institutions that, once established, impose order from the top down. The models focus on how simple and predictable local interactions generate familiar but highly detailed global patterns, such as emergence of [[norm (sociology)|norms]] and [[participation (decision making)|participation]] of collective action. Michael W. Macy and Robert Willer researched a recent survey of applications and found that there were two main problems with agent-based modeling the [[self-organization]] of social structure and the [[emergence]] of [[social order]] {{Harv|Macy|Willer|2002}}. Below is a brief description of each problem Macy and Willer believe there to be;
#"''Emergent structure''. In these models, agents change location or behavior in response to [[social influences]] or selection pressures. Agents may start out undifferentiated and then change location or behavior so as to avoid becoming different or isolated (or in some cases, overcrowded). Rather than producing homogeneity, however, these conformist decisions aggregate to produce global patterns of cultural differentiation, stratification, and homophilic clustering in local networks. Other studies reverse the process, starting with a heterogeneous population and ending in convergence: the coordination, diffusion, and sudden collapse of norms, conventions, innovations, and technological standards."
#"''Emergent social order''. These studies show how [[egotism|egoistic]] adaptation can lead to successful collective action without either altruism or global (top down) imposition of control. A key finding across numerous studies is that the viability of trust, cooperation, and collective action depends decisively on the embeddedness of interaction."

These examples simply show the complexity of our environment and that agent-based models are designed to explore the minimal conditions, the simplest set of assumptions about human behavior, required for a given social phenomenon to emerge at a higher level of organization.

==Criticisms==
Since its creation, computerized social simulation has been the target of some criticism in regard to its practicality and accuracy. Social simulation's simplification of the complex to form models from which we can better understand the latter is sometimes seen as a draw back, as using fairly simple models to simulate real life with computers is not always the best way to predict behavior.

Most of the criticism seems to be aimed at agent-based models and simulation and how they work:

#Simulations, being man-made from mathematical interfaces, predict [[human behavior]] in a far too simple manner in regard to the complexities of humanity and our actions.
#Simulations cannot enlighten researchers as to how people interact or behave in ways not programmed into their models. For this reason, the scope of simulations are limited in that the researchers must already know what they are going to find (to a degree, for they cannot find anything they themselves did not place in the model) at least vaguely, possibly skewing the results.
#Due to the complexities of what is being measured, simulations must be analyzed in unbiased ways; however, with the model running on a pre-made set of instructions coded into it by a modeler, biases exist almost universally.
#It is highly difficult and often impractical to attempt to link the findings from the abstract world the simulation creates and our complex society and all of its variation.

Researchers working in social simulation might respond that the competing theories from the [[social sciences]] are far simpler than those achieved through simulation and therefore suffer the aforementioned drawbacks much more strongly.  Theories in some social science tend to be linear models that are not dynamic, and are generally inferred from small laboratory [[experiment]]s (laboratory tests are most common in psychology but rare in sociology, political science, economics and geography). The behavior of populations of agents under these models is rarely tested or verified against empirical observation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1443">'''Soil defertilisation''' refers to the practice of reducing [[soil fertility]] in order to reduce the number of plants that can grow on that soil. It is often done on land not intended for agriculture, such as city parks.

== Benefit ==
On land not intended for agriculture, such as city parks or other communal spaces, undesired plants (weeds) can become a nuisance to the city's communal services, costing effort and money.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

In some cases, along with soil defertilisation, the soil's pH and water content can be altered. This may create a much different environment, allowing more specialised plants/vegetation to grow and take hold.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

== In practice ==
Soil defertilisation is done by growing [[Green_manure|specific cover crops]] (e.g., ''[[Phacelia]]'', ''[[White mustard|Sinapis alba]]'', ''[[Lolium multiflorum]]'') on them and then, instead of ploughing them under, removing them from the soil. By doing this, the nutrients that have accumulated in the crops are removed together with the crops. The crops may be used on other land that needs to be [[Fertilizer|fertilsed]] (instead of defertilised), for example agricultural land.&lt;ref&gt;Stappen naar een ecologische tuin: aanleg en beheer by Geertje Coremans, page 63&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6135">'''Symbols of death''' are the [[symbol]]ic, often [[allegory|allegorical]], portrayal of [[death]] in various [[culture]]s.  For allegorical figures that portray death, see [[Death (personification)]].

== Images ==
[[File:Vf-101 grim reapers tomcat tail.jpg|thumb|Image of the Grim Reaper on the tailfin of a [[U.S. Navy]] [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14D Tomcat]] of Flight Squadron, [[VF-101]], nicknamed the "Grim Reapers."]]
[[File:Flag of Edward England.svg|thumb|Traditional [[Jolly Roger]], the flag of [[Samuel Bellamy|"Black Sam" Bellamy]] and other [[pirate]]s of the 18th century, displaying a skull and crossbones.]]
Various images are used traditionally to symbolize death; these rank from blunt depictions of [[cadaver]]s and their parts to more [[allusion|allusive]] suggestions that time is fleeting and all men are mortals.

The [[human skull]] is an obvious and frequent symbol of death, found in many cultures and religious traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Glennys Howarth|author2=Oliver Leaman|title=Encyclopedia of Death and Dying|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5GK2AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA416|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-91360-0|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human skeleton]]s and sometimes non-human animal [[skeleton]]s and skulls can also be used as blunt images of death; the traditional figures of [[Death (personification)|the Grim Reaper]] – a black-hooded skeleton with a [[scythe]] – is one use of such symbolism.  The [[Skull and crossbones (poison)|skull and crossbones]] motif (☠) has been used among Europeans as a symbol of both [[piracy]] and [[poison]].

[[Decomposition|Decayed]] cadavers can also be used to depict death; in medieval Europe, they were often featured in artistic depictions of the ''[[danse macabre]]'', or in [[cadaver tomb]]s which depicted the living and decomposed body of the person entombed. [[Coffin]]s also serve as blunt reminders of mortality.

Less blunt symbols of death frequently allude to the passage of [[time]] and the fragility of [[life]], and can be described as ''[[memento mori]]'';&lt;ref name='oed'&gt;literally 'remember to die', [[Oxford English Dictionary]], Third Edition, June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; that is, an artistic or symbolic reminder of the inevitability of death.  [[Clock]]s, [[hourglass]]es, [[sundial]]s, and other timepieces both call to mind that time is passing. Similarly, a [[candle]] both marks the passage of time, and bears witness that it will eventually burn itself out.  These sorts of symbols were often incorporated into ''[[vanitas]]'' paintings, a variety of early [[still life]].

Certain animals such as [[crow]]s, [[cat]]s, [[owl]]s, [[moth]]s, [[vulture]]s and [[bat]]s are associated with death; some because they feed on carrion, others because they are nocturnal.

== Religious symbols ==

Religious symbols of death and depictions of the afterlife will vary with the [[religion]] practiced by the people who use them.

[[Tomb]]s, [[grave stone|tombstone]]s, and other items of [[funeral]] architecture are obvious candidates for symbols of death.  In ancient [[Egypt]], the [[god]]s [[Osiris]] and [[Ptah]] were typically depicted as [[mummy|mummies]]; these gods governed the Egyptian [[afterlife]].  In [[Christianity]], the [[Christian cross]] is frequently used on [[Grave (burial)|graves]], and is meant to call to mind the [[crucifixion]] of [[Jesus]].  Some Christians also erect temporary crosses along public [[highway]]s as memorials for those who died in accidents.  In [[Buddhism]], the symbol of a [[wheel]] represents the perpetual cycle of death and rebirth that happens in samsara.  The symbol of a grave or tomb, especially one in a picturesque or unusual location, can be used to represent death, as in [[Nicholas Poussin]]'s famous painting ''[[Et in Arcadia ego]]''.

Images of life in the afterlife are also symbols of death.  Here, again, the ancient Egyptians produced detailed pictorial representations of the life enjoyed by the dead.  In Christian [[folk religion]],  the [[spiritual being|spirit]]s of the dead are often depicted as [[wing]]ed [[angel]]s or angel-like creatures, dwelling among the clouds; this imagery of the afterlife is frequently used in [[comedy|comic]] depictions of the life after death. In the Islamic view of the Afterlife, death is [[Qiyamah#Personification in Qiyâmah|symbolised]] by a black and white [[sheep|ram]] which in turn will be slain to symbolise the ''Death of Death''.

The [[Banshee]] also symbolizes the coming of death in Irish Mythology.

== Colors ==

[[Black]] is the [[color]] of [[mourning]] in many [[Europe]]an cultures. Black clothing is typically worn at funerals to show mourning for the death of the person. In [[East Asia]], [[white]] is similarly associated with mourning; it represented the purity and perfection of the deceased person's spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Colors for Your Every Mood: Discover Your True Decorating Colors|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=RKcQbF5cBiQC|publisher = Capital Books|date = 2000|isbn = 9781892123381|first = Leatrice|last = Eiseman|page = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Victorian era]], [[purple]] and [[grey]] were considered to be mourning colors in addition to [[black]]. Furthermore, in Revelation 6 in [[The Bible]], Death is one of the four horsemen; and he rides a pale horse.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%206:%208;&amp;version=NIV Revelation 6:8 (New International Version)] at Bible Gateway.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''teletransportation paradox''' or '''teletransport paradox''' (also known in alternative forms as the '''duplicates paradox''') is a thought experiment on the [[Identity (philosophy)|philosophy of identity]] that challenges common intuitions on the nature of self and consciousness. It first appeared in full published form presumably in [[Derek Parfit]]'s 1984 book ''[[Reasons and Persons]]'', but similar questions have been raised as early as 1775.

{{Quote|text=I would be glad to know your Lordship's opinion whether when my brain has lost its original structure, and when some hundred years after the same materials are fabricated so curiously as to become an intelligent being, whether, I say that being will be me; or, if, two or three such beings should be formed out of my brain; whether they will all be me, and consequently one and the same intelligent being.|sign=[[Thomas Reid]] letter to [[Henry Home, Lord Kames|Lord Kames]], 1775&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gm5CAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA52|title=The Works of Thomas Reid, D.D.: Now Fully Collected, with Selections from His Umpublished Letters|author=Reid, T. and Hamilton, W. and Stewart, D.|year=1846|publisher=Maclachlan and Stewart|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The Polish science-fiction writer [[Stanisław Lem]] discovered the same problem independently in the middle of the twentieth century. He put it in writing in his philosophical text "''Dialogi''", 1957.

==Derek Parfit's version==

In ''Divided Minds and the Nature of Persons'' (1987), Parfit asks the reader to imagine entering a "teletransporter", a machine that puts you to sleep, then destroys you, breaking you down into atoms, copying the information and relaying it to Mars at the speed of light.  On Mars, another machine re-creates you (from local stores of carbon, hydrogen, and so on), each atom in exactly the same relative position.  Parfit poses the question of whether or not the teletransporter is a method of travel—is the person on Mars the ''same person'' as the person who entered the teletransporter on Earth? Certainly, when waking up on Mars, ''you'' would feel like being ''you'', ''you'' would remember entering the teletransporter in order to travel to Mars, ''you'' would even feel the cut on your upper lip from shaving this morning.

Then the teleporter is upgraded. The teletransporter on Earth is modified to not destroy the person who enters it, but instead it can simply make infinite replicas, all of whom would claim to remember entering the teletransporter on Earth in the first place.

Using thought experiments such as these, Parfit argues that any criteria we attempt to use to determine sameness of person will be lacking, because there is no further fact.  What matters, to Parfit, is simply "Relation R", psychological connectedness, including memory, personality, and so on.

Parfit continues this logic to establish a new context for morality and social control. He cites that it is morally wrong for one person to harm or interfere with another person and it is incumbent on society to protect individuals from such transgressions. That accepted, it is a short extrapolation to conclude that it is also incumbent on society to protect an individual's "Future Self" from such transgressions; tobacco use could be classified as an abuse of a Future Self's right to a healthy existence. Parfit resolves the logic to reach this conclusion, which appears to justify incursion into personal freedoms, but he does not explicitly endorse such invasive control.

Parfit's conclusion is similar to [[David_Hume#The_self|David Hume's view]] and also to the view of the self in [[Buddhism]]{{dubious|date=March 2016}}, though it does not restrict itself to a mere reformulation of them. For besides being ''reductive'', Parfit's view is also ''deflationary'': in the end, "what matters" is not personal identity, but rather mental continuity and connectedness.

'''Hydro power''' is generated when the natural force from the water's current moves a device (fan, propeller, wheel) that is pushed by the force of the water. Ordinary water weighs 8.36 lbs per gallon (1 kg per liter).{{CN|date=February 2015}} The force make the turbine mechanism spin, creating electricity. As long as there is flow, it is possible to produce electricity. The advantage of electricity generated in this way is that it is a renewable resource.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alternative-energy-news.info/micro-hydro-power-pros-and-cons/&lt;/ref&gt;  A small-scale Micro Hydro Power can be a reliable and long lasting piece of technology. The disadvantage of the system is that technology has yet to be developed more than what it is today.{{CN|date=February 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12988">'''Winchester measure''' is a set of legal standards of volume instituted in the late 15th century (1495) by [[Henry VII of England|King Henry&amp;nbsp;VII]] of England and in use, with some modifications, until the present day. It consists of the Winchester [[bushel]] and its dependent quantities, the [[peck]], (dry) [[gallon]] and (dry) [[quart]]. They would later become known as the Winchester Standards, named because the examples were kept in the city of Winchester.

'''Winchester measure''' may also refer to:

==History==
During the tenth century, the capital city of the English king, [[Edgar the Peaceful|Edgar]], was at [[Winchester]] and, at his direction, standards of measurement were instituted.&lt;ref name="Whitelock1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Dorothy Whitelock|title=English Historical Documents 500-1042|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gLpQFeVfpuYC&amp;pg=PA437|accessdate=30 January 2012|year=1996|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-14366-0|page=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Liebermann1903"&gt;{{cite book|author=Felix Liebermann|authorlink=Felix Liebermann|title=Die gesetze der Angelsachsen: Text und übersetzung|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ak8ZAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA204|accessdate=30 January 2012|year=1903|publisher=Max Niemeyer|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nothing is known of these standards except that, following the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman Conquest]], the physical standards (prototypes) were removed to London.&lt;ref name="Zupko1977-12"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Edward Zupko|authorlink=Ronald Edward Zupko|title=British weights &amp; measures: a history from antiquity to the seventeenth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pWUgAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=30 January 2012|year=1977|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|pages=11–2|isbn=9780299073404}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1496, a law of King Henry&amp;nbsp;VII instituted the bushel that would later come to be known by the name "Winchester".
In 1588 Queen Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I, while reforming the English weight system (which, at the time, included no less than three different pounds going by the name "avoirdupois") based the new Exchequer standard on an ancient set of bronze weights found at Winchester and dating to the reign of Edward&amp;nbsp;III.

These incidents have led to the widespread belief that the Winchester units of dry capacity measure, i.e., the [[bushel]] and its dependent quantities the [[peck]], [[gallon]] and [[quart]], must have originated in the time of King Edgar. However, contemporary scholarship can find no evidence for the existence of any these units in Britain prior to the Norman Conquest. Furthermore, all of the units associated with Winchester measure (quarter, bushel, peck, gallon, pottle, quart, pint) have names of French derivation, at least suggestive of Norman origin.

===Capacity Measures in the Anglo-Saxon Period===

Prior to the Norman Conquest, the following units of capacity measure were used: ''sester'', ''amber'', ''mitta'', ''coomb'', and ''seam''. A statute of 1196 (9 Richard I. c 27.) decreed: ''It is established that all measures of the whole of England be of the same amount, as well of corn as of vegetables and of like things, to wit, one good horse load; and that this measure be level as well in cities and boroughs as without.''&lt;ref name="BlandTawney1919"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alfred Edward Bland|author2=Richard Henry Tawney|authorlink2=Richard Henry Tawney|title=English economic history: select documents|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bSO6emWmBuAC&amp;pg=PA154|accessdate=1 February 2012|year=1919|publisher=Macmillan Co.|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; This appears to be a description of the seam, which would later be equated with the quarter. The word seam is of Latin derivation (from the Vulgar Latin ''sauma'' = packsaddle).&lt;ref name="Zupko1985"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald Edward Zupko|authorlink=Ronald Edward Zupko|title=A dictionary of weights and measures for the British Isles: the Middle Ages to the twentieth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0l_k-XMIiQIC&amp;pg=PA369|accessdate=1 February 2012|year=1985|publisher=American Philosophical Society|isbn=978-0-87169-168-2|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the other units are likewise of Latin derivation, sester from sextarius, amber from amphora.&lt;ref name="Harmer2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=F. E. Harmer|title=Select English Historical Documents of the Ninth and Tenth Centuries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cM3Wfu6qlo8C&amp;pg=PA74|accessdate=1 February 2012|date=11 August 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-40222-5|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sester could thus be taken as roughly a pint, the amber a bushel. However, the values of these units, as well as their relationships to one another, varied considerably over the centuries so that no clear definitions are possible except by specifying the time and place in which the units were used.

===After the Norman Conquest===

One of the earliest documents defining the gallon, bushel and quarter is the ''Assize of Weights and Measures'', also known as the ''Tractatus de Ponderibus et Mensuris'', sometimes attributed to [[Henry III of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;III]] or [[Edward I of England|Edward&amp;nbsp;I]], but nowadays generally listed under ''Ancient Statutes of Uncertain Date'' and presumed to be from c. 1250 - 1305. It states, ''By Consent of the whole Realm the King’s Measure was made, so that an English Penny, which is called the Sterling, round without clipping, shall weigh Thirty-two Grains of Wheat dry in the midst of the Ear; Twenty-pence make an Ounce; and Twelve Ounces make a Pound, and Eight Pounds make a Gallon of Wine; and Eight Gallons of Wine make a Bushel of London; which is the Eighth Part of a Quarter.''&lt;ref name="Ashley1888"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir William James Ashley|authorlink=William Ashley (economic historian)|title=An Introduction to English Economic History and Theory: The Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wm48AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA171|accessdate=1 February 2012|year=1888|publisher=Rivingtons|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1496, ''An Act for Weights and Measures'' (12 Henry&amp;nbsp;VII. c5.) stated ''That the Measure of a Bushel contain viij. Gallons of Wheat, and that every Gallon contain viij. li. of Wheat of Troy Weight, and every Pound contain xij. Ounces of Troy Weight, and every Ounce contain xx. Sterlings, and every Sterling be of the Weight of xxxij. Corns of Wheat that grew in the Midst of the Ear of Wheat, according to the old Laws of this Land.''&lt;ref name="BritainEvans1836-312"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Great Britain|author2=William David Evans|author3=Anthony Hammond|author4=Thomas Colpitts Granger|title=A collection of statutes connected with the general administration of the law: arranged according to the order of subjects|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sbcuAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA312|accessdate=4 January 2012|year=1836|publisher=W. H. Bond|pages=312–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though this bushel does not quite fit the description of the Winchester bushel, the national standard prototype bushel constructed the following year (and still in existence) is near enough to a Winchester bushel that it is generally considered the first, even though it was not known by that name at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssplprints.com/image/91818/unattributed-standard-henry-vii-winchester-bushel-1497-1509 Winchester Bushel - Science Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Winchester bushel is first mentioned by name in a statute of 1670 entitled ''An Act for ascertaining the Measures of Corn and Salt'' (22 [[Charles II of England|Charles&amp;nbsp;II]]. c8.) which states, ''And that if any person or persons after the time aforesaid shall sell any sort of corn or grain, ground or unground, or any kind of salt, usually sold by the bushel, either in open market, or any other place, by any other bushel or measure than that which is agreeable to the standard, marked in his Majesty's exchequer, commonly called the ''Winchester'' measure, containing eight gallons to the bushel, and no more or less, and the said bushel strucken even by the wood or brim of the same by the seller, and sealed as this act directs, he or they shall forfeit for every such offence the sum of forty shillings''.&lt;ref name="Britain1670-287"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain|title=Statutes at Large ...: (43 v.) ... From Magna charta to 1800|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wKg3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA287|accessdate=6 January 2012|volume=8|year=1763|publisher=Printed by Joseph Bentham|pages=287–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is first defined in law by a statute of 1696-7 (8 &amp; 9 William&amp;nbsp;III c 22. s 9 &amp; s 45) ''And to the End all His Majesties Subjects may know the Content of the Winchester Bushell whereunto this Act referrs, and that all Disputes and Differences about Measure may be prevented for the future, it is hereby declared that every round Bushel with a plain and even Bottom, being Eighteen Inches and a Halfe wide throughout, &amp; Eight Inches deep, shall be esteemed a legal Winchester Bushel according to the Standard in His Majesty's Exchequer.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=46870&amp;strquery=winchester%20bushel#s45 Statutes of the Realm: volume 7: 1695-1701 (1820), pp. 247-257]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1824 a new [[statute|Act]] was passed in which the gallon was defined as the volume of ten pounds of pure water at 62&amp;nbsp;°[[Fahrenheit|F]] with the other units of volume changing accordingly. The "Winchester bushel", which was some 3% smaller than the new bushel (eight new gallons), was retained in the English grain trade until formally abolished in 1835. In 1836, the [[United States Department of the Treasury]] formally adopted the Winchester bushel as the standard for dealing in grain and, defined as 2,150.42 cubic inches, it remains so today.

==Measures in the city museum==
None of Edgar's standard measures, which were probably made of wood, remain, but the city's copy of the standard yard, although stamped with the official mark of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth&amp;nbsp;I]], may date from the early twelfth century, during the reign of [[Henry I of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;I]]. Preserved standard weights date from 1357 and, although the original bushel is lost, a standard bushel, gallon and quart made of [[bronze]], issued in 1497 and stamped with the mark of [[Henry VII of England|Henry&amp;nbsp;VII]] are still held.
