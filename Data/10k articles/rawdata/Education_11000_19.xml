In [[academia]], an '''audit''' is an [[education]]al term for the completion of a course of study for which no assessment of the performance of the student is made nor [[grade (education)|grade]] awarded.&lt;ref name="Flinders"&gt;[http://www.flinders.edu.au/future-students/courses/auditing-a-topic.cfm] Retrieved on 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Some institutions may record a grade of "audit" to those who have elected not to receive a letter grade for a course in which they are typically awarded.

In this case, 'audit' indicates that the individual merely has received teaching, rather than being evaluated as having achieved a given standard of knowledge of the subject. The term 'audit' is Latin, translating as, 'he/she hears'. In other words, the student has experienced the course, but has not been assessed.

Some students audit a class merely for enjoyment, including purposes of self-enrichment and academic exploration, with no need or desire of academic credit.&lt;ref name="University of Wisconsin KnowledgeBase"&gt;[https://kb.wisc.edu/ls/page.php?id=26734] Retrieved on 13 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes this technique is employed by individuals who wish to take a specific course without the risk of under-performance resulting in a poor or failing grade. This may be helpful when reviewing a long-unstudied subject, or when first beginning or exploring the study of a discipline where one has little experience or confidence.

Auditing is generally an option at institutions of higher learning, such as [[college]]s and  [[university|universities]], rather than [[grammar school]] or [[secondary school]].

When and where '''campus streaking''' started is unknown. [[Streaking]] seems to have been well-established on some college campuses by the mid-1960s. For example, a 1967 article in the student paper at [[Carleton College]] in Minnesota laments: "Examples of [Carleton's social problems] are the large number of departing female students, the rise of class spirit, low grades, streaking, destruction, drinking, and the popularity of rock dances." (At that time, streaking was already a tradition on the Minnesota campus, during January and February when temperatures were well below freezing.)&lt;ref&gt;''The Carletonian'', [[Carleton College]], January 26, 1967, "Crash Syndrome", by John Mollenkopf&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, in December 1973, called streaking "a growing [[Los Angeles]]-area fad" that was "catching on among college students and other groups".&lt;ref&gt;"Takeoff", ''Time'', December 10, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; A letter writer responded, "Let it be known that streakers have plagued the campus police at [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] for the past decade", pointing out that a group of students there sponsored a "Streakers' Olympics" in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;"Letters", ''Time'', December 31, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Records==
The current record for the largest group streak was established at the [[University of Georgia]], with 1,543 simultaneous streakers on March 7, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Andy |last=Pearson |title=1974: Univ. 'cracks' streaking record |url=http://media.www.redandblack.com/media/storage/paper871/news/2004/03/05/News/1974-Univ.cracks.Streaking.Record-2576112.shtml  |work=The Red and Black |publisher= |id= |pages= |page= |date=2004-03-05 |accessdate=2007-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] comes in second with 1,200 streakers, and the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] ranks third, with 553 naked students streaking three miles in March 1974. [[Erskine College]] claimed the highest ''[[Per capita|per-capita]]'' streak, when 25% of its 600 students participated in a streaking party in 1974. It is also believed that an alumnus from Cornell College in Iowa has streaked the homecoming pep rally (estimated 1,200 attendees) 7 consecutive years without being caught. This individual streaked all four years he attended Cornell College and continued to streak for the 3&amp;nbsp;years following his graduation. {{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

==United States==

===Florida State University===
The trend of streaking across campus, started at Florida State University in the early 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[[History of Florida State University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill===
Twice a year, the night before the first exam, at midnight, a group of 40-70 streaks around the two main libraries on campus in order to let off some steam, have fun, and share the love of school-spirit. The students run around shouting things such as "Study!" and "Express yourself!" These encouraging streakers are watched by a massive crowd of no less than 500 students, and at the end, in an open area of the second library, they and the watching students participate in singing the Alma Mater. The name of this streak is The UL (Undergraduate Library) Streak, and was traditionally only held in the one library for which it is named. Streaking started in the 1960s, and Davis Library was added in the mid 1980s; shortly after it was built the streakers decided to spread their fiasco. Everyone is encouraged to join.

===California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo===
Once a year the annual "Streak Hathway" event occurs. Students run nude down Hathway St. T-shirts are sold to raise money for Breast Cancer research.

===Carleton College===
Streaking at [[Carleton College]] is a custom that spans half a century and garners participation from all sectors of the student body. Naked runs are regular fixtures on campus. While officially unsanctioned, the events are widely accepted by the administration and generally supported by the student body. Streaking is common during major campus events. While streaking may occur anywhere on campus, common targets include midnight breakfast and the Libe (during reading days and often during the Silent Dance Party), the Arb, and certain convocations (i.e. the opening frisbee toss). Carleton streakers also hit the St. Olaf campus, and on at least one occasion, streaked through Buntrock Commons.

The men's and women's cross country teams are particularly well known for their streaking. Both teams have historically participated in "naked laps" at Stadium and welcome the first snow of each year with a naked run.

The streaking team at Carleton is named Nudels.

===University of California===
The [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] has an annual fall tradition known as [[First Rain]], where students begin the run in [[Porter College]] and run naked around the campus during the first rainfall of the fall season, usually in October.

The [[University of California, Berkeley]] has a biannual tradition during each semester's [[final examination]]s in which students (typically those in [[student housing cooperative]]s) streak through [[Moffitt Library]]. Since the run takes place in the midst of finals, the library tends to have a higher student presence, thereby increasing the shocking effect.

===Centre College===
The students of Centre College have incorporated "Running the Flame" into tradition and legend, making it a pseudo-requirement for graduation. Students run naked from their dorms to The Flame, a statue on campus, and back. A longer version called the "Triathlon", includes two campus fountains.

===University of Chicago===
Streaking became an annual campus tradition at the [[University of Chicago]] in 1983, during their ''Kuviasungnerk'' winter festival, to help students kick the winter blues. It is called the Polar Bear run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/08/080110.polar.bear.shtml |title=University of Chicago News Office &amp;#124; University of Chicago Annual Polar Bear Run and Salute to the Sun to be held Friday, Jan. 18 |publisher=News.uchicago.edu |date=2008-01-10 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are often more spectators than actual participants.

===Dartmouth College===
[[Dartmouth College]] has two streaking-related challenges: The Ledyard Challenge, in which students [[human swimming|swim]] naked across the [[Connecticut River]] and run nude back across the bridge,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dartreview.com/archives/2005/08/26/the_week_in_review.php# |title=The Dartmouth Review: The Week in Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2009-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061020045901/http://www.dartreview.com/archives/2005/08/26/the_week_in_review.php# |archive-date=2006-10-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Blue Light Challenge, in which streaking students attempt to press the alarm on every one of the campus's blue light emergency phones.&lt;ref name="thedartmouth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2005111805030|title=The Dartmouth - What are we talking about?|publisher=thedartmouth.com|accessdate=2014-01-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202215202/http://www.thedartmouth.com/article.php?aid=2005111805030#|archive-date=2014-02-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, a Thursday Night Streaking Club regularly streaks at various events and public places.&lt;ref&gt;Quite often during stressful final examination periods, individuals will streak through exam rooms and distribute confectionary and other sweet goods. [http://www.dartmouthindependent.com/archives/2005/05/the_naked_truth.html The Dartmouth Independent: The Naked Truth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204123635/http://www.dartmouthindependent.com/archives/2005/05/the_naked_truth.html# |date=2007-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, streaking is a common occurrence for large final exams. Streaking is employed to encourage friends in finals and introduce a sense of levity in the bleak times of finals week.

===Denison University===
Students at [[Denison University]] in Granville, Ohio, started a tradition called Naked Week in 2003, usually held in the second half of February; hundreds of students run naked across a different quad every night, and each night has a different theme. Opening ceremonies begin with students running out of the library and across the academic quad (record of 39 naked runners in 2015).&lt;ref name="denisonian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.denisonian.com/media/storage/paper1253/news/2008/03/04/ArtsEntertainment/Attack.Of.The.Naked.Students-3250812.shtml|title=Attack of the naked students|author=Ally Klein|date=March 3, 2008|publisher=media.www.denisonian.com|accessdate=2014-01-29|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110225063629/http://media.www.denisonian.com/media/storage/paper1253/news/2008/03/04/ArtsEntertainment/Attack.Of.The.Naked.Students-3250812.shtml|archivedate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grove City College===

The cross country team at Grove City&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.gcc.edu/sports/New/MCrossCountry/home.htm|title=Grove City College Athletics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; boasts a long record of streaking activities that occur every spring before finals week. This tradition began well over 50 years ago and continues to this day. The night before exams at midnight is marked by a several mile streak around a campus loop. In past years students have been pursued by campus safety and local police officers, but few have ever been caught.

===Hamilton College===
[[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College of New York]] has a [[Varsity team|Varsity]] Streaking Team, which, until recently, boasted an undefeated record. The team received positive coverage in the ''[[New York Times]]'' in 2004 after streaking twelve private colleges in the New England region. Other victories include [[Colgate University]] and [[Princeton University]], the latter sparked by a challenge from that school's streaking squad. The [[Williams College]] "Springstreakers" defeated Hamilton in spring 2005: fifteen members of the Williams team made a full circuit of the Hamilton library the night before their final examinations began, streaking about 200 people and giving the Hamilton team their first loss. {{cite web|title=Hamilton College Varsity Streaking Team |url=http://www.jockandbuttons.com/hamiltonstreaks/si.html |work= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107002741/http://www.jockandbuttons.com/hamiltonstreaks/si.html |archivedate=January 7, 2009 }}   It was reported, however, that many Williams students had failed to remove all of their clothing, calling into question the final score.

===Harvard===
The last night before [[final examination]]s at [[Harvard University]] sees undergraduates participating in a [[Primal Scream (Harvard)|Primal Scream]]. Students disrobe and run a lap around [[Harvard Yard]]. This is done in both semesters, even during [[New England]] winters. Some of the streakers will dress in capes and masks, or [[top hat]] and tails, but their [[Sex organ|genitalia]] are still exposed. The walkways through which the streakers run are lined with spectators and the school's [[marching band]] plays beforehand to excite the crowd.

===Lawrence University===
Streaking at [[Lawrence University]] in Appleton, Wisconsin, has often been associated with the [[Great Midwest Trivia Contest]]. Also, the end of the year Senior Streak is a historic tradition that was suppressed in the early 2000s. The revival of the Senior Streak will be going on its thirteenth year in 2018.

===Lewis &amp; Clark College===
Students of [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] began their naked mile tradition as a response to the arrest of some of its students at a downtown protest.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Since then the mile has remained as a celebration of [[body image]], encouraging students to come naked, in body paint, or wearing [[underwear]]/[[Brassiere|bra]]/whatever they feel comfortable in without question or judgment. Students continue to honor the legacy each year on prospective student weekend and running in solidarity through the school.

===Loyola Marymount University===
[[Loyola Marymount University]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]] boasts three traditions that a student must complete before graduation; climbing the school's belltower, sliding down a large "LMU" sign on the school's bluff, and streaking through the school's Sunken Gardens. This tradition dates back to Loyola University, the school's predecessor.

===University of Michigan===
In 1986, the [[University of Michigan]]'s Naked Mile celebrated the last day of class with a group streak across campus along an approximate one-mile path. At the height of its popularity in the late 1990s, between 500 and 800 students would participate, including several hundred females. Over 1,400 students participated one year and well over one thousand during another year.  However, due to enforcement of [[public indecency]] laws and pressure from administration officials concerned about increasing spectator crowds and videotaping, participation declined. The last Naked Mile in earnest was run in 1999. By 2001, a mere 24 students participated signaling the effective end of the Naked MIle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nakedmile.com/history.html&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Students were warned by college administrators that streakers would be arrested and required to [[Sex offender registries in the United States|register as a sex offender]] for life under [[Megan's Law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charmandrigor.com/clips/playboy-earnest.html Charm And Rigor — Richard Morgan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New College of Florida ===
From the 1990s through to at least 2011, upperclasspersons enrolled at the Florida state honors college [[New College of Florida]] streaked the population of first-year students during its first week on campus. The streak took place immediately following the students' first meetings with their [[resident assistant]]s, on their first day living in the expressly first-year portion of their residential campus. The streak was designed to appear to interrupt each of the three meetings as it passed through them, but in truth was arranged with the RAs each year. It was specifically intended that the streak take place in front of as many of the students' parents as possible, before they had finished helping their children move in and acclimate.

===Northern Michigan University===
To celebrate the first snowfall of every year, the men of the Brule house in Gant hall streak through their courtyard, completing three laps. The tradition started sometime in the 70s and continues to this day. Each year hundreds of students gather to watch this event.

===University of Notre Dame===
During study days before finals week each semester, residents of [[Zahm Hall]] streak through the LaFortune Student Center. There have been attempts by Notre Dame Security Police (NDSP) to prevent the event, but to date, such attempts have been unsuccessful.

===Oberlin College===
There are records of streaking at Oberlin dating back to 1974.&lt;ref name="Streakers Here!"&gt;{{cite web|last=Mykyta |first=Myron|title=Streakers Here! |url=http://dcollections.oberlin.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15963coll9/id/5867 |publisher=The Oberlin Review|date=8 March 1974 |accessdate=5 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several incidents of streaking in 2008 led to changes in policies regarding prospective students.&lt;ref name="Hospitality at Harkness Brings Trouble to OSCA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaplan-Woolner|first=Jonah|title=Hospitality at Harkness Brings Trouble to OSCA |url=http://oberlin.edu/stupub/ocreview/2008/05/02/ISSUE.pdf |publisher=The Oberlin Review|date=2 May 2008 |accessdate=5 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pennsylvania State University===
Every year at midnight on the Sunday night before finals students streak down Mifflin Road as a way to relieve pre-finals anxiety. The event is not publicized by the University but it is widely known among students when it is going to be held. In previous years part of the fun of the night was that the streakers would have to outrun the police (who would try to catch them to charge them with public indecency) however in 2009 this was not the case. This is because the previous year (2008) a case was made by a Penn State student that her crime was not public indecency due to the fact that everyone that is outside at this time knows what they are going to see and has consented to it, that all participants are over the age of 18, and that no children should be in this area and awake at this time. She won her case and since then police have acted much more like a peacekeeping force than anything.&lt;ref name="Penn State Student Wins Streaking Case"&gt;{{cite web|last=Murphy|first=Elizabeth|title=Streak raises eyebrows, keeps tradition alive |url=http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archives/article_0fad2d00-93bd-579f-b8d0-5540ac2f4638.html |publisher=The Daily Collegian|date=1 May 2009 |accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is highly enjoyable for all students with up to 50 or more participating each year and it is widely regarded as a time-honored tradition.

===Princeton===
[[Princeton University]] has had a long tradition of streaking. The term "running a streak" was in use by 1966. The preferred time for streaking was after midnight on weekends when coed parties were ending, the course being down Prospect Avenue, across campus, and ending in the runner's dorm. A streaking incident in 1970 was meant as a one-time [[prank]], but in time, streaking became a tradition of the [[Sophomore year|sophomore]] class, and rules were drafted for the event. The tradition declined in the 1990s and the administration chose not to tolerate the event anymore; the Board of Trustees voted to ban the practice in 1999 because it was becoming dangerous and attracting too many outsiders.

===Reed College===
Picting is one of the traditions that takes place during Renn Fayre, the annual festival that marks the end of the academic year at Reed College. Students cover themselves in blue paint and run naked around the campus while another group of students attempt to spray the streakers with orange paint.

===Rice===
Baker 13 is one of the most enduring student traditions at [[Rice University]]. At 10&amp;nbsp;p.m. on the 13th and 31st of every month (the 26th if a month without a 31st), a group of students runs around the entire campus wearing nothing but shaving cream. Although the event usually only attracts a small number of students, on Halloween and the last relevant day of the schoolyear (usually April 26), the event is very large, regularly attracting over 100 students. The event is so named because it begins and ends at Baker College.

===Swarthmore College===
The men's and women's [[rugby union]] teams at [[Swarthmore College]] engage in a streaking [[fundraiser]] each semester known as the "Dash for Cash", in which the team members run naked through Parrish Hall, the main administration building. Spectators are expected to bring money, which the streakers grab from their hands as they run by.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.www.westerncourier.com/media/storage/paper650/news/2002/04/26/News/Rugby.Players.Streak.For.Good.Cause-442214.shtml|title=Rugby players streak for good cause - News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activity has been known to catch bystanders unawares, despite heavy publicity featuring the [[slogan]], "Bring money, or you're a pervert."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phoenix.swarthmore.edu/2003/2003-11-13/living/phoenix_12.pdf|title=Dashing for Cashing |accessdate=February 4, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080410235146/http://phoenix.swarthmore.edu/2003/2003-11-13/living/phoenix_12.pdf |archivedate=April 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tufts===
The [[Naked Quad Run]] was an annual tradition among the student body at [[Tufts University]] in Medford, Massachusetts. Every December, on the night of the final day of fall semester classes, students gathered during the evening to run naked around the Rez Quad several times. Because of injuries during previous years when the event was unsanctioned by the university, the administration designated the evening as the Nighttime Quad Reception and provides refreshments and entertainment.  After an increase in incidents related to alcohol toxicity and a student arrest, the tradition was ended by Tufts University President Lawrence Bacow in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bacow Ends Naked Quad Run|url=http://www.tuftsdaily.com/bacow-ends-naked-quad-run-1.2512711#.TuYwIWMk67s|work=The Tufts Daily|accessdate=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Virginia===
At the [[University of Virginia]], tradition holds that prior to graduating, students must run naked from the steps of the [[The Rotunda (University of Virginia)|Rotunda]] and down the 740-foot Lawn to kiss the buttocks of a [[Homer (Ezekiel)|statue of Homer]], before running back up the Lawn to peer through the keyhole of the Rotunda, which affords a view of the marble statue of the school's founder, [[Thomas Jefferson]], before they retrieve their clothes. In 1995, a mass streak was organized to protest a police crackdown on the practice.

===Union College===
The students at [[Union College]] of [[New York City]] held midnight "Pajama Parade" events in 1862, 1914 and several times in the 1950s. The real streaking tradition, which was nationally popular since 1973, arrived at the campus in the 1990s in the form of a nocturnal lap around the [[Nott Memorial]] known as the "Naked Nott Run."&lt;ref name="union"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.union.edu/About/traditions/pajama.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511232301/http://www.union.edu/About/traditions/pajama.php |archive-date=2008-05-11 |dead-url=yes|title=About/traditions/pajama|publisher=eb.archive.org|accessdate=2014-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wellesley College===
At [[Wellesley College]], students streak across Severance Green throughout the year. The streak is customarily followed by skinny dipping in Lake Waban, both of which have been listed as one of the 50 things a Wellesley student must do before she graduates.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wellesley.edu/studentlife/campus/50things&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wheaton College===
Wheaton students practice a streak called "The Kingdom Run".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheaton.edu/Students/The-Record/Archives/Spring-2013/May-3-2013/Perspectives-From-the-President|title=Perspectives From the President - Wheaton|first=Wheaton|last=College|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasionally Billy Graham graduate students also participate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wheaton.edu/Buildings/Billy-Graham-Center Billy Graham Center | Wheaton&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  At the end of 2013, eight such characters participated in a streak.

===College of William &amp; Mary===
At [[The College of William &amp; Mary]], students do a traditional "[[triathlon]]". The first part requires streaking the length of the [[Sunken Garden (Virginia)|Sunken Garden]], a grassy area in the middle of campus. The other parts are swimming across the Crim Dell (a small pond) and jumping a wall and completing the maze in the [[Governor's Palace (Williamsburg, Virginia)|Governor's Palace]] in nearby [[Colonial Williamsburg]].

===University of Vermont===
At UVM, students participate in the Naked Bike Ride at midnight at the end of each semester. They run, bike, unicycle, carry kayaks, push shopping carts, or pull sleds. Historically the bike ride has occurred around athletic campus. The topic of the Naked Bike Ride has been a touchy one among UVM police, who have tried several times to do away with it. In 2011, Interim President John Bramley ended school funding for the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uvm.edu/~presdent/letters/Bramley%20Memo%20to%20UVM%20RE%20Naked%20Bike%20Ride%2011-17-11.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; This resulted in the student body creating the UVM Green Caps, a group of student volunteers stationed around campus throughout the evening for the safety of students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vermontcynic.com/help-wanted-keep-nbr-safe-1.2678743?MMode=true |title=Help wanted: keep NBR safe - Vermont Cynic - University of Vermont |publisher=Vermont Cynic |date=2011-12-01 |accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yale University===
At [[Yale University]], the prankster group The Pundits streaks through [[Bass Library]] at midnight on the first day of finals week, and many other students join in.

==Other countries==

===University of the Philippines===
At the [[University of the Philippines]], members of the [[Alpha Phi Omega (Philippines)|Alpha Phi Omega]] fraternity streak around the campus in an annual event known as the [[Oblation Run]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/aphio_kappaalpha/id28.html|title=OBLATION RUN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The run started in 1977 to protest the banning of the movie, "Hubad na Bayani", which depicted human rights abuses in the martial law era and continues as a protest action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/metro/view/20071215-107020/Nude_runners_on_UP_campus_call_for_Arroyo_ouster# |title="Nude runners on UP campus call for Arroyo ouster" |access-date=2009-10-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916185110/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/metro/view/20071215-107020/Nude_runners_on_UP_campus_call_for_Arroyo_ouster# |archive-date=2011-09-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Alicante===
In 2011, the first nudist race took place at the [[University of Alicante]] (Spain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diarioinformacion.com/alicante/2011/06/01/cueros-universidad/1133341.html|title=En cueros por la Universidad - Informacion.es|first=|last=INFORMACION|publisher=|trans-title=Nudist race at UA|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the race was to ''leave clothes behind'' and those garments were donated to an NGO (Proyecto Lázaro) that gives them a second use or recycle them to get funds for charitable funds.

The race took place once the classes period had finished and previous to the exam weeks.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4681">'''The Chinese Educational Mission''' or '''CEM''' (1872–1881) was the pioneering but frustrated attempt by reform-minded officials of the [[Qing dynasty]] to educate a group of 120 Chinese students in the United States.

In 1871, [[Yung Wing]], himself the first Chinese graduate of Yale University, persuaded the Chinese [[Qing dynasty|government]] to send supervised groups of young Chinese to the United States to study Western science and engineering. With the government's eventual approval, he organized what came to be known as the Chinese Educational Mission, which included 120 students, some under the age of ten, to study in the New England region of the United States beginning in 1872. The boys arrived in several detachments, lived with American families in Hartford, Connecticut, and other New England towns; and after graduating high school, went on to college, especially at Yale. When a new supervisory official arrived, he found that they had adopted many American customs, such as playing baseball, and felt they were neglecting their Chinese heritage and becoming "denationalized." In addition, external pressures such as the US government's refusal in 1878 to permit students to attend the Military Academy at West Point and the Naval Academy at Annapolis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Termination and Recall|url=http://www.cemconnections.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=39&amp;limit=1&amp;limitstart=1|website=CEM Connections}}&lt;/ref&gt; in contravention of the [[Burlingame Treaty]] of 1868 called the whole purpose of the mission, the acquisition of Western military expertise, into question. Due to internal and external pressures, the mission was ended in 1881. When the boys returned to China, they were confined and interrogated.&lt;ref&gt;Liel Leibovitz Matthew I. Miller, ''Fortunate Sons: The 120 Chinese Boys Who Came to America, Went to School, and Revolutionized an Ancient Civilization'' (New York: Norton,  2011), Chapters 5-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influential official [[Huang Zunxian]] wrote a poem which admitted that the students had lived luxurious lives and become Americanized, but lamented the lost opportunity:

:Unfortunately, in the Imperial Academy
:The curriculum has not included Western learning.
:Withal, on the promotion of science
:Now depends the future of the nation.
:A decade's effort in training youths
:Will lay the foundation for a century's wealth and strength.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Hung (sinologist)|William Hung]], "Huang Tsun-Hsien's Poem "The Closure of the Educational Mission in America"," ''Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies'' 18.1/2  (1955):  50-73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the students later returned to China and made significant contributions to China's civil services, engineering, and the sciences. Prominent students on the mission included [[Liang Cheng]], [[Tang Shaoyi]], Tsai Ting Kan ([[Cai Tinggan]]), and Tien You Jeme ([[Zhan Tianyou]]).

==History==
Coahoma County Agricultural High School was established in 1924. It was one of the first agricultural high schools for [[African Americans|Blacks]] in Mississippi. A junior college curriculum was added in 1949 and the institution's name was changed to Coahoma Junior College and Agricultural High School. The school was [[Desegregation|desegregated]] in 1965, although the student body has remained mostly and in recent years, exclusively African American.

Coahoma Junior College was removed from the title of Coahoma County Agricultural High School in 1975 and in 1981, the school began operating separately from the [[Coahoma County School District]] and dropped the word "county" from its name.

A 2012 report by [[Augenblick, Palaich and Associates]] suggested changing the school's focus to an [[early college]] school and/or merging it. It stated that the school's academic performance was below the state average and that the school no longer had a focus on agriculture.&lt;ref name=Boardrec/&gt;

On July 1, 2018, the original Coahoma County Agricultural High School will be dissolved, with the Coahoma Early College High School taking its place. [[Governor of Mississippi]] [[Phil Bryant]] signed into law Senate Bill 2501, which will require this change in the school, in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fox13memphis.com/news/bryant-signs-5-bills-to-consolidate-some-school-districts/278497219|title=Bryant signs 5 bills to consolidate some school districts|publisher=Fox 13 Memphis|date=2016-05-12|accessdate=2017-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
A majority of the Coahoma AHS student body comes from the towns of [[Friars Point, Mississippi|Friars Point]], [[Coahoma, Mississippi|Coahoma]], [[Lula, Mississippi|Lula]], and [[Jonestown, Coahoma County, Mississippi|Jonestown]] – all part of the Coahoma County School District. A limited number of students from the [[Clarksdale Municipal School District]] opt to attend Coahoma AHS instead of [[Clarksdale High School]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

In the 2014-15 school year, the school enrolled 267 black students, 1 Hispanic, and no white students.&lt;ref name="nces171202"&gt;{{cite web|title=School Directory Information 2014-15|url=https://nces.ed.gov/ccd/schoolsearch/school_detail.asp?Search=1&amp;InstName=coahoma&amp;SchoolType=1&amp;SchoolType=2&amp;SchoolType=3&amp;SchoolType=4&amp;SpecificSchlTypes=all&amp;IncGrade=-1&amp;LoGrade=-1&amp;HiGrade=-1&amp;ID=280110000137|publisher=National Center for Education Statistics|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
The president of Coahoma Community College also serves as superintendent of the Coahoma Agricultural High School. The same board of trustees governs both the high school and community college.

In addition to the superintendent and board of trustees, Coahoma AHS has the same administrative personnel common in other public high schools, including a principal and assistant principal.

'''Education''' is the process of facilitating [[learning]], or the acquisition of [[knowledge]], [[skill]]s, [[values]], [[belief]]s, and [[habit (psychology)|habits.]] Educational methods include [[storytelling]], [[discussion]], [[teaching]], [[training]], and directed [[research]]. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also [[autodidacticism|educate themselves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The methodology of teaching is called [[pedagogy]].

Formal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as [[preschool]] or [[kindergarten]], [[primary school]], [[secondary school]] and then [[college]], [[university]], or [[apprenticeship]].

A [[right to education]] has been recognized by some governments and the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name="ICESCR-art13.1"&gt;Article 13 of the [[United Nations]]' 1966 [[International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights]] recognizes a universal right to education. ''ICESCR'', Article 13.1&lt;/ref&gt; In most regions, education is [[compulsory education|compulsory]] up to a certain age.

==Etymology==
[[Etymologically]], the word "education" is derived from the Latin ''[[wikt:en:educatio#Latin|ēducātiō]]'' ("A breeding, a bringing up, a rearing") from ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēducō]]'' ("I educate, I train") which is related to the [[homonym]] ''[[wikt:en:educo#Latin|ēdūcō]]'' ("I lead forth, I take out; I raise up, I erect") from ''[[wikt:en:e-#Latin|ē-]]'' ("from, out of") and ''[[wikt:en:duco#Latin|dūcō]]'' ("I lead, I conduct").&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=educate educate].

[[File:Plato's Academy mosaic from Pompeii.jpg|thumb|left|[[Plato]]'s academy, [[mosaic]] from [[Pompeii]]]]

Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-[[Literacy|literate]] societies, this was achieved orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their [[knowledge]] beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the [[Middle Kingdom of Egypt|Middle Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Mind of Egypt: History and Meaning in the Time of the Pharaohs | author=Assmann, Jan | year=2002 | page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Ricci Guangqi 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Matteo Ricci]] (left) and [[Xu Guangqi]] (right) in the Chinese edition of ''[[Euclid's Elements]]'' published in 1607]]

[[Plato]] founded the [[Platonic Academy|Academy]] in [[Ancient Athens|Athens]], the first institution of higher learning in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name="Br"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Plato|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city of [[Alexandria]] in Egypt, established in 330 BCE, became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of [[Ancient Greece]]. There, the great [[Library of Alexandria]] was built in the 3rd century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy and organization following the fall of Rome in CE 476.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; ''A Very Short History of the World''; Penguin Books, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[China]], [[Confucius]] (551–479 BCE), of the [[State of Lu]], was the country's most influential ancient philosopher, whose educational outlook continues to influence the societies of China and neighbours like Korea, Japan, and Vietnam. Confucius gathered disciples and searched in vain for a ruler who would adopt his ideals for good governance, but his [[Analects]] were written down by followers and have continued to influence education in East Asia into the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2015/03/150325-confucius-china-asia-philosophy-communist-party-ngbooktalk/|title=Why Is Confucius Still Relevant Today?

The [[Aztecs]] also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in [[Nahuatl]] called ''tlacahuapahualiztli.'' It means "the art of raising or educating a person"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Indigenous Education through Dance and Ceremony: A Mexica Palimpsest|last=Colin|first=Ernesto|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=9781349470945|location=New York|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "the art of strengthening or bringing up men."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aztec Thought and Culture: A Study of the Ancient Nahuatl Mind|last=León-Portilla|first=Miguel|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0806105697|location=Norman|pages=134–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a broad conceptualization of education, which prescribed that it begins at home, supported by formal schooling, and reinforced by community living. Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class and gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Non-Western Educational Traditions: Alternative Approaches to Educational Thought and Practice|last=Reagan|first=Timothy|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Publishers|year=2005|isbn=978-0805848571|location=Mahwah, NJ|pages=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also the word ''neixtlamachiliztli'', which is "the act of giving wisdom to the face."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These concepts underscore a complex set of educational practices, which was oriented towards communicating to the next generation the experience and intellectual heritage of the past for the purpose of individual development and his integration into the community.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the [[Fall of Rome]], the [[Catholic Church]] became the sole preserver of literate scholarship in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.nature.com/soapboxscience/2011/05/18/science-owes-much-to-both-christianity-and-the-middle-ages|title=Science owes much to both Christianity and the Middle Ages : Soapbox Science|website=blogs.nature.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church established [[cathedral schools]] in the Early Middle Ages as centres of advanced education. Some of these establishments ultimately evolved into [[medieval universities]] and forebears of many of Europe's modern universities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; During the High Middle Ages, [[Chartres Cathedral]] operated the famous and influential [[School of Chartres|Chartres Cathedral School]]. The medieval universities of Western Christendom were well-integrated across all of Western Europe, encouraged freedom of inquiry, and produced a great variety of fine scholars and natural philosophers, including [[Thomas Aquinas]] of the [[University of Naples]], [[Robert Grosseteste]] of the [[University of Oxford]], an early expositor of a systematic method of scientific experimentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/07037a.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=Robert Grosseteste |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 June 1910 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Saint [[Albertus Magnus|Albert the Great]], a pioneer of biological field research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01264a.htm |work=Catholic Encyclopedia|title=St. Albertus Magnus |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1 March 1907 |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1088, the [[University of Bologne]] is considered the first, and the oldest continually operating university.&lt;ref&gt;Nuria Sanz, Sjur Bergan: "The heritage of European universities", 2nd edition, Higher Education Series No. 7, Council of Europe, 2006, ISBN, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere during the Middle Ages, [[Islamic science]] and [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]] flourished under the Islamic [[caliphate]] which was established across the Middle East, extending from the [[Iberian Peninsula]] in the west to the [[Indus]] in the east and to the [[Almoravid Dynasty]] and [[Mali Empire]] in the south.

[[The Renaissance]] in Europe ushered in a [[Scientific revolution|new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry]] and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, [[Johannes Gutenberg]] developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe. Missionaries and scholars also brought back new ideas from other civilizations&amp;nbsp;– as with the [[Jesuit China missions]] who played a significant role in the transmission of knowledge, science, and culture between China and Europe, translating works from Europe like [[Euclid's Elements]] for Chinese scholars and the thoughts of [[Confucius]] for European audiences. [[The Enlightenment]] saw the emergence of a more secular educational outlook in Europe.

In most countries today, full-time education, whether at school or [[homeschooling|otherwise]], is compulsory for all children up to a certain age. Due to this the proliferation of compulsory education, combined with population growth, [[UNESCO]] has calculated that in the next 30&amp;nbsp;years more people will receive formal education than in all of human history thus far.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, K.: [http://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity.html ''Schools Kill Creativity''].

==Formal education==
Formal education occurs in a [[learning environment|structured environment]] whose explicit purpose is teaching [[student]]s. Usually, formal education takes place in a [[school]] environment with [[classroom]]s of multiple students learning together with a trained, certified teacher of the subject. Most [[Educational management|school systems]] are designed around a set of values or ideals that govern all educational choices in that system. Such choices include curriculum, [[school organizational models|organizational models]], design of the physical [[learning space]]s (e.g. classrooms), student-teacher interactions, methods of assessment, class size, educational activities, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://enhancinged.wgbh.org/started/what/formal.html|title = Enhancing Education|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.competencecentre.eu/index.php/home/74-what-is-the-difference-between-qinformalq-and-qnon-formalq-learning|title =Perspectives Competence Centre, Lifeling Learning Programme|date =|accessdate =|website =|publisher =|deadurl =yes|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141015103040/http://www.competencecentre.eu/index.php/home/74-what-is-the-difference-between-qinformalq-and-qnon-formalq-learning|archivedate =15 October 2014|df =dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preschool===
[[File:Parent's day at Eirfan's Kindergarten.jpg|thumb|Young children in a [[kindergarten]] in Japan]]
{{Main|Early childhood education}}
Preschools provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on the country when children enter [[primary education]]. These are also known as [[nursery schools]] and as [[kindergarten]], except in the US, where kindergarten is a term often used to describe the earliest levels of primary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ecs.org/kindergarten-policies/|title=50-State Comparison: State Kindergarten-Through-Third-Grade Policies|website=www.ecs.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kindergarten "provide[s] a child-centred, preschool curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with balanced emphasis on each of them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ross|first=Elizabeth Dale|title=The Kindergarten Crusade: The Establishment of Preschool in the United States|year=1976|publisher=Athens: Ohio University Press|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Primary===
[[File:Mr. Shake Amargosa.jpg|thumb|Primary school students with their teacher, [[Colombia]], 2014]]
{{Main|Primary education}}
Primary (or elementary) education consists of the first five to seven years of formal, structured education. In general, primary education consists of six to eight years of schooling starting at the age of five or six, although this varies between, and sometimes within, countries. Globally, around 89% of children aged six to twelve are enrolled in primary education, and this proportion is rising.&lt;ref&gt;UNESCO, Education For All Monitoring Report 2008, Net Enrollment Rate in primary education&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[Education For All]] programs driven by [[UNESCO]], most countries have committed to achieving universal enrollment in primary education by 2015, and in many countries, it is compulsory. The division between primary and [[secondary education]] is somewhat arbitrary, but it generally occurs at about eleven or twelve years of age. Some education systems have separate [[middle school]]s, with the transition to the final stage of secondary education taking place at around the age of fourteen. Schools that provide primary education, are mostly referred to as ''primary schools ''or ''elementary schools''. Primary schools are often subdivided into [[infant school]]s and [[junior school]].

In India, for example, [[Compulsory education#Variation in countries|compulsory education]] spans over twelve years, with eight years of elementary education, five years of primary schooling and three years of upper primary schooling. Various states in the republic of India provide 12 years of compulsory school education based on a national [[curriculum]] framework designed by the [[National Council of Educational Research and Training]].

===Secondary===

In most contemporary educational systems of the world, secondary education comprises the formal education that occurs during [[adolescence]]. It is characterized by transition from the typically compulsory, comprehensive [[primary education]] for [[minor (law)|minors]], to the optional, selective [[Tertiary education|tertiary]], "postsecondary", or "[[Higher education|higher]]" education (e.g. [[university]], vocational school) for [[adult]]s. Depending on the system, schools for this period, or a part of it, may be called secondary or [[high school]]s, [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]], [[lyceum]]s, middle schools, [[college]]s, or vocational schools. The exact meaning of any of these terms varies from one system to another. The exact boundary between primary and secondary education also varies from country to country and even within them but is generally around the seventh to the tenth year of schooling.

Secondary education occurs mainly during the teenage years. In the United States, Canada, and [[Australia]], primary and secondary education together are sometimes referred to as [[K–12 (education)|K-12]] education, and in New Zealand Year 1–13 is used. The purpose of secondary education can be to give [[common knowledge]], to prepare for [[higher education]], or to train directly in a [[profession]].

Secondary education in the United States did not emerge until 1910, with the rise of large corporations and advancing technology in factories, which required [[skilled worker]]s. In order to meet this new job demand, [[High school (North America)|high schools]] were created, with a curriculum focused on practical job skills that would better prepare students for [[White-collar worker|white collar]] or skilled [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] work. This proved beneficial for both employers and employees, since the improved human capital lowered costs for the employer, while skilled employees received higher wages.

Secondary education has a longer history in Europe, where grammar schools or academies date from as early as the 16th century, in the form of [[Public education|public schools]], [[fee-paying school]]s, or charitable educational foundations, which themselves date even further back.

[[Community college]]s offer another option at this transitional stage of education. They provide nonresidential junior college courses to people living in a particular area.

===Tertiary (higher)===

{{see also|Higher education|Adult education}}
[[File:Michelle Obama speaking at Peking university.jpg|thumb|Universities often host prominent guest speakers for student audiences, e.g. [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Michelle Obama]] delivering remarks at [[Peking University]], [[Beijing]], [[China]]]]
Higher education, also called tertiary, third stage, or postsecondary education, is the non-compulsory educational level that follows the completion of a school such as a high school or [[secondary school]]. Tertiary education is normally taken to include [[undergraduate]] and [[postgraduate education]], as well as [[vocational education|vocational education and training]]. Colleges and universities mainly provide tertiary education. Collectively, these are sometimes known as tertiary institutions. Individuals who complete tertiary education generally receive [[Academic certificate|certificates]], [[diploma]]s, or [[academic degree]]s.

Higher education typically involves work towards a degree-level or [[foundation degree]] qualification. In most developed countries, a high proportion of the population (up to 50%) now enter higher education at some time in their lives. Higher education is therefore very important to national [[economies]], both as a significant industry in its own right and as a source of trained and educated personnel for the rest of the economy.

University education includes teaching, research, and social services activities, and it includes both the undergraduate level (sometimes referred to as [[tertiary education]]) and the [[graduate student|graduate]] (or postgraduate) level (sometimes referred to as [[graduate school]]). Some universities are composed of several colleges.

One type of university education is a [[liberal arts]] education, which can be defined as a "[[college]] or [[university]] [[curriculum]] aimed at imparting broad general knowledge and developing general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, [[vocational education|vocational]], or technical curriculum."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Liberal Arts: ''Britannica Concise Encyclopædia''| work = [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] | url= http://concise.britannica.com/ebc/article-9370154/liberal-arts}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although what is known today as liberal arts education began in [[Europe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =Philip | last =Harriman | title = Antecedents of the Liberal Arts College| year =1935|jstor=1975506 | pages =63–71 | volume =6 | issue =2 | journal =The Journal of Higher Education | ref =harv | doi =10.2307/1975506}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term "[[liberal arts college]]" is more commonly associated with institutions in the [[United States]] such as [[Williams College]] or [[Barnard College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=Inside Higher Ed|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/04/06/liberalarts|accessdate=2015-01-08|date=2009-04-06|first=Elizabeth|last=Redden|title=A Global Liberal Arts Alliance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vocational===
[[File:Fotothek df n-10 0000828.jpg|thumb|Carpentry is normally learned through [[apprenticeship]] with an experienced carpenter]]
{{Main|Vocational education}}

[[Vocational education]] is a form of education focused on direct and practical training for a specific trade or craft. Vocational education may come in the form of an [[apprenticeship]] or [[internship]] as well as institutions teaching courses such as [[carpentry]], [[agriculture]], [[engineering]], [[medicine]], [[architecture]] and [[the arts]].

===Special===
{{Main|Special education}}
In the past, those who were disabled were often not eligible for public education. Children with disabilities were repeatedly denied an education by [[physicians]] or special tutors.  These early physicians (people like [[Itard]], [[Édouard Séguin|Seguin]], [[Samuel Gridley Howe|Howe]], [[Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet|Gallaudet]]) set the foundation for special education today. They focused on individualized instruction and functional skills.  In its early years, special education was only provided to people with severe disabilities, but more recently it has been opened to anyone who has experienced difficulty learning.&lt;ref name="Credo Reference"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Special Education|year=2004|publisher=Oxford: Elsevier Science and Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other educational forms==

===Alternative===
{{Main|Alternative education}}
While considered "alternative" today, most alternative systems have existed since ancient times. After the public school system was widely developed beginning in the 19th century, some parents found reasons to be discontented with the new system. [[Alternative education]] developed in part as a reaction to perceived limitations and failings of [[traditional education]]. A broad range of educational approaches emerged, including [[alternative school]]s, [[autodidacticism|self learning]], [[homeschooling]], and [[unschooling]]. Example [[alternative school]]s include [[Montessori method|Montessori schools]], [[Waldorf education|Waldorf schools]] (or [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner]] schools), [[List of Friends Schools|Friends schools]], [[Sands School]], [[Summerhill School]], [[Walden's Path]], [[The Peepal Grove School]], [[Sudbury Valley School]], [[Jiddu Krishnamurti|Krishnamurti schools]], and [[open classroom]] schools. [[Charter school]]s are another example of alternative education, which have in the recent years grown in numbers in the US and gained greater importance in its public education system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED535992.pdf|title = Federal Investment in Charter Schools|date = October 2011|accessdate = 2 October 2015|website = Institute of Education Sciences|publisher = Center for American Progress|last = Lazarin|first = Melissa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/10/charter-schools_n_4419341.html|title = Charter Schools Continue Dramatic Growth Despite Controversies|date = 10 December 2013|accessdate = 2 October 2015|newspaper = The Huffington Post|last = Resmovits|first = Joy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In time, some ideas from these experiments and paradigm challenges may be adopted as the norm in education, just as [[Friedrich Fröbel]]'s approach to [[early childhood education]] in 19th-century Germany has been incorporated into contemporary [[kindergarten]] classrooms. Other influential writers and thinkers have included the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[humanitarianism|humanitarian]] [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]]; the [[United States|American]] [[transcendentalism|transcendentalists]] [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], and [[Henry David Thoreau]]; the founders of [[educational progressivism|progressive education]], [[John Dewey]] and [[Francis Wayland Parker|Francis Parker]]; and educational pioneers such as [[Maria Montessori]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]], and more recently [[John Caldwell Holt]], [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], [[Frederick Mayer]], [[George Dennison]], and [[Ivan Illich]].

===Indigenous===
[[File:Schoolyard essay2.JPG|thumb|alt=Na Schoolyard.|[[Indigenous education|Teaching indigenous knowledge]], models, and methods in [[Yanyuan County]], [[Sichuan]], China]]
{{Main|Indigenous education}}
[[Indigenous education]] refers to the inclusion of indigenous knowledge, models, methods, and content within formal and non-formal educational systems. Often in a post-colonial context, the growing recognition and use of indigenous education methods can be a response to the erosion and loss of indigenous knowledge and language through the processes of colonialism. Furthermore, it can enable indigenous communities to "reclaim and revalue their languages and cultures, and in so doing, improve the educational success of indigenous students."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor=3099875|author1=May, S.  |author2=Aikman, S. |title=Indigenous Education: Addressing Current Issues and Developments|journal=Comparative Education|volume= 39|issue=2 |year=2003|pages= 139–45|doi=10.1080/03050060302549}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informal learning===
{{main|Informal learning}}
'''Informal learning''' is one of three forms of learning defined by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). Informal learning occurs in a variety of places, such as at [[home]], [[employment|work]], and through daily interactions and shared relationships among members of society.  For many learners, this includes [[language acquisition]], [[cultural norm]]s, and [[manners]].

In informal learning, there is often a reference person, a peer or expert, to guide the learner.  If learners have a personal interest in what they are informally being taught, learners tend to expand their existing knowledge and conceive new ideas about the topic being learned.&lt;ref name=Rogoff&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3102/0091732X16680994 | volume=40 | title=The Organization of Informal Learning | year=2016 | journal=Review of Research in Education | pages=356–401 | last1 = Rogoff | first1 = Barbara | last2 = Callanan | first2 = Maureen | last3 = Gutiérrez | first3 = Kris D. | last4 = Erickson | first4 = Frederick}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a museum is traditionally considered an informal learning environment, as there is room for free choice, a diverse and potentially non-standardized range of topics, flexible structures, socially rich interaction, and no externally imposed assessments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139519526.028 | title=Informal Learning in Museums | journal=The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences | pages=461–478 | last1 = Crowley | first1 = Kevin | last2 = Pierroux | first2 = Palmyre | last3 = Knutson | first3 = Karen| year=2014 | isbn=9781139519526 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While informal learning often takes place outside educational [[school|establishments]] and does not follow a specified curriculum, it can also occur within educational settings and even during formal learning situations. Educators can structure their lessons to directly utilize their students informal learning skills within the education setting.&lt;ref name=Rogoff/&gt;

In the late 19th century, education through play began to be recognized as making an important contribution to child development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GH | last =Mead | title = The Relation of Play to Education| journal = University Record| year =1896| pages =141–45 | volume =1 | url=http://www.brocku.ca/MeadProject/Mead/pubs/Mead_1896.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 20th century, the concept was broadened to include young adults but the emphasis was on physical activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first =GE | last =Johnson | title = Education through recreation| publisher = Cleveland Foundation, Ohio| year =1916|  url=https://archive.org/stream/educationthrough00johnuoft#page/n5/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[L.P. Jacks]], also an early proponent of lifelong learning, described education through recreation: "A master in the art of living draws no sharp distinction between his work and his play, his labour and his leisure, his mind and his body, his education and his recreation. He hardly knows which is which. He simply pursues his vision of excellence through whatever he is doing and leaves others to determine whether he is working or playing. To himself, he always seems to be doing both. Enough for him that he does it well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =LP | last =Jacks | title = Education through recreation| publisher = New York: Harper and Brothers| year =1932| pages =1–2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Education through recreation is the opportunity to learn in a seamless fashion through all of life's activities.&lt;ref name="Ullah 2012 165–170"&gt;{{cite journal | first =Sha | last =Ullah | title = Learning surgically oriented anatomy in a student-run extracurricular club: an education through recreation initiative| journal = Anat Sci Educ| year =2012| pages =165–70 | volume =5 |pmid=22434649 | doi=10.1002/ase.1273 | url=http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?filename=1&amp;article=1175&amp;context=vivianmcalister&amp;type=additional | last2 =Bodrogi | first2 =Andrew | last3 =Cristea | first3 =Octav | last4 =Johnson | first4 =Marjorie | last5 =McAlister | first5 =Vivian C. | issue =3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept has been revived by the [[University of Western Ontario]] to teach [[anatomy]] to medical students.&lt;ref name="Ullah 2012 165–170"/&gt;

===Self-directed learning===
{{Main|Autodidacticism}}
[[Autodidacticism]] (also autodidactism) is a term used to describe self-directed learning. One may become an autodidact at nearly any point in one's life. [[List of autodidacts|Notable autodidacts]] include [[Abraham Lincoln]] (U.S. president), [[Srinivasa Ramanujan]] (mathematician), [[Michael Faraday]] (chemist and physicist), [[Charles Darwin]] (naturalist), [[Thomas Alva Edison]] (inventor), [[Tadao Ando]] (architect), [[George Bernard Shaw]] (playwright), [[Frank Zappa]] (composer, recording engineer, film director), and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (engineer, scientist, mathematician).

===Open education and electronic technology===
{{main|Open education|Educational technology}}

Many large university institutions are now starting to offer free or almost free full courses such as [[Harvard University|Harvard]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] and [[University of California, Berkeley|Berkeley]] teaming up to form [[edX]]. Other universities offering open education are prestigious private universities such as [[Stanford University|Stanford]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins]], the [[University of Pennsylvania|University of Pennylvania]], and [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]], as well as notable public universities including [[Tsinghua University|Tsinghua]], [[Peking University|Peking]], [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Michigan]], and [[University of Virginia]].

Open education has been called the biggest change in the way people learn since the printing press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://neurobonkers.com/2012/08/02/the-single-biggest-change-in-the-way-we-learn-since-the-printing-press/ |title=Free courses provided by Harvard, MIT, Berkeley, Stanford, Princeton, Duke, Johns Hopkins, Edinburgh, U.Penn, U. Michigan, U. Virginia, U. Washington |publisher=Neurobonkers.com |date=2 August 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Harriet Swain |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2012/oct/01/university-campuses-decline-elearning-students? |title=Will university campuses soon be 'over'?  |work=The Guardian |accessdate=2012-10-24 |location=London |date=1 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.&lt;ref&gt;Cloete, ElsabeÂ. "Electronic Education System Model." Department of Computer Science and Information Systems in South Africa, 17 Oct. 2000. Web. 3 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some [[open universities]] do already offer conventional degrees such as the [[Open University]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate. Due to the popularity of open education, these new kind of academic certificates are gaining more respect and equal "[[Academic capital|academic value]]" to traditional degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.good.is/posts/is-the-certificate-the-new-college-degree |title=Is the Certificate the New College Degree?  |publisher=Good.is |date=8 June 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of 182 colleges surveyed in 2009 nearly half said tuition for online courses was higher than for campus-based ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Parry |first=M. |date=2010 |title=Such a Deal? Maybe Not. Online learning can cost more than traditional education. |journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education |volume=57 |issue=11 |url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/Such-a-Deal-Maybe-Not/125103/ |subscription=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent meta-analysis found that online and blended educational approaches had better outcomes than methods that used solely face-to-face interaction.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Education, [https://www2.ed.gov/rschstat/eval/tech/evidence-based-practices/finalreport.pdf Evaluation of Evidence-Based Practices in Online Learning A Meta-Analysis and Review of Online Learning Studies], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education sector ==
[[File:北师大西门.jpg|thumb|[[Beijing Normal University]], which is governed directly by the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Chinese Ministry of Education]], is an example of collaboration between different entities in the education sector]]
The education sector or education system is a group of institutions (ministries of education, local educational authorities, teacher training institutions, schools, universities, etc.) whose primary purpose is to provide education to children and young people in educational settings. It involves a wide range of people ([[curriculum]] developers, inspectors, school principals, teachers, school nurses, students, etc.). These institutions can vary according to different contexts.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002447/244756e.pdf|title=Out in the Open: Education sector responses to violence based on sexual orientation and gender identity/expression|last=UNESCO|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100150-5|location=|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schools deliver education, with support from the rest of the education system through various elements such as [[Education policy|education policies]] and guidelines – to which school policies can refer – curricula and learning materials, as well as pre- and in-service teacher training programmes. The school environment – both physical (infrastructures) and psychological (school climate) – is also guided by school policies that should ensure the well-being of students when they are in school.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] has found that schools tend to perform best when principals have full authority and responsibility for ensuring that students are proficient in core subjects upon graduation. They must also seek feedback from students for quality-assurance and improvement. Governments should limit themselves to monitoring student proficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The education sector is fully integrated into society, through interactions with a large number of stakeholders and other sectors. These include parents, local communities, religious leaders, NGOs, stakeholders involved in health, [[child protection]], justice and law enforcement (police), media and political leadership.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Several UN agencies have asserted that [[Comprehensive sex education|comprehensive sexuality education]] should be integrated into school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development goals==
[[File:Education index UN HDR 2007 2008.PNG|thumb|World map indicating [[Education Index]] (according to 2007/2008 [[Human Development Report]])]]

The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in September 2015, calls for a new vision to address the environmental, social and economic concerns facing the world today. The Agenda includes 17 [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs), including SDG 4 on education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals|last=|first=|publisher=UN|year=2016|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cracking the code: girls' and women's education in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=9789231002335|location=Paris|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1909, the ratio of children in the developing world attending school has increased. Before then, a small minority of boys attended school. By the start of the 21st century, the majority of all children in most regions of the world attended school.

[[Universal Primary Education]] is one of the eight international [[Millennium Development Goals]], towards which progress has been made in the past decade, though barriers still remain.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Liesbet Steer and Geraldine Baudienville 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4755&amp;title=funding-basic-education What drives donor financing of basic education?] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; Securing charitable funding from prospective donors is one particularly persistent problem. Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have indicated that the main obstacles to funding for education include conflicting donor priorities, an immature aid architecture, and a lack of evidence and advocacy for the issue.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Additionally, [[Transparency International]] has identified [[political corruption|corruption]] in the education sector as a major stumbling block to achieving Universal Primary Education in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Addis Ababa |url=http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2010/2010_02_23_aew_launch_en |title=Poor governance jeopardises primary education in Africa |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627021316/http://www.transparency.org/news_room/latest_news/press_releases/2010/2010_02_23_aew_launch_en |archive-date=27 June 2010 |website=Transparency International |date=23 February 2010 |access-date=2011-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, demand in the developing world for improved educational access is not as high as foreigners have expected. Indigenous governments are reluctant to take on the ongoing costs involved. There is also economic pressure from some parents, who prefer their children to earn money in the short term rather than work towards the long-term benefits of education.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}}

A study conducted by the [[UNESCO International Institute for Educational Planning]] indicates that stronger capacities in educational planning and management may have an important spill-over effect on the system as a whole.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite report |last=de Grauwe |first=A. |date=2009 |location=Paris |publisher=UNESCO-IIPE |url=http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/capacity-development/capacity-development-strategies/synthesis.html |title=Capacity development strategies |accessdate=2010-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505082915/http://www.iiep.unesco.org/en/capacity-development/capacity-development-strategies/synthesis.html |archivedate=5 May 2010 |df=dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sustainable capacity development requires complex interventions at the institutional, organizational and individual levels that could be based on some foundational principles:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* national leadership and ownership should be the touchstone of any intervention;
* strategies must be context relevant and context specific;
* plans should employ an integrated set of complementary interventions, though implementation may need to proceed in steps;
* partners should commit to a long-term investment in capacity development while working towards some short-term achievements;
* outside intervention should be conditional on an impact assessment of national capacities at various levels;
* a certain percentage of students should be removed for improvisation of academics (usually practiced in schools, after 10th grade).

===Internationalization===
Nearly every country now has [[Universal Primary Education]].

Similarities – in systems or even in ideas – that schools share internationally have led to an increase in international student exchanges. The European Socrates-[[Erasmus]] Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erasmus.ac.uk |title=Socrates-Erasmus Program |publisher=Erasmus.ac.uk |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; facilitates exchanges across European universities. The [[Soros Foundation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soros.org/ |title=Soros Foundation |publisher=Soros.org |accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides many opportunities for students from central Asia and eastern Europe. Programs such as the [[International Baccalaureate]] have contributed to the internationalization of education. The global campus online, led by American universities, allows free access to class materials and lecture files recorded during the actual classes.

The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] and the [[International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement]] objectively monitor and compare the proficiency of students from a wide range of different nations.

===Education and technology in developing countries===
[[File:OLPC Haiti.jpg|thumb|right|The OLPC laptop being introduced to children in [[Haiti]]]]
{{Main|Education and technology}}

Technology plays an increasingly significant role in improving access to education for people living in impoverished areas and [[developing countries]]. Charities like [[One Laptop per Child]] are dedicated to providing infrastructures through which the disadvantaged may access educational materials.

The [[One Laptop per Child|OLPC foundation]], a group out of [[MIT Media Lab]] and supported by several major corporations, has a stated mission to develop a [[$100 laptop]] for delivering [[educational software]]. The laptops were widely available as of 2008. They are sold at cost or given away based on donations.

In Africa, the [[New Partnership for Africa's Development]] (NEPAD) has launched an "[[New Partnership for Africa's Development E-School Program|e-school program]]" to provide all 600,000 primary and high schools with computer equipment, learning materials and [[internet access]] within 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/news/network-wifi/3361705/african-nations-embrace-e-learning-says-new-report/ |title=African nations embrace e-learning, says new report |publisher=PC Advisor |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; An International Development Agency project called nabuur.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nabuur.com/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021011082942/http://www.nabuur.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2002-10-11 |title=nabuur.com |publisher=nabuur.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; started with the support of former American President [[Bill Clinton]], uses the [[Internet]] to allow co-operation by individuals on issues of social development.

[[India]] is developing technologies that will bypass land-based [[telephone]] and Internet infrastructure to deliver [[distance learning]] directly to its students. In 2004, the [[Indian Space Research Organisation]] launched [[GSAT-3|EDUSAT]], a communications satellite providing access to educational materials that can reach more of the country's population at a greatly reduced cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isro.org/satellites/edusat.aspx |title=EDUSAT |publisher=[[ISRO]] |accessdate=2013-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121227162328/http://isro.org/satellites/edusat.aspx |archivedate=27 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private vs public funding in developing countries===
Research into LCPS (low-cost private schools) found that over 5 years to July 2013, debate around LCPSs to achieving [[Education for All]] (EFA) objectives was polarized and finding growing coverage in international policy.&lt;ref name=report&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eldis.org/go/display&amp;type=Document&amp;id=65993|title=Low-cost private schools: evidence, approaches and emerging issues|publisher=Eldis|accessdate=10 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polarization was due to disputes around whether the schools are affordable for the poor, reach disadvantaged groups, provide quality education, support or undermine equality, and are financially sustainable.
The report examined the main challenges encountered by development organizations which support LCPSs.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Surveys suggest these types of schools are expanding across Africa and Asia. This success is attributed to excess demand. These surveys found concern for:
* Equity: This concern is widely found in the literature, suggesting the growth in low-cost private schooling may be exacerbating or perpetuating already existing inequalities in developing countries, between urban and rural populations, lower- and higher-income families, and between girls and boys. The report findings suggest that girls may be underrepresented and that LCPS are reaching low-income families in smaller numbers than higher-income families.
* Quality and educational outcomes: It is difficult to generalize about the quality of private schools. While most achieve better results than government counterparts, even after their social background is taken into account, some studies find the opposite. Quality in terms of levels of teacher absence, teaching activity, and pupil to teacher ratios in some countries are better in LCPSs than in government schools.
* Choice and affordability for the poor: Parents can choose private schools because of perceptions of better-quality teaching and facilities, and an English language instruction preference. Nevertheless, the concept of 'choice' does not apply in all contexts, or to all groups in society, partly because of limited affordability (which excludes most of the poorest) and other forms of exclusion, related to caste or social status.
* Cost-effectiveness and financial sustainability: There is evidence that private schools operate at low cost by keeping teacher salaries low, and their financial situation may be precarious where they are reliant on fees from low-income households.

The report showed some cases of successful voucher and subsidy programs; evaluations of international support to the sector are not widespread.&lt;ref name=report/&gt; Addressing regulatory ineffectiveness is a key challenge. Emerging approaches stress the importance of understanding the political economy of the market for LCPS, specifically how relationships of power and accountability between users, government, and private providers can produce better education outcomes for the poor.

{{main|Educational theory}}

===Educational psychology===
{{Main|Educational psychology}}
[[Educational psychology]] is the study of how humans learn in educational settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the [[social psychology]] of [[school]]s as [[organization]]s. Although the terms "educational psychology" and "school psychology" are often used interchangeably, researchers and theorists are likely to be identified as [[:Category:Educational psychologists|educational psychologists]], whereas practitioners in schools or school-related settings are identified as [[school psychologist]]s. Educational psychology is concerned with the processes of educational attainment in the general population and in sub-populations such as [[gifted]] children and those with specific [[disabilities]].
[[File:2013. Донецк 336.jpg|thumb|Knowledge Day in [[Donetsk]], [[Ukraine]], 2013]]
Educational psychology can in part be understood through its relationship with other disciplines. It is informed primarily by [[psychology]], bearing a relationship to that discipline analogous to the relationship between [[medicine]] and [[biology]]. Educational psychology, in turn, informs a wide range of specialties within educational studies, including [[instructional design]], [[educational technology]], curriculum development, [[organizational learning]], [[special education]] and [[classroom management]]. Educational psychology both draws from and contributes to [[cognitive science]] and the [[learning sciences]]. In universities, departments of educational psychology are usually housed within faculties of education, possibly accounting for the lack of representation of educational psychology content in introductory psychology textbooks (Lucas, Blazek, &amp; Raley, 2006).

===The intelligence–education relationship===
{{Main|Psychology of education}}
[[Intelligence]] is an important factor in how the individual responds to education. Those who have higher intelligence tend to perform better at school and go on to higher levels of education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Butler | first1 = S. | last2 = Marsh | first2 = H. | last3 = Sheppard | first3 = J. | year = 1985 | title = Seven year longitudinal study of the early prediction of reading achievement | url = | journal = Journal of Educational Psychology | volume = 77 | issue = 3| pages = 349–61 | doi=10.1037/0022-0663.77.3.349}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is also observable in the opposite direction, in that education increases measurable intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baltes | first1 = P. | last2 = Reinert | first2 = G. | year = 1969 | title = Cohort effects in cognitive development in children as revealed by cross sectional sequences | url = | journal = Developmental Psychology | volume = 1 | issue = 2| pages = 169–77 | doi=10.1037/h0026997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that while educational attainment is important in predicting intelligence in later life, intelligence at 53 is more closely correlated to intelligence at 8 years old than to educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Richards | first1 = M. | last2 = Sacker | first2 = A. | year = 2003 | title = Lifetime Antecedents of Cognitive Reserve | url = | journal = Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology | volume = 25 | issue = 5| pages = 614–24 | doi=10.1076/jcen.25.5.614.14581| pmid = 12815499 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning modalities===
There has been much interest in learning modalities and styles over the last two decades. The most commonly employed learning modalities are:&lt;ref&gt;Swassing, R. H., Barbe, W. B., &amp; Milone, M. N. (1979). ''The Swassing-Barbe Modality Index: Zaner-Bloser Modality Kit''. Columbus, OH: Zaner-Bloser.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Visual]]: learning based on observation and seeing what is being learned.
* [[Hearing (sense)|Auditory]]: learning based on listening to instructions/information.
* [[Kinesthetic]]: learning based on movement, e.g. hands-on work and engaging in activities.

Other commonly employed modalities include [[music]]al, [[interpersonal]], [[Verbal reasoning|verbal]], [[logical]], and [[intrapersonal]].

Dunn and Dunn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningstyles.net/ |title=Dunn and Dunn |publisher=Learningstyles.net | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on identifying relevant stimuli that may influence learning and manipulating the school environment, at about the same time as [[Joseph Renzulli]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~intell/renzulli.shtml |title=Biographer of Renzulli |publisher=Indiana.edu | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended varying teaching strategies. [[Howard Gardner]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thomasarmstrong.com/multiple_intelligences.htm Thomas Armstrong's website] detailing Multiple Intelligences&lt;/ref&gt; identified a wide range of modalities in his [[Multiple Intelligences]] theories. The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]] and [[Keirsey Temperament Sorter]], based on the works of [[Jung]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keirsey.com/ |title=Keirsey web-site |publisher=Keirsey.com | accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; focus on understanding how people's personality affects the way they interact personally, and how this affects the way individuals respond to each other within the learning environment. The work of [[David Kolb]] and [[Anthony Gregorc]]'s Type Delineator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |title=Type Delineator description |publisher=Algonquincollege.com |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301064219/http://algonquincollege.com/edtech/gened/styles.html |archivedate=1 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; follows a similar but more simplified approach.

Some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities, while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Barbe, W. B., &amp; Swassing, R. H., with M. N. Milone. (1979). ''Teaching through modality strengths: Concepts and practices''.

===Mind, Brain and Education===

Several academic institutions around the world are beginning to devote resources to the establishment of educational neuroscience research.

===Philosophy===
[[File:LockeEducation1693.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[John Locke]]'s work ''[[Some Thoughts Concerning Education]]'' was written in 1693 and still reflects traditional education priorities in the Western world.]]
{{Main|Philosophy of education}}
As an academic field, philosophy of education is "the philosophical study of education and its problems&amp;nbsp;(...) its central subject matter is education, and its methods are those of [[philosophy]]".&lt;ref name=NoddingsPOE&gt;{{Cite book | last = Noddings| first = Nel| title = Philosophy of Education| publisher = Westview Press| year = 1995| location = Boulder, CO| isbn = 978-0-8133-8429-0|page=1|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The philosophy of education may be either the philosophy of the process of education or the philosophy of the discipline of education. That is, it may be part of the discipline in the sense of being concerned with the aims, forms, methods, or results of the process of educating or being educated; or it may be metadisciplinary in the sense of being concerned with the concepts, aims, and methods of the discipline."&lt;ref name=POEE&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Frankena | first1 = William K. | last2 = Raybeck | first2 = Nathan | last3 = Burbules | first3 = Nicholas | contribution = Philosophy of Education | year = 2002 | title = Encyclopedia of Education, 2nd edition | editor-last = Guthrie | editor-first = James W. | place = New York, NY | publisher = Macmillan Reference | isbn= 978-0-02-865594-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it is both part of the field of education and a field of [[applied philosophy]], drawing from fields of [[metaphysics]], [[epistemology]], [[axiology]] and the philosophical approaches ([[speculative philosophy|speculative]], prescriptive or [[Analytic philosophy|analytic]]) to address questions in and about [[pedagogy]], [[education policy]], and [[curriculum]], as well as the process of [[learning theory (education)|learning]], to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Noddings|1995|pages=1–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it might study what constitutes upbringing and education, the values and norms revealed through upbringing and educational practices, the limits and legitimization of education as an academic discipline, and the relation between [[education theory]] and practice.

===Purpose of education===
There is no broad consensus as to what education's chief aim or aims are or should be. Some authors stress its value to the individual, emphasizing its potential for positively influencing students' personal development, promoting autonomy, forming a cultural identity or establishing a career or occupation. Other authors emphasize education's contributions to societal purposes, including good citizenship, shaping students into productive members of society, thereby promoting society's general economic development, and preserving cultural values.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Winch and John Gingell, ''Philosophy of Education: The Key Concepts'' (2nd edition). London:Routledge, 2008. pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curriculum===
{{Main|Curriculum|Curriculum theory|List of academic disciplines}}
In formal education, a [[curriculum]] is the set of courses and their content offered at a [[school]] or [[university]]. As an idea, '''curriculum''' stems from the [[Latin]] word for ''[[race course]]'', referring to the course of [[wikt:deed|deeds]] and experiences through which [[child]]ren grow to become mature [[adult]]s. A curriculum is prescriptive and is based on a more general [[syllabus]] which merely specifies what topics must be understood and to what level to achieve a particular grade or standard.

An [[List of academic disciplines|academic discipline]] is a branch of knowledge which is formally taught, either at the university – or via some other such method. Each discipline usually has several sub-disciplines or branches, and distinguishing lines are often both arbitrary and ambiguous. Examples of broad areas of academic disciplines include the [[natural science]]s, [[mathematics]], [[computer science]], [[social science]]s, [[humanities]] and [[applied science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/Default.htm |title=Examples of subjects |publisher=Curriculumonline.gov.uk |accessdate=2009-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080821105825/http://www.curriculumonline.gov.uk/default.htm |archivedate=21 August 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educational institutions may incorporate [[fine arts]] as part of K-12 grade curricula or within majors at [[college]]s and universities as electives.  The various types of fine arts are music, dance, and theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.educationworld.com/standards/national/arts/index.shtml |title=Fine Arts |publisher=Education World |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2013-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sudbury Valley School]] offers a model of education without a curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gray |first=Scott |date=2011 |title=Sherlock Holmes was Wrong. |journal=The Sudbury Valley School Journal |volume=40 |issue=2 |url=https://sudburyvalley.org/essays/sherlock-holmes-was-wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Instruction===
Instruction is the facilitation of another's learning. Instructors in primary and secondary institutions are often called [[teacher]]s, and they direct the education of [[student]]s and might draw on many [[course (education)|subjects]] like [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], [[mathematics]], [[science]] and [[history]]. Instructors in post-secondary institutions might be called [[teacher]]s, instructors, or [[professor]]s, depending on the type of institution; and they primarily teach only their specific discipline. Studies from the United States suggest that the quality of teachers is the single most important factor affecting student performance, and that countries which score highly on international tests have multiple policies in place to ensure that the teachers they employ are as effective as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Winters |first=Marcus |title=Teachers Matter: Rethinking How Public Schools Identify, Reward, and Retain Great Educators |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |page=160 |isbn=978-1-4422-1077-6|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WRS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf |title=How the world's best-performing school systems come out on top |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927092821/http://www.mckinsey.com/App_Media/Reports/SSO/Worlds_School_Systems_Final.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2011 |website=mckinsey.com |date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the passing of NCLB in the United States (No Child Left Behind), teachers must be highly qualified. A popular way to gauge teaching performance is to use student evaluations of teachers (SETS), but these evaluations have been criticized for being counterproductive to learning and inaccurate due to student bias.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 |title=Natural Learning in Higher Education |author=J.

College basketball coach [[John Wooden]] the Wizard of Westwood would teach through quick "This not That" technique. He would show (a) the correct way to perform an action, (b) the incorrect way the player performed it, and again (c) the correct way to perform an action. This helped him to be a responsive teacher and fix errors on the fly. Also, less communication from him meant more time that the player could practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coyle |first1=Daniel |title=The Talent Code |publisher=Bantam Books |isbn=978-0-553-80684-7 |page=159|year=2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics of education==
{{Main|Economics of education}}
[[File:Students, Hakha, Chin State, Myanmar.jpg|thumb|right|Students on their way to school, [[Hakha]], [[Chin State]], [[Burma|Myanmar]]]]
It has been argued that high rates of education are essential for countries to be able to achieve high levels of [[economic growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Eric A. Hanushek|title=Economic outcomes and school quality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=na7rAAAACAAJ|accessdate=21 October 2011|year=2005|publisher=International Institute for Educational Planning|isbn=978-92-803-1279-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Empirical analyses tend to support the theoretical prediction that poor countries should grow faster than rich countries because they can adopt cutting edge technologies already tried and tested by rich countries. However, [[technology transfer]] requires knowledgeable managers and engineers who are able to operate new machines or production practices borrowed from the leader in order to close the gap through imitation. Therefore, a country's ability to learn from the leader is a function of its stock of "[[human capital]]". Recent study of the determinants of aggregate economic growth have stressed the importance of fundamental economic institutions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Daron Acemoglu |author2=Simon Johnson |author3=James A.

At the level of the individual, there is a large literature, generally related to the work of [[Jacob Mincer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jacob Mincer|title=The distribution of labor incomes: a survey with special reference to the human capital approach|jstor=2720384|journal=Journal of Economic Literature|volume= 8|issue=1|year=1970|pages=1–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; on how earnings are related to the schooling and other human capital. This work has motivated a large number of studies, but is also controversial. The chief controversies revolve around how to interpret the impact of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;David Card, "Causal effect of education on earnings," in ''Handbook of labor economics'', Orley Ashenfelter and David Card (Eds). Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1999: pp. 1801–63&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James J. Heckman, Lance J. Lochner, and Petra E.

Amsterdam: North Holland, 2006: pp. 307–458.&lt;/ref&gt; Some students who have indicated a high potential for learning, by testing with a high [[intelligence quotient]], may not achieve their full academic potential, due to financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://som.yale.edu/news/2009/11/why-high-iq-doesnt-mean-youre-smart|title=Why a high IQ doesn't mean you're smart|date=2009-11-01|work=Yale School of Management|access-date=2018-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists [[Samuel Bowles (economist)|Samuel Bowles]] and Herbert Gintis argued in 1976 that there was a fundamental conflict in American schooling between the [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] goal of democratic participation and the inequalities implied by the continued profitability of capitalist production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author1=Samuel Bowles|author2=Herbert Gintis|title=Schooling In Capitalist America: Educational Reform and the Contradictions of Economic Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LcpLPKOL6XYC|accessdate=21 October 2011|date=18 October 2011|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=978-1-60846-131-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future of education==

Many countries are now drastically changing the way they educate their citizens. The world is changing at an ever quickening rate, which means that a lot of knowledge becomes obsolete and inaccurate more quickly. The emphasis is therefore shifting to teaching the skills of learning: to picking up new knowledge quickly and in as agile a way as possible. Finnish schools have even begun to move away from the regular subject-focused curricula, introducing instead developments like phenomenon-based learning, where students study concepts like climate change instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oph.fi/english/curricula_and_qualifications/basic_education/curricula_2014|title=Finnish National Agency for Education - Curricula 2014|website=www.oph.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Education is also becoming a commodity no longer reserved for children. Adults need it too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitra.fi/en/articles/for-many-people-flexibility-at-work-can-be-a-liberation-matthew-taylor-chief-executive-royal-society-of-arts/|title=For many people, flexibility at work can be a liberation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some governmental bodies, like the Finnish Innovation Fund Sitra in Finland, have even proposed compulsory lifelong education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sitra.fi/en/articles/compulsory-education-last-lifetime/|title=Could compulsory education last a lifetime? - Sitra|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Financial disclosure of public servants''' (asset declaration) is a disclosure of financial information by [[public servant]]s. It is a requirement of the [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]] (UNCAC).

== History ==

Not counting [[U.S. state|states in the USA]], the first [[country]] which made declarations available to public was [[United Kingdom]] in 1974,&lt;ref name="oecd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/corruption/anti-bribery/47489446.pdf|title=Asset Declarations for Public Officials. A TOOL TO PREVENT CORRUPTION (English). 2011. с. 22.|publisher=[[OECD]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[House of Commons]] introduced the [[Register of Members' Financial Interests]]. Following the [[Watergate scandal]] financial disclosure of public officials was made a requirement in the [[United States]] by its [[Ethics in Government Act]] of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43186.pdf|title=Financial Disclosure by Federal Officials and Publication of Disclosure Reports|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|accessdate=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980-th most of European countries disclosed public assets declarations.

The '''Fletcher Foundation''' is a nonprofit foundation that supports [[civil rights]], [[education]], and [[environmental education]].  The foundation supports efforts to develop a more just society with more equal opportunities for more of the population primarily by leveraging the financial and non-financial contributions of Fletcher Asset Management, the Fletcher Family including New York financier and philanthropist [[Buddy Fletcher|Alphonse Fletcher, Jr.]],&lt;ref&gt;http://fletcherphilanthropy.org&lt;/ref&gt; and others. Fletcher Asset Management has been accused of fraud related to its management of funds and the value of pledges Fletcher's charitable pledges are in dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theday.com/article/20131215/NWS01/312159915/Waterford-success-story-Buddy-Fletcher-accused-of-fraud Waterford success story Buddy Fletcher accused of fraud] 12/15/2014 The Day&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1987 graduate of [[Harvard University]], Fletcher worked in investment banking and in 1991 founded Fletcher Asset Management. A Harvard Class Marshal, Fletcher endowed a University Professorship at his alma mater, first held by philosopher [[Cornel West]] and now held by literary critic [[Henry Louis Gates, Jr]]. In 2004, in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the landmark Supreme Court decision, [[Brown v. Board of Education]], the Fletcher Foundation announced the creation of the Alphonse Fletcher, Sr. Fellowship program, described by foundation chair Henry Louis Gates, Jr. as "Guggenheims for race issues."&lt;ref&gt;[http://thealgebraproject.org/a_fletcher_fellowship_awarded_to_bob_moses Fletcher Fellowship Awarded to Bob Moses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113224256/http://thealgebraproject.org/a_fletcher_fellowship_awarded_to_bob_moses |date=2007-11-13 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural class of Fletcher Fellows, each awarded $50,000, was selected in 2006.

The '''Forest History Society''' is an [[United States|American]] non-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of forest and conservation history.&lt;ref name=FHS&gt;"Forest History Society." Echo Project. Center for History and New Media, George Mason University. http://echo.gmu.edu/node/144&lt;/ref&gt; The society was established in 1946 and incorporated in 1955.&lt;ref name=FHS/&gt;

The Forest History Society headquarters in [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]], [[North Carolina]], include the Alvin J. Huss Archives and the [[Carl A. Weyerhaeuser]] Library, which combine to provide a comprehensive compilation of materials related to the topic of forest history. The archives house large collections from several national organizations and companies such as the [[Society of American Foresters]], the [[American Forest and Paper Association]], the [[American Forests|American Forestry Association]], the [[Tree farm#American Tree Farm System|American Tree Farm System]], and the [[Weyerhaeuser|Weyerhaeuser Company]] as well as many other smaller collections of national and international significance.&lt;ref&gt;"Changing Roles of the Forest History Society: New Approaches to Environmental History in North America." ''Methods and Approaches in Forest History''. Agnoletti, Mauro, et al., eds. Wallingford, England: CABI Publishing, 2000, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, the Forest History Society maintains a publication program, publishing the ''Environmental History'' journal, ''Forest History Today'' magazine, an Issues Series, and environmental and conservation-focused monographs; an education program, to build understanding and appreciation of human interaction with the natural world; and a liaison function between scholars, policymakers, and landowners. The Society also works to promote and reward academic scholarship in the fields of forest, conservation, and environmental history.

==History==
In 1946, a small group of historians and forest industry executives came together to form an organization dedicated to preserving the documentary forest heritage of North America. The "Forest Products History Foundation" was founded, and began as a program of the [[Minnesota Historical Society]].

Over the following decade, archival source materials were collected, an oral history interview program was created, and a scholarly quarterly journal began publication. In 1955, under second executive director Elwood Rondeau "Woody" Maunder, the Society incorporated as an independent nonprofit organization under the new name "Forest History Foundation." The name was changed to "Forest History Society" four years later in 1959.

The organization left Minnesota in 1964, moving first to the [[Yale University]] campus in 1964, and then to the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]] in 1969. In 1984 the Society was moved to its current home in Durham, North Carolina, establishing an affiliation with [[Duke University]] and the [[Nicholas School of the Environment and Earth Sciences|Nicholas School of the Environment]].

In 1996, a partnership was formed between the Forest History Society and the [[American Society for Environmental History]]. This relationship helped widen the scope of the Society's mission beyond the boundaries of forest and conservation history to include subjects related to the broader field of environmental history.

==Publications==
The Forest History Society publishes a magazine, ''Forest History Today'', and co-publishes the ''Environmental History'' journal with the [[American Society for Environmental History]]. A regular Issues Series is also published by the Society on environmental topics of contemporary interest such as fire, wetlands, and forests. Featured books representing important scholarship in the fields of forest, conservation, and environmental history are also published. The Society provides further financial, editorial, and research assistance to other authors publishing books in the subject area of environmental history.

The landscape immersion term and approach were developed in 1975 through the efforts of David Hancocks at [[Seattle]]'s [[Woodland Park Zoo]].&lt;ref name=schaul&gt;{{citation |last=Schaul |first=Jordan Carlton |title=A Critical Look at the Future of Zoos–An Interview with David Hancocks | newspaper=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] |date=2012-03-13|url=http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2012/03/13/39842/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to the zoo's ground-breaking [[gorilla]] exhibit, which opened in 1978.&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web  | title=Inside Out Cage|url=http://www.radiolab.org/2007/jun/04/inside-out-cage/| accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=zooEvolution&gt;{{cite web | last = Coe | first = Jon Charles | last2 = Lee|first2= Gary | title=One-Hundred Years of Evolution in Great Ape Facilities in American Zoos: 1896 - 1996|url=http://www.joncoedesign.com/pub/PDFs/OneHundredYears1996.pdf| year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept became the industry standard by the 1980s, and has since gained widespread acceptance as the best practice for zoological exhibits.&lt;ref name=exhibitTrends&gt;{{cite web | title=Immersion Design|url=http://www.joncoedesign.com/trends/exhibit_trends.htm#immersion| accessdate=2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J_M_Leigh.jpg|thumb|Portrait by [[Henry Stacy Marks]]]]
'''James Mathews Leigh''' (1808 &amp;ndash; 20 April 1860) was an English art educator, painter, writer, [[dramatist]] and critic. He is best known as the founder of a popular private art school in London known as "Leigh's Academy", which eventually became the present day [[Heatherley School of Fine Art]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heatherleys.org/history.html History of Heatherley's] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909010425/http://www.heatherleys.org/history.html |date=9 September 2010 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Leigh, James Mathews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

Leigh was born in London in 1808, the son of [[Samuel Leigh (bookseller)|Samuel Leigh]],&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vY1CAAAAcAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Obituary of J. L. Leigh] (The Art Journal, London, 1 July 1860) p200.&lt;/ref&gt; a well-known bookseller who ran a shop at 18 [[Strand, London|The Strand]], near the [[Adelphi Theatre]] London - [[William Blake]] was apparently a frequent visitor.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Eades Bentley. ''The Blake records'' (Clarendon P., 1969) p264.&lt;/ref&gt;  James's uncle was the popular actor and theatre manager [[Charles Mathews]] ("the elder"). He studied art under [[William Etty]],&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Robinson. ''William Etty: the life and art'' (McFarland, 2007) p144.&lt;/ref&gt; deciding to make [[historical painting]] his speciality. He first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1830 with two paintings, ''Joseph presenting his Brethren to Pharaoh'' and ''Jephthah's vow''.

Soon afterwards, he went on a tour of the continent, visiting galleries in France, Germany and Italy to study the works of the [[Old Masters]] and make sketches.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; Around this time also he devoted himself to writing, and, in 1838, privately published ''Cromwell'' an historical play in five acts,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=hJIVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22James+Mathews+Leigh%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1vqJTI7iB9WB4Qb078WtCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cromwell: An historical play in five acts] (London: Leigh &amp; Son, 1838).&lt;/ref&gt; and later ''The Rhenish Album''. He then travelled to Spain where he made further sketches,&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; resuming, on his return to England, work as a painter, and continuing to send paintings of sacred subjects and portraits to the Royal Academy and other exhibitions up to 1849.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

However, Leigh is now better known as a teacher of drawing than as an artist. In 1848, he founded an academy of art, "Leigh's Academy", at 79 Newman Street,&lt;ref&gt;Stuart MacDonald. ''The history and philosophy of art education'' (James Clarke &amp; Co., 2004) p73.&lt;/ref&gt; off [[Oxford Street]] in London. It was well attended and became a formidable rival to the other main London art academy run by [[Henry Sass]] ("Sass's Academy").&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt; He was said to be "a first rate teacher and a profound critic in matters of art". Many distinguished artists received their early training at Leigh's academy including Sir [[Frederic Leighton]], Sir [[John Millais]], [[Philip Hermogenes Calderon]], [[Henry Stacy Marks]], [[Edward Poynter]], [[Joseph Boehm]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/joseph-boehm Joseph Boehm] (Answers.com).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edwin Long]], [[Henry Holiday]], [[Frederick Walker (painter)|Frederick Walker]], [[John Bagnold Burgess]], [[Walter Goodman]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Biograph and Review Volume IV For the Second Six Months of 1880'' [1880], E.W.Allen&lt;/ref&gt; and others.&lt;ref&gt;Tinsley, 1900, pp. 193-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last twenty years, Leigh exhibited no work at any of the recognised exhibitions, instead showing it on the walls of his art academy. He was also in the habit of sketching the same subjects - often of themes from  literature - as his students in their drawing classes.&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

Leigh had been a heavy pipe smoker throughout his life and developed cancer of the throat.&lt;ref&gt;Tinsley, 1900, p195.&lt;/ref&gt; He died shortly afterwards in London on 20 April 1860. His son, [[Henry Sambrooke Leigh]] (1837–1883) was a writer and dramatist. After his death, the running of Leigh's art school was taken over by Thomas Heatherley and the school renamed (as was the fashion) "[[Heatherley School of Fine Art|Heatherley's Art School]]".&lt;ref name="dnb" /&gt;

'''Joel S. Demski''' (born 1940) is an American accounting researcher and educator, and Frederick E. Fisher Eminent Scholar at [[University of Florida]], inducted to the [[Accounting Hall of Fame]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clio.lib.olemiss.edu/u?/aah,282 Antle, Rick. "Demski, Joel S. (1940-).]" In ''History of Accounting: An International Encyclopedia,'' edited by [[Michael Chatfield]] and [[Richard Vangermeersch]]. New York: Garland Publishing, 1996. Pp. 196-197.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life and work ==
Born in [[Sturgis, Michigan]] to George and Athalia Demski, Demski moved with his family to [[Pinconning, Michigan]], where he grew up and his father had his own [[machine shop]]. He received a BSE in industrial engineering in 1962 from the [[University of Michigan]], and MBA degree with high distinction in 1963. In this MBA program he encountered [[William A. Paton]] and took courses from [[Stephen A. Zeff]] and [[Samuel R. Hepworth]]. In 1967 he obtained his PhD from the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name="CTH 2000"&gt;[[Charles T. Horngren]]. "[http://www.accountingin.com/accounting-historians-journal/volume-28-number-1/joel-s-demski/ Joel S. Demski : Accounting Hall of Fame 2000 Induction]," in: ''Accounting Historians Journal.'' Vol. 28, Nr. 1 (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation Demski started his academic career in 1967 at the [[Columbia University]]. The next year in 1968 he moved to [[Stanford University]], where he was appointed Professor of Accountancy. In 1985 he was appointed Professor of Information and Accounting Systems at the [[Yale University]], and in 1994 Scholar in Accounting at the University of Florida.&lt;ref name="CTH 2000"/&gt; Demski is a past president of the [[American Accounting Association]].

In 1986 Demski received the Outstanding Accounting Educator Award of the American Accounting Association in 1986. And in 1994, along with co-author Gerald A. Feltham, he was awarded the Seminal Contributions in Accounting Literature Award for their article "Economic Incentives in Budgetary Control Systems" published in ''The Accounting Review'' in April, 1978.

== Reception ==
In 2000, Demski was one of three inductees to the [[Accounting Hall of Fame]], a program hosted by Ohio State University which honors top academics and practitioners nation- and world-wide. An excerpt from the Hall of Fame biography comments on his research contributions:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
His pathbreaking work on applications of [[information economics]] and [[agency theory]] to accounting is presented in 60 published journal articles, 5 books, and over 25 other published papers. His work and that of the countless students he inspired has created a new domain for accounting theory. He is one of the most widely cited authors in the accounting literature and many of his papers have been awarded national prizes for their importance and influence. One of his first papers, "An Accounting System Structured on a Linear Programming Model," won the 1967 AICPA Award for Outstanding Contributions to the Accounting Literature and 3 years later, another paper, "The Use of Models in Information Evaluation" (written with his former colleague Gerald Feltham), captured the same award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.osu.edu/departments/accounting-and-mis/the-accounting-hall-of-fame/membership-in-hall/joel-stanley-demski/ Biography at OSU's Accounting Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This is a '''list of museums'''. A [[museum]] is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and makes them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary.

According to ''Museums of the World'', there are about 55,000 museums in 202 countries.&lt;ref name="Amazon"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Ruth |last1=Lochar |first2=Alexandra |last2=Meinhold |first3=Hildegard |last3=Toma |url=https://www.amazon.com/Museums-World-De-Gruyter-Saur/dp/3110234858#ps-content |title=Museums of the World |location=München |publisher=[[Walter de Gruyter|De Gruyter Saur]] |isbn=9783110234855 |oclc=747007027 |edition=18th |date=May 17, 2011 |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Council of Museums]] comprises 30,000 members in 137 countries.

'''Marian Small''' (born 1948)&lt;ref&gt;Birth year from [http://www.isni.org/isni/000000012018954X ISNI authority control file], retrieved 2018-12-02.&lt;/ref&gt; is a Canadian educational researcher, academic, author, and public speaker.  She has co-authored mathematics textbooks used in Canada, Austria, and the United States, and is a proponent of a [[constructivist teaching methods|constructivist]] approach to mathematical instruction within [[K–12 (education)|K–12]] classrooms.&lt;ref name="Small-1"&gt;{{cite web | title = Marian Small – 2004 President's Medal Recipient | publisher = University of New Brunswick | date = March 26, 2004 | url = https://www.unb.ca/hr/_resources/awardrecipients/mariansmall.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Dr Marian Small Explains the Importance of Thinking About Math | publisher = 3P Learning | url = http://www.3plearning.com/dr-marian-small-explains-importance-thinking-math/ | accessdate = September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Small began teaching at the [[University of New Brunswick|University of New Brunswick's]] Faculty of Education in 1973.  Within that faculty she served as department chair, acting associate dean, acting dean, dean, and acting vice-president.&lt;ref name="Small-1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Marian Small | publisher = University of New Brunswick | date = May 16, 2007 | url = https://www.unb.ca/faculty/emeritus/honorees/fredericton/qtou/small.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small served two terms on New Brunswick's [[School District 18]].&lt;ref name="Small-1"/&gt;

==Approach to mathematics instruction==
Small advocates a "constructivism" approach to mathematics instruction, which encourages students to construct explanations to math problems.&lt;ref name="Small-1"/&gt;  "There is a strongly held belief in the mathematics education community", wrote Small, "that mathematics is best learned when students are actively engaged in constructing their own understandings.  This is only likely to happen in classrooms that emphasize rich problem solving and the exchange of many approaches to mathematical situations, and that give attention to and value students’ mathematical reasoning".&lt;ref name="small-2"&gt;{{cite web | last = Small | first = Marian | title = How Students Learn Math and What Math We Want Them to Learn | publisher = Cengage Learning | date = 2012 | url = http://www.nelsonbrain.com/content/9780176643461.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To demonstrate this approach, Small provides an example of students learning to add 47 and 38.  A traditional approach to math instruction would show students how to add these two numbers by "grouping the ones, trading, and then grouping the tens".  Small explains that in a constructivist classroom, "the teacher might provide students with a variety of counting materials and pose a problem such as, "one bus has 47 students in it; another has 38. How many students are on both buses?" and allow students to use their own strategies to solve the problem".  This would be followed by a classroom discussion where the various approaches used by students were shared and additional ideas were added.&lt;ref name="small-2"/&gt;

Small's approach is enhanced by skillful questioning by the classroom teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Asking Effective Questions | publisher = Ontario Ministry of Education | date = July 2011 | url = http://www.edu.gov.on.ca/eng/literacynumeracy/inspire/research/cbs_askingeffectivequestions.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Small's style of math instruction has been described as a "random abstract approach" by those favouring more traditional skills-based pedagogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Zwaagstra | first = Michael | title = How to Make Math Education Worse in N.S. | publisher = Chronicle Herald | date = October 3, 2012 | url = http://thechronicleherald.ca/opinion/142943-how-to-make-math-education-worse-in-ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Toronto's ''Globe and Mail'' stated: "in the latest&amp;mdash;arguably fiercest&amp;mdash;of the "math wars" to break out in Canada, she would be Public Enemy No. 1 for those who think kids are fast losing their number sense because of the "fuzzy-math, basic-skills-lite" teaching Dr. Small and many of her contemporaries promote".&lt;ref name="Anderssen"&gt;{{cite web | last = Anderssen | first = Erin | title = Why the War Over Math is Distracting and Futile | publisher = Globe and Mail | date =  March 1, 2014 | url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/why-the-war-over-math-is-distracting-and-futile/article17178295/?page=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding her role in the [[math wars]], Small has acknowledged the "concern about less emphasis on memorizing the facts and allowing calculator use" as well as the "very loud and impassioned debate on these matters".  Regarding the different approaches along the continuum of math instruction, Small stated "neither is better&amp;mdash;they are different. In fact, the more tools and approaches that we have, the more likely we are to be successful at a task".&lt;ref name="small-2"/&gt;

'''Max Doerner'''(1870–1939) was a German artist and art theorist.

Doerner's artistic education was at the Academy of Fine Arts (Munich) where he studies under [[Johann Caspar Herterich]] and [[Wilhelm von Diez]]. His style was basically ''impressionistic''. He travelled around Europe, in particular to the Low Countries and Italy and studied the old techniques of painting. He is most noted for his work ''The Materials of the Artist and Their Use in Painting'' first published in 1921 and now running to many editions.&lt;ref&gt;Max Doerner/Thomas Hoppe, Malmaterial und seine Verwendung im Bilde, Stuttgart 2006, {{ISBN|3-332-01830-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Allgemeines Künstlerlexikon. Saur Verlag, 2001, Bd. 28, S. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

His approach inspired the founding of the [[Doerner Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Philip (2001) Bright Earth: The Invention of Colour, Vintage&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "di"&gt;http://www.doernerinstitut.de/en/geschichte/geschichte_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also an instructor at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich]], where his students included [[Karl Gatermann the Younger]].

The '''''Morgenster''''' (''Morning Star'' in [[Dutch (language)|Dutch]]) is a [[sail training ship]] based in the [[Netherlands]]. She was built, as a [[lugger|herring lugger]] under the name '''''De Vrouw Maria''''', in 1919. In 1927, she was lengthened by {{convert|7|m}} and converted into a [[fishing vessel|motor fishing vessel]]. She was renamed ''Morgenster'' in 1959 and continued to be used as a fishing vessel until 1970. After a period of use for [[sport fishing]] and in the [[pirate radio]] business, she was acquired by her current owners for conversion back to a sailing vessel in 1983. She made her maiden voyage as a sail training ship in 2008, having been refitted as a [[brig]].&lt;ref name=fal&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.falmouthtallships.co.uk/ship/morgenster/ | title = Morgenster | publisher = Falmouth Tall Ships Regatta 2014 | accessdate = 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spot&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shipspotting.com/gallery/photo.php?lid=2183720 | title = Morgenster - IMO 5241659 | work = shipspotting.com | accessdate = 25 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NASA Academy is [[NASA]]'s premiere leadership training program for undergraduate and graduate students. Since its founding in 1993, the NASA Academy has brought together future leaders of the aerospace industry and exposed them to the inner workings of NASA, academia, and industry. The Academy consists of a ten-week summer program hosted by a participating NASA center. Currently there are academies at [[Langley Research Center]], [[Ames Research Center]], [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] and [[Glenn Research Center]]. [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] and [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] previously hosted NASA Academies, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa-academy.org/org_academy_overview.html |title=NAAA - NASA Academy Program Overview |publisher=Nasa-academy.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The NASA Academy at was founded in 1993 at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center by [[Gerald Soffen|Gerald "Gerry" Soffen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa-academy.org/soffen/ |title=Dr. Gerald A. Soffen Memorial at NASA Academy Alumni Association |date= |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was largely based on the concept of the [[International Space University]]. Soffen envisioned the NASA Academy as a leadership program with an inter-disciplinary approach similar to ISU, but without the emphasis on the international and intercultural aspects. Specifically, Soffen created the program to "give possible 'leaders' a view into how NASA, the university community, and the private sector function; [to] set their priorities; and [to] contribute to the success of the aerospace program."&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title=NASA Academy at Ames for Space Exploration Mission Statement|publisher=NASA Academy|url=http://academy.arc.nasa.gov/index.php?fuseaction=home.mission|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The research focus for any specific NASA Academy can change from year to year. In 2015, the Multidisciplinary Aeronautics Research Team Initiative (MARTI) replaced the Aeronautics Academy.

The NASA Academy states its mission as follows: "to identify and recruit the future leaders of the space exploration community, to introduce them to the key aspects of the industry, to provide them with critical training, and to build an ever-expanding network of these future leaders, so that these young scientists and engineers are prepared to assume the highest responsibilities of a career dedicated to leadership in space exploration."&lt;ref&gt;

==Program Overview==
The 2010 NASA Academy Definitions Document outlines six key criteria that are critical to the program and which, when taken as a whole, differentiate it from other NASA leadership development programs:
# Principal Investigator-Directed Research, wherein the Research Associate devotes an average of 30 hours a week to a research project within a NASA science or advanced technology program.
# A Group Research Project requiring the collaborative efforts of all of the Research Associates as well as external advisors. Traditionally, this requires extensive work during evenings and weekends, and consumes several working days during normal business hours towards to end of the program.
# Structured and Unstructured Team Building activities, designed to form an effective and cohesive community from an interdisciplinary group of leaders.
# Interactions with current aerospace industry leaders, including both formal lectures and informal opportunities to interact at meals, launches, and other events.
# Site visits to a variety of NASA centers, companies, and university labs. Traditionally, this takes up approximately one working day during normal business hours as well as extensive work during evenings and weekends.
# A culture of extreme professionalism and preparation.

NASA Academy students are typically expected to work long hours: as a general rule, the day is scheduled from 07:30 to 21:00, after which students work on the Team Project or on individual research assignments. However, NASA Academy students are also typically given excellent opportunities, including field trips to other centers and excellent access to the leaders and decision-makers of the aerospace industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsgc.utexas.edu/nasa_academy/ |title=TSGC &amp;#124; NASA Academy |publisher=Tsgc.utexas.edu |date=2010-01-18 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A NASA Academy class typically varies from 10-20 students per center per year. Participants are selected in a joint effort between the NASA Center, the NASA Academy Alumni Association, the PIs, and the State [[National Space Grant College and Fellowship Program|Space Grant]] Consortia. Alumni from the previous year's program are typically selected to serve as program coordinators for current sessions. For several years in the early 2000s (decade), the NASA Academy at GSFC admitted a French student every year as part of a cooperative agreement with [[CNES|the Centre National d'Études Spatiales]], the French space agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaMI/Education/SEM8KVCJD3G_0.html |title=ESA - Education - Opportunity for European students to attend NASA Academy 2010 |publisher=Esa.int |date=2010-01-31 |accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable alumni==
{{Quote box
 |quote  = "After 14 years, among its alumni are over 50 members with doctorates, 45 employees of NASA centers, 65 NASA contractors, 70 other professionals in aerospace-related fields, 10 math, science and physics teachers, and three CEOs, with approximately 50% of the alumni currently having completed or completing advanced degrees. In addition, Academy alumni account for hundreds of scholarship awards, space agency awards, national awards, professional society awards, and university awards, including five NASA Harriett G. Jenkins Pre-Doctoral Fellows during the past five years -- with at least one in every cohort. Academy alumni are also responsible for hundreds of presentations, projects, publications and patents."

{{Reading}}
{{Education in the U.S.}}
The '''National Reading Panel''' ('''NRP''') was a United States government body.  Formed in 1997 at the request of Congress, it was a national panel with the stated aim of assessing the effectiveness of different approaches used to [[Reading (process)|teach children to read]].

The panel was created by Director of the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD) at the [[National Institutes of Health]], in consultation with the [[United States Secretary of Education]], and included prominent experts in the fields of [[reading education]], psychology, and higher education. The panel was chaired by [[Donald N. Langenberg|Donald Langenberg]] (University of Maryland), and included the following members: Gloria Correro (Mississippi State U.), Linnea Ehri (City University of New York), Gwenette Ferguson (middle school teacher, Houston, TX), Norma Garza (parent, Brownsville, TX), Michael L. Kamil (Stanford U.), [[Cora Bagley Marrett]] (U. Massachusetts-Amherst), S. J. Samuels (U. of Minnesota), Timothy Shahahan (U. of Illinois at Chicago), Sally Shaywitz (Yale U.), Thomas Trabasso (U. of Chicago), Joanna Williams (Columbia U.), Dale Willows (U. Of Toronto), [[Joanne Yatvin]] (school district superintendent, Boring, OR).

In April 2000, the panel issued its report, "Teaching Children to Read," and completed its work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/nrp/Documents/report.pdf|title=Complete report - National Reading Panel}} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705194256/http://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/nrp/findings.cfm|title=Findings and Determinations of the National Reading Panel by Topic Areas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report summarized research in eight areas relating to literacy instruction: [[phonemic awareness]] instruction, [[phonics]] instruction, fluency instruction, vocabulary instruction, text comprehension instruction, independent reading, [[E-learning|computer assisted instruction]], and teacher professional development. The final report was endorsed by all of the panel members except one. Joanne Yatvin wrote a minority report criticizing the work of the NRP because it (a) did not include teachers of early reading on the panel or as reviewers of the report and (b) only focused on a subset of important reading skills. Timothy Shanahan, another panel member, later responded that Dr. Yatvin had received permission to investigate areas of reading instruction that the panel could not address within the limited time provided for their work. Shanahan noted that she had not pursued additional areas of interest despite the willingness of the panel to allow her to do so.

In 2001, President George W. Bush announced that the report would be the basis of federal literacy policy and was used prominently to craft [[Reading First]], a $5 billion federal reading initiative that was part of the [[No Child Left Behind]] legislation.

==Phonemic awareness==
The NRP called [[phonemic awareness]] (PA) instruction "impressive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www1.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/nrp/Documents/report.pdf|title=See report Page 2-35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:Overall, the findings showed that teaching children to manipulate [[Phoneme|phonemes]] in words was highly effective under a variety of teaching conditions with children in kindergarten and first grade and with older learners who struggled with phonemic awareness and that teaching phonemic awareness to children significantly improves their reading more than instruction that lacks any attention to PA.

The report determined that PA instruction based on teaching children to manipulate phonemes with letters was highly effective. Phonemic awareness instruction also improved spelling in grade-level students, although it did not improve spelling in disabled readers.

==Phonics instruction==
The NRP reviewed 38 studies on the teaching of phonics and found that teaching children the relationship between letters and spelling patterns and pronunciation and how to decode words improved reading achievement. Young children who received such instruction did better with decoding words, nonsense words, spelling, fluency, and reading comprehension. Older disabled readers also benefited from such instruction in terms of improvement in decoding, but without commensurate gains in spelling or reading comprehension. [[Synthetic_phonics&amp;action=edit&amp;section=4|Systematic phonics instruction]]—that is instruction based on a planned curriculum—was found to be superior to more opportunistic versions in which teachers tried to teach what they thought students needed. There were no statistical differences between [[synthetic phonics]] programs in which each letter sound is taught versus [[analytical phonics]] that analyzes the sounds within complete words.

==Oral Reading Fluency==
The NRP analyzed 16 studies showing that teaching oral reading fluency led to improvements in word reading, fluency, and reading comprehension for students in grades 1-4, and for older students with reading problems. Instruction that had students reading texts aloud, with repetition, and feedback led to clear learning benefits.

==Encouraging Students to Read==
The panel analyzed the published research on the effects of encouraging students to read. Most of the studies of this focused on the practice of sustained silent reading, in which teachers makes books and time available for students to read on their own without interference, interruption, or teacher involvement. The research quality was particularly low and the panel concluded that there was insufficient evidence on which to determine whether such approaches have any learning benefit for students.

==Comprehension Strategy Instruction==
The panel examined the results of 204 studies on reading comprehension instruction. It was evident throughout the grades that teaching students how to think about the ideas in text can improve reading achievement. Particularly powerful in this regard were teaching students to summarize the information that they had read, or having them ask (and answer) questions about the ideas. Additionally, efforts to guide students to monitor their comprehension (essentially paying attention to whether they were understanding during reading and taking some kind of action if they were not), to use their prior knowledge, to visualize the information described in text, or to think about the structure of a text through story mapping, all provided learning benefits to students.

Nel Noddings worked in many areas of the education system. She spent seventeen years as an elementary and high school mathematics teacher and school administrator, before earning her PhD and beginning work as an academic in the fields of philosophy of education, theory of education and [[ethics]], specifically moral education and ethics of care. She became a member of the Stanford faculty in 1977, and was the Jacks Professor of Child Education from 1992 until 1998. While at Stanford University she received awards for teaching excellence in 1981, 1982 and 1997, and was the associate dean or acting dean of the School of Education for four years. After leaving Stanford University, she held positions at [[Columbia University]] and [[Colgate University]]. She is past president of the Philosophy of Education Society and the John Dewey Society. In 2002-2003 she held the John W. Porter Chair in Urban Education at [[Eastern Michigan University]]. She has been Lee L. Jacks Professor of Education, Emerita, at Stanford University since she retired in 1998.

Nel Noddings has 10 children, 39 grandchildren, and over 20 great- grandchildren, many of whom are highly educated and educators themselves.  In 2012 she lost her husband of over 60 years to cancer.

She has described her early educational experiences and her close relationships as key in her development of her philosophical position.

==Work==

===Contributions to philosophy===
Noddings' first sole-authored book ''Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education'' (1984) followed close on the 1982 publication of [[Carol Gilligan]]’s ground-breaking work in the ethics of care ''[[In a Different Voice]]''. While her work on ethics continued, with the publication of ''Women and Evil'' (1989), and later works on moral education, most of her later publications have been on the philosophy of education and educational theory. Her most significant works in these areas have been ''Educating for Intelligent Belief or Unbelief'' (1993) and ''Philosophy of Education'' (1995).

Besides contributing to philosophy, Noddings also works in the field of [[social psychology]]. Noddings is currently on the Editorial Board of ''Greater Good Magazine'', published by the [[Greater Good Science Center]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].  Noddings' contributions include the interpretation of scientific research into the roots of compassion, altruism, and peaceful human relationships.

====Nel Noddings' relational ethics====
Nel Noddings' approach to ethics of care has been described as ''relational ethics'' because it prioritizes concern for relationships. Like Carol Gilligan, Noddings accepts that justice based approaches, which are supposed to be more masculine, are genuine alternatives to ethics of care. However, unlike Gilligan, Noddings' believes that caring, 'rooted in receptivity, relatedness, and responsiveness' is a more basic and preferable approach to ethics (''Caring'' 1984, 2).

=====''Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education''=====
The key to understanding Noddings' ethics of care is to understand her notion of caring and ethical caring in particular.

Noddings believes that it would be a mistake to try to provide a systematic examination of the requirements for caring; nevertheless, she does suggest three requirements for caring (''Caring'' 1984, 11-12). She argues that the carer (''one-caring'') must exhibit engrossment and motivational displacement, and the person who is cared for (''cared-for'') must respond in some way to the caring (1984, 69). Noddings' term ''engrossment'' refers to thinking about someone in order to gain a greater understanding of him or her. Engrossment is necessary for caring because an individual's personal and physical situation must be understood before the one-caring can determine the appropriateness of any action. 'Engrossment' need not entail, as the term seems to suggest, a deep fixation on the other. It requires only the attention needed to come to understand the position of the other. Engrossment could not on its own constitute caring; someone could have a deep understanding of another person, yet act against that person's interests. Motivational displacement prevents this from occurring. Motivational displacement occurs when the one-caring's behaviour is largely determined by the needs of the person for whom she is caring. On its own, motivational displacement would also be insufficient for ethical caring. For example, someone who acted primarily from a desire to accomplish something for another person, but failed to think carefully enough about that other person's needs (failed to be correctly engrossed in the other), would fail to care. Finally, Noddings believes that caring requires some form of recognition from the cared-for that the one-caring is, in fact, caring. When there is a recognition of and response to the caring by the person cared for, Noddings describes the caring as "completed in the other" (1984, 4).

Nel Noddings draws an important distinction between natural caring and ethical caring (1984, 81-83). Noddings distinguishes between acting because "I want" and acting because "I must". When I care for someone because "I want" to care, say I hug a friend who needs hugging in an act of love, Noddings claims that I am engaged in natural caring. When I care for someone because "I must" care, say I hug an acquaintance who needs hugging in spite of my desire to escape that person's pain, according to Noddings, I am engaged in ethical caring. Ethical caring occurs when a person acts caringly out of a belief that caring is the appropriate way of relating to people. When someone acts in a caring way because that person naturally cares for another, the caring is not ethical caring (1984, 79-80). Noddings' claims that ethical caring is based on, and so dependent on, natural caring (1984, 83, 206 fn 4). It is through experiencing others caring for them and naturally caring for others that people build what is called an "ethical ideal", an image of the kind of person they want to be.

Noddings describes wrong actions in terms of "a diminishment of the ethical ideal" and "evil". A person's ethical ideal is diminished when she either chooses or is forced to act in a way that rejects her internal call to care. In effect, her image of the best person it is possible for her to be is altered in a way that lowers her ideal. According to Noddings, people and organizations can deliberately or carelessly contribute to the diminishment of other's ethical ideals. They may do this by teaching people not to care, or by placing them in conditions that prevent them from being able to care (1984, 116-119). A person is evil if, in spite of her ability to do otherwise, she either fails to personally care for someone, or prevents others from caring. Noddings writes, "[when] one intentionally rejects the impulse to care and deliberately turns her back on the ethical, she is evil, and this evil cannot be redeemed" (1984, 115).

This is referred to as "obligation". "There are moments for all of us when we care quite naturally. We just do care; no ethical effort is required. 'Want' and 'ought' are indistinguishable in such cases." I have the ability to "abstain from action if I [so] believe that anything I might do would tend to work against the best interests of the cared-for." According to Noddings we are obligated to pursue the "musts".

===Criticisms of Noddings' relational ethics===
Nel Noddings' ethics of care has been criticised by both feminists and those who favour more traditional, and allegedly masculine, approaches to ethics. In brief, feminists object that the one caring is, in effect, carrying out the traditional female role in life of giving while receiving little in return. Those who accept more traditional approaches to ethics argue that the partiality shown to those closest to us in Noddings' theory is inappropriate.

Noddings tends to use unequal relationships as a model for understanding caring. Philosopher and feminist [[Sarah Lucia Hoagland]] argues that the relationships in question, such as parenting and teaching, are ideally relationships where caring is a transitory thing designed to foster the independence of the cared-for, and so end the unequal caring relationship. Unequal relationships, she writes, are ethically problematic, and so a poor model for an ethical theory. Hoagland argues that on Noddings' account of ethical caring, the one-caring is placed in the role of the ''giver'' and the cared-for in the role of the ''taker''. The one-caring is dominant, choosing what is good for the cared-for, but gives without receiving caring in return. The cared-for is put in the position of being a dependent, with insufficient control over the nature of the caring. Hoagland believes that such unequal relationships cannot be morally good.

===Contributions to education===

====Ethic of care in education====

In [[education]], the [[ethic of care]] speaks of obligation to do something right and a sense that we must do something right when others address us.&lt;ref name="Noddings2003"&gt;Noddings et al. (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The "I must" response is induced in direct encounter in preparation for response.  We respond because we want to; either we love and respect those that address us or we have significant regard for them.&lt;ref name="Noddings2003"/&gt; As a result, the recipients of care must respond in a way that demonstrates their caring has been received.&lt;ref name="Noddings2003"/&gt;

In regards, to [[education]], caring refers to the relationship between student and teacher, not just the person who cares.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings et al. (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; As educators respond to the needs of students, teachers may see the need to design a differentiated curriculum because as teachers work closely with students, we will be moved by their different needs and interests.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings et al.(1999)&lt;/ref&gt; The claim to care must not be based on a one time virtuous decision but an ongoing interest in the student’s welfare.

===Needs in the ethic of care model===

====Distinction====

In “Identifying Needs in Education" Noddings (2003) provides criteria for deciding whether a want should be recognized or treated as a need.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; This criteria is as follows:

* The [[want]] is fairly stable over a considerable period of time and/or it is intense.
*The [[want]] is demonstrably connected to some desirable end or, at least, to one that is not harmful; further, the end is impossible or difficult to reach without the object wanted.
* The [[want]] is in the power (within the means) of those addressed to grant it.
*The [[person]] wanting is willing and able to contribute to the satisfaction of the want.

====Inferred needs====
The overt or explicit curriculum in education is designed to meet the inferred needs of students, as they are those identified by teachers or individuals to improve the classroom learning environment.  In the ethics of care philosophy, inferred needs are referred to as those that come from those not directly expressing the need.  Most needs identified by educators for learners are inferred needs because they are not being identified by the learners themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Students’ inferred needs can often be identified interactively, through working with them one on one or observing their behaviour in a classroom environment.&lt;ref name="Noddings2005a"&gt;Noddings, (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Expressed needs ====
Expressed needs are difficult to assess and address in the classroom environment, as they are needs directly expressed by learners through behaviour or words.&lt;ref name="Noddings2005a"/&gt; Although expressed needs are difficult to address, educators need to treat them positively in order to maintain a caring relationship with learners.  If expressed needs are not treated carefully, the individual might not feel cared for.&lt;ref name="Noddings2005b"&gt;Noddings, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Educators should make a consistent effort to respond to a student’s expressed needs through prior planning and discussions of moral and social issues surrounding the needs &lt;ref name="Noddings1996"&gt;Noddings, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

====Basic (universal) needs====
Basic needs are defined as the most basic needs required to survive such as food, water and shelter.&lt;ref name="Noddings1996"/&gt; Basic needs and needs associated with self-actualization (overwhelming needs) co-exist when basic needs are being compromised over extended periods of time.&lt;ref name="Noddings1996"/&gt;

====Overwhelming needs====
Overwhelming needs cannot be met by the usual processes of schooling and include extreme instances such as [[abuse]], [[neglect]] and [[illness]].&lt;ref name="Noddings1996"/&gt; As well, a student’s [[socioeconomic status]] (SES) or dysfunctional family environment can cause them to come to school with needs that cannot be expressed nor met by educators.  To help meet those overwhelming needs of students, particularly those in poor neighborhood, the [[ethic of care]] philosophy dictates that schools should be full-service institutions. Medical and dental care, social services, childcare and parenting advice should be available on campus.&lt;ref name="Noddings1996"/&gt; In turn, students in these situations are often forced into academic courses and fight an uphill battle, where they have to engage in activities that are difficult to focus on, based on their circumstances.&lt;ref name="Noddings1996"/&gt;

====Implications for education====
People who are poor, perhaps homeless, without dependable transportation cannot afford to run all over town seeking such services, and often they don’t know where to begin.&lt;ref name="Noddings1996"/&gt; Despite being aware of the overwhelming needs many students face, we force all children—regardless of interest or aptitude—into academic courses and then fight an uphill battle to motivate them to do things they do not want to do.&lt;ref name="Noddings1996"/&gt;

===Emotion and professionalism in teacher education===
[[Emotion]] has been aggravated by the rise of professions with their insistence on detachment, distance, cool appraisal and systematic procedures. Concern for [[rationality|rational]] and [[professional]] functioning keeps [[emotion]] out of [[education]], as it is supposed that real professionals do not allow themselves to feel controlled by their [[emotions]] and are forced to face problems with dispassionate rationality &lt;ref name="Noddings1996"/&gt; Noddings (1996) states that in the teaching profession, the concern takes several forms:

*Fear that [[professional]] judgment will be impaired by [[emotions]]
*Professionals must learn to protect themselves against the burnout that may result from feeling too much for one’s students
*It has become a mark of professionalism to be detached, cool and dispassionate

The use of stories in [[teacher education]] could be powerful in dispelling these beliefs, as they illustrate how deeply experienced teachers feel about the inevitable difficulties that occur in the [[classroom]] &lt;ref name="Noddings1996"/&gt;

===Educating the whole child===
In the [[ethic of care]] model, the aim of [[education]] is centered around [[happiness]].  Incorporating this component into [[education]] involves not only helping our students understand the components of [[happiness]] by allowing teachers and students to interact as a whole [[community]] &lt;ref name="Noddings2005b"/&gt;  In regard to the education of the whole child, Noddings (2005) stated that, “We will not find the solution to problems of violence, alienation, ignorance, and unhappiness in increasing our security, imposing more tests, punishing schools for their failure to produce 100 percent proficiency, or demanding that teachers be knowledgeable in the subjects they teach. Instead, we must allow teachers and students to interact as whole persons, and we must develop policies that treat the school as a whole community.” &lt;ref name="Noddings2005b"/&gt;

===Criticisms of the ethic of Care in education===
One criticism of Noddings' ethic of care, in regards to education, is that it advocates little importance to caring for oneself, except as a means to provide further care for others.&lt;ref name="Engster2004"&gt;Engster, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to [[education]], the teacher-student relationship could be jeopardized because the [[educator]] might not engage in [[self care]] and instead, devote all their energy into meeting their students' [[needs]]. Hoaglard (1991, p.&amp;nbsp;255) states that the [[caregiver]] would be defined as a “martyr, servant or slave” by the [[philosophy]] in the [[ethic of care]].  								

Another criticism of Noddings' argument is that ethic of care may result not only in the exploitation of the caregiver, but also in a smothering paternalism.&lt;ref name="Engster2004"/&gt; Goodin (1996, p.&amp;nbsp;507) writes that, “the trouble with subsuming individuals into relationships of ‘we’ness is precisely that we then risk losing track of the separateness of people”. As well, Goodin (1996, p.&amp;nbsp;116-120) states that Noddings' criteria for implicit and explicit needs assumes that needs are transparent to the caregiver and that the caregiver’s perceptions are privileged in the process of interpreting needs.  Lastly, Grimshaw (1986) explains that it is important to consider that good care always entails an element of distance between individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Grimshaw, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; She states, (1986, p.&amp;nbsp;183) “Care and understanding require the sort of distance that is needed in order not to see the other as a projection of the self, or self as a continuation of other”. Thus, a clear distance between the self and the individual that is being cared for needs to exist in order to keep the personal care of both individuals in mind.

[[File:Norbulingka Institute, with Dhauladhar range in the background.jpg|right|thumb|Norbulingka Institute, with [[Dhauladhar]] range in the background.]]
'''Norbulingka Institute''', founded in 1995 by Kelsang and [[Kim Yeshi]] at Sidhpur, near [[Dharamshala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamshala]], [[India]], is dedicated to the preservation of the Tibetan culture in its literary and artistic forms.

==Etymology==
The institute is named after [[Norbulingka]], the traditional summer residence of the [[Dalai Lama]]s, in [[Lhasa]], [[Tibet]]. The ground plan is based on the proportions of Avalokitesvara, the thousand-armed god of compassion, with the temple as the head.

==Overview==
[[File:Thangkaschilder.jpg|220x220px|thumb|A [[thangka]] painter, Norbulingka Institute]]
Norbulingka is dedicated to handing down tradition and restoring standards by providing training, education and employment for Tibetans. It supports an environment in which Tibetan community and family values can flourish. It reconciles the traditional creatively and respectfully with the modern, and seeks to create an international awareness of Tibetan values and their expression in art and literature. Norbulingka produces high quality, traditionally crafted art objects, as well as clothing and home furnishings. Free guided tours of the institute are available to visitors every day except Sunday. Workshop are also offered for those wishing to study Tibetan arts. The institute also runs two guesthouses—Norling Guesthouse and Chonor House. All proceeds from all Norbulingka's projects go directly back into the institute to further our endeavors to preserve Tibetan culture.

Norbulingka's art studios include Tibetan statue making, [[thangka]] painting, screen-printing, applique and tailoring, woodcarving, wood painting, papermaking, and wood and metal craft.

The Academy of Tibetan Culture, established in 1997, offers a three-year course of higher education in traditional Tibetan studies, as well as English, Chinese, and world history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norlingaotc.org] Academy of Tibetan Culture Website.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Research Department of Norbulingka houses the team composing the official biography of the Dalai Lama, of which nine volumes in Tibetan have already been published. The research section is also compiling a comprehensive encyclopedia of Tibetan culture.

[[File:Seat of Happiness Temple, Norbulingka Institute, Dharamsala.jpg|right|thumb|''Seat of Happiness Temple'', Norbulingka Institute.]]
The institute also has the two-storeyed 'Seat of Happiness Temple' (Deden Tsuglakhang) built in 1985 and set amidst the Japanese inspired Norbulingka gardens. It is known for its 1,173 murals of Buddha, frescoes of all the [[Dalai Lama]]s and drawings chronicling the life of the [[14th Dalai Lama]]. In the main hall stands the 4 mt high gilded copper Buddha [[Sakyamuni]] statue, made by institute's master statue-maker, the late Chenmo Pemba Dorje, and one of largest such statues outside Tibet. Around the temple are workshops of artisans and apprentices that produce various art objects, which are sold at the Norbulingka Shop, for the benefit of Tibetan refugees.

The Losel Doll Museum has [[diorama]] displays of traditional Tibetan scenes, using miniature Tibetan dolls in traditional costumes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qMqBvtL_nI0C&amp;pg=PA513&amp;dq=Norbulingka+Institute&amp;as_brr=0#PPA514,M1 Norbulingka Institute] ''Frommer's India'', by Pippa De Bruyn, Keith Bain, Niloufer Venkatraman, Shonar Joshi.

'''OER Commons''' is a freely accessible online library that allows teachers and others to search and discover [[open educational resources]] (OER) and other freely available instructional materials.

==History==
OER Commons, created by the [[Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education]], was developed to serve curriculum experts and educators in discovering [[open education]]al resources (OER) and collaborating around the use, evaluation, and improvement of those materials.&lt;ref name="ccblog"&gt;{{Cite web |author= Tim Vollmer |title= ISKME’s Lisa Petrides: Open Education and Policy |date=June 29, 2010 |work= Creative Commons Blog |url= https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/22608 |accessdate= October 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Resources on the site can be searched and filtered using an expanded set of descriptive data, including conditions of use. Teachers, students, and others enrich this "[[metadata]]" when they tag, rate, and review materials, and share what works for them.

In 2007, with a grant from the [[William and Flora Hewlett Foundation]], OER Commons opened as a [[digital library]] and intermediary for openly licensed and freely available content. By aggregating resources and standardizing metadata from OER content providers, the site supports knowledge sharing and access to teaching and learning materials, strategies, and curricula online. 
Individual educators submit their own contributions which  are curated. Materials are reviewed for quality and alignment to standards and shared primarily using [[Creative Commons]] licenses.&lt;ref name="ccblog" /&gt;

In a second phase, beginning in 2009, ISKME developed an initiative for teacher professional development program to support educators in finding and using OER supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the [[Ford Foundation]]. As part of  its teacher training program,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EMxCgIGYUI ISKME's OER Commons Teacher Training Initiative]. 2011-12. Retrieved 2012-10-31&lt;/ref&gt; ISKME trained educators from over 25 countries to use OER through workshops and summer academies, including ISKME's '''Teachers as Makers Academies'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iskme.org/our-ideas/iskmes-teachers-makers-academy Teachers as Makers Academies]. 2012-3. Retrieved 2012-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
ISKME’s OER research revealed how teachers’ exposure to OER, tools and professional development cultivates collaboration among teachers, as well as new conversations and reflection about teaching practices and roles.&lt;ref name="Pet2010"&gt;Petrides, L. and Jimes, C. (2010). Field Building in the Arts and Social Justice: Engaging Teachers, Learners, and Practitioners in the Collaborative Development and Use of Open Educational Resources. Working paper, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrides et al., 2011&lt;ref name="Pet2011"&gt;Petrides, L., Jimes, C., Middleton-Detzner, C., Walling, J. and Weiss, S. Open textbook adoption and use: Implications for teachers and learners, Open Learning: The Journal of Open, Distance and E-Learning, Vol. 26, Issue 1, 39. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, research conducted on the impact of teachers’ participation in ISKME’s own OER training network revealed that engagement with OER reduced teacher isolation (Petrides &amp; Jimes, 2010&lt;ref name="Pet2010" /&gt;), as well as expanded the role of teachers in becoming more active innovators as they shared, collaborated and learned from one another (Petrides et al., 2011&lt;ref name="Pet2011" /&gt;). This work also revealed the role that OER teacher champions play in sharing the benefits of OER with colleagues and supporting the knowledge sharing, collaboration, and use of OER in online OER communities (ISKME, 2008;&lt;ref&gt;ISKME. Creating, Doing, and Sustaining OER: Lessons from Six Open Educational Resource Projects, White paper, Half Moon Bay, CA. 2008. [http://wiki.oercommons.org/mediawiki/index.php http://wiki.oercommons.org/mediawiki/index.php]&lt;/ref&gt; Petrides &amp; Jimes, 2010;&lt;ref name="Pet2010" /&gt; Petrides et al., 2011&lt;ref name="Pet2011" /&gt;).

ISKME’s OER research also explored OER as a vehicle for disseminating adaptable curricula that support learner-centric approaches to pedagogy. ISKME’s evaluation of the Community College Open Textbook Project revealed that study habits improved when learners were able to interact with open course material, and that students’ use of open textbooks cultivated new, self-directed learning behaviors (Petrides et al., 2011&lt;ref name="Pet2011" /&gt;).

Finally, ISKME’s research revealed the role that collaboration plays in supporting the creation of open educational resources. Specifically, ISKME’s study of authors who created content within the open repository Connexions revealed how as content creation group size increased beyond one author, the probability that users stayed with Connexions (and continued to create content) increased with it (Petrides et al., 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Petrides, L., Nguyen, L., Jimes, C., and Karaglani, A. Open educational resources: Inquiring into author use and reuse. International Journal of Technology Enhanced Education, Vol. 1, No. 1-2: 98-117. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology and design==

ISKME’s technology platform, tools, and metadata enhancement in its work with OER Commons are designed to support an open platform that serves as a knowledge base for content providers and platform developers, particularly related to accessibility and inclusive design. Metadata, data that describes a resource, and in the case of open educational resources, includes descriptors such as title, author, material type, and material license. Metadata standards provide a template for OER providers to share their resources with other providers. OER Commons receives feeds of OER in [[Dublin Core]] (DC), [[IEEE]]'s [[Learning Object Metadata]] (LOM), and [[RSS]].  OER Commons provide targets to other providers to harvest content in these formats.

Partnered with the Inclusive Design Research Centre since 2010 to incorporate FLOE components into the OER Commons platform, ISKME’s efforts combine OER discovery and enhancement tools and processes with FLOE’s personalized network-delivered accessibility standards and tools.

In 2012, ISKME released Open Author, an authoring and remixing environment to support the creation and adaption of multi-media accessible OER and enable collaborative workflows of content reviewers and creators. The authoring environment produces OER that is accessible using a broad range of assistive technology devices such as screen readers.

To support user contributions, in 2010 ISKME released the OER-Connector browser plug-in on [[GitHub]] that enables users to add resources to OER Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= OER-Connector |date= August 22, 2010 |format=Project page  |work= GitHub |url= https://github.com/ISKME/oer-connector |accessdate= October 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To support interoperability, OER Commons is an experimental node in the Learning Registry, a joint [[US Department of Education]] and [[US Department of Defense]] initiative to support educational content and platform interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= ISKME / OER Commons |work= Learning Registry contributor page |url= http://learningregistry.org/iskme-oer-commons |accessdate= October 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The OER Commons contains custom curated resource collections, or microsites. Within a microsite, OER is presented in the context of customized taxonomies to categorize and describe relevant OER. In 2011, ISKME announced the Green Micro-site with Greek partner Agro-Know. It is an aggregation of sustainability-related learning resources and features  interdisciplinary lesson plans such as STEAM ([[Science Technology Engineering Art and Math]]) resources.

The OER Commons infrastructure facilitates evaluation of content and alignment to quality rubrics and standards. Starting in 2011, OER Commons provides an embedded [[Common Core State Standards]] alignment tool and Achieve OER Rubric to support state-level curriculum committees as well as individual instructors to review content for quality and alignment and to collaboratively address gaps in content collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.achieve.org/oer-rubrics. Achieve OER Rubric.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
ISKME was named an Education Laureate by the [[San Jose Tech Museum of Innovation]] in 2007 for OER Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Institute for the Study of Knowledge Management in Education, OER Commons |year= 2007 |work= Tech Award Laureates |url= http://thetechawards.thetech.org/the-laureates/stories/1444 |accessdate= October 23, 2013 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131102000210/http://thetechawards.thetech.org/the-laureates/stories/1444 |archivedate= November 2, 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, ISKME was named a finalist in the '''[[Qatar Foundation]] [[The WISE Awards|World Innovation Summit for Education (WISE) Awards]]''' for its OER Commons teacher professional development programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/2010-wise-awards-honor-educational-excellence-109030214.html 2010 WISE Awards Honor Educational Excellence]. Retrieved 4 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ISKME won the '''Award for Bodies which Influence Policy''' from the '''Open Educational Quality Initiative (OPAL)''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oer-quality.org/the-institute-for-the-study-of-knowledge-management-in-education-iskme-usa/ OPAL Award for Bodies which Influence Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905044617/http://www.oer-quality.org/the-institute-for-the-study-of-knowledge-management-in-education-iskme-usa/ |date=2012-09-05 }}.

'''openHPI''' is a platform for massive open online courses ([[MOOC]]) in the field of computer science and information technology. It is hosted at the [[Hasso Plattner Institute]] (HPI) in Potsdam, Germany.&lt;ref name='openHPI'&gt;{{cite web| title = 
openHPI - The MOOC Offer at Hasso Plattner Institute|publisher=Christoph Meinel, Christian Willems |date=August 2013| url = http://opus.kobv.de/ubp/volltexte/2013/6717/pdf/tbhpi80.pdf | accessdate = 2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  openHPI is open to everyone, and participation is free of charge. Everybody can register and enroll for courses without any prerequisites. openHPI’s courses are derived from HPI’s bachelor and master programs in IT-Systems Engineering and cover both, foundations of information technology as well as highly topical innovations.

The course languages are English and German. openHPI offers around six to ten courses per year. All courses follow the same educational format: The subject domain is split into two to six weekly units. Each week, video lectures, reading materials and quizzes are presented in a learning sequence. Learners can ask their questions and discuss points of interest with each other in the course discussion forum which is actively moderated by the teaching team. Learning progress is measured through self-tests which can be repeated as often as desired, and assessed in graded weekly assignments, and a graded final exam. Participants who achieve at least 50% of the total score receive a record of achievement. After a course ends, materials remain available in archive mode.

== History ==
The platform, which began in [https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/index/index/year/2013/docId/6548 September 2012], pioneered the MOOC format in Germany. The first course covered the topic of In-Memory Data Management and was given by the founder of the HPI, Prof. [[Hasso Plattner]]. In 2017, five years after its launch, openHPI reached the benchmark of 400,000 enrollments.
&lt;ref name='zeit'&gt;{{cite web| title = Hasso-Plattner-Institut bietet kostenlose Informatikkurse im Netz an|publisher=Zeit Online |date=July 31, 2012| url = http://www.zeit.de/studium/hochschule/2012-07/hpi-internet-kurse | accessdate = 2 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things, the courses contain the following topics:
* [[In-memory database|In-Memory Data Management]] 
* Internetworking with [[TCP/IP]] 
* Internet Security for Beginners
* Web Technologies
* Embedded [[Home automation|Smart Home]] 
* [[Semantic Web]] Technologies 
* [[Data Management]] with [[SQL]] 
* [[Business Process]] Modeling and Analysis 
* Objekt-oriented programming in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] 
* [[Linux]] for everyone

== Technical Aspects ==
The platform was originally based on the popular learning management system [[Instructure#Canvas|Canvas]], with some technical adaptations for example a reworked front end. The experience with the first courses showed that this system was not able to scale to many thousands of participants. Therefore, a new platform&lt;ref&gt;https://hpi.de/fileadmin/user_upload/fachgebiete/meinel/papers/Web-University/2013_Meinel_CSEDU.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; was developed from scratch in the sense of a service-oriented architecture (SOA), which allows better scalability and more flexibility regarding the integration of  features. Video streaming is made through the streaming provider Vimeo. The platform uses a dual stream video player which allows the synchronous playback of two video sources, for example the video of a lecturer together with the video of the presentation slides. In 2015, the programming platform CodeOcean was developed by HPI researchers and integrated in openHPI. CodeOcean is available as an open source solution and allows programming directly in the browser. It has already been used in the openHPI courses “[https://open.hpi.de/courses/javaeinstieg2015 Java für Einsteiger],” “[https://open.hpi.de/courses/webtech2015 Web Technologies],” and “[https://open.hpi.de/courses/pythonjunior2015 Spielend Programmieren lernen]”.
Since 2017, the open mode has been available on openHPI, meaning that you can watch many of the videos without having to create an account. Only for specific actions, such as writing in the forum or taking an exam, you need to enroll.

== Partner Platforms ==
Since 2013, [[SAP SE]] has used another instance of the same platform ([[OpenSAP|openSAP]]) to make its training offers available to employees, customers, and a broad public&lt;ref&gt;https://searchsap.techtarget.com/news/450304283/SAP-beefs-up-its-openSAP-MOOC-learning-platform-with-7-new-courses Retrieved on April 26, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;.
The Hasso Plattner Institute has run another instance of the same platform called [https://mooc.house/ mooc.house] since 2015. The mooc.house platform is a white label solution for companies, institutions, and individuals who want to offer their own online courses.
In 2017, the Hasso Plattner Institute set up another MOOC platform for the [[World Health Organization|World Health Organization (WHO)]]. On [https://openwho.org/ OpenWHO], the WHO offers online courses on topics that focus on improving the response to health emergencies.

An '''Ordinary''' was a type of lecture given in universities of the [[Middle Ages]]. Lectures were distinguished by the time of day they were conducted: an ''ordinary'' was conducted by fully qualified professors on fundamental texts in the morning, while ''extraordinary'' lectures were given in the afternoon by bachelors (the medieval equivalent of a graduate student) on less important texts.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, John W., ''The Scholastic Culture of the Middle Ages, 1000-1300'', p. 60 {{ISBN|978-0-88133-942-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3913">'''Orlando Harrison Baker''' (September 16, 1830 – August 6, 1913) was a professor of ancient languages at [[Simpson College]] in Iowa and the principal of [[Algona College]]. He later served as the U. S. consul at  posts in Denmark, Australia, and Borneo. 

==Life==
Orlando Harrison Baker was born in [[Union County, Indiana]],&lt;ref name=depauw/&gt; the oldest child of Jacob Baker and Mary Baker.&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt; He was educated at Mt. Morris Seminary in Illinois and at [[Allegheny College]] in [[Meadville, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt;&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt; For lack of money he had to drop out of college and go to work as a carpenter, painter, and teacher.&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt;&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt; He eventually saved up enough to complete his undergraduate degree at Indiana Asbury University (now [[DePauw University]]) in 1857.&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt;&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt; He was ordained a minister around 1858, and he received his M.A. from Indiana Asbury University in 1861.&lt;ref name=depauw/&gt; 

In 1868, he took up the post of professor of Latin and Greek at [[Simpson College]].&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt; In 1871, he moved to [[Algona College]] to serve as its president, a position he held until the college closed in 1875.&lt;ref name=depauw/&gt; From 1875 to 1877, he served as pastor of churches in [[Cambridge, Iowa|Cambridge]] and [[Boone, Iowa|Boonsboro]],&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt; and in 1878 he became the principal of the Boonsboro school system.&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt; 

In 1879, he moved his family back to Indianola,&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt;&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt; and the following year he took up the editorship of the Indianola ''Herald'', a position he held until 1886.&lt;ref name=depauw/&gt;&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt; Following that, he became a traveling correspondent for the ''[[Chicago Inter Ocean]]'' newspaper until 1892.&lt;ref name=depauw/&gt;

Baker next moved into government service as a U.S. consul, first in Copenhagen, Denmark (1893-94) and then Sydney, Australia (1900-08).&lt;ref name=depauw/&gt; In 1908, he took up the consulship of [[Sandakan]], North Borneo, where he remained to the end of his life.&lt;ref name=depauw/&gt;&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt; In 1905, as he was on his way back to the United States on leave, he died on board the U.S. transport ''Thomas'' in the harbor at Nagasaki, Japan.&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt;&lt;ref name=iowa/&gt;

==Family==
Baker married Mary Catherine Ridley in 1858; she died in 1890 and he remarried, to Rachel Halton Beach.&lt;ref name=depauw/&gt; He had six children, four of whom survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt;  His daughters Myra and [[Joanna Baker|Joanna]] also became professors, Myra at Napa College and Joanna at Simpson College.&lt;ref name=genealogy/&gt;

A '''perfect attendance award''' is traditionally given in [[United States|U.S.]] [[school]]s as a way to honor [[student]]s who have neither missed any days of nor been late to [[Class (education)|class]]. Supporters believe that the award promotes education by encouraging students to attend class whenever it is in session. However, some believe that offering a perfect attendance award promotes [[presenteeism]] and hurts public health by causing students to attend class when sick with a potentially contagious illness,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Sense of community''' (or '''psychological sense of community''') is a concept in [[community psychology]], [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]], and [[Community practice|community social work]], as well as in several other research disciplines, such as [[urban sociology]], which focuses on the ''experience'' of community rather than its structure, formation, setting, or other features. The latter is the province of [[public administration]] or community services administration which needs to understand how structures influence this feeling and psychological sense of community. [[Sociologist]]s, [[social psychologist]]s, [[anthropologist]]s, and others have theorized about and carried out [[empirical research]] on community, but the [[psychological]] approach asks questions about the individual's [[perception]], [[understanding]], [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[emotion|feelings]], etc. about community and his or her relationship to it and to others' participation—indeed to the complete, multifaceted community experience.

In his seminal 1974 book, psychologist [[Seymour B. Sarason]] proposed that psychological sense of community become the conceptual center for the psychology of [[community]], asserting that it "is one of the major bases for self-definition." By 1986 it was regarded as a central overarching concept for [[community psychology]] (Sarason, 1986; Chavis &amp; Pretty, 1999).In addition, the theoretical concept entered the other applied academic disciplines as part of "communities for all" initiatives in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Magrab, P. (1999). The meaning of community. (pp. 3-30). In: R.N. Roberts &amp; P. R. Magrab, ''Where Children Live: Solutions for Serving Young Children and their Families''. Stamford, Ct: Ablex Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among theories of sense of community proposed by [[psychologist]]s, McMillan &amp; Chavis's (1986) is by far the most influential, and is the starting point for most of the recent research in the field. It is discussed in detail below.

== Definitions ==

For Sarason, psychological sense of community is "the [[perception]] of similarity to others, an acknowledged [[interdependence]] with others, a willingness to maintain this interdependence by giving to or doing for others what one expects from them, and the feeling that one is part of a larger dependable and stable structure" (1974, p.&amp;nbsp;157).

McMillan &amp; Chavis (1986) define sense of community as "a feeling that members have of belonging, a feeling that members matter to one another and to the group, and a shared faith that members' needs will be met through their [[personal commitment|commitment]] to be together."

Gusfield (1975) identified two dimensions of community: territorial and relational. The relational dimension of community has to do with the nature and quality of relationships in that community, and some communities may even have no discernible territorial demarcation, as in the case of a community of scholars working in a particular specialty, who have some kind of contact and quality of relationship, but may live and work in disparate locations, perhaps even throughout the world. Other communities may seem to be defined primarily according to territory, as in the case of [[neighborhood]]s, but even in such cases, proximity or shared territory cannot by itself constitute a community; the relational dimension is also essential.

[[Factor analysis]] of their urban neighborhoods [[questionnaire]] yielded two distinct factors which Riger and Lavrakas (1981) characterized as "social bonding" and "physical rootedness", very similar to the two dimensions proposed by Gusfield.
Early work on psychological sense of community was based on neighborhoods as the referent, and found a relationship between psychological sense of community and '''greater participation''' (Hunter, 1975; Wandersman &amp; Giamartino, 1980), '''perceived safety''' (Doolittle &amp; McDonald, 1978), '''ability to function competently in the community''' (Glynn, 1981), '''social bonding''' (Riger &amp; Lavrakas, 1981), '''social fabric''' (strengths of [[interpersonal relationship]]) (Ahlbrandt &amp; Cunningham, 1979), '''greater sense of purpose and perceived control''' (Bachrach &amp; Zautra, 1985), and '''greater civic contributions''' ([[Donation|charitable contributions]] and civic involvement) (Davidson &amp; Cotter, 1986). These initial studies lacked a clearly articulated [[conceptual framework]], however, and none of the measures developed were based on a [[theoretical definition]] of psychological sense of community.

== Primary theoretical foundation: McMillan and Chavis ==

McMillan &amp; Chavis's (1986) theory (and instrument) are the most broadly validated and widely utilized in this area in the psychological literature. They prefer the abbreviated label "sense of community", and propose that sense of community is composed of four elements.

===Four elements of sense of community===
There are four elements of "sense of community" according to the McMillan &amp; Chavis theory:

====Membership====
Membership includes five attributes:
* boundaries
* emotional safety
* a sense of belonging and identification
* personal investment
* a common symbol system

====Influence====
Influence works both ways: members need to feel that they have some influence in the group, and some influence by the group on its members is needed for group cohesion. Current researches (e.g. Chigbu, 2013) on rural and urban communities have found that sense of community is a major factor.

====Integration and fulfillment of needs====
Members feel rewarded in some way for their participation in the community.

====Shared emotional connection====
The "definitive element for true community" (1986, p.&amp;nbsp;14), it includes shared history and shared participation (or at least identification with the history).

===Dynamics within and between the elements===
McMillan &amp; Chavis (1986) give the following example to illustrate the dynamics within and between these four elements (p.&amp;nbsp;16):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Someone puts an announcement on the dormitory bulletin board about the formation of an intramural dormitory basketball team. People attend the organizational meeting as strangers out of their individual needs (integration and fulfillment of needs). The team is bound by place of residence (membership boundaries are set) and spends time together in practice (the contact hypothesis). They play a game and win (successful shared valent event). While playing, members exert energy on behalf of the team (personal investment in the group). As the team continues to win, team members become recognized and congratulated (gaining honor and status for being members). Someone suggests that they all buy matching shirts and shoes (common symbols) and they do so (influence).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Current research====
In their 2002 study of a [[community of interest]], specifically the science fiction fandom community, Obst, Zinkiewicz, and Smith suggest Conscious Identification as the fifth dimension (Obst, 2002).

== Empirical assessment ==

Chavis et al.'s '''Sense of Community Index''' ('''SCI''') (see Chipuer &amp; Pretty, 1999; Long &amp; Perkins, 2003), originally designed primarily in reference to neighborhoods, can be adapted to study other communities as well, including the [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]], [[school]]s, [[religious communities]], communities of interest, etc.

Four times per year, Solution Tree publishes the &lt;em&gt;AllThingsPLC Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, which features information about PLCs and personal commentaries from educators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.solutiontree.com/products/all-things-plc-magazine.html|title=AllThingsPLC Magazine|publisher=Solution Tree|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Collaborators ==
Solution Tree collaborates with thought-leaders in education topics, such as [[Richard DuFour]] ([[Professional learning community|PLCs]]), [[Robert J. Marzano]] ([[evidence-based education]]), James Bellanca ([[deeper learning]]), [[Timothy Kanold]] (mathematics), [[Kurt W. Fischer]] ([[educational neuroscience]]), and [[Will Richardson]] (technology in education). The company often publishes and partners with professionals currently in the education industry to provide their expertise in education. This has raised questions in transparency in private earning by school officials&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/lake-county-news-sun/news/ct-educational-consulting-stevenson-met-20151023-story.html|title=School officials' consulting raises questions of transparency|last=Black|first=Lisa|publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=17 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Proponents argue that it represents a shift toward educational materials being written by educators and is driven by the desire to produce the best results.

'''Steven Sol Skiena''' (born January 30, 1961) is a Distinguished Teaching Professor of [[Computer Science]] at [[Stony Brook University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/Distinguished-Professor-Award-2009-Steven-Skiena Distinguished Teaching Professor Award: Steven Skiena] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004140152/https://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/Distinguished-Professor-Award-2009-Steven-Skiena |date=2017-10-04 }}, Stony Brook CS, accessed 2017-10-03.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was co-founder of [[General Sentiment]], a social media and news analytics company, and served as Chief Science Officer from 2009 to 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generalsentiment.com/who-we-are.html General Sentiment personnel page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611000738/http://www.generalsentiment.com/who-we-are.html |date=2012-06-11 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
His research interests include [[algorithm design]] and its applications to [[biology]].  Skiena is the author of several popular books in the fields of algorithms, programming, and mathematics.
''The Algorithm Design Manual'' is widely used as an undergraduate text in algorithms and within the tech industry for job interview preparation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html] [[Steve Yegge]]'s blog&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Skiena was awarded the [[IEEE Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate Teaching Award]] "for outstanding contributions to undergraduate education in the areas of algorithms and discrete mathematics and for influential textbook and software."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.computer.org/web/awards/cse-steven-skiena Steven Skiena: 2001 Computer Science and Engineering Undergraduate Teaching Award], IEEE Computer Society, accessed 2017-10-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skiena has worked on algorithmic problems in [[synthetic biology]], and, in particular, issues of optimal gene design for a given protein under various constraints.
In collaboration with virologist [[Eckard Wimmer]], he has worked to computationally design synthetic viruses for use as [[attenuated vaccine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coleman | display-authors = etal   | year = 2008 | title = Virus attenuation by genome-scale changes in codon pair bias | url = | journal = Science | volume = 320 | issue = 5884| pages = 1784–7 | doi = 10.1126/science.1155761 | pmid = 18583614 | pmc=2754401}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Their Synthetic Attenuated Virus Engineering (SAVE) approach has been validated in flu&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mueller | display-authors = etal | year = 2010 | title =  Live attenuated influenza virus vaccines by computer-aided rational design.| journal = Nature Biotechnology | volume = 28 | issue = 7| pages = 723–6 | pmid = 20543832 | doi=10.1038/nbt.1636 | pmc=2902615}}&lt;/ref&gt; and experiments with other viruses are ongoing.
A popular account of this work appears in Dennis Shasha and Cathy Lazare's ''Natural Computing.''&lt;ref&gt;Natural Computing; Dennis Shasha and Cathy Lazare, W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Skiena played a role in the conception of the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[iPad]].
In 1988, Skiena and his team won a competition run by Apple to design the ''Computer of the Year 2000''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

[[File:Stock Market Learning rgb 300dpi.jpg|thumb|Stock Market Learning - Logo]]
'''Stock Market Learning''' is an international competition run by the [[Savings bank|Savings Banks]] in Europe with the support of the [[European Savings Banks Group]] (ESBG) based in Brussels. It aims to provide pupils a better understanding of the [[stock market]] and of the economic and financial world by simulating transactions in [[stock exchange]]s.  The competition was held for the first time in Germany in 1983, while the Savings Banks in Europe became actively involved in 1999. By 2010, over 1 million teams had taken part in the initiative.

==Procedure==
Each team is assigned an account with virtual capital that is to be used to buy and sell [[Security (finance)|securities]]. The purpose is to increase initial [[asset]]s by conducting individual investing strategies. While capital is virtual, trading is based on real [[Share price|stock prices]] at certain stock exchanges.

The list of tradable securities consists primarily of [[Share (finance)|shares]] but also includes [[Fixed interest|fixed-interests]] securities and [[Collective investment scheme|investment funds]]. Since 2009, there is both a conventional and [[sustainability]] competition. The former takes into consideration the total performance of the account, whereas the latter is based on the sustainability account value, i.e. on the earnings gained from shares listed in a [[sustainability index]].

==Awards==
In 2010, Stock Market Learning received the official [[United Nations Decade of Education for Sustainable Development|UN Decade Project of Education for Sustainable Development]] award from the German Commission for UNESCO.

The passage of laws that discriminate against LGBT people have been shown to have significant negative impacts on the physical and mental health and well-being of LGBT youth; for example, depression and drug use among LGBT people have been shown to increase significantly after the passage of discriminatory laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ajph.aphapublications.org/cgi/content/abstract/100/3/452 |title=The Impact of Institutional Discrimination on Psychiatric Disorders in Lesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Populations: A Prospective Study by Mark L.

[[Anti-LGBT bullying|Bullying of LGBT youth]] has been shown to be a contributing factor in many suicides, even if not all of the attacks have been specifically regarding sexuality or gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Savin-Williams | first1 = Ritch C | year = 1994 | title = Verbal and physical abuse as stressors in the lives of lesbian, gay male, and bisexual youths: Associations with school problems, running away, substance abuse, prostitution, and suicide | url = | journal = Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology | volume = 62 | issue = 2| pages = 261–269 | doi = 10.1037/0022-006X.62.2.261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since a series of suicides in the early 2000s, more attention has been focused on the issues and underlying causes in an effort to reduce suicides among LGBT youth. Research by the [[Family Acceptance Project]] has demonstrated that "parental acceptance, and even neutrality, with regard to a child's sexual orientation" can bring down the attempted suicide rate.&lt;ref name="Natpublic"/&gt;

The [[National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention]] notes that there is no national data (for the U.S.) regarding suicidal ideation or suicide rates among the LGBT population as a whole or in part, for LGBT youth or LGBT seniors, for example.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention Tackles LGBT Suicide, April 26, 2012, Kellan Baker and Josh Garcia. [http://actionallianceforsuicideprevention.blogspot.com/2012/04/national-action-alliance-for-suicide.html National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention]&lt;/ref&gt; In part because there is no agreed percentage of the national population that is LGBT, or even identifies as LGBT, death certificates do not include sexuality information.&lt;ref name="naasp"/&gt; A 1986 study noted that previous large scale studies of completed suicides did not "consider sexual orientation in their data analyses".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rich | first1 = C.

==Reports and studies==
Clinical social worker Caitlin Ryan's Family Acceptance Project ([[San Francisco State University]]) conducted the first study of the effect of family acceptance and rejection on the health, mental health and well-being of LGBT youth, including suicide, [[HIV/AIDS]] and [[Homeless LGBT youth|homelessness]].&lt;ref name="visalia"&gt;Helping LGBT youth, others learn to cope, April 27, 2012, ''Visalia Times-Delta''. [http://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/201204280400/OPINION09/204280325]&lt;/ref&gt; Their research shows that LGBT youths "who experience high levels of rejection from their families during adolescence (when compared with those young people who experienced little or no rejection from parents and caregivers) were more than eight times likely to have attempted suicide, more than six times likely to report high levels of depression, more than three times likely to use illegal drugs and more than three times likely to be at high risk for HIV or other STDs"  by the time they reach their early 20s.&lt;ref name=visalia/&gt;{{dead link|date=February 2016}}

Numerous studies have shown that lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth have a higher rate of suicide attempts than do heterosexual youth.  The Suicide Prevention Resource Center synthesized these studies and estimated that between 5 and 10% of LGBT youth, depending on age and sex groups, have attempted suicide, a rate 1.5-3 times higher than heterosexual youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprc.org/library/SPRC_LGBT_Youth.pdf |title=Preventing Suicide among Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgendered, and Questioning Youth and Young Adults |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A U.S. government study, titled ''Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide'', published in 1989, found that LGBT youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than other young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED334503&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED334503 |title=Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide |publisher=Eric.ed.gov |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; This higher prevalence of suicidal ideation and overall mental health problems among gay teenagers compared to their heterosexual peers has been attributed to [[minority stress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=August 21, 2011 |url=http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=10851 |title=Definition of Bisexual suicide risk |publisher=Medterms.com |date=1999-10-27 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Meyer IH |title=Prejudice, social stress, and mental health in lesbian, gay, and bisexual populations: conceptual issues and research evidence |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=129 |issue=5 |pages=674–97 |date=September 2003 |pmid=12956539 |pmc=2072932 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.5.674}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "More than 34,000 people die by suicide each year," making it "the third leading cause of death among 15 to 24 year olds with lesbian, gay, and bisexual youth attempting suicide up to four times more than their heterosexual peers."&lt;ref name="Thetrevorproject.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetrevorproject.org/suicide-resources/suicidal-signs |title=Additional Facts about Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth |publisher=Thetrevorproject.org |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is impossible to know the exact suicide rate of LGBT youth because sexuality and gender minorities are often hidden and even unknown, particularly in this age group. Further research is currently being done to explain the prevalence of suicide among LGBT youths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youth.org/loco/PERSONProject/Resources/ResearchStudies/suicide2.html "Sexual Orientation and Youth Suicide"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104141541/http://www.youth.org/loco/PERSONProject/Resources/ResearchStudies/suicide2.html |date=2006-01-04 }} by Dr. Gary Remafedi, October 6, 1999, retrieved 2 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2248/is_146_37/ai_89942832 "Youth suicide risk and sexual orientation - Statistical Data Included"] by Rutter, Philip A &amp; Soucar, Emil, Summer 2002, retrieved 2 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jeramyt.org/gay/gaysuic.htm Articles Relating to Suicide by GLB Youth], retrieved 3 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of school climate, "approximately 25 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual students and university employees have been harassed due to their sexual orientation, as well as a third of those who identify as transgender, according to the study and reported by the Chronicle of Higher Education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/15/lgbt-students-harassed-at_n_717992.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Danielle | last=Wienerbronner | title=LGBT Students Harassed At Colleges Nationwide, New Report Says | date=2010-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research has found the presence of gay-straight alliances (GSAs) in schools is associated with decreased suicide attempts; in a study of LGBT youth, ages 13–22, 16.9% of youth who attended schools with GSAs attempted suicide versus 33.1% of students who attended schools without GSAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walls|first=N.

Gay straight alliances and the mental health of sexual minority youth|journal=School Social Work Journal|date=March 2013|volume=37|issue=2|pages=88–111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"LGBT students are three times as likely as non-LGBT students to say that they do not feel safe at school (22% vs. 7%) and 90% of LGBT students (vs. 62% of non-LGBT teens) have been harassed or assaulted during the past year."&lt;ref name=autogenerated&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetrevorproject.org/suicide-resources/suicidal-signs |title=Additional Facts About Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth |publisher=Thetrevorproject.org |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, "LGBQ students were more likely than heterosexual students to have seriously considered leaving their institution as a result of harassment and discrimination."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last=Rothaus |first=Steve |url=http://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2010/09/college-study-reveals-chilly-campus-climate-toward-lesbian-gay-bisexual-transgender-people.html |title=Steve Rothaus' Gay South Florida |publisher=Miamiherald.typepad.com |date=2010-09-15 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Susan Rankin, a contributing author to the report in Miami, found that “Unequivocally, The 2010 State of Higher Education for LGBT People demonstrates that LGBT students, faculty and staff experience a ‘chilly’ campus climate of harassment and far less than welcoming campus communities."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The internet is also an important factor for LGBT. An international study found that suicidal LGBT showed important differences with suicidal heterosexuals, in a matched-pairs study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harris | first1 = K. M. | year = 2013 | title = Sexuality and suicidality: Matched-pairs analyses reveal unique characteristics in non-heterosexual suicidal behaviors | url = | journal = Archives of Sexual Behavior | volume = 42 | issue = 5| pages = 729–737 | doi = 10.1007/s10508-013-0112-2 | pmid=23657812}}&lt;/ref&gt; That study found suicidal LGBT were more likely to communicate suicidal intentions, more likely to search for new friends online, and found more support online than did suicidal heterosexuals.

According to a study in Taiwan, 1 in 5 or 20% of Taiwanese gay people have attempted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.pinkpaper.com/NewsStory/7293/18/04/2012/nearly-20-per-cent-of-taiwans-gay-population-have-attempted-suicide-report-claims.aspx |title=Nearly 20 per cent of Taiwan's gay population have attempted suicide, report claims |first=Peter |last=Lloyd |publisher=Pink Paper |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714063838/http://news.pinkpaper.com/NewsStory/7293/18/04/2012/nearly-20-per-cent-of-taiwans-gay-population-have-attempted-suicide-report-claims.aspx |archivedate=14 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black transgender and gender non-conforming community has been found to face discrimination to a higher degree than the rest of the transgender community, which is due to the intersection of racism and transphobia. Research has found that this community experiences a higher level of poverty, suicide attempts, and harassment, while the effects of HIV  and being refused health care due to transphobia and/or racism are greater as well. The National LGBTQ task force conducted a survey to discern these trends among the black transgender non-conforming community in with the overall transgender community. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.thetaskforce.org/new-analysis-shows-startling-levels-of-discrimination-against-black-9-people/]{{dead link|date=October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The survey found that amongst the black respondents 49% reported having attempted suicide.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Additional findings were that this group reported that 26% are unemployed and 34% reported an annual income of less than $10,000 per year. 42% of respondents reported homelessness&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrc.org/resources/being-african-american-lgbtq-an-introduction|title=Being African American &amp; LGBTQ: An Introduction - Human Rights Campaign|first=Human Rights|last=Campaign|website=Human Rights Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is five times the rate of the US homelessness rate. Also, the report revealed that the black transgender or gender non-conforming community reported 20.23%&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; were living with HIV.  27% of black transgender youth reported being physically assaulted, 15% were sexually assaulted and 21% left school due to these instances of harassment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Impact of same-sex marriage===
The establishment of [[same-sex marriage]] is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children, with the effect being concentrated among children of a minority sexual orientation (LGB youth). A study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the rate of attempted suicide among all schoolchildren in grades 9–12 declined by 7% and the rate of attempted suicide among schoolchildren of a minority sexual orientation (LGB youth) in grades 9–12 declined by 14% in states which established same-sex marriage, resulting in approximately 134,000 fewer children attempting suicide each year in the United States. The researchers took advantage of the gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from 1 state in 2004 to all 50 states in 2015) to compare the rate of attempted suicide among children in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among children occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage.

The [[diathesis-stress model]] suggests that biological vulnerabilities predispose individuals to different conditions such as [[cancer]], [[heart disease]], and mental health conditions like [[major depression]], a risk factor for [[suicide]].  Varying amounts of environmental stress increase the probability that these individuals will develop that condition. [[Minority stress]] theory suggests that minority status leads to increased discrimination from the social environment which leads to greater stress and health problems.  In the presence of poor emotion regulation skills this can lead to poor mental health.  Also, the [[differential susceptibility hypothesis]] suggests that for some individuals their physical and mental development is highly dependent on their environment in a “for-better-and-for-worse” fashion.  That is, individuals who are highly susceptible will have better than average health in highly supportive environments and significantly worse than average health in hostile, violent environments.  The model can help explain the unique health problems affecting LGBT populations including increased suicide attempts.  For adolescents, the most relevant environments are the family, neighborhood, and school. Adolescent bullying - which is highly prevalent among sexual minority youths - is a chronic stressor that can increase risk for suicide via the [[diathesis-stress model]]. In a study of American lesbian, gay, and bisexual adolescents, Mark Hatzenbuehler examined the effect of the county-level social environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |year=2011 |journal=Pediatrics |volume=127 |issue=5 |pages=896–903 |title= The Social Environment and Suicide Attempts inLesbian, Gay, and Bisexual Youth |doi=10.1542/peds.2010-3020|pmc=3081186 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was indexed by the proportion of same-sex couples and Democrats living in the counties.  Also included were the proportions of schools with gay-straight alliances as well as anti-bullying and antidiscrimination policies that include [[sexual orientation]].  He found that a more conservative social environment elevated risk in suicidal behavior among all youth and that this effect was stronger for LGB youth.  Furthermore, he found that the social environment partially mediated the relation between LGB status and suicidal behaviour. Hatzenbuehler found that even after such social as well as individual factors were controlled for, however, that "LGB status remained a significant predictor of suicide attempts."

==Institutionalized and internalized homophobia==
Institutionalized and internalized [[homophobia]] may also lead LGBT youth to not accept themselves and have deep internal conflicts about their sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, P. (1989), “Gay and Lesbian Youth Suicide”, in Fenleib, Marcia R. (ed.), Report of the Secretary's Task Force on Youth Suicide, United States Government Printing Office, {{ISBN|0-16-002508-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parents may abandon or force children out of home after the child's [[coming out]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/11/20/142364493/young-gay-and-homeless-fighting-for-resources|title=Young, Gay And Homeless: Fighting For Resources|first=Margot|last=Adler|work=[[NPR]]|date=November 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homophobia arrived at by any means can be a gateway to [[bullying]] which can take many forms. Physical bullying is kicking, punching, while emotional bullying is name calling, spreading rumors and other [[verbal abuse]]. [[Cyber bullying]] involves abusive text messages or messages of the same nature on [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]], and other [[social media]] networks. Sexual bullying is inappropriate touching, lewd gestures or jokes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Janice L. Habuda |url=http://www.buffalonews.com/city/schools/article234752.ece |title=Students learn about bullying |publisher=Buffalonews.com |date=2010-10-29 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullying may be considered a "[[rite of passage]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Crime and Punishment, Volumes 1-4 |first=David |last=Levinson |page=137 |isbn= 9780761922582 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but studies have shown it has negative physical and psychological effects. "Sexual minority youth, or teens that identify themselves as gay, lesbian or bisexual, are bullied two to three times more than heterosexuals", and "almost all transgender students have been verbally harassed (e.g., called names or threatened in the past year at school because of their sexual orientation (89%) and gender expression (89%)") according to [[Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network]]'s ''Harsh Realities, The Experiences of Transgender Youth In Our Nation’s Schools''.&lt;ref name="Thetrevorproject.org"/&gt;

This issue has been a hot topic for media outlets over the past few years, and even more so in the months of September and October 2010. President [[Barack Obama]] has posted an "It Gets Better" video on [[The White House]] website as part of the [[It Gets Better Project]]. First lady [[Michelle Obama]] attributes such behaviors to the examples parents set as, in most cases, children follow their lead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/28/michelle-obama-addresses-_0_n_775708.html |title=Michelle Obama On Bullying: Adults Need To Set Example |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 2010-10-28|accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
===The Trevor Project===
"[[The Trevor Project]] was founded by director/producer Peggy Rajski, producer [[Randy Stone]] and screenwriter James Lecesne, creators of the 1994 Academy Award-winning short film, ''[[Trevor (film)|Trevor]]'', a comedy/drama about a gay 13-year-old boy who, when rejected by friends because of his sexuality, makes an attempt to take his life."&lt;ref name="About Trevor"&gt;[http://www.thetrevorproject.org/about-trevor/organization About Trevor] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020135304/http://www.thetrevorproject.org/about-trevor/organization |date=October 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are an American non-profit organization that operates the only nationwide, around-the-clock crisis and suicide prevention helpline for LGBT youth, the project "is determined to end suicide among LGBTQ youth by providing life-saving and life-affirming resources including our nationwide, 24/7 crisis intervention lifeline, digital community and advocacy/educational programs that create a safe, supportive and positive environment for everyone."&lt;ref name="About Trevor"/&gt;

In 2017 news emerged of a study that found that asking youth to accept negative experiences as the only coping strategy, potentially exacerbates stress. This study from the University of Arizona, led to claims that the It Gets Better Project may do more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newnownext.com/it-gets-better-study/05/2017/|title="It Gets Better" Is Bad Advice For Gay Kids, Study Claims|date=2017-05-15|author=Avery, Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy responses==
A number of policy options have been repeatedly proposed to address this issue. Some advocate intervention at the stage in which youth are already suicidal (such as crisis hotlines), while others advocate programs directed at increasing LGBT youth access to factors found to be "protective" against suicide (such as social support networks or mentors).

One proposed option is to provide LGBT-sensitivity and anti-bullying training to current middle and high school counselors and teachers. Citing a study by Jordan et al., school psychologist Anastasia Hansen notes that hearing teachers make homophobic remarks or fail to intervene when students make such remarks are both positively correlated with negative feelings about an LGBT identity&lt;ref name="eric.ed.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov:80/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ776677&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ776677 |title=Hansen, Anastasia. "School-Based Support for GLBT Students: A Review of Three Levels of Research." ''Psychology in the Schools.'' 44.8(2007). 839-848 |publisher=Eric.ed.gov:80 |accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Conversely, a number of researchers have found the presence of LGBT-supportive school staff to be related to "positive outcomes for LGBT youth".&lt;ref name="eric.ed.gov" /&gt; Citing a 2006 Psychology in the Schools report, The Trevor Project notes that "lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and questioning (LGBTQ) youth who believe they have just one school staff member with whom they can talk about problems are only 1/3 as likely as those without that support to... report making multiple suicide attempts in the past year."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.thetrevorproject.org/sites/default/files/educatorresourceguide.pdf |title=EDUCATOR RESOURCE GUIDE  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807234654/http://www.thetrevorproject.org/sites/default/files/educatorresourceguide.pdf |archive-date=August 7, 2012|publisher=The Trevor Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another frequently proposed policy option involves providing grant incentives for schools to create and/or support Gay-Straight Alliances, student groups dedicated to providing a social support network for LGBT students. Kosciw and Diaz, researchers for the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Education Network, found in a nationwide survey that "students in schools with a GSA were less likely to feel unsafe, less likely to miss school, and more likely to feel that they belonged at their school than students in schools with no such clubs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glsen.org/binary-data/GLSEN_ATTACHMENTS/file/585-1.pdf |title=2005 NSCS Final v6.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-08-21|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618161552/http://www.glsen.org/binary-data/GLSEN_ATTACHMENTS/file/585-1.pdf|archivedate=2006-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Studies have shown that social isolation and [[marginalization]] at school are psychologically damaging to LGBT students, and that GSAs and other similar peer-support group can be effective providers of this "[[psychosocial recovery|psychosocial support]]".&lt;ref name="eric.ed.gov"/&gt;

===Early interventions for LGBT youth===
====Be proactive and understanding====
Educators can be proactive in helping adolescents with gender identity and the questions/ issues that sometimes come that can help teens so that they do not resort to suicide, drug abuse, homelessness, and many psychological problems.  Van Wormer &amp; McKinney (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Van Wormer | first1 = K | last2 = McKinney | first2 = R | year = 2003 | title = What schools can do to help gay/lesbian/bisexual youth: A harm reduction approach | url = | journal = Adolescence | volume = 38 | issue = 151| pages = 409–420 }}&lt;/ref&gt; relate that understanding LBGT students is the first step to suicide prevention.  They use a harm reduction approach, which meets students where they are to reduce any continued harm linked with their behaviors.  They relate that creating a supportive and culturally diverse environment is crucial to social acceptance in an educational setting.

====LGBT role models/resources====
It is beneficial to hire LGBT teachers to serve as role models and support LGBT students. Many of the resources in the U.S. are crisis driven not prevention driven which needs to be the other way around in order to prevent suicide for LGBT adolescents.  Furthermore, studies show that counselors and teachers need to be trained in self-awareness, sexuality and [[sexual diversity]] with themselves and with students.  Researchers also suggest inviting gay/lesbian and bisexual panels from colleges or universities to conduct classroom discussions.  Education and resources is key to helping LGBT students and families. According to researcher [[Rob Cover]], role models and resources benefit LGBT youth only if they avoid replicating stereotypes and provide diverse visual and narrative representations to allow broad identification.&lt;ref&gt;Cover, Rob. (2012). Queer Youth Suicide, Culture and Identity: Unliveable Lives? Ashgate, {{ISBN|9781409444473}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having a PFLAG (Parents Families, and Friends of Lesbians and Gays) and GSA Club are possible resources to promote discussions and leadership roles to LGBT students.  These resources extend outside of school and in the community.  (Greytak, E. A., Kosciw, J. G., &amp; Boesen, M. J. 2013) report that when schools have a GSA or Gay Straight Alliance club or a club promoting social awareness and camaraderie of sorts, supportive educators, inclusive curricula, and comprehensive policies that LGBT students were victimized less and had more positive school experiences. Students will feel positive and want to be in school.

====Teach tolerance and examine a school's climate====
Examine a school's climate and teach tolerance – Teaching Tolerance is a movement, magazine and website which gives many tools and ideas to help people be tolerant of one another.  It demonstrates that the classroom is a reflection of the world around us.  Educators can use Teach Tolerance's website and book to download resources and look up creative ways to learn more about LBGT students and teaching tolerance to their students in the classroom.  It helps schools get started with anti-bullying training and professional development and resource suggestions.  It even relates common roadblocks and tips to starting a GSA club.

Research shows that a collaborative effort must be made in order to prevent LGBT students from being bullied and/or committing suicide.  Teachers, administrators, students, families, and communities need to come together to help LGBT students be confident.  Each school has its own individuality, its own sense of "self", whether it be the teachers, administrators, students, or the surrounding community.  In order to tackle the issue of bullying for LGBT students it needs to start with understanding the student population and demographic where the school lies. Educating students, faculty, staff, and school boards on LGBT issues and eliminating homophobia and trans phobia in schools, training staff on diversity acceptance and bullying prevention, and implementing Gay-Straight Alliances is key to suicide prevention for LGBT students (Bacon, Laura Ann 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Bacon, Laura Ann, "A Study of Effective Strategies, Programs, and Policies for School Leaders in Protecting Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Youth from Peer Victimization" (2011). Electronic Theses &amp; Dissertations. Paper 380.&lt;/ref&gt;  Adolescents grow and are shaped by many factors including internal and external features (Swearer, Espelage, Vaillancourt, &amp; Hymel, 2010).

The school climate must foster respect. Thus, setting the tone for administration, teachers, professionals who enter the building, parents and most importantly the students.  People, in general, need to understand their own misconceptions and stereotypes of what being LGBT is. Unless students and adults are educated on the LGBT community, than stereotypes and negative attitudes will continue to exist (Knotts, G., &amp; Gregorio, D. 2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Knotts | first1 = G. | last2 = Gregorio | first2 = D. | year = 2011 | title = Confronting homophobia at school: High school students and the gay men's chorus of Los Angeles | url = | journal = Journal of LGBT Youth | volume = 8 | issue = 1| pages = 66–83 | doi=10.1080/19361653.2011.519193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The GMCLA (Gay Men's Chorus of Los Angeles) use music and singing as a vehicle for changing the attitudes and hearts of people in schools nationwide.  Their goal is to bring music to standards-driven curriculum to youth with the purpose of teaching content in innovative and meaningful ways.  They instill in students and staff techniques to foster positive meaning of the social and personal issues dealt with in school and society.

Gay, L. (2009) has generated a guide to helping school safety/climate and fostering positive interpersonal relationships through "The Safe Space Kit".&lt;ref&gt;Gay, L. (2009). The Safe Space Kit: Guide to Being an Ally to LGBT Students. Gay, Lesbian And Straight Education Network (GLSEN)&lt;/ref&gt;  This tool helps teachers create a safe space for LGBT students.  One of the most effective ways for an educator to create a safe space is to be a supportive ally to LGBT students.  This kit has numerous tools for teachers and schools to utilize, including: a hard copy of "The Safe Space Kit" includes the "Guide to Being an Ally", stickers and two Safe Space posters.  Even utilizing something just to promote awareness, such as using "The Safe Space Kit" could be a good first step for schools to promote responsiveness to LGBT students.  Providing some supports rather than none at all can benefit LGBT youth tremendously now and in the future (Greytak, et al. 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Greytak | first1 = E. A. | last2 = Kosciw | first2 = J. G. | last3 = Boesen | first3 = M. J. | year = 2013 | title = Putting the "T" in "Resource": The Benefits of LGBT-Related School Resources for Transgender Youth | url = | journal = Journal of LGBT Youth | volume = 10 | issue = 1–2| pages = 45–63 | doi=10.1080/19361653.2012.718522}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====OBPP (Olweus Bullying Prevention Program)====
OBPP is an anti-bullying program designed by psychologist [[Dan Olweus]] utilized in schools in Europe, Canada and the U.S. Reductions in bullying were due to parent training, playground supervision, home-school communication, classroom rules, and training videos.  Furthermore, Swearer, et al. (2010) discuss a "dosage effect" in which the more positive and consistent elements included in a program, the more the likelihood that bullying would decrease.  Success in one school does not guarantee success in another because each school has its own social climate.  The OBPP is effective but still needs to be analyzed further, since there are many things to consider when implementing this technique within a large school.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

====Steps To Respect====
Steps To Respect is an anti-bullying campaign which can be beneficial in schools as well – it is a comprehensive guide for teachers, administrators, and students utilizing in class lessons and training helping schools foster positive social-emotional skills and conflict resolution.  If schools are able to change peer conduct and norms, increase student communication skills, and maintain adult prevention and intervention efforts, the positive effects of their work will strengthen over time (Frey, Edstrom &amp; Hirschstein 2005)&lt;ref&gt;Steps to Respect (Frey, Edstrom and Hirschstein 2005; Frey et al. 2005; Hirschtein et al. 20070; category 6&lt;/ref&gt; and continue to grow as each class progresses through the school system.

====Make curriculum changes====
According to Russell, S. T., McGuire, J. K., Laub, C., &amp; Manke, E. (2006),&lt;ref name="Russel 2006"&gt;Russell, S. T., McGuire, J. K., Laub, C., &amp; Manke, E. (2006). LGBT Student Safety: Steps Schools Can Take.(California Safe Schools Coalition Research Brief No. 3) San Francisco, CA: California Safe Schools Coalition&lt;/ref&gt; it is imperative for educators to make subject and age appropriate lessons with LGBT issues incorporated into the curriculum on a consistent basis utilizing current events, history, literature, or social sciences. Teachers should be trained each year on new practices to employ in their classrooms and in school in general.  They should be taught how to handle situations they may face with LGBT students, so that if a problem should arise, they will be confident in their own understandings of the LGBT community and know how to handle any question or situation professionally and empathetically.  Russell, et al. (2006) report that state policy and government officials need to be mindful of the ever-changing culture we live in by enforcing and including material appropriate in schools to educate educators on LGBT people in the world.&lt;ref name="Russel 2006"/&gt;

Burdge, H., Sinclair, K., Laub, C., Russell, S. T. (2012)&lt;ref&gt;Burdge, H., Sinclair, K., Laub, C., Russell, S. T. (2012). Lessons That Matter: LGBTQ Inclusivity and School Safety. (GayStraight Alliance Network and California Safe Schools Coalition Research Brief No. 14). San Francisco, CA: Gay-Straight Alliance Network.&lt;/ref&gt; relate numerous lessons, which each subject area teacher can teach to enforce LGBT inclusivity and school safety.  They report that lessons, which promote LGBT inclusivity, can have the greatest impact on school safety. Physical education, health, history, and social studies teachers can educate all students to have more social awareness and create a positive school climate.  They continue to note that inviting parents, teachers, administrators and other key stakeholders to identify and/or participate in the development of age-appropriate LGBT-inclusive lessons that teachers can use in their classrooms is most beneficial.

Educators must continue to try new trends, constantly assessing the environment of their school.  The best policies and interventions are those, which show positive growth across grade levels.  Research should continue to see which programs suit the needs of different schools over a period of time.  Since each school varies in many ways, it may be hard to report positive trends.  One technique that works in one school may or may not work for another. Therefore, taking pieces of one technique and making it into something that molds best to each school and environment is key.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

At the [[University of Cambridge]], a '''Tripos''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-tripos.ogg|ˈ|t|r|aɪ|p|ɒ|s}}, plural 'Triposes') is any of the undergraduate examinations that qualify an undergraduate for a [[bachelor's degree]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jargon &amp;#124; Queens' College|url=http://www.queens.cam.ac.uk/life-at-queens/about-the-college/university/the-jargon|website=Queens' College, Cambridge|accessdate=6 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the courses taken by an undergraduate to prepare. For example, an undergraduate studying mathematics is said to be reading for the ''[[Mathematical Tripos]]'', whilst a student of English literature is reading for the ''English Tripos''. 

In most traditional English universities, a student registers to study one field exclusively, rather than having "majors" or "minors" as in [[Universities in the United States|American]], [[Higher education in Australia|Australian]], [[Higher education in Canada|Canadian]], or [[Universities in Scotland|Scottish universities]]. In practice, however, most degrees may be fairly interdisciplinary in nature, depending on the subject. The multi-part tripos system at Cambridge also allows substantial changes in field between parts; the [[Natural Sciences Tripos]] is especially designed to allow a highly flexible curriculum across the sciences.

==Etymology==

The word has an obscure [[etymology]], but may be traced to the three-legged stool candidates once used to sit on when taking oral examinations (see ''[[Tripod#Etymology|tripod]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.study.cam.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/structure.html|title=Structure of our courses|publisher=University of Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; An apocryphal legend says that students used to receive one leg of a stool in each of their three years of exams, receiving the whole stool at graduation. Another tradition holds that the name derives from the three brackets printed on the back of the voucher.&lt;ref&gt;"Essay on Triposes" in ''The Classical Journal,'' Volume 13; p. 83; No. XXV, March 1816.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation not found}}

==History==
Initially, the only way to obtain an honours degree at Cambridge was the Mathematical Tripos examination.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} Although [[John Jebb (1736–1786)|John Jebb]] proposed reforms in 1772, but implementation was blocked by various matters such as lack of expertise in the smaller colleges in a wider range of subjects. Classed examinations in law were introduced in 1816 by [[James William Geldart]], who was then [[Regius Professor of Civil Law (Cambridge)|Regius Professor of Civil Law]]. Although a classical tripos was created in 1822, it was only open to those who already had high honours in mathematics or those who were the sons of [[Peerage|peers]]. This restriction ended around 1850, and triposes in the moral sciences and natural sciences were introduced in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Smith, Jonathan C. |title=Teaching and learning in nineteenth-century Cambridge |publisher=Boydell Press |location=Ipswich |year=2002 |pages=207–208 |isbn=0-85115-783-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin and evolution of the Cambridge Tripos can be found in William Clark's ''Academic Charisma and the Origin of the Research University''.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, William (2006). ''Academic Charisma and the Origin of the Research University'', chapter 4, [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
[[File:Mathmo results.jpg|thumb|[[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Mathematical tripos]] results are read out inside [[Senate House (University of Cambridge)|Senate House]] and then tossed from the balcony.]]

A tripos is divided into two parts: ''Part I'', which is broadly based, and ''Part II'', which allows specialization within the student's chosen field. Since a [[bachelor's degree]] usually takes three years to complete, either Part I or Part II is two years, and the other one year. The details of this can vary from subject to subject. There is also an optional Part III offered in some subjects, such as the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos|Mathematical Tripos]]; these are not required to complete a bachelor's degree. Some ''Part III'' courses allow the student to graduate with both a [[master's degree]] and a bachelor's degree: for example, scientific Part III courses allow the student to graduate with an M.Sci. degree in addition to the B.A. degree which all Cambridge graduates receive. The Engineering Tripos on the other hand is divided into Parts IA (spoken as: "''One A''"), IB ("''One B''"), IIA ("''Two A''"), and IIB ("''Two B''"), each corresponding to one academic year, and leads to the simultaneous awarding of the B.A. and M.Eng. degrees.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}

Students are [[Test (assessment)|examined]] formally at the end of each part and are awarded a degree classification for each part. The Part II classification is usually, but incorrectly, considered to be the classification for the overall degree. Most subjects are examined in all three years; for example, the [[Natural Sciences Tripos]] has examinations for Part IA, Part IB, Part II, and in some subjects, Part III. The English and History Triposes have preliminary rather than full examinations at the end of the first year.

Degree regulations state that, to be awarded a degree, a student must have passed two honours examinations (i.e., two Tripos examinations) – this could include a Part I and a Part II, two Part I exams, or (in some cases) a Part I and a Part IA. From October 2011, students can only be awarded an [[British undergraduate degree classification|honours degree]] if they have been awarded honours in a Part II or Part III examination;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Report of the Council and the General Board on the requirements for the B.A. Degree by Honours|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2008-09/weekly/6158/17.html|work=Cambridge University Reporter, Thursday 23 July 2009|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of Part I examinations will allow a student to graduate with an [[British undergraduate degree classification|Ordinary degree]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joint Report of the Council and the General Board on the future of Ordinary Examinations and the Ordinary B.A. Degree|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2010-11/weekly/6204/section7.shtml|work=Cambridge University Reporter, Wednesday 24 November 2010|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; All students must complete at least nine terms of residence (three years of study) – making it impossible for students to simply complete two one-year tripos parts. This makes it easy for an undergraduate to switch out of a subject. So a one-year Part I (or Part IA) must be followed by a two-year Part II, and usually vice versa. More exotic combinations are possible, with the permission of the student's college and prospective department, but some combinations create a four-year bachelor's degree. A few subjects – e.g. Management Studies, and Linguistics (prior to October 2010) – exist only as Part II, and can be preceded by any manner of Part I subject.

Students who already possess a bachelor's degree or equivalent from another university are generally permitted to skip Part I, and thus can complete a Cambridge bachelor's degree in two years or less. Students already holding a BA degree from Cambridge are not permitted to collect a second BA from the University.

A student requesting to graduate (technically, 'admitted to a degree') is assessed mainly on two criteria: not only the Triposes they have completed (requirements laid by the statues and ordinance of Cambridge), as recorded in the Cambridge University Reporter (Cambridge's [[gazette]] newspaper), but also the number of terms kept (at least nine required for a BA; 10 for an undergraduate master's degree). A student's requests to graduate should also be approved by their college, and be unopposed by the regent house, one of the university's governing bodies with vetoing powers.

[[Mónica Farro]] and [[Adabel Guerrero]] both were competitors in the fifth season as well, they finished at eighth place (Farro) and sixth place (Guerrero).

Archimó had a special participation in "[[El Musical de tus Sueños]]" in 2009 dancing on [[Stripper pole|doble stripper pole]]s alongside [[Mónica Farro]] opening up for the special edition re-entry gala (in which Guerrero entered).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremista.com.ar/46329/valeria-archimo-y-monica-farro-en-el-doble-cano/|title=Valeria Archimó y Mónica Farro en el Doble Caño|date=November 18, 2009|accessdate=January 12, 2013|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|singing teachers|other topic|Voice teacher (disambiguation) }}

A '''voice teacher'''  or '''singing teacher''' is a musical instructor who assists adults and children in the development of their abilities in singing.&lt;ref&gt;See the dictionary definitions of both "voice" and "teacher"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical work==
A voice teacher works with a student singer to improve the various skills involved in singing.&lt;ref&gt;For more complete and detailed examples of the topics involved in this work, refer to the various books on [[Voice pedagogy]], such as Vennard, "Singing: the Mechanism and the Technic" and Miller, ''The Structure of Singing''.&lt;/ref&gt;

These skills include breath control and support,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, chapters 1 and 2; Vennard, chapter 2&lt;/ref&gt; tone production and resonance,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, chapters 6 and 7; Vennard, chapter 5&lt;/ref&gt; pitch control and musical intonation, proper formation of vowels and consonants as well as clarity of words,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, chapters 5 and 10; Vennard, chapters 6 and 7&lt;/ref&gt; blending the various high and low ranges of a voice (called "registration"),&lt;ref&gt;Miller, chapters 9 and 10; Vennard, chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; as well as attentiveness to musical notation and phrasing, and the learning of songs.  The voice teacher might operate in a private studio or be affiliated with a college or university [[Faculty (academic staff)|faculty]].

==Roles==
Students usually start vocal instruction after their voices have settled in later teen years.  Part of the job of any voice teacher is to know a student’s vocal characteristics sufficiently well to identify their [[voice type]]. Women are usually classified in one of three categories: [[soprano]], [[mezzo-soprano]], and [[contralto]]. Men's voices are divided into four categories: [[countertenor]], [[tenor]], [[baritone]], and [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]]. However, more mature and experienced singers who have completed their professional training can usually benefit from ongoing vocal instruction.  At this point it is often referred to as [[vocal coach]]ing.  A vocal coach may help a student to learn new repertoire or assist the student to learn diction in different languages.&lt;ref&gt;For more information, refer to the separate article on [[Vocal coach]].&lt;/ref&gt; Vocal coaches may also help vocalists to improve their [[singing]] technique, take care of and develop their voice, and prepare for the performance of a song or other work.

==Training and experience==
The training and education of singing teachers varies widely.&lt;ref&gt;For more on the professional training of voice teachers, see Section Three of Blades-Zeller, ''A Spectrum of Voices'', pp. 195–231&lt;/ref&gt;  Teachers are generally trained in ''[[vocal pedagogy]]'', the study of the teaching of singing.   Some voice teachers are members of professional associations such as the [[National Association of Teachers of Singing]] or NATS. Some singing teachers have extensive formal training, such as a Bachelor's in Music, a Master's in Music, a Conservatory diploma, or degrees in related areas, such as foreign languages, or diplomas in human kinetics, posture techniques, or breathing methods. Several American universities now offer graduate degrees in vocal pedagogy.  Programs at smaller colleges include [[The Boston Conservatory]], the music conservatory at [[Shenandoah University]], and [[Westminster Choir College]], and there are programs as several large universities, such as [[Arizona State University]], the [[University of North Texas]], [[The Ohio State University]], and the [[University of Iowa]].

On the other hand, some singing teachers may have little formal training, and so they rely on their extensive experience as a performer. For example, some singers had decades of solo stage experience prior to becoming singing teachers, in recitals, oratorios, operas, operettas, or musical theater.     

Singing teachers may also come to their profession through related musical professions. Some singing teachers began as rehearsal pianists and they gained decades of experience accompanying singers in different styles. As well, some singing teachers learn their craft by starting as choral, music theater, or symphony conductors. 

The singing teacher field is competitive, especially at the highest professional levels. Salaries vary greatly, as do the conditions of work. While a small number of top singing teachers can command very high hourly or daily rates, most singing teachers, like most other music and arts professionals, tend to have salaries which are below the average for other professions which require a similar amount of education and experience, such as economists or bank managers.  The work conditions vary widely, from part-time or occasional freelance work teaching individual singers, to full-time contracts or multi-year jobs for universities teaching vocal performance students.

'''Etudes Sans Frontières International''' (commonly known as '''ESFI''' and '''Studies Without Borders International''') is the international federation of existing chapters and members that adhere to the values, objectives, methods, statute and internal rules of the Etudes Sans Frontières movement (ESF), in order to be able to carry the name Etudes Sans Frontières. The federation is registered in Paris as a non-profit organization (Loi 1901), which relies on international volunteers to help develop its programs.
 
The aim of ESFI is to improve access for young adults from crisis regions to higher education and targeted practical qualifications – which otherwise would not be accessible to them because of the situation in their country – so as to enhance their willingness and capability to commit themselves to the (re-)construction of a peaceful, free and fair society in their home country.

==Crisis regions==
This term refers to any national or sub-national area worldwide whose population faces violent conflict, post-conflict challenges, severe political oppression, a failed state situation, extreme poverty or environmental disasters, leading to severely restricted access to higher education or a severely reduced capacity of the higher education system.

==Current programs==
Currently ESFI has higher education programs implying students from [[Rwanda]], [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], [[Haiti]], [[Chechnya]] and [[Afghanistan]]. Whenever possible, ESFI helps these students study in their home countries by offering full scholarship programs that cover living and study expenses.

ESFI also helps advance education facilities in crisis regions, develops e-learning, internship programs wherever possible and networking and offers capacity-building workshops to its members. All ESFI activities are meant to enhance sustainable development and peace by supporting motivated individuals to engage in meaningful positive change in their region.

==Peculiarity of ESFI scholarships abroad==
Students who are offered grants to study outside of their home country (in [[Europe]] and [[North America]] for example) are carefully selected with reference to their academic performance, motivation, language skills, capacity to adapt to Western systems of higher education and most of all on their «return project» (i.e. in what way concretely they hope to make use of the new skills and capabilities they have mastered with their studies abroad). They are requested to honour a formal agreement – they have signed and sent before leaving for their studies abroad – to return to their home country once they have completed their studies and requirements of their bursary.

==Public awareness==
ESFI also aims to raise worldwide public awareness and solidarity on situations prevailing in crisis regions from which their scholarship students come, by the organization of public information activities, conferences, debates, film presentations, etc. and fundraising events.

Its network of volunteer is made up mostly of university students, employees and retirees from academic executive jobs, but its donators come from every walk of life. Volunteers and donators offer their skills and experience to support the movement and the organization and create a solid international network, since its beginning.

==Shared values==
All ESFI members and persons who benefit from activities carried out in the name of Etudes Sans Frontières are requested to respect and promote these values:
international, intercultural and intergenerational solidarity;
*peace and non-violence;
*fundamental human rights as specified in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights;
*transparency, impartiality and fairness.
ESFI is based on the belief that these values are universal and that their origin cannot be claimed by any particular culture or society. At the same time, it acknowledges and respects the rich cultural diversity of human societies.

==History==
The first chapter of Etudes Sans Frontières that started the international movement was founded as a [[non profit organization]] in 2003 in [[Paris]] by students and members of the French civil society. It emerged as the [[second Chechen war]] was raging in the [[Caucasus]] and students from the [[Grozny University]] lost numerous professors to the war and bombs destroyed part of their university building and library.

A handful of French students with the help of many volunteers troubled by the terrible situation these students had to endure to acquire an education started the movement by welcoming to Paris a first cohort of 9 students in 2003 – 21 Chechen students were offered bursaries over a period of six years afterwards – who completed studies in such diverse disciplines as [[journalism]], [[sociology]], [[psychology]], [[political science]], [[architecture]], [[Business administration|administration]], [[fashion]], [[languages]], etc.

The French chapter also helped Rwandan orphans to resume their studies in Rwanda after the genocide of 1994 and the following years of chaos. The impetus gained in the community by the implication of these young students prompted the local authorities to install electricity in the village, which radically changed the life of the people.

The movement started by Etudes Sans Frontières in France rapidly picked up momentum when renowned international public figures such as Bronislaw Geremek, André Glucksman, Elena Bonner, Youri Afanassief, Pascal Bruckner, Jack Lang, Pierre Hassner, Pierre Lellouche, Josep Ramoneda, Jacques Rupnik, Walter Veltroni and many others helped secure funds to offer grants to Chechen students. The president of this prestigious Honours Committee was the no less respected dissident playwright and first president of the Czech Republic, [[Vaclav Havel]], now deceased (2011).&lt;ref&gt;Konstantin Riffler. "[http://www.zeit.de/campus/online/2008/32/austausch-grosnyi Aus der Hölle nach Paris]", ''[[Die Zeit]]'', 25 August 2008. Retrieved 10 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapters develop in Europe and North America
The international success obtained by the French founding chapter rapidly branched out in Europe and North America with chapters opening up in [[Belgium]] (2005), [[Québec]], [[Canada]] (July 2006), [[Germany]] (October 2006), [[Italy]] (December 2006), [[Spain]] (April 2007), [[Norway]] (2007).

Since most European chapters were initiated by very active and motivated students, some have been short-lived when these have left the university after graduation to settle in life. Some of these chapters have become «dormant chapters» which can be revived anytime by new teams, with new ideas and projects.

On the other hand, well-grounded active chapter can decide to extend their range of activities by opening new branches in other cities and universities of their region or country.

The German chapter (SOG) – Studieren Ohne Grenzen – is the most extensive of the ESF movement with more than 1,000 members active in a dozen German cities and universities. Since its opening in 2006, it has developed very important scholarship program for students in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] registered in different programs at UNIKIND ([[University of Kindu]] located in Maniema State in the Eastern part of the country) where they also have plans to develop a computer room and build a library with the help of local organizations.

SOG is also involved with the Institut Supérieur d’Études agronomiques in [[Mweso]] where it sponsors 64 students who study with scholarships to become qualified agronomists with the intent of helping to alleviate poverty and hunger.

SOG has also offered Chechen students full scholarships to acquire a university diploma in Germany, including preparatory language courses. These students benefit from intensive mentoring and support throughout their stay in Germany. During their studies in Germany they prepare a project which aims to support the development of their home country’s society and culture that will be implemented after their graduation.

A new project developing in [[Afghanistan]] with the collaboration of the [[Herat University]] will enable carefully selected young people to take up studies in all kinds of academic fields. The Afghan people have suffered the direct and indirect outcomes of 30 continuous years of war on their soil. After the overturn of the Taliban regime no sustainable future was established for the younger generation which makes the bulk of the Afghan people. True to its motto: "Education is the most powerful weapon we have to change the world." ([[Nelson Mandela]]), SOG wants to extend a hand to talented Afghan students.

===Canada===

The Canadian chapter (ESF-Qc) – Études sans frontières, section [[Québec]] – the only chapter founded outside Europe by university employees in 2006 [with the help of [[Université du Québec à Montréal]] - UQAM] has focused on two crisis region, Rwanda and Haiti, after having tried for two years without success to sponsor two Chechen students from the capital Grozny.

It has helped so far a Rwandan student and mother complete a master's degree in clinical psychology (2009-2013). It is currently sponsoring a Haitian student who studies to acquire a master's degree in Computer science applied to Management, who has plans to help modernize the public Archives in [[Haiti]] upon his return to his home country. ESF-Qc has already made contact with [[Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec]] (BAnQ) in order to select an internship and mentoring program concurrent to this student’ studies in [[Montréal]].
 
ESF-Qc has also sponsored two Congolese students for two years in collaboration with the German project operating in UNIKIND ([[University of Kindu]]) in the Democratic Republic of Congo.

The Canadian chapter has projects in 2013-2014 to extend its activities to two other francophone universities in the province of [[Québec]] and to sponsor more students from crisis regions. It is running a major fundraising operation in the Montreal university community and civil society.

===France===

The French chapter who started the ESF movement in 2003 has been completing on-going projects these last years with very few members but very dedicated and loyal donors who have been supporting the organization since the beginning.

An especially talented Chechen student who arrived in France in 2007 has been able to complete an undergraduate program in Political science at the high profile «[[Sciences Po]]» – L'Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris – and then registered for a master's degree in European Affairs which she should complete in 2013. She is the last student of a program which helped more than 20 students to complete university degrees in France from Chechnya.

The French chapter is also pursuing the Kimironko project started in 2006 with the help of ESF-Italy, which has offered 12 scholarships to orphans of all ages living together on a hill near Kigali in order to take care of each other without the help of their parents killed in the 1994 genocide. Six graduated in 2012 and three others study in programs of Finance, Administration and International Relations in Rwanda. The Rwandan project is due to end in 2014 with lasting success for the many students who completed their high school, college or university studies.10

In 2013 ESF France is planning to finance a 3 to 6 months training program in French for its former pivot person in Chechnya. In addition it keeps contact with former beneficiaries and helps them with non-financial or financial matters related to their professional projects based on their specific needs. With no more than 3 members left from the initial team, the French chapter will mutate to «dormant» status in 2014 unless it is revived by a new team.
