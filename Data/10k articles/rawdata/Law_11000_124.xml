The '''1975 Constitution of the People's Republic of China''' was promulgated in the midst of the unrest of the [[Cultural Revolution]] by the [[4th National People's Congress]]. The offices of [[President of the People's Republic of China|President]] and [[Vice President of the People's Republic of China|Vice-President]] were officially scrapped under the Constitution.

This Constitution reduced the total number of articles to just around thirty, compared to 106 of articles in the [[1954 Constitution of the People's Republic of China]].

Consistent with the time it was issued, the flavour of the Cultural Revolution is quite visible. The Preamble ends with a slogan to struggle for new successes. Language such as "[[dictatorship of the proletariat]]", "[[social imperialism]]" and "[[proletarian internationalism]]" appears in many places in the document.

[[Individual rights]], such as the rights of [[freedom of speech]], are guaranteed, but only to those loyal to the [[Communist Party of China]].

The 1975 Constitution witnessed an integration (in part) of the State Constitution (the [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China|PRC Constitution]]) and the Chinese Communist Party. The Constitution states that the [[People's Liberation Army]], the armed services of the PRC, is to be controlled by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]] and [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China]]. Such linkage between party and state would no longer be seen in later Constitutions, particularly after 1982. The most significant link, however, came in Article 2, which stated that the Chinese Communist Party was the leading force of the Chinese people.

Looking back on the 1975 Constitution, books in mainland China call it "a socialist Constitution with serious errors." This Constitution was superseded in 1978 by the [[1978 Constitution of the People's Republic of China]]. It remained in effect for about three years, the shortest-lived constitution in the People's Republic of China's history.

'''Ballot Measure 9''' was a [[initiative|ballot measure]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Oregon]] in [[1992 in the United States|1992]], concerning [[gay rights]], pedophilia, sadism, masochism, and [[public education]], that drew widespread national attention.

Measure 9 would have added the following text to the [[Oregon Constitution]]:

{{quote|All governments in Oregon may not use their monies or properties to promote, encourage or facilitate [[homosexuality]], [[pedophilia]], [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]] or masochism. All levels of government, including [[public education]] systems, must assist in setting a standard for Oregon's youth which recognizes that these behaviors are abnormal, wrong, unnatural and perverse and they are to be discouraged and avoided.}}

It was defeated in the November 3, 1992 [[general election]] with 638,527 votes in favor, 828,290 votes against.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sos.oregon.gov/blue-book/Documents/elections/initiative.pdf Oregon Blue Book: Initiative, Referendum and Recall: 1902-2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political context ==
The ballot measure was an effort of the [[Oregon Citizens Alliance]] (OCA), a conservative group active in Oregon politics in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="wweekanniv"&gt;{{cite news
|last=Wentz
|first=Patty
|title=Homophopia hits home
|url=http://www.wweek.com/html/25-1992.html#oca
|work=Willamette Week
|accessdate=2007-05-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the measure felt that their traditional values were under siege in the face of growing acceptance of [[homosexuality]] by society.&lt;ref&gt;del Mar, David Peterson. ''Oregon's Promise: An Interpretive History''. Oregon State University Press (2003) p. 264-265.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents stated that the measure was unfairly discriminatory, that it was unconstitutional, and that it demonstrated the [[homophobia]] and bigotry of its backers. Republican Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] opposed the measure, as did most Oregon newspapers. Opponents outspent the OCA six to one.&lt;ref name=delMar265&gt;del Mar, David Peterson. ''Oregon's Promise: An Interpretive History''. Oregon State University Press (2003) p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

The OCA would go on to back [[Oregon Ballot Measure 13 (1994)|Measure 13,]] which would have prevented schools from using materials that were deemed to "legitimize homosexuality", and [[Oregon Ballot Measure 19 (1994)|Measure 19]]. They also backed another [[Oregon Ballot Measure 9 (2000)|measure numbered 9]] ("son of 9") in 2000. All these were unsuccessful.

== Lingering effects ==
Although the measure failed, its legacy can still be seen today. The Oregon Citizens Alliance went on to introduce a series of watered-down ballot measures along the same lines as Measure 9 (most of which failed). Another response of the OCA was to place laws similar to Measure 9 on local ballots in the parts of Oregon where a majority of voters had supported Measure 9. They succeeded in this effort in [[Josephine County, Oregon|Josephine]], [[Douglas County, Oregon|Douglas]], [[Linn County, Oregon|Linn]], and [[Klamath County, Oregon|Klamath]] counties, as well as in [[Canby, Oregon|Canby]] and [[Junction City, Oregon|Junction City]]. The state legislature eventually overruled these local measures.&lt;ref name=delMar265/&gt; On the other hand, opposition to Ballot Measure 9 formed the basis of much of the current [[gay rights]] movement in Oregon, including the organization [[Basic Rights Oregon]].&lt;ref name="wweekanniv"/&gt;

'''PARAGRAPH 1.''' The Constitution of the State of Oregon is amended by creating a new section to be added to and made a part of Article I and to read:

'''SECTION 41 (1)''' This state shall not recognize any categorical provision such as "sexual orientation," "sexual preference," and similar phrases that include homosexuality, pedophilia, sadism or masochism. Quotas, minority status, affirmative action, or any similar concepts, shall not apply to these forms of conduct, nor shall government promote these behaviors.

'''(2)''' State, regional and local governments and their properties and monies shall not be used to promote, encourage, or facilitate homosexuality, pedophilia, sadism or masochism.

'''(3)''' State, regional and local governments and their departments, agencies and other entities, including specifically the State Department of Higher Education and the public schools, shall assist in setting a standard for Oregon's youth that recognizes homosexuality, pedophilia, sadism and masochism as abnormal, wrong, unnatural, and perverse and that these behaviors are to be discouraged and avoided.

'''(4)''' It shall be considered that it is the intent of the people in enacting this section that if any part thereof is held unconstitutional, the remaining parts shall be held in force.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.co.benton.or.us/admin/elections/documents/archives/1990s/e92g/e92g_svp.pdf Oregon Voters' Pamphlet, November 3, 1992] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928235731/http://www.co.benton.or.us/admin/elections/documents/archives/1990s/e92g/e92g_svp.pdf |date=September 28, 2011 }}, p. 93, hosted at the [http://www.co.benton.or.us/admin/elections/19901999.php Benton County Elections Division website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918045630/http://www.co.benton.or.us/admin/elections/19901999.php |date=2011-09-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The dissolution was termed as a "coup" by the opposition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Venezuela opposition allege coup as supreme court seizes power |url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/30/venezuela-president-nicolas-maduro-national-assembly |author1 = Jonatham Watts |author2 = Alicia Hernández |work = The Guardian |location = London }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Venezuela opposition calls on military to intervene after 'coup' ruling |url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/03/30/venezuela-supreme-court-takes-over-congress-saying-it-is-in-contempt.html |publisher = Fox News Channel }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.dw.com/en/opinion-coup-in-venezuela/a-38221905 |title = Opinion: Coup in Venezuela |publisher = [[Deutsche Welle]] |date = 30 March 2017 |author = Uta Thofern }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS) termed the action a "[[self-coup]]".&lt;ref name="worldcrunch"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.worldcrunch.com/world-affairs/venezuela39s-chilling-self-coup |title = Venezuela's Chilling "Self-Coup" |work = [[Worldcrunch]] |date = 31 March 2017 |author = Alidad Vassigh }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Venezuela accused of 'self-coup' after Supreme Court shuts down National Assembly |url = http://www.buenosairesherald.com/article/225180/venezuela-accused-of-%E2%80%98selfcoup%E2%80%99-after-supreme-court-shuts-down-national-assembly |accessdate = 1 April 2017 |work = [[Buenos Aires Herald]] |date = 31 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Venezuela's Descent into Dictatorship |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/31/opinion/venezuelas-descent-into-dictatorship.html|accessdate = 1 April 2017 |work = The New York Times |date = 31 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.skynews.com.au/news/world/sthamerica/2017/04/01/venezuela-clashes--self-inflicted-coup---oas.html |title = Venezuela clashes 'self-inflicted coup': OAS |accessdate = 1 April 2017 |publisher = [[Sky News Australia]] |date = 1 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision was condemned by some media outlets with analysts characterizing the move as a turn towards authoritarianism and one-man rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.panorama.com.ve/politicayeconomia/Varios-paises-critican-a-Maduro-acusado-de-dar-Golpe-de-Estado-en-Venezuela-20170331-0010.html |title = Varios países critican a Maduro acusado de dar "Golpe de Estado" en Venezuela |agency = [[Agence-France Presse]] |work = [[Diario Panorama]] |date = 31 March 2017 |language = Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Politicians throughout the Americas, as well as leaders from the United Nations, expressed concern with the decision and demanded its reversal, though the Venezuelan government stated no coup had taken place and instead justified its decision as a reaction to "coup-like actions" allegedly performed by the opposition.&lt;ref name="USnews31"/&gt;

On 1 April 2017, the TSJ reversed its decision, thereby reinstating the powers of the National Assembly.&lt;ref name="USAapril1"/&gt; Public dissatisfaction with the decision persisted however, with the strengthening of [[2017 Venezuelan protests|the protests that year]] "into the most combative since a wave of unrest in 2014" resulting from the crisis.&lt;ref name="ABC17grown"/&gt;

Following the death of President [[Hugo Chávez]], Venezuela faced a severe socioeconomic crisis during the Presidency of his successor, President [[Nicolás Maduro]], as a result of their policies.&lt;ref name=unstable&gt;{{cite news |title = Chavez leaves Venezuelan economy more equal, less stable |author = Kevin Voigt |url = http://edition.cnn.com/2013/03/06/business/venezuela-chavez-oil-economy/ |publisher = CNN |date = 6 March 2013 |accessdate = 6 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FPmarch2013&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Corrales |first1 = Javier |title = The House That Chavez Built |url = https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/03/07/the-house-that-chavez-built/ |accessdate = 6 February 2015 |work = [[Foreign Policy]] |date = 7 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NPRdec2014&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Siegel |first1 = Robert |title = For Venezuela, Drop in Global Oil Prices Could Be Catastrophic |url = https://www.npr.org/2014/12/25/373128433/for-venezuela-drop-in-global-oil-prices-could-be-catastrophic |accessdate = 4 January 2015 |publisher = [[NPR]] |date = 25 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ELPAISfeb2015&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Scharfenberg |first1 = Ewald |title = Volver a ser pobre en Venezuela |url = http://internacional.elpais.com/internacional/2015/01/30/actualidad/1422646346_475356.html |accessdate = 3 February 2015 |work = El Pais |date = 1 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the state's high levels of urban violence, inflation, and [[Shortages in Venezuela|chronic shortages of basic goods]] attributed to economic policies such as strict price controls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2092rank.html |title = Inflation rate (consumer prices) |work = [[The World Factbook]] |accessdate = 26 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.economist.com/node/21526365 |accessdate = 23 February 2014 |title = Venezuela's economy: Medieval policies |work = [[The Economist]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; civil insurrection in Venezuela culminated in the [[2014–17 Venezuelan protests|2014–17 protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Venezuela's Maduro says 2013 annual inflation was 56.2 pct |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/30/venezuela-inflation-annual-idUSL2N0K90V020131230 |accessdate = 19 January 2014 |agency = Reuters |date = 30 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Venezuela Inflation Hits 16-Year High as Shortages Rise |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-11-07/venezuela-inflation-hits-16-year-high-as-shortages-rise.html |accessdate = 16 February 2014 |newspaper = Bloomberg |date = 7 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests occurred over the years, with demonstrations occurring in various intensities depending on the crises Venezuelans were facing at the time and the perceived threat of being repressed by authorities.&lt;ref name=SVCOprotest2&gt;{{cite news |title = En 2014 se registraron 9.286 protestas, cifra inédita en Venezuela |url = http://www.lapatilla.com/site/2015/01/19/en-2014-se-registraron-9-286-protestas-cifra-inedita-en-venezuela/ |accessdate = 25 January 2015 |work = La Patilla |date = 19 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PAPmillion"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Martín |first1 = Karina |title = Despite Government Obstacles, Over a Million Venezuelans March on Caracas |url = https://panampost.com/karina-martin/2016/09/01/despite-government-obstacles-over-a-million-venezuelans-march-on-caracas/ |accessdate = 2 September 2016 |work = [[PanAm Post]] |date = 1 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Thousands March Against Socialist President in Venezuela |url = https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2015/01/24/world/americas/ap-lt-venezuela-protest.html|accessdate = 8 August 2015 |work = [[International New York Times]] |date = 24 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Conflictividad Social en Venezuela en Octubre 2016 |url = https://www.scribd.com/document/331515454/Conflictividad-Social-en-Venezuela-en-Octubre-2016 |publisher = [[Venezuelan Observatory of Social Conflict]] |accessdate = 19 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discontent with the [[Bolivarianism|United Socialist]] Government saw the opposition being elected to hold the majority in the National Assembly for the first time since 1999 following the [[Venezuelan parliamentary election, 2015|2015 Parliamentary Election]].&lt;ref name="NYTmuzzle"/&gt; As a result of that election, the [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] National Assembly consisting of United Socialist officials filled the Venezuelan Supreme Court with allies.&lt;ref name="NYTmuzzle"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Venezuela's Lame-Duck Congress Names New Supreme Court Justices |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-12-23/venezuela-s-lame-duck-congress-names-new-supreme-court-justices |accessdate = 31 March 2017 |work = Bloomberg |date = 23 December 2015 |language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Into early 2016, the Supreme Court alleged that voting irregularities occurred in the 2015 Parliamentary Elections and stripped four Assembly members of their seats, preventing an opposition supermajority in the National Assembly which would be able to challenge President Maduro.&lt;ref name="NYTmuzzle"/&gt; The TSJ court then began to approve of multiple actions performed by Maduro and granted him more powers.&lt;ref name="NYTmuzzle"/&gt;

After facing years of crisis, the Venezuelan opposition pursued a [[Presidency of Nicolás Maduro#Recall referendum|recall referendum against President Maduro]], presenting a petition to the [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]] (CNE) on 2 May 2016.&lt;ref name="BBC_June2016_referendum"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36576771 |title = Venezuela starts validating recall referendum signatures |date = 21 June 2016 |publisher = [[BBC]] |access-date = 8 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By August 2016, the momentum to recall President Maduro appeared to be progressing, with the Council setting a date for the second phase of collecting signatures, though it made the schedule strenuous, stretching the process into 2017 which made it impossible for the opposition to activate new Presidential Elections.&lt;ref name="Reuters_Recall_August2016"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKCN10C3DV |title = Venezuela election board okays opposition recall push first phase |last = Cawthorne |first = Andrew |date = 1 August 2016 |website =  |agency = [[Reuters]] |access-date = 8 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 October 2016, the Council suspended the referendum only days before preliminary signature-gatherings were to be held.&lt;ref name="FOXsuspend"&gt;{{cite news |title = Venezuela Suspends Recall Campaign Against President Maduro |url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/10/20/venezuela-suspends-recall-campaign-against-president-maduro.html |accessdate = 21 October 2016 |publisher = [[Fox News Channel]] |date = 20 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Council blamed alleged voter fraud as the reason for the cancellation of the referendum.&lt;ref name="FOXsuspend"/&gt; International observers criticized the move, stating that CNE's decision made Maduro look as if he were seeking to rule as a dictator.&lt;ref name="LAoct2016"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Mogollon |first1 = Mery |last2 = Kraul |first2 = Chris |title = Anger grows as Venezuela blocks effort to recall president |url = http://www.latimes.com/world/mexico-americas/la-fg-venezuela-recall-tension-20161021-snap-story.html |accessdate = 23 October 2016 |work = [[Los Angeles Times]] |date = 21 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Corrales |first1 = Javier |title = Venezuela's Odd Transition to Dictatorship |url = http://www.americasquarterly.org/content/venezuelas-odd-transition-dictatorship |work = [[Americas Quarterly]] |accessdate = 10 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Brodzinsky |first1 = Sibylla |title = Venezuelans warn of 'dictatorship' after officials block bid to recall Maduro |url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/21/venezuela-president-maduro-recall-referendum |accessdate = 10 December 2016 |work = [[The Guardian]] |location = London |date = 21 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Almagro: Maduro se transforma en dictador por negarles a venezolanos derecho a decidir su futuro |url = http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2016/08/23/almagro-maduro-se-transforma-en-dictador-por-negarle-a-venezolanos-derecho-a-decidir-su-futuro/#0 |accessdate = 10 December 2016 |publisher = [[CNN en Español]] |date = 24 August 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Days after the recall movement was cancelled, 1.2&amp;nbsp;million Venezuelans protested throughout the country against the move, demanding President Maduro to leave office, with Caracas protests remaining calm while protests in other federal states resulted in clashes between demonstrators and authorities, leaving one policeman dead, 120 injured and 147 arrested.&lt;ref name="AMBITO"&gt;{{cite news |title = Con multitudinarias marchas, oposición venezolana presionó a Maduro para que reactive referendo |url = http://www.ambito.com/860181-con-multitudinarias-marchas-oposicion-venezolana-presiono-a-maduro-para-que-reactive-referendo |accessdate = 27 October 2016 |work = [[Ámbito Financiero]] |date = 26 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That day the opposition gave President Maduro a deadline of 3 November 2016 to hold elections, with opposition leader, Miranda Governor [[Henrique Capriles]] stating, "Today we are giving a deadline to the Government. I tell the coward who is in [[Miraflores Palace|Miraflores]] ... that on 3 November the Venezuelan people are coming to Caracas because we are going to Miraflores".&lt;ref name="AMBITO"/&gt;

Days later on 1 November 2016, then National Assembly President and opposition leader [[Henry Ramos Allup]] announced the cancellation of 3 November march to the Miraflores presidential palace, with Vatican-led dialogue between the opposition and the government beginning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Rosati |first1 = Andrew |title = Venezuela Opposition Cancels Protest, Delays Political Trial |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-01/venezuela-opposition-calls-off-protest-delays-political-trial |accessdate = 2 November 2016 |work = Bloomberg |date = 1 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 7 December 2016, dialogue halted between the two&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher = [[Deutsche Welle]] |title = Venezuela's opposition walks away from Vatican-backed talks |url = http://www.dw.com/en/venezuelas-opposition-walks-away-from-vatican-backed-talks/a-36672319 |accessdate = 9 December 2016 |date = 7 December 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and two months later on 13 January 2017 after talks stalled, the Vatican officially pulled out of the dialogue.&lt;ref name="LAHT19jan2017"&gt;{{cite news |title = Latin American Herald Tribune – After Venezuela Government Fails to Honor Commitments, Vatican Pulls Out of Dialogue It Sponsored |url = http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=2429464&amp;CategoryId=10717 |accessdate = 20 January 2017 |work = [[Latin American Herald Tribune]] |date = 19 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further protests were much smaller due to the fear of repression, with the opposition organizing surprise protests instead of organized mass marches.&lt;ref name="WPjan23"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Barbarani |first1 = Sofia |title = Thousands march against Maduro government in Venezuela as crisis deepens |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/thousands-march-against-maduro-government-in-venezuela-as-crisis-deepens/2017/01/23/6151f18e-e180-11e6-a419-eefe8eff0835_story.html |accessdate = 26 January 2017 |work = The Washington Post |date = 23 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other actions by President Maduro and his Bolivarian officials included a 7 February 2017 meeting which announced the creation of the ''Great Socialist Justice Mission'' which had the goal of establishing "a great alliance between the three powers, the judiciary, the citizen and the executive", with Maduro stating that "we have been fortunate to see how the judicial power has been growing and perfecting, carrying a doctrine so complete with the constitution of 1999" while stating that the opposition-led National Assembly "took power not for the majority not for the people but for themselves".&lt;ref name="PANOfeb7"/&gt;

==Events==
===Judicial events===
The Court ruled that the National Assembly was "in a situation of contempt", because of the aforementioned rulings against the election of some of its members. It stripped the Assembly of [[legislature|legislative power]]s, and took those powers for itself; which meant that the Court might have been able to create laws. The court did not indicate if or when it might hand power back.&lt;ref name="alarm"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39449494 |title = Venezuela 'coup': Alarm grows as court takes power |date = 31 March 2017 |publisher = BBC |accessdate = 31 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A statement issued by the court however stated that it would retain the powers of the legislature until the "contempt situation persists and the National Assembly actions are invalidated".&lt;ref name=CNNRomo/&gt; The action transferred powers from the Assembly, which had an opposition majority since January 2016,&lt;ref name="NY_diss1"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Casey |first1 = Nicolas |last2 = Torres |first2 = Patrica |title = Venezuela Moves a Step Closer to One-Man Rule |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/30/world/americas/venezuelas-supreme-court-takes-power-from-legislature.html|accessdate = 30 March 2017 |work = The New York Times |date = 30 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the Supreme Tribunal of Justice, which has a majority of government loyalists.&lt;ref name=CNN_diss&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/30/americas/venezuela-dissolves-national-assembly/ |title = Venezuela's high court dissolves National Assembly |publisher = CNN |date = 30 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling also granted President Maduro the power to suspend elections, imprison opposition deputies and withdraw Venezuela from the [[Organization of American States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Núñez |first1 = Ayatola |title = TSJ autoriza a Maduro a aumentar represión y suspender elecciones |url = http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/politica/tsj-autoriza-maduro-aumentar-represion-suspender-elecciones_87982 |accessdate = 31 March 2017 |work = [[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]] |date = 30 March 2017 |language = es }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The move was denounced by the opposition, with Assembly President [[Julio Borges]] making statements on 30 March describing the action as a coup d'état by President Nicolás Maduro. Borges called on the military to intervene, stating that "they cannot remain silent in the face of the violation of the Constitution" and "that FAN officers are also going through drama caused by the high cost of life. We want to make a call on them to be the first guardians of democracy and the Venezuelan Constitution and that they become part of the solution." Finally, Borges called on international attention to the ruling and called for new protests saying "there is fear, there is repression, but it is time to stand up."&lt;ref name="BORGESfox"&gt;{{cite news |title = Venezuela opposition calls on military to intervene after 'coup' ruling |url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/03/30/venezuela-supreme-court-takes-over-congress-saying-it-is-in-contempt.html |accessdate = 31 March 2017 |publisher = [[Fox News Channel]] |date = 30 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hours later, opposition officials gathered outside of the TSJ headquarters and were attacked by pro-government paramilitary groups called [[Colectivo (Venezuela)|colectivos]] and National Guard troops. Deputy [[Juan Requesens]] was attacked by colectivo forces while Carlos Paparoni was pushed to the concrete by a National Guardsman. A journalist for the National Assembly's broadcast team, [[Asamblea Nacional Televisión|El Capitolio TV]] was struck in the head and required stitches.

In a rare break of ranks, on 31 March 2017, pro-government Attorney General [[Luisa Ortega Díaz]] stated on Venezuelan state television while holding a copy of the [[1999 Venezuelan Constitution|1999 Constitution]] that the TSJ's ruling was a "rupture of constitutional order" and that it was her "duty to inform my country of my deep concern over these events," with her audience responding with a lengthy applause.&lt;ref name=ORTEGAbreak&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Martinez |first1 = Alexander |title = Venezuela president rejects coup claims in crisis |url = https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/34870782/venezuela-attorney-general-breaks-ranks-with-maduro/#page1 |accessdate = 1 April 2017 |agency = Agence France-Presse |date = 31 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Borges, the Assembly President, stated that officials should follow Ortega's example and called on the military "to obey the orders of your conscience."&lt;ref name=ORTEGAbreak/&gt;
Meanwhile, protesters were repressed by the National Guard armed with [[buckshot]] and [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]].&lt;ref name="USnews31"/&gt; Many demonstrators were arrested, with the media being caught in the assault, having their cameras confiscated while one female reporter of [[Caracol Radio]] was singled out by a group of troops and beaten.&lt;ref name="USnews31"/&gt;

On 4 April 2017, opposition called for a march from [[Plaza Venezuela]] to the National Assembly with thousands of Venezuelans participating,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Casey|first1=Nicholas|last2=Torres|first2=Patricia|title=Anti-Government Protests in Venezuela Turn Violent|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/world/americas/venezuela-maduro-protests-supreme-court.html|accessdate=5 April 2017|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; though access to the meeting point was quickly blocked by the [[Bolivarian National Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reportan que GNB restringe accesos a Plaza Venezuela|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/sociedad/reportan-que-gnb-restringe-accesos-plaza-venezuela_88835|publisher=El Nacional|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve subway stations were closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mantienen cerradas 12 estaciones del Metro de Caracas|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/servicios/mantienen-cerradas-estaciones-del-metro-caracas_88831|publisher=El Nacional|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro-government [[Colectivo (Venezuela)|colectivos]] blocked opposition marches and fired weapons at protesters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colectivos disparan contra manifestantes en la autopista Francisco Fajardo|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/politica/colectivos-dispararon-contra-manifestantes-francisco-fajardo_88905|accessdate=5 April 2017|work=[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]|date=4 April 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; with demonstrations resulting in the injuries of about 42 individuals, including seven police officers, while over 50 people were arrested.&lt;ref name=LPapril4&gt;{{cite news|title=Más de 40 heridos dejó represión gubernamental por protestar la ruptura del hilo Constitucional|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/site/2017/04/04/mas-de-40-heridos-dejo-represion-gubernamental-por-protestar-la-ruptura-del-hilo-constitucional/|accessdate=5 April 2017|work=[[La Patilla]]|date=4 April 2017|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reporting the story, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that in the previous few months Maduro had been swiftly consolidating power, and the Assembly was considered by many to be the sole remaining counterbalance to the President's control. It also noted that following such moves by the government, "many now describe as not just an authoritarian regime, but an outright dictatorship."&lt;ref name="NY_diss1"/&gt; [[Fox News]] also noted that following the sporadic protests that did not produce results, with the government already consolidating itself within the military and politically by canceling elections, calls for further demonstrations as well as the intervention of the armed forces were futile.&lt;ref name="RUSSIAfox"&gt;{{cite news |title = Russia bucks trend and asks world to leave Venezuela alone after 'coup' |url = http://www.foxnews.com/world/2017/03/31/russia-bucks-trend-and-asks-world-to-leave-venezuela-alone-after-coup.html |accessdate = 1 April 2017 |publisher = [[Fox News Channel]] |date = 31 March 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the rare criticism from Attorney General Ortega, an inner-circle official, Maduro ordered a review of the TSJ's decision regarding the National Assembly.&lt;ref name="USnews31"/&gt; One day later, the Tribunal reversed that particular order, thereby reinstating the powers of the Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-39468045 |title = Venezuela: Supreme court backtracks on powers bid |date = 1 April 2017 |publisher = BBC |accessdate = 1 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Slotkin |first = Jason |url = https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2017/04/01/522307795/venezuelas-top-court-and-president-reverse-course-restore-powers-to-legislature |title = Venezuela's Top Court And President Reverse Course, Restore Powers To Legislature |accessdate = 1 April 2017 |publisher = NPR |date = 1 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/denounced-as-a-dictatorship-venezuela-backs-down-reverses-court-ruling/2017/04/01/88451da8-1659-11e7-bb16-269934184168_story.html |title = Denounced as dictatorship, Venezuela backs down, reverses court's ruling on legislature's powers |accessdate = 1 April 2017 |newspaper = The Washington Post |date = 1 April 2017 |first1 = Mariana |last1 = Zuñiga |first2 = Nick |last2 = Miroff }}&lt;/ref&gt; The opposition, however, dismissed the backtracking and called on Venezuelans "to take to the streets" against what they called an attempted coup, arguing that the moves proved that Maduro controlled the judiciary and therefore [[separation of powers]] did not exist in the republic.&lt;ref name="USAapril1"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Dreier |first1 = Hannah |last2 = Sanchez |first2 = Fabiola |title = Venezuela high court reverses move to strip congress' power |url = https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/04/01/venezuela-high-court-reverses-move-strip-congress-power/99904910/ |accessdate = 1 April 2017 |work = [[USA Today]] |date = 1 April 2017 |language = en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests in the country continued after the reversal with the opposition demanding early elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Venezuela: Protests continue |url = http://www.euronews.com/2017/04/02/venezuela-protests-continue |accessdate = 2 April 2017 |work = [[Euronews]] |date = 2 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proceedings against TSJ====

Following the reversal of the rulings by the TSJ, the National Assembly prepared proceeding against the court, accusing the court of not being separated from the executive, though [[Reuters]] noted that "the move by the opposition-led congress would only be symbolic because it remains powerless".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Venezuela opposition turns ire on Supreme Court judges |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKBN1740MX |accessdate = 3 April 2017 |agency = Reuters |date = 2 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the criticism of the TSJ's ruling by Attorney General Ortega, calls for her to be involved in a "Republican Moral Council, made up of the Prosecutor's Office, the Office of the Comptroller and the Office of the Ombudsman" to remove members of the TSJ were made.&lt;ref name="runrunORTEGA"&gt;{{cite news |last1 = Wolfermann |first1 = Gitanjali |title = Declaración de la Fiscal General es el primer paso para destitución de magistrados del TSJ |url = http://runrun.es/nacional/303147/declaracion-de-la-fiscal-general-es-el-primer-paso-para-destitucion-de-magistrados-del-tsj.html |accessdate = 3 April 2017 |work = [[Runrunes]] |date = 2 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During protests on 4 April, opposition leaders announced that they would pursue the removal of the seven judges who signed the rulings against the National Assembly.&lt;ref name=LPapril4/&gt; 

On 7 April, Ombudsman Tarek William Saab announced that Attorney General Ortega's vote would not be counted in a Republican Moral Council decision on TSJ judges, stating that he and Comptroller Manuel Galindo would not participate in proceedings against the TSJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=De frente: Ortega Díaz votó contra Saab y Galindo en investigación de siete magistrados del TSJ {{!}} El Cooperante|url=http://elcooperante.com/de-frente-ortega-diaz-voto-contra-saab-y-galindo-en-investigacion-de-siete-magistrados-del-tsj/|accessdate=9 April 2017|work=El Cooperante|date=7 April 2017|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutional assembly===
{{main|Venezuelan Constitutional Assembly election, 2017}}
{{Quote box|width=250px|align=right|quote=Today, on May 1, I announce that I will use my presidential privileges as constitutional head of state in accordance with article 347, to convene the original constituent power so that the working class and the people can call a national constituent assembly.|source=[[Nicolás Maduro|President Nicolás Maduro]]&lt;ref name=TELEcon&gt;{{cite web|title=Venezuelan President Calls for Popular Assembly to Remake Constitution|url=http://www.telesurtv.net/english/news/Venezuelan-President-Calls-for-Popular-Assembly-to-Remake-Constitution-20170501-0020.html|website=[[teleSUR]]|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Proposal====
On 1 May 2017 following a month of protests that resulted in at least 29 dead, Maduro calls for a [[Constitutional Assembly]] that would draft a new constitution that would replace the [[1999 Venezuela Constitution]].&lt;ref name=USAmay&gt;{{cite news|title=Venezuela's embattled socialist president calls for citizens congress, new constitution|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2017/05/01/maduro-citizens-congress/101175468/|accessdate=1 May 2017|work=[[USA TODAY]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=1 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He invoked Article 347, and stated that his call for a new constitution was necessary to counter the actions of the opposition. The members of the Constitutional Assembly would not be elected in open elections, but selected from social organizations loyal to Maduro.&lt;ref name=USAmay/&gt; The proposal would be an alternative way to close the National Assembly. It would also allow him to stay in power during the [[interregnum]], as the process would take at least two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2019619-crisis-venezuela-nicolas-maduro-autogolpe-asamblea-nacional|title= ¿Qué busca Nicolás Maduro con el nuevo autogolpe que quiere imponer en Venezuela?|trans-title=What is Maduro seeking with the new self-coup that he tries to impose in Venezuela?|language= Spanish|date= 2 May 2017|work= La Nación|accessdate=1 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Diosdado Cabello]] pointed that the new constitution would prevent a politician similar to the Argentine [[Mauricio Macri]] from ever becoming president of Venezuela.&lt;ref name="mc"/&gt; Macri was elected president in the [[Argentine general election, 2015|2015 presidential elections]], ending the 12-years terms of [[Néstor Kirchner]] and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]], longtime allies of both Chávez and Maduro. 

The MUD started a common front for all the people in Venezuela that oppose the amendment. It is composed by the MUD, the [[Marea Socialista]], minor parties without representatives in the Assembly (such as the marxists Bandera Roja), disenchanted chavistas, the [[Catholic Church in Venezuela|Catholic Church]], universities, human rights organizations, lawyers and artists. [[Eustoquio Contreras]] is the only deputy that defected from Maduro and opposed the amendment.&lt;ref name="frente"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2023045-se-forma-un-frente-contra-la-constiuyente-que-incluye-chavistas|title= Se forma un frente contra la Constiuyente que incluye chavistas|trans-title=A front against the amendment is formed, and it includes Chavistas|language= Spanish|author= Daniel Lozano|date= 12 May 2017|work= La Nación|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luis Salamanca]], former rector of the [[National Electoral Council (Venezuela)|National Electoral Council]], considers that the front may not be capable to stop Maduro, as he is unwilling to negotiate the proposal.&lt;ref name="frente"/&gt;

====Approval====
On 22 May, the Republican Moral Council – which the opposition hoped would establish proceedings against TSJ judges – shared their approval of the National Constitutional Assembly despite the absence of Attorney General Ortega, with Ombudsman [[Tarek William Saab]] stating that "The call to the National Constituent Assembly is a constitutional exit to the political situation that the country is living, in order to foster dialogue and coexistence of the country".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Consejo Moral Republicano anuncia apoyo a la Asamblea Nacional Constituyente|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/site/2017/05/22/consejo-moral-republicano-anuncia-apoyo-a-la-asamblea-nacional-constituyente/|accessdate=22 May 2017|work=[[La Patilla]]|date=22 May 2017|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The next day on 23 May, Danilo Antonio Mojica Monsalvo, the magistrate of the Social Cassation Chamber of the TSJ announced his disagreement with President Maduro's Constitutional Assembly, stating that without a popular referendum voting on the assembly, the move would be "spurious ... a legal metaphor to describe what is done outside the Constitution".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Magistrado del TSJ se pronunció en contra de la Constituyente|url=http://www.el-nacional.com/noticias/oposicion/magistrado-del-tsj-pronuncio-contra-constituyente_183776|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=[[El Nacional (Caracas)|El Nacional]]|date=23 May 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another TSJ judge, Marisela Godoy, spoke out against Maduro's proposal, stating "At this moment I support, without any fear, the attorney general ([[Luisa Ortega Díaz]]), who is not any official" and that if she were to be criticized by the government, she "does not care".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Magistrada del TSJ, Marisela Godoy, se pronuncia en contra de la "constituyente" Maduro|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/site/2017/05/23/magistrada-del-tsj-marisela-godoy-se-pronuncia-en-contra-de-la-constituyente-maduro/|accessdate=23 May 2017|work=[[La Patilla]]|date=23 May 2017|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Constitutional assembly proposal was accepted by the CNE, with an election slated for 10 July 2017.&lt;ref name="REUTmay17"&gt;{{cite news|title=As Venezuela unrest spreads, Maduro presses on with plans to rewrite charter|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-politics-idUSKBN18J320|accessdate=24 May 2017|agency=[[Reuters]]|date=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reactions to constitutional assembly====
The call generated further protests. 920 Battalions were created and maintained, composed by 200,000 [[militia]]s to respond to violent protests.&lt;ref name="200000 militias"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2022230-el-chavismo-entrenara-a-200000-militantes-politicos-para-el-combate|title= El chavismo entrenará a 200.000 militantes políticos "para el combate"|trans-title=Chavismo will train 200.000 militias "for combat"|language= Spanish|author= Daniel Lozano|date= 10 May 2017|work= La Nación|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pedro Carreño]], aide of [[Diosdado Cabello]], stated that Venezuela would be suffering an attack similar to the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]] against [[Salvador Allende]], and that those militias would prevent that.&lt;ref name="200000 militias"/&gt; Capriles complained that Maduro is preparing forces to wage a war, and said "let the world see who wants elections and who tries to impose himself by force".&lt;ref name="200000 militias"/&gt; Protesters may be tried under [[military justice]], instead of civil courts.&lt;ref name="mc"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lanacion.com.ar/2021854-nueva-estrategia-de-maduro-ordena-juzgar-a-los-civiles-en-los-tribunales-militares|title= Nueva estrategia de Maduro: ordena juzgar a los civiles en los tribunales militares|trans-title=New strategy of Maduro: he orders to judge civilians in military courts|language= Spanish|author= Daniel Lozano|date= 9 May 2017|work= La Nación|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution of Venezuela limits the scope of the military courts to crimes of a military nature.&lt;ref name="mc"/&gt;

===Parallel high court===
{{see also|:es:Tribunal Supremo de Justicia de Venezuela en el exterior}}
On 20 June 2017, President of the National Assembly [[Julio Borges]], the opposition-led legislative body of Venezuela, announced the activations of Articles 333 and 350 of the Venezuelan Constitution.&lt;ref name="LP350"&gt;{{cite news|title=Unidad anuncia activación del 350, nueva hoja de ruta y respaldo a la Fiscal General|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/site/2017/06/20/unidad-anuncia-activacion-del-350-nueva-hoja-de-ruta-y-respaldo-a-la-fiscal-general/|accessdate=21 June 2017|work=[[La Patilla]]|date=20 June 2017|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PAPrebel"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Martín|first1=Sabrina|title=Venezuelan Opposition Lays Out Plan to Rebel against Maduro Regime, Establish Parallel Government|url=https://panampost.com/sabrina-martin/2017/06/21/venezuelan-opposition-lays-out-plan-to-rebel-against-maduro-regime/|accessdate=22 June 2017|work=[[PanAm Post]]|date=21 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "road map" was also enacted by the opposition which entailed the nullification of further actions performed by the TSJ, the call for a continuous, peaceful protest movement "until the restitution of the constitutional order" and for Venezuelans to continue to confront President Maduro's constitutional assembly.&lt;ref name="LP350"/&gt;

====Article 333====
{{Quote frame |quote=This Constitution shall not cease to be in effect if it ceases to be observed due to acts of force or because or repeal in any manner other than as provided for herein. In such eventuality, every citizen, whether or not vested with official authority, has a duty to assist in bringing it back into actual effect.}}

====Article 350====
{{Quote frame |quote=The people of Venezuela, true to their republican tradition and their struggle for independence, peace and freedom, shall disown any regime, legislation or authority that violates democratic values, principles and guarantees or encroaches upon human rights.}}

====Reactions to parallel government====
According to Jose Vicente Haro, a constitutional lawyer, the Venezuelan opposition should name new directors of Venezuela's branches of government in order to establish a parallel government and to further pursue corrupt individuals, however noting that the Bolivarian government may attempt to jail opposition leaders.&lt;ref name="PAPrebel"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2008">The '''Act anent Peace and War''' ([[Scots language|Scots]] ''anent'' means ''about'' or ''concerning'') was an act of the [[Parliament of Scotland]] passed in 1703. 

The Act concerned [[foreign policy]] and the [[royal prerogative]]: it provided that following the death of Queen [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] without direct heirs, no future monarch of Scotland and England could take Scotland to war without the explicit consent of the parliament.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rps.ac.uk/mss/1703/5/193&lt;/ref&gt;   

It was a response to the English [[Act of Settlement 1701|Act of Settlement]] which had made members of the [[House of Hanover]] heirs to the throne of England.  The Scots, already unhappy with the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], were concerned that rule by Hanoverians would lead to unwelcome Scottish involvement in German and continental wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/union/intro_union2.shtml|title=BBC History|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same parliament forced royal assent to the [[Act of Security 1704|Act of Security]]. The English parliament retaliated with the [[Alien Act 1705|Alien Act]], removing Scottish trading privileges in England.

The conflict between the two parliaments was finally resolved by their merger under the terms of the [[Acts of Union 1707]]. The union made the Act anent Peace and War and the Act of Security void, and they were [[Repeal of Certain Scotch Acts 1707|formally repealed]] in December 1707.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=29592&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6775">'''Andrew Gallagher Haley''' (November 19, 1904 in Tacoma, Washington &amp;ndash; 1966) was an American lawyer.  He has been described as the world’s first practitioner of [[space law]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Lang and Brendan Gill (December 29, 1956) The Talk of the Town, "Metalaw", [[The New Yorker]], p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Haley coined the term [[Metalaw]], which refers to a field of legal thought now closely related to the scientific [[Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence]] ([[SETI]]).&lt;ref&gt;Andrew G. Haley (November 8, 1956) "Space law and Metalaw – A Synoptic View", [[Harvard Law Record]] 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew G. Haley (1963) ''Space Law and Government'', Appleton Century Crofts, New York&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Fasan (1970) ''Relations with Alien Intelligences:  The Scientific Basis of Metalaw'', Berlin Verlag, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Haley earned his LLB from [[Georgetown University Law School]] and later earned a BA from George Washington University.

In the early days of [[jet-assisted takeoff]] (JATO), engineers including [[Theodore von Kármán]] decided to form [[Aerojet]] Corporation to provide a business structure to their activities. When von Kármán called on Haley in 1942 to help with the [[incorporation (business)|incorporation]], Haley said he was busy with a case before the [[Federal Power Commission]]. In a gesture of [[quid pro quo]], von Kármán’s team provided evidence to win Haley’s case before the Commission, and Haley went to California to draw up the [[articles of incorporation]].&lt;ref name=TvK&gt;[[Theodore von Kármán]] (1967) ''The Wind and Beyond''&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|256,7}}

When financing from the Air Force was interrupted, General [[Benjamin Chidlaw]] told Kármán, "Find somebody who knows something about doing business with Washington and send him here." Haley’s knowledge of the business and legal training made him the man for the job. But he was in uniform at Military Affairs Division of [[Judge Advocate General's Corps, U.S. Air Force]]. Theodore worked his way up the [[command hierarchy|chain of command]] to [[General Arnold]] who dismissed Haley for civilian duty at Aerojet.
:Haley became Areojet’s second president on August 26, 1942. He proved to be an incredible administrator. He held the company together by guts and audacity. On occasion he even sent handwritten letters to the Navy for advances to meet payrolls.&lt;ref name=TvK/&gt;{{rp|259}}

Aerojet expanded quickly, but needed capital, so Haley contacted William F. O'Niel, president of [[General Tire]] and his vice-president [[Dan A. Kimball]]. A line of credit was offered and in January 1945 General Tire bought half the stock of Aerojet. General Tire pressured the remaining shareholders, including Haley and Kármán, to sell, which they did in 1953.&lt;ref name=TvK/&gt;{{rp|316–19}}
:Andy Haley left Areojet to become counsel for a U. S. Senate committee that was investigating the economic future of the [[aerospace industry]]. Later, he went back to the practice of [[communications law|radio law]]. He never lost his love of rocketry, however, and today he is a leading figure in the [[International Astronautical Federation]] … and widely known as the nation's first "space lawyer", having devoted himself, among other things, to setting up guidelines for prospective claims to the [[moon]].&lt;ref name=TvK/&gt;{{rp|319,20}}
In 1963 [[Appleton-Century-Crofts]] published Haley’s ''Space Law and Government''. [[Lyndon Johnson]] (then Vice President), [[Carl Albert]] and [[George P. Miller]] contributed forwards to the book. Haley acknowledged the "analytical capacity of [[Robert D. Crane|Mr. Crane]] and his unexcelled ability to quickly assemble source material"(page xv). The chapters considered the promise and challenge of space, traditional bases of [[international law]], national consent to overflight, limits of national sovereignty, sovereignty over celestial bodies, space vehicle regulations, space communications, liability for personal and property damages, space medical jurisprudence, intergovernmental organizations, and non-governmental organizations. Reviews were published by Alan V. Washburn in [[American Journal of Legal History]] and Carol Q. Christol in [[Southern California Law Review]] (both in 1964), by Stephen E. Doyle in [[Duke Law Journal]] (1965) and by L.F.E. Goldie in [[Georgetown Law Journal]] (1966).

In his 1967 autobiography, Kármán tells of his trip to Moscow where he met with [[Ivan Bardin]]. At the time he was unaware of early rocketry in Russia, and only by Haley’s graces later was he brought up to speed:
:My friend, space lawyer Andrew G. Haley, who likes to explore historical questions as a hobby, later told me that it is likely that the Russians – and not the Germans as is popularly supposed – founded the first rocket society in the world. At least Moscow had an interplanetary travel group as early as 1924, and three years later, at the time the Germans founded their first rocket society, the Russians were hosts to the first International Exhibition of Space Navigation. In 1928 and during the following four years Professor [[Nikolai Rynin]] published a formidable nine-volume encyclopedia entitled ''Interplanetary Communications''. It was the first authoritative summary of man’s knowledge of space travel.&lt;ref name=TvK/&gt;{{rp|188}}

Haley, along with his friend and colleague [[Ernst Fasan]], was instrumental in founding both the [[International Academy of Astronautics]] and the [[International Institute of Space Law]].

Haley died in 1966.

Under [[Great Britain]] [[statutory law]], one who is eligible for [[Legal aid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrothgar.co.uk/YAWS/rules/part43.htm English legal web site] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221064001/http://www.hrothgar.co.uk/YAWS/rules/part43.htm |date=February 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880034_en_5.htm Legal Aid Act] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518004854/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1988/Ukpga_19880034_en_5.htm |date=May 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also refers to such a person under [[Scottish law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jonathanmitchell.info/legalaid/chapter10.htm private law firm site], citing Legal Aid (Scotland) Act 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [[United States|U.S.]] [[Bankruptcy law]], it is also a person who applies to a [[debt relief]] agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|11|526}} (a) [http://doney.net/bkcode/11usc0526.htm Bankruptcy law site]&lt;/ref&gt;  A debt relief agency is "any person who provides any bankruptcy assistance to an assisted person in return for the payment of money or other valuable consideration, or who is a bankruptcy petition preparer" under {{UnitedStatesCode|11|110}}.

The '''Belize Elections and Boundaries Commission''' is the primary electoral body in [[Belize]].  It supervises all local and national [[elections]]. The Commission also establishes the boundaries of Belize's electoral divisions.

==Formation and duties==
The EBC was formed in 1978 to oversee Belizean elections according to the Representation of the People Act. This Act became part of the [[Constitution of Belize|Belize Constitution]] in 1981. The commission maintains a database of Belizean voters and periodically informs the nation on the state of the voter's list. It also occasionally makes proposals to revise boundaries in order to maintain near equality in voting divisions. There are currently 31 electoral divisions in Belize. 

The EBC has a chairman and four other persons on its board. The Chairman and two members are appointed by the Governor General on the advice of the Prime Minister after consultation with the leader of the Opposition; the remaining members are appointed similarly, with the concurrence of the Leader of the Opposition.

==Delegation of duties==
According to the [[Constitution of Belize|Belize Constitution]], the EBC delegates its responsibilities to the Chief Elections Officer, who is not a member of the commission, and is officially in charge of voter registration, conduct of elections, and voter education.

==Members of the EBC==
* Chairman: Karl H. Menzies
* Alberto August
* Derek Courtenay
* Dean Lindo
* Samira Musa Pott

      <comment>/* European Union blocking statute */</comment>
      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5305">A '''blocking statute''' is a law of one jurisdiction intended to hinder application there of a law made by a foreign jurisdiction. A blocking statute was proposed by the [[European Union]] in 1996 to nullify a US trade embargo on Cuba and sanctions related to Iran and Libya which affected countries trading with the US and with the named countries. The 1996 statute was not enacted as the disagreements were settled by other means.

A blocking statute shields companies in its jurisdiction against sanctions by prohibiting them from respecting the sanctions, and not recognising foreign court rulings enforcing them.&lt;ref name="EC" /&gt;

== European Union blocking statute==
EU Blocking Statute was originally introduced in 1996 to "counteract" the US's sanctions imposed against Cuba, Iran, and Libya.&lt;ref name="lexology"/&gt;
===2018 update===
On 7 August 2018, the EU enacted an updated Blocking Statute to nullify US sanctions on countries trading with Iran, after the US announced sanctions against such countries following its [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|withdrawal from an agreement]] permitting trade if Iran curtailed its nuclear programme. The process of updating the EU Blocking Statute was commenced by adding to its scope on 6 June 2018 the extraterritorial sanctions the US re-imposed on Iran.&lt;ref name=EC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-18-4805_en.htm|title=Updated Blocking Statute in support of Iran nuclear deal enters into force |website=[[Europa (Web portal)|Europa.eu]] |publisher=European Commission Press Release Database|date=6 August 2018|author= |accessdate= 7 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Commission said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EU blocking US sanctions against Iran to protect European companies |url=https://www.rt.com/business/435198-eu-blocking-us-sanctions-against-iran/ |accessdate=3 September 2018 |work=RT International}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|...We are determined to protect European economic operators engaged in legitimate business with Iran, in accordance with EU law and with UN Security Council resolution 2231,” the European Commission stated on Monday...This is why the European Union’s updated Blocking Statute enters into force on 7 August to protect EU companies doing legitimate business with Iran from the impact of US extra-territorial sanctions.}}
The 2018 Blocking Statute essentially prohibits EU companies from "direct" or "indirect" (via subsidiaries or intermediary persons) compliance with the laws listed in US sanctions Annex.&lt;ref name="lexology"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Craig |first1=Ashley W. |last2=Beck |first2=Jochen |last3=Ruessmann |first3=Laurent |title=International Firms Caught Between U.S. Iran Sanctions and EU Blocking Statute|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=dc6d6b88-c580-4cd9-a884-c43365856759 |website=Lexology |accessdate=2 September 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also does not recognize any verdicts by courts that enforce US penalties. A to-be established [[clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] will, through a [[special-purpose vehicle]] set up for this purpose, facilitate trade with Iran by European companies, bypassing US sanctions.&lt;ref name="FT16112018"&gt;{{cite news |title=EU Outlines Measures to Counter American Sanctions Against Iran|url=https://financialtribune.com/articles/domestic-economy/95103/eu-outlines-measures-to-counter-american-sanctions-against-iran|work=[[Financial Tribune]]|date=16 November 2018|accessdate=18 November 2018|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20181118103833/https://financialtribune.com/articles/domestic-economy/95103/eu-outlines-measures-to-counter-american-sanctions-against-iran|archivedate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reuters described the Blocking Statute as "a political weapon than a regulation", since, it wrote, the Blocking Statute's rules were "vague and difficult to enforce".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Emmott |first1=Robin |title=In 1990s redux, EU to consider blocking U.S. sanctions over Iran |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-eu-business/in-1990s-redux-eu-to-consider-blocking-u-s-sanctions-over-iran-idUSKBN1IA2PV |accessdate=3 September 2018 |work= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903071046/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-eu-business/in-1990s-redux-eu-to-consider-blocking-u-s-sanctions-over-iran-idUSKBN1IA2PV |archivedate=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A senior US administration official said they were not "particularly concerned by" the imposition of the blocking statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Riley-Smith |first1=Ben |last2=Ensor |first2=Josie |title=America dismisses EU ‘blocking statute’ as Iran sanctions finally bite |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/08/06/america-dismisses-eu-blocking-statute-iran-sanctions-finally/ |accessdate=2 September 2018 |work=The Telegraph |date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boyd Knight v Purdue [1999] 2 NZLR 278  is a cited case in New Zealand regarding liability for negligent misstatements &lt;ref name="McLay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Butterworths Student Companion Torts |edition=4th |last1=McLay |first1=Geoff |publisher=LexisNexis |ISBN=0-408-71686-X|year=2003 |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
After losing their investment of $750,000 in Burbery Mortgage Finance &amp; Savings Ltd, the plaintiffs sued the auditors to recover their investment, on the basis that without their audit certificate, that under the Securities Act, there would not have been a prospectus, and so no investment in the first place.

In the High Court, they won their claim, albeit reduced by 50% due to contributory negligence due to the fact that it was a speculative investment in the first place.

The auditors appealed. 

==Held==
The Court of Appeal reversed the High Courts award of damages, on the basis that the plaintiff's had admitted they had not read the advert as a "true and fair view" of the accounts.

'''Business casual''' is an ambiguously defined [[dress code]] adopted by some [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] workplaces in [[Western world|Western countries]], comprising more [[casual wear]] than [[informal wear]] ("dress clothes"), but less casual than [[smart casual]].

Widespread acceptance of business casual attire was preceded by [[Casual Friday]]s which originated [[California]], [[United States]], in the 1990s, in turn inspired by the [[Hawaii]]an 1960s casual custom of [[Aloha Friday]].&lt;ref name="BrownArthur2002"&gt;Brown &amp; Arthur 2002, p. 78-79.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HopeTozian2002"&gt;Hope &amp; Tozian 2000, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
There is no generally agreed definition of "business casual".  One definition of business casual states that it includes [[khaki]] pants, [[slacks]], and [[skirts]], as well as short-sleeved [[polo shirt]]s  and long-sleeved shirts, but excludes jeans, tennis shoes, tight or short skirts, T-shirts, and sweatshirts.&lt;ref name="Interviewing"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marquette.edu/csc/undergraduate/interviewing.shtml|title = Interviewing {{!}} Career Services Center {{!}} Marquette University| website = Marquette University Career Services Center | accessdate = 26 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906180709/http://www.marquette.edu//csc/undergraduate/interviewing.shtml |archive-date=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another source, an American university careers service, states that business casual consists of neutral colors more towards the dark shades of black, gray, navy, but can include white and off white, and reminds that the clothing should be pressed and have clean, crisp seams.&lt;ref name="Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University"&gt;{{cite web|title=Business casual attire|url=http://www.career.vt.edu/JobSearchGuide/BusinessCasualAttire.html#ATTIREMENWOMEN|publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Dress for Success" advice from the University of Toronto sums up business casual as "a classic, clean cut, and put together look where a full suit is not required," which means slacks, khakis, or skirts; [[blouse]]s, polo shirts, or shirts with collar but no [[necktie]]; some [[sweaters]]; and closed-toe shoes.&lt;ref name=UTM/&gt; The Canadian university ends with the warning that "it is not clothing you would wear to a club or for athletic purposes.... Don’t let the word casual mislead you. You still need to look professional."&lt;ref name=UTM&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/careers/business-formal-professional-or-business-casual | title = Business formal/professional or business casual? | publisher = [[University of Toronto Mississauga]] | accessdate = 28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another author wrote in the ''[[Financial Times]]'' that "Ordinarily business casual for guys seems fairly clear. It is a pair of [[chinos]], a [[blazer]] and a good shirt, no tie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/5eec3cd6-8bf2-11e0-854c-00144feab49a.html#axzz2kbppAQhD|title=Why business casual makes me smart|last=Shrimsley|first=Robert|date=3 June 2011|work=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[BBC]] article suggested that a "safe global standard" consists of "a button down shirt," "jackets or blazers, khaki or gray slacks, and leather shoes."&lt;ref name=BBC-2011&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bbc.com/travel/feature/20111118-business-casual-attire-around-the-world | date = 22 November 2011 | title = ‘Business casual’ attire around the world | work = BBC Business | first = Chris | last = McGinnis | publisher = [[BBC]] | accessdate = 28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It warned, however, that great variation exists between countries and regions within countries.&lt;ref name=BBC-2011/&gt; A U.S. menswear retailer advises men to wear a collared shirt, chinos, navy blazer, and brown shoes, while making sure to look "clean and well-groomed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://blog.paulfredrick.com/2010/05/25/rules/10-tips-for-todays-business-casual-wardrobe | title = 10 Tips for Today’s Business Casual Wardrobe | publisher = Paul Fredrick | location = Fleetwood | accessdate = 11 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A contributor to ''[[Forbes]]'' asked her Facebook friends to define business casual, and found a slightly more casual apparent consensus not forcibly including a jacket: "For men: trousers/khakis and a shirt with a collar. For women: trousers/knee-length skirt and a blouse or shirt with a collar. No jeans. No athletic wear." A response to that was "I disagree. No khakis." She states that "there’s a lack of consensus in what actually defines a business casual wardrobe. All most people know is they don’t want to see too much of a colleague’s body, including feet."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/reneesylvestrewilliams/2012/05/09/what-is-business-casual/|title=What is Business Casual?|last=Sylvestre-Williams|first=Renee|date=9 May 2012|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=15 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hatnote|For the ships that carried Irish immigrants during the 19th century, see [[coffin ship]].}}

'''Coffin ship''' is the name given to any [[ship]] that has been overinsured and is therefore worth more to its owners sunk than afloat. These were hazardous places to work in the days before effective maritime safety regulation. They were generally eliminated in the 1870s with the success of reforms championed by [[British people|British]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Samuel Plimsoll]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.allatsea.net/plimsoll-line-and-coffin-ships/ Plimsoll Line and Coffin Ships]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many overloaded, overinsured ships in the days of wooden sailing ships were old ships riddled with wood rot and woodworm and [[shipworm]], repainted and renamed and falsely stated to be new ships. There were over 2000 cases of sailors who had signed on as crew for a ship, seeing the ship's condition, refusing to go on board it, and being tried in court for this refusal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Coast (TV series)|''Coast'' (TV series)]], episode "Hull to London"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Lshipping.htm |title=Merchant Shipping Act |publisher=[[SchoolNet]] |work=[[Spartacus Educational]] |date= |accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Samuel Plimsoll]] stated in the UK Parliament that "The Secretary of [[Lloyd's Register|Lloyd's]] tells a friend of mine that he does not know a single ship which has been broken up voluntarily by the owners in the course of 30 years on account of its being worn out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1875/jul/22/parliament-breach-of-order-mr-plimsoll |title=Parliament — Breach of Order (Mr. Plimsoll) |work=[[Hansard]], 22 July 1875 |publisher=Millbank Systems |date= |accessdate=30 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 the ship ''[[Lucona]]'' sank in the Indian Ocean as a result of a time bomb which had been planted by [[Udo Proksch]], the owner of the cargo, so he could fraudulently collect the insurance money. The cargo was claimed to consist of a disassembled uranium processing plant but in fact consisted of worthless scrap. 6 of the 12 crew members died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-03-15/features/8903260885_1_viennese-austria-udo-proksch |title=The Lucona Affair |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=March 15, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The 1900 Dutch play ''[[Op hoop van zegen]]'' by the socialist playwright [[Herman Heijermans]] depicts a ruthless shipowner in a small Dutch village sending an unsound fishing boat out into a stormy sea - with the deliberate result that it becomes lost with all hands - and with the owner pocketing the insurance money. The play is considered a classic of Dutch theatre and literature, and was adapted to film four times. 

[[Leon Uris]] also refers to death ships in his novel ''[[Redemption (Uris novel)|Redemption]]''.

''[[The Death Ship]]'' (German title: ''Das Totenschiff'') is a novel by the pseudonymous author known as [[B. Traven]] which deals with sailors working on a ship which the owners want to sink.

{{Politics of Malta}}

The '''Commissioner of Laws''' is an office in [[Malta]] that has been established by the 1980 Revisions of Statutory Laws Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130324/local/Debono-is-given-law-role.462790 |title=Debono is given law role |publisher=timesofmalta.com |date=2013-03-24 |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The current commissioner is [[Franco Debono]], whose appointment was widely publicized in media on Malta. His appointment by the [[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour Party]]-administration was lambasted by the [[Leader of the Opposition]] [[Lawrence Gonzi]], because his party was not consulted beforehand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20130326/local/View-split-on-divisive-Debono-appointments.463020 |title=View split on ‘divisive’ Debono appointments |publisher=timesofmalta.com |date=2013-03-26 |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others his past as a rebel [[Member of Parliament|MP]] as a reason to pick a "more unifying figure."

According to Labour MP [[Owen Bonnici]], the responsibilities of the post include working to remove conflicting, unconstitutional and human rights-breaching laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Debono |first=James |url=http://maltatoday.com.mt/en/newsdetails/news/national/Footsoldier-Franco-Debono-to-receive-over-24-000-for-Law-Commissioner-post-20130324 |title=‘Foot soldier’ Franco Debono to receive over €24,000 for Law Commissioner post |publisher=Maltatoday.com.mt |date= |accessdate=2013-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common departments include [[Marketing]], [[Finance]], [[Operations management|Operations]]{{dn||date=April 2018}}, [[Human resource management|Human Resource]], and [[Information technology|IT]]. These five divisions represent the major departments within a publicly traded company, though there are often smaller departments within autonomous firms. 
There is typically a [[CEO]], and [[Board of Directors]] composed of the directors of each department. There are also company presidents, vice presidents, and [[CFO]]s.

The kind of differentiation and diversity among corporations is of importance to [[corporate law]] (for example such difference in corporation type that has impact on corporate structure is the difference between public owned and proprietary companies).&lt;ref name="McQueen"/&gt;
Choosing a structure for a company is an important decision and must be strategically thought out because it could either aid or harm the making of business. The structure must also be a good fit for the type of activities, goals, and vision of the company. &lt;ref &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organizational Structure: An Overview|url=http://ctb.ku.edu/en/table-of-contents/structure/organizational-structure/overview/main|publisher=Community Tool Box|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizational structure is a reflection of how convenient business is conducted.

== Models ==

=== Functional structure ===
This model is commonly used in single-program organizations. It is basically the standard structure mentioned earlier, which is organized around departments. This structure is most appropriate for all small organizations.

=== Divisional structure ===
Divisional structures are also called ''''product structures'''' because they are based on a certain product or project. This structure is most common in multi-service organizations. Normally, it's based on the departments divided in the firm.

=== Geographic structure ===
Geographic structures are used in multi-site organizations and are frequently used by networks across different geographic areas.

=== Matrix structure ===
The Matrix structure is probably the most complicated model of them all because it is organised around multiple dimensions (e.g. geography and product), typically with more than one supervisor. This structure is commonly used in  very large organisations because a greater volume requires greater co-ordination. However, this structure is very difficult to manage so it is usually better to reconsider its use and replace it with a different type of structure, then compensate for the tradeoffs.

== Classifications ==
In addition to those models, there are other factors that make up the structure of an organization. Depending on the chain of command, a company's structure could be classified as either vertical or horizontal, as well as centralized or decentralized. A vertically structured organization or a "tall" company describes a chain of management, usually with a CEO at the top delegating authority to lower-level managers through mid-level managers. Horizontal or "flat" companies, however, have almost no middle-managers, which implies that high-level managers get involved in daily tasks and interact with customers and front-line personnel. &lt;ref &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Huebsch|first=Russell|title=The Vertical Structure Vs. the Horizontal Structure in an Organization|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/vertical-structure-vs-horizontal-structure-organization-4904.html|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A centralized organizational structure describes how a company's direction and decisions are set by one individual only. &lt;ref &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitez|first=Osmond|title=Organizational Structure|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/centralized-vs-decentralized-organizational-structure-2785.html|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centralization compliments companies with "tall" structures to create [[Bureaucratic]]  organizations. Decentralized organizational structures allow individuals some autonomy at each level of the business, because they join the decision-making process. Evidently, classifying organizations as centralized or decentralized is linked to them being "tall" or "flat".

== Technology ==
There is an emerging trend in the way companies shape their organizational structures. More businesses are moving towards a much flatter, decentralized organizational structure. 
Technological developments accelerate these organizational changes as they improve the efficiency of business, causing it to restructure departments, modify position requirements, or add and remove jobs. &lt;ref &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archer|first=Clare|title=Technology's Impact on Organizational Changes|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/technologys-impact-organizational-changes-20377.html|publisher=Demand Media|accessdate=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Earthen plaster''' (adobe plaster, dagga&lt;ref&gt;dagga is a Mideast and African term for mud plaster. Evans, Ianto, Linda Smiley, and Michael Smith. ''The hand-sculpted house: a philosophical and practical guide to building a cob cottage''. White River Junction, Vt.: Chelsea Green Pub. Co., 2002. 264. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;) is a blend of clay, fine aggregate, and fiber.  Other common additives include [[pigments]], [[Lime (mineral)|lime]], [[casein]], prickly pear cactus juice (''[[Opuntia]]''), [[manure]], and [[linseed oil]].  Earthen plaster is usually applied to [[masonry]], [[cob (material)|cob]], or [[Straw-bale construction|straw bale]] interiors or exteriors as a [[wall]] finish.  It provides protection to the structural and insulating building components as well as texture and color.

==Physical composition==
All [[plaster]]s and [[stuccos]] have several common features:  they all contain a structural component, a binding element, and some form of fiber.  Usually the term plaster refers to a wall covering made from [[earth]], [[Lime (mineral)|lime]] or [[gypsum]], while stucco uses a [[cement]] or synthetic binding element.

===Clay: the binding agent===
[[Clay]] is a [[soil]] component consisting of extremely fine particles.  Most clays consist of hydrous [[aluminum silicates]], though there is a considerable amount of chemical variation among the clays.  Clay is cohesive and binds to the [[sand]] and the [[straw]], holding the mixture together, as well as securing the mixture to the wall.  Clay is also plastic when wet, which makes the plaster mixture workable.

===Sand: structural strength===
Sand provides structure, strength, and bulk to earthen plasters.  Sand consists of tiny mineral granules of [[Rock (geology)|rock]], its parent material.  Predominately composed of [[silicon dioxide]] ([[quartz]]), sand is a non-reactive substance.  Because sand occurs naturally in many [[subsoil]]s, all of the sand necessary may be already found in the soil.

===Fiber: tensile strength and reinforcement===
Dry straw, [[hemp]] fiber, [[cattail]]s, [[coconut]] fiber, and animal hair are all suitable fiber choices for earthen plasters.  Fiber forms a reinforcing meshwork in plasters, which helps to hold the plaster together.  Fiber also provides some flexibility to a dried plaster.  When clay dries it shrinks and tends to crack, but this cracking can be countered by the fiber.  The fiber used in plasters must be clean, dry, and mold-free.

==Additives==
Additives are usually blended with the clay, sand, and [[natural fiber]] to improve the workability and strength of a plaster.  Sometimes additives are added to the finish coat and other times additives may be added to all coats.  Some of the most common additives are [[Wheatpaste|wheat flour paste]], manure, cactus juice, casein (milk protein) and various natural oils such as [[linseed oil]].  Other additives include, [[salt]], [[stearate]], [[tallow]], [[tannin]], [[leaves]] and [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of certain trees, [[xanthan gum]], [[alum]], natural glues, [[gum arabic]], [[kelp]], [[Agricultural lime|lime]], [[powdered milk]], or the [[blood]] of livestock.

===Flour paste===
Cooked flour paste is a cheap natural [[glue]] that is easy to make from common ingredients.  The water and [[flour]] slurry is cooked until the gluten binds the elements of the mixture, creating a durable glue.  In plaster, the flour paste serves as a binding agent and a hardener.

===Manure===
Manure serves as a binding agent and gives plaster more body.{{Vague|date=December 2016}}  Manure also contains small natural fibers that provide additional [[tensile strength]] as well as reduce cracking and [[water erosion]].  Different types of manure have different effects.  Horse manure has a high microfiber content, but cow manure has more hardening enzymes.  People have reported success with [[llama]] and [[alpaca]]  dung.  Manure should be fresh or fermented when mixed with plaster, as composted manure loses its [[enzyme]]s and adhesive qualities.  Manure should be sifted before use.

===Prickly pear cactus juice===
The liquid from [[opuntia|prickly pear]] cactus used to be one of the most common additives in [[the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plasters &amp; strawbale|author=Cedar Rose|url=http://www.thelaststraw.org/bonus-articles/earthplaster.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Straw Bale Earthen House|author=Athena and Bill Steen|url=http://www.thelaststraw.org/bonus-articles/earthplaster.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The juice from the prickly pear cactus leaf pads will serve many functions.  According to some sources, it helps the plaster set and increases its stickiness or [[adhesion]].  Cactus juice also serves as a stabilizer in that it helps make earthen plasters more water-resistant and more durable.  It also prevents dusting.

Cactus juice can increase plaster's workability and its ability to be formed into the desired shape.  Workability depends on the water content, the shape and size distribution of its [[Aggregate (composite)|aggregate]] (such as rock, sand, natural fiber, etc.), the age of the plaster, and the amount of other natural binder(s) (such as [[Lime (material)|lime]], [[wheatpaste]], cactus juice, hardening [[vegetable oil]], [[casein]] and other [[protein]]s, etc.)  Altering the water content, changing the aggregate mix, soaking the clay, or changing the binders will increase or decrease the plaster's workability. Excessive water will lead to increased bleeding (surface water) and/or segregation of aggregates (when the natural binder and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting plaster having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low workability, which cannot be readily made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water or binder.

Cactus juice works well because it contains [[pectin]], a water-soluble long-chain [[carbohydrate]] that acts as the binding agent to increase the adhesion of an earthen plaster.  Pectin is also responsible for increasing the water resistance of an earthen plaster and has been used to augment [[lime plaster]]s in both [[Mexico]] and the southwestern [[United States]] for hundreds of years.

Cactus juice is extracted by immersing cut leaves in water for as long as two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Cedar Rose |last=Guelberth |author2=Dan Chiras |title=The natural plaster book: earth, lime and gypsum plasters for natural homes|publisher=New Society Publishers |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interior earthen plaster==
Pure earthen plaster (plaster without lime, cement, or emulsified asphalt) is applied to interior surfaces more frequently than exteriors.  Before the plaster can be applied, it must have a surface to bind to.  Many types of wire mesh may be used, such as expanded-metal lath, woven wire lath, or welded wire lath.  Reed mats are another option.  If the plaster is being applied to a smooth surface such as drywall or plywood, a mixture of sand and wheat paste may be painted on to the surface to create the texture needed for plaster to bond.  

The plaster is usually applied in three coats. The first layer of plaster is called a "scratch coat". A "comb" is used to scratch the surface horizontally or in a crisscross pattern to provide a key for the second layer. In the United States, the "comb" is commonly referred to as the "scratcher". The next layer is called the "brown coat" or leveling coat. It is leveled with tools called "Darbys" and "Rods", scraped smooth, and floated to provide a nice even surface onto which to apply the color coat. It is then allowed to dry (cure) for 7–10 days minimum to allow "checking" (shrinkage) to take place. The final layer is referred to as the "color coat" or "finishing coat", and is typically 3&amp;nbsp;mm (1/8") thick.  It usually consists of clay with no fiber and sand added.  The color coat material was found in certain areas, red, green, white with mica and other colors, the material was gathered, made into a uniform consistency,  water added, applied to the walls in multi layers until the desired surface was acceptable.  The process in Spanish was known as, 'alisando'.

==Advantages and disadvantages of earthen plaster==
Earthen plasters are less toxic and energy intensive than many other wall coverings, which makes them appealing to the environmentally conscious.  Earthen plasters are also easily repaired and inexpensive. They resist water penetration but are permeable to [[water vapor]].  However, earthen plasters are often more labor-intensive than other forms of wall covering. If the mix does not have the correct component proportions, then many other problems may occur, such as dusting and cracking.  Earthen plasters are not approved by all local [[building codes]], and some require the use of cement stabilizers or [[asphalt]] emulsion. Earthen plaster is a rare wall covering in the developed world and there is a dearth of local experts for construction and repair.

In legal theory, particularly in [[law and economics]], '''efficient breach''' is a voluntary [[breach of contract]] and payment of damages by a party who concludes that they would incur greater [[economic loss]] by performing under the contract.

== Development of the theory ==

According to Black's Law Dictionary, efficient breach theory is "the view that a party should be allowed to breach a contract and pay damages, if doing so would be more economically efficient than performing under the contract."

The first statement of the theory of efficient breach appears to have been made in a [[law review]] article by Robert Birmingham in "Breach of Contract, Damage Measures, and Economic Efficiency", 24 Rutgers L.Rev. 273, 284 (1970) ("Repudiation of obligations should be encouraged where the promisor is able to profit from his default after placing his promisee in as good a position as he would have occupied had performance been rendered"). The theory was named by Charles Goetz and Robert Scott, "Liquidated Damages, Penalties, and the Just Compensation Principle: A Theory of Efficient Breach", 77 Colum.L.Rev. 554 (1977).

Efficient breach theory is associated with [[Richard Posner]] and the [[Law and Economics]] school of thought.  It has been used to defend the traditional [[common law]] rule that a [[tort|non-tortious]] breach of contract cannot be [[remedy (law)|remedied]] by [[punitive damages]] and [[penal damages]] (unreasonably excessive [[liquidated damages]] that are seen as a punishment for breach rather than a means to fairly compensate the other party).  Such penalties would discourage efficient breach, and therefore [[economic efficiency|"efficient"]] behavior, which would be undesirable for society as a whole.  Posner explains his views in his majority opinion in ''Lake River Corp. v. Carborundum Co.'', 769 F.2d 1284 (7th Cir. 1985).

== Posner's illustration ==

Judge Richard Posner gave this well-known illustration of efficient breach in "Economic Analysis of Law":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Suppose I sign a contract to deliver 100,000 custom-ground widgets at $.10 apiece to A, for use in his boiler factory.  After I have delivered 10,000, B comes to me, explains that he desperately needs 25,000 custom-ground widgets at once since otherwise he will be forced to close his pianola factory at great cost, and offers me $.15 apiece for 25,000 widgets.  I sell him the widgets and as a result do not complete timely delivery to A, who sustains $1000 in damages from my breach.  Having obtained an additional profit of $1250 on the sale to B, I am better off even after reimbursing A for his loss.  Society is also better off.  Since B was willing to pay me $.15 per widget, it must mean that each widget was worth at least $.15 to him.  But it was worth only $.14 to A{{spaced ndash}}$.10, what he paid, plus $.04 ($1000 divided by 25,000), his expected profit.  Thus the breach resulted in a transfer of the 25,000 widgets from a lower valued to a higher valued use.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==

Some, such as [[Charles Fried]] in his "Contract as Promise", have argued that morally, A is obligated to honor a contract made with B because A has made a promise. Fried wrote, "The moralist of duty thus posits a general obligation to keep promises, of which the obligation of contract will only be a special case – that special case in which certain promises have attained legal as well as moral force." It would seem that Fried has since revised his interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charles Fried, Contract as Promise, 2.0 — Yonathan Arbel|url = https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/nplblog/2015/09/24/charles-fried-contract-as-promise-2-0-yonathan-arbel/|website = New Private Law|accessdate = 2015-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others argue that the costs of litigation relevant to gaining expectation damages from breach would leave one or both of the original parties worse off than if the contract had simply been performed. Also, Posner's hypothetical assumes that the seller is aware of the value the buyer places on the commodity, or the cost of purchase plus the profits the buyer will make.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenberg, Melvin, Basic Contract Law, 8th ed. West Publishing, 2006, 209-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Electronic Frontier Foundation''' ('''EFF''') is an international non-profit [[digital rights]] group based in [[San Francisco, California]]. The foundation was formed in July, 1990 by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], [[John Perry Barlow]] and [[Mitch Kapor]] to promote [[Internet]] [[civil liberties]].

EFF provides funds for legal defense in court, presents [[amicus curiae]] briefs, defends individuals and new [[Technology|technologies]] from what it considers abusive legal threats, works to expose [[government]] malfeasance, provides guidance to the government and [[court]]s, organizes political action and mass mailings, supports some new technologies which it believes preserve [[Liberty|personal freedoms]] and online civil liberties, maintains a [[database]] and web sites of related news and information, monitors and challenges potential [[legislation]] that it believes would infringe on [[Liberty|personal liberties]] and [[fair use]] and solicits a list of what it considers [[Patent misuse|abusive patents]] with intentions to defeat those that it considers without [[merit (law)|merit]].

EFF also provides tips, tools, how-tos, tutorials, and software for safer online communications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tools from EFF's Tech Team|url=https://www.eff.org/pages/tools}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surveillance Self-Defense|url=https://ssd.eff.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation===
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formed in July 1990 by [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], [[John Perry Barlow]] and [[Mitch Kapor]] in response to a series of actions by law enforcement agencies that led them to conclude that the authorities were gravely uninformed about emerging forms of online communication,&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; and that there was a need for increased protection for [[Internet]] [[civil liberties]].

In April 1990, Barlow had been visited by a U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent in relation to the theft and distribution of the source code for a series of Macintosh ROMs. Barlow described the visit as "complicated by [the agent's] fairly complete unfamiliarity with computer technology. I realized right away that before I could demonstrate my innocence, I would first have to explain to him what guilt might be." Barlow felt that his experience was symptomatic of a "great paroxysm of governmental confusion during which everyone's liberties would become at risk".

Barlow posted an account of this experience to [[The WELL]] online community and was contacted by Mitch Kapor, who had had a similar experience. The pair agreed that there was a need to defend civil liberties on the Internet. Kapor agreed to fund any legal fees associated with such a defense and the pair contacted New York lawyers Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky and Lieberman about defending several computer hackers from a ''Harper's'' magazine forum on computers and freedom who had been the target of [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] raids.&lt;ref name="j1"&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|2003|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generated a large amount of publicity which led to offers of financial support from [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]] and [[Steve Wozniak]]. Barlow and Kapor continued to research conflicts between the government and technology and in June 1990, Barlow posted online the influential article entitled "Crime &amp; Puzzlement" in which Barlow announced his and Kapor's plans to create an organization to "raise and disburse funds for education, lobbying, and litigation in the areas relating to digital speech and the extension of the Constitution into Cyberspace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Crime &amp; Puzzlement |last=Barlow |first=John Perry |author-link=John Perry Barlow |date=June 8, 1990 |url=https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=August 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024192834/http://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/crime_and_puzzlement_1.html |archive-date=2014-10-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This generated further reaction and support for the ideas of Barlow and Kapor. In late June, Barlow held a series of dinners in [[San Francisco]] with major figures in the computer industry to develop a coherent response to these perceived threats. Barlow considered that: "The actions of the FBI and Secret Service were symptoms of a growing social crisis: Future Shock. America was entering the Information Age with neither laws nor metaphors for the appropriate protection and conveyance of information itself."&lt;ref name="barlow-history"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/not_too_brief_history.html |title=A Not Terribly Brief History of the Electronic Frontier Foundation |first=John |last=Barlow |date=November 8, 1990 |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=December 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barlow felt that to confront this a formal organization would be needed; he hired Cathy Cook as press coordinator, and began to set up what would become the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formally founded on July 10, 1990, by Kapor and Barlow, who very soon after elected Gilmore, Wozniak, and [[Stewart Brand]] to join them on the Board of Directors.&lt;ref name="barlow-history" /&gt;  Initial funding was provided by Kapor, Wozniak, and an anonymous benefactor.&lt;ref name="mission"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/SJG/?f=eff_creation.html |title=Formation documents and mission statement for the EFF |date=July 10, 1990 |last1=Kapor |first1=Mitch |author1-link=Mitch Kapor |last2=Barlow |first2=John Perry |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151204082735/http://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/SJG/?f=eff_creation.html |archive-date=2015-12-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://weblogsky.com/technopolitics.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061110200326/http://www.weblogsky.com/technopolitics.htm |archive-date=November 10, 2006 |title=TechnoPolitics |first=Jon |last=Lebkowsky |author-link=Jon Lebkowsky |date=January 11, 1997 |website=Weblogsky |access-date=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, [[Mike Godwin]] joined the organization as its first staff counsel. Then in 1991, [[Esther Dyson]] and [[Jerry Berman]] joined the EFF board of directors. By 1992, Cliff Figallo became the director of the original office, and in December 1992, Jerry Berman became the acting executive director of the organization as a whole, based in a new second office.

===Early cases===
The creation of the organization was motivated by the massive [[search and seizure]] on [[Steve Jackson Games]] executed by the [[United States Secret Service]] early in 1990. Similar but officially unconnected law-enforcement raids were being conducted across the United States at about that time as part of a state–federal task force called [[Operation Sundevil]]. [[GURPS Cyberpunk]], one of the game company's projects, was mistakenly labeled as a handbook for computer crime,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sjgames.com/SS/|title=SJ Games vs. the Secret Service|website=www.sjgames.com|access-date=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Secret Service raided the offices of Steve Jackson Games. The [[search warrant]] for the raid was deemed hastily issued, and the games company soon after claimed unauthorized access as well as tampering of their emails. While phone calls were protected by legislation, digital emails were an early concept and had not been considered to fall under the right to personal privacy. The [[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service|Steve Jackson Games case]] was EFF's first high-profile case, was the major rallying point around which EFF began promoting computer- and Internet-related civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. US Secret Service|date=October 31, 1994|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=3765716184001998475|volume=36|pages=457|accessdate=2018-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EFF's second big case was ''[[Bernstein v. United States]]'' led by [[Cindy Cohn]], in which programmer and professor [[Daniel J. Bernstein]] sued the government for permission to publish his [[encryption]] software, Snuffle, and a paper describing it. More recently, the organization has been involved in defending [[Edward Felten]], [[Jon Lech Johansen]] and [[Dmitry Sklyarov]].

===Expansion and development===
{{refimprove section|date=October 2017}}
[[File:Electronic Frontier Foundation 20th anniversary mecha poster.jpg|thumb|In early 2010, EFF released this poster in celebration of its founding 20 years before.]]

The organization was originally located at Mitch Kapor's Kapor Enterprises offices.&lt;ref name=harris2002&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=Scott |authorlink= |date=2002 |title=Freedom Fighters of the Digital World |url=http://www.latimes.com:80/features/printedition/magazine/la-000003207jan13.story |work=LA Times |location= |access-date=10 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020117210844/http://www.latimes.com:80/features/printedition/magazine/la-000003207jan13.story |archive-date=2002-01-17 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
By the fall of 1993, the main EFF offices were consolidated into a single office,&lt;ref name=harris2002/&gt; 
headed by Executive Director Jerry Berman. 
During this time, some of EFF's attention focused on [[Lobbying|influencing national policy]],&lt;ref name=harris2002/&gt; 
to the dislike of some of the members of the organization.&lt;ref name=harris2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=timberg2013&gt;{{cite news |last=Timberg |first=Craig |authorlink= |date=2013 |title=Try as it might, anti-surveillance group can’t avoid Washington |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/try-as-it-might-anti-surveillance-group-cant-avoid-washington/2013/10/11/2e14c0a0-2142-11e3-b73c-aab60bf735d0_story.html?utm_term=.686050d8ae0c |work=The Washington Post |location= |access-date=10 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012034255/http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/try-as-it-might-anti-surveillance-group-cant-avoid-washington/2013/10/11/2e14c0a0-2142-11e3-b73c-aab60bf735d0_story.html |archive-date=2013-10-12 |dead-url=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1994, Berman parted ways with EFF and formed the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]],&lt;ref name=harris2002/&gt; 
while Drew Taubman briefly took the reins as executive director.

In 1995, under the auspices of Executive Director [[Lori Fena]], 
after some downsizing and in an effort to regroup and refocus on their base of support, 
the organization moved offices to San Francisco, California.&lt;ref name=harris2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=timberg2013/&gt; 
There, it took up temporary residence at [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore's]] Toad Hall, 
and soon afterward moved into the Hamm's Building at 1550 Bryant St. 
After Fena moved onto the EFF board of directors for a while, 
the organization was led briefly by [[Tara Lemmey]], 
followed by Barry Steinhardt 
(who had come from the closely allied Technology and Liberty Program at the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], 
and eventually returned to the ACLU). 
Not long before EFF's move into new offices at 454 Shotwell St. in SF's Mission District, 
Mike Godwin departed, 
long-time Legal Director Shari Steele was appointed as executive director, 
and staff attorney [[Cindy Cohn]] became the legal director.

In the spring of 2006, EFF announced the opening of an office again in Washington, D.C., with two new staff attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Declan |last=McCullagh |author-link=Declan McCullagh |title=EFF reaches out to D.C. with new office | date=2006-04-27 |website=News.CNet.com |publisher=CBS Interactive |url= http://news.cnet.com/2100-1028_3-6065860.html |access-date=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2012, EFF began a fundraising campaign for the renovation of a building located at 815 Eddy Street in San Francisco, to serve as its new headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/pages/eff-eddy | title=The New EFF HQ |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The move was completed in April, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2013/04/eddy-street-era-begins |title=The Eddy Street Era Begins |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On April 1, 2015, Shari Steele stepped down as Executive Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/04/shari-steele-legacy-digital-rights |title=Shari Steele: A Legacy of Digital Rights |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Cindy Cohn became the new executive director, 
Corynne McSherry became the legal director, 
and Kurt Opsahl became the general counsel.

===DES cracker===
{{main|EFF DES cracker}}
By the mid-1990s the EFF was becoming seriously concerned about the refusal of the US Government to license any secure encryption product for export unless it utilized [[key escrow|key recovery]] and claims that governments could not decrypt information when protected by [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], continuing even after the public breaking of the code in the first of the [[DES Challenges]]. They coordinated and supported the construction of the ''EFF DES cracker'' (nicknamed Deep Crack), using special purpose hardware and software and costing only $210,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/HTML/19980716_eff_descracker_pressrel.html |title=EFF DES Cracker Machine Brings Honesty to Crypto Debate |date=July 17, 1998 |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722025129/https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/HTML/19980716_eff_descracker_pressrel.html |archive-date=2012-07-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/HTML/19980716_eff_des_faq.html#sources |title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About the Electronic Frontier Foundation's 'DES Cracker' Machine |date=July 16, 1998 |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=September 11, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120918165854/http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/HTML/19980716_eff_des_faq.html#sources |archive-date=2012-09-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This brought the record for breaking a message down to 56 hours on 17 July 1998 and to under 24 hours on 19 Jan 1999 (in conjunction with [[distributed.net]]).

The EFF published the plans and source code for the cracker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cracking DES - Secrets of Encryption Research, Wiretap Politics &amp; Chip Design|author=Electronic Frontier Foundation|isbn=978-1-56592-520-5|publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]]|year=1998|url=http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781565925205.do}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within four years the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] was standardized as a replacement for DES.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burr|first=William E.|date=2003|title=Selecting the advanced encryption standard.|url=http://users.tricity.wsu.edu/~tyson/stuff/Selecting_the_AES.pdf|journal=IEEE Security &amp; Privacy|volume=99|pages=43–52|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==

===Legislative activity===
The EFF is a leading supporter of the [[Email Privacy Act]].&lt;ref name="Cope"&gt;Sophia Cope, [https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2016/04/house-advances-email-privacy-act-setting-stage-vital-privacy-reform House Advances Email Privacy Act, Setting the Stage for Vital Privacy Reform], Electronic Frontier Foundation (April 27, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Litigation===
[[File:2010 RSA Conference - EFF booth.jpg|thumb|EFF booth at the 2010 RSA Conference]]
{{Main|List of litigation involving the Electronic Frontier Foundation}}
The EFF regularly brings and defends lawsuits at all levels of the US legal system in pursuit of its goals and objectives. The EFF has long taken a stance against [[Strategic lawsuit against public participation|strategic lawsuits against public participation]] (SLAPP) as attempts to stymie free speech and advocated for effective anti-SLAPP legislation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Many of the most significant technology law cases have involved the EFF, including ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.]]'', ''[[Apple v. Does]]'', and others.

===Awards===

The EFF organizes two sets of awards to promote work in accordance with its goals and objectives:

The [[EFF Pioneer Award]]s are awarded annually to recognize individuals who in its opinion are "leaders who are extending freedom and innovation on the electronic frontier."&lt;ref name="Eff Pioneer Awards Website"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/awards/pioneer |title=EFF Pioneer Awards |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the honorees were [[Chelsea Manning]], [[Mike Masnick]] and Annie Game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Whistleblower Chelsea Manning, Techdirt Founder Mike Masnick, and Free Expression Defender Annie Game Named Electronic Frontier Foundation Pioneer Award Winners|url=https://www.eff.org/press/releases/whistleblower-chelsea-manning-techdirt-founder-mike-masnick-and-free-expression|publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=31 August 2017|date=16 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EFF Cooperative Computing Awards are a series of four awards meant "to encourage ordinary Internet users to contribute to solving huge scientific problems," to be awarded to the first individual or group who discovers a prime number with a significant record number of decimal digits. The awards are funded by an anonymous donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/awards/coop |title=EFF Cooperative Computing Awards |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=September 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The awards are:

* $250,000 to the first individual or group who discovers a prime number with at least 1,000,000,000 decimal digits.

===Patent Busting Project===

The [[Patent Busting Project]] is an Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) initiative challenging patents that the organization claims are illegitimate and suppress innovation or limit online expression. The initiative launched on April 19, 2004 and involves two phases: documenting the damage caused by these patents, and submitting challenges to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO).

===Publications===
EFF publishes through several outlets such as the online periodical ''EFFector'' (ISSN 1062-9424),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.eff.org/effector/ |title=EFFector |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |issn=1062-9424 |via=EFF.org |access-date=October 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its websites, blogs, and on social networking services.

EFF's first book was published in 1993 as ''The Big Dummy's Guide to the Internet'', a beginners' how-to manual by contracted [[Technical writing|technical writer]] Adam Gaffin, and made available for free download in many formats. [[MIT Press]] published it in paperback form in 1994 as ''Everybody's Guide to the Internet'' ({{ISBN|9780262571050}}). The online edition was updated regularly throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, and translated into dozens of languages.

The organization's second book, ''Protecting Yourself Online'' ({{ISBN|9780062515124}}), an overview of digital civil liberties, was written in 1998 by technical writer Robert B. Gelman and EFF Communications Director Stanton McCandlish, and published by [[HarperCollins]].

A third book, ''Cracking DES: Secrets of Encryption Research, Wiretap Politics &amp; Chip Design'' ({{ISBN|9781565925205}}), focusing on EFF's DES Cracker project, was published the same year by [[O'Reilly Media]].

A digital book, ''[[Pwn]]ing Tomorrow'', an [[anthology]] of [[speculative fiction]], was produced in 2015 as part of EFF's 25th anniversary activities, and includes contributions from 22 writers, including [[Charlie Jane Anders]], [[Paolo Bacigalupi]], [[Lauren Beukes]], [[David Brin]], [[Pat Cadigan]], [[Cory Doctorow]], [[Neil Gaiman]], [[Eileen Gunn]], [[Kameron Hurley]], [[James Patrick Kelly]], [[Ramez Naam]], [[Annalee Newitz]], [[Hannu Rajaniemi]], [[Rudy Rucker]], [[Lewis Shiner]], [[Bruce Sterling]], and [[Charles Yu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2015/12/eff-publishes-pwning-tomorrow-speculative-fiction-anthology |title=EFF Publishes 'Pwning Tomorrow,' a Speculative Fiction Anthology |first=Dave |last=Maass |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |date=December 16, 2015 |access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Electronic Frontier Foundation's [[blog]], ''DeepLinks'', is a major section of its main website at EFF.org.

The EFF sent a video message of support to global grassroots movement [[CryptoParty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/cryptopartymelb |dead-url=yes |title=Message from EFF San Francisco to Cryptoparty Melbourne |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |via=YouTube |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130719171319/https://www.youtube.com/cryptopartymelb |archive-date=July 19, 2013 |access-date=July 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent activism ===
The EFF was active in the [[United States presidential election 2016]] because of online [[phishing]] related to the controversy over [[Lie#Fabrication|fabrication]] of election results. [[J. Alex Halderman]], a computer security professor at the [[University of Michigan]], wrote an article that was published in [[Medium (website)|''Medium'']] in 2016 stating he thought it was advisable to have a recount on some of the election results from states like [[Wisconsin]], [[Michigan]], and [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@jhalderm/want-to-know-if-the-election-was-hacked-look-at-the-ballots-c61a6113b0ba|title=Want to Know if the Election was Hacked? Look at the Ballots|last=Halderman|first=J. Alex|date=November 23, 2016|website=Medium|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation for Halderman standing up for the uncertain election results, a hacker sent [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] and [[Racism|racist]] emails to students at University of Michigan signed from Halderman. The EFF publicizes these controversies and promotes the reduction of online phishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2017/02/not-okay-professor-smeared-after-advocating-election-integrity|title=Not Okay: Professor Smeared After Advocating for Election Integrity|last=Williams|first=Jamie|date=February 13, 2017|website=Electronic Frontier Foundation|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software==
The EFF has developed some software and browser add-ons, including [[Switzerland (software)|Switzerland]], [[HTTPS Everywhere]], and [[Privacy Badger]].

=== Secure Messaging Scorecard ===
The EFF has also conducted a project named Secure Messaging Scorecard which "evaluated apps and tools based on a set of seven specific criteria ranging from whether messages were encrypted in transit to whether or not the code had been recently audited."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title=Secure Messaging Scorecard|url=https://www.eff.org/secure-messaging-scorecard|publisher=EFF|accessdate=21 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Version 1.0 is accessible [https://www.eff.org/node/82654 here]. {{as of|2017|April|21|df=US}}, a revised version is under development.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Support==

[[Charity Navigator]] has given the EFF an overall rating of four out of four stars, including four stars for its financial efficiency and capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=7576 |title=Electronic Frontier Foundation: Overall Score and Rating |work=[[Charity Navigator]] |access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Financial===

EFF {{as of|2014|lc=y}} had $23 million in assets,&lt;ref name=FY2014/&gt; having received multiple grants or donations above 1 million dollars in its history. On February 18, 2004, the EFF announced that it had received a [[bequest]] of [[United States dollar|US$]]1.2 million from the estate of EFF member Leonard Zubkoff, a software developer and entrepreneur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://w2.eff.org/effector/17/5.php#VI |title=Internet Pioneer Gives Over $1.2 Million to EFF to Defend Online Freedom |website=w2.EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=December 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used $1 million of this money to establish the EFF Endowment Fund for Digital Civil Liberties.

Beginning in 2010, the EFF began regularly receiving income from the [[Humble Indie Bundle]]. In 2010, these donations made up 14% of EFF's total revenue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/07/humble-indie-bundle-epic-win-creators-customers |title=The Humble Indie Bundle: Epic Win for Creators, Customers, and Digital Civil Liberties |first=Richard |last=Esguerra |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |date=July 28, 2011 |access-date=May 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Between 2011 and 2014, the amount received from [[Humble Bundle]] reached $7.5 million or 23% of the EFF total revenues.&lt;ref name="FY2014"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/files/2015/08/06/2014_statement_of_activities.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statement of Activities: July 2013 – June 2014 |date=2014 |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FY2013"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/files/2014/10/29/2013_statement_of_activities.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statement of Activities: July 2012 – June 2012 |date=2013 |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FY2012"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.eff.org/files/2014/10/29/2012_statement_of_activities.pdf |format=PDF |title=Statement of Activities: July 2011 – June 2012 |date=2012 |website=EFF.org |publisher=Electronic Frontier Foundation |access-date=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the EFF received $1 million from [[Google]] as part of a settlement of a class action related to privacy issues involving [[Google Buzz]].
The [[Electronic Privacy Information Center]] and seven other privacy-focused nonprofits protested that the plaintiffs' lawyers and Google had, in effect, arranged to give the majority of those funds "to organizations that are currently paid by Google to lobby for or to consult for the company." An additional $1 million was obtained from [[Facebook]] in a similar settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2012/07/30/google-and-facebooks-new-tactic-in-the-tech-wars/ |title=Google and Facebook's new tactic in the tech wars |last=Parloff |first=Roger |date=July 30, 2012 |work=[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]] |publisher=Time, Inc. |access-date=December 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2014, the [[Adams Charitable Foundation]] granted EFF a $3 million [[Financial endowment|endowment]] to fund the new Adams Chair for Internet Rights.&lt;ref name="FY2014" /&gt;

===Other===

The [[agitprop]] art group Psychological Industries has independently issued buttons with [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Trope (literature)|tropes]] such as the logo of the Laughing Man from the [[anime]] series ''[[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]]'' (with the original ''[[The Catcher in the Rye]]'' quotation replaced with the slogan of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]), a bleeding [[Roller derby|roller derby jammer]], and the "[[We Can Do It!]]" woman (often misidentified as [[Rosie the Riveter]]) on a series of buttons on behalf of the EFF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onemillionbuttonsfordigitalfreedom.com/ |title=Greetings Internet Citizen |website=OneMillionButtonsForDigitalFreedom.com |publisher=Discordia Merchandising |access-date=September 11, 2012 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121004130434/http://www.onemillionbuttonsfordigitalfreedom.com/ |archivedate=October 4, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late June 2014 the EFF flew a GEFA-FLUG AS 105 GD/4&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yro.slashdot.org/story/14/06/27/1927213/protesters-launch-a-135-foot-blimp-over-the-nsas-utah-data-center|title=Protesters Launch a 135-Foot Blimp Over the NSA's Utah Data Center - Slashdot|publisher=Yro.slashdot.org|accessdate=2 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[blimp]] owned by, and in conjunction with, [[Greenpeace]] over the [[NSA]]'s [[Bluffdale, Utah|Bluffdale]]-based [[Utah Data Center]] in protest against its purported illegal spying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.com/2014/06/protestors-launch-a-135-foot-blimp-over-the-nsas-utah-data-center/ |title=Protestors Launch a 135-Foot Blimp Over the NSA's Utah Data Center |first=Andy |last=Greenberg |date=June 27, 2014 |website=[[Wired (website)|Wired.com]] |publisher=Condé Nast Publications |access-date=December 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Yasha Levine]], writing for magazine ''[[The Baffler]]'', described the EFF as [[Astroturfing|astroturf]] created and funded by [[Silicon Valley]], stating they don't actually defend rights for the users of Internet platforms, instead defending large Internet companies (which are, according to him, EFF's biggest benefactors) by lobbying for said companies' interests and deviating attention from their business practices (especially regarding [[copyright]] and [[privacy]]) to government practices regarding privacy and [[censorship]], as well as actually [[lobbying in the United States|lobbying]] in ways that actively harm Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Levine |first=Yasha |date=July 2018 |author-link=Yasha Levine |title=All EFF’d Up |url=https://thebaffler.com/salvos/all-effd-up-levine |magazine=[[The Baffler]] |location=[[New York City|New York]] |publisher=The Baffler Foundation |issue=40 |access-date=July 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180720153706/https://thebaffler.com/salvos/all-effd-up-levine |archive-date=July 20, 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980''' (FIRPTA), enacted as Subtitle C of Title XI (the "Revenue Adjustments Act of 1980") of the '''Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1980''', Pub. L. No. 96-499, 94 Stat. 2599, 2682 (Dec. 5, 1980), is a [[United States]] tax law that imposes [[Income tax in the United States|income tax]] on foreign persons disposing of US [[real property]] interests. Tax is imposed at regular tax rates for the taxpayer on the amount of gain considered recognized. Purchasers of real property interests are required to withhold tax on payment for the property. Withholding may be reduced from the standard 15% to an amount that will cover the tax liability, upon application in advance of sale to the [[Internal Revenue Service]]. FIRPTA overrides most [[nonrecognition provisions]] as well as those remaining tax treaties that provide exemption from tax for such gains.

The 2015 [[omnibus spending bill]] significantly altered the FIRPTA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ropesgray.com/newsroom/alerts/2015/December/Omnibus-Bill-Includes-Significant-Changes-to-Tax-Law-Regarding-FIRPTA-REITs-and-RICs.aspx Ropes&amp;Gray – Omnibus Bill Includes Significant Changes to Tax Law Regarding FIRPTA, REITs, and RICs]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The United States tax law requires all people, whether foreign or domestic, to pay income tax on dispositions of interests in U.S. real estate (U.S. real property interests). Domestic persons are subject to this tax as part of their regular income tax.&lt;ref&gt;Domestic taxable persons (individuals, corporations, estates and trusts) are subject to income tax on taxable income. Taxable income is gross income, with adjustments, less allowable deductions. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/61- 26 USC 61] defines gross income as income from all sources, including specifically gains on dealings in property.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Internal Revenue Code]] sections 897 and 6039C were enacted in FIRPTA;&lt;ref&gt;With respect to sections 897 and 6039C, see FIRPTA sections 1122 and 1123, respectively.&lt;/ref&gt; the Act also made conforming amendments to other various provisions of the Internal Revenue Code.

Foreign people are taxed only on certain items of income, including effectively connected income and certain U.S. source income. Foreign persons, however, are not taxed on most [[capital gains]]. Internal Revenue Code section 897, as enacted by FIRPTA,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/897 26 USC 897], [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/part-1 26 CFR 1.897-1 through -9T].&lt;/ref&gt; treats the gain on a  disposition of an interest in US real property as effectively connected income subject to regular federal income tax.

To ensure tax collection from foreign taxpayers, FIRPTA requires U.S. real property interest buyers to withhold 15% of the sales price. The seller may apply to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) to reduce this 15% to the amount of tax estimated to be due. The IRS routinely and quickly approves such seller applications.

FIRPTA applies in virtually all cases where a foreign owner of a U.S. real property interest disposes of that interest. Provisions of the law preventing recognition of gain generally do not apply unless the seller receives a U.S. real property interest in a qualifying nonrecognition exchange.

==History==
Before 1981, foreign people (nonresident, non citizen individuals, and non-U.S. corporations) often were exempt from U.S. tax on sale of real estate in the nation. Congress passed FIRPTA to require all foreign people to pay tax on dispositions of any interests in U.S. real estate. The law specifically provided that its provisions took precedence over any existing tax treaties that provided otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Under the U.S. Constitution, laws and treaties have equal priority. All treaties were amended since FIRPTA was first considered have specifically permitted U.S. tax on dispositions of real property.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Persons and property subject to tax==
Foreign persons are generally exempt from U.S. tax on capital gains.&lt;ref&gt;''Foreign persons'' includes individuals who are not U.S. citizens or resident aliens, corporations organized outside the United States, and nonresident estates and trusts. See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7701- 26 USC 7701]. Note that partners, not [[partnerships]], are subject to tax, so foreign status is determined at the partner level. See, however, [[withholding tax]] for an overview of exceptions regarding foreign partnerships.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under FIRPTA, however, foreign persons are subject to tax on gains from disposition of U.S. real property interests (USRPIs).
*An '''interest''' in property is any direct equity interest in the property, such as a fee simple ownership, but does not include interests solely as a creditor. Thus, co-owners of property each hold an interest in the property, but a bank holding a mortgage does not.&lt;ref&gt;26 USC 897(c), [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.897-1 26 CFR 1.897-1(c)].&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Real property''' is land, buildings, and land improvements.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.897-1 26 CFR 1.897-1(b).]&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, whether property is or is not real property is determined under U.S. tax law concepts, not state law. Thus, gas pumps and awnings at gas stations are not real property under U.S. Federal tax law, even though they may be realty under state law. For FIRPTA purposes, real property also includes unsevered natural products of the land (''e.g.'', oil and gas in place in the ground, uncut timber, unharvested crops) and personal property associated with the use of real property.&lt;ref&gt;The regulations imply that for personal property to be associated with the use of real property the property must fall into one of four specific categories. The categories relate to natural resource extraction (wells, mines, etc.), construction, providing lodging, and providing office space. See 26 CFR 1.897-1(b)(4).&lt;/ref&gt;
*A '''United States real property interest''' (USRPI) includes shares of a U.S. real property holding corporation (USRPHC). A USRPHC includes any U.S. corporation if more than 50% of such corporation's assets were USRPIs at any testing date.&lt;ref&gt;For a definition of USRPHC, see 26 USC 897(c)(2) and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.897-2 26 CFR 1.897-2].&lt;/ref&gt; Disposition of an interest in a USRPHC is subject to the FIRPTA tax and withholding but is not subject to state income tax. This may be compared with the disposition of a USRPI owned directly, which is subject to the lower federal capital gains rate but is also subject to the state income tax.

==Gain recognition==
Taxpayers generally must recognize gain upon disposing property. Where the proceeds are received in more than one year, the gain is recognized proportionately over the years received.&lt;ref&gt;Under 26 CFR 1.897-1(d)(2)(ii), an installment obligation on sale of a USRPI is treated as a USRPI if the seller does not elect out of the installment gain rules of [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/453- 26 USC 453]. Thus, installment sale treatment applies to foreign persons selling USRPIs.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxpayers exchanging property may not be required to recognize gain on certain transactions, such as like-kind exchanges,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_O_40_III.html 26 USC 1031]&lt;/ref&gt; corporate formations,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_C_40_III_50_A.html 26 USC 351]&lt;/ref&gt; contributions to or distributions from partnerships,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/721- 26 USC 721] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/731- 26 USC 731]&lt;/ref&gt; certain corporate reorganizations,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode26/usc_sup_01_26_10_A_20_1_30_C_40_III_50_B.html 26 USC 354 through 358]&lt;/ref&gt; and certain other transactions. FIRPTA provides that such nonrecognition provisions generally do not apply, and gain must be recognized. Two exceptions apply. First, gain is not recognized if the property received in the exchange is a USRPI which, if disposed of immediately after the exchange, would be subject to FIRPTA. Second, the IRS may provide other exceptions in regulations. Temporary regulations providing very limited exceptions have expired.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.897-6T 26 CFR 1.897-6T].&lt;/ref&gt; Regulations provide limited exceptions treating certain partnership interests as USRPIs, and thus nonrecognition.

==Amount of gain==
Under general U.S. tax principles applicable to FIRPTA, gain is equal to the excess of the amount of money or fair market value of property received over the amount of adjusted basis of the property exchanged.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1001- 26 USC 1001].&lt;/ref&gt; Where the amount received is subject to a contingency, the amount is not recognized until the contingency is resolved.

==Tax imposed==
FIRPTA gain is subject to tax as effectively connected income.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/872- 26 USC 872] and, which excludes most income except effectively connected income from the gross income of nonresident, noncitizen individuals. The non-excluded amounts are subject to the same tax imposed on domestic persons. See note above. See [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/882- 26 USC 882], which explicitly imposes tax on income of a foreign corporation connected with a U.S. trade or business.&lt;/ref&gt; Nonresident alien individuals are subject to tax on such income at regular graduated tax rates for U.S. individuals. The deduction for personal exemptions, certain adjustments to gross income, and most [[itemized deduction]]s are not allowed. Foreign corporations are subject to tax on such income at regular corporate income tax rates. The branch profits tax under Internal Revenue Code section 884 may apply, subject to the branch termination exception. The [[alternative minimum tax]] may also apply.

==Withholding==
As of February 17, 2016, buyers of U.S. real property interests are required to withhold 15% of the full sales price on any purchase of a USRPI; an increase from the previous 10% rate. However, the 10% withholding rate does remain in effect for personal residences valued above $300,000 and below $1 million.&lt;ref name=Savills-Studley&gt;{{cite web |title=2016 Tax Law Changes Affecting Users and Owners of Real Estate |publisher=Savills Studley |url=http://www.savills-studley.com/research/2016-tax-law-changes-affecting-users-and-owners-of-real-estate}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is subject to only four exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1445- 26 USC 1445].&lt;/ref&gt; Withholding is not required:
*By a purchaser for use as a residence for a price $300,000 or less, OR
*Where the purchaser receives a statement from the seller that the seller is a not a foreign person.&lt;ref&gt;The statement must be provided under penalties of perjury. For text of the statement, see [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1445-2 26 CFR 1.1445-2(b)(2)(i) ].&lt;/ref&gt;
*Upon acquisition of an interest in a nonpublicly traded domestic corporation where the corporation provides the required affidavit.
*Upon acquisition of shares of a publicly traded corporation.

To the extent withholding is required, the amount of withholding may be reduced below 10% of the full price only upon certification by the IRS that a reduced amount applies. Such certification is permitted only if the seller applies to the IRS for reduced withholding by filing [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8288b.pdf Form 8288-B] no later than the closing date of the sale.&lt;ref&gt;The IRS generally provides such certification within 30 days when the application contains all required information.&lt;/ref&gt; The certification will specify the proper amount of withholding, subject to the stated closing price.&lt;ref&gt;Where the seller has applied for but not received such certification, prudent buyers will have the full 10% held in escrow at closing. Amounts so held in escrow are not subject to penalties if remitted to the government within 20 days of IRS notice of required withholding.&lt;/ref&gt;

Penalties apply to a purchaser who fails to withhold, file Form 8288 with the IRS,&lt;ref&gt;For filing requirement, see [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/26/6039C.html 26 USC 6039C].&lt;/ref&gt; or pay the required withholding within 20 days of the sale.&lt;ref&gt;For payment requirements, see [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1461- 26 USC 1461] and [https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/26/1.1461-1 26 CFR 1.1461-1].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treaties==
Many U.S. [[tax treaty|tax treaties]] formerly provided exemption from tax for gains on dispositions of many sorts of U.S. real property. FIRPTA specifically provided that such treaty provisions would not apply after a particular date. Most U.S. tax treaties have subsequently been amended to conform with FIRPTA treatment.

'''HappyCow''' is an online service that lists sources of [[vegan]], [[vegetarian]] and healthy food. Access is free to users, who can also provide content. From the original restaurant listings and reviews, HappyCow has expanded to feature information on recipes, travel, health, and other topics.{{citationneeded|date=January 2017}}

==Background and content==

HappyCow was founded in 1999 to create a world guide to vegetarian and vegan restaurants. That objective has since been refined to be to assist, "people everywhere to find vegan, vegetarian, and healthy food".&lt;ref name="Peta2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta2.com/lifestyle/find-vegan-food-anywhere-with-happycow/|title=Find Vegan Food Anywhere With HappyCow|publisher=peta2.com|accessdate=September 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WashingtonPost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/travel/can-you-maintain-a-vegan-diet-while-traveling-yes-but-it-will-take-some-strategizing/2016/03/29/19e08b68-ebbc-11e5-bc08-3e03a5b41910_story.html|title=Can you maintain a vegan diet while traveling? Yes, but it will take some strategizing.|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/wordofmouth/2014/oct/13/spain-taste-for-greens-vegans-vegetarians-flourish|title=Spain gets taste for greens as vegans, vegetarians and vegivores flourish|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; User access is free to encourage crowd-sourced content provision. The number of listings has expanded to over 50,000 businesses in over 175 countries around the world. Reviews of these listings number over 150,000.{{citationneeded|date=January 2017}} Restaurants remain the core listings group and are categorised as either, vegan, vegetarian, or veg-friendly. The initial definition for veg-friendly was based on a minimum menu content being at least 60% vegetarian. This has since been modified into a more flexible set of guidelines based on the alternative availability of vegan food in the area. HappyCow's orientation in general has gravitated over time to be increasingly pro-vegan.

Other listings additionally include health food shops, juice bars, vegan friendly accommodation, social and activity groups, catering operations and other entities with consideration for animal compassion. Subscription for a free newsletter is available. The website has well established forum and blog sections allowing users to publish relevant material.{{citationneeded|date=January 2017}}

The HappyCow [[Youtube]] channel was launched in 2012. Features have covered numerous vegan and vegetarian events worldwide, and included interviews.

==Financing==
HappyCow is a [[Open knowledge|free-to-use]], not-for-profit organization in nature but without [[501(c) organization|501-c]] status. Income generated is recycled into the running of the operation. Early sources of website funding were advertisement, business sponsorship, and user contributions. The worldwide trend to mobile computing has allowed a revenue stream of sales of native IOS and Android apps.&lt;ref name="Gadgetwise"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadgetwise.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/09/app-smart-extra-restricted-diets/?_r=0|title=App Smart Extra: Restricted Diets|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=September 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014 ''The HappyCow Cookbook: Recipes from Top-Rated Vegan Restaurants around the World'' was published for sale.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1974">The '''House of Commons Qualification Act 1838''' (1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. 48) was an [[Act of Parliament]] in the [[United Kingdom]], signed into law on 27 July 1838.

It repealed the [[Qualification of Members of House of Commons Act 1759]] and the [[Parliament Act 1710]].

The Act provided that no person would be capable of being elected as a member of the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] for any [[county constituency|county]], unless he possessed an estate, or other income, of the clear annual value of £600 over and above any encumbrances. The same provision applied to members for [[Borough constituency|cities or boroughs]], and the [[Cinque Ports]], except that in these cases the income needed only be £300 per annum.

Candidates at elections were, if required, to declare to the returning officer (or a commissioner or a justice) that they possessed such estate; this would be certified under a penalty of £100 for a false declaration. If the declaration was found to be false on the advice of an informer, then they would obtain half the penalty.

Every member was to deliver a statement of qualification to the table of the House of Commons and make such a declaration before they could take their seat or vote; a false declaration would make them guilty of a misdemeanour.

If the member took his seat, or voted, before complying with the provisions of this Act, then his election would be considered void. The Act did not extend to the members for [[university constituencies]], or to the eldest sons of peers.

[[File:Harvard_Law_School_Library_in_Langdell_Hall_at_night.jpg|thumb|Langdell Hall at night, viewed from Holmes Field]]

'''Langdell Hall''' is the largest building of [[Harvard Law School]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. It is home to the school's library, the largest academic law library in the world, and is named for pioneering law school dean [[Christopher C. Langdell]]. It is built in a modified [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] style. 

The building was commissioned in 1905 by law school dean [[James Barr Ames]], as the school was outgrowing [[H.H. Richardson]]'s [[Austin Hall (Harvard University)|Austin Hall]]. It was designed by Richardson's successor, the firm [[Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge]]. The southern wing of the current building was completed and occupied by 1907. The same firm, rechristened [[Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch and Abbott]], completed the northern and western wings in 1929. 

In 1959, the International Legal Studies building, now the Lewis International Law Center, was constructed to house approximately 300,000 volumes in open-stacks. 

In 1997, [[Coolidge, Shepley, Bulfinch and Abbott]] was appointed once again, this time to renovate the building. The renovations expanded the library, which now takes up most of the building, with the exception of two classrooms- the Vorenberg and Kirkland &amp; Ellis. The renovation also included the installation of air conditioning and additional women's restrooms.

Other notable parts of the building include the Caspersen Room, named for HLS alumnus [[Finn M. W. Caspersen]] (J.D. 1966). The Caspersen Room, formerly called the Treasure Room, once housed part of the library's collection of rare books and manuscripts. The lobby of the building is graced by a statue of [[Joseph Story]], Harvard professor and Supreme Court justice, sculpted by his son, [[William Wetmore Story]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4167">This is a '''list of countries by consultation on rule-making''', measuring [[government transparency]], an important component in measuring [[quality of life]] and the [[well-being]] of its citizens. The indicator published by the [[OECD]] for 2008 is a weighted average of yes/no answers to various questions on the existence of law consultation by citizens, of formal procedures enabling general public to impact regulation and governmental actions. The indicator describes the extent to which formal consultation processes are built in at key stages of the design of regulatory proposals, and what mechanisms exist for the outcome of that consultation to influence the preparation of draft primary laws and subordinate regulations.

This indicator has been computed based on responses to the [[OECD]]'s survey of regulatory management systems, where respondents were government officials in OECD countries. It is based on questions about the existence of formal procedures enabling general public, business and civil society organisations to impact regulation and governmental actions, and on whether citizens’ views on such consultation procedures are made public.

| Peter Norwood Duberg
| Switzerland
| United States citizen, United Nations official, employed in Paris at [[UNESCO]]
| For reasons of his early adulthood membership in the Communist Party, Duberg, along with several other U.S. citizens working in international organizations, became the subject of U.S. official investigation in the early 1950s. This led to a loyalty investigation by the U.S. State Department in 1953, also his name being discussed in the U.S. Congress House Committee on un-American Activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/scopeofsovietact3840unit/scopeofsovietact3840unit_djvu.txt |title=Full text of "Scope of Soviet activity in the United States.

This resulted in decisions taken which led to termination of his professional employment at the United Nations in 1954 and eventual need for political asylum, which was granted in Switzerland.

'''Lufthansa Flight 181''' was a [[Boeing]] [[Boeing 737|737–230 Adv]] aircraft named ''Landshut'' that was [[aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] on 13 October 1977 by four members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], who called themselves Commando Martyr Halima. The objective of the hijacking was to secure the release of imprisoned [[Red Army Faction]] leaders. On 18 October the aircraft was stormed by the [[West German]] counter-terrorism group [[GSG 9]] in [[Mogadishu]], [[Somali Democratic Republic|Somalia]], and all 90 passengers rescued. The rescue operation was codenamed ''Feuerzauber'' (German term for "Fire Magic"). The hijacking is considered to be part of the [[German Autumn]]. 

In 2017 the German government purchased the aircraft involved (D-ABCE), and a complex logistic operation was set in motion to transport it back to Germany. Lufthansa Technik specialists flew to Brazil to disassemble the aircraft and fit the different parts in a giant Antonov cargo airplane and an accompanying Ilyushin Il-76. Once back home, it will be reassembled at the Dornier museum in Friedrichshafen, where it is going to be fully restored (cleaned, refurbished, repainted) and displayed in its original 1977 Lufthansa livery. The project is expected to be completed in October 2022.

==Lufthansa crew==
Two flight crew and three cabin crew operated the round-trip flight from [[Frankfurt]] to [[Palma de Mallorca]]:

; {{Interlanguage link multi|Jürgen Schumann|de}} (37)
: ''Captain'' – born at [[Colditz]] in 1940, a former [[German Air Force|Luftwaffe]] Lockheed [[F-104 Starfighter]] pilot. On 16 October at [[Aden International Airport|Aden Airport]], after being permitted to leave the aircraft to check the plane's airworthiness, he went to talk to authorities. He subsequently returned and was then murdered by terrorist leader Akache. Posthumously awarded the [[German Federal Cross of Merit]] 1st class, he was survived by his wife and two sons. The building housing the Lufthansa Pilot School in [[Bremen]] was named in his honour, as was a street in the [[Bavaria]]n city of [[Landshut]]. He is buried in [[Babenhausen, Hesse|Babenhausen]] in Hesse.
; {{Interlanguage link multi|Jürgen Vietor|de}} (35)
: ''Co-Pilot'' – born at [[Kassel]] in 1942, a former German Navy pilot. He piloted the ''Landshut'' from [[Aden]] to [[Mogadishu]]. He returned to work just six weeks after the hijacking, and the first aircraft he was assigned to was the ''Landshut'' which had already been returned to service. He retired in 1999. He was also awarded the [[German Federal Cross of Merit]] 1st Class. He subsequently returned the medal in December 2008 in protest over the release on probation of former [[Red Army Faction]] terrorist [[Christian Klar]], who had been involved in the kidnap and murder of [[Hanns Martin Schleyer]] in 1977.
; Hannelore Piegler (33)
: ''Chief Stewardess''.
; Anna-Maria Staringer (28)
: ''Stewardess''.
; [[Gabriele von Lutzau|Gabriele Dillmann]] (23)
: ''Stewardess''. She was dubbed "the angel of Mogadishu" by the German press. Like Schumann and Vietor she was awarded the [[German Federal Cross of Merit]]. She subsequently married Lufthansa pilot Rüdeger von Lutzau. As [[Gabriele von Lutzau]] she has acquired an international reputation as a sculptor (principally of figures in beechwood), and has exhibited in numerous exhibitions in Germany and throughout Europe.

==Key German rescue personnel==

; Colonel [[Ulrich Wegener]] (48)
: Federal Border Protection (''[[Bundesgrenzschutz]]'') officer who was the liaison officer with the German Interior Ministry at the time of the [[Munich massacre]] by the PLO near during the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]]. He was subsequently appointed by the West German government to establish and lead an elite anti-terrorist squad. The unit was officially established on 17 April 1973 as a part of Germany's federal border guard service and the name [[GSG 9]] stood for ''Grenzschutzgruppe 9'' (border guard group 9) and was chosen simply because the ''Bundesgrenzschutz'' already had eight regular border guard groups. Wegener was trained by both the British [[Special Air Service|SAS]] and the Israeli [[Sayeret Mat'kal]] who were the only known established anti-terrorist units in the world at that time. He also participated in the rescue of Israeli hostages in [[Operation Entebbe]] in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;de B. Tallion, Paul J (2002). ''Hijacking and hostages: government responses to terrorism''. Greenwood Publishing Group, p. 109. {{ISBN|0-275-97468-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Wegener planned and commanded the GSG 9 Operation Fire Magic to successfully rescue the ''Landshut'' hostages at Mogadishu. After his retirement from GSG 9, Wegener worked as a consultant to help establish counter-terrorism units for various foreign countries. Wegener was a member of the KÖTTER GmbH &amp; Co. KG Verwaltungsdienstleistungen Security Committee. He died on 28 December 2017.
; Major Klaus Blatte (38)
: Deputy Commander of GSG 9 in 1977 and one of the four assault squad leaders that stormed the ''Landshut'' at Mogadishu. When Wegener retired, he succeeded him as the next Commander of GSG 9.
; Minister [[Hans-Jürgen Wischnewski]] (55)
: Minister of State at the Federal Chancellery who was designated by Chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]] as his special envoy to coordinate the political negotiations with the various foreign governments to facilitate the release or rescue of the ''Landshut'' hostages. Due to his excellent contacts and personal relationships with Arab leaders he was nicknamed "Ben Wisch" by the German press. He lost office after the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|CDU]] regained power in 1982 and became a travelling consultant to [[Arab world|Arab]], African and South American countries advising them on negotiating techniques and pacification policies to deal with terrorist and insurgent groups. He died in 2005.
; Chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]] (59)
: [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|German Federal Chancellor]] between 1974 and 1982 (''Bundeskanzler'') who adopted a tough, uncompromising stance over the kidnapping of [[Hanns-Martin Schleyer]] and the Lufthansa 181 hijacking in 1977. He authorised the GSG 9 mission to rescue the ''Landshut'' hostages and his anti-terrorist policies were successful in overcoming the long-standing threat that had been posed by the [[Red Army Faction]]. After retiring from the [[Bundestag]] in 1986 he was one of the founders of the committee supporting the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|EMU]] and the creation of the [[European Central Bank]]. He died in 2015.

== Hijacking ==
At 11:00 on Thursday 13 October 1977, [[Lufthansa]] flight LH 181, a [[Boeing 737]] named ''Landshut'', took off from [[Palma de Mallorca]] ''en route'' to [[Frankfurt]] with 86 passengers and five crew, piloted by Jürgen Schumann, with co-pilot Jürgen Vietor at the controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About 30 minutes later, as it passed over [[Marseilles]], the aircraft was hijacked by four militants calling themselves "Commando Martyr Halima" – in honour of fellow militant [[Brigitte Kuhlmann]], who had been killed in [[Operation Entebbe]] the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their leader was a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] named Zohair Youssif Akache (23, male), who adopted the [[pseudonym|alias]] "Captain Martyr Mahmud". The other three were [[Souhaila Andrawes|Suhaila Sayeh]] (22, female), a Palestinian, and two [[Lebanese people]], Wabil Harb (23, male) and Hind Alameh (22, female).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Akache ("Mahmud") burst into the cockpit with a loaded pistol in his hand and ordered Vietor to join the passengers, leaving Schumann to take over the flight controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahmud ordered Schumann to fly to [[Larnaca]] in [[Cyprus]] but was told that they had insufficient fuel and would have to land in [[Rome]] first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rome===
The aircraft changed course and landed in Rome for refuelling. Acting in concert with the [[Red Army Faction]] group, the Siegfried Hausner Commando, who had kidnapped West German industrialist [[Hanns Martin Schleyer]] five weeks earlier, demanded the release of 10 Red Army Faction (RAF) terrorists detained at the [[JVA Stuttgart-Stammheim]] prison plus two Palestinian compatriots held in [[Turkey]] and US$15 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; German Interior Minister [[Werner Maihofer]] contacted his Italian counterpart [[Francesco Cossiga]] and suggested that the plane's tyres should be shot out to prevent the aircraft from leaving. After consulting his colleagues Cossiga decided that the most desirable solution for the [[Italian government]] was to get rid of the problem altogether. The aircraft was refuelled, which enabled Mahmud to instruct Vietor (who had been allowed back into the cockpit on the ground) to take off for Larnaca at 17:45 without even obtaining clearance from Rome [[air traffic control]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Larnaca===
The ''Landshut'' landed in [[Larnaca]], Cyprus, at 20:28. After about an hour, a local [[PLO]] representative arrived at the airport and over the radio tried to persuade Mahmud to release the hostages. This only provoked a furious response from Mahmud who started screaming at him over the intercom in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] until the PLO representative gave up and left. The aircraft was then refuelled and Schumann asked flight control for a routing to [[Beirut]]. He was told that [[Beirut Airport]] was blocked and closed to them and Mahmud just said to him that they would go to [[Damascus]] instead. The ''Landshut'' took off at 22:50 heading for Beirut but was refused landing permission. After also being denied landing permission in Damascus, [[Baghdad]], and [[Kuwait]] they headed for [[Bahrain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bahrain===
Schumann was told by a passing [[Qantas]] airliner that [[Bahrain International Airport|Bahrain Airport]] was closed. He radioed flight control and told them they had insufficient fuel to go elsewhere and despite being told again that the airport was closed he was suddenly given an automatic landing frequency by the flight controller. They finally landed in Bahrain at 01:52 the following morning. On arrival the aircraft was immediately surrounded by armed troops and Mahmud radioed the tower that unless they were withdrawn he would shoot the co-pilot. After a stand-off with the tower, with Mahmud setting a five‑minute deadline and holding a pistol to Vietor's head, the troops were subsequently withdrawn. The aircraft was then refuelled and they took off for [[Dubai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dubai===
Approaching Dubai, they were again refused landing permission. Overflying the [[Dubai International Airport|Dubai airport]] in the early light of dawn they could see that the runway was blocked with trucks and fire engines. Running short of fuel Schumann told the tower they would have to land anyway. As they made a low pass over the airport they saw that the obstacles were being removed, and at 05:40 (14 October) Vietor was able to make a normal landing on the main runway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Dubai, the terrorists asked the tower to supply water, food, medicine, newspapers, and to take away the rubbish. Captain Schumann was able to communicate the number of hijackers on board as well as specifying that they were two men and two women.&lt;ref&gt;Schumann: "Could you get us four cartons with cigarettes?" – Tower: "Ok, any type?" – Schumann: "Mixed. Different ones. Two of these and two of these maybe." – Tower: "Roger, ok. Mixed." [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xOeCaC26mRI&amp;feature=endscreen original radio communication from documentary "Mogadischu. Die Dokumentation.", Youtube, (2:55–3:09)]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with journalists, this information was revealed by Dubai's [[Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum|Sheikh Mohammed]], then Minister of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/topicalbumbackground/2865/luegen_unter_freunden.html|title=Neue Dokumente zur Landshut-Entführung|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|accessdate=18 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hijackers learned about this, possibly from the radio, causing Mahmud to threaten to kill Schumann. The aircraft remained on the ground at Dubai all through the day and night. The following morning Mahmud threatened to start shooting hostages if the aircraft was not refuelled and the Dubai authorities finally agreed. In the meantime, both [[Hans-Jürgen Wischnewski]], the [[West German]] minister responsible for handling the hijacking, and Colonel [[Ulrich Wegener]], commander of the elite German anti-terrorist squad [[GSG 9]], had arrived in Dubai to try to persuade the government to agree to let GSG 9 commandos into Dubai to storm the aircraft. However, after permission was granted for GSG 9 commandos to storm the aircraft, SAS and GSG 9 senior operatives insisted on additional combat exercise and dry-runs on an adjacent airstrip. Reports suggest up to 45 hours of training was conducted whilst based in Dubai (over a period of 80 hours). While Wegener was considering his options, the ''Landshut'' had completed its refuelling and at 00:20 (17 October) it took off, heading for [[Salalah]] in [[Oman]], where landing permission was once again denied, and a course to [[Aden]] in [[South Yemen]], at the limit of their fuel range, was established.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aden===
In Aden they were yet again denied landing permission, this time at [[Aden International Airport]], and the two main runways were blocked by vehicles. The plane was running low on fuel so the pilot Vietor had no choice but to make an emergency landing on a sand strip almost parallel to both runways. The Aden authorities told the hijackers that they would have to leave but the two pilots were sceptical of the condition of the aircraft after an emergency landing on sandy ground. Mahmud consequently gave Schumann permission to leave the aircraft in order to check the condition of the landing gear following the rough landing, and the engines. However Schumann did not immediately return to the plane after the inspection, even after numerous attempts to recall him or even a threat to blow up the aircraft on the ground. The reasons for his prolonged absence remain unclear and some reports suggest that Schumann asked the Yemeni authorities to prevent the continuation of the flight and to accede to the terrorists' demands.&lt;ref name=bws&gt;[http://www.focus.de/politik/deutschland/raf/raf-mord_aid_130546.html onlineFocus from 08-25-2007].

After this Schumann returned to the aircraft to face the wrath of Mahmud, who forced him to kneel on the floor in the passenger cabin and then shot him in the head without giving him a chance to explain himself.&lt;ref name="bws"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bwt"/&gt; The plane was refuelled at 06:00 on 17 October and, coaxed by co-pilot Jürgen Vietor, it slowly and laboriously took off from Aden on course for the [[Somalia|Somali]] capital of [[Mogadishu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mogadishu===
At around 06:22 local time, the ''Landshut'' made an unannounced and perfect landing at [[Aden Adde International Airport|Aden Adde airport]] in Mogadishu. The leader Mahmud (Akache) told Vietor that he had performed a super-human accomplishment and that consequently he was free to leave the aircraft, since they were not planning to fly elsewhere. However Vietor opted to remain with the onboard passengers and crew. Schumann's body was thrown onto the tarmac and an ultimatum was set for the RAF prisoners to be released by 16:00 local time or the aircraft would be blown up. After they had poured the [[duty-free]] [[Liquor|spirits]] over the hostages in preparation for the destruction of the aircraft, the hijackers were told that the West German government had agreed to release the RAF prisoners but that their transfer to Mogadishu would take several more hours, so they agreed to extend the deadline to 02:30 the next morning (18 October).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, while the West German [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic of Germany)|Chancellor]] [[Helmut Schmidt]] attempted to negotiate an agreement with [[President of Somalia|Somali President]] [[Siad Barre]], special envoy [[Hans-Jürgen Wischnewski]] and [[GSG 9]] commander [[Ulrich Wegener]] arrived at Mogadishu airport from [[Jeddah]] in a Lufthansa aircraft co-piloted by Rüdiger von Lutzau (Gabriele Dillmann's fiancé). In West Germany, a team of 30 GSG 9 commandos under their deputy commander Major Klaus Blatte had assembled at Hangelar airfield near [[Bonn]] awaiting instructions. The commandos took off from [[Cologne-Bonn Airport]] on a [[Boeing 707]] on Monday morning (17 October) planning to fly to [[Djibouti]], within a short flying time of Somalia, while Schmidt negotiated with the Somalis. When they were flying over [[Ethiopia]], agreement was reached and permission was given to land at Mogadishu. The aircraft landed at 20:00 local time with all lights out to avoid detection by the hijackers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After four hours to unload all of their equipment and to undertake the necessary reconnaissance, Wegener and Blatte finalized the assault plan, scheduled to start at 02:00 local time. They decided to approach from the rear of the aircraft in its [[Blind spot (vehicle)|blind spot]] in six teams using black-painted aluminium ladders to gain access to the aircraft through the escape hatches under the fuselage and via the doors over the wings. In the meantime a fictitious progress report on the journey being taken by the released prisoners was being fed to Mahmud by the German representatives in the airport tower. Just after 02:00, Mahmud was told that the plane carrying the prisoners had just departed from [[Cairo]] after refuelling and he was asked to provide the conditions of the prisoner/hostage exchange over the radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several minutes before the rescue, Somali soldiers lit a fire {{convert|60|m}} in front of the jet, as a diversionary tactic, prompting Akache and two of the other three hijackers to rush to the cockpit to observe what was going on, and isolating them from the hostages in the cabin.&lt;ref&gt;''Middle Eastern terrorism: from Black September to 11 September'', by Mark Ensalaco, pg 116&lt;/ref&gt; At 02:07 local time, the GSG 9 commandos silently climbed up the blackened aluminium ladders and opened the emergency doors, Wegener, at the head of one group, opened the forward door, and two other groups, led by Sergeant-Major Dieter Fox and Sergeant Joachim Huemmer stormed the aircraft by using the ladders to climb up onto the wings and opened both emergency doors at the same time. Shouting in German for the passengers and crew to get down to the floor, the commandos shot and killed two of the terrorists (Wabil Harb and Hind Alameh), and wounded Zohair Akache and [[Souhaila Andrawes|Suhaila Sayeh]]. Akache died of his injuries hours later. One GSG 9 commando was wounded by return fire from the terrorists. Three passengers and a flight attendant were slightly wounded in the crossfire. An American passenger aboard the plane described the rescue: "I saw the door open and a man appears. His face was painted black and he starts shouting in German 'We're here to rescue you, get down!' and they started shooting."&lt;ref name="upi.com"&gt;http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Sadat-Visits-Israel/12361881614363-1/#title "1977 Year in Review – Sadat Visits Israel". {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090709192920/http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Sadat-Visits-Israel/12361881614363-1/#title |date=9 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergency escape chutes were deployed and passengers and crew were ordered to quickly evacuate the aircraft. At 02:12 local time, just five minutes after the assault had commenced, the commandos radioed: ''"Frühlingszeit! Frühlingszeit!"'' ("Springtime! Springtime!"), which was the code word for the successful completion of the operation. A few moments later a radio signal was sent to Chancellor Schmidt in [[Bonn]]: "Four opponents down – hostages free – four hostages slightly wounded – one commando slightly wounded".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
News of the rescue of the hostages was followed by the deaths of RAF members [[Andreas Baader]], [[Gudrun Ensslin]], and [[Jan-Carl Raspe]] at JVA Stuttgart-Stammheim. RAF member [[Irmgard Möller]] also attempted suicide but survived her injuries. On Wednesday 19 October the body of Hanns-Martin Schleyer, who had been kidnapped by the RAF some five weeks prior to the hijacking, was found in the trunk of a car on a side street in [[Mulhouse]] after the RAF heard of the deaths of their comrades. They contacted the Paris newspaper ''[[Libération]]'' to announce his 'execution'; a subsequent [[post-mortem examination]] indicated that he had been killed the previous day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''Landshut'' crisis the German government stated that it would never again negotiate with terrorists (as it previously had with the [[Lufthansa Flight 649]] and [[Lufthansa Flight 615|615]] hijackers). Chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]] was widely praised among western countries for his decision to storm the aircraft to rescue the hostages, although some criticized the risk-taking act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Die Geiseln vom Mogadischu|url=https://www.swr.de/betrifft/die-geiseln-von-mogadischu/-/id=98466/did=20206006/nid=98466/835b7q/index.html |publisher=SWR|accessdate=25 September 2017|date=25 September 2017|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The aircraft==
[[File:B737.jpg|thumb|305px|[[B737-200]] dismounted in [[Hangar]] stored]]

While the hijackers had control of the plane it had travelled {{convert|10000|km}}.&lt;ref name="upi.com"/&gt; The ''Landshut'' is a [[Boeing 737]]-230C (manufacturers serial number 20254, Boeing line number 230, [[Aircraft registration|registration]] {{Airreg|D|ABCE}}) named after the city of [[Landshut]] in Bavaria. The damaged aircraft was ferried back to Germany, repaired, and returned to service in late November 1977, and it continued to fly for Lufthansa for 8 more years until September 1985 when the plane was sold to new US carrier [[Presidential Airways (scheduled)|Presidential Airways]], after it changed hands several times, ultimately ending up in the fleet of Brazilian carrier [[TAF Linhas Aéreas]] for US$ 4,708,268 from ''Transmille Air Services'' of [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Under the contract, TAF agreed to pay US$ 200,000 as a deposit before receiving the aircraft, plus US$ 149,250 thirty days after delivery of the Boeing and 32 installments of US$ 135,000 thereafter. The Brazilian company, because of financial problems and bankruptcy, was unable to continue paying the debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.opovo.com.br/jornal/dom/2017/06/sequestro-lufthansa-de-volta-para-alemanha.html|title=Sequestro Lufthansa.

==Use of the name 'Landshut' in other airplanes==

The name was used by Lufthansa on other three planes after 1985:
* [[Boeing 737#Boeing 737-200|Boeing 737-200]] ''D-ABHM'',
* [[Airbus A319-100]] ''D-AILK'',
* [[Airbus A330|A330-300]] ''D-AIKE'' since 2007 (registration: D-AIKE, manufacturer's serial number 636).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.charliebravo.de/lhtaufnamen/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable hostages==
* [[Horst-Gregorio Canellas]], German football official responsible for breaking the [[Bundesliga scandal (1971)|1971 Bundesliga scandal]] was one of the hostages on board, together with his daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/sport/fussball/bundesliga-zentralfigur-des-bundesliga-skandals-ist-tot-a-32710.html|title=Bundesliga: Zentralfigur des Bundesliga-Skandals ist tot|date=23 July 1999|website=spiegel.de|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|access-date= 2 July 2016|language=German|trans-title=Bundesliga: Central figure of the Bundesliga scandal has died}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The song "122 Hours of Fear" by [[The Screamers]], recorded in 1978, was inspired by the hijacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Screamers|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Screamers |publisher=Wikipedia||date=17 October 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

The song "RAF" by [[Brian Eno]] and Snatch ([[Judy Nylon]]/Patti Palladin) was created using sound elements from a [[Baader Meinhof]] ransom message available by public telephone at the time of the hijacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Judy Nylon|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judy_Nylon |publisher=Wikipedia||date=17 October 2017|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=November 2017}}

The hijacking and the hostage rescue operation were portrayed in two German television films: ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Todesspiel|de}}'' (''The Death Game'') in 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0118493|Todesspiel}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mogadischu]]'', directed by [[Roland Suso Richter]], in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|tt1153112|Mogadischu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hijacking and rescue was also portrayed in the ''Black Ops'' television series, season 2 episode 76, titled "Operation Fire Magic".&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|tt3890758|Operation Fire Magic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege|Rainbow Six: Siege]], a 2015 counter-terrorism video game, used Lufthansa Flight 181, along with other historical hostage extraction operations, as inspiration for the game and as research for making the game more accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/2014/10/21/7033719/how-rainbow-six-siege-takes-inspiration-from-real-life-hostage-rescues|title=How Rainbow Six: Siege takes inspiration from real life hostage rescues|last=Campbell|first=Colin|date=2014-10-21|website=Polygon|access-date=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USACE-District-Map.jpg|right|300px|thumb|USACE Mississippi Valley Division, shown in blue]]

The [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] '''Mississippi Valley Division''' ('''MVD''') is responsible for the Corps water resources programs within 370,000-square-miles of the [[Mississippi River Valley]], as well as the watershed portions of the [[Red River of the North]] that are within the United States.  It excludes the entire watersheds of the [[Missouri River]] and [[Ohio River]], and portions of the [[Arkansas River]] and the [[Red River of the South]], but otherwise encompasses the entire [[Mississippi River]] from [[Lake Itasca]], Minnesota, to the Gulf of Mexico.  The district includes all or parts of 13 states: Arkansas, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, North Dakota, Tennessee, Wisconsin, and South Dakota.

The mission of the division is to serve the Mississippi Valley region by managing the watersheds and  developing collaborative engineering solutions that will reduce risks through the reduction of flood damage potential, maintain and enhance navigation, and protect,  restore and enhance environmental ecosystems;  while being prepared to respond to regional and national emergencies. Additionally, MVD operates hydroelectric plants within the system, is a large water and construction regulatory body, and maintains over 1.9 million acres for recreation. MVD, and specifically the New Orleans District, is responsible for the design and construction of the [[Hurricane &amp; Storm Damage Risk Reduction System]] (HSDRRS) which seeks to provide 100 Year storm protection to the City of New Orleans. 

==Overview==
The Mississippi Valley Division is made up of six districts, based in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], [[Rock Island, Illinois]], [[St. Louis, Missouri]], [[Memphis, Tennessee]], [[Vicksburg, Mississippi]], and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].

The Division Commander is directly responsible to the [[Chief of Engineers]]. Within the authorities delegated, MVD Commander directs and supervises the individual District Commanders. MVD duties include preparing engineering studies and design, constructing, operating, and maintaining flood control and river and harbor facilities and installations, administering the laws on civil works activities, acquiring, managing, and disposing of real estate, and mobilization support of military, natural disaster, and national emergency operations.

==Mississippi River Commission==
[[File:Mississippi Project Design Flood.tif|thumbnail|left|The MR&amp;T Project Design Flood]]
[[File:MRC Boundaries.png|thumb|MRC Area of Jurisdiction outlined in red]]
The Mississippi River Commission was established in 1879 to facilitate improvement of the Mississippi River from the [[Head of Passes]] near its [[river delta|mouth]] to its headwaters. The stated mission of the Commission was to develop and implement plans to correct, permanently locate, and deepen the channel of the Mississippi River, improve safety and ease of navigation, prevent destructive floods. and promote and facilitate commerce, trade, and the postal service.

For nearly a half century, the MRC functioned as an executive body reporting directly to the U.S. Secretary of War. The [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]] changed the mission of the MRC. The consequent [[Flood Control Act of 1928]] created the [[Mississippi River and Tributaries Project]] (MR&amp;T). The act assigned responsibility for developing and implementing the Mississippi River and Tributaries Project (MR&amp;T) to the Mississippi River Commission. The MR&amp;T project provides for control of floods of the Mississippi River from Head of Passes to vicinity of [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri]], control of floods of the [[Mississippi_River#Watershed|tributaries]] and [[Mississippi River Delta|outlets]] of the Mississippi River as they are affected by its backwaters, and improvement for navigation of the Mississippi River from [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]], to [[Cairo, Illinois]]. This includes improvements to certain harbors and improvement for navigation of [[Old River Control Structure|Old]] and [[Atchafalaya River]]s from the Mississippi River to [[Morgan City, Louisiana]].

It also includes bank stabilization of the Mississippi River from the Head of Passes to [[Cairo, Illinois]], preservation, restoration, and enhancement of environmental resources, including but not limited to measures for fish and wildlife, increased water supplies, recreation, cultural resources, and other related water resources development programs, and semi-annual inspection trips to observe river conditions and facilitate coordination with local interests in implementation of projects. For over a century the inspections and hearings have been held aboard the [[MV Mississippi|M/V ''Mississippi'']] and its predecessors.

There are seven members on the commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/national/mississippi-river-infrastructure/|title=The struggle to control the Mississippi can help us understand the U.S.|last=Frankel|first=Todd C.|date=14 March 2018|website=Washington Post|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current President of the Mississippi River Commission is U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Major General Kaiser. The mission is executed through the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] Mississippi Valley Division Districts in St. Paul, Rock Island, St. Louis, Memphis, Vicksburg, and New Orleans.

The headquarters of the operation is in Historic Downtown Vicksburg in the Mississippi River Commission Building.

In his introduction to Islamic Law, Wael B. Hallaq does not use the term ''Muamalat'', but also writes of Islamic law being divided into "four major fields" or "quarters", one of which is "sales". It includes not only laws on buying and selling but also on "partnerships, guaranty, gifts and bequests". &lt;blockquote&gt;"Generally, Muslim jurists gave the main topics of law the title ''kitab'' (“book”), e.g., the Book of Agency, which, in our modern organizational scheme, we recognize as a chapter. A sub-chapter was termed “bab,” which would in turn be broken into a number of fasls (sections). Many jurists conceived of the whole of Islamic law as falling into four major fields, which were called “the four quarters,” i.e., “rituals, sales, marriage and injuries.” Each of these terms, used in this context metaphorically, stands for a staggering variety of subjects that belong to a single quarter. Thus, the “quarter of sales” would encompass, among many other subjects, partnerships, guaranty, gifts and bequests, while that of “marriage” would cover as varied a field as dissolution of matrimony, foster relationships, custody, and wifely and family support. In the same vein, the “quarter of injuries” includes homicide, the Quranic punishments and the laws of war and peace, among other topics.

According to at least one author (Monzer Kahf), ''Mu'amalat'' "sets terms and conditions of conduct for economic and financial relationships in the [[Islamic economics|Islamic economy]]" and provides the "grounds on which new instruments" of Islamic financing are developed. It also extends beyond discussions of Islamic legality "to the social and economic repercussions of alternative legal forms of economic or financial relationship and analyze the rationale behinds [sic] it."&lt;ref name=MKRDMIE2003:46&gt;[[#MKRDMIE2003|Kahf, "Relevance definition and methodology of Islamic Economics"]]: p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
[[File:Islamic-organizational-chart-muamalat.jpg|right|600px|Aspects of Islam including fiqh]]
According to Hosein Askar, Zamir Iqbal, and Abbas Mirakhor, a "significant subset" of muamalat "defines the conduct of economic activities" within the economic system, which "ultimately lays down  the rules for commercial, financial and banking system."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2V2FBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA46&amp;dq=%22Introduction+to+Islamic+Economics%22++a+%22significant+subset%22+of+muamalat+%22defines+the+conduct+of+economic+activities%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Introduction%20to%20Islamic%20Economics%22%20%20a%20%22significant%20subset%22%20of%20muamalat%20%22defines%20the%20conduct%20of%20economic%20activities%22&amp;f=false|title=Introduction to Islamic Economics: Theory and Application|last=Askari|first=Hossein|last2=Iqbal|first2=Zamir|last3=Mirakhor|first3=Abbas|date=2015-02-16|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=|isbn=9781118732960|location=|pages=46|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basic principles  ===
According to Aznan Hasan, basic principles of muamalat, are that dealings and contracts in Islam ...&lt;ref name="hasanFSIF" /&gt;
*are permissible until evidence is given proving otherwise;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*must be based on mutual consent;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*must be in accordance with the [[maqasid]] (goals of) al shariah;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*should facilitate the circulation of wealth and property;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*should be transparent;&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF/&gt; 
*must observe justice and fair dealing.&lt;ref name=hasanFSIF&gt;Aznan Hasan, ''Fundamentals of Shariah in Islamic Finance'', pp. 193-199, as cited in {{cite web |url=http://takafuleexam.com/e-content/TBE-A/content/18141053PartAEnglish.pdf |title=CHAPTER A1, INTRODUCTION TO ISLAMIC MUAMALAT |website=Takaful Basic Examination, IBFIM |page=7 |accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theories of Muamalat===
According to Abdullaah Jalil, Asharaf Mohd Ramli, Syahidawati Shahwan  there are four "theories" that underlie the framework of Mu'amalat dealings:&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7&gt;[[#4IToFM2014|JALIL, et. al., ''FOUR INTRODUCTORY THEORIES OF FIQH MUAMALAT'']]: p.16-7&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Ahliyyah'' (Legal Capacity). Legal capacity refers to whether the person is of sound mind and old enough (puberty) to enter into a legal financial contract.&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7/&gt;   
#''Mal'' (Property) concerns the nature and types of property that the contract deal with.&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7/&gt;
##Property must exist at the time of transaction
##seller must be owner of the merchandise
##merchandise must be Islamically lawful
##must be of some use or value
##must be able to be delivered by the seller to the buyer
##the details of the merchandise must be known to both the seller and buyer&lt;ref name="IBaFiM2013-120"&gt;{{cite book|last1=ABʻAZIZ|first1=MUHAMMAD RIDWAN |title=Islamic Banking and Finance in Malaysia; System, Issues and Challenges |date=2013 |publisher=Al Manhal |page=120 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HWBkCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=muamalat+contracts#v=onepage&amp;q=muamalat%20contracts&amp;f=false |accessdate=5 April 2017|chapter=6. Muamalat Contracts in Islamic Banking and Finance |isbn=9789670393728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
#''Milkiyyah'' (Ownership), concerns the types, methods and scopes of ownership, that affect the relationship between the property and its owner in Islamic jurisprudence.&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7/&gt; 
#'''Aqd'' (Contract), describes the framework or structure of a contract in fiqh.&lt;ref name=4IToFM2014:16-7/&gt;

Jalil, Ramli and Shahwan also note that the development of ''Mu'amalat'' rules is less strict than '''Ibadat''.

|}

=== General Prohibitions ===
According to muamalat, contracts ...
*should not involve the selling or buying of [[Islamic dietary laws#Intoxicants|alcohol]] or any other ''[[haram]]'' substances.&lt;ref name=TBECAIIM2012:8&gt;[[#TBECAIIM2012|TBE, "CHAPTER A1, INTRODUCTION TO ISLAMIC MUAMALAT", 2012]]: p.8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IBFIM-intro-1.2.2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://takafuleexam.com/e-content/TBE-A/content/18141053PartAEnglish.pdf |title=CHAPTER A1, INTRODUCTION TO ISLAMIC MUAMALAT |website=Takaful Basic Examination, IBFIM |pages=8| accessdate=1 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*should not include any financial deal on the basis of usury (''[[riba]]'')&lt;ref name=IBFIM-intro-1.2.2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBECAIIM2012:8/&gt;
*should not involve gambling (''[[maisir]]'')&lt;ref name=IBFIM-intro-1.2.2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBECAIIM2012:8/&gt; 
*should not involves major uncertainty (''[[gharar]] fahish'')&lt;ref name=IBFIM-intro-1.2.2/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBECAIIM2012:8/&gt; (minor uncertainty is permissible).

=== Contracts ===
At least one source (a scholar identified as "Barbarti") defines ''aqad'' (contract) as a “legal relationship created by the conjunction of two declarations, from which flow legal consequences with regard to the subject matter”.
&lt;ref name=MNCSIF:33&gt;[[#MNCSIF|Chik, ''Shariah in Islamic Finance'']]: p.33&lt;/ref&gt;

The essential elements of a contract are contracting parties (''aqidan'),'' a subject matter ''('Ma'aqud Alaih''), and a legally binding offer and acceptance (''Sighah''). They may be written, verbal or even indicated by signs (in the case of speechless person).&lt;ref name=MNCSIF:34&gt;[[#MNCSIF|Chik, ''Shariah in Islamic Finance'']]: p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

Muamalat contracts are prominent in Islamic banking where they are "fundamental factors" that determine whether a "transaction is valid or not".&lt;ref name="IBaFiM2013-117"&gt;{{cite book|last1=ABʻAZIZ|first1=MUHAMMAD RIDWAN |title=Islamic Banking and Finance in Malaysia; System, Issues and Challenges |date=2013 |publisher=Al Manhal |page=117 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=HWBkCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=muamalat+contracts#v=onepage&amp;q=muamalat%20contracts&amp;f=false |accessdate=5 April 2017|chapter=6. Muamalat Contracts in Islamic Banking and Finance |isbn=9789670393728 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{further|Islamic banking and finance#Islamic financial transaction terminology}}
Some contracts in ''Mu'amalat'' include: 
* Sale Contract; 
* Cost plus profit (''[[murabahah]]''); 
* Debt (''al-Qard''); 
* Hiring/leasing (''al-Ijarah''); 
* Lending (''al-I'arah''); 
* Agency (''wakalah''); 
* Mortgage (''al-Rahn''); 
* Partnership (''[[Profit and loss sharing#Musharakah|Musharakah]]'');

{{Libertarianism sidebar |Concepts}}

'''Non-interventionism''' or '''non-intervention''' is a [[foreign policy]] that holds that political rulers should minimize relations with other nations but still retain diplomacy and trade, while avoiding  wars unless related to direct [[self-defense]]. A 1915 definition is that non-interventionism is a policy characterized by the absence of "interference by a state or states in the external affairs of another state without its consent, or in its internal affairs with or without its consent".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/doctrineinterve01hodggoog#page/n24/mode/2up|title=The Doctrine of Intervention|last=Hodges|first=Henry G.|publisher=|year=1915|isbn=|location=|pages=1|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is based on the grounds that a state should not interfere in the internal politics of another state as well as the principles of [[state sovereignty]] and [[self-determination]]. A similar phrase is "strategic independence".&lt;ref name="???"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Libertarian Reader| author=Carpenter, Ted Galen| publisher= | year= | isbn=0-684-83200-3 | pages=336–344}} Non-intervention is usually defined either as the determination by a nation to refrain from interfering in the affairs of other nations or those of its own political subdivisions or as the refusal or failure to intervene in the same.

Non-interventionism is not to be confused with isolationism, a political policy which sometimes carries with it laws that mandate a breaking of ties between the inhabitants of one political subdivision and another.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical examples of supporters of non-interventionism are [[President of the United States|US Presidents]] [[George Washington]] and [[Thomas Jefferson]], who both [[United States non-interventionism|favored non-intervention]] in European wars. Other proponents include [[United States Senator]] [[Robert A. Taft]] and former [[United States Representative]] [[Ron Paul]] and U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders.

[[Isolationism]] includes and goes beyond simple non-interventionism through its advocacy of [[economic nationalism]] (or tariff [[protectionism]]) and [[immigration reduction]]. Non-interventionism is a policy in government only and thus does not exclude [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental]] intervention by organizations.

==History==
The [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] of non-intervention has dominated the majority of [[international relations]] and can be seen to have been one of the principal motivations for the US's initial non-intervention into [[World War I|World Wars I]] and [[World War II|II]], and the [[Non-intervention in the Spanish Civil War|non-intervention of the liberal powers in the Spanish Civil War]], despite the intervention of [[German involvement in the Spanish Civil War|Germany]] and [[Foreign involvement in the Spanish Civil War#Italy|Italy]]. The norm was then firmly established into [[international law]] as one of central tenets of the [[United Nations Charter]], which established non-intervention as one of the key principles which would underpin the emergent post-World War II peace.

However, this was soon affected by the advent of the [[Cold War]], which increased the number and intensity of interventions in the domestic politics of a vast number of [[Developing country|developing countries]] under pretexts such as instigating a "[[Revolutionary socialism|global socialist revolution]]" or ensuring "[[containment]]" of such a revolution. The adoption of such pretexts and the idea that such interventions were to prevent a threat to "international peace and [[International security|security]]" allowed intervention under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII of the UN Charter]]. Additionally, the [[United Nations|UN]]'s power to regulate such interventions was hampered during the Cold War due to both the US and [[USSR]] holding veto power in the [[United Nations Security Council]].

==By country==
===China===
{{Main article|Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence}}
Mutual non-interference has been debut as one of China's principles on foreign policy in 1954. After [[Chinese economic reform]], China begins to focus on industrial development and so actively avoided military conflict over the last three decades.&lt;ref name=China-non-interference&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Kerry|title=Is China's non-interference policy sustainable?|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-24100629|publisher=BBC|accessdate=17 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of February 2017, [[China]] has used its [[United Nations Security Council veto power|veto]] only eleven times in [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]].&lt;ref name="UNSC Research Guide-2015"&gt;[http://research.un.org/en/docs/sc/quick/veto Security Council - Veto List]. Retrieved 13 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Observers have noted a preference for China to abstain, rather than veto, on resolutions not directly related to Chinese interests.&lt;ref name=GlobalPolicyForum&gt;[[Global Policy Forum]] (2008): [http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/data/vetotab.htm "Changing Patterns in the Use of the Veto in the Security Council"]. Retrieved 30 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In recent years, [[New Zealand]] has become largely non-interventionist. No military support, apart from medical support, was given for the [[First Gulf War]] although [[New Zealand Special Air Service|SAS]] troops were provided for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)|war in Afghanistan]]. Engineers were provided in [[Iraq]] after conventional hostilities in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 war]] had ceased. In the [[Pacific Islands]], New Zealand has been involved in [[humanitarian intervention]]s in the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[East Timor]]. However, the interventions were non-coercive interventions at the request of the nation being intervened upon. The activities are known as "[[Peacekeeping|peace keeping]]".

===Sweden===
{{Main article|Swedish neutrality}}
[[Sweden]] has remained non-interventionist since the backlash against the king following Swedish losses in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]; the ''[[Coup d'état|coup d'etat]]'' that followed in 1812 caused [[Jean Baptiste Bernadotte]] to establish a policy of non-intervention, which has remained since the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815.

===Switzerland===

[[Switzerland]] has long been known for its policy of defensively armed neutrality.

In December 2013, the [[Pew Research Center]] reported that their newest poll, "American's Place in the World 2013," had revealed that 52 percent of respondents in the national poll said that the United States "should mind its own business internationally and let other countries get along the best they can on their own."&lt;ref name=HealyExamDec10&gt;{{cite news|last1=Healy|first1=Gene|title=It's not isolationist for America to mind its own business|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/its-not-isolationist-for-america-to-mind-its-own-business/article/2540441|accessdate=13 August 2014|publisher=Washington Examiner|date=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That was the most people to answer that question this way in the history of the question, which pollsters began asking in 1964.&lt;ref name=PewCommentaryDec3&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lindsay|first1=James M.|last2=Kauss|first2=Rachael|title=The Public's Mixed Message on America's Role in the World|url=http://www.people-press.org/2013/12/03/commentary-by-james-m-lindsay-and-rachael-kauss-of-the-council-on-foreign-relations/|publisher=Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only about a third of respondents felt that way a decade ago.&lt;ref name="PewCommentaryDec3"/&gt;

[[Al Gore]] states in ''[[The Assault on Reason]]'', "Hardly anyone now disagrees that the choice to invade Iraq was a grievous mistake. Yet, incredibly, all of the evidence and arguments necessary to have made the right decision were available at the time and in hindsight are glaringly obvious."&lt;ref name="excerpt"&gt;{{cite web |title="Book Excerpt: The Assault on Reason" |url=http://www.d.umn.edu/~bmork/1101/Gore%20the%20assault%20on%20reason.htm |website=www.d.umn.edu |language=en |date=16 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decline==
Since the end of the Cold War, new emergent norms of humanitarian intervention are challenging the norm of non-intervention, based upon the argument that while sovereignty gives rights to states, there is also a [[responsibility to protect]] its citizens. The ideal, an argument based upon [[social contract]] theory, has states being justified in intervening within other states if the latter fail to protect (or are actively involved in harming) their citizens.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Evans|first=Gareth|author-link=Gareth Evans (politician)|year=2004|title=When is it Right to Fight?|url=|journal=Survival|volume=46|issue=3|pages=59–82|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That idea has been used to justify the UN-sanctioned intervention [[Operation Provide Comfort]] in Northern Iraq in 1991 to protect the [[Kurds]] and in [[Somalia]], [[UNOSOM I]] and [[UNOSOM II]] from 1992 to 1995 in the absence of state power. However, after the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|US "Black Hawk Down" event in 1993]] in [[Mogadishu]], the US refused to intervene in [[Rwanda]] or [[Haiti]]. However, despite strong opposition from [[Russia]] and [[China]], the idea of the responsibility to protect was again used to justify [[NATO#Kosovo intervention|NATO intervention]] in [[Kosovo]] in 1999 and the [[2011 military intervention in Libya]].

The new norm of humanitarian intervention is not universally accepted and is often seen as still developing.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In all of the UN-sanctioned cases, the arguments were further couched in Chapter VII threats to international peace and security. It has been suggested{{By whom|date=November 2016}} that this newly emerging norm is used to justify the action of states only if they want to act, rather than creating a moral duty of states to intervene.&lt;ref name="John Laughland"&gt;{{cite web |title=Non-interventionism: The Forgotten Doctrine |last=Laughland |first=John |website=youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his paper "Non-Interventionism - The Forgotten Doctrine," [[John Laughland]] mentions, "ICC will be able to prosecute the old [[Viktor Yanukovych|Yanukovich]] regime for war crimes but not the new government, even though the new regime has fighting a war since April whereas Yanukovich never fought one at all."

'''Operation Snow White''' was a [[criminal conspiracy]] by the [[Church of Scientology]] during the 1970s to purge unfavorable records about Scientology and its founder, [[L. Ron Hubbard]]. This project included a series of infiltrations into and thefts from 136 government agencies, foreign embassies and consulates, as well as private organizations critical of Scientology, carried out by Church members in more than 30 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Stephen | last = Labaton | title = Scientologists Granted Tax Exemption by the U.S. | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE6D81638F937A25753C1A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work = [[New York Times]] | date = 1993-10-14 | accessdate = 2008-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was one of the largest infiltrations of the United States government in history,&lt;ref name="Double Crossed"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tony |last=Ortega |url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1999-12-23/news/double-crossed/ |title=Double Crossed | work=[[Phoenix New Times]] | publisher=[[New Times Media]] |date= 1999-12-23|accessdate=2006-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with up to 5,000 covert agents.&lt;ref name="Vanished"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,951938,00.html |title = Mystery of the Vanished Ruler |accessdate = 2007-08-10 |date = 1983-01-31|work = |publisher = [[Time (magazine)|TIME]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This operation also exposed the Scientology plot '[[Operation Freakout]]', because Operation Snow White was the case that initiated the U.S. government's investigation of the Church.&lt;ref name="Vanished" /&gt;

Under this program, [[Scientology]] operatives committed [[Infiltration tactics|infiltration]], [[wiretapping]], and theft of documents in government offices, most notably those of the [[U.S. Internal Revenue Service]]. Eleven highly placed Church executives, including [[Mary Sue Hubbard]] (wife of founder [[L.

The case was ''[[United States v. Hubbard|United States v.

Hubbard 650 F.2d 293 (1981)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

As early as 1960, L. Ron Hubbard had proposed that Scientologists should infiltrate government departments by taking secretarial, bodyguard or other jobs.&lt;ref name="urban2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Urban|first=Hugh B.|date=June 2006|title=Fair Game: Secrecy, Security and the Church of Scientology in Cold War America|journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion|publisher=Oxford University Press|volume=74|issue=2|pages=356–389|doi=10.1093/jaarel/lfj084}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, the Church of Scientology was increasingly scrutinized by US federal agencies, having already been raided by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] in 1963. The [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) claimed the Church owed millions of dollars in taxes and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) sent agents into the organization.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt; The Church's response involved a publicity campaign, extensive litigation against the IRS and a program of infiltration of agency offices.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;

The specific branch of Scientology responsible for Operation Snow White was the [[Office of Special Affairs|Guardian's Office]]. Created in 1966 by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the purpose of the Guardian's Office was to protect the interests of Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

At the time of Operation Snow White, the Guardian's Office had its worldwide headquarters (Guardian's Office WW) located at [[Saint Hill Manor]] in England. Headquarters in the United States (Guardian's Office US) were in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], though smaller offices existed in [[Washington, D.C.]] (Guardian's Office DC) and other cities throughout the United States. Each Guardian Offices consisted of five bureaus. One such bureau was the Information Bureau, which oversaw the infiltration of the government. L. Ron Hubbard oversaw the Guardian's Office, though it was Mary Sue Hubbard, his wife, who held the title Commodore Staff Guardian.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Several years later, in 1973, the Guardian's Office began a massive infiltration of governments around the world, though the primary target of the operation was the United States. Worried about Scientology's long-term reputation, the Guardian's Office decided to infiltrate [[Interpol]] to obtain documents related to Scientology, as well as those connecting L. Ron Hubbard to criminal activity. Jane Kember handed this duty to Henning Heldt and his staff.&lt;!--- Who are these people and why are they mentioned? Context, people, context! ---&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around this time L. Ron Hubbard himself wrote Guardian Order 732&lt;ref&gt;{{web cite|title=Guardians Office Order 732|url=http://www.wiseoldgoat.com/papers-scientology/popup-windows/scn_go_732_730420_snow_white.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which called for the removal and correction of "erroneous" Scientology files. It is here that Operation Snow White has its origins. Though the order called for this to be achieved by legal means, this would quickly change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GO Order 732 WW. 4-20-1973|url=http://www.freezone.org/timetrack/1973.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091108184732/http://www.freezone.org/timetrack/1973.htm|archivedate=2009-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard himself would later be named by federal prosecutors as an "[[unindicted co-conspirator]]" for his part in the operation. Though extensive records of his involvement exist, many Scientologists claim his directives were misinterpreted by his followers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first = John |last = Marshall |title = Hubbard still gave orders, records show  |work = [[The Globe and Mail]] |date = 1980-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burglaries and Lies"&gt;{{cite news|author=Robert W. Welkos|author2=Joel Sappell|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientologysidec062490,0,7034344.story |title=Burglaries and Lies Paved a Path to Prison |work=Los Angeles Times |date=1990-06-24 |accessdate=2006-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Snow White would be further refined by Guardian Order 1361. Addressed from Jane Kember to Heldt, Duke Snider, and Richard Weigand, GO 1361 called for, among other things, an infiltration of the [[Los Angeles]] and [[London]] offices of the IRS, and the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the order was specific to the IRS, the Guardian's Office was soon recruiting their own field agents to infiltrate other governmental offices, including the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] intelligence service,&lt;ref name="Agents Raid Scientology Church 1977"&gt;{{Cite news | title=Federal Agents Raid Scientology Church; Offices in Two Cities Are Searched for Allegedly Stolen IRS Files | author=Marro, Anthony | newspaper=New York Times | date=July 8, 1977 | pages=1, 7 | url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/flash/us/20100226_SCIENTOLOGY_TIMELINE/1977raid.pdf | accessdate=July 1, 2010 | postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Institute of Mental Health]], among others, as well as the [[American Medical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;"Dianetic Sect Said to Spy on AMA; Criticized Over Dianetics." New York Times. November 2nd, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; The program called for rewards to be given for successful missions carried out by Scientologists.&lt;ref&gt;"More Break-Ins Revealed In Scientology Spy Case." The Washington Post. October 26th, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the sentencing memoranda in the case also noted that, contrary to what the defendants claimed, the programs planned by the [[Guardian's Office]] were not restricted to trying to remove "false reports" but included plans to plant false information—for instance, planting false records about "a [[cat]] with a [[Pedigree chart|pedigree]] name" into US security agency computers so that later "the creature holds a press conference and photographic story results."  The purpose of [[List of Guardian's Office operations#Operation Cat|Operation Cat]] was "to hold up the American security to ridicule, as outlined in the GO by LRH."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:United States of America v. Jane Kember, Morris Budlong, Sentencing Memorandum|Sentencing Memorandum in Criminal No. 78-401(2)&amp;(3): UNITED STATES OF AMERICA v. JANE KEMBER; MORRIS BUDLONG a/k/a MO BUDLONG]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of 1974 saw Michael Meisner appointed Assistant Guardian for Information in the District of Columbia (AG I DC). Meisner's responsibilities included the implementation of all Information Bureau orders, programs, and projects within the DC area. Meisner's supervisor at this time was Duke Snider, the Assistant Guardian for DC, or AG DC. This was the highest position in Washington's GO office.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=1-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1974, Meisner was ordered by Duke Snider to implement the previously written plan to obtain Interpol documents, which were then located in the [[U.S. Department of the Treasury]]. Meisner had more to do than just this, though, as by August he was also taking directions from Cindy Raymond, the GO's Collections Officer for the US, who ordered Meisner to assist her in finding a loyal Scientologist agent to gain employment at the IRS headquarters in Washington DC. This employee was to steal all documents dealing with Scientology, especially those involving current litigation by Scientology against the government. Meisner discussed this with Raymond for a period of a month before interviewing various Scientologists with no luck. A month after the order had been given, Raymond informed Meisner that she had selected Gerald Bennett Wolfe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=17-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementation==

The GO's actual infiltration of the government likely began when Gerald Wolfe and Michael Meisner were able to gain employment at the IRS as clerk-typists. Under direction of the Guardian Office, Wolfe monitored files on tax-exempt organizations and, when requested, illegally made copies for Scientology.&lt;ref name="Agents Raid Scientology Church 1977"/&gt; Meisner supervised both Wolfe and the Information Bureau section in DC, and reported to the GO's Deputy Guardian for Information in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grand Jury|1978|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1974, Operation Snow White took an unexpected turn for the GO when they received word that the IRS would be conducting a meeting on Scientology's tax-exempt status. In response, the church sent a spy to bug the room.&lt;ref&gt;"Documents Made Public in Case of Infiltration by Scientologists; Documents Give First Details 8 Plead to Conspiracy." ''New York Times'' October 26, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; On the morning of November 1, the day before the meeting, a GO agent, Hermann, broke into the conference room and plugged the device into an electrical outlet. This device, in turn, then transmitted a signal on an [[Frequency modulation|FM frequency]], which was picked up and recorded by Scientologists sitting in a car in the parking lot of the [[Smithsonian]], which faced the office. After the meeting Hermann removed the device, and the taped recording of the meeting was sent to Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=24-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By December, Wolfe, Herman, and Meisner had sent a shipment of stolen documents 20&amp;nbsp;inches thick to Duke Snider. Snider, in turn, sent notification to Mo Budlong in Los Angeles. By the end of December, Wolfe was stealing documents from the IRS's [[Chief Counsel]]'s office. Just days after Christmas, Wolfe broke into the office of Barbara Bird, an attorney in the IRS's Refund Litigation Service. Bird had been present at the November 1st meeting. Instead of stealing files, Wolfe took them to a copier and made photocopies using government paper.&lt;ref name="lermanet.com"&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=38-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Wolfe met Meisner at a restaurant, where he reported on his most recent theft. Meisner took the documents and underlined selections that he believed his superiors would find interesting or relevant and wrote a summary of the important points. This was then routed through the Assistant Guardian for DC and on to the Deputy Guardian for the US, the Deputy Guardian for Information in the US, the Branch I Director of the Information Bureau, and the Collections Officer, all of which were in Los Angeles. A copy was also sent to Mary Sue Hubbard. This was typically standard procedure for Meisner.&lt;ref name="lermanet.com"/&gt;

In early 1975, Operation Snow White expanded again as Sharon Thomas found employment in the [[U.S. Coast Guard]] Intelligence Agency and Nancy Douglass began work at the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA). Douglass stole documents and made photocopies of others. These were transmitted to Hermann.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By spring, attention had been called back to the IRS case as Mary Sue Hubbard had instructed Kember and Heldt to "use any method at our disposal to win the battle and gain our non-profit (tax) status".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grand Jury|1978|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heldt wrote back telling that her request had been sent to the Information Bureau, who had been ordered to complete the collection of documents from the IRS and the Department of Justice's tax files within three months.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grand Jury|1978|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April, Meisner procured a directory of the Department of Justice and located the offices that would have files pertaining to Scientology litigation. When he found what he wanted he sent in Wolfe, who broke into the offices of two attorneys on three successive Saturdays. Wolfe copied twelve files and met up with Meisner, as before, at a restaurant. These files were especially useful to Scientology, as it detailed the government's strategy in various court cases.

In May, Willardson directed Meisner to implement "Project Horn", which called for Meisner to "provide a cover for PR and legal for the way they obtained IRS docs". The idea would be for the GO's Public Relations Bureau to view the documents without worrying about being connected to the theft. Willardson's idea called for Meisner to steal documents dealing with organizations other than Scientology. Willardson also called for the theft of IRS stationery, in order to forge letters from a (fictional) disgruntled IRS employee. The files on various organizations (including Scientology, of course) would then be sent out attached to the fake letter. The idea was that it would appear that an upset IRS agent had himself sent the files to numerous organizations. There would be nothing to tie it to Scientology. Wolfe stole both the stationery and, without permission, files on the [[Unification Church]] and [[Bob Jones University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the summer and fall months of 1975, the GO launched an additional plan. In July, Meisner was told by Cindy Raymond that the Church of Scientology had initiated a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) lawsuit against the IRS. Meisner was directed to add the office of Charles Zuravin to his list of offices to monitor. Zuravin was representing the government in the case. Meisner immediately passed this duty on to Wolfe, who broke into Zuravin's office multiple times between July and November. Wolfe revealed to his superiors that Zuravin was preparing an index of Scientology files relevant to the FOIA case. IRS offices from all over the country were sending files to Zuravin. This index file, required by the courts in all FOIA cases, is a total list of the documents requested, and reasons for their exemption from the public, if any.&lt;ref name="Evidence page 81-88"&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=81-88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By October, Zuravin had finished the index, numbering each document in order to simplify location, and had provided a copy to Scientology attorneys. These attorneys, in turn, gave the index to Raymond, who passed it along to Meisner, who passed it to Wolfe. Wolfe then entered Zuravin's office and then began copying the documents listed on the index. Zuravin had essentially done the GO's job for them.&lt;ref name="Evidence page 81-88"/&gt;

On December 5, 1975, Jane Kember issued Guardian Program Order 158, which intended to give L. Ron Hubbard early warning of impending legal action. The plan called for the infiltration of the government agencies that had either the power to issue, or the knowledge of, impending [[subpoena]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grand Jury|1978|p=7-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific agencies include the US Attorney's Office in DC and LA, the IRS Office of International Operations, the DEA, and the Coast Guard and [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|Immigration and Naturalization]]. After reviewing the letter, Meisner concluded it would be a better idea to infiltrate the Department of Justice than the [[United States Attorney General|US Attorney's Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=92-93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1976, Hermann, the Southeast US Secretary for the Information Bureau, informed Meisner that Heldt and Weigand had approved a plan to send Alverzo to Washington. Alverzo arrived on the 17th, and on the 18th he picked the locks on the doors belonging to the office of Lewis Hubbard (no relation to L. Ron Hubbard) and the file room housing Zuravin's files. Wolfe stood guard at the end of the hallway while Alverzo worked on Hubbard's door. A few doors down Meisner worked on Zuravin's door. After an hour and a half with no success, Meisner was getting upset. In frustration, Meisner hit the top of Zuravin's door, which popped right open. The three Scientologists entered the office and took the remaining Scientology related documents. They then traveled to another floor where they made photocopies. Wolfe continued to make copies while Alverzo and Meisner tried again to open Hubbard's office. The trio then worked well into the night photocopying files from Hubbard's office. When they left, sometime around 2 AM, they left with a foot tall stack of documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=101-110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a month later Richard Weigand wrote to Jane Kember, telling her that the IRS documents that had been ordered to be produced in [[Guardian Order 1361]], over two years earlier, had been obtained.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grand Jury|1978|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerald Wolfe, along with Meisner, were later able to break into a room and make false IRS identification cards, which allowed them access to the federal courthouse in Washington. Wolfe and Meisner then used these cards to gain access to restricted areas and steal more documents.&lt;ref name="Agents Raid Scientology Church 1977"/&gt;

While Wolfe and Meisner continued their work at the IRS, Mary Sue Hubbard, along with other Guardian Office members, were coming up with further plans. Guardian Program Order 302, written by Cindy Raymond and approved by Hubbard, amongst others, directed the infiltration of all government agencies that had withheld files from Scientology's various FOIA requests.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grand Jury|1978|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of April 14, Meisner and Wolfe were on the tenth floor of the IRS building housing the [[Office of International Operations]]. Trying to enter an office, the pair found it locked. A passing cleaning lady noted Meisner and Wolfe's suspicious behavior, and notified a security guard. The guard confronted the pair and was presented with Wolfe's genuine IRS card and Meisner's fabricated one. Satisfied, the guard had the cleaning lady open the door. Inside, the pair grabbed a hefty load of files. Unable to find a photocopier, the pair then took the files to the main IRS building, where the pair again used their identification to gain access. After copying the files, they returned them to Crate's office. The entire process took some four hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=134-138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, Wolfe broke into the United States Courthouse and stole keys to the office of Assistant United States Attorney Nathan Dodell. Wolfe then took these keys to have them duplicated, and returned them unnoticed.  Almost three weeks later, Wolfe and Meisner broke into Dodell's office, stealing documents and, as usual, forwarding them to Guardian headquarters in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Agents Raid Scientology Church 1977"/&gt; The GO's interest in Nathan Dodell stemmed from a Scientology FOIA case. In April, Judge George L Hart asked Dodell whether the US had considered taking a deposition of L. Ron Hubbard. Dodell responded that it was an "interesting thought". Furthermore, he promised to discuss it with the Department of Justice.&lt;ref name="Evidence Page 156-177"&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=156-177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, Meisner and Wolfe entered the US Courthouse for the District of Columbia around four in the afternoon. They went to the third floor, which was the home of both the US Attorney's Office and the [[Bar Association]] Library.  They planned to locate Nathan Dodell's office, which was in the back of the [[Civil Division]] area, near an elevator. They then searched for the building's photocopiers. After mapping out these locations, they left. Later, Wolfe and Meisner made a copy of Dodell's keys.&lt;ref name="Evidence Page 156-177" /&gt;

On May 21, Meisner and Wolfe entered the Courthouse, signing in to do research in the library and were issued an elevator key. After riding the elevator to the floor of the library, the pair entered the library and removed several books from shelves and sat at a table. After a few minutes, they exited through a backdoor and emerged in a hallway. In this hallway was Dodell's office, which they entered using their keys. The duo stole a number of documents related to Scientology and walked through the hallway to the two copy machines they had previously located. The pair photocopied some six inches of documents before returning the originals to Dodell's office.&lt;ref name="Evidence Page 156-177" /&gt;

One week later, Wolfe and Meisner again met outside the IRS building. The duo then walked to the US Courthouse, and signed in under fake names. They repeated their actions from the previous week, copying another group of documents from the District of Columbia Police Department as well as the [[Food and Drug Administration]]. Returning to Dodell's office through the library, they were stopped by the night [[librarian]], who asked if they had signed in. While they had signed in at the front desk, they had failed to do the same at the front desk of the library. When they announced that they had not, Johnson, the night librarian, told the pair not to come back unless they had specific authorization from the day librarian. The pair promptly left. Three days later Johnson notified the US Attorney's Office that two individuals had been seen using the photocopying machines of the Attorney's Office. Johnson and the night guard were told to immediately contact the FBI if the individuals returned.&lt;ref name="Evidence Page 156-177"/&gt;

Less than two weeks later, Hermann phoned Meisner, and ordered him to return to Dodell's office and steal his personal files. The goal was to formulate a plan that would result in Dodell being removed from his position as an Assistant US Attorney for the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="Evidence Page 156-177"/&gt;

Meisner and Wolfe entered the United States Courthouse on June 11 around 7 in the evening. They signed in as they did before, and headed to the library. Johnson, the night librarian, recognized the pair and immediately stopped them. Meisner was prepared for this, and showed the man a letter from the head librarian. Wolfe and Meisner continued to the back of the library where they exited into the hallway. Outside Dodell's office the two saw that cleaning ladies were still at work.&lt;ref name="Evidence Page 156-177"/&gt;

While Meisner and Wolfe waited for the cleaning crew to vacate the office, Johnson called the FBI, which sent two agents over immediately. The two agents confronted the Scientologists and demanded to see their identification. Wolfe used his real identification. Meisner presented his fake card, and told the agents that he had recently resigned from the IRS. Meisner told Hansen that the pair was in the library to do legal research, and that they had used the photocopiers to copy books and cases. Neither mentioned Scientology. After roughly twenty minutes of questioning, the FBI agents allowed them to leave. Meisner then phoned Hermann to inform him of the news and was told to immediately fly to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Evidence Page 156-177"/&gt;

==Aftermath and trial==
Meisner and Wolfe were given cover stories by the Guardian's Office.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvp|Grand Jury|1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the last day of June, Gerald Wolfe was arrested. Wolfe was charged with "the use and possession of a forged official pass of the United States."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after Wolfe's arrest, Mary Sue Hubbard wrote a letter to Weigand ordering him to keep her abreast of the situation. Hubbard also conversed with Mo Budlong and Richard Weigand about Wolfe's arrest, cover story, and subsequent plan to destroy evidence linking Wolfe and Meisner to Scientology.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At the end of July a judge decided that the case against Wolfe warranted an investigation by a grand jury. A week later the judge issued an arrest warrant for Meisner, who, at the time, was being hidden in LA. The FBI was able to connect him to Scientology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=196-206}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January 1977 it was becoming increasingly likely that Scientology would be unable to escape Operation Snow White without serious penalty. Though Meisner was still in hiding, he was growing increasingly anxious about the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=230-232}}&lt;/ref&gt; By April, Meisner wanted to surrender to the authorities. Meisner was quickly put under the control of several guards.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

On May 13, Gerald Wolfe entered a guilty plea.&lt;ref name="Evidence Page 246-247"&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=246-247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the month, Meisner escaped his captors, only to be convinced to rejoin the GO the following day.&lt;ref name="Evidence Page 246-247" /&gt;

[[File:2125 S Street NW.JPG|thumb|From 1964 to 1995, the Founding Church of Scientology in [[Washington, D.C.]]. The building was raided by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] in July 1977.]]

In June, Wolfe, after being sentenced to probation and community service, testified before the Grand Jury. Instead of the truth, Wolfe told the latest incarnation of his cover story.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Several days later Meisner would again escape his captors, though this time he would contact the FBI. Meisner was eventually taken to Washington, where he agreed to plead guilty to a five-year conspiracy felony and cooperate with the Grand Jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Stipulation of Evidence|1979|p=268-274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] raided Church of Scientology locations in Los Angeles, Hollywood and Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="Agents Raid Scientology Church 1977" /&gt; The Los Angeles raid involved 156 FBI agents, the most that had ever been used in a single raid. It lasted 21 hours and filled a 16-ton truck with documents and other items.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;

The raids not only turned up documentation of the group's illegal activities against the United States government,&lt;ref name="ParryTime"&gt;{{cite web | title = Scientology: Parry and Thrust | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,919130,00.html | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]] | date = 1977-07-25 | accessdate = 2008-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but also illegal activities carried out against other perceived enemies of Scientology. These included "[[Operation Freakout]]", a conspiracy to frame author [[Paulette Cooper]] on false bomb-threat charges, and conspiracies to frame [[Gabe Cazares]], mayor of [[Clearwater, Florida]], on false [[hit and run (vehicular)|hit-and-run]] charges.&lt;ref name="sppulitzer"&gt;{{cite news|author=Charles L.

Comparing the FBI to the Gestapo, the Church declared that all the files seized from the Church were taken illegally,&lt;ref&gt;"Stolen Documents Reported Found in FBI Raids on Scientologists; Infiltration of Agencies $750 Million Suit" New York Times. July 10th 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; though the FBI produced a 40-plus page affidavit detailing 160 specific items they were looking for.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientology Search Troubles Judge." Washington Post.  July 23rd, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

By July 20, 13 days after the raid, a Washington judge ruled that the documents should be returned, at least temporarily, to the Church, and that none of the documents could be shared with branches of the government, unless that specific branch was investigating Scientology. Scientology's lawyers had successfully argued that in order to prepare for an August 8 hearing on the legality of the raid, they must be able to see the documents.&lt;ref&gt;"Church of Scientology to Get Documents Back." New York Times. July 21st 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; By July 27, a judge in Washington had ruled the warrant authorizing the raid was too broad and, as such, violated the Church's 4th Amendment rights.&lt;ref&gt;"FBI Raids on Church are Ruled Improper; Judge Calls Warrants Too Broad to Justify Seizure of Papers." July 28th 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; In August, this ruling would be overturned, with Scientology promising to take the case to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]],&lt;ref&gt;"FBI is Upheld on Search Warrant for Church Offices." New York Times. December 2nd, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; which would, early in the next year, refuse to hear the case.&lt;ref&gt;"Court Refuses to Act in Church of Scientology Appeal; IRS Agents' Liability Other Rulings Stand." New York Times, March 21st, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1978,  11 high-ranking members of Scientology were indicted on 28 charges. One of the indicted was [[Mary Sue Hubbard]], wife of Scientology's creator L. Ron Hubbard. The other ten were Gerald Wolfe, Cindy Raymond,  Henning Heldt, Duke Snider, Gregory Willardson, Richard Weigand, Mitchell Herman, Sharon Thomas, Jane Kember,  and Mo Budlong. [[Kendrick Moxon]] and [[L. Ron Hubbard]] were named unindicted co-conspirators.&lt;ref name="FBI 1979"&gt;"Ex-Agent Alleges Fraud in FBI; Says Many Informers are Bogus." New York Times January 6th, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the investigation, the Church of Scientology attempted to have a judge removed,&lt;ref name="FBI 1979"/&gt; and subpoenaed almost 150 federal agents in what appeared to be a large stalling scheme.&lt;ref&gt;"Scientology Case Shifted to Coast; 11 Officials Indicted." New York Times June 30th, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Church also offered several shifting explanations for their actions.&lt;ref&gt;"Church of Scientology Announces it is Investigating Government." Washington Post. May 2nd, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Germ Warfare Report." The Washington Post. October 29th, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, these tactics failed and the defendants agreed to a plea deal.

Seven of the 11 members of the Guardian's Office pleaded guilty to just a single count of conspiracy to obstruct justice. One more pleaded guilty to a similar charge and a ninth pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor. The Scientologists were allowed to argue for the suppression of the government's evidence. The remaining two Scientologists were in England, pending extradition.&lt;ref&gt;"Judge Backs Guilty Plea Bargain by Scientology Church Leaders; Assurances Asked." New York Times October 9th 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Royal Courts of Justice Sign.jpg|thumb|The [[Royal Courts of Justice]], [[London]], where Kember and Budlong's plea for political asylum was denied.]]On December 6, 1979, some five years after Operation Snow White began, it officially came to an end. Five of the Scientologists were sentenced to four years in jail, with four of the convicted being taken immediately. Mary Sue Hubbard, wife of L. Ron Hubbard, was sentenced to five years. Each of the six faced a fine of $10,000.&lt;ref&gt;"5 Scientologists Get Jail Terms in Plot on Files; Leaders Fined $10,000 in Data Theft Conspiracy 'What is the Example?" New York Times December 7th, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day the four remaining Scientologists were sentenced. Three of the four faced a fine of $10,000 and five years in jail. The fourth was fined $1,000 and sent to jail for six months. Upon release Mary Sue Hubbard was given five years of probation and community service. All of the Scientologists immediately appealed&lt;ref&gt;"Four More Scientologists Sentenced." The Washington Post. December 8th, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; but the verdicts were confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;"Convictions of 9 Scientologists in Plotting Thefts Are Upheld." The Washington Post. October 3rd, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1980, the two remaining Scientologists, Jane Kember and Mo Budlong, were finally convicted on nine counts of aiding and abetting burglary in connection with break-ins at government offices,&lt;ref&gt;"Two Scientologists Are Convicted Of Aiding in U.S. Office Break-ins." The Washington Post. November 27th, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and were sentenced to six years.&lt;ref&gt;"2 Scientologists Sentenced to Prison." The Washington Post. December 20th, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kember and Budlong had claimed [[Right of asylum#Modern political asylum|political asylum]] in the UK, arguing that they should not be [[Extradition|extradited]] to the US because the burglaries had political objectives. Their application against extradition was denied by the British [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] on the grounds that it did not fall within the [[political offence exception]] to the Extradition Act 1870; Mr. [[Judge#United Kingdom|Justice]] Griffiths said:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=United Kingdom Case Note|journal=The American Journal of International Law|date=April 1980|volume=74|issue=2|pages=447–450|jstor=2201516|author=Alona E. Evans|doi=10.2307/2201516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I am unable to accept that organising burglaries either for the purpose of identifying persons in Government offices hostile to the Scientologists, or for the purpose of gaining an advantage in litigation, or even for the wider purpose of refuting false allegations thus enabling a better image of the Church of Scientology to be projected to the public, comes anywhere near being an offence of a political character within the meaning of the Extradition Act.

The Applicants did not order these burglaries to take place in order to challenge the political control or Government of the United States; they did so to further the interests of the Church of Scientology and its members, and in particular the interest of Ron L. Hubbard, the founder of Scientology. In my view, it would be ridiculous to regard the Applicants as political refugees seeking asylum in this country, and I reject the submission that these were offences of a political character.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Involved parties==
[[Mary Sue Hubbard]], Cindy Raymond, Gerald Bennett Wolfe, Henning Heldt, Duke Snider, Gregory Willardson, Richard Weigand, Mitchell Herman, Sharon Thomas, Jane Kember, and Mo Budlong, all high-ranking Scientologists, were convicted and sent to prison for five years. [[L. Ron Hubbard]] was named by federal prosecutors as an "unindicted co-conspirator" and went into hiding for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="urban2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Burglaries and Lies"/&gt;

==Effect of the scandal==
{{See also|Scientology in Canada}}
The Church has been reluctant to discuss the operation's details; typical statements by members and operatives are often vague comments saying that the [[Guardian's Office]] (GO) had been "infiltrated" and "set up" to fail in its mission to protect the Church, that those involved were "purged" from the Church, without detailing what actually happened (although it has been suggested many of those involved and "purged" remained in important positions of power within the church).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faq.scientology.org/go.htm |title=What is the Guardian's Office and does it still exist?}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church spokespersons on the Internet and elsewhere have been known to claim that the operatives "had done nothing more serious than steal photocopier paper."&lt;ref&gt;Ortega, Tony (Sept. 9, 2001). "Sympathy for the Devil". ''New Times Los Angeles''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Church of Scientology spokesman [[Tommy Davis (Scientology)|Tommy Davis]] said that the jailed members of Guardians Org were declared "suppressive people" by the Church of Scientology and had to undergo rehabilitation in order to resume their upper level training in the church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/28213878|title=Tommy Davis Video 7|work=Vimeo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Snow White extended to [[Canada]] and resulted in legal proceedings against the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Morgan, Lucy. |title=Abroad: Critics public and private keep pressure on Scientology |publisher=St. Petersburg Times |date=29 March 1999 |url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/32999/Worldandnation/Abroad__Critics_publi.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219080712/http://www.sptimes.com/News/32999/Worldandnation/Abroad__Critics_publi.html |archivedate=19 December 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|pre-1795 Dutch Orangism|monarchism in the Netherlands|Orangism (Kingdom of the Netherlands)|other uses|Orangism (disambiguation){{!}}Orangism}}

In the history of the [[Dutch Republic]], '''Orangism''' or '''''prinsgezindheid''''' ("pro-prince stance") was a political force opposing the [[Dutch States Party|''Staatsgezinde'']] (pro-Republic) party. Orangists supported the [[Prince of Orange|princes of Oranges]] as [[Stadtholder]]s (a position held by members of the [[House of Orange]]) and military commanders of the Republic, as a check on the power of the ''[[regenten]]''.{{r|reinders}}{{rp|12}} The Orangist party drew its adherents largely from the common people, soldiers, the nobility and orthodox preachers, though its support fluctuated heavily over the course of the Republic's history.&lt;ref name="reinders"/&gt;{{rp|13}}

==History==

===The coup of stadtholder Maurice against Oldenbarnevelt===
{{main|Twelve Years' Truce}}
Orangism can be seen as a continuation of the political opposition between the [[remonstrant]]s and [[counter-remonstrant]]s during the [[Twelve Years' Truce]]. The Remonstrants were tolerant and republican, with a liberal view on biblical interpretation, no belief in [[predestination]] and were led by men like [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]] and [[Hugo Grotius]]. [[Stadtholder]] [[Maurice of Nassau, Prince of Orange]] relied on the counter-remonstrants to oppose van Oldenbarnevelt and support his own policies, and things got so bad that civil war threatened.&lt;!--The stadtholder was not a sovereign prince and did not have a "throne".--&gt; Oldenbarnevelt was executed after a sham trial and Grotius sentenced to life in prison, and for a number of years the Orangists were in charge under Maurice and later his brother [[Frederick Henry, Prince of Orange]].&lt;ref&gt;Israel, pp. 421-450&lt;/ref&gt;
===First Stadtholderless Period and Orange Restoration of 1672===
{{Main|First Stadtholderless Period|Rampjaar}}
Orangists such as the [[Vice-Admiral]] [[Johan Evertsen]] backed the appointment of [[William III of England|William III]], [[Prince of Orange]], the posthumously-born son of [[William II, Prince of Orange]], to the office of stadtholder of the Holland and Zeeland.&lt;!--Stadtholders were appointed, not elected, by the sovereign States of each of the several provinces; before 1748 there was not yet a stadtholder for all of the provinces. Friesland, for instance had a stadtholder from the House of Nassau-Dietz--&gt;  The office had been vacant since the death of William II in 1650. The pro-Republic [[Dutch States Party]] was marked by caution (especially in all matters that could harm trade), led by [[Grand pensionary]] [[Johan de Witt]] and had supporters among the ruling class,  the ''[[regenten]]''.  It was de Witt who, in the [[Treaty of Westminster (1654)|1654 peace with England]] and its leader [[Oliver Cromwell]], agreed to include the secret [[Act of Seclusion]] barring the infant William III from the stadtholderate. De Witt then put pressure on all seven of the Republic's provinces to uphold this ban. The Orangist party was eventually led by the young Prince of Orange himself and by men such as [[Cornelis Tromp]]. It played an important part in the expulsion of the de Witt brothers ([[Cornelis de Witt]] and Johan de Witt), which culminated during the [[Rampjaar]] with William III's appointment as stadtholder on 28 June 1672 followed by an organised [[lynching]] of the brothers at the [[Gevangenpoort]] in the Hague on 20 August.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, pp. 700-739, 796-807&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second Stadtholderless Period and Orange Restoration of 1747===
{{main|Second Stadtholderless Period}}
After the death of William III in 1702 his Dutch ministers decided again to keep the office of stadtholder vacant, mainly because there was no clear successor available (the claim of [[John William Friso, Prince of Orange]], a minor at this time, to the title of Prince of Orange was disputed by his cousin [[Frederick I of Prussia]]), though Friso was recognised by the [[States of Friesland]] as their stadtholder. Friso died in 1711, and his son [[William IV, Prince of Orange]] also was born posthumously.  William IV was appointed stadtholder of Friesland, Groningen, and Gelderland at his majority in 1731, but the other provinces kept the office vacant, until in 1747 a popular revolt by Orangists  forced the States of the other four provinces to follow suit and appoint him their stadtholder also. This was the first time  that all stadtholder's offices in the Dutch Republic were in the same hand. William IV received almost dictatorial powers under the so-called Government Regulations of 1748. Hopes of democratic political reform were, however, dashed. After his early death, at age 40, in 1751, the stadtholderate (that had been declared hereditary) passed to his infant son [[William V, Prince of Orange]], but actual power was exercised by [[Regent]]s, like his mother [[Anne, Princess Royal and Princess of Orange]] until his majority in 1766.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, pp. 959-968, 1067-1079&lt;/ref&gt;
===Patriottentijd===
{{main|Patriottentijd}}
In the second half of the 18th century the anti-Orangist party became known as the [[Patriottentijd|Patriots]]. These Patriots strongly opposed both the Prince of Orange, and the British connection. Many of their numbers were drawn from those with commercial and maritime interests who saw Britain as a natural rival of the Dutch, and generally supported the French. At various times the Princes of Orange tried to counter this by moving closer or further away from the British alliance. Events came to a head in the period 1785-1787, when most of the dictatorial powers of the stadtholder were taken away by the Patriots. However, Anglo-Prussian military intervention in the [[Prussian invasion of Holland]] of 1787 gave the upper hand to the Orangists, who drove their Patriot opponents into exile. The powers of the stadtholder were now enshrined in the so-called [[Act of Guarantee]] of 1788, and guaranteed by Britain and Prussia "in perpetuity." Perpetuity in this case lasted seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Israel, 1098-1115, 1122-1127&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Batavian Republic and Exile===
{{Main|Batavian Republic}}
Following the French invasion of the [[Dutch Republic]] and the [[Batavian Revolution]] in 1795, resulting in the founding of the [[Batavian Republic]], [[William V, Prince of Orange]] fled to Britain. At the request of the British he wrote the so-called [[Kew Letters]], intended to hand the Dutch colonies to the British without a fight. At the [[Anglo-Russian invasion of Holland]] in 1799 the young ''Erfprins'' [[William I of the Netherlands|Willem Frederik]] made an not-unsuccessful attempt to get the [[Batavian Navy]] to defect to the British in the [[Vlieter Incident]]. But the invasion itself was unsuccessful, because the hoped-for Orangist insurrection failed to materialize. At the [[Treaty of Amiens|Peace of Amiens]] of 1802 William V gave up his claims to the stadtholderate in exchange for the [[Principality of Nassau-Orange-Fulda]]. This so discouraged his followers in the Batavian Republic that many made their peace with the new regime, and some, like [[Carel Hendrik Ver Huell]], went over to the French emperor [[Napoleon]] completely, becoming staunch supporters of his autocratic regime, during the period 1810-1813 during which the Netherlands was annexed to the [[First French Empire]].
===Founding of the Kingdom of the Netherlands===
In 1813, when the French retreated from the Netherlands, old Orangist partisans, led by [[Gijsbert Karel van Hogendorp]], managed to put the son of William V on a newly-invented throne, first of a principality, and soon of the newly-founded [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].

==Political theory==
The stadtholderate was never a well-defined concept in the [[constitution]] of the Dutch Republic, instead being a patchwork of responsibilities. Likewise, Orangism never became a consistent political theory.&lt;ref name="velema"&gt;{{cite book |title=Republicans: Essays on Eighteenth-century Dutch Political Thought |first=Wyger R. E. |last=Velema |year=2007 |publisher=Brill}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120}}
In particular, the Orangists never formulated a desire for absolute sovereignty in the hands of the princes, even though they "lean[ed] heavily on the concept of [[monarchy]]", since this would have been problematic in the Republic that wrested its independence from the kings of Spain under [[William the Silent|William of Orange]].&lt;ref name="reinders"&gt;{{cite book |first=Michel |last=Reinders |title=Printed Pandemonium: Popular Print and Politics in the Netherlands 1650–72 |publisher=Brill |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}
Instead, they stated their views in terms of [[Republicanism|republican]] liberty, sharing the idiom of their States Party opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Commercial Republicanism in the Dutch Golden Age: The Political Thought of Johan &amp; Pieter de la Court |first=Arthur |last=Weststeijn |publisher=Brill |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}}

Attempts to introduce elements of [[John Locke]]'s [[natural law]] and [[Montesquieu]]'s [[separation of powers]] (by [[Elie Luzac]]) failed when these same theories were taken over by the opposing [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriot]] faction in the 1780s.&lt;ref name="velema"/&gt;{{rp|120}}

An '''order of succession''' is the sequence of those entitled to hold a high office such as [[head of state]] or an honor such as a [[title of nobility]] in the order in which they stand in line to it when it becomes vacated.&lt;ref name=definition&gt;[http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/Successionandprecedence/Overview.aspx UK Royal Web site] "The order of succession is the sequence of members of the Royal Family in the order in which they stand in line to the throne. This sequence is regulated not only through descent, but also by Parliamentary statute."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--A more general source for the definition would be better, if anyone has one.--&gt; This sequence may be regulated through descent or by statute.&lt;ref name=definition/&gt;

[[Hereditary government]] form differs from [[elected government]]. An established order of succession is the normal way of passing on hereditary positions, and also provides immediate continuity after an unexpected vacancy in cases where office-holders are chosen by [[election]]: the office does not have to remain vacant until a successor is elected. In some cases the successor takes up the full role of the previous office-holder, as in the case of the [[President#Presidents in democratic countries|presidency]] of many countries; in other non-hereditary cases there is not a full succession, but a caretaker chosen by succession criteria assumes some or all of the responsibilities, but not the formal office, of the position. For example, when the position of [[President of India]] becomes vacant, the [[Vice-President of India]] carries out the essential functions of the presidency until a successor is [[Electoral College (India)|elected]]; in contrast, when the position of [[President of the Philippines]] is vacant, the [[Vice-President of the Philippines]] outright assumes the presidency itself for the rest of the term.

[[Organization]]s without hereditary or statutory order of succession require [[succession planning]] if power struggles prompted by [[power vacuum]]s are to be avoided.

==Overview==

It is often the case that the [[inheritance]] of a hereditary title, office or the like, is indivisible, i.e. on the previous holder ceasing to hold the title etc., it is inherited by a single individual. Many titles and offices are not hereditary (such as democratic state offices) and they are subject to different rules of succession.

A hereditary line of succession may be limited to [[heirs of the body]], or may also pass to collateral lines, if there are no heirs of the body, depending on the succession rules. These concepts are in use in English inheritance law.

The rules may stipulate that eligible heirs are ''heirs male'' or ''heirs general'' &amp;ndash; see further [[primogeniture]] (agnatic, cognatic, and also equal).

Certain types of [[property]] pass to a descendant or relative of the original holder, recipient or [[grantee]] according to a fixed order of [[kinship]]. Upon the death of the grantee, a designated inheritance such as a [[peerage]], or a [[monarchy]], passes automatically to that living, [[Legitimacy (family law)|legitimate]], non-[[Adoption|adoptive]] relative of the grantee who is most senior in descent (i.e. highest in the line of succession, regardless of age); and thereafter continues to pass to subsequent successors of the grantee, according to the same rules, upon the death of each subsequent heir.

Each person who inherits according to these rules is considered an heir at law of the grantee and the inheritance may not pass to someone who is not a natural, lawful descendant or relative of the grantee.

Collateral relatives, who share some or all of the grantee's ancestry, but do not directly descend from the grantee, may inherit if there is no limitation to "heirs of the body".

There are other kinds of inheritance rules if the heritage can be divided: [[co-parceners|heirs portioners]] and [[partible inheritance]].

{{Former monarchic orders of succession}}

==Monarchies and nobility==
In [[hereditary monarchy|hereditary monarchies]] the order of succession determines who becomes the new [[monarch]] when the incumbent sovereign dies or otherwise vacates the throne. Such orders of succession, derived from rules established by law or tradition, usually specify an order of seniority, which is applied to indicate which relative of the previous monarch, or other person, has the strongest claim to assume the throne when the vacancy occurs.

Often, the line of succession is restricted to persons of the [[royal family|blood royal]] (but see [[morganatic marriage]]), that is, to those legally recognized as born into or descended from the [[reign]]ing [[dynasty]] or a previous sovereign. The persons in line to succeed to the throne are called "[[dynasty#Dynasts|dynasts]]". Constitutions, statutes, [[house law]]s, and norms may regulate the sequence and eligibility of potential successors to the throne.

Historically, the order of succession was sometimes superseded or reinforced by the [[coronation]] of a selected heir as co-monarch during the life of the reigning monarch. Examples are [[Henry the Young King]] and the heirs of [[elective monarchy|elective monarchies]], such as the use of the title [[King of the Romans]] for the [[Habsburg]] emperors. In the partially elective system of [[tanistry]], the heir or ''tanist'' was elected from the qualified males of the royal family. Different monarchies use different rules to determine the line of succession.

Hereditary monarchies have used a variety of methods and algorithms to derive the order of succession among possible candidates related by blood or marriage. An advantage of employing such rules is that dynasts may, from early youth, receive grooming, education, protection, resources and retainers suitable for the future dignity and responsibilities associated with the crown of a particular nation or people. Such systems may also enhance political stability by establishing clear, public expectations about the sequence of rulers, potentially reducing competition and channeling [[cadet branch|cadets]] into other roles or endeavors.

Some hereditary monarchies have had unique selection processes, particularly upon the accession of a new dynasty. [[First French Empire|Imperial France]] established male primogeniture within the descent of [[Napoleon|Napoleon I]], but failing male issue the constitution allowed the emperors to choose who among their brothers or nephews would follow them upon the throne. The [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] was designated a [[appanage|secundogeniture]] for the second surviving son of Napoleon I Bonaparte but, failing such, provided for the emperor's stepson, [[Eugène de Beauharnais]], to succeed, even though the latter had no [[proximity of blood|blood relationship]] to the [[House of Bonaparte]]. Serbia's monarchy was hereditary by primogeniture for male descendants in the male line of [[Alexander Karađorđević, Prince of Serbia|Prince Alexander I]], but upon extinction of that line, the reigning king could choose any among his male relatives of the [[House of Karađorđević]]. In Romania, on the other hand, upon extinction of the male line descended from [[Carol I of Romania]], the constitution stipulated that the male line of his brother, [[Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern]], would inherit the throne and, failing other male line issue of that family, a prince of a "Western European" dynasty was to be chosen by the Romanian king and parliament. By contrast, older European monarchies tended to rely upon succession criteria that only called to the throne descendants of past monarchs according to fixed rules rooted in one or another pattern of laws or traditions.

===Primogeniture===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Abeyance]] --&gt;
{{main article|Primogeniture}}
In [[primogeniture]] (or more precisely ''male primogeniture''), the monarch's eldest son and his descendants take precedence over his siblings and their descendants. Elder sons take precedence over younger sons, but all sons take precedence over daughters. Children represent their deceased ancestors, and the senior line of descent always takes precedence over the junior line, within each gender. The right of succession belongs to the eldest son of the reigning sovereign (see [[heir apparent]]), and next to the eldest son of the eldest son. This is the system in [[Spain]] and [[Monaco]], and was the system used in the [[Commonwealth realm]]s for those born before 2011.

Fiefs or titles granted "in tail general" or to "heirs general" follow this system for sons, but daughters are considered equal co-heirs to each other, at least in recent British practice. This can result in the condition known as [[abeyance]].  In the medieval period, actual practice varied with local custom. While women could inherit manors, power was usually exercised by their husbands (''[[jure uxoris]]'') or their sons (''[[jure matris]]'').

====Absolute primogeniture====
Absolute primogeniture is a law in which the eldest child of the sovereign succeeds to the throne, regardless of gender, and females (and their descendants) enjoy the same right of succession as males. This is currently the system in [[Sweden]] ([[Swedish Act of Succession#changes|since 1980]]), the [[Netherlands]] ([[Succession to the Dutch throne|since 1983]]), [[Norway]] ([[Succession to the Norwegian throne|since 1990]]), [[Belgium]] ([[Line of succession to the Belgian throne|since 1991]]), [[Denmark]] ([[Danish Act of Succession referendum, 2009|since 2009]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/panorama/leute/0,1518,629069,00.html |title=Dänemark: Prinzessinnen bekommen gleiche Thron-Chancen |publisher=Spiegel Online |date=7 June 2009 |accessdate=5 February 2012|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming that the other Realms make the same provision, this will enable the changes on succession to be brought into force at the same time – but at different local times – in all sixteen Commonwealth Realms."

===Agnatic succession===
{{main article|Patrilineality#Agnatic succession}}
[[Patrilineality#Agnatic succession|Agnatic]] (or semi-Salic) succession, prevalent in much of Europe since ancient times, is the restriction of succession to those descended from or related to a past or current monarch exclusively through the [[patrilineality|male line]] of descent: descendants through females were ineligible to inherit unless no males of the [[patrilineality|patrilineage]] remained alive.

In this form of succession, the succession is reserved first to all the male dynastic descendants of all the eligible branches by order of [[primogeniture]], then upon total extinction of these male descendants to a female member of the dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;SOU 1977:5 ''Kvinnlig tronföljd''.&lt;/ref&gt; The only current monarchy that operated under semi-Salic law until recently is [[Luxembourg]], which changed to absolute primogeniture in 2011. Former monarchies that operated under semi-Salic law included Austria (later [[Austria-Hungary]]), [[Bavaria]], [[Hanover]], [[Württemberg]], [[Russia]], [[Saxony]], [[Tuscany]], and the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]].

If a female descendant should take the throne, she will not necessarily be the senior heiress by primogeniture, but usually the nearest relative to the last male monarch of the dynasty by [[proximity of blood]]. Examples are [[Christian I of Denmark]]'s succession to Schleswig-Holstein, [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] (although her right ultimately was confirmed in consequence of her victory in the [[War of the Austrian Succession]] launched over her accession), [[Marie-Adelaide, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg|Marie-Adelaide]] and [[Charlotte of Luxembourg]], [[Anne of Brittany]], and [[Maria Vladimirovna, Grand Duchess of Russia]], as well as [[Christian IX of Denmark]]'s succession in the right of his wife, [[Louise of Hesse]].

===Salic law===
The [[Salic law]], a form of agnatic succession, restricted the pool of potential heirs to males of the patrilineage, altogether excluding from the succession females of the dynasty and their descendants. The Salic law applied to the former royal or imperial houses of [[Albania]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Romania]], [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and [[Prussia]]/[[German Empire]]. It currently applies to the house of [[Princely Family of Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]], and the [[Chrysanthemum Throne]] of [[Japan]].

In 1830 in Spain the question whether or not the Salic law applied - and therefore, whether [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] should be followed by his daughter [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella]] or by his brother [[Infante Carlos, Count of Molina|Charles]] - led to a series of [[Carlist Wars|civil wars]] and the formation of a pretender rival dynasty which still exists.

Generally, hereditary monarchies that operate under the Salic law also use [[primogeniture]] among male descendants in the male line to determine the rightful successor, although in earlier history [[agnatic seniority]] was more usual than primogeniture. Fiefs and titles granted "in [[fee tail|tail]] male" or to "heirs male" follow this primogenitural form of succession. (Those granted to "heirs male of the body" are limited to the male-line descendants of the grantee; those to "heirs male general" may be inherited, after the extinction of the grantee's male-line descendants, by the male-line descendants of his father, paternal grandfather, etc.)

===Rota system===
{{main article|Rota system}}
The '''rota system''', from the Old Church Slavic word for "ladder" or "staircase", was a system of collateral succession practised (though imperfectly) in [[Kievan Rus']] and later Appanage and early Muscovite Russia.

In this system, the throne passed not linearly from father to son, but laterally from brother to brother and then to the eldest son of the eldest brother who had held the throne. The system was begun by [[Yaroslav the Wise]], who assigned each of his sons a principality based on seniority. When the Grand Prince died, the next most senior prince moved to Kiev and all others moved to the principality next up the ladder.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Shields Kollmann, “Collateral Succession in Kievan Rus’.”  ''Harvard Ukrainian Studies'' 14 (1990): 377-87; Janet Martin, Medieval Russia 980-1584 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 27-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appointment, election, tanistry, and rotation===
{{main article|Elective monarchy}}
Order of succession can be arranged by appointment: either the incumbent monarch or some [[electoral]] body appoints an heir or a list of heirs before vacancy occurs. A monarchy may be generally elective, although in a way that the next holder will be elected only after it becomes vacant.

In history, quite often, but not always, appointments and elections favored, or were limited to, members of a certain dynasty or extended family. There may be genealogical rules to determine all who are entitled to succeed, and who will be favored. This has led sometimes to an order of succession that balances branches of a dynasty by rotation.

It currently applies, with variations, to the [[Holy See]], [[Malaysia]], [[Cambodia]], [[Kuwait]], the [[UAE]], [[Andorra]], [[Swaziland]] and [[Samoa]]. It is also used in [[Ife]], [[Oyo Empire|Oyo]] and the other 
[[subnational]] states of the [[Yorubaland]] region.

===Seniority===
{{main article|Agnatic seniority}}
In seniority successions, a monarch's or fiefholder's next sibling (almost always ''brother)'', succeeds; not his children. And, if the royal house is more extensive, (male) cousins and so forth succeed, in order of seniority, which may depend upon actual age or upon the seniority between their fathers.

===Partible inheritance===
{{main article|Salic patrimony}}
In some societies, a monarchy or a fief was inherited in a way that all entitled heirs had a right to a share of it. The most prominent examples of this practice are the multiple divisions of the [[Frankish Empire]] under the [[Merovingian]] and [[Carolingian]] dynasties, and similarly [[Gavelkind]] in the British Isles.

===Proximity of blood===
{{main article|Proximity of blood}}
[[Proximity of blood]] is a system wherein the person closest in degree of kinship to the sovereign succeeds, preferring males over females and elder over younger siblings. This is sometimes used as a gloss for "pragmatic" successions in Europe; it had somewhat more standing during the [[Middle Ages]] everywhere in Europe. In [[Outremer]] it was often used to choose regents, and it figured in some of the succession disputes over the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. It was also recognized in that kingdom for the succession of fiefs, under special circumstances: if a fief was lost to the [[Saracen]]s and subsequently re-conquered, it was to be assigned to the heir in proximity of blood of the last fief-holder.

===Ultimogeniture===
{{main article|Ultimogeniture}}
[[Ultimogeniture]] is an order of succession where the subject is succeeded by the youngest son (or youngest child). This serves the circumstances where the youngest is "keeping the hearth", taking care of the parents and continuing at home, whereas elder children have had time to succeed "out in the world" and provide for themselves.

===Lateral succession===
{{See also|agnatic seniority}}
'''Lateral''' or '''fraternal system of succession''' mandates principles of seniority among members of a dynasty or dynastic clan, with a purpose of election a best qualified candidate for the leadership. The leaders are elected as being the most mature elders of the clan, already in possession of military power and competence. Fraternal succession is preferred to ensure that mature leaders are in charge, removing a need for regents. The '''lateral system of succession''' may or may not exclude male descendants in the female line from succession. In practice, when no male heir is mature enough, a female heir is usually determined "pragmatically", by proximity to the last monarch, like Boariks of the Caucasian [[Hun]]s or Tamiris of [[Massagetes]] in Middle Asia. The lateral monarch is generally elected after the leadership throne becomes vacant. In the early years of the Mongol empire, the death of the ruling monarchs, [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Ögedei Khan]], immediately stopped the Mongol western campaigns because of the upcoming elections.

In East Asia, the Lateral succession system is first recorded in the pre-historical period starting with the late [[Shang Dynasty]]'s Wai Bing succeeding his brother Da Ding, and then in connection with a conquest by the Zhou of the [[Shang Dynasty|Yin Shang]], when Wu Ding was succeeded by his brother Zu Geng in 1189 BC and then by another brother Zu Jia in 1178 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Loewe M. and Shaughnessy E.L., eds., ''The Cambridge History of Ancient China: From the Origins of Civilization to 221 B.C.'', New York, Cambridge, 1999, pp. 234, 273, 303, {{ISBN|978-0-521-47030-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A drawback of the lateral succession is that, while ensuring a most competent leadership for the moment, the system inherently created derelict prince lines not eligible for succession. Any scion of an eligible heir that did not live long enough to ascend to the throne was cast aside as not eligible, creating a pool of discontented pretenders called ''[[Tegin]]'' in Turkic and ''Izgoi'' in Rus dynastic lines. The unsettled pool of derelict princes was eventually bringing havoc to the succession order, and dismemberment to the state.

===Matrilinear succession===
In '''matrilinear succession''' (also known as '''Marumakathayam'''), practiced in [[Kerala]] by the [[Nair]] nobility and royal families, a man's wealth and title is inherited by his sister's children, and his own children receive their inheritance from their own maternal uncles. The Maharajah of [[Travancore]] is therefore succeeded by his sister's son, and his own son receives a [[courtesy title]] but has no place in the line of succession. Since Indian Independence and the passing of several acts such as the [[Hindu Succession Act]] (1956), this form of inheritance is no longer recognised by law. Regardless, the pretender to the Travancore throne is still determined by matrilinear succession.

===Succession crises===
When a monarch dies without a clear successor, a succession crisis often results. For example, when King [[Charles IV of France]] died, the [[Hundred Years War]] erupted between Charles' cousin, [[Philip VI of France]], and Charles' nephew, [[Edward III of England]], to determine who would succeed Charles as the [[King of France]]. Where the line of succession is clear, it has sometimes happened that a pretender with a weak or spurious claim but military or political power [[Usurpation|usurps]] the throne.

{{Presidential orders of succession}}

==Religion==
In [[Tibetan Buddhism]], it is believed that the holders of some high offices such as the [[Dalai Lama]] are [[reincarnation]]s of the incumbent: the order of succession is simply that an incumbent is followed by a reincarnation of himself. When an incumbent dies, his successor is sought in the general population by certain criteria considered to indicate that the [[Dalai Lama#Searching for the reincarnation|reincarnated Dalai Lama has been found]], a process which typically takes two to four years to find the infant boy.

In the [[Catholic Church]], there are prescribed procedures to be followed in the case of [[Sede vacante|vacancy of the papacy or a bishopric]].

==Republics==
In [[republic]]s, the requirement to ensure continuity of operations at all times has resulted in most offices having some formalized order of succession. In a country with [[fixed-term election]]s, the [[head of state]] (president) is sometimes succeeded following death or resignation by the [[vice president]], [[chancellor]], or [[prime minister]], in turn followed by various office holders of the [[legislative assembly]] or other [[government minister]]s. In many republics, a new election takes place some time after the "presidency" becomes unexpectedly vacant.

In states or provinces within a country, frequently a lieutenant governor or deputy governor is elected to fill a vacancy in the office of the governor.

;Example of succession
*If the [[President of the United States]] is unable to serve, the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] takes over if able to serve. If not, the order of succession is [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]], [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore of the Senate]], [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], and other cabinet officials as listed in the article ''[[United States presidential line of succession]]''.
*In [[Finland]], the president's temporary successor is the prime minister and then the ministers in the order of days spent in office, instead of in order of ministry. There is no vice president, and a new president has to be elected if the president dies or resigns.

{{cite CanLII|litigants='''Peracomo Inc v TELUS Communications Co'''|link=|year=2014|court=scc|num=29}} is a decision of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] concerning the law of [[marine insurance]], which also has international impact.

==Background==
{{quotation|Réal Vallée is a good man; a decent man; an honest man{{emdash}}a [[fisherman]]. However he did a very stupid thing. He cut the plaintiffs’ submarine [[fibre optic cable]] in two. It cost them almost $1,000,000 to repair it.|[[Sean J. Harrington|Harrington J]], opening his judgment at [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court]]}}

In 1999, [[QuébecTel]] (subsequently acquired by [[Telus]]), in conjunction with [[Hydro-Québec]], laid two fibre optic cables across the [[Saint Lawrence River]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date= 24 September 1999|title= Quebec Tel and Hydro Quebec Launch Cable-Laying Operations for 156 km of Fiber Optic Cable Under the St. Lawrence River|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=L_lxQN9UmIAC&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;ots=MZEzE9TaCU&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepageI&amp;f=false|journal= Fiber Optics Weekly Update|publisher= Information Gatekeepers, Inc|location = Boston|volume= 19|issue= 39|at= p. 3|issn=1051-189X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Sunoque I, from [[Pointe-au-Père, Quebec|Point-au-Père]] to [[Baie-Comeau]], and
:* Sunoque II, from [[Le Bic, Quebec|Le Bic]] to [[Forestville, Quebec|Forrestville]].

In June 2006, Réal Vallée, a local fisherman engaged in [[snow crab]] and [[whelk]] fishing{{efn|in an area of the St. Lawrence River known as Zone 17&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Quebec and Gulf Regions: Fishing Areas for Snow Crab|url = http://www.qc.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/peches-fisheries/en/cartes/pdf/Crabe_des_Neiges.pdf|publisher = [[Fisheries and Oceans Canada]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} aboard the [[catamaran]] ''Realice'', had strung a series of cages on the river bottom, secured at both ends by small anchors attached to buoys. One of these anchors got snagged onto the cable. The anchor with the cable attached was hauled out of the water, and Vallée freed it by cutting the cable with an electric saw. Several days later, the same thing happened and he cut the cable again. He had done so, believing that the cable had been abandoned (according to a handwritten note on a map he had seen at a local museum).{{efn|"After the fishing season, he was visiting Église Saint-George, a deconsecrated church in Baie-Comeau, which is now a museum. He saw there a chart with a line drawn across the river in the area where he usually fished. The word "''abandonné''" was written thereon by hand. Without giving it a second thought, he concluded that this was what he was hooking with his anchor. He only glanced at it for a matter of seconds and cannot recall whether it was a marine chart, a topographical chart, or indeed what type of map it was at all."&lt;ref&gt;FC, par. 40&lt;/ref&gt;}} Remote monitoring controls operated by Telus indicated that the Sunoque I parted about {{convert|8.9|km|nmi|abbr=off}} off Baie-Comeau.

Telus, Hydro-Québec, and [[Bell Canada]] (which had a right of use of the cable), shared the cost of repair in accordance with a pre-existing contract among them. When Vallée learned of the repairs that were being undertaken, he consulted a lawyer, notified his underwriters (who promptly denied coverage), and made a voluntary statement to the police. He was later charged with committing [[mischief]] by wilfully damaging property exceeding $5,000 in value,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCC|430}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=R. c. Vallée|link=|year=2008|court=qccq|num=1086|format=|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2008-02-26|courtname=auto|juris=}}{{fr-icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Telus and Hydro-Québec commenced an action in the [[Federal Court (Canada)|Federal Court of Canada]]:

:* ''[[in personam]]'' against Peracomo Inc. (the owner of the ''Realice'') and Vallée, and
:* ''[[in rem]]'' against the ship.

The defendants also instituted third party proceedings against their underwriters, [[RSA Insurance Group|Royal and Sun Alliance Insurance Company of Canada]] in order to regain their insurance cover.

==The courts below==
At the Federal Court:&lt;ref&gt;FC, Judgment after par. 97&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Paquet|first= Charlotte|date= 20 May 2011|title= Un pêcheur de Baie-Comeau mis à l'amende pour 1,2 M $ |trans-title=Baie-Comeau fisherman is ordered to pay $1.2 million|url= http://www.pleinjourdebaiecomeau.ca/2011/05/20/un-pecheur-de-baie-comeau-mis-a-lamende-pour-12-m-|language= fr|newspaper= Plein Jour de Baie-Comeau|location= [[Baie-Comeau]]|publisher= [[Québecor]]|accessdate= 3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* The defendants were found to have [[joint and several liability]] for the damage, with the plaintiffs being awarded damages and interest amounting to about $1.21 million.
:* The defendants’ third party action was dismissed.
:* Costs were awarded in favour of the plaintiffs and the third party against the defendants.

Harrington J, in his ruling, found that:

:* the appellants were liable in [[negligence]] for damaging the cable because Vallée had breached his common law [[duty of care]] and statutory duty to be aware of the submarine cables in the areas in which he fished.&lt;ref&gt;FC, par. 34, 49&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Peracomo Inc. was liable for Mr. Vallée’s actions, not only [[vicarious liability|vicariously]], but also personally.&lt;ref&gt;FC, par. 50, citing {{cite court |litigants= Lennard's Carrying Co Ltd v Asiatic Petroleum Co Ltd|vol= &amp;#91;1915&amp;#93;|reporter= AC|opinion= 705|pinpoint= |court= |date= 8 March 1915|url= http://www.uniset.ca/other/cs2/1915AC705.html|accessdate= |quote=}} and {{cite CanLII|litigants=Canadian Dredge &amp; Dock Co. v.

:* while the ''Marine Liability Act'' provided for liability to be capped at $500,000 for [[property damage]] caused by ships similar in size to the ''Realice'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|link = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/M-0.7/section-29.html|linkloc = Justice Laws Website|short title = Marine Liability Act|abbr = SC|year = 2001|chapter = 6|section = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt; art. 4 of the ''[[Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims]]'' provides that the cap does not apply where a loss resulted from a person’s intentional or reckless conduct.{{efn|"If recklessness is in issue, and I think it is not, Mr. Vallée was reckless in the extreme."&lt;ref&gt;FC, par. 84&lt;/ref&gt;}}
:* coverage of the loss through the appellants' [[insurance policy]] was excluded by the ''Marine Insurance Act'',{{efn|similar in scope to the English ''[[Marine Insurance Act 1906]]''}} because cutting the cable fell within the statutory exclusion from [[marine insurance|marine liability insurance]] for "wilful misconduct".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite canlaw|link = http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/M-0.6/section-53.html|linkloc = Justice Laws Website|short title = Marine Insurance Act|abbr = SC|year = 1993|chapter = 22|section = 53|subsection = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] affirmed the ruling. In his ruling, [[Gilles Létourneau|Létourneau JA]] also held that, under existing precedent,{{efn|{{cite CanLII|litigants=ADGA Systems International Ltd. v.

Kuehne &amp; Nagel International Ltd.|link=London Drugs Ltd. v. Kuehne &amp; Nagel International Ltd.|year=1992|court=scc|num=41|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=[1992] 3 SCR 299|date=1992-10-29|courtname=|juris=}}}} employees, officers and directors will be held personally liable for tortious conduct causing property damage even when their actions are pursuant to their duties to the corporation. In addition, the ''Convention'' contemplates such scenarios.&lt;ref&gt;FCA, par. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Vallée appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Paquet|first= Charlotte|date= 25 September 2012|title= Le pêcheur Réal Vallée se tourne vers la Cour suprême |trans-title=Fisherman Réal Vallée is heading to the Supreme Court|url= http://www.pleinjourdebaiecomeau.ca/2012/09/25/le-pecheur-real-vallee-se-tourne-vers-la-cour-supreme|language= fr|newspaper= Plein Jour de Baie-Comeau|location= [[Baie-Comeau]]|publisher= [[Québecor]]|accessdate= 3 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and leave to appeal was granted in January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII|litigants=Péracomo Inc. et al. v. Telus Communications Company|link=|year=2013|court=scc-l|num=2388|format=canlii|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==At the Supreme Court==
In a 4-1 ruling, the appeal was allowed in part. In relation to the appellants’ limitation of liability, the appeal was allowed with costs but including only one-half of their costs of the leave application. The appellants’ joint and several liability is limited by the ''Convention''. In relation to the claim against the insurer, the appeal was dismissed with costs including its costs of the leave application.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 72&lt;/ref&gt; In his ruling, Cromwell J held that:

#Corporate personality is not a relevant consideration in this case, since Vallée was personally negligent in cutting the cable. Therefore, the company was liable as a result of his acts, not the other way around. The courts below were correct in holding Vallée personally liable.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
#The Federal Court of Appeal gave a narrow interpretation to the intent requirement under art. 4 of the ''Convention'', effectively stating that all that was required to break the limit on liability is knowledge that one is interfering with property. Such an approach undermines the ''Convention''’s purpose to establish a virtually unbreakable limit on liability and does not accord with its text.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 23&lt;/ref&gt;
#While the threshold to break liability under the ''Convention'' requires intention or recklessness with knowledge that the loss will probably occur, wilful misconduct under the ''Marine Insurance Act'' does not require either intention to cause the loss or subjective knowledge that the loss will probably occur.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 67&lt;/ref&gt; In that regard, "wilful misconduct" has a different meaning under [[Canadian maritime law]] than it does under the ''[[Civil Code of Quebec]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CCQ|2576}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, the appellants’ loss is excluded from insurance coverage.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissent===
While agreeing with Cromwell J that the ''Convention'' applied so as to limit liability, Wagner J believed that the relevant provision of the ''Marine Insurance Act'' must be read harmoniously with the ''Convention'''s provisions, and would have therefore allowed the appeal in its entirety, with costs.&lt;ref name = "SCC73"/&gt; Both the provisions at issue require proof of the same fact: that the insured had knowledge of the harmful consequences of his or her act, and intended or was reckless with regard to those consequences.&lt;ref name = "SCC73"&gt;SCC, par. 73&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that a reasonable person ought to have known or that a person had a duty to know, does not suffice to characterize the misconduct as willful.{{efn|"...this proposition is consistent with the English cases, according to which misconduct will be characterized as wilful only if the person liable for it intended it to happen."&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 87, citing (among other cases) {{cite court |litigants= Compania Maritima San Basilio S.A. v. The Oceanus Mutual Underwriting Association (Bermuda) Ltd. (The “Eurysthenes”)|vol= &amp;#91;1976&amp;#93; 2|reporter= Lloyd’s Rep|opinion= 171|pinpoint= |court= EWCA|date= 26 May 1976|url= http://www.ismcode.net/legal_and_technical_reports/The_Eurysthenes.pdf|accessdate= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It is also necessary to establish that the person intended to cause a loss, or to prove gross negligence or misconduct in which there is a very marked departure from the conduct of a reasonable person.&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
As ''Peracomo'' was concerned with the interpretation of the ''Convention'', and could therefore have a wide-reaching impact on commercial maritime law around the world, the case attracted international attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Emilie Bokor-Ingram|title = Submarine cables and limitation of liability|at = p. 4|url = http://www.hfw.com/downloads/HFW-Shipping-Bulletin-0613.pdf|journal = Shipping Bulletin|publisher = [[Holman Fenwick Willan]]|location = London|date = July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Cutting a submarine cable can cost you, your vessel and your insurance protection!|url = http://www.squiresanders.com/files/Publication/f6748b4e-e83d-4896-b17e-e60c2dda263f/Presentation/PublicationAttachment/d50dfddf-a4cf-49bf-9956-e6900e5e3467/Squire_Sanders_Publication_Cutting_a_Submarine_Cable.pdf|publisher = [[Squire Sanders|Squire Sanders (US) LLP]]|location = New York|date = January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is of interest to insurers in the areas of marine insurance and [[protection and indemnity insurance]].&lt;ref name = "BLG_FW"/&gt;

The Court looked to previous cases concerning the ''Convention'',{{efn|{{cite BAILII|litigants= Margolle &amp; Anor v Delta Maritime Company Ltd. &amp; Ors (The "Saint-Jacques II" and "Gudermes")|link=|court=EWHC|division=Admlty|year=2002|num=2452|parallelcite=[2003] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 203|date=28 November 2002}}; {{cite BAILII|litigants=Schiffahrtsgesellschaft MS Merkur Sky mbH &amp; Co KG v MS Leerort Nth Schiffahrt (The "Leerort")|link=|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=2001|num=1055|parallelcite= [2001] 2 Lloyd's Rep 291|date=27 June 2001}}}} as well as examining the ''[[Warsaw Convention]]'' (which had inspired art. 4).&lt;ref name = "BLG_FW"&gt;{{cite web|author1 = Jean-Marie Fontaine|author2 = Graham Walker|title = Supreme Court of Canada weighs in on conduct barring limitation|url = http://www.blg.com/en/newsandpublications/publication_3713|publisher = [[Borden Ladner Gervais]]|date = 29 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It effectively pointed out that art. 4 focuses on an intention to cause the loss, while the right to limit under the ''Convention'' relates more generally to the claim.&lt;ref name = "BLG_FW"/&gt; It also affirmed that the limitation of liability regime under the ''Convention'' is "virtually unbreakable",&lt;ref&gt;SCC, par. 25&lt;/ref&gt; which was already the view of many legal observers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Megan E. Whittle|title = ''Peracomo Inc. v.

As Wagner J pointed out, formalizing a legal difference between "reckless conduct" and "wilful misconduct" is likely to have commercial implications, and possibly increase litigation between marine insurers and their insureds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author = Gavin Magrath|title = Damages limited but not covered in ''Telus v Peracomo''|url = http://magraths.ca/2014/04/damages-limited-but-not-covered-in-telus-v-peracomo/|publisher = Magrath's|date = 23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislative substance ==
Under the bill, a person who was attacked after the attacker was substantially spurred by pornography could have been able to sue the [[pornography]]'s producers, publishers, distributors, exhibitors, and sellers without needing a prior [[Indictment|criminal charge]] against the pornography itself.&lt;ref name="ABAJ-Feminists-Back-Bill"&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=4&amp;did=8728422&amp;SrchMode=2&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1264360124&amp;clientId=7514 Reske, Henry J., ''Feminists Back Anti-Porn Bill'', in ''American Bar Association Journal'' (ABAJ), Jun., 1992, vol. 78, p. 32 ({{ISSN|0747-0088}}) (''ProQuest'' database)], as accessed Jan. 24, 2010, or [http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?did=8728422&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;clientId=7514&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD alternative link].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Torrey, Morrison, ''The Resurrection of the Antipornography Ordinance'', in ''Texas Journal of Women and the Law'', vol. 2, issue 1, pp. 116–117 (Winter 1993) (author assoc. prof., De Paul Univ. Coll. of Law).&lt;/ref&gt; It was written not to prohibit any publication, but to hold liable for certain consequences, according to McConnell.&lt;ref name="ABAJ-Feminists-Back-Bill" /&gt; For political pragmatism, the bill was limited to [[child pornography]] and [[Obscenity|obscene material]], that being already unprotected by the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution's]] [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="ABAJ-Feminists-Back-Bill" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable"&gt;[http://proquest.umi.com/pqdweb?index=5&amp;did=56198293&amp;SrchMode=2&amp;sid=3&amp;Fmt=3&amp;VInst=PROD&amp;VType=PQD&amp;RQT=309&amp;VName=PQD&amp;TS=1264360771&amp;clientId=7514 Puente, Maria, ''Bill Holds Porn Producers Liable For Sex Crimes'', in ''USA Today'', Apr. 15, 1992, p. 09A (Final ed.)

As part of the rationale for passage, McConnell argued "that crime is fostered by a culture in which the sexual degradation, abuse, and murder of women and children are a form of entertainment", that "[t]he connection between the amount of violent entertainment and the amount of real-life violence is no longer seriously doubted among social scientists," that "more than one million children from six months to sixteen years old are sexually molested and then filmed or photographed", and that "[p]ornography is fueling violence in this country".&lt;ref&gt;Four quotations: Greco, Albert N., ''The First Amendment, Freedom of the Press, and the Issue of "Harm": A Conundrum for Publishers'', in ''Publishing Research Quarterly'', vol. 11, no. 4, p. 48 &amp; nn. 35–37 (Winter 1995/96) (author clinical assoc. prof., N.Y.

== History ==
The bill or versions of it had been under Congressional consideration for seven years prior. Earlier versions reached a wider range of pornography&lt;ref name="ABAJ-Feminists-Back-Bill" /&gt; but had less support; narrowing that range to what was unprotected by [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions on the First Amendment led to wider support.

Other versions, searched for as introduced from approximately 1973 to part of 2010, included these:
* ''Pornography Victims Protection Act of 1984'', S. 3063 in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], introduced by Sen. [[Arlen Specter]] with no cosponsors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bssQuery/?&amp;Opt=T&amp;Db=098&amp;srch=/home/LegislativeData.php?n=BSS&amp;TxtStr=PORNOGRAPHY+VICTIMS+PROTECTION+ACT+OF+1984 ''Bill Summary &amp; Status Search Results'', in ''THOMAS'' website of ''The Library of Congress''], as accessed Sep. 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Hearings were held and, according to Sen. Specter, "[w]itnesses disagreed sharply about the general social effects of such [pornographic] materials. Some, such as Andrea Dworkin and Catherine {{sic}} MacKinnon, claimed that violent pornography is central to gender unequally {{sic}} in our society. Others, including Barry Lynn of the American Civil Liberties Union, denied that such a broad factual claim has been conclusively established.&lt;ref name="CongRcd-10-3084-p29169"&gt;United States of America, ''Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the 98th Congress Second Session'', vol. 130, part 21, p. 29169, Oct. 3, 1984 (Washington [D.C.]: U.S. Gov't Printing Ofc., [final or permanent ed.

Specter asked that his Federal bill be printed with his statement, per ''id.'', p. 29170, it was not (pp. 29170–29175)) (pp. 29153–29154 &amp; 29169–29175 may correlate for content with, in the daily ed., p. S&amp;nbsp;13192 &amp; probably other pp.).&lt;/ref&gt; Sen. Specter considered it "premature" to introduce legislation "based on a civil rights approach", referring to an [[Indianapolis]] ordinance and a proposed [[Minneapolis]] ordinance,&lt;ref name="CongRcd-10-3084-p29169" /&gt; but did introduce S. 3063&lt;ref name="CongRcd-10-3084-p29169" /&gt; instead.

== Supporters and opponents ==

=== 1991 bill ===
Support came from [[Feminists Fighting Pornography]] and 200 [[National Organization for Women|National Organization for Women (NOW)]] chapters, but not two in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[California]]&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable" /&gt; and not from the national level of NOW.&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt; Support simultaneously came from Christian fundamentalists.&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt;

Opponents included [[Nadine Strossen]], [[Betty Friedan]], [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Katha Pollitt]], [[Karen DeCrow]], [[Nora Ephron]], [[Mary Gordon (child advocate)|Mary Gordon]], [[Judy Blume]], [[Jamaica Kincaid]], [[Erica Jong]], [[Susan Isaacs]], and "172 other feminist women"&lt;ref name="VaLRvw-CritCritPorn-esp-appx"&gt;Strossen, Nadine, ''A Feminist Critique of "the" Feminist Critique of Pornography'', in ''Virginia Law Review'', vol. 79, no. 5 (Aug., 1993), p. 1099 ''ff.'' (essay), esp. p. 1188 ''ff.'' (appx.), in [https://dx.doi.org/10.2307%2F1073402 DOI link accessing ''JStor''] (or [https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/1073402.pdf direct ''JStor'' link]), both as accessed Sep. 7, 2010 (former leading to latter).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mary Morello]].

=== 1992 bill ===
Supporters, according to Sen. McConnell, included the [[Family Research Council]], Feminists Fighting Pornography, the [[American Family Association]], victims rights groups, and some chapters of the National Organization for Women.&lt;ref&gt;Greco, Albert N., ''The First Amendment, Freedom of the Press, and the Issue of "Harm"'', ''op. cit.'', p. 48 &amp; nn. 35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opposition was an editorial in [[The New York Times]].&lt;ref&gt;Greco, Albert N., ''The First Amendment, Freedom of the Press, and the Issue of "Harm"'', ''op. cit.'', p. 48 (''Times'' editorial published April 13, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
Criticisms came from more than one direction: that the bill would punish a wide range of nonpornographic movies because criminals were inspired by them,&lt;ref name="ABAJ-Feminists-Back-Bill" /&gt; that it would lead to bans of feminist positive literature about women,&lt;ref name="ABAJ-Feminists-Back-Bill" /&gt; that booksellers would be timid about many titles that weren't obscene but just generally controversial,&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable" /&gt; that scientists hadn't established a firm link between porn and misbehavior,&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt; that criminals should be held responsible for their actions rather than third parties being held liable,&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt; that similar legislation against bars because subsequent drunken driving led to accidents had not been tested against major beer producers,&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable" /&gt; that using civil procedure rather than criminal to test if material is obscene when the standard of proof is lower in civil cases would make finding it obscene more likely,&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt; that juries seeing an attacked woman as a victim would be likelier to judge that material was obscene,&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt; that obscenity being defined by community standards and retailers' skittishness meant that the strictest community would be the standard-bearer for the nation,&lt;ref name="Bundy-NewRepub" /&gt; and that it didn't encompass all the pornography that feminists found violated women's civil rights.&lt;ref name="USAT-Bill-Liable" /&gt;

In the [[United States]], '''Social Security''' is the commonly used term for the [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] '''Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance''' ('''OASDI''') program and is administered by the [[Social Security Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Administration, [https://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/progdesc/sspus/oasdi.pdf Social Insurance Programs], retrieved November 1, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[Social Security Act]] was signed into law by [[President Franklin Roosevelt]] in 1935,&lt;ref name="Social Security Act of 1935"&gt;Social Security Act of 1935 {{cite web| title=Legislative History 1935 Social Security Act | url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/35actinx.html | accessdate=November 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the current version of the Act, as amended,&lt;ref name="42 USC"&gt;[42 USC 7] {{cite web| title=US Code—Title 42—The Public Health and Welfare | url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title42/chapter7_.html | accessdate=November 8, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061012002738/http://www.access.gpo.gov/uscode/title42/chapter7_.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; encompasses several [[Social welfare provision|social welfare]] and [[social insurance]] programs.

Social Security is funded primarily through [[payroll tax]]es called [[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax]] (FICA) or Self Employed Contributions Act Tax (SECA). Tax deposits are collected by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and are formally entrusted to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, the two [[Social Security Trust Fund]]s.&lt;ref name="42 USC 401"&gt;{{cite web| title=42 USC 401, Trust Funds | url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/401- | accessdate=November 8, 2006}}four&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morton|first1=William R.|last2=Liou|first2=Wayne|title=Social Security: The Trust Funds|date=September 12, 2017|publisher=Congressional Research Service|location=Washington, DC|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33028.pdf|accessdate=October 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a few exceptions, all salaried income, up to an amount specifically determined by law (see tax rate table below), is subject to the Social Security payroll tax. All income over said amount is not taxed. In 2018, the maximum amount of taxable earnings was $128,400.&lt;ref name="United States Social Security Administration"&gt;{{cite web|last=United States Social Security Administration|title=Contribution and Benefit Base|url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With few exceptions, all legal residents working in the United States now have an individual Social Security number. Indeed, nearly all working (and many non-working) residents since Social Security's 1935 inception have had a Social Security number because it is requested by a wide range of businesses.

In 2015, Social Security expenditures totaled $750.5 billion for OASDI and $146.6 billion for DI.&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov"&gt;[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/ A SUMMARY OF THE 2016 ANNUAL REPORTS], Social Security and Medicare Boards of Trustees

A limited form of the Social Security program began, during [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Franklin D. Roosevelt's]] first term, as a measure to implement "[[Social security|social insurance]]" during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s.&lt;ref name="college.hmco.com.653"&gt;{{cite web| title=A Reader's Companion to American History: Poverty | url=http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/rcah/html/ah_070900_poverty.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210081706/http://college.hmco.com/history/readerscomp/rcah/html/ah_070900_poverty.htm |archivedate=February 10, 2006 |accessdate=June 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act was an attempt to limit unforeseen and unprepared-for dangers in modern life, including old age, disability, poverty, unemployment, and the burdens of widow(er)s with and without children.

Opponents, however, decried the proposal as socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Finance, Business, Economics: Huge Old-Age Reserve Fund Under Doughton Bill Gives Treasury Extensive New Financial Powers; Could Be Used to Control Credit Also |work= The Washington Post |date= April 25, 1935 |page= 23 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/150734868/|quote= "The social security bill, in its present form, is thus not only a sweeping piece of legislation, but also a far-reaching financial measure.

The provisions of Social Security have been changing since the 1930s, shifting in response to economic worries as well as coverage for the poor, dependent children, spouses, survivors and the disabled.&lt;ref&gt;Achenbaum, Andrew. Social Security Visions and Revisions, 1986. p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1950, debates moved away from which occupational groups should be included to get enough taxpayers to fund Social Security to how to provide more benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler-Harris, Alice.

The largest component of OASDI is the payment of [[retirement]] benefits. These retirement benefits are a form of social insurance that is heavily biased toward lower paid workers to make sure they do not have to retire in relative poverty. With few exceptions, throughout a worker's career, the Social Security Administration and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] (IRS) keeps track of his or her earnings and requires Federal Insurance Contribution Act, [[FICA]] or Self Employed Contribution Act, SECA, taxes to be paid on the earnings. The OASI accounts plus trust funds are the only Social Security funding source that brings in more than it sends out.

Social Security revenues exceeded expenditures, between 1983 and 2009.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/43648-SocialSecurity.pdf The 2012 Long-Term Projections for Social Security] ''[[Congressional Budget Office]]'' October 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The disability insurance (DI) taxes of 1.4% are included in the OASDI rate of 6.2% for workers and employers or 12.4% for the self-employed. Outgo of $140.3 billion while having income of only $109.1 billion means the disability trust fund is rapidly being depleted and may require either revisions on what "disabilities" are included/allowed/defined as, fraud minimization or tax increases.

The Medicare hospital insurance, HI, (Part A: Hospital Insurance, inpatient care, skilled nursing facility care, home health care, and hospice care) expenditure rate of $266.8 billion in 2012—while bringing in only $243.0 billion—means that the medicare HI trust funds are being seriously depleted and increased taxes or reduced coverage will be required. The additional retirees expected under the "baby boom bulge" will hasten this trust fund depletion. Medicare expenses, tied to medical costs growth rates, have traditionally increased much faster than GDP growth rates.&lt;ref name="cms.gov"&gt;Medicare fast facts [http://www.cms.gov/fastfacts/] accessed November 17, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supplementary Medical Insurance, SMI, (otherwise known as Medicare Part B &amp; D) expenditure rate of $307.4 billion in 2012 while bringing in only $293.9 billion means that the Supplementary Medical Insurance trust funds are also being seriously depleted and increased tax rates or reduced coverage will be required. The additional retirees expected under the "baby boom bulge" will hasten this trust fund depletion as well as legislation to end the Medicare Part D medical prescription drug funding "donut hole" are all tied to medical costs growth rates, which have traditionally increased much faster than GDP growth rates.&lt;ref name="cms.gov" /&gt;

For workers the [[Social Security tax]] rate is 6.2% on income under $127,200 through the end of 2017.&lt;ref name="United States Social Security Administration"/&gt; The worker Medicare tax rate is 1.45% of all income—employers pay another 1.45%. Employers pay 6.2% up to the wage ceiling and the Medicare tax of 1.45 percent on all income. Workers defined as "self employed" pay 12.4% on income under $113,700 and a 2.9% Medicare tax on all income.

The amount of the monthly Social Security benefit to which a worker is entitled depends upon the earnings record they have paid FICA or SECA taxes on and upon the age at which the retiree chooses to begin receiving benefits.

===Primary Insurance Amount and benefit calculations===
{{Main|Primary Insurance Amount}}

All workers paying [[FICA]] ([[Federal Insurance Contributions Act]]) and SECA (Self Employed Contributions Act) taxes for forty quarters of credit (QC) or more on a specified minimum income or more are "fully insured" and eligible to retire at age 62 with reduced benefits and higher benefits at full retirement ages, FRA, of 65, 66 or 67 depending on birth date.&lt;ref name="socialsecuritypotluckdotcom.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Minimum salary needed for Social Security vesting|url=http://socialsecuritypotluckdotcom.wordpress.com/2010/08/20/question-1-when-does-one-become-fully-vested-in-social-security/|accessdate=November 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retirement benefits depend upon the "adjusted" average wage earned in the last 35 years. Wages of earlier years are "adjusted" before averaging by multiplying each annual salary by an annual adjusted wage index factor, AWI, for earlier salaries.&lt;ref name="ssa.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Your Retirement Benefit: How It's Figured|url=http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10070.pdf|accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adjusted wages for 35 years are always used to compute the 35 year "average" indexed monthly salary. Only wages lower than the "ceiling" income are considered in calculating the adjusted average wage. If the worker has fewer than 35 years of covered earnings these non-contributory years are assigned zero earnings. If there are more than 35 years of covered earnings only the highest 35 are considered. The sum of the 35 adjusted salaries (or less if worker has less than 35 years of covered income) times its inflation index, AWI divided by 420 (35 years x 12 months per year) gives the 35-year covered Average Indexed Monthly salary, [[Average Indexed Monthly Earnings|AIME]].&lt;ref name="ssa.gov" /&gt;

To calculate a person's Average Indexed Monthly salary (AIME) earnings, the records of their covered salaries may be obtained from the Social Security Administration by applying for them and paying a fee ranging from $15.00 for one year's covered wages to $80.00 for 40 years of wages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Request for Social Security Earnings Information |url=http://www.ssa.gov/online/ssa-7050.pdf|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The adjusted wage indexes are available at Social Security's "Benefit Calculation Examples For Workers Retiring In 2013".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Benefit Calculation Examples For Workers Retiring In 2013|url=http://www.ssa.gov/oact/progdata/retirebenefit1.html|accessdate=October 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To calculate the total benefits a retiree is eligible for, the average indexed monthly salary (AIME) is then divided into three separate salary brackets—each multiplied by a different benefit percentage. The benefits receivable (the so-called Primary Insurance Amount, PIA) are the sum of the salary in each bracket times the benefit percentages that apply to each bracket. The benefit percentages are set by Congress and so can easily change in the future. The ''bendpoints'', where the brackets change, are adjusted for inflation each year by Social Security. For example, in 2013 the first bracket runs from $1 to $791/month and is multiplied by the benefit percentage of 90%, the second salary bracket extends from $791 to $4,781/month is multiplied by 32%, the third salary bracket of more than $4,781/month is multiplied by 15%. Any higher incomes than the ceiling income are not FICA covered and are not considered in the benefits calculation or in determining the average indexed monthly salary, AIME. At full retirement age the projected retirement income amount (PIA) is the sum of these three brackets of income multiplied by the appropriate benefit percentages—90%, 32% and 15%. Unlike income tax brackets, the Social Security benefits are heavily biased towards lower salaried workers. Social Security has always been primarily a retirement, disability and spousal insurance policy for low wage workers and a very poor retirement plan for higher salaried workers who hopefully have a supplemental retirement plan unless they want to live on significantly less after retirement than they used to earn.

Full retirement age spouses and divorced spouses (married over 10 years before divorce) are entitled to the higher of 50% of the wage earners benefits or their own earned benefits. A low salary worker and his full retirement age spouse making less than or equal to $791/month with 40 quarters of employment credit and at full retirement age (65 if born before 1938, 66 if born from 1938 to 1954 and 67 if born after 1960) could retire with 135% of his indexed average salary. A full retirement age worker and his full retirement age spouse making the ceiling income or more would be eligible for 43% of the ceiling FICA salary (29% if single) and even less if making more than the ceiling income.

During working years, the low wage worker is eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit (FICA refunds) and federal child credits and may pay little or no FICA tax or Income tax. By Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculations the lowest income quintile (0–20%) and second quintile (21–40%) of households in the U.S. pay an average income tax of −9.3% and −2.6% and Social Security taxes of 8.3% and 7.9% respectively. By CBO calculations the household incomes in the first quintile and second quintile have an '''average Total Federal Tax rate''' of 1.0% and 3.8% respectively.&lt;ref name="cbo.gov"&gt;The Distribution of Household Income and Federal Taxes, 2008 and 2009, Supplemental Tables; Table 1 [http://www.cbo.gov/publication/43373] accessed October 13, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Higher income retirees will have to pay income taxes on 85% of their Social Security benefits and 100% on all other retirement benefits they may have.&lt;ref name="ssa.gov" /&gt;

All workers paying FICA and SECA taxes for forty quarters of credit (QC) or more on a specified minimum income is "fully insured" and eligible to retire at age 62 with reduced benefits.&lt;ref name="socialsecuritypotluckdotcom.wordpress.com" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Social Security "fully insured" status [http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title02/0214.htm] accessed November 7, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In general the Social Security Administration tries to limit the projected lifetime benefits to the same amounts of retirement income the recipient would receive if retiring at full retirement age. If a recipient retires earlier he/she draws a lower Social Security benefit income for a longer prospective lifetime after retirement. The basic correction of benefits are age 62 retirees can only draw 75% of what they would draw at full retirement age with higher percentages at different ages more than 62 and less than full retirement age.

Similar computations based on career average adjusted earnings and age of recipient determine disability and survivor benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://actionecon.com/know-social-security-benefits/|title=7 Steps To Optimize Your Social Security Benefits|work=Action Economics|accessdate=September 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal, state and local employees who have elected (when they could) NOT to pay FICA taxes are eligible for a reduced FICA benefits and full Medicare coverage if they have more than forty quarters of qualifying Social Security covered work.&lt;ref name="socialsecuritypotluckdotcom.wordpress.com" /&gt; To minimize the Social Security payments to those who have not contributed to FICA for 35+ years and are eligible for federal, state and local benefits, which are usually more generous, Congress passed the Windfall Elimination Provision, WEP.&lt;ref&gt;Windfall Elimination Provision [http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/EN-05-10045.pdf] accessed October 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The WEP provision will not eliminate all Social Security or Medicare eligibility if the worker has 40 quarters of qualifying income, but calculates the benefit payments by reducing the 90% multiplier in the first salary bracket to 40–85% depending on age etc. The WEP provision rarely causes hardship since by and large the people affected are reasonably well off because by definition they also receive government pensions from noncovered work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/98-35.pdf|title = Social Security: The Windfall Elimination Provision (WEP)|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For those few cases where workers with very low earnings over a long working lifetime that were too low to receive full retirement credits&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Projected demise of the special minimum benefit program [http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/note2000s/note143.html] accessed October 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and the recipients would receive a very small Social Security retirement benefit a "special minimum benefit" (special minimum PIA) provides a "minimum" of $804 per month in Social Security benefits in 2013. To be eligible the recipient along with their auxiliaries and survivors must have very low assets and not be eligible for other retirement system benefits. About 75,000 people in 2013 receive this benefit.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Special Minimum Benefit [http://www.ssa.gov/retirementpolicy/projections/special-minimum.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192643/http://www.ssa.gov/retirementpolicy/projections/special-minimum.html |date=October 29, 2013 }} accessed October 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The benefits someone is eligible for are potentially so complicated that potential retirees should consult the Social Security Administration directly for advice. Many questions are addressed and at least partially answered on many online publications and online calculators.
{{Main|Retirement Insurance Benefits}}

===Online benefits estimate===
On July 22, 2008, the Social Security Administration introduced a new online benefits estimator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/estimator/ |title=Retirement Estimator |publisher=Ssa.gov |date=July 25, 2011 |accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Taylor| first = Andrew| title = Social Security unveils new earnings calculator| newspaper = [[USA Today]]| date = July 22, 2008 | url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; A worker who has enough Social Security credits to qualify for benefits, but who is not currently receiving benefits on his or her own Social Security record and who is not a Medicare beneficiary, can obtain an estimate of the retirement benefit that will be provided, for different assumptions about age at retirement. This process is done by opening a secure online account called ''my Social Security.'' For retirees who have non FICA or SECA taxed wages the rules get complicated and probably require additional help.

===Normal retirement age===
The earliest age at which (reduced) benefits are payable is 62. Full retirement benefits depend on a retiree's year of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/ProgData/nra.html| title=Normal Retirement Age| date=September 19, 2005| accessdate= May 14, 2006| publisher= [[Social Security Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This table was copied in November 2011 from the Social Security Administration web site cited above and referenced in the footnotes. There are different rules for widows and widowers. Also from that site, come the following two notes:
Notes:
1. Persons born on January 1 of any year should refer to the normal retirement age for the previous year.
2. For the purpose of determining benefit reductions for early retirement, widows and widowers whose entitlement is based on having attained age 60 should add 2 years to the year of birth shown in the table.

Those born before 1938 have a normal retirement age of 65. Normal retirement age increases by two months for each ensuing year of birth until 1943, when it reaches 66 and stays at 66 until 1955. Thereafter the normal retirement age increases again by two months for each year until 1960, when normal retirement age is 67 and remains 67 for all individuals born thereafter.

A worker who starts benefits before normal retirement age has their benefit reduced based on the number of months before normal retirement age they start benefits. This reduction is 5/9 of 1% for each month up to 36 and then 5/12 of 1% for each additional month. This formula gives an 80% benefit at age 62 for a worker with a normal retirement age of 65, a 75% benefit at age 62 for a worker with a normal retirement age of 66, and a 70% benefit at age 62 for a worker with a normal retirement age of 67. The [[Great Recession]] has resulted in an increase in [[long-term unemployment]] and an increase in workers taking [[early retirement]].&lt;ref name="NYT62"&gt;{{cite news|title=Forced to Early Social Security, Unemployed Pay a Steep Price|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/business/forced-to-retire-early-jobless-pay-a-steep-price.html|accessdate=June 10, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 9, 2012|author=Motoko Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A worker who delays starting retirement benefits past normal retirement age earns delayed retirement credits that increase their benefit until they reach age 70. These credits are also applied to their widow(er)'s benefit. Children and spouse benefits are not affected by these credits.

The normal retirement age for widow(er) benefits shifts the year-of-birth schedule upward by two years, so that those widow(er)s born before 1940 have age 65 as their normal retirement age.

===Spouse's benefit and government pension offsets===
The spousal ''retirement benefit'' is ''one-half'' the ''PIA'' benefit amount of their spouse or their own earned benefits, whichever is higher, if they both retire at "normal" retirement ages. Only after the working spouse applies for retirement benefits may the non-working spouse apply for spousal retirement benefits. The spousal benefit is the PIA times an "early-retirement factor" if the spouse is younger than the "normal" full retirement age. The '''early-retirement factor''' is 50% minus 25/36 of 1% per month for the first 36 months and 5/12 of 1% for each additional month earlier than the "normal" full retirement date. This typically works out to between 50% and 32.5% of the primary workers PIA benefit.&lt;ref&gt;Benefit Reduction for Early Retirement [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/quickcalc/earlyretire.html] accessed November 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; There is no increase for starting spousal benefits ''after'' normal retirement age. This can occur if there is a married couple in which the younger person is the only worker and is more than 5 years younger. Any current spouse is eligible, and [[divorced]] or former spouses are eligible for spousal benefits if the marriage lasted for at least 10 years. It is [[arithmetic]]ally possible for one worker to generate spousal benefits for up to five of his/her spouses that he/she may have, each must be in succession after a proper divorce for each after a marriage that lasted at least ten years each.

The spousal ''survivor benefit'' is the full PIA benefit of the working spouse (reduced if the deceased was receiving a reduced benefit)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ssa.gov/planners/survivors/ifyou5.html&lt;/ref&gt; or their own benefit, whichever is higher.

There is a '''Social Security government pension offset'''&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Government pension offset [http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10007.pdf] accessed November 14, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; that will reduce or eliminate any spousal (or ex-spouse) or widow(er)'s benefits if the spouse or widow(er) is also receiving a government (federal, state, or local) pension that did not require paying Social Security taxes. The basic "rule" is that Social Security benefits will be reduced by 2/3's of the spouse or widow(er)'s non-FICA taxed government pension. If the spouse's or widow(er)'s government (non-FICA paying) pension exceeds 150% of the "normal" spousal or widow(er)'s benefit the spousal benefit is eliminated. For example, a "normal" spousal or widow(er)'s benefit of $1,000/month would be reduced to $0.00 if the spouse or widow(er)'s if already drawing a non-FICA taxed government pension of $1,500/month or more per month. Pensions not based on income do not reduce Social Security spousal or widow(er)'s benefits.{{clarify|date=March 2016}}

The passage of the '''Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act''', in 2000, allows the worker to earn unlimited outside income without offsets in the year after they reach full retirement. It also allows the spouse and children of a worker who has reached normal full retirement age to receive benefits under some circumstances while he/she does not. The full retirement age worker must have begun the receipt of benefits, to allow the spousal/children's benefits to begin, and then subsequently suspended their own benefits in order to continue the postponement of benefits in exchange for an increased benefit amount (5.5–8.0%/yr increase)&lt;ref name="socialsecurity.gov"&gt;Delayed Retirement Credits [http://www.socialsecurity.gov/retire2/delayret.htm] accessed November 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; up to the age of 70. Thus a worker can delay retirement up to age seventy without affecting spousal or children's benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act [http://www.ssa.gov/legislation/legis_bulletin_040700.html] accessed November 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

If a worker delays receiving Social Security retirement benefits until after they reach full retirement age&lt;ref name="socialsecurity.gov" /&gt; there is a Social Security benefits increase by a certain percentage—depending on date of birth. After age 70 there are no more increases in retirement benefits allowed. Social Security uses an "average" survival rate at your full retirement age to prorate the increase in the amount of benefit increase so that the total benefits are roughly the same whenever you retire. Women may benefit more than men from this delayed benefit increase since the "average" survival rates are based on both men and women and women live approximately three years longer than men. The other consideration is that workers only have a limited number of years of "good" health left after they reach full retirement age and unless they enjoy their job they may be passing up an opportunity to do something else they may enjoy doing while they are still relatively healthy.

===Benefits while continuing work===
Due to changing needs or personal preferences, a person may go back to work after retiring. In this case, it is possible to get Social Security retirement or survivors benefits and work at the same time. A worker who is of full retirement age or older may (with spouse) keep all benefits, after taxes, regardless of earnings. But, if this worker or the worker's spouse are younger than full retirement age and receiving benefits and earn "too much", the benefits will be reduced. If working under full retirement age for the entire year and receiving benefits, Social Security deducts $1 from the worker's benefit payments for every $2 earned above the annual limit of $15,120 (2013). Deductions cease when the benefits have been reduced to zero and the worker will get one more year of income and age credit, slightly increasing future benefits at retirement. For example, if you were receiving benefits of $1,230/month (the average benefit paid) or $14,760 a year and have an income of $29,520/year above the $15,120 limit ($44,640/year) you would lose all ($14,760) of your benefits. If you made $1,000 more than $15,200/year you would "only lose" $500 in benefits. You would get no benefits for the months you work until the $1 deduction for $2 income "squeeze" is satisfied. Your first social security check will be delayed for several months—the first check may only be a fraction of the "full" amount. The benefit deductions change in the year you reach full retirement age and are still working—Social Security only deducts $1 in benefits for every $3 you earn above $40,080 in 2013 for that year and has no deduction thereafter. The income limits change (presumably for inflation) year by year.&lt;ref&gt;Working and Social Security Benefits [http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10069.pdf] accessed November 6, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|WIDOWBENEFITS}}Widow(er) benefits===
If a worker covered by Social Security dies, a surviving spouse can receive survivors' benefits. In some instances, survivors' benefits are available even to a [[divorce]]d spouse. A father or mother with minor or disabled children in his or her care can receive benefits which are not actuarially reduced. The earliest age for a non-disabled widow(er)'s benefit is age 60. The benefit is equal to the worker's basic retirement benefit (PIA) (reduced if the deceased was receiving reduced benefits) for spouses who are at, or older than, normal retirement age. If the surviving spouse starts benefits before normal retirement age, there is an [[actuarial]] reduction.&lt;ref name="SSApub10084" /&gt; If the worker earned delayed retirement credits by waiting to start benefits after their normal retirement age, the surviving spouse will have those credits applied to their benefit.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ssa.gov/planners/survivors/ifyou5.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children's benefits===
Children of a retired, disabled or deceased worker receive benefits as a "dependent" or "survivor" if they are under the age of 18, or as long as attending primary or secondary school up to age 19 years, 2 months; or are over the age of 18 and were disabled before the age of 22.&lt;ref name="SSApub10084"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10084.html|title=Survivors Benefits|year=2007|work=SSA Publication No. 05-10084, ICN 468540| publisher = [[Social Security Administration]] | accessdate= December 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSApub10085"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pubs/EN-05-10085.pdf|title=Benefits for Children|year=2012|work=SSA Publication No. EN-05-10085, ICN 468550| publisher = [[Social Security Administration]] | accessdate= March 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Astrue v. Capato]]'' (2012), the Supreme Court unanimously held that children conceived after a parent's death (by [[in vitro fertilization]] procedure) are not entitled to Social Security survivors' benefits if the laws of the state in which the parent's will was signed do not provide for such benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Mears, [http://articles.cnn.com/2012-05-21/justice/justice_scotus-posthumous-conception-ruling_1_survivors-benefits-children-justices Justices deny benefits for child conceived after death of a parent] (May 21, 2012). CNN.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disability===
{{More citations needed|date=November 2007}}
A worker who has worked long enough and recently enough (based on "quarters of coverage" within the recent past) to be covered ''can'' receive disability benefits. These benefits start after five full calendar months of disability, regardless of his or her age. The eligibility formula requires a certain number of credits (based on earnings) to have been earned overall, and a certain number within the ten years immediately preceding the disability, but with more-lenient provisions for younger workers who become disabled before having had a chance to compile a long earnings history.

The worker must be unable to continue in his or her previous job and unable to adjust to other work, with age, education, and work experience taken into account; furthermore, the disability must be long-term, lasting 12 months, expected to last 12 months, resulting in death, or expected to result in death.&lt;ref name="www.ssa.gov.652"&gt;{{cite web | title=What We Mean By Disability | url=http://www.ssa.gov/dibplan/dqualify4.htm | accessdate=December 3, 2005 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051130054729/http://www.ssa.gov/dibplan/dqualify4.htm | archive-date=November 30, 2005 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the retirement benefit, the amount of the disability benefit payable depends on the worker's age and record of covered earnings.

[[Supplemental Security Income]] (SSI) uses the same disability criteria as the insured social security disability program, but SSI is not based upon insurance coverage. Instead, a system of means-testing is used to determine whether the claimants' income and net worth fall below certain income and asset thresholds.

Severely disabled [[child]]ren may qualify for SSI. Standards for child disability are different from those for adults.

Disability determination at the Social Security Administration has created the largest system of administrative courts in the United States. Depending on the state of residence, a claimant whose initial application for benefits is denied can request ''reconsideration'' or a ''hearing before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ)''. Such hearings sometimes involve participation of an independent vocational expert (VE) or medical expert (ME), as called upon by the ALJ.

Reconsideration involves a re-examination of the evidence and, in some cases, the opportunity for a hearing before a (non-[[attorney at law (United States)|attorney]]) disability hearing officer. The hearing officer then issues a decision in writing, providing justification for his/her finding. If the claimant is denied at the reconsideration stage, (s)he may request a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. In some states, SSA has implemented a pilot program that eliminates the reconsideration step and allows claimants to appeal an initial denial directly to an Administrative Law Judge.

Because the number of applications for Social Security disability is very large (approximately 650,000 applications per year), the number of hearings requested by claimants often exceeds the capacity of Administrative Law Judges. The number of hearings requested and availability of Administrative Law Judges varies geographically across the United States. In some areas of the country, it is possible for a claimant to have a hearing with an Administrative Law Judge within 90 days of his/her request. In other areas, waiting times of 18 months are not uncommon.

After the hearing, the [[Administrative Law Judge]] (ALJ) issues a decision in writing. The decision can be ''Fully Favorable'' (the ALJ finds the claimant disabled as of the date that (s) he alleges in the application through the present), ''Partially Favorable'' (the ALJ finds the claimant disabled at some point, but not as of the date alleged in the application; OR the ALJ finds that the claimant ''was'' disabled but has improved), or ''Unfavorable'' (the ALJ finds that the claimant was not disabled at all). Claimants can appeal decisions to Social Security's Appeals Council, which is in [[Virginia]]. The Appeals Council does not hold hearings; it accepts written briefs. Response time from the Appeals Council can range from 12 weeks to more than 3 years.

If the claimant disagrees with the Appeals Council's decision, (s)he can appeal the case in the [[United States district court|federal district court]] for his/her jurisdiction. As in most federal court cases, an unfavorable district court decision can be appealed to the appropriate [[United States Court of Appeals]], and an unfavorable appellate court decision can be appealed to the [[United States Supreme Court]].

The Social Security Administration has maintained its goal for judges to resolve 500–700 cases per year but an Administrative Law Judge on the average nationwide disposes of approximately 400 cases per year. The debate about the social security system in the United States has been ongoing for decades and there is much concern about its sustainability.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

Under normal circumstances, FICA taxes or SECA taxes will be collected on all wages. About the only way to avoid paying either FICA or SECA taxes is to join a religion that does not believe in insurance, such as the [[Amish]], [[Christian Science]] or a religion whose members have taken a vow of poverty (see IRS publication 517&lt;ref&gt;Social Security and Other Information for Members of the Clergy and Religious Workers [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p517.pdf] accessed October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and 4361&lt;ref&gt;Application for Exemption From Self-Employment Tax for Use By Ministers, Members of Religious Orders and Christian Science Practitioners [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-prior/f4361--2011.pdf] accessed October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;). Federal workers employed before 1987, various state and local workers including those in some school districts who had their own retirement and disability programs were given the one-time option of joining Social Security. Many employees and retirement and disability systems opted to keep out of the Social Security system because of the cost and the limited benefits. It was often much cheaper to obtain much higher retirement and disability benefits by staying in their original retirement and disability plans.&lt;ref&gt;Why Illinois Teachers Aren't in Social Security [http://trs.illinois.gov/press/reform/ss_why.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110031413/http://trs.illinois.gov/press/reform/ss_why.htm |date=January 10, 2015 }} accessed October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Now only a few of these plans allow new hires to join their existing plans without also joining Social Security.

It is possible for railroad employees to get a "coordinated" retirement and disability benefits. The U.S. [[Railroad Retirement Board]] (or "RRB") is an independent agency in the executive branch of the United States government created in 1935&lt;ref&gt;Railroad Retirement Board [http://www.rrb.gov/opa/qa/pub_1004.asp] accessed October 15, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; to administer a social insurance program providing retirement benefits to the country's railroad workers. Railroad retirement Tier I payroll taxes are coordinated with social security taxes so that employees and employers pay Tier I taxes at the same rate as social security taxes and have the same benefits. In addition, both workers and employers pay Tier II taxes (about 6.2% in 2005), which are used to finance railroad retirement and disability benefit payments that are over and above social security levels. Tier 2 benefits are a supplemental retirement and disability benefit system that pays 0.875% times years of service times average highest five years of employment salary, in addition to Social Security benefits.

The FICA taxes are imposed on nearly all workers and self-employed persons. Employers are required&lt;ref name="26 USC 6051"&gt;{{cite web| title=26 USC 6051 | url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=browse_usc&amp;docid=Cite:+26USC6051 | accessdate=November 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; to report wages for covered employment to Social Security for processing Forms W-2 and W-3.

===Trust fund===
{{Main|Social Security Trust Fund}}
Social Security taxes are paid into the [[Social Security Trust Fund]] maintained by the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury]] (technically, the "Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund", as established by {{uscsub|42|401|a}}). Current year expenses are paid from current Social Security tax revenues. When revenues exceed expenditures, as they did between 1983 and 2009,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; the excess is invested in special series, non-marketable U.S. [[government bond]]s. Thus, the Social Security Trust Fund indirectly finances the federal government's general purpose [[deficit spending]]. In 2007, the cumulative excess of Social Security taxes and interest received over benefits paid out stood at $2.2 trillion.&lt;ref name="www.ssa.gov.659"&gt;{{cite web| title=OASDI Trust Funds | url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table4a3.html | accessdate=January 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regard the Trust Fund as an accounting construct with no economic significance. Others argue that it has specific legal significance because the Treasury securities it holds are backed by the "full faith and credit" of the U.S. government, which has an obligation to repay its debt.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

The Social Security Administration's authority to make benefit payments as granted by Congress extends only to its current revenues and existing Trust Fund balance, ''i.e.'', redemption of its holdings of Treasury securities. Therefore, Social Security's ability to make full payments once annual benefits exceed revenues depends in part on the federal government's ability to make good on the bonds that it has issued to the Social Security trust funds. As with any other federal obligation, the federal government's ability to repay Social Security is based on its power to tax and borrow and the commitment of Congress to meet its obligations.

In 2009 the Office of the Chief Actuary of the Social Security Administration calculated an unfunded obligation of $15.1 trillion for the Social Security program. The unfunded obligation is the difference between the future cost of Social Security (based on several demographic assumptions such as mortality, work force participation, immigration, and age expectancy) and total assets in the Trust Fund given the expected contribution rate through the current scheduled payroll tax. This unfunded obligation is expressed in present value dollars and is a part of the Fund's long-range actuarial estimates, not necessarily a certainty of what will occur in the long run. An Actuarial Note to the calculation says that "The term obligation is used in lieu of the term liability, because liability generally indicates a contractual obligation (as in the case of private pensions and insurance) that cannot be altered by the plan sponsor without the agreement of the plan participants."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Unfunded Obligation and Transition Cost for the OASDI Program |url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/NOTES/ran1/an2008-1.pdf |work=Actuarial Note 2008.1 |publisher=[[Social Security Administration]] |format=PDF |date=July 2008 |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 2009 Annual Report of the Board of Trustees of the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance Trust Funds |url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/TR/2009/tr09.pdf |publisher=[[Social Security Administration]] |format=PDF | date = May 2009 |accessdate=June 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Office of Hearings Operations (OHO, formerly ODAR or OHA)===
On August 8, 2017, Acting Commissioner Nancy A. Berryhill informed employees that the Office of Disability Adjudication and Review ("ODAR") would be renamed to Office of Hearings Operations ("OHO").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/appeals/hearing_process.html|title=SSA's Hearing Process, OHO|website=www.ssa.gov|language=en|access-date=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hearing offices had been known as "ODAR" since 2006, and the Office of Hearings and Appeals ("OHA") before that.  OHO administers the ALJ hearings for the Social Security Administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/appeals/about_us.html|title=Social Security's Hearings and Appeals|website=www.ssa.gov|language=en|access-date=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Administrative Law Judges ("ALJs") conduct hearings and issue decisions.  After an ALJ decision, the Appeals Council considers requests for review of ALJ decisions, and acts as the final level of administrative review for the Social Security Administration (the stage at which "exhaustion" could occur, a prerequisite for federal court review).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/oha/ SSA.gov] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012020248/http://www.ssa.gov/oha/ |date=October 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Benefit payout comparisons===
Some federal, state, local and education government employees pay no Social Security but have their own retirement, disability systems that nearly always pay much better retirement and disability benefits than Social Security. These plans typically requires vesting—working for 5–10 years for the same employer before becoming eligible for retirement. But their retirement typically only depends on the average of the best 3–10 years salaries times some retirement factor (typically 0.875%–3.0%) times years employed. This retirement benefit can be a "reasonably good" (75–85% of salary) retirement at close to the monthly salary they were last employed at. For example, if a person joined the University of California retirement system at age 25 and worked for 35 years they could receive 87.5% (2.5% × 35) of their average highest three year salary with full medical coverage at age 60. Police and firemen who joined at 25 and worked for 30 years could receive 90% (3.0% × 30) of their average salary and full medical coverage at age 55. These retirements have cost of living adjustments (COLA) applied each year but are limited to a maximum average income of $350,000/year or less. Spousal survivor benefits are available at 100–67% of the primary benefits rate for 8.7% to 6.7% reduction in retirement benefits, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;UCRP Retirement System Brochure [http://map.ais.ucla.edu/go/1002015] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105080604/http://map.ais.ucla.edu/go/1002015 |date=November 5, 2013 }} accessed November 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; UCRP retirement and disability plan benefits are funded by contributions from both members and the university (typically 5% of salary each) and by the compounded investment earnings of the accumulated totals. These contributions and earnings are held in a trust fund that is invested. The retirement benefits are much more generous than Social Security but are believed to be actuarially sound. The main difference between state and local government sponsored retirement systems and Social Security is that the state and local retirement systems use compounded investments that are usually heavily weighted in the stock market securities—which historically have returned more than 7.0%/year on average despite some years with losses.&lt;ref name="pages.stern.nyu.edu"&gt;Long term stock returns [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~%20adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html accessed 4 Nov 2013] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105074458/http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~%20adamodar/New_Home_Page/datafile/histretSP.html |date=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Short term federal government investments may be "more" secure but pay much lower average percentages. Nearly all other federal, state and local retirement systems work in a similar fashion with different benefit retirement ratios. Some plans are now combined with Social Security and are "piggy backed" on top of Social Security benefits. For example, the current [[Federal Employees Retirement System]], which covers the vast majority of federal civil service employees hired after 1986, combines Social Security, a modest defined-benefit pension (1.1% per year of service) and the defined-contribution [[Thrift Savings Plan]].

The current Social Security formula used in calculating the benefit level (primary insurance amount or PIA) is progressive vis-à-vis lower average salaries. Anyone who worked in OASDI covered employment and other retirement would be entitled to both the alternative non-OASDI pension and an Old Age retirement benefit from Social Security. Because of their limited time working in OASDI covered employment the sum of their covered salaries times inflation factor divided by 420 months yields a low adjusted indexed monthly salary over 35 years, AIME. The progressive nature of the PIA formula would in effect allow these workers to also get a slightly higher Social Security Benefit percentage on this low average salary. Congress passed in 1983 the Windfall Elimination Provision to minimize Social Security benefits for these recipients. The basic provision is that the first salary bracket, $0–791/month (2013) has its normal benefit percentage of 90% reduced to 40–90%—see Social Security for the exact percentage. The reduction is limited to roughly 50% of what you would be eligible for if you had always worked under OASDI taxes. The 90% benefit percentage factor is not reduced if you have 30 or more years of "substantial" earnings.&lt;ref&gt;Windfall Elimination Provision [http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10045.pdf#page=2] accessed October 14, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The average Social Security payment of $1,230/month ($14,760/year) in 2013&lt;ref&gt;Average Social security Payment [http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/13/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228100526/https://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/app/answers/detail/a_id/13 |date=February 28, 2013 }} accessed November 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; is only slightly above the federal poverty level for one—$11,420/yr and below the poverty guideline of $15,500/yr for two.&lt;ref&gt;2013 Federal Poverty Guidelines [http://www.familiesusa.org/resources/tools-for-advocates/guides/federal-poverty-guidelines.html] accessed November 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason, financial advisers often encourage those who have the option to do so to supplement their Social Security contributions with private retirement plans. One "good" supplemental retirement plan option is an employer-sponsored [[401(K)]] (or 403(B)) plan when they are offered by an employer. 58% of American workers have access to such plans.&lt;ref&gt;The Pew Charitable Trusts: A Look at Access to Employer-Based Retirement Plans and Participation in the States [http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/assets/2016/01/retirement_savings_report_jan16.pdf] accessed October 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these employers will match a portion of an employee's savings dollar-for-dollar up to a certain percentage of the employee's salary. Even without employer matches, [[individual retirement account]]s (IRAs) are portable, self-directed, tax-deferred retirement accounts that offer the potential to substantially increase retirement savings. Their limitations include: the financial literacy to tell a "good" investment account from a less advantageous one; the savings barrier faced by those who are in low-wage employment or burdened by debt; the requirement of self-discipline to allot from an early age the required percentage of salary into "good" investment account(s); and the self–discipline needed to leave it there to earn [[compound interest]] until needed after retirement. Financial advisers often suggest that long-term investment horizons should be used, as historically short-term investment losses "self correct", and most investments continue to deliver good average investment returns.&lt;ref name="pages.stern.nyu.edu" /&gt; The IRS has tax penalties for withdrawals from IRAs, 401(K)s, etc. before the age of 59½, and requires mandatory withdrawals once the retiree reaches 70; other restrictions may also apply on the amount of tax-deferred income one can put in the account(s).&lt;ref&gt;See: [https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590.pdf IRS Publication 590, "Individual Retirement Arrangements"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105205325/https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p590.pdf |date=January 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For people who have access to them, self-directed retirement savings plans have the potential to match or even exceed the benefits earned by federal, state and local government retirement plans.

===International agreements===
People sometimes relocate from one country to another, either permanently or on a limited-time basis. This presents challenges to businesses, governments, and individuals seeking to ensure future benefits or having to deal with taxation authorities in multiple countries. To that end, the Social Security Administration has signed treaties, often referred to as ''Totalization Agreements'', with other social insurance programs in various foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|ssrn= 822504|last=Christians|first=Allison|title= Social Security in United States Treaties and Executive Agreements|date= June 28, 2006|journal= Internationalen Steuerrecht|volume=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, these agreements serve two main purposes. First, they eliminate dual Social Security taxation, the situation that occurs when a worker from one country works in another country and is required to pay Social Security taxes to both countries on the same earnings. Second, the agreements help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the United States and another country.

The following countries have signed totalization agreements with the SSA (and the date the agreement became effective):&lt;ref name="www.ssa.gov/international"&gt;{{cite web| title=International Agreements | url=http://www.ssa.gov/international/status.html | accessdate=January 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social Security number===
{{Main|Social Security number}}
A side effect of the Social Security program in the United States has been the near-universal adoption of the program's identification number, the [[Social Security number (United States)|Social Security number]], as the ''de facto'' U.S. [[national identification number]]. The social security number, or SSN, is issued pursuant to section 205(c)(2) of the Social Security Act, codified as {{uscsub|42|405|c|2}}. The government originally stated that the SSN would not be a means of identification,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/26/weekinreview/the-nation-not-for-identification-purposes-just-kidding.html&lt;/ref&gt; but currently a multitude of U.S. entities use the Social Security number as a personal identifier. These include government agencies such as the [[Internal Revenue Service]], the military as well as private agencies such as banks, colleges and universities, health insurance companies, and employers.

Although the Social Security Act itself does not require a person to have a Social Security Number (SSN) to live and work in the United States,&lt;ref name="autogenerated5"&gt;http://home.hiwaay.net/~becraft/ScottSSNLetter.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Internal Revenue Code does generally require the use of the social security number by individuals for federal tax purposes:

::The social security account number issued to an individual for purposes of section 205(c)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act shall, except as shall otherwise be specified under regulations of the Secretary [of the Treasury or his delegate], be used as the identifying number for such individual for purposes of this title.&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|6109(d)}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Importantly, most parents apply for Social Security numbers for their dependent children in order to&lt;ref name="Tax Reform Act of 1986"&gt;keep{{cite web| url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/history/ssn/reagantax.html | title= Tax Reform Act of 1986 | accessdate=November 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; include them on their income tax returns as a dependent. Everyone filing a tax return, as taxpayer or spouse, must have a Social Security Number or [[Taxpayer Identification Number]] (TIN) since the IRS is unable to process returns or post payments for anyone without an SSN or TIN.

The [[Privacy Act of 1974]] was in part intended to limit usage of the Social Security number as a means of identification. Paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of section 7 of the Privacy Act, an uncodified provision, states in part:

::(1) It shall be unlawful for any Federal, State or local government agency to deny to any individual any right, benefit, or privilege provided by law because of such individual's refusal to disclose his social security account number.

However, the Social Security Act provides:

::It is the policy of the United States that any State (or political subdivision thereof) may, in the administration of any tax, general public assistance, driver's license, or motor vehicle registration law within its jurisdiction, utilize the social security account numbers issued by the Commissioner of Social Security for the purpose of establishing the identification of individuals affected by such law, and may require any individual who is or appears to be so affected to furnish to such State (or political subdivision thereof) or any agency thereof having administrative responsibility for the law involved, the social security account number (or numbers, if he has more than one such number) issued to him by the Commissioner of Social Security.&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Act section 205(c)(2)(C)(1), codified at subsection (c)(2)(C)(1) of {{usc|42|405}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further, paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of section 7 of the Privacy Act provides in part:

::(2) the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection ''shall not apply'' with respect to –

:::(A) any disclosure which is ''required by Federal statute'', or

:::(B) the disclosure of a social security number to any Federal, State, or local agency maintaining a system of records in existence and operating before January 1, 1975, if such disclosure was required under statute or regulation adopted prior to such date to verify the identity of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;Privacy Act of 1974, Pub. L. No. 93-579, 88 Stat. 1897 (December 31, 1974), sec. 7(a) (emphasis added).&lt;/ref&gt;

The exceptions under section 7 of the Privacy Act include the Internal Revenue Code requirement that social security numbers be used as taxpayer identification numbers for individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{uscsub|26|6109|d}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographic and revenue projections===
In each year since 1982, OASDI tax receipts, interest payments and other income have exceeded benefit payments and other expenditures, for example by more than $150 billion in 2004.&lt;ref name="www.ssa.gov.661"&gt;{{cite web| title=OASDI Trust Funds (See above) | url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/STATS/table4a3.html | accessdate=December 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the "[[post–World War II baby boom|baby boomers]]" move out of the work force and into retirement, however, expenses will come to exceed tax receipts and then, after several more years, will exceed all OASDI trust income, including interest. At that point the system will begin drawing on its trust fund Treasury Notes, and will continue to pay benefits at the current levels until the Trust Fund is exhausted. In 2013, the OASDI retirement insurance fund collected $731.1 billion and spent $645.5 billion; the disability program (DI) collected $109.1 billion and spent $140.3 billion; Medicare (HI) collected $243.0 and spent $266.8 billion and Supplementary Medical Insurance, SMI, collected $293.9 billion and spent $307.4 billion. In 2013 all Social Security programs except the retirement trust fund (OASDI) spent more than they brought in and relied on significant withdrawals from their respective trust funds to pay their bills. The retirement (OASDI) trust fund of $2,541 billion is expected to be emptied by 2033 by one estimate as new retirees become eligible to join. The disability (DI) trust fund's $153.9 billion will be exhausted by 2018; the Medicare (HI) trust fund of $244.2 billion will be exhausted by 2023 and the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund will be exhausted by 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continues—even sooner if they increase. The total "Social Security" expenditures in 2013 were $1,360 billion dollars, which was 8.4% of the $16,200 billion GNP (2013) and 37.0% of the federal expenditures of $3,684 billion (including a $971.0 billion deficit).&lt;ref name="whitehouse.gov" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;2013 Status Of The Social Security And Medicare Programs [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/] accessed October 16, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; All other parts of the Social Security program: medicare (HI), disability (DI) and Supplemental Medical (SMI) trust funds are already drawing down their trust funds and are projected to go into deficit in about 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continue.&lt;ref&gt;Status Of The Social Security And Medicare Programs [http://www.ssa.gov/oact/trsum/] accessed October 26, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; As the trust funds are exhausted either benefits will have to be cut, fraud minimized or taxes increased. According to the [[Center for Economic and Policy Research]], [[Income inequality in the United States|upward redistribution of income]] is responsible for about 43% of the projected Social Security shortfall over the next 75 years.&lt;ref name="ceprshortfall"&gt;[http://www.cepr.net/index.php/blogs/cepr-blog/the-impact-of-the-upward-redistribution-of-wage-income-on-social-security-solvency "The Impact of the Upward Redistribution of Wage Income on Social Security Solvency"] ''Center for Economic and Policy Research'', February 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, this exhaustion of the OASDI Trust Fund was projected to occur in 2041 by the Social Security Administration&lt;ref name="www.ssa.gov.662"&gt;{{cite web| title= Social Security Administration | url=http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TRSUM/trsummary.html | accessdate=December 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by 2052 by the Congressional Budget Office, CBO.&lt;ref name="www.cbo.gov.663"&gt;{{cite web| title= Congressional Budget Office | url=http://www.cbo.gov/showdoc.cfm?index=5666&amp;sequence=0 | accessdate=December 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, however, the projection for the exhaustion date of this event was moved up slightly after the recession worsened the U.S. economy's financial picture. The 2011 OASDI Trustees Report stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Annual cost exceeded non-interest income in 2010 and is projected to continue to be larger throughout the remainder of the 75-year valuation period. Nevertheless, from 2010 through 2022, total trust fund income, including interest income, is more than is necessary to cover costs, so trust fund assets will continue to grow during that time period. Beginning in 2023, trust fund assets will diminish until they become exhausted in 2036. Non-interest income is projected to be sufficient to support expenditures at a level of 77 percent of scheduled benefits after trust fund exhaustion in 2036, and then to decline to 74 percent of scheduled benefits in 2085.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = 2011 OASDI Trustees Report| publisher = [[Social Security Administration]]| url = http://www.ssa.gov/oact/tr/2011/II_D_project.html| accessdate = July 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, the Social Security Trustees suggested that either the payroll tax could increase to 16.41 percent in 2041 and steadily increased to 17.60 percent in 2081 or a cut in benefits by 25 percent in 2041 and steadily increased to an overall cut of 30 percent in 2081.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/TR/TR07/II_conclu.html |title=2007 OASDI Trustees Report Conclusions |publisher= [[Social Security Administration]] |date= April 23, 2007 |accessdate= May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Social Security Administration projects that the demographic situation will stabilize. The cash flow deficit in the Social Security system will have leveled off as a share of the economy. This projection has come into question. Some demographers argue that life expectancy will improve more than projected by the Social Security Trustees, a development that would make solvency worse. Some economists believe future productivity growth will be higher than the current projections by the Social Security Trustees. In this case, the Social Security shortfall would be smaller than currently projected.

Tables published by the government's National Center for Health Statistics show that life expectancy at birth was 47.3 years in 1900, rose to 68.2 by 1950 and reached 77.3 in 2002. The latest annual report of the Social Security Agency (SSA) trustees projects that life expectancy will increase just six years in the next seven decades, to 83 in 2075. A separate set of projections, by the [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]], shows more rapid growth.&lt;ref name="www.heraldtribune.com.665"&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Security Underestimates Future Life Spans, Critics Say |url=http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041231/ZNYT02/412310311 |accessdate=December 3, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126182127/http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20041231%2FZNYT02%2F412310311 |archivedate=November 26, 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Census Bureau projection is that the longer life spans projected for 2075 by the Social Security Administration will be reached in 2050. Other experts, however, think that the past gains in life expectancy cannot be repeated, and add that the adverse effect on the system's finances may be partly offset if health improvements or reduced retirement benefits induce people to stay in the workforce longer.

Actuarial science, of the kind used to project the future solvency of social security, is by nature subject to uncertainty. The SSA actually makes three predictions: optimistic, midline, and pessimistic (until the late 1980s it made 4 projections). The Social Security crisis that was developing prior to the 1983 reforms resulted from midline projections that turned out to be too optimistic. It has been argued that the overly pessimistic projections of the mid to late 1990s were partly the result of the low economic growth (according to actuary David Langer) assumptions that resulted in pushing back the projected exhaustion date (from 2028 to 2042) with each successive Trustee's report.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} During the heavy-boom years of the 1990s, the midline projections were too pessimistic. Obviously, projecting out 75 years is a significant challenge and, as such, the actual situation might be much better or much worse than predicted.

The Social Security Advisory Board has on three occasions since 1999 appointed a Technical Advisory Panel to review the methods and assumptions used in the annual projections for the Social Security trust funds. The most recent report of the Technical Advisory Panel, released in June 2008 with a copyright date of October 2007, includes a number of recommendations for improving the Social Security projections.&lt;ref&gt;Technical Panel on Assumptions and Methods (2007), [http://www.ssab.gov/documents/2007_Technical_Panel_Report.PDF "Report to the Social Security Advisory Board,"] October 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028202021/http://www.ssab.gov/documents/2007_Technical_Panel_Report.PDF |date=October 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Advisory Board, [http://www.ssab.gov/documents/SSAB_TPAM_Announcement_60508.pdf "Press Release: The Report of the 2007 Technical Panel on Assumptions and Methods,"] June 5, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080625032551/http://www.ssab.gov/documents/SSAB_TPAM_Announcement_60508.pdf |date=June 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increased spending for Social Security will occur at the same time as increases in [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], as a result of the aging of the baby boomers. One projection illustrates the relationship between the two programs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From 2004 to 2030, the combined spending on Social Security and Medicare is expected to rise from 8% of national income (gross domestic product) to 13%. Two-thirds of the increase occurs in Medicare.&lt;ref name="www.washingtonpost.com.666"&gt;{{Cite news| title=It's More Than Social Security| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A8100-2005Jan13.html | accessdate=December 3, 2005 | work= [[The Washington Post]] | author = Samuelson, Robert J. | date=January 14, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* '''Average in more working years'''. Social Security benefits are now based on an average of a worker's 35 highest paid salaries with zeros averaged in if there are fewer than 35 years of covered wages.

* '''Require all newly hired people to join Social Security'''. Over 90% of all workers already pay FICA and SECA taxes, so there is not much to gain by this.

==Taxation==

===Tax on wages and self-employment income===
Benefits are funded by taxes imposed on wages of employees and self-employed persons. As explained below, in the case of employment, the employer and employee are each responsible for one half of the Social Security tax, with the employee's half being withheld from the employee's pay check. In the case of self-employed persons (i.e., independent contractors), the self-employed person is responsible for the entire amount of Social Security tax.

The portion of taxes collected from the employee for Social Security are referred to as "trust fund taxes" and the employer is required to remit them to the government. These taxes take priority over everything, and represent the only debts of a corporation or LLC that can impose personal liability upon its officers or managers. A sole proprietor and officers of a corporation and managers of an LLC can be held personally liable for non-payment of the income tax and social security taxes whether or not actually collected from the employee.&lt;ref&gt;IRC § 6672 provides 'Any person required to collect, truthfully account for, and pay over any tax imposed by this title who willfully fails to collect such tax, or truthfully account for and pay over such tax, or willfully attempts in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax or the payment thereof, shall in addition to other penalties provided by law, be liable to a penalty equal to the total amount of the tax evaded, or not collected, or not accounted for and paid over.'&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|Federal Insurance Contributions Act]]'' (FICA) (codified in the [[Internal Revenue Code]]) imposes a Social Security withholding tax equal to 6.20% of the gross wage amount, up to but not exceeding the ''[[SSWB|Social Security Wage Base]]'' ($97,500 for 2007; $102,000 for 2008; and $106,800 for 2009, 2010, and 2011). The same 6.20% tax is imposed on employers. For 2011 and 2012, the employee's contribution was reduced to 4.2%, while the employer's portion remained at 6.2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p15.pdf |title=2011 Publication 15 |format=PDF |accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irs.gov/uac/Payroll-Tax-Cut-Extended-to-the-End-of-2012;-Revised-Payroll-Tax-Form-Now-Available-to-Employers |title=Payroll Tax Cut Extended to the End of 2012; Revised Payroll Tax Form Now Available to Employers |date=February 13, 2012 |accessdate=December 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, the wage base increased to $110,100.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9"&gt;{{cite web |title=Contribution and Benefit Base |publisher=Ssa.gov|url= http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/cbb.html |accessdate=December 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the wage base increased to $113,700.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialsecurity.gov/pressoffice/factsheets/colafacts2013.htm&lt;/ref&gt; For each calendar year for which the worker is assessed the FICA contribution, the SSA credits those wages as that year's covered wages. The income cutoff is adjusted yearly for inflation and other factors.

A separate payroll tax of 1.45% of an employee's income is paid directly by the employer, and an additional 1.45% deducted from the employee's paycheck, yielding a total tax rate of 2.90%. There is no maximum limit on this portion of the tax. This portion of the tax is used to fund the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program, which is primarily responsible for providing health benefits to retirees.

The Social Security tax rates from 1937–2010 can be accessed on the [[Social Security Administration]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/statcomps/supplement/2010/2a1-2a7.html#table2.a3 |title=Annual Statistical Supplement, 2010 – History of OASDI Coverage, Financing, and Insured Status (2.A1-2.A7) |publisher=Ssa.gov |accessdate=July 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; website.

The combined tax rate of these two federal programs is 15.30% (7.65% paid by the employee and 7.65% paid by the employer). In 2011–2012 it temporarily dropped to 13.30% (5.65% paid by the employee and 7.65% paid by the employer).

For [[Self-employment|self-employed workers]] (who technically are not employees and are deemed not to be earning "wages" for federal tax purposes), the self-employment tax, imposed by the Self-Employment Contributions Act of 1954, codified as Chapter 2 of Subtitle A of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], {{usc|26|1401|1403}}, is 15.3% of "net earnings from self-employment."&lt;ref&gt;See {{usc|26|1402}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, a self-employed individual pays both the employee and employer share of the tax, although half of the self-employment tax (the "employer share") is deductible when calculating the individual's federal income tax.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120715231032/http://ssa-custhelp.ssa.gov/cgi-bin/ssa.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=172 "I Am Self-Employed.

Retrieved April 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

If an employee has overpaid payroll taxes by having more than one job or switching jobs during the year, the excess taxes will be refunded when the employee files his [[Income tax in the United States|federal income tax return]]. Any excess taxes paid by employers, however, are not refundable to the employers.

====Wages not subject to tax====
Workers are not required to pay Social Security taxes on wages from certain types of work:&lt;ref&gt;IRS Publications 15, 15-A&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wages received by certain state or local government workers participating in their employers' alternative retirement system.
* Net annual earnings from self-employment of less than $400.
* Wages received for service as an election worker, if less than $1,400 a year (in 2008).
* Wages received for working as a household employee, if less than $1,700 per year (in 2009–2010).
* Wages received by college students working under Federal Work Study programs, graduate students receiving stipends while working as [[teaching assistant]]s, [[research assistant]]s, or on [[scholarship|fellowships]], and most [[postdoctoral researcher]]s. Eliminated starting January 2011.
* Earnings received for serving as a minister (or for similar religious service) if the person has a [[conscientious objector|conscientious objection]] to public insurance because of personal religious considerations.

===Federal income taxation of benefits===
Originally the benefits received by retirees were not taxed as income. Beginning in [[Fiscal year|tax year]] 1984, with the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-era reforms to repair the system's projected insolvency, retirees with incomes over $25,000 (in the case of married persons filing separately who did not live with the spouse at any time during the year, and for persons filing as "single"), or with combined incomes over $32,000 (if married filing jointly) or, in certain cases, any income amount (if married filing separately from the spouse in a year in which the taxpayer lived with the spouse at any time) generally saw part of the retiree benefits subject to federal income tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ssa.gov/history/1983amend2.html |title=SOCIAL SECURITY AMENDMENTS OF 1983 H.R. 1900/P.L. 98-21 |publisher=Ssa.gov |accessdate=April 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, the portion of the benefits potentially subject to tax was 50%.&lt;ref&gt;Page 11, Instructions for 1984 Form 1040, U.S. Individual Income Tax Return, Internal Revenue Service, U.S. Dep't of the Treasury.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993|Deficit Reduction Act of 1993]] set the portion to 85%.

=={{anchor|Criticism}}Criticisms==

===Claim of discrimination against the poor and the middle class===
Workers must pay 12.4 percent, including a 6.2 percent employer contribution, on their wages below the [[Social Security Wage Base]] ($110,100 in 2012), but no tax on income in excess of this amount.&lt;ref name="autogenerated9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysscpa.org/cpajournal/2005/405/perspectives/p17.htm |title=Perspectives |publisher= [[New York State Society of Certified Public Accountants]] |accessdate= May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income because of the income caps; because of this, and the fact there is no tax on unearned income, social security taxes are often viewed as being [[regressive tax|regressive]]. However, benefits are adjusted to be significantly more progressive, even when accounting for differences in life expectancy. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, for people in the bottom fifth of the earnings distribution, the ratio of benefits to taxes is almost three times as high as it is for those in the top fifth.&lt;ref name="CBO Social Security"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/18266|title=Is Social Security Progressive?|publisher=The US Congressional Budget Office (CBO)|date=December 15, 2006 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its regressive tax rate, Social Security benefits are calculated using a progressive benefit formula that replaces a much higher percentage of low-income workers' pre-retirement income than that of higher-income workers (although these low-income workers pay a higher percentage of their pre-retirement income).&lt;ref&gt;Social Security's benefit formula provides 90% of average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) below the first "bend point", 32% of AIME between the first and second bend points, and 15% of AIME in excess of the second bend point. [http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/piaformula.html Primary Insurance Amount], Social Security Administration.&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the current system also point to numerous studies that show that, relative to high-income workers, Social Security disability and survivor benefits paid on behalf of low-income workers more than offset any retirement benefits that may be lost because of shorter life expectancy (this offset would only apply at a population level).&lt;ref&gt;Cynthia M.

Social Security's benefit formula provides 90% of average indexed monthly earnings (AIME) below the first "bend point" of $791/month, 32% of AIME between the first and second bend points $791 to $4781/month, and 15% of AIME in excess of the second bend point up to the Ceiling cap of $113,700 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Benefit-PIA Calculation [http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/COLA/piaformula.html] accessed April 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The low income bias of the benefit calculation means that lower paid worker receives a much higher percentage of his or her salary in benefit payments than higher paid workers. Indeed, a married low salaried worker can receive over 100% of their salary in benefits after retiring at the full retirement age. High-salaried workers receive 43% or less of their salary in benefits despite having paid into the "system" at the same rate—(see benefit calculations above.) To minimize the impact of Social Security taxes on low salaried workers the Earned Income Tax Credit" and the Child Care Tax Credit were passed, which largely refund the FICA and or SECA payments of low-salaried workers through the income tax system.&lt;ref name="cbo.gov" /&gt; By Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculations the lowest income quintile (0–20%) and second quintile (21–40%) of households in the U.S. pay an average federal income tax of −9.3% and −2.6% of income and Social Security taxes of 8.3% and 7.9% of income respectively. By CBO calculations the household incomes in the first quintile and second quintile have an average total federal tax rate of 1.0% and 3.8% respectively.&lt;ref name="cbo.gov" /&gt; However, these groups also have by far the smallest percentage of American household incomes – the first quintile earns just 3.2% of all income, while the second quintile earns only 8.4% of all income.&lt;ref name="CRSIncome"&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R42400.pdf The U.S. Income Distribution and Mobility: Trends and International Comparisons], [[Congressional Research Service]]&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-income retirees will have to pay income taxes on 85% of their Social Security benefits and 100% on all other retirement benefits they may have.&lt;ref name="ssa.gov" /&gt;

===Marital status===
The Social Security Act defines the rules for determining marital relationships for SSI recipients. The act requires that if a man and a woman are found to be "holding out"—that is, presenting themselves to the community as husband and wife—they should be considered married for purposes of the SSI program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111022170832/https://secure.ssa.gov/poms.nsf/lnx/0500501152 (POMS SI 00501.152)]&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, if the claimant is found disabled and found to be "holding out"; this claimant will be entitled of reduced or no SSI benefits.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111022170544/https://secure.ssa.gov/apps10/poms.nsf/lnx/0500501150 (POMS SI 02005.030)]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Social Security Act does not accept that a claimant "holding out as husband or wife" should be entitled of Survivor, Retirement or Widows benefits, when the claimant's "husband or wife" dies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfia.state.mi.us/SI-Screens/nes_SG/WebHelp/RSDI_vs_SSI.htm  RSDI vs SSI]&lt;/ref&gt; SSA rules and regulations about marital status either prohibit (SRDI program) or reduce (SSI program) benefits to indigent claimants.

===Claim that politicians exempted themselves from the tax===
Critics of Social Security have said that the politicians who created Social Security exempted themselves from having to pay the Social Security tax.&lt;ref name="autogenerated8"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/04/20050415-4.html |title=Fact Sheet: Millions Enjoy Ownership and Control Outside Social Security |publisher= [[White House]] |accessdate= May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the federal government created Social Security, all federal employees, including the president and members of Congress, were exempt from having to pay the Social Security tax, and they received no Social Security benefits. This law was changed by the Social Security Amendments of 1983, which brought within the Social Security system all members of Congress, the president and the vice president, federal judges, and certain executive-level political appointees, as well as all federal employees hired in any capacity on or after January 1, 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = SSA's Office of Legislation &amp; Congressional Affairs| title = Summary of P.L. 98-21, (H.R. 1900) Social Security Amendments of 1983 – Signed on April 20, 1983| publisher = [[Social Security Administration]]| date = November 26, 1984| url = http://www.ssa.gov/history/1983amend.html| accessdate = May 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many state and local government workers, however, are exempt from Social Security taxes because they contribute instead to alternative retirement systems set up by their employers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssa.gov/retire2/stateandlocal.htm "Social Security Administration Retirement Planner: State and Local Government Employment"]. [[Social Security Administration]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claim that the government lied about the maximum tax===
George Mason University economics professor [[Walter E. Williams]] claimed that the federal government has broken its own promise regarding the maximum Social Security tax.&lt;ref name="autogenerated3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/williams022305.asp |title=Williams | work = [[Jewish World Review]] |accessdate= May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams used data from the federal government to back up his claim.

According to a 1936 pamphlet on the Social Security website, the federal government promised the following maximum level of taxation for Social Security, "... beginning in 1949, twelve years from now, you and your employer will each pay 3 cents on each dollar you earn, up to $3,000 a year.

However, according to the Social Security website, by the year 2008, the tax rate was 6.2% each for the employer and employee, and the maximum income level that was subject to the tax was $102,000 raising the bar to $6,324 maximum contribution by both employee and employer (total $12,648).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/pubs/10003.html |title=Update 2010|publisher= [[Social Security Administration]] |date= November 3, 2008 |accessdate= May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Dr. Williams wrote, "Had Congress lived up to those promises, where $3,000 was the maximum earnings subject to Social Security tax, controlling for inflation, today's $50,000-a-year wage earner would pay about $700 in Social Security taxes, as opposed to the more than $3,000 that he pays today."&lt;ref name="autogenerated3" /&gt;

According to the Social Security website, "The tax rate in the original 1935 law was 1% each on the employer and the employee, on the first $3,000 of earnings. This rate was increased on a regular schedule in four steps so that by 1949 the rate would be 3% each on the first $3,000. The figure was never $1,400, and the rate was never fixed for all time at 1%."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/history/InternetMyths.html |title=Myths and Misinformation about Social Security |publisher= [[Social Security Administration]] |accessdate= May 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Claim that it gives a low rate of return===
Critics of Social Security&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://www.ncpa.org/~ncpa/ba/ba215.html NCPA.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213204531/http://www.ncpa.org/~ncpa/ba/ba215.html |date=February 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that it gives a low rate of return, compared to what is obtained through private retirement accounts. For example, critics point out&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; that under the Social Security laws as they existed at that time, several thousand employees of Galveston County, Texas were allowed to opt out of the Social Security program in the early 1980s, and have their money placed in a private retirement plan instead. While employees who earned $50,000 per year would have collected $1,302 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $6,843 per month. While employees who earned $20,000 per year would have collected $775 per month in Social Security benefits, the private plan paid them $2,740 per month, at interest rates prevailing in 1996.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2" /&gt; While some advocates of privatization of Social Security point to the Galveston pension plan as a model for Social Security reform, critics point to a GAO report&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/archive/1999/he99031.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to the House Ways and Means Committee, which indicates that, for low and middle income employees, particularly those with shorter work histories, the outcome may be less favorable.

This claim also discounts the fact that investment in private markets is not risk-free and private investments can and often do lose value. A person whose investments fail for whatever reason may lose everything they invest and enter their retirement years penniless. Therefore, advocates argue, Social Security plays an important role by providing every American worker a guaranteed minimum level of retirement income that cannot be lost to market fluctuations, disappear through business failures or be stolen by fraudulent investment schemes.&lt;ref name="CSM"&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1227/p01s03-cogn.html One man's retirement math: Social Security wins], David R.

===Claim that it is a Ponzi scheme===

Critics have drawn parallels between Social Security and [[Ponzi scheme]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Indiviglio [https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2011/08/perry-is-right-social-security-is-a-lot-like-a-ponzi-scheme/243633/ Perry Is Right: Social Security Is a Lot Like a Ponzi Scheme] ''[[The Atlantic]]'', August 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://peoplespension.infoshop.org/blogs-mu/2010/03/12/ponzi-scheme/ | author = Laursen, E. |title= Is Social Security Really a Ponzi Scheme |quote= The Ponzi epithet for Social Security originated in a 1967 [[Newsweek]] column by Paul Samuelson: [...]'' A growing nation is the greatest Ponzi scheme ever contrived.

{{quote |text= ...the vast majority of the money you pay in Social Security taxes is not invested in anything. Instead, the money you pay into the system is used to pay benefits to those "early investors" who are retired today. When you retire, you will have to rely on the next generation of workers behind you to pay the taxes that will finance your benefits.

As with Ponzi's scheme, this turns out to be a very good deal for those who got in early. The very first Social Security recipient, Ida Mae Fuller of Vermont, paid just $44 in Social Security taxes, but the long-lived Mrs. Fuller collected $20,993 in benefits. Such high returns were possible because there were many workers paying into the system and only a few retirees taking benefits out of it. In 1950, for instance, there were 16 workers supporting every retiree. Today, there are just over three. By around 2030, we will be down to just two.
As with Ponzi's scheme, when the number of new contributors dries up, it will become impossible to continue to pay the promised benefits. Those early windfall returns are long gone. When today's young workers retire, they will receive returns far below what private investments could provide. Many will be lucky to break even.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= National Review |date= 31 August 2011 |title= Yes, It Is a Ponzi Scheme |url= http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/275908/yes-it-ponzi-scheme-michael-tanner |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011082648/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/275908/yes-it-ponzi-scheme-michael-tanner |archivedate=October 11, 2011 |accessdate=June 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; |sign= Michael Tanner}}

One criticism of the analogy is that while [[Ponzi scheme]]s and Social Security have similar ''structures'' (in particular, a sustainability problem when the number of new people paying in is declining), they have different ''transparencies''. In the case of a Ponzi scheme, the fact that there is no return-generating mechanism other than contributions from new entrants is obscured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Social Security a Ponzi Scheme?

In connection with these and other issues, [[Robert E. Wright]] calls Social Security a "quasi" [[pyramid scheme]] in his book, ''Fubarnomics''.

===Estimated net benefits under differing circumstances===
[[File:Fig. 168 - Single men with different wages and retirement dates.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|Single men with different wages and retirement dates]]
In 2004, Urban Institute economists [[C. Eugene Steuerle]] and Adam Carasso created a Web-based Social Security benefits calculator.&lt;ref&gt;C. Eugene Steuerle and Adam Carasso, "The USA Today Lifetime Social Security and Medicare Benefits Calculator," (Urban Institute, October 1, 2004), from: [http://www.urban.org/publications/900746.html Urban.org] &lt;s&gt;NOTE:&lt;/s&gt; The calculator does not include the value or cost of the Social Security disability program.&lt;/ref&gt; Using this calculator it is possible to estimate net Social Security benefits (i.e., estimated lifetime benefits minus estimated lifetime FICA taxes paid) for different types of recipients. In the book ''Democrats and Republicans – Rhetoric and Reality'' Joseph Fried used the calculator to create graphical depictions of the estimated net benefits of men and women who were at different wage levels, single and married (with stay-at-home spouses), and retiring in different years. These graphs vividly show that generalizations about Social Security benefits may be of little predictive value for any given worker, due to the wide disparity of net benefits for people at different income levels and in different demographic groups. For example, the graph below (Figure 168) shows the impact of wage level and retirement date on a male worker. As income goes up, net benefits get smaller – even negative.
[[File:Fig. 165 - Impact of gender and wage levels on net SS benefits.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|Impact of gender and wage levels on net SS benefits]]However, the impact is much greater for the future retiree (in 2045) than for the current retiree (2005). The male earning $95,000 per year and retiring in 2045 is estimated to lose over $200,000 by participating in the Social Security system.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Joseph, ''Democrats and Republicans – Rhetoric and Reality'' (New York: Algora Publishing, 2008), 212.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the next graph (Figure 165) the depicted net benefits are averaged for people turning age 65 anytime during the years 2005 through 2045. (In other words, the disparities shown are not related to retirement.) However, we do see the impact of gender and wage level. Because women tend to live longer, they generally collect Social Security benefits for a longer time. As a result, they get a higher net benefit, on average, no matter what the wage level.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Joseph, ''Democrats and Republicans – Rhetoric and Reality'' (New York: Algora Publishing, 2008), 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fig. 166 - Net lifetime SS benefits of married men and women where only one person works.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|Net lifetime SS benefits of married men and women where only one person works]]The next image (Figure 166) shows estimated net benefits for married men and women at different wage levels. In this particular scenario it is assumed that the spouse has little or no earnings and, thus, will be entitled to collect a spousal retirement benefit. According to Fried:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Two significant factors are evident: First, every column in Figure 166 depicts a net benefit that is higher than any column in Figure 165. In other words, the average married person (with a stay-at-home spouse) gets a greater benefit per FICA tax dollar paid than does the average single person – no matter what the gender or wage level. Second, there is only limited progressivity among married workers with stay-at-home spouses. Review Figure 166 carefully: The net benefits drop as the wage levels increase from $50,000 to $95,000; however, they increase as the wage levels grow from $5,000 to $50,000. In fact, net benefits are lowest for those earning just $5,000 per year.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Joseph, ''Democrats and Republicans – Rhetoric and Reality'' (New York: Algora Publishing, 2008), 206.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The last graph shown (Figure 167) is a combination of Figures 165 and 166. In this graph it is very clear why generalizations about the value of Social Security benefits are meaningless. At the $95,000 wage level a married person could be a big winner – getting net benefits of about $165,000. On the other hand, he could lose an estimated $152,000 in net benefits if he remains single. Altogether, there is a "swing" of over $300,000 based upon the marriage decision (and the division of earnings between the spouses). In addition there is a large disparity between the high net benefits of the married person earning $95,000 ($165,152) versus the relatively low net benefits of the man or woman earning just $5,000 ($30,025 or $41,890, depending on gender). In other words, the high earner, in this scenario, gets a far greater return on his FICA tax investment than does the low earner.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Joseph, ''Democrats and Republicans – Rhetoric and Reality'' (New York: Algora Publishing, 2008), 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fig. 167 - Comparison of net SS benefits.JPG|thumb|upright=1.8|Comparison of net SS benefits]]

In the book ''How Social Security Picks Your Pocket'' other factors affecting Social Security net benefits are identified: Generally, people who work for more than 35 years get a lower net benefit – all other factors being equal. People who do not live long after retirement age get a much lower net benefit. Finally, people who derive a high percentage of income from non-wage sources get high Social Security net benefits because they appear to be poor, when they are not. The progressive benefit formula for Social Security is blind to the income a worker may have from non-wage sources, such as spousal support, dividends and interest, or rental income.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Joseph, ''How Social Security Picks Your Pocket'' (New York: Algora Publishing, 2003), 27–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current controversies==
{{Main|Social Security debate (United States)}}

Proposals to reform of the Social Security system have led to heated debate, centering on funding of the program. In particular, proposals to ''privatize'' funding have caused great controversy.

===Contrast with private pensions===
Although Social Security is sometimes compared to private [[pensions]], the two systems are different in a number of respects. It has been argued that Social Security is an insurance plan as opposed to a retirement plan. Unlike a pension, for example, Social Security pays disability benefits. A private pension fund accumulates the money paid into it, eventually using those reserves to pay pensions to the workers who contributed to the fund; and a private system is not universal. Social Security cannot "prefund" by investing in marketable assets such as equities, because federal law prohibits it from investing in assets other than those backed by the U.S. government. As a result, its investments to date have been limited to special non-negotiable securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, although some{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} argue that debt issued by the [[Federal National Mortgage Association]] and other quasi-governmental organizations could meet legal standards. Social Security cannot by law invest in private equities, although some other countries (such as Canada) and some states permit their pension funds to invest in private equities. As a universal system, Social Security generally operates as a pipeline, through which current tax receipts from workers are used to pay current benefits to retirees, survivors, and the disabled. When there is an excess of taxes withheld over benefits paid, by law this excess is invested in Treasury securities (not in private equities) as described above.

Two broad categories of private pension plans are "defined benefit pension plans" and "defined contribution pension plans." Of these two, Social Security is more similar to a defined benefit pension plan. In a defined benefit pension plan, the benefits ultimately received are based on some sort of pre-determined formula (such as one based on years worked and highest salary earned). Defined benefit pension plans generally do not include separate accounts for each participant. By contrast, in a defined contribution pension plan each participant has a specific account with funds put into that account (by the employer or the participant, or both), and the ultimate benefit is based on the amount in that account at the time of retirement. Some have proposed that the Social Security system be modified to provide for the option of individual accounts (in effect, to make the system, at least in part, more like a defined contribution pension plan). Specifically, on February 2, 2005, [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] made Social Security a prominent theme of his [[State of the Union Address]].&lt;ref name=Bush-20050202&gt;{{cite web|author=Bush, George W.|title=State of the Union Address|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/02/20050202-11.html|date=February 2, 2005|publisher=[[White House Office of the Press Secretary]]|accessdate= July 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He described the Social Security system as "headed for bankruptcy", and outlined, in general terms, a proposal based on partial [[privatization]]. Critics responded that privatization would require huge new government borrowing to fund benefit payments during the transition years. See [[Social Security debate (United States)]].

Both "defined benefit" and "defined contribution" private pension plans are governed by the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act]] (ERISA), which requires employers to provide minimum levels of funding to support "defined benefits" pensions. The purpose is to protect the workers from corporate mismanagement and outright [[bankruptcy]], although in practice many private pension funds have fallen short in recent years. In terms of financial structure, the current Social Security system is analogous to an underfunded "defined benefit" pension ("underfunded" meaning not that it is in trouble, but that its savings are not enough to pay future benefits without collecting future tax revenues).

===Contrast with insurance===
Besides the argument over whether the returns on Social Security contributions should or can be compared to returns on private investment instruments, there is the question of whether the contributions are nonetheless analogous to pooled insurance premiums charged by for-profit commercial insurance companies to maintain and generate a return on a "risk pool of funds".&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Chait]], [http://www.tnr.com/article/blocking-move Blocking Move] ''[[The New Republic]]''  March 21, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Like any insurance program, Social Security "spreads risk" as the program protects workers and covered family members against loss of income from the wage earner's retirement, disability, or death. For example, a worker who becomes disabled at a young age could receive a large return relative to the amount they contributed in FICA before becoming disabled, since disability benefits can continue for life. As in private insurance plans, everyone in the particular insurance pool is insured against the same risks, but not everyone will benefit to the same extent.

The analogy to insurance, however, is limited&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Wilkinson]], [http://www.thefreemanonline.org/featured/social-security-and-the-insurance-illusion/ Social Security and the Insurance Illusion] ''[[Foundation for Economic Education]]'' 55:7 September 2005&lt;br /&gt;''See also:'' [[Theda Skocpol]], Social Policy in the United States: Future Possibilities in Historical Perspective, ([[Princeton University Press]]: 1995) p. 162: "The ideology that Altmeyer and other Social Security administrators fashioned for the old-age security system was individualistic and based on a (technically quite false) analogy to private savings or insurance."&lt;/ref&gt; by the fact that paying FICA taxes creates no legal right to benefits&lt;ref&gt;See ''Flemming v. Nestor'', 363 U.S. 603, 608–11, 4 L.Ed. 2d 1435, 80 S.Ct. 1367 (1960), ruling that the "right to Social Security benefits cannot properly be considered" to be a "property right", ''id.'' at 608.&lt;/ref&gt; and by the extent to which Social Security is, in fact, funded by FICA taxes. During 2011 and 2012, for example, FICA tax revenue was insufficient to maintain Social Security's solvency without transfers from general revenues. These transfers added to the general budget deficit like general program spending.&lt;ref&gt;Dean Baker [http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/132919-social-security-tax-cut-a-deal-breaker Social Security tax cut: A deal breaker] ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' December 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jennifer Steinhauer [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/26/us/politics/26dems.html For Some in G.O.P., a Tax Cut Not Worth Embracing] ''[[The New York Times]]'' August 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lori Montgomery, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/the-debt-fallout-how-social-security-went-cash-negative-earlier-than-expected/2011/10/27/gIQACm1QTM_story.html The debt fallout: How Social Security went 'cash negative' earlier than expected] ''[[Washington Post]]'' October 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Court interpretation of the Act to provide benefits===
The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit has indicated that the Social Security Act has a moral purpose and should be liberally interpreted in favor of claimants when deciding what counted as covered wages for purposes of meeting the quarters of coverage requirement to make a worker eligible for benefits.&lt;ref&gt;''Conklin v. Celebrezze'', 319 F.2d 569 (7th Cir. 1963).&lt;/ref&gt; That court has also stated: ". . . [T]he regulations should be liberally applied in favor of beneficiaries" when deciding a case in favor of a felon who had his disability payments retroactively terminated upon incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;''Dugan v. Sullivan'', 957 F.2d 1384, 1389 (7th Cir. 1992) ''quoting Wyatt v. Barnhart'', 349 F.3d 983, 986 (7th Cir. 2003).&lt;/ref&gt; According to the court, that the Social Security Act "should be liberally construed in favor of those seeking its benefits can not be doubted."&lt;ref&gt;''Carroll v. Social Sec. Bd.'', 128 F.2d 876 (7th Cir. 1942), ''citing'' ''Helvering v. Davis'', 301 U.S. 619, 640–645, 57 S.Ct. 904 (1937) (hereinafter ''Davis'').&lt;/ref&gt; "The hope behind this statute is to save men and women from the rigors of the poor house as well as from the haunting fear that such a lot awaits them when journey's end is near."&lt;ref&gt;''Davis'', at 641.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitutionality===
The constitutionality of Social Security is intricately linked to the evolving nature of Supreme Court jurisprudence on federal power (the 20th century saw a dramatic increase in allowed congressional action). When Social Security was first passed, there were significant questions over its constitutionality as the Court had found another pension scheme, the original Railroad Retirement Act, to violate the due process clause of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. Some, such as [[University of Chicago]] law professor [[Richard Allen Epstein|Richard Epstein]] and [[Harvard University]] professor [[Robert Nozick]], have argued that Social Security should be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Weissman |first1=Paul A. |title=Let It Be |url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/98/11/01/reviews/981101.01weissmt.html?mcubz=0 |accessdate=16 June 2018 |publisher=New York Times |date=November 1, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Feser |first1=Edward |title=Robert Nozick |url=https://www.iep.utm.edu/nozick/ |website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy: A Peer-Reviewed Academic Resource |publisher=University of Tennessee Martin |accessdate=16 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

In the 1937 U.S. Supreme Court case of ''[[Helvering v. Davis]]'',&lt;ref&gt;301 U.S. 619 (1937).&lt;/ref&gt; the Court examined the constitutionality of Social Security when George Davis of the Edison Electric Illuminating Company of Boston sued in connection with the Social Security tax. The U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts first upheld the tax. The District Court judgment was reversed by the Circuit Court of Appeals. Commissioner Guy Helvering of the Bureau of Internal Revenue (now the Internal Revenue Service) took the case to the Supreme Court, and the Court upheld the validity of the tax.

During the 1930s President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] was in the midst of promoting the passage of a large number of social welfare programs under the [[New Deal]] and the Supreme Court struck down many of those programs (such as the [[Railroad Retirement Act]] and the [[National Recovery Act]]) as unconstitutional. Modified versions of the affected programs were afterwards approved by the Court, including Social Security.

When ''Helvering v. Davis'' was argued before the Court, the larger issue of constitutionality of the old-age insurance portion of Social Security was not decided. The case was limited to whether the payroll tax was a suitable use of Congress's taxing power. Despite this, no serious challenges regarding the system's constitutionality are now being litigated, and Congress's spending power may be more coextensive, as shown in cases like ''[[South Dakota v. Dole]]''&lt;ref&gt;483 U.S. 203 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt; during the Reagan Administration.

===Payments to former Nazis===
{{Expand section|date=June 2015}}
In June 2015, the [[Associated Press]] revealed that the US government had given US$20 million to former Nazis in Social Security payments between February 1962 and January 2015.&lt;ref name="wjcuspaiddeported"&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/us-paid-deported-former-nazis-more-than-usd20-million-in-social-security-benefits US paid deported former Nazis more than $20 million in Social Security benefits], [[World Jewish Congress]], June 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fraud and abuse==

===Social Security Number theft===
Because Social Security Numbers have become useful in [[identity theft]] and other forms of [[crime]], various schemes have been perpetrated to acquire valid Social Security Numbers and related identity information.

In February 2006, the Social Security Administration received several reports of an email message being circulated addressed to "Dear Social Security Number And Card owner" and purporting to be from the Social Security Administration. The message informs the reader "that someone illegally is using your Social Security number and assuming your identity" and directs the reader to a website designed to look like Social Security's Internet website.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am outraged that someone would target an unsuspecting public in this manner," said Commissioner [[Jo Anne B. Barnhart]]. "I have asked the Inspector General to use all the resources at his command to find and prosecute whoever is perpetrating this fraud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/PhishingScam-pr.htm |title=Phishing Scam|publisher=Ssa.gov |accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Once directed to the phony website, the individual is reportedly asked to confirm his or her identity with "Social Security and bank information." Specific information about the individual's credit card number, expiration date and [[Personal identification number|PIN]] is then requested. "Whether on our online website or by phone, Social Security will never ask you for your credit card information or your PIN," Commissioner [[Jo Anne B. Barnhart]] reported.

Social Security Administration Inspector General O'Carroll recommended people always take precautions when giving out personal information. "You should never provide your Social Security number or other personal information over the Internet or by telephone unless you are extremely confident of the source to whom you are providing the information," O'Carroll said. See [http://www.ssa.gov/pressoffice/pr/PhishingScam-pr.htm Press Release].

===Fraud in the acquisition and use of benefits===
Given the vast size of the program, [[fraud]] sometimes occurs. The [[Social Security Administration]] has its own investigatory unit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://oig.ssa.gov/cooperative-disability-investigations-cdi|title=Cooperative Disability Investigations (CDI) {{!}} Office of the Inspector General, SSA|website=oig.ssa.gov|language=en|access-date=June 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; to combat and prevent fraud, the Cooperative Disability Investigations Unit (CDIU). The Cooperative Disability Investigations (CDI) Program continues to be one of the most successful initiatives, contributing to the integrity of SSA's disability programs. In addition when investigating fraud in other SSA programs, the [[Social Security Administration]] may request investigatory assistance from other federal law enforcement agencies including the Office of the Inspector General and the [[FBI]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Restrictions on potentially deceptive communications===
Because of the importance of Social Security to millions of Americans, many [[Direct marketing|direct-mail]] marketers packaged their mailings to resemble official communications from the Social Security Administration, hoping that recipients would be more likely to open them. In response, Congress amended the Social Security Act in 1988 to prohibit the private use of the phrase "Social Security" and several related terms in any way that would convey a false impression of approval from the Social Security Administration. The [[constitutionality]] of this law ({{usc|42|1140}}) was upheld in ''United Seniors Association, Inc. v. Social Security Administration'', 423 F.3d 397 (4th Cir. 2005), cert den 547 U.S. 1162; 126 S.Ct. 2346 (2006) (text at Findlaw).&lt;ref name="caselaw.lp.findlaw.com.660"&gt;{{cite web| title=United Seniors Association vs Social Security Administration | url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/4th/041804p.pdf | accessdate=March 17, 2006 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public economics==

===Current recipients===
[[File:Social Security Worker to Beneficiary Ratio.png|thumb|right|Social Security – Ratio of Covered Workers to Retirees]]
The 2011 annual report by the program's Board of Trustees noted the following: in 2010, 54 million people were receiving Social Security benefits, while 157 million people were paying into the fund; of those receiving benefits, 44 million were receiving retirement benefits and 10 million disability benefits. In 2011, there will be 56 million beneficiaries and 158 million workers paying in. In 2010, total income was $781.1 billion and expenditures were $712.5 billion, which meant a total net increase in assets of $68.6 billion. Assets in 2010 were $2.6 trillion, an amount that is expected to be adequate to cover the next 10 years. In 2023, total income and interest earned on assets are projected to no longer cover expenditures for Social Security, as demographic shifts burden the system. By 2035, the ratio of potential retirees to working age persons will be 37 percent—there will be less than three potential income earners for every retiree in the population. At this rate the Social Security Trust Fund would be exhausted by 2036.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Wihbey |title=2011 Annual Report by the Social Security Board of Trustees |publisher=journalistsresource.org |date=June 9, 2011 |url= http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/politics/social-security-report-2011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saving behavior===
Social Security affects the saving behavior of the people in three different ways. The wealth '''[[Substitution effect#Substitution effect|substitution effect]]''' occurs when a person saving for retirement recognizes that the Social Security system will take care of him and decreases his expectations about how much he needs to personally save. The '''retirement effect''' occurs when a taxpayer saves more each year in an effort to reduce the total number of years he must work to accumulate enough savings before retirement. The '''bequest effect''' occurs when a taxpayer recognizes a decrease in resources stemming from the Social Security tax and compensates by increasing personal savings to cover future expected costs of having children.&lt;ref name="Rosen, Harvey S. 2008"&gt;{{cite book |author=Rosen, Harvey S., Gayer, Ted |year=2008 |title=Public Finance |edition=8th |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]] |isbn=978-0-07-125939-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reducing cost of living adjustment (COLA)===
At present, a retiree's benefit is annually adjusted for inflation to reflect changes in the [[consumer price index]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/94-803.pdf Social Security: Cost-of-Living Adjustments] [[Congressional Research Service]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some economists argue that the consumer price index overestimates price increases in the economy and therefore is not a suitable metric for adjusting benefits, while others argue that the CPI underestimates the effect of inflation on what retired people actually need to buy to live.

The current cost of living adjustment is based on the [[United States Consumer Price Index#CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W)|consumer price index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W)]]. The [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] routinely checks the prices of 211 different categories of consumption items in 38 geographical areas to compute 8,018 item-area indices. Many other indices are computed as weighted averages of these base indices. CPI-W is based on a [[market basket]] of goods and services consumed by urban wage earners and clerical workers. The weights for that index are updated in January of every even-numbered year. People who say that the CPI-W overestimates inflation recommend updating the weights each month; this produces the [[United States Chained Consumer Price Index|Chained Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers (C-CPI-U)]]. People who say that the C-CPI-U [or the [[United States Consumer Price Index#CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)|unchained CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)]]] disadvantages the elderly point out that seniors consume more medical care than younger people, and that the costs of medical care have been rising faster than inflation in other parts of the economy. According to this view, the costs of the things the elderly buy have been rising faster than the [[market basket]] averaged to obtain CPI-W, CPI-U or C-CPI-U. Some have recommended fixing this by using a [[United States Consumer Price Index#CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E)|CPI for the Elderly (CPI-E)]].

In 2003 economics researchers Hobijn and Lagakos estimated that the social security trust fund would run out of money in 40 years using CPI-W and in 35 years using CPI-E.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Consumption ===
According to a 2016 study in the ''[[American Economic Journal|American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics]],'' the Social Security benefit increases from 1952 to 1991 have a "large, immediate, and significant positive response of consumption".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Romer|first=Christina D.|last2=Romer|first2=David H.|date=October 1, 2016|title=Transfer Payments and the Macroeconomy: The Effects of Social Security Benefit Increases, 1952–1991|url=https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mac.20140348|journal=American Economic Journal: Macroeconomics|volume=8|issue=4|pages=1–42|doi=10.1257/mac.20140348|issn=1945-7707}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">'''Social dangerousness''' or '''Pre-criminal danger to society''' is a legal charge under [[Cuban law]] which allows the authorities to detain people who they think are likely to commit crimes. The charge carries a penalty of up to four years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7583775.stm "Leading Cuban musician arrested"], ''BBC'', 27 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cuban government]] has been accused by [[Amnesty International]] of using the charge almost exclusively against critics of the government.&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/Regions/Americas/Cuba |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909203943/http://thereport.amnesty.org/eng/regions/americas/cuba |archivedate=2008-09-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, political protester Ramón Velásquez was arrested for the charge of social dangerousness. Velásquez was participating in a march across Cuba that highlighted human rights violations and freedom for political prisoners. Velásquez was then tried in a closed hearing and sentenced to three years in prison. Velásquez was released in January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2010/02/27/imprisoned-dangerousness-cuba|title=Imprisoned for 'Dangerousness' in Cuba|date=2010-02-27|work=Human Rights Watch|access-date=2017-11-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Cuban law defines dangerousness (el estado peligroso) as "the special proclivity of a person to commit crimes, demonstrated by conduct that is observed to be in manifest contradiction with the norms of socialist morality." ... If Cuba determines that someone is dangerous, the Criminal Code allows the state to impose "pre-criminal measures," including surveillance by the National Revolutionary Police and re-education for periods of one-to-four years. The state may detain the person during this time. The law also provides for "therapeutic measures," including detention in a psychiatric hospital, that are continued "until the dangerousness disappears from the subject." The open-ended nature of this punishment affords the state extraordinary authority to abuse the rights of political opponents and the developmentally disabled.|[[Human Rights Watch]] 1999 report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/cuba/Cuba996-02.htm#P536_69587|title=II.

[[File:Thoughts on Government.jpg|thumb|The book ''Thoughts on Government'' by John Adams (1776)]]
'''''Thoughts on Government''''', or in full '''''Thoughts on Government, Applicable to the Present State of the American Colonies''''', was written by [[John Adams]] during the spring of 1776 in response to a resolution of the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress]] which requested Adams' suggestions on the establishment of a new [[government]] and the drafting of a [[constitution]]. Adams says that "Politics is the Science of human Happiness -and the Felicity of Societies depends on the Constitutions of Government under which they live." Many of the ideas put forth in Adams' [[essay]] were adopted in December 1776 by the framers of [[North Carolina Constitution#Constitution of 1776|North Carolina's first constitution]].

The document is notable in that Adams sketches out the three branches of American government: the [[Federal government of the United States#Executive branch|executive]], [[Federal government of the United States#Judicial branch|judicial]], and [[Federal government of the United States#The legislative branch|legislative branches]], all with a system of [[Separation of powers|checks and balances]].  Furthermore, in response to [[Common Sense (pamphlet)|''Common Sense'']] by [[Thomas Paine]], Adams rejects the idea of [[unicameralism|a single legislative body]], fearing it may become tyrannical or self-serving (as in the case of the [[Dutch Republic|Netherlands]] at the time).  Thus, Adams also conceived of the idea that two legislative bodies should serve as checks to the power of the other.&lt;ref&gt;''[[John Adams (book)|John Adams]]'' by [[David McCullough]], Simon and Schuster Paperbacks, New York, 2001.

In [[United States copyright law]], '''transformation''' is a possible justification that use of a [[copyright]]ed work may qualify as [[fair use]], i.e., that a certain use of a work does not infringe its holder's copyright due to the public interest in the usage.  Transformation is an important issue in deciding whether a use meets the first factor of the fair-use test, and is generally critical for determining whether a use is in fact fair, although no one factor is dispositive.

In [[United States patent law]] the term also refers to the test set in [[In re Bilski]]: that a [[patent]]-eligible invention must “transform a particular article into a different state or thing.”

==Basis==
Like most of the modern fair use doctrine, the doctrine of transformation was heavily influenced by the 1841 [[United States circuit court|circuit court]] case ''[[Folsom v. Marsh]]''.  In that case, [[Justice Story]] ruled that
&lt;blockquote&gt;if [someone] thus cites the most important parts of the work, with a view, not to criticize, but to supersede the use of the original work, and substitute the review for it, such a use will be deemed in law a piracy.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The standard of "supersed[ing] the use of the original work" would be widely cited as a standard for the degree to which a work was transformative when fair use had become more clearly fixed as a legal principle.

In the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], Congress defined fair use explicitly for the first time, giving as one factor "the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes".  This factor was later determined to hinge in substantial part on transformation.  See, e.g., ''[[Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music]]'', a case in the [[United States Supreme Court]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Under the first of the four 107 factors, "the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature ...," the inquiry focuses on whether the new work merely supersedes the objects of the original creation, or whether and to what extent it is controversially "transformative," altering the original with new expression, meaning, or message. The more transformative the new work, the less will be the significance of other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Campbell'' is important in large part because of this statement, ordering that commerciality should be given less weight in fair-use determinations and transformation great weight.

==Application==
There is no "bright line test" to determine whether one work supersedes the purpose of another; like the determination of fair use generally, it involves significant judgment calls.  However, there is substantial precedent that clarifies the nature of transformation in law.

Generally, use of a work to comment on the work itself somehow will qualify as transformative.  Quoting portions of a work to criticize it, as in a book review, is transformative.  Likewise, [[parody]] is transformative — repurposing a work to mock the work itself or the principles the work represents serves a very different purpose from that of the original work.

Repurposing a work to aid identification of the base work is also generally transformative.  In ''[[Kelly v. Ariba Soft]]'' and ''[[Perfect 10 v. Google]]'', the respective courts held that the creation and use of [[thumbnail]]s to allow users of a [[search engine]] to easily browse through images returned by their search was transformative.

Of course, as noted above, no one factor of fair use is dispositive; all must be considered.  Even transformative uses can be infringing, if other factors weigh against the defendant.  For example, in ''[[Rogers v. Koons]]'' transformation was not even cited as the court found the use failed to meet any of the purposes in the preamble of 17 [[United States Code|USC]] § 107. However, in ''[[Blanch v. Koons]]'' it was ruled that a [[collage]] painting including a close representation of a photograph was sufficiently transformative because "compared to Blanch’s original photograph, Koons completely inverted the legs’ orientation, painting them to surreally dangle or float over the other elements of the painting. Koons also changed the coloring and added a heel to one of the feet, which had been completely obscured in Blanch’s photograph."&lt;ref&gt;ERIC D. GORMAN, [http://www.stmaryslawjournal.org/pdfs/gorman.pdf APPROPRIATE TESTING AND RESOLUTION: HOW TO DETERMINE WHETHER APPROPRIATION ART IS TRANSFORMATIVE “FAIR USE” OR MERELY AN UNAUTHORIZED DERIVATIVE?]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Trilateral Patent Offices''', or simply the '''Trilateral Offices''', are the [[European Patent Office]] (EPO), the [[Japan Patent Office]] (JPO) and the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO). In 1983, these [[patent office]]s set up a programme of co-operation in an effort to "improve efficiency of the global patent system".&lt;ref name="EPO"&gt;European Patent Office web site, [http://www.epo.org/about-us/office/international-relations/projects/trilateral.html Trilateral cooperation], Projects. Consulted on March 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
The EPO, JPO and USPTO handle the majority of the world's patent applications.&lt;ref&gt; M. Ichikawa, [http://www.law.washington.edu/Casrip/Symposium/Number7/4-Ichikawa.pdf ''Towards a Global Patent System: The Japan Patent Office View.''], CASRIP Publication Series: Reconciling Int’l Intellectual Property, No 7, 2001, page 150 &lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, these [[patent office]]s set up a programme of co-operation in an effort to "improve efficiency of the global patent system"&lt;ref name="EPO" /&gt; and to exchange information and views on patent administration and examination practice in order to gain mutual benefits.&lt;ref name="ACIP"&gt;[http://www.acip.gov.au/library/bsreport.pdf Report on a review of the patenting of business systems] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051103180156/http://www.acip.gov.au/library/bsreport.pdf |date=2005-11-03 }}, Advisory Council on Intellectual Property&lt;/ref&gt;

==Co-operation areas==
Key areas of co-operation include the development of a common system architecture for electronic exchange of documents such as [[priority document]]s, developing standards for electronic filing of [[patent application]]s and [[genetic sequence]] submissions, harmonisation of patent practices, and developing common patent information dissemination policies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trilateral.net/about/achievements.html Most significant achievements], The Trilateral Co-Operation&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Business method patents===
{{Main|Business method patent}}
In June 2000, the Trilateral Offices released the results of a study on business method related inventions entitled.&lt;ref&gt;"Report on Comparative Study Carried Out under Trilateral Project B3b", Trilateral Technical Meeting, June 14-16, 2000, Tokyo, JPO&lt;/ref&gt; This report concluded that the mere automation of a known human transaction process using well known automation techniques was not patentable, and that a technical aspect was necessary for a computer implemented business method to be patentable, although this aspect need only be implicit in US claims.&lt;ref name="ACIP" /&gt;

It was decided that an important area of focus should be collaboration on searching prior art in the business method field. In November 2001, the Trilateral Offices released the results of a study of search tools and strategies.&lt;ref&gt;"Trilateral Project B3a", Exchange of Search Results, Report on Concurrent Search Program using PCT Applications for Business Method-related Inventions&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that each Office’s ability to search the prior art for business method inventions was satisfactory but that the EPO and USPTO should make more use of the JPO search documentation and vice versa and that there should be more exchange of [[non-patent literature]] (NPL) searching information.&lt;ref name="ACIP" /&gt;

A '''visiting forces agreement''' ('''VFA''') is an agreement between a country and a foreign nation having [[military]] forces visiting in that country. Visiting forces agreements are similar in intent to [[status of forces agreement]]s (SOFAs).  A VFA typically covers forces visiting temporarily, while a SOFA typically covers forces based in the host nation as well as visiting forces.

==Agreements==
While the [[United States]] military has the largest foreign presence and therefore accounts for most VFAs, other countries having troops temporarily serving abroad negotiate VFAs with states where they serve.

===Terms of operation===
The VFA is intended to clarify the terms under which the foreign military is allowed to operate. Typically, a VFA is mainly concerned with the legal issues associated with military individuals and property. This may include issues like entry and exit into the country, tax liabilities, postal services, or employment terms for host-country nationals, but the most contentious issues are civil and criminal jurisdiction over the visiting forces. For civil matters, VFAs provide for how civil damages caused by the forces will be determined and paid. Criminal issues vary, but the typical provision in U.S. VFAs is that U.S. military courts will have jurisdiction over crimes committed either by a servicemember against another servicemember or by a servicemember as part of his or her military duty, but the host nation retains jurisdiction over other crimes.

===Host nation concerns===
In many host nations, the VFA can become a major political issue following crimes allegedly committed by visiting service members. This is especially true when the incidents involve severe crimes, such as [[robbery]], [[murder]], [[manslaughter]] or [[Rape|sex crimes]], especially when the charge is defined differently between the two nations. For example, in 2005 in the [[Philippines]], four [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] were charged with raping a local woman with whom they had been drinking.  As the incident had no connection with the military duties of the accused, they were tried under Philippine law in a Philippine court, which convicted one of the accused and acquitted the others.  (''For more information, see: [[Subic rape case]]'')

===Political issues===
The political issue of VFAs is complicated by the fact that many host countries have mixed feelings about foreign troops on their soil, and demands to renegotiate the VFA are often combined with calls for foreign troops to leave entirely. Issues of different national customs can arise. Many U.S. observers, for example, feel that host country justice systems grant a much weaker set of protections to the accused than the U.S. and that host country courts can be subject to popular pressure to deliver a guilty verdict; furthermore, that American servicemembers ordered to a foreign posting should not be forced to give up the rights they are afforded under the [[United States Bill of Rights]]. On the other hand, host country observers having no local counterpart to the  Bill of Rights often feel that this is an irrelevant excuse for demanding special treatment, and resembles the [[Extraterritoriality|extraterritorial]] agreements demanded by Western countries during the colonial era. One host country where such sentiment is widespread, South Korea, itself has forces in [[Kyrgyzstan]] and has negotiated a SOFA that confers total immunity to its servicemembers from prosecution by Kyrgyz authorities for any crime whatsoever, something far in excess of the privileges many South Koreans object to in their nation's SOFA with the U.S.{{cn|date=July 2015}}

To many U.S. observers, the fact that most accused criminals eventually end up being tried in a local court and found guilty proves that the system is working; to some host country observers, it reinforces the perception that the VFA protects the guilty and makes the exceptions more glaring.

[[File:Titeleitorindia2006.jpg|thumb|A [[Guarani-Kaiowá]] indigenous Brazilian shows her voter identification, September 2006]]
A '''voter ID law''' is a law that requires a person to show some form of identification on election day. In many jurisdictions requiring voter IDs (such as New Hampshire), voters who do not have photo ID often must sign a Challenged Voter Affidavit in order to receive a ballot to vote.  Because of perceptions of a differing means to obtain identification on the basis of socioeconomic status, age, or race, some people consider these laws as controversial.  

==Examples==

=== Argentina ===

In Argentina [[Compulsory voting|voting is compulsory]] for all citizens between 18 and 70 years old, non-compulsory for those older than 70 and between 16 and 18. To vote they must present a valid [[Documento Nacional de Identidad (Argentina)|Documento Nacional de Identidad]] at the corresponding voting center.

Most countries in Latin America have similar policies.

===Australia===
In Australia, where voting is compulsory for all adult citizens, no form of ID is required to cast a ballot at an election; instead, voters are asked three questions before being issued a ballot, so that they can be checked off the electoral roll: (1) what is your full name; (2) where do you live; and (3) have you voted before in this election?&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/polling.htm Australian Electoral Commission: Polling]&lt;/ref&gt; On election day, voters can vote at any polling place in their state of residence, and at selected polling places in other states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/ways_to_vote/ Australian Electoral Commission: Ways to Vote]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===
In Brazil voting is compulsory to all citizens between 18 and 70 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hup.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jpla/article/view/23/23 Timothy J. Power: Compulsory for Whom? Mandatory Voting and Electoral Participation in Brazil, 1986–2006, in: Journal of Politics in Latin America. S. 97–122]&lt;/ref&gt; To vote, all citizens must:
* Be registered to vote, getting a voter ID card, called "Título Eleitoral" aka "Títilo de Eleitor" in Brazil
* Report in person to the voting section&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tse.jus.br/eleitor/zonas-eleitorais Zonas eleitorais], 25 de janeiro de 2013 – 16h05 (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Present an official [[identity document]] with photo, usually the regular ID card ([[cédula de identidade]])

Since 2006 the Brazilian Electoral Justice is re-registering voters with [[biometric identification]]. In the 2014 elections more than 22 million voters out of 141 million&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tse.jus.br/eleicoes/biometria-e-urna-eletronica Biometria e urna eletrônica], 21 de junho de 2013  – 18h31 (in Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt; will be identified by fingerprints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.tse.jus.br/electronic-voting/the-biometrical-system-in-brazil The Biometrical System in Brazil], 27 de junho de 2013 - 18h29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

====Federal elections====
In Canada, the Federal government mails an Elections Canada registration confirmation card, which the voter takes to the polling station. The card tells the individual where and when to vote. Voters must prove their identity and address with one of three options:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=vot&amp;dir=ids&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e Elections.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Show one original government-issued piece of identification with photo, name and address, like a driver's license or a health card.
* Show two original pieces of authorized identification. Both pieces must have a name and one must also have an address. Examples: student ID card, birth certificate, public transportation card, utility bill, bank/credit card statement, etc.
* Take an oath and have an elector who knows the voter vouch for them (both of whom must make a sworn statement). This person must have authorized identification and their name must appear on the list of electors in the same polling division as the voter. This person can only vouch for one person and the person who is vouched for cannot vouch for another elector.

====Provincial elections====
However, in some provinces a voter must establish their identity by presenting a health insurance card, driver’s license, Canadian passport, certificate of Indian status, or a Canadian Forces ID card.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://monvote.qc.ca/en/edv_rensvote.asp |title=Monvote.qc.ca.en |access-date=March 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001174815/http://monvote.qc.ca/en/edv_rensvote.asp |archive-date=October 1, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are all photos IDs.

===France===
In France, you have to prove your identity to vote: at the registration (proof of address —A phone, water or electricity invoice...— and an identity document that prove your nationality —National Identity Card or Passport— and the day of the vote, in town larger than 1000 inhabitants, an identity document is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1367|title=Listes électorales : nouvelle inscription|access-date=2018-03-06|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/F1361|title=Quelle pièce d'identité peut-on présenter pour voter ?|access-date=2018-03-06|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
Germany uses a community-based resident registration system. Everyone eligible to vote receives a personal polling notification by mail, some weeks before the election. The notification indicates the voter's precinct polling station. Voters must present their polling notification and if asked a piece of photo ID (identity card (compulsory in Germany), passport, form of identification). As a rule identification is not required other than by the polling notification. If the voter cannot present the notification, a valid ID and an entry in the register of voters can qualify for voting.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bundeswahlleiter.de/de/glossar/texte/Ausweispflicht.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/bwo_1985/__56.html Bundeswahlordnung § 56], paragraph 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceland===
Voting is voluntary for all citizens 18 years or older. All voters must present photo ID before being allowed to vote. To prevent double-voting fraud, every voter is checked against the national voter database before their ballot is placed into the ballot box.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.althingi.is/lagas/148b/2000024.html&lt;/ref&gt;
===India===
The Indian '''[[voter ID (India)|voter ID]]''' card is an [[identity document]] issued by the [[Election Commission of India]] to adult domiciles of India who have reached the age of 18, which primarily serves as an identity proof for Indian citizens while casting their ballot in the country's municipal, state, and national [[Elections in India|elections]]. It also serves as general identity, address, and age proof for other purposes such as buying a mobile phone [[Subscriber identity module|SIM card]] or applying for a [[passport]]. It also serves as a [[Travel Document]] to travel to [[Nepal]] and [[Bhutan]] by Land or Air &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://boi.gov.in/content/indian-passengers}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as Electoral Photo ID Card (EPIC). It was first introduced in 1993 during the tenure of the Chief Election Commissioner TN Seshan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci/eci.html |title=Election Commission of India |publisher=Eci.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Israel===
Similar to Germany, there is a national voters database and photo ID is required (identity card, passport or driving license).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.knesset.gov.il/elections18/heb/cec/NoticeIdentification.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===

In Mexico, voting rules are established by the federal government (the [[National Electoral Institute]]), and free photo ID cards are issued to citizens of Mexico to exercise their right to vote in that country. The voting ID card was introduced in the 1990s to "properly identify electors in a country with a history of voters casting multiple ballots and curious vote counts resulting in charges of fraud."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Agren |first1=David |title=Mexico's national voter IDs part of culture |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/story/2012-01-22/mexico-national-voter-ID-cards/52779410/1 |archive-url=https://archive.is/RRGvX/ |archive-date=28 Nov 2016|dead-url=yes|accessdate=24 June 2018|publisher=USA Today|date=25 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
The [[registration office]] of each [[municipality]] in the Netherlands maintains a registration of all residents. Every eligible voter receives a personal polling notification by mail some weeks before the election, indicating the polling station of the voter's precinct. Voters must present their polling notification and a piece of photo ID ([[passport]], [[identity card]], or [[drivers license]] (a passport or ID is compulsory from the age of 14)). Such photo ID may be expired but not by more than five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://valg.no/en/about-the-election/about-the-election/frequently-asked-questions-faqs/ |title=Frequently asked questions (FAQs) |accessdate=October 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Norway===
Voting in Norway is voluntary for citizens 18 years or older (16 in some municipalities). Every person who is eligible to vote are sent a polling card in the mail a while before the election. The polling card recommends the closest voting location to you, but you are not required to vote there, but you are required to vote within your municipality. The polling card contains the date(s) of the election, opening times of polling locations and information on how to vote. While it is not mandatory to bring the polling card on the day(s) of the election, it generally makes the process smoother. However, a photographic ID, such as a passport or a driver's license, is required to vote. During the election day after you pick your party, you present your photographic ID and optionally your poll card to the poll attendants who verifies the information against a database, and record that you have voted. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://verkiezingen2012.nl/hoe-stem-ik/zelf-stemmen |title=Elections 2012 (in Dutch) |accessdate=September 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
When physically voting on election day, every voter must provide a valid identification document (such as a passport, drivers license, or an ID card from the Swedish Tax Agency). If a voter is missing valid identification, another person with valid ID-documents can certify the identity of the documentless voter.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.val.se/svenska-valsystemet/satt-att-rosta/rosta-pa-valdagen-i-din-vallokal.html&lt;/ref&gt;

--&gt; or ''cantonal assembly''; Historically, or in [[Appenzell]] until the admission of women, the only proof of citizenship necessary for men to enter the voting area was to show their ceremonial sword or Swiss military sidearm (bayonet); this gave proof that you were a freeman allowed to [[bear arms]] and to vote. Women, and men who choose to do so, may show their voting card instead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.appenzell.info/en/appenzell/landsgemeinde-open-air-assembly.html Appenzell.info]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2515">A '''voting trust''' is an arrangement whereby the [[stock|shares]] in a [[company (law)|company]] of one or more [[stockholder|shareholders]] and the voting rights attached thereto are legally transferred to a [[trustee]], usually for a specified period of time (the "trust period").  In some voting trusts, the trustee may also be granted additional powers (such as to sell or redeem the shares).  At the end of the trust period, the shares would ordinarily be re-transferred to the [[beneficiary (trust)|beneficiary(ies)]], although in practice many voting trusts contain provisions for them to re-vested on the voting trusts with identical terms.

Voting trusts were made popular in [[Delaware]] [[corporate law]], but they have since been adopted widely by other states in the United States. They have also been extensively adopted in [[Offshore Financial Centre|offshore jurisdictions]].

== Purposes ==

There are several reasons why shareholders may wish to put a voting trust arrangement in place.
* Several shareholders may wish to create a unified block of votes, which together gives them more power than the collective sum of their fragmented interests.
* In many countries, in order to call [[general meeting]]s, shareholders need to hold a certain percentage of the issued shares of the company.  By aggregating their shares, the shareholders can confer this power on themselves collectively where they might not have it individually.
* Locking shares up in voting trusts can in some countries help deter a [[hostile takeover]].
* Voting trusts are also sometimes used to resolve [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]].  By putting the shares in a trustee who can vote them at arm's-length from the beneficiary(ies) of the trust, this can in some circumstances mitigate or absolve the original shareholder from what might otherwise constitute a conflict of interest (although in practice, to resolve conflicts of interest the trust will ordinarily be "[[blind trust]]"; while all blind trusts are necessarily voting trusts, not all voting trusts are blind trusts).
* Shares are sometimes aggregated into a voting trust to facilitate a corporate reorganisation.
* Promoters of companies sometimes aggregate their shares in a voting trust to safeguard control of the company.

'''''Wallace v. Jaffree''''', 472 U.S. 38 (1985),&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Wallace v. Jaffree|472|38|1985}}. {{usgovpd}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] [[List of United States Supreme Court cases|case]] deciding on the issue of silent [[school prayer]].

== Background ==
An Alabama law authorized teachers to set aside one minute at the start of each day for a [[Moment of silence|moment]] for "[[meditation]] or voluntary [[prayer]]." &lt;ref&gt;Code of Alabama § 16-1-20.1 (repealed).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ishmael Jaffree, an [[Citizenship in the United States|American citizen]], was a resident of [[Mobile County, Alabama]] and a parent of three students who attended school in the [[Mobile County Public School System]]; two of the three children were in the [[second grade]] and the third was in [[kindergarten]]. His youngest was being made fun of by peers because he refused to say the prayers. On May 28, 1982, Jaffree brought suit naming the [[Mobile County Public School System|Mobile County School Board]], various school officials, and the minor plaintiffs' three teachers as defendants. Jaffree sought a [[declaratory judgment]] and an [[injunction]] restraining the defendants from "maintaining or allowing the maintenance of regular religious prayer services or other forms of religious observances in the Mobile County Public Schools in violation of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] as made applicable to states by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution]]."

Jaffree's complaint further alleged that two of his children had been subjected to various acts of religious indoctrination and that the defendant teachers had led their classes in saying certain prayers in unison on a daily basis; that as a result of not participating in the prayers his minor children had been exposed to ostracism from their peer group classmates; and that Jaffree had repeatedly but unsuccessfully requested that the prayers be stopped.

Despite initially granting a preliminary injunction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Jaffree v. James |vol=544 |reporter=F. Supp. |opinion=727 |pinpoint=732 |court=S.D. Ala. |date=1982 |url=https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/FSupp/544/727/1686906/ |accessdate=2018-05-25 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama]] ultimately allowed the practice and found in favor of the defendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Jaffree v.

== Holding ==

=== Decision ===
The Supreme Court ruled, 6-3, that the Alabama law violated constitutional principle. Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] wrote the [[majority opinion]] and was joined by Justices [[William J. Brennan, Jr.]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], [[Harry Blackmun]], and [[Lewis F. Powell, Jr.|Lewis Powell]]. In his original opinion, Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] referred to "Mohammedism" when referencing the Islamic faith but changed this to [[Islam]] after receiving a letter from Omar Kader, then president of the [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}  Justice Powell wrote a separate concurring opinion, and Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]] wrote an opinion [[Concurring opinion|concurring in the judgment]]. [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren E. Burger]] and Associate Justices [[William H. Rehnquist]] (later Chief Justice) and [[Byron White]] issued [[dissenting opinion]]s. Rehnquist asserted that the Court's Establishment Clause reasoning was flawed inasmuch as it was based on the writings of [[Thomas Jefferson]], who was not the author of the Clause.

=== The opinion ===

The Court first noted that "the proposition that the several States have no greater power to restrain the individual freedoms protected by the First Amendment than does the [[United States Congress|Congress of the United States]]" is "firmly embedded in our [[United States constitutional law|constitutional jurisprudence]]" and that "the First Amendment was adopted to curtail the power of Congress to interfere with the individual's freedom to believe, to worship, and to express himself in accordance with the dictates of his own conscience." The "[[Lemon v. Kurtzman|Lemon Test]]," previously created by the Court to help determine whether legislation violates the [[Establishment Clause]], included as a factor that "the statute must have a secular legislative purpose," and the Court further held in ''Jaffree'' that "the First Amendment requires that a statute must be invalidated if it is entirely motivated by a purpose to advance religion."

The record in the case showed not only that the Alabama law "was not motivated by any clearly secular purpose" but that "indeed, the statute had ''no'' secular purpose." With no secular purpose behind the law, and because it expanded a previous law that already allowed for meditation so that it now explicitly included "voluntary prayer" as well, the only possible conclusion was that the new law was passed "for the sole purpose of expressing the State's endorsement of prayer activities for one minute at the beginning of each schoolday." Since "[s]uch an endorsement is not consistent with the established principle that the government must pursue a course of complete neutrality toward religion," the Court ruled in favor of Jaffree and upheld the Eleventh Circuit's decision.

==Dissents==

===Chief Justice Burger===

In his dissent to the US Supreme Court case, ''Wallace v. Jaffree'', Chief Justice Burger expresses several reasons for his opinion that the Court decided incorrectly. He begins by pointing out that the statute authorizing a moment of silence at the beginning of a school day, which mentions the word “prayer”, does not, thereby, unconstitutionally promote a religion. He maintains that the ruling against this statute actually is directly aggressive and intimidating to religion, which is as unconstitutional as a candid establishment of religion. Also in his first point, he contests the decision with the point that a school is constitutionally on the same level of government as state and federal legislatures and even the Supreme Court. Thus, the endorsement of a “moment of silence” with an oblique suggestion of prayer is no less constitutional as is the opening of a Congress or Court session with a prayer by a publicly funded chaplain.

In his next point, Burger emphasizes the tenuousness of the Court's peripheral reasoning, specifically including the statements of the statute's sponsor and the differences between the statute and its predecessor statute. Upon the subject of the statute's sponsor's comments, he raises many points that work to invalidate the use of the statements as evidence for the original intent of the legislature at the time of the statute's enactment. First, he mentions that the said statements were made by the sponsor after the legislature's vote on the bill and that the legislature did not, in all likelihood, know any portion of his views sufficient enough to claim his motives as those of the entire legislature. He also brings attention to the fact that the same legislator also stated that one of his purposes was to resolve a misunderstanding that silent, individual prayer is (unconstitutionally) prohibited.

Next, to discuss the differences between the debated statute and its predecessor, he brings up the Court's opinion that the inclusion of the phrase “or voluntary prayer” endorses and promotes religion. He says that the Court's reasoning behind this relies upon the removal of the phrase from its context. He compares this addition to the addition of the phrase “under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance and contests that the Court's logic would also condemn the Pledge of Allegiance as unconstitutional and therefore discernibly preposterous. When taken in context, he suggests, the phrase “or voluntary prayer” is perfectly constitutional as a measure to prevent the unconstitutional prohibition of individual prayer.

Burger, in his third point, calls out the Court's use of the “[[Lemon Test]]” as an indolent attempt to apply a “one size fits all” test to a less-than-standard case. He suggests that the use of the test ignores the Court's duty to examine the statute against the ideas of the Establishment Clause and that the decision of the case clearly shows this shortcoming.

In his conclusion, Justice Burger reiterates the fact that the statute was not an unconstitutional endorsement and promotion of religion that sought to establish a state church, but an entirely constitutional measure designed to prevent truly unconstitutional infringement upon the rights of students to pray individually as they please.

===Justice Rehnquist===

Justice Rehnquist's dissent to the US Supreme Court case, ''Wallace v. Jaffree'', relies heavily upon pointing out the faults behind the common misunderstanding of Thomas Jefferson's statements about the “separation of church and state” in his letter to the Danbury Baptist Association. He begins by explaining that the Establishment Clause has been closely linked with Jefferson's letter since ''[[Everson v. Board of Education]]''. He calls attention to the fact that Jefferson wrote the letter a full 14 years after the amendments to the US Constitution were ratified and that Jefferson, at the time, was residing in France. Thus, he says, Jefferson makes a less than ideal source of background of the Establishment Clause, no matter Jefferson's intended meaning.

Justice Rehnquist suggests, instead, that one turn to the actions of the Congress and James Madison's significant role in it for insight into the original intent of the Establishment Clause. He continues by referencing the debates of the colonies’ ratification conventions. He points out the fact that the states frequently opposed the ratification of the Constitution due to its lack of a Bill of Rights. Those who, upon that basis, opposed ratification thought that the government, without such an enumeration of rights, had a great potential to follow the authoritarian path they wished to avoid. To solve this impasse, Madison urged Congress to consider his draft of amendments. After some time of debate and revision, a version what is now the First Amendment was created: “No religion shall be established by law, nor shall the equal rights of conscience be infringed.” This version was met with opposition by many representatives as it could be construed “to abolish religion altogether” or “to be taken in such latitude as to be extremely hurtful to the cause of religion”. It was on this basis that the final version of the amendment was selected and ratified. Thus, says Rehnquist, one can see indisputably that the spirit in which the Congress approved the Establishment Clause was one of open-minded toleration, not one of hostility towards religion.

He then brings up Thomas Jefferson's reasoning for not issuing a Thanksgiving Proclamation. Jefferson said that partaking in prayer and religious exercises are acts of individual discipline and that the right to those activities can never be safer than in the hands of the people. Through this, Rehnquist maintains that the meaning of the Establishment Clause as a preventative measure to keep the government from establishing a religion but not to prevent the individual freedom to follow one's own beliefs.

In his conclusion, Rehnquist denounces the “Lemon Test” as “having no more grounding in the First Amendment than the wall theory created from “separation of church and state” in ''Everson v. Board of Education''. He says that because it has no basis in the amendment that it is designed to interpret, it cannot yield predictably constitutional results when applied to a statute.

'''''Westside Community Board of Education v. Mergens''''', 496 U.S. 226 (1990), was a [[United States Supreme Court]] case involving a school district's ability to hold classes on [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] after school.

==Background==
[[Westside High School (Omaha)|Westside High School]], in [[Westside Community Schools|District 66]], located in [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]], refused to let a group of students wishing to form a Christian Bible Study Club within their school. Bridget Mergens is the name of the student who initiated the process to start the club. She was a senior at the time. It was decided that the club could not take place because they would not allow a staff member to sponsor it (staff sponsoring was required or the club meetings could not take place at the school). The students argued that the district's decision was in violation of the federal [[Equal Access Act]] requiring that groups seeking to express messages containing “religious, political, philosophical, or other content” not be denied the ability to form clubs.

==Opinion of the Court==
In an 8-1 decision,&lt;ref&gt;{{ussc|name=Westside Community Board of Education v. Mergens|volume=496|page=226|pin=|year=1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the Court held that the club could hold their meetings, but that their sponsor could not be paid, as this would constitute an endorsement of religion prohibited by the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

The school's situation was placed under the Equal Access Act because it allowed other ‘limited open forums’. In Part III of [[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]]'s opinion, which did not reach a majority of the Court, she applied the [[Lemon Test]] to find that the Equal Access Act is constitutional as applied in this case. [[Anthony Kennedy|Justice Kennedy]], meanwhile, analyzed the application of the Act under different Court precedents, focusing more upon "coercion".

===Dissent===
[[John Paul Stevens|Justice Stevens]], in a dissenting opinion, would have [[Constitutional avoidance|avoided]] the Establishment Clause issue and permitted the decision of the Westside Board of Education on the grounds that it did not violate the Equal Access Act.

[[File:Whistleblowing.pdf|thumb|[[Federal government of the United States]]'s whistleblower awareness poster]]

A [[whistleblower]] is a person who exposes any kind of information or activity that is deemed illegal, unethical, or not correct within an organization that is either private or public. The [[Whistleblower Protection Act]] was made into federal law in the United States in 1989.

'''Whistleblower protection''' laws and regulations guarantee [[freedom of speech in the United States|freedom of speech]] for workers and contractors in certain situations. Whistleblowers are protected from retaliation for disclosure of information which the employee or applicant reasonably believes evidences a violation of any law, rule, or regulation, or gross mismanagement, a gross waste of funds, an abuse of authority, or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety.&lt;ref&gt;5 U.S.C. 2302(b)(8)-(9), Pub.L. 101-12 as amended.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law ==
The law covering whistleblowers falls under the category of Public law.

=== Public law ===

[[Public law]] is law that governs the relationship between people and the State, and it is composed of three types: constitutional law, criminal law, and administrative law. ''Constitutional law'' is the body of law that governs the principles and powers of the government, and the relationships between the different parts of the government. ''Criminal law'' is law that restricts conduct that threatens safety and welfare of society or the State. ''Administrative law'' is law that regulates the operation and procedures of government agencies.  The judicial branch is the branch of government that interprets the laws, and its body of laws is called case law.

==== Administrative ====

Excluding uniformed military, about 65% of federal government workers are employed within the executive branch,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43590.pdf|title=Federal Workforce Statistics Sources: OPM and OMB (Table 3. Total Federal Employment)|last1=Jennings|first1=Julie|last2=Nagel|first2=Jared C.|date=January 12, 2018|website=fas.org|publisher=Congressional Research Service|access-date=June 3, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are subject to orders and regulations issued by the President called [https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/ Executive Orders] as well as regulations issued by administrative authorities acting under the President and codified under Title 5 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] as follows:

Senior officers who fail to act on information regarding crime or incompetence are subject to permanent reduction in rank or [[court-martial]]. Civilians who occupy senior pay grades have similar requirements and restrictions.

States are organized in much the same way, and executive orders are issued by governors.

==== Criminal ====

Hazardous chemical exposure provides a good example of whistleblower action.

Disclosure and product safety are the difference between legal insecticide application and assault with a deadly weapon.

In most areas, physicians are mandated to file a report for "Any person suffering from any wound or other physical injury inflicted upon the person where the injury is the result of assaultive or abusive conduct."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/california/2010/pen/11160-11163.6.html|title=2010 California Code, Penal Code, Article 2. Reports Of Injuries|publisher=Justia US Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandated reporters are obligated to submit a report to a local law enforcement agency as follows.
# The name and location of the injured person, if known.
# The character and extent of the person's injuries.
# The identity of any person the injured person alleges inflicted the wound, other injury, or assaultive or abusive conduct upon the injured person.

Employers must inform and train employees prior to insecticide exposure to avoid criminal prosecution that could occur in addition to [[Workers' compensation|workers compensation]] obligations when the employee consults a physician.

In United States common law, [[Battery (tort)|non-criminal battery]] is "harmful or offensive" contact resulting in injury that does not include intent to commit harm. This is called tortuous battery, and this falls into the same category as automobile accidents which are handled with workers compensation. This is applicable even if there is a delay between the harmful act and the resulting injury.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. ''Fisher v Carrousel Motor Hotel, Inc.'', 424 S.W.2d 627 (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., ''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=13341405241248455408&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr Leichtman v. WLW Jacor Communications]'', 92 Ohio App.3d 232 (1994) (cause of action for battery where tortfeasor blew cigarette smoke in another's face).&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of criminal battery is: (1) unlawful application of force (2) to the person of another (3) resulting in bodily injury. For example, a crime has been committed if the employer fails to disclose insecticide exposure in accordance with public law (unlawful force) then subsequently violates the product labelling in the assigned work area (to the person) resulting in permanent disability (bodily injury).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://law.justia.com/codes/florida/2010/TitleXLVI/chapter784/784_03.html|title=2010 Florida Code, TITLE XLVI CRIMES, Chapter 784 ASSAULT; BATTERY; CULPABLE NEGLIGENCE 784.03 Battery; felony battery.|publisher=Justia US Law LIbrary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insecticide injury is an accident and not a crime if EPA is informed, employees are properly trained prior to exposure, and product label restrictions are not violated. Similar principles apply to rental property occupants, occupants of public buildings like schools, and customers exposed by a business owner.

Criminal penalties also exist within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding company finance.

Financial irregularities involving [[Misappropriation]] is one area where criminal penalties apply to federal managers. Funds allocated by congress for one purpose may not be spent for a different purpose, including payroll. The [http://nawctsd.navair.navy.mil/Resources/Library/Acqguide/appropriations.htm U.S. Navy] provides an example.

[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sup_01_18_10_I_20_47.html Title 18, United States Code, Section 1001] establishes criminal penalties for [[Making false statements|false statements]]. This applies to false statements exchanged between any two federal employees, which includes managers, appointed officials, and elected officials.

Criminal penalties also apply when crimes occur in the workplace, as is often the case with an injury. For example, illness that results after workplace exposure to hazardous substances requires medical evaluation. For the evaluation, access to the [[safety data sheet]] of the product that contained the hazardous substance is required, as well as, verification of [[workers compensation]]. Failure to post mandatory information is a crime.

Retaliation remedies are limited to withholding payroll from the manager and civil remedies that involve the [[Civil Service Reform Act of 1978|Civil Service Reform Act]].

State laws are also applicable to federal workers, and California provides an example. 
* [http://law.onecle.com/california/labor/6425.html California Labor Code Section 6425]

==== State law ====

Some states have their own statutes regarding whistleblowing protections, for example, New York.&lt;ref&gt;N.Y. Labor Law § 740.&lt;/ref&gt;  A school nurse who was fired due to mandated reporting&lt;ref&gt;''See'' N.Y. Social Services L. § 413.&lt;/ref&gt; of a single case of child abuse that was allegedly "covered up", could seek protection under New York law.&lt;ref&gt;''Vilarin v. Rabbi Haskel Lookstein School'', 96 A.D. 1 (1st Dep't 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leonard M. Rosenberg, "In New York Courts", ''NYSBA Health Journal'', 6, Summer/Fall 2012 (Vol. 17, No. 3).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== U.S. labor law and policy ====

Employer activity that is not prohibited by law is usually permitted. Ignorance of the law does not make something legal. Managers cannot order people to participate in situations that involve something that is illegal, unethical, or unhealthful. When a worker feels that this is the case, they may file a dispute. Workers will often prevail if some kind of law or public policy can be used to justify a dispute. When a dispute goes to grievance, then laws and policies need to be cited, otherwise the dispute may fail.

The Prohibited Personnel Practices Act amended United States Code, Title 5: Government Organization and Employees to provide federal employees with whistleblower protection. The law forbids retaliation for whistleblowing.

One of the more serious concerns is workplace safety, and failure to satisfy building codes established by the [[International Code Council]] can have a negative impact on occupational safety. Buildings constructed before 1990 probably do not satisfy these requirements.

As an example, managers may not recognize the reason for elevated illness rates when fresh air ventilation for the building is shut down. The building no longer satisfies OSHA laws and building codes without fresh air. EPA recommends fresh air exchange of no less than 15 cfm/person to prevent accumulation of toxic chemicals in the air, like the carbon dioxide that is exhaled in human breath. Inadequate fresh air will cause illness or death due to excess buildup of toxic gasses inside buildings.

Building codes applicable to most areas of the United States are as follows: 
* [http://www.epa.gov/iaq/pubs/ventilat.html Air ventilation: EPA]
* [[International Building Code]]
* [[International Plumbing Code]]
* [[International Mechanical Code]]
* [[National Electric Code]] 
* [[National Fire Protection Association]]

==== Supreme Court ====

The US Supreme Court has limited whistleblower protections for public disclosures based upon free speech for most government workers. [[Garcetti v. Ceballos]] is a decision that indicates that [[first amendment]] protection for free speech does not apply to situations that fall within the scope of the [[job description]] associated with the employment of each individual government worker. The Supreme Court decision means that government management may discipline government employees that publicly disclose crime and incompetence under certain circumstances.

Job related functions are supposed to be disclosed to management by [[grievance]] to the [[Inspector General]], to the [Office of Special Council], to appointed officials, or to elected officials.

Issues that exist outside the job-description are not prohibited by Garcetti v. Ceballos. Public disclosure of the work environment not related to work assignments does not compromise essential functions like national security and law enforcement. In theory, criminal penalties apply to managers that discipline employees for public disclosure of situations outside the job description.

The following are some examples of situations outside the job description. 
* Undisclosed hazardous material exposure when the hazard is not in the job description
* Unauthorized acceptance of defective goods or services when the defect is not associated with the job description
* Sexual harassment, racial discrimination, slander, and stalking
* Failure to provide meals, breaks, and rest time
* Compulsory work assignments without pay.

== Disclosing misconduct, free speech and retaliation ==
Federal and state statutes protect employees from retaliation for disclosing other employee's misconduct to the appropriate agency.

The difficulty with the free speech rights of whistleblowers who make their disclosures public, particularly those in [[national security|national defense]], that involve [[Classified information in the United States|classified information]] can have a negative impact on [[national security]].

Civilian employees and military personnel in the [[Intelligence assessment|intelligence gathering and assessment]] field are required to sign [[non-disclosure agreements]], a practice upheld by the Supreme Court in ''Snepp v. United States''. Courts have ruled that secrecy agreements circumscribing an individual's disclosure of classified information did not violate their First Amendment rights. Non-disclosure agreements signed by employees create similar conflicts in private business.

The [[United States Office of Special Counsel]] provides training for the managers of federal agencies on how to inform their employees as to whistleblower protections, as required by the Prohibited Personnel Practices Act (5 USC § 2302). The law forbids retaliation for whistleblowing. (See: [[#U.S. Labor Law and Policy|U.S. Labor Law and Policy]] above.)

== Acts ==

=== False Claims Act of 1863 ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:False claims act picture.jpg|thumb|right|false claims act]] --&gt;
The [[False Claims Act|False Claims Act (a.k.a.: the Lincoln Law)]] states details describing the process of an employee who files a complaint that turns out not to be valid. Congress enacted the law to provide a legal framework to deal with military contractors engaged in defrauding the federal government. This fraud occurred through either the overcharging of products or providing defective war material, including food and weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Larry D. Lahman, "Bad Mules: A Primer on the Federal False Claims Act", 76 Okla. B. J. 901, 901 (2005) http://www.okbar.org/members/BarJournal/archive2005/Aprarchive05/obj7612fal.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The original issue that spurred congressional action was the sale of defective cannons. These cannons were known to blow up and cause casualties among Union troops.

This law specifies that the employee filing the complaint can only be held accountable for a false claim if they knew that their claim was invalid to begin with when they decided to file it. If it is found that the person knew what they were claiming was not true, then they are liable for no less than double of the damages. The law provides for civil, but not criminal, penalties and provided a financial incentive for whistleblowers. The incentive equals 15 to 30 percent of the money recovered, which can amount to millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Government Contracting: Promises and Perils|last = Curry|first = William Sims|publisher = CRC Press|year = 2010|isbn = 9781420085662|location = |pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=ekHgTvokj7YC&amp;pg=PA205 205]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Corruption and Government: Causes, Consequences, and Reform|last = Rose-Ackerman|first = Susan|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 1999|isbn = 9780521659123|location = |pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=XBA1cZlB5AoC&amp;pg=PA58 58]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to financial compensation, the False Claims Act offers limited protection for workers that provide tips about defective products and services delivered to the U.S. government. This prohibits firing the employee that provided the tip. The [[statute of limitations]] may span six years.

The False Claims Act provides civil remedies for non-government workers. ''[[Qui tam]]'' is a provision under the False Claims Act that allows private individuals to sue on behalf of the government. Separate remedies are available for government workers. This False Claims Act helps to make sure claims are truthful, accurate, valid, and fair. If every employee filed a complaint just to file a complaint and be compensated for it, it would not be very reliable or fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Government|first1=United States|title=The False Claims Act: A Primer|journal=Justice.gov|date=2011|pages=1–28|url=https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/civil/legacy/2011/04/22/C-FRAUDS_FCA_Primer.pdf|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lloyd–La Follette Act of 1912 ===

The [[Lloyd–La Follette Act]] was passed in Congress in 1912 in order to guarantee the right of federal employees to communicate with members of Congress. This Act was the first protective legislation adopted for whistleblowers. The act established procedures for the liberation of federal employees from their employer and it gave them the right to join unions.

The act states that "the right of employees ... to furnish information to either House of Congress, or to a committee or Member thereof, may not be interfered with or denied." This legislation prohibits payroll compensation for managers that retaliate against employees that attempt to provide whistleblower disclosure (pay to the manager is suspended).

The intent is to provide direct feedback to Congress from federal employees, most of whom work within the executive branch.

This does not provide protections for employees that violate disclosure rules associated with [[Classified information in the United States|unauthorized classified information disclosure]] and other types of unauthorized public disclosure associated with issues like law enforcement investigation and juvenile records. Unauthorized disclosures of classified information are prohibited, so job-specific issues should be disclosed to the appropriate legislative committee, where members should hold the appropriate clearance.

As a general rule, Lloyd-La Follette disclosures should cover a topic that will benefit the government if the issue could be resolved by congressional involvement when the resolution would not be supported as a beneficial suggestion and would be opposed by management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=.com|first1=Encyclopedia|title=Lloyd-La Follette Act|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-3408900163/lloyd-la-follette-act.html|website=Encyclopedia.com|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Freedom of Information Act of 1966 ===
The [[Freedom of Information Act]] of 1966 can provide access to information required to pursue a whistleblower action. FOIA provides the public the right to request access to records from any federal agency. It is often described as the law that keeps citizens in the know about their government. Federal agencies are required to disclose any information requested under the FOIA unless it falls under one of nine exemptions which protect interests such as personal privacy, national security, and law enforcement.

The 9 exemptions are as follows:
* '''Exemption 1:''' Information that is classified to protect national security.
* '''Exemption 2:''' Information related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency.
* '''Exemption 3:''' Information that is prohibited from disclosure by another federal law.
* '''Exemption 4:''' Trade secrets or commercial or financial information that is confidential or privileged.
* '''Exemption 5:''' Privileged communications within or between agencies, including:
** Deliberative process privilege
** Attorney-work product privilege
** Attorney-client privilege
* '''Exemption 6:''' Information that, if disclosed, would invade another individual's personal privacy.
* '''Exemption 7:''' Information compiled for law enforcement purposes that:
** a)	Could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings
** b)	Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication
** c)	Could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy
** d)	Could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source
** e)	Would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions
** f)	Could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual
* '''Exemption 8:''' Information that concerns the supervision of financial institutions.
* '''Exemption 9:''' Geological information on wells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foia.gov/faq.html|title=Freedom of Information Act: Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)|publisher=United States Department of Justice|access-date=16 July 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FOIA also requires agencies to proactively post online certain categories of information, including frequently requested records.

As an example, the use of hazardous chemicals must be disclosed to employees, such as pesticides. Injury due to hazardous chemical exposure, radiation, and other hazards permanently disable 100,000 federal workers each year. Notification of hazardous chemical exposure is also required by [[Right to know]]. Right to know is necessary for workplace safety involving things like [[Multiple chemical sensitivity|chemical injury]], [[Acute radiation syndrome|radiation injury]] and other occupational illnesses where the cause may not be discovered by physicians without disclosures that are required by law. Workplace hazards must be prominently displayed and public hazards must be disclose to state and county agencies.

A FOIA request is the most valuable law that supports Whistleblower actions when a Right to know violation has occurred. This kind of request cannot be made anonymously and fees may be required. There may be an advantage if the request is made through an unrelated individual, such as a union official or another member of the community. Right to know is just one example of many reasons why an FOIA request may be needed to pursue a whistleblower action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Department of Justice|first1=United States|title=What is FOIA?|url=https://www.foia.gov/about.html|website=FOIA.gov|access-date=June 1, 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 ===

The [[Civil Service Reform Act of 1978|Civil Service Reform Act]] was the second protection adopted, but it only gave protections to federal employees. Later, the [Whistleblower Protection Act] of 1989 would provide protections to those individuals that work in private-sectors. Government workers that experience retaliation as a result of whistleblower retaliation may pursue defense against those actions under the authority of this Act. This established the following organizations to manage the federal workforce within the executive branch of government:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government|first1=United States|title=Civil Service Reform Act of 1978|url=https://archive.opm.gov/biographyofanideal/PU_CSreform.htm|website=Archives - Office of Personnel Management|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.mspb.gov/ Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB)]
* [http://www.opm.gov/ Office of Personnel Management (OPM)]
* [http://www.flra.gov/ Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA)]

These cover most of the 3 million federal workers within the United States.

The MSPB is a quasi-judicial organization with enforcement authority for prohibited personnel actions. MSPB is also responsible for reimbursing legal fees in some situations.

Issues that involve discrimination and harassment are pursued by the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]]. This may include failure to accommodate disability, in addition to inequities involving gender or race.

Federal workers are entitled to [http://redbook.gao.gov/6/fl0027620.php financial benefits]. Thus, a whistle-blower action should include a beneficial suggestion to reserve the right to potential financial compensation for job-related improvement suggestions.

Other remedies may be available if a federal worker is unable to return to work. Employees with over 5 years government service may be eligible for early retirement if medical records support a finding of disability not accommodated in accordance with the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]]. Retirement rules are listed in the [http://www.opm.gov/settlementguidelines/principles.asp OPM Retirement Settlement Guide]. Early retirement due to medical disability affects about 100,000 federal workers every year. &lt;br /&gt;

=== Ethics in Government Act of 1978 ===
[[File:US-OfficeOfGovernmentEthics-Logo.svg|thumb|right|United States Office of Government Ethics]]

The [http://www.usoge.gov/ U.S. Office of Government Ethics] is the supervising ethics office for the executive branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Publishing Office|first1=U.S. Government|title=Ethics in Government Act of 1978|journal=United States Code Supplement 4, Title 5 - Government Organization and Employees|date=2010|pages=57–86|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2010-title5/pdf/USCODE-2010-title5-app-ethicsing.pdf|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ethics in Government Act]] of 1978 was put in place so that government officials have their salaries put on public record for all to see. This was a result of the Nixon [[Watergate scandal]] and the [[Saturday Night Massacre]]. It created a mandatory, public disclosure of financial and employment history of government officials and their immediate family members for the regular U.S. citizen to have access to view. For example, if you were working within public service, your salary and other financial information relating to your job becomes public record within 30 days of becoming hired by the government.

The Ethics in Government Act provides three protections that apply to whistleblowers. They are as follows:
* Mandatory, public disclosure of financial and employment history of public officials and their immediate family.
* Restrictions on lobbying efforts by public officials for a set period of time after leaving public office.
* Creates the [http://www.osc.gov/ U.S. Office of Independent Counsel (OIC)] to investigate government officials.

The [http://www.osc.gov/ U.S. (OIC)] deals with ethical rules that cover all government employees and the OIC is responsible for documenting the whistleblower process. 
* [http://www.osc.gov/ppp.htm Prohibited Personnel Practices]
* [http://www.osc.gov/wbdisc.htm Whistleblower Disclosures]

One whistleblower caution is that [[Hatch Act of 1939|political activity is prohibited by government employees]]. Whistleblower contact with elected or appointed officials must include no references to political support, political opposition, and campaigns.

Another caution is that whistleblowers that have to leave government employment are given time limits that prohibit employment by entities where the government employee was responsible for any contractual interactions. The former government employee may be prohibited from interacting in an official capacity directly with former coworkers that are still employed by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Law School|first1=Cornell University|title=Ethics in Government Act of 1978|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode05a/usc_sup_05_5_10_sq3.html|website=Legal Information Institute|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Whistleblower protection act.jpg|thumb|right|whistleblower protection act]] --&gt;

The [[Whistleblower Protection Act]] of 1989 was enacted to protect federal employees who disclose "Government illegality, waste, and corruption" from adverse consequences related to their employment.&lt;ref&gt;Public Law 101-12, 1989 https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/STATUTE-103/pdf/STATUTE-103-Pg16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This act provides protection to whistleblowers that may receive demotions, pay cuts, or a replacement employee. There are certain rules stated in this act that are civil protection standards against voidance of dismissal, voidancce of cancellation of worker dispatch contracts, and disadvantageous treatment (i.e. demotion or a pay cut). The court judges what is considered valid or not for each complaint filed for dismissal or cancellation.

However, there are certain limitations to the Protection Act. For example, this act does not cover tax laws or regulate money used in political activities. It is in these political campaigns where whistleblowing is more effective in comparison to other organizations. Whistleblowers are required to present information and other documents that can back up their claims when filing a dispute. If it is found that they are lying, they may be subjected to criminal charges.

The Supreme Court has ruled this protection only applies to government workers when the disclosure is not directly related to the job. The U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) uses agency lawyers in the place of "administrative law judges" to decide federal employees' whistleblower appeals. These lawyers, dubbed "attorney examiners," deny 98% of whistleblower appeals; the Board and the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals give great deference to their initial decisions, resulting in affirmance rates of 97% and 98%, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[Robert J. McCarthy, "Blowing in the Wind: Answers for Federal Whistleblowers," 3 WILLIAM &amp; MARY POLICY REVIEW 184 (2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; Whistleblower Protection does not always protect federal workers. The Supreme Court ruling excludes whistleblower actions covered in the [[job description]] for federal workers. Job related issues must go through the hierarchy of the organization. When that fails, the issue must be brought to the attention of MSPB, EEOC, or OPM if it impacts employment. Unclassified issues not directly related to the job that in turn do not have a negative impact on national security or law enforcement may be suitable for public disclosure. Public disclosure would cover things like sexual harassment, racism, stalking, slander, and pesticide exposure, if you are not employed as an exterminator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mizutani|first1=Hideo|title=Whistleblower Protection Act|journal=Japan Labor Review|date=2007|pages=1–25|url=http://203.181.235.4/english/JLR/documents/2007/JLR15_mizutani.pdf|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shimabukuro|first1=Jon O.|last2=Whitaker|first2=L.

Although the Whistleblower Protection Act has some limitations, its main goals are to help eliminate corporate scandals and promote agreements in companies that coordinate with other legislations.

=== No FEAR Act of 2002 ===

The [[No Fear Act]] stands for Notification and Federal Employee Antidiscrimination and Retaliation Act and was made effective in 2002. It discourages federal managers and supervisors from engaging in unlawful discrimination and retaliation and holds them accountable when they violate antidiscrimination and whistleblower protection laws. It was found that agencies cannot be run effectively if federal agencies practice or tolerate discrimination. The main purpose is to pay awards for discrimination and retaliation violations out of the agency budget.

Employer obligations under the No FEAR Act are as follows (requires annual training):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Government|first1=United States|title=No FEAR Act Notice|url=https://www.sec.gov/eeoinfo/nofear.htm|website=U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Notify federal employees, former federal employees, and applicants for federal employment about their rights under the Federal Antidiscrimination, Whistleblower Protection, and Retaliation Laws
* Post statistical data relating to Federal sector equal employment opportunity complaints on its public website
* Ensure that managers have training in the management of a diverse workforce, early and alternative conflict resolution, and essential communications skills
* Conduct studies on the trends and causes of complaints of discrimination
* Implement new measures to improve the complaint process and the work environment
* Initiate timely and appropriate discipline against employees who engage in misconduct related to discrimination or reprisal
* Reimburse the Judgment Fund for any discrimination and whistleblower related settlements or judgments that reach in Federal court
* Produce annual reports of status and progress to Congress, the Attorney General, and the U.S. Equal Employment Commission

=== Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ===

The [[Sarbanes-Oxley Act]] (SOX) of 2002 was established to assist in the regulation of financial practice by corporate governance. It was devised by Congress to help with deficiencies in the business environment. This law was made in response to the failure of other laws that resulted in bankruptcy and fraudulent accounts. It was made to help regulate businesses to not commit fraud. Federal provisions were made in addition to state laws, which provided a balance in state and federal regulations in the business industry.

It established mandatory whistleblower disclosures, under certain circumstances, if mandated reporters fail to disclose, that could result in criminal penalties. This requires registration and accurate reporting for funding instruments, like stocks and bonds used to finance private industry. Some corporate officers are required to report irregularities (mandated reporters).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Romano|first1=Roberta|title=The Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Making of Quack Corporate Governance|journal=Yale Law School, NBER, and ECGI|date=2004|pages=1–12|url=http://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=22210008811700111307601410002710009902805601904903505312602508210112608510212500606710205903700110806103810608201511902400304805801204907408800111412401210408702405803708208801211509709912509408608300411807902800|access-date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National security protections ==

The whistleblower laws and executive orders that specifically apply to U.S. intelligence community employees include the [[Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998|Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act of 1998 (ICWPA)]], [[Presidential Policy Directive 19]], and the [[Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pen.org/sites/default/files/Secret%20Sources%20report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; National security whistleblowers do not currently have court access to challenge retaliation. The current system for enforcing intelligence community whistleblowers' rights against reprisal is entirely internal. Although the Congressional intelligence committees can intervene to help ensure that the whistleblower is protected, and an appeals mechanism was added in recent years. Under this framework, intelligence community whistleblowers are not protected from retaliation if they raise "differences of opinions concerning public policy matters," but are protected if they raise violations of laws, rules, or regulations. This makes it difficult for national security employees to raise questions about the overarching legality or constitutionality of policies or programs operated under secret law, like the NSA's mass surveillance programs.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.pen.org/sites/default/files/Secret%20Sources%20report.pdf|title = Secret Sources: Whistleblowers, National Security and Free Expression|date = November 10, 2015|access-date = November 23, 2015|website = |publisher = PEN America|last = |first = |page = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act (ICWPA) was passed in 1998. This law provides a secure means for employees to report to Congress allegations regarding classified information. The law, which applies to both employees and contractors, requires the whistleblower to notify the agency head, through an Inspector General, before they can report an "urgent" concern to a congressional intelligence committee. The law doesn't prohibit employment-related retaliation and it provides no mechanism, such as access to a court or administrative body, for challenging retaliation that may occur as a result of having made a disclosure.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In October 2012, [[Barack Obama]] signed Presidential Policy Directive 19,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://fas.org/irp/offdocs/ppd/ppd-19.pdf|title=Presidential Policy Directive 19 |date=October 10, 2012|access-date=April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; after provisions protecting intelligence community whistleblowers were stripped from the proposed Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act. It was designed to ensure that employees who serve in the Intelligence community, or have access to classified information, can effectively report waste, fraud, and abuse, while protecting classified information. The order prohibits retaliation against intelligence community employees who make a protected disclosure through the proper internal channels and establishes remedies for substantiated retaliation claims. The directive requires each intelligence community agency to establish policies and procedures that prohibit retaliation and to create a process through which the agency's Inspector General can review personnel or security clearance decisions alleged to be retaliatory. The directive also creates a process by which a whistleblower can appeal an agency-level decision regarding a retaliation claim to the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community, who can then decide whether or not to convene a review panel of three Inspectors General to review it. The Panel can only make recommendations back to the head of the original agency where the complaint was first lodged, and cannot actually require agencies to correct it.

PPD-19 does not protect contractors from any form of reprisal except decisions connected to their security clearance, which leaves them open to retaliatory terminations, investigations and criminal prosecutions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to whistleblower lawyer Mark Zaid, excluding contractors was "a remarkable and obviously intentional oversight, given the significant number of contractors who now work within the intelligence community. This is a gap that desperately needs to be closed, as I often have contractors coming to me with whistleblower-type concerns and they are the least protected of them all."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Obama's 'misleading' comment on whistleblower protections|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/federal_government/obamas-misleading-comment-on-whistleblower-protections/2013/08/12/eb567e3c-037f-11e3-9259-e2aafe5a5f84_story.html|newspaper = The Washington Post|date = 2013-08-12|access-date = 2015-11-24|issn = 0190-8286|language = en-US|first = Joe|last = Davidson}}&lt;/ref&gt; National security contractors used to have stronger whistleblower rights under the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (NDAA), which protected Department of Defense contractors against reprisal. The law also created a process through which contractors could request a remedy, initially through agency Inspector General investigations and subsequently through access to district court jury trials for civil complaints. The law covered close to 60 percent of government contractors, including NSA, DIA and other intelligence community whistleblowers working at the Pentagon, but it didn't cover CIA contractors. These rights were subsequently removed through the 2013 NDAA (passed prior to Edward Snowden's disclosures) and no longer apply. As a result, according to PEN America, since 2013 intelligence community contractors (such as [[Edward Snowden]]) "have had significantly fewer (and weaker) protections than other government contractors, and no statutory protection against retaliation (with the exception of security clearance-related reprisals, from which they are protected from under PPD-19)."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some whistleblower advocates believe that the framework created by PPD-19 is insufficient and that intelligence community whistleblowers will only have effective, meaningful rights if they are given access to courts to challenge retaliation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The 2014 Intelligence Authorization Act, which was signed into law on July 7, 2014, codifies some protections from PPD-19.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Reporting ==
To qualify for an award under the Whistleblower Program, you must submit information regarding possible securities law violations to the Commission in one of the following ways:
* Online through the Commission's Tip, Complaint or Referral Portal; or.
* By mailing or faxing a Form TCR to: SEC Office of the Whistleblower.

First, when submitting a tip, it is important to use the Form TCR, which is required to be considered a whistleblower for this program. It contains declarations of eligibility that one must sign off on. A tip can be submitted anonymously, but if this is the case, one must be represented by counsel. When a whistleblower tip is submitted, a TCR submission number will be given in return. When a TCR is submitted to the SEC, their attorneys, accountants, and analysts will review the data submitted to determine how best to proceed.
 
If it is a matter the Enforcement Division is working on already, the TCR gets forwarded to the staff handling that matter. Often a TCR gets sent to the experts in another Division at the SEC for their evaluation. Even if the tip does not cause an investigation to be opened right away, the information provided is retained and may be reviewed again in the future if more facts come to light. If the tip submitted does cause an SEC investigation, the enforcement staff will follow the facts to determine whether to charge an individual, entity, or both with securities violations. These investigations can take months, or even years to be concluded.

If a matter in which over one million dollars in sanction is ordered is final, a Notice of Covered Action will be posted on the SEC website. The Whistleblower then has 90 days to submit a Form WB-APP to apply for an award. From there, deeper analysis is required by the Commission's rules to determine whether to pay an award, and, if so, how much. The Commission's rules describe seven factors used to determine whether to increase or decrease the percentage of an award.

The four factors that may increase an award are: 
# the significance of the information provided by the whistleblower
# the assistance provided by the whistleblower
# any law enforcement interest that might be advanced by a higher award
# the whistleblower's participation in internal compliance systems - as in, if you reported on a company that you currently or used to work for, did you report internally first, and did you participate in any internal investigation

There are also three factors that can decrease the percentage of an award. They are as follows:
# culpability
# an unreasonable reporting delay by the whistleblower
# interference with internal compliance and reporting systems

The best thing to do in order to make the tip useful is to provide specific, timely, and credible information. The staff will be able to pursue an investigation of the tip if they have specific examples, details, or transactions to examine. So, the more information and specifics provided, the better. Any updates or developments that occur along the way should also be sent in. It is also helpful to understand that the Commission considers both positive and negative factors when determining an award percentage.

Lastly, it is important to note that the securities laws can be very complex and that SEC enforcement actions can take years to be finalized once reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Securities and Exchange Commission|first1=U.S.|title=What Happens to Tips|url=https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/owb/owb-what-happens-to-tips.shtml|website=SEC: Office of the Whistleblower|access-date=June 1, 2016}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal workers===
Federal workers notify the [http://www.dol.gov/_sec/welcome.htm Secretary of Labor] when unsafe working conditions are not addressed by management. Senior executives and military officers at the rank Colonel/Captain or above have an obligation to act on Whistleblower information. Financial or business irregularities may be reported to the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], [[Attorney General]], [[District Attorney]], [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]], [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], or other law enforcement agency.

If the information that is being reported is classified, then the recipient should have a [[need-to-know]] and the recipient must hold a [[security clearance]]. The need-to-know criteria generally means that the issue that is being disclosed will benefit the government if the dispute is resolved. A dispute that does not provide a benefit to the government is more appropriate for a labor dispute.

Federal employment is governed by the [http://www.mspb.gov/ Merit Promotion Protection Board]. This applies to positions that are not filled by election or appointment. Federal employees are covered by the [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973]], which offers inferior protection.

Workers that report crime or incompetence may get injured while at work. Federal workers, energy workers, long shoremen, and coal workers injured at work should contact the [http://www.dol.gov/owcp/ US Department of Labor, Office of Workers Compensation].

===Private companies and non-profit organizations===
Employees working for private companies notify organizations like the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) and [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA). Even though EPA and OSHA may provide no direct services for government workers, a report should be filed.

Government ethics laws are a complicated maze with unpredictable combinations. As an example, any business interests and tax records for a public employee is public domain because disclosure is required by the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 ({{USPL|101|194}}) and this information should be made available to anyone that requests that information because of the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]]. This applies to all government employees, including elected and political appointments. Employees working for private companies are also protected under the [[Americans with Disabilities Act]].

Private companies and non-profit organizations benefit when whistleblower protection is included in company policies and bylaws. Fines, penalties, and lawsuits may be avoided when [[immunity from prosecution]] is granted to any employee that notifies an owner or member of the board of directors when other employees or managers become involved in unethical or illegal activity on behalf of the organization.

Workers must assert their rights to obtain any kind of protection.

===Unionization===
[[Labor unions in the United States|Unions provide additional legal protection that is unavailable without unionization.]]

[http://www.nlrb.gov/what-we-do|The National Labor Review] Board (NRLB) helps to form federal unions, investigate charges, seek resolutions, decide cases, and enforce orders. The NRLB oversees the formation of the union, [http://www.nlrb.gov/what-we-do/conduct-elections|petitions, and election process] associated with selecting union officials.

Employers are obligated to inform employees about assistance programs associated with workplace injuries or illness, and union representatives are obligated to follow up on this information. Employers are required to allow the local union representative to attend meetings. The employer cannot interfere with support provided by the union representative.

A collective bargaining agreement (i.e. a contract) is a set of bylaws that establishes a partnership agreement between two groups of people, where one group is management and the other group is employees. The collective bargaining agreement also provides the same protection for managers, except managers are not entitled to union representation during labor disputes.

The collective bargaining agreement is separate from the union charter, which is the set of rules and regulations governing the activities of the labor union members.
*Voting and elections
*Union meetings
*Meeting notification
*Funds

Labor contracts involve [[Common Law]] established by court decisions ([[Louisiana law|except in Louisiana]]), [[Tort law|torts]] (private or civil law), and [[Criminal law|public law]].

A union may be organized as a business or corporate entity under [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/501- U.S. Code Title 26, Section 501(c)(3), 501(c)(4) and/or 501(c)(5)] if the labor organization is large enough to conduct banking transactions. A bank, credit union, savings and loan, or other financial organization can be consulted to determine the local requirements needed to establish an account. This allows funds to be collected for a common purpose.

=== Labor disputes ===
Labor disputes typically refer to controversy between an employer and its employees regarding the terms (such as conditions of employment, fringe benefits, hours of work, tenure, wages) to be negotiated during collective bargaining, or the implementation of already agreed upon terms.

One caution related to a labor dispute is that all union leadership team members are also employees, and these employees have job assignments. Lighter job assignments are usually given union leaders. In addition to not requiring the union leadership team members to be in the workplace during work hours, this can often include fewer travel assignments. Management has the right to change the job assignment for union leaders. This includes family separation using long-term travel assignments.

The whistleblower must understand the labor dispute process because union leadership may be corrupt.

The employee should initiate a labor dispute to protect their employment rights when reprisal occurs after a whistleblower disclosure. Employee rights are protected by [[labor law in the United States]]. These rights are not automatically guaranteed if the employee fails to start the process in a timely manner.

Employees with no collective bargaining organization are directly represented by [http://www.dol.gov/whd/contacts/state_of.htm state labor boards], [http://www.servicelocator.org/OWSLinks.asp unemployment offices], and the [http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/fedprocess.cfm Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]. This describes employees where no union steward is available at the work-site.

The dispute must be disclosed to the employer. If there is a union contract, then the process described in the contract should be followed. If there is no union agreement, then a disagreement with the employer should be discussed directly with government organizations that provide employee protection for the area of the disagreement. A labor dispute that progresses beyond words begins with a grievance.

=== Grievances ===
A grievance is an official statement of a complaint by the employee over something that is believed to be wrong or unfair that their employer has done.

The grievance starts a timer that usually prohibits the employer from taking negative action against the employee (and union steward). For example, a whistleblower complaint prohibits negative employer action for 90 to 180 days. A conventional grievance should provide a 30-day window. This prohibits things like workplace lockout, withholding payroll and firing. Each new employer action can be used to justify a new grievance.

When an employee grievance prevails, the lower level supervisors that were involved in the dispute may be temporarily prohibited from promotion. Manager pay may be suspended in situations where there was a whistleblower reprisal or other crime. This provides a manager incentive not to use unethical tactics to prevail. The employee should ensure the nature of the dispute is factual, justified, and substantiated. Factual means no false or misleading statements. Justified means that there must be legal justification to sway a judge or jury to favor the employee. Substantiated means that there must be evidence, testimonials, and witnesses that will support the facts stated.

A grievance should include the following:
* Organization information (name and location)
* Employee contact information (name, address, and telephone)
* Manager contact information (name, address, and telephone)
* Employee occupation
* Nature of complaint
* Desired resolution
* Employee signature and date
* Manager reply, signature, and date

The original grievance is given to the first level manager and a copy is kept for the immediate supervisor. If there is a union, then a copy should be given to a member of the union leadership team. If the manager reply is unacceptable, then the grievance is updated, attached to copies of the original, and given to the manager that supervises of the first level manager (second level supervisor). This continues from manager to manager upward through the organization. The time allowed for each manager response is usually 30 days. The time allowed for the employee response is usually 7 days. The ''nature of the complaint'' may expand to include further information at each step.

When an employee dispute involves an employer that is a member of a collective bargaining unit then the grievance process is described in the collective bargaining agreement. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/5/7121.html U.S. Code Title 5 Section 7121] for federal workers provides an example framework.

If no resolution is achieved at the top level for the local organization, or if the process takes too long, then the process is brought to the attention of the appropriate government organization.

Collective bargaining protects the employer as much as the employee. The grievance process described above provides time for the employer to correct situations that violate ethical rules or laws before enforcement action becomes necessary. Federal employees that are members of a union are generally restricted to binding arbitration. Employees not limited to binding arbitration may sue in court.

When there is no labor union or if the union dispute process has produced no productive results, or if the process takes too long, then the issue is provided to the [http://www.nlrb.gov/ National Labor Review Board], [http://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/publications/fedprocess.cfm Equal Employment Opportunity Commission], the [http://www.mspb.gov/ Merit Promotion Protection Board], the [[Inspector General#United States|Inspector General]], [https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm Senator], [https://writerep.house.gov/writerep/welcome.shtml Representative], the [http://www.whitehouse.gov/CONTACT/ President], the [http://www.justice.gov/contact-us.html Department of Justice], the [http://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/all50.htm Industrial Accidents Board], or other organization. A copy should be mailed to the officer or senior executive in charge of the top level managers in the local organization because other employees may interfere with regular delivery.

A grievance needs to cite an issue involving [[Tort|tort law]], [[common law]], or [[public law]] to be effective. There is no obligation for any enforcement action for issues that do not violate law.

Some common reasons for employee complaints are as follows:
* Failure to provide pay for hours worked
* Criminal activity
* Dangerous activity
* Assault
* Failure to provide time for meals/breaks
* Failure to provide safe working conditions
* [[Hostile work environment]] (i. e. harassment)
* Failure to accommodate handicap are most common reasons for employee complaints.

=== Meetings ===
The direct supervisor may order an employee to attend a meeting. The employee must attend a meeting during regular working hours, but there are limitations. U.S. government employees cannot leave the meeting or work area, except in situations involving disability or illness. [http://www.opm.gov/oca/leave/HTML/LEVINDEX.asp Government leave policy is established by public law]. Employees working for private companies operate under different rules, and if state laws require time for employee breaks and meals, restricting employee movement could be an arrest in some areas. Due to unequal protection, government employees are at greater risk of serious abuse by managers.

'''[http://www.dol.gov/whd/contacts/state_of.htm The state labor board should be consulted for more information.]'''

One word of caution is that Fifth Amendment protection may be lost if the employee answers questions, and it is necessary to reassert this right during the meeting after answering any questions. The meeting may involve very little conversation after the employee has asserted their constitutional rights and demanded the details of the accusation.

'''[http://www.dol.gov/oasam/programs/osdbu/sbrefa/poster/matrix.htm The employee must also assert their rights. Department of Labor should be consulted for more information.]'''

Employees must assert additional rights when ordered to attend a meeting that may involve any type of dispute. There is nothing that requires an employee to provide any information during a meeting if the topic involves a labor dispute, but the employee is entitled to be told the specific nature of any possible dispute.

The following should be demanded:
*Job description
*Performance evaluation criteria
*Performance evaluation
*Improvement expectations

Employees must never make false statements during any meeting, and meeting participants risk fine or prison when false statements are made when a federal worker is present.  [http://gbr.pepperdine.edu/2010/08/businesspersons-beware-lying-is-a-crime/  False statements] made in the presence of a federal employee are a crime, and this includes any statement made during an official meeting at a federal facility. Some states may have similar laws.

A court order may be required for [[Telephone recording laws#United States|telephone voice recording]] in some areas. Ordinary voice recording in some areas, such as '''[http://www.citmedialaw.org/legal-guide/california-recording-law California]''', requires consent of all parties before the recording can be used in a courtroom or during arbitration. Most meeting minutes are documented in writing by all parties, and the minutes are signed and dated at the end of the meeting.

The employees should request the specific nature of any accusation under the Sixth Amendment with the assumption that an unresolved dispute will be decided in a courtroom under the protections provided by the Seventh Amendment. Employees cannot be compelled to answer questions about potential crimes under the assumption that all such questions fall under the protection of the Fifth Amendment. No employee may be denied these protections for any reason.

The specific constitutional protections are as follows:

[[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|'''Fifth:''' ... nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law ...]]

[[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|'''Sixth:''' ... the accused shall enjoy the right ... to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him ...]]

[[Seventh Amendment to the United States Constitution|'''Seventh:''' ... where the value in controversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved ...]]

[[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|'''Fourteenth:''' ... nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws ...]]

If the meeting is a disciplinary hearing or a performance appraisal meeting for a government employee, and if the employee is told that any area of job performance is less-than-perfect, then the employee is entitled to be told about specific improvements for each less-than-perfect rating. The appraisal must fall within the boundaries of the job description. If any area of the appraisal falls outside the scope of any diploma, license, or prior training used during the hiring process, then the employer is responsible for training necessary to improve the skills that are part of the evaluation. The employer is required to allow an improvement period before reevaluation. Some employers may require employees to pay for their own training in some areas as a hiring condition.

Another protection is [[false imprisonment]]. The employer cannot lock doors and cannot forcibly move the employee against their will, unless an arrest has been performed, including a [[Miranda warning]]. The Sixth amendment requires that the employee must be told about the reason when moved against their will or detained against their will.

Rules vary by state, but employees are usually entitled to a 15-minute paid break every 2 hours and 1 hour unpaid meals every 4 hours. In most states, employees are entitled to overtime for any missed break periods, and state labor protection rules extend to federal workers.

One of the benefits of union representation is [http://clear.uhwo.hawaii.edu/wein.html Weingarten rights] to reduce employer abuse. Employees not represented by a union may have limited Weingartern rights, and may not be entitled to witnesses during a meeting. The employee and the union representative have the right to management information related to the dispute and both the employee and the union representative may take an active role during any meetings.

Weingarten rights are as follows:
* Employee has the right to union representation during discussion requested by management
* Employee must ask a manager if the discussion may involve disciplinary action
* Employee must ask the union steward to attend the discussion
* Employee must inform employer that union representation has been requested
* If employer refuses union representation:
# State "If this discussion could in any way result in my being disciplined or terminated then I respectfully request union representation. I choose to not respond to questions or statements without union representation."
# Take notes, do not answer questions, do not sign documents, and inform union after discussion
* Employee has the right to speak privately with union representation before the discussion and during the discussion
* The union representative is an active participant. He or she is not just a passive witness.

Government employees also have [[Garrity rule|Garrity rights]] to assert [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] protection related to employment that is completely different from [[Miranda rights]] that apply to employees working for private companies.

One issue with public employees is that certain workplace situations violate public law. Government employees that deviate from office procedures may violate laws, such as the New Jersey [[ticket fixing]] scandal&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1193043819695&amp;slreturn=1&amp;hbxlogin=1&lt;/ref&gt; and the Minnesota ticket fixing scandal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tmcec.com/resources/more-resources/ticket_fixing/&lt;/ref&gt; Employees that carry pesticide into the workplace from home violate the [https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hazcom/ghd053107.html Hazard Communication Standard].

Managers may threaten to take disciplinary employment action if an employee fails to disclose criminal activity. Government employees also have Garrity rights, and must assert the following when questioned by management. This must be separate from any report or statement from management if made in writing.

* "On ____________— (date) _________— (time), at ____________— (place) I was ordered by _________________— (superior officer, name &amp; rank) to submit this report (statement) as a condition of continued employment. In view of possible job forfeiture, I have no alternative, but to abide by this order and to submit this compelled report (statement).
* It is my belief and understanding that this report (statement) will not and cannot be used against me by any governmental agency or related entity in any subsequent proceedings, other than disciplinary proceedings within the confines of the department itself.
* For any and all other purposes, I hereby assert my constitutional right to remain silent under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and any other rights prescribed by (state) laws. Further, I rely specifically upon the protection afforded me under the doctrines set forth in Garrity v New Jersey, 385 US 493 (1967), Gardner v Broderick, 392 US 273 (1968), and their progeny, should this report (statement) be used for any other purpose of whatsoever kind or description."
* The employer shall not order or otherwise compel a public employee, under threat of discipline, to waive the immunity of the asserted Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination with respect to any submitted statement or report or answers to questions. (Employees shall not condition their compliance with a lawful order to submit reports, statements, etc. on non-disclosure to third parties by the employer.)
* Propriety of the discipline shall be determined through the collective bargaining agreement grievance arbitration process.

==Exemptions and limitations to whistleblower protections==
There are certain limitations and exemptions to the legal protections for whistleblowers in the U.S. With regard to federal legislation, the broadest law is the [[Whistleblower Protection Act]]. However, its protections only apply to federal employees. Both public and private employees may be protected under topic-specific federal laws, such as the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]], but such laws cover only a narrow, specific area of unlawful activity. Private sector employees are not protected by federal whistleblower protection statutes if they report either violations of federal laws with no whistleblower protection provisions or violations of state laws, although they may have some protection under local laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sinzdak |first1=Gerard |year=2008 |title=An Analysis of Current Whistleblower Laws: Defending a More Flexible Approach to Reporting Requirements |journal=California Law Review  |volume=96 |issue=6 |pages=1633–1669 |publisher= |doi= |url=http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1158&amp;context=californialawreview|access-date=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) published a report stating that employees who reported illegal activities did not receive enough protection from retaliation by their employers. Based on data from the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], only 21% of the 1800 whistleblower cases reviewed by the agency in 2007 had "a favorable outcome" for the whistleblower. The GAO found that the key issues were lack of resources for investigating employees' claims and the legal complexity of whistleblower protection regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://democrats-edworkforce.house.gov/media/press-releases/gao-nations-whistleblower-laws-inadequately-enforced-needs-additional-resources|title=GAO: Nation's Whistleblower Laws Inadequately Enforced, Needs Additional Resources |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=Feb 26, 2009 |work=democrats.edworkforce.house.gov |publisher=Committee on Education and the Workforce |access-date=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, union officials are exempted from whistleblower laws. There are currently no legal protections for employees of labor unions who report union corruption, and such employees can be dismissed from employment should they raise any allegations of financial impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Group urges OSHA to protect union whistleblowers |first=Michael P. |last=Tremoglie |url=http://legalnewsline.com/stories/510527300-group-urges-osha-to-protect-union-whistleblowers|work=Legal Newsline |date=June 4, 2012 |access-date=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act]], which legislates against union corruption, includes protections for whistleblowers, however the Supreme Court has ruled that these protections only apply to union members and not to employees of labor unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/reports/2012/05/extend-whistle-blower-protections-to-union-employees#_ednref2 |title=Extend Whistle-Blower Protections to Union Employees  |last1=Sherk |first1=James |last2= |first2= |date=May 23, 2012 |work=heritage.org |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |access-date=June 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''yellow-dog contract''' (a '''yellow-dog clause'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jargondatabase.com/Jargon.aspx?id=795 |title=Yellow Dog Clause |publisher=JargonDatabase.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; of a [[contract]], or an '''ironclad oath''') is an agreement between an employer and an employee in which the employee agrees, as a condition of employment, not to be a member of a [[trade union|labor union]].  In the United States, such contracts were, until the 1930s, widely used by employers to prevent the formation of unions, most often by permitting employers to take [[civil suit|legal action]] against [[union organizer]]s.  In 1932, yellow-dog contracts were [[Law of the United States|outlawed]] in the United States under the [[Norris-LaGuardia Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts.cornell.edu/econ/CAE/06-01.pdf |title=Coercion, Contract and the Limits of the Market |work=CAE Working Paper #06-01 |first=Kaushik |last=Basu |date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., ''The Crisis of the Old Order, 1919-1933'', (Houghton Mifflin Company, Boston, 1957), pp. 238-239&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''yellow-dog clause''' can also have a different meaning: [[non-compete clause]]s within or appended to a [[non-disclosure agreement]] to prevent an employee from working for other employers in the same industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dadgum.com/halcyon/BOOK/BIGGS.HTM |title=Stephen Biggs |work=Halcyon Days: Interviews with Classic Computer and Video Game Programmers |first=James |last=Hague |date=June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of term and brief history==
In the 1870s, a written agreement containing a pledge not to join a union was commonly referred to as the "Infamous Document." This strengthens the belief that American employers in their resort to individual contracts were consciously following English precedents. This anti-union pledge was also called an "iron clad document," and from this time until the close of the 19th century "iron-clad" was the customary name for the non-union promise. Beginning with New York in 1887, sixteen states wrote on their statute books declarations making it a criminal act to force employees to agree not to join unions. The Congress of the United States incorporated in the [[Erdman Act]] of 1898 a provision relating to carriers engaged in interstate commerce.

During the last decade of the 19th century and the opening years of the 20th, the individual, anti-union promise declined in importance as an instrument in labor warfare. Its novelty had worn off; workers no longer felt themselves morally bound to live up to it and union organizers, of course, wholly disregarded it. In the early 20th century, the individual, anti-union promise was resorted to frequently in coal mining and in the metal trades. And it was not membership in a union that was usually prohibited, but participation in those essential activities without which membership is valueless.

In 1910, the International United Brotherhood of Leather Workers on Horse Goods, following an unsuccessful conference with the National Saddlery Manufacturers' Association, called a national strike in the saddlery industry for the [[Eight-hour day|8-hour day]]. The strike proved a failure, and a large number of employers required verbal or written promises to abandon and remain out of the organization as a condition of re-employment.

In the case ''[[Adair v. United States]]'', the [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]]'s majority held that the provision of the [[Erdman Act]] relating to discharge, because it would compel an employer to accept or retain the personal services of another person against the employer's will, was a violation of the [[Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States|Fifth Amendment to the Constitution]], which declares that no person shall be deprived of liberty or property without due process of law. The court was careful, however, to restrict the decision to the provision relating to discharge, and to express no opinion as to the remainder of the law. The section of the Erdman Act making it criminal to force employees to sign anti-union agreements therefore remained unadjudicated.

The term ''yellow dog'' started appearing in the spring of 1921, in leading articles and editorials devoted to the subject which appeared in the labor press. Typical was the comment of the editor of the ''[[United Mine Workers of America|United Mine Workers]]''' Journal:

:This agreement has been well named. It is yellow dog for sure. It reduces to the level of a yellow dog any man that signs it, for he signs away every right he possesses under the Constitution and laws of the land and makes himself the truckling, helpless slave of the employer.&lt;ref&gt;Joel I. Seidman, ''The Yellow Dog Contract'', The Johns Hopkins Press, 1932, Ch. 1, pp.11-38&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though they were forbidden in the private sector by the Norris-LaGuardia Act in 1932, yellow dog contracts were allowed in public sector, including many government jobs, such as teachers, until the 1960s, beginning with precedent established in 1915 with ''Frederick v. Ownens.''&lt;ref&gt;Slater, Joseph E.. Public Workers: Government Employee Unions, the Law and the State, 1900 - 1962. Ithaca, NY: ILR Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The purpose of the yellow dog contract is essentially to prevent employees from organizing.  Such contracts are not enforceable, as they are illegal under the [[Norris-LaGuardia Act]] (Section 3).&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, Harold S. (1986) ''Roberts' Dictionary of Industrial Relations (3rd ed.)''.  p. 800.&lt;/ref&gt;
