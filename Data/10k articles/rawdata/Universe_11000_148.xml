An '''anchor portal''' or '''H-frame tower''' is a [[wikt:gantry|gantry]] structure supporting [[overhead power line]]s in a [[Electrical substation|switchyard]]. Their static function is similar to a [[dead-end tower]]. Anchor portals are almost always [[steel]]-tube or steel-framework constructions.

{{Renewable energy sources}}

'''Bioliquids''' are liquid fuels made from biomass for energy purposes other than transport (i.e. heating and electricity).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.r-e-a.net/document-library/articles/REAYearbook2009FINALVersion.pdf Renewable Energy Association 2009 Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bioliquids are usually made from virgin or used vegetable and seed oils, like [[Palm oil|palm]] or [[Soybean oil|soya]] oil. These oils are burned in a power station to create heat, which can then be used to warm homes or boil water to make steam. This steam can then be used to drive a turbine to generate electricity.

[[Rudolf Diesel]]'s first public exhibition of the internal combustion engine, that was to later bear his name, ran on [[peanut]] oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energybulletin.net/node/3986 Sustainable Energy From Vegetable Oil]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bioliquid production and use==
Bioliquids have been used for many years to provide heat for homes on a small scale but now big energy providers are looking at their use on a larger scale.

A controversial plant in [[Bristol]] (UK) was recently given the go ahead despite receiving several hundred complaints.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-12439191 BBC News: Bristol biofuel plant given go-ahead by Eric Pickles]&lt;/ref&gt; The plant will be built and operated by W4B and provide enough power for 25,000 homes.

==Advantages==
Bioliquids have several key advantages over other sources of renewable energy:&lt;ref name="greenwise"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/bioliquids-do-they-have-a-role-in-renewable-energy-2183.aspx | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120315021204/http://www.greenwisebusiness.co.uk/news/bioliquids-do-they-have-a-role-in-renewable-energy-2183.aspx | dead-url= yes | archive-date= 2012-03-15 | title= Bioliquids: do they have a role in renewable energy? | last= Aylott | first= Matthew | date= March 2011 | work=  | publisher= Green Wise Business | accessdate=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bioliquids have a high energy density
* The technology is well established, having been used for many years
* Can be used on demand, reacting quickly to changes in demand for power
* Can help reduce dependency on foreign oil.
* Reduces the green house gas emissions.

==Disadvantages==
{{Main|Issues relating to biofuels}}

Many of the same problems that affect biofuels also affect bioliquids and there are various social, economic, environmental and technical issues, which have been discussed in the popular media and scientific journals. These include: the effect of moderating [[oil prices]], the "[[food vs fuel]]" debate, [[poverty reduction]] potential, [[carbon emissions]] levels, [[sustainable biofuel]] production, [[deforestation]] and [[soil erosion]], [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], impact on [[water resources]], as well as energy balance and efficiency.

Bioliquids also have several key problems compared to other sources of renewable energy:&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/evaluation-of-bioliquid-feedstocks-and-heat-electricity-and-chp-technologies-nnfcc-11-016 Evaluation of Bioliquid Feedstocks &amp; Heat, Elec. &amp; CHP Technologies, NNFCC 11-016]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Price of fuel is very variable, due to competitiveness of feedstock for other uses (e.g. soap)
* Supply chain is still very new
* Governments, such as the EU, remained undecided on bioliquids

[[File:Stirling-Motor Kuhdung Hochhut 16082007.JPG|thumbnail|[[Stirling engine|Stirling-Motor]] powered with cow dung in the Technical Collection Hochhut in Frankfurt on Main]]
'''Dry dung fuel''' (or '''dry manure fuel''') is animal [[feces]] that has been dried in order to be used as a fuel source. It is used as a fuel in many countries around the world. Using dry [[manure]] as a fuel source is an example of [[reuse of excreta]]. A disadvantage of using this kind of fuel is increased air pollution.&lt;ref name="MudwayDuggan2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mudway|first1=Ian S|last2=Duggan|first2=Sean T|last3=Venkataraman|first3=Chandra|last4=Habib|first4=Gazala|last5=Kelly|first5=Frank J|last6=Grigg|first6=Jonathan|title=Combustion of dried animal dung as biofuel results in the generation of highly redox active fine particulates| journal=Particle and Fibre Toxicology|volume=2|issue=1|year=2005|pages=6|issn=1743-8977|doi=10.1186/1743-8977-2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, this kind of fuel source is known as "dung cakes".

== Types ==

===Dry dung and moist dung===
Dry dung is more commonly used than moist dung, because it [[Combustion|burns]] more easily. Dry manure is typically defined as having a moisture content less than 30 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fs.fed.us/woodybiomass/documents/Yakima_County_Biomass_Report.pdf|title = Biomass Report, Yakima County Public Works Solid Waste Division|format = PDF|date = |accessdate = 2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dung cakes ===
[[File:A Pile of Dung Cakes.JPG|thumb|A pile of dung cakes in the village [[Nihal Singh Wala]] of District [[Moga District|Moga]] in [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]]]
"Dung cakes", made from the by-products of [[animal husbandry]], are traditionally used as fuel in [[India]] for making food in a domestic [[hearth]] called a [[Chulha]]. They are made by hand by village women and are traditionally made from cow or buffalo dung. One dung cake of an average size gives 2100 kJ worth of energy. Dung cakes are also known as ''goitha'', ''uple'', ''kande'', ''gosse'' or ''thepdi''.

These are the cakes of cow dung molded by bare hands with a curvature to be able to keep stuck to the walls. Once dried they are put in a pile and covered with thatch called ''bitauda''. These bitaudas are visible in parts of rural India albeit with different names. The size and shape of the cake might vary with region. Its also not uncommon to see these cakes directly used in earthen ovens.

This bio-fuel has been used primarily for two reasons: for easy disposal of cow dung and as easily available and cheap fuel. 

=== Human feces ===
[[Human feces]] can in principle also be dried and used as a fuel source if they are collected in a type of [[dry toilet]], for example an [[incinerating toilet]]. Since 2011, the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] is supporting the development of such toilets as part of their "Reinvent the Toilet Challenge" to promote safer, more effective ways to treat human [[excreta]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth von Muench, Dorothee Spuhler, Trevor Surridge, Nelson Ekane, Kim Andersson, Emine Goekce Fidan, Arno Rosemarin (2013) [http://www.susana.org/_resources/documents/default/2-2042-ssp-17okt20134-10-about-the-gates-sanitation-grants-on-forum.pdf Sustainable Sanitation Alliance members take a closer look at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation’s sanitation grants], Sustainable Sanitation Practice Journal, Issue 17, p. 4-10&lt;/ref&gt; The [[omniprocessor|omni-processor]] is another example of using human feces contained in [[Fecal sludge management|fecal sludge]] or [[sewage sludge]] as a fuel source.

==Benefits==

The benefits of using dry animal dung include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.anl.gov/PCS/acsfuel/preprint%20archive/Files/47_2_Boston_10-02_0316.pdf |title=Pyrolysis Processing of Animal Manure to Produce Fuel Gases |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Cheaper than most modern fuels
*Efficient
*Alleviates local pressure on wood resources
*Readily available - short walking time required to collect fuel
*No cash outlays necessary for purchase (can be exchanged for other products) 
*Less environmental pollution compared to some other fuels
*Safe disposal of animal dung
*Sustainable and renewable energy source

'''''Durio zibethinus''''' is the most common tree [[species]] in the [[genus]] ''[[Durio]]'' that are known as '''[[durian]]''' and have edible fruit also known as durian.

As with other durian species, the edible flesh emits a distinctive odour that is strong and penetrating even when the husk is intact. Some people regard the durian as having a pleasantly sweet fragrance; others find the aroma overpowering and revolting. The smell evokes reactions from deep appreciation to intense disgust, and has been described variously as rotten onions, [[turpentine]], and raw sewage. The persistence of its odour has led to the fruit's banishment from certain hotels and public transportation in Southeast Asia.

There are 30 recognised ''Durio'' species, at least nine of which produce edible fruit. ''D. zibethinus'' is the only species available in the international market: other species are sold in their local regions. There are hundreds of [[cultivar]]s of ''D. zibethinus''; many consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.

==Description==
The wood of ''D. zibethinus'' is reddish brown.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book |author=Brown, Michael J. |title=Durio&amp;nbsp;– A Bibliographic Review |publisher=International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) |year=1997 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=3AcGwT0CdSwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-92-9043-318-7 |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
{{See also|List of durian diseases and pests}}
''D. zibethinus'' flowers are visited by [[bat]]s which eat the [[pollen]] and pollinate the flowers.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; The flowers open in the afternoon and shed pollen in the evening. By the following morning, the [[Sepal|calyx]], petals, and [[stamen]]s have fallen off to leave only the [[gynoecium]] of the flower.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

Over the centuries, numerous durian [[cultivar]]s, propagated by vegetative [[Cloning|clones]], have arisen in southeast Asia. They used to be grown with mixed results from seeds of trees bearing superior quality fruit, but now are propagated by [[layering]], [[marcotting]], or more commonly, by [[grafting]], including bud, veneer, wedge, whip or U-grafting onto seedlings of randomly selected [[rootstock]]s. Different cultivars may be distinguished to some extent by variations in the fruit shape, such as the shape of the spines.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Durian consumers express preferences for specific cultivars, which fetch higher prices in the market.&lt;ref name=ST&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stomp.com.sg/stfoodiesclub/taste/03/index.html | title = ST Foodies Club&amp;nbsp;– Durian King | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-07-25 | publisher = [[The Straits Times]] | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215124752/http://www.stomp.com.sg/stfoodiesclub/taste/03/index.html | archivedate = 2007-12-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most cultivars have a common name and a code number starting with "D". For example, some popular clones are Kop (D99 {{lang-th|กบ&amp;nbsp;– "frog"}} {{IPA-th|kòp|}}), Chanee (D123, {{lang-th|ชะนี&amp;nbsp;– gibbon}} {{IPA-th|tɕʰániː|}}), Berserah or Green Durian or Tuan Mek Hijau (D145 {{lang-th|ทุเรียนเขียว&amp;nbsp;– Green Durian}} {{IPA-th|tʰúriːən kʰǐow|}}), Kan Yao (D158, {{lang-th|ก้านยาว&amp;nbsp;– Long Stem}} {{IPA-th|kâːn jaːw|}}), Mon Thong (D159, {{lang-th|หมอนทอง&amp;nbsp;– Golden Pillow}} {{IPA-th|mɔ̌ːn tʰɔːŋ|}}), Kradum Thong ({{lang-th|กระดุมทอง&amp;nbsp;– Golden Button}} {{IPA-th|kràdum tʰɔːŋ|}}), and with no common name, D24 and D169. Each cultivar has a distinct taste and odour. More than 200 cultivars of ''D. zibethinus'' exist in [[Thailand]].

Mon thong is the most commercially sought after for its thick, full-bodied creamy and mild sweet tasting flesh with relatively moderate smell emitted and smaller seeds, while Chanee is the best in terms of its resistance to infection by ''[[Phytophthora palmivora]]''. Kan Yao is somewhat less common, but prized for its longer window of time when it is both sweet and odorless at the same time. Among all the cultivars in Thailand, five are currently in large-scale commercial cultivation: Chanee, Mon Thong, Kan Yao, Ruang, and Kradum.&lt;ref name=Pibul&gt;{{cite web |url=http://it.doa.go.th/durian/detail.php?id=164&amp;PHPSESSID=0a7dd4c12222a10cdbd00d70796cec00 |title=Durian Exporting Strategy, National Durian Database (กลยุทธการส่งออกทุเรียน) |publisher=Department of Agriculture, Thailand |accessdate=2010-07-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110818174921/http://it.doa.go.th/durian/detail.php?id=164&amp;PHPSESSID=0a7dd4c12222a10cdbd00d70796cec00 |archivedate=2011-08-18 |language=th |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are more than 100 registered cultivars since 1920's in [[Malaysia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~durian/info/vk_duri.htm |title=Comprehensive List of Durian Clones Registered by the Agriculture Department (of Malaysia) |publisher=Durian OnLine |accessdate=2006-03-05 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407225917/http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~durian/info/vk_duri.htm

An '''electric blanket''' is a [[blanket]] containing integrated [[Heating element|electrical heating]] wires. There are several types; underblankets, overblankets, throws and [[duvet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=11 best electric blankets |first=Kate |last=Hilpern |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/extras/indybest/house-garden/best-electric-blankets-2016-10035949.html |newspaper=The Independent |place=London, UK |date=15 September 2016 |accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An electric ''underblanket'' is placed above the mattress and below the bottom [[bed sheet]]. This is the most common type in the UK and [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] countries, where it is known by default as an "electric blanket"; in the U.S. and Canada, where it is less common, it is called an electric heated [[mattress pad]]. An electric ''overblanket'' is placed above the top bed sheet, and is the most common type in the U.S. and Canada, where it is called an "electric blanket".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.electricblanketinstitute.com/general-information/electric-blanket-vs-electric-mattress-pad.html |title=Heated mattress pad vs. heated blanket: Which is better??? |publisher=Electric Blanket Institute |accessdate=29 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric blankets usually have a control unit that adjusts the amount of [[heat]] the blanket produces.  Blankets for two-person beds often have separate controls for each side of the bed.  The electric blanket may be used to pre-heat the bed before use or to keep the occupant warm while in bed.

Some modern "low voltage" electric blankets have thin carbon fiber wires and work on 12 to 24 volts.

==Mechanism==
Much like heating pads, electric blankets use an insulated wire or heating element inserted into a fabric that heats when it is plugged in. The temperature control unit, located between the blanket and the electrical outlet, manages the amount of current entering into the heat elements in the blanket.

Some modern electric blankets use [[carbon fiber]] elements that are far less bulky and conspicuous than older heating wires. Carbon fiber is also used as the heating element in many high-end heated car seats. Blankets can be purchased with [[rheostats]] that regulate the heat by managing body heat and blanket temperatures, ensuring a comfortable experience.

==Safety==

=== Overheating ===
Newer electric blankets have a shutoff mechanism to prevent the blanket from overheating or catching fire. Older blankets (prior to about 2001) may not have a shut-off mechanism; users run the risk of overheating. Older blankets are considered fire hazards.

Some electric blankets work on a low voltage of 12 to 24 volts, including those which plug into ordinary household electrical outlets; in the US, such blankets are sold by Soft Heat, [[Serta (company)|Serta]], and [[Select Comfort]].&lt;ref&gt;In the US, as of October 2013, Perfect Fit Industries seems to be the only distributor of such blankets.

Old or damaged blankets concern fire safety officials internationally. The use of such blankets is of concern due to the combination of heat, electricity, the abundance of [[flammable]] [[bedding]] material, and a sleeping occupant. In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 5,000 [[structure fire|fires]] per year are caused by faulty electric blankets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Haslam|first=Carl |title=Electric Blanket Safety|url=http://www.fireservice.co.uk/safety/electric-blankets|publisher=UK Fire Service Resources Group|accessdate=2013-04-21|year=2011|quote=Electric blankets account for over 5000 fires a year in the home and you can prevent these by taking some simple steps.}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 99% are believed to have been caused by blankets 10 years or older.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fireservice.co.uk/safety/electric-blankets&lt;/ref&gt;

Electric blankets also present a burn risk to those who cannot feel pain or are unable to react to it. Individuals included in this group are small children, diabetics, and the elderly.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

As with any source of heat over the groin, use of electric blankets can reduce fertility in men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DePietro|first=MaryAnn|title=Are Electric Blankets Safe?|url=http://www.symptomfind.com/health/are-electric-blankets-safe/|publisher=SymptomFind.com|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer ===
No mechanism by which [[Extremely low frequency|ELF(Extremely low frequency)]]-[[Electromagnetic field|EMFs(Electromagnetic field)]] or radiofrequency radiation could cause cancer has been identified. Unlike [[Ionizing radiation|high-energy (ionizing) radiation]], EMFs in the non-ionizing part of the electromagnetic spectrum cannot damage [[DNA]] or cells directly. Some scientists have speculated that ELF-EMFs could cause cancer through other mechanisms, such as by reducing levels of the hormone [[melatonin]]. There is some evidence that melatonin may suppress the development of certain [[tumor | tumors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/electromagnetic-fields-fact-sheet#q3|title=Electromagnetic Fields and Cancer|website=National Cancer Institute|language=en|access-date=2018-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
A cartoon electrical blanket with its electrical temperature control acting as an anthropomorphic face named "Blanky" was portrayed in the 1987 film ''[[The Brave Little Toaster]]''.

'''Elmira''' is a community in the [[Canada|Canadian]] province of [[Prince Edward Island]], located in [[Lot 47, Prince Edward Island|Lot 47]] of [[Kings County, Prince Edward Island|Kings County]], northeast of [[Souris, Prince Edward Island|Souris]].

[[CBC Television]]'s [[CBCT (TV)|CBCT]] and [[CBC Radio One]]'s [[CBCT-FM]] maintain [[rebroadcaster]]s at Elmira to serve the portion of eastern Prince Edward Island which lies outside the broadcast range of those stations' main transmitters in [[Charlottetown]].

== Eastern Kings wind farm ==
Is a [[wind farm]] located at Souris-Elmira, PEI, Canada. It was completed January 22, 2007. It is owned and operated by PEI Energy Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.nawindpower.com/naw/e107_plugins/content/content_lt.php?content.420 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-02-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070322012610/http://www.nawindpower.com/naw/e107_plugins/content/content_lt.php?content.420# |archive-date=2007-03-22 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The wind farm consists of ten Vestas V90  [[wind turbine]]s 3 MW. Annual production will be 90-95 million kilowatt hours. The average house uses about 8,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually so the wind farm will produce enough electricity to power about 12,000 homes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.pe.ca/news/getrelease.php3?number=5111&lt;/ref&gt;
The Eastern Kings Wind Farm will supply about 7.5% of PEI’s electricity and displace 75,000 tonnes of [[greenhouse gas]]es per year.  The project capital cost was approximately $47 million.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.pe.ca/envengfor/index.php3?number=1012553&amp;lang=E

{{Fujita small}}
The '''Fujita scale''' ('''F-Scale'''), or '''Fujita–Pearson scale''' ('''FPP scale'''), is a scale for rating [[tornado]] intensity, based primarily on the damage tornadoes inflict on human-built structures and vegetation. The official Fujita scale category is determined by [[meteorologist]]s and [[civil engineer|engineers]] after a ground or aerial damage survey, or both; and depending on the circumstances, ground-swirl patterns ([[cycloid]]al marks), [[weather radar]] data, witness testimonies, media reports and damage imagery, as well as [[photogrammetry]] or [[videogrammetry]] if motion picture recording is available. The Fujita scale was replaced with the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]] (EF-Scale) in the [[United States]] in February 2007. In April 2013, [[Canada]] adopted the EF-Scale over the Fujita scale along with 31 "Specific Damage Indicators" used by [[Environment Canada]] (EC) in their ratings.&lt;ref name="NOAA: Fujita Tornado Damage Scale"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/f-scale.html |title=Fujita Tornado Damage Scale|website=spc.noaa.gov|accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tornadofacts.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tornadofacts.net/tornado-scale.php |title=Tornado Scale – The Enhanced Fujita Scale|website=tornadofacts.net|accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The scale was introduced in 1971 by [[Tetsuya Fujita]] of the [[University of Chicago]], in collaboration with  [[Allen Pearson]], head of the National Severe Storms Forecast Center/NSSFC (currently the [[Storm Prediction Center]]/SPC). The scale was updated in 1973, taking into account path length and width. In the United States, starting in 1973, tornadoes were rated soon after occurrence. The Fujita scale was applied retroactively to tornadoes reported between 1950 and 1972 in the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)]] National Tornado Database. Fujita rated tornadoes from 1916–1992{{clarify|date=April 2012}} and [[Tom Grazulis]] of The Tornado Project retroactively rated all known significant tornadoes (F2–F5 or causing a fatality) in the U.S. back to 1880.&lt;ref name="significant tornadoes"/&gt;
The Fujita scale was adopted in most areas outside of [[Great Britain]].{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

In 2007, the Fujita scale was updated, and the Enhanced Fujita Scale was introduced in the United States. The new scale more accurately matches wind speeds to the severity of damage caused by the tornado.

Though each damage level is associated with a wind speed, the Fujita scale is effectively a damage scale, and the wind speeds associated with the damage listed aren't rigorously verified. The Enhanced Fujita Scale was formulated due to research which suggested that the wind speeds required to inflict damage by intense tornadoes on the Fujita scale are greatly overestimated. A process of [[expert elicitation]] with top engineers and meteorologists resulted in the EF scale wind speeds, however, these are biased to United States construction practices. The EF scale also improved damage parameter descriptions.

== Derivation ==
[[File:Fujita scale technical.svg|right|300px]]

The original scale as derived by Fujita was a theoretical 13-level scale (F0–F12) designed to smoothly connect the [[Beaufort scale]] and the [[Mach number]] scale. F1 corresponds to the twelfth level of the Beaufort scale, and F12 corresponds to Mach number 1.0. F0 was placed at a position specifying no damage (approximately the eighth level of the Beaufort scale), in analogy to how the Beaufort's zeroth level specifies little to no wind. From these wind speed numbers, [[qualitative data|qualitative]] descriptions of damage were made for each category of the Fujita scale, and then these descriptions were used to classify tornadoes.&lt;ref name="enhancedIntro"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/efscale/ |title=Storm Prediction Center|website=spc.noaa.gov|accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The diagram on the right illustrates the relationship between the Beaufort, Fujita, and Mach number scales.

At the time Fujita derived the scale, little information was available on damage caused by wind, so the original scale presented little more than educated guesses at [[wind speed]] ranges for specific tiers of damage. Fujita intended that only F0–F5 be used in practice, as this covered all possible levels of damage to frame homes as well as the expected estimated bounds of wind speeds. He did, however, add a description for F6, which he phrased as "inconceivable tornado", to allow for wind speeds exceeding F5 and for possible future advancements in damage analysis which might show it.&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"/&gt;

Furthermore, the original wind speed numbers have since been found to be higher than the actual wind speeds required to incur the damage described at each category. The error manifests itself to an increasing degree as the category increases, especially in the range of F3 through F5. NOAA notes that "...&amp;nbsp;precise wind speed numbers are actually guesses and have never been scientifically verified. Different wind speeds may cause similar-looking damage from place to place—even from building to building. Without a thorough engineering analysis of tornado damage in any event, the actual wind speeds needed to cause that damage are unknown."&lt;ref name="SPC FAQ"&gt;[http://www.spc.noaa.gov/faq/tornado/ Tornado FAQ]. [http://www.spc.noaa.gov Storm Prediction Center]. Site accessed June 27, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Enhanced Fujita Scale has been created using better wind estimates by engineers and meteorologists.

Some sources add level F+", meaning a tornado with winds below 39 mph; on rare occasions tornadoes this weak are observed covering a wide range of path widths and lengths.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

== Parameters ==
The five categories are listed here, in order of increasing intensity.
* The rating of any given tornado is of the most severe damage to any well-built frame home or comparable level of damage from engineering analysis of other damage.
* Since the Fujita scale is based on the severity of damage resulting from high winds, an F6 or an F7 tornado is a theoretical construct. Structural damage cannot exceed total destruction, which constitutes an F5. A tornado with wind speeds greater than {{convert|319|mph}} is theoretically possible, and the [[1999 Bridge Creek–Moore tornado|1999 Bridge Creek-Moore Tornado]] may have been such an event. However, no such wind speed has ever been recorded and that measurement was not near ground level.

For purposes such as [[tornado climatology]] studies, Fujita scale ratings may be grouped into classes.&lt;ref name="significant tornadoes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Grazulis|first=Thomas P.|authorlink= Thomas P.

{{main article|Enhanced Fujita scale}}

The Fujita scale, introduced in 1971 as a means to differentiate tornado intensity and path area, assigned wind speeds to damage that were, at best, educated guesses.&lt;ref name ="Fujita scale"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fujita| first = Tetsuya Theodore| authorlink = T.T. Fujita| title = Proposed characterization of tornadoes and hurricanes by area and intensity| publisher = University of Chicago| year = 1971| location = Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fujita and others recognized this immediately and intensive engineering analysis was conducted through the rest of the 1970s. This research, as well as subsequent research, showed that tornado wind speeds required to inflict the described damage were actually much lower than the F-scale indicated, particularly for the upper categories. Also, although the scale gave general descriptions for the type of damage a tornado could cause, it gave little leeway for strength of construction and other factors that might cause a building to receive higher damage at lower wind speeds. Fujita tried to address these problems somewhat in 1992 with the Modified Fujita Scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.noaa.gov/efscale/|title=NOAA's NWS Storm Prediction Center|first=Storm Prediction|last=Center|website=www.spc.noaa.gov|accessdate=May 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by then he was semi-retired and the National Weather Service was not in a position for the undertaking of updating to an entirely new scale, so it went largely unenacted.&lt;ref name ="Fujita Memoirs"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fujita| first = Tetsuya Theodore| authorlink = Ted Fujita| title = Memoirs of an Effort to Unlock the Mystery of Severe Storms| publisher = University of Chicago| year = 1992| location = Chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, on February 1, 2007,&lt;ref name="NOAA: Fujita Tornado Damage Scale"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tornadofacts.net"/&gt; the Fujita scale was decommissioned in favor of what these scientists believe is a more accurate Enhanced Fujita Scale, which replaces it. The meteorologists and engineers who designed the EF Scale believe it an improvement on the F-scale on many counts—it accounts for different degrees of damage that occur with different types of structures, both man-made and natural. The expanded and refined damage indicators and degrees of damage standardize what was somewhat ambiguous. It also is thought to provide a much better estimate for wind speeds, and sets no upper limit on the wind speeds for the strongest level, EF5. Several countries{{which|date=April 2014}} continue to use the original Fujita Scale. [[Environment Canada]] has begun using the Enhanced Fujita scale in Canada as of April 18, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/storm_watch_stories3&amp;stormfile=Assessing_tornado_damage__EF-scale_vs._F-scale_19_04_2013?ref=ccbox_homepage_topstories Assessing tornado damage: EF-scale vs. F-scale]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427003723/http://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/storm_watch_stories3%26stormfile%3DAssessing_tornado_damage__EF-scale_vs._F-scale_19_04_2013?ref=ccbox_homepage_topstories |date=April 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11880">The '''Gaza electricity crisis''' is an ongoing and growing [[electricity crisis]] faced by nearly two million citizens of the [[Gaza Strip]], with regular power supply being provided only for a few hours a day on a [[rolling blackout]] schedule. Some Gazans use private [[electric generator]]s, [[solar panel]]s and [[uninterruptible power supply]] units to consume power when regular power is not available.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_gaza_electricity_crisis_2010_05_17.pdf Gaza’s Electricity Crisis: The Impact of Electricity Cuts on the Humanitarian Situation], UN OCHA, May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Gaza-infrastructure-nearing-collapse-479394 ‘Gaza Infrastructure Nearing Collapse’], JPost, January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinians-gaza-solar-idUSKCN0WB1OC Seeing no end to power crisis, Gazans turn to the sun], Reuters, March 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/en/originals/2016/03/gaza-solar-energy-electricity-crisis.html Gaza’s electricity crisis sheds light on gap between social classes], al-Monitor, March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis is a result of the tensions between [[Hamas]], who rules Gaza, and the [[Palestinian Authority]]/[[Fatah]], who rules the [[West Bank]] over custom tax revenue, funding of Gaza, and political authority. 

== Power sources==
As of 2017, Gaza's normal energy needs are estimated to be approximately 400–600 [[megawatts]] for full 24-hour supply to all residents, which are normally supplied by a diesel power plant in Gaza with has a nominal rating of 60–140&amp;nbsp;MW (figures vary due to degree of operation and damage to the plant) which is reliant on fuel imports,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/183470 Gaza's Only Power Plant Knocked Out], Arutz7, July 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-israel-turkey-eager-to-rebuild-gaza-1001136597 Israel, Turkey eager to rebuild Gaza], Globes English, June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; an additional 125&amp;nbsp;MW imported from [[Israel]] via 10 power lines, and 27&amp;nbsp;MW of power imported from [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-gaza-electricity-idUSKBN17T151|title=Palestinian Authority halts payments for Israeli electricity to Gaza: Israel|author=|date=27 April 2017|publisher=|access-date=15 June 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Hamas-blames-PA-for-power-plant-shutdown-488201|title=Hamas blames Abbas for Gaza power plant shutdown|author=|date=|website=JPost.com|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in normal conditions, the current rated supply of Gaza is inadequate to meet growing needs, and the crisis has led to further closure and reductions to each of these power sources.&lt;ref name="OHCA201403"&gt;[https://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_electricity_factsheet_march_2014_english.pdf The humanitarian impact of Gaza’s electricity and fuel crisis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322142754/https://www.ochaopt.org/documents/ocha_opt_electricity_factsheet_march_2014_english.pdf |date=2017-03-22 }}, UN OCHA, March 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/middle-east-news/palestinians/.premium-1.763586 With Only Three Hours of Electricity a Day, Gaza Is 'On Verge of Explosion'], Ha'aretz, January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
Prior to June 2013, fuel for the power plant was smuggled from Egypt, where fuel at the time was highly subsidized. Following measures taken by the Egyptians against the [[Gaza Strip smuggling tunnels]], these cheap imports were halted and the power plant began operating in a partial capacity with fuel supplied via Israel, which charges a high{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2017}} import duty.&lt;ref name="OHCA201403"/&gt;
Even though Gaza is ruled by Hamas, they are currently dependent on the [[Palestinian Authority]] (PA) to help provide electricity – the import duties on Gaza's fuel purchases via Israel are passed to the PA, making Hamas reliant on the PA for funding, and the PA, not Hamas, pays the bill to Israel and Egypt for the electricity they provide to Gaza. As of 2017, the Palestine Authority has ceased making some of the payments.&lt;ref name="ceased payment"&gt;{{citation|date=April 27, 2017|title=Why Abbas asked Israel to cut power to Gaza|publisher=[[BBC News]]|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-39730791}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli human rights group [[B'Tselem]] has documented how common people cope in Gaza with electricity being provided on a rolling blackout schedule of a few hours a day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/20170220_winter_without_electricity|title=Winter 2017: Living without electricity just an hour and a half away from Tel Aviv|author=|date=|website=www.BTselem.org|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has further said that Israel should take responsibility for the crisis, a responsibility Israel denies, saying that Hamas should allocate funds for electricity rather than personal gain and military expenditure on equipment and [[Palestinian tunnel warfare in the Gaza Strip|military tunnels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btselem.org/gaza_strip/20170117_electricity_crisis|title=Israel cannot shirk its responsibility for Gaza’s electricity crisis|author=|date=|website=www.BTselem.org|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, Gaza's sole power plant ran out of fuel. Hamas blamed the Palestinian Authority for levying taxes on the fuel (levied by Israel as per [[Protocol on Economic Relations]], and passed to the PA) while not passing tax revenue back to Gaza. The PA claims that the Hamas officials in Gaza are simply incapable of running the plant efficiently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/17/middleeast/palestinians-gaza-power-plant-crisis/index.html|title=Gaza faces crisis as power plant runs out of fuel|first=Oren Liebermann]] and Talal Abu Rahma|last=CNN|date=17 April 2017|website=CNN|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From April 2017, power supply from Egypt is reportedly not operational.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20170425-egyptian-power-lines-to-gaza-down/ Egyptian power lines to Gaza down], ''Middle East Monitor'', April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/15/israel-and-gaza-an-electricity-dispute-makes-a-tense-situation-worse.html|title=Israel and Gaza: An electricity dispute makes a tense situation worse|first=Jason|last=Gewirtz|date=15 May 2017|website=CNBC.com|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/egypt-may-stop-providing-electricity-to-gaza-strip-amid-pa-hamas-feud/ Egypt shuts non-functioning power lines to Gaza for maintenance – report], ''Times of Israel'', Dov Lieber, 12 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Asharq Al-Awsat]] Egypt offered, in June 2017, to supply Gaza with electricity in exchange for the extradition of 17 wanted terrorists and other security demands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-said-to-offer-hamas-electricity-in-exchange-for-17-wanted-men/ Egypt said to offer Hamas electricity in exchange for 17 wanted men], ''Times of Israel'', 13 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Egypt-offers-Gaza-electricity-in-exchange-for-crackdown-on-security-at-border-496693|title=Egypt offers Gaza electricity in exchange for crackdown on security at border|author=|date=|website=JPost.com|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the PA's refusal to pay for electricity in Gaza and instructions to reduce supply, Israel further reduced supply to Gaza in May and June 2017, saying this was an internal Palestinian matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Israel-reduces-Gaza-electricity-after-PA-refuses-to-pay-493927|title=Israel reduces Gaza electricity after PA refuses to pay|author=|date=|website=JPost.com|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/12/israel-cuts-gaza-electricity-palestinian-president-says-will/ Israel cuts Gaza electricity after Palestinian president says he will no longer pay the bill for Hamas], ''Telegraph'', 12 June&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-power-idUSKBN1931XK|title=Israel reduces power supply to Gaza, as Abbas pressures Hamas|author=|date=12 June 2017|publisher=|access-date=15 June 2017|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli military and the UN have warned that the electricity crisis and resulting humanitarian crisis may lead Gaza to initiate military hostilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.795201 Gaza Power Cuts Boost Tension With Israel], Ha'aretz, 12 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/International/UN-Fatah-Hamas-tug-of-war-could-lead-to-fresh-conflict-in-Gaza-494077|title=UN: Fatah-Hamas ‘tug-of-war’ could lead to fresh conflict in Gaza|author=|date=|website=JPost.com|access-date=15 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hamas has labelled Israel's decision as "dangerous and catastrophic", threatening to renew violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/hamas-cutting-electricity-gaza-catastrophic-47984213 Hamas: Cutting electricity to Gaza would be 'catastrophic'], ABC News (AP Newswire), 12 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 20th of June 2017, reports emerged that Egypt and Hamas reached an understanding according to which Egypt would supply 500 tons of diesel fuel daily. This supply wouldn't face Israeli custom duty rates (passed to the PA), as stipulated by the [[Protocol on Economic Relations|Paris Protocol]], potentially placing Gaza in a separate economic bloc from Israel and the PA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/egypt-to-ease-gaza-electricity-crisis-with-emergency-fuel-supplies/ Egypt said to ease Gaza power crisis with emergency fuel supply], 20 June 2017, Times of Israel&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2017, sewage was directed untreated to the sea due to the lack of electricity, severely polluting Gaza's beaches. As a result the number of beach goers plummeted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2017/07/gaza-municipality-rental-prices-beach-resorts.html Gaza's beaches unseasonably empty], Al-Monitor, Rasha Abou Jalal, 27 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jul/31/children-swim-sewage-floods-gaza-beach, 'The worst it's been': children continue to swim as raw sewage floods Gaza beach], Guardian, Peter Beaumont, 31 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli beach of [[Zikim]] was closed as well due to the sewage pollution from Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Gaza-sewage-crises-Israeli-Beach-closed-as-a-new-pipeline-is-considered-498897 Gaza Sewage Forces Shutdown of Israeli Beach], JPost, Sharon Udasin and Tova Lazaroff, 6 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Gazan sewage was also pumped into Israel via Nahal Hanoun from [[Beit Hanoun]] and [[Beit Lahia]] polluting the Israeli coastal groundwater [[aquifer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4991114,00.html Gaza sewage water polluting Israeli groundwater], YNET, Matan Tzuri, 19 July 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, the United Nations human rights office called Israel, the State of Palestinian and Hamas authorities to resolve the conflict, saying ""We are deeply concerned about the steady deterioration in the humanitarian conditions and the protection of human rights in Gaza", and that the supply of electricity for less than four a hours a day since April "has a grave impact on the provision of essential health, water and sanitation services".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-gaza-idUSKBN1AR1E3 U.N. urges end to Gaza crisis in punishing summer heat], Reuters, 11 August 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

| Barring
| The process of slowly turning the turbine-generator shaft to prevent bowing while it is still hot after shutdown
Typically, barring is achieved using turning gear, a small electric motor and gearbox connected to the generator shaft.  Early in the history of power plants, barring was done by operators turning the shaft with a bar.  This is still done if electric barring is not available, as the consequences of bowing a shaft are enormous.
| Turning gear
|-
| Biomass
| Living or recently dead material such as plant matter, used as either fuel or industrial production as biofuel
It is a renewable resource obtained from several different plants, for example wood waste, sugar cane, corn, hemp and others. || Biofuel
|-
| Black start || Starting a unit without external power supply from the electricity network

In the context of an electricity market, that capability of completing a black start is known as system restart ancillary service (SRAS).

Black start capability is typically provided by a local gas turbine, generating sufficient electrical power to drive pumps and fans on only one unit in the power station until it comes online.  Once that unit is up, it can provide auxiliary power to the others at the same location, or feed into the grid again.
A black start does not require a synchronising step as the network is down, but subsequent generators coming online will need to synchronise.

| Blade 
| In a reaction turbine, the blade is the main moving part attached to the turbine shaft 
It extracts the pressure and heat energy from the steam and converts it to rotating mechanical energy by turning the shaft.

| Bled steam
| Steam extracted from the turbine to provide heat to the feedwater heaters
Note that the deaerator is also a feedwater heater – it also receives bled steam from the turbine, but the steam is mixed with and heats the water instead of transferring heat through a shell and tube heat exchanger.

| Gasification
| A chemical process that converts a solid fuel into gases.

Where the gasification is carried out immediately prior to combustion in a combined cycle gas turbine, this configuration is known as IGCC.  Gasification of coal may also be carried out underground, as in UCG.  Finally, some gasification plants target synthetic oils as the end products, in gas to liquid.

| Maximum capacity&lt;br&gt;
One of three modes describing the configuration of the unit around full load&lt;br&gt;
Usually achieved by taking the HP heaters out of service, so that the bled steam that normally goes to these heaters now passes through the turbine.  This increases the capacity of the turbine due to the increased steam flow, but reduces the efficiency as the boiler must fire much harder due to the colder incoming water. Also known as overload operation.

|Reaction turbine
|Design of a Turbine where energy is extracted from the steam predominantly by a change in pressure of the steam&lt;br /&gt;
The vanes (stationary components fixed to the casing) direct the steam toward the blades (rotating components attached to the rotor) which produce a force on the rotor in a way similar to an aeroplane wing. The shape of the blade causes a difference in steam from one side of the blade to the other, causing the rotor to turn.

'''Ground propulsion''' is any mechanism for [[propulsion|propelling]] solid bodies along the ground, usually for the purposes of [[transportation]]. The propulsion system often consists of a combination of an [[engine|engine or motor]], a [[gearbox]] and [[wheel and axle]]s (or [[caterpillar track]]s) in standard applications.

The primary and most natural type of propulsion is the use of muscle power. The invention of the wheel allowed for the development of [[vehicle]]s like [[Cart]]s and [[Wagon]]s that make more efficient use of muscle power, allowing larger loads to be transported. Vehicles drawn by humans and domesticated animals are not economically as important as they once were, but they still exist. Examples of human-powered vehicles are [[rickshaw]]s and [[cycle rickshaw]]s.

The development of the [[steam engine]] and [[internal combustion engine]] allowed for the development of [[rail vehicle]]s and [[motor vehicle]]s, all of which have some form of a [[powertrain]]. The [[electric motor]] allowed for quieter vehicles with lower emissions, and frequently higher [[engine efficiency]].

Some less commonly used or experimental engines are:
*[[Turbine]]s
*[[Stirling engine]]s
*[[Fuel cell]]s

'''Hawthorne Nevada Airlines Flight 708''' was a domestic non-scheduled passenger flight between [[Hawthorne Industrial Airport]], [[Nevada]] (HTH) and [[Bob Hope Airport|Hollywood-Burbank Airport]], [[California]] (BUR/KBUR), that crashed into the tallest mountain in the [[contiguous United States]], [[Mount Whitney]], near [[Lone Pine, California|Lone Pine]], on February 18, 1969, killing all 35 passengers and crew on board.

==History of flight==
The aircraft, a [[Douglas DC-3]], was operating on a [[visual flight rules]] plan. It departed at 3:50 A.M. [[Pacific Time Zone|PST]] and last contact was made at 4:06 A.M. when the flight spoke with the Tonopah Flight Service Station. One hour later, at 5:10 A.M., the plane hit a sheer cliff face on the east side of [[Mount Whitney]] at 11,770 feet (3,558 m). The main body of the wreckage then slid down the cliff and stopped some 500 feet (152 m) back from the cliff, where it caught fire. All 32 passengers and all three crew members were killed.

==Search and rescue operation==
Extensive searches from air and ground were launched after the aircraft went missing, but snow, low clouds, and mountainous terrain hampered the search. The aircraft was finally located on August 8, 1969. It is not thought that the delay had any impact on the lack of survivors as it is thought that all on board died on impact.

==Investigation==
The [[National Transportation Safety Board]] launched an extensive investigation upon the location of the wreckage. Its conclusions were as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The accident was caused by the deviation from the prescribed route of flight, as authorized in the company's [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]]-approved operations specifications, resulting in the aircraft being operated under IFR weather conditions, in high mountainous terrain, in an area where there was a lack of radio navigation aids. The weather was also a contributing factor.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*''[[Hemileia vastatrix]]'' (Coffee rust); Primary host is coffee plant;  Unknown alternate host
*''[[Puccinia graminis]]'' (Stem rust of wheat and Kentucky bluegrass);  Primary hosts include: Kentucky bluegrass, barley, and wheat; Common barberry is the alternate host.
*''[[Puccinia coronata]]'' (Crown Rust of Oats and Ryegrass); Oats are the primary host; ''[[Rhamnus (genus)|Rhamnus]]'' spp. (Buckthorn) is alternate host.
*''[[Phakopsora meibomiae]]'' and ''[[Phakopsora pachyrhizi|P. pachyrhizi]]'' (Soybean Rust); Primary host is soybean and various legumes.  Unknown alternate host.

[[File:Northeim 2005-09-17 Fachwerk-05.jpg|thumb|upright|A German carpenter (Zimmerer) hewing a log into a beam. Note the blue chalk line snapped on the log to which the hewer works.]]
[[File:Strasjo kapell wood surface.jpg|thumb| In some medieval Scandinavian buildings a special method of hewing which produces a herringbone pattern on the timbers has been used (Swedish: ''Slinthuggning'', Norwegian: ''Sprettejling''). This is a modern reconstruction in Stråsjö Chapel in [[Hälsingland]], Sweden.]]
[[File:Strasjo kapell view.jpg|thumb|Stråsjö Chapel]]

In [[woodworking]], '''hewing''' is the process of converting a [[trunk (botany)|log]] from its rounded natural form into  [[lumber]] (timber) with more or less flat surfaces using primarily an [[axe]]. It is an ancient method, and before the advent of the industrial-era type of [[sawmill]]s, it was a standard way of squaring up wooden [[beam (structure)|beams]] for [[timber framing]]. Today it is still used occasionally for that purpose by anyone who has logs, needs beams, and cannot or would prefer not to pay for finished lumber. Thus [[homesteading|homesteaders]] on frugal budgets, for example, may hew their own lumber rather than buy it.

==Definitions==
''Hew'' is a general term meaning to strike or blow with a tool such as an axe or sword; to chop or gash, and is used in warfare, stone and wood cutting, and coal and salt mining in this sense.&lt;ref&gt;"Hew v." def. 2. ''Oxford English Dictionary'', 2nd ed. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Joseph. "Hew" ''The English dialect dictionary, being the complete vocabulary of all dialect words still in use, or known to have been in use during the last two hundred years'';. London etc.: H. Frowde;, 18981905. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Hewing wood is to shape the wood with a sharp instrument such as an axe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hewing |title=Hew &amp;#124; Definition of hew by Merriam-Webster |publisher=Merriam-webster.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically flattening one or more sides of a log.

==Methods==
As an ancient method of timber ''conversion'', different methods of each step in hewing have developed in history.

===Prepare log===
After a tree is selected and [[Felling|felled]], hewing can take place where the log landed or be [[Skidder|skidded]] or twitched (skidded with a horse or oxen) out of the woods to a work site. The log is placed across two other smaller logs near the ground or up on trestles about waist height; stabilized either by notching the support logs, or using a '[[Dog (engineering)#log dog or timber dog|timber dog]]' (also called a log dog,&lt;ref&gt;Kauffman, Henry J.. American axes: a survey of their development and their makers. Morgantown, PA: Masthof Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; a long bar of iron with a tooth on either end that jams into the logs and prevents movement). 
The hewer measures and locates the timber within the log on both ends and marks lines along the length of a log, usually with a [[chalk line]].

===Scoring===
The next step is to chop notches every foot or two, almost as deep as the marked line using a chopping or scoring axe, called scoring. At least three methods are used in scoring. 1) Standing on the log and swinging an axe to chop the score; 2) In Germany a method of two carpenters standing on the ground with the log on trestles and swinging downward to slice the scores. (see video in link below); 3) A chainsaw is used to notch the log, the sections created by the notching are then split off using a felling axe.

===Joggling or juggling===
The pieces of wood between the notches are knocked off with an axe, this process called juggling&lt;ref&gt;McRaven, Charles. The classic hewn-log house: a step-by-step guide to building and restoration. North Adams, MA: Storey Pub., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dialect Notes: The American Dialect Society. Vol. 2. 1900. 237. https://books.google.com/books?id=iEMOAAAAYAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; or joggling.&lt;ref&gt;McGrail, Seán.  Woodworking techniques before A.D. 1500: papers presented to a symposium at Greenwich in September, 1980, together with edited discussion. B.A.R. 1982. 389. books.google.com/books?id=RJnfAAAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt; This results in a rough surface pared down just shy of the marked line. Scoring and juggling remove a fair amount of wood, make hewing easier and prevent long shreds of wood being torn off.

===Hewing===
Hewing is the last step in this whole process, which is also collectively referred to as hewing. Hewing is done on the logs sides with a [[broadaxe]]. Hewing occurs from the bottom of the stem upwards towards what was the top of the standing tree, reducing the tendency of the broken fibers to migrate inwards towards the eventual beam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/fspubs/99232823/page23.htm |title=An Ax to Grind: A Practical Ax Manual, 9923-2823-MTDC, About the Author |publisher=Fhwa.dot.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is widely published that an [[adze]] was used to hew the top surface of a log flat in the same manner as an axe is used on the sides of a log. However, physical evidence of looking at the marks left by the hewing tools in historic buildings, called [[Use-wear analysis|tracology]], are swung in an arc and thus made by an axe, not an adz. Shipbuilders frequently used adzes in shaping ship timbers, the choice of tool being made by the position of the surface being hewn, the sides best hewn with an axe and the face best hewn with an adze. Historic illustrations do show some Asian carpenters hewing building timbers with an adz. Further smoothing can then be done using a [[hand plane]], [[drawknife]], [[Japanese plane|yariganna]] (an ancient Japanese cutting tool) or any other established or improvised means.

Some 19th-century timber buildings in the U.S. have hewn long timbers in the same framing with vertically sawn and the later technology of circular sawn timbers. The reason for this is the long timbers were easier to hew with an axe than to take to a sawmill due to poor transportation routes.

Hewn railroad ties are known as [[axe ties]] and were made by a ''tiehacker''.&lt;ref&gt;Marples, Geoff. "The Tiehack", part 1.. ''British Columbia Forest History Newsletter''. No. 60. August 2000. Victoria, B. C., Forest History Association of British Columbia. p. 1-4. print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern uses===
Although still used in niche modern building, salvaged hand-hewn beams are now commonly recycled as architectural details popular in new construction and renovation of homes.  They are also popular as decor in commercial and restaurant spaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.longleaflumber.com/about-hand-hewn-beams/ |title=About Hand-Hewn Beams |publisher=Longleaf Lumber Inc. |date= |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydroxyapatite''', also called '''hydroxylapatite''' ('''HA'''), is a naturally occurring [[mineral]] form of calcium [[apatite]] with the formula Ca&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(OH), but it is usually written Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to denote that the crystal unit cell comprises two entities.  Hydroxyapatite is the [[hydroxyl]] [[Endmember (mineralogy)|endmember]] of the complex [[apatite|apatite group]]. The OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; [[ion]] can be replaced by [[fluorine|fluoride]], [[chlorine|chloride]] or [[carbonate]], producing [[fluorapatite]] or [[chlorapatite]]. It crystallizes in the [[hexagonal (crystal system)|hexagonal]] [[crystal system]]. Pure hydroxyapatite powder is white. Naturally occurring apatites can, however, also have brown, yellow, or green colorations, comparable to the discolorations of [[dental fluorosis]].

Up to 50% by volume and 70% by weight of [[human bone]] is a modified form of hydroxyapatite, known as [[bone mineral]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Carbonated calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite is the main mineral of which [[dental enamel]] and [[dentin]] are composed.  Hydroxyapatite crystals are also found in the small calcifications, within the [[pineal gland]] and other structures, known as [[corpora arenacea]] or 'brain sand'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1699-0463.1958.tb01060.x|title=A Microradiographic and X-Ray Crystallographic Study of Calcium in the Pineal Body and in Intracranial Tumours|journal=Acta Pathologica Microbiologica Scandinavica|volume=44|issue=2|pages=113–119|year=2009|last1=Angervall|first1=Lennart|last2=Berger|first2=Sven|last3=Röckert|first3=Hans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical synthesis==
Hydroxyapatite can be synthesized via several methods, such as wet chemical deposition, biomimetic deposition, [[sol-gel]] route  (wet-chemical precipitation) or electrodeposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 20803440| year = 2004| author1 = Ferraz| first1 = M. P.| title = Hydroxyapatite nanoparticles: A review of preparation methodologies| journal = Journal of applied biomaterials &amp; biomechanics : JABB| volume = 2| issue = 2| pages = 74–80| last2 = Monteiro| first2 = F. J.| last3 = Manuel| first3 = C. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yagai and Aoki proposed the hydroxyapatite nanocrystal suspension can be prepared by a wet chemical precipitation reaction following the reaction equation below:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1023/A:1008918110156 |pmid=15348004| year = 2000|title=Morphological study of hydroxyapatite nanocrystal suspension| last1 = Bouyer | first1 = E.| journal = Journal of Materials Science: Materials in Medicine| volume = 11| issue = 8| pages = 523–31| last2 = Gitzhofer | first2 = F.| last3 = Boulos | first3 = M. I.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

10 Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; → Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 18 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Several studies have shown that hydroxyapatite synthesis via the wet-chemical route can be improved by high-power ultrasound. The ultrasonically assisted synthesis (sono-synthesis) of hydroxyapatite is a successful technique for the production of nanostructured hydroxyapatite to high quality standards. The ultrasonic route allows the production of nano-crystalline hydroxyapatite as well as modified particles, e.g. core-shell nanospheres and composites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hielscher.com/sono-synthesis-of-nano-hydroxyapatite.htm Sono-Synthesis of Nano-Hydroxyapatite]. hielscher.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calcium deficient hydroxyapatite==
Calcium deficient (non-stochiometric) hydroxyapatite, Ca&lt;sub&gt;10−x&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6−x&lt;/sub&gt;(HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2−x&lt;/sub&gt; (where x is between 0 and 1) has a Ca/P ratio between 1.67 and 1.5.  The Ca/P ratio is often used in the discussion of calcium phosphate phases.&lt;ref name="Bioactive"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Rey, C.|author2=Combes, C.|author3=Drouet, C.|author4=Grossin, D.|year= 2011 |chapter= 1.111 – Bioactive Ceramics: Physical Chemistry|chapterurl=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780080552941000234 |editor1-last=Ducheyne  |editor1-first=Paul |title=Comprehensive Biomaterials|volume=1|publisher=Elsevier |publication-date=2011|pages=187–281 |doi=10.1016/B978-0-08-055294-1.00178-1 |isbn=978-0-08-055294-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stoichiometric apatite Ca&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a Ca/P ratio of 10:6 normally expressed as 1.67. The non-stoichiometric phases have the hydroxyapatite structure with cation vacancies (Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) and anion (OH&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) vacancies. The sites occupied solely by phosphate anions in stochiometric hydroxyapatite, are occupied by phosphate or hydrogen phosphate, HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;, anions.&lt;ref name="Bioactive" /&gt; 
Preparation of these calcium deficient phases can be prepared by precipitation from a mixture of [[calcium nitrate]] and [[diammonium phosphate]] with the desired Ca/P ratio, for example to make a sample with a Ca/P ratio of 1.6:&lt;ref name = ChampionI&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0142-9612(01)00218-6| pmid = 11791909| title = Calcium phosphate apatites with variable Ca/P atomic ratio I.

==Biological function==
[[File:Hydroxyapatite3.png|thumbnail|right|A 3D visualization of half of a hydroxyapatite unit cell, from x-ray crystallography]]
The clubbing appendages of the ''[[Odontodactylus scyllarus]]'' (peacock mantis shrimp) are made of an extremely dense form of the mineral which has a higher specific strength and toughness than any synthetic composite material; these properties have led to its investigation for potential synthesis and engineering use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1218764 |pmid=22679090|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225280684_The_stomatopod_dactyl_club_a_formidable_damage-tolerant_biological_hammer| title = The Stomatopod Dactyl Club: A Formidable Damage-Tolerant Biological Hammer| journal = Science| volume = 336| issue = 6086| pages = 1275–80| year = 2012| last1 = Weaver | first1 = J.

A periodic layer underneath the impact layer composed of hydroxyapatite with lower calcium and phosphorus content (thus resulting in a much lower modulus) inhibits crack growth by forcing new cracks to change directions. This periodic layer also reduces the energy transferred across both layers due to the large difference in modulus, even reflecting some of the incident energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.1222642|pmid=22679085| title = Small but Extremely Tough| journal = Science| volume = 336| issue = 6086| pages = 1237–8| year = 2012| last1 = Tanner | first1 = K.

Hydroxyapatite is present in [[bone]] and [[teeth]]; bone is made primarily of HA crystals interspersed in a [[collagen]] matrix --  65 to 70% of the mass of bone is HA.  Similarly HA is 70 to 80% of the mass of [[dentin]] and [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] in teeth.  In enamel, the matrix for HA is formed by [[amelogenin]]s and [[enamelin]]s instead of collagen.&lt;ref name=statpearls2018&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Habibah |first1=TU |last2=Salisbury |first2=HG |title=Biomaterials, Hydroxyapatite |date=January 2018 |pmid=30020686 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK513314/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydroxylapatite deposits in tendons around joints results in the medical condition [[calcific tendinitis]].&lt;ref name=Car2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carcia|first1=CR|last2=Scibek|first2=JS|title=Causation and management of calcific tendonitis and periarthritis.|journal=Current Opinion in Rheumatology|date=March 2013|volume=25|issue=2|pages=204–9|pmid=23370373|doi=10.1097/bor.0b013e32835d4e85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the native dissolution rate of hydroxyapatite in-vivo, around 10 wt% per year, is significantly lower than the growth rate of newly formed bone tissue, towards its use as bone replacement materials measures are often sought to enhance its solubility rate and thus promote better bioactivity &lt;ref name = “SDHA”&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Zhu | first1= H.| last2=et al. | title= Nanostructural insights into the dissolution behavior of Sr-doped hydroxyapatite| journal = Journal of the European Ceramic Society | year=2018 | volume=38| issue=16| pages= 5554-5562|doi= 10.1016/j.jeurceramsoc.2018.07.056| url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0955221918304837 | }} &lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Supplement ===
Microcrystalline hydroxyapatite (MH) is marketed as a "bone-building" supplement with superior absorption in comparison to calcium.&lt;ref name=Straub2007/&gt; It is a second-generation calcium supplement derived from bovine bone.&lt;ref name=Straub2007&gt;{{cite journal|author = Straub, D.A.|year = 2007|title = Calcium Supplementation in Clinical Practice: A Review of Forms, Doses, and Indications |journal = NCP- Nutrition in Clinical Practice|volume = 22|issue = 3|pages = 286–96 |doi = 10.1177/0115426507022003286|pmid = 17507729 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, bone meal calcium supplements were found to be contaminated with heavy metals,&lt;ref name=Straub2007/&gt; and although the manufacturers claim their MH is free from contaminants, people are advised to avoid it because its effect in the body has not been well-tested.&lt;ref name=Straub2007/&gt;

==Chromatography==
The mechanism of hydroxyapatite (HA) [[chromatography]] is complicated and has been described as "mixed-mode" ion exchange.  It involves nonspecific interactions between  positively charged calcium ions and negatively charged phosphate ions on the stationary phase HA resin with protein negatively charged carboxyl groups and positively charged amino groups.  It may be difficult to predict the effectiveness of HA chromatography based on physical and chemical properties of the desired protein to be purified.  For elution, a buffer with increasing phosphate concentration is typically used for application.

==Use in archaeology==
In [[archaeology]], hydroxyapatite from [[faunal assemblage|human and animal remains]] can be analysed to reconstruct ancient [[Diet (nutrition)|diets]], migrations and palaeoclimate. The mineral fractions of bone and teeth act as a reservoir of [[Micronutrients|trace elements]], including carbon, oxygen and strontium. Stable isotope analysis of human and faunal hydroxyapatite can be used to indicate whether a diet was predominantly terrestrial or marine in nature (carbon, strontium);&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/425366a|pmid=14508478|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/evolution/staff/richards/pdf/Richards_et_alNature2003.pdf| title = Archaeology: Sharp shift in diet at onset of Neolithic| journal = Nature| volume = 425| issue = 6956| pages = 366| year = 2003| last1 = Richards | first1 = M.

[[File:Balancer with wine 3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Balancing cart, a simple robotics system 1976. The cart contains a [[servo system]] which monitors the angle of the rod and moves the cart back and forth to keep it upright.]]

An '''inverted pendulum''' is a [[pendulum]] that has its [[center of mass]] above its [[Lever|pivot]] point.  It is [[unstable equilibrium|unstable]] and without additional help will fall over. It can be suspended stably in this inverted position by using a [[control system]] to monitor the angle of the pole and move the pivot point horizontally back under the center of mass when it starts to fall over, keeping it balanced.  The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] and [[control theory]] and is used as a benchmark for testing control strategies.  It is often implemented with the pivot point mounted on a cart that can move horizontally under control of an electronic servo system as shown in the photo; this is called a '''cart and pole''' apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;C.A. Hamilton Union College Senior Project 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Most applications limit the pendulum to 1 [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degree of freedom]] by affixing the pole to an [[axis of rotation]]. Whereas a normal pendulum is stable when hanging downwards, an inverted pendulum is inherently unstable, and must be actively balanced in order to remain upright; this can be done either by applying a [[torque]] at the pivot point, by moving the pivot point horizontally as part of a [[feedback]] system, changing the rate of rotation of a mass mounted on the pendulum on an axis parallel to the pivot axis and thereby generating a net torque on the pendulum, or by oscillating the pivot point vertically. A simple demonstration of moving the pivot point in a feedback system is achieved by balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger.  

A second type of inverted pendulum is a [[tiltmeter]] for tall structures, which consists of a wire anchored to the bottom of the foundation and attached to a float in a pool of oil at the top of the structure that has devices for measuring movement of the neutral position of the float away from its original position.

== Overview ==
A pendulum with its bob hanging directly below the support [[Lever|pivot]] is at a [[Mechanical equilibrium|stable equilibrium]] point; there is no torque on the pendulum so it will remain motionless, and if displaced from this position will experience a restoring torque which returns it toward the equilibrium position.  A pendulum with its bob in an inverted position, supported on a rigid rod directly above the pivot, 180° from its stable equilibrium position, is at an [[unstable equilibrium]] point.  At this point again there is no torque on the pendulum, but the slightest displacement away from this position will cause a gravitation torque on the pendulum which will accelerate it away from equilibrium, and it will fall over.  
  
In order to stabilize a pendulum in this inverted position, a [[feedback controller|feedback control system]] can be used, which monitors the pendulum's angle and moves the position of the pivot point sideways when the pendulum starts to fall over, to keep it balanced.   The inverted pendulum is a classic problem in [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] and [[control theory]] and is widely used as a benchmark for testing control algorithms ([[PID controller]]s, [[state space representation]], [[neural networks]], [[fuzzy control]], [[genetic algorithm]]s, etc.). Variations on this problem include multiple links, allowing the motion of the cart to be commanded while maintaining the pendulum, and balancing the cart-pendulum system on a see-saw. The inverted pendulum is related to rocket or missile guidance, where the center of gravity is located behind the center of drag causing aerodynamic instability.&lt;ref&gt;http://exploration.grc.nasa.gov/education/rocket/rktstab.html&lt;/ref&gt; The understanding of a similar problem can be shown by simple robotics in the form of a balancing cart. Balancing an upturned broomstick on the end of one's finger is a simple demonstration, and the problem is solved by self-balancing [[personal transporter]]s such as the [[Segway PT]], the [[self-balancing scooter|self-balancing hoverboard]] and the [[self-balancing unicycle]].

Another way that an inverted pendulum may be stabilized, without any feedback or control mechanism, is by oscillating the pivot rapidly up and down.  This is called [[Kapitza's pendulum]].  If the [[oscillation]] is sufficiently strong (in terms of its acceleration and amplitude) then the inverted pendulum  can recover from perturbations in a strikingly counterintuitive manner. If the driving point moves in [[simple harmonic motion]],  the pendulum's motion is described by the [[Mathieu equation]].

==Equations of motion==

The [[equations of motion]] of inverted pendulums are dependent on what constraints are placed on the motion of the pendulum.  Inverted pendulums can be created in various configurations resulting in a number of Equations of Motion describing the behavior of the pendulum.

===Stationary pivot point===
In a configuration where the pivot point of the pendulum is fixed in space, the equation of motion is similar to that for an [[Pendulum (mathematics)|uninverted pendulum]].  The equation of motion below assumes no friction or any other resistance to movement, a rigid massless rod, and the restriction to [[2-dimensional]] movement.

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot \theta - {g \over \ell} \sin \theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\ddot \theta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular acceleration]] of the pendulum, &lt;math&gt;g &lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard gravity]] on the surface of the Earth, &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the pendulum, and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is the angular displacement measured from the equilibrium position.

When added to both sides, it will have the same sign as the angular acceleration term:

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot \theta = {g \over \ell} \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the inverted pendulum will accelerate away from the vertical unstable equilibrium in the direction initially displaced, and the acceleration is inversely proportional to the length. Tall pendulums fall more slowly than short ones.

'''Derivation using torque and moment of inertia:'''
[[Image:cart-pendulum.svg|thumb|300px| A schematic drawing of the inverted pendulum on a cart. The rod is considered massless. The mass of the cart and the point mass at the end of the rod are denoted by M and m. The rod has a length l.]]

The pendulum is assumed to consist of a point mass, of mass &lt;math&gt;m &lt;/math&gt;, affixed to the end of a massless rigid rod, of length &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, attached to a pivot point at the end opposite the point mass.

The net [[torque]] of the system must equal the [[moment of inertia]] times the angular acceleration:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{net}}=I \ddot \theta&lt;/math&gt;
The torque due to gravity providing the net torque:
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\tau}_{\mathrm{net}}= m g \ell \sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt; \theta\ &lt;/math&gt; is the angle measured from the inverted equilibrium position.

The resulting equation:
:&lt;math&gt; I \ddot \theta= m g \ell \sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

The moment of inertia for a point mass:
:&lt;math&gt;I = m R^2&lt;/math&gt;
In the case of the inverted pendulum the radius is the length of the rod, &lt;math&gt; \ell &lt;/math&gt;.

Substituting in &lt;math&gt;I = m \ell ^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; m \ell ^2 \ddot \theta= m g \ell \sin \theta\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Mass and &lt;math&gt;\ell^2&lt;/math&gt; is divided from each side resulting in:
:&lt;math&gt;\ddot \theta = {g \over \ell} \sin \theta&lt;/math&gt;

===Inverted pendulum on a cart===
An inverted pendulum on a cart consists of a mass &lt;math&gt; m &lt;/math&gt; at the top of a pole of length &lt;math&gt; \ell &lt;/math&gt; pivoted on a horizontally moving base as shown in the adjacent image.  The cart is restricted to [[linear motion]] and is subject to forces resulting in or hindering motion.

===Essentials of stabilization===
The essentials of stabilizing the inverted pendulum can be summarized qualitatively in three steps.
[[Image:Inverted Pendulum control essentials.JPG|thumb|600px| The simple stabilizing control system used on the cart with wine glass above.]]

1.	If the tilt angle &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is to the right, the cart must accelerate to the right and vice versa.

2.	The position of the cart &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; relative to track center is stabilized by slightly modulating the null angle (the angle error that the control system tries to null) by the position of the cart, that is, null angle &lt;math&gt; = \theta + k x &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; is small.  This makes the pole want to lean slightly toward track center and stabilize at track center where the tilt angle is exactly vertical.  Any offset in the tilt sensor or track slope that would otherwise cause instability translates into a stable position offset.  A further added offset gives position control.

3.	A normal pendulum subject to a moving pivot point such as a load lifted by a crane, has a peaked response at the pendulum radian frequency of &lt;math&gt; \omega_p = \sqrt {g/\ell} &lt;/math&gt;.  To prevent uncontrolled swinging, the frequency spectrum of the pivot motion should be suppressed near &lt;math&gt; \omega_p &lt;/math&gt;.  The inverted pendulum requires the same suppression filter to achieve stability.

Note that, as a consequence of the null angle modulation strategy, the position feedback is positive, that is, a sudden command to move right will produce an initial cart motion to the left followed by a move right to rebalance the pendulum.  The interaction of the pendulum instability and the positive position feedback instability to produce a stable system is a feature that makes the mathematical analysis an interesting and challenging problem.

=== Lagrange's Equations ===
The equations of motion can be derived using  [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]].  We refer to the drawing to the right where &lt;math&gt;\theta(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the angle of the pendulum of length &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the vertical direction and the acting forces are gravity and an external force ''F'' in the x-direction. Define &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; to be the position of the cart. The [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] &lt;math&gt;L = T - V&lt;/math&gt; of the system is:

:&lt;math&gt;
L = \frac{1}{2} M v_1^2  + \frac{1}{2} m v_2^2 - m g \ell\cos\theta 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the cart and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the point mass &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed in terms of x and &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; by writing the velocity as the first derivative of the position;
:&lt;math&gt;
v_1^2=\dot x^2
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
v_2^2=\left({\frac{d}{dt}}{\left(x- \ell\sin\theta\right)}\right)^2 + \left({\frac{d}{dt}}{\left( \ell\cos\theta \right)}\right)^2
&lt;/math&gt;
Simplifying the expression for &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; leads to:
:&lt;math&gt;
v_2^2= \dot x^2 -2 \ell \dot x \dot \theta\cos \theta + \ell^2\dot \theta^2

&lt;/math&gt;

The Lagrangian is now given by:
:&lt;math&gt;
L = \frac{1}{2} \left(M+m \right ) \dot x^2 -m \ell \dot x \dot\theta\cos\theta + \frac{1}{2} m \ell^2 \dot \theta^2-m g \ell\cos \theta
&lt;/math&gt;
and the equations of motion are:
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}{\partial{L}\over \partial{\dot x}} - {\partial{L}\over \partial x} = F
&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}{\partial{L}\over \partial{\dot \theta}} - {\partial{L}\over \partial \theta} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
substituting &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; in these equations and simplifying leads to the equations that describe the motion of the inverted pendulum:
:&lt;math&gt;
\left ( M + m \right ) \ddot x - m \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta + m \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta = F
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\ell \ddot \theta - g \sin \theta = \ddot x \cos \theta
&lt;/math&gt;
These equations are nonlinear, but since the goal of a control system would be to keep the pendulum upright the equations can be linearized around &lt;math&gt;\theta \approx 0&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Newton's Second Law===

Oftentimes it is beneficial to use [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Second Law]] instead of [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]] because Newton's equations give the reaction forces at the joint between the pendulum and the cart. These equations give rise to two equations for each body one in the x-direction and the other in the y-direction. The equations of motion of the cart are shown below where the LHS is the sum of the forces on the body and the RHS is the acceleration.

:&lt;math&gt;
F-R_x = M \ddot x
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
F_N - R_y - M g = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

In the equations above &lt;math&gt;R_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_y&lt;/math&gt; are reaction forces at the joint. &lt;math&gt;F_N&lt;/math&gt; is the normal force applied to the cart. This second equation only depends on the vertical reaction force thus the equation can be used to solve for the normal force. The first equation can be used to solve for the horizontal reaction force. In order to complete the equations of motion, the acceleration of the point mass attached to the pendulum must be computed. The position of the point mass can be given in inertial coordinates as

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec r_P = (x-\ell \sin \theta) \hat x_I + \ell \cos \theta \hat y_I
&lt;/math&gt;

Taking two derivatives yields the acceleration vector in the inertial reference frame.

:&lt;math&gt;
\vec a_{P/I} = (\ddot x + \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta ) \hat x_I + (-\ell \dot \theta^2 \cos \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \sin \theta) \hat y_I
&lt;/math&gt;

Then, using Newton's second law, two equations can be written in the x-direction and the y-direction. Note that the reaction forces are positive as applied to the pendulum and negative when applied to the cart. This is due to Newton's Third Law.

:&lt;math&gt;
R_x = m(\ddot x + \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta )
&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
R_y - m g = m (-\ell \dot \theta^2 \cos \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \sin \theta)
&lt;/math&gt;

The first equation allows yet another way to compute the horizontal reaction force in the event the applied force &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is not known. The second equation can be used to solve for the vertical reaction force. The first equation of motion is derived by substituting &lt;math&gt;F-R_x = M \ddot x&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;R_x = m(\ddot x + \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta  - \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta )&lt;/math&gt; which yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\left (M+m \right) \ddot x  - m \ell \ddot \theta \cos \theta  + m \ell \dot \theta^2 \sin \theta  = F
&lt;/math&gt;

By inspection this equation is identical to the result from Lagrange's Method. In order to obtain the second equation the pendulum equation of motion must be dotted with a unit vector which runs perpendicular to the pendulum at all times and is typically noted as the x-coordinate of the body frame. In inertial coordinates this vector can be written using a simple 2-D coordinate transformation

:&lt;math&gt; 
\hat x_B = \cos \theta \hat x_I + \sin \theta \hat y_I
&lt;/math&gt;

The pendulum equation of motion written in vector form is &lt;math&gt;\sum \vec F = m \vec a_{P/I}&lt;/math&gt;. Dotting &lt;math&gt;\hat x_B&lt;/math&gt; with both sides yields the following on the LHS (note that a transpose is the same as a dot product)

:&lt;math&gt;
(\hat x_B)^T\sum \vec F = (\hat x_B)^T (R_x \hat x_I + R_y \hat y_I - m g \hat y_I) = (\hat x_B)^T(R_p \hat y_B - m g \hat y_I) = -m g \sin \theta
&lt;/math&gt;

In the above equation the relationship between body frame components of the reaction forces and inertial frame components of reaction forces is used. The assumption that the bar connecting the point mass to the cart is massless implies that this bar cannot transfer any load perpendicular to the bar. Thus, the inertial frame components of the reaction forces can be written simply as &lt;math&gt;R_p \hat y_B&lt;/math&gt; which signifies that the bar can only transfer loads along the axis of the bar itself. This gives rise to another equation which can be used to solve for the tension in the rod itself

:&lt;math&gt;
R_p = \sqrt{ R_x^2 + R_y^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

The RHS of the equation is computed similarly by dotting &lt;math&gt;\hat x_B&lt;/math&gt; with the acceleration of the pendulum. The result (after some simplification) is shown below.

:&lt;math&gt;
m(\hat x_B)^T(\vec a_{P/I}) = m(\ddot x \cos \theta - \ell \ddot \theta)
&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the LHS with the RHS and dividing through by m yields

:&lt;math&gt;
\ell \ddot \theta - g \sin \theta = \ddot x \cos \theta
&lt;/math&gt;

which again is identical to the result of Lagrange's method. The benefit of using Newton's method is that all reaction forces are revealed to ensure that nothing will be damaged.
[[File:Kapitza pendulum.svg|thumb|upright=0.7|Drawing showing how a Kapitza pendulum can be constructed: a motor rotates a crank at a high speed, the crank vibrates a lever arm up and down, which the pendulum is attached to with a pivot.]]

==Kapitza's pendulum==
{{main|Kapitza's pendulum}}

An inverted pendulum in which the pivot is oscillated rapidly up and down can be stable in the inverted position.  This is called [[Kapitza's pendulum]], after Russian physicist [[Pyotr Kapitza]] who first analysed it.  The equation of motion for a pendulum connected to a massless, oscillating base is derived the same way as with the pendulum on the cart. The position of the point mass is now given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\left( -\ell \sin \theta , y + \ell \cos \theta    \right)&lt;/math&gt;
and the velocity is found by taking the first derivative of the position:
:&lt;math&gt;v^2=\dot y^2-2 \ell \dot y \dot \theta \sin \theta  + \ell^2\dot \theta ^2.&lt;/math&gt;[[Image:Inverted pendulum oscillatory base.svg|thumb|right|500px|Plots for the inverted pendulum on an oscillatory base. The first plot shows the response of the pendulum on a slow oscillation, the second the response on a fast oscillation]]

The [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] for this system can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;
 L = \frac{1 }{2} m \left ( \dot y^2-2 \ell \dot y \dot \theta \sin \theta  + \ell^2\dot \theta ^2   \right) - m g \left( y + \ell \cos \theta  \right )
&lt;/math&gt;
and the equation of motion follows from:
:&lt;math&gt;
{\mathrm{d} \over \mathrm{d}t}{\partial{L}\over \partial{\dot \theta}} - {\partial{L}\over \partial \theta} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;
resulting in:
:&lt;math&gt;
\ell \ddot \theta - \ddot y \sin \theta = g \sin \theta.
&lt;/math&gt;
If ''y'' represents a [[simple harmonic motion]], &lt;math&gt;y = A \sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;, the following [[differential equation]] is:
:&lt;math&gt;
\ddot \theta - {g \over \ell} \sin \theta = -{A \over \ell} \omega^2 \sin \omega t \sin \theta.
&lt;/math&gt;

This equation does not have elementary closed-form solutions, but can be explored in a variety of ways.  It is closely approximated by the [[Mathieu equation]], for instance, when the amplitude of oscillations are small. Analyses show that the pendulum stays upright for fast oscillations. The first plot shows that when &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a slow oscillation, the pendulum quickly falls over when disturbed from the upright position. The angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; exceeds 90° after a short time, which means the pendulum has fallen on the ground. If  &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is a fast oscillation the pendulum can be kept stable around the vertical position.  The second plot shows that when disturbed from the vertical position, the pendulum now starts an oscillation around the vertical position (&lt;math&gt;\theta = 0&lt;/math&gt;). The deviation from the vertical position stays small, and the pendulum doesn't fall over.

==Types of inverted pendulums==
Achieving stability of an inverted pendulum has become a common engineering challenge for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;http://robotics.ee.uwa.edu.au/theses/2003-Balance-Ooi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; There are different variations of the inverted pendulum on a cart ranging from a rod on a cart to a multiple segmented inverted pendulum on a cart. Another variation places the inverted pendulum's rod or segmented rod on the end of a rotating assembly. In both, (the cart and rotating system) the inverted pendulum can only fall in a plane. The inverted pendulums in these projects can either be required to only maintain balance after an equilibrium position is achieved or be able to achieve equilibrium by itself. Another platform is a two-wheeled balancing inverted pendulum. The two wheeled platform has the ability to spin on the spot offering a great deal of maneuverability.&lt;ref&gt;http://csuchico-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.4/145/4%2022%2009%20Jose%20Miranda.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; Yet another variation balances on a single point.  A [[spinning top]], a [[unicycle]], or an inverted pendulum atop a spherical ball all balance on a single point. As derived above the inverted pendulum can also be achieved by having a vertically oscillating base.

==Examples of inverted pendulums==
Arguably the most prevalent example of a stabilized inverted pendulum is a [[human being]].  A person standing upright acts as an inverted pendulum with his feet as the pivot, and without constant small muscular adjustments would fall over.  The human nervous system contains an unconscious [[feedback]] [[control system]], the [[sense of balance]] or [[righting reflex]], that uses [[proprioceptive]] input from the eyes, muscles and joints, and orientation input from the [[vestibular system]] consisting of the three [[semicircular canals]] in the [[inner ear]], and two [[otolith]] organs, to make continual small adjustments to the skeletal muscles to keep us standing upright.  Walking, running, or balancing on one leg puts additional demands on this system.  Certain diseases and alcohol or drug intoxication can interfere with this reflex, causing [[dizziness]] and [[disequilibrium (medicine)|disequilibration]], an inability to stand upright.  A [[field sobriety test]] used by police to test drivers for the influence of alcohol or drugs, tests this reflex for impairment.     

Some simple examples include balancing brooms or meter sticks by hand. 
 
The inverted pendulum has been employed in various devices and trying to balance an inverted pendulum presents a unique engineering problem for researchers.&lt;ref&gt;http://csuchico-dspace.calstate.edu/bitstream/handle/10211.4/145/4%2022%2009%20Jose%20Miranda.pdf?sequence=1&lt;/ref&gt; The inverted pendulum was a central component in the design of several early [[seismometer]]s due to its inherent instability resulting in a measurable response to any disturbance.&lt;ref&gt;https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/topics/seismology/history/part12.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The inverted pendulum model has been used in some recent [[personal transporter]]s, such as the two-wheeled [[self-balancing scooter]]s and single-wheeled [[electric unicycle]]s. These devices are kinematically unstable and use an electronic feedback [[servo system]] to keep them upright.

[[File:Babylonian - Boundary Stone - Walters 2110 - Back.jpg|thumb|270px|[[Walters Art Museum]] no. 2110 kudurru.]]
The '''Kudurrus of Isin (Babylonian Kingdom), king [[Marduk-nadin-ahhe]]''', late 2nd millennium BC, c. 1099-1082 BC.

==British Museum kudurru==
The ''British Museum kudurru'' is a black limestone boundary stone ([[kudurru]]) of [[Marduk-nadin-ahhe]], who ruled ca. 1100 BC – 1082 BC in [[List of kings of Babylon#Dynasty IV of Babylon, from Isin|Dynasty IV of Babylon]].

Some kudurrus are known for their representations of the king, etc., who consigned it. Most kudurrus represent [[Mesopotamia]]n gods, which are often displayed graphically in segmented [[Register (sculpture)|register]]s on the stone.

The ''Marduk-nadin-ahhe kudurru'' shows the king standing in royal garb, holding a bow and two arrows. Above his portrayal is one [[Register (sculpture)|register]] displaying the gods represented on the boundary stone contract. A caption attests that he is the "Avenger of the People".

The obverse of the kudurru with King Marduk-nadin-ahhe is separated from the reverse by part of a snake, and a text in [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] comprises the reverse of the kudurru.

==Walters no. 2110 kudurru==
[[File:Babylonian - Boundary Stone - Walters 2110 - View A.jpg|thumb|left|110px]]
[[Walters Art Museum|Walters]] museum no. 2110 is a damaged kudurru, but fortunately parts in exquisite shape, as well as legible [[cuneiform]] text.

==Deed kudurru, Marduk-nasir==
[[File:Marduk-nādin-aḫḫē.jpg|thumb|150px|Marduk-nasir deed kudurru (king's officer).]]
A deed (kudurru) recording the purchase of five &lt;small&gt;GUR&lt;/small&gt; of corn-land by Marduk-nasir, the king's officer. The kudurru appears to be a flat, inscribed stone type.

==Land grant to Adad-zer-iqiša==
[[File:Flickr - Nic's events - British Museum with Cory and Mary, 6 Sep 2007 - 203.jpg|thumb|left|100px|British Museum kudurru, [[Land grant to Adad-zer-iqiša kudurru]].]]
The [[British Museum]] kudurru, Land grant to Adad-zer-iqiša, is a large, stone kudurru, in fine shape, with multiple images of gods, and their iconic graphic symbols; the gods, and symbols encircle the top, approximately cone, circle-shaped top of the kudurru. Cuneiform is written amongst the graphic symbols of the upper cone. An extensive cuneiform script, below an encircling register line, around the top cone, tells the story of the kudurru.

'''Marc Ona Essangui''' is founder of the environmental NGO Brainforest and president of Environment Gabon, a network of NGOs. Marc Ona Essangui led efforts to expose agreements behind a Chinese mining project in [[Gabon]], a country in West [[Central Africa]], that threatened [[equatorial rainforest]] ecosystems.  According to Ona Essangui, the proposed [[Belinga]] development, a $3.5 billion project, was secretly negotiated. Local communities were not consulted and are unaware of the effect that the project would have on their environment. Ona won the 2009 Africa [[Goldman Environmental Prize]] for his work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goldmanprize.org/2009/africa 2009 Goldman Environmental Prize Recipient Marc Ona Essangui]&lt;/ref&gt; The project is currently on hold due to a lack of financing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.banktrack.org/show/dodgydeals/belinga_iron_ore_project&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, Ona Essangui was sentenced to a six-month suspended prison sentence and an approximately $10,000 USD fine for defamation of Liban Soleman, senior advisor to President [[Ali Bongo Ondimba]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/03/30/us-gabon-olam-activist-idUSBRE92T04Q20130330&lt;/ref&gt;

The first test phase uses an 18-engine truck-mounted wing. The second phase will install the cruise props and motors on a standard P2006T for ground- and flight-test experience. Phase 3 tests will involve the high-lift DEP wing and demonstrate increased high-speed cruise efficiency.  The leading-edge nacelles will be fitted, but the high-lift props, motors and controllers will not be installed. Phase 4 adds the DEP motors and folding props to demonstrate lift-augmentation.&lt;ref name= AvWeek4sep2015 /&gt;

=== LEAPTech project ===
The ''Leading Edge Asynchronous Propeller Technology'' (''LEAPTech'') project is a [[NASA]] project developing an experimental [[electric aircraft]] technology involving many small [[electric motor]]s driving individual small [[propeller]]s distributed along the edge of each [[aircraft wing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Mary | last = Grady |url= http://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/NASAs-Electric-Airplane-Project-Moves-Forward-223711-1.html |title= NASA's Electric Airplane Project Moves Forward |work= AVweb |date= 18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.gizmag.com/nasa-leaptech-demonstrator/36589/ |title= Could this 18-motor wing be the future of electric aircraft? | first = David | last = Szondy |work= Gizmag |date= 18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.wired.com/2015/03/nasa-straps-18-propellers-wing-science/ |title= NASA Straps 18 Propellers to a Wing, Because Science | first = Jordan | last = Golson |work= Wired |date= 20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To optimize performance, each motor can be operated independently at different speeds, decreasing reliance on fossil fuels, improving aircraft performance and ride quality, and reducing aircraft noise.&lt;ref name= Merlin20150316&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nasa.gov/centers/armstrong/Features/leaptech.html |title= LEAPTech to Demonstrate Electric Propulsion Technologies |date= 16 March 2015 | first = Peter | last = Merlin |publisher= NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The LEAPTech project began in 2014 when researchers from [[NASA Langley Research Center]] and [[NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center]]  partnered with two California companies, [[Empirical Systems Aerospace]] (ESAero) in [[Pismo Beach]] and [[Joby Aviation]] in [[Santa Cruz, California]]. ESAero is the prime contractor responsible for system integration and instrumentation, while Joby is responsible for design and manufacture of the electric motors, propellers, and carbon fiber wing section.&lt;ref name=Merlin20150316/&gt;

In 2015, NASA researchers were ground testing a {{cvt|31|foot}} span, [[carbon composite]] wing section with 18 electric motors powered by [[lithium iron phosphate batteries]].
Preliminary testing up to 40 mph took place in January at [[Oceano County Airport]] on California’s Central Coast.
Mounted on a specially modified truck, it was tested at up to 70 mph across a dry lakebed at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] later in 2015.&lt;ref name=Merlin20150316/&gt;

The experiment precedes the X-57 Maxwell [[X-plane]] demonstrator proposed under NASA’s [[Transformative Aeronautics Concepts]] program. A piloted X-plane should fly within a couple of years, after replacing a [[Tecnam P2006T]] wings and engines  with an improved version of the LEAPTech wing and motors. Using an existing airframe will allow engineers to easily compare the performance of the X-plane with the original P2006T.&lt;ref name=Merlin20150316/&gt;

=== X-57 Maxwell ===
[[File:Nad graphic letternasa.jpg|thumb|The Maxwell was included in an illustration for [[National Aviation Day]] 2016]]

The X-57 project was publicly revealed by NASA Administrator [[Charles Bolden]] on 16 June 2016 in a keynote speech to the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]] (AIAA) at its Aviation 2016 exposition.&lt;ref name=DailyMail17June2016&gt;{{cite news |author= Mark Prigg |title= The REAL X-Wing: Nasa unveils 'megawing' X-57 Maxwell with 14 electric motors on its wing that could revolutionise travel |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-3647184/The-X-plane-Nasa-unveils-Maxwell-megawing-X-57-14-electric-motors-revolutionise-travel.html |work= [[Daily Mail]] |date=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
NASA's first [[X-plane]] in over a decade, it is part of NASA's New Aviation Horizons initiative, which will also produce up to five larger-scale aircraft. The X-57 will be built by the agency's {{abbr|SCEPTOR|Scalable Convergent Electric Propulsion Technology Operations Research}} project, over a four-year development period at [[Armstrong Flight Research Center]], California, with a first flight initially planned for 2017.&lt;ref name=WashPost16jun2016/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Alan Boyle |title= NASA gets first official X-plane in a decade: Electric craft named X-57 Maxwell |url= http://www.geekwire.com/2016/nasa-x-plane-x-57-maxwell-electric/ |work= [[GeekWire]] |date=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Yasmin Tayag |title= NASA Admin Charlie Bolden: X-57 Will Fly Next Year |url= https://www.inverse.com/article/17134-nasa-admin-charlie-bolden-x-57-will-fly-next-year |work= [[Inverse.com]] |date=June 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, [[Scaled Composites]] was modifying a first P2006T to the X-57 Mod II configuration by replacing the piston engines with [[Joby Aviation]] electric motors, to fly early in 2018.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek19Jul2017/&gt;--&gt;

Mod IV configuration will see the installation of the [[Xperimental, LLC]] high [[wing aspect ratio|aspect ratio]] wing with 12 smaller props along its [[leading edge]] to augment its takeoff and landing [[aerodynamic lift]].&lt;ref name=AvWeek19Jul2017&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/technology/nasa-pushing-ahead-electric-x-plane |title= NASA Pushing Ahead With Electric X-plane |date= Jul 19, 2017 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The donor [[Tecnam P2006T]] was received in California in July 2016.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek26oct2017&gt;--&gt;
In a December 2016 test, a battery cell was shorted and the overheating  spread to other cells, requiring the packaging to be redesigned from eight to 16 modules with [[aluminum honeycomb]] separators.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek26oct2017&gt;--&gt;
The [[Rotax 912]]s will be replaced by {{cvt|60|kW}} electric motors for the Mod II.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek26oct2017&gt;--&gt;
The Mod III weight target is {{cvt|3,000|lb}} from the P2006T {{cvt|2,700|lb}} and aims for 500% higher high-speed cruise efficiency as the higher [[wing loading]] will reduce cruise drag.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek26oct2017&gt;--&gt;
The Mod IV with 12 propellers to take off and land at the same speeds as the P2006T is yet unfunded.&lt;ref name=AvWeek26oct2017&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/business-aviation/electric-x-plane-nears-crucial-battery-test |title= Electric X-Plane Nears Crucial Battery Test |date= Oct 26, 2017 |author= Graham Warwick |work= Aviation Week Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2017, the redesigned passively cooled battery module with 320 [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion cell]] down from 640 passed testing.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek5jun2018&gt;--&gt;
The experience helped [[Electric Power Systems]] develop a battery for the [[Bye Aerospace Sun Flyer 2]] which made its first flight in April 2018.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek5jun2018&gt;--&gt;
Joby Aviation delivered three cruise motors in 2017, and was assembling the final pair in June 2018.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=AvWeek5jun2018&gt;--&gt;

By September 2018, the first [[Joby Aviation JM-X57]] electric cruise motor were mounted with controllers, batteries and new cockpit displays at Scaled Composites in Mojave, before flight tests in mid-2019.&lt;!--&lt;ref name= AvWeek5sep2018/&gt;--&gt;
Construction of the [[ESAero]] high aspect ratio, low drag composite wing was then almost finished, to fly the Mod 3 by mid-2020.&lt;ref name= AvWeek5sep2018&gt;{{cite news |url= http://aviationweek.com/future-aerospace/motor-mounting-marks-milestone-nasa-s-electric-x-plane |title= Motor Mounting Marks Milestone For NASA’s Electric X-plane |date= Sep 5, 2018 |author= Guy Norris |work= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design == 

Modified from a [[Tecnam P2006T]], the X-57 will be an [[electric aircraft]], with 14 [[electric motor]]s driving [[propeller]]s mounted on the wing leading edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.aerospaceamerica.org/Documents/Aerospace_America_PDFs_2016/May2016/ElectricAirliner_MAY2016.pdf |title=Flying on Electrons |author= Keith Button |date= May 2016 |publisher= American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
All 14 electric motors will be used during takeoff and landing, with only the outer two used during [[Cruise (aeronautics)|cruise]].
The additional [[airflow]] over the wings created by the additional motors generates greater lift, allowing for a narrower wing.
The aircraft seats two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Steve Fox |title= Cockpit of the First All-Electric Propulsion Aircraft |url= http://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/cockpit-of-the-first-all-electric-propulsion-aircraft |agency= NASA |date= 26 July 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It will have a [[Range (aeronautics)|range]] of {{cvt|100|mi|km}} and a maximum flight time of approximately one hour.
The X-57's designers hope to reduce by five-fold the energy necessary to fly a light aircraft at {{convert|175|mph|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=DailyMail17June2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost16jun2016&gt;{{cite news |author= Matt McFarland |title= NASA’s new electric plane could be a significant step toward a cleaner era of aviation |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/06/16/nasas-new-electric-plane-could-be-a-significant-step-toward-a-cleaner-era-of-aviation/ |work= [[Washington Post]] |date= June 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Distributed propulsion]] increases the number and decreases the size of airplane engines. Electric motors are substantially smaller and lighter than jet engines of equivalent power. This allows them to be placed in different, more favorable locations. In this case, the engines are to be mounted above and distributed along the wings rather than suspended below them.&lt;ref name=AvWeek4sep2015/&gt;

The propellers are mounted above the wing. They will increase the air flow over the wing at lower speeds, increasing its lift. The increased lift allows it to take operate on shorter [[runway]]s. Such a wing could be only a third of the width of the wing it replaces, saving weight and fuel costs. Typical light aircraft wings are relatively large to prevent the craft from [[aircraft stall|stalling]] (which happens at low airspeeds, when the wing cannot provide sufficient lift). Large wings are inefficient at cruising speed because they create excess drag.&lt;ref name=Economist17sep2105/&gt; The wings will be optimised for cruise, with the engines protecting it from low-speed stalls and achieving the small aircraft standard of {{cvt|61|knots|km/h}}.&lt;ref name=AvWeek4sep2015&gt;{{Cite news |title= NASA’s Electric-Propulsion Wing Test Helps Shape Next X-Plane |date= September 4, 2015 |author= Graham Warwick |magazine= Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology |url= http://aviationweek.com/technology/nasa-s-electric-propulsion-wing-test-helps-shape-next-x-plane }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The speed of each propeller can be controlled independently, offering the ability to change the over-wing airflow pattern to cope with flying conditions, such as wind gusts. When cruising, the propellers closer to the fuselage could be folded back to further reduce drag, leaving those towards the wing tips to move the plane.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Economist17sep2105/&gt;--&gt;
Such aircraft would have no in-flight emissions, operate with less noise and reduce operating costs by an estimated 30%.&lt;ref name=Economist17sep2105/&gt;
Cruising efficiency was expected to increase 3.5-5-fold.&lt;ref name=AvWeek4sep2015/&gt;

The {{cvt|31.6|ft}} span wing with an aspect ratio of 15 compares to {{cvt|37.4|ft}} and 8.8 for the stock P2006T wing, the slender wing's chord is {{cvt|2.48|ft}} at the wing root and {{cvt|1.74|ft}} at the tip.&lt;ref name=AvWeek4sep2015/&gt;
The wing features 12 {{cvt|1.89|ft}} diameter cruise propellers that each require {{cvt|14.4|kW}} of motor power at {{cvt|55|knots|km/h}} and turn at 4,548 [[Revolutions per minute|rpm]]. The five-blade props fold in cruise to reduce drag. Each wingtip hosts two 3-blade {{cvt|5|ft}} diameter cruise props that each require {{cvt|48.1|kW}} at {{cvt|150|knots|km/h}} and turn at 2,250 rpm. The wingtip location offers favorable interaction with the [[wingtip vortices]], expected to provide a 5% drag saving.&lt;ref name=AvWeek4sep2015/&gt;
The {{cvt|47|kWh}} battery packs weight {{cvt|860|lb|kg}} for a {{#expr:47000/{{cvt|860|lb|kg|disp=number}}round0}} Wh/kg density.&lt;ref name= AvWeek5sep2018/&gt;

'''National Wind, LLC''', A Trishe Group of Company, is a [[Minneapolis]] company founded in 2003 that is a developer of large-scale, community-based [[wind energy]] projects. The company, along with National Wind Assessments, has 50 employees based in [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota|MN]] and [[Grand Forks, North Dakota|Grand Forks]], [[North Dakota]]. National Wind claims to be the nation’s leading developer of community-based [[wind farms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalwind.us/wind_project_models|title=Wind Power Project Models|publisher=National Wind, LLC.|accessdate=2008-07-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616055148/http://www.nationalwind.us/wind_project_models|archivedate=2008-06-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community-based model==
{{See also|Community wind energy}}
National Wind operates under a community-based [[business model]]. Each [[wind]] project is structured as its own [[limited liability company]] (LLC) and is formed as a partnership between National Wind and local community members and [[landowners]]. Although National Wind is generally the developer and manager of its wind projects, it shares ownership of each project company with members of the communities where the wind farm is located. National Wind highlights the benefits of the community model, saying that community ownership benefits local economies along with the environment.

National Wind’s business model differs from the structure of most other wind developers. Traditionally, when a company builds a wind farm, they become the sole owners of the development. The owners of the land where the farm is built tend to have minimal involvement with projects developer. In the traditional model, landowners do not own shares of the wind project, but instead are either paid a monthly lease or given [[royalties]] from the sale of [[electricity]]. On the other hand, National Wind's model aims to share both revenue and influence within local communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalwind.us/files/The%20Furrow%20February%202008.pdf|title=Community Property|last=Houghton|first=Dean|date=February 2008|work=The Furrow|publisher=National Wind, LLC.|accessdate=2008-07-13}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==
National Wind develops and manages wind farms that produce, at minimum, 50 [[megawatts]] of [[renewable energy]]. Most of the company’s developments are located in the [[Midwestern]] [[United States]] in [[Iowa]], [[Minnesota]], [[North Dakota]], [[South Dakota]], [[Colorado]], and [[Ohio]]. Currently, National Wind has twelve families of utility-scale wind projects in development or operation.

*'''Emmet County Energy LLC''' (NorthStar Wind Farms) – Formed in 2005, so-called NorthStar wind project is a 250 megawatt development.  The development is located in [[Emmet County, Iowa|Emmet County]] and [[Dickinson County, Iowa|Dickinson County]] in [[Iowa]].  The acquisition of a right of way for a short transmission line to connect the project with the grid in [[Jackson, Minnesota]] has been completed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eqb.state.mn.us/project.html?Id=19789 Northstar Wind transmission line&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''M-Power LLC''' – Formed in 2006, M-Power is a 169.5 megawatt family of projects located in [[Griggs County]] and [[Steele County, North Dakota|Steele County]], [[North Dakota]]. M-Power is North Dakota’s largest community-owned wind energy development to date.**National Wind completed its involvement in April 2009 and is no longer associated with M-Power.&lt;ref name="M-Power"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/story?id=50246|title=National Wind Expands on Two Fronts |date=2007-10-12|publisher=Renewable Energy World|accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Red Rock Wind Energy''' – Many of the community members involved in Emmet County Energy decided to capture more of the potential wind energy in [[Emmet County, Iowa|Emmet County]] and [[Dickinson County, Iowa|Dickinson County]] and formed Red Rock Wind Energy in 2008 to develop another 300 MW of wind energy in the two [[Iowa]] counties.
*'''Little Rock Wind''' – A 150-megawatt family of community wind projects in [[Big Stone County]], Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/03/little-rock-wind-to-develop-utility-scale-community-wind-farms Little Rock Wind To Develop Utility-Scale, Community Wind Farms]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Northwest Ohio Wind Energy''' – Northwest Ohio Wind Energy formed in early 2009 after a local community group previously organized as Ohio Wind Energy, LLC, partnered with National Wind to develop 300 MW of community-based wind in [[Paulding County, Ohio|Paulding County]] and [[Van Wert County]] in northwest Ohio.
*'''Norfolk Wind Energy''' – Farmers in [[Renville County, Minnesota|Renville County]], Minnesota, partnered with National Wind in early 2009 to develop 40 megawatts or more of community-based wind energy.

== Assessment division ==
National Wind Assessments, a subdivision of National Wind LLC, specializes in the planning, permitting, and overall design of wind farms.  Based in North Dakota, the assessment team analyzes potential wind farm sites using met tower installation, wind data acquisition, and environmental impact studies.&lt;ref name="National Wind Assessment"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nationalwindassessments.us/aboutus |title=About us|publisher=National Wind Assessment|accessdate=2008-07-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080712193618/http://nationalwindassessments.us/aboutus &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition ==
The demand for [[sustainable energy]] sources continues to bolster America’s wind energy industry.  As more and more companies begin to develop [[wind farms]], competition amongst industry leaders remains strong.

Although National Wind claims to be the dominant community-based wind energy developer, it also faces competition from wind companies who follow a non-community business model.  Its primary competitors include [[Florida Power and Light]] Company, Enxco, Invenergy LLC, and EcoEnergy LLC.

== Media attention ==
Over the last few years, National Wind has garnered attention from a variety of local and national media outlets. On February 22, 2008, [[Minnesota]]’s largest newspaper, the [[Star Tribune]], featured National Wind on the cover of the business section.&lt;ref name="Star Tribune"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.startribune.com/business/15858777.html|title=Rural wind power shifts direction|last=Lee|first=Thomas|date=2008-02-22|publisher=Star Tribune (Minneapolis)|accessdate=2008-07-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080622101205/http://www.startribune.com/business/15858777.html|archivedate=2008-06-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  National Wind has also been featured in [[Twin Cities Business]],&lt;ref name="Twin Cities Business"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalwind.us/files/Rising%20Wind%20PDF.pdf|title=Rising wind|last=Howard|first=Fran|date=June 2007|publisher=Twin Cities Business|accessdate=2008-07-13}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Lincoln Star]], and various other local publications.

CEO Leon Steinberg, representing one America's "leading wind-energy developers," was also cited in a July 2008 [[US News and World Report]] article on the importance of the federal [[production tax credit]] for the growing industry.&lt;ref name="US News and World Report"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/articles/news/national/2008/07/28/congress-blows-hot-and-cold-over-tax-breaks-for-wind-energy.html|title=Congress Blows Hot and Cold Over Tax Breaks for Wind Energy| last=Garber|first=Kent|date=2008-07-28|publisher=US News and World Report|accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nitronate''' ([[IUPAC]]: '''azinate''') in [[organic chemistry]] is a [[functional group]] with the general structure {{chem|R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C{{=}}NO|2|−}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = F. A. Carey, R. J. Sundberg | title = Organische Chemie | publisher = Wiley-VCH Verlag | date = 2004 | isbn = 3-527-29217-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is the anion of a '''nitronic acid''', a [[tautomer]]ic form of a [[nitro compound|nitro]] compound. Just as ketones and aldehydes exist in equilibrium with their enol tautomer in basic and acidic conditions, nitro compounds exist in equilibrium under basic conditions with their nitronate tautomer. The base deprotonates the α carbon, or the carbon directly attached to the nitrogen. The nitronate has two different resonance structures, one with a negative charge on the α carbon and a double bond between the nitrogen and one of the oxygens, and another resonance structure with a double bond between the nitrogen and the α carbon, and no double bond between the nitrogen and the oxygens. A nitronic acid is also called an aci form. In the [[Nef reaction]] nitronic acids are degraded to [[ketones]]. They can be alkylated on oxygen and used as a dipole in [[1,3-dipolar cycloaddition]]s.

[[File:Skulptur massive kartonmasse.JPG|thumb|right|Sculpture made of massive paperboard by [[Herbert Wetterauer]]]]

'''Paperboard''' is a  thick [[paper]]-based material.  While there is no rigid differentiation between paper and paperboard, paperboard is generally thicker (usually over 0.30&amp;nbsp;mm, 0.012 in, or 12 points) than [[paper]] and has certain superior attributes such as foldability and rigidity. According to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] standards, paperboard is a paper with a [[grammage]] above 250 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, but there are exceptions.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Robertson|first= Gordon L.|title=Food Packaging - Principle and Practice (2nd Ed.)|year=2005|isbn=978-0-8493-3775-8 |page=111|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paperboard can be single- or multi-ply.  

Paperboard can be easily cut and formed, is lightweight, and because it is strong, is used in [[packaging]].  Another end-use is high quality graphic printing, such as book and magazine covers or postcards.  Paperboard is also used in [[fine art]]s for creating sculptures.

Sometimes it is referred to as ''[[Cardboard (paper product)|cardboard]]'', which is a generic, lay term used to refer to any heavy [[pulp (paper)|paper pulp]]–based board, however this usage is deprecated in the paper, printing and packaging industries as it does not adequately describe each product type.

==History==
In 1817, the first paperboard carton was produced in [[England]]. [[Folding carton]]s first emerged around the 1860s and were shipped flat to save space, ready to be set up by customers when they were required. 1879 saw the development of mechanical die cutting and creasing of blanks. In 1911 the first [[kraft process|kraft sulphate mill]] was built in [[Florida]]. In 1915 the [[carton#Gable top|gable top]] milk carton was patented and in 1935 the first [[dairy#Industrial processing|dairy plant]] was observed using them. Ovenable paperboard was introduced in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Paperboard Packaging Alliance |title=Paperboard Packaging |accessdate=2009-07-18 |url=http://www.paperboardpackaging.org/student_design_challenge/syllabus/1-%20History%20of%20Paperboard.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121092805/http://www.paperboardpackaging.org/student_design_challenge/syllabus/1-%20History%20of%20Paperboard.pdf |archivedate=November 21, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology and classification==
[[File:Pakje sigaretten.JPG |thumb| Crush-proof [[Cigarette pack]] made of folding boxboard.]]
Terminology and classifications of paperboard are not always uniform.  Differences occur  depending on specific industry,  locale, and personal choice.   In general, the following are often used:&lt;ref&gt;[[ASTM]] D996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

* Boxboard or cartonboard: paperboard for [[folding carton]]s and rigid set-up boxes
** [[Folding boxboard]]  (FBB): a bending grade capable of being scored and bending without fracture
** [[White lined chipboard|Chipboard]]: a recycled, low quality board
*** [[White lined chipboard]] (WLC): a white, often clay-coated chipboard
** [[Kraft process|Kraft]] board: a strong virgin fiber board often used for beverage carriers.  Often clay-coated for printing
** Laminated board: a lamination of paperboards and other materials, for example [[liquid packaging board]]

* Other
** [[Binder's board]]: a paperboard used in bookbinding for making hardcovers.

==Production==
{{See also|Paper machine}}
Fibrous material is turned into pulp (paper)/pulp and bleaching of wood [[Pulp (paper)|bleached]], to create one or more layers of board, which can be optionally coated for a better surface and/or improved visual appearance. pulp board are produced on pulping machines that can handle higher grammage and several plies.

===Raw materials===
The above-mentioned fibrous material can either come from fresh (virgin) sources (e.g. wood) or from [[Paper recycling|recycled waste paper]]. Around 90% of virgin paper is made from [[timber|wood]] pulp.&lt;ref name="ind"&gt;{{Cite journal
|last=Datamonitor
|title=Global Paper and Paperboard - Industry Profile
|accessdate=2009-07-19

|ref=0199-2406
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today paperboard packaging in general, and especially products from [[ecolabel|certified]] [[sustainability|sustainable]] sources, are receiving new attention, as manufacturers dealing with environmental, health, and regulatory issues look to [[renewable resources]] to meet increasing demand. It is now mandatory in many countries for paper-based packaging to be manufactured wholly or partially from [[recycling|recycled]] material.
 
Raw materials include:

* '''[[Hardwood]]:''' C. {{convert|0.05|in|mm}} in length e.g. [[Birch]] which has short fibres. It is generally more difficult to work with; however, it does provide higher tensile strength, but lower tear and other strength properties. Although its fibres are not as long and strong as those in softwood, they make for a stiffer product defined by some stifness tests.  Hardwood fibres fill the sheet better and therefore make a smoother paper that is more opaque and better for printing.  Hardwood makes an excellent corrugating medium.
*'''[[Softwood]]:''' C.  {{convert|0.13|in|mm}} in length e.g. [[Pine]] and [[spruce]] which have typically long fibres and make superior paperboard in services where strength is important.  Softwood makes excellent linerboard.
* '''[[Deinked pulp|Recycled]]:''' Used paper is collected and sorted and usually mixed with virgin fibres in order to make new material. This is necessary as the recycled fibre often loses strength when reused; the added virgin fibres enhance strength. Mixed waste paper is not usually [[Deinking|deinked]] (skipping the deinking stage) for paperboard manufacture and hence the [[pulping|pulp]] may contain traces of inks, adhesives, and other residues which together give it a grey colour. Products made of recycled board usually have a less predictable composition and poorer functional properties than virgin fibre-based boards.&lt;ref name="igg"&gt;{{Cite journal

* '''[[Tree-free paper|Others]]''': It is also possible to use the fibres of [[Bagasse|Sugarcane Bagasse]], [[Straw]], [[Hemp]], [[Cotton]], [[Flax]], [[Kenaf]], [[Abaca]] and other plant products

===Pulping===
{{Main article|Pulp (paper)}}
Two principal methods for extracting fibres from their sources are:

* '''[[Chemical pulp]]ing''' uses chemical solutions to convert wood into pulp, yielding around 30% less than mechanical pulping; however, pulp made by the kraft process has superior strength
* '''[[Thermo mechanical pulp]]''' is a two-stage process which results in a very high yield of wood fibres at the expense of strength.

====Bleaching====
{{Main article|Bleaching of wood pulp}}
Pulp used in the manufacture of paperboard can be [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleached]] to decrease colour and increase purity. Virgin fibre pulp is naturally brown in colour, because of the presence of [[lignin]]. Recycled paperboard may contain traces of [[ink]]s, [[Adhesive|bonding agents]] and other residue which colors it grey.
Although [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching]] is not necessary for all end-uses, it is vital for many graphical and packaging purposes. There are various methods of [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching]], which are used according to a number of factors for example, the degree of colour change required, chemicals chosen and method of treatment. There are three categories of [[bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching methods]]:

* Bleaching by '''delignification''' using [[chlorine gas]], which is a method that has been largely replaced by procedures which are gentler to the environment such as the use of oxygen as a replacement for the chlorine gas.	
* Bleaching by '''[[oxidation]]''' using chemicals such as [[chlorine dioxide]], [[hydrogen peroxide]] or [[sodium hypochlorite]].
* Bleaching by '''[[redox|reduction]]''' using chemicals such as [[sodium bisulphite]].&lt;ref name="igg"/&gt;

===Plies===
[[Image:Single vs multiply.svg|thumb|100px|(1)&amp;nbsp;single-ply vs. (2)&amp;nbsp;multi-ply]]Multi-ply paperboard generally has higher creasing and folding performance than single-ply as a result of layering different types of pulp into a single product. In cases where the same kind of pulp is being used in several layers, each separate layer is treated and shaped individually in order to create the highest possible quality.&lt;ref name="igg"/&gt;

===Coating===
In order to improve whiteness, smoothness and gloss of paperboard, one or more layers of [[Coating and printing processes|coating]] is applied. [[Coated paper]] is usually made up of:

* a [[pigment]], which could be [[china clay]], [[calcium carbonate]] or [[titanium dioxide]], usually a combination of two
* an adhesive or binder as [[styrene-butadiene]] emulsions or [[starch]]es and [[water]].

Additional components could be OBA ([[optical brightener|optical brightening agent]]s).&lt;ref name="kir"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grades==
The [[Deutsches Institut für Normung|DIN]] Standard 19303 "Paperboard - Terms and grades" (Publication date : 2005-09) defines different grades of paperboard based on the surface treatment (first letter), the main furnish (second letter) and the colour (non-D grade) or bulk (D grade only) (numbering).

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! First letter&lt;br&gt;(surface treatment)

|
* A = cast-coated
* G = pigment coated
* U = uncoated
| 
* Z = bleached virgin chemical pulp
* C = virgin mechanical pulp
* N = unbleached virgin chemical pulp
* T = recycled/secondary fibre with white, cream or brown reverse
* D = recycled/secondary fibre with grey back
| 
All except D grades:
# white reverse side
# cream reverse side
# brown  reverse side

D grades only:
# bulk ≥ 1.45&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g
# 1.3&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g&amp;nbsp;&lt; bulk &lt;&amp;nbsp;1.45&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g
# bulk ≤ 1.3&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/g
|}

'''Example: '''  GC1 would be a "pigment coated", "virgin mechanical pulp" board with a "white reverse side". Often the used paperboard type would be FBB, which was coated on both sides.

==Common terms==
'''Basis Weight (US):''' Is the weight in {{convert|1000|sqft|m2}} of paperboard.

'''Brightness:''' Brightness is a technical term that is defined as the amount of blue-white light that a paper reflects.&lt;ref name="twe"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property is very subjective and individual to each buyer and end use, as skin colour and food are better reproduced on ‘warm’ (yellow) whites and not blue whites.

'''Grammage:''' The [[grammage]] of the paperboard is assessed in accordance ISO 536.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |author=ISO: International Organisation for Standardisation
  |year=1995
  |title=Paper and board -- Determination of grammage
  |accessdate=2009-07-18
  |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=20674}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Grammage expresses mass per unit area and is measured in g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="twe"/&gt;

'''PH:''' Surface [[pH]] is measured on a water extract and is on a scale of 0–14. 0 is [[acidic]], 7 is neutral and 14 is [[alkaline]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Iggesund Paperboard |year=2008 |title=Product Catalogue: General Technical Information |accessdate=2009-07-18 |url=http://www.iggesund.com/Main.aspx?ID=d3f6ae98-6286-435d-bf6d-99a7ca881cab |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713004736/http://www.iggesund.com/Main.aspx?ID=d3f6ae98-6286-435d-bf6d-99a7ca881cab |archivedate=July 13, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stiffness:''' Stiffness is one of the most important properties of paperboard as it affects the ability of cartons to run smoothly through the machine that erects, fills and closes them. Stiffness also gives strength and reduces the propensity of a carton to bulge under the weight of settling flowable contents such as cereals.

Although most paper strength properties increase with increasing sheet density, stiffness does not.  A rule of thumb is that stiffness is proportional to the 1.6 power of sheet caliper.

The species of fiber used has an effect on stiffness, other things being equal.  Northern softwood species impart superior stiffness compared to southern softwoods.

Other factors which affect board stiffness include coatings and moisture content.&lt;ref name="twe"/&gt;

'''Smoothness:''' Smoothness is particularly important when being used for printing, the smoother the paperboard, the better the image quality,  because of better ink coverage. Smoothness is measured using air leak methods – the greater the rate of air leakage, at a specific air pressure, from under a cylindrical knife placed on the surface, the rougher the surface.&lt;ref name="twe"/&gt;

'''Caliper/Thickness:''' In the [[United States]] caliper is usually expressed in thousandths of an inch (0.001”) or points, where a sheet of paperboard with a thickness of 0.024” would be 24 points. In [[Europe]] it is often sold in g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, however the thickness of the board is measured in [[micron]] (μm).

Paperboard also tends to be referred to with thickness rather than weight.&lt;ref name="kir"/&gt;

'''Whiteness:''' It refers ideally to the equal presence of all colours, because a truly white sheet will reflect all [[wavelengths]] of visible light equally.&lt;ref name="twe"/&gt;

==Paperboard industry==

The paperboard sector is mainly looked at in conjunction with the paper industry. The Paper &amp; Paperboard market size (2007) had a value of 630.9 billion USD and a volume of 320.3 million metric tons.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; Of that market 40.1% is European. About 50% of all produced paper is used for packaging, followed by printing and writing.&lt;ref name="ind"/&gt; According to ProCarton, the consumption of paper and paperboard seem to correlate with economic trends (GDP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Dr. Peter Ince |year=1999–2000 |title=Paper, Paperboard and Woodpulp – Production, Consumption and Trade ECE/FAO Forest Products Annual Market Review |accessdate=2009-07-18 |url=http://www.unece.org/timber/docs/rev-00/12.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605234531/http://www.unece.org/timber/docs/rev-00/12.pdf |archivedate=June 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Over 1,100 printers produce 5.4 million tonnes of cartonboard yearly. Cartons make up one third of paper and board packaging and 15% of all packaging. A bit more than half (54%) of the European carton is produced using recovered fibre or waste paper.
The paper and paperboard industry is quite energy and capital intensive. Just a coated board machine itself can cost around 90 - 120 million Euros&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

(about 125 - 166 million USD in 11/2011). Economies of scale apply, because of which a few large players often dominate the market place. E.g. in North America the top 5 producers have a market share of 85%.

With current [[technology]], this [[volume]] is quite small and the plasma is generated as a flat [[plane (mathematics)|plane]] inside a [[cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] space.

Plasma is any [[gas]] that has had its [[atom]]s or [[molecule]]s [[ionization|ionized]] and is a separate [[phase (matter)|phase]] of matter. This is most commonly achieved by heating the gas to extremely high temperatures, although other methods also exist. Plasma becomes increasingly [[viscosity|viscous]] at higher temperatures, to the point where other matter has trouble passing through.

The plasma window was invented at [[Brookhaven National Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =| first =| title =Hot mettle| work =| pages =| language =| publisher =[[New Scientist]]| date =2003-04-12| url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg17823904.800-hot-mettle.html| accessdate = 2008-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Ady Hershcovitch]] and patented in 1995.&lt;ref name=pw_patent&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=5578831.PN.&amp;OS=PN/5578831&amp;RS=PN/5578831|title= United States Patent: 5578831:Hershcovitch (November 26, 1996) Method and apparatus for charged particle propagation|publisher=Patft.uspto.gov|accessdate=2016-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further inventions using this principle include the plasma valve in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=6528948.PN.&amp;OS=PN/6528948&amp;RS=PN/6528948|title= United States Patent: 6528948:Hershcovitch (March 4, 2003) Plasma valve|publisher=Patft.uspto.gov|accessdate=2016-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plasma valve ==
A related technology is the &lt;!-- [[plasma valve]] relink if separate article has been created --&gt;plasma valve, invented shortly after the plasma window. A plasma valve is a layer of gas in the shell of a [[particle accelerator]]. The ring of a particle accelerator contains a vacuum, and ordinarily a breach of this vacuum is disastrous. If, however, an accelerator equipped with plasma valve technology breaches, the gas layer is ionized within a nanosecond, creating a seal that prevents the accelerator's recompression. This gives researchers time to shut off the particle beam in the accelerator and slowly recompress the accelerator ring to avoid damage.

== Properties ==

The physical properties of the plasma window vary depending on application. The initial patent cited temperatures around {{convert|15,000|K|C F}}.

The only limit to the size of the plasma window are current energy limitations as generating the window consumes around 20 kilowatts per inch (8&amp;nbsp;kW/cm) in the diameter of a round window.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

The plasma window emits a bright glow, with the color being dependent on the gas used.

== Similarity to "force fields" ==

In [[science fiction]], such as the [[television]] series ''[[Star Trek]]'', a fictional technology known as the "[[Force field (fiction)|force field]]" is often used as a device. In some cases it is used as an external "door" to [[hangar]]s on [[spacecraft]], to prevent the ship's internal [[atmosphere]] from venting into [[outer space]]. Plasma windows could theoretically serve such a purpose if enough energy were available to produce them.  The [[StarTram]] proposal plans on use of a power-demanding [[Magnetohydrodynamics|MHD]] window over a multi-meter diameter launch tube periodically, but briefly at a time, to prevent excessive loss of vacuum during the moments when a mechanical shutter temporarily opens in advance of a hypervelocity spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startram.com/resources|title=StarTram2010: Maglev Launch: Ultra Low Cost Ultra High Volume Access to Space for Cargo and Humans|publisher=startram.com|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Prodema''' is a [[wood]] based material used for the interior and exterior of buildings.It is made up of natural wood with a [[bakelite]] core. Also known as a composite wooden panel, it has been in use since the early 1900s.
It is renowned for its durability and versatility, ranging in thickness from 6-22mm. Due to its [[Composite material|composite]] properties, Prodema is often used for insulation to structures.

==Uses==
Prodema can be adapted to many forms, including flooring, walls, exterior of buildings, archways, doors, ceilings, furniture. As it comes in panel form, the wood is treated with advanced [[machinery]] and [[chemical]]s to provide a longer life and supported with a selection of metals such as [[aluminium]], [[stainless steel]], and [[iron]].

==Composition==
Prodema is a composite panel faced with a natural wood veneer and coated with a proprietary coating,
based on synthetic resins and PVDF, which protect the panel from the effects of [[sunlight]], chemical
attack (anti-graffiti) and the damage caused by atmospheric agents.

'''[[Renewable energy]]''' is a viable means of generating energy in '''[[Asia]]'''.

For solar power, [[South Asia]] has the ideal combination of both high [[Insolation|solar insolation]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energie-atlas.net/so-100.htm#1-2-101 Energy-Atlas Solar radiation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105230402/http://www.energie-atlas.net/so-100.htm |date=2015-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a high density of potential customers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_detail.php?id=116 NASA population density map] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608063347/http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view_detail.php?id=116 |date=2011-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/01/solar_leds_brig.php Solar LEDs Brighten Rural India's Future]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/3623864.stm Solar plan for Indian computers]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cheap solar]] can bring electricity to a major chunk of subcontinent's people who still live off-grid, bypassing the need of installation of expensive [[Electrical grid|grid lines]]. Also since the costs of energy consumed for temperature control squarely influences a regions [[energy intensity]], and with [[cooling load]] requirements roughly in phase with the sun's intensity, [[Air conditioning|cooling]] from intense solar radiation could make perfect energy-economic sense in the subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solarserver.de/solarmagazin/artikeljuni2002-e.html Solar Cooling] German report&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilkdresden.de/de/leistungen/forall/pdf/vortrag_cooling_applications.pdf Paper presented at the International Conference on Solar Air Conditioning, Germany] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007160149/http://www.ilkdresden.de/de/leistungen/forall/pdf/vortrag_cooling_applications.pdf |date=2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solel.com/products/icooling/solar_cooling/ Solar Cooling - Case Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bangladesh ===
{{Main|Renewable energy in Bangladesh}}
In [[Bangladesh]], biomass, hydro and solar are the main sources of renewable energy and altogether these sources contribute about 60% of the nation's primary energy supply&lt;ref name="Dissertationes Forestales 210 "&gt;{{cite web | url=https://dissertationesforestales.fi/pdf/article1992.pdf | title=Supply and demand of biomass based energy: rural people's perspectives in Bangladesh|date=2015|author=Hassan, Kamrul}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A number of domestic solar energy systems are in use in houses around the country. The use of solar energy on this scale is highly potential and advantageous as more than 60% of areas in the country do not have access to main grid electricity. [[The World Bank]] is backing a program of making solar energy available to wider population in Bangladesh, as part of the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Project (REREDP), which subsidizes solar energy systems.

A typical 'solar home system' can power two to eight 'low energy' lights, plus a socket for TV, radio or battery recharging, and a [[mobile telephone]] charging unit, too.  Each system consists of a [[solar panel|solar photovoltaic panel]], mounted on the house roof. Depending on its size, this provides between 40W and 135W of electricity in full sunlight (the most common being 50W).{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

[[Grameen Shakti]] is the largest organization installing rural based solar home system (SHS) in Bangladesh. Other companies working on similar solar energy based SHS are Rural Services Foundation (RSF), [[Brac, Bangladesh|Brac]], Hilfulfujal and so on. The model of micro finance based SHS is now being copied in other parts of the world as a successful business model.

[[Rahimafrooz]] is a major supplier of high quality solar batteries and other solar components for the program. Rahimafrooz Renewable Energy Ltd (RRE) has been the pioneer in installing solar powered centralized systems, water pumps for irrigation and pure drinking water, water heaters, street lights, and solar-powered telecom solutions to various organizations. They are working closely with pertinent government organizations in installing solar powered medical refrigerator that provides emergency live saving medicines in the off-grid rural areas.

A company named Digital Technology is doing research and development of solar PV products like solar billboard lighting, mini grid system for irrigation etc.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In China there now are six factories producing at least 2 GW/year each of monocrystalline, poly-crystalline and non-crystalline [[Photovoltaic cell]]s. These factories include the [[LDK Solar Co]], Wuxi Suntech Solar Energy Co., Ltd., which produces approximately 50 MW/year of solar cells and [[photovoltaic module]]s; the Yunnan Semi-conductor Parts Plant, which manufactures approximately 2 MW/year of mono-crystalline cells; the Baoding Yingli Solar Energy Modules Plant, which manufactures approximately 6 MW/year of polycrystalline cells and modules; the Shanghai Jiaoda Guofei Solar Energy Battery Factory, which produces approximately 1 MW/year of modules; and the Shanghai PV Science and Technology Co., Ltd., which produces approximately 5 MW/year of modules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwatch.org/node/41 Solar Energy Booming in China]&lt;/ref&gt;

China has become a world leader in the manufacture of solar photovoltaic technology, with its six biggest solar companies having a combined value of over $15 billion. Around 820 megawatts of solar PV were produced in China in 2007, second only to Japan.&lt;ref name="2006 summary"&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90780/91344/6496247.html China pioneers in renewable energy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Suntech Power]] Holdings Co based in [[Jiangsu]], is the world's third- biggest supplier of solar cells.&lt;ref name="bloomberg.com"&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aaIm318czoz8&amp;refer=home China to Be World's Top Manufacturer of Green Energy Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some obstacles to the further development of the Chinese solar energy sector that China faces. These obstacles include the lack of a nationwide comprehensive [[Photovoltaics|photovoltaic]] (PV) plan, the lack of updated facilities and sufficient financial resources to support PV research at research institutes, the lack of sufficient facilities and resources at companies manufacturing PV products, the failure of companies to be able to produce high quality, reliable and low cost PV products and the relatively weak educational and training opportunities in China for PV science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/News/index.cfm?fuseaction=readNews&amp;itemid=1561&amp;language=1 China to train developing nations in solar technologies]&lt;/ref&gt;

About 50 MW of installed solar capacity was added in 2008, more than double the 20 MW in 2007, but still a relatively small amount. According to some studies, the demand in China for new solar modules could be as high as 232 MW each year from now on until  2012. The government has announced plans to expand the installed capacity to 1,800 MW by 2020. If Chinese companies manage to develop low cost, reliable solar modules, then the sky is the limit for a country that is desperate to reduce its dependence on coal and oil imports as well as the pressure on its environment by using renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2009/05/chinas-new-focus-on-solar China's New Focus on Solar | Renewable Energy News Article&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 centre to the PRC Government’s plans is the recently announced "Golden Sun" stimulus program. Under this program the Ministry of Finance will subsidize half of the total construction
costs of an on-grid solar power plant, including transmission expenses. The Ministry of Finance will also pay subsidies of up to 70% to develop independent photovoltaic power generating systems in remote regions. The strong handed move by the Government is meant to encourage more solar projects to increase the current solar power capacity, which at 2008 stood at a paltry 40MW. As the Government targets to increase China’s solar power capacity up to 20GW by 2020,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.renewableenergymagazine.com/paginas/Contenidosecciones.asp?ID=15&amp;Cod=3976&amp;Tipo=&amp;Nombre=PV%20Solar |title= Spain no longer leading the way in PV solar energy |publisher= Renewable energy magazine |date=2009-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; this will provide significant opportunities for solar cell and module manufacturers. Many of the solar industry players therefore will expect for chances to be benefited from the government programs especially the solar cell manufacturers. With the hope of increase in local demand, some of the new developments have been going on with this region, like Anwell Technologies Limited, a Singapore listed company having its solar cell manufacturing plant in China, has produced its first thin film solar panel with its own developed production lines in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.solarbuzz.com/News/NewsASMA255.htm |title= Anwell Produces its First Thin Film Solar Panel |publisher= Solarbuzz |date=2009-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the speech given by the Chinese President Hu Jintao's at the UN climate summit held on September 22, 2009 in New York, China will intensify effort and adopt ambitious plans to plant enough forest to cover an area the size of Norway and use 15 percent of its energy from renewable sources within a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.miamiherald.com/772/story/1245246.html |title= UN climate summit puts China, India in spotlight | publisher= The Miami Herald |date=22 Sep 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solar Resource Map of India.png|thumb|[http://solargis.info/doc/48 Solar Resource Map] of India]]

[[India]] is both densely populated and has high solar [[insolation]], providing an ideal combination for solar power in India. Much of the country does not have an [[electrical grid]], so one of the first applications of solar power has been for water pumping, to begin replacing India's four to five million diesel powered [[water pump]]s, each consuming about 3.5&amp;nbsp;kilowatts, and off-grid lighting. Some large projects have been proposed, and a 35,000&amp;nbsp;km² area of the [[Thar Desert]] has been set aside for [[solar power]] projects, sufficient to generate 700 to 2,100&amp;nbsp;[[gigawatt]]s.

The Indian Solar Loan Programme, supported by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] has won the prestigious [[Energy Globe]] World award for Sustainability for helping to establish a consumer financing program for solar home power systems. Over the span of three years more than 16,000 solar home systems have been financed through 2,000 bank branches, particularly in rural areas of South India where the [[electricity grid]] does not yet extend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energyglobe.info/geg/frontend_en/view.php?MENUEID=138 Consumer financing program for solar home systems in southern India]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ind&gt;[http://www.renewable-energy-world.com/articles/print_screen.cfm?ARTICLE_ID=289927 UNEP wins Energy Globe award] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929071302/http://www.renewable-energy-world.com/articles/print_screen.cfm?ARTICLE_ID=289927 |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Launched in 2003, the Indian Solar Loan Programme was a four-year partnership between UNEP, the UNEP Risoe Centre, and two of India's largest banks, the Canara Bank and Syndicate Bank.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;

According to [[Development Counsellors International]] (DCI), a United States marketing company, India is the second best country, after China, for business investment. [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) has reported that India has seen a 12% increase in investment in the renewable energy sector with an investment of $3.7 billion in 2008. The largest share was asset finance at $3.2 billion which grew by 25%. The clean renewable energy includes wind, solar, biomass and small-hydro projects. The major portion of investment has been made in wind energy sector. The investment in wind energy sector grew at 17% from $2.2 billion to $2.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ecoseed.org/index.php/en/general-news/features/in-depth/4467-indias-solar-mission-how-it-is-harnessing-unlimited-energy |title= India’s solar mission: How it is harnessing unlimited energy | publisher= EcoSeed |date=23 Sep 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solar power in Pakistan discusses the generation and development of electricity via solar thermal or photovoltaic technology in that country. The country has solar plants in Pakistani Kashmir, Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan. Initiatives are under development by the International Renewable Energy Agency, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, Chinese companies, and Pakistani private sector energy companies. The country aims to build the world's largest solar power park, the Quaid-e-Azam Solar Power Park (QASP) in the Cholistan Desert, Punjab, by 2017 with a 1 GW capacity. A plant of this size would be enough to power around 320,000 homes.

====Projects====
====Introduction of Clean Energy by Solar Electricity Generation System====
On May 29, 2012, Pakistan inaugurated its first solar power on-grid power plant in Islamabad. Introduction of Clean Energy by Solar Electricity Generation System is a special grant aid project by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under the Coolio Earth Partnership. This project includes the installation of two 178 kW photovoltaic (PV) systems at the premises of the Planning Commission and Pakistan Engineering Council.

This is the first on-grid solar PV project that employs net-metering, thereby allowing the beneficiaries to sell surplus electricity to the Islamabad Electric Supply Company (IESCO), the electricity distribution company of the Islamabad Division. The project was executed with grant assistance, worth 480 million Yen (approx. 553.63 million Pakistani Rupees) over three years commencing in 2010.

====Other projects====

Aviation Enclave Karachi installed the first high quality integrated solar energy system with a 15 kW power generation capacity capable of grid tie-in at, Aviation Enclave Karachi in Sep 2016. It was a pilot project for Central Facilitation Agency &amp; Central Builders &amp; Developers{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} 

Beaconhouse installed the second high quality integrated solar energy system with a 10 kW power generation capacity capable of grid tie-in at Beaconhouse Canal Side Campus, Lahore. It was a pilot project for BSS designed by U.S. consultants, based upon feasibility by the U.S. Trade and Development Agency (USTDA).

50 to 100 MW of photovoltaics is expected to be installed in 2013, and at least 300 MW in 2014. In May 2015, 100 MW of a planned 1,000 MW were installed in the Quaid-e-Azam Solar Park.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

====Annual solar irradiation====
Solar irradiance in Pakistan is 5.3 kWh/m²/day. Pakistan set a target to add approximately 10 GW of renewable capacity by 2030 in addition to replacing 5% diesel with biodiesel by 2015 and 10% by 2025.

====Government policy====
Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, former Federal Minister of Water &amp; Power announced on July 2, 2009 that 7,000 villages would be electrified using solar energy by 2014. Senior adviser Sardar Zulfiqar Khosa stated that the Punjab government would begin new projects aimed at power production through coal, solar energy and wind power; this would generate additional resources.

The Government of Pakistan allowed the provincial government of Sindh to conduct feasibility research. The government planned to install a desalination plant powered by solar energy.

[[File:Bangui Windfarm Ilocos Norte 2007.jpg|thumb|[[Bangui Wind Farm]] in [[Ilocos Norte]], [[Philippines]]]]
The [[Philippines|Philippine]] government sees the growth of the renewable energy sector essential for national energy security. The Philippines' fossil fuel sector is unsustainable, being dependent on the import of nonrenewable fuel, including petroleum, but has significant potential in the renewable energy sector. Based on a report of an Australian consulting firm, International Energy Consultants, the Philippines has the highest electricity rate in Asia, followed by [[Japan]]. Transmitting power and transporting fuel throughout the Philippine archipelago is problematic due to very high cost.&lt;ref name=manila.b&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/325264/the-right-mix-the-philippines-achieving-its-renewable-energy-goals The Right Mix: The Philippines Achieving its Renewable Energy Goals], ''Manila Bulletin''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippines could be considered a world leader in renewable energy, with 30 percent of its power generation being powered by the renewable energy sector. The Philippines is the world's second largest generator of geothermal energy and was the first [[Southeast Asia]]n nation to invest in large-scale solar and wind technologies.&lt;ref name=manila.b /&gt;

=== South Korea ===
In 2008, South Korea came 4th in the list of installed PV capacity according to EPIA statistics as a result of the favorable feed-in tariff system with a cap of 500MW in 2008. According to Displaybank, the new “PV Market Creation Plan” announced in 2009 is expected to boost the Korean PV installment market to increase to 200MW by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://globalsolartechnology.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=4232&amp;Itemid=9 |title= Korea PV market expected to reach 200MW by 2012 | publisher= Global Solar Technology |date=October 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.solarplaza.com/article/report-korean-solar-energy-market-indicates-growt |title= Korean solar energy market indicates growth slowing down | publisher= Solar Plaza |date=September 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government further announced plans to increase more than double its financing for renewable R&amp;D projects to 3.5 trillion won ($2.9/£1.9bn) by 2013.

'''Robert Leroy “Bob” Hunt''' (b. 1933&lt;ref name=WCHF&gt;[http://www.wchf.org/inductees/huntrobertl.html] The Wisconsin Conservation Hall of Fame&lt;/ref&gt;) is a fisheries biologist. He grew up in [[McFarland, Wisconsin]], on [[Lake Waubesa]]. He served in the US Army, then attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree. He joined the Wisconsin Conservation Department in 1959. 
He did pioneering research on wild trout conservation, and led efforts to save streams from damage done by cattle operations and human activities. He won numerous national and international awards for his research and conservation work.&lt;ref name=WCHF/&gt; He wrote the book "Trout Stream Therapy" in 1993. He served as president of the Wisconsin chapter of the American Fisheries Society in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;"Trout stream therapy,"  University of Wisconsin Press, 1993. {{ISBN|978-0299138943}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied troutstream rehabilitation project and developed a system for evaluating the results of a project. His work showed that altering the stream habitat by modifying the creek banks with more overhanging cover could triple the weight of trout in a stream over a six year period.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=0n1INERR3-sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22robert+l+hunt%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=opVoUZHzIIm6yAHq6YBw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADge#v=onepage&amp;q=hunt&amp;f=false]"Better Trout Habitat: A Guide To Stream Restoration And Management, Christopher J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3427">The '''Rock Island Clean Line''' is a proposed 500-mile [[high voltage direct current]] (HVDC) [[Electric power transmission|transmission line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.suntimes.com/business/11101405-420/deal-with-downstate-ill-cable-plant-to-bring-1450-jobs.html |title=Deal with Downstate cable plant to bring 1,450 jobs |publisher=Chicago Sun-Times |date=2012-03-06 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826062938/http://www.suntimes.com/business/11101405-420/deal-with-downstate-ill-cable-plant-to-bring-1450-jobs.html |archivedate=2012-08-26 |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2016-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The stated purpose of the line is to transport electrical power from wind energy dense states in the [[Midwestern United States]] ([[Iowa]], [[Nebraska]], [[South Dakota]] and [[Minnesota]]) to the energy markets in the [[Chicago, Illinois]], and cities further east.  The planned line would run from the [[Sanborn, Iowa]] area to near [[Morris, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockislandcleanline.com/site/page/location |title=Maps &amp; Location |publisher=Rock Island Clean Line |accessdate=2016-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The developer, [[Clean Line Energy Partners]], is targeting an operational date of 2017.

The region where the line would start has large potential for wind generation, but currently already can produce all the electricity it can use or transport out of the region on existing transmission lines.&lt;ref name="mwen"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.midwestenergynews.com/2011/12/05/new-transmission-line-would-ease-iowa-wind-power-bottleneck/ |title=New transmission line would ease Iowa wind bottleneck |last=Haugen |first=Dan |publisher=Midwest Energy News |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2016-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The line would have the capacity to transport up to 3500 megawatts of power out of the region.&lt;ref name="mwen" /&gt; An economic study for the line estimates that it could transmit the power of eight 500&amp;nbsp;MW wind farms in the [[siouxland]] area.&lt;ref name=a1&gt;{{cite report|last1=Carlson|first1=J. Lon|last2=Loomis|first2=David G.|last3=Solow|first3=John L.|title=Economic Impact Study of the Proposed Rock Island Clean Line|publisher=Loomis Consulting|url=http://www.rockislandcleanline.com/sites/rock_island/media/docs/RICL%20Economic%20Impact%20Study.pdf|date=2011-03-16|accessdate=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal Electricity Regulatory Commission approved the line in May 2012. In November 2014, the Illinois Commerce Commission approved it. {{as of|January 2016}}, the Iowa Utilities Board has not yet approved it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockislandcleanline.com/site/page/regulatory-approvals |title=Regulatory Approvals |publisher=Rock Island Clean Line |accessdate=2016-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the Rock Island Clean Line is organized by Block RICL, which claims that the line will carry mostly non-wind energy (i.e., coal) and will use an unreasonably large amount of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.blockricl.com/about-ricl |title=About RICL |publisher=Block RICL |accessdate=2016-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''SS ''Wafra'' oil spill''' occurred on 27 February 1971, when SS ''Wafra'', an [[oil tanker]], ran aground while under tow near [[Cape Agulhas]], South Africa. Approximately 200,000 barrels of crude oil were leaked into the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.incidentnews.gov/incident/6213 "Wafra"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017222011/http://incidentnews.gov/incident/6213 |date=17 October 2011 }}.

Incident News. 27 February 1971. Retrieved 23 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The larger part of the ship was refloated, towed out to sea, and then sunk by the [[South African Air Force]] to prevent further oil contamination of the coastline.

The ship was rounding the southern tip of Africa at 6:30 am on 27 February 1971 when the piping that brought seawater on board to cool her [[steam turbine]] failed.  The engine room flooded, incapacitating the ship.  She was taken under tow the following day by the Russian steam tanker ''Gdynia'', which – finding the task too difficult – handed the tow over to the ''Pongola'' {{convert|7|mi|km}} off [[Cape Agulhas]], later the same day.&lt;ref name="ctx"/&gt;  The tow cable subsequently broke, and the ''Wafra'' grounded on a reef near Cape Agulhas at 5:30 pm on 28 February.  All six of the port cargo tanks, as well as two of the six center tanks, were ruptured, resulting in approximately 26,000 tons of oil leaking at the grounding site, of which 6,000 tonnes washed up at Cape Agulhas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pulse of the Planet: A State of the Earth Report from the Smithsonian Institution Center for Short-lived Phenomena|author1=Cornell, James |author2=Surowiecki, John |isbn=0-517-50065-5|publisher=Harmony Books|year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A {{convert|20|mi|km|adj=on}} by {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} oil spill resulted,&lt;ref name="NOAA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Devanney"/&gt; which affected a colony of 1200&amp;nbsp;[[African penguin]]s on Dyer Island near [[Gansbaai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a4sIbHJ8AVsC&amp;pg=PA343|page=343|title=Marine Pollution: New Research|author=Hofer, Tobias N.|publisher=Nova Publishers|year=2008|isbn=9781604562422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ship was refloated and pulled off the reef on 8 March by the German tug [[:de:Oceanic (Schiff, 1969)|''Oceanic'']], but started to break apart.  To prevent further oil contamination of the coastline, the larger section was towed {{convert|200|mi|km}} out to sea to the edge of the continental shelf ({{coord|36|57|S|20|42|E|display=inline}}), leaving a {{convert|160|km|mi|adj=on}} oil slick in her wake.  On 10 March 1971, [[Blackburn Buccaneer|Buccaneer]] aircraft of the [[South African Air Force]] attempted to sink her with [[AS-30L|AS-30]] missiles, but succeeded only in starting a fire.  The ship burned for two days before a [[Avro Shackleton|Shackleton]] aircraft was eventually able to sink it with [[depth charge]]s in {{convert|1830|m|ft}} of water.

If the ''Wafra'' had been a twin screw, two engine room ship, loss of an engine would most likely not have caused the loss of the whole ship.&lt;ref name="Devanney"/&gt;  At the time, the oil spill was in the top twenty most disastrous tanker spills on record.&lt;ref name="Devanney"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.c4tx.org/ctx/pub/tromedy2.pdf|title=The Tankship Tromedy: The Impending Disasters in Tankers|page=110|author=Devanney, Jack|location=Tavernier, Florida|year=2006|isbn=978-0-977-64790-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In the wake of the accident, the South African Department of Transport realised that despite many Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) using the Cape sea route each year, the authorities did not have ocean-going tugs that were able to assist them in distress, and to protect sensitive marine areas by breaking up oil spills with chemical dispersants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1986|publisher=South Africa Dept of Information|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IOcwAQAAIAAJ|title=South African Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They therefore set up an oil spill prevention service known as ''Kuswag'' (Coastwatch) and commissioned two new salvage tugs, the ''John Ross'' and ''Wolrade Woltemade''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ports.co.za/didyouknow/article_2004_04_26_0125.html|title=Historical Review of SA Oil Pollution Service|publisher=Ports and Ships|author=Hutson, Terry|date=31 January 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two tugs, with their {{convert|26200|hp|kW}} engines, held the record as the world's largest salvage tugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Total Book of South African Records|author=Rosenthal, Eric|publisher=Delta Books|year=1982|isbn=0-908387-19-9|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sandwich Plate System''' ('''SPS''') is a structural composite material composed of steel and [[polyurethane]] elastomer.

SPS is used in engineered structures including ships, buildings, stadia, arenas and bridges and was invented by [[Dr Stephen Kennedy]] following his primary research in the field of ice strengthened structures at [[Carleton University]] in Ottawa and first patented in 1996.

The SPS technology is a direct replacement for stiffened steel and reinforced concrete in heavy engineering projects.

The first recorded project involving SPS was carried out on the [[P&amp;O Ferries|P&amp;O]] Pride of Cherbourg, a [[Lloyd’s Register]] approved vessel, in 1999 and over 200 projects have been completed to date.

==Projects==

A '''seaweed cultivator''' is a device which grows [[seaweed]], usually in weekly or bi-weekly cycles. It is not to be confused with people who are seaweed cultivators themselves, usually performing manual cultivation of seaweed using large [[Net (device)|net]]s in open waters (mainly in Asian countries).

Seaweed cultivators (the devices) are just now becoming available to the public, mainly because of the LED ([[light-emitting diode]]) which has made low-cost, reliable, and waterproof illumination sources (especially in the red 660-nanometer spectrum) feasible. Seaweed cultivators are an offshoot of [[algae scrubber]]s, which were developed to [[Filter (aquarium)|filter aquariums]]. By replacing the aquarium with a reservoir of fertilized [[seawater]], a stand-alone cultivator becomes possible, and even a desktop cultivator is possible if the size is small enough or if the reservoir is placed beneath the desk.

The type of seaweed that can be grown in a seaweed cultivator is currently limited to green types, mostly Angel Hair and [[sea lettuce]], because other types such as Nori require more complex control of the water temperature and other variables. Angel Hair and sea lettuce, however, can be grown at home at room temperature.

'''Sedimentation''' is the tendency for [[particle (ecology)|particle]]s in [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]] to settle out of the fluid in which they are entrained and come to rest against a barrier. This is due to their motion through the fluid in response to the forces acting on them: these forces can be due to [[gravitation|gravity]], [[centrifugal acceleration]], or [[electromagnetism]]. In geology, sedimentation is often used as the opposite of erosion, i.e., the terminal end of [[sediment transport]]. In that sense, it includes the termination of transport by [[Saltation (geology)|saltation]] or true [[bedload|bedload transport]]. [[Settling]] is the falling of suspended particles through the liquid, where as sedimentation is the termination of the settling process. In estuarine environments, settling can be influenced by the presence or absence of vegetation. Trees such as mangroves are crucial to the attenuation of waves or currents, promoting the settlement of suspended particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Santen|first=P.|last2=Augustinus|first2=P. G. E. F.|last3=Janssen-Stelder|first3=B. M.|last4=Quartel|first4=S.|last5=Tri|first5=N. H.|date=2007-02-15|title=Sedimentation in an estuarine mangrove system|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1367912006002069|journal=Journal of Asian Earth Sciences|series=Morphodynamics of the Red River Delta, Vietnam|volume=29|issue=4|pages=566–575|doi=10.1016/j.jseaes.2006.05.011|bibcode=2007JAESc..29..566V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sedimentation may pertain to objects of various sizes, ranging from large rocks in flowing water to [[suspension (chemistry)|suspensions]] of dust and pollen [[particle (ecology)|particles]] to [[cell (biology)|cell]]ular suspensions to [[solution]]s of single [[molecule]]s such as [[protein]]s and [[peptide]]s.  Even small molecules supply a sufficiently strong force to produce significant sedimentation.

The term is typically used in geology to describe the [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] of [[sediment]] which results in the formation of [[sedimentary rock]], but it is also used in various chemical and environmental fields to describe the motion of often-smaller particles and molecules. This process is also used in the biotech industry to separate cells from the culture media.

==Experiments==
In a sedimentation experiment, the applied force accelerates the particles to a [[terminal velocity]] &lt;math&gt;v_\mathrm{term}&lt;/math&gt; at which the applied force is exactly canceled by an opposing drag force.  For small enough particles (low [[Reynolds number]]), the drag force varies linearly with the [[terminal velocity]], i.e., &lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{drag} = f v_\mathrm{term}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Stokes flow]]) where ''f'' depends only on the properties of the particle and the surrounding fluid. Similarly, the applied force generally varies linearly with some coupling constant (denoted here as ''q'') that depends only on the properties of the particle, &lt;math&gt;F_\mathrm{app} = q E_\mathrm{app}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, it is generally possible to define a [[sedimentation coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;s \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\   q/f&lt;/math&gt; that depends only on the  properties of the particle and the surrounding fluid.  Thus, measuring ''s'' can reveal underlying properties of the particle.

In many cases, the motion of the particles is blocked by a hard boundary; the resulting accumulation of particles at the boundary is called a [[sediment]]. The concentration of particles at the boundary is opposed by the [[diffusion]] of the particles.

The sedimentation of a single particle under gravity is described by the [[Mason–Weaver equation]], which has a simple exact solution. The sedimentation coefficient ''s'' in this case equals &lt;math&gt;m_{b}/f&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m_{b}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[buoyant mass]].

The sedimentation of a single particle under [[centrifugal force]] is described by the [[Lamm equation]], which likewise has an exact solution. The sedimentation coefficient ''s'' also equals &lt;math&gt;m_{b}/f&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;m_{b}&lt;/math&gt; is the buoyant mass. However, the Lamm equation differs from the Mason–Weaver equation because the centrifugal force depends on radius from the origin of rotation, whereas in the Mason–Weaver equation gravity is constant.  The Lamm equation also has extra terms, since it pertains to [[Circular sector|sector]]-shaped cells, whereas the Mason–Weaver equation is one-dimensional.

Classification of sedimentation:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coe|first1=H.S.|last2=Clevenger|first2=G.H.|title=Methods for determining the capacities of slime-settling tanks|journal=Transactions of the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers|date=1916|volume=55|page=356}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Type 1 sedimentation is characterized by particles that settle discretely at a constant settling velocity,or by the deposition of Iron-Rich minerals to streamlines down to the point source. They settle as individual particles and do not flocculate or stick to other during settling.  Example: sand and grit material
*Type 2 sedimentation is characterized by particles that flocculate during sedimentation and because of this their size is constantly changing and therefore their settling velocity is changing.  Example: alum or iron coagulation
*Type 3 sedimentation is also known as zone sedimentation. In this process the particles are at a high concentration (greater than 1000&amp;nbsp;mg/L) such that the particles tend to settle as a mass and a distinct clear zone and sludge zone are present. Zone settling occurs in lime-softening, sedimentation, active sludge sedimentation and sludge thickeners.

==Geology==
[[File:Siltation or Sedimentation.jpg|thumb|Siltation]]
In [[geology]], sedimentation is the deposition of particles carried by a fluid flow. For [[suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] load, this can be expressed mathematically by the [[Exner equation]], and results in the formation of depositional [[landform]]s and the rocks that constitute [[depositional record|sedimentary record]]. An undesired increased transport and sedimentation of suspended material is called [[siltation]], and it is a major source of pollution in waterways in some parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;

A '''severe thunderstorm outbreak''', also called a '''severe weather outbreak''' or simply a '''severe outbreak''', is an event in which a weather system or combination of weather systems produces a multitude of [[severe thunderstorm]]s in a region over a continuous span of time. A severe outbreak which is most notable for its [[tornadoes]] is called a [[tornado outbreak]]. The four kinds of severe weather produced in these outbreaks are [[tornadoes]], severe wind, large hail, and [[flash flooding]].

==Types==

===Tornado outbreak===
{{Main|Tornado outbreak}}
{{see also|Tornado warning|Tornado watch}}
A Tornado outbreak is the occurrence of multiple tornadoes in a region over a relatively short span of time. Usually, a tornado outbreak is the result of multiple [[supercell]]s.

===Derecho or other squall line===
{{Main|Derecho|Squall line}}
{{see also|Severe thunderstorm warning|Severe thunderstorm watch}}
A squall line (commonly abbreviated SQLN) is a line of thunderstorms, most or all of which have attained [[Severe thunderstorm warning|severe]] limits, traveling in an organized fashion. The greatest threats within a SQLN are damaging [[winds]], large [[hail]], and [[flash flooding]], though tornadoes are possible.

A derecho is a squall line which is long-lived and consistently produces damaging winds across its entire track. Derechos almost exclusively cause flash flooding and wind damage, which can be very severe.

===Mesoscale convective system===
{{Main|Mesoscale convective system}}
{{see also|Severe thunderstorm warning|Severe thunderstorm watch}}
A mesoscale convective system is a [[mesoscale meteorology|mesoscale]] organized system which may produce severe weather along a relatively narrow area or path. The greatest threats in an mesoscale convective system are damaging [[winds]], large [[hail]], and [[flash flooding]], though [[tornadoes]] are occasionally possible.

===Mesoscale convective vortex===
{{Main|Mesoscale convective vortex}}
{{see also|Storm warning|High wind warning|Gale warning|Hurricane force wind warning}}
A mesoscale convective vortex is a [[tropical cyclone]]-like, [[warm core]], a feature which may develop in a squall line, derecho, or MCS. Severe MCVs can become what are essentially small tropical storms or hurricanes, and, can in fact become such cyclones. An MCV will often trail a squall line on its south side. The greatest threats in an MCV are (in the center of circulation and south of the center) extreme [[winds]] and (north of the center) [[flash flooding]], in addition to [[#tropical cyclone|tropical cyclone]] formation.

'''Silicon carbide''' ('''SiC'''), also known as '''carborundum''' {{IPAc-en|k|ɑr|b|ə|ˈ|r|ʌ|n|d|əm}}, is a [[semiconductor]] containing [[silicon]] and [[carbon]]. It occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral [[moissanite]]. Synthetic SiC powder has been mass-produced since 1893 for use as an [[abrasive]]. Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by [[sintering]] to form very hard [[ceramic]]s that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and [[ceramic plate]]s in [[bulletproof vest]]s. Electronic applications of silicon carbide such as [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) and [[Cat's whisker detector|detector]]s in early radios were first demonstrated around 1907. SiC is used in semiconductor electronics devices that operate at high temperatures or high voltages, or both. Large single crystals of silicon carbide can be grown by the [[Lely method]] and they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite. SiC with high surface area can be produced from SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contained in plant material.

==History==

===Early experiments===
Non-systematic, less-recognized and often unverified syntheses of silicon carbide include:
* [[Jöns Jacob Berzelius|J. J. Berzelius]]'s reduction of potassium fluorosilicate by potassium (1810)
* [[César-Mansuète Despretz]]'s passing an electric current through a carbon rod embedded in sand (1849)
* Robert Sydney Marsden's dissolution of silica in molten silver in a graphite crucible (1881)
* [[Paul Schützenberger|Paul Schuetzenberger]]'s heating of a mixture of silicon and silica in a graphite crucible (1881)
* Albert Colson's heating of silicon under a stream of ethylene (1882).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ObwHdIT0C0QC| page =115|title = Carbide, nitride, and boride materials synthesis and processing|author = Weimer, A.

===Wide-scale production===

[[File:SiC LED historic.jpg|thumb|left|A replication of H. J. Round's LED experiments]]

Wide-scale production is credited to [[Edward Goodrich Acheson]] in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica, [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/544369/silicon-carbide/6673/Discovery eb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Acheson was  attempting to prepare artificial diamonds when he heated a mixture of clay (aluminium silicate) and powdered [[coke (fuel)|coke]] (carbon) in an iron bowl.  He called the blue crystals that formed ''carborundum'', believing it to be a new compound of carbon and aluminium, similar to [[corundum]].  In 1893, [[Henri Moissan|Ferdinand Henri Moissan]] discovered the very rare naturally occurring SiC mineral while examining rock samples found in the [[Canyon Diablo (meteorite)|Canyon Diablo meteorite]] in Arizona.  The mineral was named moissanite in his honor.   Moissan also synthesized SiC by several routes, including dissolution of carbon in molten silicon, melting a mixture of calcium carbide and silica, and by reducing silica with carbon in an electric furnace.

[[Acheson process|Acheson patented the method]] for making silicon carbide powder on February 28, 1893.&lt;ref&gt;Acheson, G. (1893) {{US patent|492767}} "Production of artificial crystalline carbonaceous material"&lt;/ref&gt; Acheson also developed the electric batch [[furnace]] by which SiC is still made today and formed the Carborundum Company to manufacture bulk SiC, initially for use as an abrasive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal =[[Scientific American]]| url =http://www.scientificamericanpast.com/Scientific%20American%201890%20to%201899/5/lg/sci471894.htm| date =April 7, 1894| title =The Manufacture of Carborundum- a New Industry| accessdate =2009-06-06| deadurl =yes| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20090123041207/http://www.scientificamericanpast.com/Scientific%20American%201890%20to%201899/5/lg/sci471894.htm| archivedate =January 23, 2009| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 the company settled with the [[Electric Smelting and Aluminum Company]] when a judge's decision gave "priority broadly" to its founders "for reducing ores and other substances by the incandescent method".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mabery, Charles F.|title=Notes, On Carborundum|pages=706–707|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fBIDAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA706|year=1900|volume=XXII|issue=Part II|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|publisher=Johnson Reprint Company, via Google Books scan of Harvard University copy|accessdate=2007-10-28|doi=10.1021/ja02048a014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that Acheson was trying to dissolve carbon in molten [[corundum]] ([[alumina]]) and discovered the presence of hard, blue-black crystals which he believed to be a compound of carbon and corundum: hence carborundum. It may be that he named the material "carborundum" by analogy to corundum, which is another very hard substance (9 on the [[Mohs scale]]).

The first use of SiC was as an abrasive. This was followed by electronic applications. In the beginning of the 20th century, silicon carbide was used as a detector in the first radios.&lt;ref&gt;Dunwoody, Henry H.C. (1906) {{US patent|837616}} ''Wireless telegraph system'' (silicon carbide detector)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1907 [[Henry Joseph Round]] produced the first LED by applying a voltage to a SiC crystal and observing yellow, green and orange emission at the cathode. Those experiments were later repeated by [[Oleg Losev|O. V. Losev]] in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="ultraviolet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~hightech/fpd/papers/ELDs.html|title=A History of Electroluminescent Displays|last=Hart|first=Jeffrey A.|author2=Stefanie Ann Lenway |author3=Thomas Murtha }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Natural occurrence==
[[File:Moissanite-USGS-20-1001d-14x-.jpg|thumb|Moissanite single crystal (≈1 mm in size)]]
Naturally occurring [[moissanite]] is found in only minute quantities in certain types of [[meteorite]] and in corundum deposits and [[kimberlite]]. Virtually all the silicon carbide sold in the world, including moissanite jewels, is [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]]. Natural moissanite was first found in 1893 as a small component of the [[Canyon Diablo meteorite]] in [[Arizona]] by Dr. [[Henri Moissan|Ferdinand Henri Moissan]], after whom the material was named in 1905.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Moissan, Henri|title = Nouvelles recherches sur la météorité de Cañon Diablo|year = 1904|journal = [[Comptes rendus]]|volume = 139| pages = 773–86| url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30930/f773.table}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moissan's discovery of naturally occurring SiC was initially disputed because his sample may have been contaminated by silicon carbide [[saw blade]]s that were already on the market at that time.&lt;ref name = pierro&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Di Pierro S. |author2=Gnos E. |author3=Grobety B.H. |author4=Armbruster T. |author5=Bernasconi S.M. |author6=Ulmer P.  |last-author-amp=yes |year = 2003|title = Rock-forming moissanite (natural α-silicon carbide)|journal = American Mineralogist|volume = 88|pages = 1817–21|url = http://www.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/georef/2004018181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While rare on Earth, silicon carbide is remarkably common in space. It is a common form of [[Cosmic dust|stardust]] found around [[Carbon star|carbon-rich stars]], and examples of this stardust have been found in pristine condition in primitive (unaltered) meteorites. The silicon carbide found in space and in meteorites is almost exclusively the [[Polymorphism (materials science)|beta-polymorph]]. Analysis of SiC grains found in the [[Murchison meteorite]], a [[carbonaceous chondrite]] meteorite, has revealed anomalous isotopic ratios of carbon and silicon, indicating that these grains originated outside the solar system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://img.chem.ucl.ac.uk/www/kelly/history.htm|author=Kelly, Jim |work=University College London|title =The Astrophysical Nature of Silicon Carbide| accessdate = 2009-06-06|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504052500/http://img.chem.ucl.ac.uk/www/kelly/history.htm|archivedate=May 4, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==

[[File:SiC crystals.JPG|thumb|Synthetic SiC crystals ~3 mm in diameter]]

Because natural moissanite is extremely scarce, most silicon carbide is synthetic. Silicon carbide is used as an abrasive, as well as a [[semiconductor]] and [[diamond simulant]] of gem quality. The simplest process to manufacture silicon carbide is to combine [[silica]] [[sand]] and carbon in an [[Acheson process|Acheson graphite electric resistance furnace]] at a high temperature, between {{convert|1600|C|F}} and {{convert|2500|C|F}}. Fine SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; particles in plant material (e.g. rice husks) can be converted to SiC by heating in the excess carbon from the organic material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Vlasov, A.S. et alia|title = Obtaining silicon carbide from rice husks| journal = Refractories and Industrial Ceramics|volume = 32|issue = 9–10|year = 1991| pages=521–523| doi=10.1007/bf01287542}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[silica fume]], which is a byproduct of producing silicon metal and ferrosilicon alloys, can also be converted to SiC by heating with graphite at {{convert|1500|C|F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Zhong, Y. |author2=Shaw, Leon L. |author3=Manjarres, Misael |author4=Zawrah, Mahmoud F.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title = Synthesis of Silicon Carbide Nanopowder Using Silica Fume | journal = Journal of American Ceramic Society | volume = 93|year =2010| pages=3159–3167 | doi= 10.1111/j.1551-2916.2010.03867.x| issue = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The material formed in the Acheson furnace varies in purity, according to its distance from the [[graphite]] [[resistor]] [[heating element|heat source]]. Colorless, pale yellow and green crystals have the highest purity and are found closest to the resistor. The color changes to blue and black at greater distance from the resistor, and these darker crystals are less pure. Nitrogen and aluminium are common impurities, and they affect the electrical conductivity of SiC.&lt;ref name=growth/&gt;

[[File:Lely SiC Crystal.jpg|thumb|Synthetic SiC Lely crystals]]

Pure silicon carbide can be made by the [[Lely process]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lely, Jan Anthony | title = Darstellung von Einkristallen von Silicium Carbid und Beherrschung von Art und Menge der eingebauten Verunreinigungen | journal = Berichte der Deutschen Keramischen Gesellschaft | volume = 32 | pages = 229–236 | year = 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which SiC powder is sublimed into high-temperature species of silicon, carbon, silicon dicarbide (SiC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and   disilicon carbide (Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C) in an [[argon]] gas ambient at 2500&amp;nbsp;°C and redeposited into flake-like single crystals,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nitride-crystals.com/Lely-Wafers.htm Lely SiC Wafers].

This process yields high-quality single crystals, mostly of 6H-SiC phase (because of high growth temperature).

A modified Lely process involving [[induction heating]] in graphite [[crucible]]s yields even larger single crystals of 4&amp;nbsp;inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm) in diameter, having a section 81 times larger compared to the conventional Lely process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://www.nsc.co.jp/en/tech/report/pdf/8407.pdf| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217002122/http://www.nsc.co.jp/en/tech/report/pdf/8407.pdf| archivedate=2010-12-17|title = Nippon Steel Technical Report no.&amp;nbsp;84 : Large high-quality silicon carbide substrates| author = Ohtani, N.|year = 2001|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alpha silicon carbide (α-SiC) is the most commonly encountered [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorph]]. It's formed at temperatures greater than 1700&amp;nbsp;°C and has a [[hexagonal (crystal system)|hexagonal]] [[crystal structure]] (similar to [[Wurtzite]]). The beta modification (β-SiC), with a [[zincblende (crystal structure)|zinc blende crystal structure]] (similar to [[diamond cubic|diamond]]), is formed at temperatures below 1700&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=muranaka/&gt; Until recently, the beta form has had relatively few commercial uses, although there is now increasing interest in its use as a support for heterogeneous catalysts, owing to its higher surface area compared to the alpha form.

Pure SiC is colorless. The brown to black color of the industrial product results from [[iron]] impurities.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} The rainbow-like luster of the crystals is caused by a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation layer]] of [[silicon dioxide]] that forms on the surface.

The high sublimation temperature of SiC (approximately 2700&amp;nbsp;°C) makes it useful for [[bearing (mechanical)|bearings]] and furnace parts. Silicon carbide does not melt at any known temperature. It is also highly inert chemically. There is currently much interest in its use as a [[semiconductor material]] in electronics, where its high thermal conductivity, high [[electric field]] breakdown strength and high maximum [[Current (electricity)|current]] density make it more promising than silicon for high-powered devices.&lt;ref name=baliga/&gt; SiC also has a very low [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] (4.0 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;/K) and experiences no [[phase transition]]s that would cause discontinuities in thermal expansion.&lt;ref name=growth/&gt;

===Electrical conductivity===
Silicon carbide is a [[semiconductor]], which can be doped n-type by [[nitrogen]] or [[phosphorus]] and p-type by [[beryllium]], [[boron]], [[aluminium]], or [[gallium]].&lt;ref name=ioffe/&gt; Metallic conductivity has been achieved by heavy doping with boron, aluminium or nitrogen.

[[Superconductivity]] has been detected in 3C-SiC:Al, 3C-SiC:B and 6H-SiC:B at the same temperature of 1.5 K.&lt;ref name=muranaka&gt;{{cite journal|author = Muranaka, T.|journal = Sci. Technol. Adv.

Whereas boron substitutes carbon in SiC, Al substitutes Si sites. Therefore, Al and B "see" different environments that might explain different properties of SiC:Al and SiC:B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Yanase, Y.  |author2=Yorozu, N. |lastauthoramp=yes |title =Superconductivity in compensated and uncompensated semiconductors|pmc=5099632|journal = Sci.

==Uses==

===Abrasive and cutting tools===
[[File:Ultra-thin separated (Carborundum) disk.jpg|thumb|Cutting disks made of SiC]]

In the arts, silicon carbide is a popular abrasive in modern [[lapidary]] due to the durability and low cost of the material. In manufacturing, it is used for its hardness in [[abrasive machining]] processes such as [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], [[Honing (metalworking)|honing]], [[water-jet cutting]] and [[sandblasting]]. Particles of silicon carbide are laminated to paper to create [[sandpaper]]s and the grip tape on [[skateboard]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Fuster, Marco A. (1997) "Skateboard grip tape", {{US patent|5622759}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 an exceptionally strong composite of [[aluminium oxide]] and silicon carbide [[whisker (metallurgy)|whiskers]] was discovered. Development of this laboratory-produced composite to a commercial product took only three years. In 1985, the first commercial cutting tools made from this alumina and silicon carbide whisker-reinforced composite were introduced into the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=oSYdgu3on_oC| page = 312| title= Handbook of ceramic composites| author = Bansal, Narottam P.| publisher = Springer| year = 2005| isbn = 1-4020-8133-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural material===

In the 1980s and 1990s, silicon carbide was studied in several research programs for high-temperature gas turbines in [[Europe]], [[Japan]] and the [[United States]]. The components were intended to replace [[nickel]] [[superalloy]] [[turbine]] blades or nozzle vanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Production of Silicon Carbide|url=http://siliconcarbide.net/|website=siliconcarbide.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, none of these projects resulted in a production quantity, mainly because of its low impact resistance and its low fracture [[toughness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.unipass.com/predictionprobe/Industry%20News/Ceramics%20for%20turbine%20engines.htm| title = Ceramics for turbine engines| accessdate = 2009-06-06| work = unipass.com| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090406052441/http://www.unipass.com/predictionprobe/Industry%20News/Ceramics%20for%20turbine%20engines.htm| archivedate = 2009-04-06| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other hard ceramics (namely alumina and [[boron carbide]]), silicon carbide is used in [[composite armour|composite armor]] (e.g. [[Chobham armour|Chobham armor]]), and in ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. [[Dragon Skin (body armor)|Dragon Skin]], which was produced by [[Pinnacle Armor]], used disks of silicon carbide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.futurefirepower.com/dragon-skin-most-protective-body-armor-lightweight| title = Dragon Skin – Most Protective Body Armor – Lightweight| accessdate = 2009-06-06| publisher = Future Firepower| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/67AWa5q6N?url=http://www.futurefirepower.com/dragon-skin-most-protective-body-armor-lightweight| archivedate = 2012-04-24| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silicon carbide is used as a support and shelving material in high temperature kilns such as for firing ceramics, glass fusing, or glass casting. SiC kiln shelves are considerably lighter and more durable than traditional alumina shelves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://ceramicartsdaily.org/glossary/silicon-carbide/ | title = Silicon Carbide | publisher = Ceramic Arts Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, infusion of silicon carbide nano-particles in molten [[magnesium]] was mentioned as a way to produce a new strong and plastic alloy suitable for use in aeronautics, aerospace, automobile and micro-electronics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-researchers-create-exceptionally-strong-and-lightweight-new-metal UCLA researchers create exceptionally strong and lightweight new metal]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Automobile parts===
[[File:PCCB Brake Carrera GT.jpg|thumb|The Porsche Carrera GT's carbon-ceramic (silicon carbide) disc brake]]

Silicon-infiltrated [[reinforced carbon-carbon|carbon-carbon composite]] is used for high performance "ceramic" [[disc brake|brake discs]], as it is able to withstand extreme temperatures. The silicon reacts with the graphite in the carbon-carbon composite to become carbon-fiber-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC). These discs are used on some road-going sports cars, supercars, as well as other performance cars including the [[Porsche Carrera GT]], the [[Bugatti Veyron]], the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C6)#ZR1|Chevrolet Corvette ZR1]], the [[McLaren P1]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| accessdate = 2009-06-06| url = http://www.topmost10.com/topDetail.php?alias=fastest_cars| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090326020231/http://www.topmost10.com/topDetail.php?alias=fastest_cars| archivedate = 2009-03-26| title = Top 10 Fast Cars|work=topmost10.com}} &lt;/ref&gt;, [[Bentley]], [[Ferrari]], [[Lamborghini]] and some specific high-performance [[Audi]] cars.

==== Foundry crucibles ====
SiC is used in crucibles for holding melting metal in small and large foundry applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Friedrichs, Peter; Kimoto, Tsunenobu; Ley, Lothar; Pensl, Gerhard |title=Silicon Carbide: Volume 1: Growth, Defects, and Novel Applications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pPj9UABAZG8C&amp;pg=PA49|date=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-62906-0|pages=49–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brown, John |title=Foseco Non-Ferrous Foundryman's Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgZQKH12Z6IC&amp;pg=PA52|date= 1999|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=978-0-08-053187-8|pages=52–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electric systems===
The earliest electrical application of SiC was in [[lightning arrester]]s in electric power systems. These devices must exhibit high [[electrical resistance|resistance]] until the [[voltage]] across them reaches a certain threshold V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; at which point their resistance must drop to a lower level and maintain this level until the applied voltage drops below V&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page = 1108| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FdSQSAC3_EwC| title = The electronics handbook| author = Whitaker, Jerry C.| publisher = CRC Press| year = 2005| isbn = 0-8493-1889-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was recognized early on that SiC had such a voltage-dependent resistance, and so columns of SiC pellets were connected between high-voltage [[electric power transmission|power line]]s and the earth. When a [[lightning strike]] to the line raises the line voltage sufficiently, the SiC column will conduct, allowing strike current to pass harmlessly to the earth instead of along the power line. The SiC columns proved to conduct significantly at normal power-line operating voltages and thus had to be placed [[Series and parallel circuits|in series]] with a [[spark gap]]. This spark gap is [[ion]]ized and rendered conductive when lightning raises the voltage of the power line conductor, thus effectively connecting the SiC column between the power conductor and the earth. Spark gaps used in lightning arresters are unreliable, either failing to strike an arc when needed or failing to turn off afterwards, in the latter case due to material failure or contamination by dust or salt. Usage of SiC columns was originally intended to eliminate the need for the spark gap in lightning arresters. Gapped SiC arresters were used for lightning-protection and sold under the [[GE]] and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation (1886)|Westinghouse]] brand names, among others. The gapped SiC arrester has been largely displaced by no-gap [[varistors]] that use columns of [[zinc oxide]] pellets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page = 250| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EUUZrPcU3twC| title = Transmission and distribution electrical engineering| author = Bayliss, Colin R.| publisher = Newnes| year = 1999| isbn = 0-7506-4059-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic circuit elements===
[[File:Uv-LED.jpg|thumb|Ultraviolet LED]]
Silicon carbide was the first commercially important semiconductor material.  A [[crystal radio]] "carborundum" (synthetic silicon carbide) detector diode was patented by [[Henry Harrison Chase Dunwoody]] in 1906. It found much early use in shipboard receivers. 

====Power electronic devices====
Silicon carbide is a [[semiconductor]] in research and early [[mass production]] providing advantages for fast, high-temperature and/or high-voltage devices. The first devices available were [[Schottky diode]]s, followed by [[JFET|junction-gate FET]]s and [[MOSFET]]s for high-power switching. [[Bipolar transistor]]s and [[thyristors]] are currently developed.&lt;ref name=baliga&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bhatnagar|first=M.|author2=Baliga, B.J. |title=Comparison of 6H-SiC, 3C-SiC, and Si for power devices|journal=IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices|date=March 1993|volume=40|issue=3|pages=645–655|doi=10.1109/16.199372|bibcode = 1993ITED...40..645B }}&lt;/ref&gt; A major problem for SiC commercialization has been the elimination of defects: edge dislocations, screw dislocations (both hollow and closed core), triangular defects and basal plane dislocations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Mater.

''Reuters''. 2011-05-05&lt;/ref&gt; followed in 2011 by the first commercial MOSFETs rated at 1200 V. Beside SiC switches and SiC Schottky diodes (also Schottky barrier diode, [[Schottky diode|SBD]]) in the popular TO-247 and [[TO-220]] packages, companies started even earlier to implement the bare chips into their [[power module|power electronic module]]s. SiC SBD diodes found wide market spread being used in [[Power factor correction|PFC]] circuits and [[IGBT]] [[power module]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cree.com/News-and-Events/Cree-News/Press-Releases/2011/January/110117-MOSFET Cree Launches Industry’s First Commercial Silicon Carbide Power MOSFET; Destined to Replace Silicon Devices in High-Voltage (≥ 1200-V) Power Electronics]. ''Cree''. 2011-01-17&lt;/ref&gt;
Conferences such as the [[International Conference on Integrated Power Electronics Systems]] (CIPS) report regularly about the technological progress of SiC power devices.
Major challenges for fully unleashing the capabilities of SiC power devices are:
* Gate drive: SiC devices often require gate drive voltage levels that are different from their silicon counterparts and may be even unsymmetric, for example, +20&amp;nbsp;V and −5&amp;nbsp;V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Meißer, Michael|title=Resonant Behaviour of Pulse Generators for the Efficient Drive of Optical Radiation Sources Based on Dielectric Barrier Discharges|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FiWkAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|year=2013|publisher=KIT Scientific Publishing|isbn=978-3-7315-0083-4|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Packaging: SiC [[die (integrated circuit)|chip]]s may have a higher power density than silicon power devices and are able to handle higher temperatures exceeding the silicon limit of 150&amp;nbsp;°C. New die attach technologies such as [[sintering]] are required to efficiently get the heat out of the devices and ensure a reliable interconnection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Packaging Technologies for SiC Power Modules|author1=Horio, Masafumi |author2=Iizuka, Yuji |author3=Ikeda, Yoshinari |journal=Fuji Electric Review|volume=58|issue=2|pages=75–78|year=2012|url=http://www.fujielectric.com/company/tech/pdf/58-02/FER-58-2-075-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====LEDs====
The phenomenon of [[electroluminescence]] was discovered in 1907 using silicon carbide and the first commercial [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]] were based on SiC. Yellow LEDs made from 3C-SiC were manufactured in the Soviet Union in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://donklipstein.com/yellosic.html| title = Yellow SiC LED| accessdate=2009-06-06|author=Klipstein, Don }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[blue LED]]s (6H-SiC) worldwide in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=LED&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gRvvM7skEzQC| title= High brightness light emitting diodes| author = Stringfellow| publisher =Academic Press| year= 1997| isbn = 0-12-752156-9| pages = 48, 57, 425| author2 = Gerald B.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production was soon stopped because [[gallium nitride]] showed 10–100 times brighter emission. This difference in efficiency is due to the unfavorable [[Direct and indirect band gaps|indirect bandgap]] of SiC, whereas GaN has a [[Direct and indirect band gaps|direct bandgap]] which favors light emission. However, SiC is still one of the important LED components – it is a popular substrate for growing GaN devices, and it also serves as a heat spreader in high-power LEDs.&lt;ref name=LED/&gt;

===Astronomy===
The low thermal expansion coefficient, high hardness, rigidity and thermal conductivity make silicon carbide a desirable [[mirror]] material for [[astronomy|astronomical]] telescopes. The growth technology ([[chemical vapor deposition]]) has been scaled up to produce disks of polycrystalline silicon carbide up to {{convert|3.5|m|abbr=on}} in diameter, and several telescopes like the [[Herschel Space Telescope]] are already equipped with SiC optics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = The largest telescope mirror ever put into space| url = http://www.esa.int/esaSC/SEMC7W1PGQD_index_0.html| accessdate = 2009-06-06| publisher = European Space Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title =2.7-meter-diameter silicon carbide primary mirror for the SOFIA telescope|bibcode = 1994SPIE.2199..263P| author = Petrovsky, Gury T.; Tolstoy, Michael N.; Lubarsky, Sergey V.; Khimitch, Yuri P.; Robb, Paul N.|journal = Proc.

===Thin filament pyrometry===
{{main article|Thin filament pyrometry}}
[[File:SiCpyrometer.jpg|thumb|upright|Test flame and glowing SiC fibers. The flame is about {{convert|7|cm|abbr=on}} tall.]]
Silicon carbide fibers are used to measure gas temperatures in an optical technique called thin filament pyrometry. It involves the placement of a thin filament in a hot gas stream. Radiative emissions from the filament can be correlated with filament temperature. Filaments are SiC fibers with a diameter of 15 micrometers, about one fifth that of a human hair. Because the fibers are so thin, they do little to disturb the flame and their temperature remains close to that of the local gas. Temperatures of about 800–2500 K can be measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher = NASA| url = http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/2003/6000/6711sunderland.html| title = Thin-Filament Pyrometry Developed for Measuring Temperatures in Flames| accessdate = 2009-06-06| deadurl = bot: unknown| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120315171904/http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/RT/2003/6000/6711sunderland.html| archivedate = 2012-03-15| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1364/AO.46.000483| title=Thin-filament pyrometry with a digital still camera| year=2007| author=Maun, Jignesh D.| journal=Applied Optics| volume=46| pages=483–8| pmid=17230239| last2=Sunderland| first2=P.

===Heating elements===
References to silicon carbide heating elements exist from the early 20th century when they were produced by Acheson's Carborundum Co. in the U.S. and EKL in Berlin. Silicon carbide offered increased [[operating temperature]]s compared with metallic heaters. Silicon carbide elements are used today in the melting of glass and non-ferrous metal, [[heat treatment]] of metals, [[float glass]] production, production of ceramics and electronics components, igniters in [[pilot lights]] for gas heaters, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| pages = 383–393| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=STjhvBnqflIC| title = Industrial heating: principles, techniques, materials, applications, and design| author = Deshmukh, Yeshvant V. | publisher = CRC Press| year = 2005| isbn = 0-8493-3405-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear fuel particles and cladding===
Silicon carbide is an important material in [[TRISO]]-coated fuel particles, the type of [[nuclear fuel]] found in [[high temperature gas cooled reactor]]s such as the [[Pebble Bed Reactor]]. A layer of silicon carbide gives coated fuel particles structural support and is the main diffusion barrier to the release of fission products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Journal of Nuclear Materials| volume = 392| issue = 2| year = 2009| pages = 219–224| doi = 10.1016/j.jnucmat.2009.03.013| title = TRISO coated fuel particles with enhanced SiC properties|author= López-Honorato, E.|bibcode = 2009JNuM..392..219L| last2 = Tan| first2 = J.| last3 = Meadows| first3 = P.

Silicon carbide [[composite material]] has been investigated for use as a replacement for [[Zircaloy]] cladding in [[light water reactors]].

===Jewelry===
[[File:Moissanite_ring_natural_light.jpg|thumb|left|A moissanite engagement ring]]
As a [[gemstone]] used in [[jewellery|jewelry]], silicon carbide is called "synthetic moissanite" or just "moissanite" after the mineral name. Moissanite is similar to [[diamond]] in several important respects: it is transparent and hard (9–9.5 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]], compared to 10 for diamond), with a [[refractive index]] between 2.65 and 2.69 (compared to 2.42 for diamond). Moissanite is somewhat harder than common [[cubic zirconia]]. Unlike diamond, moissanite can be strongly [[birefringent]]. For this reason, moissanite jewels are cut along the [[optic axis]] of the crystal to minimize birefringent effects. It is lighter (density 3.21 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; vs. 3.53 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and much more resistant to heat than diamond. This results in a stone of higher [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]], sharper facets, and good resilience. Loose moissanite stones may be placed directly into wax ring moulds for lost-wax casting, as can diamond,&lt;ref&gt;Teague, Tyler. [http://www.jettresearch.com/sites/default/files/casting%20stones%20in%20place%202001.pdf Casting Metal Directly onto Stones], Jett Industries&lt;/ref&gt; as moissanite remains undamaged by temperatures up to {{convert|1800|C}}. Moissanite has become popular as a diamond substitute, and may be misidentified as diamond, since its thermal conductivity is closer to diamond than any other substitute. Many thermal diamond-testing devices cannot distinguish moissanite from diamond, but the gem is distinct in its [[birefringence]] and a very slight green or yellow fluorescence under ultraviolet light. Some moissanite stones also have curved, string-like inclusions, which diamonds never have.&lt;ref name=don&gt;{{cite book| author = O'Donoghue, M. |title = Gems|publisher = Elsevier| year = 2006| isbn = 0-7506-5856-8|page = 89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZwcM5H-wHNoC&amp;pg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steel production===
[[File:Silicon carbide chunk.jpg|thumb|right|Piece of silicon carbide used in steel making]]
Silicon carbide, dissolved in a [[basic oxygen furnace]] used for making [[steel]], acts as a [[fuel]]. The additional energy liberated allows the furnace to process more scrap with the same charge of hot metal. It can also be used to raise tap temperatures and adjust the carbon and silicon content. Silicon carbide is cheaper than a combination of [[ferrosilicon]] and carbon, produces cleaner steel and lower emissions due to low levels of [[trace element]]s, has a low gas content, and does not lower the temperature of steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.millerandco.com/products/briquettes_steel/| accessdate = 2009-06-06| title = Silicon carbide (steel industry)| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120204195558/http://www.millerandco.com/products/briquettes_steel/| archivedate = 2012-02-04| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catalyst support===
The natural resistance to oxidation exhibited by silicon carbide, as well as the discovery of new ways to synthesize the cubic β-SiC form, with its larger surface area, has led to significant interest in its use as a heterogeneous [[catalyst support]]. This form has already been employed as a catalyst support for the oxidation of [[hydrocarbon]]s, such as n-[[butane]], to [[maleic anhydride]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 258| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=s_1SomN_GVQC| title = Handbook of commercial catalysts: heterogeneous catalysts| author = Rase, Howard F.| publisher = CRC Press| year = 2000| isbn = 0-8493-9417-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = High surface area silicon carbide from rice husk: A support material for catalysts|author=Singh, S.

===Carborundum printmaking===
Silicon carbide is used in [[carborundum printmaking]] – a [[collagraph]] [[printmaking]] technique. Carborundum grit is applied in a paste to the surface of an aluminium plate. When the paste is dry, ink is applied and trapped in its granular surface, then wiped from the bare areas of the plate. The ink plate is then printed onto paper in a rolling-bed press used for [[intaglio printmaking]]. The result is a print of painted marks embossed into the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.birchamgallery.co.uk/glossary/printmaking/| title = Printmaking|work=Bircham Gallery, birchamgallery.co.uk| accessdate = 2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphene production===
Silicon carbide can be used in the production of [[graphene]] because of its chemical properties that promote the epitaxial production of graphene on the surface of SiC nanostructures.

When it comes to its production, silicon is used primarily as a substrate to grow the graphene. But there are actually several methods that can be used to grow the graphene on the silicon carbide. The confinement controlled sublimation (CCS) growth method consists of a SiC chip that is heated under vacuum with graphite. Then the vacuum is released very gradually to control the growth of graphene. This method yields the highest quality graphene layers. But other methods have been reported to yield the same product as well.

Another way of growing graphene would be thermally decomposing SiC at a high temperature within a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ruan|first=Ming|last2=Hu|first2=Yike|last3=Guo|first3=Zelei|last4=Dong|first4=Rui|last5=Palmer|first5=James|last6=Hankinson|first6=John|last7=Berger|first7=Claire|last8=Heer|first8=Walt A. de|date=December 2012|title=Epitaxial graphene on silicon carbide: Introduction to structured graphene|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/mrs-bulletin/article/epitaxial-graphene-on-silicon-carbide-introduction-to-structured-graphene/BED16F0BBB0B4F7C8B44EB44C95A6650|journal=MRS Bulletin|language=en|volume=37|issue=12|pages=1138–1147|doi=10.1557/mrs.2012.231|issn=0883-7694}}&lt;/ref&gt; But this method turns out to yield graphene layers that contain smaller grains within the layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Emtsev|first=Konstantin V.|last2=Bostwick|first2=Aaron|last3=Horn|first3=Karsten|last4=Jobst|first4=Johannes|last5=Kellogg|first5=Gary L.|last6=Ley|first6=Lothar|last7=McChesney|first7=Jessica L.|last8=Ohta|first8=Taisuke|last9=Reshanov|first9=Sergey A.|date=2009-02-08|title=Towards wafer-size graphene layers by atmospheric pressure graphitization of silicon carbide|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nmat2382|journal=Nature Materials|language=En|volume=8|issue=3|pages=203–207|doi=10.1038/nmat2382|issn=1476-1122}}&lt;/ref&gt; So there have been efforts to improve the quality and yield of graphene. One such method is to perform ''ex situ'' graphitization of silicon terminated SiC in an atmosphere consisting of argon. This method has proved to yield layers of graphene with larger domain sizes than the layer that would be attainable via other methods. This new method can be very viable to make higher quality graphene for a multitude of technological applications.

When it comes to understanding how or when to use these methods of graphene production, most of them mainly produce or grow this graphene on the SiC within a growth enabling environment. It is utilized most often at rather higher temperatures (such as 1300˚C) because of SiC thermal properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Heer|first=Walt A.|last2=Berger|first2=Claire|last3=Wu|first3=Xiaosong|last4=First|first4=Phillip N.|last5=Conrad|first5=Edward H.|last6=Li|first6=Xuebin|last7=Li|first7=Tianbo|last8=Sprinkle|first8=Michael|last9=Hass|first9=Joanna|date=July 2007|title=Epitaxial graphene|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0038109807002980|journal=Solid State Communications|volume=143|issue=1-2|pages=92–100|doi=10.1016/j.ssc.2007.04.023|issn=0038-1098}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been certain procedures that have been performed and studied that could potentially yield methods that use lower temperatures to help manufacture graphene. More specifically this different approach to graphene growth has been observed to produce graphene within a temperature environment of around 750˚C. This method entails the combination of certain methods like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and surface segregation. And when it comes to the substrate, the procedure would consist of coating a SiC substrate with thin films of a transition metal. And after the rapid heat treating of this substance, the carbon atoms would then become more abundant at the surface interface of the transition metal film which would then yield graphene. And this process was found to yield graphene layers that were more continuous throughout the substrate surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-07-01|title=Synthesis of graphene on silicon carbide substrates at low temperature|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0008622309001900|journal=Carbon|language=en|volume=47|issue=8|pages=2026–2031|doi=10.1016/j.carbon.2009.03.051|issn=0008-6223}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum physics===
Silicon carbide can host point defects in the crystal lattice known as color centers. These defects can produce single photons on demand and thus serve as a platform for [[single-photon source]]. Such device is a fundamental resource for many emerging applications of the quantum information science. If one pumps a color center via an external optical source or electrical current, the color center will be brought to the excited state and will then relax with the emission of one photon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = Nature Communications| volume = 6| year = 2015| pages = 7783| doi =  10.1038/ncomms8783 | title = Single-photon emitting diode in silicon carbide |author1= Lohrmann, A. |author2= Iwamoto, N. |author3= Bodrog, Z. |author4=Castalletto, S. |author5=Ohshima, T. |author6=Karle, T.J. |author7=Gali, A. |author8=Prawer, S. |author9=McCallum, J.C. |author10= Johnson, B.C. |arxiv=1503.07566 |bibcode=2015NatCo...6E7783L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| journal = npj Quantum Information| volume = 4| year = 2018| pages = 15| doi =  10.1038/s41534-018-0066-2 | title = Enhancing the brightness of electrically driven single-photon sources using color centers in silicon carbide |author1= Khramtsov, I.A. |author2= Vyshnevyy, A.A. |author3= Fedyanin, D.

'''Soilon''' is a fine mesh made from poly lactic acid (PLA) polymer resin by lactic fermentation of glucose, derived from starch (such as [[corn starch]]), by an enzyme and polymerization. By thermal polymerizing of lactic acid, an aliphatic polyester resin having melting point of 170 C and 57C second order transition point respectively is gotten. Due to its plastic character, PLA can be melt-spun into fibers (filaments), which are woven for beverage filter media. It was designed for (and often used in) [[teabag]]s.  It was chosen to replace the materials in teabags, since it can be [[Biodegradation|biodegraded]] and broken down readily by [[microorganism]]s in the soil.  It is a safe and non-toxic alternative to the paper bags usually employed.

'''Sokol Eshelon''' ({{lang-rus|Сокол-Эшелон}}) is a [[Russia]]n, formerly Soviet, [[laser weapon]] based [[anti-satellite weapon|anti-satellite system]]. It is an airborne laser based on a [[Beriev A-60]] aircraft. In 2012 it was reported that the project is back under development and is intended for the [[Russian Aerospace Defence Forces]] once completed.

==A-60==
{{Main|Beriev A-60}}
The Beriev A-60 aircraft is a laser research plane produced by [[Beriev]] based on their [[IL-76]] transport. Development seems to have started in 1981 with the laser installed in 1983. A second plane was built in 1991. The plane contains a special nose cone with a laser targeting system.&lt;ref name="redstar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="milrus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vpk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mdb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ria"/&gt;&lt;ref name="airwar"/&gt;

==Sokol Eshelon==
The Sokol Eshelon project started in 2003 and was first made public in the annual report of contractor Khimpromavtomatika in 2005. Other mentions include [[Almaz-Antey]]'s annual report in 2006 and in a report by [[Radiofizika]] in 2009 where they mentioned their development of radar for the plane. Details also emerged due to a court case between Almaz-Antey and Beriev over payments to a subcontractor. The contract between the two parties was connected to a contract no. 5933 Almaz-Antey holds with military unit 21055. This contract is supervised by the Ministry of Defence's 27th Military Representative Office. The project seems to be known under the codename ''Дуэлянт'' (Duelyant, en. duelist).&lt;ref name="milrus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mdb"/&gt;

In 2009 the plane was involved in a test to illuminate [[Japan]]ese satellite [[Experimental Geodetic Payload|AJISAI]] which was at an orbital height of 1,500&amp;nbsp;km. The test involved seeing if a reflection of the laser off the satellite could be picked up, and wasn't intended to damage the satellite.&lt;ref name="redstar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="podvig-asat2"/&gt;

The laser has been given the codename 1LK222. The purpose of the laser is to blind the sensors of enemy satellites rather than destroy them.&lt;ref name="podvig-asat"/&gt;&lt;ref name="podvig-asat2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="izvestia"/&gt; Its developmental work was reportedly finished as of early 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://sputniknews.com/military/201802251061979166-russia-creates-airborne-antisatellite-laser/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Speculum metal''' is a mixture of around two-thirds [[copper]] and one-third [[tin]] making a white brittle [[alloy]] that can be polished to make a highly reflective surface. It was used historically to make different kinds of [[mirror]]s from personal grooming aids to [[reflecting telescope]] optical mirrors until it was replaced by more modern materials.

Large speculum metal mirrors are hard to manufacture and the alloy is prone to [[tarnish]], requiring frequent re-polishing. However, it was the only practical choice for large mirrors in high-precision optical equipment between mid-17th and mid-19th century, before the invention of [[Silvering|glass silvering]].

==Overview==

Speculum metal mixtures usually contain two parts copper to one part tin along with a small amount of [[arsenic]], although there are other mixtures containing silver, lead, or zinc. The knowledge of making very hard white high luster metal out of [[bronze]]-type high-tin alloys may date back more than 2000 years in [[China]]&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham, Gwei-djen Lu: [https://books.google.com/books?id=BYixSmXUCuMC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=speculum+metal&amp;lr=#v=onepage&amp;q=speculum%20metal&amp;f=false ''Science and civilisation in China''], Vol. 5, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; although it could also be an invention of western civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ab_NAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=speculum+metal+invented&amp;dq=speculum+metal+invented The Journal of the Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland]'', Vol. 64, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Such metals were used in sculpture and to make more effective mirrors than the more common yellow easily tarnishing [[bronze mirror]]s. In that era mirrors of speculum metal, or any precious metal, were rare and only owned by the wealthy &lt;ref&gt;Albert Allis: [https://books.google.com/books?id=ioNOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=speculum+metal+mirros+of+precious+metal#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''The Scientific American cyclopedia of formulas''], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Speculum and telescopes ==

Speculum metal found an application in [[early modern Europe]] as the only known good reflecting surface for mirrors in [[reflecting telescope]]s. In contrast to household mirrors, where the reflecting metal layer is coated on the back of a glass pane and covered with a protective varnish, precision optical equipment like telescopes needs [[first surface mirror]]s that can be ground and polished into complex shapes such as [[parabolic reflector]]s. For nearly 200 years speculum metal was the only mirror substance that could perform this task. One of the earliest designs, [[James Gregory (astronomer and mathematician)|James Gregory]]’s [[Gregorian telescope]] could not be built because Gregory could not find a craftsman capable of fabricating the complex speculum mirrors needed for the design.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Chambers, Thomas Thomson: [https://books.google.com/books?id=9EYBAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA175-IA1&amp;dq=parabolic+James+Gregory ''A Biographical Dictionary of Eminent Scotsmen''], p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaac Newton]] was the first to successfully build a reflecting telescope in 1668. His [[Newton's reflector|first reflecting telescope]] (a design which came to be known as a [[Newtonian reflector]]) had a 33-mm (1.3-inch) diameter speculum metal [[primary mirror]] of his own formulation.&lt;ref&gt;Henry C. King: [https://books.google.com/books?id=KAWwzHlDVksC&amp;dq=history+of+the+telescope&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bn&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4kK3SZWjC5-atwf6vOG-CQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA74,M1 ''The History of the Telescope''], p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;
Newton was likewise confronted with the problem of fabricating the complex parabolic shape needed to create the image, but simply settled on a spherical shape. The composition of speculum metal was further refined and went on to be used in the 1700s and 1800s in many designs of reflecting telescopes. The ideal composition was around 68.21%  copper to 31.7 % tin; more copper made the metal more yellow, more tin made the metal more blue in color.&lt;ref&gt; Norman W. Henley et al: [http://chestofbooks.com/reference/Henley-s-20th-Century-Formulas-Recipes-Processes-Vol1/Speculum-Metal.html Speculum Metal]&lt;/ref&gt; Ratios with up to 45% tin were used for resistance to tarnishing.

Although speculum metal mirror reflecting telescopes could be built very large, such as [[William Herschel]]'s 126-cm (49.5-inch) "[[40-foot telescope]]" of 1789 and [[William Parsons, 3rd Earl of Rosse|Lord Rosse]] 1845 183-cm (72-inch) mirror of his "[[Leviathan of Parsonstown]]", impracticalities in using the metal made most astronomers prefer their smaller [[refracting telescope]] counterparts.&lt;ref name="Leaflet331"&gt;Edison Pettit: [http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu//full/1956ASPL....7..249P/0000249.000.html The Reflector]. ''Astronomical Society of the Pacific Leaflets''. Vol. 7, No. 331, pp. 249–256. December 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;
Speculum metal was very hard to cast and shape. It only reflected 66 percent of the light that hit it. Speculum also had the unfortunate property of tarnishing in open air with a sensitivity to humidity, requiring constant re-polishing to maintain its usefulness. This meant the telescopes mirrors had to be constantly removed, polished, and [[figuring|re-figured]] to the correct shape. This sometimes proved difficult, with some mirrors having to be abandoned.&lt;ref name="Leaflet331"/&gt; It also required that two or more mirrors had to be fabricated for each telescope so that one could be used while the other was being polished. Rapidly cooling night time air would cause stresses in large speculum metal mirrors, distorting their shape and causing them to produce poor images. Lord Rosse had a system of adjustable levers on his 72-inch metal mirror so he could adjust the shape when it was hit or miss at producing an acceptable image.&lt;ref&gt;Voyage through the universe: ''The Visible Universe''. Time-Life Books, 1990. [http://www.cybrations.com/Clips/Voyage.htm (Web clip)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856–57 an improvement over speculum mirrors was invented when [[Karl August von Steinheil]] and [[Léon Foucault]] introduced the process of depositing an ultra thin layer of silver on the front surface (first surface) of a ground block of glass. Silvered glass mirrors were a vast improvement since silver reflects 90 percent of the light that hits it and is much slower to tarnish than speculum. Silver coatings can also be removed from the glass, so a tarnished mirror could be resilvered without changing the delicate precision polished shape of the glass substrate. Glass is also more thermally stable than speculum metal, allowing it to hold its shape better through temperature changes. This marked the end of the speculum-mirror reflecting telescope, with the last large one, the [[Great Melbourne Telescope]] with its 122-cm (48-inch) mirror, being completed in 1867. The era of the large glass-mirror reflector had begun, with telescopes such as [[Andrew Ainslie Common]]'s 1879 36&amp;nbsp;inch (91&amp;nbsp;cm) and 1887 60&amp;nbsp;inch (152&amp;nbsp;cm) reflectors built at [[Ealing]], and the first of the "modern" large glass mirror research reflectors, 60&amp;nbsp;inch (150&amp;nbsp;cm) [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] Hale telescope of 1908, the 100&amp;nbsp;inch (2.5 m) Mount Wilson [[Hooker telescope]] in 1917&lt;ref name="Leaflet331"/&gt; and the 200&amp;nbsp;inch (5 m) Mount Palomar [[Hale telescope]] in 1948.

The '''thorium fuel cycle''' is a [[nuclear fuel cycle]] that uses an [[isotope]] of [[thorium]], {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|232|link=yes}}, as the [[fertile material]]. In the reactor, {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|232}} is [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] into the [[fissile]] artificial [[uranium]] isotope {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233|link=yes}} which is the [[nuclear fuel]]. Unlike [[natural uranium]], natural thorium contains only trace amounts of fissile material (such as {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|231|link=yes}}), which are insufficient to initiate a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. Additional fissile material or another neutron source is necessary to initiate the fuel cycle. In a thorium-fuelled reactor, {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|232}} absorbs [[neutron]]s to produce {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}}. This parallels the process in uranium [[breeder reactor]]s whereby fertile {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|238|link=yes}} absorbs neutrons to form fissile {{SimpleNuclide2|Plutonium|239|link=yes}}. Depending on the design of the reactor and fuel cycle, the generated {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}} either fissions [[in situ]] or is chemically separated from the [[used nuclear fuel]] and formed into new nuclear fuel.

The thorium fuel cycle has several potential advantages over a [[uranium fuel cycle]], including thorium's [[Thorium#Occurrence|greater abundance]], superior physical and nuclear properties, reduced [[plutonium]] and [[actinide]] production,&lt;ref name="Hargraves-Moir" /&gt; and better resistance to [[nuclear proliferation|nuclear weapons proliferation]] when used in a traditional [[light water reactor]]&lt;ref name="Hargraves-Moir"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aps.org/units/fps/newsletters/201101/hargraves.cfm |title=Liquid Fuel Nuclear Reactors |author=Robert Hargraves |author2=Ralph Moir  |date= January 2011 |work=[[American Physical Society]] Forum on Physics &amp; Society |accessdate=31 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Nwfaq/Nfaq6.html Nuclear Materials] FAQ&lt;/ref&gt; though not in a [[molten salt reactor]].&lt;ref name="U‐232 and the proliferation‐resistance of U‐233 in spent fuel"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Kang | first1 = J. | last2 = Von Hippel | first2 = F.

==History==
Concerns about the [[Uranium depletion|limits of worldwide uranium resources]] motivated initial interest in the thorium fuel cycle.&lt;ref name="Thorium Fuel Cycle - Potential Benefits and Challenges" /&gt;  It was envisioned that as uranium reserves were depleted, thorium would supplement uranium as a fertile material. However, for most countries uranium was relatively abundant and research in thorium fuel cycles waned. A notable exception was [[India's three-stage nuclear power programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

At [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] in the 1960s, the [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment]] used {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}} as the fissile fuel in an experiment to demonstrate a part of the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor that was designed to operate on the thorium fuel cycle.  [[Molten salt reactor]] (MSR) experiments assessed thorium's feasibility, using [[thorium(IV) fluoride]] dissolved in a [[molten salt]] fluid that eliminated the need to fabricate fuel elements. The MSR program was defunded in 1976 after its patron [[Alvin Weinberg]] was fired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Miller|first=Daniel| title=Nuclear community snubbed reactor safety message: expert|url= http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-03-18/nuclear-community-snubbed-reactor-safety-message/2649768|work= ABC News|date=March 2011 | accessdate= 2012-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Carlo Rubbia]] proposed the concept of an [[energy amplifier]] or "accelerator driven system" (ADS), which he saw as a novel and safe way to produce nuclear energy that exploited existing accelerator technologies.

[[Kirk Sorensen]], former NASA scientist and Chief Technologist at [[Flibe Energy]], has been a long-time promoter of thorium fuel cycle and particularly [[liquid fluoride thorium reactor]]s (LFTRs).  He first researched thorium reactors while working at [[NASA]], while evaluating power plant designs suitable for lunar colonies. In 2006 Sorensen started "energyfromthorium.com" to promote and make information available about this technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flibe-energy.com/ |title=Flibe Energy |publisher=Flibe Energy |accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 MIT study concluded that although there is little in the way of barriers to a thorium fuel cycle, with current or near term light-water reactor designs there is also little incentive for any significant market penetration to occur. As such they conclude there is little chance of thorium cycles replacing conventional uranium cycles in the current nuclear power market, despite the potential benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=2011 |title=The Future of the Nuclear Fuel Cycle | url=https://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/MITEI-The-Future-of-the-Nuclear-Fuel-Cycle.pdf |publisher=MIT |page=181 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the thorium cycle, fuel is formed when {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|232}} [[neutron capture|captures]] a [[neutron]] (whether in a [[fast reactor]] or [[thermal reactor]]) to become {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|233|link=yes}}. This normally emits an [[electron]] and an [[antineutrino|anti-neutrino]] ({{SubatomicParticle|Antineutrino}}) by [[beta decay|{{SubatomicParticle|beta-}} decay]] to become {{SimpleNuclide2|Protactinium|233|link=yes}}. This then emits another electron and anti-neutrino by a second {{SubatomicParticle|beta-}} decay to become {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}}, the fuel:

===Fission product wastes===
[[Nuclear fission]] produces radioactive [[fission product]]s which can have half-lives from [[LLFP#Short-term|days]] to [[LLFP|greater than 200,000 years]]. According to some toxicity studies,&lt;ref name="LEBRUN"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/00/04/14/97/PDF/document_IAEA.pdf |format=PDF |last=Le Brun |first=C. |author2=L.

Other studies assume some actinide losses and find that actinide wastes dominate thorium cycle waste radioactivity at some future periods.&lt;ref name="BRISSOT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lpsc.in2p3.fr/gpr/english/NEWNRW/NEWNRW.html#foot284 |title=Nuclear Energy With (Almost) No Radioactive Waste? |quote=according to computer simulations done at ISN, this Protactinium dominates the residual toxicity of losses at {{val|10000|u=years}} |date=July 2001 |author1=Brissot R. |author2=Heuer D. |author3=Huffer E. |author4=Le Brun, C. |author5=Loiseaux, J-M |author6=Nifenecker H. |author7=Nuttin A. |publisher=Laboratoire de Physique Subatomique et de Cosmologie (LPSC) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525091426/http://lpsc.in2p3.fr/gpr/english/NEWNRW/NEWNRW.html#foot284 |archivedate=2011-05-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Actinide wastes===
In a reactor, when a neutron hits a fissile atom (such as certain isotopes of uranium), it either splits the nucleus or is captured and transmutes the atom. In the case of {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}}, the transmutations tend to produce useful nuclear fuels rather than [[transuranic]] wastes. When {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}} absorbs a neutron, it either fissions or becomes {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|234|link=yes}}. The chance of fissioning on absorption of a [[thermal neutron]] is about 92%; the capture-to-fission ratio of {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}}, therefore, is about 1:12 — which is better than the corresponding capture vs. fission ratios of {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|235|link=yes}} (about 1:6), or {{SimpleNuclide2|Plutonium|239}} or {{SimpleNuclide2|Plutonium|241|link=yes}} (both about 1:3).&lt;ref name="Thorium Fuel Cycle - Potential Benefits and Challenges"&gt;

The result is less [[transuranic]] waste than in a reactor using the uranium-plutonium fuel cycle.
{{Thorium Cycle Transmutation}}
{{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|234}}, like most [[actinide]]s with an even number of neutrons, is not fissile, but neutron capture produces fissile {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|235}}.  If the fissile isotope fails to fission on neutron capture, it produces {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|236|link=yes}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Neptunium|237|link=yes}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Plutonium|238|link=yes}}, and eventually fissile {{SimpleNuclide2|Plutonium|239}} and heavier [[isotopes of plutonium]].
The {{SimpleNuclide2|Neptunium|237}} can be removed and stored as waste or retained and transmuted to plutonium, where more of it fissions, while the remainder becomes {{SimpleNuclide2|Plutonium|242|link=yes}}, then [[americium]] and [[curium]], which in turn can be removed as waste or returned to reactors for further transmutation and fission.

However, the {{SimpleNuclide2|Protactinium|231|link=yes}} (with a half-life of {{val|3.27|e=4|u=years}}) formed via (''n'',2''n'') reactions with {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|232}} (yielding {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|231}} that decays to {{SimpleNuclide2|Protactinium|231|link=yes}}), while not a transuranic waste, is a major contributor to the long-term [[radiotoxic]]ity of spent nuclear fuel.

===Uranium-232 contamination===
[[Uranium-232]] is also formed in this process, via (''n'',2''n'') reactions between [[fast neutron]]s and {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Protactinium|233|link=yes}}, and {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|232}}:

&lt;/math&gt;

Uranium-232 has a relatively short half-life ({{val|68.9|u=years}}), and some [[decay product]]s emit high energy [[gamma radiation]], such as {{SimpleNuclide2|Radon|224|link=yes}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Bismuth|212|link=yes}} and particularly {{SimpleNuclide2|Thallium|208|link=yes}}. The [[thorium series|full decay chain]], along with half-lives and relevant gamma energies, is:

Thorium-cycle fuels produce hard [[gamma emission]]s, which damage electronics, limiting their use in bombs. {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|232}} cannot be chemically separated from {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}} from [[used nuclear fuel]]; however, chemical separation of thorium from uranium removes the decay product {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|228}} and the radiation from the rest of the decay chain, which gradually build up as {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|228}} reaccumulates.  The contamination could also be avoided by using a molten-salt breeder reactor and separating the Pa-233 before it decays into U-233.&lt;ref name="U‐232 and the proliferation‐resistance of U‐233 in spent fuel"/&gt;  The hard gamma emissions also create a radiological hazard which requires remote handling during reprocessing.

==Nuclear fuel==
As a fertile material thorium is similar to {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|238}}, the major part of natural and depleted uranium. The thermal neutron absorption [[nuclear cross section|cross section]] (σ&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[resonance integral]] (average of neutron cross sections over intermediate neutron energies) for {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|232}} are about three and one third times those of the respective values for {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|238}}.

===Advantages===
Thorium is estimated to be about three to four times more abundant than uranium in Earth's crust,&lt;ref name="The Use of Thorium as Nuclear Fuel"&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.ans.org/pi/ps/docs/ps78.pdf
 |format=PDF
 |publisher=American Nuclear Society
 |title=The Use of Thorium as Nuclear Fuel
 |date=November 2006
 |accessdate=2009-03-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt; although present knowledge of [[Thorium#Distribution|reserves]] is limited. Current demand for thorium has been satisfied as a by-product of [[rare earth element|rare-earth]] extraction from [[monazite]] sands.

Although the thermal neutron fission cross section (σ&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;) of the resulting {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}} is comparable to {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|235}} and {{SimpleNuclide2|Plutonium|239}}, it has a much lower capture cross section (σ&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;) than the latter two fissile isotopes, providing fewer non-fissile neutron absorptions and improved [[neutron economy]]. Finally, the ratio of neutrons released per neutron absorbed (η) in {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}} is greater than two over a wide range of energies, including the thermal spectrum; as a result, thorium-based fuels can be the basis for a [[Breeder reactor#Thermal breeder reactor|thermal breeder reactor]].&lt;ref name="Thorium Fuel Cycle - Potential Benefits and Challenges" /&gt; A breeding reactor in the uranium - plutonium cycle needs to use a fast neutron spectrum, because in the thermal spectrum one neutron absorbed by {{SimpleNuclide2|Plutonium|239}} on average leads to less than two neutrons.

Thorium-based fuels also display favorable physical and chemical properties that improve reactor and [[deep geological repository|repository]] performance. Compared to the predominant reactor fuel, [[uranium dioxide]] ({{chem||UO|2}}), [[thorium dioxide]] ({{chem|ThO|2}}) has a higher [[melting point]], higher [[thermal conductivity]], and lower [[coefficient of thermal expansion]]. Thorium dioxide also exhibits greater [[chemical stability]] and, unlike uranium dioxide, does not further [[oxidize]].&lt;ref name="Thorium Fuel Cycle - Potential Benefits and Challenges" /&gt;

Because the {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}} produced in thorium fuels is significantly contaminated with {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|232}} in proposed power reactor designs, thorium-based [[used nuclear fuel]] possesses inherent [[nuclear proliferation|proliferation]] resistance. {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|232}} cannot be [[separation process|chemically separated]] from {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}} and has several [[decay product]]s that emit high-energy [[gamma radiation]]. These high-energy photons are a [[ionizing radiation|radiological hazard]] that necessitate the use of [[remote handling]] of separated uranium and aid in the passive [[nuclear detection|detection]] of such materials.

The long-term (on the order of roughly {{val|e=3}} to {{val|e=6|u=years}}) radiological hazard of conventional uranium-based used nuclear fuel is dominated by plutonium and other [[minor actinide]]s, after which [[long-lived fission products]] become significant contributors again. A single neutron capture in {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|238}} is sufficient to produce [[transuranic elements]], whereas five captures are generally necessary to do so from {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|232}}. 98–99% of thorium-cycle fuel nuclei would fission at either {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}} or {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|235}}, so fewer long-lived transuranics are produced. Because of this, thorium is a potentially attractive alternative to uranium in [[MOX fuel|mixed oxide (MOX) fuels]] to minimize the generation of transuranics and maximize the destruction of plutonium.&lt;ref name=wnn-20130621&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/ENF_Thorium_test_begins_2106131.html |title=Thorium test begins |publisher=World Nuclear News |date=21 June 2013 |accessdate=21 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages===
There are several challenges to the application of thorium as a nuclear fuel, particularly for solid fuel reactors:

In contrast to uranium, naturally occurring thorium is effectively [[Mononuclidic element|mononuclidic]] and contains no fissile isotopes; fissile material, generally {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|235}} or plutonium, must be added to achieve [[nuclear chain reaction|criticality]]. This, along with the high [[sintering]] temperature necessary to make thorium-dioxide fuel, complicates fuel fabrication. [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] experimented with [[thorium tetrafluoride]] as fuel in a [[molten salt reactor]] from 1964–1969, which was expected to be easier to process and separate from contaminants that slow or stop the chain reaction.

In an [[Nuclear fuel cycle#Once-through nuclear fuel cycle|open fuel cycle]] (i.e. utilizing {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}} in situ), higher [[burnup]] is necessary to achieve a favorable [[neutron economy]]. Although thorium dioxide performed well at burnups of 170,000 MWd/t and 150,000 MWd/t at [[Fort St. Vrain Generating Station]] and [[AVR reactor|AVR]] respectively,&lt;ref name="Thorium Fuel Cycle - Potential Benefits and Challenges" /&gt; challenges complicate achieving this in [[light water reactor]]s (LWR), which compose the vast majority of existing power reactors.

In a once-through thorium fuel cycle the residual {{SimpleNuclide2|U|233}} is a long-lived radioactive isotope in the waste.

Another challenge associated with the thorium fuel cycle is the comparatively long interval over which {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|232}} breeds to {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}}. The [[half-life]] of {{SimpleNuclide2|Protactinium|233}} is about 27 days, which is an order of magnitude longer than the half-life of {{SimpleNuclide2|Neptunium|239|link=yes}}. As a result, substantial {{SimpleNuclide2|Protactinium|233}} develops in thorium-based fuels. {{SimpleNuclide2|Protactinium|233}} is a significant [[neutron absorber]] and, although it eventually [[breeder reactor|breeds]] into fissile {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|235}}, this requires two more neutron absorptions, which degrades [[neutron economy]] and increases the likelihood of [[transuranic element|transuranic]] production.

Alternatively, if solid thorium is used in a [[Nuclear fuel cycle#Plutonium cycle|closed fuel cycle]] in which {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}} is [[nuclear reprocessing|recycled]], [[remote handling]] is necessary for fuel fabrication because of the high radiation levels resulting from the [[decay products]] of {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|232}}. This is also true of recycled thorium because of the presence of {{SimpleNuclide2|Thorium|228}}, which is part of the {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|232}} decay sequence. Further, unlike proven uranium fuel recycling technology (e.g. [[PUREX]]), recycling technology for thorium (e.g. THOREX) is only under development.

Although the presence of {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|232}} complicates matters, there are public documents showing that {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}} has been used once in a [[nuclear weapon]] test. The United States tested a composite {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|233}}-plutonium bomb core in the MET (Military Effects Test) blast during [[Operation Teapot]] in 1955, though with much lower yield than expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Though thorium-based fuels produce far less long-lived [[transuranic elements|transuranics]] than uranium-based fuels,&lt;ref name="LEBRUN" /&gt;
some long-lived [[actinide]] products constitute a long-term radiological impact, especially {{SimpleNuclide2|Protactinium|231}}.&lt;ref name="BRISSOT" /&gt;

Advocates for liquid core and [[molten salt reactor]]s such as [[Liquid fluoride thorium reactor|LFTR]]s claim that these technologies negate thorium's disadvantages present in solid fuelled reactors. As only two liquid-core fluoride salt reactors have been built (the ORNL [[Aircraft Reactor Experiment#Direct Air Cycle|ARE]] and [[Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment|MSRE]]) and neither have used thorium, it is hard to validate the exact benefits.&lt;ref name="Thorium Fuel Cycle - Potential Benefits and Challenges" /&gt;

==Reactors==

Thorium fuels have fueled several different reactor types, including [[light water reactor]]s, [[heavy water reactor]]s, [[HTGR|high temperature gas reactor]]s, [[sodium-cooled fast reactor]]s, and [[molten salt reactor]]s.&lt;ref name="Thorium Fuel Utilization: Options and trends"&gt;

'''Titanium nitride''' ({{titanium}}{{nitrogen}}) (sometimes known as '''tinite''') is an extremely hard [[ceramic]] material, often used as a coating on [[titanium alloy]]s, [[steel]], [[carbide]], and [[aluminium]] components to improve the substrate's surface properties.

Applied as a thin coating, TiN is used to harden and protect cutting and sliding surfaces, for decorative purposes (due to its golden appearance), and as a non-toxic exterior for [[implant (medicine)|medical implants]]. In most applications a coating of less than {{convert|5|um|in}} is applied.

==Characteristics==
TiN has a [[Vickers hardness]] of 1800–2100, a [[modulus of elasticity]] of 251&amp;nbsp;GPa, a [[thermal expansion coefficient]] of 9.35{{e|-6}}&amp;nbsp;K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a superconducting transition temperature of 5.6&amp;nbsp;K.&lt;ref name=prop&gt;{{cite book|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbt-RWodmVAC&amp;pg=PA193|title=Handbook of refractory carbides and nitrides: properties, characteristics, processing, and applications|author =Hugh O. Pierson| publisher = William Andrew|year =1996| isbn= 0-8155-1392-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1116/1.577270 |first=D. S. |last=Stone |author2=K. B. Yoder |author3=W. D. Sproul  |title=Hardness and elastic modulus of TiN based on continuous indentation technique and new correlation |journal=Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology A |volume=9 |issue=4 |year=1991 |pages=2543–2547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TiN will oxidize at 800&amp;nbsp;°C in a normal atmosphere.  It is chemically stable at 20&amp;nbsp;°C, according to laboratory tests, but can be slowly attacked by concentrated acid solutions with rising temperatures.&lt;ref name=prop/&gt;
Depending on the substrate material and surface finish, TiN will have a [[coefficient of friction]] ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 against another TiN surface (non-lubricated). The typical TiN formation has a [[crystal structure]] of [[Sodium chloride#Crystal structure|NaCl-type]] with a roughly 1:1 [[stoichiometry]]; TiN&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; compounds with ''x'' ranging from 0.6 to 1.2 are, however, thermodynamically stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=L.E. |last=Toth |title=Transition Metal Carbides and Nitrides |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York |year=1971 |isbn=0-12-695950-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

TiN becomes [[superconductivity|superconducting]] at cryogenic temperatures, with critical temperature up to 6.0&amp;nbsp;K for single crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spengler|first1=W. |year=1978 |title=Raman scattering, superconductivity, and phonon density of states of stoichiometric and nonstoichiometric TiN |journal=Phys. Rev. B |volume=17 |pages=1095 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.17.1095 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Superconductivity in thin-film TiN has been studied extensively, with the superconducting properties strongly varying depending on sample preparation.
A thin film of TiN was chilled to near [[absolute zero]], converting it into the first known [[superinsulator]], with resistance suddenly increasing by a factor of 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.physorg.com/news126797387.html |title=Newly discovered 'superinsulators' promise to transform materials research, electronics design |work=PhysOrg.com |date=2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

[[File:Paraframe.jpg|thumb|100px|Dark gray TiCN coating on a [[Gerber Legendary Blades|Gerber]] pocketknife]]
A well-known use for TiN coating is for edge retention and corrosion resistance on machine tooling, such as [[drill bit]]s and [[milling cutter]]s, often improving their lifetime by a factor of three or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tincoat.net/TiN.html|date=June 2014|title=Titanium Nitride (TiN) Coating|publisher=Surface Solutions Inc.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of TiN's metallic gold color, it is used to coat [[costume jewelry]] and automotive trim for decorative purposes. TiN is also widely used as a top-layer coating, usually with [[nickel]] (Ni) or [[chromium]] (Cr) plated substrates, on consumer plumbing fixtures and door hardware. As a coating it is used in [[aerospace]] and military applications and to protect the sliding surfaces of [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] forks of [[bicycle]]s and [[motorcycle]]s as well as the shock shafts of [[radio controlled car]]s. TiN is non-toxic, meets [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] guidelines and has seen use in [[medical device]]s such as [[scalpel]] blades and orthopedic [[Bone cutter|bone saw]] blades where sharpness and edge retention are important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ionfusion.com |title=Products |publisher=IonFusion Surgical |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; TiN coatings have also been used in implanted [[prosthesis|prostheses]] (especially [[hip replacement]] implants) and other medical implants.

Though less visible, [[thin film]]s of TiN are also used in [[microelectronics]], where they serve as a [[electrical conductivity|conductive]] connection between the active device and the metal contacts used to operate the circuit, while acting as a [[diffusion barrier]] to block the [[diffusion]] of the metal into the silicon. In this context, TiN is classified as a "barrier metal", even though it is clearly a [[ceramic]] from the perspective of [[chemistry]] or mechanical behavior. Recent chip design in the 45&amp;nbsp;nm technology and beyond also makes use of TiN as a "metal" for improved [[transistor]] performance. In combination with [[gate dielectric]]s (e.g. HfSiO) that have a higher [[permittivity]] compared to standard [[Silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] the gate length can be scaled down with low [[Subthreshold leakage|leakage]], higher drive current and the same or better [[threshold voltage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Thaddeus G. |last=Dziura |author2=Benjamin Bunday |author3=Casey Smith |author4=Muhammad M.

The most common methods of TiN thin film creation are [[physical vapor deposition]] (PVD, usually [[sputter deposition]], [[cathodic arc deposition]] or [[Electron beam physical vapor deposition|electron beam heating]]) and [[chemical vapor deposition]] (CVD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diffusion-alloys.com/our-services/wear-coatings-for-industrial-products/ |title=Wear Coatings for Industrial Products |publisher=Diffusion Alloys Limited. |accessdate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519024447/http://www.diffusion-alloys.com/our-services/wear-coatings-for-industrial-products/ |archivedate=2013-05-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In both methods, pure titanium is [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimed]] and reacted with nitrogen in a high-energy, [[vacuum]] environment. TiN film may also be produced on Ti workpieces by reactive growth (for example, [[Annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]) in a [[nitrogen]] atmosphere. PVD is preferred for steel parts because the deposition temperatures exceeds the [[Austenite|austenitizing]] temperature of steel. TiN layers are also sputtered on a variety of higher melting point materials such as [[stainless steel]]s, [[titanium]] and [[titanium alloy]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coatingservicesgroup.com/coatings |title=Coatings |publisher=Coating Services Group, LLC. |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its high [[Young's modulus]] (values between 450 and 590 [[gigapascal|GPa]] have been reported in the literature &lt;ref name= SCT2008&gt;{{cite journal |author1=G. Abadias | title = Stress and preferred orientation in nitride based PVD coatings | journal = Surf. Coat. Technol. | volume = 202 | pages = 2223–2235 | year = 2008 | doi = 10.1016/j.surfcoat.2007.08.029 | issue = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;) means that thick coatings tend to flake away, making them much less durable than thin ones. Titanium nitride coatings can also be deposited by [[thermal spraying]] whereas TiN powders are produced by nitridation of titanium with nitrogen or ammonia at 1200&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=prop/&gt;

Bulk ceramic objects can be fabricated by packing powdered metallic titanium into the desired shape, compressing it to the proper density, then igniting it in an atmosphere of pure nitrogen. The heat released by the chemical reaction between the metal and gas is sufficient to [[sintering|sinter]] the nitride reaction product into a hard, finished item. See [[powder metallurgy]].

==Other commercial variants==
[[File:Smith&amp;Wesson CKLPR.jpg|thumb|right|A knife with a titanium oxynitride coating]]
There are several commercially used variants of TiN that have been developed in the past decade, such as titanium carbon nitride (TiCN), [[titanium aluminium nitride]] (TiAlN or AlTiN), and titanium aluminum carbon nitride, which may be used individually or in alternating layers with TiN. These coatings offer similar or superior enhancements in corrosion resistance and hardness, and additional colors ranging from light gray to nearly black, to a dark [[Iridescence|iridescent]] bluish-purple depending on the exact process of application. These coatings are becoming common on sporting goods, particularly [[knife|knives]] and [[handgun]]s, where they are used for both cosmetic and functional reasons.

==As a constituent in steel making==

Titanium nitride is also produced intentionally within some steels by judicious addition of titanium to the [[alloy]]. TiN forms at very high temperatures because of its very low [[Standard enthalpy change of formation|enthalpy of formation]], and even [[Nucleation|nucleates]] directly from the melt in secondary steelmaking. It forms discrete, micrometre-sized [[Cubic crystal system|cubic]] particles at [[Grain boundary|grain boundaries]] and triple points, and prevents [[grain growth]] by [[Ostwald ripening]] up to very high [[homologous temperature]]s. Titanium nitride has the lowest [[Solubility equilibrium|solubility product]] of any metal nitride or carbide in austenite, a useful attribute in [[microalloyed steel]] formulas.

==Natural occurrence==&lt;!--Osbornite redirects here--&gt;
''Osbornite'' is a very rare natural form of titanium nitride, found almost exclusively in meteorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website=Mindat.org |url=http://www.mindat.org/min-3035.html |title=Osbornite |publisher=Hudson Institute of Mineralogy |accessdate=Feb 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webmineral.com/data/Osbornite.shtml#.V_cFauArJaQ|website=Mineralogy Database|title=Osbornite Mineral Data|date=Sep 5, 2012|accessdate=Oct 6, 2015|publisher=David Barthelmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dusheme.jpg|thumb|right|Solid parquet boards with grooves on the near ends. Tongues on the right sides of the boards and grooves on the left sides. The far ends are tongued.]]

'''Tongue and groove''' is a method of fitting similar objects together, edge to edge, used mainly with [[wood]], in [[flooring]], [[parquetry]], [[panelling]], and similar constructions. Tongue and groove joints allow two flat pieces to be joined strongly together to make a single flat surface. Before [[plywood]] became common, tongue and groove boards were also used for [[sheathing]] buildings and to construct [[concrete]] [[formwork]].

A strong joint, the '''tongue and groove joint''' is widely used for re-entrant angles. The effect of wood shrinkage is concealed when the joint is beaded or otherwise moulded.&lt;ref&gt;Tongue and Groove, [http://www.woodworkdetails.com/knowledge/joints/case/dovetail WoodworkDetails.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In expensive cabinet work, glued [[Dovetail joint|dovetail]] and multiple tongue and groove are used.

Each piece has a slot (the ''[[Groove (joinery)|groove]]'') cut all along one edge, and a thin, deep ridge (the ''tongue'') on the opposite edge. The tongue projects a little less than the depth of the groove. Two or more pieces thus fit together closely. The [[woodworking joint|joint]] is not normally [[wood glue|glued]], as shrinkage would then pull the tongue off.

In another assembly method, the pieces are end-matched. This method eliminates the need for [[mitre joint]]s, face [[Nail (fastener)|nailing]], and the use of joints on {{convert|16|inch|sing=on}} or {{convert|24|inch|sing=on}} centres of conventional [[Framing (construction)|framing]].

For many uses, tongue and groove boards have been rendered obsolete by the introduction of plywood and later [[composite wood]] boards, but the method is still used in higher-quality boards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://odetowood.com/2016/04/29/5-excellent-woodworking-joints-that-every-woodworker-should-know/ flooring]&lt;/ref&gt; Plywood may also be tongued all round to fit it flush into a framed structure, and plywood for sub-floors used in [[platform framing]] is often supplied with tongue and groove edges.

When joining thicker materials, several tongue and groove joints may be used one above the other.

"Tongue and groove" is sometimes abbreviated as '''T&amp;G''' (for example, on price tags and shelf tags).

==Methods==
One of the following [[woodworking]] tools may be used to produce the tongue and groove:
* A four- or six-head [[moulder]] (for large quantities)
* A [[wood shaper]] (spindle moulder)
* A [[circular saw bench]]
* Suitable [[hand plane]]s: a plough plane for the groove and a tongue plane for the tongue, or a combination plane
* A spindle [[Router (woodworking)|router]]

==Tongue-in-groove==
Tongue-in-groove is similar to tongue and groove, but instead of the tongue forming part of one of the edges, it is a separate, loose piece that fits between two identically grooved edges. The tongue may or may not be of the same material as the grooved pieces joined by the tongue. For example, plywood flooring is commonly grooved at the edges, and plastic tongues are used to form the joint.

'''Uranium-232''' ({{ComplexNuclide2|Uranium|232}}, {{SimpleNuclide2|Uranium|232}}, U-232) is an isotope of uranium. It has a half-life of 68.9 years and is a side product in the [[thorium cycle]]. It has been cited as an obstacle to [[nuclear proliferation]] using &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U as the [[fissile]] material, because the intense [[gamma radiation]] emitted by [[thallium-208|&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Tl]] (a daughter of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;U, produced relatively quickly) makes the &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U contaminated with it more difficult to handle.

Production of &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U (through the neutron irradiation of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th) invariably produces small amounts of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;U as an impurity, because of parasitic (n,2n) reactions on [[uranium-233]] itself, or on [[protactinium-233]], or on [[thorium-232]]:

:&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th (n,γ) &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Th (β−) &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Pa (β−) &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;U (n,2n) &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;U
:&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th (n,γ) &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Th (β−) &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Pa (n,2n) &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Pa (β−) &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;U
:&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th (n,2n) &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Th (β−) &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa (n,γ) &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Pa (β−) &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;U

Another channel involves neutron capture reaction on small amounts of thorium-230, which is a tiny fraction of natural thorium present due to the decay of [[uranium-238]]:

:&lt;sup&gt;230&lt;/sup&gt;Th (n,γ) &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Th (β−) &lt;sup&gt;231&lt;/sup&gt;Pa (n,γ) &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Pa (β−) &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;U

The decay chain of &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;U quickly yields strong gamma radiation emitters:&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, H. C. ''Natural Radioactive Decay Chains'', Chapter 13 of ''Handbook of Nuclear Chemistry'', Second Edition, Springer 2011, {{ISBN|978-1-4419-0719-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;U (α, 68.9 years)
:&lt;sup&gt;228&lt;/sup&gt;Th (α, 1.9 year)
:&lt;sup&gt;224&lt;/sup&gt;Ra (α, 3.6 day, 0.24 MeV) (from this point onwards, the decay chain is identical to that of [[Thorium series#Thorium series|&lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;Th]]; thorium-232 is nevertheless much less dangerous because its extremely long half-life of about 14 billion years means that not as much of its dangerous daughters builds up)
:&lt;sup&gt;220&lt;/sup&gt;Rn (α, 55 s, 0.54 MeV)
:&lt;sup&gt;216&lt;/sup&gt;Po (α, 0.15 s)
:&lt;sup&gt;212&lt;/sup&gt;Pb (β−, 10.64 h)
:&lt;sup&gt;212&lt;/sup&gt;Bi (α, 61 min, 0.78 MeV)
:&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Tl (β−, 3 min, 2.6 MeV) (35.94% branching ratio)
:&lt;sup&gt;208&lt;/sup&gt;Pb (stable)

This makes manual handling in a glove box with only light shielding (as commonly done with plutonium) too hazardous, (except possibly in a short period immediately following chemical separation of the uranium from thorium-228, radium-224, radon-220, and polonium-216) and instead requiring remote manipulation for fuel fabrication.

Unusually for an isotope with even [[mass number]], &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;U has a significant [[neutron absorption]] [[Neutron cross-section|cross section]] for [[Nuclear fission|fission]] ([[thermal neutron]]s {{val|75|u=[[barn (unit)|barns]] (b)}}, [[resonance integral]] {{val|380|u=b}}) as well as for [[neutron capture]] (thermal {{val|73|u=b}}, resonance integral {{val|280|u=b}}).

'''White Juan''' is the unofficial name given to the [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale|hurricane-strength]] [[nor'easter]] [[blizzard]] of February 2004 that affected most of [[Atlantic Canada]] between February 17 and 20, 2004&amp;mdash;five months after [[Hurricane Juan]] devastated [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[The Weather Network]]|author=Lyndsay Morrison|date=2011-02-18|title=White Juan: remembering the storm|accessdate=2014-07-11|url=http://past.theweathernetwork.com/news/storm_watch_stories3&amp;stormfile=white_juan_remembering_the__180211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The storm dropped heavy snowfall throughout the [[Nova Scotia peninsula]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], with accumulations in the hardest-hit areas ranging from {{convert|50|to|100|cm|in|lk=on}}.

==Meteorological history==
The storm formed approximately {{convert|200|km|mi}} southeast of [[Cape Hatteras]], [[North Carolina]], on February 17, 2004. It intensified over the Gulf Stream, moving at 35–40&amp;nbsp;km/h (21–24 mi/h) before striking Atlantic Canada.&lt;ref name="Huff"/&gt;

==Effects==
Snow fell at a rate of {{convert|5|cm|in}} per hour for 12 straight hours, and winds blew at up to {{convert|124|km|mi}} per hour.&lt;ref name="Huff"/&gt;

The snowstorm dropped a record-breaking {{convert|95.5|cm|in}} of snow on [[CFB Shearwater]], beating the previous record of {{convert|73.2|cm|in}} set February 1, 1960. It also broke the record for the most snow in [[Yarmouth, Nova Scotia|Yarmouth]] with {{convert|82.6|cm|in}} of snow, surpassing the {{convert|67.8|cm|in}} that fell on January 16, 1977.

Numerous unofficial reports placed a snowfall of nearly {{convert|150|cm|in}} in many regions across the province. The storm also produced sustained winds ranging from 60 to 80&amp;nbsp;km/h through much of [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]], [[Prince Edward Island]], and [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] with maximum 1 minute gusts of {{convert|120|km|mi}} per hour reported at many stations. Much of central, northern and western New Brunswick received little to no snow or wind as the storm tracked toward the east.

Two weather stations in the Halifax Regional Municipality reported 10-second gusts nearing {{convert|147|km/h|mi/h}}. However, these reports have never been confirmed by [[Environment Canada]]. [[Weather radar]] observations, as well as synoptic report, showed extensive [[thundersnow]] embedded within the blizzard; in the heaviest bands, accumulation rates exceeded {{convert|20|cm/h|in/h}}.

The wind combined with the intense snow rates produced visibilities of {{convert|1|m|ft}} or less in most areas for brief periods, however these conditions persisted for at least eight hours in much of Nova Scotia. The wind also whipped up snow drifts which in some cases covered two and three-storey buildings and made many roads impassable to both common motor vehicles and snow removal equipment.

The [[humid continental climate]] of coastal Nova Scotia typically does not experience extreme snowfalls, compared with northern Nova Scotia, Cape Breton Island, Prince Edward Island and New Brunswick.{{dubious|date=December 2017}}  Thus the blizzard and heavy snowfall had a crippling effect on the [[Halifax Urban Area]] for several days following the storm as public works personnel struggled to clear streets and roads.  For several nights following the storm, a 10 p.m. curfew was implemented on residents in the [[Halifax Regional Municipality]] to permit operation of snow removal equipment. Due to a lack of space to displace the excess snow, the municipality had to receive permission from the federal government to begin dumping the snow into [[Halifax Harbour]] from federally owned docks in addition to the usual privately owned docks.

The storm also had an effect on the 2004 Special Olympic National Winter Games, which were being held in Charlottetown, PEI.

== Marine effects ==

While conditions on land proved to be serious, the storm produced hurricane-force winds out at sea with 10–15&amp;nbsp;meter (32–49 ft) swells, prompting a special marine warning. A [[storm surge]] equivalent to that associated with a Category&amp;nbsp;1 [[hurricane]] also affected portions of the [[Northumberland Strait]] in southeast [[New Brunswick]] and to a lesser extent [[Prince Edward Island]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.novaweather.net/Blizzard_2004/Blizzard_summary.pdf Summary by Chris Fogarty of Environment Canada (Page 7)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial impacts==
In 2011, the [[Halifax Regional Municipality]] announced that it had submitted bills to the federal government totalling $19.9 million in the wake of Hurricane Juan and White Juan, and that it was still waiting for nearly $6 million.&lt;ref name=6M&gt;{{cite news|title=Halifax owed $6M in Juan relief|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/halifax-owed-6m-in-juan-relief-1.1004001|accessdate=9 February 2014|newspaper=[[CBC.ca|CBC]] News Nova Scotia|date=Aug 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It wasn't until ten years later that the federal government announced that it would pay the province $3.6 million under the [[Disaster Financial Assistance Arrangements]] program which helps cover the costs of evacuations, emergency shelters and infrastructure.&lt;ref name=6M /&gt;

'''Zinc sulfide''' (or '''zinc sulphide''') is an [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] of ZnS. This is the main form of zinc found in nature, where it mainly occurs as the mineral [[sphalerite]]. Although this mineral is usually black because of various impurities, the pure material is white, and it is widely used as a pigment. In its dense synthetic form, zinc sulfide can be [[transparency and translucency|transparent]], and it is used as a window for [[visible light|visible optics]] and [[infrared]] optics.

==Structure==
[[File:Sphalerite-unit-cell-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|upright|Sphalerite, the more common polymorph of zinc sulfide]]
[[File:Wurtzite-unit-cell-3D-balls.png|thumb|left|upright|Wurtzite, the less common polymorph of zinc sulfide]]
ZnS exists in two main [[crystalline form]]s, and this dualism is often a salient example of [[polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]]. In each form, the coordination geometry at Zn and S is tetrahedral. The more stable cubic form is known also as zinc blende or [[sphalerite]].  The hexagonal form is known as the mineral [[wurtzite]], although it also can be produced synthetically.&lt;ref name = "Wells"&gt;{{Wells5th}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The transition from the sphalerite form to the wurtzite form occurs at around 1020&amp;nbsp;[[°C]]. A tetragonal form is also known as the very rare mineral called [[polhemusite]], with the formula (Zn,Hg)S.

==Applications==

===Luminescent material===
Zinc sulfide, with addition of few [[parts per million|ppm]] of suitable [[activator (phosphor)|activator]], exhibits strong [[phosphorescence]] (described by [[Nikola Tesla]] in 1893 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tesla |first=Nikola |title=The Inventions, Researches, and Writings of Nikola Tesla|url=https://archive.org/stream/inventionsresear00martiala/inventionsresear00martiala_djvu.txt |publisher=[[Internet_Archive]] |accessdate=1 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and is currently used in many applications, from [[cathode ray tube]]s through [[X-ray]] screens to [[phosphorescence|glow in the dark]] products. When [[silver]] is used as activator, the resulting color is bright blue, with maximum at 450 [[nanometer]]s. Using [[manganese]] yields an orange-red color at around 590 nanometers.  [[Copper]] gives long-time glow, and it has the familiar greenish glow-in-the-dark. Copper-doped zinc sulfide ("ZnS plus Cu") is used also in [[electroluminescence|electroluminescent]] panels.&lt;ref&gt;Karl A. Franz, Wolfgang G. Kehr, Alfred Siggel, Jürgen Wieczoreck, and Waldemar Adam "Luminescent Materials" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a15_519}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also exhibits [[phosphorescence]] due to impurities on illumination with blue or [[ultraviolet]] light.

===Optical material===
Zinc sulfide is also used as an [[infrared]] optical material, transmitting from visible [[wavelength]]s to just over 12 [[micrometer]]s. It can be used planar as an [[optical window]] or shaped into a [[lens (optics)|lens]]. It is made as [[microcrystalline]] sheets by the synthesis from [[hydrogen sulfide]] gas and zinc vapour, and this is sold as [[FLIR]]-grade (Forward Looking IR), where the zinc sulfide is in a milky-yellow, opaque form. This material when [[hot isostatic pressing|hot isostatically pressed]] (HIPed) can be converted to a water-clear form known as '''Cleartran''' (trademark). Early commercial forms were marketed as '''Irtran-2''' but this designation is now obsolete.

===Pigment===
Zinc sulfide is a common [[pigment]], sometimes called sachtolith. When combined with barium sulfate, zinc sulfide forms [[lithopone]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann2&gt;Gerhard Auer, Peter Woditsch, Axel Westerhaus, Jürgen Kischkewitz, Wolf-Dieter Griebler and Marcel Liedekerke "Pigments, Inorganic, 2. White Pigments" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2009, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim.  {{DOI| 10.1002/14356007.n20_n01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catalyst===
Fine ZnS powder is an efficient [[photocatalyst]], which produces hydrogen gas from water upon illumination. Sulfur vacancies can be introduced in ZnS during its synthesis; this gradually turns the white-yellowish ZnS into a brown powder, and boosts the photocatalytic activity through enhanced light absorption.&lt;ref name=cat/&gt;

===Semiconductor properties===
Both sphalerite and wurtzite are intrinsic, wide-[[bandgap]] [[semiconductor]]s. These are prototypical [[II-VI semiconductor]]s, and they adopt structures related to many of the other semiconductors, such as [[gallium arsenide]]. The cubic form of ZnS has a [[band gap]] of about 3.54 [[electron volt]]s at 300 [[kelvin]]s, but the hexagonal form has a band gap of about 3.91 electron volts. ZnS can be [[doping (semiconductors)|doped]] as either an [[n-type semiconductor]] or a [[p-type semiconductor]].

==History==
The [[phosphorescence]] of ZnS was first reported by the French chemist [[Théodore Sidot]] in 1866. His findings were presented by [[A. E. Becquerel]], who was renowned for the research on [[luminescence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k30204.image.f188.langFR | first = T. | last = Sidot | journal = [[Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|Compt. Rend.]] | volume = 63| pages = 188–189 | year = 1866 | title = Sur les propriétés de la blende hexagonale}}&lt;/ref&gt; ZnS was used by [[Ernest Rutherford]] and others in the early years of [[nuclear physics]] as a [[Scintillator|scintillation]] detector, because it emits light upon excitation by [[x-rays]] or [[electron beam]], making it useful for X-ray screens and [[cathode ray tube]]s.&lt;ref name="G&amp;E"&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw1st|page=1405}}&lt;/ref&gt; This property made zinc sulfide useful in the [[radium dials|dials]] of radium watches.

==Production==
[[File:The_reaction_of_zinc_and_sulfur.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Mixtures of zinc and sulfur react pyrotechnically, leaving behind zinc sulfide.]]
Zinc sulfide is usually produced from waste materials from other applications.  Typical sources include smelter, slag, and pickle liquors.&lt;ref name=Ullmann2/&gt; It is also a [[by-product]] of the synthesis of [[ammonia]] from [[methane]] where [[zinc oxide]] is used to scavenge [[hydrogen sulfide]] impurities in the natural gas:
:ZnO + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S → ZnS + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===Laboratory preparation===
It is easily produced by igniting a mixture of [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]].&lt;ref&gt;Sur un nouveau procédé de préparation – du sulfure de zinc phosphorescent" by R. Coustal, F. Prevet, 1929&lt;/ref&gt; Since zinc sulfide is insoluble in water, it can also be produced in a [[precipitation reaction]]. Solutions containing Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; salts readily form a precipitate ZnS in the presence of [[sulfide]] ions (e.g., from [[hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]]).
:Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + S&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → ZnS
This reaction is the basis of a [[gravimetric analysis]] for zinc.&lt;ref&gt;{{VogelQuantitative6th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
