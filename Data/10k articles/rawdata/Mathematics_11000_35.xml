In [[graph theory]], the '''(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'')-decomposition''' of an undirected [[graph theory|graph]] is a partition of its edges into ''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 sets, each one of them inducing a forest, except one who induces a graph with maximum degree&amp;nbsp;''b''. If this graph is also a forest, then we call this a ''' F(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'')-decomposition'''.

A graph with [[arboricity]] ''a'' is (''a'',&amp;nbsp;0)-decomposable. Every (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''0'')-decomposition or (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''1'')-decomposition is a F(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''0'')-decomposition or a F(''a'',&amp;nbsp;''1'')-decomposition respectively.

== Graph classes ==

* Every [[planar graph]] is F(2,&amp;nbsp;4)-decomposable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Gonçalves|2009}}, conjectured by {{harvtxt|Balogh et al.|2005}}. Improving results by {{harvtxt|Nash-Williams|1964}} then {{harvtxt|Balogh et al.|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every [[planar graph]] &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with [[girth (graph theory)|girth]] at least &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is
** F(2,&amp;nbsp;0)-decomposable if &lt;math&gt;g \ge 4&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=NW&gt;Implied by {{harvtxt|Nash-Williams|1964}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
** (1,&amp;nbsp;4)-decomposable if &lt;math&gt;g \ge 5&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|He et al.|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** F(1,&amp;nbsp;2)-decomposable if &lt;math&gt;g \ge 6&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Implied by {{harvtxt|Montassier et al.|2012}}, improving results by {{harvtxt|He et al.|2002}}, then {{harvtxt|Kleitman|2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

** (1,&amp;nbsp;5)-decomposable if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has no 4-cycles.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Borodin et al.|2009a}}, improving results by {{harvtxt|He et al.|2002}}, then {{harvtxt|Borodin et al.|2008b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Every [[outerplanar graph]] is F(2,&amp;nbsp;0)-decomposable&lt;ref name=NW /&gt; and (1,&amp;nbsp;3)-decomposable.&lt;ref&gt;Proved without explicit reference by {{harvtxt|Guan|Zhu|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Assertion Definition Language''' ('''ADL''') is a [[specification language]] providing a formal grammar to specify behaviour and interfaces for computer [[software]].&lt;ref name="About ADL."&gt;http://adl.opengroup.org/about/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; ADL uses function [[Precondition|pre-]] and [[postcondition]]s to specify interfaces and is designed to provide an intermediary between informal English language specifications and formal programmatic test specifications. Tool support exists both to convert ADL specifications into natural language, and to generate test systems against which implementation code can be verified.&lt;ref name="About ADL." /&gt;

ADL is developed cooperatively by [[The Open Group]] and [[SunTest]] of [[Sun Microsystems]] &lt;ref name="About ADL: History."&gt;http://adl.opengroup.org/about/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5924">In [[mathematics]], a '''Bézout matrix''' (or '''Bézoutian''' or '''Bezoutiant''') is a special [[matrix (mathematics)#Square matrices and related definitions|square matrix]] associated with two [[polynomial]]s, introduced by {{harvs|txt|first=James Joseph|last=Sylvester|authorlink=James Joseph Sylvester|year=1853}} and {{harvs|txt|first=Arthur|last=Cayley|year=1857|authorlink=Arthur Cayley}} and named after [[Étienne Bézout]].  '''Bézoutian''' may also refer to the [[determinant]] of this matrix, which is equal to the [[resultant]] of the two polynomials. Bézout matrices are sometimes used to test the [[stable polynomial|stability]] of a given polynomial.

==Definition==
Let &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(z)&lt;/math&gt; be two complex polynomials of degree at most ''n'',
:&lt;math&gt;f(z)=\sum_{i=0}^n u_i z^i,\quad\quad g(z)=\sum_{i=0}^n v_i z^i.&lt;/math&gt;
(Note that any coefficient &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; could be zero.) The '''Bézout matrix''' of order ''n'' associated with the polynomials ''f'' and ''g'' is 
:&lt;math&gt;B_n(f,g)=\left(b_{ij}\right)_{i,j=1,\dots,n}&lt;/math&gt;
where the entries &lt;math&gt;b_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; result from the identity
:&lt;math&gt;
  \frac{f(x)g(y)-f(y)g(x)}{x-y}
     =\sum_{i,j=1}^n b_{ij}\,x^{i-1}\,y^{j-1}.
&lt;/math&gt;

It is in &lt;math&gt;\Complex^{n\times n}&lt;/math&gt; and the entries of that matrix are such that if we let &lt;math&gt;m_{ij}=\min\{i,n+1-j\}&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;i, j = 1, \dots, n&lt;/math&gt;, then:
:&lt;math&gt;b_{ij}=\sum_{k=1}^{m_{ij}}u_{j+k-1}v_{i-k}-u_{i-k}v_{j+k-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

To each Bézout matrix, one can associate the following [[bilinear form]], called the Bézoutian:
:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Bez}:\Complex^n\times\Complex^n\to \Complex:(x,y)\mapsto \operatorname{Bez}(x,y)=x^*B_n(f,g)y.&lt;/math&gt;

==Examples==
* For ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3, we have for any polynomials ''f'' and ''g'' of degree (at most) 3:
::&lt;math&gt;B_3(f,g)=\left[\begin{matrix}u_1v_0-u_0 v_1 &amp; u_2 v_0-u_0 v_2 &amp; u_3 v_0-u_0 v_3\\u_2 v_0-u_0 v_2 &amp; u_2v_1-u_1v_2+u_3v_0-u_0v_3 &amp; u_3 v_1-u_1v_3\\u_3v_0-u_0v_3 &amp; u_3v_1-u_1v_3 &amp; u_3v_2-u_2v_3\end{matrix}\right].&lt;/math&gt;

* Let &lt;math&gt;f(x)=3x^3-x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g(x)=5x^2+1&lt;/math&gt; be two polynomials.  Then:
::&lt;math&gt;B_4(f,g)=\left[\begin{matrix}-1 &amp; 0 &amp; 3 &amp; 0\\0 &amp;8 &amp;0 &amp;0 \\3&amp;0&amp;15&amp;0\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0\end{matrix}\right].&lt;/math&gt;
The last row and column are all zero as ''f'' and ''g'' have degree strictly less than ''n'' (equal 4).  The other zero entries are because for each &lt;math&gt;i = 0, \dots, n&lt;/math&gt;, either &lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;v_i&lt;/math&gt; is zero.

==Properties==
* &lt;math&gt;B_n(f,g)&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric (as a matrix);
* &lt;math&gt;B_n(f,g)=-B_n(g,f)&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;B_n(f,f)=0&lt;/math&gt;;
* &lt;math&gt;B_n(f,g)&lt;/math&gt; is [[bilinear map|bilinear]] in (''f'',''g'');
* &lt;math&gt;B_n(f,g)&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}&lt;/math&gt; if ''f'' and ''g'' have real coefficients;
* &lt;math&gt;B_n(f,g)&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular with &lt;math&gt;n=\max(\deg(f),\deg(g))&lt;/math&gt; if and only if ''f'' and ''g'' have no common roots.
* &lt;math&gt;B_n(f,g)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;n=\max(\deg(f),\deg(g))&lt;/math&gt; has [[determinant]] which is the [[resultant]] of ''f'' and ''g''.

==Applications==
An important application of Bézout matrices can be found in [[control theory]].  To see this, let ''f''(''z'') be a complex polynomial of degree ''n'' and denote by ''q'' and ''p'' the real polynomials such that ''f''(i''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''q''(''y'')&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;i''p''(''y'') (where ''y'' is real).  We also note ''r'' for the rank and ''&amp;sigma;'' for the signature of &lt;math&gt;B_n(p,q)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, we have the following statements:
* ''f''(''z'') has ''n''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''r'' roots in common with its conjugate;
* the left ''r'' roots of ''f''(''z'') are located in such a way that:
** (''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''&amp;sigma;'')/2 of them lie in the open left half-plane, and
** (''r''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''&amp;sigma;'')/2 lie in the open right half-plane;
* ''f'' is [[stable polynomial|Hurwitz stable]] [[if and only if]] &lt;math&gt;B_n(p,q)&lt;/math&gt; is [[Positive-definite matrix|positive definite]].

The third statement gives a necessary and sufficient condition concerning stability.  Besides, the first statement exhibits some similarities with a result concerning [[Sylvester matrix|Sylvester matrices]] while the second one can be related to [[Routh–Hurwitz theorem]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10657">In [[number theory]], the '''Carmichael function''' associates to every [[positive integer]] ''n'' a positive integer &lt;math&gt;\lambda(n)&lt;/math&gt;, defined as the smallest positive integer ''m'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;a^m \equiv 1 \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;  for every integer ''a'' between 1 and ''n'' that is [[coprime]] to ''n''. 
(Dropping the phrase "between 1 and ''n''" leads to an equivalent definition.) 
In algebraic terms,  &lt;math&gt;\lambda(n)&lt;/math&gt; equals the [[exponent of a group|exponent]] of the [[multiplicative group of integers modulo n|multiplicative group of integers modulo ''n'']]. 

The Carmichael function is named after the American mathematician [[Robert Daniel Carmichael|Robert Carmichael]] and is also known as the '''reduced totient function''' or the '''least universal exponent function'''.

==Numerical example==
Carmichael's function at 8 is 2, i.e.  &lt;math&gt;\lambda(8)=2&lt;/math&gt;, because for any number ''a'' co-prime to 8 it holds that ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≡ 1 (mod 8). Namely, 1&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1 (mod 8),  3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9 ≡ 1 (mod 8), 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 25 ≡ 1 (mod 8) and 7&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 49 ≡ 1 (mod 8). Euler's [[totient function]] at 8 is 4, i.e.  &lt;math&gt;\varphi(8)=4&lt;/math&gt;, because there are 4 numbers lesser than and coprime to 8 (1, 3, 5, and 7).  [[Euler's theorem]] assures that ''a&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;'' ≡ 1 (mod 8) for all ''a'' coprime to 8, but 4 is not the smallest such exponent.

== Computing  &lt;math&gt;\lambda(n)&lt;/math&gt; with Carmichael's theorem ==

By the [[fundamental theorem of arithmetic]] any ''n'' &gt; 1 can be written in a unique way as
:&lt;math&gt;
 n= p_1^{r_1}p_2^{r_2} \dots p_{k}^{r_k} 
&lt;/math&gt;
where ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt; ... &lt; ''p&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are [[prime]]s and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; , ..., ''r&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' are positive integers. It is then the case that ''λ''(''n'')  is the [[least common multiple]] of the ''λ'' of each of its prime power factors:
:&lt;math&gt;
\lambda(n) = \operatorname{lcm}\big(\lambda(p_1^{r_1}),\,\lambda(p_2^{r_2}),\,\ldots,\,\lambda(p_k^{r_k}) \big).
&lt;/math&gt;
This can be proved using the [[Chinese_remainder_theorem|Chinese Remainder Theorem]].

'''Carmichael's theorem''' explains how to compute ''λ'' of a prime power: for a power of an odd prime and for 2 and 4, ''λ''(''n'') is equal to the [[Euler totient]] ''φ''(''n''); for powers of 2 greater than 4 it is equal to half of the Euler totient.

Euler's function for prime powers is given by
:&lt;math&gt;
\varphi(p^r) = p^{r-1}(p-1).\;
&lt;/math&gt;

==Properties of the Carmichael function==

=== ''λ''(''n'') divides ''φ''(''n'') ===
This follows from elementary group theory, because the exponent of any [[finite abelian group]] must divide the order of the group. ''λ''(''n'') is the exponent of the   multiplicative group of integers modulo ''n'' while ''φ''(''n'') is the order of that group.

We can thus view Carmichael's theorem as a sharpening of [[Euler's theorem]]. 

===Minimality===

Suppose &lt;math&gt;a^m \equiv 1\pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt; for all numbers ''a'' coprime with ''n''. Then &lt;math&gt;\lambda(n)|m &lt;/math&gt;.

Proof. If &lt;math&gt; m = k\; \lambda(n) + r &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;0\le r&lt;\lambda(n) &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a^r = 1^k \cdot a^r \equiv (a^{\lambda(n)})^k\cdot a^r = a^{k\;\lambda(n)+r} = a^m \equiv 1\pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt; for all numbers ''a'' coprime with ''n.'' It follows &lt;math&gt;r=0 &lt;/math&gt; , since &lt;math&gt;r&lt;\lambda(n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda(n)&lt;/math&gt; the minimal positive such number.

===Divisibility===

:&lt;math&gt; a|b \Rightarrow \lambda(a)|\lambda(b) &lt;/math&gt;

Proof. The result follows from the formula

&lt;math&gt;
\lambda(n) = \operatorname{lcm}\big(\lambda(p_1^{r_1}),\,\lambda(p_2^{r_2}),\,\ldots,\,\lambda(p_k^{r_k}) \big)
&lt;/math&gt;

mentioned above.

===Composition===

For all positive integers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; it holds
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(\mathrm{lcm}(a,b)) = \mathrm{lcm}( \lambda(a), \lambda(b) )&lt;/math&gt; .
This is an immediate consequence of the recursive definition of the Carmichael function.
&lt;!--
Proof goes as follows:
Write a and b as product of prime powers
a = p1^x1·...·pt^xt
b = p1^y1·...·pt^yt
lambda(lcm(a,b))
 = lambda(p1^max(x1,y1)·...·pt^max(xt,yt))
 = lcm(lambda(p1^max(x1,y1)), ..., lambda(pt^max(xt,yt)))
 = lcm(lcm(lambda(p1^x1),lambda(p1^y1)), ..., lcm(lambda(pt^xt),lambda(pt^yt)))
 = lcm(lcm(lambda(p1^x1),...,lambda(pt^xt)), lcm(lambda(p1^y1),...,lambda(pt^yt)))
 = lcm(lambda(p1^x1·...·pt^xt), lambda(p1^y1·...·pt^yt))
 = lcm(lambda(a), lambda(b))
--&gt;

===Primitive m-th roots of unity===

Let &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; be [[coprime]] and
let &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; be the smallest exponent with &lt;math&gt;a^m \equiv 1 \pmod{n}&lt;/math&gt;,
then it holds
:&lt;math&gt;m | \lambda(n) &lt;/math&gt; .
That is, the orders of [[Primitive nth root of unity|primitive roots of unity]] in the ring of integers modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are divisors of &lt;math&gt; \lambda(n) &lt;/math&gt;.

===Exponential cycle length===

If &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; has maximum prime exponent &lt;math&gt;r_{\rm max}&lt;/math&gt; under prime factorization, then for all &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; (including those not co-prime to &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;) and all &lt;math&gt;r \geq r_{\rm max}&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;a^r \equiv a^{r+\lambda(n)} \pmod n &lt;/math&gt;

In particular, for [[squarefree]] &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;r_{\rm max} = 1&lt;/math&gt;), for all &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a \equiv a^{\lambda(n)+1} \pmod n &lt;/math&gt;

===Average and typical value===

For any ''x'' &gt; 16:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{x} \sum_{n \leq x} \lambda (n)  =  \frac{x}{\ln x} e^{B (1+o(1)) \ln\ln x / (\ln\ln\ln x)  }&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 3 in Erdős (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HBII194&gt;Sándor &amp; Crstici (2004) p.194&lt;/ref&gt;

Where ''B'' is a constant,

:&lt;math&gt;B = e^{-\gamma} \prod_p \left({1 - \frac{1}{(p-1)^2(p+1)}}\right) \approx 0.34537 \ . &lt;/math&gt;

For all numbers ''N'' and all except ''o''(''N'') positive integers ''n ≤ ''N'':
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(n) = n / (\ln n)^{\ln\ln\ln n + A  + o(1)}\,&lt;/math&gt;
where ''A'' is a constant,&lt;ref name=HBII194/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 2 in Erdős (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A = -1 + \sum_p \frac{\log p}{(p-1)^2} \approx 0.2269688 \ . &lt;/math&gt;

===Lower bounds===

For any sufficiently large number ''N'' and for any &lt;math&gt;\Delta \geq (\ln\ln N)^3&lt;/math&gt;, there are at most
:&lt;math&gt;Ne^{-0.69(\Delta\ln\Delta)^{1/3}}&lt;/math&gt;
positive integers &lt;math&gt;n \leq N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda(n) \leq ne^{-\Delta}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Theorem 5 in Friedlander (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

For any sequence &lt;math&gt;n_1&lt;n_2&lt;n_3&lt;\cdots&lt;/math&gt; of positive integers, any constant &lt;math&gt;0&lt;c&lt;1/\ln2&lt;/math&gt;, and any sufficiently large ''i'':
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda(n_i) &gt; (\ln n_i)^{c\ln\ln\ln n_i}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Theorem 1 in Erdős 1991"&gt;Theorem 1 in Erdős 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HBII193&gt;Sándor &amp; Crstici (2004) p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

===Small values===

For a constant ''c'' and any sufficiently large positive ''A'', there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;n&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lambda(n)&lt;(\ln A)^{c\ln\ln\ln A}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=HBII193/&gt;
Moreover, ''n'' is of the form
:&lt;math&gt;n=\prod_{(q-1)|m \text{ and } q \text{ is prime}}q&lt;/math&gt;
for some square-free integer &lt;math&gt;m&lt;(\ln A)^{c\ln\ln\ln A}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name="Theorem 1 in Erdős 1991"/&gt;

===Image of the function===
The set of values of the Carmichael function has counting function 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{x}{(\log x)^{\eta+o(1)}} \ ,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\eta=1-\frac{1+\log\log2}{\log2}=0.08607&lt;/math&gt;….&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | arxiv=1408.6506 | title=The image of Carmichael's ''λ''-function | first1=Kevin | last1=Ford | first2=Florian | last2=Luca | first3=Carl | last3=Pomerance | date=27 August 2014 | doi=10.2140/ant.2014.8.2009 | volume=8 | issue=8 | journal=Algebra &amp; Number Theory | pages=2009–2026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in cryptography==

The Carmichael function is important in [[cryptography]] due its use in
the [[RSA_(cryptosystem)|RSA encryption algorithm]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1378">In [[mathematics]], particularly in the fields of [[nonlinear dynamics]] and the [[calculus of variations]], the '''Chaplygin problem''' is an isoperimetric problem with a [[derivative|differential]] [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]].  Specifically, the problem is to determine what flight path an airplane in a constant wind field should take in order to encircle the maximum possible area.  The airplane is assumed to be constrained to move in a plane, moving at a constant [[airspeed]] ''v'', and the wind is assumed to move in a constant direction with speed ''w''.

The solution of the problem is that the airplane should travel in an [[ellipse]] whose eccentricity is ''w''/''v''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10984">In [[graph theory]], a branch of mathematics, a '''chordal completion''' of a given [[undirected graph]] {{mvar|G}} is a [[chordal graph]], on the same vertex set, that has {{mvar|G}} as a subgraph.
A '''minimal chordal completion''' is a chordal completion such that any graph formed by removing an edge would no longer be a chordal completion. The '''minimum chordal completion''' is a chordal completion with as few edges as possible. 

A different type of chordal completion, one that minimizes the size of the [[maximum clique]] in the resulting chordal graph, can be used to define the [[treewidth]] of {{mvar|G}}. Chordal completions can also be used to characterize several other graph classes including AT-free graphs, [[claw-free graph|claw-free]] AT-free graphs, and [[cograph]]s.

The minimum chordal completion was one of twelve computational problems whose complexity was listed as open in the 1979 book ''[[Computers and Intractability]]''.
Applications of chordal completion include modeling the problem of minimizing fill-in when performing [[Gaussian elimination]] on [[sparse matrix|sparse]] [[symmetric matrices]], and reconstructing [[phylogenetic tree]]s.

Chordal completions of a graph are sometimes called triangulations,&lt;ref name="ps97"/&gt; but this term is ambiguous even in the context of graph theory, as it can also refer to maximal [[planar graph]]s.

==Related graph families==
A graph {{mvar|G}} is an [[AT-free graph]] if and only if all of its minimal chordal completions are [[interval graph]]s. {{mvar|G}} is a [[claw-free graph|claw-free]] AT-free graph if and only if all of its minimal chordal completions are proper interval graphs. And {{mvar|G}} is a [[cograph]] if and only if all of its minimal chordal completions are [[trivially perfect graph]]s.&lt;ref name="ps97"&gt;{{citation

A graph {{mvar|G}} has [[treewidth]] at most {{mvar|k}} if and only if {{mvar|G}} has at least one chordal completion whose [[maximum clique]] size is at most {{math|''k'' + 1}}. It has [[pathwidth]] at most {{mvar|k}} if and only if {{mvar|G}} has at least one chordal completion that is an interval graph with maximum clique size at most {{math|''k'' + 1}}.

==Applications==
The original application of chordal completion described in ''[[Computers and Intractability]]'' involves [[Gaussian elimination]] for [[sparse matrix|sparse matrices]]. During the process of Gaussian elimination, one wishes to minimize fill-in, coefficients of the matrix that were initially zero but later become nonzero, because the need to calculate the values of these coefficients slows down the algorithm. The pattern of nonzeros in a sparse [[symmetric matrix]] can be described by an undirected graph (having the matrix as its [[adjacency matrix]]); the pattern of nonzeros in the filled-in matrix is always a chordal graph, any minimal chordal completion corresponds to a fill-in pattern in this way. If a chordal completion of a graph is given, a sequence of steps in which to perform Gaussian elimination to achieve this fill-in pattern can be found by computing an elimination ordering of the resulting chordal graph. In this way, the minimum fill-in problem can be seen as equivalent to the minimum chordal completion problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | title = Graph theory and computing
 | year = 1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this application, [[planar graph]]s may arise in the solution of two-dimensional finite element systems; it follows from the [[planar separator theorem]] that every planar graph with {{mvar|n}} vertices has a chordal completion with at most {{math|''O''(''n'' log ''n'')}} edges.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Another application comes from [[phylogeny]], the problem of reconstructing evolutionary trees, for instance trees of organisms subject to genetic mutations or trees of sets of ancient manuscripts copied one from another subject to scribal errors. If one assumes that each genetic mutation or scribal error happens only once, one obtains a [[perfect phylogeny]], a tree in which the species or manuscripts having any particular characteristic always form a connected subtree. As {{harvtxt|Buneman|1974}} describes, the existence of a perfect phylogeny can be modeled as a chordal completion problem. One draws an "overlap graph" {{mvar|G}} in which the vertices are attribute values (specific choices for some characteristic of a species or manuscript) and the edges represent pairs of attribute values that are shared by at least one species. The vertices of the graph can be [[graph coloring|colored]] by the identities of the characteristics that each attribute value comes from, so that the total number of colors equals the number of characteristics used to derive the phylogeny. Then a perfect phylogeny exists if and only if {{mvar|G}} has a chordal completion that respects the coloring.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Computational complexity==
Although listed as an [[open problem]] in the 1979 book ''[[Computers and Intractability]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Garey-Johnson}}, [OPEN4], p.&amp;nbsp;286; update, p.&amp;nbsp;339.&lt;/ref&gt; the computational complexity of the minimum chordal completion problem (also called the '''minimum fill-in''' problem) was quickly resolved: {{harvtxt|Yannakakis|1981}} showed it to be [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | title = Computing the minimum fill-in is NP-complete
 | volume = 2
 | year = 1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; If the minimum chordal completion adds {{mvar|k}} edges to a graph {{mvar|G}}, then it is possible to find a chordal completion using at most {{math|8''k''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} added edges, in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 | pages = 1067–1079
 | title = A polynomial approximation algorithm for the minimum fill-in problem
 | volume = 30
 | year = 2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of finding the optimal set of {{mvar|k}} edges to add can also be solved by a [[parameterized complexity|fixed-parameter tractable algorithm]], in time polynomial in the graph size and subexponential in&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|k}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[treewidth]] (minimum clique size of a chordal completion) and related parameters including pathwidth and tree-depth are also NP-complete to compute, and (unless P=NP) cannot be approximated in polynomial time to within a constant factor of their optimum values; however, [[approximation algorithm]]s with logarithmic approximation ratios are known for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Both the minimum fill-in and treewidth problems can be solved in [[exponential time]]. More precisely, for an {{mvar|n}}-vertex graph, the time is {{math|''O''(1.9601&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

'''Claude Jacques Berge''' (5 June 1926 – 30 June 2002) was a [[French people|French]] [[mathematician]], recognized as one of the modern founders of [[combinatorics]] and [[graph theory]].

==Biography and professional history==
Claude Berge was the son of [[André Berge]] and Geneviève Fourcade, and the great-grandson of French President [[Félix Faure]].  Claude was the second of six children; his siblings were Nicole, Antoine, Philippe, Edith and Patrick.  He married Jane Gentaz on December 29, 1952 and had one child, Delphine, born March 1, 1964.&lt;ref name="whoswho"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="biography"&gt;{{MacTutor|id=Berge|title=Claude Jacques Roger Berge}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although Claude Berge was unsure if he wanted study mathematics, instead often leaning towards literature,&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;&lt;ref name="tribute"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; after studying at the {{Interlanguage link multi|École des Roches|fr}} in [[Verneuil-sur-Avre]], he attended the [[University of Paris]] to study mathematics and earned his Ph.D. in 1953, advised by [[André Lichnerowicz]].  At the University of Paris, Berge wrote several papers including his doctorate thesis paper ''Sur une théorie ensembliste des jeux alternatifs.'' In this paper, Berge examines properties of games where there is perfect information available and there are infinite choices for each move.  This thesis served as the basis of a 55-page paper published in 1953.&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;

Beginning in 1952 he was a Research Assistant at the [[French National Centre for Scientific Research]] (CNRS), and from 1957 to 1964 he was a Professor at the Institute of Statistics at the [[University of Paris]]. From 1965 to 1967 he directed the International Computing Center in Rome. He was also associated with the Centre d'Analyse et de Mathématique Sociales (CAMS), a research center of [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales]]. He held visiting positions at [[Princeton University]] in 1957, [[Pennsylvania State University]] in 1968, and [[New York University]] in 1985, and was a frequent visitor to the [[Indian statistical institute]], Calcutta.&lt;ref name="whoswho" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biography" /&gt;

==Mathematical contributions==
Berge wrote five books, on [[game theory]] (1957), graph theory and its applications (1958), [[topological space]]s (1959), principles of combinatorics (1968) and [[hypergraph]]s (1970), each being translated in several languages. These books helped bring the subjects of graph theory and combinatorics out of disrepute by highlighting the successful practical applications of the subjects.&lt;ref name="tribute" /&gt; He is particularly remembered for two conjectures on [[perfect graph]]s that he made in the early 1960s but were not proved until significantly later:
*A graph is perfect if and only if its [[complement graph|complement]] is perfect, proven by [[László Lovász]] in 1972 and now known as the [[perfect graph theorem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

He is also known for his [[maximum theorem]] in optimization and for [[Berge's lemma]],  which states that a matching ''M'' in a graph ''G'' is maximum if and only if there is in ''G'' no [[augmenting path]] with respect to ''M''.

==Wordplay==
In addition to mathematics, Claude Berge enjoyed literature, sculpture, and art.  Berge co-founded the French literary group [[Oulipo]] with novelists and other mathematicians in 1960 to create new forms of literature. In this association, he wrote a murder mystery based on a mathematical theorem: ''Who killed the Duke of Densmore?''  In an adaptation of this story, the Duke of Densmore is killed by an explosion.  10 years later, Sherlock Holmes and Watson are called to investigate this unsolved case.  Using the testimonies of the Duke's seven ex-wives and his knowledge of [[interval graph]]s, Holmes is able to determine which one made multiple visits to the Duke and was able to plant the bomb.&lt;ref name="Duke1"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
Berge won the [[EURO Gold Medal]] from the [[Association of European Operational Research Societies]] in 1989,&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.euro-online.org/web/pages/608/last-activities-list EURO Gold Medal Laureates], European Association of Operational Research, retrieved 2015-05-21.&lt;/ref&gt; and (with [[Ronald Graham (mathematician)|Ronald Graham]]) the inaugural
[[Euler Medal]] from the [[Institute of Combinatorics and its Applications]] in 1993.&lt;ref name="biography"/&gt;

# The system computes the [[cryptographic hash]] of the plaintext in question.
# The system then encrypts the plaintext by using its hash as a key.

== Known Attacks ==
Convergent encryption is open to a "confirmation of a file attack" in which an attacker can effectively confirm whether a target possesses a certain file by encrypting an unencrypted, or [[plain-text]], version and then simply comparing the output with files possessed by the target.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tahoe-lafs.org/hacktahoelafs/drew_perttula.html] tahoe-lafs.org (2008-08-20). Retrieved on 2013-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt;  This attack poses a problem for a user storing information that is non-unique, i.e. also either publicly available or already held by the adversary - for example: [[banned books]] or files that cause [[copyright infringement]]. An argument could be made that a confirmation of a file attack is rendered less effective by adding a unique piece of data such as a few random characters to the plain text before encryption; this causes the uploaded file to be unique and therefore results in a unique encrypted file. However, some implementations of convergent encryption where the plain-text is broken down into blocks based on file content, and each block then independently convergently encrypted may inadvertently defeat attempts at making the file unique by adding bytes at the beginning or end.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssrc.ucsc.edu/Papers/storer-storagess08.pdf Storer, Greenan, Long &amp; Miller: "Secure Data Deduplication" University of California at Santa Cruz] (2008-10-31). Retrieved 2013-09-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more alarming than the confirmation attack is the "learn the remaining information attack" described by Drew Perttula in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tahoe-lafs.org/hacktahoelafs/drew_perttula.html] tahoe-lafs.org (2008-08-20). Retrieved on 2013-09-05.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of attack applies to the encryption of files that are only slight variations of a public document. For example, if the defender encrypts a bank form including a ten digit bank account number, an attacker that is aware of generic bank form format may extract defender's bank account number by producing bank forms for all possible bank account numbers, encrypt them and then by comparing those encryptions with defender's encrypted file deduce the bank account number. Note that this attack can be extended to attack a large number of targets at once (all spelling variations of a target bank customer in the example above, or even all potential bank customers), and the presence of this problem extends to any type of form document: tax returns, financial documents, healthcare forms, employment forms, etc. Also note that there is no known method for decreasing the severity of this attack -- adding a few random bytes to files as they are stored does not help, since those bytes can likewise be attacked with the "learn the remaining information" approach. The only effective approach to mitigating this attack is to encrypt the contents of files with a non-convergent secret before storing (negating any benefit from convergent encryption), or to simply not use convergent encryption in the first place.

[[Image:Dedekind Eta.jpg|right|thumb|500px|Dedekind η-function in the upper half-plane]]
In [[mathematics]], the '''Dedekind eta function''', named after [[Richard Dedekind]], is a [[modular form]] of weight 1/2 and is a function defined on the [[upper half-plane]] of [[complex number]]s, where the imaginary part is positive.

==Definition==
For any complex number &lt;math&gt;\tau &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Im}(\tau) &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;, let &lt;math&gt; q= e^{2\pi i \tau}&lt;/math&gt;, then the eta function is defined by,

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(\tau) = e^{\frac{\pi \rm{i} \tau}{12}} \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-e^{2 n\pi \rm{i} \tau})=q^{\frac{1}{24}} \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} (1-q^{n}) .&lt;/math&gt;

The notation &lt;math&gt;q \equiv e^{2\pi \rm{i} \tau}\,&lt;/math&gt; is now standard in [[number theory]], though many older books use ''q'' for  the [[nome (mathematics)|nome]] &lt;math&gt;e^{\pi \rm{i} \tau}\,&lt;/math&gt;. Raising the eta equation to the 24th power and multiplying by (2π)&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; gives

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(\tau)=(2\pi)^{12}\eta^{24}(\tau)&lt;/math&gt;

where Δ is the [[modular discriminant]].  The presence of [[24 (number)|24]] can be understood by connection with other occurrences, such as in the 24-dimensional [[Leech lattice]].

The eta function is [[Holomorphic function|holomorphic]] on the upper half-plane but cannot be continued analytically beyond it.

[[File:Q-Eulero.jpeg|thumb|right|Modulus of Euler phi on the unit disc, colored so that black=0, red=4]]
[[Image:Discriminant real part.jpeg|thumb|right|The real part of the modular discriminant as a function of ''q''.]]

The eta function satisfies the [[functional equation]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Siegel, C.L.|title=A Simple Proof of &lt;math&gt;\eta(-1/\tau) = \eta(\tau)\sqrt{\tau/{\rm{i}}}\,&lt;/math&gt;|journal=Mathematika|year=1954|volume=1|page=4|doi=10.1112/S0025579300000462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(\tau+1) =e^{\frac{\pi {\rm{i}}}{12}}\eta(\tau),\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(-\tfrac{1}{\tau}) = \sqrt{-{\rm{i}}\tau} \eta(\tau).\,&lt;/math&gt;

More generally, suppose ''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'',&amp;nbsp;''d'' are integers with ''ad''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''bc''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, so that

:&lt;math&gt;\tau\mapsto\frac{a\tau+b}{c\tau+d}&lt;/math&gt;

is a transformation belonging to the [[modular group]].  We may assume that either ''c''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0, or ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 and ''d''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1.  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\eta \left( \frac{a\tau+b}{c\tau+d} \right) = 
\epsilon (a,b,c,d) (c\tau+d)^{\frac{1}{2}} \eta(\tau),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon (a,b,c,d)=e^{\frac{b{\rm{i}} \pi}{12}}\quad(c=0,d=1);&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\epsilon (a,b,c,d)=e^{{\rm{i}}\pi [\frac{a+d}{12c} - s(d,c)
-\frac{1}{4}]}\quad(c&gt;0).&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;s(h,k)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dedekind sum]]

:&lt;math&gt;s(h,k)=\sum_{n=1}^{k-1} \frac{n}{k}
\left( \frac{hn}{k} - \left\lfloor \frac{hn}{k} \right\rfloor -\frac{1}{2} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Because of these functional equations the eta function is a [[modular form]] of weight 1/2 and level 1 for a certain character of order 24 of the [[metaplectic group|metaplectic double cover]] of the modular group, and can be used to define other modular forms. In particular the [[modular discriminant]] of [[Weierstrass]] can be defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta(\tau) = (2 \pi)^{12} \eta(\tau)^{24}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and is a modular form of weight 12. (Some authors omit the factor of (2π)&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;, so that the series expansion has integral coefficients).

The [[Jacobi triple product]] implies that the eta is (up to a factor) a Jacobi [[theta function]] for special values of the arguments:

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(\tau) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \chi(n) \exp(\tfrac{1}{12} \pi i n^2 \tau),&lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

where &lt;math&gt;\chi(n)&lt;/math&gt; is "the" [[Dirichlet character]] modulo 12 with &lt;math&gt;\chi(\pm1) = 1&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\chi(\pm 5)=-1&lt;/math&gt;. Explicitly,

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(\tau) = e^{\tfrac{\pi i \tau}{12}}\vartheta(\tfrac{\tau+1}{2}; 3\tau).&lt;/math&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}
The [[Euler function]]

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(q) = \prod_{n=1}^{\infty} \left(1-q^n\right),&lt;/math&gt;

related to &lt;math&gt;\eta \,&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\phi(q)= q^{-1/24} \eta(\tau)\,&lt;/math&gt;, has a power series
by the [[Pentagonal number theorem|Euler identity]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi(q)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty (-1)^n q^{(3n^2-n)/2}.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the eta function is easy to compute numerically from either [[power series]], it is often helpful in computation to express other functions in terms of it when possible, and products and quotients of eta functions, called eta quotients, can be used to express a great variety of modular forms.

The picture on this page shows the modulus of the Euler function: the additional factor of &lt;math&gt;q^{1/24}&lt;/math&gt; between this and eta makes almost no visual difference whatsoever (it only introduces a tiny pinprick at the origin).  Thus, this picture can be taken as a picture of eta as a function of ''q''.

== Combinatoric identities==
The theory of the [[algebraic character]]s of the [[affine Lie algebra]]s gives rise to a large class of previously unknown identities for the eta function. These identities follow from the [[Weyl-Kac character formula]], and more specifically from the so-called "denominator identities". The characters themselves allow the construction of generalizations of the [[Jacobi theta function]] which transform under the [[modular group]]; this is what leads to the identities. An example of one such new identity&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Jurgen|last= Fuchs|title=Affine Lie Algebras and Quantum Groups|year=1992|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-48412-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; is

:&lt;math&gt;\eta(8\tau)\eta(16\tau) = \sum_{m,n\in \mathbb{Z} \atop m \le |3n|} 
(-1)^m q^{(2m+1)^2 - 32n^2} 
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;q=\exp 2\pi i \tau&lt;/math&gt; is the [[q-analog]] or "deformation" of the [[highest weight]] of a module.

==Special values==

The above connection with the Euler function together with the special values of the latter, it can be easily deduced that

: &lt;math&gt;
\eta(i)=\frac{\Gamma \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}{2 \pi ^{3/4}}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\eta\left(\tfrac{1}{2}i\right)=\frac{\Gamma \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}{2^{7/8} \pi ^{3/4}}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\eta(2i)=\frac{\Gamma \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}{2^{{11}/8} \pi ^{3/4}}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\eta(3i)=\frac{\Gamma \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}{2(3^{1/3}) (3+2 \sqrt{3})^{1/12} \pi ^{3/4}}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\eta(4i)=\frac{\sqrt[4]{-1+\sqrt{2}}\; \Gamma \left(\frac{1}{4}\right)}{2^{{29}/16} \pi ^{3/4}}
&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\eta(e^{2\pi i/3})=e^{-\frac{\pi i}{24}}\frac{\sqrt[8]{3}  \Gamma \left(\frac{1}{3}\right)^{3/2}}{2 \pi }
&lt;/math&gt;

==Eta quotients==

Quotients of the Dedekind eta function at imaginary quadratic arguments may be [[algebraic number|algebraic]], while combinations of eta quotients may even be [[integer|integral]]. For example, define,

:&lt;math&gt;j(\tau)=\Big(\big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)}{\eta(2\tau)}\big)^{8}+2^8 \big(\tfrac{\eta(2\tau)}{\eta(\tau)}\big)^{16}\Big)^3&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;j_{2A}(\tau)=\Big(\big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)}{\eta(2\tau)}\big)^{12}+2^6 \big(\tfrac{\eta(2\tau)}{\eta(\tau)}\big)^{12}\Big)^2&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;j_{3A}(\tau) =\Big(\big(\tfrac{\eta(\tau)}{\eta(3\tau)}\big)^{6}+3^3 \big(\tfrac{\eta(3\tau)}{\eta(\tau)}\big)^{6}\Big)^2&lt;/math&gt;

then,

:&lt;math&gt;j\Big(\tfrac{1+\sqrt{-163}}{2}\Big) = -640320^3,\quad e^{\pi\sqrt{163}} \approx 640320^3+743.99999999999925\dots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;j_{2A}\Big(\tfrac{\sqrt{-58}}{2}\Big) = 396^4,\qquad \quad e^{\pi\sqrt{58}}\approx 396^4-104.00000017\dots&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;j_{3A}\Big(\tfrac{1+\sqrt{-89/3}}{2}\Big) = -300^3,\quad e^{\pi\sqrt{89/3}}\approx 300^3+41.999971\dots&lt;/math&gt;

and so on, values which appear in [[Ramanujan–Sato series]].

In [[mathematics]], a '''developable surface''' (or '''torse''': archaic) is a smooth [[surface (mathematics)|surface]] with zero [[Gaussian curvature]].  That is, it is a surface that can be [[Flatness (mathematics)|flattened]] onto a [[Plane (mathematics)|plane]] without [[distortion]] (i.e. "stretching" or "compressing").  Conversely, it is a surface which can be made by [[Transformation (mathematics)|transforming]] a plane (i.e. "folding", "bending", "rolling", "cutting" and/or "gluing"). In three dimensions all developable surfaces are [[ruled surface]]s (but not vice versa). There are developable surfaces in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; which are not ruled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Hilbert | first1=David | author1-link=David Hilbert | last2=Cohn-Vossen | first2=Stephan | author2-link=Stephan Cohn-Vossen | title=Geometry and the Imagination | publisher=Chelsea | location=New York | edition=2nd | isbn=978-0-8284-1087-8 | year=1952 | pages=341–342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Particulars==

The developable surfaces which can be realized in [[three-dimensional space]] include:

*[[Cylinder (geometry)|Cylinder]]s and, more generally, the "generalized" cylinder; its [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] may be any [[smooth function|smooth]] [[curve]]
*[[Cone (geometry)|Cone]]s and, more generally, [[conical surface]]s; away from the [[apex (geometry)|apex]]
* The [[oloid]] and the [[sphericon]] are members of a special family of [[solid (geometry)|solids]] that develop their entire surface when [[rolling]] down a flat plane.
* Planes (trivially); which may be viewed as a cylinder whose cross-section is a [[Line (mathematics)|line]]
*[[Tangent developable]] surfaces; which are constructed by extending the [[tangent]] lines of a spatial curve.
* The [[torus]] has a metric under which it is developable, which can be embedded into three-dimensional space by the [[Nash embedding theorem]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

Formally, in mathematics, a developable surface is a surface with zero [[Gaussian curvature]].  One consequence of this is that all "developable" surfaces embedded in 3D-space are [[ruled surface]]s (though [[hyperboloid]]s are examples of ruled surfaces which are not developable).  Because of this, many developable surfaces can be [[Scientific visualization|visualised]] as the surface formed by moving a straight line in space.  For example, a cone is formed by keeping one [[point (geometry)|end-point]] of a line fixed whilst moving the other end-point in a [[circle]].

===Application===

Developable surfaces have several practical applications.  Many [[cartography|cartographic]] [[map projections|projections]] involve projecting the [[Earth]] to a developable surface and then "unrolling" the surface into a region on the plane.  Since they may be constructed by bending a flat sheet, they are also important in [[manufacturing]] objects from [[sheet metal]], [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]], and [[plywood]]. An [[industry]] which uses developed surfaces extensively is [[shipbuilding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Nolan | first1=T. J. | title=Computer-Aided Design of Developable Hull Surfaces | publisher=University Microfilms International | location=Ann Arbor| year=1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Non-developable surface ==

Most smooth surfaces (and most surfaces in general) are not developable surfaces. '''Non-developable surfaces''' are variously referred to as having "'''double curvature'''", "'''doubly curved'''", "'''compound curvature'''", "'''non-zero Gaussian curvature'''", etc.

Some of the most often-used non-developable surfaces are:

* [[Sphere]]s are not developable surfaces under any [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]] as they cannot be unrolled onto a plane.
* The [[helicoid]] is a ruled surface – but unlike the ruled surfaces mentioned above, it is not a developable surface.
* The [[hyperbolic paraboloid]] and the [[hyperboloid]] are slightly different doubly ruled surfaces – but unlike the ruled surfaces mentioned above, neither one is a developable surface.

=== Applications of non-developable surfaces ===

Many [[gridshell]]s and [[tensile structure]]s and similar constructions gain strength by using (any) doubly curved form.

In [[functional analysis]] and related areas of [[mathematics]] a '''dual pair''' or '''dual system''' is a pair of [[vector spaces]] with an associated [[bilinear map]] to the [[base field]].

A common method in functional analysis, when studying [[normed vector space]]s, is to analyze the relationship of the space to its [[continuous dual]], the vector space of all possible [[continuous linear form]]s on the original space. A dual pair generalizes this concept to arbitrary vector spaces, with the duality being expressed as a bilinear map. Using the bilinear map, [[semi norm]]s can be constructed to define a [[polar topology]] on the vector spaces and turn them into [[locally convex spaces]], generalizations of normed vector spaces.

==Definition==
A '''dual pair'''&lt;ref name=Jarchow&gt;{{cite book|last=Jarchow|first=Hans|title=Locally convex spaces|year=1981|location=Stuttgart|isbn=9783519022244|pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a 3-tuple &lt;math&gt;(X,Y,\langle , \rangle)&lt;/math&gt; consisting of two [[vector space]]s &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; over the same [[field (mathematics)|field]] &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; and a [[bilinear map]]
:&lt;math&gt;\langle , \rangle : X \times Y \to F&lt;/math&gt;
with
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in X \setminus \{0\} \quad \exists y \in Y : \langle x,y \rangle \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;
and 
:&lt;math&gt;\forall y \in Y \setminus \{0\} \quad \exists x \in X : \langle x,y \rangle \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;

If the vector spaces are finite dimensional this means that the bilinear form is [[degenerate bilinear form|non-degenerate]].

We call &lt;math&gt;\langle , \rangle&lt;/math&gt; the '''duality pairing''', and say that it puts &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; '''in duality'''.

When the two spaces are a vector space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; (or a [[Module (mathematics)|module]] over a [[Ring (mathematics)|ring]] in general) and its dual &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt;, we call the canonical duality pairing &lt;math&gt; \langle \cdot,\cdot \rangle : X^* \times X \rarr F : (\varphi, x) \mapsto \varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; the '''natural pairing'''.

We call two elements &lt;math&gt;x \in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y \in Y&lt;/math&gt; '''orthogonal''' if
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x, y\rangle = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
We call two sets &lt;math&gt;M \subseteq X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N \subseteq Y&lt;/math&gt; '''orthogonal''' if each pair of elements from &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; are orthogonal.

==Example==
A vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; together with its [[algebraic dual]] &lt;math&gt;V^*&lt;/math&gt; and the bilinear map defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x, f\rangle := f(x) \qquad x \in V \mbox{ , } f \in V^*&lt;/math&gt;
forms a dual pair.

A [[locally convex topological vector space]] &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; together with its [[Dual vector space#Continuous dual space|topological dual]] &lt;math&gt;E'&lt;/math&gt; and the bilinear map defined as 
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x, f\rangle := f(x) \qquad x \in E \mbox{ , } f \in E'&lt;/math&gt;
forms a dual pair. (To show this, the [[Hahn–Banach theorem]] is needed.)

For each dual pair &lt;math&gt;(X,Y,\langle , \rangle)&lt;/math&gt; we can define a new dual pair &lt;math&gt;(Y,X,\langle , \rangle')&lt;/math&gt; with
:&lt;math&gt;\langle , \rangle': (y,x) \mapsto \langle x , y\rangle&lt;/math&gt;

A [[sequence space]] &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and its [[beta dual]] &lt;math&gt;E^\beta&lt;/math&gt; with the bilinear map defined as
:&lt;math&gt;\langle x, y\rangle := \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} x_i y_i \quad x \in E , y \in E^\beta&lt;/math&gt; 
form a dual pair.

==Comment==
Associated with a dual pair &lt;math&gt;(X,Y,\langle , \rangle)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Injective function|injective]] linear map from &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;Y^*&lt;/math&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto (y \mapsto \langle x , y\rangle)&lt;/math&gt;
There is an analogous injective map from &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;X^*&lt;/math&gt;.

In particular, if either of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; is finite-dimensional, these maps are isomorphisms.

[[File:Intel engineer Russ Brown tests Ultrabrook for mechanical shock.jpg|thumb|An engineering technologist at [[Intel]] tests an [[ultrabook]] for [[mechanical shock]], using a hydraulic platform to model a 3-foot drop onto concrete]]
An '''engineering technologist''' is a professional trained in certain aspects of development and implementation of a respective area of [[technology]].  Engineering technology education is even more "applied" and less theoretical than [[engineering]] science education, though in a broad sense both have a focus on practical application. Engineering Technologists often assist professional engineers but after years of experience they can also lead engineers.&lt;ref name=BLS3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tieements.org/ETMF/ETMF-Constitution.pdf}}{{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like engineers, areas where engineering technologists work can include product design (including improvement), fabrication, and testing. Also as with engineers, engineering technologists sometimes rise to senior management positions in industry, or become entrepreneurs.

Engineering technology often overlaps with many of the same general areas (e.g. design/development, testing), but the focus is even more on application than in engineering science (which is, in a somewhat different sense, also about application of science). Technologists are more likely than engineers to focus on (post-development) implementation or operation of a technology but this is not a strict rule as Technologists often do design original concepts. The National Society of Professional Engineers (NSPE) in the USA summarizes the distinction as being that engineers are trained more with conceptual skills to "function as designers," while technologists "apply others' designs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nspe.org/GovernmentRelations/TakeAction/IssueBriefs/ib_eng_tech.html|title= Engineering Technology|work=NSPE Issue Briefs|publisher=[[NSPE]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316114022/http://www.nspe.org/GovernmentRelations/TakeAction/IssueBriefs/ib_eng_tech.html|archivedate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mathematics and sciences, as well as other technical courses, in ''technology'' programs, tend to be taught with more application-based examples, whereas ''engineering'' coursework provides a more theoretical foundation in math and science (because those are the very subjects that engineers apply directly). Moreover, engineering coursework tends to require higher-level mathematics, including calculus and beyond, as well as more extensive knowledge of the natural sciences applied in design&lt;ref name=BLS6&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering vs. Engineering Technology
|url=http://www.abet.org/engineering-vs-engineering-technology/|publisher=Abet,Inc,|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which also serve to prepare students for research (whether in graduate studies, or industrial R&amp;D).  Engineering technology courses generally have more labs associated with their undergraduate courses that require hands-on application of the studied topics.


== Nature of work ==
Technologists are employed in a wide array of industries and areas - including product development, manufacturing, technology operation, and maintenance. They may be managers, depending on the technologist's experience, and educational emphasis on management.  Entry-level positions relating in various ways to [[product design]], [[Product testing|testing]], [[New product development|product development]], [[Software development methodology|systems development]], field engineering, technical operations, and [[quality control]] are common for engineering technology graduates.

In general, the work of engineering technologists focuses more often on practical application '''''of''' engineered products and processes'' for a range of purposes, whereas the work of [[engineer]]s emphasizes application '''''of''' math and science'' for design/development purposes (in ways that tend to require a more extensive theoretical foundation of mathematics and the natural sciences). The [[National Society of Professional Engineers]] (NSPE) describes the difference between engineering and engineering technology as follows:
:"The distinction between engineering and engineering technology emanates primarily from differences in their educational programs.  Engineering programs are geared toward development of conceptual skills and consist of a sequence of engineering fundamentals and design courses, built on a foundation of complex mathematics and science courses.  Engineering technology programs are oriented toward application, and provide their students introductory mathematics and science courses, and only a qualitative introduction to engineering fundamentals.  Thus, engineering programs provide their graduates a breadth and depth of knowledge that allows them to function as designers.  Engineering technology programs prepare their graduates to apply others' designs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nspe.org/GovernmentRelations/TakeAction/IssueBriefs/ib_eng_tech.html|title= Engineering Technology|work=NSPE Issue Briefs|publisher=[[NSPE]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316114022/http://www.nspe.org/GovernmentRelations/TakeAction/IssueBriefs/ib_eng_tech.html|archivedate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) summarizes engineering technology as "the application of scientific and engineering knowledge and methods combined with technical skills in support of engineering activities; it lies in the occupational spectrum between the craftsman and the engineer at the end of the spectrum closest to the engineer."&lt;ref&gt;http://wmich.edu/engineer/ceee/miller/082903/Lecture%20Notes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition, ABET has stated: "Engineering and technology are separate, but intimately related professions.  Here are some of the ways they differ:

Engineers generally focus more on [[conceptual design]] and product development, while technologists are more likely to work in testing, fabrication/construction, or field work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://et.uncc.edu/engineering-vs-engineering-technology.html|title=Engineering vs. Engineering Technology|publisher=Department of Engineering Technology and Construction Management, The [[University of North Carolina]] at Charlotte|access-date=2010-08-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906151743/http://et.uncc.edu/engineering-vs-engineering-technology.html|archive-date=2010-09-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, those areas overlap considerably (e.g., testing and fabrication are often integral to the overall product development process, and can involve engineers as well as technologists). In 2012, The Journal of Engineering Technology, published results that show "that a very broad range of engineering companies operating across the full spectrum of engineering services and products, baccalaureate engineering technology graduates are operating as engineers. Moreover, these graduates function in many engineering roles equally as well as their contemporaries from engineering."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Engineering Technologists Are Engineers|url=http://www.engtech.org/docs/Jet_Article_re_Survey.pdf|work=Ronald E. Land (2012)|publisher=American Society for Engineering Education Engineering Technology Council: The Journal of Engineering Technology|accessdate=March 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and accreditation==
Beginning in the 1950s and 1960s, some post-secondary institutions in the U.S.and Canada began offering degrees in engineering technology, focusing on applied study rather than the more theoretical engineering science degrees.  The focus on applied study addressed a need within the scientific, manufacturing, and engineering communities, as well as other industries, for professionals with hands-on and applications-based engineering knowledge.  Depending on the institution, [[associate's degree|associate's]] and/or [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] degrees are offered, with some institutions also offering [[postgraduate education|advanced degrees]] in technology.

In general, an engineering technologist receives a broad range of [[applied science]] and [[applied mathematics]] training, as well as the fundamentals of engineering in the student's area of focus.  Engineering technology programs typically include instruction in various engineering support functions for research, production, and operations, and applications to specific engineering specialties.&lt;ref&gt;

A technologist is also expected to have had some coursework in [[ethics]].

International technology organizations from eight nations have signed a mutual recognition agreement called the [[Sydney Accord]], which represents an understanding that the academic awards of technologists can be recognized in all signatory states.  The recognition of the Sydney Accord for technologists can be compared to the [[Washington Accord]] for [[engineer]]s and the [[Dublin Accord]] for [[engineering technician]]s.  The [[Engineering Technologist Mobility Forum]] is an international forum held by signatories of the Sydney Accord to explore mutual recognition for experienced engineering technologists and to remove artificial barriers to the free movement and practice of engineering technologists amongst their countries.

Graduates acquiring an associate degree or lower typically find careers as [[engineering technicians]].  According to the United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]: "Many four-year colleges offer bachelor's degrees in engineering technology, and graduates of these programs are hired to work as entry-level electrical or electronics engineers or applied engineers, but not technicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Engineering Technicians
  | work = Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010-11 Edition

 | accessdate = 2012-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Technicians typically hold a two-year associate degree, while technologists likewise hold a bachelor's degrees.

Internationally, the [[Sydney Accord]] is an agreement signed in 2001 acknowledging the academic equivalence of accredited engineering technology programs in the signatory nations.  In some countries, only those individuals who have graduated from an [[school accreditation|accredited]] curriculum in engineering technology and have a significant amount of work experience in their field may become registered technologists.  A technologist's recognition may be in the form of a certification or a professional registration.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, the new occupational category of "technologist" was established in the 1960s in conjunction with an emerging system of community colleges and [[Institute of technology|technical institutes]].  It was designed to effectively bridge the gap between the increasingly theoretical nature of engineering science degrees and the predominantly practical approach of [[technician]] and trades programs.  Provincial associations may certify individuals as a [[Professional Technologist]] (P.Tech), [[Certified Engineering Technologist]] (C.E.T.), [[Professional Technologist#Registered Engineering Technologist - Alberta - R.E.T.|Registered Engineering Technologist (R.E.T.)]], [[Applied Science Technologist]] (AScT) or Technologue Professionel [T.P.].  These provincial associations are constituent members of the [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]] (CCTT), which nationally accredits technology programs across Canada through its [[Canadian Technology Accreditation Board]] (CTAB).  Nationally accredited engineering technology programs range from two to three years in length, depending on the province, often containing as many classroom hours as a 4-year degree program.

===United States===
In the United States, the hierarchy of educational structure and acknowledgement start at the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] or the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA).  The U.S. Department of Education acknowledges regional and national [[accreditation]]s, and CHEA recognizes specialty accreditations.  Two technology accreditations are currently recognized by CHEA: The [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE) and the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). Specifically, CHEA recognizes ABET internationally and in the U.S. for accrediting engineering technology programs at the associate and baccalaureate level. CHEA also recognizes ATMAE for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in the United States. (2011).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf ATMAE Scope of Recognition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231001220/http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf |date=December 31, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

ABET has been accrediting engineering technology programs in the United States since 1946, with a total of over 600 programs at more than 230 institutions.  In response to heavy demand, ABET began accrediting engineering technology programs internationally in 2007.  Depending on the institution, associate's and/or bachelor's degrees are offered, with a few institutions also offering [[postgraduate education|advanced degrees]].  The type, length, and quality of education offered can vary greatly depending on the educational institution and the specialty pursued within engineering technology. ATMAE-accredited engineering technology programs require a management core.

The Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission (ETAC) of [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] was admitted as a provisional member of International Technology Accords in 2007, and it signed the Sydney Accord in 2009.

Other U.S. [[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]] and CHEA-recognized accrediting agencies in the U.S.—(such as the [[Distance Education and Training Council|Distance Education and Training Council (DETC)]] Accrediting Council and the [[Accrediting Council for Independent Colleges and Schools]] (ACICS)—accredit colleges and universities with programs leading to bachelor's and master's degrees in engineering and engineering technologies.

The publication of the US Department of Education and the National Science Foundation known as Mapping The World of Education indicates that an engineering technologist degree is at the same academic level (60) as an ABET/EAC engineering degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/ | title=Mapping the World of Education: The Comparative Database System (CDS) | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430062653/https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/mapping/ | archivedate=2007-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification==
[[Professional certification]] is the registration of engineering technologists to assure their qualification within their countries or territories.  The Sydney Accord and the [[Engineering Technologist Mobility Forum]] (ETMF) are two international efforts to improve cross-border recognition for technologists.

A certified engineering technologist is usually required to [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] for a term before being able to apply for certification through a local [[Board of governors|governing body]].  In that time, the technologist must have completed tasks which directly apply to his or her area of study.

===North America===
In Canada, the regulated title for technologists is [[Certified Engineering Technologist]].  Technology program accreditation is administered through the [[Canadian Technology Accreditation Board]] (CTAB), often in conjunction with provincial associations affiliated with the [[Canadian Council of Technicians and Technologists]].  Graduated technologists are certified by their provincial bodies.

In the United States, technologist certification requires a bachelor's degree in an engineering technology program accredited by the Engineering Technology Accreditation Commission of the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ETAC/ABET). One may also obtain a degree from an institution accredited through The [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (formerly known as the National Association of Industrial Technology).  Technologist registration in the United States is conducted by many independent societies and organizations.  A government-sponsored registration is opposed by the [[National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying|National Council of Examiners for Engineering and Surveying (NCEES)]] and NSPE.  As a result, the profession is often not seen as an independent field separate from design engineering.

The [[National Institute for Certification in Engineering Technologies]] (NICET) awards certification at two levels depending on work experience: the Associate Engineering Technologist (AT) and the [[Certified Engineering Technologist]] (CT).  The [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE) awards two levels of certification in technology management: Certified Technology Manager (CTM) and Certified Senior Technology Manager (CSTM).  ATMAE also awards two levels of certification in manufacturing specialist: Certified Manufacturing Specialist (CMS) and Certified Senior Manufacturing Specialist (CSMS).  While the CTM and CMS certification are obtained through examination, the CSTM and CSMS require industry experience and continuous improvement via the obtainment of professional development units (PDUs).

American Society of Certified Engineering Technicians (ASCET) is a membership organization that issues Certified Member certifications to engineering technicians and engineering technologists.  Professional engineers are issued Registered Member certification.

===United Kingdom===

The United Kingdom has a decades-long tradition of producing engineering technologists via the apprenticeship system of learning.  U.K. engineering technologists have always been designated as "engineers". The term "engineer" in the UK is used to describe the entire range of skilled worker, and professionals from trades people through to the highly educated Chartered Engineer.  In fact up until the 1960s professional engineers in the UK were often referred to as "Technologists" to distinguish them from scientists, technicians and craftsmen.  The modern term for an engineering technologist is "incorporated engineer" (IEng), although since 2000 the normal route to achieving IEng is with a Bachelors or Honours Degree in engineering.  Modern technical apprenticeships would normally lead to the [[EngTech]] professional qualification and with further studies at higher apprenticeship level an [[IEng]].  Since 2015 the UK government ([[UCAS]]) has introduced engineering degree (Bachelors and Masters) apprenticeships. The title "incorporated engineer" is protected by civil law.  Prior to the title "incorporated engineer", U.K. technologists were known as "technician engineers" a designation introduced in the 1960s.

In the United Kingdom, an incorporated engineer is accepted as a "professional engineer", registered by the [[Engineering Council]], although the term "professional engineer" has no legal meaning in the U.K., and there are no restrictions on practice.  In fact, anyone in the U.K. can call themselves an "engineer" or "professional engineer" without any qualifications or proven competencies in engineering, and most U.K. skilled trades are sometimes referred to as "professional" or "accredited" engineers. Examples are "Registered Gas Engineer" (gas installer) or "Professional Telephone Engineer" (phone line installer or fault diagnosis).

Incorporated engineers are recognized internationally through the Sydney Accord academic agreement as engineering technologists.&lt;ref&gt;

One of the professional titles for engineers in the United Kingdom, recognized in the Washington Accord is the [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|chartered engineer]].  The incorporated engineer is a professional engineer as declared by the Engineering Council of the United Kingdom, and the European definition as demonstrated by the prescribed title under 2005/36/EC as an "engineer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/qualifications/regprof/index.cfm?fuseaction=regProf.show&amp;RPId=3359| title = Incorporated Engineer | work = Regulated professions database | publisher = [[European Commission]] | accessdate = 25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incorporated engineer operates autonomously and directs activities independently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.semta.org.uk/pdf/Factsheet%2035a.pdf|title=Employers Fact Sheet #35, Career Structure - Incorporated Engineer|publisher=SEMTA|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They do not necessarily need the support of chartered engineers because they are often acknowledged as full engineers in the U.K. (but not in Canada or the U.S.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/qualifications/regprof/index.cfm?fuseaction=profession.regProfs&amp;profId=6000 | title = Engineer | work = Regulated professions database | publisher = [[European Commission]] | accessdate = 25 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom incorporated engineer may also contribute to the design of new products and systems.

The chartered engineer and incorporated engineer are recognized as broadly comparable in stature, but with separate functions.  As a result, the chartered and incorporated engineer are placed under the same directive, 2005/36/EC.  The incorporated engineer can practice autonomously without the oversight of a chartered engineer.

Incorporated engineers currently require an IEng accredited bachelors or honours degree in engineering (prior to 1997 the B.Sc. and B.Eng. degrees satisfied the academic requirements for "chartered engineer" registration), a [[Higher National Certificate]] or diploma, [[City and Guilds]] higher diploma /  Full Technological Cert Diploma or a [[Foundation Degree]] in engineering, plus appropriate further learning to degree level or an NVQ4 or SVQ4 approved for the purpose by a licensed engineering institution.

The academic requirements must be accompanied by the appropriate peer reviewed experience in employment-typical 4 years post qualification.  In addition to the experience and academic requirements, the engineering candidate must have three referees (themselves CEng or IEng) that vouch for the performance of the individual being considered for professional recognition.  There are a number of alternative ways to achieve IEng status for those that do not have the necessary qualifications for applicants, that can clearly show they have achieved the same level as those with qualifications, including:

* writing a technical report, based upon their experience, and demonstrate their knowledge and understanding of engineering principles;
* earning the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]] Graduate Diploma (Bachelors level) and Post Graduate Diploma (Masters level) accredited by [[IMechE]], [[Institution of Engineering and Technology]], and [[Institution of Civil Engineers]]
* following a work-based learning programme; or 
* taking an academic programme specified by the institution to which they are applying.

====Engineering Technologist/State-certified Engineer====

The title 'state-certified engineer BVT' is awarded to qualified engineering technologists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Der Techniker Englisch {{!}} VdT|url = http://www.v-dt.de/content/der-techniker-englisch|website = www.v-dt.de|access-date = 2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (staatlich gepruefter Techniker) by the Bundesverband höherer Berufe der Technik, Wirtschaft und Gestaltung e.V. ("Association of Higher Professions for Technology and Design") or BVT, conditional on two years of professional experience, current BVT membership and payment of an administration fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unsere BVT-Urkunde im neuen Outfit|url = http://www.bvt-online.de/de/leistungen/bvt-urkunde/|website = www.bvt-online.de|access-date = 2016-02-14|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160309233504/http://www.bvt-online.de/de/leistungen/bvt-urkunde/|archivedate = 2016-03-09|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engineering technologist is a vocational, continuous professional development non-academic but equivalent qualification, awarded after successfully passing state examinations governed by German federal rules. To be eligible for the engineering technologist examination, candidates must fulfill the following requirements: completion of one of the school systems ([[Hauptschule]], [[Realschule]], [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]), an apprenticeship of at least two years duration, one year of completed professional work experience and attendance of a taught programme with a course load of 2400–3000 hours, usually completed within two years in full-time or 3.5 – 4 years part-time at vocational colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Staatlich geprüfter Techniker › Fernstudium &amp; Weiterbildung|url = http://www.staatlich-gepruefter-techniker.com/|website = www.staatlich-gepruefter-techniker.com|access-date = 2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2012, the state-certified engineer/engineering technologist was allocated to level 6 of the [[European Qualifications Framework]], equivalent to undergraduate degrees (Bachelor's level).  Furthermore, the engineering technologist constitutes an advanced entry qualification for German universities and in principal permits entry into any undergraduate academic degree program. The engineering technologist/state-certified engineer should not be confused with academically qualified engineers, which previously graduated from Universities as Diplom-Ingenieur (Diploma in Engineering) and following the Bologna process with BEng + MEng degrees.

====State-certified technicians/engineers in the EU directives====

As of January 31, 2012, state certified engineers, state certified business managers, and state certified designers are at level 6-Bachelor on the DQF and EQF.  The qualifications more than a decade ago were entered into [[Directive (European Union)|EU Directives]] as recognized regulated professions in Germany and the EU.  Annexes C and D were added to Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC.

Top institutions involved included the federal government (the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education and Research]] and the [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology]]), EU Standing Conference and Economic Ministerial Meeting of Countries, the German Confederation of Hand-plant, the [[Confederation of German Employers' Associations]], German Chambers of Industry and Commerce, [[Confederation of German Trade Unions]], and Federal Institute for Vocational Application.  These government institutions agreed on a common position on the implementation of the EQF and a German qualifications framework (DQR).

European Union law and other documents considered to be public include:
* http://eur-lex.europa.eu//en/index.htm
* Annexes C and D to Council Directive 92/51/EEC on a second general system for the recognition of professional education and training to supplement Directive 89/48/EEC
* EU Directive 2005L0036-EN 01.01.2007
* ANNEX III list of regulated education and training referred to in the third sub paragraph of Article 13(2)
* https://web.archive.org/web/20130929234628/http://www.scribd.com/doc/53286830/Directive-2005-36-EC

The qualifications framework requires: "regulated courses for the professions of state-certified ('staatlich gepruefte(r)') technician/engineer ('Techniker(in)'), business economist (business manager), ('Betriebswirt(in)'), designer ('Gestalter(in)') and family assistant ('Familiepfleger(in)'), of a total duration not less than 16 years, a prerequisite of which is successful completion of compulsory schooling or equivalent education and training (of a duration of not less than nine years) and successful completion of a course at a trade school ('Berufsschule') of a duration of not less than three years and comprising, upon completion of at least two years of work experience, full-time education and training of a duration of not less than two years or part-time education and training of equivalent duration."

===International engineering technologist (IntET)===
The international engineering technologist (IntET) qualification was launched in late 2007 by the Engineering Technologists Mobility Forum (ETMF), which is part of the International Engineering Alliance (IEA).  The qualification is awarded by each member jurisdiction followed by a jurisdictional identifier, such as IntET (UK) for the U.K.

In addition to the benefits gained through IEng professional qualification (an eligibility requirement), IntET (UK) offers additional benefits, including letters after name (such as "J. Smith IEng IntET (UK)") and easier admission to National Registers of IntET register member jurisdictions.  The Engineering Council and its fellow ETMF members are pursuing the possibility of future mutual recognition of professional titles, which would further enhance the benefits of IntET qualification.

The IntET (UK) qualification is open to U.K.-registered incorporated engineers who have met the requirements: seven years post-graduate experience, two years responsibility of significant engineering work, and maintaining continuing professional development.  Incorporated engineers who do not hold an accredited degree recognised under the Sydney Accord, or equivalent academic qualification, are currently not eligible to apply for IntET (UK) qualification.

In mathematics, a '''finitary relation''' has a finite number of "places". In [[set theory]] and [[logic]], a ''relation'' is a property that assigns [[truth values]] to &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-[[tuple]]s of individuals. Typically, the property describes a possible connection between the components of a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-tuple. For a given [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-tuples, a truth value is assigned to each &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-tuple according to whether the property does or does not hold.

An example of a ''[[ternary relation]]'' (i.e., between three individuals) is: "&lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; was introduced to &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;", where &lt;math&gt;\left(X, Y, Z\right)&lt;/math&gt; is a 3-tuple of persons; for example, "[[Beatrice Wood]] was introduced to [[Henri-Pierre Roché]] by [[Marcel Duchamp]]" is true, while "[[Karl Marx]] was introduced to [[Friedrich Engels]] by [[Queen Victoria]]" is false.

==Informal introduction==

''Relation'' is formally defined in the next section. In this section we introduce the concept of a relation with a familiar everyday example. Consider the relation involving three roles that people might play, expressed in a statement of the form "''X'' thinks that ''Y'' likes ''Z''&amp;nbsp;". The facts of a concrete situation could be organized in a table like the following:

{| class="wikitable" style="width:25em; text-align:center; margin:0.5em auto"
|+  Relation S : X thinks that Y likes Z
|-
! Person X !! Person Y !! Person Z
|-
| Alice || Bob ||Denise
|-
| Charles || Alice || Bob
|-
| Charles || Charles || Alice
|-
| Denise || Denise || Denise
|}

Each row of the table records a fact or makes an assertion of the form "''X'' thinks that ''Y'' likes ''Z''&amp;nbsp;". For instance, the first row says, in effect, "Alice thinks that Bob likes Denise". The table represents a relation ''S'' over the set ''P'' of people under discussion:

: ''P'' = {Alice, Bob, Charles, Denise}.

The data of the table are equivalent to the following set of ordered triples:

: ''S'' = {(Alice,&amp;nbsp;Bob,&amp;nbsp;Denise), (Charles,&amp;nbsp;Alice,&amp;nbsp;Bob), (Charles,&amp;nbsp;Charles,&amp;nbsp;Alice), (Denise,&amp;nbsp;Denise,&amp;nbsp;Denise)}.

It is usual to write ''S''(Alice,&amp;nbsp;Bob,&amp;nbsp;Denise) to say the same thing as the first row of the table. The relation ''S'' is a ''ternary'' relation, since there are ''three'' items involved in each row. The relation itself is a [[mathematical object]] defined in terms of concepts from [[set theory]] (i.e., the relation is a subset of the [[Cartesian product]] on {Person X, Person Y, Person Z}), that carries all of the information from the table in one neat package. Mathematically, then, a relation is simply an "ordered set".

The table for relation ''S'' is an extremely simple example of a [[relational database]]. The theoretical aspects of databases are the specialty of one branch of [[computer science]], while their practical impacts have become all too familiar in our everyday lives. Computer scientists, logicians, and mathematicians, however, tend to see different things when they look at these concrete examples and samples of the more general concept of a relation.

For one thing, databases are designed to deal with empirical data, and experience is always finite, whereas mathematics at the very least concerns itself with potential infinity. This difference in perspective brings up a number of ideas that may be usefully introduced at this point, if by no means covered in depth.

== Relations with a small number of "places" ==

The variable &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; giving the number of "''places''" in the relation, 3 for the above example, is a [[non-negative]] [[integer]], called the relation's ''[[arity]]'', ''adicity'', or ''[[dimension]]''. A relation with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; places is variously called a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;''-ary'', a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;''-adic'', or a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;''-dimensional'' relation. Relations with a finite number of places are called ''finite-place'' or ''[[finitary]]'' relations. It is possible to generalize the concept to include ''infinitary'' relations between infinitudes of individuals, for example [[infinite sequence]]s; however, in this article only finitary relations are discussed, which will from now on simply be called relations.

Since there is only one 0-tuple, the so-called empty tuple (&amp;nbsp;), there are only two zero-place relations: the one that always holds, and the one that never holds. They are sometimes useful for constructing the base case of an [[mathematical induction|induction]] argument. One-place relations are called '''unary relations'''. For instance, any set (such as the collection of [[Nobel laureates]]) can be viewed as a collection of individuals having some property (such as that of having been awarded the [[Nobel prize]]). Two-place relations are called [[binary relation]]s or, in the past, ''dyadic relations''.  [[Binary relation]]s are very common, given the ubiquity of relations such as:
* [[Equality (mathematics)|Equality]] and [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]], denoted by signs such as '&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;' and '&lt;math&gt;&lt;&lt;/math&gt;' in statements like '&lt;math&gt;5 &lt; 12&lt;/math&gt;';
* Being a [[divisor]] of, denoted by the sign '&lt;math&gt;\mid&lt;/math&gt;' in statements like '&lt;math&gt;13 \mid 143&lt;/math&gt;';
* [[Element (mathematics)|Set membership]], denoted by the sign '&lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;' in statements like '&lt;math&gt;1 \in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;'.

A &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;''-ary'' relation is a straightforward generalization of a binary relation.

==Formal definitions==
{{quote|When two objects, qualities, classes, or attributes, viewed together by the mind, are seen under some connexion, that connexion is called a relation.|[[Augustus De Morgan]]&lt;ref&gt;De Morgan, A. (1858) "On the syllogism, part 3" in Heath, P., ed. (1966) ''On the syllogism and other logical writings''. Routledge. P. 119,&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The simpler of the two definitions of ''k''-place relations encountered in mathematics is:

'''Definition 1.''' A '''relation''' ''L'' over the sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a [[subset]] of their [[Cartesian product]], written ''L'' ⊆ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;.

Relations are classified according to the number of sets in the defining Cartesian product, in other words, according to the number of terms following ''L''. Hence:
:* ''Lu'' denotes a unary relation or [[property (philosophy)|property]];
:* ''Luv'' or ''uLv'' denote a [[homogeneous relation]] when ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a [[heterogeneous relation]] when ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ ''X''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
:* ''Luvw'' denotes a [[ternary relation]];
:* ''Luvwx'' denotes a ''quaternary'' relation.
Relations with more than four terms are usually referred to as ''k''-ary or ''n''-ary, for example, "a 5-ary relation". A ''k''-ary relation is simply a set of ''k''-[[tuple]]s.

The second definition makes use of an idiom that is common in mathematics, stipulating that "such and such is an ''n''-tuple" in order to ensure that such and such a mathematical object is determined by the specification of ''n'' component mathematical objects. In the case of a relation ''L'' over ''k'' sets, there are ''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 things to specify, namely, the ''k'' sets plus a subset of their Cartesian product. In the idiom, this is expressed by saying that ''L'' is a (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple.

'''Definition 2.''' A relation ''L'' over the sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is a (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-tuple ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;''G''(''L'')), where ''G''(''L'') is a subset of the Cartesian product ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times;&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;&amp;times; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. ''G''(''L'') is called the ''graph'' of ''L''.

Elements of a relation are more briefly denoted by using boldface characters, for example, the constant element '''''a''''' = (a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;a&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) or the variable element '''''x''''' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;nbsp;…,&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;).

A statement of the form "'''''a''''' is in the relation ''L''&amp;nbsp;" or "'''''a''''' satisfies ''L''&amp;nbsp;" is taken to mean that '''''a''''' is in ''L'' under the first definition and that '''''a''''' is in ''G''(''L'') under the second definition.

The following considerations apply under either definition:
* The sets ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; for ''j'' = 1 to ''k'' are called the [[domain of a relation|domain]]s of the relation. Under the first definition, the relation does not uniquely determine a given sequence of domains.
* If all of the domains ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; are the same set ''X'', then it is simpler to refer to ''L'' as a ''k''-ary relation over ''X''.
* If any of the domains ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; is empty, then the defining Cartesian product is empty, and the only relation over such a sequence of domains is the empty relation ''L'' = &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt;. Hence it is commonly stipulated that all of the domains be nonempty.

As a rule, whatever definition best fits the application at hand will be chosen for that purpose, and anything that falls under it will be called a relation for the duration of that discussion. If it becomes necessary to distinguish the two definitions, an entity satisfying the second definition may be called an ''embedded'' or ''included'' relation.

If ''L'' is a relation over the domains ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, it is conventional to consider a sequence of terms called ''variables'', ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, …, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;, that are said to ''range over'' the respective domains.

Let a [[Boolean domain]] '''B''' be a two-element set, say, '''B''' = {0,&amp;nbsp;1}, whose elements can be interpreted as logical values, typically 0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;false and 1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;true. The [[indicator function|characteristic function]] of the relation ''L'', written ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; or χ(''L''), is the [[Boolean-valued function]] ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;…&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;'''B''', defined in such a way that ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;) = 1 just in case the ''k''-tuple &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is in the relation ''L''. Such a function can also be called an indicator function, particularly in probability and statistics, to avoid confusion with the notion of a [[characteristic function (probability theory)|characteristic function]] in probability theory.

It is conventional in applied mathematics, [[computer science]], and statistics to refer to a Boolean-valued function like ''ƒ''&lt;sub&gt;''L''&lt;/sub&gt; as a ''k''-place [[predicate (mathematics)|predicate]]. From the more abstract viewpoint of [[formal logic]] and [[model theory]], the relation ''L'' constitutes a ''logical model'' or a ''relational structure'' that serves as one of many possible [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]]s of some ''k''-place predicate symbol.

Because relations arise in many scientific disciplines as well as in many branches of [[mathematics]] and [[logic]], there is considerable variation in terminology. This article treats a relation as the [[set theory|set-theoretic]] [[extension (semantics)|extension]] of a relational concept or term. A variant usage reserves the term "relation" to the corresponding logical entity, either the [[comprehension (logic)|logical comprehension]], which is the totality of [[intension]]s or abstract properties that all of the elements of the relation in extension have in common, or else the symbols that are taken to denote these elements and intensions. Further, some writers of the latter persuasion introduce terms with more concrete connotations, like "relational structure", for the set-theoretic extension of a given relational concept.

== History ==
{{expand section|what about model theory or Codd?|date=April 2015}}
The logician [[Augustus De Morgan]], in work published around 1860, was the first to articulate the notion of relation in anything like its present sense. He also stated the first formal results in the theory of relations (on De Morgan and relations, see Merrill 1990). [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] restated and extended De Morgan's results.

In the 19th century Peirce, [[Gottlob Frege]], [[Georg Cantor]], [[Richard Dedekind]], and others advanced the theory of relations. Many of their ideas, especially on relations called [[order theory|orders]], were summarized in [[Principles of Mathematics]] (1903) by [[Bertrand Russell]].  Russell and [[A. N. Whitehead]] made free use of these results in their ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21442">In [[homological algebra]] and  [[algebraic geometry]], a '''flat module''' over a [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] ''R'' is an ''R''-[[module (mathematics)|module]] ''M'' such that taking the [[tensor product]] over ''R'' with ''M'' preserves [[exact sequence]]s. A module is '''faithfully flat''' if taking the tensor product with a sequence produces an exact sequence if and only if the original sequence is exact.

[[Vector space]]s over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] are flat modules.  [[Free module]]s, or more generally [[projective module]]s, are also flat, over any ''R''.  For [[finitely generated module]]s over a [[Noetherian ring]], flatness and projectivity are equivalent. For finitely generated modules over [[local ring]]s, flatness, projectivity and freeness are all equivalent.&lt;ref name="Matsumura"&gt;{{harvnb|Matsumura|1970|loc=Proposition 3.G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[field of quotients]] of an [[integral domain]], and, more generally, any [[localization of a ring|localization]] of a [[commutative ring]] are flat modules. The product of the [[local ring]]s of a commutative ring is a faithfully flat module.

Flatness  was introduced by {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Jean-Pierre Serre|last=Serre|year=1956}} in his  paper ''[[Géometrie Algébrique et Géométrie Analytique]]''. See also [[flat morphism]].

==Definition==

===Commutative rings===
Let ''M'' be an ''R''-module. The following conditions are all equivalent, so ''M'' is flat if it satisfies any (thus all) of them:
* The functor
::&lt;math&gt;F_M : \operatorname{Mod}(R) \to \operatorname{Mod}(R), \quad N \mapsto M \otimes_R N&lt;/math&gt;
:is exact, where &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Mod}(R)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[category of modules|category of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-modules]].
* For all [[prime ideal]]s &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{p}&lt;/math&gt; of ''R'', the module &lt;math&gt;M_{\mathfrak{p}}&lt;/math&gt; is a flat &lt;math&gt;R_{\mathfrak{p}}&lt;/math&gt;-module.
* For all [[maximal ideal]]s &lt;math&gt; \mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; of ''R'', the module &lt;math&gt;M_{\mathfrak{m}}&lt;/math&gt; is a flat &lt;math&gt;R_{\mathfrak{m}}&lt;/math&gt;-module.
* For every injective morphism &lt;math&gt;\phi : K \to L&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-modules &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, the induced map
::&lt;math&gt;F_M(\phi) : M \otimes_R K \to M \otimes_R L,&lt;/math&gt;
:is injective.
* For every finitely generated ideal &lt;math&gt;I \hookrightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;, the induced morphism &lt;math&gt;I \otimes_R M \to R \otimes_R M \cong M&lt;/math&gt; is injective.
* There exists a directed system of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-modules &lt;math&gt;\{ F_\alpha \}_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; with the following properties:
# For all &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;F_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a finitely generated, free &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module.
# The direct limit is &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\varinjlim_\alpha F_\alpha= M.&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bourbaki|loc=Ch. I, § 2. Proposition 13, Corollay 1.}}&lt;/ref&gt; For every linear dependency in &lt;math&gt;M,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;r^T x = \sum_{i=1}^k r_i x_i = 0,&lt;/math&gt;
:where &lt;math&gt;r_i \in R, x_i \in M&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a matrix &lt;math&gt;A \in R^{k \times j}&lt;/math&gt; such that
:# &lt;math&gt;Ay = x&lt;/math&gt; has a solution for some &lt;math&gt;y \in M^j.&lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt;r^T A = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
* For every &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;,
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tor}_1^R (N, M) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
* For every finitely generated ideal &lt;math&gt;I \subset R,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tor}_1^R (R/I, M) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
* For every map &lt;math&gt;f : F \to M&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is a finitely generated free &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module, and for every finitely generated &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-submodule &lt;math&gt;K \leq \ker f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; factors through a map to a free &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that kills &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;:

[[Image:FlatModule-01.png|center|Factor property of a flat module]]

===General rings===

When ''R'' isn't commutative one needs the more careful statement that, if ''M'' is a flat left ''R''-module, the tensor product with ''M'' maps exact sequences of right ''R''-modules to exact sequences of [[abelian group]]s.

Taking tensor products (over arbitrary rings) is always a [[right exact functor]]. Therefore, the ''R''-module ''M'' is flat if and only if for any [[injective]] [[module homomorphism|homomorphism]] ''K'' → ''L'' of ''R''-modules, the induced homomorphism ''K''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;''M'' → ''L''&lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt;''M'' is also injective.

== Examples ==
* For any multiplicatively closed subset &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; of a commutative ring &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;, the [[localization of a ring|localization ring]] &lt;math&gt;S^{-1}R&lt;/math&gt; is flat as an &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;-module. For example, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}&lt;/math&gt; is flat over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; (though not projective).
* Every free &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;-module (in fact any free module over a ring) is a flat module.
* For each integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 1, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is not flat over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, because &lt;math&gt;n: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}, \, x \mapsto nx&lt;/math&gt; is injective, but tensored with &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; it is not.
* Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is not flat over &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}.&lt;/math&gt;
* Let &lt;math&gt;R = k[t], k&lt;/math&gt; a field, and &lt;math&gt;S = R[x]/(tx - 1)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the same thing as the localization &lt;math&gt;R[t^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;, it is flat over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, &lt;math&gt;R[x]/(tx - t)&lt;/math&gt; is not flat over &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is a [[torsion element]] on it (so it is not torsion-free).
* Let &lt;math&gt;S = A[x_1, \dots, x_r]&lt;/math&gt; be a polynomial ring over a noetherian ring &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f \in S&lt;/math&gt; a nonzerodivisor. Then &lt;math&gt;S/fS&lt;/math&gt; is flat over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is [[primitive polynomial (ring theory)|primitive]] (the coefficients generate the unit ideal).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenbud|loc=Exercise 6.4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This yields an example of a flat module that is not free.
* Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a noetherian ring and &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; an ideal. Then the [[completion (ring theory)|completion]] &lt;math&gt;A \to \widehat{A}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matsumura|1970|loc=Corollary 1 of Theorem 55, p. 170}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is faithfully flat if and only if &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; is contained in the Jacobson radical of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Matsumura|1970|loc=Theorem 56}}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. [[Zariski ring]].)
* The direct sum &lt;math&gt;\bigoplus_{i \in I} M_i&lt;/math&gt; is flat if and only if each &lt;math&gt;M_i&lt;/math&gt; is flat.
* Every product of flat &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-modules is flat if and only if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[coherent ring]].&lt;ref&gt;http://mathoverflow.net/questions/120403/flatness-of-power-series-rings/&lt;/ref&gt;
* (Kunz) A noetherian ring containing a field of characteristic &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is [[regular ring|regular]] if and only if the [[Frobenius morphism]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; →&lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is flat and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is reduced.

==Case of commutative rings==

When  M is a [[finitely-generated module|finitely-generated]] R-module, being flat is the same as being locally free in the following sense: M is a flat R-module if and only if for every [[prime ideal]] (or even just for every [[maximal ideal]]) P of R, the [[localization of a module|localization]] &lt;math&gt;M_P&lt;/math&gt; is [[free module|free]] as a module over the [[localization of a ring|localization]] &lt;math&gt;R_P.&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Matsumura" /&gt;

Let ''R'' be a [[local ring]] with nilpotent maximal ideal (e.g., an [[artinian local ring]]) and ''M'' a module over it. Then ''M'' flat implies ''M'' free.&lt;ref name="Matsumura" /&gt;

The '''[[local criterion for flatness]]''' states:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenbud|1994|loc=Theorem 6.8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Let ''R'' be a local noetherian ring, ''S'' a local noetherian ''R''-algebra with &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}_R S \subset \mathfrak{m}_S&lt;/math&gt;, and ''M'' a finitely generated ''S''-module. Then ''M'' is flat over ''R'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Tor}_1^R(M, R/\mathfrak{m}_R) = 0.&lt;/math&gt;
The significance of this is that ''S'' need not be finite over ''R'' and we only need to consider the maximal ideal of ''R'' instead of an arbitrary ideal of ''R''.

The next criterion is also useful for testing flatness:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Eisenbud|1994|loc=Theorem 18.16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Let ''R'', ''S'' be as in the local criterion for flatness. Assume ''S'' is [[Cohen–Macaulay ring|Cohen–Macaulay]] and ''R'' is [[regular local ring|regular]]. Then ''S'' is flat over ''R'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;\dim S = \dim R + \dim S/\mathfrak{m}_R S.&lt;/math&gt;

Flat modules over commutative rings are always [[torsion-free module|torsion-free]] (that is, the multiplication by any [[regular element (ring theory)|regular element]] of the ring in injective in the module). [[Projective module]]s (and thus [[free module]]s) are always flat. For certain common classes of rings, these statements can be reversed (for example, every torsion-free module over a [[Dedekind ring]] is automatically flat and flat modules over [[perfect ring]]s are always projective), as is subsumed in the following diagram of module properties:

[[Image:Module properties in commutative algebra.svg|Module properties in commutative algebra]]

An integral domain is called a [[Prüfer domain]] if every torsion-free module over it is flat.

== Faithfully flat ring homomorphism ==
Let ''A'' be a commutative ring and ''B'' a [[associative algebra|commutative ''A''-algebra]], i.e., a ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f : A \to B&lt;/math&gt;. Then ''B'' has the structure of an ''A''-module. Then ''B'' is said to be flat over ''A'' (resp. faithfully flat) if it is flat (resp. faithfully flat) as an ''A''-module. 

There is a basic characterization of a faithfully flat ring homomorphism: given a flat ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f: A \to B&lt;/math&gt;, the following are equivalent.
# &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is faithfully flat.
# For each maximal ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{m}B \ne B&lt;/math&gt;.
# If &lt;math&gt;N \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; is a nonzero &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-module, then &lt;math&gt;N \otimes_A B \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;.
# Every prime ideal of ''B'' is the inverse image under ''f'' of a prime ideal in ''A''. In other words, the induced map &lt;math&gt;f^* \colon \operatorname{Spec}(B) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is surjective.
# ''A'' is a [[pure subring]] of ''B'' (in particular, a subring); here, "pure subring" means that &lt;math&gt;N \to N \otimes_A B&lt;/math&gt; is injective for every &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-module &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Proof: Suppose &lt;math&gt;f: A \to B&lt;/math&gt; is faithfully flat. For an ''A''-module ''N'', the map &lt;math&gt;B = A \otimes_A B \to B \otimes_A B&lt;/math&gt; exhibits ''B'' as a pure subring and so &lt;math&gt;N \otimes_A B \to N \otimes_A (B \otimes B) \simeq (N \otimes_A B) \otimes_A B&lt;/math&gt; is injective. Hence, &lt;math&gt;N \to N \otimes_A B&lt;/math&gt; is injective. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;N \ne 0&lt;/math&gt; is a module over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;0 \ne N \subset N \otimes_B A&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The condition 2. implies that a flat local homomorphism between local rings is faithfully flat. It follows from the condition 5. that &lt;math&gt;I = I B \cap A&lt;/math&gt; for every ideal &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (take &lt;math&gt;N = A/I&lt;/math&gt;); in particular, if &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; is a Noetherian ring, then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a Noetherian ring.

The condition 4. can be stated in the following strengthened form: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(B) \to \operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is [[submersion (topology)|submersive]]: the topology of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[quotient topology]] of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec}(B)&lt;/math&gt; (this is a special case of the fact that a faithfully flat quasi-compact morphism of schemes has this property.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|SGA 1|loc=Exposé VIII., Corollay 4.3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) It compares to an [[integral element#Integral extensions|integral extension]] of an integrally closed domain.

'''Example''': For a ring &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;A \to A[x]&lt;/math&gt; is faithfully flat. More generally, an &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-algebra that is free as an &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-module is faithfully flat.

See also [[flat morphism#Properties of flat morphisms]].

To a given ring homomorphism &lt;math&gt;f: A \to B&lt;/math&gt;, there is an associated complex called the [[Amitsur complex]]:&lt;ref&gt;https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Amitsur+complex&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to A \overset{f}\to B \overset{d^1}\to B \otimes_A B \overset{d^2}\to B \otimes_A B \otimes_A B \to \cdots&lt;/math&gt;
where the coboundary operators &lt;math&gt;d^n&lt;/math&gt; are the alternating sums of the maps obtained by inserting 1 in each spot; e.g., &lt;math&gt;d^1(b) = b \otimes 1 - 1 \otimes b.&lt;/math&gt; Then (Grothendieck) this complex is exact if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is faithfully flat.

==Categorical colimits==

In general, arbitrary [[direct sum of modules|direct sum]]s and [[direct limit]]s of flat modules are flat, a consequence of the fact that the tensor product commutes with direct sums and direct limits (in fact with all [[colimits]]), and that both direct sums and direct limits are [[exact functor]]s. [[Submodule]]s and [[factor module]]s of flat modules need not be flat in general (e.g. Z/nZ is not a flat Z-module for n&gt;1). However we have the following result: the homomorphic image of a flat module ''M'' is flat if and only if the kernel is a [[pure submodule]] of ''M''.

[[Daniel Lazard]] proved in 1969 that a module ''M'' is flat if and only if it is a [[direct limit]] of [[finitely generated module|finitely-generated]] [[free module]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=D.|last=Lazard |title=Autour de la platitude| journal=Bulletin de la Société Mathématique de France| year=1969| volume=97| pages=81–128| url=http://www.numdam.org/item?id=BSMF_1969__97__81_0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, one can deduce that every [[finitely-presented module|finitely-presented]] flat module is projective.

An abelian group is flat (viewed as a Z-module) if and only if it is torsion-free.

==Homological algebra==

Flatness may also be expressed using the [[Tor functor]]s, the [[derived functor|left derived functors]] of the tensor product. A left ''R''-module ''M'' is flat if and only if Tor&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''R''&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;ndash;, ''M'') = 0 for all &lt;math&gt;n \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., if and only if Tor&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''R''&lt;/sup&gt;(''X'', ''M'') = 0 for all &lt;math&gt;n \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and all right ''R''-modules ''X''). Similarly, a right ''R''-module ''M'' is flat if and only if Tor&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''R''&lt;/sup&gt;(''M'', ''X'') = 0 for all &lt;math&gt;n \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and all left ''R''-modules ''X''. Using the Tor functor's [[long exact sequence]]s, one can then easily prove facts about a [[short exact sequence]]
:&lt;math&gt;0\; \rightarrow \;A \;\overset{f}{\longrightarrow} \;B \;\overset{g}{\longrightarrow} \;C \;\rightarrow\; 0&lt;/math&gt;
* If ''A'' and ''C'' are flat, then so is ''B''
* If ''B'' and ''C'' are flat, then so is ''A''
If ''A'' and ''B'' are flat, ''C'' need not be flat in general. However, it can be shown that
* If ''A'' is [[pure submodule|pure]] in ''B'' and ''B'' is flat, then ''A'' and ''C'' are flat.

==Flat resolutions==
A '''flat resolution''' of a module ''M'' is a [[resolution of a module|resolution]] of the form
: ...  → ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; → ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; → ''M'' → 0
where the ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are all flat modules. Any free or projective resolution is necessarily a flat resolution. Flat resolutions can be used to compute the [[Tor functor]].

The ''length'' of a finite flat resolution is the first subscript ''n'' such that ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is nonzero and ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 for ''i'' greater than ''n''. If a module ''M'' admits a finite flat resolution, the minimal length among all finite flat resolutions of ''M'' is called its [[flat dimension]]{{sfn|Lam|1999|loc=p. 183}} and denoted fd(''M''). If ''M'' does not admit a finite flat resolution, then by convention the flat dimension is said to be infinite. As an example, consider a module ''M'' such that fd(''M'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0. In this situation, the exactness of the sequence 0 → ''F''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;  → ''M'' → 0 indicates that the arrow in the center is an isomorphism, and hence ''M'' itself is flat.&lt;ref&gt;A module isomorphic to an flat module is of course flat.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas of module theory, a flat resolution must satisfy the additional requirement that each map is a flat pre-cover of the kernel of the map to the right.  For projective resolutions, this condition is almost invisible: a projective pre-cover is simply an [[epimorphism]] from a projective module.  These ideas are inspired from Auslander's work in approximations.  These ideas are also familiar from the more common notion of minimal projective resolutions, where each map is required to be a [[projective cover]] of the kernel of the map to the right.  However, projective covers need not exist in general, so minimal projective resolutions are only of limited use over rings like the integers.

==Flat covers==

While projective covers for modules do not always exist, it was speculated that for general rings, every module would have a flat cover, that is, every module ''M'' would be the epimorphic image of a flat module ''F'' such that every map from a flat module onto ''M'' factors through ''F'', and any endomorphism of ''F'' over ''M'' is an automoprhism. This '''flat cover conjecture''' was explicitly first stated in {{harv|Enochs|1981|loc=p 196}}. The conjecture turned out to be true, resolved positively and proved simultaneously by L. Bican, R. El Bashir and E. Enochs.{{sfn|Bican|El Bashir|Enochs|2001}} This was preceded by important contributions by P. Eklof, J. Trlifaj and J. Xu.

Since flat covers exist for all modules over all rings, minimal flat resolutions can take the  place of minimal projective resolutions in many circumstances.  The measurement of the departure of flat resolutions from projective resolutions is called ''relative homological algebra'', and is covered in classics such as {{harv|MacLane|1963}} and in more recent works focussing on flat resolutions such as {{harv|Enochs|Jenda|2000}}.

== In constructive mathematics ==

Flat modules have increased importance in [[constructive mathematics]], where projective modules are less useful. For example, that all free modules are projective is equivalent to the full [[axiom of choice]], so theorems about projective modules, even if proved constructively, do not necessarily apply to free modules. In contrast, no choice is needed to prove that free modules are flat, so theorems about flat modules can still apply.{{sfn|Richman|1997}}

'''GXL''' ('''Graph eXchange Language''') is designed to be a standard exchange format for [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphs]]. GXL is an extensible markup language ([[XML]]) sublanguage and the syntax is given by an XML document type definition (DTD). This exchange format offers an adaptable and flexible means to support interoperability between graph-based tools.

== Overview ==
In particular, GXL was developed to enable interoperability between [[Reengineering (software)|software reengineering]] tools and components, such as code extractors (parsers), analyzers and visualizers. GXL allows software reengineers to combine single-purpose tools especially for parsing, source code extraction, architecture recovery, data flow analysis, pointer analysis, program slicing, query techniques, source code visualization, object recovery, restructuring, refactoring, remodularization, etc., into a single powerful reengineering workbench.

There are two innovative features in GXL that make it well-suited to an exchange format for software data.
# The conceptual data model is a typed, attributed, directed graph. This is not to say that all software data ought to be manipulated as graphs, but rather that they can be exchanged as graphs.
# It can be used to represent instance data as well as schemas for describing the structure of the data.  Moreover, the schema can be explicitly stated along with instance data.  The structure of graphs exchanged by GXL streams is given by a schema represented as a [[Unified Modeling Language]] (UML) class diagram.

Since GXL is a general graph exchange format, it can also be used to interchange any graph-based data, including models between [[computer-aided software engineering]] (CASE) tools, data between [[Graph rewriting|graph transformation systems]], or graph visualization tools. GXL includes support for [[hypergraph]]s and hierarchical graphs, and can be extended to support other types of graphs.

GXL originated in the merger of  GRAph eXchange format (GraX: University of Koblenz, DE) for exchanging typed, attributed, ordered, directed graphs (TGraphs), Tuple Attribute Language (TA: University of Waterloo, CA), and the graph format of the PROGRES graph rewriting system (University Bw München, DE). Furthermore, GXL includes ideas from exchange formats from reverse engineering, including Relation Partition Algebra (RPA: Philips Research Eindhoven, NL) and Rigi Standard Format (RSF: University of Victoria, CA). The development of GXL was also influenced by various formats used in graph drawing (e.g. daVinci, [[Graph Modelling Language]] (GML), Graphlet, GraphXML) and current discussions on exchange formats for graph transformation systems.

== Presentations of former GXL versions ==
At the 2000 [[International Conference on Software Engineering]] (ICSE 2000) Workshop on Standard Exchange Formats (WoSEF), GXL was accepted as working draft for an exchange format by numerous research groups working in the domain of software reengineering and graph transformation.

During the APPLIGRAPH Subgroup Meeting on Exchange Formats for Graph Transformation, an overview of GXL was given [Schürr, 2000] and participants decided to use GXL to represent graphs within their exchange format for graph transformation systems (GTXL).

The 2000 [[IBM]] Centers for Advanced Studies Conference ([[IBM CASCON|CASCON]] 2000) included two half-day workshops on GXL. In the morning, 'Software Data Interchange with GXL: Introduction and Tutorial' gave a primer on the syntax and concepts in the format, while the afternoon workshop, 'Software Data Interchange with GXL: Implementation Issues' discussed the development of converters and standard schemas.

At the Seventh Working Conference on Reverse Engineering (WCRE 2000), GXL was presented in a tutorial [Holt ''et al.'', 2000] and during the workshop on exchange formats [Holt/Winter, 2000]. Central results were a simpler representation of ordering information, the usage of UML class diagrams to present graph schemata and the representation of UML class diagrams by GXL graphs.

The Dagstuhl Seminar on Interoperability of Reengineering Tools ratified GXL 1.0 as a standard interchange format for exchanging reengineering related data. Numerous groups from industry and research committed to using GXL, to import and export GXL documents to their tools, and to write various GXL tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4243">In [[mathematics]], the '''Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality''' is a result in the theory of [[Sobolev spaces]] that estimates the [[weak derivative]]s of a function.  The estimates are in terms of [[Lp space|''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt; norms]] of the function and its derivatives, and the inequality “interpolates” among various values of ''p'' and orders of differentiation, hence the name.  The result is of particular importance in the theory of [[elliptic partial differential equation]]s. It was proposed by [[Louis Nirenberg]] and Emilio Gagliardo.

==Statement of the inequality==

The inequality concerns functions ''u'':&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''.  Fix 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;''q'', ''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;le;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin; and a [[natural number]] ''m''.  Suppose also that a real number ''&amp;alpha;'' and a natural number ''j'' are such that
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{p} = \frac{j}{n} + \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{m}{n} \right) \alpha + \frac{1 - \alpha}{q}
&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{j}{m} \leq \alpha \leq 1.
&lt;/math&gt;
Then 
# every function ''u'':&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R''' that lies in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) with ''m''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;) also has ''j''&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; derivative in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;);
# and, furthermore, there exists a constant ''C'' depending only on ''m'', ''n'', ''j'', ''q'', ''r'' and ''&amp;alpha;'' such that
::&lt;math&gt;
\| \mathrm{D}^{j} u \|_{L^{p}} \leq C \| \mathrm{D}^{m} u \|_{L^{r}}^{\alpha} \| u \|_{L^{q}}^{1 - \alpha}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The result has two exceptional cases:
# If ''j''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''mr''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''n'' and ''q''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin;, then it is necessary to make the additional assumption that either ''u'' tends to zero at infinity or that ''u'' lies in ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''s''&lt;/sup&gt; for some finite ''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0.
# If 1&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''r''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;infin; and ''m''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''j''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''n''/''r'' is a non-negative integer, then it is necessary to assume also that ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;&amp;ne;&amp;nbsp;1.

For functions ''u'':&amp;nbsp;&amp;Omega;&amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp;'''R''' defined on a [[bounded set|bounded]] [[Lipschitz domain]] &amp;Omega;&amp;nbsp;&amp;sube;&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the interpolation inequality has the same hypotheses as above and reads

:&lt;math&gt;
\| \mathrm{D}^{j} u \|_{L^{p}} \leq C_{1} \| \mathrm{D}^{m} u \|_{L^{r}}^{\alpha} \| u \|_{L^{q}}^{1 - \alpha} + C_{2} \| u \|_{L^{s}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''s''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 is arbitrary;  naturally, the constants ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; depend upon the domain &amp;Omega; as well as ''m'', ''n'' etc.

==Consequences==

* When ''&amp;alpha;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;''q''&lt;/sup&gt; norm of ''u'' vanishes from the inequality, and the Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality then implies the [[Sobolev embedding theorem]].  (Note, in particular, that ''r'' is permitted to be 1.)
* Another special case of the Gagliardo–Nirenberg interpolation inequality is [[Ladyzhenskaya's inequality]], in which ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, ''j''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 or 3, ''q'' and ''r'' are both 2, and ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4.

'''Garrett Birkhoff''' (January 19, 1911 – November 22, 1996) was an [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]]. He is best known for his work in [[lattice theory]].

The mathematician [[George Birkhoff]] (1884&amp;ndash;1944) was his father.

==Life==
The son of the mathematician [[George David Birkhoff]], Garrett was born in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [https://library.ias.edu/files/pdfs/hs/cos.pdf#page=90 ''A COMMUNITY OF SCHOLARS: The Institute for Advanced Study Faculty and Members 1930-1980''], p. 90. [[Institute for Advanced Study]], 1980. Accessed November 20, 2015. "Birkhoff, Garrett 40s M Born 1911 Princeton, NJ."&lt;/ref&gt; He began the [[Harvard University]] BA course in 1928 after less than seven years of prior formal education. Upon completing his Harvard BA in 1932, he went to [[Cambridge University]] in England to study [[mathematical physics]] but switched to studying [[abstract algebra]] under [[Philip Hall]]. While visiting the [[University of Munich]], he met [[Constantin Carathéodory|Carathéodory]] who pointed him towards two important texts, [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|Van der Waerden]] on [[abstract algebra]] and [[Andreas Speiser|Speiser]] on [[group theory]].

Birkhoff held no Ph.D., a qualification British higher education did not emphasize at that time, and did not even bother obtaining an M.A. Nevertheless, after being a member of Harvard's [[Society of Fellows]], 1933&amp;ndash;36, he spent the rest of his career teaching at Harvard. From these facts can be inferred the number and quality of Birkhoff's papers published by his 25th year.

During the 1930s, Birkhoff, along with his Harvard colleagues [[Marshall Stone]] and [[Saunders Mac Lane]], substantially advanced American teaching and research in [[abstract algebra]]. In 1941 he and Mac Lane published ''A Survey of Modern Algebra'', the second undergraduate textbook in English on the subject ([[Cyrus Colton MacDuffee]]'s ''An Introduction to Abstract Algebra'' was published in 1940). Mac Lane and Birkhoff's ''Algebra'' (1967) is a more advanced text on [[abstract algebra]]. A number of papers he wrote in the 1930s, culminating in his monograph, ''Lattice Theory'' (1940; the third edition remains in print), turned [[lattice theory]] into a major branch of [[abstract algebra]]. His 1935 paper, "On the Structure of Abstract Algebras" founded a new branch of mathematics, [[universal algebra]]. Birkhoff's approach to this development of universal algebra and lattice theory acknowledged prior ideas of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Ernst Schröder]], and [[Alfred North Whitehead]]; in fact, Whitehead had written an 1898 monograph entitled ''Universal Algebra''. Further, in 1935, Birkoff showed that any equivalence between expressions that holds for all possible forms of operator must have a finite proof using certain underlying rules about equality. However, as soon as one introduces actual axioms that constrain the operators this is no longer true—and in general it can be undecidable whether or not a particular equivalence holds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1172|isbn=1-57955-008-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after [[World War II]], Birkhoff's interests gravitated towards what he called "engineering" mathematics. During the war, he worked on radar aiming and ballistics, including the [[bazooka]]. In the development of weapons, mathematical questions arose, some of which had not yet been addressed by the literature on fluid dynamics. Birkhoff's research was presented in his texts on fluid dynamics, ''Hydrodynamics'' (1950) and ''Jets, Wakes and Cavities'' (1957).

Birkhoff, a friend of [[John von Neumann]], took a close interest in the rise of the electronic computer. Birkhoff supervised the Ph.D. thesis of [[David M. Young, Jr.|David M. Young]] on the numerical solution of [[Poisson's equation|the partial differential equation of Poisson]], in which Young proposed the [[successive over-relaxation]] (SOR) method. Birkhoff then worked with [[Richard S. Varga]], a former student, who was employed at [[Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory]] of the [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electronic Corporation]] in Pittsburgh and was helping to design nuclear reactors. Extending the results of Young, the Birkhoff-Varga collaboration led to many publications on [[positive operator]]s and [[iterative method]]s for ''p''-cyclic matrices.

Birkhoff's research and consulting work (notably for [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]]) developed computational methods besides numerical linear algebra, notably the representation of smooth curves via [[cubic spline]]s.

Birkhoff published more than 200 papers and supervised more than 50 Ph.D.s. He was a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]] for the academic year 1948–1949 and the [[Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics#Presidents|president of the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics]] for 1966–1968. He won a [[Lester R. Ford Award]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Birkhoff, Garrett|title=Current trends in algebra|journal=Amer. Math.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1617">In [[probability theory]] and [[statistical mechanics]], a '''Gibbs state''' is an equilibrium probability distribution which remains invariant under future evolution of the system.  For example, a stationary or steady-state distribution of a [[Markov chain]], such as that achieved by running a [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] iteration for a sufficiently long time, is a Gibbs state.

Precisely, suppose &lt;math&gt;L &lt;/math&gt; is a generator of evolutions for an initial state &lt;math&gt;\rho_0 &lt;/math&gt;, so that the state at any later time is given by &lt;math&gt;\rho(t) = e^{L t} [\rho_0] &lt;/math&gt;.  Then the condition for &lt;math&gt;\rho_{\infty} &lt;/math&gt; to be a Gibbs state is

:&lt;math&gt;L [\rho_{\infty}] = 0 &lt;/math&gt; .

In [[physics]] there may be several physically distinct Gibbs states in which a system may be trapped, particularly at lower temperatures. 

They are named after [[Josiah Willard Gibbs]], for his work in determining equilibrium properties of [[statistical ensemble]]s. Gibbs himself referred to this type of statistical ensemble as being in "statistical equilibrium".&lt;ref name="gibbs"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gibbs |first=Josiah Willard |authorlink=Josiah Willard Gibbs |title=[[Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics|Elementary Principles in Statistical Mechanics, developed with especial reference to the rational foundation of thermodynamics]] |year=1902 |publisher=[[Charles Scribner's Sons]] |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}

==A==
* '''Abstract''' - An indicator applied to a [[Classifier (UML)|classifier]] (e.g., [[Actor (UML)|actor]], [[Class (computer science)|class]], [[use case]]) or to some features of a classifier (e.g., a class's operations) showing that the feature is incomplete and is intended not to be instantiated, but to be specialized by other definitions.
* '''[[Abstraction (computer science)|Abstract class]]''' - A class that does not provide a complete declaration, perhaps because it has no implementation method identified for an operation. By declaring a class as ''abstract'', one intends to prohibit direct instantiation of the class. An abstract class cannot directly instantiate [[Object (computer science)|object]]s; it must be inherited from before it can be used.
*[[Abstract data type]]
* '''Abstract operation''' - Unlike attributes, class operations can be abstract, meaning that there is no provided implementation. Generally, a class containing an abstract operation should be marked as an abstract class.  An Operation must have a method supplied in some specialized Class before it can be used.
* '''Abstraction''' is the process of picking out common features and deriving essential characteristics from [[Object (computer science)|object]]s and [[Subroutine|procedure]] [[entity class|entities]] that distinguish it from other kinds of entities. 
* '''Action''' - An action is the fundamental unit of behaviour specification and represents some transformation or processing in the modeled system, such as invoking a method of a class or a sub activity
* '''Action sequence''' - 
* '''Action state''' - 
* '''Action steps''' - 
* '''Activation''' - the time during which an object has a method executing. It is often indicated by a thin box or bar superimposed on the Object's lifeline in a Sequence Diagram
* '''[[Activity diagram]]''' - a diagram that describes procedural logic, business process or work flow. An activity diagram contains a number of Activities and connected by Control Flows and Object Flows.
* '''Active class''' - a [[Class (computer science)|class]] defining active objects
* '''Active object''' - an [[Object (computer science)|object]] running under its own [[Thread (computer science)|thread]]
* '''Activity''' - carrying out behaviour in a [[State diagram|State machine diagram]]
** '''Do''' - a type of Activity which may be interrupted, as opposed to normal Activities which may not be interrupted
** '''Internal''' - an Activity that is executed within a State
*** '''Entry''' - an Activity that is executed when a State is entered
*** '''Exit''' - an Activity that is executed when a State is exited
* '''Activity final''' - the end point of an [[activity diagram]]. When a thread reaches an Activity Final node, all the threads of the activity terminate. (Contrast with Flow Final node, which marks the end of one thread.)
* '''[[Actor (UML)|Actor]]''' - a [[role]] that a [[User (computing)|user]] takes when invoking a [[use case]]. Also see [[actor modeling]].
* '''[[Object composition#Aggregation|Aggregation]]''' - 1. a special type of association used to represent a stronger relationship between two classes than a regular association; typically read as "owns a", as in, "Class A owns a Class B".  A [[hierarchy]] of [[Class (computer science)|class]]es where the child [[Object (computer science)|object]] may or may not continue to exist if the parent object is destroyed; see 'composition'. 2. An aggregation is a structural relationship that specifies that one class represents a large thing which constitute of smaller things and represents "has-a" relationship.
* '''Artifact''' - items that model physical pieces of information in your system, such as a user's manual, training material, or password file
* '''[[Association (object-oriented programming)|Association]]''' - 1. a relationship with 2 or more ends, where each end is on a class (or other classifier). Each end is called a Role, and may have a role name, Multiplicity, and may be Navigable. 2. An association is a structural relationship that specifies that the objects of one thing are connected with the objects of another.
* '''Association class''' - a [[Class (computer science)|class]] that describes an association.
* '''Asynchronous''' - The sender of an asynchronous message does not wait for a response.
* '''[[attribute (computing)|Attribute]]''' - a significant piece of data owned by a Class, often containing values describing each instance of the class. Besides the attribute name and a slot for the attribute value, an attribute may have specified Visibility, Type, Multiplicity, Default value, and Property-string.

{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}

==B==

* '''Block''' - Block is a place where all the aggregates are collected at one place 
* '''BPM''' - Business Process Model, is used to define the process followed by the business. It is a high level design for the business process.
* '''BPMN''' - Business Process Modelling Notations, are used to define the process on paper with the help of predefined shapes of UML. 
{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}

==C==

* '''Call''' - 
* '''Cardinality''' - the current number of occurrences of a Property. The cardinality must be a value that is allowed by the multiplicity
* '''Child''' - 
* '''[[Class (computer science)|Class]]''' - the primary declarative construct of [[Object-Oriented Programming]]; a cohesive unit of Attributes and Operations; a compile-time template for an Object
* '''[[Class diagram]]''' - a type of static structure diagram that describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes and the relationships between the classes.
* '''[[classifier (UML)|Classifier]]''' - a category of UML elements that have some common features, such as attributes or methods.
* '''Client''' - 
* '''Collaboration ''' - A collaboration is a society of classes,interfaces and other elements that work together to provide some cooperative behavior that is bigger than the sum of its parts. 
* '''[[Communication diagram]]''' 
* '''Component''' - A component represents a software module (source code, binary code, executable, DLL, etc.) with a well-defined interface. The interface of a component is represented by one or several interface elements that the component provides. Components are used to show compiler and run-time dependencies, as well as interface and calling dependencies among software modules. They also show which components implement a specific class.
* '''[[Component diagram]]''' 
* '''[[Composite structure diagram]]''' 
* '''[[Object composition|Composition]]''' - a specific type of relationship describing how one Object is ''composed of'' another Object; a form of [[Object composition#Aggregation|Aggregation]] where the child [[Object (computer science)|object]] is destroyed if the parent object is destroyed.
* '''Condition''' - 
* '''Connection''' - 
* '''Constraint''' - natural language, programming language or Object Constraint Language boolean condition which may not be false if a Class is to be considered valid
* '''Containment''' - containment by value and containment by reference. Containment by value implies that an object contains another object; containment by reference implies that an object contains a pointer to another object.

{{compact ToC|side=yes|top=yes|num=yes}}

==D==
* '''Decision''' - a point in an [[Activity diagram]] where a Flow splits into several, mutually exclusive, Guarded flows. A Merge marks the end of the optional behaviour started by the Decision
* '''[[Dependency (UML)|Dependency]]''' - a dependency exists between two defined elements if a change to the definition of one would result in a change to the other. In UML this is indicated by a line pointing from the dependent to the independent element.
* '''[[Deployment diagram]]''' 
* '''Derived property''' - a property that can be calculated or inferred from other properties
* '''Diagram''' - a visual representation of a subset of features of a UML Model
* '''Directed relationship''' - 
* '''Domain''' - a logical grouping that explicitly declares a rule which defines ownership of [[Object (computer science)|objects]] based upon some [[Data type|type]] or [[property]].

==E==
* '''Edge''' - a synonym for Flow
* '''Encapsulation''' -  a means to bind together code and the data it uses. It is the basis of object oriented programming.
* '''Entity''' - 
* '''[[Enumeration]]''' - a set of constant values for a new data type
* '''Event''' - when it occurs on an Object it may cause a Transition in a [[State diagram|State machine diagram]]
* '''Expansion region''' - a set of Actions  in an [[Activity diagram]] that occur once for each of a collection of input Tokens to the Expansion Region
* '''Extend''' - a means to use a class as a starting point for creation of a new class. The new class inherits all of the attributes, properties, and methods of the class it extends. 
* '''Exception''' -

==F==
* '''File''' - 
* '''Final state''' - the [[State (computer science)|state]] at which an [[Object (computer science)|object]] ceases to exist
* '''Flow''' - a navigational connection between two Actions
* '''Flow Final''' - the point at which a Flow ends without ending the complete Activity
* '''Fork''' - a point in an [[Activity diagram]] where a Flow of logic splits into several concurrent Flows (Threads)
* '''Found Message''' - starting point for a [[Sequence diagram]]

* '''[[Generalization]]''' - a relationship between a ''specific classifier'' (typically a [[Class (computer science)|class]]) to a more ''general classifier'' asserting that the ''general classifer'' contains common features among both the ''specific classifier'' and the ''general classifier''.  Features include, for example, properties, and constraints. The use of generalization is often logically restricted to cases where the specific classifier is a "kind-of" or "sort-of" the general classifier: for example, a Boxer is a "kind-of" Dog.  When the classifiers involved are [[software engineering]] classes, generalization usually involves reusing code; it is often implemented using [[Inheritance (computer science)|inheritance]], where the more specific code reuses the more general code.
* '''Generalization Tree''' - Several specialized classifiers may point to the same general classifier, forming a generalization tree, where the general classifer contains common features shared by all the specialized versions. As generalization is a relationship, it is possible for a classifer to participate in several generalizations, often being on the specific end or on the general end, forming a [[directed acyclic graph]] (DAG) (i.e., no loops). 
* '''Generic''' - 
* '''Guard''' - a [[Boolean logic|boolean]] test that must be satisfied for a Flow of an [[activity diagram]] or a Transition of a [[State diagram|state machine diagram]] to be allowed to start

In UML 1.x, it was also possible to have a discrete list of values, but this was eliminated in UML 2.0.  2. It specifies how many objects may be connected across an instance of an association which is written as a range of values(like 1..*).
** '''Mandatory''' - A required multiplicity, the lower bound is at least one, usually 1..1 or 1 
** '''Optional'''  - The lower bound is at most zero, usually, 0..1
** '''Many'''      - A multiplicity with no upper limit, either 0..* or *

'''Harcourt's theorem''' is a formula in [[geometry]] for the [[area]] of a [[triangle]], as a function of its side lengths and the perpendicular distances of its vertices from an arbitrary line tangent to its [[incircle]].&lt;ref name=DS&gt;{{citation

The theorem is named after J. Harcourt, an Irish professor.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Exercises de géométrie: comprenant l'exposé des méthodes géométriques et 2000 questions résolues|series=Cours de mathématiques elementaires|first=F.|last=G.-M.|edition=5th|publisher=Maison A.

==Statement==
Let a [[triangle]] be given with [[vertex (geometry)|vertices]] ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'', opposite sides of lengths ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', area ''K'', and a line that is [[tangent]] to the triangle's [[incircle]] at any point on that circle. Denote the signed perpendicular distances of the vertices from the line as ''a'' ', ''b'' ', and ''c'' ', with a distance being negative if and only if the vertex is on the opposite side of the line from the incenter. Then

:&lt;math&gt;a a ^\prime + b b^\prime + c c^\prime = 2K.&lt;/math&gt;

==Degenerate case==
If the tangent line contains one of the sides of the triangle, then two of the distances are zero and the formula collapses to the familiar formula that twice the area of a triangle is a base (the coinciding triangle side) times the altitude from that base.

==Extension==

If the line is instead tangent to the [[excircle]] opposite, say, vertex ''A'' of the triangle, then&lt;ref name=DS/&gt;{{rp|Thm.3}}

:&lt;math&gt;-a a ^\prime + b b^\prime + c c^\prime = 2K.&lt;/math&gt;

==Dual property==

If rather than ''a', b', c' '' referring to distances from a vertex to an arbitrary incircle tangent line, they refer instead to distances from a sideline to an arbitrary point, then the equation

:&lt;math&gt;a a ^\prime + b b^\prime + c c^\prime = 2K.&lt;/math&gt;

remains true.&lt;ref name=WW&gt;Whitworth, William Allen. ''Trilinear Coordinates and Other Methods of Modern Analytical Geometry of Two Dimensions'', Forgotten Books, 2012 (orig.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13244">In [[real analysis]] the '''Heine–Borel theorem''', named after [[Eduard Heine]] and [[Émile Borel]], states:

For a [[subset]] ''S'' of [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, the following two statements are equivalent:
*''S'' is [[closed set|closed]] and [[bounded set|bounded]]
*''S'' is [[compact space|compact]], that is, every open [[cover (topology)|cover]] of ''S'' has a finite subcover.

==History and motivation==

The history of what today is called the Heine–Borel theorem starts in the 19th century, with the search for solid foundations of real analysis. Central to the theory was the concept of [[uniform continuity]] and the theorem stating that every [[continuous function]] on a closed interval is uniformly continuous. [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] was the first to prove this and implicitly he used the existence of a finite subcover of a given open cover of a closed interval in his proof.&lt;ref name="Sundström"/&gt; He used this proof in his 1852 lectures, which were published only in 1904.&lt;ref name="Sundström"&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[American Mathematical Monthly]] | title = A Pedagogical History of Compactness | last1 = Raman-Sundström | first1 = Manya | date = August–September 2015 | volume = 122 | issue = 7 | pages = 619–635 | jstor = 10.4169/amer.math.monthly.122.7.619| doi = 10.4169/amer.math.monthly.122.7.619 | url = https://arxiv.org/pdf/1006.4131.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Eduard Heine]], [[Karl Weierstrass]] and [[Salvatore Pincherle]] used similar techniques. [[Émile Borel]] in 1895 was the first to state and prove a form of what is now called the Heine–Borel theorem. His formulation was restricted to [[countable set|countable]] covers. [[Pierre Cousin]] (1895), [[Lebesgue]] (1898) and [[Arthur Schoenflies|Schoenflies]] (1900) generalized it to arbitrary covers.&lt;ref name="sundstrom_2010"&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Sundström |first=Manya Raman | eprint=1006.4131v1 |title=A pedagogical history of compactness |class=math.HO |year=2010 |version= | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Proof ==

'''If a set is compact, then it must be closed.'''

Let ''S'' be a subset of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Observe first the following: if ''a'' is a [[limit point]] of ''S'', then any finite collection ''C'' of open sets, such that each open set ''U'' ∈ ''C'' is disjoint from some [[Neighbourhood (mathematics)#Definition|neighborhood]] ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''a'', fails to be a cover of ''S''.  Indeed, the intersection of the finite family of sets ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; is a neighborhood ''W'' of ''a'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Since ''a'' is a limit point of ''S'', ''W'' must contain a point ''x'' in ''S''. This ''x'' ∈ ''S'' is not covered by the family ''C'', because every ''U'' in ''C'' is disjoint from ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''U''&lt;/sub&gt; and hence disjoint from ''W'', which contains ''x''.

If ''S'' is compact but not closed, then it has an accumulation point ''a'' not in ''S''.  Consider a collection {{nowrap|''C''&amp;thinsp;′}} consisting of an open neighborhood ''N''(''x'') for each ''x'' ∈ ''S'', chosen small enough to not intersect some neighborhood ''V''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''a''.  Then {{nowrap|''C''&amp;thinsp;′}} is an open cover of ''S'', but any finite subcollection of {{nowrap|''C''&amp;thinsp;′}} has the form of ''C'' discussed previously, and thus cannot be an open subcover of ''S''.  This contradicts the compactness of ''S''.  Hence, every accumulation point of ''S'' is in ''S'', so ''S'' is closed.

The proof above applies with almost no change to showing that any compact subset ''S'' of a [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]] topological space ''X'' is closed in ''X''.

'''If a set is compact, then it is bounded.'''

Let &lt;math&gt;U_x&lt;/math&gt; be a ball of radius 1 centered at x. Then the set of all such balls centered at &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is clearly an open cover of ''X'', since &lt;math&gt;\cup_{x\in X} U_x&lt;/math&gt; contains all of ''X''. Since ''X'' is compact, take a finite subcover of this cover. This subcover is the finite union of balls of radius 1, so its diameter is bounded (by 2 times the size of the finite subcover). Therefore, any set covered by this subcover must also be bounded.

'''A closed subset of a compact set is compact.'''

Let ''K'' be a closed subset of a compact set ''T'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; and let ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; be an open cover of ''K''.  Then {{nowrap|''U'' {{=}} '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; \ ''K''}} is an open set and
 
:&lt;math&gt; C_T = C_K \cup \{U\} &lt;/math&gt;

is an open cover of ''T''.  Since ''T'' is compact, then ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''T''&lt;/sub&gt; has a finite subcover &lt;math&gt; C_T',&lt;/math&gt; that also covers the smaller set ''K''.  Since ''U'' does not contain any point of ''K'', the set ''K'' is already covered by &lt;math&gt; C_K' = C_T' \setminus \{U\}, &lt;/math&gt; that is a finite subcollection of the original collection ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is thus possible to extract from any open cover ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''K''&lt;/sub&gt; of ''K'' a finite subcover.

'''If a set is closed and bounded, then it is compact.'''

If a set ''S'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is bounded, then it can be enclosed within an ''n''-box

: &lt;math&gt; T_0 = [-a, a]^n&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' &gt; 0.  By the property above, it is enough to show that ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is compact.

Assume, by way of contradiction, that ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is not compact.  Then there exists an infinite open cover ''C'' of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; that does not admit any finite subcover.  Through bisection of each of the sides of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the box ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; can be broken up into 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; sub ''n''-boxes, each of which has diameter equal to half the diameter of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.  Then at least one of the 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; sections of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; must require an infinite subcover of ''C'', otherwise ''C'' itself would have a finite subcover, by uniting together the finite covers of the sections.  Call this section ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

Likewise, the sides of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be bisected, yielding 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; sections of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, at least one of which must require an infinite subcover of ''C''.  Continuing in like manner yields a decreasing sequence of nested ''n''-boxes:

:&lt;math&gt; T_0 \supset T_1 \supset T_2 \supset \ldots \supset T_k \supset \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

where the side length of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is {{nowrap|(2&amp;thinsp;''a'')&amp;thinsp;/&amp;thinsp;2&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, which tends to 0 as ''k'' tends to infinity. Let us define a sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;) such that each ''x''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; is in ''T''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;. This sequence is Cauchy, so it must converge to some limit ''L''. Since each ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; is closed, and for each ''k'' the sequence  (''x''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;) is eventually always inside ''T''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;, we see that ''L''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''T''&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; for each ''k''.

Since ''C'' covers ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then it has some member ''U''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''C'' such that ''L''&amp;nbsp;∈ ''U''.  Since ''U'' is open, there is an ''n''-ball {{nowrap|''B''(''L'') ⊆ ''U''}}.  For large enough ''k'', one has {{nowrap|''T''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ ''B''(''L'') ⊆ ''U''}}, but then the infinite number of members of ''C'' needed to cover ''T&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be replaced by just one: ''U'', a contradiction.

Thus, ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is compact.  Since ''S'' is closed and a subset of the compact set ''T''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, then ''S'' is also compact (see above).

== Heine-Borel property ==
The Heine-Borel theorem does not hold as stated for general [[Metric space|metric]] and [[topological vector space]]s, and this gives rise to the necessity to consider special classes of spaces where this proposition is true. They are called the '''spaces with the Heine-Borel property'''.

===In the theory of metric spaces=== 
A [[metric space]] &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; is said to have the '''Heine-Borel property''' if each closed bounded&lt;ref&gt;A set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in a metric space &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''bounded'' if it is contained in a ball of a finite radius, i.e. there exists &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq\{x\in X: \ d(x,a)\le r\}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; set in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is compact. 

Many metric spaces fail to have the Heine–Borel property, for instance, the metric space of [[rational number]]s (or indeed any incomplete metric space). Complete metric spaces may also fail to have the property, for instance, no infinite-dimensional [[Banach space]]s have the Heine–Borel property (as metric spaces). Even more trivially, if the real line is not endowed with the usual metric, it may fail to have the Heine-Borel property.

A metric space &lt;math&gt;(X,d)&lt;/math&gt; has a Heine-Borel metric which is Cauchy locally identical to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; if and only if it is [[complete space|complete]], [[sigma-compact|&lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;-compact]], and [[locally compact space|locally compact]].{{sfn|Williamson|Janos|1987}}

===In the theory of topological vector spaces===
A [[topological vector space]] &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to have the '''Heine-Borel property'''{{sfn|Kirillov|Gvishiani|1982|loc=Theorem 28}} (R.E. Edwards uses the term ''boundedly compact space''{{sfn|Edwards|1965|loc=8.4.7}}) if each closed bounded&lt;ref&gt;A set &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in a topological vector space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''bounded'' if for each neighborhood of zero &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; there exists a scalar &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;B\subseteq\lambda\cdot U&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; set in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is compact.&lt;ref&gt;In the case when the topology of a topological vector space &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is generated by some metric &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; this definition is not equivalent to the definition of the Heine-Borel property of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as a metric space, since the notion of bounded set in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as a metric space is different from the notion of bounded set in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; as a topological vector space. For instance, the space &lt;math&gt;{\mathcal C}^\infty[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; of smooth functions on the interval &lt;math&gt;[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with the metric &lt;math&gt;d(x,y)=\sum_{k=0}^\infty\frac{1}{2^k}\cdot\frac{\max_{t\in[0,1]}|x^{(k)}(t)-y^{(k)}(t)|}{1+\max_{t\in[0,1]}|x^{(k)}(t)-y^{(k)}(t)|}&lt;/math&gt; (here &lt;math&gt;x^{(k)}&lt;/math&gt; is the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-th derivative of the function &lt;math&gt;x\in {\mathcal C}^\infty[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;) has the Heine-Borel property as a topological vector space but not as a metric space.&lt;/ref&gt; No infinite-dimensional [[Banach space]]s have the Heine-Borel property (as topological vector spaces). But some infinite-dimensional [[Fréchet space]]s do have, for instance, the space &lt;math&gt;C^\infty(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; of smooth functions on an open set &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Edwards|1965|loc=8.4.7}} and the space &lt;math&gt;H(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; of holomorphic functions on an open set &lt;math&gt;\Omega\subset\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;{{sfn|Edwards|1965|loc=8.4.7}}.  More generally, any quasi-complete [[nuclear space]] has the Heine–Borel property. All [[Montel space]]s have the Heine-Borel property as well.

'''ISO/IEC 10967''', '''Language independent arithmetic''' ('''LIA'''), is a series of
standards on computer arithmetic. It is compatible with [[ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011]],
more known as [[IEEE 754-2008]], and much of the
specifications are for IEEE 754 special values
(though such values are not required by LIA itself, unless the parameter ''iec&lt;sub&gt;559&lt;/sub&gt;'' is '''true''').
It was developed by the working group [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22]]/WG11, which was disbanded in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=JTC1/SC22/WG11 – Binding Techniques|url=http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG11/ |work=Home page |publisher=ISO/IEC |accessdate=7 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LIA currently consists of three parts:
* Part 1: ''Integer and floating point arithmetic'', second edition published 2012.
* Part 2: ''Elementary numerical functions'', first edition published 2001.
* Part 3: ''Complex integer and floating point arithmetic and complex elementary numerical functions'', first edition published 2006.

==Parts==

===Part 1===
Part 1 deals with the basic [[Integer (computer science)|integer]] and [[floating point]] datatypes (for multiple radices, including 2 and 10),
but unlike [[IEEE 754-2008]] not the representation of the values. Part 1 also
deals with basic arithmetic, including comparisons, on values of such
datatypes. The parameter ''iec&lt;sub&gt;559&lt;/sub&gt;'' is expected to be
'''true''' for most implementations of LIA-1.

Part 1 was revised, to the second edition, to become more in line with the specifications
in parts 2 and 3.

===Part 2===
Part 2 deals with some additional "basic" operations on integer and floating point
datatype values, but focuses primarily on specifying requirements on numerical
versions of [[elementary functions]]. Much of the specifications in LIA-2 are inspired
by the specifications in [[Ada programming language|Ada]] for elementary functions.

===Part 3===
Part 3 generalizes parts 1 and 2 to deal with [[imaginary number|imaginary]] and [[complex number|complex]]
[[complex data type|datatypes]] and arithmetic and elementary functions on such values.
Much of the specifications in LIA-3 are inspired by the specifications
for imaginary and complex datatypes and operations in
[[C mathematical functions#Complex numbers|C]], [[Ada programming language|Ada]] and
[[Common Lisp]].

==Bindings==
Each of the parts provide suggested bindings for a number of
programming languages. These are not part of the LIA standards,
just suggestions, and are not complete. Authors of a programming
language standard may wish to alter the suggestions before any
incorporation in the programming language standard.

Currently (2013) the standards for [[C (programming language)|C]],
[[C++]], and [[Modula-2]] have partial bindings to LIA-1.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8408">In [[combinatorial game theory]], and particularly in the theory of [[impartial game]]s in [[misère]] play, an '''indistinguishability quotient''' is a [[commutative monoid]]
that generalizes and localizes the [[Sprague–Grundy theorem]] for a specific game's rule set.

In the specific case of misere-play impartial games, such commutative monoids have become known as '''misere quotients'''.

== Example: Misere Nim variant==
Suppose the game of [[Nim]] is played as usual with heaps of objects, but that at the start of play, 
every heap is restricted to have either one or two objects in it.  In the [[Normal play convention|normal-play convention]], players take turns to remove any number of objects from a heap, and the last player to take an object from a heap is declared the winner of the game; in Misere play, that player is the loser of the game.  

Regardless of whether the normal or misere play convention is in effect, the '''outcome''' of such a position is necessarily of one
of two types:

; N :  The Next player to move has a forced win in best play; or

; P : The Previous player to move has a forced win.

We can write down a commutative monoid presentation for the misere quotient of this 1- and 2-pile Nim game by 
first recasting its conventional [[nimber]]-based solution into a multiplicative form, 
and then modifying that slightly for misere play.

===Normal-play analysis===

The [[nimber]]s that occur in the normal play of such positions are *0, *1, *2, and *3.

{|class=wikitable
!Nimber || Outcome || Positions with that nimber
|-
!&lt;math&gt;\ast 0&lt;/math&gt; 
| style="text-align:center" | P || style="text-align:right" | Even number of heaps of size 1&lt;br/&gt;and even number of heaps of size 2
|- 
!&lt;math&gt;\ast 1&lt;/math&gt; 
| style="text-align:center" | N || style="text-align:right" |  Odd number of heaps of size 1&lt;br/&gt;and even number of heaps of size 2
|-
!&lt;math&gt;\ast 2&lt;/math&gt; 
| style="text-align:center" | N || style="text-align:right" | Even number of heaps of size 1&lt;br/&gt;and odd number of heaps of size 2
|-
!&lt;math&gt;\ast 3&lt;/math&gt; 
| style="text-align:center" | N || style="text-align:right" |  Odd number of heaps of size 1&lt;br/&gt;and odd number of heaps of size 2
|}

These four nim values combine according to the [[Klein four-group]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|ccc}
+
&amp; \ast 0
&amp; \ast 1
&amp; \ast 2
&amp; \ast 3
\\
\hline
\ast 0 &amp;
\ast 0 &amp; \ast 1 &amp; \ast 2 &amp; \ast 3
\\
\ast 1 &amp;
\ast 1 &amp; \ast 0 &amp; \ast 3 &amp; \ast 2
\\
\ast 2 &amp;
\ast 2 &amp; \ast 3 &amp; \ast 0 &amp; \ast 1
\\
\ast 3 &amp;
\ast 3 &amp; \ast 2 &amp; \ast 1 &amp; \ast 0
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;

The Klein four-group is also defined by the commutative [[group presentation]]

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{V} = \langle a,b \mid a^2 = b^2 = 1 \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

The elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{V} = \{1, a, b, ab\} &lt;/math&gt; can be thought of as in one-to-correspondence with the nim values
&lt;math&gt;\{\ast 0, \ast 1, \ast 2, \ast 3\}&lt;/math&gt; that occur in the play of this simplified Nim game; they combine exactly in the same way.

So far, this formal introduction of the Klein four-group has added nothing new to the conventional analysis of 1- and 2-pile Nim using nimbers and nim-addition.   
Instead, we have merely recast the theory into a multiplicative form.

===Misere-play analysis===

The advantage of the multiplicative form is that it allows us to write down a similar solution for the misere quotient of Nim played with heaps of size one and two only.

We introduce the commutative [[Presentation of a monoid|monoid presentation]]

: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{M} = \langle a, b \mid a^2 = 1, \ b^3 = b \rangle.&lt;/math&gt;

whose six elements are &lt;math&gt;\{1, a, b, ab, b^2, ab^2\}.&lt;/math&gt;

{|class=wikitable
!Misere quotient value || Outcome || Positions in that class
|- align
| style="text-align:center" | {{math|1}} 
| style="text-align:center" | N || Even number of heaps of size 1 and no heaps of size 2
|-
| style="text-align:center" | {{mvar|a}} 
| style="text-align:center" | P || Odd number of heaps of size 1 and no heaps of size 2
|-
| style="text-align:center" | {{mvar|b}}

|-
| style="text-align:center" | {{mvar|ab}} 
| style="text-align:center" | N || Odd number of heaps of size 1 and odd number of heaps of size 2
|-
| style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;b^2&lt;/math&gt; 
| style="text-align:center" | P || Even number of heaps of size 1 and even number (greater than zero) of heaps of size 2 
|-
 |style="text-align:center" | &lt;math&gt;ab^2&lt;/math&gt; 
| style="text-align:center" | N || Odd number of heaps of size 1 and even number (greater than zero) of heaps of size 2

The solution to the correct play of misere Nim was already fully described by Bouton in 1902.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the final sentence of that paper, Bouton writes that in misere Nim, "the safe combinations are the same as before, except that an odd number of piles, each containing one, is now safe [ie, is an P-position], while an even number of ones is not safe [ie, is an N-position]."   The misere quotient formulation above is easily seen to be equivalent in the case of Nim played with heaps of size one and two only.

== Formal definition ==

Suppose &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a set of impartial combinatorial games that is finitely-generated with respect to disjunctive sums and '''closed''' in both of the following senses:

(1) '''Additive closure''':  If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; are games in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, then their disjunctive sum &lt;math&gt;G + H&lt;/math&gt; is also in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

(2) '''Hereditary closure''':  If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a game in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is an option of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is also in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.

Next, define on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; the '''indistinguishability congruence''' ≈ that relates two games &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; if for every choice of a game &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, the two positions &lt;math&gt;G+X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H+X&lt;/math&gt; have the same outcome (i.e., are either both first-player wins in best play of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, or alternatively are both second-player wins).

One easily checks that ≈ is indeed a congruence on the set of all disjunctive position sums in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and that this is true regardless of whether the game is played in normal or misere play.  The totality of all the congruence classes form the '''indistinguishability quotient'''.

If &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is played as a normal-play (last-playing winning) impartial game, then the congruence classes of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are in one-to-one correspondence with the nim values that occur in the play of the game (themselves determined by the [[Sprague–Grundy theorem]]).

In misere play, the congruence classes form a [[commutative monoid]], instead, and it has become known as a misere quotient.

==Algorithms for computing misere quotients==
Many more complicated and intricate misere quotients have been calculated for various impartial games, and particularly for [[octal games]].
A general-purpose algorithm for computing the misere quotient monoid presentation of a given a finite set of misere impartial game positions has been devised by Aaron N. Siegel and is described&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Statement of the theorem==
Let &lt;math&gt;I_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt; be two [[interval (mathematics)|intervals]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;.

where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary real number.

[[File:FunktionUmkehrIntegral2.svg|thumb|Illustration of the theorem]]

In his 1905 article, Laisant gave three proofs.  First, under the additional hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]], one may differentiate the above formula, which completes the proof immediately.  His second proof was geometric.  If &lt;math&gt;f(a)=c&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(b)=d&lt;/math&gt;, the theorem can be written: 
:&lt;math&gt;\int_c^df^{-1}(y)\,dy+\int_a^bf(x)\,dx=bd-ac.&lt;/math&gt;
The figure on the right is a [[proof without words]] of this formula.  Laisant does not discuss the hypotheses necessary to make this proof rigorous, but it can be made explicit with the help of the [[Darboux integral]]&lt;ref name=Key/&gt; (or [[Fubini's theorem]]&lt;ref name=Bensimhoun&gt;{{cite arXiv|last=Bensimhoun|first=Michael|title=On the antiderivative of inverse functions|year=2013 |arxiv=1312.3839}}&lt;/ref&gt; if a demonstration based on the Lebesgue integral is desired).  Laisant's third proof uses the additional hypothesis that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is differentiable.  Beginning with &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(f(x)) = x&lt;/math&gt;, one multiplies by &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; and integrates both sides.  The right-hand side is calculated using integration by parts to be &lt;math&gt;xf(x) - \textstyle\int f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;, and the formula follows.

Nevertheless, it can be shown that this theorem holds even if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is not differentiable:&lt;ref name=Key/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bensimhoun/&gt; it suffices, for example, to use the Stieltjes integral in the previous argument.  On the other hand, even though general monotonic functions are differentiable almost everywhere, the proof of the general formula does not follow, unless &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is [[absolutely continuous]].&lt;ref name=Bensimhoun/&gt;

It is also possible to check that for every &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;I_2&lt;/math&gt;, the derivative of the function &lt;math&gt;y \to y f^{-1}(y) -F(f^{-1}(y))&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;This very simple proof of the general theorem, the only one that does not make use of integrals, was communicated by the French mathematician and Wikipedian Anne Bauval in the corresponding pages in French. It seems to have escaped the persons who published proofs of this result.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x\in I_1\quad\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{(x+h)f(x+h)-xf(x)-\left(F(x+h)-F(x)\right)}{f(x+h)-f(x)}=x.&lt;/math&gt;
To this end, it suffices to apply the [[mean value theorem]] to &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x+h&lt;/math&gt;, taking into account that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is monotonic.

==Examples==
#Assume that &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\exp(x)&lt;/math&gt;, hence &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)=\ln(y).&lt;/math&gt; The formula above gives immediately&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\quad\int \ln(y) \, dy = y\ln(y)-y + C.&lt;/math&gt;
#Similarly, with &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\cos(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(y)=\arccos(y),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\quad\int \arccos(y) \, dy = y\arccos(y) - \sin(\arccos(y))+C.&lt;/math&gt;
#With &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \tan(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; f^{-1}(y) = \arctan(y),&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;\quad\int \arctan(y) \, dy = y\arctan(y) + \ln|\cos(\arctan(y))| + C. &lt;/math&gt;

==History==
Apparently, this theorem of integration was discovered for the first time in 1905 by [[Charles-Ange Laisant]],&lt;ref name="Laisant"/&gt; who "could hardly believe that this theorem is new", and hoped its use would henceforth spread out among students and teachers. This result was published independently in 1912 by an Italian engineer, Alberto Caprilli, in an opuscule entitled "Nuove formole d'integrazione".&lt;ref name="Caprilli"&gt;[http://ebooks.library.cornell.edu/cgi/t/text/pageviewer-idx?c=math&amp;cc=math&amp;idno=00420001&amp;view=image&amp;seq=5&amp;size=100 Read online]&lt;/ref&gt; It was rediscovered in 1955 by Parker,&lt;ref name=Parker&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parker|first=F. D.|title=Integrals of inverse functions|date=Jun–Jul 1955|pages = 439–440|volume=62|journal=[[The American Mathematical Monthly]]|doi=10.2307/2307006|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by a number of mathematicians following him.&lt;ref&gt;It is equally possible that some or all of them simply recalled this result in their paper, without referring to previous authors.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, they all assume that {{math|''f''}} or {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}} is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]]. 
The general version of the [[theorem]], free from this additional assumption, was proposed by Michael Spivak in 1965, as an exercise in the ''Calculus'',&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Spivak]], ''Calculus'' (1967), chap. 13, pp. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; and a  fairly complete proof following the same lines was published by Eric Key in 1994.&lt;ref name=Key&gt;{{cite journal|last=Key|first=E. |title=Disks, Shells, and Integrals of Inverse Functions|date=Mar 1994|pages = 136–138|volume=25|journal=[[The College Mathematics Journal]]|issue=2|doi=10.2307/2687137}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This proof relies on the very definition of the [[Darboux integral]], and consists in showing that the upper [[Darboux integral|Darboux sums]] of the function {{math|f}} are in 1-1 correspondence with the lower Darboux sums of {{math|''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}.   
In 2013, Michael Bensimhoun, estimating that the general theorem was still insufficiently known, gave two other proofs:&lt;ref name="Bensimhoun"/&gt; The second proof, based on the [[Stieltjes integral]] and on its formulae of [[integration by parts]] and of [[homeomorphic]] [[integration by substitution|change of variables]], is the most suitable to establish more complex formulae.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance the formula at the end of his article.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalization to holomorphic functions==
The above theorem generalizes in the obvious way to holomorphic functions:
Let &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be two open and simply connected sets of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, and assume that &lt;math&gt;f: U\to V&lt;/math&gt; is a [[biholomorphism]].  Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; have antiderivatives, and if &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; is an antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, the general antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is
:&lt;math&gt;G(z)= z f^{-1}(z)-F\circ f^{-1}(z)+C.&lt;/math&gt;

Because all holomorphic functions are differentiable, the proof is immediate by complex differentiation.

[[File:Arc-welding.jpg|thumb|An industrial robot performing [[arc welding]]. Inverse kinematics computes the joint trajectories needed for the robot to guide the welding tip along the part.]]

'''Inverse kinematics''' is the mathematical process of recovering the movements of an object in the world from some other data, such as a film of those movements, or a film of the world as seen by a camera which is itself making those movements. This is useful in robotics and in film animation.

In robotics, inverse kinematics makes use of the [[kinematics]] equations to determine the joint parameters that provide a desired position for each of the robot's [[Robot end effector|end-effectors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Paul  | first = Richard  | title = Robot manipulators: mathematics, programming, and control : the computer control of robot manipulators  | publisher = MIT Press, Cambridge, MA  | year = 1981  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UzZ3LAYqvRkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false  | isbn =978-0-262-16082-7
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specification of the movement of a robot so that its end-effectors achieve the desired tasks is known as [[motion planning]].  Inverse kinematics transforms the motion plan into joint [[actuator]] trajectories for the robot. Similar formulae determine the positions of the skeleton of an [[character (arts)|animated character]] that is to move in a particular way in a film, or of a vehicle such as a car or boat containing the camera which is shooting a scene of a film. Once a vehicle's motions are known, they can be used to determine the constantly-changing viewpoint for computer-generated imagery of objects in the landscape such as buildings, so that these objects change in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] while themselves not appearing to move as the vehicle-borne camera goes past them.

The movement of a [[kinematic chain]], whether it is a robot or an animated character, is modeled by the kinematics equations of the chain.  These equations define the configuration of the chain in terms of its joint parameters.  [[Forward kinematics]] uses the joint parameters to compute the configuration of the chain, and inverse kinematics reverses this calculation to determine the joint parameters that achieve a desired configuration.&lt;ref&gt;J.

==Kinematic analysis==
[[File:Modele cinematique corps humain.svg|thumb|upright|A model of the human skeleton as a kinematic chain allows positioning using inverse kinematics.]]
Kinematic analysis is one of the first steps in the design of most industrial robots. Kinematic analysis allows the designer to obtain information on the position of each component within the mechanical system. This information is necessary for subsequent dynamic analysis along with control paths.

Inverse kinematics is an example of the kinematic analysis of a constrained system of rigid bodies, or [[kinematic chain]].  The [[kinematic equations]] of a robot can be used to define the loop equations of a complex articulated system.  These loop equations are non-linear constraints on the configuration parameters of the system.  The independent parameters in these equations are known as the [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] of the system.

While analytical solutions to the inverse kinematics problem exist for a wide range of kinematic chains, computer modeling and animation tools often use [[Newton's method]] to solve the non-linear kinematics equations.

Other applications of inverse kinematic algorithms include [[interactive manipulation]], [[animation control]] and [[Collision detection|collision avoidance]].

==Inverse kinematics and 3D animation==
{{Further|Robotics|Computer animation}}
Inverse kinematics is important to [[game programmer|game programming]] and [[3D animation]], where it is used to connect [[Player character|game characters]] physically to the world, such as feet landing firmly on top of terrain (see  &lt;ref&gt;A. Aristidou, J. Lasenby, Y. Chrysanthou, A. Shamir. [https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13310 Inverse Kinematics Techniques in Computer Graphics: A Survey]. Computer Graphics Forum, 37(6): 35-58, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; for a comprehensive survey on [https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13310 Inverse Kinematics methods used in Computer Graphics]).

An animated figure is modeled with a skeleton of rigid segments connected with joints, called a [[kinematic chain]].  The kinematics equations of the figure define the relationship between the joint angles of the figure and its pose or configuration.  The [[forward kinematic animation]] problem uses the kinematics equations to determine the pose given the joint angles.   The ''inverse kinematics problem'' computes the joint angles for a desired pose of the figure.

It is often easier for computer-based designers, artists, and animators to define the spatial configuration of an assembly or figure by moving parts, or arms and legs, rather than directly manipulating joint angles.  Therefore, inverse kinematics is used in computer-aided design systems to animate assemblies and by computer-based artists and animators to position figures and characters.

The assembly is modeled as rigid links connected by joints that are defined as mates, or geometric constraints.  Movement of one element requires the computation of the joint angles for the other elements to maintain the joint constraints.  For example, inverse kinematics allows an artist to move the hand of a 3D human model to a desired position and orientation and have an algorithm select the proper angles of the wrist, elbow, and shoulder joints.  Successful implementation of computer [[animation]] usually also requires that the figure move within reasonable [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] limits.

== Analytical solutions to inverse kinematics ==

An analytic solution to an inverse kinematics problem is a closed-form expression that takes the end-effector pose as input and gives joint positions as output, &lt;math&gt;q = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Analytical inverse kinematics solvers can be significantly faster than numerical solvers and provide more than one solution for a given end-effector pose.

The [[IKFast]] open-source program can solve for the complete analytical solutions of most common robot manipulators and generate C++ code for them. The generated solvers cover most degenerate cases and can finish in microseconds on recent computers.{{Advert inline|date=September 2017}}

== Approximating solutions to IK systems ==

There are many methods of modelling and solving inverse kinematics problems. The most flexible of these methods typically rely on [[Iterative method|iterative optimization]] to seek out an approximate solution, due to the difficulty of inverting the forward kinematics equation and the possibility of an empty [[solution space]]. The core idea behind several of these methods is to model the forward kinematics equation using a [[Taylor series]] expansion, which can be simpler to invert and solve than the original system.

=== The Jacobian inverse technique ===

The [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian]] inverse technique is a simple yet effective way of implementing inverse kinematics. Let there be &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; variables that govern the forward-kinematics equation, i.e. the position function. These variables may be joint angles, lengths, or other arbitrary real values. If the IK system lives in a 3-dimensional space, the position function can be viewed as a mapping &lt;math&gt;p(x): \Re^m \rightarrow \Re^3&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;p_0 = p(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; give the initial position of the system, and 

&lt;math&gt;p_1 = p(x_0 + \Delta x)&lt;/math&gt;

be the goal position of the system. The Jacobian inverse technique iteratively computes an estimate of &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; that minimizes the error given by &lt;math&gt;||p(x_0 + \Delta x_{estimate}) - p_1||&lt;/math&gt;.

For small &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;-vectors, the series expansion of the position function gives:

&lt;math&gt;p(x_1) \approx p(x_0) + J_p(x_0)\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;J_p(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; is the (3 x m) [[Jacobian matrix and determinant|Jacobian matrix]] of the position function at &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the (i, k)-th entry of the Jacobian matrix can be determined numerically:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial p_i}{\partial x_k} \approx \frac{p_i(x_{0,k} + h) - p_i(x_0)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;p_i(x)&lt;/math&gt; gives the i-th component of the position function, &lt;math&gt;x_{0,k} + h&lt;/math&gt; is simply &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt; with a small delta added to its k-th component, and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is a reasonably small positive value.

Taking the [[Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse]] of the Jacobian (computable using a [[singular value decomposition]]) and re-arranging terms results in:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta x \approx J_p^+(x_0)\Delta p&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;\Delta p = p(x_0 + \Delta x) - p(x_0)&lt;/math&gt;.

Applying the inverse Jacobian method once will result in a very rough estimate of the desired &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;-vector. A [[line search]] should be used to scale this &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; to an acceptable value. The estimate for &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; can be improved via the following algorithm (known as the [[Newton-Raphson]] method):

&lt;math&gt;\Delta x_{k+1} = J_p^+(x_k)\Delta p_k&lt;/math&gt;

Once some &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;-vector has caused the error to drop close to zero, the algorithm should terminate. Existing methods based on the [[Hessian matrix]] of the system have been reported to converge to desired &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; values using fewer iterations, though, in some cases more computational resources.

=== Heuristic Methods ===

The Inverse Kinematics problem can also be approximated using heuristic methods. These methods perform simple, iterative operations to gradually lead to an approximation of the solution. The heuristic algorithms have low computational cost (return the final pose very quickly), and usually support joint constraints. The most popular heuristic algorithms are: [[Cyclic Coordinate Descent]] (CCD)&lt;ref&gt;D. G. Luenberger. 1989. Linear and Nonlinear Programming. Addison Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt;, and [https://doi.org/10.1016/j.gmod.2011.05.003 Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics] (FABRIK)&lt;ref&gt;A. Aristidou, and J. Lasenby. 2011.

[[File:Denes König - Über eine Schlussweise aus dem Endlichen ins Unendliche.png|thumb|Kőnig's 1927 publication]]
'''Kőnig's lemma''' or '''Kőnig's infinity lemma''' is a [[theorem]] in [[graph theory]] due to {{harvs|first=Dénes|last=Kőnig|authorlink=Dénes Kőnig|year=1927|txt}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Kőnig|1927}} as explained in {{harvtxt|Franchella|1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives a sufficient condition for an infinite graph to have an infinitely long path. The computability aspects of this theorem have been thoroughly investigated by researchers in [[mathematical logic]], especially in [[recursion theory|computability theory]].  This theorem also has important roles in [[constructive mathematics]] and [[proof theory]].

==Statement of the lemma==
Let ''G'' be a [[connected graph|connected]], [[Glossary of graph theory terms#finite|locally finite]], [[Glossary of graph theory terms#finite|infinite graph]] (this means, in particular, that each vertex is adjacent to only finitely many other vertices). Then ''G'' contains a [[Ray (graph theory)|ray]]: a [[path (graph theory)|simple path]] (a path with no repeated vertices) that starts at one vertex and continues from it through infinitely many vertices.

A common special case of this is that every infinite [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] contains either a vertex of infinite [[degree (graph theory)|degree]] or an infinite simple path.

===Proof===
Let ''v''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; be the set of vertices. As premise, we assume that this set is infinite and the graph is connected.

Start with any vertex ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Every one of the infinitely many vertices of ''G'' can be reached from ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with a simple path,  and each such path must start with one of the finitely many vertices adjacent to ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. There must be one of those adjacent vertices through which infinitely many vertices can be reached without going through ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If there were not, then the entire graph would be the union of finitely many finite sets, and thus finite, contradicting the assumption that the graph is infinite. We may thus pick one of these vertices and call it ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Now infinitely many vertices of ''G'' can be reached from ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a simple path which does not include the vertex ''v''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Each such path must start with one of the finitely many vertices adjacent to ''v''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. So an argument similar to the one above shows that there must be one of those adjacent vertices through which infinitely many vertices can be reached; pick one and call it ''v''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

Continuing in this fashion, an infinite simple path can be constructed using [[mathematical induction]] and a weak version of the [[axiom of dependent choice]]. At each step, the induction hypothesis states that there are infinitely many nodes reachable by a simple path from a particular node ''v''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; that does not go through one of a finite set of vertices. The induction argument is that one of the vertices adjacent to ''v''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; satisfies the induction hypothesis, even when ''v''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is added to the finite set.

The result of this induction argument is that for all ''n'' it is possible to choose a vertex ''v''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; as the construction describes. The set of vertices chosen in the construction is then a chain in the graph, because each one was chosen to be adjacent to the previous one, and the construction guarantees that the same vertex is never chosen twice.

This proof is not generally considered to be  [[mathematical constructivism|constructive]], because at each step it uses a [[Reductio ad absurdum|proof by contradiction]] to establish that there exists an adjacent vertex from which infinitely many other vertices can be reached, and because of the reliance on a weak form of the [[axiom of choice]]. Facts about the computational aspects of the lemma suggest that no proof can be given that would be considered constructive by the main schools of [[constructive mathematics]].

==Computability aspects==
The computability aspects of Kőnig's lemma have been thoroughly investigated.  The form of Kőnig's lemma most convenient for this purpose is the one which states that any infinite finitely branching subtree of &lt;math&gt;\omega^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt; has an infinite path.   Here &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; denotes the set of natural numbers (thought of as an [[ordinal number]]) and &lt;math&gt;\omega^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt; the tree whose nodes are all finite sequences of natural numbers, where the parent of a node is obtained by removing the last element from a sequence.  Each finite sequence can be identified with a partial function from &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to itself, and each infinite path can be identified with a total function.  This allows for an analysis using the techniques of computability theory.

A subtree of &lt;math&gt;\omega^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt; in which each sequence has only finitely many immediate extensions (that is, the tree has finite degree when viewed as a graph) is called '''finitely branching'''.  Not every infinite subtree of &lt;math&gt;\omega^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt; has an infinite path, but Kőnig's lemma shows that any finitely branching subtree must have such a path.

For any subtree ''T'' of &lt;math&gt;\omega^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt; the notation Ext(''T'') denotes the set of nodes of ''T'' through which there is an infinite path.  Even when ''T'' is computable the set Ext(''T'') may not be computable.  Every subtree ''T'' of
&lt;math&gt;\omega^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt; that has a path has a path computable from Ext(''T'').

It is known that there are non-finitely branching computable subtrees of &lt;math&gt;\omega^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt; that have no [[arithmetical hierarchy|arithmetical]] path, and indeed no [[analytical hierarchy|hyperarithmetical]] path.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Rogers|1967}}, p.&amp;nbsp;418ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, every computable subtree of &lt;math&gt;\omega^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt; with a path must have a path computable from [[Kleene's O]], the canonical &lt;math&gt;\Pi^1_1&lt;/math&gt; complete set.  This is because the set Ext(''T'') is always &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^1_1&lt;/math&gt; (see [[analytical hierarchy]]) when ''T'' is computable.

A finer analysis has been conducted for computably bounded trees.  A subtree of &lt;math&gt;\omega^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt; is called '''computably bounded''' or '''recursively bounded''' if there is a computable function ''f'' from &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; such that for every sequence in the tree and every ''n'', the ''n''th element of the sequence is at most ''f''(''n'').  Thus ''f'' gives a bound for how “wide” the tree is.  The following [[basis theorem (computability)|basis theorem]]s apply to infinite, computably bounded, computable subtrees of &lt;math&gt;\omega^{&lt; \omega}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Any such tree has a path computable from &lt;math&gt;0'&lt;/math&gt;, the canonical Turing complete set that can decide the [[halting problem]].
* Any such tree has a path that is [[Low (computability)|low]].  This is known as the [[low basis theorem]].
* Any such tree has a path that is ''hyperimmune free''.  This means that any function computable from the path is dominated by a computable function.
* For any noncomputable subset ''X'' of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; the tree has a path that does not compute&amp;nbsp;''X''.

A weak form of Kőnig's lemma which states that every infinite binary tree has an infinite branch is used to define the subsystem WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of [[second-order arithmetic]].  This subsystem has an important role in [[reverse mathematics]]. Here a binary tree is one in which every term of every sequence in the tree is 0 or 1, which is to say the tree is computably bounded via the constant function 2.  The full form of Kőnig's lemma is not provable in WKL&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, but is equivalent to the stronger subsystem ACA&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Relationship to constructive mathematics and compactness==
The fan theorem of {{harvs|first=L. E. J.|last=Brouwer|authorlink=Luitzen Egbertus Jan Brouwer|year=1927|txt}} is, from a classical point of view, the contrapositive of a form of Kőnig's lemma.  A subset ''S'' of &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''bar'' if any function from &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to the set &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; has some initial segment in ''S''.  A bar is ''detachable'' if every sequence is either in the bar or not in the bar (this assumption is required because the theorem is ordinarily considered in situations where the law of the excluded middle is not assumed).   A bar is ''uniform'' if there is some number ''N'' so that any function from &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}&lt;/math&gt; has an initial segment in the bar of length no more than &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;.  Brouwer's [[fan theorem]] says that any detachable bar is uniform.

This can be proven in a classical setting by considering the bar as an open covering of the [[Compact space|compact]] topological space &lt;math&gt;\{0,1\}^\omega&lt;/math&gt;.  Each sequence in the bar represents a basic open set of this space, and these basic open sets cover the space by assumption.  By compactness, this cover has a finite subcover.  The ''N'' of the fan theorem can be taken to be the length of the longest sequence whose basic open set is in the finite subcover. This topological proof can be used in classical mathematics to show that the following form of Kőnig's lemma holds:  for any natural number ''k'', any infinite subtree of the tree &lt;math&gt;\{0,\ldots,k\}^{&lt;\omega}&lt;/math&gt; has an infinite path.

==Relationship with the axiom of choice==
Kőnig's lemma may be considered to be a choice principle; the first proof above illustrates the relationship between the lemma and the [[axiom of dependent choice]].  At each step of the induction, a vertex with a particular property must be selected.  Although it is proved that at least one appropriate vertex exists, if there is more than one suitable vertex there may be no canonical choice.  In fact, the full strength of the axiom of dependent choice is not needed; as described below, the [[axiom of countable choice]] suffices.

If the graph is countable, the vertices are well-ordered and one can canonically choose the smallest suitable vertex. In this case, Kőnig's lemma is provable in second-order arithmetic with [[arithmetical comprehension]], and, a fortiori, in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF set theory]] (without choice).

Kőnig's lemma is essentially the restriction of the axiom of dependent choice to entire relations ''R'' such that for each ''x'' there are only finitely many ''z'' such that ''xRz''.  Although the axiom of choice is, in general, stronger than the principle of dependent choice, this restriction of dependent choice is equivalent to a restriction of the axiom of choice.
In particular, when the branching at each node is done on a finite subset of an arbitrary set not assumed to be countable, the form of Kőnig's lemma that says "Every infinite finitely branching tree has an infinite path" is equivalent to the principle that every countable set of finite sets has a choice function, that is to say, the axiom of countable choice for finite sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Truss|1976}}, p.&amp;nbsp;273; compare {{harvtxt|Lévy|1979}}, Exercise IX.2.18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Howard | first1 = Paul | authorlink1 = Paul Howard (mathematician) | last2 = Rubin | first2 = Jean | authorlink2 = Jean E. Rubin | title = Consequences of the Axiom of Choice | year = 1998 | publisher = American Mathematical Society | place = Providence, RI | series = Mathematical Surveys and Monographs | volume = 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; This form of the axiom of choice (and hence of Kőnig's lemma) is not provable in ZF set theory.

'''Leonard Henry Courtney, 1st Baron Courtney of Penwith''', [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (6 July 1832{{snd}}11 May 1918) was a radical British politician, and an academic, who became famous after being advocate of [[proportional representation]] in Parliament and acting as an opponent of [[imperialism]] and [[militarism]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonard-Henry-Courtney-Baron-Courtney-of-Penwith&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of [[William Ewart Gladstone]]'s [[Liberal Government 1880–1885|second administration]] from 1880 to 1883 and served as [[Chairman of Ways and Means]] (Deputy [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]) between 1886 and 1893.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Leonard-Henry-Courtney-Baron-Courtney-of-Penwith&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first and the last [[Baron Courtney of Penwith]].&lt;ref&gt;http://thepeerage.com/p20381.htm#i203809&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and education==
Courtney was born at [[Penzance]], Cornwall. He was the eldest son of John Sampson Courtney, a banker, and Sarah, daughter of John Mortimer.&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"&gt;[http://thepeerage.com/p20381.htm#i203809 thepeerage.com Leonard Henry Courtney, 1st and last Baron Courtney of Penwith]&lt;/ref&gt; Two of his brothers, [[John Mortimer Courtney]] (1838–1920), and [[William Prideaux Courtney]] (1845–1913), also attained public distinction, the former in the government service in Canada (from 1869, retiring in 1906), rising to be deputy-minister of finance, and the latter in the British civil service (1865–1892), and as a prominent man of letters and bibliographer. He was educated at [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he was [[Second Wrangler]] and first [[Smith's prize]]man, and elected a fellow of his college.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=CRTY851LH|name=Courtney, Leonard Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Call to the Bar|called to the Bar]] at [[Lincoln's Inn]] in 1858. From 1872 to 1875 he was professor of political economy at [[University College, London]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} He was president of the [[Royal Geological Society of Cornwall]] from 1881-82.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:15 Cheyne Walk 02.JPG|left|thumb|200px|[[15 Cheyne Walk]], Chelsea, London, where Courtney was living at the time of his death]]
In December 1876, after a previous unsuccessful attempt, Courtney was elected to parliament for [[Liskeard (UK Parliament constituency)|Liskeard]] as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]]. He continued to represent the borough, and [[Bodmin (UK Parliament constituency)|Bodmin]] into which it was merged by the [[Reform Act]] of 1885, until 1900, when his attitude towards the [[Second Boer War|South African War]] (he and his wife [[Catherine Courtney, Baroness Courtney of Penwith|Catherine]] were one of the foremost of the so-called Pro-[[Boer]] Party) compelled his retirement.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

Until 1885, he was a devoted adherent of [[William Ewart Gladstone]], particularly in finance and foreign affairs. In 1880 he was appointed [[Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department]], in 1881 [[Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies]] and in 1882 [[Financial Secretary to the Treasury]]. He was known as a stubborn fighter for principle, and after finding that the government's [[Representation of the People Act 1884|Reform Bill in 1884]] contained no recognition of the scheme for [[proportional representation]], to which he was deeply committed, he resigned office. He refused to support Gladstone's [[Home Rule Bill]] in 1886 and was one of those who chiefly contributed to its rejection, whose reputation for unbending integrity and intellectual eminence gave solidity to the [[Liberal Unionist]] party.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In 1886, Courtney was elected [[Chairman of Ways and Means]] (Deputy [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]]) and was sworn of the [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|Privy Council]] in 1889. His efficiency in this office seemed to mark him out for the speakership after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1895|1895 general election]]. A Liberal Unionist, however, could be elected only by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] votes, and he had made himself objectionable to a large section of the Conservative Party by his independent attitude on various questions, on which his liberalism outweighed his party loyalty. He, would in any case, have been incapacitated by an affection of the eyesight, which for a while threatened to withdraw him from public life altogether.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

After 1895, Courtney's divergences from the Unionist party on questions other than Irish politics became gradually more marked. He became known in the House of Commons principally for his candid criticism of the measures introduced by his nominal leaders, and he was rather to be ranked among the Opposition than as a Ministerialist. When the crisis with the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] came in 1899, Courtney's views, which remained substantially what they were when he supported the settlement after [[Majuba]] in 1881, had plainly become incompatible with his position even as a nominal follower of [[Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury|Lord Salisbury]] and [[Joseph Chamberlain]]. {{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}
He led the work of the [[South African Conciliation Committee]] which brought the sufferings of the Boers to the attention of British people.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Heloised|title="The truest form of patriotism": pacifist feminism in Britain, 1870–1902|year=2003|publisher=Manchester University Press|isbn=0-7190-6531-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OAWv3HGUrc0C&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=South%20African%20Conciliation%20Committee&amp;pg=PA170#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He gradually reverted to formal membership of the Liberal party and, in January 1906, unsuccessfully contested [[Edinburgh West (UK Parliament constituency)|Edinburgh West]] as a supporter of Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] at the general election. Among the [[British honours system|birthday honours]] of 1906 he was elevated to the peerage as '''Baron Courtney of Penwith''', in the County of Cornwall.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=27933 |date=20 July 1906 |page=4973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtney was a prominent supporter of the women's movement through the influence of his wife and sister-in-law. In his earlier years, he was a regular contributor to ''The Times'', and he wrote numerous essays in the principal reviews on political and economic subjects. In 1901 he published a book on ''The Working Constitution of the United Kingdom''. He was [[President of the Royal Statistical Society]], 1897-9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rss.org.uk/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=486 |title=Royal Statistical Society Presidents |publisher=Royal Statistical Society |accessdate=6 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317044817/http://www.rss.org.uk/site/cms/contentviewarticle.asp?article=486 |archivedate=17 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a great friend of the artist [[Norman Garstin]].

==Personal life==
[[File:Leonard and Kate Courtney, c1916.jpg|thumb|right|Lord Courtney and his wife Catherine in 1916]]
Courtney married [[Catherine Courtney, Baroness Courtney of Penwith|Catherine Potter]], daughter of Richard Potter and an elder sister of [[Beatrice Webb]], in 1883. They had no children.

In May 1918, aged 85, he was living at [[15 Cheyne Walk]] at the time of his death. He left effects totalling £56,672 2s 6d.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1918|url=http://interactive.ancestry.co.uk/1904/31874_222791-00596/4714647|work=England &amp; Wales, National Probate Calendar (Index of Wills and Administrations), 1858–1966|publisher=Ancestry.co.uk|accessdate=29 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The peerage became extinct.&lt;ref name="thepeerage.com"/&gt;

This '''list of mathematical series''' contains formulae for finite and infinite sums. It can be used in conjunction with other tools for evaluating sums.
*Here, &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt; is taken to have the value &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;B_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Bernoulli polynomial]].
*&lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Bernoulli number]], and here, &lt;math&gt;B_1=-\frac{1}{2}.&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;E_n&lt;/math&gt; is an [[Euler number]].
*&lt;math&gt;\zeta(s)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Riemann zeta function]].
*&lt;math&gt;\Gamma(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gamma function]].
*&lt;math&gt;\psi_n(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[polygamma function]].
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Li}_s(z)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[polylogarithm]].
*&lt;math&gt; n \choose k &lt;/math&gt; is [[binomial coefficient]]
*&lt;math&gt;\exp(x)&lt;/math&gt;denotes [[Exponential function|exponential]] of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;

==Sums of powers==
See [[Faulhaber's formula]].
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^m k^{n-1}=\frac{B_n(m+1)-B_n}{n}&lt;/math&gt;
The first few values are:
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^m k=\frac{m(m+1)}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^m k^2=\frac{m(m+1)(2m+1)}{6}=\frac{m^3}{3}+\frac{m^2}{2}+\frac{m}{6}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^m k^3

=\left[\frac{m(m+1)}{2}\right]^2=\frac{m^4}{4}+\frac{m^3}{2}+\frac{m^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

See [[zeta constants]].
*&lt;math&gt;\zeta(2n)=\sum^{\infty}_{k=1} \frac{1}{k^{2n}}=(-1)^{n+1} \frac{B_{2n} (2\pi)^{2n}}{2(2n)!} &lt;/math&gt;
The first few values are:
*&lt;math&gt;\zeta(2)=\sum^{\infty}_{k=1} \frac{1}{k^2}=\frac{\pi^2}{6}&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Basel problem]])
*&lt;math&gt;\zeta(4)=\sum^{\infty}_{k=1} \frac{1}{k^4}=\frac{\pi^4}{90}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\zeta(6)=\sum^{\infty}_{k=1} \frac{1}{k^6}=\frac{\pi^6}{945}&lt;/math&gt;

==Power series==

===Low-order polylogarithms===
Finite sums:
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^{n} z^k = \frac{1-z^{n+1}}{1-z}&lt;/math&gt;, ([[geometric series]])
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n k z^k = z\frac{1-(n+1)z^n+nz^{n+1}}{(1-z)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n k^2 z^k = z\frac{1+z-(n+1)^2z^n+(2n^2+2n-1)z^{n+1}-n^2z^{n+2}}{(1-z)^3} &lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^n k^m z^k = \left(z \frac{d}{dz}\right)^m \frac{1-z^{n+1}}{1-z}&lt;/math&gt;

Infinite sums, valid for &lt;math&gt;|z|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; (see [[polylogarithm]]):
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Li}_n(z)=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \frac{z^k}{k^n}&lt;/math&gt;
The following is a useful property to calculate low-integer-order polylogarithms recursively in [[Closed-form expression|closed form]]:
*&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}z}\operatorname{Li}_n(z)=\frac{\operatorname{Li}_{n-1}(z)}{z}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Li}_{1}(z)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty \frac{z^k}{k}=-\ln(1-z)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Li}_{0}(z)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty z^k=\frac{z}{1-z}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Li}_{-1}(z)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty k z^k=\frac{z}{(1-z)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Li}_{-2}(z)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty k^2 z^k=\frac{z(1+z)}{(1-z)^3}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Li}_{-3}(z)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty k^3 z^k =\frac{z(1+4z+z^2)}{(1-z)^4}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Li}_{-4}(z)=\sum_{k=1}^\infty k^4 z^k =\frac{z(1+z)(1+10z+z^2)}{(1-z)^5}&lt;/math&gt;

===Exponential function===
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{k!} = e^z&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty k\frac{z^k}{k!} = z e^z&lt;/math&gt; (cf. mean of [[Poisson distribution]])
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty k^2 \frac{z^k}{k!} = (z + z^2) e^z&lt;/math&gt; (cf. [[second moment]] of Poisson distribution)
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty k^3 \frac{z^k}{k!} = (z + 3z^2 + z^3) e^z&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty k^4 \frac{z^k}{k!} = (z + 7z^2 + 6z^3 + z^4) e^z&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty k^n \frac{z^k}{k!} = z \frac{d}{dz} \sum_{k=0}^\infty k^{n-1} \frac{z^k}{k!}\,\! = e^z T_{n}(z) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;T_{n}(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Touchard polynomials]].

== Trigonometric functions ==
Sums of [[sine]]s and [[cosine]]s arise in [[Fourier series]].

*&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{\sin[(2k+1)\theta]}{2k+1}=\frac{\pi}{4}, 0&lt;\theta&lt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;
Calculate the Fourier expansion of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac\pi4&lt;/math&gt; on the interval &lt;math&gt;0&lt;x&lt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;:
*&lt;math&gt;\frac\pi4=\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n\sin[nx]+d_n\cos[nx]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow \begin{cases}c_n=\begin{cases}\frac1n\quad (n \text{ odd})\\
0\quad (n \text{ even})\end{cases}\\ d_n=0\quad (\forall n)\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2561">In [[mathematics]], '''Minkowski's first inequality for convex bodies''' is a [[geometrical]] result due to the [[Germany|German]] [[mathematician]] [[Hermann Minkowski]]. The inequality is closely related to the [[Brunn–Minkowski inequality]] and the [[isoperimetric inequality]].

==Statement of the inequality==

Let ''K'' and ''L'' be two ''n''-[[dimension]]al [[convex body|convex bodies]] in ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Define a quantity ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''K'',&amp;nbsp;''L'') by

:&lt;math&gt;n V_{1} (K, L) = \lim_{\varepsilon \downarrow 0} \frac{V (K + \varepsilon L) - V(K)}{\varepsilon},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''V'' denotes the ''n''-dimensional [[Lebesgue measure]] and + denotes the [[Minkowski sum]]. Then

:&lt;math&gt;V_{1} (K, L) \geq V(K)^{(n - 1) / n} V(L)^{1 / n},&lt;/math&gt;

with equality [[if and only if]] ''K'' and ''L'' are [[Homothetic transformation|homothetic]], i.e. are equal up to [[translation (geometry)|translation]] and [[dilation (metric space)|dilation]].

==Remarks==

* ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is just one example of a class of quantities known as ''[[mixed volume]]s''.
* If ''L'' is the ''n''-dimensional [[unit ball]] ''B'', then ''n''&amp;nbsp;''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''K'',&amp;nbsp;''B'') is the (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional surface measure of ''K'', denoted ''S''(''K'').

==Connection to other inequalities==
===The Brunn–Minkowski inequality===

One can show that the Brunn–Minkowski inequality for convex bodies in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; implies Minkowski's first inequality for convex bodies in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, and that equality in the Brunn–Minkowski inequality implies equality in Minkowski's first inequality.

===The isoperimetric inequality===

By taking ''L''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''B'', the ''n''-dimensional unit ball, in Minkowski's first inequality for convex bodies, one obtains the isoperimetric inequality for convex bodies in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;: if ''K'' is a convex body in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{V(K)}{V(B)} \right)^{1 / n} \leq \left( \frac{S(K)}{S(B)} \right)^{1 / (n - 1)},&lt;/math&gt;

with equality if and only if ''K'' is a ball of some radius.

In [[cryptography]], the '''Niederreiter cryptosystem''' is a variation of the [[McEliece cryptosystem]] developed in 1986 by [[Harald Niederreiter]].&lt;ref name="Niederreiter"&gt;{{cite journal
|author=H. Niederreiter
|title=Knapsack-type cryptosystems and algebraic coding theory
|journal=Problems of Control and Information Theory. Problemy Upravlenija i Teorii Informacii
|volume=15
|year=1986
|pages=159–166
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It applies the same idea to the [[parity check matrix]], '''H''', of a linear code. Niederreiter is equivalent to McEliece from a security point of view. It uses a syndrome as ciphertext and the message is an error pattern. The encryption of Niederreiter is about ten times faster than the encryption of McEliece. Niederreiter can be used to construct a [[digital signature]] scheme.

==Scheme definition==

A special case of Niederreiter's original proposal was broken&lt;ref name="SidelnikovS"&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=V. M. Sidel'nikov  |author2=S. O. Shestakov
 |lastauthoramp=yes |title=On the insecurity of cryptosystems based on generalized Reed-Solomon codes

|issue=4

|pages=439–444
|doi=10.1515/dma.1992.2.4.439
}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the system is secure when used with a [[Binary Goppa code]].

===Key generation===
#Alice selects a binary (''n'', ''k'')-linear Goppa code, ''G'', capable of correcting ''t'' errors.  This code possesses an efficient decoding algorithm.
#Alice generates a (''n'' − ''k'') × ''n'' parity check matrix, ''H'', for the code, ''G''.
#Alice selects a random (''n'' − ''k'') × (''n'' − ''k'') binary [[invertible matrix|non-singular matrix]], ''S''.
#Alice selects a random ''n'' × ''n'' [[permutation matrix]], ''P''.
#Alice computes the (''n'' − ''k'') × ''n'' matrix, ''H''&lt;sup&gt;pub&lt;/sup&gt; = ''SHP''.
#Alice’s public key is (''H''&lt;sup&gt;pub&lt;/sup&gt;, ''t''); her private key is (''S'', ''H'', ''P'').

=== Message encryption ===

Suppose Bob wishes to send a message, ''m'', to Alice whose public key is (''H''&lt;sup&gt;pub&lt;/sup&gt;, ''t''):

#Bob encodes the message, ''m'', as a binary string e&lt;sup&gt;m'&lt;/sup&gt; of length ''n'' and weight at most ''t''.
#Bob computes the ciphertext as ''c'' = ''H''&lt;sup&gt;pub&lt;/sup&gt;''m''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.

=== Message decryption ===
Upon receipt of ''c'' = ''H''&lt;sup&gt;pub&lt;/sup&gt;''m''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; from Bob, Alice does the following to retrieve the message, ''m''.

#Alice computes ''S''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''c'' = ''HPm''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.
#Alice applies a [[syndrome decoding]] algorithm for ''G'' to recover ''Pm''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.
#Alice computes the message, ''m'', via ''m''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = ''P''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;''Pm''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.


== Signature scheme==
Courtois, Finiasz and Sendrier showed how the Niederreiter cryptosystem can be used to derive a signature scheme
.&lt;ref name="CFS"&gt;{{cite journal
|author1=N. Courtois |author2=M. Finiaz |author3=N. Sendrier |title=How to achieve a McEliece-based Digital Signature Scheme

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Hash function|Hash]] the document, '''d''', to be signed (with a public hash algorithm).
# Decrypt this hash value as if it were an instance of ciphertext.
# Append the decrypted message to the document as a signature.

Verification then applies the public encryption function to the signature and checks whether or not this equals the hash value of the document. When using Niederreiter, or in fact any cryptosystem based on error correcting codes, the second step in the signature scheme almost always fails. This is because a random syndrome usually corresponds to an error pattern of weight greater than ''t''. The system then specifies a deterministic way of tweaking '''d''' until one is found which can be decrypted.

The choice of the code parameters is related to the probability that a random syndrome is decodable. Courtois, Finiaz, and Sendrier suggest the parameter values ''n'' = 2&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; and ''t'' = 9. Then the probability to decode a random syndrome is &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{9!}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, a decodable syndrome is found after an expected number of 9! attempts. Add a counter, ''i'', to the original document '''d''', to produce a slightly altered document, '''d'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. Hashing '''d'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; gives a syndrome that depends on ''i''. Let ''i'' run from 0 to ''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, with ''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the first value of ''i'' for which '''d'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; is decodable. In this case the decrypted message is a word, ''z'', of length ''n'' and weight 9, such that ''Hz''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; equals the hash value of '''d'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;. The signature will be ''z'' combined with the value ''i''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; for verification. This signature is attached to the original document, '''d'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14959">'''Patrick Michael Grundy''' (16 November 1917, [[Yarmouth, Isle of Wight]] – 4 November 1959) was an English [[mathematician]] and [[statistician]].  He was one of the eponymous co-discoverers of the [[Sprague–Grundy theorem#Development|Sprague–Grundy function]] and its application to the analysis of a wide class of [[Combinatorial game theory|combinatorial games]].&lt;ref&gt;Except where otherwise indicated by alternative citations, the sources for the material in this article are the obituaries by Goddard ([[#CITEREFGoddard1960|1960]]) and Smith ([[#CITEREFSmith1960|1960]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Grundy received his secondary education from  [[Malvern College]], to which he had obtained a Major Scholarship in 1931, and from which he graduated in 1935.  While there, he demonstrated his aptitude for mathematics by winning three prizes in that subject.  After leaving school he entered [[Clare College, Cambridge]], on a Foundation Scholarship, where he read for the [[Mathematical Tripos]] from 1936 to 1939, earning first class honours in part 2 and a distinction in part 3.

The work for which he is best known appeared in his first paper, ''Mathematics and Games'', first published in the Cambridge University Mathematical Society's magazine, ''[[Eureka (University of Cambridge magazine)|Eureka]]'' in 1939,&lt;ref&gt;Grundy [[#CITEREFGrundy1939|(1939)]].&lt;/ref&gt; and reprinted by the same magazine in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;Grundy [[#CITEREFGrundy1964|(1964)]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The main results of this paper were discovered independently by Grundy and by [[Roland Sprague]], and had already been published by the latter in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Sprague [[#CITEREFSprague1935|(1935)]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The key idea is that of a function which assigns a [[natural number|non-negative integer]] to each position of a class of combinatorial games, now called [[impartial games]], and which greatly assists in the identification of winning and losing positions, and of the winning moves from the former.  The number assigned to a position by this function is called its Grundy value (or Grundy number), and the function itself is called the Sprague–Grundy function, in honour of its co-discoverers.&lt;ref&gt;Almost any comprehensive treatment of combinatorial game theory will cover Sprague and Grundy's results in some form.  Examples are Berlekamp et al. ([[#CITEREFBerlekampConwayGuy1984|1984]]),  Conway ([https://books.google.com/books?id=tXiVo8qA5PQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Sprague%20Grundy&amp;f=false 1991]), Siegel ([https://books.google.com/books?id=VUVrAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Sprague%20Grundy&amp;f=false 2013]), and Smith ([https://books.google.com/books?id=tkaqCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Sprague%20Grundy&amp;f=false 2015]).&lt;/ref&gt;   The procedures developed by Sprague and Grundy for using their function to analyse impartial games are collectively called Sprague–Grundy theory, and at least two different  theorems concerning these procedures have been called Sprague–Grundy theorems.&lt;ref&gt;The theorem given that name by Smith ([[#CITEREFSmith2015|2015]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=tkaqCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA340 p.340]) is one which was in fact proved by Sprague and Grundy.  The one given that name by Siegel ([[#CITEREFSiegel2013|2013]],  [https://books.google.com/books?id=VUVrAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA478 478]) and [[Sprague–Grundy theorem|by Wikipedia]], however, relies on some later developments.  Although it is an almost  trivial consequence of Sprague and Grundy's results, which are also encapsulated in its statement and proof, it was not even formulated, let alone proved, by either of them.&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum number of colors used by a [[greedy coloring]] algorithm is called the [[Grundy number]], also after this work on games, as its definition has some formal similarities with the Sprague–Grundy theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

In 1939 Grundy began research in [[algebraic geometry]] as a research student at the [[University of Cambridge]], eventually specialising in the [[Ideal (ring theory)|theory of ideals]].  In 1941 he won a [[Smith's Prize]] for an essay entitled ''On the theory of [[Module (mathematics)#Formal definition|R-modules]]'', and his first research paper in the area, ''A generalisation of additive ideal theory'', was published in the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Grundy ([[#CITEREFGrundy1942|1942]]).&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1943 he was appointed to an assistant lectureship at the [[University of Hull|University College of Hull]], which he left in 1944.  He was awarded a Ph.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1945.

Shortly after the end of World War II, Grundy moved away from the field of algebra to take up work in statistics.   In 1947 he began formal training in the latter discipline at the [[Rothamsted Research|Rothamsted Experimental Station]] under a Ministry of Agriculture scholarship, graduating in 1949, when he then joined the permanent staff of the former organisation as an Experimental Officer.   In 1951 he was promoted to Senior Experimental Officer.  During his time at Rothamsted he performed most of his published statistical research, which included investigations of problems in the [[Design of experiments|design and analysis of experiments]], [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling]], composition of animal populations, and fitting [[truncated distribution]]s.

From 1954 to 1958 Grundy worked as a statistician at the National Institute for Educational Research.   During this period, he collaborated with [[Michael Healy (statistician)|Michael Healy]] and D.H. Rees to extend [[Frank Yates]]'s work on [[cost–benefit analysis]] of experimentation.   The results of this collaboration were reported in an influential paper, ''Economic choice of the amount of experimentation'', published in series B of the ''[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]]'' in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Grundy et al. ([[#CITEREFGrundyReesHealy1956|1956]])&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1958 Grundy moved to a position in the Biometry Unit at Oxford.  However, he retired from this position after only one term, due to ill health.

Early in 1959 Grundy married Hilary Taylor, a former colleague from the National Institute of Educational Research.   Although his health then greatly improved throughout 1959, he was unfortunately killed in an accident in November of that year.

In [[mathematics]], a '''projection''' is a mapping of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (or other [[mathematical structure]]) into  a subset (or sub-structure), which is equal to its square for [[function composition|mapping composition]] (or, in other words, which is [[idempotence|idempotent]]). The [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] to a subspace of a projection is also called a ''projection'', even if the idempotence property is lost.
An everyday example of a projection is the casting of shadows onto a plane (paper sheet).  The projection of a point is its shadow on the paper sheet. The shadow of a point on the paper sheet is this point itself (idempotence). The shadow of a three-dimensional sphere is a closed disk.  Originally, the notion of projection was introduced in [[Euclidean geometry]] to denote the projection of the [[Euclidean space]] of three dimensions onto a plane in it, like the shadow example. The two main projections of this kind are: 
* {{anchor|Central projection}}The '''projection from a point onto a plane''' or '''central projection''': If ''C'' is a point, called the '''center of projection''', then the projection of a point ''P'' different from ''C'' onto a plane that does not contain ''C'' is the intersection of the line ''CP'' with the plane. The points ''P'' such that the line ''CP'' is parallel to the plane do not have any image by the projection, but one often says that they project to a point at infinity of the plane (see [[projective geometry]] for a formalization of this terminology). The projection of the point ''C'' itself is not defined.
* The '''projection parallel to a direction D, onto a plane''' or '''[[parallel projection]]''': The image of a point ''P'' is the intersection with the plane of the line parallel to ''D'' passing through ''P''. See {{slink|Affine space|Projection}} for an accurate definition, generalized to any dimension.

The concept of '''projection''' in [[mathematics]] is a very old one, most likely having its roots in the phenomenon of the shadows cast by real world objects on the ground. This rudimentary idea was refined and abstracted, first in a geometric context and later in other branches of mathematics. Over time differing versions of the concept developed, but today, in a sufficiently abstract setting, we can unify these variations.

In [[cartography]], a [[map projection]] is a map of a part of the surface of the Earth onto a plane, which, in some cases, but not always, is the restriction of a projection in the above meaning. The [[3D projection]]s are also at the basis of the theory of [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]]. 

The need for unifying the two kinds of projections and of defining the image by a central projection of any point different of the center of projection are at the origin of [[projective geometry]]. However, a [[projective transformation]] is a [[bijection]] of a projective space, a property ''not'' shared with the ''projections'' of this article.

== Definition ==
[[File:Proj-map.svg|thumb|191x191px|The commutativity of this diagram is the universality of the projection π, for any map ''f'' and set X.]]
In an abstract setting we can generally say that a ''projection'' is a mapping of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] (or of a [[mathematical structure]]) which is [[idempotent]], which means that a projection is equal to its [[Function composition|composition]] with itself. A '''projection''' may also refer to a mapping which has a right inverse. Both notions are strongly related, as follows. Let ''p'' be an idempotent [[map (mathematics)|map]] from a set ''A'' into itself (thus ''p''∘''p'' = ''p'') and ''B'' = ''p''(''A'') be the image of ''p''. If we denote by π the map ''p'' viewed as a map from ''A'' onto ''B'' and by ''i'' the [[Injective function|injection]] of ''B'' into ''A'', then we have π.''i''= Id&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt;. Conversely, π.''i'' = Id&lt;sub&gt;''B''&lt;/sub&gt; implies that π∘''i'' is idempotent.

== Applications ==
The original notion of projection has been extended or generalized to various mathematical situations, frequently, but not always, related to geometry, for example:

* In [[set theory]]:
** An operation typified by the ''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; [[projection (set theory)|projection map]], written proj&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;, that takes an element '''x''' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;) of the [[cartesian product]] ''X''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; … &amp;times; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;times; … &amp;times; ''X''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; to the value proj&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;('''x''') = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&amp;nbsp;&lt;/sub&gt;.  This map is always [[surjective]].
** A mapping that takes an element to its [[equivalence class]] under a given [[equivalence relation]] is known as the '''{{visible anchor|canonical projection}}'''.
** The evaluation map sends a function ''f'' to the value ''f''(''x'') for a fixed ''x''.  The space of functions ''Y''&lt;sup&gt;''X''&lt;/sup&gt; can be identified with the cartesian product &lt;math&gt;\prod_{i\in X}Y_i&lt;/math&gt;, and the evaluation map is a projection map from the cartesian product.

* [[Relational database]]s and [[query language]]s, the [[Projection (relational algebra)|projection]] is a  [[unary operation]] written as &lt;math&gt;\Pi_{a_1, \ldots,a_n}( R )&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a_1,\ldots,a_n&lt;/math&gt; is a set of attribute names. The result of such projection is defined as the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] that is obtained when all [[tuple]]s in ''R'' are restricted to the set &lt;math&gt;\{a_1,\ldots,a_n\}&lt;/math&gt;.  ''R'' is a [[Relation (database)|database-relation]].

* In [[spherical geometry]], projection of a sphere upon a plane was used by [[Ptolemy]] (~150) in his [[Planisphaerium]]. The method is called [[stereographic projection]] and uses a plane tangent to a sphere and a ''pole'' C diametrically opposite the point of tangency.  Any point ''P'' on the sphere besides ''C'' determines a line ''CP'' intersecting the plane at the projected point for ''P''. The correspondence makes the sphere a [[one-point compactification]] for the plane when a [[point at infinity]] is included to correspond to ''C'', which otherwise has no projection on the plane. A common instance is the [[complex plane]] where the compactification corresponds to the [[Riemann sphere]]. Alternatively, a [[Sphere#Hemisphere|hemisphere]] is frequently projected onto a plane using the [[gnomonic projection]].

* In [[linear algebra]], a [[linear transformation]] that remains unchanged if applied twice (''p''(''u'') = ''p''(''p''(''u''))), in other words, an [[idempotent]] operator.  For example, the mapping that takes a point (''x'', ''y'', ''z'') in three dimensions to the point (''x'', ''y'', 0) in the plane is a projection. This type of projection naturally generalizes to any number of dimensions ''n'' for the source and ''k'' ≤ ''n'' for the target of the mapping.  See [[orthogonal projection]], [[projection (linear algebra)]].  In the case of orthogonal projections, the space admits a decomposition as a product, and the projection operator is a projection in that sense as well.

* In [[differential topology]], any [[fiber bundle]] includes a projection map as part of its definition.  Locally at least this map looks like a projection map in the sense of the product topology, and is therefore open and surjective.

* In [[topology]], a [[retract]] is a continuous map ''r'': ''X'' → ''X'' which restricts to the identity map on its image.  This satisfies a similar idempotency condition ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''r'' and can be considered a generalization of the projection map.  A retract which is [[homotopic]] to the identity is known as a [[deformation retract]].  This term is also used in category theory to refer to any split epimorphism.

* The [[scalar resolute|scalar projection]] (or resolute) of one [[vector (geometric)|vector]] onto another.

* In [[category theory]], the above notion of cartesian product of sets can be generalized to arbitrary [[category (mathematics)|categories]].  The [[product (category theory)|product]] of some objects has a '''canonical projection''' [[morphism]] to each factor.  This projection will take many forms in different categories.  The projection from the [[Cartesian product]] of [[set (mathematics)|sets]], the [[product topology]] of [[topological space]]s (which is always surjective and [[open map|open]]), or from the [[direct product of groups|direct product]] of [[group (mathematics)|groups]], etc.  Although these morphisms are often [[epimorphism]]s and even surjective, they do not have to be.

'''Proof-of-authority''' ('''PoA''') is an [[algorithm]] used with [[blockchain]]s that delivers comparatively fast transactions through a consensus mechanism based on identity as a stake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-blockchain-needs-proof-of-authority-instead-of-proof-of-stake|title=Why Blockchain Needs ‘Proof of Authority’ Instead of ‘Proof of Stake’|work=Cointelegraph|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proof-of-authority==
In PoA-based networks, transactions and blocks are validated by approved accounts, known as validators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=parity: Fast, light, robust Ethereum implementation|date=2017-12-12|url=https://github.com/paritytech/parity|publisher=Parity Technologies|accessdate=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Validators run software allowing them to put transactions in blocks. The process is automated and does not require validators to be constantly monitoring their computers. It, however, does require maintaining the computer (the authority [[node (networking)|node]]&lt;ref name="enuma-io"/&gt;) uncompromised. The term was coined by [[Gavin Wood]], co-founder of [[Ethereum]] and Parity Technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/ethereum/guide/blob/master/poa.md|title=PoA Private Chains|last=Gavin|first=Wood|date=November 2015|website=Github|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With PoA, individuals earn the right to become validators, so there is an incentive to retain the position that they have gained. By attaching a reputation to identity, validators are incentivized to uphold the transaction process, as they do not wish to have their identities attached to a negative reputation. This is considered more robust than PoS ([[proof-of-stake]]), as:
* In PoS, while a stake between two parties may be even, it does not take into account each party’s total holdings. This means that incentives can be unbalanced. 
* Meanwhile, PoW uses an enormous amount of computing power, which, in itself lowers incentive. It is also vulnerable to attack, as a potential attacker would only need to have 51% of the mining resources (hashrate) to control a network, although this is not easy to do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.coinfox.info/news/reviews/6417-proof-of-work-vs-proof-of-stake-merits-and-disadvantages|title=Proof-of-Work vs Proof-of-Stake: merits and disadvantages|last=superadmin|access-date=2017-12-12|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
On the other hand, PoA only allows non-consecutive block approval from any one validator, meaning that the risk of serious damage is centralized to the authority node.

PoA is suited for both private networks and public networks, like POA Network, where trust is distributed.&lt;ref name="enuma-io"/&gt;

'''Revolving rivers''' are a surprising, uncommon way of [[sand]] pile growth that can be found in a few sands around the world, but has been studied in detail only for one [[Cuba]]n sand from a place called Santa Teresa ([[Pinar del Rio]] province).

==Description==

When pouring "revolving" sand on a flat surface from a fixed position, the growth of a conical pile does not occur by the common [[avalanche]] mechanism, where sand slides down the pile in a more or less random fashion. What happens in that a relatively thin "river" of flowing sand travels from the pouring point at the apex of the pile to its base, while the rest of the sand at the surface is static. In addition, the river "revolves" around the pile either in clockwise or counter-clockwise directions (looking from top) depending on the initial conditions of the experiment. Actually the river constitutes the "cutting edge" of a layer of sand that deposits as a helix on the conical pile, and makes it grow.
For small sandpiles, rivers are continuous, but they become intermittent
for larger piles.

== History and state of the art ==

The phenomenon was observed first by E. Altshuler at the [[University of Havana]] in 1995, but at the time he assumed that it was well known, and temporarily forgot about it. In 2000, being at the [[University of Houston]], he told K. E. Bassler, who showed a vivid interest in the matter. Embarrassingly enough, Altshuler was unable to demonstrate it before Bassler using a random sand from Houston, so he had to send him a video from [[Cuba]] after his return to the island.

Once the existence of the strange phenomenon was confirmed for everyone, E. Altshuler and a number of collaborators performed a systematic study in [[Havana]], which was then jointly published with Bassler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Altshuler E.|display-authors=etal|title=
Sandpile formation by revolving rivers|journal=Physical Review Letters| date=2003 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.91.014501|pmid=12906542|bibcode=2003PhRvL..91a4501A|volume=91|issue=1|pages=014501|arxiv=cond-mat/0206493}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further work has been done to understand in more detail the
phenomenon,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Altshuler E.|display-authors=etal|title=

However, the connection between the physical, chemical (and possibly biological) properties of the grains in a specific sand, the nature of the inter-grain interactions, and the emergence of the revolving rivers is still an open question.

Sand from Santa Teresa is made of almost pure [[silicon dioxide]] grains with an average [[grain size]] of 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm approximately and no visible special features regarding grain shape. But in spite of its apparent simplicity, many puzzles still remain. For example, after many experiments one batch of sand may stop showing revolving rivers (just as [[singing sand]] eventually stops singing), which suggests that the decay is connected to certain properties of the surface of the grains that degrade by continued friction.

Videos of the effect are available on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=YouTubeRiosEng| author=Complexperiments |date=2010 |

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3525">In [[mathematics]], the '''Riesz rearrangement inequality''' (sometimes called '''Riesz-Sobolev''' inequality) states that for any three non-negative functions &lt;math&gt;f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;\iint_{\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^n} f(x) g(x-y) h(y) \, dx\,dy
\le \iint_{\mathbb{R}^n\times \mathbb{R}^n} f^*(x) g^*(x-y) h^*(y) \, dx\,dy,
&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;f^* : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g^* : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h^* : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^+&lt;/math&gt; are the [[symmetric decreasing rearrangement]]s of the functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; respectively.

== History ==
The inequality was first proved by [[Frigyes Riesz]] in 1930,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Riesz |first=Frigyes |authorlink=Frigyes Riesz|year=1930|title=Sur une inégalité intégrale|periodical=[[Journal of the London Mathematical Society]]|volume=5|pages=162–168|doi=10.1112/jlms/s1-5.3.162|mr=1574064}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
and independently reproved by S.L.Sobolev in 1938. It can be generalized to arbitrarily (but finitely) many functions acting on arbitrarily many variables.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Brascamp|first1=H.J.|last2=Lieb|first2=Elliott H.|author-link2=Elliott H.

== Applications ==
The Riesz rearrangement inequality can be used to prove the [[Pólya–Szegő inequality]].

== Proofs ==

=== One-dimensional case ===

In the one-dimensional case, the inequality is first proved when the functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; are [[characteristic functions]] of a finite unions of intervals. Then the inequality can be extended to characteristic functions of measurable sets, to measurable functions taking a finite number of values and finally to nonnegative measurable functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=G. H. |last1=Hardy|authorlink1=G. H. Hardy |last2=Littlewood|first2=J. E.|authorlink2=J. E. Littlewood|last3=Polya|first3=G.|authorlink3=G. Polya|title=Inequalities|year=1952 |publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-35880-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Higher-dimensional case===

In order to pass from the one-dimensional case to the higher-dimensional case, the spherical rearrangement is approximated by Steiner symmetrization for which the one-dimensional argument applies directly by Fubini's theorem.&lt;ref&gt;

== Equality cases ==
In the case where any one of the three functions is a strictly symmetric-decreasing function, equality holds only when the other two functions are equal, up to translation, to their symmetric-decreasing rearrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burchard|first=Almut|date=|year=1996|title=Cases of Equality in the Riesz Rearrangement Inequality|jstor=2118534|journal=Annals of Mathematics|volume=143|issue=3|pages=499–527|doi=10.2307/2118534}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4819">There are several well-known theorems in [[functional analysis]] known as the '''Riesz representation theorem'''. They are named in honor of [[Frigyes Riesz]].

This article will describe his theorem concerning the dual of a [[Hilbert space]], which is sometimes called the Fréchet–Riesz theorem. For the theorems relating [[Linear functional|linear functionals]] to [[Measure (mathematics)|measures]], see [[Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem]].

== The Hilbert space representation theorem ==
This theorem establishes an important connection between a [[Hilbert space]] and its [[continuous dual space]]. If the underlying [[Field (mathematics)|field]] is the [[real number]]s, the two are [[isometry|isometrically]] [[isomorphism|isomorphic]]; if the underlying field is the [[complex number]]s, the two are isometrically [[anti-isomorphic]]. The (anti-) [[isomorphism]] is a particular [[Natural transformation|natural]] one as will be described next; a [[natural isomorphism]].

Let ''H'' be a Hilbert space, and let ''H*'' denote its dual space, consisting of all [[continuous linear functional]]s from ''H'' into the field &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is an element of ''H'', then the function &lt;math&gt;\varphi_x, &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; in ''H'' defined by:

&lt;math&gt;\varphi_x(y) = \left\langle y , x \right\rangle,   &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[inner product]] of the Hilbert space, is an element of ''H*''. The Riesz representation theorem states that ''every'' element of ''H*'' can be written uniquely in this form. Given any continuous linear functional ''g'' in ''H*'', the corresponding element &lt;math&gt;x_g \in H&lt;/math&gt;  can be constructed uniquely by &lt;math&gt;x_g = g(e_1)e_1 + g(e_2)e_2 + ...&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\{e_i\}&lt;/math&gt; is an [[orthonormal basis]] of ''H'', and the value of &lt;math&gt;x_g&lt;/math&gt; does not vary by choice of basis. Thus, if &lt;math&gt;y \in H, y = a_1 e_1 + a_2 e_2 + ...&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;g(y) = a_1g(e_1) + a_2g(e_2) + ... = \langle x_g, y\rangle. &lt;/math&gt; 

'''Theorem'''. The mapping &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;: ''H'' → ''H*'' defined by &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\varphi_x&lt;/math&gt; is an isometric (anti-) isomorphism, meaning that:
* &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is [[bijective]].
* The [[Norm (mathematics)|norms]] of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varphi_x&lt;/math&gt; agree: &lt;math&gt;\Vert x \Vert = \Vert\Phi(x)\Vert&lt;/math&gt;.
* &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is [[Additive map|additive]]: &lt;math&gt;\Phi( x_1 + x_2 ) = \Phi( x_1 ) + \Phi( x_2 )&lt;/math&gt;.
* If the base field is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\lambda x) = \lambda \Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all real numbers λ.
* If the base field is &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\Phi(\lambda x) = \bar{\lambda} \Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all complex numbers λ, where &lt;math&gt;\bar{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt; denotes the [[complex conjugation]] of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[Inverse operator|inverse map]] of &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; can be described as follows. Given a non-zero element &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; of ''H*'', the [[orthogonal complement]] of the [[Kernel (linear algebra)|kernel]] of &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is a one-dimensional subspace of ''H''. Take a non-zero element ''z'' in that subspace, and set &lt;math&gt;x = \overline{\varphi(z)} \cdot z /{\left\Vert z \right\Vert}^2&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\Phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.

Historically, the theorem is often attributed simultaneously to [[Frigyes Riesz|Riesz]] and [[Maurice René Fréchet|Fréchet]] in 1907 (see references).

In the mathematical treatment of [[quantum mechanics]], the theorem can be seen as a justification for the popular [[bra–ket notation]]. The theorem says that, every bra &lt;math&gt;\langle\psi|&lt;/math&gt; has a corresponding ket &lt;math&gt;|\psi\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, and the latter is unique.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5118">The '''skew binary number system''' is a [[Non-standard positional numeral systems|non-standard positional numeral system]] in which the ''n''th digit contributes a value of &lt;math&gt;2^{n+1} - 1&lt;/math&gt; times the digit (digits are indexed from 0) instead of &lt;math&gt;2^{n}&lt;/math&gt; times as they do in [[binary number|binary]].  Each digit has a value of 0, 1, or 2. Notice that a number can have many skew binary representations. For example, a decimal number 15 can be written as 1000, 201 and 122. Each number can be written uniquely in skew binary canonical form where there is only '''at most''' one instance of the digit 2, which must be the first non-zero '''[[Least significant bit|least significant digit]]'''. In this case 15 is written canonically as 1000.

==Arithmetical operations==
The advantage of skew binary is that each increment operation can be done with at most one [[Carry (arithmetic)|carry]] operation. This exploits the fact that &lt;math&gt;2 (2^{n+1} - 1) + 1 = 2^{n+2} - 1 &lt;/math&gt;. Incrementing a skew binary number is done by setting the only two to a zero and incrementing the next digit from zero to one or one to two.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/2004/IntroFuncProg/lecture08.html skew binary numbers]&lt;/ref&gt; 
When numbers are represented using a form of [[run-length encoding]] as linked lists of the non-zero digits, a form called the [[sparse representation of a number|sparse representations of numbers]] by Okasaki,&lt;ref name="Okasaki" /&gt; incrementation and decrementation can be performed in constant time.

Other arithmetic operations are performed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elmasry|first1=Amr|last2=Jensen|first2=Claus|last3=Katajainen|first3=Jyrki|title=Two Skew-Binary Numeral Systems and One Application|journal=Theory of Computing Systems|date=2012|volume=50|pages=185–211|doi=10.1007/s00224-011-9357-0|url=http://www.cphstl.dk/Paper/TOCS-2011/journal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; by switching between the skew binary representation and the binary representation.

===From skew binary representation to binary representation===
Given a skew binary number, its value can be computed by a loop, computing the successive values of &lt;math&gt;2^{n+1}-1&lt;/math&gt; and adding it once or twice for each &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th digit is 1 or 2 respectively. A more efficient method is now given, with only bit representation and one substraction.

The skew binary number of the form &lt;math&gt;b_0\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; without 2 and with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; 1s is equal to the binary number &lt;math&gt;0b_0\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; minus &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;d^{c}&lt;/math&gt; represents the digit &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; repeated &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; times. The skew binary number of the form &lt;math&gt;0^{c_0}21^{c_1}0b_0\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; 1s is equal to the binary number &lt;math&gt;0^{c_0+c_1+2}1b_0\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; minus &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;.

===From binary representation to skew binary representation===
Similarly to the preceding section, the binary number &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; of the form &lt;math&gt;b_0\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; 1s equals the skew binary number &lt;math&gt;b_1\dots b_n&lt;/math&gt; plus &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. Note that since addition is not defined, adding &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to incrementing the number &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; times. However, &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is bounded by the logarithm of &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; and incrementation takes constant time. Hence transforming a binary number into a skew binary number runs in time linear in the length of the number.

==Applications==
Skew binary numbers find applications in [[skew binomial heap]]s, a variant of [[binomial heap]]s that support worst-case O(1) insertion, and in [[skew binary random access lists]], a [[purely functional data structure]].  They also find use in [[Brodal queue|bootstrapped skew binomial heaps]], which have excellent asymptotic guarantees.&lt;ref name="Okasaki"&gt;Okasaki, Chris. ''Purely Functional Data Structures.''&lt;/ref&gt;

If [[smoothsort]] is implemented using [[perfect binary tree]]s (rather than the more common Leonardo trees), the heap is divided into trees which correspond to the digits of the skew binary representation of the heap size.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22280">'''Solution of triangles''' ({{lang-lat|solutio triangulorum}}) is the main [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] problem of finding the characteristics of a [[triangle]] (angles and lengths of sides), when some of these are known. The triangle can be located on a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]] or on a [[sphere]]. Applications requiring triangle solutions include [[geodesy]], [[astronomy]], [[construction]], and [[navigation]].

== Solving plane triangles ==
[[File:Triangle - angles, vertices, sides.svg|thumb|220px|right|&lt;center&gt;Standard notation for a triangle&lt;/center&gt;]]
A general form triangle has six main characteristics (see picture): three linear (side lengths {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}}) and three angular ({{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ''}}). The classical plane trigonometry problem is to specify three of the six characteristics and  determine the other three.  A triangle can be uniquely determined in this sense when given any of the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-solving-triangles.html | title=Solving Triangles | publisher=Maths is Fun | accessdate=4 April 2012&lt;!-- 6:37 (UTC)--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.horacemann.org/academics/math/pcbch/trig/triangle.html | title=Solving Triangles | publisher=web.horacemann.org | accessdate=4 April 2012&lt;!-- 6:42 (UTC)--&gt; | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107224746/http://web.horacemann.org/academics/math/pcbch/trig/triangle.html | archivedate=7 January 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Three sides ('''SSS''')
* Two sides and the included angle ('''SAS''')
* Two sides and an angle not included between them ('''SSA'''), if the side length adjacent to the angle is shorter than the other side length.  
* A side and the two angles adjacent to it ('''ASA''')
* A side, the angle opposite to it and an angle adjacent to it ('''AAS''').
* Three angles ('''AAA''') on the sphere (but not in the plane).

For all cases in the plane, at least one of the side lengths must be specified. If only the angles are given, the side lengths cannot be determined, because any [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] triangle is a solution.

=== Trigonomic relations ===
[[File:Beliebiges Dreieck cen.png|thumb|upright=2.0|Overview of particular steps and tools used when solving plane triangles]]
The standard method of solving the problem is to use fundamental relations.
; [[Law of cosines]]:
: &lt;math&gt; a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2 b c \cos \alpha &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2 a c \cos \beta &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2 a b \cos \gamma &lt;/math&gt;
; [[Law of sines]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a}{\sin\alpha} = \frac{b}{\sin\beta} = \frac{c}{\sin\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;
; [[Triangle|Sum of angles]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta + \gamma = 180^\circ &lt;/math&gt;
; [[Law of tangents]]
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{a-b}{a+b} = \frac{\tan[\frac{1}{2}(\alpha-\beta)]}{\tan[\frac 1 2 (\alpha+\beta)]}.&lt;/math&gt;
There are other (sometimes practically useful) universal relations: the [[law of cotangents]] and [[Mollweide's formula]].

==== Notes ====
# To find an unknown angle, the [[law of cosines]] is safer than the [[law of sines]]. The reason is that the value of [[sine]] for the angle of the triangle does not uniquely determine this angle. For example, if {{math|sin ''β'' {{=}} 0.5}}, the angle {{math|''β''}} can equal either 30° or 150°. Using the law of cosines avoids this problem: within the interval from 0° to 180° the cosine value unambiguously determines its angle. On the other hand, if the angle is small (or close to 180°), then it is more robust numerically to determine it from its sine than its cosine because the arc-cosine function has a divergent derivative at 1 (or −1).
# We assume that the relative position of specified characteristics is known. If not, the mirror reflection of the triangle will also be a solution. For example, three side lengths uniquely define either a triangle or its reflection.

=== Three sides given (SSS) ===
[[File:resolve triangle with a b c.png|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Three sides given&lt;/center&gt;]]

Let three side lengths {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} be specified. To find the angles {{math|''α'', ''β''}}, the [[law of cosines]] can be used:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-solving-sss-triangles.html |title=Solving SSS Triangles |publisher=Maths is Fun |accessdate=13 January 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\alpha &amp; = \arccos \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2} {2 b c} \\[4pt]
\beta &amp; = \arccos \frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2} {2 a c}.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then angle {{math|''γ'' {{=}} 180° − ''α'' − ''β''}}.

Some sources recommend to find angle {{math|''β''}} from the [[law of sines]] but (as Note 1 above states) there is a risk of confusing an acute angle value with an obtuse one.

Another method of calculating the angles from known sides is to apply the [[law of cotangents]].

=== Two sides and the included angle given (SAS) ===
[[File:resolve triangle with a b gamma.png|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Two sides and the included angle given&lt;/center&gt;]]

Here the lengths of sides {{math|''a'', ''b''}} and the angle {{math|''γ''}} between these sides are known. The third side can be determined from the law of cosines:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-solving-sas-triangles.html |title=Solving SAS Triangles |publisher=Maths is Fun |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c = \sqrt{a^2+b^2-2ab\cos\gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;
Now we use law of cosines to find the second angle:
: &lt;math&gt; \alpha =  \arccos \frac{b^2 + c^2 - a^2} {2 b c}.&lt;/math&gt;
Finally, {{math|''β'' {{=}} 180° − ''α'' − ''γ''}}.

=== Two sides and non-included angle given (SSA) ===
[[File:resolve triangle with b c beta.png|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Two sides and a non-included angle given&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Resolve triangle with b c beta 2 solutions.png|thumb|250px|&lt;center&gt;Two solutions for the triangle&lt;/center&gt;]] 

This case is not solvable in all cases; a solution is guaranteed to be unique only if the side length adjacent to the angle is shorter than the other side length.  Assume that two sides {{math|''b'', ''c''}} and the angle {{math|''β''}} are known. The equation for the angle {{math|''γ''}} can be implied  from the [[law of sines]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-solving-ssa-triangles.html | title=Solving SSA Triangles | publisher=Maths is Fun | accessdate=9 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sin\gamma = \frac c b \sin\beta.&lt;/math&gt;
We denote further {{math|''D'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''c''|''b''}} sin ''β''}} (the equation's right side). There are four possible cases:
# If {{math|''D'' &gt; 1}}, no such triangle exists because the side {{math|''b''}} does not reach line {{math|''BC''}}. For the same reason a solution does not exist if the angle {{math|''β'' ≥ 90°}} and {{math|''b'' ≤ ''c''}}.
# If {{math|''D'' {{=}} 1}}, a unique solution exists: {{math|''γ'' {{=}} 90°}}, i.e., the triangle is [[Right triangle|right-angled]]. 
#  If {{math|''D'' &lt; 1}} two alternatives are possible.
## If {{math|''b'' ≥ ''c''}}, then {{math|''β'' ≥ ''γ''}} (the larger side corresponds to a larger angle). Since no triangle can have two obtuse angles, {{math|''γ''}} is an acute angle and the solution {{math|''γ'' {{=}} arcsin ''D''}} is unique.
## If {{math|''b'' &lt; ''c''}}, the angle {{math|''γ''}} may be acute: {{math|''γ'' {{=}} arcsin ''D''}} or obtuse: {{math|''γ′'' {{=}} 180° - ''γ''}}. The figure on right shows the point {{math|''C''}}, the side {{math|''b''}} and the angle {{math|''γ''}} as the first solution, and the point {{math|''C′''}}, side {{math|''b′''}} and the angle {{math|''γ′''}} as the second solution.

Once {{math|''γ''}} is obtained, the third angle {{math|''α'' {{=}} 180° − ''β'' − ''γ''}}.

The third side can then be found from the law of sines:
: &lt;math&gt;a = b\ \frac{\sin\alpha}{\sin\beta}&lt;/math&gt;

or
: &lt;math&gt;a = c\cos\beta \pm  \sqrt{b^2 -c^2\sin^2\beta} &lt;/math&gt;

=== A side and two adjacent angles given (ASA) ===
[[File:resolve triangle with c alpha beta.png|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;One side and two adjacent angles given&lt;/center&gt;]]

The known characteristics are the side  {{math|''c''}} and the angles {{math|''α'', ''β''}}. The third angle {{math|''γ'' {{=}} 180° − ''α'' − ''β''}}.

Two unknown sides can be calculated from the law of sines:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mathsisfun.com/algebra/trig-solving-asa-triangles.html |title=Solving ASA Triangles |publisher=Maths is Fun |accessdate=13 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;a = c\ \frac{\sin\alpha}{\sin\gamma}; \quad b = c\ \frac{\sin\beta}{\sin\gamma}.&lt;/math&gt;

or 

: &lt;math&gt;a = c \frac{\sin\alpha}{\sin\alpha \cos \beta +\sin\beta \cos \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;b = c \frac{\sin\beta}{\sin\alpha \cos \beta +\sin\beta \cos \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

=== A side, one adjacent angle and the opposite angle given (AAS) ===
The procedure for solving an AAS triangle is same as that for an ASA triangle: First, find the third angle by using the angle sum property of a triangle, then find the other two sides using the [[law of sines]].

== Solving spherical triangles ==
[[File:Spherical triangle 3d opti.png|thumb|250 px|right|&lt;center&gt;Spherical triangle&lt;/center&gt;]]

The general [[spherical triangle]] is fully determined by three of its six characteristics (3 sides and 3 angles). Note that the sides {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} of a spherical triangle are measured by angular rather than linear units, based on the corresponding [[central angle]]s.

The solution of triangles for [[Non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]] [[spherical geometry]] has some differences from the planar case. For example, the sum of the three angles {{math|''α'' + ''β'' + ''γ''}} depends on the triangle. In addition, there are no unequal [[Similarity (geometry)|similar triangles]], and so the problem of constructing a triangle with specified three angles has a unique solution. The basic relations used to solve a problem are similar to those of the planar case: see [[Law of cosines (spherical)]] and [[Law of sines#Spherical case|Law of sines (spherical)]].

Among other relationships that may be useful are the [[half-side formula]] and [[Napier's analogies]]:&lt;ref&gt;[http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NapiersAnalogies.html Napier's Analogies] at MathWorld&lt;/ref&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\tan\frac c 2 \cos\frac{\alpha-\beta} 2  = \tan\frac{a+b}{2} \cos\frac{\alpha+\beta}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\tan\frac c 2 \sin\frac{\alpha-\beta} 2  = \tan\frac{a-b} 2  \sin\frac{\alpha+\beta} 2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\cot\frac{\gamma} 2 \cos\frac{a-b}{2} = \tan\frac{\alpha+\beta} 2 \cos\frac{a+b} 2&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\cot\frac{\gamma} 2 \sin\frac{a-b}{2} = \tan\frac{\alpha-\beta} 2 \sin\frac{a+b} 2.&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Solve spherical triangle with a b c.png|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Three sides given&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Three sides given (spherical SSS) ===
Known: the sides {{math|''a'', ''b'', ''c''}} (in angular units). The triangle's angles are computed from [[law of cosines (spherical)|the spherical law of cosines]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \arccos\left(\frac{\cos a-\cos b\ \cos c}{\sin b\ \sin c}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\beta  = \arccos\left(\frac{\cos b-\cos c\ \cos a}{\sin c\ \sin a}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \arccos\left(\frac{\cos c-\cos a\ \cos b}{\sin a\ \sin b}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
{{clear}}

[[File:Solve spherical triangle with a b gamma.png|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Two sides and the included angle given&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Two sides and the included angle given (spherical SAS) ===
Known: the sides {{math|''a'', ''b''}} and the angle {{math|''γ''}} between them. The side {{math|''c''}} can be found from the law of cosines:

: &lt;math&gt;c = \arccos \left(\cos a\cos b + \sin a\sin b\cos\gamma \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The angles {{math|''α', ''β''}} can be calculated as above, or by using Napier's analogies:

: &lt;math&gt;\alpha = \arctan\ \frac{2\sin a}{\tan(\frac{\gamma}{2}) \sin (b+a) + \cot(\frac{\gamma}{2})\sin(b-a)},&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\beta = \arctan\ \frac{2\sin b}{\tan(\frac{\gamma}{2}) \sin (a+b) + \cot(\frac{\gamma}{2})\sin(a-b) }.&lt;/math&gt;

This problem arises in the [[Great-circle navigation#Course and distance|navigation problem]] of finding the great circle between two points on the earth specified by their latitude and longitude; in this application, it is important to use formulas which are not susceptible to round-off errors.  For this purpose, the following formulas (which may be derived using vector algebra) can be used:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
c &amp;= \arctan\frac
{\sqrt{(\sin a\cos b - \cos a \sin b \cos \gamma)^2 + (\sin b\sin\gamma)^2}}
{\cos a \cos b + \sin a\sin b\cos\gamma},\\
\alpha &amp;= \arctan\frac
{\sin a\sin\gamma}
{\sin b\cos a - \cos b\sin a\cos\gamma},\\
\beta &amp;= \arctan\frac
{\sin b\sin\gamma}
{\sin a\cos b - \cos a\sin b\cos\gamma},
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where the signs of the numerators and denominators in these expressions should be used to determine the quadrant of the arctangent.

[[File:Solve spherical triangle with b c beta.png|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Two sides and a non-included angle given&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Two sides and non-included angle given (spherical SSA) ===
This problem is not solvable in all cases; a solution is guaranteed to be unique only if the side length adjacent to the angle is shorter than the other side length.  Known: the sides {{math|''b'', ''c''}} and the angle {{math|''β''}} not between them. A solution exists if the following condition holds:
: &lt;math&gt;b &gt; \arcsin (\sin c\,\sin\beta).&lt;/math&gt;
The angle {{math|''γ''}} can be found from the [[Law of sines#Spherical case|spherical law of sines]]:
: &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \arcsin \left(\frac{\sin c\,\sin\beta}{\sin b}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
As for the plane case, if {{math|''b'' &lt; ''c''}} then there are two solutions: {{math|''γ''}} and {{math|180° - ''γ''}}.

We can find other characteristics by using Napier's analogies:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a &amp; = 2\arctan \left[ \tan\left(\tfrac12(b-c)\right) \frac{\sin \left(\tfrac12(\beta+\gamma)\right)}{\sin\left(\tfrac12(\beta-\gamma)\right)} \right], \\[4pt]
\alpha &amp; = 2\arccot \left[\tan\left(\tfrac12(\beta-\gamma)\right) \frac{\sin \left(\tfrac12(b+c)\right)}{\sin \left(\tfrac12(b-c)\right)} \right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Solve spherical triangle with c alpha beta.png|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;One side and two adjacent angles given&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== A side and two adjacent angles given (spherical ASA) ===
Known: the side {{math|''c''}} and the angles {{math|''α'', ''β''}}. First we determine the angle {{math|''γ''}} using the [[Law of cosines (spherical)|law of cosines]]:

: &lt;math&gt;\gamma = \arccos(\sin\alpha\sin\beta\cos c -\cos\alpha\cos\beta).\,&lt;/math&gt;

We can find the two unknown sides from the law of cosines (using the calculated angle {{math|''γ''}}):

: &lt;math&gt;a=\arccos\left(\frac{\cos\alpha+\cos\beta\cos\gamma}{\sin\beta\sin\gamma}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;b=\arccos\left(\frac{\cos\beta+\cos\gamma\cos\alpha}{\sin\gamma\sin\alpha}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

or by using Napier's analogies:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
a &amp; = \arctan\left[\frac{2\sin\alpha}{\cot(\frac c 2) \sin(\beta+\alpha) + \tan(\frac c 2) \sin(\beta-\alpha)}\right], \\[4pt]
b &amp; = \arctan\left[\frac{2\sin\beta} {\cot(\frac c 2) \sin(\alpha+\beta) + \tan(\frac c 2)\sin(\alpha-\beta)}\right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
{{clear}}

[[File:Solve spherical triangle with a alpha beta.png|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;One side, one adjacent angle and the opposite angle given&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== A side, one adjacent angle and the opposite angle given (spherical AAS) ===
Known: the side {{math|''a''}} and the angles {{math|''α'', ''β''}}. The side {{math|''b''}} can be found from the [[Law of sines#Spherical case|law of sines]]:

: &lt;math&gt;b = \arcsin \left( \frac{\sin a\,\sin \beta}{\sin \alpha} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

If the angle for the side {{math|''a''}} is acute and {{math|''α'' &gt; ''β''}}, another solution exists:

: &lt;math&gt;b = \pi - \arcsin \left( \frac{\sin a\,\sin \beta}{\sin \alpha} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

We can find other characteristics by using Napier's analogies:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
c &amp; = 2\arctan \left[ \tan\left(\tfrac12(a-b)\right) \frac{\sin\left(\tfrac12(\alpha+\beta)\right)}{\sin\left(\frac12(\alpha-\beta)\right)}\right], \\[4pt]
\gamma &amp; = 2\arccot \left[\tan\left(\tfrac12(\alpha-\beta)\right) \frac{\sin \left(\tfrac12(a+b)\right)}{\sin \left(\frac12(a-b)\right)} \right].
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
{{clear}}

[[File:Solve spherical triangle with alpha beta gamma.png|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Three angles given&lt;/center&gt;]]

=== Three angles given (spherical AAA) ===
Known: the angles {{math|''α'', ''β'', ''γ''}}. From the [[Law of cosines (spherical)|law of cosines]] we infer:
: &lt;math&gt;a=\arccos\left(\frac{\cos\alpha+\cos\beta\cos\gamma}{\sin\beta\sin\gamma}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;b=\arccos\left(\frac{\cos\beta+\cos\gamma\cos\alpha}{\sin\gamma\sin\alpha}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;c=\arccos\left(\frac{\cos\gamma+\cos\alpha\cos\beta}{\sin\alpha\sin\beta}\right).&lt;/math&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Solving right-angled spherical triangles ===
The above algorithms become much simpler if one of the angles of a triangle (for example, the angle {{math|''C''}}) is the right angle. Such a spherical triangle is fully defined by its two elements, and the other three can be calculated using [[Spherical trigonometry#Napier's Pentagon|Napier's Pentagon]] or the following relations.
: &lt;math&gt;\sin a = \sin c \cdot \sin A&lt;/math&gt; (from the [[Law of sines#Spherical case|Law of sines (spherical)]])
: &lt;math&gt;\tan a = \sin b \cdot \tan A&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\cos c = \cos a \cdot \cos b&lt;/math&gt; (from the [[law of cosines (spherical)]])
: &lt;math&gt;\tan b = \tan c \cdot \cos A&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\cos A = \cos a \cdot \sin B&lt;/math&gt; (also from the law of cosines)
: &lt;math&gt;\cos c = \cot A \cdot \cot B&lt;/math&gt;

== Some applications ==

=== Triangulation ===
[[File:distance by triangulation.svg|thumb|right|320px|&lt;center&gt;Distance measurement by [[triangulation]]&lt;/center&gt;]]
  {{main|Triangulation}}
If one wants to measure the distance {{math|''d''}} from shore to a remote ship via triangulation, one marks on the shore two points with known distance {{math|''l''}} between them (the baseline). Let {{math|''α'', ''β''}} be the angles between the baseline and the direction to the ship.

From the formulae above (ASA case) one can compute the distance as the [[altitude (triangle)|triangle height]]:

: &lt;math&gt;d = \frac{\sin\alpha\,\sin\beta}{\sin(\alpha+\beta)} \ell = \frac{\tan\alpha\,\tan\beta}{\tan\alpha+\tan\beta} \ell.&lt;/math&gt;

This method is used in [[cabotage]]. The angles {{math|''α'', ''β''}} are defined  by observation of familiar landmarks from the ship.
{{clear}}
[[File:mountain height by triangulation.svg|thumb|right|320px|&lt;center&gt;How to measure a mountain's height&lt;/center&gt;]]
As another example, if one wants to measure the height {{math|''h''}} of a mountain or a high building, the angles {{math|''α'', ''β''}} from two ground points to the top are specified. Let {{math|''ℓ''}} be the distance between these points. From the same ASA case formulas we obtain:

: &lt;math&gt; h = \frac{\sin\alpha\,\sin\beta}{\sin(\beta-\alpha)} \ell = \frac{\tan\alpha\,\tan\beta}{\tan\beta-\tan\alpha} \ell.&lt;/math&gt;

=== The distance between two points on the globe ===
{{Main|Great-circle distance}}

[[File:distance on earth.png|224px|right]]
To calculate the distance between two points on the globe,
: Point A: latitude {{math|''λ{{sub|A}}''}}, longitude {{math|''L{{sub|A}}''}}, and
: Point B: latitude {{math|''λ{{sub|B}}''}}, longitude {{math|''L{{sub|B}}''}}
we consider the spherical triangle {{math|''ABC''}}, where {{math|''C''}} is the North Pole. Some characteristics are:
: &lt;math&gt;a = 90^\mathrm{o} - \lambda_\mathrm{B}, \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;b = 90^\mathrm{o} - \lambda_\mathrm{A}, \,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\gamma = L_\mathrm{A}-L_\mathrm{B}. \,&lt;/math&gt;
If [[#Two sides and the included angle given|two sides and the included angle given]], we obtain from the formulas
: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{AB} = R \arccos\left[\sin \lambda_\mathrm{A} \,\sin \lambda_\mathrm{B} + \cos \lambda_\mathrm{A} \,\cos \lambda_\mathrm{B} \,\cos \left(L_\mathrm{A}-L_\mathrm{B}\right)\right].&lt;/math&gt;
Here {{math|''R''}} is the [[Earth|Earth's radius]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5808">'''Typographical Number Theory''' ('''TNT''') is a formal [[axiom]]atic system describing the [[natural numbers]] that appears in [[Douglas Hofstadter]]'s book ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]''.  It is an implementation of [[Peano arithmetic]] that Hofstadter uses to help explain [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]].

Like any system implementing the Peano axioms, TNT is capable of referring to itself (it is [[self-referential]]).

== Numerals ==

TNT does not use a distinct symbol for each [[natural number]]. Instead it makes use of a simple, uniform way of giving a compound symbol to each natural number:

:{| 
| zero
| align=right | '''0'''
|-
| one
| align=right | '''S0'''
|-
| two
| align=right | '''SS0'''
|-
| three
| align=right | '''SSS0'''
|-
| four
| align=right | '''SSSS0'''
|-
| five
| align=right | '''SSSSS0'''
|}

The symbol '''S''' can be interpreted as "the successor of", or "the number after". Since this is, however, a number theory, such interpretations are useful, but not strict. It cannot be said that because four is the successor of three that four is '''SSSS0''', but rather that since three is the successor of two, which is the successor of one, which is the successor of zero, which has been described as '''0''', four can be "proved" to be '''SSSS0'''. TNT is designed such that everything must be proven before it can be said to be true.

== Variables ==
In order to refer to unspecified terms, TNT makes use of five [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. These are
: a, b, c, d, e.
More variables can be constructed by adding the [[prime (symbol)|prime symbol]] after them; for example,
:a&amp;#8242;, b&amp;#8242;, c&amp;#8242;, a&amp;#8243;, a&amp;#8244; are all variables.

In the more rigid version of TNT, known as "austere" TNT, only
:a&amp;#8242;, a&amp;#8243;, a&amp;#8244; etc. are used.

== Operators ==
=== Addition and multiplication of numerals ===
In Typographical Number Theory, the usual symbols of "+" for additions, and "·" for multiplications are used. Thus to write "b plus c" is to write

: (b&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;c)

and "a times d" is written as

:(a·d)

The parentheses are required. Any laxness would violate TNT's formation system (although it is trivially proved this formalism is unnecessary for operations which are both commutative and associative). Also only two terms can be operated on at once. Therefore, to write "a plus b plus c" is to write either

:((a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;b)&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;c)

or

:(a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;(b&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;c))

=== Equivalency ===
The "Equals" operator is used to denote equivalence. It is defined by the symbol "=", and takes roughly the same meaning as it usually does in mathematics. For instance,
:'''(SSS0'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''SSS0)'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''SSSSSS0'''
is a theorem statement in TNT, with the interpretation "3 plus 3 equals&amp;nbsp;6".

=== Negation ===
In Typographical Number Theory, [[negation]], i.e. the turning of a statement to its opposite, is denoted by the "~" or negation operator. For instance,

:~('''SSS0'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''SSS0''')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''SSSSSSS0'''

is a theorem in TNT, interpreted as "3 plus 3 is not equal to&amp;nbsp;7".

By negation, this means negation in [[Boolean logic]] ([[logical negation]]), rather than simply being the opposite.  For example, if I were to say "I am eating a grapefruit", the opposite is "I am not eating a grapefruit", rather than "I am eating something other than a grapefruit". Similarly "The Television is on" is negated to "The Television is not on", rather than "The Television is off". This is a subtle difference, but an important one.

== Compounds ==
If x and y are well-formed formulas, and provided that no variable which is free in one is quantified in the other, then the following are all well-formed formulas

: &lt; x∧y &gt;, &lt;x∨y&gt;, &lt;x⊃y&gt;  

Examples:

*&lt;'''0'''='''0'''∧~'''0'''='''0'''&gt;
*&lt;b=b∨~∃c:c=b&gt;
*&lt;'''S0'''='''0'''⊃∀c:~∃b:(b+b)=c&gt;

The quantification status of a variable doesn't change here.

== Quantifiers ==
There are two quantifiers used: ''[[Universal quantification|∀]]'' and ''[[Existential quantification|∃]]''.

Note that unlike most other [[logical system]]s where qualifiers over sets require a mention of the element's existence in the set, this is not required in TNT because all numbers and terms are strictly natural numbers or logical boolean statements. It is therefore equivalent to say ∀a:(a&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;N):∀b:(b&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;N):&amp;nbsp;(a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;b)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(b&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;a)&amp;nbsp; and ∀a:∀b:(a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;b)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(b&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;a)

*∃ means "There exists"
*∀ means "For every" or "For all"
*The symbol : is used to separate a quantifier from other quantifiers or from the rest of the formula. It is commonly read "such that"

For example:

:∀a:∀b:(a&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;b)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;(b&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;a)
("For every number a and every number b, a plus b equals b plus a", or more figuratively, "Addition is commutative.")

:~∃c:'''S'''c&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''0'''

("There does not exist a number c such that c plus one equals zero", or more figuratively, "Zero is not the successor of any (natural) number.")

== Atoms and propositional statements ==

All the symbols of [[propositional calculus]] apart from the Atom symbols are used in Typographical Number Theory, and they retain their interpretations.

Atoms are here defined as strings which amount to statements of equality, such as

2 plus 3 equals five:
:('''SS0'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''SSS0''')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''SSSSS0'''
2 plus 2 is equal to 4:
:('''SS0'''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;'''SS0''')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''SSSS0'''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27344">In the [[mathematics|mathematical]] field of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], '''uniform convergence''' is a type of [[Limit of a sequence|convergence]] of functions stronger than [[pointwise convergence]]. A [[sequence]] of [[Function (mathematics)|functions]] &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; '''converges uniformly''' to a limiting function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; if, given any arbitrarily small positive number &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, a number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; can be found such that each of the functions &lt;math&gt;f_N, f_{N+1},f_{N+2},\ldots&lt;/math&gt; differ from &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; by no more than &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; ''at every point'' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; ''in'' &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.  Described in an informal way, if &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; uniformly, then the rate at which &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; approaches &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is "uniform" throughout its domain in the following sense: in order to determine how large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; needs to be to guarantee that &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; falls within a certain distance &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, we do not need to know the value of &lt;math&gt;x\in E&lt;/math&gt; in question — there is a single value of &lt;math&gt;N=N(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; ''independent of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;'', such that choosing &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; to be larger than &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; will suffice. 

The difference between uniform convergence and pointwise convergence was not fully appreciated early in the history of calculus, leading to instances of faulty reasoning.  The concept, which was first formalized by [[Karl Weierstrass]], is important because several properties of the functions &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt;, such as [[continuous function|continuity]], [[Riemann integral|Riemann integrability]], and, with additional hypotheses, [[differentiability]], are transferred to the [[limit of a function|limit]] &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; if the convergence is uniform, but not necessarily if the convergence is not uniform.

== History ==

In 1821 [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]]  published a proof that a convergent sum of continuous functions is always continuous, to which [[Niels Henrik Abel]] in 1826 found purported counterexamples in the context of [[Fourier series]], arguing that Cauchy's proof had to be incorrect.  Completely standard notions of convergence did not exist at the time, and Cauchy handled convergence using infinitesimal methods.  When put into the modern language, what Cauchy proved is that a uniformly convergent sequence of continuous functions has a continuous limit. The failure of a merely pointwise-convergent limit of continuous functions to converge to a continuous function illustrates the importance of distinguishing between different types of convergence when handling sequences of functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0315086004000916 | doi=10.1016/j.hm.2004.11.010 | volume=32 | title=Exceptions and counterexamples: Understanding Abel's comment on Cauchy's Theorem | journal=Historia Mathematica | pages=453–480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term uniform convergence was probably first used by [[Christoph Gudermann]], in an 1838 paper on [[elliptic functions]], where he employed the phrase "convergence in a uniform way" when the "mode of convergence" of a series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n(x,\phi,\psi)}&lt;/math&gt; is independent of the variables &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi.&lt;/math&gt; While he thought it a "remarkable fact" when a series converged in this way, he did not give a formal definition, nor use the property in any of his proofs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later Gudermann's pupil [[Karl Weierstrass]], who attended his course on elliptic functions in 1839–1840, coined the term ''gleichmäßig konvergent'' ({{lang-de|uniformly convergent}}) which he used in his 1841 paper ''Zur Theorie der Potenzreihen'', published in 1894. Independently, similar concepts were articulated by [[Philipp Ludwig von Seidel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lakatos |first=Imre |authorlink=Imre Lakatos |title=[[Proofs and Refutations]]|year=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=141 |isbn=0-521-21078-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Gabriel Stokes]].  [[G. H. Hardy]] compares the three definitions in his paper "Sir George Stokes and the concept of uniform convergence" and remarks: "Weierstrass's discovery was the earliest, and he alone fully realized its far-reaching importance as one of the fundamental ideas of analysis."

Under the influence of Weierstrass and [[Bernhard Riemann]] this concept and related questions were intensely studied at the end of the 19th century by [[Hermann Hankel]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], [[Ulisse Dini]], [[Cesare Arzelà]] and others.

== Definition ==

We first define uniform convergence for [[Real-valued function|real-valued functions]], although the concept is readily generalized to functions mapping to [[Metric space|metric spaces]] and, more generally, [[Uniform space|uniform spaces]] (see [[Uniform convergence#Generalizations|below]]).  

Suppose &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and &lt;math&gt;f_n: E \to \mathbb R &lt;/math&gt; (for &lt;math&gt; n=1,2,3,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;) are real-valued functions. We say that the sequence &lt;math&gt;(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb N} &lt;/math&gt; is '''uniformly convergent''' on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; with limit &lt;math&gt; f: E \to \mathbb R &lt;/math&gt; if for every &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, there exists a natural number &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt; n \geq N &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; x \in E &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; |f_n(x)-f(x)|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

The notation for uniform convergence of &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not quite standardized and different authors have used a variety of symbols, including (in roughly decreasing order of popularity) &lt;math&gt;f_n\rightrightarrows f&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\underset{n\to\infty}{\mathrm{unif\ lim}}f_n = f &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_n \overset{\mathrm{unif.}}{\longrightarrow} f  &lt;/math&gt;.  Frequently, no special symbol is used, and authors simply write &lt;math&gt;f_n\to f\ \mathrm{uniformly}&lt;/math&gt; to indicate that convergence is uniform.  (In contrast, the expression &lt;math&gt;f_n\to f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; without an adverb is taken to mean [[pointwise convergence]] on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;: for all &lt;math&gt; x \in E &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f_n(x)\to f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;.)

Since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[complete metric space]], the [[Cauchy sequence|Cauchy criterion]] can be used to give an equivalent alternative formulation for uniform convergence: &lt;math&gt;(f_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; (in the previous sense) if and only if for every &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;, there exists a natural number &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt;x\in E, m\geq N,n\geq N\implies |f_m(x)-f_n(x)|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.

In yet another equivalent formulation, if we define &lt;math display="inline"&gt; d_n = \sup_{x\in E} |f_n(x) - f(x) | &lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; f_n &lt;/math&gt; converges to &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; uniformly if and only if &lt;math&gt;d_n\to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus, we can characterize uniform convergence of &lt;math&gt;(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb N} &lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; as (simple) convergence of &lt;math&gt;(f_n)_{n \in \mathbb N} &lt;/math&gt; in the [[function space]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^{E}&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the ''[[Uniform norm|uniform metric]]'' (also called the supremum metric), defined by &lt;math display="inline"&gt;d(f,g)=\sup_{x\in E} |f(x)-g(x)|&lt;/math&gt;.  Symbolically,  

:&lt;math&gt;f_n\rightrightarrows f\iff \lim_{n\to\infty} d(f_n,f)= 0&lt;/math&gt;.

The sequence &lt;math&gt; (f_n)_{n \in \mathbb N} &lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''locally uniformly convergent''' with limit &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric space]] and for every &lt;math&gt; x\in E &lt;/math&gt;,  there exists an &lt;math&gt; r &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; (f_n) &lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on &lt;math&gt; B(x,r) \cap E &lt;/math&gt;.  It is clear that uniform convergence implies local uniform convergence, which implies pointwise convergence.

=== Notes ===

Intuitively, a sequence of functions &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; if, given an arbitrarily small &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we can find an &lt;math&gt;N\in\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; so that the functions &lt;math&gt;f_n\ (n\geq N)&lt;/math&gt; all fall within a "tube" of width &lt;math&gt;2\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; centered around &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., between &lt;math&gt;f(x)-\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(x)+\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;) for the ''entire domain'' of the function.

Note that interchanging the order of quantifiers in the definition of uniform convergence by moving "for all &lt;math&gt;x\in E&lt;/math&gt;" in front of "there exists a natural number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;" results in a definition of [[pointwise convergence]] of the sequence.  To make this difference explicit, in the case of uniform convergence, &lt;math&gt;N=N(\epsilon)&lt;/math&gt; can only depend on &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, and the choice of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; has to work for all &lt;math&gt;x\in E&lt;/math&gt;, for a specific value of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; that is given.  In contrast, in the case of pointwise convergence, &lt;math&gt;N=N(\epsilon,x)&lt;/math&gt; may depend on both &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, and the choice of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; only has to work for the specific values of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; that are given. Thus uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence, however the converse is not true, as the example in the section below illustrates.

=== Generalizations ===

One may straightforwardly extend the concept to functions ''E'' → ''M'', where (''M'', ''d'') is a [[metric space]], by replacing &lt;math&gt;|f_n(x)-f(x)|&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;d(f_n(x),f(x))&lt;/math&gt;.

The most general setting is the uniform convergence of [[net (mathematics)|net]]s of functions ''E'' → ''X'', where ''X'' is a [[uniform space]]. We say that the net &lt;math&gt;(f_\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; ''converges uniformly'' with limit ''f'' : ''E'' → ''X'' if and only if for every [[entourage (topology)|entourage]] ''V'' in ''X'', there exists an &lt;math&gt;\alpha_0&lt;/math&gt;, such that for every ''x'' in ''E'' and every &lt;math&gt;\alpha\geq \alpha_0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(f_\alpha(x),f(x))&lt;/math&gt; is in ''V''.
In this situation, uniform limit of continuous functions remain continuous.

===Definition in a hyperreal setting===
Uniform convergence admits a simplified definition in a [[hyperreal number|hyperreal]] setting.  Thus, a sequence &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; converges to ''f'' uniformly if for all ''x'' in the domain of ''f*'' and all infinite ''n'', &lt;math&gt;f_n^*(x)&lt;/math&gt; is infinitely close to &lt;math&gt;f^*(x)&lt;/math&gt; (see [[microcontinuity]] for a similar definition of uniform continuity).

== Examples ==
Given a [[topological space]] ''X'', we can equip the space of [[bounded function|bounded]] [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]]-valued functions over ''X'' with the [[uniform norm]] topology, with the uniform metric defined by &lt;math&gt;d(f,g)=||f-g||_{\infty}=\sup_{x\in X} |f(x)-g(x)|&lt;/math&gt;. Then uniform convergence simply means [[Limit of a sequence|convergence]] in the [[uniform norm]] topology: &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}||f_n-f||_{\infty}=0&lt;/math&gt;.

The sequence of functions &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; f_n:[0,1]\rightarrow [0,1] &lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt; f_n(x)=x^n &lt;/math&gt; is a classic example of a sequence of functions that converges to a function &lt;math&gt;f &lt;/math&gt; pointwise but not uniformly.  To show this, we first observe that the pointwise limit of &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the function &lt;math&gt;f &lt;/math&gt;, given by

: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty} f_n(x) = \begin{cases} 0, &amp; x \in [0,1); \\ 1, &amp; x=1. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

''Pointwise convergence:''  Convergence is trivial for &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x=1&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;f_n(0)=f(0)=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f_n(1)=f(1)=1&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;.  For &lt;math&gt;x \in (0,1)&lt;/math&gt; and given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, we can ensure that &lt;math&gt;|f_n(x)-f(x)|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;n\geq N&lt;/math&gt; by choosing &lt;math&gt;N = \lceil\log\epsilon/\log x\rceil&lt;/math&gt; (here the upper square brackets indicate rounding up, see [[Floor and ceiling functions|ceiling function]]).  Hence, &lt;math&gt;f_n\to f&lt;/math&gt; pointwise for all &lt;math&gt;x\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that the choice of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; depends on the value of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; ''and'' &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.  Moreover, for a fixed choice of &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; (which cannot be defined to be smaller) grows without bound as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; approaches 1.  These observations preclude the possibility of uniform convergence.

''Non-uniformity of convergence:''  The convergence is not uniform, because given &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, no ''single choice'' of &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; can ensure that &lt;math&gt;|f_n(x)-f(x)|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; ''for all'' &lt;math&gt;x\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;, whenever &lt;math&gt;n\geq N&lt;/math&gt;.   To see this, we note that regardless of how large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; becomes, there is always an &lt;math&gt;x_0 \in [0,1)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f_n(x_0)=1/2&lt;/math&gt; (or any other positive value less than 1).  Thus, if we choose &lt;math&gt;\epsilon = 1/4&lt;/math&gt;, we can never find an &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|f_n(x)-f(x)|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n\geq N&lt;/math&gt;.  Explicitly, given any candidate for &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, consider the value of &lt;math&gt;f_N&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x_0 = (1/2)^{1/N}&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;|f_N(x_0)-f(x_0)|=\Big|[(1/2)^{1/N}]^N-0\Big|=1/2&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, we have found an example of an &lt;math&gt;x\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt; that "escaped" our attempt to "confine" each &lt;math&gt;f_n\ (n\geq N)&lt;/math&gt; to within &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in[0,1]&lt;/math&gt;.  In fact, it is easy to see that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty}||f_n-f||_{\infty}=1&lt;/math&gt;, contrary to the requirement that &lt;math&gt;||f_n-f||_{\infty}\to 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;f_n\rightrightarrows f&lt;/math&gt;.

In this example one can easily see that pointwise convergence does not preserve differentiability or continuity. While each function of the sequence is smooth, that is to say that for all ''n'', &lt;math&gt;f_n\in C^{\infty}([0,1])&lt;/math&gt;, the limit &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}f_n&lt;/math&gt; is not even continuous.

=== Exponential function ===
The series expansion of the [[exponential function]] can be shown to be uniformly convergent on any bounded subset &lt;math&gt; S\subset\mathbb{C} &lt;/math&gt; using the [[Weierstrass M-test]].

'''Theorem (Weierstrass M-test).'''  ''Let &lt;math&gt; (f_n) &lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of functions &lt;math&gt; f_n:E\to \mathbb{C} &lt;/math&gt; and let &lt;math&gt; M_n &lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of positive real numbers such that &lt;math&gt; |f_n(x)|&lt;M_n &lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt; x\in E &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; n=1,2,3,\ldots &lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \sum_n M_n &lt;/math&gt; converges, then &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \sum_n f_n &lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on &lt;math&gt; E &lt;/math&gt;.''

The complex exponential function can be expressed as the series:

::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^n}{n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

Any bounded subset is a subset of some disc &lt;math&gt;D_R&lt;/math&gt; of radius &lt;math&gt; R &lt;/math&gt;, centered on the origin in the [[complex plane]]. The Weierstrass M-test requires us to find an upper bound &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt; on the terms of the series, with &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt; independent of the position in the disc:
::&lt;math&gt;\left| \frac{z^n}{n!}\right|\le M_n     , \forall z\in D_R.&lt;/math&gt;
To do this, we notice
::&lt;math&gt;\left| \frac{z^n}{n!}\right| \le \frac{\left| z\right|^n}{n!} \le \frac{R^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;
and take &lt;math&gt;M_n=\frac{R^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;.

If &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}M_n&lt;/math&gt; is convergent, then the M-test asserts that the original series is uniformly convergent.

The [[ratio test]] can be used here:
::&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{M_{n+1}}{M_n}=\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{R^{n+1}}{R^n}\frac{n!}{(n+1)!}=\lim_{n \to \infty}\frac{R}{n+1}=0&lt;/math&gt;
which means the series over &lt;math&gt;M_n&lt;/math&gt; is convergent.
Thus the original series converges uniformly for all &lt;math&gt;z\in D_R&lt;/math&gt;, and since &lt;math&gt;S\subset D_R&lt;/math&gt;, the series is also uniformly convergent on &lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt;.

== Properties ==

* Every uniformly convergent sequence is locally uniformly convergent.
* Every locally uniformly convergent sequence is [[compactly convergent]].
* For [[locally compact space]]s local uniform convergence and compact convergence coincide.
* A sequence of continuous functions on metric spaces, with the image metric space being complete, is uniformly convergent if and only if it is [[Uniformly Cauchy sequence|uniformly Cauchy]].
* If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is a [[compact space|compact]] interval (or in general a compact topological space), and &lt;math&gt; (f_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[monotonic|monotone increasing]] sequence (meaning &lt;math&gt; f_n(x) \leq f_{n+1}(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all ''n'' and ''x'') of ''continuous'' functions with a pointwise limit &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; which is also continuous, then the convergence is necessarily uniform ([[Dini's theorem]]). Uniform convergence is also guaranteed if &lt;math&gt; S&lt;/math&gt; is a compact interval and &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; is an [[equicontinuity|equicontinuous]] sequence that converges pointwise.

== Applications ==

===To continuity===
{{Main|Uniform limit theorem}}
[[Image:Drini nonuniformconvergence SVG.svg|thumb|350px|right|Counterexample to a strengthening of the uniform convergence theorem, in which pointwise convergence, rather than uniform convergence, is assumed. The continuous green functions &lt;math&gt;\sin^n(x)&lt;/math&gt; converge to the non-continuous red function.  This can happen only if convergence is not uniform.]]

If &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; are [[topological space|topological spaces]], then it  makes sense to talk about the [[continuous function (topology)|continuity]] of the functions &lt;math&gt;f_n,f:E\to M&lt;/math&gt;.  If we further assume that &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a [[metric space]], then (uniform) convergence of the &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is also well defined.  The following result states that continuity is preserved by uniform convergence:

: '''Uniform limit theorem'''. ''Suppose &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; is a  topological space, &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a metric space, and &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of continuous functions &lt;math&gt;f_n:E\to M&lt;/math&gt;.  If &lt;math&gt;f_n\rightrightarrows f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;,  then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is also continuous.''

This theorem is proved by the "{{math|&amp;epsilon;/3}} trick", and is the archetypal example of this trick: to prove a given inequality ({{math|&amp;epsilon;}}), one uses the definitions of continuity and uniform convergence to produce 3 inequalities ({{math|&amp;epsilon;/3}}), and then combines them via the [[triangle inequality]] to produce the desired inequality.

This theorem is an important one in the history of real and Fourier analysis, since many 18th century mathematicians had the intuitive understanding that a sequence of continuous functions always converges to a continuous function.  The image above shows a counterexample, and many discontinuous functions could, in fact, be written as a [[Fourier series]] of continuous functions.  The erroneous claim that the pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions is continuous (originally stated in terms of convergent series of continuous functions) is infamously known as "Cauchy's wrong theorem".  The uniform limit theorem shows that a stronger form of convergence, uniform convergence, is needed to ensure the preservation of continuity in the limit function.

More precisely, this theorem states that the uniform limit of ''[[uniformly continuous]]'' functions is uniformly continuous; for a [[locally compact]] space, continuity is equivalent to local uniform continuity, and thus the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.

===To differentiability===
If &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is an interval and all the functions &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; are [[derivative|differentiable]] and converge to a limit &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, it is often desirable to determine the derivative function &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; by taking the limit of the sequence &lt;math&gt;f'_n&lt;/math&gt;. This is however in general not possible: even if the convergence is uniform, the limit function need not be differentiable (not even if the sequence consists of everywhere-[[analytic function|analytic]] functions, see [[Weierstrass function]]), and even if it is differentiable, the derivative of the limit function need not be equal to the limit of the derivatives. Consider for instance &lt;math&gt;f_n(x) = n^{-1/2}{\sin(nx)}&lt;/math&gt; with uniform limit &lt;math&gt;f_n\rightrightarrows f\equiv 0&lt;/math&gt;. Clearly, &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; is also identically zero.  However, the derivatives of the sequence of functions are given by &lt;math&gt;f'_n(x)=n^{1/2}\cos nx,&lt;/math&gt; and the sequence &lt;math&gt;f'_n&lt;/math&gt; does not converge to &lt;math&gt;f',&lt;/math&gt; or even to any function at all.  In order to ensure a connection between the limit of a sequence of differentiable functions and the limit of the sequence of derivatives, the uniform convergence of the sequence of derivatives plus the convergence of the sequence of functions at at least one point is required. The precise statement covering this situation is as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Rudin, Walter (1976). ''[[iarchive:PrinciplesOfMathematicalAnalysis|Principles of Mathematical Analysis]]'' 3rd edition, Theorem 7.17.  McGraw-Hill: New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''If &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of differentiable functions on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} f_n(x_0)&lt;/math&gt; exists (and is finite) for some &lt;math&gt;x_0\in[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and the sequence &lt;math&gt;(f'_n)&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly to a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; f'(x) = \lim_{n\to \infty} f'_n(x)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;x \in [a, b]&lt;/math&gt;.''

===To integrability===
Similarly, one often wants to exchange integrals and limit processes. For the [[Riemann integral]], this can be done if uniform convergence is assumed:
: ''If &lt;math&gt;(f_n)_{n=1}^\infty&lt;/math&gt; is a sequence of Riemann integrable functions defined on a [[compact space|compact]] interval &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;  which uniformly converge with limit &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt; f&lt;/math&gt; is Riemann integrable and its integral can be computed as the limit of the integrals of the &lt;math&gt; f_n&lt;/math&gt;:''
:: ''&lt;math&gt;\int_I f = \lim_{n\to\infty}\int_I f_n.&lt;/math&gt;''
In fact, for a uniformly convergent family of bounded functions on an interval, the upper and lower Riemann integrals converge to the upper and lower Riemann integrals of the limit function.  This follows because, for ''n'' sufficiently large, the graph of &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; is within {{math|&amp;epsilon;}} of the graph of ''f'', and so the upper sum and lower sum of &lt;math&gt;f_n&lt;/math&gt; are each within &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon |I|&lt;/math&gt; of the value of the upper and lower sums of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;, respectively.

Much stronger theorems in this respect, which require not much more than pointwise convergence, can be obtained if one abandons the Riemann integral and uses the [[Lebesgue integration|Lebesgue integral]] instead.

===To analyticity===
If a sequence of [[Analytic function|analytic]] functions converges uniformly in a region S of the complex plane, then the limit is analytic in S. This example demonstrates that complex functions are more well-behaved than real functions, since the uniform limit of analytic functions on a real interval need not even be differentiable (see [[Weierstrass function]]).

===To series===
We say that &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n&lt;/math&gt; converges:

i) pointwise on ''E'' if and only if the sequence of partial sums &lt;math&gt;s_n(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{n} f_j(x)&lt;/math&gt; converges for every &lt;math&gt;x\in E&lt;/math&gt;.

ii) uniformly on ''E'' if and only if ''s''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; converges uniformly as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty&lt;/math&gt;.

iii) absolutely on ''E'' if and only if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty |f_n|&lt;/math&gt; converges for every &lt;math&gt;x\in E&lt;/math&gt;.

With this definition comes the following result: &lt;blockquote&gt;''Let x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''be contained in the set E and each  f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; be continuous at x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. If  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle f=\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n &lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on E then f  is continuous at x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; ''in E. Suppose that &lt;math&gt;E=[a,b]&lt;/math&gt; and each f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is integrable on E. If  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum_{n=1}^\infty f_n &lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on E then f is integrable on E and the series of integrals of  f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is equal to integral of the series of f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Almost uniform convergence==
If the domain of the functions is a [[measure space]] E then the related notion of '''almost uniform convergence''' can be defined. We say a sequence of functions &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; converges almost uniformly on ''E'' if for every &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; there exists a measurable set &lt;math&gt;E_\delta&lt;/math&gt; with measure less than &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that  the sequence of functions &lt;math&gt;(f_n)&lt;/math&gt; converges uniformly on &lt;math&gt;E \setminus E_\delta&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, almost uniform convergence means there are sets of arbitrarily small measure for which the sequence of functions converges uniformly on their complement.

Note that almost uniform convergence of a sequence does not mean that the sequence converges uniformly [[almost everywhere]] as might be inferred from the name. However, [[Egorov's theorem]] does guarantee that on a finite measure space, a sequence of functions that converges [[Pointwise convergence#Almost everywhere convergence|almost everywhere]] also converges almost uniformly on the same set.

Almost uniform convergence implies [[almost everywhere convergence]] and [[convergence in measure]].
