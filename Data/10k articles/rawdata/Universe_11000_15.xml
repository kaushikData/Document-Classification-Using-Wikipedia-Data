      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1225">In [[quantum field theory]], specifically the theory of [[renormalization]], the '''bare mass''' of an elementary particle is the limit of its mass as the scale of distance approaches zero or, equivalently, as the energy of a particle collision approaches infinity. It differs from the [[invariant mass]] as usually understood because the latter includes the 'clothing' of the particle by pairs of virtual particles that are temporarily created by the force-fields around the particle. In some versions of QFT, the bare mass of some particles may be plus or minus infinity. In the theory of the [[electroweak interaction]] using the [[Higgs boson]], all particles have a bare mass of zero.

This allows us to write &lt;math&gt;m = m_0 + \delta_m&lt;/math&gt;, where m denotes the experimentally observable mass of the particle, &lt;math&gt;m_0&lt;/math&gt; its bare mass, and &lt;math&gt;\delta_m&lt;/math&gt; the increase in mass owing to the interaction of the particle with the medium or field.

'''British Thomson-Houston''' (BTH) was a British engineering and [[heavy industry|heavy industrial]] company, based at [[Rugby, Warwickshire]], England and founded as a subsidiary of the [[General Electric]] Company (GE) of [[Schenectady, New York]], USA. They were known primarily for their electrical systems and [[steam turbine]]s. BTH was taken into British ownership and amalgamated with the similar [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] company in 1928 to form [[Associated Electrical Industries]] (AEI), but the two brand identities were maintained until 1960. The holding company, [[Associated Electrical Industries]] (AEI), later merged with [[The General Electric Company|GEC]], the remnants of which exist today as [[Marconi Corporation]].

In the 1960s BTH [[apprenticeship]]s were highly thought-of, with apprentices exposed to production of a wide range of industrial products.  Each year in Rugby there was a big [[Float (parade)|parade of floats]] run by its apprentices, many of whom lodged in the nearby [[Coton House]] apprentice hostel.

In 1980, G.E.C. Turbine Generators Ltd, on the Rugby site, was awarded a [[Queen's Awards for Enterprise]].

==History==
[[File:British Thomson-Houston dataplate.JPG|thumb|upright|Showing correct company name and format]]
[[File:Laing, Wharton &amp; Down Generator - Cassier's 1892-09.png|thumb|British Thomson-Houston had its origins in ''Laing, Wharton &amp; Down''. One of their steam-driven generators was described in the September 1892 issue of ''[[Cassier's Magazine]]''.]]

The company '''Laing, Wharton and Down''' was formed in 1886 to sell products from [[Thomson-Houston]], an American firm known as the American Electric Corporation until 1883. Laing, Wharton and Down soon won a contract for electrical lighting for the east end of London.&lt;ref name="OfficialSite"&gt;{{cite web |title=British Thomson-Houston History |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050306132153/http://www.marconi.com/Home/about_us/Our%20History/GEC%20Heritage/British%20Thompson-Houston%20History |website=Marconi Corporation |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1894 Laing, Wharton and Down purchased patents and exclusive production rights from the American company, now known as [[General Electric]] after Thomson-Houston merged with [[Edison General Electric Company]] in 1892. At this stage Laing, Wharton and Down was renamed as '''British Thomson-Houston''' and General Electric became the majority owner of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Money Market |agency=The Times |date=17 August 1894}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Once BTH had the production licences for Thomson-Houston's products it started setting up factories in the [[English Midlands]], with [[Rugby, Warwickshire]] chosen as the main location due to its good accessibility by rail and a local coal supply.&lt;ref name="GracesGuide"&gt;{{cite web |title=BTH |url=http://www.gracesguide.co.uk/BTH |website=Grace's Guide to British Industrial History |accessdate=19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 BTH bought Glebe Farm on the west side of Mill Road north of the railway in Rugby for £10,000, from Thos. Hunter &amp; Co., to build their factory on it. The Mill Road factory opened in 1902 and made [[electric motor]]s and [[Electrical generator|generator]]s. In the same year BTH got a licence to produce the [[Curtis steam turbine]], which became one of the company's major products. In 1905 BTH made its first [[turbo-alternator]] and in 1911 got licences for all of General Electric's drawn-wire [[light bulb]]s, which it produced under the [[Mazda (light bulb)|Mazda]] [[trademark]].&lt;ref name="OfficialSite" /&gt;

For much of the late 19th century BTH competed for electrical generation and distribution contracts with [[British Westinghouse]], mirroring the same company's battles in the US between their parents, [[General Electric]] and [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]]. The [[Power Act 1900]] let BTH and British Westinghouse get new contracts to supply electric power to large areas.&lt;ref name="OfficialSite" /&gt;

As well as manufacturing, BTH also began to move into transport. On 22 December 1898 BTH opened the [[Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company]], followed by the [[Isle of Thanet Electric Tramways and Lighting Company|Isle of Thanet Electric Tramways]] on 4 April 1901 and the [[Chatham and District Light Railways Company]] in June 1902. In 1907 BTH started a joint venture with [[Wolseley Motors]] to make [[petrol-electric]] buses and in 1909 the company supplied major coal-fired steam generators to London to power an electric [[tram|trolley]] system that was being set up.&lt;ref name="GracesGuide" /&gt;

===Consolidation===
During [[World War I]] BTH expanded into naval electrical equipment, supplying the [[Royal Navy]] with various lighting, radio and signalling gear.&lt;ref name="OfficialSite" /&gt;

After the war BTH expanded dramatically, adding or expanding factories at [[Willesden]], [[Birmingham]], [[Chesterfield]], and [[Lutterworth]]. It later had factories in [[Coventry]], and in [[Larne]] in [[Northern Ireland]]. From 1924 to 1927 [[Demetrius Comino]] worked as an apprentice for BTH.

In 1926 Gerard Swope, president of [[General Electric]], proposed that BTH, Westinghouse, [[General Electric Company]] (GEC) and [[English Electric]] should amalgamate. [[Lord Hirst]] of GEC was not interested in Swope’s scheme, but a new holding company was formed, '''[[Associated Electrical Industries]]''' (AEI), and in 1928 AEI bought BTH and [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] (Metrovick). BTH had been in the process of buying [[Joseph Swan#Ediswan|Edison Swan]] (Ediswan) and [[Ferguson, Pailin &amp; Co]], with AEI completing the purchases in 1929. Howard C. Levis, chairman of BTH from 1916, became chairman of AEI in 1928, retiring the following year.&lt;ref name="OfficialSite" /&gt;

In 1927 BTH sold the [[Chatham and District Light Railways Company]] to Maidstone and District Motor Services Ltd.

Throughout the 1920s BTH made turbo generators and motors for [[ocean liner]]s including {{RMS|Mooltan}}, {{RMS|Viceroy of India}}, {{RMS|Strathnaver}} and {{RMS|Strathaird}}. The BTH factory in Northern Ireland made the [[turbo generator]] and propulsion motor for one of the world's first [[Turbo-electric transmission|turbo-electric]] merchant ships, the [[Banana boat (ship)|banana boat]] [[USS Taurus (AF-25)|SS ''San Benito'']], in 1921. This was followed by turbo generators and propulsion motors for the banana boats {{SS|Musa}}, {{SS|Platano}} and {{SS|Darien|1924|6}}.

The site at Rugby was also developed. Building 52, the research laboratory, was purpose-built in 1924. In the late 1920s AEI started to build buildings west of the footpath that runs north through the AEI site in Rugby to the Leicester Road (known in the area as the Black Path because it was surfaced with [[cinder]]s). During [[World War II]] BTH expanded north of the [[River Avon, Warwickshire|River Avon]] into the Boughton Road site to make [[ignition magneto|magneto]]s for aircraft engines and other war products.

[[File:RRKestrel.JPG|thumb|right|One of the two British Thomson-Houston [[distributor]]s (the circular gold-coloured component) on a [[Rolls-Royce Kestrel]] aero engine]]
BTH had a major role in developing the world's first [[prototype]] [[jet engine]], which was built by [[Frank Whittle]]'s [[Power Jets]] company built at the BTH works in Rugby in 1937. Development was later moved to the [[Lutterworth]] works, which were falling into disuse at the time. BTH's directors seemed skeptical of the design and offered little help, and in 1940 decided they were not really interested in making jet engines due to their commitment to electrical equipment. [[Rover (car)|Rover]] was soon selected to make jet engines, but exchanged jet engine production with [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] for making [[Rolls Royce Meteor|tank engines]] in 1943. In 1944 the Lutterworth Power Jets work was nationalised.

After World War II [[Oliver Lyttelton]] took over as chairman of AEI, and started a massive expansion. He returned as chairman between 1954 and 1963 and oversaw the opening of a massive new £8 million turbine works was opened at [[Larne]] in 1957. In 1955 AEI acquired [[Siemens Brothers]], which was merged with Edison Swan in 1957 to form the '''Siemens Edison Swan''' subsidiary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Celebrating 175 glorious years |url=http://www.aeicables.co.uk/history.asp |website=AEI Cables |accessdate=20 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivalry with Metrovick intensified, particularly after BTH won the contract to build the new [[Buenos Aires]] [[Central Costanera S.A.]] power station, valued at £35 million, in 1957. Lyttelton continued to try to reduce this friction, leading to several unsuccessful reorganisations and slipping profits.&lt;ref name="OfficialSite" /&gt;

The postwar period saw continued development at BTH. The [[Hungary|Hungarian]] scientist [[Dennis Gabor]] invented [[holography]] at the BTH site in Rugby in 1947, and in 1951 BTH supplied a {{convert|1200|bhp|kW|abbr=on|order=flip}} [[Gas turbine#Civilian maritime|gas turbine]] for the ''Auris'', the first commercial ship to use gas-turbine propulsion. In 1955 BTH supplied 18 [[New Zealand DSC class locomotive]] Rolls-Royce powered locomotives for [[New Zealand Railways Department|New Zealand Railways]]. The Ediswan trademark appeared on semiconductors in 1956 and the following year [[British Rail Class 15]] diesel-electric locomotives were designed by BTH.

===AEI (Associated Electrical Industries)===
To try to cure internal political and efficiency problems, AEI stopped using the BTH and Metrovick names on 1 January 1960. This led to a huge decline in sales because no-one had heard of "AEI" before, and in turn, a massive drop in AEI's stock price. Continued attempts to streamline what was two separate management structures continued to fail, and by the mid-60s the entire AEI group was in financial trouble. The '''AEI''' name was first used on products in 1961. By 1967 AEI brands included Siemens Edison Swan, [[Hotpoint]], [[Birlec]] and [[W.T. Henley]].

Britain's first commercial [[nuclear power]] facility was built between 1956 and 1962 at [[Berkeley Nuclear Power Station|Berkeley]]. This was followed by the building and commissioning of the 25M Chilbolton (radar) Dish at [[Chilbolton Observatory]] between 1963 and 1967. The AEI research lab (building BR57) was built in 1960 at the Boughton Road site. At this point the size of the Rugby site peaked, with all of the company's land west of the Black Path built over.

===GEC (General Electric Company)===
[[File:AA former BTH east gate.jpg|thumb|right|View across Mill Road, [[Rugby, Warwickshire|Rugby]] of where the east entrance of BTH was]]
In 1967 [[The General Electric Company|GEC]] bought AEI outright and became the UK's largest electrical group. A year later GEC acquired [[English Electric]], prompting a series of mergers and reorganisations. GEC-AEI Electronics (Blackbird Road and New Parks, Leicester) was merged with Marconi's Radar Division (Chelmsford) and Elliott's Aerospace Control Division to form '''Marconi Radar Systems Ltd.''' (MRSL) in 1969.

In 1980 GEC Turbine Generators Ltd received [[The Queen's Award for Enterprise: International Trade (Export)]].

During the 1980s GEC Rugby shrank and buildings were demolished. The south part of the area to the west of the Black Path became a supermarket site. The Boughton Road site became several separate small firms. In 1989 GEC Rugby split into GEC [[Alstom|Alsthom]] and [[Cegelec Projects]], which were reunited in 1998 as '''Alstom'''.

The firm's [[wikt:clubhouse|clubhouse]] on Hillmorton Road was demolished in 2007, and the south edge of its surrounding sports field was encroached along for house building. By 2011 the site was greatly changed and included [[Rugby College]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warwickshire.ac.uk/our_locations/rugby.aspx] Warwickshire University, Rugby College. Retrieved 2013-12-28&lt;/ref&gt; Quartzelec,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quartzelec.com/quartzelec-rugby.html] Quartzelec, Rugby. Retrieved 2013-12-28&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Converteam]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.converteam.com/majic/pageServer/1p040000yn/UK---Main-Office---Rugby.html] Converteam {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404053706/http://www.converteam.com/majic/pageServer/1p040000yn/UK---Main-Office---Rugby.html |date=4 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; worked on electrical engineering projects in some of the early BTH buildings, notably buildings 4, 193 and 140. A public road was built through the site between its former east and west gates. In 2012 Converteam was bought out by [[General Electric]], therefore coming full circle back to when they were partnered in AEI. Converteam (now GE) produced rotating machines and used former-BTH equipment (machines) for running tests.

==Research==
During post-World War II Britain, AEI established a consolidated research effort at [[Aldermaston]] in Berkshire, England. The research centre was based at [[Aldermaston Court]] a large stately home owned by AEI that had been requisitioned for military use in the war era.

==Preserved locomotives==
One of the BTH-built batch of New Zealand Railways DSC class Bo-Bo shunters has been preserved and is used in industrial service, complete with original Rolls-Royce engines. The locomotive (DSC406) is the primary motive power at Alliance Ltd, [[Pukeuri]], New Zealand. All the others were scrapped between 1986 and 1990.

'''Bromine''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Br''' and [[atomic number]] 35. It is the third-lightest [[halogen]], and is a fuming red-brown [[liquid]] at room temperature that evaporates readily to form a similarly coloured gas. Its properties are thus intermediate between those of [[chlorine]] and [[iodine]]. Isolated independently by two chemists, [[Carl Jacob Löwig]] (in 1825) and [[Antoine Jerome Balard|Antoine Jérôme Balard]] (in 1826), its name was derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] βρῶμος ("stench"), referencing its sharp and disagreeable smell.

Elemental bromine is very reactive and thus does not occur [[free element|free]] in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide [[Ionic salt|salts]], analogous to [[table salt]]. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the bromide ion (Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from [[brine]] pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth that of chlorine.

At high temperatures, [[organobromine compound]]s readily dissociate to yield free bromine atoms, a process that stops [[free radical]] chemical [[chain reaction]]s. This effect makes organobromine compounds useful as [[fire retardant]]s, and more than half the bromine produced worldwide each year is put to this purpose. The same property causes ultraviolet [[sunlight]] to dissociate volatile organobromine compounds in the [[atmosphere]] to yield free bromine atoms, causing [[ozone depletion]]. As a result, many organobromide compounds—such as the [[pesticide]] [[Bromomethane|methyl bromide]]—are no longer used. Bromine compounds are still used in [[well drilling fluids]], in [[photographic film]], and as an intermediate in the manufacture of [[organic compound|organic]] chemicals.

Large amounts of bromide salts are toxic from the action of soluble bromide ion, causing [[bromism]]. However, a clear biological role for bromide ion and hypobromous acid has recently been elucidated, and it now appears that bromine is an essential trace element in humans. The role of biological organobromine compounds in sea life such as algae has been known for much longer. As a [[pharmaceutical]], the simple bromide ion (Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as [[antiepileptic]]s.

==History==
[[File:Antoine Jérôme Balard 1870s.jpg|thumb|left|[[Antoine Jerome Balard|Antoine Balard]], one of the discoverers of bromine]]
Bromine was discovered independently by two chemists, [[Carl Jacob Löwig]]&lt;ref name=L1/&gt; and [[Antoine Jérôme Balard|Antoine Balard]],&lt;ref name="Bal1826"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Balard"/&gt; in 1825 and 1826, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The discovery of the elements: XVII. The halogen family|last = Weeks|first = Mary Elvira|authorlink=Mary Elvira Weeks|journal = Journal of Chemical Education|date = 1932|volume = 9|page = 1915|doi = 10.1021/ed009p1915|bibcode=1932JChEd...9.1915W|issue = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Löwig isolated bromine from a mineral water spring from his hometown [[Bad Kreuznach]] in 1825. Löwig used a solution of the mineral salt saturated with chlorine and extracted the bromine with [[diethyl ether]]. After evaporation of the ether a brown liquid remained. With this liquid as a sample of his work he applied for a position in the laboratory of [[Leopold Gmelin]] in [[Heidelberg]]. The publication of the results was delayed and Balard published his results first.&lt;ref name="Löwig" /&gt;

Balard found bromine chemicals in the ash of [[seaweed]] from the [[salt marsh]]es of [[Montpellier]]. The seaweed was used to produce iodine, but also contained bromine. Balard distilled the bromine from a solution of seaweed ash saturated with chlorine. The properties of the resulting substance were intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine; thus he tried to prove that the substance was [[iodine monochloride]] (ICl), but after failing to do so he was sure that he had found a new element, and named it muride, derived from the [[Latin]] word ''muria'' for brine.&lt;ref name="Balard" /&gt;

After the French chemists [[Louis Nicolas Vauquelin]], [[Louis Jacques Thénard]], and [[Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac]] approved the experiments of the young pharmacist Balard, the results were presented at a lecture of the [[Académie des Sciences]] and published in ''Annales de Chimie et Physique''.&lt;ref name="Bal1826" /&gt; In his publication, Balard states that he changed the name from ''muride'' to ''brôme'' on the proposal of M. Anglada. ''Brôme'' (bromine) derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench).&lt;ref name="Bal1826" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bal1826b"/&gt; Other sources claim that the French chemist and physicist [[Joseph-Louis Gay-Lussac]] suggested the name ''brôme'' for the characteristic smell of the vapors.&lt;ref name=b1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wisniak"/&gt; Bromine was not produced in large quantities until 1858, when the discovery of salt deposits in [[Stassfurt]] enabled its production as a by-product of potash.&lt;ref name=Greenwood790&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 790&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Some also suggest that it may have been discovered by [[Bernard Courtois]], the man who discovered iodine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Apart from some minor medical applications, the first commercial use was the [[daguerreotype]]. In 1840, bromine was discovered to have some advantages over the previously used iodine vapor to create the light sensitive [[silver halide]] layer in daguerreotypy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Daguerreotype: Nineteenth-century Technology and Modern Science|first = M.

[[Potassium bromide]] and [[sodium bromide]] were used as [[anticonvulsant]]s and [[sedative]]s in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, but were gradually superseded by [[chloral hydrate]] and then by the [[barbiturate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Psychiatry: From the Era of the Asylum to the Age of Prozac|first = Edward|last = Shorter| publisher = John Wiley and Sons|date = 1997|isbn = 978-0-471-24531-5|page =200}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the [[First World War]], bromine compounds such as [[xylyl bromide]] were used as [[poison gas]].&lt;ref name="Borden_chemwarfare"&gt;{{cite book | title = Medical Aspects of Chemical Warfare | year = 2008 | publisher = [[Borden Institute]] | authors = Corey J Hilmas, Jeffery K Smart, Benjamin A Hill | chapter = Chapter 2: History of Chemical Warfare (pdf) | pages = 12–14 | chapter-url = http://www.bordeninstitute.army.mil/published_volumes/chemwarfare/CHAP2_Pg_09-76.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromine is the third [[halogen]], being a [[nonmetal]] in group 17 of the periodic table. Its properties are thus similar to those of [[fluorine]], [[chlorine]], and [[iodine]], and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens, chlorine and iodine. Bromine has the electron configuration [Ar]3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;4p&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its [[valence electron]]s. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 800–4&lt;/ref&gt; Corresponding to [[periodic trend]]s, it is intermediate in [[electronegativity]] between chlorine and iodine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than chlorine and more reactive than iodine. It is also a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine, but a stronger one than iodine. Conversely, the [[bromide]] ion is a weaker reducing agent than iodide, but a stronger one than chloride.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; These similarities led to chlorine, bromine, and iodine together being classified as one of the original triads of [[Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner]], whose work foreshadowed the [[periodic law]] for chemical elements.&lt;ref name=purdue&gt;{{cite web | title = Johann Wolfgang Dobereiner| publisher = Purdue University| date = | url = http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/history/dobereiner.html| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20141114215946/http://chemed.chem.purdue.edu/genchem/history/dobereiner.html| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2014-11-14| accessdate = 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Historic Overview: Mendeleev and the Periodic Table | publisher = NASA| date = | url = http://genesismission.jpl.nasa.gov/educate/scimodule/UnderElem/UnderElem_pdf/HistOverST.pdf  | accessdate = 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intermediate in [[atomic radius]] between chlorine and iodine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between chlorine and iodine, such as first [[ionisation energy]], [[electron affinity]], enthalpy of dissociation of the X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; The volatility of bromine accentuates its very penetrating, choking, and unpleasant odour.&lt;ref name=Greenwood793&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 793–4&lt;/ref&gt;

All four stable halogens experience intermolecular [[van der Waals force]]s of attraction, and their strength increases together with number of electrons among all homonuclear diatomic halogen molecules. Thus, the melting and boiling points of bromine are intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine. As a result of the increasing molecular weight of the halogens down the group, the density and heats of fusion and vaporisation of bromine are again intermediate between those of chlorine and iodine, although all their heats of vaporisation are fairly low (leading to high volatility) thanks to their diatomic molecular structure.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; The halogens darken in colour as the group is descended: fluorine is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid that melts at −7.2&amp;nbsp;°C and boils at 58.8&amp;nbsp;°C. (Iodine is a shiny black solid.) This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; Specifically, the colour of a halogen, such as bromine, results from the [[atomic electron transition|electron transition]] between the [[HOMO/LUMO|highest occupied]] antibonding ''π&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding ''σ&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt;'' molecular orbital.&lt;ref name=Greenwood804&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 804–9&lt;/ref&gt; The colour fades at low temperatures, so that solid bromine at −195&amp;nbsp;°C is pale yellow.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt;

Like solid chlorine and iodine, solid bromine crystallises in the [[orthorhombic crystal system]], in a layered lattice of Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. The Br–Br distance is 227&amp;nbsp;pm (close to the gaseous Br–Br distance of 228&amp;nbsp;pm) and the Br···Br distance between molecules is 331&amp;nbsp;pm within a layer and 399&amp;nbsp;pm between layers (compare the van der Waals radius of bromine, 195&amp;nbsp;pm). This structure means that bromine is a very poor conductor of electricity, with a conductivity of around 5&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;Ω&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; just below the melting point, although this is better than the essentially undetectable conductivity of chlorine.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt;

At a pressure of 55&amp;nbsp;[[GPa]] (roughly 540,000 times atmospheric pressure) bromine undergoes an insulator-to-metal transition. At 75&amp;nbsp;GPa it changes to a face-centered orthorhombic structure. At 100&amp;nbsp;GPa it changes to a body centered orthorhombic monatomic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Duan, Defang|title = Ab initio studies of solid bromine under high pressure|journal = Physical Review B|volume = 76|date = 2007-09-26|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.76.104113|page = 104113|bibcode = 2007PhRvB..76j4113D|issue = 10 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of bromine}}
Bromine has two stable isotopes, &lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;Br and &lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;Br. These are its only two natural isotopes, with &lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;Br making up 51% of natural bromine and &lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;Br making up the remaining 49%. Both have nuclear spin 3/2− and thus may be used for [[nuclear magnetic resonance]], although &lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;Br is more favourable. The relatively 1:1 distribution of the two isotopes in nature is helpful in identification of bromine containing compounds using mass spectroscopy. Other bromine isotopes are all radioactive, with [[half-life|half-lives]] too short to occur in nature. Of these, the most important are &lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;Br (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 17.7&amp;nbsp;min), &lt;sup&gt;80m&lt;/sup&gt;Br (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.421&amp;nbsp;h), and &lt;sup&gt;82&lt;/sup&gt;Br (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 35.28&amp;nbsp;h), which may be produced from the [[neutron activation]] of natural bromine.&lt;ref name=Greenwood800/&gt; The most stable bromine radioisotope is &lt;sup&gt;77&lt;/sup&gt;Br (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1/2&lt;/sub&gt; = 57.04&amp;nbsp;h). The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than &lt;sup&gt;79&lt;/sup&gt;Br is [[electron capture]] to isotopes of [[selenium]]; that of isotopes heavier than &lt;sup&gt;81&lt;/sup&gt;Br is [[beta decay]] to isotopes of [[krypton]]; and &lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;Br may decay by either mode to stable &lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;Se or &lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;Kr.&lt;ref name=NUBASE&gt;{{cite journal|date=2003 |title=The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties |url=http://amdc.in2p3.fr/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720233206/http://amdc.in2p3.fr/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-20 |journal=[[Nuclear Physics A]] |volume=729 |issue=1 |pages=3–128 |doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001 |bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A |last1=Audi |first1=G. |last2=Bersillon |first2=O. |last3=Blachot |first3=J. |last4=Wapstra |first4=A.

Bromine is intermediate in reactivity between chlorine and iodine, and is one of the most reactive elements. Bond energies to bromine tend to be lower than those to chlorine but higher than those to iodine, and bromine is a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine but a stronger one than iodine. This can be seen from the [[standard electrode potential]]s of the X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; couples (F, +2.866&amp;nbsp;V; Cl, +1.395&amp;nbsp;V; Br, +1.087&amp;nbsp;V; I, +0.615&amp;nbsp;V; At, approximately +0.3&amp;nbsp;V). Bromination often leads to higher oxidation states than iodination but lower or equal oxidation states to chlorination. Bromine tends to react with compounds including M–M, M–H, or M–C bonds to form M–Br bonds.&lt;ref name=Greenwood804/&gt;

===Hydrogen bromide===
The simplest compound of bromine is [[hydrogen bromide]], HBr. It is mainly used in the production of inorganic [[bromide]]s and [[alkyl bromide]]s, and as a catalyst for many reactions in organic chemistry. Industrially, it is mainly produced by the reaction of [[hydrogen]] gas with bromine gas at 200–400&amp;nbsp;°C with a [[platinum]] catalyst. However, reduction of bromine with [[red phosphorus]] is a more practical way to produce hydrogen bromide in the laboratory:&lt;ref name=Greenwood809&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 809–12&lt;/ref&gt;
: 2 P + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 3 Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 6 HBr + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
: H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 HBr + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;

At room temperature, hydrogen bromide is a colourless gas, like all the hydrogen halides apart from [[hydrogen fluoride]], since hydrogen cannot form strong [[hydrogen bond]]s to the large and only mildly electronegative bromine atom; however, weak hydrogen bonding is present in solid crystalline hydrogen bromide at low temperatures, similar to the hydrogen fluoride structure, before disorder begins to prevail as the temperature is raised.&lt;ref name=Greenwood809/&gt; Aqueous hydrogen bromide is known as [[hydrobromic acid]], which is a strong acid (p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = −9) because the hydrogen bonds to bromine are too weak to inhibit dissociation. The HBr/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O system also involves many hydrates HBr·''n''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O for ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6, which are essentially salts of bromine [[anion]]s and [[hydronium]] [[cation]]s. Hydrobromic acid forms an [[azeotrope]] with boiling point 124.3&amp;nbsp;°C at 47.63&amp;nbsp;g HBr per 100&amp;nbsp;g solution; thus hydrobromic acid cannot be concentrated beyond this point by distillation.&lt;ref name=Greenwood812&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 812–6&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous liquid hydrogen bromide is difficult to work with as a solvent, because its boiling point is low, it has a small liquid range, its [[dielectric constant]] is low and it does not dissociate appreciably into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and {{chem|HBr|2|-}} ions – the latter, in any case, are much less stable than the [[bifluoride]] ions ({{chem|HF|2|-}}) due to the very weak hydrogen bonding between hydrogen and bromine, though its salts with very large and weakly polarising cations such as [[caesium|Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]] and [[quaternary ammonium cation|{{chem|NR|4|+}}]] (R = [[methyl group|Me]], [[ethyl group|Et]], [[butyl group|Bu&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;]]) may still be isolated. Anhydrous hydrogen bromide is a poor solvent, only able to dissolve small molecular compounds such as [[nitrosyl chloride]] and [[phenol]], or salts with very low [[lattice energy|lattice energies]] such as tetraalkylammonium halides.&lt;ref name=Greenwood812/&gt;

===Other binary bromides===
[[File:Bromid stříbrný.PNG|thumb|right|[[Silver bromide]] (AgBr)]]
Nearly all elements in the periodic table form binary bromides. The exceptions are decidedly in the minority and stem in each case from one of three causes: extreme inertness and reluctance to participate in chemical reactions (the [[noble gas]]es, with the exception of [[xenon]] in the very unstable XeBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;); extreme nuclear instability hampering chemical investigation before decay and transmutation (many of the heaviest elements beyond [[bismuth]]); and having an electronegativity higher than bromine's ([[oxygen]], [[nitrogen]], [[fluorine]], and [[chlorine]]), so that the resultant binary compounds are formally not bromides but rather oxides, nitrides, fluorides, or chlorides of bromine. (Nonetheless, [[nitrogen tribromide]] is named as a bromide as it is analogous to the other nitrogen trihalides.)&lt;ref name=Greenwood821&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 821–4&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromination of metals with Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; tends to yield lower oxidation states than chlorination with Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; when a variety of oxidation states is available. Bromides can be made by reaction of an element or its oxide, hydroxide, or carbonate with hydrobromic acid, and then dehydrated by mildly high temperatures combined with either low pressure or anhydrous hydrogen bromide gas. These methods work best when the bromide product is stable to hydrolysis; otherwise, the possibilities include high-temperature oxidative bromination of the element with bromine or hydrogen bromide, high-temperature bromination of a metal oxide or other halide by bromine, a volatile metal bromide, [[carbon tetrabromide]], or an organic bromide. For example, [[niobium(V) oxide]] reacts with carbon tetrabromide at 370&amp;nbsp;°C to form [[niobium(V) bromide]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt; Another method is halogen exchange in the presence of excess "halogenating reagent", for example:&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt;
:FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + BBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (excess) → FeBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + BCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
When a lower bromide is wanted, either a higher halide may be reduced using hydrogen or a metal as a reducing agent, or thermal decomposition or [[disproportionation]] may be used, as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt;
: 3 WBr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + Al {{overunderset|→|thermal gradient|475°C → 240°C}} 3 WBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + AlBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
: EuBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + {{sfrac|1|2}} H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → EuBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HBr
: 2 TaBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; {{overunderset|→|500°C|&amp;nbsp;}} TaBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + TaBr&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

Most of the bromides of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, along with the [[lanthanide]]s and [[actinide]]s in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular bromides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. [[Silver bromide]] is very insoluble in water and is thus often used as a qualitative test for bromine.&lt;ref name=Greenwood821/&gt;

===Bromine halides===
The halogens form many binary, [[diamagnetic]] [[interhalogen]] compounds with stoichiometries XY, XY&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, XY&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, and XY&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; (where X is heavier than Y), and bromine is no exception. Bromine forms a monofluoride and monochloride, as well as a trifluoride and pentafluoride. Some cationic and anionic derivatives are also characterised, such as {{chem|BrF|2|-}}, {{chem|BrCl|2|-}}, {{chem|BrF|2|+}}, {{chem|BrF|4|+}}, and {{chem|BrF|6|+}}. Apart from these, some [[pseudohalogen|pseudohalides]] are also known, such as [[cyanogen bromide]] (BrCN), bromine [[thiocyanate]] (BrSCN), and bromine [[azide]] (BrN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=Greenwood824&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 824–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The pale-brown [[bromine monofluoride]] (BrF) is unstable at room temperature, disproportionating quickly and irreversibly into bromine, bromine trifluoride, and bromine pentafluoride. It thus cannot be obtained pure.

At room temperature, [[bromine trifluoride]] (BrF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is a straw-coloured liquid. It may be formed by directly fluorinating bromine at room temperature and is purified through distillation. It reacts explosively with water and hydrocarbons, but is a less violent fluorinating reagent than [[chlorine trifluoride]]. It reacts vigorously with [[boron]], [[carbon]], [[silicon]], [[arsenic]], [[antimony]], iodine, and [[sulfur]] to give fluorides, and also reacts with most metals and their oxides: as such, it is used to oxidise [[uranium]] to [[uranium hexafluoride]] in the nuclear industry. Refractory oxides tend to be only partially fluorinated, but here the derivatives KBrF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and BrF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SbF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; remain reactive. Bromine trifluoride is a useful nonaqueous ionising solvent, since it readily dissociates to form {{chem|BrF|2|+}} and {{chem|BrF|4|-}} and thus conducts electricity.&lt;ref name=Greenwood828&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 828–31&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bromine pentafluoride]] (BrF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) was first synthesised in 1930. It is produced on a large scale by direct reaction of bromine with excess fluorine at temperatures higher than 150&amp;nbsp;°C, and on a small scale by the fluorination of [[potassium bromide]] at 25&amp;nbsp;°C. It is a very vigorous fluorinating agent, although chlorine trifluoride is still more violent. Bromine pentafluoride explodes on reaction with water and fluorinates silicates at 450&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=Greenwood832&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 832–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polybromine compounds===
Although dibromine is a strong oxidising agent with a high first ionisation energy, very strong oxidisers such as [[peroxydisulfuryl fluoride]] (S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) can oxidise it to form the cherry-red {{chem|Br|2|+}} cation. A few other bromine cations are known, namely the brown {{chem|Br|3|+}} and dark brown {{chem|Br|5|+}}.&lt;ref name=Greenwood842&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 842–4&lt;/ref&gt; The tribromide anion, {{chem|Br|3|-}}, has also been characterised; it is analogous to [[triiodide]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood824/&gt;

[[Bromine oxide]]s are not as well-characterised as [[chlorine oxide]]s or [[iodine oxide]]s, as they are all fairly unstable: it was once thought that they could not exist at all. [[Dibromine monoxide]] is a dark-brown solid which, while reasonably stable at −60&amp;nbsp;°C, decomposes at its melting point of −17.5&amp;nbsp;°C; it is useful in [[bromination]] reactions&lt;ref name="handin"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be made from the low-temperature decomposition of [[bromine dioxide]] in a vacuum. It oxidises iodine to [[iodine pentoxide]] and [[benzene]] to [[1,4-benzoquinone]]; in alkaline solutions, it gives the [[hypobromite]] anion.&lt;ref name=Greenwood850&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 850–1&lt;/ref&gt;

So-called "[[bromine dioxide]]", a pale yellow crystalline solid, may be better formulated as bromine [[perbromate]], BrOBrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is thermally unstable above −40&amp;nbsp;°C, violently decomposing to its elements at 0&amp;nbsp;°C. [[Dibromine trioxide]], ''syn''-BrOBrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is also known; it is the anhydride of [[hypobromous acid]] and [[bromic acid]]. It is an orange crystalline solid which decomposes above −40&amp;nbsp;°C; if heated too rapidly, it explodes around 0&amp;nbsp;°C. A few other unstable radical oxides are also known, as are some poorly characterised oxides, such as [[dibromine pentoxide]], tribromine octoxide, and bromine trioxide.&lt;ref name=Greenwood850/&gt;

The four [[oxoacid]]s, [[hypobromous acid]] (HOBr), [[bromous acid]] (HOBrO), [[bromic acid]] (HOBrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[perbromic acid]] (HOBrO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), are better studied due to their greater stability, though they are only so in aqueous solution. When bromine dissolves in aqueous solution, the following reactions occur:&lt;ref name=Greenwood853&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 853–9&lt;/ref&gt;

Hypobromous acid is unstable to disproportionation. The [[hypobromite]] ions thus formed disproportionate readily to give bromide and bromate:&lt;ref name=Greenwood853/&gt;

Bromous acids and [[bromite]]s are very unstable, although the [[strontium]] and [[barium]] bromites are known.&lt;ref name=Greenwood862&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 862–5&lt;/ref&gt; More important are the [[bromate]]s, which are prepared on a small scale by oxidation of bromide by aqueous [[hypochlorite]], and are strong oxidising agents. Unlike chlorates, which very slowly disproportionate to chloride and perclorate, the bromate anion is stable to disproportionation in both acidic and aqueous solutions. Bromic acid is a strong acid. Bromides and bromates may comproportionate to bromine as follows:&lt;ref name=Greenwood862/&gt;
:{{chem|BrO|3|-}} + 5 Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + 6 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → 3 Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

There were many failed attempts to obtain perbromates and perbromic acid, leading to some rationalisations as to why they should not exist, until 1968 when the anion was first synthesised from the radioactive [[beta decay]] of unstable {{chem|83|Se|O|4|2-}}. Today, perbromates are produced by the oxidation of alkaline bromate solutions by fluorine gas. Excess bromate and fluoride are precipitated as [[silver bromate]] and [[calcium fluoride]], and the perbromic acid solution may be purified. The perbromate ion is fairly inert at room temperature but is thermodynamically extremely oxidising, with extremely strong oxidising agents needed to produce it, such as fluorine or [[xenon difluoride]]. The Br–O bond in {{chem|BrO|4|-}} is fairly weak, which corresponds to the general reluctance of the 4p elements (especially [[arsenic]], [[selenium]], and bromine) to attain their maximum possible oxidation state, as they come after the [[scandide contraction]] characterised by the poor shielding afforded by the radial-nodeless 3d orbitals.&lt;ref name=Greenwood871&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 871–2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organobromine compounds===
{{main|Organobromine compound}}
[[File:N-Bromosuccinimide.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.7|Structure of [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-bromosuccinimide]], a common brominating reagent in organic chemistry]]
Like the other carbon–halogen bonds, the C–Br bond is a common functional group that forms part of core [[organic chemistry]]. Formally, compounds with this functional group may be considered organic derivatives of the bromide anion. Due to the difference of electronegativity between bromine (2.96) and carbon (2.55), the carbon in a C–Br bond is electron-deficient and thus [[electrophilic]]. The reactivity of organobromine compounds resembles but is intermediate between the reactivity of [[organochlorine compound|organochlorine]] and [[organoiodine compound]]s.  For many applications, organobromides represent a compromise of reactivity and cost.&lt;ref name=KO/&gt;

Organobromides are typically produced by additive or substitutive bromination of other organic precursors. Bromine itself can be used, but due to its toxicity and volatility safer brominating reagents are normally used, such as [[N-Bromosuccinimide|''N''-bromosuccinimide]]. The principal reactions for organobromides include [[dehydrohalogenation|dehydrobromination]], [[Grignard reaction]]s, [[Wurtz reaction|reductive coupling]], and [[nucleophilic substitution]].&lt;ref name=KO&gt;Ioffe, David and Kampf, Arieh (2002) "Bromine, Organic Compounds" in ''Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology''. John Wiley &amp; Sons. {{DOI| 10.1002/0471238961.0218151325150606.a01}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Organobromides are the most common organohalides in nature, even though the concentration of bromide is only 0.3% of that for chloride in sea water, because of the easy oxidation of bromide to the equivalent of Br&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, a potent electrophile. The enzyme [[bromoperoxidase]] catalyzes this reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ja047925p|pmid=15548002|title=Vanadium Bromoperoxidase-Catalyzed Biosynthesis of Halogenated Marine Natural Products|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|volume=126|issue=46|pages=15060–6|year=2004|last1=Carter-Franklin|first1=Jayme N.|last2=Butler|first2=Alison}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The oceans are estimated to release 1–2 million tons of [[bromoform]] and 56,000 tons of [[bromomethane]] annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/a900201d|title=The diversity of naturally occurring organobromine compounds|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|volume=28|issue=5|pages=335–346|year=1999|last1=Gribble|first1=Gordon W.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Alkene-bromine-addition-2D-skeletal.png|upright=1.8|thumb|right|Bromine addition to alkene reaction mechanism]]
An old qualitative test for the presence of the [[alkene]] functional group is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a [[halohydrin|bromohydrin]] with some of the dibromoalkane also produced. The reaction passes through a short-lived strongly electrophilic [[halonium ion|bromonium]] intermediate. This is an example of a [[halogen addition reaction]].&lt;ref name=Clayden&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Clayden | first1 = Jonathan | authorlink1 = Jonathan Clayden | last2 = Greeves | first2 = Nick | last3 = Warren | first3 = Stuart | authorlink3 = Stuart Warren | title = Organic Chemistry | edition = 2nd | publisher = Oxford University Press | date = 2012 | isbn = 978-0-19-927029-3 |pages=427–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence and production==
[[File:STS028-96-65.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.15|View of salt evaporation pans on the Dead Sea, where Jordan (right) and Israel (left) produce salt and bromine {{Coord|31|9|0|N|35|27|0|E|type:adm2nd}}]]
Bromine is significantly less abundant in the crust than fluorine or chlorine, comprising only 2.5&amp;nbsp;[[parts per million]] of the Earth's crustal rocks, and then only as bromide salts. It is the forty-sixth most abundant element in Earth's crust. It is significantly more abundant in the oceans, resulting from long-term [[Leaching (chemical science)|leaching]]. There, it makes up 65&amp;nbsp;parts per million, corresponding to a ratio of about one bromine atom for every 660 chlorine atoms. Salt lakes and brine wells may have higher bromine concentrations: for example, the [[Dead Sea]] contains 0.4% bromide ions.&lt;ref name=Greenwood795&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 795–6&lt;/ref&gt; It is from these sources that bromine extraction is mostly economically feasible.&lt;ref name=o1&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Minerals From Sea Salt|first = John A.|last = Tallmadge|author2 = Butt, John B.|author3 = Solomon Herman J.|journal = Ind.

The main sources of bromine are in the [[United States]] and [[Israel]]. The element is liberated by halogen exchange, using chlorine gas to oxidise Br&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; to Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This is then removed with a blast of steam or air, and is then condensed and purified. Today, bromine is transported in large-capacity metal drums or lead-lined tanks that can hold hundreds of kilograms or even tonnes of bromine. The bromine industry is about one-hundredth the size of the chlorine industry. Laboratory production is unnecessary because bromine is commercially available and has a long shelf life.&lt;ref name=Greenwood798&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, pp. 798–9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
A wide variety of organobromine compounds are used in [[industry]]. Some are prepared from bromine and others are prepared from [[hydrogen bromide]], which is obtained by burning [[hydrogen]] in bromine.&lt;ref name="Ullmann"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Mills, Jack F.  |title=Bromine: in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|publisher= Wiley-VCH Verlag|location= Weinheim|date= 2002|doi=10.1002/14356007.a04_391|chapter=Bromine|isbn=978-3527306732}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flame retardants===
[[File:Tetrabromobisphenol A.svg|thumb|right|Tetrabromobisphenol A]]

[[Brominated flame retardant]]s represent a commodity of growing importance, and make up the largest commercial use of bromine. When the brominated material burns, the flame retardant produces [[hydrobromic acid]] which interferes in the radical [[chain reaction]] of the [[oxidation]] reaction of the fire. The mechanism is that the highly reactive hydrogen radicals, oxygen radicals, and hydroxy radicals react with hydrobromic acid to form less reactive bromine radicals (i.e., free bromine atoms). Bromine atoms may also react directly with other radicals to help terminate the free radical chain-reactions that characterise combustion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Journal of Fire Sciences|volume = 14|pages = 426–442| date = 1996|doi = 10.1177/073490419601400602|title = Mechanisms for Flame Retardancy and Smoke suppression – A Review|first =Joseph|last = Green|issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Polymer Degradation and Stability|volume = 77|date = 2002|pages = 325–331| doi = 10.1016/S0141-3910(02)00067-8|title = Fire retardant mechanism of aliphatic bromine compounds in polystyrene and polypropylene|first = Jelle|last = Kaspersma|author2 = Doumena, Cindy|author3 = Munrob Sheilaand|author4 = Prinsa, Anne-Marie|issue = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To make brominated polymers and plastics, bromine-containing compounds can be incorporated into the polymer during [[polymerisation]]. One method is to include a relatively small amount of brominated monomer during the polymerisation process. For example, [[vinyl bromide]] can be used in the production of [[polyethylene]], [[polyvinyl chloride]] or [[polypropylene]]. Specific highly brominated molecules can also be added that participate in the polymerisation process For example, [[tetrabromobisphenol A]] can be added to [[polyester]]s or epoxy resins, where it becomes part of the polymer. Epoxys used in [[printed circuit board]]s are normally made from such flame retardant [[resin]]s, indicated by the FR in the abbreviation of the products ([[FR-4]] and [[FR-2]]). In some cases the bromine containing compound may be added after polymerisation. For example, [[decabromodiphenyl ether]] can be added to the final polymers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Journal of Fire Sciences|volume = 22|pages = 25–40| date = 2004|doi = 10.1177/0734904104038107|title = A Review of Current Flame Retardant Systems for Epoxy Resins|first = Edward D.|last = Weil|author2=Levchik, Sergei}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of gaseous or highly volatile brominated [[halomethane]] compounds are non-toxic and make superior fire suppressant agents by this same mechanism, and are particular effective in enclosed spaces such as submarines, airplanes, and spacecraft. However, they are expensive and their production and use has been greatly curtailed due to their effect as ozone-depleting agents. They are no longer used in routine fire extinguishers, but retain niche uses in aerospace and military automatic fire-suppression applications. They include [[bromochloromethane]] (Halon 1011, CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BrCl), [[bromochlorodifluoromethane]] (Halon 1211, CBrClF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and [[bromotrifluoromethane]] (Halon 1301, CBrF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name=UllmannF&gt;Günter Siegemund, Werner Schwertfeger, Andrew Feiring, Bruce Smart, Fred Behr, Herward Vogel, Blaine McKusick "Fluorine Compounds, Organic" Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a11_349}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses===
[[Silver bromide]] is used, either alone or in combination with [[silver chloride]] and [[silver iodide]], as the light sensitive constituent of photographic emulsions.&lt;ref name=Greenwood798/&gt;

[[1,2-Dibromoethane|Ethylene bromide]] was an [[Gasoline additive|additive in gasolines]] containing lead anti-[[engine knocking]] agents. It scavenges lead by forming volatile lead bromide, which is exhausted from the engine. This application accounted for 77% of the bromine use in 1966 in the US. This application has declined since the 1970s due to environmental regulations (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal = Environment International|volume = 29|date = 2003| doi = 10.1016/S0160-4120(03)00121-1|title = An overview of commercially used brominated flame retardants, their applications, their use patterns in different countries/regions and possible modes of release|first = Mehran|last = Alaeea|author2 = Ariasb, Pedro|author3 = Sjödinc, Andreas|author4 = Bergman, Åke|issue = 6|pmid=12850087|pages = 683–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poisonous [[bromomethane]] was widely used as [[pesticide]] to [[Fumigation|fumigate]] soil and to fumigate housing, by the tenting method. Ethylene bromide was similarly used.&lt;ref name="USGSYB2007" /&gt; These volatile organobromine compounds are all now regulated as [[ozone depletion]] agents. The [[Montreal Protocol|Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer]] scheduled the phase out for the [[ozone depleting]] chemical by 2005, and organobromide pesticides are no longer used (in housing fumigation they have been replaced by such compounds as [[sulfuryl fluoride]], which contain neither the chlorine or bromine organics which harm ozone). Before the Montreal protocol in 1991 (for example) an estimated 35,000 tonnes of the chemical were used to control [[nematode]]s, [[fungi]], [[weed]]s and other soil-borne diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Alternatives to Methyl Bromide for the Control of Soil-Borne Diseases and Pests in California|first = Belinda|last = Messenger|author2 = Braun, Adolf|date = 2000|publisher = Pest Management Analysis and Planning Program|url = http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/emon/methbrom/alt-anal/sept2000.pdf|accessdate = 2008-11-17|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100421041145/http://www.cdpr.ca.gov/docs/emon/methbrom/alt-anal/sept2000.pdf#|archive-date = 2010-04-21|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Economics of the "Critical Use" of Methyl bromide under the Montreal Protocol|doi = 10.1093/cep/byi028|journal =Contemporary Economic Policy|volume = 23|pages = 376–393|date = 2008|first = Stephen J.|last = Decanio|author2=Norman, Catherine S.|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''pharmacology''', inorganic [[bromide]] compounds, especially [[potassium bromide]], were frequently used as general sedatives in the 19th and early 20th century. Bromides in the form of simple salts are still used as anticonvulsants in both veterinary and human medicine, although the latter use varies from country to country. For example, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) does not approve bromide for the treatment of any disease, and it was removed from over-the-counter sedative products like [[Bromo-Seltzer]], in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Samuel Hopkins Adams|title=The Great American fraud|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fd_S2Van52EC|accessdate=2011-06-25 |date=1905|publisher=Press of the American Medical Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commercially available organobromine pharmaceuticals include the vasodilator [[nicergoline]], the sedative [[brotizolam]], the anticancer agent [[pipobroman]], and the antiseptic [[merbromin]].  Otherwise, organobromine compounds are rarely pharmaceutically useful, in contrast to the situation for [[organofluorine chemistry|organofluorine compounds]].  Several drugs are produced as the bromide (or equivalents, hydrobromide) salts, but in such cases bromide serves as an innocuous counterion of no biological significance.&lt;ref name=KO/&gt;

Other uses of organobromine compounds include high-density drilling fluids, dyes (such as [[Tyrian purple]] and the indicator [[bromothymol blue]]), and pharmaceuticals. Bromine itself, as well as some of its compounds, are used in water treatment, and is the precursor of a variety of inorganic compounds with an enormous number of applications (e.g. [[silver bromide]] for photography).&lt;ref name=Greenwood798/&gt; [[Zinc–bromine battery|Zinc–bromine batteries]] are hybrid [[Flow battery|flow batteries]] used for stationary electrical power backup and storage; from household scale to industrial scale.

A 2014 study suggests that bromine (in the form of bromide ion) is a necessary cofactor in the biosynthesis of [[collagen IV]], making the element [[essential element|essential]] to [[basement membrane]] architecture and tissue development in animals.&lt;ref name="pmid24906154"&gt;{{Cite journal| display-authors = 5| author = McCall AS| author2 = Cummings CF| author3 = Bhave G| author4 = Vanacore R| author5 = Page-McCaw A| author6 = Hudson BG|title = Bromine Is an Essential Trace Element for Assembly of Collagen IV Scaffolds in Tissue Development and Architecture|journal = Cell|volume = 157|issue = 6|pages = 1380–92|date = 2014|pmid = 24906154|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2014.05.009| pmc=4144415}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, no clear deprivation symptoms or syndromes have been documented.&lt;ref name="Nielsen2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nielsen|first1=Forrest H.|title=Possibly Essential Trace Elements|year=2000|pages=11–36|url=http://handle.nal.usda.gov/10113/45649 |doi=10.1007/978-1-59259-040-7_2|journal=Clinical Nutrition of the Essential Trace Elements and Minerals|isbn=978-1-61737-090-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other biological functions, bromine may be non-essential but still beneficial when it takes the place of chlorine.

Eosinophil peroxidase is a [[haloperoxidase]] that preferentially uses bromide over chloride for this purpose, generating [[hypobromite]] ([[hypobromous acid]]), although the use of chloride is possible.&lt;ref name="pmid2538427"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Mayeno AN| author2 = Curran AJ| author3 = Roberts RL| author4 =  Foote CS|title = Eosinophils preferentially use bromide to generate halogenating agents|journal = J.

Although α-haloesters are generally thought of as highly reactive, and therefore, toxic intermediates in organic synthesis, mammals, including humans, cats, and rats, appear to biosynthesize traces of an α-bromoester, 2-octyl 4-bromo-3-oxobutanoate, which is found in their [[cerebrospinal fluid]] and appears to play a yet unclarified role in inducing REM sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gribble|first=Gordon W.|date=1999-01-01|title=The diversity of naturally occurring organobromine compounds|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1999/cs/a900201d/unauth#!divAbstract|journal=Chemical Society Reviews|language=en|volume=28|issue=5|pages=335–346|doi=10.1039/A900201D|issn=1460-4744|bibcode=2012ChSRv..41.6507P}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human neutrophils use myeloperoxidase, H2O2, and Br(-) to brominate deoxycytidine, which is a mutagen, so transhalogenation reactions with bromine may be responsible for some human cancers. &lt;ref name="pmid11096071"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Henderson JP| author2 = Byun J| author3 = Williams MV| author4 =  Mueller DM|title = Production of brominating intermediates by myeloperoxidase.|journal = J.

The bromide anion is not very toxic: a normal daily intake is 2 to 8&amp;nbsp;milligrams.&lt;ref name=Nielsen2000/&gt; However, high levels of bromide chronically impair the membrane of neurons, which progressively impairs neuronal transmission, leading to toxicity, known as [[bromism]]. Bromide has an [[elimination half-life]] of 9 to 12 days, which can lead to excessive accumulation. Doses of 0.5 to 1&amp;nbsp;gram per day of bromide can lead to bromism. Historically, the therapeutic dose of bromide is about 3 to 5&amp;nbsp;grams of bromide, thus explaining why chronic toxicity (bromism) was once so common. While significant and sometimes serious disturbances occur to neurologic, psychiatric, dermatological, and gastrointestinal functions, death from bromism is rare.&lt;ref name=pdo2003&gt;{{cite book |last1=Olson |first1=Kent R. |title=Poisoning &amp; drug overdose |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vuec3nTovyUC |edition=4th |date=1 November 2003 |publisher=Appleton &amp; Lange |isbn=978-0-8385-8172-8 |pages=140–141 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bromism is caused by a neurotoxic effect on the brain which results in [[somnolence]], [[psychosis]], [[seizures]] and [[delirium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Galanter |first1=Marc |last2=Kleber |first2=Herbert D. |title=The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6wdJgejlQzYC |edition=4th |date=1 July 2008 |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing Inc |location=United States of America |isbn=978-1-58562-276-4 |page=217 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Elemental bromine is toxic and causes [[chemical burns]] on human flesh. Inhaling bromine gas results in similar irritation of the respiratory tract, causing coughing, choking, and shortness of breath, and death if inhaled in large enough amounts. Chronic exposure may lead to frequent bronchial infections and a general deterioration of health. As a strong oxidising agent, bromine is incompatible with most organic and inorganic compounds.&lt;ref name=msds&gt;

A '''curb box''' (also known as a '''valve box''', '''buffalo box''', or '''b-box''') is a vertical cast iron sleeve, accessible from the public way, housing the shut-off [[valve]] (curb cock or curb stop) for a property's water service line. It is typically located between a building and the district's [[water main]] lines and usually consists of a metal tube with a removable or sliding lid, allowing access to the turn-key within.  It typically serves as the point denoting the separation of utility-maintained and privately-maintained water facilities.

A curb box is often called a "Buffalo Box", because it originated in [[Buffalo, New York]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9218">The '''cam-in-block''' [[valvetrain]] layout of [[piston engine]]s is one where the [[camshaft]] is placed within the [[cylinder block]], usually beside and slightly above the [[crankshaft]] in a [[straight engine]] or directly above the crankshaft in the V of a [[V engine]]. This contrasts with an [[overhead camshaft]] (OHC) design which places the camshafts within the cylinder head and drives the valves directly or through short rocker arms. 

Placing the camshaft inside the engine block has a long history in its use in valve-in-block engines, in straight and V configurations, the [[Ford Flathead engine|Ford flathead]] being exemplary of the type. Pushrod overhead valve engines with the cam in the block were long used in Chevrolet and Buick straight engines from the 1930s through the mid-1950s and in various similar six-cylinder engines until the extensive employment of the V6 configuration in the 1980s. 

There are three main cam-in-block designs:
* L-head, also known as ''L-block'', ''flathead'' or ''sidevalve''
* F-head
* I-head, also known as [[overhead valve]] (OHV)

==L-head==
{{main|Flathead engine}}
[[Image:Side-valve engine with Ricardo's turbulent head 01.png|thumb|L-head engine with Ricardo's turbulent head]]
L-head (''flathead'') refers to the pushrod valvetrain configuration in which the [[poppet valve|valves]] are placed in the engine block beside the [[piston]]s. The design was common on early engine designs, but has since fallen from use.

Generally L-head engines use a small chamber on one side of the cylinder to carry the valves. This has a number of advantages, primarily in that it makes the cylinder head much simpler. It also means that the valve can be operated by pushing directly up on it, as opposed to needing some sort of mechanical arrangement to push the valves down. It may also lead to slightly easier cooling, as the valves and operating rods are out of the way of the cylinder, making a cooling jacket simpler to construct (but see below). The line of intakes along the side of the engine lead to the name L-head, due to the cylinders having the shape of an upside-down L. This configuration is also known as [[Ford Sidevalve|sidevalve]], as the valves are located be''side'' the cylinders.

On the downside, the L-head engine also requires the airflow to make at least a 90° turn to enter the cylinder, which makes it less efficient; colloquially it's said that such an engine has poorer "breathing". Breathing was not greatly emphasized in past production cars because engines could not run long and reliably at high speed due to other factors. This was a minor concern given the benefits in simplicity.

Although L-head inline 4 and 6-cylinder engines were frequently used for automobiles, tractors, etc., the best known L-head automotive engine is the [[Ford Flathead engine|early 20th century Ford V-8]], which has both sets of valves (intake and exhaust) located on the inside of the "Vee," and which are all operated by a single [[camshaft]] located above the crankshaft. The exhaust follows a lengthy path to leave the engine. This virtually guarantees that the engine will need an unusually large coolant radiator to avoid overheating under sustained heavy use.  A flathead design in a V engine, with the air intake/fuel system and all of the exhaust and intake valves inside of the "V" requires that the exhaust gas be passed between the cylinders to outside of the V to the exhaust system.  Exhaust heat is thus passed to the coolant (as it exits the engine between the cylinders).   In the Ford V-8 flathead design, manufactured from 1932 through 1952, the center exhaust port on the outside of the block exhausts the gasses from two cylinders, exacerbating the high heat problem. This "very hot in the middle" problem makes this particular engine prone to heat-related stress and cracks in the cylinder block. In line engine exhaust gas exits the block more directly and does not cross between the cylinders and is a more temperature-stable design.  Whenever exhaust ports and valves are in the cylinder head, exhausting heat has far less time to heat the coolant, and such engines are more durable under high load conditions and a similar sized engine will require less coolant radiator capacity than a flathead V-8.     

Due to the heating and efficiency problems, L-head engines fell from high power uses such as [[aircraft engine]]s fairly quickly, prior to [[World War I]]. They lived on for some time in the automotive world and were used in the [[World War II]] [[Jeep]], for instance. L-heads are no longer used in [[automobile]] engines, although they remain in common use for small-engine applications in lawnmowers and generators. Because of their heat-retaining design, the size of valves and the [[compression ratio]] are limited (the valve/combustion chamber is away from the piston top typically creating a larger combustion space--a lower compression ratio), which in turn reduces available power and economy.  Not all L-heads are cam-in-block engines; the location of the camshaft varies in this layout.

T-head flathead engines have a [[crossflow cylinder head|crossflow]] layout, with the exhaust valves on the opposite side from the inlet valves. A [[single cylinder engine|single-cylinde]]r T-head engine needs only a single camshaft; multi-cylinder T-heads need two.

==I-head==
:{{main|Pushrod engine}}
The I-head design is one in which the entry and exit [[poppet valve|valves]] and ports are contained in the [[cylinder head]]. It was developed by the [[Scottish-American]] [[David Dunbar Buick]]. It employed [[pushrod]]-actuated valves [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the [[piston]]s and is still in use today in some designs (notably several engines produced by [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and [[Chrysler]]). 

It has several advantages over L- and F-head designs, but the most notable is the fact that the intake charge and exhaust gases have a more direct path into and out of the combustion chambers, increasing power, improving fuel efficiency and reducing noxious exhaust emissions.

==F-head==
:{{main|F-Head Engine}}
The F-head layout (not to be confused with flathead) can be thought of as a combination of L-head and I-head: the intake manifold and its valves are located atop the cylinders (in the cylinder head, as in an I-head design) and are operated by pushrods, but the exhaust manifold and its valves are located beside the cylinders (in the block, as in an L-head design). The exhaust valves are either roughly or exactly parallel with the pistons; their faces point upwards and they are not operated by pushrods, but by direct contact with a lifter contacting the camshaft. Reverse variation of F-head with side intake and in head exhaust were also made- the Ford V8 overhead exhaust valve conversions to flathead engines were to decrease the overheating under load problems in commercial service.  The Indian/Henderson 4-cylinder motorcycle engine family used both designs- the overhead exhaust was again an overheating consideration design. 

This was a more expensive engine design. Its advantages over competing L-head engines included more power from its higher compression, better intake mixture flow, less susceptibility to pinging, and greater reliability from its cooling of the exhaust valve and its spring (and having half the number of pushrods of an OHV engine). With only one valve in the head, and one in the block, larger valves can be used than in an OHV engine, to offset the poorer airflow of a side exhaust valve.

For years the British motor car firms [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] and [[Rover Company|Rover]] used this arrangement. From 1927 to 1929, the American firm [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson]] used a 6-cylinder engine of this form as well, but this engine is not to be confused with that of the race-winning Hudsons of the 1950s. The last major use was the [[Willys Hurricane engine]], used in civilian Jeeps in the 1950s and 1960s. It was replaced by the I-head design.

Like his more famous contemporaries [[Michael Faraday]] and [[Joseph Henry]], Page began his career as an astute [[natural philosopher]] who developed innovative work with natural phenomena through direct observation and experimenting. Toward the later part of their careers, the science of the day had moved on to a more mathematical emphasis in which these scientists did not participate.

Through his exploratory experiments and distinctive inventions, Page developed a deep understanding of [[electromagnetism]]. He applied this understanding in the service of the US Patent Office, in support of other inventors, and in pursuing his own ill-fated dream of electromagnetic locomotion. His work had a lasting impact on [[telegraphy]] and in the practice and politics of patenting scientific innovation, challenging the rising scientific elitism that maintained 'the scientific do not patent'.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family life==
Charles Grafton Page was born to Captain Jere Lee Page and Lucy Lang Page on January 25, 1812 in Salem, Massachusetts. Having eight siblings, four of each gender, he was the only one of five sons to pursue a career into mature adulthood. One of his brothers died in infancy. Brother George died from typhoid at age sixteen, brother Jery perished on a sea expedition to the Caribbean at age twenty-five, and Henry, afflicted by poliomyelitis, was not able to support himself. In writing to Charles Grafton during his final voyage, Jery expressed the family’s hope for his success: "You are the only classical Page in our book."&lt;ref&gt;Post, (1976a). Quote p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Page's curiosity about electricity was evident from childhood. At age nine, he climbed on top of his parents' house with a fire-shovel in an attempt to catch electricity during a thunderstorm. At age ten, he built an electrostatic machine that he used to shock his friends.&lt;ref&gt;(Lane), (1869).&lt;/ref&gt; At sixteen, Page developed the "portable electrophorus," which served as the foundation for his first published article in the ''American Journal of Science''(Page, 1834).

Other early interests, including [[botany]], [[entomology]] (Page, 1836b), and [[floriculture]], contributed to his scientific training and later avocations.&lt;ref&gt;Post, (1976a), p. 144-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from medical school, Page continued to reside in his parents' Salem home and opened a small medical practice. In a well-stocked lab that he set up there, he experimented with electricity, demonstrated effects that no one had observed before, and improvised original apparatus that amplified these effects.&lt;ref&gt;(Lane) (1869), p. 3; Cavicchi, (2008), p. 893.&lt;/ref&gt;

When his father retired from a successful career as a sea captain in trade with East India, Page joined his family in relocating to rural Virginia outside Washington DC.&lt;ref&gt;Post,(1976a), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Page married Priscilla Sewall Webster in 1844. Priscilla was the younger sister of the wife of a Washington physician, Harvey Lindsly, who was among Page's colleagues. One son died in infancy. The couple brought up three sons and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;(Lane) (1869), p. 17;Post,(1976a). p. 137,160.&lt;/ref&gt; Their oldest daughter, Emelyn or Emmie, died less than a year before Page's own death.&lt;ref&gt;Post,(1976a), p. 63-5; 177&lt;/ref&gt; Their youngest son, [[Harvey L. Page|Harvey Lindsly Page]] (1859–1934), was named for his uncle. He was a famous American architect and inventor, of San Antonio, Texas. http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fpa75

==Career==
Page pursued undergraduate studies at [[Harvard College]] from 1828–1832, studying chemistry under Professor John White Webster. A classmate at Salem Latin School who also attended college and medical school with him, Henry Wheatland described Page as popular, fun-loving, athletic, a fine singer and "a loved companion". Page participated in organizing a college chemical club where he demonstrated electricity and other phenomena. After receiving an M.D. from [[Harvard Medical School]] in 1836, he practiced medicine and gave public lectures on chemistry in Salem.&lt;ref&gt;(Lane) (1869), p. 2-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Page moved to northern Virginia in 1838, he continued his experimental research and set up a medical practice which he sustained for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Post,(1976a), p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Page served as a patent examiner in the United States Patent Office in Washington, D.C. for two periods: 1842-1852 and 1861-1868. He became senior patent examiner during his first term. During the years intervening, he took up a business as a patent agent or solicitor to help other inventors secure patents, established and edited the short-lived ''The American Polytechnic Journal'', and pursued his own interests in electromagnetism, floriculture and other areas.&lt;ref&gt;(Lane) (1869), p. 1-2; Post (1976a), p. 46, 142-145.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a patent agent, Page handled up to 50 successful patents a year, including patents for [[Eben Norton Horsford]], [[Walter Hunt (inventor)|Walter Hunt]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt; Page's 1861 return to the Patent Agency as an examiner occurred in the wake of numerous dismissals of patent office employees under the new Administration of [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a, p. 163-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

Page figured as a key witness in the Morse v. O'Reilly telegraph lawsuit of 1848.&lt;ref&gt;Post,(1976a), p. 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when Morse sought an extension of his patent on telegraph apparatus twelve years later, Page refuted Morse's role as inventor and was perhaps influential in the extensions' denial.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a, p. 164-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1844-1849, Page was Professor of Chemistry and [Pharmacy] in the Medical Department at Columbian College in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;(Lane) (1869), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; (now [[George Washington University]]).
 
He held other public roles such as that of advising the choice of stone to be used in constructing the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and the [[Washington Monument]] to the committees in charge of these projects.&lt;ref&gt;Post,(1976a), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his life, Page published more than one-hundred articles over the course of three distinct periods: the late 1830s, the mid-1840s, and the early 1850s. The first period (1837–1840) was especially crucial in developing his analytic skills. Over 40 of his articles appeared in the ''American Journal of Science'' edited by [[Benjamin Silliman]]; some of these were reprinted at the time in [[William Sturgeon]]’s ''Annals of Electricity, Magnetism, and Chemistry'' printed in Great Britain. The ''Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Papers'' (1800–1863 volume) records many of Page's papers, however this listing is incomplete, as is that provided in (Post, 1976a, p.&amp;nbsp;207-213).

==Scientific accomplishments==
While still a medical student at Harvard, Page conducted a ground-breaking experiment which demonstrated the presence of electricity in an arrangement of a spiral conductor that no one had tried before. His experiment was a response to a short paper by Joseph Henry, announcing that a strong [[electric shock]] was obtained from a ribbon strip of copper, spiralled up between fabric insulation, at the moment when battery current stopped running in this conductor.&lt;ref&gt;Henry, 1835.&lt;/ref&gt; These strong shocks manifested the electrical property of self-[[inductance]] which Faraday had identified  in researches published prior to Henry's,&lt;ref&gt;Faraday, 1835.&lt;/ref&gt; building on his own landmark discovery of [[electromagnetic induction]].&lt;ref&gt;Faraday, 1831.&lt;/ref&gt;  Page seemed to be unaware of 
Faraday's analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Cavicchi, 2008, p. 893.&lt;/ref&gt;

Page's innovation was to construct a spiral conductor having cups filled with [[mercury (element)]] as electrical connectors that were placed at various positions along its length.  He then connected one terminal from an [[electrochemical cell]] battery to the inner cup of the spiral, and put the other battery terminal into some other cup of the spiral. The direct battery current flowed through the spiral, from cup to cup. He held a metal wand in each hand, and put these wands into the same two cups as where the battery terminals went — or any other pair of cups. When an assistant removed one of the battery terminals, stopping the current from going in the spiral, Page received a shock. He reported stronger shocks when his hands covered more of the spiral's length than where direct battery current went. He even felt shocks from parts of the spiral where no direct battery current passed. He used [[acupuncture]] needles, pierced into his fingers, to amplify his sense of shock.&lt;ref&gt;Page, 1836a, 1837a; Cavicchi, 2005, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:CGPagespiral.jpg|thumb|left|Side view of Page’s 1837 spiral, showing connector cups spaced across its length.&lt;ref&gt;Page, 1837a, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
While Page advocated the use of this shocking device as a medical treatment, an early form of [[electrotherapy]],&lt;ref&gt;Page, 1836a, 1837a; Cavicchi, 2005, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; his own interest lay in its heightening of electrical tension, or [[voltage]] above that of the low voltage battery input, and in its other electrical behaviors.  Page went on to improve the instrument, giving it the name 'Dynamic Multiplier'.&lt;ref&gt;Page, 1837b.&lt;/ref&gt;

In order for Page's instrument to produce the shock, the battery current had to be stopped. In order to experience another shock, the battery had to be started again, and then stopped. Page invented the first [[interrupter]]s, to provide a repeatable means of connecting and disconnecting the circuit.  In these devices, electrical flow is started and stopped as a rocking or rotary motion lifts electrical contacts out of a mercury pool. An [[electric motor]] effect is responsible for the continued operation of the switch.&lt;ref&gt;Page, 1837a, 1837b; Cavicchi, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crucial to Page's research with the spiral conductor was his capacity to explore and question the unknown, where the physical effects were enigmatic and the 'received theories'&lt;ref&gt;Page, 1837a, 139&lt;/ref&gt; inadequate. Page did not provide an explanation for what he found, yet he extended and amplified the apparatus and its unexpected behaviors.  A recent reconstruction of Page's experiment corroborates the central role of ambiguity in his work, finding:
{{quote|A key strategy in working productively with ambiguity lies in opening up multiple possibilities, entry points, and perspectives, as Page did by soldering intermediate [cups] into his spiral.|(Cavicchi, 2008, p. 906.).}}
Page's publication about his spiral instrument was well received in the American science community and in England, putting him into the upper ranks of American science at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Fleming, 1892; Post, 1976a.&lt;/ref&gt;

British experimenter William Sturgeon reprinted Page's article in his journal ''Annals of Electricity''. Sturgeon provided an analysis of the electromagnetic effect involved;&lt;ref&gt;Sturgeon, 1837.&lt;/ref&gt; Page drew on and expanded Sturgeon's analysis in his own later work. Sturgeon devised coils that were adaptations of Page's instrument, where battery current flowed through one, inner, segment of a coil, and electrical shock was taken from the entire length of a coil.&lt;ref&gt;Cavicchi, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the input from Sturgeon, as well as his own continuing researches, Page developed coil instruments that were the foundation for the eventual [[induction coil]].&lt;ref&gt;Cavicchi, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  These instruments had two wires. One wire, termed the ''primary'', carried battery current; a shock was taken across the ends of the other much longer wire, termed the ''secondary'' (see [[transformer]]). The primary wire was wound concentrically over an iron core; the secondary was wound over that. Page developed a deep understanding of the underlying behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Page, 1838a, 1838b, 1838c&lt;/ref&gt; In Page's published account of his coil, he termed it 
and its contact breaker the 'Compound Electro-Magnet and 
Electrotome'.&lt;ref&gt;Page, 1839, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; Page's patent model for this coil is on display at the [[National Museum of American History]].
[[File:CGPagecoil.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Grafton Page's double helix coil, as marketed in 1848 for $8.00 by Boston instrument maker Daniel Davis Jr.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, 1848, Fig. 183, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In a subsequent experiment with a spiral conductor, Page mounted it rigidly between the poles of a suspended horseshoe magnet. When current stopped flowing in the spiral, a tone could be heard from the magnet, which Page termed 'galvanic music'.&lt;ref&gt;Page, 1837c.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later, [[Alexander Graham Bell]] cited Page's galvanic music as an important precedent for his development of telephony.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, 1876-1877.&lt;/ref&gt;

An astute observer and exploratory experimenter, Page invented many other electromagnetic devices. Some of these involved the electromagnetic motor effect in original ways. Many prototypes devised by Page were turned into products manufactured and marketed by Boston instrument-maker Daniel Davis, Jr., the first American to specialize in magnetic philosophical instruments.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, (1838), (1842).&lt;/ref&gt;

While consulting with [[Samuel F.B. Morse]] and [[Alfred Lewis Vail]] on the development of [telegraph] apparatus and techniques, Page contributed to the adoption of suspended wires using a ground return, designed a signal receiver magnet and tested a magneto as a source to substitute for the battery.&lt;ref&gt;[Post,(1976a), p. 66-68.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1840s, Page developed what he termed the Axial Engine.  This instrument used an electromagnetic solenoid coil to draw an iron rod into its hollow interior. The rod's displacement opened a switch that stopped current from flowing in the coil; then being unattracted, the rod reverted out of the coil, and this cycle repeated again. The resulting [[reciprocating motion]] of the rod back and forth, into and out of the coil, was converted to rotary motion by the mechanism. After demonstrating uses of this engine to run saws and pumps, Page successfully petitioned the [[U.S. Senate]] for funds to produce an electromagnetic locomotive, based on this design.&lt;ref&gt;Post,1972; 1976a, p. 81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

With these funds plus personal resources that took him into debt, Page built and tested the first full-sized electromagnetic locomotive, preceded only by the 1842 battery-powered model-sized ''Galvani'' of Scottish inventor [[Robert Davidson (inventor)|Robert Davidson]]. Along the way, Page constructed a series of motors, revisions of the axial engine having different dimensions and mechanical features, which he tested thoroughly. The motor operated on large electrochemical cells, acid batteries having as electrodes zinc and costly platinum, with fragile clay diaphragms between the cells. Page's 1850 [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] presentation about his progress impressed Joseph Henry, Benjamin Silliman and other leading scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Post 1972; 1976a, p. 91-93.&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:CGPagelocomotive.jpg|thumb|left|Charles Grafton Page's electromagnetic locomotive.&lt;ref&gt;Page, 1854, ''American Polytechnic Journal'', 257&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On April 29, 1851, Page boosts its motors from 8 to 20 HP power. With two engines, he drives a 10-ton locomotive with a top speed of 30&amp;nbsp;km/h. He travels the route from Washington to Bladenburg in 19 minutes. Page conducted a full test, intending to run the 21,000 pound locomotive from Washington DC to Baltimore and back with passengers on board. Problems immediately arose. [[High voltage]] sparks, resulting from the very effect Page had investigated with the spiral conductor, broke through the [[electrical insulation]] of the electrical coils, resulting in [[short circuit]]s.  Many of the battery's fragile clay dividers cracked on starting up; others broke down subsequently. Page and his mechanic Ari Davis struggled to make repairs and keep the locomotive running. With some periods of steady running, the silent engine (by comparison to a [[steam locomotive]]) traveled 5 miles to [[Bladensburg, Maryland]], attaining a top speed of 19 miles per hour.  Page prudently reversed direction there, for what was an arduous, calamity-laced return to the National Capitol.&lt;ref&gt;Post 1972; 1976a, p. 96-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

The failures of Page's electromagnetic locomotive test run were cautionary to other inventors who eventually found other means than batteries to produce electrically driven locomotion. Before Page began his attempt, work such as that of [[James Prescott Joule]] had generated a general consensus among scientists that "the battery powered motor was a hopelessly impractical device".&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt; Page had disregarded those findings. He himself never gave up believing in the practical potential of 
his design.&lt;ref&gt;Post 1972; 1976a, p. 99-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

A century and a half after Page's locomotive, the technology of [[Battery electric vehicle]]s is demonstrating applications in numerous transportation contexts.

==Science and pseudoscience==
Comfortable himself in public performance as a popular lecturer and singer, being skilled in ventriloquism as well,&lt;ref&gt;Page, (1853a), p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; Page was astute in detecting the misuse of performative acts in defrauding a gullible public. One class of fraudulent schemes prevalent at the time involved communications with spirits by means of rapping sounds, the motion of a table, or other such signs produced in the vicinity of the perpetrator-medium. The sounds and motions were attributed to occult forces and forms of electricity. The [[Fox sisters]], of Rochester New York, made these claims notorious by exhibiting in public and private settings, while collecting money from their audiences.

Investigating some of these performers in person, Page produced a book that exposes various means of deception they employed (Page, 1853a). He described his analysis of these techniques during a sitting with the Fox sisters. Each time a critical observer peered under the table around which the sisters were seated, the spirit rapping ceased; whenever the observer sat upright, the sounds recommenced.&lt;ref&gt;Page, (1853a), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Page asked to have the spirit sounds displayed elsewhere than via the table. One sister climbed into a wardrobe closet. Page identified where her long dress (concealing a stick or other apparatus) contacted the wardrobe.  Through his expert knowledge of ventriloquism, Page detected how this performer was misdirecting the viewer's attention away from the actual source of the sound while building expectations to suppose the sound came from elsewhere than the source. However the trick was "poorly done" and the girl could not control it so as to produce any spirit communication.&lt;ref&gt;Page, (1853a), p. 43-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

Going on to reveal other fraudulent practices, Page addressed the relationship at work between performer and audience by which both functioned as perpetrators:
{{quote|The prime movers in all these marvels are ''impostors'', and their disciples, ''dupes''. While the former are filling their coffers at the expense of the latter, they must often indulge in secret merriment at the credulity of their adherents, and particularly at the grave discussions of the learned clergy and others upon electricity, magnetism the new fluid... or the devil's immediate agency.... The instant the idea of the superhuman gets possession of the mind all fitness for investigation and power of analysis begins to vanish, and credulity swells to its utmost capacity. The most glaring inconsistencies and absurdities are not discerned and are swallowed whole....|(Page, (1853a), p. 33-34; 69).}}
 
Page's efforts to expose these frauds at their human roots stems in part from his keen concern for furthering the public understanding of science and their proficient use of its findings and benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Post,(1976a), p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt; In this undertaking, Page allied with contemporary Michael Faraday&lt;ref&gt;Faraday,1855, p.54.&lt;/ref&gt; and other scientists throughout history who have sought to debunk the unscrupulous applications of [[pseudoscience]] upon a willing and gullible public.

==Controversy and impact from politics, war, and patents==
As with the challenge to [[spiritualism]] described above, Page's scientific undertakings brought him into public arenas where politics and controversy held sway. Eloquent, combative, keen-minded and persistent, Page made his commitments known. Increasingly, Page's self-chosen and sometimes self-serving commitments diverged from the norms of behavior sanctioned by society and the elitism of the emerging professionalist trend in science. The resulting tarnish to Page's reputation impacted him during his lifetime and contributed to the longstanding historical neglect of his scientific work and personal story, thereby reducing general understanding of the complexity of the American experience in science.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a; Cavicchi, 
2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A tension early to arise in his career as patent examiner was that of the conflict of interest between the privileged information he had regarding applicants' patents, and his private consulting with particular inventors on the side. Following his appearance in the 1848 Morse v O'Reilly lawsuit over the telegraph, Page took a more careful stance in his role as patent examiner. Thereafter, he refrained from transmitting such privileged information to rival patent applicants.&lt;ref&gt;Post,(1976a), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the well-paid public post of patent examiner put the occupants continually under scrutiny by politicians, scientists, and aspiring inventors. Both Congress and the executive branch exerted control and influence over policy and practices in the patent office.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]], a patent examiner was expected to be highly trained, knowledgeable in all the sciences, informed on current and past technology. Page was an exemplar of this ideal.

As Page continued in the job, the number of patents submitted to the agency increased sharply, while the number of patents granted was the same or less, and the number of patent examiners was unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a, p.55-59; Cooper, 1991, p. 32-38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Inventors seeking patents, becoming incensed about decisions made against them, coalesced into a lobby with a voice projected through the journal ''[[Scientific American]]''. This lobby advocated "liberalization" — more leniency in the granting of patents, giving the inventor the "benefit of the doubt"— and argued against the scientific research being sponsored by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] under Joseph Henry.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a, p. 110-126.&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry took a hard line, decrying inventors' "futile attempts to innovate and improve".&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The elite professionalized science that Henry was building up through the Smithsonian and other organizations treated as low status the having or seeking of a patent; patents were not considered a contribution to science. While Page set out to show that gaining patents was genuine scientific work, he fell out of favor with the scientific establishment. His friendship with Henry petered out, and Page was no longer held in high regard as part of elite science.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a, p. 130-141&lt;/ref&gt;

Page shifted in his position on the granting of patents. As an examiner of patents, he was scrupulous and fair. Through his own experience as an inventor and association with other inventors, he allied with their concerns. On his resignation from the patent agency, Page used the journal he founded and edited as a forum to critique and even lambast the agency and policies which he had upheld for 10 years prior. 
{{quote|Having had much to do with shaping policy from inside the (patent) office, he also played a crucial role in reshaping it from the outside(Post, 1976a, p. 151).}}

Following the example of Samuel Morse, who developed the telegraph to commercial viability through assistance from federal government funds, Page sought a similar level of support for his electromagnetically powered locomotive. He found a political ally in [[Thomas Hart Benton (politician)|Thomas Hart Benton]], senator from Missouri. Benton's passionate rhetoric on behalf of Page's vision was instrumental in securing unanimous support for a Senate allocation of $20,000 to fund Page's project through the Department of Navy.&lt;ref&gt;Post,(1976a), p. 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of that year (1849), Page reported to the Navy that he was collaborating on the project with a mechanic, Ari Davis, the brother of Daniel Davis Jr., but had nothing yet to show. In print, inventor [[Thomas Davenport (inventor)]] challenged the expenditure of public funds on Page's project, claiming that motors he had already invented and built were equal to the task. Page defused that objection by publishing a statement about his unique device.&lt;ref&gt;Post,1976a, p. 89-90; Schiffer, 2008, p. 155-174.&lt;/ref&gt;

More troubles ensued for the project. Running low on cash, Page asked for more. Speaking in the Senate in the summer of 1850, Benton presented Page's attainment of a force an order of magnitude greater than what the same battery had output under his initial trials.  Benton upped the stakes by requesting funds for Page to develop an electromagnetically powered ship of war. This second petition met with serious opposition in the Senate. Senator [[Henry Stuart Foote]] countered that Page had not proved substantial progress or benefits from his work. Senator [[Jefferson Finis Davis]] objected to the appropriation of government funds to one inventor, while other inventors such as Thomas Davenport went unsupported. Both the US Senate and House nixed any further funds for Page's project. In order to prepare the locomotive for its 1851 trial run, Page went over $6000 into debt.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1972; 1976a, p.94-97; Schiffer, 2008, p. 155-174.&lt;/ref&gt; In the wake of the failed public test of this locomotive, Page faced a critical press. Gaining no assistance from the world of finance, he emerged from the debacle in "desperate straights, financially and emotionally".&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Civil War]] wreaked a further devastating impact on Page's scientific work and legacy. In 1863, Union soldiers stationed in the area of Page's home, broke into his laboratory as a random, unprovoked act of violence. His equipment, inventions and laboratory notebooks were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt;  Some other inventions by Page which he had donated to the Smithsonian Institution were destroyed by a fire there in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976a, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these destructive events, very few of Page's handmade devices exist today.&lt;ref&gt;Pantalony et al, 2005, p. 157-159; Cavicchi, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; With little remaining of his experimental work and notes, Page's many contributions have slipped from the view of most historians.

Suffering debt, terminal illness and isolation from the mainstream scientific community by his last years, Page contrived one final effort to secure credit and status for his achievements. In 1867, he petitioned the United States Congress for a retrospective patent on his inventions of the late 1830s: the spiral conductor, the circuit breakers, the double helical coil.&lt;ref&gt;Page, 1867a.&lt;/ref&gt;  The granting of such a patent transgressed such policies as that an invention in widespread public use for decades can not be patented, and that an employee of the Patent office can not hold a patent. Page circumvented these policies by appealing to nationalism. To support his argument, he published anonymously a lengthy, closely researched yet self-promoting book titled ''The American Claim to the Induction Coil and its electrostatic Developments''(1867b).&lt;ref&gt;Page, 1867; Post, 1976b, p. 12821-1283.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1860s, the induction coil was becoming a prominent instrument of physics research. Instrument-makers in America, Great Britain and the European continent contributed in developing the construction and operation of induction coils.&lt;ref&gt;Cavicchi, 1999; 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Premiere among these instrument makers was [[Heinrich Daniel Ruhmkorff]], who in 1864 received from Emperor [[Napoleon III]] the prestigious [[Volta Prize]] along with a 50,000 franc award for his 'invention' of the induction coil. Page maintained that the devices he developed in the 1830s were not markedly different from the induction coil and that other American inventors had filled in with improvements that were better than anything made by Ruhmkorff — and alleging that Ruhmkorff had plagiarized the coil of another American instrument-maker, [[Edward Samuel Ritchie]].&lt;ref&gt;(Page), 1867b; Post, 1976b, 1283.&lt;/ref&gt;

A special act passed by the U.S. House and Senate, and signed by President [[Andrew Johnson]] authorized what was later dubbed "The Page Patent". Page died a few weeks later, in May 1868. Instead of dying with him, the Page patent went on to play a major role in the politics and economics of the telegraph industry.  Page's lawyer and heirs successfully argued that the patent covered the mechanisms involved in "all known forms of telegraphy".&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976b, p. 1284.&lt;/ref&gt; An interest in the patent was sold to the [[Western Union Co]]; together Western Union and the Page heirs reaped lucrative benefits. Page's patent secured a life 'in style' for his widow and heirs. Although he was no longer living, it figured as yet another violation, on his part, of the behavior code under the emerging professionalization of science of the day, under which science was to be conducted for its own sake, without accruing apparent political or financial gain.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 1976b, p. 1285-1286.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3774">'''Detonator crimping pliers''', '''cap crimping pliers''' or '''[[detonator crimping tool]]''' is a common [[tool]] when working with [[explosives]]. The construction is very similar to the construction of any other [[multi-tool]] or [[pliers]]. The specific feature is the presence of one groove on each of the opposing jaws. When the jaws are open, the groves will appear as a semi circle with an elliptical extension. When fully closed the two grooves will form a cylindrical shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ledgard|first1=Jared|title=A Soldiers Handbook, Volume 1: Explosives Operations|date=June 2007|publisher=Jared Ledgard|isbn=9780615147949|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EOD Precission Cap Crimper|url=http://www.blasterstool.com/eodprecissioncapcrimper.aspx|website=Blaster's Tool and Supply Company|accessdate=14 April 2015|ref=List of information about Cap Crimping Pliers, as claimed by the manufacturer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[detonator]] is delivered, it is sometimes delivered as a piece of metal with nothing connected to it. To function, the detonator must be mated with the correct initiation source. The correct initiation source could for example be [[Fuse (explosives)|tar-fuse]] for time delay, or a [[Shock tube detonator]] to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hopkins|first1=Ron|title=Initiation Systems /for Detonators/|url=http://tracefireandsafety.com/VFRE-99/Recognition/Initiation/initiation.htm|website=Explosion Incidents: The Company Officers Role|publisher=Fire Protection and Safety Consultants, Ltd.|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thurman|first1=James T.|title=Practical Bomb Scene Investigation, Second Edition|date=January 28, 2011|publisher=Taylor and Francis Group LLC|isbn=1439819599|pages=102–113|edition=second}}&lt;!--|accessdate=14 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shock Tube Starter|url=http://www.aelminingservices.com/products/initiating-systems/capped-fuse/shock-tube-starter.html|publisher=AEL Mining Services|accessdate=14 April 2015|ref=Manufacturer describes their shock tube detonators that require crimping with a specialized crimping tool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rear part of a detonator is usually made of a rigid but [[malleable]] aluminium alloy, sometimes supported by a relatively soft brass or copper structure to aid in reliably giving a strong and watertight seal without damaging the initiation source. A pair of detonator crimping pliers mate the detonator with the initiation source by allowing the detonator's back end to be inserted into the large hole present when the pliers is in the non-compressed position. When force is applied, the jaws will move closer to each other crimping the neck of the detonator. This shows that the function is just a simple crimping tool, adapted for one specific item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thurman|first1=James T.|title=Practical Bomb Scene Investigation, Second Edition|date=January 28, 2011|publisher=Taylor and Francis Group LLC|isbn=1439819599|pages=102–108|edition=second}}&lt;!--|accessdate=14 April 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risks==
Each type of detonators have an instruction/information folder written by the manufacturer or the distributor. In it are clear instructions on how to crimp that specific type/model. Most detonators contain relatively sensitive explosive compound meant to initiate the [[Staged Detonation|staged detonation]] train. Crimping a detonator in the wrong place or with improper tools may cause it to detonate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Boy dies after biting detonator|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/boy-dies-after-biting-detonator/article3618512.ece|accessdate=14 April 2015|publisher=The Hindu|date=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''dovetail joint''' or simply '''dovetail''' is a [[Woodworking joints|joinery]] technique most commonly used in woodworking joinery (carpentry) including furniture, cabinets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finewoodworking.com/how-to/article/carcase-construction.aspx carcase construction]&lt;/ref&gt; [[log building]]s and traditional [[timber framing]]. Noted for its resistance to being pulled apart ([[tensile strength]]), the dovetail joint is commonly used to join the sides of a drawer to the front.
A series of 'pins' cut to extend from the end of one board interlock with a series of 'tails' cut into the end of another board. The pins and tails have a trapezoidal shape. Once glued, a wooden dovetail joint requires no mechanical fasteners.

The Dovetail joint technique probably pre-dates written history. Some of the earliest known examples of the dovetail joint are in ancient Egyptian furniture entombed with mummies dating from First Dynasty, as well as the tombs of Chinese emperors. The dovetail design is an important method of distinguishing various periods of furniture.

In Europe the dovetail joint is sometimes called a '''swallowtail''' joint, a [[wikt:culver|culvertail]] joint,  or a fantail joint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1994 |title=Routledge French technical dictionary |url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780203014257/ |volume=1 |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780415112253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
The dovetail joint is very strong because of the way the 'tails' and 'pins' are shaped. This makes it difficult to pull the joint apart and virtually impossible when glue is added. This type of joint is used in box constructions such as drawers, jewellery boxes, cabinets and other pieces of furniture where strength is required. It is a difficult joint to make manually, requiring skilled workmanship. There are different types of dovetail joints. The joint is strong especially when used with glue.

The angle of slope varies according to the wood used, purpose of joint and type of work. Typically the slope is 1:6 for softwoods and a shallower 1:8 slope for hardwoods. Often a slope of 1:7 is used as a compromise. However, a different slope does not affect the strength of the joint in different types of wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |date=1958 |title=The relationship between dovetail angle and joint strength |url=http://www.akeda.com/documents/DovetailAngle.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of dovetails==
===Through dovetail===
[[Image:joinery-throughdovetail.svg|thumb|200px|right|A through dovetail joint]]
The image at the top of this page shows a 'through dovetail' (also known as 'plain dovetail') joint, where the end grain of both boards is visible when the joint is assembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.woodworkdetails.com/knowledge/joints/case/dovetail |title=Dovetail Case Joints |website=Woodwork Details |access-date=February 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through dovetails are common in carcass and box construction. Traditionally, the dovetails would have often been covered by a veneer. However, dovetails have become a signature of craftsmanship and are generally considered a feature, so they are rarely concealed in contemporary work. When used in drawer construction, a through (or blind, [[Miter joint|mitred]], or lapped) dovetail joint is sometimes referred to as an "English dovetail."&lt;ref name="Furniche"&gt;{{cite web|title=What's in Your Drawers|url=https://www.furniche.com/articles/whats-your-drawers|website=Furniche|accessdate=9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Half-blind dovetail===
[[Image:joinery-halfblinddovetail.gif|thumb|200px|right|A half-blind dovetail joint]]
Craftsmen use a 'half-blind dovetail' when they do not want the end grain visible from the front of the joint. The tails fit into mortises in the ends of the board that is the front of the item, hiding their ends.

Half-blind dovetails are commonly used to fasten drawer fronts to drawer sides. This is an alternative to the practice of attaching false fronts to drawers constructed using through dovetails.

===Secret mitred dovetail===
[[Image:Secret Mitred Dovetail.png|thumb|200px|right|A secret mitred dovetail joint]]
The 'secret [[Miter joint|mitred]] dovetail' joint (also called a 'mitred blind dovetail', 'full-blind dovetail', or 'full-blind mitred dovetail') is used in the highest class of cabinet and box work. It offers the strength found in the dovetail joint but is totally hidden from both outside faces by forming the outer edge to meet at a 45-degree angle while hiding the dovetails internally within the joint.

The mitred corner dovetail joint is very similar in design, but it has just a single dovetail and is used for picture frames and other similar joins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.toolstoday.com/g-46-dovetail-joints-different-types-and-their-uses.aspx |title=Dovetail Joints: Different Types and Their Uses |website=ToolsToday |access-date=February 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Secret double-lapped dovetail===
The '''secret double-lapped dovetail''' is similar to the secret mitred dovetail, but presents a very thin section of end grain on one edge of the joint. Used for carcass and box construction to hide the dovetails completely from view.

===Sliding dovetail===
[[Image:joinery-slidingdovetail.gif|thumb|200px|right|A sliding dovetail joint]]
The sliding dovetail is a method of joining two boards at right angles, where the intersection occurs within the field of one of the boards, that is not at the end. This joint provides the interlocking strength of a dovetail. Sliding dovetails are assembled by sliding the tail into the socket. It is common to slightly taper the socket, making it slightly tighter towards the rear of the joint, so that the two components can be slid together easily but the joint becomes tighter as the finished position is reached. Another method to implement a tapered sliding dovetail would be to taper the tail instead of the socket. When used in drawer construction, a "stopped sliding dovetail" that does not extend across the full width of the board is sometimes referred to as a "French dovetail".&lt;ref name="Furniche" /&gt;

Used for:
* Joining shelves to cabinet sides
* Joining cabinet bottoms to sides
* Joining horizontal partitions to shelves
* Joining adjacent sections of expandable table frames
* Joining drawer fronts to sides
* Joining front rails of [[web frame]]s to cabinet sides
* Joining neck and body in violins and some guitars.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6177">'''Dynamical dimensional reduction''' or '''spontaneous dimensional reduction''' is the apparent reduction in the number of spacetime dimensions as a function of the distance scale, or conversely the energy scale, with which spacetime is probed. At least within the current level of experimental precision, our universe has three dimensions of space and one of time. However, the idea that the number of dimensions may increase at extremely small length scales was first proposed more than a century ago,&lt;ref&gt;Nordstrom, G. Z. Phys. 15 (1914) 504.&lt;/ref&gt; and is now fairly commonplace in theoretical physics. Contrary to this, a number of recent results in quantum gravity suggest the opposite behavior, a dynamical reduction of the number of spacetime dimensions at small length scales. 
== Evidence for dimensional reduction==
The phenomenon of dimensional reduction has now been reported in a number of different approaches to quantum gravity. String theory,&lt;ref&gt;Atick, J. J. Witten, E.; [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0550321388901514?via%3Dihub The Hagedorn Transition and the Number of Degrees of Freedom of String Theory].&lt;/ref&gt; causal dynamical triangulations,&lt;ref&gt;Ambjorn, J. Jurkiewicz, J. Loll, R.; [https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.171301 Spectral Dimension of the Universe].&lt;/ref&gt; renormalization group approaches,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lauscher, O. M. Reuter, E.; [http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1126-6708/2005/10/050/meta Fractal Spacetime Structure in Asymptotically Safe Gravity].&lt;/ref&gt; noncommutative geometry,&lt;ref&gt;Benedetti, D.; Fractal properties of quantum spacetime [https://arxiv.org/abs/0811.1396 arXiv:0811.1396].&lt;/ref&gt; loop quantum gravity&lt;ref&gt;Modesto, L.; Fractal Structure of Loop Quantum Gravity [https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.2214 arXiv:0812.2214].&lt;/ref&gt; and Horava-Lifshitz gravity&lt;ref&gt;Horava, P.; Spectral Dimension of the Universe in Quantum Gravity at a Lifshitz Point [https://arxiv.org/abs/0902.3657 arXiv:0902.3657].&lt;/ref&gt; all find that the dimensionality of spacetime appears to decrease from approximately 4 on large distance scales to approximately 2 on small distance scales. 

The evidence for dimensional reduction has come mainly, although not exclusively, from calculations of the spectral dimension. The spectral dimension is a measure of the effective dimension of a manifold at different resolution scales. Early numerical simulations within the [[Causal_dynamical_triangulation|causal dynamical triangulation]] (CDT) approach to quantum gravity found a spectral dimension of 4.02 ± 0.10 at large distances and 1.80 ± 0.25 at small distances. This result created significant interest in dimensional reduction within the quantum gravity community. A more recent study of the same point in the parameter space of CDT found consistent results, namely 4.05 ± 0.17 at large distances and 1.97 ± 0.27 at small distances.&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N. Jurkiewicz, J.; [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP03%282015%29151 Evidence for Asymptotic Safety from Dimensional Reduction in Causal Dynamical Triangulations,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7712 arXiv:1411.7712].&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is no consensus on the correct theoretical explanation for the mechanism of dimensional reduction.  

== Possible explanations ==

The ubiquity and consistency of dimensional reduction in quantum gravity has driven the search for a theoretical understanding of this phenomenon. Currently, there exist few proposed explanations for the observation of dimensional reduction. 

One proposal is that of scale invariance. There is growing evidence that gravity may be nonperturbatively renormalizable as described by the asymptotic safety program, which requires the existence of a non-Gaussian fixed point at high energies towards which the couplings defining the theory flow.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; At such a fixed point gravity must be scale invariant, and hence Newton's constant must be dimensionless. Only in 2-dimensional spacetime is Newton's constant dimensionless, and so in this scenario going to higher energies and hence flowing towards the fixed point should correspond to the dimensionality of spacetime reducing to the value 2. This explanation is not entirely satisfying as it does not explain why such a fixed point should exist in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;Carlip, S.; Spontaneous Dimensional Reduction in Short-Distance Quantum Gravity? [https://arxiv.org/abs/0909.3329 arXiv:0909.3329].&lt;/ref&gt;

A second possible explanation for dimensional reduction is that of asymptotic silence. General relativity exhibits so-called asymptotic silence in the vicinity of a spacelike singularity, which is the narrowing or focusing of light cones close to the Planck scale leading to a causal decoupling of nearby spacetime points. In this scenario, each point has a preferred spatial direction, and geodesics see a reduced (1 + 1)-dimensional spacetime.&lt;ref&gt;Carlip, S.; Dimension and Dimensional Reduction in Quantum Gravity [https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05417 arXiv:1705.05417].&lt;/ref&gt;

Dimensional reduction implies a deformation or violation of Lorentz invariance and typically predicts an energy dependent speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;Sotiriou, T. Visser, M. Weinfurtner, S.; From dispersion relations to spectral dimension - and back again [https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.6098 arXiv:1105.6098].&lt;/ref&gt; Given such radical consequences, an alternative proposal is that dimensional reduction should not be taken literally, but should instead be viewed as a hint of new Planck scale physics.&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N.; [https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.91.124040 Hypothesis on the nature of time,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04320 arXiv:1502.04320].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Coumbe, D. N.; [http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S021827181750119X Quantum gravity without vacuum dispersion,][https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.02519 arXiv:1512.02519].&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia currently has thirteen electric vehicle charging stations across [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]] and [[Canberra]] from [[Coulomb Technologies]]. They opened in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref name="ChargePointAU" &gt;https://www.chargepoint.net.au/charge_point&lt;/ref&gt; One charge point from [[ECOtality]] has been installed in the car park at 140 William Street in [[Melbourne]] CBD with Exigency&lt;ref&gt;http://www.exigency.com.au/&lt;/ref&gt; providing project management and metering. ChargePoint has expanded its service to eight cities by 2012 (Perth 3, Adelaide 5, Melbourne 10, Canberra 2, Sydney 8, Brisbane 6, Townsville 3, Hobart 1).&lt;ref name="ChargePointAU" /&gt;

Construction of infrastructure (charging spots and battery switching stations) had been proposed by Better Place for the major cities [[Melbourne]], [[Sydney]] and [[Brisbane]].
[[Australia]] would have become the third country in the world to have an electric car network in a bid to run the country's 15 million cars on batteries powered by green energy under a plan announced in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5il6f9UKjXLMrq0sQ-Ccd8vh5VANA | title=Australia plans electric vehicle network | accessdate=2009-01-20 | date=2008-10-23 | publisher=AFP | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081026121044/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5il6f9UKjXLMrq0sQ-Ccd8vh5VANA | archivedate=2008-10-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel on May 25, shortly after pulling out of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1082151_better-place-bails-out-of-both-u-s-and-australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1084406_better-place-electric-car-service-files-for-bankruptcy&lt;/ref&gt;
The original plan to deploy as much as 200,000 charging stations was stopped in January 2013, after  just 20 public charge spots had been installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.betterplace.com.au/drivers/charge-spot-locations.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123165609/http://www.betterplace.com.au/drivers/charge-spot-locations.html |archivedate=2011-11-23 |df= }} (Melbourne 4, Canberra 8, Sydney 3, Newcastle 5)&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2011 to 2014, the City of Vancouver installed&lt;ref&gt;http://vancouver.ca/streets-transportation/electric-vehicles.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; 
publicly accessible Level 2 charging stations in a variety of locations, including community centres, shopping malls, curbside, and other locations throughout the city.
In 2008, the city  changed the  Building Bylaw to require 20% of parking stalls in apartments and condos, and all stalls in houses to be electric vehicle ready.
In 2013, the bylaw was updated so that 10% of stalls in mixed-use and commercial buildings are also ready for electric vehicles.

In a March 2016 news release,&lt;ref&gt;https://news.gov.bc.ca/releases/2016MEM0005-000447&lt;/ref&gt;
the Government of British Columbia stated that the

China's first large electric charging station for electric vehicles—the Tangshan Nanhu EV Charging Station – was put into service on March 31, 2010. Five cities in northern Hebei province – Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Qinhuangdao, Langfang and Chengde – want to build three charging stations and 100 charging poles in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/90860/6937967.html "China's first electric vehicle charging station put into service"], People's Daily, 1 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Shandong is the province with most car manufacturers in China. The province planned to start in May 2010 with a charging station for 45 cars. According to China's State Grid Corporation, 75 electric vehicle charging stations are planned in 27 cities across China by the end of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/business/2010-04/11/content_19790544.htm "Shandong builds 1st large electric car charging station", Xinhua state press, April 11, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sgcc2010"&gt;[http://www.sgcc.com.cn/ywlm/gsyw-e/218933.shtml "SGCC Accelerates Building of Electric Vehicle Charging Stations"], State Grid Coroporation, 2. March 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally 6,209 charging posts and some battery replacement stations had been planned for 2010.&lt;ref name="sgcc2010" /&gt; The State Grid Corporation China announced success in distributing 7,031 charge poles in Hangzhou-Jinhua and wants to add 211 additional charging poles in 2011 along with 173 charging stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.globaltimes.cn/auto-china/new-energy/2011-03/629674.html "China boasts world's largest number of EV charging stations"], Global Times China, 3 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- announcements of "done" is different in a centrally planned economy, they have probably just started construction for the most part --&gt;

China is planning on installing 10 million electric vehicle charging stations by 2020.&lt;ref&gt;http://green.autoblog.com/2011/01/19/report-china-working-on-plan-to-install-10-million-charging-sta/&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th Five Year Plan (2011–2015) China wants to deploy 2,351 charge and replacement power stations and 220,000 charge spots.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90778/7307489.html "China has largest electric vehicle charging network"], People's Daily Online, 3 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The reason is to get rid of crude oil imports which makes for 54 percent of the oil usage and cars accounted for 40 percent of national oil consumption (2010).

===Europe===
The AVERE / European Association for Battery, Hybrid and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles was founded back in 1978 and is a member of the [[World Electric Vehicle Association]]. AVERE is also the parent organization of CITELEC / Association of European Cities interested in Electric Vehicles and Eurelectric. The European Commission has funded the "Green Cars Initiative" since November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/research/transport/info/green_cars_initiative_en.html "Green Cars Initiatiave"], European Commission information portal&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, the European Commission along with forty two partners from the industries, utilities, electric car manufacturers, municipalities, universities and technology and research institutions founded the "Green eMotion" initiative funded with €41.8 million under the Seventh Research and Development Framework Programme. The defined goal is to provide an interoperable electromobility framework to align the ongoing regional and national electromobility initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/381&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en "Commission makes €24.2 million available to the development of electromobility in Europe"], press release, European Commission, IP/11/381, 30 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the partners unveiled the "Transport 2050" plan which includes the aim to half the number of conventionally fuelled cars in cities by 2030 and phase them out by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/11/372&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=0&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en "Transport 2050: Commission outlines ambitious plan to increase mobility and reduce emissions"], press release, European Commission, IP/11/372, 28 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second position paper (March 2011) of the [[European Automobile Manufacturers Association]] it is recommended to equip public charging stations with IEC 62196 Type 2 Mode 3 connectors with transitional solutions to be allowed up to 2017.&lt;ref name="acea2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/charging_20110511.pdf|title=ACEA position and recommendations for the standardization of the charging of electrically chargeable vehicles|date=2011-03-02|publisher=ACEA - European Automobile Manufacturers Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202043526/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/charging_20110511.pdf|archivedate=2012-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, multiple socket types (IEC 60309-2 Mode 2 types, IEC 62196 Mode 3 types, Chademo and standard home socket outlets Mode 2) have been deployed already.

There are 2 major charge point operators in Denmark, E.on are operating mostly fast chargers, only installing rapids at freeways, while Clever is installing both fast and rapids in city centers.

Both E.on and Clever is taking part in installing rapid chargers at freeway lay-bys, with Clever installing 4 of them and E.on a total of 20 at 10 different locations.&lt;ref&gt;http://vejdirektoratet.dk/DA/om-os/nyheder-og-presse/nyheder/Sider/Nu-bliver-det-nemmere-at-k%C3%B8re-elbil-i-Jylland.aspx#.VQNH_vmG8uE&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides E.on and Clever, local energy companies are installing free-to-use charge points, often only consisting of a CEE plug, so the users have to bring their own EVSE box.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nrgi.dk/om/vaerd-at-vide/praktisk-information/kort-over-ladestandere/&lt;/ref&gt;

Infrastructure was planned by Better Place and has been installed by Coulomb Technologies for Copenhagen. Denmark has enacted policies that create a tax differential between [[zero-emission vehicle]]s and traditional cars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cop15.dk/en/servicemenu/News/FrenchElectricCarToDebutInDanishShowroomsInAFewMonths.htm | title=French Electric Car To Debut In Danish Showrooms In a Few Months | accessdate=2008-07-29 | date=2008-05-28 | publisher= COP15 United Nations Climate Change Conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; to accelerate the transition to [[electric car]]s. Better Place had announced the network to be complete in December 2012, however the stations and chargers have been switched off due to the bankruptcy of Better Place Danmark A/S in June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://danmark.betterplace.com/om-better-place/presse/brev-til-kunder-i-better-place-danmark-as|publisher=Better Place Danmark A/S|date=2013-06-03|accessdate=2013-06-10|quote= at både batteriskiftestationer og ladestanderne opsat i det offentlige rum foreløbig vil være ude af drift fra senest 4. juni 2013 (both battery stations and public chargers will be left offline since 4.

In 2013 E.on bought the charge points from Better Place and restarted the network, without the battery swap system.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.information.dk/471684&lt;/ref&gt;

Norway has a tradition in building electric vehicles based on the [[Think Car]]. It is popular in Southern Norway (Oslo), Southern Sweden (Gothenburg) and Eastern Denmark (Copenhagen). The concept of the  "Move About"&lt;ref name="moveabout"&gt;http://www.moveabout.net/&lt;/ref&gt; project will provide 60 new Think cars in a test including charging stations in 50 towns in the area until 2013.&lt;ref name="vehiculedufutur" /&gt; The MoveAbout concept is actually derived from a [[car sharing]] system where cars are not offered for purchase but for leasing.

The Estonian government and Kredex launched the charging station network project in 2011 in cooperation with [[ABB Group|ABB]], funded partially by the [[Mitsubishi Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CzslGzUuj0o&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www05.abb.com/global/scot/scot344.nsf/veritydisplay/44b95704c7c77bd0c12579ce004a3ea4/$file/4EVC202901-POEN_EstoniaProject.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The nationwide electric car charging network officially opened with 165&amp;nbsp;fast chargers on 20 February 2013. These chargers were installed in all urban settlements with more than 5,000 inhabitants. In addition, chargers are installed on the all major roads at intervals of no more than {{convert|60|km}}. That makes it possible to reach every point within the country without a supply interruption.&lt;ref name="guardian200213"&gt;{{cite news| first = Adam | last = Vaughan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/20/estonia-electric-car-charging-network |title= Estonia launches national electric car charging network | newspaper=The Guardian |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate=2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters200213"&gt;{{cite news| first = David | last = Mardiste |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/02/20/uk-estonia-environment-cars-idUKLNE91J02O20130220 |title= Estonia goes electric with new car charger network | agency= Reuters |date=2013-02-20 |accessdate= 2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the ''Terra 51'' [[CHAdeMO]]-type [[direct current|DC]] chargers are fast-charging, only needing between 15 and 30 minutes to fully charge a car's battery.&lt;ref name="abb200213"&gt;{{cite press release| url= http://www.abb.com/cawp/seitp202/61df2f8f8c7d00a6c1257b18002d5e3c.aspx |title= World's first nationwide EV charging network starts – based on ABB fast charger technology | publisher = [[ABB Group|ABB]] |date= 2013-02-20 |accessdate= 2013-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, [[Électricité de France]] (EDF) and [[Toyota]] are installing recharging points for PHEVs on roads, streets and [[parking lot]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher=Électricité de France | date=2007-09-05 | url=http://www.edf.fr/105819i/Accueil-com/presse/communiques-et-dossiers-de-presse/Noeud-Communiques-et-Dossier-de-presse/EDF-et-Toyota-annoncent-un-partenariat-technologique-en-Europe-relatif-aux-vehicules-hybrides-rechargeables.html | title=EDF et Toyota annoncent un partenariat technologique en Europe relatif aux véhicules hybrides rechargeables | accessdate=2007-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Renault–Nissan Alliance]] and the largest French electric utility, [[Electricite de France]] (EDF) have signed an agreement to promote emission-free mobility in France. The move aims at offering all-electric volume vehicles from 2011 — including a countrywide network of battery charging stations.&lt;ref name="eetimes r-n-edf"/&gt; The partner Vinci Autoroutes has announced to rebuild 738 car parks along motorways with at least 5 parking lots for charging electric vehicles – construction will start at the end of 2011 and the full extent will be reached in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.renault.com/global/fr-fr/renaultgroup/Media/PressRelease.aspx?mediaid=29127 |author=Renault|title=press release|date=2011-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Environment Ministry of France]], led by [[Jean-Louis Borloo]] has announced the goal to install 400,000 charging points in France by 2015.&lt;ref name="edf-news-march-2010"&gt;[http://collectivite.edf.fr/edf-fr-accueil/edf-collectivites-territoriales/actualites/actualites-marche-avril-2010-604186.html "EDF Collectivités territoriales &gt; actualités &gt; actualites marche avril 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EDF reprint of [[Le Journal du Dimanche]], 28/03/10: "Le ministre de l'Écologie, Jean-Louis Borloo, a annoncé d'ici à 2015 la construction de 400 000 "points de recharge" dans toute la France."&lt;/ref&gt; Jean-Louis Borloo has assigned 1.5 billion Euros in 2009 to support research and preparations for the first part of the electric vehicle network with 75,000 charging stations.&lt;ref name="edf-news-march-2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EDF reprint of Electro Magazine, 01/03, Les Echos, 22/03/10: "Jean-Louis Borloo a présenté en 2009 un plan de 1,5 milliard d'euros afin de développer la voiture électrique et son corollaire, les infrastructures de rechange." / "La question est de savoir si le réseau de bornes de recharge sera construit par des PME ou par une filiale unique d'ERDF qui pourrait se voir confier dans un premier temps l'installation de 75 000 bornes."&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the pilot project in Paris has started with the introduction of 100 [[Renault Z.E.|Z.E.]] cars. The map of charging stations can be downloaded from the city website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.paris.fr/pratique/voitures-deux-roues-motorises/bornes-de-recharge-pour-vehicules-electriques/p5775 | title=Bornes de recharge électrique | publisher=Portal of the City of Paris | date=2012-02-28 | accessdate=2012-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 101 locations with 178 charging points across the town and its suburbs (May 2010). The charging points have either [[Schuko]]-like sockets (Type E / 2P+T) or a Marechal plug on spiral cord where both variants are rated at 230&amp;nbsp;V/16&amp;nbsp;A (mains).

[[Schneider Electric]] supports test drives in France with its charging stations that include a Type 3 ([[EV Plug Alliance]]) connector. In [[Strasbourg]] 100 [[Toyota Prius]] were tested with 135 recharging spots beginning Q1 2010 (Type 3 single-phase). In the suburbs of Paris there will be 300 recharging spots to be installed in Q1 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://140.116.163.76/motor/%E9%9B%BB%E5%8B%95%E8%BB%8A%E7%A0%94%E8%A8%8E%E6%9C%83/%E7%AC%AC%E4%BA%8C%E5%A4%A9/1.Jove%20Chen.pdf "Electric Vehicle Solution – Schneider Electric"], Version Jan 2011, Schneider Electric, accessed 7 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the "Projet Klébér" the Strasbourg vehicle fleet may use the charging stations of [[EnBW]] in [[Mannheim]], [[Karlsruhe]], [[Stuttgart]] and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrie.gouv.fr/pdf/projet_pilote_transfrontalier_final.pdf|title=Annexe au rapport d’étape du groupe de travail franco-allemand sur l’électromobilité|date=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Yvelines]] near Paris the fleet test SAVE (Seine Aval Véhicule Électrique) was started in April 2011 – until September 2011 a number of 200 charging stations will be built.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.renault.com/fr/capeco2/pages/experimentation-seine-aval-vehicules-electriques.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The Renault–Nissan group – including EDF – has enlarged its scope with partnering to the Italian utility [[Enel]] and Spanish utility [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]] in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earth2tech.com/2010/04/09/renault-nissan-expand-their-electric-vehicle-empire/ "Renault, Nissan Expand Their Electric Vehicle Empire"]&lt;/ref&gt; Renault–Nissan offers a broader range by providing 60 all-electric vehicles – the Kangoo Express Z.E. and the Renault Fluence Z.E – to the new pilot project "E-Moving" in Italy. The project will start to install 270 charge points in the Lombardy region (including the cities of Milan and Brescia) up to June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://green.autoblog.com/2010/03/18/renault-nissan-e-moves-into-lombardy-italy/ "Renault-Nissan e-moves into Lombardy, Italy"]&lt;/ref&gt; This "E-Moving" network will contain 150 public charging stations to be put up until the end of 2010.&lt;ref name="cars21"&gt;[http://www.cars21.com/content/articles/2010-07-09-italy-joining-the-electric-ride-with-new-regulation.php "Italy joining the electric ride with new regulation"], cars21.com, 9. July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian Enel company had an early agreement with Daimler to run a test with their Smart line of cars. Enel has started the "emobility Italy" program in cooperation with Daimler in 2008 – this program will put up 400 public and private charging stations in Rome, Milan and Pisa with charging stations to be built since September 2010.&lt;ref name="vehiculedufutur"&gt;[http://www.vehiculedufutur.com/uploads/adherents/ECOSYSTEME_VEHICULE_ELECTRIQUE_juin2010.pdf "L’ECOSYSTEME DU VEHICULE ELECTRIQUE"], Laurent Meillaud&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enel-daimler-start"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enel.com/en-GB/innovation/project_technology/zero_emission_life/mobile_sustainability/e-mobility.aspx|title=E-Mobility|publisher=enel|at=Enel information website|accessdate=2012-04-09|quote=(summary) The first vehicles of the electric mobility project launched by Enel and smart in 2008 are now being driven on the streets of Rome, Milan and Pisa. Under this projects, which includes private citizens and firms, 100 electric smart vehicles will be delivered and over 400 charging stations will be installed in public and private locations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was supposed to start in 2011 with a test run going for 48 months – since 5. April 2012 the Smart drive E-Mobility program is ready. The 100 public charging stations in Rome are built with a three-phase Type 2 Mennekes connector&lt;ref name="wko-italy"/&gt; while the additional 50 home charging stations are built with a single-phase Type 3 Scame connector.

The [[Charging station#E-Move charging station|E-Move charging stations]] around [[Bolzano]] allow for a test drive of connecting solar panels directly to light vehicles for charging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ecofriend.org/entry/eco-tech-e-move-charging-station-fuels-just-about-everything-with-solar-energy/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131130021746/http://www.ecofriend.org/entry/eco-tech-e-move-charging-station-fuels-just-about-everything-with-solar-energy/ |archivedate=2013-11-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zero Emission City Parma is a regional project with a 9 million Euro funding to create 300 charging stations along with 900 electric vehicles until 2015.&lt;ref name="wko-italy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.wko.at/wk/dok_detail_file.wk?angid=1&amp;docid=1750359&amp;conid=603823|publisher=WKO – Aussenwirtschaft Österreich|title=Elektrombolität in Italien|language=German|date=2011-12-06|accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The project is expected to go fully operational by the end of 2012, with 300 points of charge installed and 400/450 electric vehicles circulating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h2it.org/en/2011/news/notizie-nazionali/parma-citta-dellauto-elettrica|title=Parma: realm of the electric car|accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany has four major [[transmission system operator]]s ([[50Hertz Transmission GmbH|50Hertz]], [[Amprion]], [[TenneT]], [[TransnetBW]]). They try to set themselves into the position to sell electricity power to electric vehicle owners by becoming also the operators of the upcoming electric vehicle networks.{{Citation needed|reason=really the TSOs?|date=November 2017}} To that avail, they offered partnerships to the German car makers, where they provided charging stations for field tests.

The German government has announced to support a fleet of 1 million electric cars in Germany by 2020. There are 500 million Euros assigned to the [[Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology (Germany)]] to support research and pilot projects in Germany. The ministry has created a dedicated coordination office in the "Gemeinsame Geschäftsstelle Elektromobilität der Bundesregierung (GGEMO)" (''Joint Agency for Electric Mobility (of the Federal Government)'')  which was opened in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Navigation/energie,did=329290.html Pressemeldung vom 1.2.2010 "Gemeinsame Geschäftsstelle Elektromobilität der Bundesregierung (GGEMO) nimmt Fahrt auf"] "um das Ziel zu erreichen, Deutschland zu einem Leitmarkt für Elektromobilität zu entwickeln und bis 2020 eine Mio. Elektrofahrzeuge in Deutschland zu haben."&lt;/ref&gt; The GGEMO has coordinated a partnership program with the German car industry named "[[Nationale Plattform Elektromobilität]] (NPE)" inaugurated on May 3, 2010, in the [[German Chancellery]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmwi.de/BMWi/Navigation/Presse/pressemitteilungen,did=340772.html Pressemitteilung vom 3.5.2010 "Etablierung der Nationalen Plattform Elektromobilität am 3.

The German government has announced that it will not install a rebate system for the introduction of electric cars but that it will reshape the legal provisions to quickly create a charging station network in Germany. Bernd Pischetsrieder (formerly Volskwagen) points to studies saying that most of the current buyers of electric cars did already own multiple cars so that a rebate plan would merely come out as a subvention of a consumer class that can afford the expense anyway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/wirtschaft/ex-vw-chef-gegen-praemien-fuer-e-autos/2729976.html "Ex-VW-Chef gegen Prämien für E-Autos"], [[Der Tagesspiegel]], 16.

November 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vde.com/de/verband/pressecenter/pressemeldungen/fach-und-wirtschaftspresse/seiten/2010-35.aspx "VDE-Studie sieht für Elektroautos noch Hürden bis zum Massenmarkt"], 28. April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; During the congress a large consumer study was precented that showed some 64 percent want to buy an electric car. The study did also look at the requirements to the charging process – 51 percent of consumers in Germany expect a car to be charged in less than 2 hours, up to 4 hours is acceptable to 60 percent of consumers. 64 percent of consumers expect to charge in their own garage, 21 percent want to frequent a central charging station while casual charging in parking lots of shops and company grounds is expected by a mere 6 and 4 percent respectively. The maximum travel distance shows mixed results – while 53 percent say that 300&amp;nbsp;km is enough there are also 31 percent who like to travel 450 to 1000&amp;nbsp;km until required to recharge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vde.de/de/Verband/Pressecenter/Pressemeldungen/Fach-und-Wirtschaftspresse/Seiten/2010-74.aspx "Elektromobilität Getankt wird zu Hause – 64 Prozent der Bundesbürger wollen Elektroauto kaufen", press release, VDE, 8.

Instead government funds should back the investments in privately owned charging stations for example with faster tax write off and cheap credits from the government [[KfW]] bank.&lt;ref name="npe2010"/&gt;

A preliminary review of the Mercedes / RWE test drive in the smart ed project shows the importance of vehicle-to-grid communications in charging stations as an incentive to charge at night times. While most US households own a garage even for small cars the situation is different in [[Central Europe]] where public charging stations are needed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ev-charging-infrastructure.com/media/downloads/inline/brian-mcbeth-daimler.1291372915.pdf "e-mobility @Daimler – handout"], 3 December 2010, accessed 7 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The charging station network in Switzerland is derived from research in solar cars. In 1992 the government decided to support a charging station network. The network has since extended to neighbouring countries – in 2010 the [[Park &amp; Charge]] network in Switzerland, Germany and Austria did encompass 500 charging locations,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.park-charge.ch/e/index.htm accessed 8. August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; additionally there a few charging locations in the Netherlands and Italy.

The Irish government has instituted a package of measures,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/Press+Releases/Minister+Rabbitte+launches+Electric+Vehicles+grant+scheme.htm Minister Rabbitte launches Electric Vehicles grant scheme – Dublin 19th April 2011 ]&lt;/ref&gt; including a €5,000 grant (US$7,158) to assist with purchasing the vehicle, exemption from [[vehicle registration tax (Ireland)|vehicle registration tax]], and accelerated capital allowances to promote electric vehicle purchase.
In 2013, the Irish government withdrew the EV [[vehicle registration tax (Ireland)|vehicle registration tax]] exemption and replaced it with a €5,000 discount on the tax.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acea.be/uploads/publications/Electric_vehicles_overview__2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; New conditions were also added to the SEAI EV Grant which reclassified private EV purchases via Hire Purchase or car loan as a commercial purchase, effectively reducing the EV grant to €3,500 for all non-cash buyers. As a result of these changes, EV sales fell in 2013 to only 58 units.&lt;ref&gt;http://insideevs.com/ev-sales-2013-ireland-ranked-last-out-of-17-countries-in-europe/&lt;/ref&gt;

ESB is providing the charging network, which will be made up of 46 fast-charging (50&amp;nbsp;kW DC) stations located at intervals on inter-urban national primary routes, 1,500 medium-speed(22&amp;nbsp;kW AC) public charging points distributed across all towns with population over 1500, and home chargers (3.6&amp;nbsp;kW [[Single-phase electric power|1Φ]], 16A) at no cost to the first 2,000 grant qualifying electric car owners.

The first station of the charger network was commissioned in August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esb.ie/main/sustainability/ESB-ecars-news-004.jsp "AA's Conor Faughnan Plugs into Green Driving"], press release, Electricity Supply Board, 6. August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2011 the charging station map shows 50 AC charging places plus 10 DC stations – the AC chargers will be built to Type 2 sockets however some older charging spots still need to be rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.esb.ie/electric-cars/electric-car-charging/electric-car-charge-point-map.jsp&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2014 all 46 [[CHAdeMO]] fast chargers are operational and are slowly being replaced by tri-standard units capable of CHAdeMO, CCS and 44&amp;nbsp;kW AC power.

[[File:First EV Charging Station in Barcelona.JPG|thumb|Charging station of Endesa in Barcelona 2011]]

The Alargador&lt;ref name="alargador" /&gt; map has 190 (August 2010) contributors of charging stations in Spain and Portugal (May 2010). They are mainly hotels, camping sites, restaurants, commercial centers, foundations, associations, EV dealers and private individuals with most systems operated manually.

In [[Madrid]], [[Spain]], a trial project will convert 30 former [[telephone booth|telephone boxes]] into charging points for [[electric car]]s. They are considered suitable, since [[telephone booth|telephone boxes]] are generally located at the roadside and are already connected to the electricity supply network. They would form part of a planned network of 546 charging points in Madrid, [[Barcelona]] and [[Seville]], subsidised by the Spanish Government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/08/electric-car-plan-spain Madrid reverses the chargers with electric car plan], [[The Guardian]], September 08, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The charging grid is created for the MOVELE pilot project of the Institute for Diversification and Saving of Energy (Instituto para la Diversificación y Ahorro de la Energía, IDAE) that is also providing for 2,000 electric vehicles to the field test.&lt;ref name="movele"&gt;[http://www.idae.es/index.php/mod.pags/mem.detalle/id.407/lang.uk "MOVELE.

The Chairman of [[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]], [[Endesa (Spain)|Borja Prado]], together with a former mayor of Madrid, [[Alberto Ruiz Gallardón]], and the Chairman of [[Telefónica]], César Alierta, have the [[phone booth]] in Madrid which can also be used for recharging electric vehicles. Reserved parking spaces will be located next to this and all other booths set up in Metropolitan areas where users will be able to park their EVs and recharge at no cost once they have obtained their free "zero emissions" pre-paid card from the Madrid city council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.endesa.es/Portal/en/press/press_releases/our_companies/endesa/2010/120510CabinasRecharging.htm |title=ENDESA AND TELEFÓNICA LAUNCH FIRST ELECTRIC VEHICLE TELEPHONE BOOTH RECHARGING STATION. |date=2010-05-10 |publisher=[[Endesa (Spain)|Endesa]] |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Live Barcelona"&lt;ref name="livebarcelona"&gt;http://www.livebarcelona.cat&lt;/ref&gt; map (sponsored by the Barcelona city council, the Energy state department of Catalonia, utility Endesa, car maker Seat) lists 138 charging spots in Barcelona with 55 of them functional (February 2011).

In September 2011 Endesa signed agreements with Mitsubishi, Renault–Nissan and the Japanese Chademo Foundation on the promotion of fast-charge stations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.endesa.com/EN/SALADEPRENSA/NOTICIAS/Paginas/20110921_MitsubishiENG.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Endesa will hold the Chademo Europe chair. As a consequence, Endesa will deploy two types of public charging spots – conventional charging (16 A, 230 V&amp;nbsp;AC, Schuko type)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.endesavehiculoelectrico.com/vehiculo-electrico/recarga/oferta-puntos/publica-monofasica&lt;/ref&gt;  and rapid charging (125 A, 400 V&amp;nbsp;DC, Chademo type).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.endesavehiculoelectrico.com/vehiculo-electrico/recarga/oferta-puntos/publica-rapida&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011 Endesa ordered 53 rapid charging stations to be built by GE in strategic places in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elp.com/index/display/article-display.articles.electric-light-power.renewable-energy.phev.2011.10.GE__Endesa_bring_electric_vehicles__charging_stations_to_Spain.QP129867.dcmp=rss.page=1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia region]] is creating a research cluster (Clúster de Empresas de Automoción de Galicia / Ceaga). The infrastructure side (Plan Mobega – Plan de movilidad eléctrica de Galicia) includes the implementation of a network of multifunctional electromobility stations located at rent-a-car stations. The current installation includes 7 Multifunctional Electromobility stations&lt;ref&gt;http://bluemobility.es/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/EMME_Santiago.png&lt;/ref&gt; which are located in the main metropolitan areas of Galicia and a fleet of 28 electric vehicles. The project was started in September 2011 and will continue until Enero 2013.

The Alliance and Elektromotive have signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greencarcongress.com/2009/02/renault-nissan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A fleet of electric cars and charge points will be rolled out across [[Coventry]] ([[England]]) as part of a multimillion-pound pilot project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&amp;orgId=101846&amp;topicId=104970025&amp;docId=l:854380157 Error – LexisNexis Publisher&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department for Transport (DfT) announced in April 2009 that £230 million would be allocated to incentivise the market uptake of EVs in the UK. The scheme will become operational in 2011 and each EV purchaser could receive a rebate of between £2,000 -£5,000. Electric vehicles are exempt from purchase and annual vehicle tax. From April 2010, purchasers of an average new car (Band G) will pay a one off £155 showroom tax and an annual vehicle tax of £155.EVs are tax free.&lt;ref name="london2009" /&gt;

On the 25 February 2010, London, the North East region and Milton Keynes were selected to be the lead places for electric vehicle infrastructure. In total, their plans will result in over 2,500 charge points in the first year and over 11,000 in the next three years, at a variety of publicly accessible car parks, transport hubs and workplaces.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/sustainable/olev/infrastructure/&lt;/ref&gt;

The London mayor called for an E-revolution in March 2009 and he presented the "Electric Delivery Plan for London" in May 2009.&lt;ref name="london2009"&gt;[http://legacy.london.gov.uk/mayor/publications/2009/docs/electric-vehicles-plan.pdf "Electric Delivery Plan for London"].&lt;/ref&gt; The plan projects 25,000 charging points London by 2015 including 500 on-street, 2000 off-street in car-parks and 22,000 privately owned locations. London itself will buy 1000 electric vehicles up to 2015. Owners of an electric car will not need to pay the Congestion Charge for the city of London being worth up to £1,700 a year. At that point (May 2009) London already had 100 charge points in public places which will be increased to 250 by 2012. Beginning 2011 20% of new lots in car parks must have access to a charging outlet. Additionally, the parking in the Westminster boroughs will be free for electric vehicles saving the user up to £6,000 a year and a flat rate of £200 electricity cost is charged for the usage of public outlets in Westminster.

As of February 2011 the "Source London" project has contracted Siemens to build a network of public charging stations in London. At least 1,300 charging points will be installed by the end of 2013 in public locations and streets across the Capital. Transport for London (TfL) has also finalised a contract that will see Siemens manage the operation of the network and registration of drivers. The deal between TfL and Siemens will see Siemens run the Source London back office to March 2014 at no cost.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sourcelondon.net/mayor-builds-source-power-electric-drivers "Charge points start to be installed for Source London"], press release, Source London, 14 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Up to July 2011 there were 180 charging stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sourcelondon.net/londons-electric-plans-charge-ahead|title=16 suppliers sign up to help public bodies buy greener vehicles|author=London Source|at=press release|date=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in November 2011 more than 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sourcelondon.net/london-charges-ahead-wireless-electric-vehicle-technology|title=London charges ahead with wireless electric vehicle technology|publisher=Source London|date=2011-11-10|accessdate=2012-03-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424030306/https://www.sourcelondon.net/london-charges-ahead-wireless-electric-vehicle-technology|archivedate=2012-04-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of charging stations reached 790 in October 2012 with plans to increase that to 1300 in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sourcelondon.net/electric-vehicles-now-able-roam-between-london-and-eastern-england|title=Electric vehicles now able to roam between London and Eastern England|publisher=Source Londone|date=2012-10-24|accessdate=2012-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of 1300 publicly accessible charging stations was met on 16 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sourcelondon.net/source-london-charges-ahead-deliver-1300-electric-vehicle-charging-points|title=Source London charges ahead to deliver 1,300 electric vehicle charging points|date=2013-05-16|accessdate=2013-11-24|publisher=Source London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011 a charity called ''Zero Carbon World'' announced their ''Charge Points Everywhere'' network, their aim is to help business's install free to use charge points on their business's with the implicit understanding the person using the charge point will use the services of that business. The connections themselves are standard 32 and 13amp connectors and the inclusion of the 32amp connector means that car with powerful chargers such as [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla]] can charge much faster than with the 13a connectors on the majority of chargers&lt;ref name="zerocarbonworld.org"&gt;http://zerocarbonworld.org/zcw-charging-stations&lt;/ref&gt; On February 15, 2012, the alliance announce to donate 1000 charging stations for free adding up on the existing 76 charging stations that are already deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zerocarbonworld.org/charging-stations/proactive-approach-to-green-technology?cat_id=4|title=Proactive Approach to Green Technology|publisher=ZeroCarbonWorld.org|date=2012-02-15|accessdate=2012-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Plugged-In Places" program of the Department of Transport offers grants for charging station networks in the United Kingdom. The development plan identifies 8 regions to be in a strategic focus – Central Scotland, the East of England, Greater Manchester, Milton Keynes, the North East of England and Northern Ireland – with a target of 8500 chargepoints.&lt;!-- section 3.11 --&gt;&lt;ref name="plugged-in-places-2011" /&gt; Following the ACEA position paper the government program favours moving to a dedicated recharging connector of Type 2 Mode 3.&lt;!-- section 3.16 --&gt;&lt;ref name="plugged-in-places-2011"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/making-the-connection-the-plug-in-vehicle-infrastructure-strategy/plug-in-vehicle-infrastructure-strategy.pdf|title=Making the Connection – The Plug-In Vehicle Infrastructure Strategy|format=pdf|publisher=Office for Low Emission Vehicles – Department for Transport|date=June 2011|accessdate=2012-01-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131052149/http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/making-the-connection-the-plug-in-vehicle-infrastructure-strategy/plug-in-vehicle-infrastructure-strategy.pdf|archivedate=2012-01-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the PIP program an open tender in Newcastle upon Tyne identifies the goal to have 75% of the charging stations to offer Type 2 Mode 3 sockets including to switch over existing charging stations to that type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tendersdirect.co.uk/Search/Tenders/Expired.aspx?ID=%20000000003332781&amp;sect=R146&amp;cat=30&amp;Source=Categories|title=UK-Newcastle Upon Tyne: supply of EV charging leads|date=2011-06-22|accessdate=2012-01-05|quote=It has become clear that the general position in Europe regarding Electric Vehicle charging is to utilise Mode 3 charging protocol, and the UK (PEL69 / JPEL 64 BSI Technical Committee's) have issued their position paper to the EU to state that the UK will support the use of a Type 2 connector. This necessitates a change to the existing installed and delivered infrastructure to become compliant with these enhanced standards of charging. One North East Plugged in Places project has a plan to ensure approx 75% of the overall estate of public charging points are Type 2 connector and mode 3 protocol. The plan is to complete this physical changeover before 31/3/12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel has enacted policies that create a tax differential between [[zero-emission vehicle]]s and traditional cars, to accelerate the transition to [[electric car]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thebreakthrough.org/blog/2008/05/israel_leads_quest_for_electri.shtml | title=Israel Leads Quest for Electric Car | accessdate=2008-07-29 | date=2008-05-13 | publisher= The Breakthrough Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Better Place began to build its first electric vehicle network in [[Israel]] in conjunction with French car-maker, [[Renault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israel21c.org/briefs/israels-better-place-and-renault-partner-in-first-mass-market-electric-vehicle|title=Israel's Better Place and Renault partner in first mass-market electric vehicle|publisher=&lt;!--[http://www.israel21c.org/environment/]--&gt; Israel 21c Innovation News Service|accessdate=2009-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company conducted its first market tests in [[Israel]], [[Denmark]] and [[Hawaii]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.betterplace.com/press-room/press-releases-detail/governor-lingle-and-better-place-announce-partnership-to-offer-national-blu/ | title=Governor Lingle and Better Place Announce Partnership to Offer National Blueprint for Clean Energy in Transportation | date=2008-12-02 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226130517/http://www.betterplace.com/press-room/press-releases-detail/governor-lingle-and-better-place-announce-partnership-to-offer-national-blu/ | archivedate=2009-02-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; because their small size also made them suitable as test markets.&lt;ref name="NYT0409"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/19/magazine/19car-t.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ref=magazinene| title=Batteries Not Included  | publisher=New York Times | author=Clive Thompson|date=2009-04-16 | accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Better Place opened its first functional charging station in [[Israel]] the first week of December 2008 at Cinema City in Pi-Glilot, and additional stations were planned in [[Tel Aviv]], [[Haifa]], [[Kfar Saba]], [[Holon]], and [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energyefficiencynews.com/transport/i/1688/ |title=Japan to work with Better Place on electric vehicles |publisher=Energy Efficiency News |date=2008-12-11 |accessdate=2009-04-19 |language= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429102951/http://www.energyefficiencynews.com/transport/i/1688/ |archivedate=2009-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 Better Place presented a detailed plan for network construction, including 40 battery swap stations and 400 charging stations across Israel. 200 locations were said to be under construction or planned at the end of 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betterplace.com/the-company-pressroom-pressreleases-detail/index/id/better-place-unveils-network-deployment-roadmap-for-israel-offering-electric-car-drivers-complete-nationwide-coverage-by-end-of-year "Better Place Unveils Network Deployment Roadmap for Israel, Offering Electric Car Drivers Complete Nationwide Coverage by End of Year"], press release, Better Place, 23 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; but that goal was not reached. On 26 May 2013, Better Place filed for bankruptcy in Israel, having terminated its projects in most markets.

Gnrgy, originally a producer of mobile charging solutions, entered the market as an alternative to Betterplace. On 29 February 2012 it partnered with Pango, provider of parking billing solutions, to set up a series of charging stations throughout Israel.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.4evriders.org/2012/02/isreal-kardan-pango-to-set-up-electrical-car-charging-stations/&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==

In 1993, then President [[Bill Clinton]] proposed a BTU tax. A BTU tax is a type of energy tax (Baron, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;14).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|year=1997

|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/36/50/2392474.pdf
|accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax would have taxed all fuel sources based on their heat content except for wind, solar, and geothermal.  It was never adopted. The BTU tax passed the House, but was rejected by the Senate in light of the lobbying effort mobilized against its adoption. The rejected proposal was watered down, as the Clinton administration tried to salvage their efforts by offering to exempt manufacturers and base the tax on the cost rather than the heat content of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Hilzenrath, David S. "Miscalculations, Lobby Effort Doomed Btu Tax Plan." ''The Washington Post'' (June 11, 1993).&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of the House Democrats who voted for the tax and who lost their seats in the 1994 midterm election, blamed their loss on their vote for the BTU tax. Getting "BTU'd" became Beltway slang at the time for those who lost reelection by voting for the controversial proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Nordhaus, Ted. "Getting Real on Climate Change," T''he American Prospect'' (December 1, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colorado===

On 7 November 2006, citizens of [[Boulder, Colorado]] (a city with roughly 100,000 residents situated in the foothills of the Rocky Mtns) voted in favor of initiative 202, the [[Boulder Climate Action Plan]] Tax. That marks the first time in the nation that a municipal government has imposed an energy tax directly upon its residents to combat global warming. It applies to energy consumption with deductions for carbon-neutral and renewable energy sources (such as [[Xcel Energy]]’s WindSource).

The tax appears on consumer's energy bills and is used to fund the city’s Office of Environmental Affairs that is in charge of programs designed to reduce Boulder's [[carbon footprint]].

The CAP tax is to generate roughly $1 million annually. The City Council has the authority to increase the rates as needed. As of October 2009, the rate is assigned as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The '''Ghana Nuclear Society''' (GNS) is a [[nonprofit]] organization that advocates for the introduction of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] in [[Ghana]]. It is headquartered at the [[Ghana Atomic Energy Commission]] (GAEC) in [[Accra]]. With the establishment of The Ghana Nuclear Society, Ghana has joined the league of those countries with National Nuclear Societies. Its head office is located at the Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC) in Accra. The current national president is Prof. John Justice Fletcher. The society is not for science inclined persons alone.

==History==

The Ghana Nuclear Society received its certificate of incorporation on 13 May 2008. The society, which operates under the motto "Nuclear for Sustainable Energy Development," has an eight-member Advisory Panel that consults with the Board of Directors, which is made up of 13 persons and four members from the National and Student Chapter Executives.

The society has created public information programs on nuclear matters, and it has produced seminars, educational outreach programs and interactive media presentations on local radio and television stations. It also publishes a newsletter that outlines issues relating to nuclear energy.

It is planning educational programs at the SAMBEL Academy and the GAEC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaecgh.org/index.html |title=Ghana Atomic Energy Commission (GAEC) |publisher=Gaecgh.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304033506/http://www.gaecgh.org/index.html |archivedate=2012-03-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at primary schools located near the Graduate School of Nuclear and Allied Sciences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Austria |url=http://www.iaea.org/inisnkm/nkm/documents/nkmCon2007/fulltext/ES/IAEA-CN-153-4-P-04_es.pdf |title=Nuclear Knowledge Management - IAEA Nuclear Knowledge Management |publisher=Iaea.org |date=2012-06-12 |accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Atomic, Kwabeyna.

[[File:Ekling Heliostat.JPG|thumb|right|Heliostat by the Viennese instrument maker [[Johann Michael Ekling|Ekling]] (ca. 1850)]]

A '''heliostat''' (from ''[[helios]]'', the Greek word for ''sun'', and ''stat'', as in stationary) is a device that includes a mirror, usually a [[plane mirror]], which turns so as to keep reflecting sunlight toward a predetermined target, compensating for the sun's apparent motions in the sky. The target may be a physical object, distant from the heliostat, or a direction in space. To do this, the reflective surface of the mirror is kept [[perpendicular]] to the [[bisection|bisector]] of the [[angle]] between the directions of the sun and the target as seen from the mirror. In almost every case, the target is stationary relative to the heliostat, so the light is reflected in a fixed direction. According to contemporary sources the heliostata, as it was called at first, was invented by [[Willem 's Gravesande]] (1688-1742).&lt;ref&gt;''A New and Complete Dictionary of Arts and Sciences,'' vol 2, London, 1763, p. 1600&lt;/ref&gt; Other contenders are [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli]] (1608-1679) and [[Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit]] (1686-1736).&lt;ref&gt;Pieter van der Star, ''Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit's Letters to Leibniz and Boerhaave,'' Leiden 1983, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, most heliostats are used for [[daylighting]] or for the production of [[concentrated solar power]], usually to generate electricity. They are also sometimes used in [[solar cooking]]. A few are used experimentally, or to reflect motionless beams of sunlight into [[solar telescope]]s. Before the availability of [[laser]]s and other electric lights, heliostats were widely used to produce intense, stationary beams of light for scientific and other purposes.

Most modern heliostats are controlled by computers. The computer is given the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the heliostat's position on the earth and the time and date. From these, using [[astronomical]] theory, it calculates the direction of the sun as seen from the mirror, e.g. its compass bearing and angle of elevation. Then, given the direction of the target, the computer calculates the direction of the required angle-bisector, and sends control signals to [[Electric motor|motors]], often [[stepper motor]]s, so they turn the mirror to the correct alignment. This sequence of operations is repeated frequently to keep the mirror properly oriented.

Large installations such as solar-thermal power stations include '''fields of heliostats''' comprising many mirrors. Usually, all the mirrors in such a field are controlled by a single computer.

There are older types of heliostat which do not use computers, including ones that are partly or wholly operated by hand or by [[clockwork]], or are controlled by light-[[sensors]]. These are now quite rare.

Heliostats should be distinguished from [[solar tracker]]s or sun-trackers that point directly at the sun in the sky. However, some older types of heliostat incorporate solar trackers, together with additional components to bisect the sun-mirror-target angle.

A '''siderostat''' is a similar device which is designed to follow a fainter [[star]], rather than the sun.

[[Image:heliostat.jpg|right|260px|thumb|A heliostat at the [[Themis (solar power plant)|THÉMIS]] experimental station in France. The mirror rotates on an [[altazimuth mount]].]]
[[Image:Solar two.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The [[Solar Energy Generating Systems|Solar Two]] [[Solar thermal energy|solar-thermal]] power project near [[Daggett, California]]. Every mirror in the field of heliostats reflects sunlight continuously onto the receiver on the tower.]]
[[Image:PS10 solar power tower 2.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The 11MW [[PS10]] near Seville in Spain. When this picture was taken, dust in the air made the converging light visible.]]
[[Image:Font Romeu France.jpg|thumb|right|260px|The [[Odeillo solar furnace|solar furnace]] at [[Font-Romeu-Odeillo-Via|Odeillo]] in the [[Pyrenees-Orientales]] in France can reach temperatures up to {{convert|3500|C|F}}]]

==Large-scale projects==
In a solar-thermal power plant, like those of [[The Solar Project]] or the [[PS10]] plant in Spain, a wide field of heliostats focuses the sun's power onto a single collector to heat a medium such as water or molten salt. The medium travels through a heat exchanger to heat water, produce steam, and then generate electricity through a steam turbine.

A somewhat different arrangement of heliostats in a field is used at experimental solar furnaces, such as the one at [[Font-Romeu-Odeillo-Via|Odeillo]], in France. All the heliostat mirrors send accurately parallel beams of light into a large paraboloidal reflector which brings them to a precise focus. The mirrors have to be located close enough to the axis of the paraboloid to reflect sunlight into it along lines parallel to the axis, so the field of heliostats has to be narrow. A [[Control theory#Closed-loop transfer function|closed loop]] control system is used. Sensors determine if any of the heliostats is slightly misaligned. If so, they send signals to correct it.

It has been proposed that the high temperatures generated could be used to split water producing hydrogen sustainably.&lt;ref name=Hydrogen&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = D.| first2 = N.| first3 = M.| first4 = M.| first5 = C.| title = Economic comparison of solar hydrogen generation by means of thermochemical cycles and electrolysis| journal = International Journal of Hydrogen Energy| volume = 33| issue = 17| pages = 4511–4519| last1 = Graf| year = 2008| doi = 10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.05.086| last2 = Monnerie| last3 = Roeb| last4 = Schmitz| last5 = Sattler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Small-scale projects==
Smaller heliostats are used for [[daylighting]] and heating. Instead of many large heliostats focusing on a single target to concentrate solar power (as in a solar power tower plant), a single heliostat usually about 1 or 2 square meters in size reflects non-concentrated sunlight through a window or skylight. A small heliostat, installed outside on the ground or on a building structure like a roof, moves on two axes (up/down and left/right) in order to compensate for the constant movement of the sun. In this way, the reflected sunlight stays fixed on the target (e.g. window).

Genzyme Center, corporate headquarters of Genzyme Corp. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, uses heliostats on the roof to direct sunlight into its12-story atrium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leedcasestudies.usgbc.org/overview.cfm?ProjectID=274 U.S. Green Building Council: LEED Case Studies] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201001133/http://leedcasestudies.usgbc.org/overview.cfm?ProjectID=274 |date=2009-12-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tac.com/data/internal/data/05/10/1170706633557/Customer+Q_A+with+Genzyme.pdf Interview with Lou Capozzi, Facilities Manager of Genzyme Center]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100108004815/http://www.tac.com/data/internal/data/05/10/1170706633557/Customer%20Q_A%20with%20Genzyme.pdf |date=January 8, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 article, Bruce Rohr suggested that small heliostats could be used like a solar power tower system.&lt;ref&gt;Rohr, B. “The Promise of Small Heliostats”. Northeast Sun. Spring 2009. pp.7-12  link is broken {{cite web|url=http://www.nesea.org/uploads/universe/docs/wysiwyg/documents/nesea-sp09_Small_Heliostats.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226051024/http://www.nesea.org/uploads/universe/docs/wysiwyg/documents/nesea-sp09_Small_Heliostats.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-26 |df= }}; backup of pdf available in&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of occupying hundreds of acres, the system would fit in a much smaller area, like the flat rooftop of a commercial building, he said. The proposed system would use the power in sunlight to heat and cool a building or to provide input for thermal industrial processes like processing food. The cooling would be performed with an [[absorption chiller]]. Mr. Rohr proposed that the system would be “more reliable and more cost-effective per square meter of reflective area” than large solar power tower plants, in part because it would not be sacrificing 80 percent of the power collected in the process of converting it to electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Rohr, B. “The Promise of Small Heliostats”. Northeast Sun. Spring 2009. p.9 {{cite web|url=http://www.nesea.org/uploads/universe/docs/wysiwyg/documents/nesea-sp09_Small_Heliostats.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226051024/http://www.nesea.org/uploads/universe/docs/wysiwyg/documents/nesea-sp09_Small_Heliostats.pdf |archivedate=2010-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
Heliostat costs represent 30-50% of the initial capital investment for solar power tower power plants depending on the energy policy and economic framework in the location country.&lt;ref name=Materials&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = R.| first2 = J.| title = Materials issues in solar thermal energy systems| last1 = Mar| journal = Solar Energy Materials| volume = 5| pages = 37–41| year = 1981| doi = 10.1016/0165-1633(81)90057-5| last2 =  Swearengen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CRSsystems&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = J.

Besides cost, percent solar reflectivity (i.e. [[albedo]]) and environmental durability are factors that should be considered when comparing heliostat designs.

One way that engineers and researchers are attempting to lower the costs of heliostats is by replacing the conventional heliostat design with one that uses fewer, lighter materials. A conventional design for the heliostat's reflective components utilizes a second surface mirror. The sandwich-like mirror structure generally consists of a steel structural support, an adhesive layer, a protective copper layer, a layer of reflective silver, and a top protective layer of thick glass.&lt;ref name=Materials/&gt; This conventional heliostat is often referred to as a glass/metal heliostat. Alternative designs incorporate recent adhesive, composite, and thin film research to bring about materials costs and weight reduction. Some examples of alternative reflector designs are silvered polymer reflectors, glass fiber reinforced polyester sandwiches (GFRPS), and aluminized reflectors.&lt;ref name=Candidate&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = C. E.| first2 = K.| title = Optical Durability of Candidate Solar Reflectors| last1 = Kennedy| journal = Journal of Solar Energy Engineering| volume = 127| issue = 2| pages = 262–268| year = 2005| doi = 10.1115/1.1861926| last2 = Terwilliger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems with these more recent designs include delamination of the protective coatings, reduction in percent solar reflectivity over long periods of sun exposure, and high manufacturing costs.

==Tracking alternatives==
{{refimprove|date=November 2011}}
The movement of most modern heliostats employs a two-axis motorized system, controlled by computer as outlined at the start of this article. Almost always, the primary rotation axis is vertical and the secondary horizontal, so the mirror is on an [[Altazimuth mount|alt-azimuth mount]].

One simple alternative is for the mirror to rotate around a [[Polar alignment|polar aligned]] primary axis, driven by a mechanical, often clockwork, mechanism at 15&amp;nbsp;degrees per hour, compensating for the earth's rotation relative to the sun. The mirror is aligned to reflect sunlight along the same polar axis in the direction of one of the [[celestial pole]]s. There is a perpendicular secondary axis allowing occasional manual adjustment of the mirror (daily or less often as necessary) to compensate for the shift in the sun's [[declination]] with the seasons. The setting of the drive clock can also be occasionally adjusted to compensate for changes in the [[Equation of Time]]. The target can be located on the same polar axis that is the mirror's primary rotation axis, or a second, stationary mirror can be used to reflect light from the polar axis toward the target, wherever that might be. This kind of mirror mount and drive is often used with [[solar cooker]]s, such as [[Solar energy#Cooking|Scheffler reflectors]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solare-bruecke.org/English/scheffler_e-Dateien/scheffler_e.htm The Scheffler-Reflector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080422232611/http://www.solare-bruecke.org/English/scheffler_e-Dateien/scheffler_e.htm |date=2008-04-22 }}, retrieved 5-June-2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://davidmdelaney.com/scheffler-precis/scheffler-precis.html Notes on Scheffler Community Kitchens] David Delaney, rev 22-Feb-2009, retrieved 5-June-2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Illustration at [http://solarcooking.org/images/more/cpc/A-Scheffler%20into%20vault%207-31-02.jpg solarcooking.org], downloaded 5-June-2011&lt;/ref&gt; For this application, the mirror can be [[Curved mirror#Concave mirrors|concave]], so as to concentrate sunlight onto the cooking vessel.

The '''alt-azimuth''' and '''polar-axis''' alignments are two of the three orientations for two-axis mounts that are, or have been, commonly used for heliostat mirrors. The third is the '''target-axis''' arrangement in which the primary axis points toward the target at which sunlight is to be reflected. The secondary axis is perpendicular to the primary one. Heliostats controlled by light-sensors have used this orientation. A small arm carries sensors that control motors that turn the arm around the two axes, so it points toward the sun. (Thus this design incorporates a solar tracker.) A simple mechanical arrangement bisects the angle between the primary axis, pointing to the target, and the arm, pointing to the sun. The mirror is mounted so its reflective surface is perpendicular to this bisector. This type of heliostat was used for [[daylighting]] prior to the availability of cheap computers, but after the initial availability of sensor control hardware.

There are heliostat designs which do not require the rotation axes to have any exact orientation. For example, there may be light-sensors close to the target which send signals to motors so that they correct the alignment of the mirror whenever the beam of reflected light drifts away from the target. The directions of the axes need be only approximately known, since the system is intrinsically self-correcting. However, there are disadvantages, such as that the mirror has to be manually realigned every morning and after any prolonged cloudy spell, since the reflected beam, when it reappears, misses the sensors, so the system cannot correct the orientation of the mirror. There are also geometrical problems which limit the functioning of the heliostat when the directions of the sun and the target, as seen from the mirror, are very different. Because of the disadvantages, this design has never been commonly used, but some people do experiment with it.

Typically, the heliostat mirror moves at a rate that is 1/2 the angular motion of the sun. There is another arrangement that satisfies the definition of a heliostat yet has a mirror motion that is 2/3rd of the motion of the sun.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.redrok.com/main.htm#2/3motion&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other types of heliostat have also occasionally been used. In the very earliest heliostats, for example, which were used for daylighting in ancient Egypt, servants or slaves kept the mirrors aligned manually, without using any kind of mechanism. (There are places in Egypt where this is done today, for the benefit of tourists. In the movie [[The Fifth Element]] an Egyptian boy holds a mirror to illuminate a wall inside a cave for a fictional archaeologist.) Elaborate clockwork heliostats were made during the 19th Century which could reflect sunlight to a target in any direction using only a single mirror, minimizing light losses, and which automatically compensated for the sun's seasonal movements. Some of these devices are still to be seen in museums, but they are not used for practical purposes today. Amateurs sometimes come up with ''ad hoc'' designs which work approximately, in some particular location, without any theoretical justification. An essentially limitless number of such designs are possible.

A {{Nihongo||駕籠|'''kago'''}} is a type of [[Litter (vehicle)|litter]] used as a means of human transportation by the non-samurai class in feudal Japan and into the [[Meiji period]].

==Description and use==
The basket of the kago was about three feet long and it was attached to bamboo uprights which were suspended by a large overhead single crossbeam. A roof of some type covered the top and screens could be used to cover the sides as protection from sun or rain. The kago was carried by a team of four men who took turns carrying the kago on their shoulders, five or six miles could be traveled in one hour. One man would support the weight of the large overhead pole at each end and walked until he tired and switched with a rested carrier.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3_kLAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA277&amp;dq=kago&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CLgzT7z8OoaXtwf4_q2mAg&amp;ved=0CFAQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=kago&amp;f=true ''An artist's letters from Japan'', Author John La Farge, Publisher The Century co., 1897, Original from the University of California, Digitized Mar 13, 2009 P.277]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oViARV9w59wC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=kago+litter&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YMAzT4XzD4PAtgeti8m8Ag&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=kago%20litter&amp;f=true ''Belgravia'', Volume 35, Author Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Publisher Willmer &amp; Rogers, 1878 P.58]&lt;/ref&gt; The kago should not be confused with the more elaborate ''[[Commons:Category:Norimono (Japanese palanquin)|norimono]]''  which were used by the samurai class and wealthy individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=64MEAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA330&amp;dq=norimono&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ntEzT6b7N9SJtweoh7mfAg&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=norimono&amp;f=true ''The Nautical magazine: a journal of papers on subjects connected with maritime affairs'', Volume 11, Publisher	Brown, Son and Ferguson, 1842.

'''Khushab Nuclear Complex''' is a plutonium production [[nuclear reactor]] and [[heavy water]] complex situated 30&amp;nbsp;km south of the town of [[Jauharabad]] in [[Khushab District]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]].

The heavy water and natural [[uranium]] reactors at Khushab are a central element of Pakistan's program to produce [[plutonium]] and [[tritium]] for use in compact [[atomic weapon|nuclear warhead]]s. Khushab Nuclear Complex, like that at [[Kahuta Research Laboratories|Kahuta]], is not subject to [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] inspections.

Four currently operating reactors have capacities variously reported at between 40&amp;nbsp;[[MWth]] to 50&amp;nbsp;MWth, and as high as 70&amp;nbsp;MWth. In total, they are estimated to be capable of producing 44&amp;nbsp;kg of weapons grade plutonium annually.&lt;ref name=complete&gt;[http://www.fissilematerials.org/blog/2010/02/pakistan_may_have_complet.html Pakistan may have completed new plutonium production reactor, Khushab-II]&lt;/ref&gt; Plutonium production and [[nuclear reprocessing]] facilities are being expanded at Khushab, [[Pakistan Atomic Research Reactor#New Labs|New Labs]] and Chashma.

Pakistan's first indigenous nuclear reactor was commissioned at Khushab in March&amp;nbsp;1996. The Khushab Nuclear Complex was conceived and planned by the then chairman of the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission]] (PAEC), [[Munir Ahmad Khan]], who began work on the 50 MWth Khushab-I reactor and heavy water plant in 1986. He appointed [[nuclear engineer]] [[Sultan Bashiruddin Mahmood]] and Dr. N.A. Javed, both from the [[Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission|PAEC]], as the Project-Directors for the reactor and the heavy water plant respectively.&lt;ref&gt;MA Chaudhri, "Pakistan's Nuclear History: Separating Myth from Reality," ''Defence Journal,'' May, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Pakistani press report this reactor began operating in early 1998.&lt;ref&gt;"Pakistan's Indigenous Nuclear Reactor Starts Up," [[Islamabad]] The Nation, April 13, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the success of these projects and the experience and capability gained during their construction, onsite construction work on the second unit began around 2001 or 2002. In February 2010 [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Yousaf Raza Gillani]] and senior military officers attended a ceremony at the Khushab complex for what is believed to be the completion of the second reactor.&lt;ref name=complete /&gt; There has been little to no government comment on the complex or other aspects of the [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons program]] since the late 1990s.

Judging by external appearance all but the first reactor are similar or identical in design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theasiandefence.blogspot.com/2009/05/update-on-khushab-plutonium-production.html Asian Defence]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kudurru of Gula''' is a boundary stone ([[Kudurru]]) for the [[Babylon]]ian [[goddess]] [[Nintinugga|Gula]]. Gula is the goddess of healing. It is from the 14th century - 13th century BC [[Kassites|Kassite]] [[Babylon]]ia, and is located at the [[Louvre]].

The ''Kudurru of Gula'' shows Gula seated on her chair with her dog adjacent. Another side of the kudurru has [[Register (sculpture)|register]]s representing symbols of gods, and also sections of [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]] text.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6387">'''Lignocellulose ''' refers to plant dry matter ([[biomass]]), so called lignocellulosic biomass. It is the most abundantly available raw material on the [[Earth]] for the production of [[biofuels]], mainly [[bio-ethanol]]. It is composed of carbohydrate polymers ([[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]]), and an aromatic polymer ([[lignin]]). These carbohydrate polymers contain different sugar monomers (six and five carbon sugars) and they are tightly bound to lignin. Lignocellulosic biomass can be broadly classified into virgin biomass, [[waste biomass]] and [[energy crops]]. Virgin biomass includes all naturally occurring terrestrial plants such as trees, bushes and grass. Waste biomass is produced as a low value byproduct of various industrial sectors such as [[agriculture]] ([[corn stover]], sugarcane [[bagasse]], straw etc.) and [[forestry]] ([[saw mill]] and [[paper mill]] discards). [[Energy crops]] are crops with high yield of lignocellulosic biomass produced to serve as a raw material for production of second generation biofuel; examples include switch grass(''[[Panicum virgatum]]'') and [[Elephant grass]].

==Dedicated energy crops==
Many crops are of interest for their ability to provide high yields of biomass and can be harvested multiple times each year. These include [[Populus|poplar]] trees and ''[[Miscanthus giganteus]]''. The premier energy crop is [[sugarcane]], which is a source of the readily fermentable [[sucrose]] and the lignocellulosic by-product [[bagasse]].&lt;!--biosynthesis of Lignocellulose??--&gt;

==Application==

===Pulp and paper industry===
Lignocellulosic biomass is the feedstock for the [[pulp and paper industry]]. This energy-intensive industry focuses on the separation of the lignin and cellulosic fractions of the biomass.

===Biofuels===
Lignocellulosic biomass, in the form of [[wood fuel]], has a long history as a source of energy. Since the middle of the 20th century, the interest of biomass as a precursor to ''liquid'' fuels has increased. To be specific, the [[ethanol fermentation|fermentation]] of lignocellulosic biomass to [[ethanol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=Andrew|last2=Somerville|first2=Chris|title=Cellulosic Biofuels|journal=Annual Review of Plant Biology|date=June 2009|volume=60|issue=1|pages=165–182|doi=10.1146/annurev.arplant.043008.092125}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an attractive route to fuels that supplements the [[fossil fuels]]. Biomass is a carbon-neutral source of energy: Since it comes from plants, the combustion of lignocellulosic ethanol produces no net carbon dioxide into the [[Atmosphere of Earth|earth’s atmosphere]]. Aside from ethanol, many other lignocellulose-derived fuels are of potential interest, including [[butanol]], [[2,5-Dimethylfuran|dimethylfuran]], and [[gamma-Valerolactone]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Tokay "Biomass Chemicals" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2002, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a04_099}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One barrier to the production of ethanol from biomass is that the sugars necessary for fermentation are trapped inside the lignocellulose. Lignocellulose has evolved to resist degradation and to confer [[hydrolysis|hydrolytic]] stability and structural robustness to the cell walls of the plants. This robustness or "recalcitrance" is attributable to the crosslinking between the polysaccharides (cellulose and hemicellulose) and the lignin via [[ester]] and [[ether]] linkages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science|title=Breaking the Biological Barriers to Cellulosic Ethanol: A Joint Research Agenda. Report from the December 2005 Workshop|url=http://genomicsgtl.energy.gov/biofuels/2005workshop/b2blowres63006.pdf|format=PDF|date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ester linkages arise between oxidized sugars, the [[uronic acid]]s, and the phenols and phenylpropanols functionalities of the lignin. To extract the fermentable sugars, one must first disconnect the celluloses from the lignin, and then use acid or enzymatic methods to [[hydrolyze]] the newly freed celluloses to break them down into simple monosaccharides. Another challenge to biomass fermentation is the high percentage of pentoses in the hemicellulose, such as [[xylose]], or wood sugar. Unlike hexoses such as glucose, pentoses are difficult to ferment. The problems presented by the lignin and hemicellulose fractions are the foci of much contemporary research.

A large sector of research into the exploitation of lignocellulosic biomass as a feedstock for bio-ethanol focuses particularly on the fungus ''[[Trichoderma reesei]]'', known for its cellulolytic abilities. Multiple avenues are being explored including the design of an optimised cocktail of cellulases and hemicellulases isolated from ''T. reesei'', as well as genetic-engineering-based strain improvement to allow the fungus to simply be placed in the presence of lignocellulosic biomass and break down the matter into [[Glucose|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-glucose]] [[monomer|monomers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Monot|first1=Frederic|last2=Margeot|first2=Antoine|title=Biofuels turn to fungus - Interview with Frédéric Monot and Antoine Margeot, Applied Chemistry and Physical Chemistry Division at IFPEN|url=http://www.ifpenergiesnouvelles.com/Expertise/Research-divisions/Applied-chemistry-and-physical-chemistry/Biofuels-turn-to-fungus-Interview-with-Frederic-Monot-and-Antoine-Margeot-Applied-Chemistry-and-Physical-Chemistry-Division-at-IFPEN|website=IFP Energies nouvelles|accessdate=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strain improvement methods have led to strains capable of producing significantly more cellulases than the original QM6a isolate; certain industrial strains are known to produce up to 100g of cellulase per litre of fungus&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary''' ('''LAB''') represents a [[Mechanics|mechanical]] difference between layers in Earth’s inner structure.  Earth’s inner structure can be described both [[Chemical substance|chemically]] ([[Crust (geology)|crust]], [[Mantle (geology)|mantle]], [[Core (geology)|core]]) and mechanically. The Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary (referred to as the LAB by geophysicists) lies between Earth's cooler, rigid [[lithosphere]] and the warmer, ductile [[asthenosphere]]. The actual depth of the boundary is still a topic of debate and study, although it is known to vary according to the environment.&lt;ref name="globalview"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rychert|first1=Catherine A.|last2=Shearer|first2=Peter M.|title=A Global View of the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary|journal=Science|date=24 April 2009|volume=324|issue=5926|pages=495–498|doi=10.1126/science.1169754|pmid=19390041|bibcode=2009Sci...324..495R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earth's_Inner_Layers_denoting_the_LAB.png|thumb|alt=A color diagram of the internal structure of Earth|A diagram of the internal structure of Earth|upright=1.35]]

==Defining the LAB==
The LAB is determined from the differences in the lithosphere and asthenosphere including, but not limited to, differences in grain size, chemical composition, thermal properties, and extent of partial melt; these are factors that affect the rheological differences in the lithosphere and asthenosphere.

The lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary represents a [[rheology|rheological]] boundary. Colder temperatures at Earth's shallower depths affect the viscosity and strength of the lithosphere. Colder material in the lithosphere resists flow while the "warmer" material in the asthenosphere contributes to its lower viscosity. The increase in temperature with increasing depth is known as the [[geothermal gradient]] and is gradual within the rheological boundary layer. The lithosphere is the portion of the [[Thermal Convection|thermal boundary layer]] commonly defined by its purely conductive heat transport. Throughout the rheological boundary, the geotherm gradually transitions from the conductive nature of the lithospheric geotherm to the convective (adiabatic) nature of the underlying asthenosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sleep|first1=Norman|title=Evolution of the Continental Lithosphere|journal=Annu. Rev. Earth Planet. Sci.|date=2005|volume=33|pages=369–393|doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.33.092203.122643|bibcode=2005AREPS..33..369S}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes other definitions of the asthenosphere and LAB are used, e.g. seismic asthenosphere is a layer of low velocity and high attenuation of the [[seismic wave]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, A. G., Plomerova, J., Korja, T., Sodoudi, F., &amp; Spakman, W., 2010. Lithos, 120(1-2), 14-29. DOI: 10.1016/j.lithos.2010.07.013&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the rheology of the rocks depends also on the stress tensor. It means that asthenosphere could be of thermal and/or mechanical origin.&lt;ref&gt;http://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU2016/EGU2016-10917.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gutenberg Discontinuity===
The LAB is often observed and imaged via signal processing techniques and seismic waves. [[Seismic tomography|Seismic tomographic]] studies suggests that the LAB is not determined by a purely thermal model, but rather it is affected by the presence of partial melt material in the asthenosphere. Evidence from converted seismic phases indicates a sharp decrease in [[S-wave|shear-wave]] velocity 90–110&amp;nbsp;km below continental crust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rychert|first1=Catherine|last2=Fischer|first2=Karen|last3=Rondenay|first3=Ste´phane|title=A sharp lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary imaged beneath eastern North America|journal=Nature|date=July 2005|volume=436|issue=28|pages=542–545|doi=10.1038/nature03904|pmid=16049485|bibcode=2005Natur.436..542R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent seismological studies indicate a 5 to 10 percent reduction in shear-wave velocity in the depth range of 35 to 120&amp;nbsp;km beneath ocean basins. The seismic discontinuity often associated with this sharp contrast in wave velocity and presence of partial melt is known as the Gutenberg discontinuity or "G" to many geophysicists. The Gutenberg discontinuity coincides with the expected LAB depth in many studies and has also been found to become deeper under older crust, thus supporting the suggestion that the discontinuity is closely interrelated to the LAB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmerr|first1=Nicholas|title=The Gutenberg Discontinuity: Melt at the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundary|journal=Science|date=2012|volume=335|pages=1480–1483|doi=10.1126/science.1215433|bibcode=2012Sci...335.1480S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beneath oceanic lithosphere===

Beneath oceanic crust, the LAB ranges anywhere from 50 to 140&amp;nbsp;km in depth except at [[mid-ocean ridge]]s where the LAB is no deeper than the depth of the new crust being created.&lt;ref name= "lithodispersion"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pasyanos|first1=Michael|title=Lithospheric thickness modeled from long period surface wave dispersion|date=2008|url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/361453.pdf|accessdate=26 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seismic evidence shows that oceanic plates do thicken with age. This would suggest that the Lithosphere-Asthenosphere boundary underneath oceanic lithosphere also deepens with plate age. Data from ocean seismometers indicate a sharp age-dependent LAB beneath the [[Pacific Plate|Pacific]] and [[Philippine Plate|Philippine]] plates and has been interpreted as evidence for a thermal control of oceanic-lithosphere thickness.&lt;ref name="sharplab"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kawakatsu|first1=Hitoshi|last2=Kumar|first2=Prakash|last3=Takei|first3=Yasuko|last4=Shinohara|first4=Masanao|last5=Kanazawa|first5=Toshihiko|last6=Araki|first6=Eiichiro|last7=Suyehiro|first7=Kiyoshi|title=Seismic Evidence for Sharp Lithosphere-Asthenosphere Boundaries of Oceanic Plates|journal=Science|date=2009|volume=324|issue=499|doi=10.1126/science.1169499|pages=499–502|pmid=19390042|bibcode=2009Sci...324..499K}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Karen M.|last2=Ford|first2=Heather|last3=Abt|first3=David|last4=Rychert|first4=Catherine|title=The LithosphereAsthenosphere Boundary|journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences|date=2010|doi=10.1146/annurev-earth-040809-152438|volume=38|pages=551–575|bibcode=2010AREPS..38..551F}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beneath continental lithosphere===

The continental lithosphere contains an ancient, stable part known as the [[craton]]. The LAB is particularly difficult to study in these regions and evidence suggests that the lithosphere within this old part of the continent is at it thickest and even appears to exhibit large variations in thickness beneath the cratons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eaton|first1=David|last2=Darbyshire|first2=Fiona|last3=Evans|first3=Rob|last4=Grutter|first4=Herman|last5=Jones|first5=Alan|last6=Yuan|first6=Xiaohui|title=The elusive lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary (LAB) beneath cratons|journal=[[Lithos (journal)|Lithos]]|date=2009|volume=109|pages=1–22|doi=10.1016/j.lithos.2008.05.009|bibcode=2009Litho.109....1E}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus supporting the theory that lithosphere thickness and LAB depth are age-dependent. Depths of the LAB beneath these regions (also known as shields and platforms) are estimated to be between 200 and 250&amp;nbsp;km deep.&lt;ref name="maplab"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plomerova|first1=Jaroslava|last2=Kouba|first2=Daniel|last3=Babusˇka|first3=Vladislav|title=Mapping the lithosphere–asthenosphere boundary through changes in surface-wave anisotropy|journal=Tectonophysics|date=2002|volume=358|pages=175–185|doi=10.1016/s0040-1951(02)00423-7|bibcode=2002Tectp.358..175P}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Beneath Phanerozoic continental crust, the LAB is roughly 100&amp;nbsp;km deep.&lt;ref name= "maplab"/&gt;

'''Ljungström air preheater''' is an [[air preheater]] invented by the Swedish engineer [[Fredrik Ljungström]] (1875-1964). The patent was achieved in 1930.&lt;ref&gt;[https://patents.google.com/patent/US1746598 Patent USPTO No. 1746598, 11 February 1930]&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in a modern utility boiler provides up to 20 percent of the total heat transfer in the boiler process, but only represents 2 percent of the investment.&lt;ref name="ASME, preheater" &gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The factory and workshop activities and laboratories in Lidingö would remain throughout the 1920s, with some 70 personnel. In the 1930s it was used a film studio, and was finally demolished in the 1970s to give space for new industry premises.

With Fredrik Ljungström's technology of the air preheater implemented in a vast amount of modern [[power station]]s around the world until this day with total attributed worldwide [[fuel savings]] estimated to 4,960,000,000 [[ton]]s of [[oil]], "few inventions have been as successful in saving fuel as the Ljungström Air Preheater".

In 1995, the Ljungström air preheater was distinguished as the 44th [[International Historic Mechanical Engineering Landmark]] by the [[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.asme.org/getmedia/c7cf3d83-508f-4946-b476-9399c390fc83/185-Ljungstrom-Air-Preheater.aspx |title=The Ljungström Air Preheater 1920|date=June 21, 1995 |website=asme.org |publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Few large-scale working prototypes have been built, as marine MHD propulsion remains impractical due to its low [[efficiency]], limited by the low [[electrical conductivity]] of [[seawater]]. Increasing [[current density]] is limited by [[Joule heating]] and water [[electrolysis]] in the vicinity of [[electrode]]s, and increasing the magnetic field strength is limited by the cost, size and weight (as well as technological limitations) of [[electromagnet]]s and the power available to feed them.&lt;ref name="PLOS"&gt;{{cite journal

[[Plasma propulsion engine]]s using magnetohydrodynamics for [[space exploration]] have also been actively studied as such [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion#Electromagnetic|electromagnetic propulsion]] offers high [[thrust]] and high [[specific impulse]] at the same time, and the propellant would last much longer than [[Rocket engine|chemical rockets]].&lt;ref name="Choueiri 2009"&gt;{{cite magazine

== Principle ==
{{Main|Lorentz force}}
{{see also|Magnetohydrodynamic converter}}
[[File:Right hand rule cross product F=J×B.svg|thumb|Illustration of the right-hand rule for the Lorentz force, cross product of an electric current with a magnetic field.]]

The working principle involves the acceleration of an electrically conductive [[fluid]] (which can be a [[liquid]] or an [[Ionization|ionized]] [[gas]] called a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]) by the [[Lorentz force]], resulting from the [[cross product]] of an [[electric current]] (motion of [[charge carrier]]s accelerated by an [[electric field]] applied between two [[electrode]]s) with a [[perpendicular]] [[magnetic field]]. The Lorentz force accelerates all [[charged particles]] (positive and negative species) in the same direction whatever their sign, and the whole fluid is dragged through [[Elastic collision|collisions]]. As a [[Reaction (physics)|reaction]], the vehicle is put in motion in the opposite direction.

This is the same working principle as an [[electric motor]] (more exactly a [[linear motor]]) except that in an MHD drive, the solid moving [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] is replaced by the fluid acting directly as the [[propellant]]. As all [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] devices, an MHD accelerator is reversible: if the ambient [[working fluid]] is moving relatively to the magnetic field, [[Electric dipole moment|charge separation]] induces an [[voltage|electric potential difference]] that can be harnessed with [[electrode]]s: the device then acts as a [[Electric generator|power source]] with no moving part transforming the [[kinetic energy]] of the incoming fluid into [[electricity]], called an [[Magnetohydrodynamic generator|MHD generator]].

[[File:MHD converters (generator and accelerator).svg|thumb|512px|Crossed-field magnetohydrodynamic converters (linear Faraday type with segmented electrodes). A: MHD generator mode. B: MHD accelerator mode.|center]]

As the Lorentz force in an MHD converter does not act on a single isolated charged particle nor on electrons in a solid [[Electrical wiring|electrical wire]], but on a continuous [[Charge density|charge distribution]] in motion, it is a "volumetric" (body) force, a force per unit volume:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} = \rho \mathbf{E} + \mathbf{J} \times \mathbf{B}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where '''f''' is the ''force density'' (force per unit volume), ''ρ'' the [[charge density]] (charge per unit volume), '''E''' the [[electric field]], '''J''' the [[current density]] (current per unit area) and '''B''' the [[magnetic field]].

==Typology==

MHD thrusters are classified in two categories according to the way the electromagnetic fields operate:
* '''Conduction devices''' when a [[direct current]] flows in the fluid due to an applied voltage between pairs of electrodes, the magnetic field being steady.
* '''Induction devices''' when [[alternating current]]s are [[Electromagnetic induction|induced]] by a rapidly varying magnetic field, as [[eddy current]]s. No electrodes are required in this case.

As induction MHD accelerators are electrodeless, they do not exhibit the common issues related to conduction systems (especially Joule heating, bubbles and [[redox]] from electrolysis) but need much more intense peak magnetic fields to operate. Since one of the biggest issues with such thrusters is the limited energy available on-board, induction MHD drives have not been developed out of the laboratory.

Both systems can put the working fluid in motion according to two main designs:
* '''Internal flow''' when the fluid is accelerated within and propelled back out of a [[propelling nozzle|nozzle]] of tubular or ring-shaped [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]], the MHD interaction being concentrated within the pipe (similarly to [[Rocket engine|rocket]] or [[jet engine]]s).
* '''External flow''' when the fluid is accelerated around the whole [[wetted area]] of the vehicle, the electromagnetic fields extending around the body of the vehicle. The propulsion force results from the pressure distribution on the shell (as [[Lift (force)|lift]] on a [[wing]], or how [[ciliate]] [[microorganism]]s such as ''[[paramecium]]'' move water around them).

Internal flow systems concentrate the MHD interaction in a limited volume, preserving [[Stealth technology#Acoustics|stealth]] characteristics. External field systems on the contrary have the ability to act on a very large expanse of surrounding water volume with higher efficiency and the ability to decrease [[Drag (physics)|drag]], increasing the efficiency even further.&lt;ref name="Way 1968" /&gt;

===Marine propulsion===
[[File:Magnetohydrodynamic drive tube.jpg|thumb|A view through a tube in the thruster of ''Yamato I,'' at the Ship Science Museum in Tokyo. The electrode plates are visible top and bottom.]]
[[File:Magnetohydrodynamic drive.jpg|thumb|A view of the end of the thruster unit from ''Yamato I,'' at the Ship Science Museum in Tokyo.]]
MHD is attractive for underwater military applications because it has no moving parts, which means that a good design might be silent, [[Stealth technology#Acoustics|stealthy]], reliable, and efficient. Additionally, the MHD design eliminates many of the wear and friction pieces of the [[Powertrain|drivetrain]] with a directly driven [[propeller]] by an engine.
The major problem with MHD is that with current technologies, it is more expensive, and much slower, than a propeller driven by an engine.&lt;ref name="PLOS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TPT" /&gt;
The extra expense is from the large generator that must be driven by an engine. Such a large generator is not required when an engine directly drives a propeller.

The first prototype, a 3-meter (10-feet) long submarine called EMS-1, was designed and tested in 1966 by Stewart Way, a professor of mechanical engineering at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. Way, on leave from his job at [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]], assigned his senior year undergraduate students to build the operational unit. This MHD submarine operated on batteries delivering power to electrodes and electromagnets, which produced a magnetic field of 0.015 tesla. The cruise speed was about 0.4 meter per second (15 inches per second) during the test in the bay of [[Santa Barbara, California]], in accordance with theoretical predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Run Silent, Run Electromagnetic |date=1966-09-23 |journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,842848-1,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EMS-1 video"&gt;{{YouTube|id= RNMxlEfwdEc|title="EMS-1 electromagnetic submarine on US television (1966)"}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Way 1967b" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Way 1968" /&gt;

Later, a Japanese prototype, the 3.6-meter long "ST-500", achieved speeds of up to 0.6&amp;nbsp;m/s in 1979.&lt;ref name="ICEC"&gt;A. Iwata, Y. Saji and S.

Rizzuto (IPC Science and Technology, 1980), pp. 775–784.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the world's first full-size prototype ''[[Yamato 1]]'' was completed in [[Japan]] after 6 years of [[Research and development|R&amp;D]] by the [[Ship &amp; Ocean Foundation]] (later known as the [[Ocean Policy Research Foundation]]). The ship successfully carried a crew of ten plus passengers at speeds of up to 15&amp;nbsp;km/h in [[Kobe]] Harbour in June 1992.&lt;ref name="PopSci 1992" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BMESJ"&gt;{{cite journal

Small-scale ship models were later built and studied extensively in the laboratory, leading to successful comparisons between the measurements and the theoretical prediction of ship terminal speeds.&lt;ref name="PLOS" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TPT" /&gt;

===Aircraft propulsion===
{{see also|Flow control (fluid)}}

====Passive flow control====
First studies of the interaction of plasmas with [[Hypersonic speed|hypersonic flows]] around vehicles date back to the late 1950s, with the concept of a new kind of [[Atmospheric entry#Thermal protection systems|thermal protection system]] for [[space capsule]]s during high-speed [[Atmospheric entry|reentry]]. As low-pressure air is naturally ionized at such very high velocities and altitude, it was thought to use the effect of a magnetic field produced by an electromagnet to replace [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|thermal ablative shields]] by a "magnetic shield". Hypersonic ionized flow interacts with the magnetic field, inducing eddy currents in the plasma. The current combines with the magnetic field to give Lorentz forces that oppose the flow and detach the [[Bow shock (aerodynamics)|bow shock wave]] further ahead of the vehicle, lowering the [[heat flux]] which is due to the brutal recompression of air behind the [[stagnation point]]. Such passive [[Flow control (fluid)|flow control]] studies are still ongoing, but a large-scale demonstrator has yet to be built.&lt;ref name="NASA reentry"&gt;{{cite report

====Active flow control====
Active flow control by MHD force fields on the contrary involves a direct and imperious action of forces to locally accelerate or slow down the [[airflow]], modifying its velocity, direction, pressure, friction, heat flux parameters, in order to preserve materials and engines from stress, allowing [[hypersonic flight]]. It is a field of magnetohydrodynamics also called '''magnetogasdynamics''', '''magnetoaerodynamics''' or '''magnetoplasma aerodynamics''', as the working fluid is the air (a gas instead of a liquid) ionized to become electrically conductive (a plasma).

Air ionization is achieved at high altitude (electrical conductivity of air increases as atmospheric pressure reduces according to [[Paschen's law]]) using various techniques: [[high voltage]] [[Electric arc|electric arc discharge]], [[Radio frequency|RF]] ([[microwave]]s) electromagnetic [[glow discharge]], [[laser]], [[Cathode ray|e-beam]] or [[betatron]], [[radioactive source]]… with or without seeding of low [[ionization energy|ionization potential]] [[alkali]] substances (like [[caesium]]) into the flow.&lt;ref name="Froning 1999"&gt;{{cite conference

MHD studies applied to [[aeronautics]] try to extend the domain of hypersonic [[Fixed-wing aircraft|planes]] to higher Mach regimes: 
* Action on the boundary layer to prevent laminar flow to become turbulent.
* Shock wave mitigation for thermal control and reduction of the wave drag and form drag. Some theoretical studies suggest the flow velocity could be controlled everywhere on the wetted area of an aircraft, so shock waves could be totally cancelled when using enough power.&lt;ref name="Petit 1983"&gt;{{cite conference

==== Prospects ====
MHD propulsion has been considered as the main propulsion system for both marine and space ships since there is no need to produce lift to counter the [[gravity of Earth]] in water (due to [[buoyancy]]) nor in space (due to [[weightlessness]]), which is ruled out in the case of [[flight]] in the [[atmosphere]].

Nonetheless, considering the current problem of the [[Electric power|electric power source]] solved (for example with the availability of a still missing multi-megawatt compact [[Fusion power|fusion reactor]]), one could imagine future aircraft of a new kind silently powered by MHD accelerators, able to ionize and direct enough air downward to lift several [[tonne]]s. As external flow systems can control the flow over the whole wetted area, limiting thermal issues at high speeds, ambient air would be ionized and radially accelerated by Lorentz forces around an [[Rotational symmetry#Rotational symmetry with respect to any angle|axisymmetric]] body (shaped as a [[cylinder]], a [[cone]], a [[sphere]]…), the entire [[airframe]] being the engine. Lift and thrust would arise as a consequence of a [[pressure]] difference between the upper and lower surfaces, induced by the [[Coandă effect]].&lt;ref name='"Coanda patent"&gt;{{ref patent

Having no [[wing]]s nor [[airbreathing jet engine]]s, it would share no similarities with conventional aircraft, but it would behave like a [[helicopter]] whose [[Helicopter rotor|rotor blades]] would have been replaced by a "purely electromagnetic rotor" with no moving part, sucking the air downward.

===Spacecraft propulsion===

{{main|Plasma propulsion engine}}
{{See also|Magnetoplasmadynamic thruster|Pulsed inductive thruster}}
A number of experimental methods of [[spacecraft propulsion]] are based on magnetohydrodynamics. As this kind of MHD propulsion involves compressible fluids in the form of plasmas (ionized gases) it is also referred to as '''magnetogasdynamics''' or '''magnetoplasmadynamics'''.

In such [[Electrically powered spacecraft propulsion#Electromagnetic|electromagnetic thrusters]], the working fluid is most of the time ionized [[hydrazine]], [[xenon]] or [[lithium]]. Depending on the propellant used, it can be seeded with [[alkali]] such as [[potassium]] or [[caesium]] to improve its electrical conductivity. All charged species within the plasma, from positive and negative ions to free electrons, as well as neutral atoms by the effect of collisions, are accelerated in the same direction by the Lorentz "body" force, which results from the combination of a magnetic field with an orthogonal electric field (hence the name of "cross-field accelerator"), these fields not being in the direction of the acceleration. This is a fundamental difference with [[ion thruster]]s which rely on [[electrostatics]] to accelerate only positive ions using the [[Coulomb force]] along a [[high voltage]] electric field.

First experimental studies involving cross-field plasma accelerators (square channels and rocket nozzles) date back to the late 1950s. Such systems provide greater [[thrust]] and higher [[specific impulse]] than conventional [[Rocket engine#Terminology|chemical rockets]] and even modern ion drives, at the cost of a higher required energy density.&lt;ref name="Resler 1958"&gt;{{cite journal

Some devices also studied nowadays besides cross-field accelerators include the [[magnetoplasmadynamic thruster]] sometimes referred to as the ''Lorentz Force Accelerator'' (LFA), and the electrodeless [[Pulsed inductive thruster]] (PIT).

Even today, these systems are not ready to be launched in space as they still lack a suitable compact power source offering enough [[energy density]] (such as hypothetical [[Fusion power|fusion reactors]]) to feed the power-greedy [[electromagnet]]s, especially pulsed inductive ones. The rapid ablation of electrodes under the intense thermal flow is also a concern. For these reasons, studies remain largely theoretical and experiments are still conducted in the laboratory, although over 60 years have passed since the first research in this kind of thrusters.

== Fiction ==
''Oregon,'' a ship in [[the Oregon Files]] series of books by author [[Clive Cussler]], has a magnetohydrodynamic drive. This allows the ship to turn very sharply and brake instantly, instead of gliding for a few miles. In ''[[Valhalla Rising (novel)|Valhalla Rising]],'' [[Clive Cussler]] writes the same drive into the powering of [[Captain Nemo]]'s ''[[Nautilus (Verne)|Nautilus]].''

The film adaptation of ''[[The Hunt for Red October (film)|The Hunt for Red October]]'' popularized the magnetohydrodynamic drive as a "caterpillar drive" for [[submarine]]s, a nearly undetectable "silent drive" intended to achieve [[Stealth technology#Acoustics|stealth]] in [[submarine warfare]]. In reality, the current traveling through the water would create gases and noise, and the magnetic fields would induce a detectable magnetic signature. In [[The Hunt for Red October|the novel]] from which the film was adapted, the caterpillar that ''Red October'' used was actually a [[Pump-jet|pumpjet]] of the so-called "tunnel drive" type (the tunnels provided acoustic camouflage for the cavitation from the propellers).

In the [[Ben Bova]] novel, ''[[The Precipice (Bova novel)|The Precipice]],'' the ship where some of the action took place, ''Starpower 1,'' built to prove that exploration and mining of the [[Asteroid Belt]] was feasible and potentially profitable, had a magnetohydrodynamic drive mated to a [[fusion power|fusion]] power plant.

The College was [[charter]]ed on January 1, 2006 under a reorganization.  The College includes two schools: the Mewbourne School of Petroleum and Geological Engineering and the [[ConocoPhillips]] School of Geology and Geophysics, and the [[Oklahoma Geological Survey]] (a state agency mandated by the [[Oklahoma Constitution]]).

The main offices for the College are located in [[Sarkeys Energy Center]] on the northeast corner of campus.

On November 2, 2007, it was announced that the College would be renamed the Mewbourne College of Earth and Energy in order to honor Curtis Mewbourne, a resident of [[Tyler, Texas]], a 1958 OU graduate in petroleum engineering and one of the college's most prolific donors (he is the namesake for the School of Petroleum and Geological Engineering).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cee.ou.edu/mewbourne_press_release.html | title=Mewbourne Press Release | accessdate=2007-11-15 | publisher=University of Oklahoma}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, he had endowed the Curtis Mewbourne Professorship in Petroleum Engineering. Then he made a $6 million gift in 2000 to the School of Petroleum and Geological Engineering. OU renamed the college in recognition of Melbourne's support. In November 2000, he challenged other alumni and supporters of the college to endow undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships for students in petroleum engineering, geological engineering, geology and geophysics. He said he would match the gifts made between then and March 2008.&lt;ref name= "NormanTranscript"&gt;[http://www.normantranscript.com/news/local_news/ou-s-college-of-earth-and-energy-renamed-after-alumnus/article_5dd2f3da-34bc-5d9a-b9e9-9a27a238693e.html Parker, Juliana.

'''Microwave burns''' are [[burn]] [[injury|injuries]] caused by thermal effects of [[microwave]] [[electromagnetic radiation|radiation]] absorbed in a living [[organism]].  In comparison with [[radiation burn]]s caused by [[ionizing radiation]], where the dominant mechanism of tissue damage is internal cell damage caused by [[free radical]]s, the primary damage mechanism of microwave radiation is by [[dielectric heating|heat]].

Microwave damage can manifest with a delay; pain or signs of skin damage can show some time after microwave exposure.&lt;ref name="childinj"/&gt;

==Frequency vs depth==
The depth of penetration depends on the frequency of the microwaves and the tissue type. The [[Active Denial System]] ("pain ray") is a [[less-lethal]] [[directed energy weapon]] that employs a microwave beam at 95&amp;nbsp;GHz; a two-second burst of the 95&amp;nbsp;GHz focused beam heats the skin to a temperature of 130&amp;nbsp;°F (54&amp;nbsp;°C) at a depth of 1/64th of an inch (0.4&amp;nbsp;mm) and is claimed to cause skin pain without lasting damage. Conversely, lower frequencies penetrate deeper; at 5.8&amp;nbsp;GHz&amp;nbsp;(3.2 &amp;nbsp;mm) the depth most of the energy is dissipated in the first millimeter of the skin; the 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency microwaves commonly used in [[microwave oven]]s can deliver energy deeper into the tissue; the generally accepted value is 17&amp;nbsp;mm for muscle tissue.&lt;ref name="mwrfprodapp"&gt;{{cite book|title=Microwave and RF Product Applications|author=Golio, M.|date=2003|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780203503744|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1yu3mqPdpBwC|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As lower frequencies penetrate deeper into the tissue, and as there are fewer nerve endings in deeper-located parts of the body, the effects of the radio frequency waves (and the damage caused) may not be immediately noticeable. The lower frequencies at high power densities present a significant risk.

The microwave absorption is directed by the [[dielectric constant]] of the tissue. At 2.5&amp;nbsp;GHz, this ranges from about 5 for [[adipose tissue]] to about 56 for the [[cardiac muscle]]. As the speed of electromagnetic waves is proportional to the reciprocal of the square root of the dielectric constant, the resulting wavelength in the tissue can drop to a fraction of the wavelength in air; e.g. at 10&amp;nbsp;GHz the wavelength can drop from 3&amp;nbsp;cm to about 3.4&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name="noninvimg"&gt;{{cite book|title=Noninvasive Instrumentation and Measurement in Medical Diagnosis|author=Northrop, R.B.|date=2014|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420041200|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-TT1zoHfep8C|page=484|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The layers of the body can be approximated as a thin layer of epidermis, dermis, adipose tissue (subcutaneous fat), and muscle tissue. At dozens of gigahertz, the radiation is absorbed in the top fraction to top few millimeters of skin. Muscle tissue is a much more efficient absorber than fat, so at lower frequencies that can penetrate sufficiently deep, most energy gets deposited there. In a homogeneous medium, the energy/depth dependence is an exponential curve with the exponent depending on the frequency and tissue. For 2.5&amp;nbsp;GHz, the first millimeter of muscle tissue absorbs 11% of the heat energy, the first two millimeters together absorb 20%. For lower frequencies, the attenuation factors are much lower, the achievable heating depths are higher, and the temperature gradient within the tissue is lower.&lt;ref name="mwrfprodapp"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rfmwsafe"/&gt;

==Tissue damage==
The tissue damage depends primarily on the absorbed energy and the tissue sensitivity; it is a function of the microwave [[power density]] (which depends on the distance from the source and its power output), frequency, absorption rate in the given tissue, and the tissue sensitivity. Tissues with high water (resp. electrolyte) content show higher microwave absorption.

The degree of the tissue damage depends on both the achieved temperature and the length of exposure. For short times, higher temperatures can be tolerated.

The damage can be spread over a large area, when the source is a relatively distant energy radiator, or a very small (though possibly deep) area, when the body comes to a direct contact with the source (e.g. a wire or a connector pin).&lt;ref name="radartech"&gt;{{cite book|title=Radar for Technicians: Installation, Maintenance, and Repair|author=Gould, F.L.|date=1995|publisher=TAB Books|isbn=9780070240629|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=EzZyJN54CekC|page=221|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] has high electrical resistance for lower frequencies; at higher frequencies, the energy penetrates through by [[capacitive coupling]]. Damage to epidermis has low extent unless the epidermis is very moist. The characteristic depth for lower-frequency microwave injury is about 1&amp;nbsp;cm. The heating rate of adipose tissue is much slower than of muscle tissue. Frequencies in [[millimeter wave]] range are absorbed in the topmost layer of skin, rich in thermal sensors. At lower frequencies, between 1–10&amp;nbsp;GHz, most of the energy is however absorbed in deeper layers; the threshold for cellular injury there lies at 42&amp;nbsp;°C while the pain threshold is at 45&amp;nbsp;°C, so a subjective perception may not be a reliable indicator of a harmful level of exposure at those frequencies.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Biological and Medical Aspects of Electromagnetic Fields|author1=Barnes, F.S.|author2=Greenebaum, B.|date=2006|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781420009460|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=80GjHM2UVIoC|page=342|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skin===
Exposure to frequencies common in domestic and industrial sources rarely leads to significant skin damage; in such cases, the damage tends to be limited to [[upper limb]]s. Significant injury with [[erythema]], [[blister]]s, [[pain]], [[nerve]] damage and tissue [[necrosis]] can occur even with exposures as short as 2–3 seconds. Due to the deep penetration of these frequencies, the skin may be minimally affected and show no signs of damage, while [[muscle]]s, nerves, and [[blood vessel]]s may be significantly damaged. [[Sensory nerve]]s are particularly sensitive to such damage; cases of persistent [[neuritis]] and [[compression neuropathy]] were reported after significant microwave exposures.&lt;ref name="goo1"/&gt;

===Muscle and fat tissue===
Microwave burns show some similarities with [[electrical burn]]s, as the tissue damage is deep rather than superficial. Adipose tissue shows less degree of damage than muscles and other water-rich tissues. (In contrast, radiant heat, contact burns and chemical burns damage subcutaneous adipose tissue to higher extent than deeper muscle tissue.) Full-thickness [[biopsy]] of the area between burned and unburned skin shows layers of more and less damaged tissue ("tissue sparing"), layers of undamaged fat between damaged muscles; a pattern that is not present in conventional thermal or chemical burns. Cells subjected to electrical burns show microscopic nuclear streaming on [[histology]] examination; this feature is not present with microwave burns. Microwaves also deposit more energy to areas with low blood supply and to [[biointerface|tissue interface]]s.&lt;ref name="childinj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="elecinj"&gt;{{cite book|title=Electrical Injuries: Engineering, Medical, and Legal Aspects|author1=Nabours, R.E.|author2=Fish, R.M.|author3=Hill, P.F.|date=2004|publisher=Lawyers &amp; Judges Publishing Company|isbn=9781930056718|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yh6yqrhWzOMC|page=134|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hot spots may be formed in the tissue, with a consequent higher absorption of microwave energy and even higher temperature achieved, with localized [[necrosis]] of the affected tissue following.&lt;ref name="rfelf"/&gt; Sometimes, the affected tissue can even be [[charring|charred]].&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Understanding the Medical Diagnosis of Child Maltreatment: A Guide for Nonmedical Professionals|author=Brittain, C.|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=9780195172171|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UmQATCaVbxwC|page=47|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Muscle tissue destruction can lead to [[myoglobinuria]], with [[renal failure]] following in severe cases; this is similar to burns from electric current. [[Urinalysis]] and serum [[Creatine phosphokinase|CPK]], [[Blood urea nitrogen|BUN]] and [[creatine]] tests are used to check for this condition.&lt;ref name="goo2"/&gt;

===Eyes===
{{Disputed section|date=September 2013}}
Cases of severe [[conjunctivitis]] were reported after technicians looked into powered [[waveguide]]s.&lt;ref name="rfmwsafe"/&gt;

Microwave-induced [[cataract]]s have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/resourcesforyouradiationemittingproducts/ucm252762.htm#Microwave_Ovens_and_Health "Microwave Ovens and Health"] U.S. Food and Drug Administration&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments on [[rabbit]]s and dogs, mostly in the [[UHF]] range of frequencies, shown that the ocular effects are confined to [[eyelid]]s and [[conjuctiva]] (as e.g. [[anterior]] segment [[keratitis]] or [[iritis]]).&lt;ref name="goo1"&gt;{{cite book|title=Clinical Environmental Health and Toxic Exposures|author1=Sullivan, J.B.|author2=Krieger, G.R.|date=2001|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9780683080278|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PyUSgdZUGr4C|page=205|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cataracts were observed at several workers exposed to radiofrequency radiation, but in some of the cases the cause was unrelated to the RF exposure and in the other cases the evidence was incomplete or inconclusive.&lt;ref name="rfelf"/&gt; Some sources however mention incidence of microwave-related injuries of ocular lens and retina&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=4-VhcCu_Aq0C&amp;pg=PA203&amp;dq=microwave+injury&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=17#v=onepage&amp;q=microwave%20injury&amp;f=false Fitness For Work: The Medical Aspects – Google Boeken&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the possibility of thermal effects to cause cataracts or focal tissue burns (incl. [[keratitis]]).&lt;ref name="prevoccup"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pM7DNkbVyQgC&amp;pg=PA428&amp;dq=microwave+injury&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=26#v=onepage&amp;q=microwave%20injury&amp;f=false Preventing Occupational Disease and Injury – Google Boeken&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[near and far field|near field]] 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz frequency, the minimum power density to cause cataracts in rabbits was found to be 150&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 100 minutes; a retrolental temperature of 41&amp;nbsp;°C was necessary to be achieved. When the eye temperature was kept low by external cooling, cataracts were not produced by higher field intensities; that supports the hypothesis of a thermal mechanism being involved.&lt;ref name="advelmgliv"&gt;{{cite book|title=Advances in Electromagnetic Fields in Living Systems|author=Lin, J.C.|date=1997|volume=2|publisher=Springer|isbn=9780306455087|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QbSvENfgdo0C|page=155|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nerves===
[[Sensory nerve]]s are particularly sensitive to microwave damage. Cases of persistent [[neuritis]] and [[compression neuropathy]] were reported after significant microwave exposures.&lt;ref name="goo1"/&gt;

When the temperature of the brain is raised to or above 42&amp;nbsp;°C, the [[blood–brain barrier]] permeability increases.&lt;ref name="advelmgliv"/&gt;

A [[neuropathy]] due to peripheral nerve [[lesion]], without visible external burns, can occur when the nerve is subjected to microwaves of sufficient power density. The damage mechanism is believed to be thermal. Radiofrequency waves and ultrasound can be used for temporary blocking of peripheral nerves during neurosurgical operations.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Neuropathies|author1=Vinken, P.J.|author2=Bruyn, G.W.|author3=Matthews, W.B.|author4=Klawans, H.L.|date=1987|issue=v. 51; v. 236|publisher=Elsevier Science Publishers|isbn=9780444904782|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=AVX4lipElScC|page=140|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other tissues===
The thermal effects of microwaves can cause [[testicular]] degeneration and lower [[sperm count]].&lt;ref name="prevoccup"/&gt;

Pulmonary burn can be present when lungs are exposed; chest x-ray is used for diagnosing.&lt;ref name="goo2"/&gt;

Exposure of abdomen may lead to [[bowel obstruction]] due to [[stenosis]] of the affected bowel; flat and upright abdominal x-ray is used to check for this condition.&lt;ref name="goo2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Medical and Bioengineering Aspects of Electrical Injuries|author1=Fish, R.M.|author2=Geddes, L.A.|author3=Babbs, C.F.|date=2003|publisher=Lawyers &amp; Judges Publishing Company|isbn=9781930056084|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=luNUiqJHdDwC|page=370|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Injury cases==
Household microwave ovens have shielding around the inside of the oven that prevents microwaves from leaking out, as well as safety [[Interlock (engineering)|interlocks]] that prevent the oven from operating when the door is open. Therefore, burns due to direct exposure to microwave energy (as opposed to touching hot food) should not occur under normal circumstances.

===Infants and microwave ovens===
There are several cases of [[child abuse]] where an [[infant]] or child has been placed in a microwave oven. The typical feature of such injuries are well-defined burns on the skin nearest to the microwave emitter, and [[histology]] examination shows higher damage extent in tissues with high content of water (e.g. [[muscle]]s) than in tissues with less water (e.g. [[adipose tissue]]).&lt;ref name="google4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sudden Death in Infancy, Childhood, and Adolescence|author=Byard, R.W.|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521825825|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=8UbhVGqVrbAC|page=112|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One such case involved a teenage babysitter who admitted to having placed a child in the microwave oven for approximately sixty seconds. The child developed a [[third degree burn]] to the back, measuring 5 inches x 6 inches. The babysitter later took the child to the emergency department, where multiple [[skin graft]]s were placed on the back. There were no signs of lasting emotional, cognitive or physical effects. [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] of the head was normal, and there were no [[cataract]]s.&lt;ref name="childinj"/&gt;

Another case involved a five-week-old female infant that had multiple full-thickness burns totaling 11% of the body surface area. The mother claimed the infant had been near a microwave oven, but not inside it. The infant survived but required amputations of parts of one leg and one hand.&lt;ref name="childinj"/&gt;

Also, there have been three alleged [[infant]] deaths caused by [[microwave oven]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6161143.stm | title='Microwave baby' mother charged | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=2006-12-08 | accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6193964.stm | title=US baby 'murdered in microwave' | publisher=[[BBC News]] | date=2006-11-28 | accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/drugs/babysitter.asp | title=Wasted and Basted | publisher=[[Snopes]] | accessdate=2007-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all these cases, the babies were placed within microwaves and died of subsequent injuries.

===Adults and microwave ovens===
A case of nerve damage by an exposure to radiation from a malfunctioning 600 watt microwave oven, operated for five seconds with the door open, with both arms and hands exposed, was reported. During exposure, there was a pulsating, burning sensation in all fingers. [[Erythema]] appeared on the back sides of both hands and arms. Four years later, denervation of [[median nerve]], [[ulnar nerve]], and [[radial nerve]] in both arms was shown on an [[electromyography]] test.&lt;ref name="childinj"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pHXdUbiRiA8C&amp;pg=PA87&amp;dq=microwave+injury&amp;lr=&amp;num=50&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=microwave%20injury&amp;f=false Page 87-89 in]: Children and Injuries.

Frost. {{ISBN|0-913875-96-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-913875-96-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="handbelechaz"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Electrical Hazards and Accidents|author1=Geddes, L.A.|author2=Roeder, R.A.|date=2006|publisher=Lawyers &amp; Judges Publishing Company|isbn=9780913875445|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Pb4lUnSsMa0C|page=370|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- todo: more examples from here, rewrite this section on its basis --&gt;

The first microwave oven injury was reported in 1973. Two women operated a microwave oven in a department store snack bar. After several years, the oven showed a malfunction manifesting by burning the food. The first woman noticed burning sensations in her fingers and very little pain or tenderness when nearby to the operating oven. A small lesion appeared on her left index finger, near the base of the fingernail. In the next four weeks, three fingers of her right hand became affected as well. Transverse ridging and deformations close to the nail base appeared on her fingernails. After five months since the initial symptoms, she visited a doctor; the examination found no abnormalities other than the nails. Topical steroid cream used over six weeks led to gradual improvement. The second woman experienced nail deformation at the same time as the first one, with the same clinical findings. The oven was returned to the manufacturer before the involvement of the doctor, and the amount of leakage could not be assessed.&lt;ref name="handbelechaz"/&gt;

On July 29, 1977, H.F., a 51-year-old teacher, was attempting to remove a [[casserole]] dish from her new 600-watt microwave oven. The oven signaled the end of the heating cycle, but the light and the cooking blower were on. During retrieval of the dish, she inserted two thirds of her bare forearms into the oven, for a total time of about five seconds. The oven was still operating. She felt "hot pulsating sensation" and burning in fingers and fingernails and a sensation of "[[Paresthesia|needles]]" over the exposed areas. Jabbing pain, swelling, and red-orange discoloration of dorsal sides of both hands and forearms appeared shortly afterwards. The next day she sought medical help. Since then, she has undergone treatment with oral and topical [[cortisone]], [[Grenz rays]], ultrasound, and later acupuncture, without relief. Symptoms persisted, including high sensitivity to radiant heat (sun, desk lamp, etc.) and growing intolerance to pressure of clothes and to touch in hands and forearms. Neurological examinations in 1980 and 1981 did not yield a definite diagnosis. Neuronal latencies were within norm. Electromyography discovered denervation in the [[median nerve]], [[ulnar nerve]], and [[radial nerve]] on both arms. Severe reduction of number of [[sweat gland]]s in the finger pulps, in comparison with a random control, was also found. The injury was determined to be caused by the full power of the magnetron; the pulsating sensation was caused either by the stirrer (a mechanical mirror distributing the microwave beam across the oven space to prevent formation of hot and cold spots), or by the arterial pulsation in combination with increased nerve sensitivity. Damage to the [[A beta fiber]]s, [[A delta fiber]]s, and [[group C nerve fiber]]s was the cause of the burning sensation. The increased hypersensitivity to radiant heat is caused by the damage to the A beta, A delta, and polymodal [[nociceptor]]s (the group C fibers); this damage is induced by a single-time overheating of the skin to 48.5–50&amp;nbsp;°C, and the resulting sensitivity persists for a long time. Degeneration of the [[alpha motor neuron]]s is also caused by the exposure to heat and radiation. Most of the major nerve trunks were not affected. Damage to the A beta fibers (located in the skin), discovered by the [[two-point discrimination]] test, is permanent; the [[Pacinian corpuscle]]s, [[Meissner corpuscle]]s, and [[Merkel nerve ending]]s, which degenerated after denervation, do not regenerate. The [[sympathetic nervous system]] was involved as well; the reduction in active sweat glands was caused by destruction of their innervation, the initial edema and reddening was also caused by sympathetic nerve damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1911632 | pmid=6573221 | volume=59 | issue=3 | title=Microwave oven burn |date=April 1983 | author=Fleck H | journal=Bull N Y Acad Med | pages=313–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, a 35-year-old male was heating a sandwich in a microwave oven at work. After opening the door, the magnetron did not shut off and his right hand was exposed to microwave radiation as he retrieved the sandwich. After exposure, his hand was pale and cold; 30 minutes later the man presented himself to a doctor, with [[paresthesia]] in all fingers and the hand still pale and cold. An [[Allen's test]] showed a return to normal color after 60 seconds (normal is 5 seconds). By 60 minutes after exposure the hand was normal again, and the patient was discharged without treatment. A week later there was no paresthesia, motor weakness nor sensory deficit.&lt;ref name="handbelechaz"/&gt;

===Other===
An engineer replaced a [[woodpecker]]-damaged [[feed horn]] of a high-power microwave antenna, a 15-meter dish at an [[Earth station]] of a television network, using a [[cherry picker]]. After finishing, he sent his technician to power up the transmitter, and attempted to lower the cherry picker down. The engine failed and the engineer was stuck next to the antenna, outside of its [[main lobe]] but well within the first [[sidelobe]]. The technician, unaware that the engineer was still close to the antenna, powered it up. The engineer was exposed to an intense microwave field for about three minutes, until the error was realized. There were no immediate symptoms; the next morning the engineer detected blood and solid matter in his urine, and visited a doctor, who found [[blood in stool]] and massive [[bowel]] [[adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]]. The engineer's medical problems lasted for many years.&lt;ref name="micrwircomtech"&gt;{{cite book|title=Microwave &amp; Wireless Communications Technology|author=Carr, J.J.|date=1997|publisher=Newnes|isbn=9780750697071|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1j1E541LKVoC|page=9|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==
[[Dielectric heating]] ([[diathermy]]) is used in medicine; the frequencies used typically lie in the ultrasonic, [[shortwave]], and microwave ranges. Careless application, especially when the patient has implanted metal conductors (e.g. cardiostimulator leads), can cause burns of skin and deeper tissues and even death.&lt;ref name="safhealeng"&gt;{{cite book|title=Safety and Health for Engineers|author=Brauer, R.L.|date=2006|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780471750925|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yRjz5wJWZecC|page=385|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microwave damage to tissues can be intentionally exploited as a therapeutic technique, e.g. [[radiofrequency ablation]] and [[radiofrequency lesioning]]. Controlled destruction of tissue is performed for treatment of [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]].&lt;ref name="google5"&gt;{{cite book|title=New Arrhythmia Technologies|author1=Wang, P.|author2=Naccarelli, G.V.|author3=Rosen, M.R.|author4=Estes, N.A.M.|author5=Hayes, D.L.|author6=Haines, D.E.|date=2005|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9781405132930|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=5_PARmDv1lUC|page=238|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microwave coagulation can be used for some kinds of surgeries, e.g., stopping bleeding after a severe [[liver]] injury.&lt;ref name="tripdatabase"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tripdatabase.com/doc/866854-Surgical-treatment-of-liver-injury-with-microwave-tissue-coagulation--an-experimental-study- |title=Surgical treatment of liver injury with microwave tissue coagulation: an experimental study|publisher=tripdatabase.com|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microwave heating seems to cause more damage to bacteria than equivalent thermal-only heating.&lt;ref name="google6"&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Microwave Technology for Food Application|author=Datta, A.K.|date=2001|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780824704902|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UsEeh5ydgXsC|page=195|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However food reheated in a microwave oven typically reaches lower temperature than classically reheated, therefore pathogens are more likely to survive.

Microwave heating of blood, e.g. for [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]], is contraindicated, as it can cause [[hemolysis]] and [[hyperkalemia]].&lt;ref name="elecinj"/&gt;

Microwave heating is one of the methods for inducing [[hyperthermia]] for [[hyperthermia therapy]].

High-energy microwaves are used in [[neurobiology]] experiments to [[Euthanasia|kill]] small [[laboratory animal]]s ([[mouse|mice]], [[rat]]s) in order to fix brain [[metabolite]]s without the loss of [[anatomy|anatomical]] integrity of the tissue. The instruments used are designed to focus most of the power to the animal's head. The unconsciousness and death is nearly instant, occurring in less than one second, and the method is the most efficient one to fix brain tissue chemical activity. A 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz, 6.5&amp;nbsp;kW source will heat the brain of a 30&amp;nbsp;g mouse to 90&amp;nbsp;°C in about 325 milliseconds; a 915&amp;nbsp;MHz, 25&amp;nbsp;kW source will heat the brain of a 300&amp;nbsp;g rat to the same temperature in a second. Special devices designed or modified for this purpose have to be used; use of kitchen-grade microwave ovens is condemned.&lt;ref name="google7"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Experimental Animal in Biomedical Research: A Survey of Scientific and Ethical Issues for Investigators|author=Rollin, B.E.|date=1990|volume=1|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780849349812|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yuElam1c36wC|page=429|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perception thresholds==
Safety limits exist for microwave exposure. The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] defines [[energy density]] limit for exposure periods of 0.1 hours or more to 10&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; for shorter periods the limit is 1&amp;nbsp;mW-hr/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with limited excursions above 10&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;!-- odd numbers. --&gt; The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) standard for microwave oven leakage puts limit to 5&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 2 inches from the oven's surface.&lt;ref name="safhealeng"/&gt;

For 5.8&amp;nbsp;GHz, exposure to 30&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; causes increase of facial skin temperature by 0.48&amp;nbsp;°C, [[cornea]]l surface heats by 0.7&amp;nbsp;°C, and the temperature of [[retina]] is estimated to increase by 0.08–0.03&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="rfelf"/&gt;

Exposure of skin to microwaves can be perceived as a sensation of heat or pain. Due to lower penetration of higher frequencies, perception threshold is lower for higher frequencies as more energy is dissipated closer to the body surface. When the entire face is exposed to 10&amp;nbsp;GHz microwaves, the feeling of heat is evoked at energy densities of 4–6&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 5 or more seconds, or about 10&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for a half second. Experiments on six volunteers exposed to 2.45&amp;nbsp;GHz microwaves shown perception thresholds on forearm skin to be at the average of 25–29&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, ranging from 15.40 to 44.25&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The sensation was indistinguishable from heat delivered by infrared radiation, though the infrared radiation required about five times lower energy density. Pain threshold for 3&amp;nbsp;GHz was demonstrated to range from 0.83–3.1&amp;nbsp;W/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 9.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of exposed area, depending on length of the exposure; other source says the dependence is not directly on the power density and exposure length, but primarily on the critical skin temperature.&lt;ref name="rfelf"&gt;{{cite book|title=Radio-Frequency and ELF Electromagnetic Energies: A Handbook for Health Professionals|author1=Hitchcock, R.T.|author2=Patterson, R.M.|date=1995|publisher=Wiley|isbn=9780471284543|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=lOMWHnZ4h_cC|page=208|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microwave energy can be focused by metal objects in the vicinity of the body or when [[Implant (medicine)|implant]]ed. Such focusing and resultant increased heating can significantly lower the perception, pain and damage thresholds. Metal-framed [[glasses]] perturb microwave fields between 2–12&amp;nbsp;GHz; individual components were found to be resonant between 1.4 and 3.75&amp;nbsp;GHz.&lt;ref name="rfelf"/&gt;

A security guard with a metal plate in his leg experienced heating of the plate when patrolling near [[tropospheric scatter]] transmitter antennas; he had to be removed from their vicinity.

In the 30–300&amp;nbsp;GHz band, dry clothing may serve as an [[quarter wave impedance transformer|impedance transformer]], facilitating more efficient energy coupling to the underlying skin.&lt;ref name="rfmwsafe"&gt;{{cite book|title=RF and Microwave Radiation Safety Handbook|author=Kitchen, R.|date=2001|publisher=Newnes|isbn=9780750643559|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=u3XBfkaTQcwC|page=60|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- todo: more from here --&gt;

Pulsed microwave radiation can be perceived by some workers as a phenomenon called "[[microwave hearing]]"; the irradiated personnel perceive auditory sensations of clicking or buzzing. The cause is thought to be thermoelastic expansion of portions of auditory apparatus.&lt;ref name="prevoccup"/&gt; The auditory system response occurs at least from 200&amp;nbsp;MHz to at least 3&amp;nbsp;GHz. In the tests, repetition rate of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz was used, with pulse width between 10–70 microseconds. The perceived loudness was found to be linked to the peak power density instead of average power density. At 1.245&amp;nbsp;GHz, the peak power density for perception was below 80&amp;nbsp;mW/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The generally accepted mechanism is rapid (but minuscule, in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; °C) heating of brain by each pulse, and the resulting pressure wave traveling through skull to [[cochlea]].&lt;ref name="rfmwsafe"/&gt;

==Other concerns==
Some [[vacuum tube]]s present in microwave installations tend to generate [[bremsstrahlung]] [[x-ray]]s. [[Magnetron]]s and especially hydrogen [[thyratron]]s tend to be the worst offenders.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.colloquium.fr/06IRPA/CDROM/docs/P-364.pdfw{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Low-level exposure==
As the energy of radio frequency waves and microwaves is insufficient to directly disrupt individual chemical bonds in small or stable molecules, the effects are considered limited to thermal. Energy densities that are not sufficient to overheat the tissues are not shown to cause lasting damage{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}. To clarify, the deep-red lightbulb in a black-and-white photographic [[darkroom]] produces a higher-energy form of radiation than microwaves. Like a microwave, this lightbulb can burn, particularly if touched, but the burn is only possible due to too much heat. A study of 20,000 [[radar]] technicians of the [[US Navy]], who were chronically exposed to high levels of microwave radiation, did not detect increased incidence of cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/newsfromnci/2002/radarkorea |title=Radar Exposure Has Little Effect on Mortality of Korean War Veterans |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209212757/http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/newsfromnci/2002/radarkorea |archivedate=2015-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent epidemiologic evidence also led to the consensus that exposure to electromagnetic fields, e.g. along power lines, did not raise incidence of [[leukemia]] or other cancers.&lt;ref name="google8"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rubin's Pathology: Clinicopathologic Foundations of Medicine|author1=Rubin, R.|author2=Strayer, D.S.|author3=Rubin, E.|author4=McDonald, J.M.|date=2008|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=9780781795166|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=kD9VZ267wDEC|page=277|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Myths==
A common myth among radar and microwave communication workers is that the exposure of the genital area to microwaves renders a man sterile for about a day. The power density necessary for this effect is however sufficient to also cause permanent damage.&lt;ref name="micrwircomtech"/&gt;

== History ==
In 1948, J. R. Butler and Martin Miller formed an oil and gas consulting partnership known as J. R. Butler and Company.  Max Lents, who was not a partner at the beginning of J. R. Butler and Company, was considered as an original founding partner when he joined the firm a year later.  The company name then changed to Butler, Miller and Lents.

In 1970 its name was changed to Butler, Miller and Lents, Ltd., at which time it became a [[S corporation|Subchapter S Corporation]].

In 1976, the name of the firm was changed to its current name, Miller and Lents, Ltd. after J. R. Butler exchanged his interest in Butler, Miller and Lents, Ltd.

== Notable employees ==
=== M. Miller and M. Lents ===
In addition to founding Miller and Lents, Ltd., Max Lents and Martin Miller made significant contributions to the field of petroleum engineering.  They introduced the Miller-Lents [[Permeability (earth sciences)|Permeability]] Distribution which aids in describing the permeability of heterogeneous reservoirs and provides a “better match with actual field performance when applied to cycling operations in gas condensate reservoirs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=James T.|last2=Cobb|first2=William M.|title=Waterflooding|date=17 Dec 1997|publisher=Petroleum Recovery Research Center|pages=5–20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="62545">{{infobox molybdenum}}
'''Molybdenum''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Mo''' and [[atomic number]] 42. The name is from [[New Latin|Neo-Latin]] ''molybdaenum'', from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Μόλυβδος}} ''{{transl|grc|molybdos}}'', meaning [[lead]], since its ores were confused with lead ores.&lt;ref name="CRCdescription"&gt;{{Cite book|contribution = Molybdenum|date = 1994|title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|volume = 4|page = 18|publisher = Chemical Rubber Publishing Company|isbn=0-8493-0474-1|editor=Lide, David R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molybdenum minerals have been known throughout history, but the element was discovered (in the sense of differentiating it as a new entity from the mineral salts of other metals) in 1778 by [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]]. The metal was first isolated in 1781 by [[Peter Jacob Hjelm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele042.html|title=It's Elemental - The Element Molybdenum|website=education.jlab.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molybdenum does not occur naturally as a [[Native metal|free metal]] on Earth; it is found only in various [[oxidation state]]s in minerals.  The free element, a silvery [[metal]] with a gray cast, has the [[List of elements by melting point|sixth-highest]] [[melting point]] of any element. It readily forms hard, stable [[carbide]]s in [[alloy]]s, and for this reason most of world production of the element (about 80%) is used in [[steel]] alloys, including high-strength alloys and [[superalloy]]s.

Most molybdenum compounds have low [[solubility]] in water, but when molybdenum-bearing minerals contact [[oxygen]] and water, the resulting [[molybdate]] ion {{chem|MoO|4|2-}} is quite soluble. Industrially, molybdenum [[Chemical compound|compounds]] (about 14% of world production of the element) are used in [[high-pressure]] and high-temperature applications as [[pigment]]s and [[Catalysis|catalysts]].

{{c|Molybdenum enzymes|Molybdenum-bearing enzymes}} are by far the most common bacterial catalysts for breaking the [[chemical bond]] in atmospheric molecular [[nitrogen]] in the process of biological [[nitrogen fixation]]. At least 50 molybdenum enzymes are now known in bacteria, plants, and animals, although only bacterial and cyanobacterial enzymes are involved in nitrogen fixation. These [[nitrogenase]]s contain molybdenum in a form different from other molybdenum enzymes, which all contain fully oxidized molybdenum in a [[molybdenum cofactor]]. These various molybdenum cofactor enzymes are vital to the organisms, and molybdenum is an [[essential element]] for life in all higher [[eukaryote]] organisms, though not in all bacteria.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
In its pure form, molybdenum is a silvery-grey metal with a [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs hardness]] of 5.5, and a standard atomic weight of 95.95&amp;nbsp;g/mol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Wieser, M. E.  |author2=Berglund, M. |date=2009 |title=Atomic weights of the elements 2007 (IUPAC Technical Report) |url=http://www.ciaaw.org/pubs/TSAW2007.pdf |journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]] |volume=81 |issue=11 |pages=2131–2156 |doi=10.1351/PAC-REP-09-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.ciaaw.org/atomic_weights3.htm| title =Current  Table of Standard Atomic Weights in Alphabetical Order: Standard Atomic weights of the elements| date =2013| author =Meija, J.| display-authors =etal| publisher =Commission on Isotopic Abundances and Atomic Weights| deadurl =bot: unknown| archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20140429050401/http://www.ciaaw.org/atomic_weights3.htm| archivedate =2014-04-29| df =}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a [[melting point]] of {{convert|2623|°C|°F}}; of the naturally occurring elements, only [[tantalum]], [[osmium]], [[rhenium]], [[tungsten]], and [[carbon]] have higher melting points.&lt;ref name="CRCdescription" /&gt; It has one of the lowest coefficients of [[thermal expansion]] among commercially used metals.&lt;ref name="nbb"&gt;{{cite book|last = Emsley|first = John|title = Nature's Building Blocks|url=https://books.google.com/?id=j-Xu07p3cKwC&amp;pg=PA265|publisher = Oxford University Press|date= 2001|location = Oxford|pages = 262–266|isbn =0-19-850341-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[tensile strength]] of molybdenum wires increases about 3 times, from about 10 to 30&amp;nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|GPa]], when their diameter decreases from ~50–100&amp;nbsp;[[Nanometre|nm]] to 10&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1088/1468-6996/10/4/045004|title=Inherent tensile strength of molybdenum nanocrystals|date=2009|last1=Shpak|first1=Anatoly P.|first2=Sergiy O.|first3=Tatjana I.|first4=Igor M.|journal=Science and Technology of Advanced Materials|volume=10|page=045004|last2=Kotrechko|last3=Mazilova|last4=Mikhailovskij|bibcode=2009STAdM..10d5004S|issue=4|pmc=5090266|pmid=27877304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties===
Molybdenum is a [[transition metal]] with an [[electronegativity]] of 2.16 on the Pauling scale. It does not visibly react with oxygen or water at room temperature. Weak oxidation of molybdenum starts at {{convert|300|°C|°F}}; bulk oxidation occurs at temperatures above 600&amp;nbsp;°C, resulting in [[molybdenum trioxide]]. Like many heavier transition metals, molybdenum shows little inclination to form a cation in aqueous solution, although the Mo&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; cation is known under carefully controlled conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Parish |first=R. V. |date=1977 |title=The Metallic Elements |url= |location=New York |publisher=Longman |pages=112, 133 |isbn=978-0-582-44278-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{Main|Isotopes of molybdenum}}
There are 35 known [[isotopes]] of molybdenum, ranging in [[atomic mass]] from 83 to 117, as well as four metastable [[nuclear isomer]]s. Seven isotopes occur naturally, with atomic masses of 92, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, and 100. Of these naturally occurring isotopes, only molybdenum-100 is unstable.&lt;ref name="Audi"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Audi|first = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties|journal = Nuclear Physics A|volume = 729|pages = 3–128|publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center|date = 2003|doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001|bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A|last2 = Bersillon|first2 = O.|last3 = Blachot|first3 = J.|last4 = Wapstra|first4 = A. H.|url = http://hal.in2p3.fr/in2p3-00014184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Molybdenum-98 is the most [[isotopic abundance|abundant]] isotope, comprising 24.14% of all molybdenum. Molybdenum-100 has a [[half-life]] of about 10&lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;[[year|y]] and undergoes [[double beta decay]] into [[ruthenium]]-100. Molybdenum isotopes with mass numbers from 111 to 117 all have half-lives of approximately 150&amp;nbsp;ns.&lt;ref name="Audi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CRCisotopes"/&gt; All unstable isotopes of molybdenum decay into isotopes of [[niobium]], [[technetium]], and [[ruthenium]].&lt;ref name="CRCisotopes"&gt;{{cite book|date = 2006|title = CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics|editor= Lide, David R.|volume = 11|pages = 87–88|publisher = CRC|isbn=0-8493-0487-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As also noted below, the most common isotopic molybdenum application involves [[molybdenum-99]], which is a fission product.

==Compounds==
{{Category see also|Molybdenum compounds}}
Molybdenum forms chemical compounds in oxidation states from -II to +VI.  Higher oxidation states are more relevant to its terrestrial occurrence and its biological roles, mid-level oxidation states are often associated with [[metal cluster]]s, and very low oxidation states are typically associated with [[organomolybdenum compound]]s.  Mo and W chemistry shows strong similarities.  The relative rarity of molybdenum(III), for example, contrasts with the pervasiveness of the chromium(III) compounds. The highest oxidation state is seen in [[molybdenum(VI) oxide]] (MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), whereas the normal sulfur compound is [[molybdenum disulfide]] MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;

From the perspective of commerce, the most important compounds are molybdenum disulfide ({{chem|MoS|2}}) and molybdenum trioxide ({{chem|MoO|3}}).  The black disulfide is the main mineral.  It is roasted in air to give the trioxide:&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;

:2 {{chem|MoS|2}} + 7 {{chem|O|2}} → 2 {{chem|MoO|3}}  +  4 {{chem|SO|2}}

The trioxide, which is volatile at high temperatures, is the precursor to virtually all other Mo compounds as well as alloys. Molybdenum has several [[oxidation state]]s, the most stable being +4 and +6 (bolded in the table at left).

Molybdenum(VI) oxide is soluble in strong [[base (chemistry)|alkaline]] water, forming molybdates (MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;). Molybdates are weaker oxidants than [[chromates]].  They tend to form structurally complex [[oxyanion]]s by condensation at lower [[pH]] values, such as [Mo&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;6−&lt;/sup&gt; and [Mo&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;26&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;4−&lt;/sup&gt;.

==History==
[[Molybdenite]]—the principal ore from which molybdenum is now extracted—was previously known as molybdena. Molybdena was confused with and often utilized as though it were [[graphite]]. Like graphite, molybdenite can be used to blacken a surface or as a solid lubricant.&lt;ref name="Lansdown1999"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Lansdown | first1 = A. R. | title = Molybdenum disulphide lubrication | volume = 35 | work = Tribology and Interface Engineering | publisher = Elsevier | date = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-444-50032-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even when molybdena was distinguishable from graphite, it was still confused with the common [[lead]] ore PbS (now called [[galena]]); the name comes from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|Μόλυβδος}} ''{{lang|grc-Latn|molybdos}}'', meaning ''lead''.&lt;ref name="nbb" /&gt; (The Greek word itself has been proposed as a [[loanword]] from [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] [[Luvian language|Luvian]] and [[Lydian language|Lydian]] languages).&lt;ref name="melchert"&gt;{{cite web|author=Melchert, Craig | url=http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/people/melchert/webpage/molybdos.pdf| title=Greek mólybdos as a Loanword from Lydian | publisher=[[University of North Carolina]] at [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] | accessdate=2011-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although (reportedly) molybdenum was deliberately alloyed with steel in one 14th-century Japanese sword (mfd. ca. 1330), that art was never employed widely and was later lost.&lt;ref&gt;International Molybdenum Association, [https://web.archive.org/web/20130722102351/http://www.imoa.info/molybdenum/molydbenum_history.php "Molybdenum History"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Accidental use of molybdenum in old sword led to new alloy | url = https://books.google.com/?id=yUpYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Japanese+sword+molybdenum&amp;dq=Japanese+sword+molybdenum | author1 = Institute | first1 = American Iron and Steel | date = 1948 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the West in 1754, [[Bengt Andersson Qvist]] examined a sample of molybdenite and determined that it did not contain lead and thus was not galena.&lt;ref name="vanderkrogt"&gt;{{cite web|last = Van der Krogt|first = Peter|title = Molybdenum|work = Elementymology &amp; Elements Multidict|date= 2006-01-10|url = http://elements.vanderkrogt.net/element.php?sym=Mo|accessdate = 2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1778 [[Sweden|Swedish]] chemist [[Carl Wilhelm Scheele]] stated firmly that molybdena was (indeed) neither galena nor graphite.&lt;ref name="elemental"&gt;{{cite web|last = Gagnon|first = Steve|title = Molybdenum|publisher = Jefferson Science Associates, LLC|url = http://education.jlab.org/itselemental/ele042.html|accessdate = 2007-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Scheele, C.

[[Peter Jacob Hjelm]] successfully isolated molybdenum using [[carbon]] and [[linseed oil]] in 1781.&lt;ref name="nbb" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Hjelm, P.

For the next century, molybdenum had no industrial use.  It was relatively scarce, the pure metal was difficult to extract, and the necessary techniques of metallurgy were immature.&lt;ref name="Hoyt1921"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Hoyt | first1 = Samuel Leslie | title = Metallography | volume = 2 | publisher = McGraw-Hill | date = 1921 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Krupp1888"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Krupp | first1 = Alfred | last2 = Wildberger | first2 = Andreas | title = The metallic alloys: A practical guide for the manufacture of all kinds of alloys, amalgams, and solders, used by metal-workers ... with an appendix on the coloring of alloys | publisher = H.C.

In 1906, [[William D. Coolidge]] filed a patent for rendering molybdenum [[Ductility|ductile]], leading to applications as a heating element for high-temperature furnaces and as a support for tungsten-filament light bulbs; oxide formation and degradation require that molybdenum be physically sealed or held in an inert gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZVkZNyVI4toC&amp;pg=PA117| page = 117 | title = The Making of American Industrial Research: Science and Business at Ge and Bell, 1876–1926 | isbn = 9780521522373 | author1 = Reich | first1 = Leonard S. | date = 2002-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, [[Frank E.

During [[World War I]], demand for molybdenum spiked; it was used both in [[Vehicle armor|armor plating]] and as a substitute for tungsten in [[high speed steel]]s. Some British tanks were protected by 75&amp;nbsp;mm (3&amp;nbsp;in) [[mangalloy|manganese steel]] plating, but this proved to be ineffective. The manganese steel plates were replaced with much lighter {{Convert|25|mm|inch|1|abbr=on}} molybdenum steel plates allowing for higher speed, greater maneuverability, and better protection.&lt;ref name="nbb" /&gt; The Germans also used molybdenum-doped [[steel]] for heavy artillery, like in the super-heavy howitzer [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Bertha]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lenntech.com/periodic/elements/mo.htm Chemical properties of molibdenum - Health effects of molybdenum - Environmental effects of molybdenum]. lenntech.com
&lt;/ref&gt; because traditional steel melts at the temperatures produced by the propellant of the [[ton|one ton]] shell.&lt;ref&gt;Sam Kean. ''The Disappearing Spoon''. Page 88–89&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, demand plummeted until metallurgical advances allowed extensive development of peacetime applications. In [[World War II]], molybdenum again saw strategic importance as a substitute for tungsten in steel alloys.&lt;ref name="Millholland1941"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Ray | last = Millholland | title = Battle of the Billions: American industry mobilizes machines, materials, and men for a job as big as digging 40 Panama Canals in one year | date = August 1941 | work = Popular Science | page = 61 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xScDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence and production==
[[File:Molly Hill molybdenite.JPG|thumb|alt=Lustrous, silvery, flat, hexagonal crystals in roughly parallel layers sit flowerlike on a rough, translucent crystalline piece of quartz.|[[Molybdenite]] on quartz]]
Molybdenum is the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|54th most abundant element in the Earth's crust]] and the 25th most abundant element in its oceans, with an average of 10&amp;nbsp;parts per billion; it is the 42nd most abundant element in the Universe.&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nostrand"&gt;{{cite book|contribution = Molybdenum|date = 2005|title = Van Nostrand's Encyclopedia of Chemistry|pages = 1038–1040|place= New York|publisher = Wiley-Interscience|isbn=978-0-471-61525-5|editor= Considine, Glenn D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian [[Luna 24]] mission discovered a molybdenum-bearing grain (1 × 0.6&amp;nbsp;µm) in a [[pyroxene]] fragment taken from [[Mare Crisium]] on the [[Moon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Abstracts/2002_Abstracts/Jan02_Abstracts/Jambor_p181_02.pdf|title=New mineral names|journal=American Mineralogist|volume=87|page=181|date=2002|author=Jambor, J.L.|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comparative rarity of molybdenum in the Earth's crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water-insoluble ores, often combined with sulfur in the same way as copper, with which it is often found. Though molybdenum is found in such [[mineral]]s as [[wulfenite]] (PbMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[powellite]] (CaMoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), the main commercial source is [[molybdenite]] (Mo[[sulfur|S]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Molybdenum is mined as a principal ore and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining.&lt;ref name="CRCdescription" /&gt;

The world's production of molybdenum was 250,000 tonnes in 2011, the largest producers being China (94,000&amp;nbsp;t), the United States (64,000&amp;nbsp;t), Chile (38,000&amp;nbsp;t), Peru (18,000&amp;nbsp;t) and Mexico (12,000&amp;nbsp;t). The total reserves are estimated at 10 million tonnes, and are mostly concentrated in China (4.3&amp;nbsp;Mt), the US (2.7&amp;nbsp;Mt) and Chile (1.2&amp;nbsp;Mt). By continent, 93% of world molybdenum production is about evenly shared between North America, South America (mainly in Chile), and China. Europe and the rest of Asia (mostly Armenia, Russia, Iran and Mongolia) produce the remainder.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt;

[[File:Molybdenum world production.svg|thumb|World production trend]]

In molybdenite processing, the ore is first roasted in air at a temperature of {{convert|700|°C|°F}}.  The process gives gaseous sulfur dioxide and the  [[molybdenum(VI) oxide]]:&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;

:2 MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 7 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; +  4 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

The oxidized ore is then usually extracted with aqueous ammonia to give ammonium molybdate:
:MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  →  (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(MoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)
Copper, an impurity in molybdenite, is less soluble in ammonia. To completely remove it from the solution, it is precipitated with [[hydrogen sulfide]].&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt;  Ammonium molybdate converts to [[ammonium dimolybdate]], which is isolated as a solid.  Heating this solid gives molybdenum trioxide:&lt;ref name=ullmann&gt;Sebenik, Roger F. et al. (2005) "Molybdenum and Molybdenum Compounds" in ''Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology''. Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a16_655}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;   →   2 MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
Crude trioxide can be further purified by sublimation at {{convert|1100|°C|°F}}.

Metallic molybdenum is produced by reduction of the oxide with hydrogen:
:MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;   +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →   Mo  +  3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

The molybdenum for steel production is reduced by the [[aluminothermic reaction]] with addition of iron to produce [[ferromolybdenum]]. A common form of ferromolybdenum contains 60% molybdenum.&lt;ref name="Holl"&gt;{{cite book|publisher = Walter de Gruyter|date = 1985|edition = 91–100|pages = 1096–1104|isbn = 3-11-007511-3|title = Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|author=Holleman, Arnold F. |author2=Wiberg, Egon |author3=Wiberg, Nils}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Gupta|first = C.

Molybdenum had a value of approximately $30,000 per tonne as of August 2009.

===History of molybdenum mining===
Historically, the [[Knaben]] mine in southern Norway, opened in 1885, was the first dedicated molybdenum mine. It was closed in 1973 but was reopened in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/S0375-6742(96)00069-6|title = Dispersion of tailings in the Knabena—Kvina drainage basin, Norway, 1: Evaluation of overbank sediments as sampling medium for regional geochemical mapping|date = 1997|last1 = Langedal|first1 = M.|journal = Journal of Geochemical Exploration|volume = 58|pages= 157–172|issue = 2–3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and now produces {{Convert|100000|kg|ton|0}} of molybdenum disulfide per year.

==Applications==

===Alloys===
[[File:Plate of Molybdenum Copper .jpg|thumb|A plate of molybdenum copper alloy]]
About 86% of molybdenum produced is used in [[metallurgy]], with the rest used in chemical applications. The estimated global use is structural steel 35%, [[stainless steel]] 25%, chemicals 14%, tool &amp; high-speed steels 9%, [[cast iron]] 6%, molybdenum elemental metal 6%, and [[superalloy]]s 5%.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120310004452/http://www.lme.com/minormetals/6782.asp Pie chart of world Mo uses]. London Metal Exchange.&lt;/ref&gt;

Molybdenum can withstand extreme temperatures without significantly expanding or softening, making it useful in environments of intense heat, including military armor, aircraft parts, electrical contacts, industrial motors, and filaments.&lt;ref name="nbb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="azom" /&gt;

Most high-strength steel [[alloy]]s (for example, [[41xx steel]]s) contain 0.25% to 8% molybdenum.&lt;ref name="CRCdescription" /&gt; Even in these small portions, more than 43,000 tonnes of molybdenum are used each year in [[stainless steel]]s, [[tool steel]]s, cast irons, and high-temperature [[Superalloy|superalloys]].&lt;ref name="Nostrand" /&gt;

Molybdenum increases lattice strain, thus increasing the energy required to dissolve iron atoms from the surface.{{contradict-inline|date=September 2018}} Molybdenum is also used to enhance the corrosion resistance of ferritic (for example grade 444) and martensitic (for example 1.4122 and 1.4418) stainless steels.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Because of its lower density and more stable price, molybdenum is sometimes used in place of tungsten.&lt;ref name="Nostrand" /&gt; An example is the 'M' series of high-speed steels such as M2, M4 and M42 as substitution for the 'T' steel series, which contain tungsten. Molybdenum can also be used as a flame-resistant coating for other metals. Although its melting point is {{convert|2623|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, molybdenum rapidly oxidizes at temperatures above {{convert|760|°C|°F|abbr=on}} making it better-suited for use in vacuum environments.&lt;ref name="azom"&gt;{{cite web|title=Molybdenum|publisher=AZoM.com Pty.

TZM (Mo (~99%), Ti (~0.5%), Zr (~0.08%) and some C) is a corrosion-resisting molybdenum superalloy that resists molten fluoride salts at temperatures above {{convert|1300|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. It has about twice the strength of pure Mo, and is more ductile and more weldable, yet in tests it resisted corrosion of a standard eutectic salt ([[FLiBe]]) and salt vapors used in [[molten salt reactor]]s for 1100 hours with so little corrosion that it was difficult to measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smallwood|first=Robert E.|title=ASTM special technical publication 849: Refractory metals and their industrial applications: a symposium|url=https://books.google.com/?id=agaacIr25KcC&amp;pg=PA9|date=1984|publisher=ASTM International|isbn=9780803102033|page=9|chapter=TZM Moly Alloy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.energyfromthorium.com/forum/download/file.php?id=805|title = Compatibility of Molybdenum-Base Alloy TZM, with LiF-BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-ThF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-UF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;|publisher = Oak Ridge National Laboratory Report|accessdate = 2010-09-02|date = December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other molybdenum-based alloys that do not contain iron have only limited applications. For example, because of its resistance to molten zinc, both pure molybdenum and molybdenum-[[tungsten]] alloys (70%/30%) are used for piping, stirrers and pump impellers that come into contact with molten zinc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title =Tool and manufacturing engineers handbook|first = W.

Molybdenum deficiency has also been reported as a consequence of non-molybdenum supplemented [[total parenteral nutrition]] (complete intravenous feeding) for long periods of time. It results in high blood levels of [[sulfite]] and [[urate]], in much the same way as [[molybdenum cofactor deficiency]]. However (presumably since pure molybdenum deficiency from this cause occurs primarily in adults), the neurological consequences are not as marked as in cases of congenital cofactor deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1911702|pmid=6426561|date=1984|last1=Abumrad|first1=N.

===Related diseases===
A congenital [[molybdenum cofactor deficiency]] disease, seen in infants, is an inability to synthesize [[molybdenum cofactor]], the heterocyclic molecule discussed above that binds molybdenum at the active site in all known human enzymes that use molybdenum.  The resulting deficiency results in high levels of [[sulfite]] and [[urate]], and neurological damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.jbc.org/content/283/25/17370.full|title=Splice-specific Functions of Gephyrin in Molybdenum Cofactor Biosynthesis|author=Smolinsky, B|journal=Journal of Biological Chemistry|doi=10.1074/jbc.M800985200|date=2008|volume=283|pages=17370–9|pmid=18411266|issue=25|last2=Eichler|first2=S.

===Copper-molybdenum antagonism===
High levels of molybdenum can interfere with the body's uptake of [[copper]], producing [[copper deficiency]]. Molybdenum prevents plasma proteins from binding to copper, and it also increases the amount of copper that is excreted in [[urine]]. [[Ruminant]]s that consume high levels of molybdenum suffer from [[diarrhea]], stunted growth, [[anemia]], and [[Human hair color#Aging or achromotrichia|achromotrichia]] (loss of fur pigment). These symptoms can be alleviated by copper supplements, either dietary and injection.&lt;ref name="suttle"&gt;{{cite journal|last = Suttle|first = N. F.|title = Recent studies of the copper-molybdenum antagonism|journal = Proceedings of the Nutrition Society|volume = 33|issue = 3|pages = 299–305|publisher = CABI Publishing|date= 1974|doi = 10.1079/PNS19740053|pmid = 4617883}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effective copper deficiency can be aggravated by excess [[sulfur]].&lt;ref name="Nostrand" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hauer, Gerald [http://www.bisoncentre.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=59&amp;Itemid=256 Copper deficiency in cattle]. Bison Producers of Alberta. Accessed Dec. 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Copper reduction or deficiency can also be deliberately induced for therapeutic purposes by the compound [[ammonium tetrathiomolybdate]], in which the bright red anion '''tetrathiomolybdate''' is the copper-chelating agent. Tetrathiomolybdate was first used therapeutically in the treatment of [[copper toxicosis]] in animals. It was then introduced as a treatment in [[Wilson's disease]], a hereditary copper metabolism disorder in humans; it acts both by competing with copper absorption in the bowel and by increasing excretion. It has also been found to have an inhibitory effect on [[angiogenesis]], potentially by inhibiting the membrane translocation process that is dependent on copper ions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Nickel, W|title = The Mystery of nonclassical protein secretion, a current view on cargo proteins and potential export routes|journal = [[Eur.

==Dietary recommendations==
In 2000, the then U.S. Institute of Medicine (now the [[National Academy of Medicine]], NAM) updated its Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for molybdenum. If there is not sufficient information to establish EARs and RDAs, an estimate designated [[Adequate Intake]] (AI) is used instead.

An AI of 2&amp;nbsp;[[microgram]]s (μg) of molybdenum per day was established for infants up to 6&amp;nbsp;months of age, and 3&amp;nbsp;μg/day from 7 to 12&amp;nbsp;months of age, both for males and females. For older children and adults, the following daily RDAs have been established for molybdenum: 17&amp;nbsp;μg from 1 to 3&amp;nbsp;years of age, 22&amp;nbsp;μg from 4 to 8&amp;nbsp;years, 34&amp;nbsp;μg from 9 to 13&amp;nbsp;years, 43&amp;nbsp;μg from 14 to 18 years, and 45&amp;nbsp;μg for persons 19 years old and older. All these RDAs are valid for both sexes. [[Pregnancy|Pregnant]] or [[Breastfeeding|lactating]] females from 14 to 50&amp;nbsp;years of age have a higher daily RDA of 50&amp;nbsp;μg of molybdenum.

As for safety, the NAM sets [[tolerable upper intake level]]s (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of molybdenum, the UL is 2000&amp;nbsp;μg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs, AIs and ULs are referred to as [[Dietary Reference Intake]]s (DRIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = [[Institute of Medicine]] | title = Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin A, Vitamin K, Arsenic, Boron, Chromium, Copper, Iodine, Iron, Manganese, Molybdenum, Nickel, Silicon, Vanadium, and Zinc | chapter = Molybdenum | publisher = The National Academies Press | year = 2000 | location = Washington, DC | pages = 420–441 | url = https://www.nap.edu/read/10026/chapter/13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Food Safety Authority]] (EFSA) refers to the collective set of information as Dietary Reference Values, with Population Reference Intake (PRI) instead of RDA, and Average Requirement instead of EAR. AI and UL defined the same as in United States. For women and men ages 15 and older the AI is set at 65&amp;nbsp;μg/day. Pregnant and lactating women have the same AI. For children aged 1–14&amp;nbsp;years, the AIs increase with age from 15 to 45&amp;nbsp;μg/day. The adult AIs are higher than the U.S. RDAs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Overview on Dietary Reference Values for the EU population as derived by the EFSA Panel on Dietetic Products, Nutrition and Allergies| year = 2017| url = https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/assets/DRV_Summary_tables_jan_17.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on the other hand, the European Food Safety Authority reviewed the same safety question and set its UL at 600&amp;nbsp;μg/day, which is much lower than the U.S. value.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| title = Tolerable Upper Intake Levels For Vitamins And Minerals| publisher = European Food Safety Authority| year = 2006| url = http://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/efsa_rep/blobserver_assets/ndatolerableuil.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For U.S. food and dietary supplement labeling purposes, the amount in a serving is expressed as a percent of Daily Value (%DV). For molybdenum labeling purposes 100% of the Daily Value was 75&amp;nbsp;μg, but as of May 27, 2016 it was revised to 45&amp;nbsp;μg.&lt;ref name="FedReg"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2016-05-27/pdf/2016-11867.pdf |title=Federal Register May 27, 2016 Food Labeling: Revision of the Nutrition and Supplement Facts Labels. FR page 33982.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A table of the old and new adult Daily Values is provided at [[Reference Daily Intake]]. The original deadline to be in compliance was July 28, 2018, but on September 29, 2017 the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) released a proposed rule that extended the deadline to January 1, 2020 for large companies and January 1, 2021 for small companies.&lt;ref name="FDAdelay"&gt;[https://www.fda.gov/Food/GuidanceRegulation/GuidanceDocumentsRegulatoryInformation/LabelingNutrition/ucm385663.htm#dates "Changes to the Nutrition Facts Panel - Compliance Date"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food sources==
Average daily intake varies between 120 and 240 μg/day, which is higher than dietary recommendations.&lt;ref name="Coug"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/BF01811327|title=The role of molybdenum in human biology|date=1983|last=Coughlan|first = M.

Other significant dietary sources include green beans, eggs, sunflower seeds, wheat flour, lentils, cucumbers, and cereal grain.&lt;ref name="nbb" /&gt;

==Precautions==
Molybdenum dusts and fumes, generated by mining or metalworking, can be toxic, especially if ingested (including dust trapped in the [[paranasal sinuses|sinuses]] and later swallowed).&lt;ref name="ORNL" /&gt; Low levels of prolonged exposure can cause irritation to the eyes and skin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6105">'''Oil regeneration''' - is extraction of contaminants from [[oil]] in order to restore its original properties to be used equally with fresh oils.&lt;ref name="Regeneration of spent transformer oil"&gt;[http://iasj.net/iasj?func=fulltext&amp;aId=24692 Abdul-Halim Adbul-Karim Mohammed, Mohammed Abbas Kadhum (December 2010). Regeneration of spent transformer oil. Journal of Engineering. Number 4. pp. 5799 -5810]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oil aging==
Aging is a result of physical and [[chemical process]]es that change oil during storage and use in machines and mechanisms.
The main cause of aging is exposure to high [[temperature]]s and contact with air that leads to oxidation, decomposition, polymerization and condensation of hydrocarbons. Another cause of aging is contamination with metal particles, [[water]] and [[dust]]. Their accumulation leads to build up of slurries, resinous and asphaltic compounds, coke, soot, various salts and acids in the oils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Difference between Oil Purification and Oil Regeneration|url=https://fuelcleaning.globecore.com/difference-between-oil-purification-and-oil-regeneration/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The oil in which aging process occurs, cannot fully perform its functions. Therefore, it is either replaced with new oil or regenerated.

==Regeneration by physical methods==
Physical methods of regeneration do not change the chemical properties of oil. They remove only mechanical impurities (metal particles, sand, dust, as well as tar, asphalt and coke-like substances, water).
Regeneration by physical methods include:
* [[sedimentation]]. This method is often used as the first stage in regeneration.  The contamination particles in oil settle down, due to gravity;&lt;ref name="Regeneration of used engine oil"&gt;[http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2013/WCE2013_pp565-568.pdf Isah, A. G., Abdulkadir, M., Onifade, K. R., Musa, U., Garba, M. U., Bawa, A. A and Sani, Y. (3-5 July 2013). Regeneration of used engine oil. Proceedings of the World Congress on Engineering. Vol I.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[centrifugation]] - separates oil into layers (an oil layer, a rag layer, a water layer,) by centrifugal forces;&lt;ref name="Modern Approach to Problems of Transformer Oil Purification"&gt;[http://www.tribology.fink.rs/journals/2002/3-4/7.pdf Mačužić I., Jeremić B. (2002). Modern approach to problems of transformer oil purification. Tribology in industry. Vol. 24. No. 3&amp;4. pp. 39-43.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[filtration]] - separates suspensions into clean liquid and wet sediment with the help of filters;&lt;ref name="Used oil recycling markets and best management practices in the United States"&gt;[http://infohouse.p2ric.org/ref/05/04827.pdf Used oil recycling markets and best management practices in the United States. The National Recycling Congress. September 15, 1992. Boston, MA.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Washing with water and dry washing to remove acidic products from oil (water-soluble low-molecular acids, salts of organic acids).

==Regeneration by physicochemical methods==

Physicochemical methods are based on the use of [[Coagulation (water treatment)|coagulants]] and [[Adsorption|adsorbents]].&lt;ref name="Recycling of Used Lubricating Oil Using Three Samples of Acids
and Clay as a Method of Treatment"&gt;[http://www.soeagra.com/iaast/iaastjune2013/2.pdf Udonne J.D, Bakare O.A. (June 2013). Recycling of Used Lubricating Oil Using Three Samples of Acids and Clay as a Method of Treatment. IAAST Vol 4. pp. 8-14.]&lt;/ref&gt; Coagulants promote the coarsening and precipitation of fine-dispersed asphalt-resinous substances in oil. Adsorbents selectively absorb organic and inorganic compounds. These methods remove asphalt and resinous compounds, emulsified and dissolved water from oil. Adsorptive treatment with bleaching clays neutralizes free acid in acid-treated oil, unstable oxidized and sulphurized products as well as traces of sulphonic acid. In addition, clay treatment leads to higher resistance to oil oxidation at high temperatures and increased colour stability. This process is used in clay polishing plants for waste oil re-refining and transformer oil regeneration systems for the reclamation of old transformer oil to as-new condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Audibert|first1=François|title=Waste engine oils : rerefining and energy recovery|date=2006|publisher=Elsevier|location=Amsterdam [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-444-52202-3|edition=1.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regeneration by chemical methods==

Chemical methods of regeneration remove asphalt, silicic, acidic, some hetero-organic compounds and water from oils. These methods are based on the interaction of contaminating substances in oil with special [[reagent]]s introduced into them.&lt;ref name="Recycling of Used Lubricating Oil Using Three Samples of Acids

IAAST Vol 4. pp. 8-14.]&lt;/ref&gt; The compounds formed as a result of these chemical reactions are then easily removed from oil. Chemical methods include acid and alkaline refining, drying with calcium sulphate or reduction with metal hydrides.

==Choice of methods of regeneration==

In practice, to achieve a complete regeneration of oil using only one method is difficult. Therefore, a combination of different approaches are often used.&lt;ref name="Experimental regeneration process of used motor oils"&gt;[http://www.cder.dz/download/Art17-2_15.pdf Danane F., Ahmia A., Bakiri A., Lalaoui N. (2014). Experimental regeneration process of used motor oils. Revue des Energies Renouvelables. Vol. 17. N°2. pp. 345 – 351]&lt;/ref&gt;
The choice of methods is influenced by factors such as the nature and origin of aging products, the requirements for regenerated oils, the amount of collected [[waste oil]].

The '''Q and R Holes''' are a series of concentric sockets which currently represent the earliest known evidence for a stone structure on the site of [[Stonehenge]].

Beneath the turf and just inside the later [[Sarsen Circle]] are a double arc of buried stoneholes, the only surviving evidence of the first stone structure (possibly a double stone circle) erected within the centre of Stonehenge (Figs.1 &amp; 2) and currently regarded as instigating the period known as Stonehenge Phase 3i. This phase tentatively began as early as 2600 BC, although recent radiocarbon dates from samples retrieved from one of the sockets in 2008 during excavations by Darvill and Wainwright suggest a date of around 2400 to 2300 BC. The final report is yet to be published, but some interesting results follow from the partial excavation of Q Hole 13 where 'associations with Beaker pottery' where noted.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Darvill and Geoffrey Wainwright Stonehenge excavations 2008. The Antiquaries Journal,  Published online by Cambridge University Press 21 Apr 2009 {{doi|10.1017/S000358150900002X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although first encountered by [[William Hawley]] in the 1920s, it was [[Richard J.C. Atkinson|Richard Atkinson]] who formally identified and named these irregular settings in 1954: ‘In choosing this designation, I had in mind John Aubrey’s frequent use, as a marginal note…of the phrase ‘quaere quot’ – ‘inquire how many’ – which seemed appropriate to the occasion.’ &lt;ref&gt;Atkinson, R J C, ''Stonehenge'' (Penguin Books, 1979) p.58 {{ISBN|0-14-020450-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their place at the beginning of the stone monument phase has been recognized from their stratigraphic relationships: in places they were cut through by both the settings of the later and still partly surviving [[Bluestone Circle]] and also by a stonehole dug for one of the uprights of the Sarsen Circle.&lt;ref&gt;Cleal, R. M. J., Walker, K. E. &amp; Montague, R., ''[[Stonehenge in its landscape]]'' (English Heritage, London, 1995) p.578 {{ISBN|1-85074-605-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stonehenge Q&amp;R.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Fig.2 The Q and R Holes, their location in relation to the later stone monument. Zoom to full extent to view Q &amp; R settings]]

==Description==
The diameter of the outer (Q) circuit is c. 26.2 m and that of the inner (R) is, 22.5 m; with an average spacing between the paired stone settings of 1.5 m.  These trench-like intrusions are roughly 2 m long and 1 m wide, set radially and slightly enlarged at each end to provide paired stone sockets to a depth of around 0.6 m, the intervening strip generally re-filled with chalk rubble. [[File:QandR.jpg|right|thumb|400px|Fig.3 The Q and R Holes, possibly 40 paired settings. The Stonehenge axis was established when the inset 'portal settings' were added on the northeast (after Johnson 2008)]]Atkinson described them as being ‘dumb-bell’ shaped, although not all were of this form. The bases of some sockets bore ‘the impressions…of heavy stones’ some with ‘minute chips of dolerite [i.e. bluestone] embedded. While this does not imply that ''only'' bluestones were used in the Q and R structure he found no evidence for sarsens. His accounts make it clear that he believed the sockets to have exclusively located bluestones 'presumably the same stones that are still at Stonehenge'.&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson 1979, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Atkinson estimated that if the Q and R Holes originally formed a complete circle that 38 pairs would have been present,&lt;ref&gt;Atkinson 1979, p.60&lt;/ref&gt; although recent computer-modeling shows that there is actually room for 40.&lt;ref&gt;Darvill, Timothy, ''Stonehenge, The Biography of a Landscape''  (Tempus 2006), pp.119-121 {{ISBN|0-7524-3641-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Anthony, ''Solving Stonehenge: The New Key to an Ancient Enigma''  (Thames &amp; Hudson, 2008)  pp.129-134 {{ISBN|978-0-500-05155-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Q and R Holes not only represent the foundation cuts for the first central stone construction, but they also were to include several additional stone settings on the northeast. This modified group face the midsummer sunrise with a possible reciprocal stone aligned on the midwinter sunset. This is the first evidence for any unambiguous  alignment at Stonehenge (the solstice axis). The analysis of the spacing between the Q and R array, and that of the modified (inset) portal group (Fig.3) imply a shift from an angular splay of 9 degrees (i.e. 40 settings) to 12 degrees, the same as that of the later 30 Sarsen Circle. How long the bluestones remained in the Q and R settings before they were removed (if indeed this early structure was ever completed) is not known. However the dates suggested from the 2008 excavation (above) implies the Q &amp; R arrays were perhaps no earlier than 2,400 BC, presenting a challenge to the recently accepted Late Neolithic date for the construction of the iconic sarsen monument.

'''Radiophobia''' is an [[phobia|obsessive fear]] of [[ionizing radiation]], in particular, fear of [[X-rays]]. While in some cases radiation may be harmful (i.e. [[radiation-induced cancer]], and [[acute radiation syndrome]]), the effects of poor information, understanding, or a traumatic experience may cause unnecessary or even irrational fear.&lt;ref&gt;Note i.e. {{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/national-science-foundation-survey-2014-2 |title=Here's The Basic Science Question That 1 In 4 Americans Got Wrong |date=19 February 2014 |author=Dina Spector |website= [[Business Insider]] |accessdate=10 December 2014}} "a survey of more than 2,200 people in the United States, conducted by the [[National Science Foundation]] in 2012 [...] tests the public's knowledge of basic facts in the physical and biological sciences [...] All radioactivity is man-made.

== Early use ==
The term was used in a paper entitled "Radio-phobia and radio-mania" presented by Dr Albert Soiland of Los Angeles in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10421078/medicos_meet_radiophobia_1903/|title=Medicos meet (radiophobia) (1903)|date=1903-06-03|work=The Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-04-21|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, the term was used to describe people who were afraid of [[radio]] broadcasting and receiving technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10421099/radio_show_big_success_1926/|title=Radio show big success (1926)|date=1926-10-27|work=The Republic|access-date=2017-04-21|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10421114/radio_fans_storm_annual_convention_and/|title=Radio fans storm annual convention and show here (1922)|date=1922-03-08|work=The Brooklyn Daily Eagle|access-date=2017-04-21|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, radiophobia was referred to in ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' as a "fear of loudspeakers",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10421125/have_you_a_phobia_1931/|title=Have you a phobia?

In a newspaper column published in 1970, Dr Harold Pettit MD wrote:&lt;blockquote&gt;"A healthy respect for the hazards of radiation is desirable. When atomic testing began in the early fifties, these hazards were grossly exaggerated, producing a new psychological disorder which has been called "radiophobia" or "nuclear neurosis".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10421263/xrays_demand_respect_1970/|title=X-Rays Demand Respect (1970)|date=1970-01-01|work=Aiken Standard|access-date=2017-04-21|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Castle Bravo and its influence on public perception==
March 1, 1954, the operation [[Castle Bravo]] testing of a then, first of its kind, experimental thermonuclear ''Shrimp'' device, overshot its predicted yield of 4–6 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]] and instead produced 15 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]]; this resulted in an unanticipated amount of ''Bikini snow'' or visible particles of [[nuclear fallout]] being produced, fallout which caught the Japanese fishing boat the [[Daigo Fukuryū Maru]] or ''Lucky Dragon'' in its plume, even though it was fishing outside the initially predicted ~5 [[TNT equivalent|megaton]] fallout area which had been cordoned off for the [[Castle Bravo]] test. Approximately 2 weeks after the test and fallout exposure, the 23-member fishing crew began to fall ill, with [[acute radiation sickness]], largely brought on by [[beta burn]]s that were caused by direct contact between the ''Bikini snow'' fallout and their skin, through their practice of scooping the "Bikini snow" into bags with their bare hands. One member of the crew, Kuboyama Aikichi the boat's chief radioman, died 7 months later, on September 23, 1954.&lt;ref&gt;http://search.japantimes.co.jp/mail/ed20090301a2.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brit&gt;Lorna Arnold and Mark Smith. (2006). [[Britain, Australia and the Bomb]], Palgrave Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later estimated that about a hundred fishing boats were contaminated to some degree by fallout from the test. Inhabitants of the [[Marshall Islands]] were also exposed to fallout, and a number of islands had to be evacuated.&lt;ref name=brit/&gt;

This incident, due to the era of secrecy around nuclear weapons, created widespread fear of uncontrolled and unpredictable nuclear weapons, and also of radioactively contaminated fish affecting the Japanese food supply. With the publication of [[Joseph Rotblat]]'s findings that the contamination caused by the [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]] from the Castle Bravo test was nearly a thousand times greater than that stated officially,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} outcry in Japan reached such a level that the incident was dubbed by some as "a second Hiroshima".&lt;ref name="honoluluweekly"&gt;{{cite web|date=February 25, 2004 |url=http://www.honoluluweekly.com/archives/coverstory%202004/2-25-04%20Bravo%20shot/Bravo%20shot.html |title=Shot in the Dark |publisher=[[Honolulu Weekly]] |accessdate=2008-11-30 |last=Beverly Deepe Keever |quote=The Japanese government and people dubbed it “a second Hiroshima” and it nearly led to severing diplomatic relations. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828090108/http://honoluluweekly.com/archives/coverstory%202004/2-25-04%20Bravo%20shot/Bravo%20shot.html |archivedate=August 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent the subsequent strong [[anti-nuclear movement]] from turning into an anti-American movement,{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} the Japanese and U.S. governments agreed on compensation of 2 million [[dollars]]{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} for the contaminated fishery, with the surviving 22 crew men receiving about [[¥]] 2 million each,&lt;ref name="chugoku"&gt;{{cite web |date=Feb 29, 2004|url = http://www.chugoku-np.co.jp/abom/04e/kyodo/Ak04022901.html|title = Bikini Atoll H-bomb damaged fisheries, created prejudice|publisher = chugoku| accessdate = 2008-11-30 | last=Keiji Hirano |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerard DeGroot, ''The Bomb: A Life'', Random House, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; ($5,556 in 1954, ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5556|1954|r=-2}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}&lt;ref name="inflation"&gt;On 25 April 1949 the US dollar was pegged to the YEN at [[Japanese yen#Historical exchange rate|$USD 1 = 360 YEN]]&lt;/ref&gt;)

The surviving crew members, and their family, would later experience prejudice and discrimination, as local people thought that radiation was contagious.&lt;ref name="chugoku"/&gt;

== Radiophobia in popular culture ==
The [[Castle Bravo]] test and the new fears of radioactive fallout inspired a new direction in art and cinema. The [[Godzilla]] films, beginning with [[Ishirō Honda]]'s landmark 1954 film ''Gojira'', are strong metaphors for post-war radiophobia. The opening scene of Gojira echoes the story of the Daigo Fukuryū Maru, from the initial distant flash of light to survivors being found with radiation burns. Although he found the special effects unconvincing, [[Roger Ebert]] stated that the film was "an important one" and "properly decoded, was the [[Fahrenheit 9/11]] of its time."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040702/REVIEWS/407020315/1023 Chicago Sun-Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

A year after the Castle Bravo test, [[Akira Kurosawa]] examined one person's unreasoning terror of radiation and [[nuclear war]] in his 1955 film ''[[I Live in Fear]]''. At the end of the film, the foundry worker who lives in fear has been declared incompetent by his family, but the possible partial validity of his fears has transferred over to his doctor.

Nevil Shute's 1957 novel ''[[On the Beach (novel)|On the Beach]]'' depicts a future just six years later, based on the premise that a nuclear war has released so much radioactive fallout that all life in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] has been killed. The novel is set in Australia, which, along with the rest of the [[Southern Hemisphere]], awaits a similar and inevitable fate. [[Helen Caldicott]] describes reading the novel in [[adolescence]] as 'a formative event' in her becoming part of the anti-nuclear movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url        = http://www.cnn.com/2011/OPINION/03/25/caldicott.nuclear.health/| title      = Nuclear radiation 'the greatest public health hazard'| author     = &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;| date       = 25 March 2011| website    = [[CNN]]| accessdate = 9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=={{anchor|Radiophobia and Chernobyl}}Radiophobia and Chernobyl==
In the former [[Soviet Union]] many patients with negligible radioactive exposure after the [[Chernobyl disaster]] displayed extreme anxiety about low level radiation exposure,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10421633/radiophobia_hits_ussr_after_chernobyl/|title=Radiophobia hits USSR after Chernobyl (1988)|date=1988-02-10|work=Tyrone Daily Herald|access-date=2017-04-21|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10421653/need_to_alert_chernobylarea_residents/|title=Need to alert Chernobyl-area residents of cancer threat debated (1988)|date=1988-05-14|work=The San Bernardino County Sun|access-date=2017-04-21|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore developed many [[psychosomatic]] problems, with an increase in [[fatalism|fatalistic]] [[alcoholism]] also being observed. As Japanese health and radiation specialist Shunichi Yamashita noted:&lt;ref name="spiegel.de"&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/studying-the-fukushima-aftermath-people-are-suffering-from-radiophobia-a-780810.html&lt;/ref&gt; {{Quote|We know from Chernobyl that the [[psychological]] consequences are enormous.

The term "radiation phobia syndrome" was introduced in  1987.&lt;ref&gt;Bella Belbéoch, [http://www.unige.ch/sebes/textes/1998/98BelbeochB.html RESPONSABILITES OCCIDENTALES DANS LES CONSEQUENCES SANITAIRES DE LA CATASTROPHE DE TCHERNOBYL, EN BIELORUSSIE, UKRAINE ET RUSSIE], in: ''Radioprotection et Droit nucléaire'' [eds.: Ivo Rens and, Joël Jakubec, collection SEBES, 1998, pp. 247-261  (English translation: [http://ru.indymedia.org/usermedia/text/10/western_responsability.html "Western responsibility regarding the health consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe in Belarus, the Ukraine and Russia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726002457/http://ru.indymedia.org/usermedia/text/10/western_responsability.html |date=2011-07-26 }})&lt;/ref&gt; by L. A. Ilyin and O. A. Pavlovsky in their report "Radiological consequences of the Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union and measures taken to mitigate their impact".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull294/29402791724.pdf L. A. Ilyin and O. A. Pavlovsky,"Radiological consequences of the Chernobyl accident in the Soviet Union and measures taken to mitigate their impact"] IAEA Bulletin 4/1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

The author of ''Chernobyl Poems'' [[Lyubov Sirota]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/chernobyl_poems/chernobyl_index.html "The Chernobyl Poems of Lyubov Sirota"]&lt;/ref&gt;  wrote in her poem [http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/chernobyl_poems/chernobyl_poems.html#radiophobia "Radiophobia"]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Is this only&amp;mdash;a fear of radiation? &lt;br&gt;
Perhaps rather&amp;mdash;a fear of wars? &lt;br&gt;
Perhaps&amp;mdash;the dread of betrayal, &lt;br&gt;
Cowardice, stupidity, lawlessness?&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term has been criticized by Adolph Kharash, Science Director at the [[Moscow State University]] because, he writes, &lt;blockquote&gt;It treats the normal impulse to self-protection, natural to everything living, your moral suffering, your anguish and your concern about the fate of your children, relatives and friends, and your own physical suffering and sickness as a result of delirium, of pathological perversion&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/chernobyl_poems/harash.html#phobia "A Voice from Dead Pripyat" by Adolph Kharash Science Director, Moscow State University] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528011506/http://www.wsu.edu/~brians/chernobyl_poems/harash.html |date=2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, it must be noted that the psychological phobia of radiation in sufferers may not coincide with an actual life-threatening exposure to an individual or their children.  Radiophobia refers only to a display of anxiety disproportionate to the actual quantity of radiation one is exposed to, with, in many cases, radiation exposure values equal to, or not much higher than, that which individuals are naturally exposed to every day from [[background radiation]]. Anxiety following a response to an actual life-threatening level of exposure to radiation is not considered to be radiophobia, nor misplaced anxiety, but a normal, appropriate response.

Marvin Goldman is an American doctor who provided commentary to newspapers claiming that radiophobia had taken a larger toll than the fallout itself had, and that radiophobia was to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/10421912/chernobyl_aftereffects_mostly/|title=Chernobyl Aftereffects Mostly Psychological (radiophobia) (1988)|date=1988-12-19|work=Daily Sitka Sentinel|access-date=2017-04-21|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Chernobyl abortions===
Following the accident, [[journalist]]s mistrusted many medical professionals (such as the spokesman from the UK [[National Radiological Protection Board]]), and in turn encouraged the public to mistrust them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kasperson|first=Roger E.|author2=Stallen, Pieter Jan M. |title=Communicating Risks to the Public: International Perspectives|publisher=Springer Science and Media|year=1991|location=Berlin|pages=160–162|isbn=0-7923-0601-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the European continent, in nations where abortion is legal, many requests for induced abortions, of otherwise normal pregnancies, were obtained out of fears of radiation from Chernobyl; including an excess number of abortions of healthy human [[fetuses]] in [[Denmark]] in the months following the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 1912378 | volume=45 | title=Legally induced abortions in Denmark after Chernobyl. | year=1991 | journal=Biomed Pharmacother | pages=229–31 | doi=10.1016/0753-3322(91)90022-l}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|As the increase in radiation in Denmark was so low that almost no increased risk of birth defects was expected, the public debate and anxiety among the pregnant women and their husbands "caused" more fetal deaths in Denmark than the accident. This underlines the importance of public debate, the role of the mass media and of the way in which National Health authorities participate in this debate.}}

In [[Greece]], following the accident there was panic and [[misinformation|false rumors]] which led to many [[obstetrician]]s initially thinking it prudent to interrupt otherwise wanted pregnancies and/or were unable to resist requests from worried pregnant mothers over fears of radiation, within a few weeks misconceptions within the medical profession were largely cleared up, although worries persisted in the general population. Although it was determined that the [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] to [[Greek people|Greek]]s would not exceed 1 m[[Sievert|Sv]] (0.1 [[rem (unit)|rem]]), a dose much lower than that which could induce embryonic abnormalities or other non-[[stochastic]] effects, there was an observed 2500 excess of otherwise wanted pregnancies being terminated, probably out of fear in the mother of some kind of perceived radiation risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1248180 | pmid=3120899 | volume=295 | title=The victims of chernobyl in Greece: induced abortions after the accident | year=1987 | journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) | pages=1100 |vauthors=Trichopoulos D, Zavitsanos X, Koutis C, Drogari P, Proukakis C, Petridou E | doi=10.1136/bmj.295.6606.1100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A "slightly" above the expected number of requested induced abortions occurred in [[Italy]], were upon request, "a week of reflection" and then a 2 to 3 week "health system" delay usually occur before the procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2544742 | pmid=3122957 | volume=296 | title=Induced abortions after the Chernobyl accident | year=1988 | journal=Br Med J (Clin Res Ed) | pages=136 |vauthors=Parazzini F, Repetto F, Formigaro M, Fasoli M, La Vecchia C | doi=10.1136/bmj.296.6615.136-a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2284594 | volume=16 | title=The Chernobyl accident and induced abortions: only one-way information. | date=Dec 1990 | journal=Scand J Work Environ Health | pages=443–4 | doi=10.5271/sjweh.1761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "radiophobia" is also sometimes used in the arguments against proponents of the conservative [[Linear no-threshold model|LNT concept]] (Linear no-threshold response model for ionizing radiation) of radiation security proposed by the U.S. [http://www.ncrponline.org National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements] (NCRP) in 1949. The "no-threshold" position effectively assumes, from data extrapolated from the atomic bombings on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, that even negligible doses of radiation increase ones risk of cancer linearly as the exposure increases from a value of 0 up to high dose rates. This is a controversial model as the LNT model therefore suggests that radiation exposure from naturally occurring [[background radiation]], the radiation exposure from flying at high altitudes in airplanes, as well as lying next to loved ones for extended periods and the eating of [[banana equivalent dose|bananas, which are also weakly naturally radioactive]] (both mostly due to [[Potassium-40]], a [[naturally occurring radioactive material]] required [[composition of the human body|for human life]]) all increase one's chance of cancer.

Moreover, the lack of strong evidence supporting the LNT model, a model created from extrapolation from atomic bomb exposure, and not hard experimental evidence at low doses, has made the model controversial.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} As no irrefutable link between radiation induced negative health effects from low doses, in both human and other [[mammal]] exposure experiments, has been found.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

On the contrary, many very low dose radiation exposure experiments find positive ([[hormetic]]) health effects at low doses of radiation, therefore the conservative LNT model when applied to low dose exposure remains controversial within the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zbigniew Jaworowski]], [http://www.riskworld.com/nreports/1999/jaworowski/NR99aa01.htm Radiation Risk and Ethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051119204629/http://www.riskworld.com/nreports/1999/jaworowski/NR99aa01.htm |date=2005-11-19 }}, Physics Today, 52(9), September 1999, pp. 24-29&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|Fukushima disaster]], the German news magazine ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported that Japanese residents were suffering from radiophobia.&lt;ref name="spiegel.de"/&gt; British medical scientist [[Geraldine Thomas]] has also attributed suffering of the Japanese to radiophobia in interviews and formal presentations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arpsconference.com.au/Presentations/0900%20Thomas%20PANO%20123%20Tue.pdf|title=Minimising the Health Consequences of Nuclear Accidents – Do We Need to Reassess Our Response?|last=Thomas|first=Geraldine|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four years after the event [[The New York Times]] reported that ″about 1,600 people died from the stress of the evacuation″. The forced evacuation of 154,000 people ″was not justified by the relatively moderate radiation levels″, but it was ordered because ″the government basically panicked″.&lt;ref&gt;When Radiation Isn’t the Real Risk, [[The New York Times]], Sept. 21, 2015, by George Johnson. https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/22/science/when-radiation-isnt-the-real-risk.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radiophobia and Industrial and Healthcare Use==
Radiation, most commonly in the form of X-rays, is used frequently in society in order to produce positive outcomes. The primary use of radiation in healthcare is in the use of [[Medical radiography|radiography]] for radiographic examination or procedure, and in the use of [[radiotherapy]] in the treatment of cancerous conditions. Radiophobia can be a fear which patients experience before and after either of these procedures,&lt;ref name="Patient Radiophobia"&gt;{{cite journal | title=We have to calm dose hysteria…RIGHT NOW! | author=Freiherr, G. | journal=Diagnostic Imaging. | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is therefore the responsibility of the healthcare professional at the time, often a [[Radiographer]] or [[Radiation therapist|Radiation Therapist]], to reassure the patients about the [[acute radiation syndrome|stochastic]] and [[chronic radiation syndrome|deterministic]] effects of radiation on human physiology. Advising patients and other irradiated persons of the various [[radiation protection]] measures that are enforced, including the use of lead-rubber aprons, [[dosimetry]] and [[automatic exposure control|Automatic Exposure Control (AEC)]] is a common method of informing and reassuring radiophobia sufferers.

Similarly, in [[industrial radiography]] there is the possibility of persons to experience radiophobia when radiophobia sufferers are near industrial radiographic equipment.

The '''Rajasthan Atomic Power Station''' (RAPS; also ''Rajasthan Atomic Power Project'' - RAPP) is located at [[Rawatbhata]] in the state of [[Rajasthan]], India.

== History ==

The construction of the [[Douglas Point Nuclear Generating Station]] Canada began in 1961 with a [[CANDU]] (CANada Deuterium Uranium) [[pressurised heavy water reactor]] (PHWR) capable of producing 220&amp;nbsp;[[Megawatt|MW]] of electricity. Two years after construction of the Rajasthan Power Project (RAPP) commenced, with two similar reactors built in the state of Rajasthan. Ten years later, in 1973 RAPS-1 was put into service. In 1974 after India conducted [[Smiling Buddha]], its first [[nuclear weapons test]] Canada stopped their support of the project, delaying the commissioning of RAPS-2 until 1981.&lt;ref name=nti&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nti.org/learn/facilities/76/ |title= Rajasthan Atomic Power Station (RAPS) |work= [[Nuclear Threat Initiative]] |date= 2003-09-01 |accessdate= 2017-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the Indian atomic program, two more PHWR with an output of 220&amp;nbsp;MW each were built.  They cost around 570&amp;nbsp;million dollars.  RAPS-3 became critical on 24&amp;nbsp;December 1999, RAPS-4 became critical on 3&amp;nbsp;November 2000.  Commercial operations began on 1&amp;nbsp;June 2000 for unit&amp;nbsp;3, and on 23&amp;nbsp;December 2000 for unit&amp;nbsp;4.

Two more reactors (RAPS-5 and RAPS-6) with 220 MWe have also been built, with unit&amp;nbsp;5 beginning commercial operation on 4&amp;nbsp;February 2010, and unit&amp;nbsp;6 on 31&amp;nbsp;March 2010.&lt;ref name="RAPS"&gt;{{cite web

Two of the new Indian-designed 700 MWe series of reactor (RAPP-7 and RAPP-8) are under construction at Rajasthan.

In November 2012, the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) intensively audited over several weeks two reactors at the Rajasthan Atomic Power Station for safety. It has concluded that the reactors are among the best in the world, the indigenously made 220 MW atomic plants can withstand a Fukushima type of accident, even suggesting that the "safety culture is strong in India" and that India emerged a winner with a high global safety rank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/un-s-nuclear-watchdog-rajasthan-reactors-are-among-world-s-safest-292623 UN's nuclear watchdog: Rajasthan reactors are among world's safest]. NDTV.com (2012-11-15). Retrieved on 2013-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

First concrete for unit&amp;nbsp;7 was poured on 18&amp;nbsp;July 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

with commercial operation expected by 2016. 
The two reactors will cost an estimated Rs&amp;nbsp;123.2&amp;nbsp;billion (US$2.6&amp;nbsp;billion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Incidents ==
By 2003 RAPS-1 had experienced numerous problems due to leaks, cracks in the end-shield and [[turbine blade]] failures, had undergone repairs and appeared to be generating 100&amp;nbsp;MW electricity, with RAPS-2 reportedly generating 200&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref name=nti/&gt;

On 29 August 2006, a 90% iron [[meteorite]] weighing 6.8 kilograms fell in Kanvarpura village, near the power station. The Deputy Director-General (western region) of the [[Geological Survey of India]], R.S. Goyal, said that devastation on an "unimaginable scale" would have ensued had the object struck the station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/meteorite-fall-in-rajasthan-village/article3071137.ece Meteorite fall in Rajasthan village] The Hindu, 2006-09-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, 38 workers were exposed to [[tritium]] when a welding operation went wrong inside the protected environment of the reactor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/radiation-scare-in-rajasthan-workers-exposed-237858?pfrom=home-otherstories Radiation scare in Rajasthan, workers exposed].

'''Rotational Brownian motion''' is the random change in the orientation of a [[polar molecule]] due to collisions with other molecules. It is an important element of theories of [[dielectric]] materials. 

The [[Polarization density|polarization]] of a dielectric material is a competition between [[torque]]s due to the imposed [[electric field]], which tend to align the molecules, and collisions, which tend to destroy the alignment. The theory of rotational Brownian motion allows one to calculate the net result of these two competing effects, and to predict how the [[permittivity]] of a dielectric material depends on the strength and frequency of the imposed electric field.  

Rotational Brownian motion was first discussed by [[Peter Debye]],&lt;ref&gt;Debye, P., ''Berichte der deutschen Physikalischen Gesellschaft'', '''15''', 777 (1913)&lt;/ref&gt; who applied [[Einstein]]'s theory of translational [[Brownian motion]] to the rotation of molecules having permanent [[electric dipole]]s.  Debye ignored inertial effects and assumed that the molecules were spherical, with an intrinsic, fixed [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moment]].  He derived expressions for the [[dielectric relaxation|dielectric relaxation time]] and for the [[Debye relaxation|permittivity]].  These formulae have been successfully applied to many materials.  However, Debye's expression for the permittivity predicts that the absorption tends toward a constant value when the frequency of the applied electric field becomes very large—the "Debye plateau".  This is not observed; instead, the absorption tends toward a maximum and then declines with increasing frequency.

The breakdown in Debye's theory in these regimes can be corrected by including inertial effects; allowing the molecules to be non-spherical; including dipole-dipole interactions between molecules; etc. These are computationally very difficult problems and rotational Brownian motion is a topic of much current research interest.

'''Floating nuclear power stations''' ([[Russian language|Russian]]: плавучая атомная теплоэлектростанция малой мощности, ПАТЭС ММ - lit. floating [[combined heat and power]] (CHP) low-power nuclear station) are vessels designed by [[Rosatom]].
They are self-contained, low-capacity, floating [[nuclear power plant]]s. 
The stations are to be mass-produced at [[shipbuilding]] facilities and then towed to the destination ports of the cities and towns experiencing deficit of power due to industrialization.

The work on such projects dates back to [[MH-1A]] in the United States, which was built in the 1960s into the hull of a World War II [[Liberty Ship]]; however, the Rosatom project is the first floating nuclear power plant intended for mass production. The initial plan was to manufacture at least seven of the vessels by 2015.&lt;ref name="vzglyad"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vz.ru/news/2007/4/15/77501.html |title= Россия построит серию плавучих АЭС (''Russia will build series of floating NPS'') |publisher=Vzglyad |date= 2007-04-15 |language=Russian |accessdate=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Akademik Lomonosov}}
In 2000 the project for a floating power station began when the Ministry for Atomic Energy of the Russian Federation ([[Rosatom]]) chose [[Severodvinsk]] in [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]] as the construction site, [[Sevmash]] was appointed as general contractor.&lt;ref name=sevmash/&gt; 
Construction of the first power station, the ''[[Akademik Lomonosov]]'', started on 15 April 2007 at the Sevmash Submarine-Building Plant in Severodvinsk. 
However, in August 2008 construction works were transferred to the [[Baltic Shipyard]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], which is also responsible for the construction of future vessels.&lt;ref name=wnn110808&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Russia_relocates_construction_of_floating_power_plant-1108084.html |title= Russia relocates construction of floating power plant |work= World Nuclear News |date=2008-08-11 |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Akademik Lomonosov'' was launched on 1 July 2010,&lt;ref name="spt010710"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.times.spb.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=31865 | title= Nuclear Power Vessel Launched | last = Stolyarova | first = Galina | date= 2010-07-01 | newspaper = The St. Petersburg Times | accessdate= 2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a cost of 6 billion rubles (232 m$).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Russia_relocates_construction_of_floating_power_plant-1108084.html&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2015 construction of a second vessel starting in 2019 was announced by Russia’s state nuclear corporation Rosatom.&lt;ref&gt;http://bellona.org/news/nuclear-issues/2015-08-russia-announces-second-floating-nuclear-plant-as-new-problems-plague-its-first&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical characteristics==
The floating nuclear power station is a non-self propelled vessel. 
It has length of {{convert|144.4|m}}, width of {{convert|30|m}}, height of {{convert|10|m}}, and draught of {{convert|5.6|m}}. The vessel has a displacement of 21,500&amp;nbsp;tonnes and a crew of 69&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name=sevmash&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sevmash.ru/?id=2899&amp;lg=en |title= Floating power generating plant of nuclear station of small capacity |work= [[Sevmash]] |accessdate=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wnn050407&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=13196&amp;LangType=2057 |title= Two floating nuclear plants for Chukotka |work= World Nuclear News |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each vessel of this type has two modified [[KLT-40]] [[Nuclear marine propulsion|naval propulsion reactor]]s together providing up to 70&amp;nbsp;MW of electricity or 300&amp;nbsp;MW of heat, or cogeneration of electricity and heat for [[district heating]], enough for a city with a population of 200,000&amp;nbsp;people. It could also be modified as a [[desalination]] plant producing 240,000&amp;nbsp;cubic meters of fresh water a day.&lt;ref name=rian&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rian.ru/review/20060616/49610592.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060620132054/http://www.rian.ru/review/20060616/49610592.html |archivedate=2006-06-20 |script-title=ru:Плавучая АЭС обогнала Америку.

Smaller modification of the plant will be fitted with two ABV-6M reactors with the electrical power around 18&amp;nbsp;MWe (megawatts of electricity).&lt;ref name="wnn301007"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/newsarticle.aspx?id=14306&amp;LangType=2057 |title= Floating a nuclear power plant in Yakutia |work= World Nuclear News |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contractors==
The hull and sections of vessels are to be built by the [[Baltic Shipyard]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Reactors are designed by [[OKBM Afrikantov]] and assembled by Nizhniy Novgorod Research and Development Institute Atomenergoproekt (both part of [[Atomenergoprom]]).&lt;ref name=sevmash/&gt;&lt;ref name=wnn110808/&gt;&lt;ref name="wnn-0708094"/&gt; The reactor vessels are produced by [[Izhorskiye Zavody]].&lt;ref name="wnn-0708094"&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Reactors_ready_for_first_floating_plant-0708094.html | title= Reactors ready for floating plant | date= 2009-08-07 | work= World Nuclear News | accessdate= 2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Kaluga Turbine Plant]] supplies the turbo-generators.&lt;ref name=sevmash/&gt;&lt;ref name=wnn110808/&gt;

==Fueling==
The floating power stations need to be refueled every three years while saving up to 200,000&amp;nbsp;metric tons of coal and 100,000&amp;nbsp;tons of fuel oil a year. The reactors are supposed to have a lifespan of 40&amp;nbsp;years. Every 12&amp;nbsp;years, the whole plant will be towed home and overhauled at the wharf where it was constructed. The manufacturer will arrange for the disposal of the nuclear waste and maintenance is provided by the infrastructure of the Russian nuclear industry. Thus, virtually no radiation traces are expected at the place where the power station produced its energy.&lt;ref name=rian/&gt;&lt;ref name=mn/&gt;

==Safety==
Environmental groups are concerned that floating plants will be more vulnerable to accidents and terrorism than land-based stations. They point to a history of naval and nuclear accidents in Russia and the former Soviet Union, including the [[Chernobyl disaster]] of 1986.&lt;ref name=float&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1662889.ece |title=Floating nuclear power stations raise spectre of Chernobyl at sea | newspaper =The Times |date=April 17, 2007 |accessdate=2008-11-08 | location=London | first=Tony | last=Halpin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Russia does have 50 years of experience operating a fleet of [[nuclear-powered icebreaker]]s that are also used for scientific and Arctic tourism expeditions. The Russians have commented that a [[list of sunken nuclear submarines|nuclear reactor that sinks]], such as the similar reactor on the submarine in the [[Kursk submarine disaster]], can be raised and probably put back into operation.&lt;ref name=float/&gt;

==Locations==
Floating nuclear power stations are planned to be used mainly in the Russian [[Arctic]]. Five of these will be used by [[Gazprom]] for offshore oil and gas field development and for operations on the [[Kola Peninsula|Kola]] and [[Yamal Peninsula|Yamal]] peninsulas.&lt;ref name=wnn110808/&gt; Other locations include [[Dudinka]] on the [[Taymyr Peninsula]], [[Vilyuchinsk]] on the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] and [[Pevek]] on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]].&lt;ref name=rian/&gt; In 2007, Rosatom signed an agreement with the [[Sakha Republic]] to build a floating plant for its northern parts, using smaller ABV reactors.&lt;ref name=wnn110808/&gt;

According to Rosatom, 15 countries, including China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Algeria, Namibia, Cape Verde and Argentina, have shown interest in hiring such a device.&lt;ref name=vzglyad/&gt;&lt;ref name=wnn110808/&gt; It has been estimated that 75% of the world’s population live within 100 miles of a port city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1168">'''Snedding''' is the process of stripping the side shoots and buds from the length of a branch or shoot, usually of a tree or woody shrub. This process is most commonly performed during [[hedge laying]] and prior to the [[felling]] of trees on plantations ready for cropping.

The verb, "to sned", analogous to today's [[limbing]], was also used by woodcutters in Scotland to refer to the process of removing branches from felled trees. Whether using an [[axe]], a [[chainsaw]] or a [[billhook]], the relative difficulty of snedding was a key measure of the difficulty of the job as a whole.

The word comes from the Scandinavian ''snäddare'', meaning a smooth log via the Old English "snaedan".&lt;ref&gt;Websters English Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

Snedding can also describe a form of [[pruning]] when only some shoots will be removed, or when removing the leafy top from root crops (particularly turnips).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38390">'''Spinodal decomposition''' is a mechanism for the rapid unmixing of a mixture of liquids or solids
&lt;ref name="gold"&gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/index.html IUPAC Gold book], [http://goldbook.iupac.org/S05869.html Spinodal decomposition entry].&lt;/ref&gt; from one [[Phase (matter)|thermodynamic phase]] to form two coexisting phases. As an example, consider a hot mixture of water and an oil. At high temperatures the oil and the water may mix to form a single thermodynamic phase in which water molecules are surrounded by oil molecules and vice versa. The mixture is then suddenly cooled to a temperature at which thermodynamic equilibrium favours an oil-rich phase coexisting with a water-rich phase. Spinodal decomposition then occurs when the mixture is such that there is essentially no barrier to nucleation of the new oil-rich and water-rich phases. In other words, the oil and water molecules immediately start to cluster together into microscopic water-rich and oil-rich clusters throughout the liquid. These clusters then rapidly grow and coalesce until there is a single macroscopic oil-rich cluster, the oil-rich phase, and a single water-rich cluster, the water-rich phase.

Spinodal decomposition can be contrasted with [[Nucleation|nucleation]] and growth. There the initial formation of the microscopic clusters involves a large free energy barrier, and so can be very slow, and may occur as little as once in the initial phase, not throughout the phase, as happens in spinodal decomposition.

Spinodal decomposition is of interest for two primary reasons. In the first place, it is one of the few [[phase transition]] [[phase transformations in solids|in solids]] for which there is a complete quantitative theory.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}  The reason for this is the inherent simplicity of the reaction. Since there is no [[thermodynamic]] barrier to the reaction inside of the spinodal region, the decomposition is determined solely by [[diffusion]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Thus, it can be treated purely as a diffusional problem, and many of the characteristics of the decomposition can be described by an approximate analytical solution to the general diffusion equation.

In contrast, theories of [[nucleation]] and growth have to invoke the thermodynamics of fluctuations.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} The diffusional problem involved in the growth of the nucleus is far more difficult to solve because it is unrealistic to linearize the diffusion equation.

From a more practical standpoint, spinodal decomposition provides a means of producing a very finely dispersed microstructure that can significantly enhance the physical properties of the material.

== Early evidence ==

In the early 1940s, Bradley reported the observation of sidebands around the Bragg peaks of the X-ray diffraction pattern from a Cu-Ni-Fe alloy that had been quenched and then annealed inside the [[miscibility gap]]. Further observations on the same alloy were made by Daniel and Lipson, who demonstrated that the sidebands could be explained by a periodic modulation of composition in the &lt;100&gt; directions. From the spacing of the sidebands, they were able to determine the wavelength of the modulation, which was of the order of 100 angstroms.

The growth of a composition modulation in an initially homogeneous alloy implies uphill diffusion, or a negative diffusion coefficient. Becker and Dehlinger had already predicted a negative diffusivity inside the spinodal region of a binary system. But their treatments could not account for the growth of a modulation of a particular wavelength, such as was observed in the Cu-Ni-Fe alloy. In fact, any model based on [[Fick's law]] yields a physically unacceptable solution when the diffusion coefficient is negative.

The first explanation of the periodicity was given by [[Mats Hillert]] in his 1955 Doctoral Dissertation at [[MIT]]. Starting with a regular solution model, he derived a flux equation for one-dimensional diffusion on a discrete lattice. This equation differed from the usual one by the inclusion of a term which allowed for the effect on the driving force of the interfacial energy between adjacent interatomic planes that differed in composition. Hillert solved the flux equation numerically and found that inside the spinodal it yielded a periodic variation of composition with distance. Furthermore, the wavelength of the modulation was of the same order as that observed in the Cu-Ni-Fe alloys.
&lt;ref name="M"&gt;Hillert, M., ''A Theory of Nucleation for Solid Metallic Solutions'', Sc. D. Thesis (MIT, 1955)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name="H"&gt;Hillert, M., ''A Solid Solution Model for Inhomogeneous Systems'', Acta Met., Vol. 9, p. 525 (1961)&lt;/ref&gt;

Building on Hillert's work, a more flexible continuum model was subsequently developed by [[John W. Cahn]] and John Hilliard, who included the effects of coherency strains as well as the gradient energy term. The strains are significant in that they dictate the ultimate morphology of the decomposition in anisotropic materials.

== Gibbs criteria ==
A [[Metastability|metastable]] phase lies at a local but not global minimum in [[Thermodynamic free energy|free energy]], and is resistant to small fluctuations. [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|J. Willard Gibbs]] described two criteria for a metastable phase: that it must remain stable against a small change over a large area, and that it must remain stable against a large change over a small area.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbs, J.W., ''Scientific Papers of J Willard Gibbs'', 2 vols. Bumstead, H. A., and Van Name, R. G., eds. (Dover, New York, 1961) {{ISBN|0-918024-77-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gradient energy ==
Gradient energies associated with even the smallest of compositional fluctuations can be evaluated using an approximation introduced by [[Vitaly Ginzburg|Ginzburg]] and [[Lev Landau|Landau]]   in order to describe magnetic field gradients in superconductors. This approach allows one to approximate the
energy associated with a concentration gradient &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;'''C'''. Thus, as a result of series expansions with respect to ( c – c&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; ), this energy can be expressed in the form κ(&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;'''C''')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg, V.L. and Landau, L.D., J .Exptl. Theoret. Phys. (USSR), Vol. 20, p. 1064 (1950)&lt;/ref&gt;

*Note: In a three-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; with coordinates ( ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' ), [[del]] is defined in terms of [[partial derivative]] operators as

:&lt;math&gt;\nabla = \mathbf{\hat{x}}{\partial \over \partial x} + \mathbf{\hat{y}}{\partial \over \partial y} + \mathbf{\hat{z}}{\partial \over \partial z}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\{\mathbf{\hat{x}}, \mathbf{\hat{y}},\mathbf{\hat{z}} \} &lt;/math&gt; are the [[unit vectors]] in the respective coordinate directions.

The vector derivative of a [[scalar field]] ''f'' is called the [[gradient]], and it can be represented as:

: &lt;math&gt;\mbox{grad}\,c = {\partial c \over \partial x} \mathbf{\hat{x}} + {\partial c \over \partial y} \mathbf{\hat{y}} + {\partial c \over \partial z} \mathbf{\hat{z}} = \nabla c.&lt;/math&gt;

Cahn &amp; Hilliard used such an approximation to evaluate the free energy of a small volume of non-uniform isotropic solid solution as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;dF = N_v [ F_0 + k( \nabla c)^2 ]~dV&lt;/math&gt;

or:

:&lt;math&gt;F = \int_v [ F_0 + k( \nabla c)^2 ]~dV&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;N_v&lt;/math&gt;  =  particle density (#/vol)
:&lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt; is the free energy of the homogeneous solution.

The κ(&lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;'''C''')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
term, is a measure of the free energy of a composition gradient and is strongly dependent on local composition. (The constant κ is related to derivatives of the free energy with respect to composition.) The interfacial energy associated with this compositional gradient therefore increases with the square of &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;'''C'''.
&lt;ref name="JW"&gt;Cahn, J.W. and Hilliard, J.E., ''Free Energy of a Nonuniform System. I. Interfacial Free Energy'', J. Chem. Phys., Vol. 28, p. 258 (1958)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Cahn, J.W. and Hilliard, J.E., ''Free Energy of a Nonuniform System. III. Nucleation in a Two-Component Incompressible Fluid'',
J. Chem. Phys., Vol. 31, p. 688 (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;

Since we shall be concerned with testing the stability of an initially homogeneous solution to infinitesimal composition (or density) fluctuations, the gradients will also be infinitesimal and the second term will be completely sufficient to describe the contribution from the incipient 'surfaces" (between regions differing in composition). Higher order gradient energy terms
will be negligible, except at very large gradients. We may also expand ''f'' (c) about the average composition c&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;
 f( c ) = f( c_o )
     + \left( c - c_o \right) \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial c} \right)_{c\,=\,c_o}
     + \frac12\, \left( c - c_o \right)^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial c^2} \right)_{c\,=\,c_o}.
&lt;/math&gt;

The difference in free energy per unit volume (or free energy density) between the initial homogeneous solution and one with a composition given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( c - c_o \right) = A\; \cos\, \beta x \,&lt;/math&gt;

is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\Delta F}{V} = \left( \frac{A^2}{4} \right) \left[ \left( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial c^2} \right) + 2\, \kappa\, \beta^2 \right].&lt;/math&gt;

Note that both terms are quadratic in the amplitude, so the stability criterion is initially independent of amplitude.

Thus, ''ΔF'' is positive if the second derivative of the free energy with respect to composition (hereafter referred to as ''f'''' ) is positive, because the contribution of the surface energy
in the second term is always positive. In this case, the system is stable against all infinitesimal fluctuations in composition since the formation of such fluctuations would result in an increase in the free energy of the system.

In contrast, if ''f'''' is negative, then ''ΔF'' is negative when:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( c - c_o \right)^2\, \left( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial c^2} \right) &gt; 2 \kappa \left(\nabla c\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

The formation of fluctuations can therefore be accompanied by a decrease in the free energy of the system within this region provided the scale or wavelength of the fluctuation is large enough. Within this context, such gradual changes in composition maintain small values for the gradient term &lt;math&gt;\nabla&lt;/math&gt;'''C'''.

== Fourier components ==
Cahn and Hilliard formulated a theory for the amplification (or attenuation) of an arbitrary composition fluctuation by considering, with Debye, the Fourier components of the composition rather than the composition itself. Thus, for a concentration fluctuation:

:&lt;math&gt;\left( c - c_o \right) = A\, \cos\, \beta x&lt;/math&gt;

one obtains for the change in free energy on forming fluctuations:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta F}{V} = \left( \frac{A^2}{4} \right) \left(f'' + 2\, \kappa\, \beta^{2} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

The ''solution is then unstable'' (''ΔF'' &lt; 0) for all fluctuations of wave number ''β'' smaller than a critical wave number ''β&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta_c = \sqrt{ \frac{f''}{2 \kappa} }&lt;/math&gt;

or ''for all fluctuations of wavelength λ = 2π/β which are longer than a critical wavelength'' given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_c = \sqrt{ \frac{8 \pi^2 \kappa}{f''} }.&lt;/math&gt;

From these equations, it is seen that the incipient surface energy, reflected in the gradient energy term, prevents the solution from decomposing on too small a scale. This concept was first introduced by Hillert, and shows that as the spinodal is approached, the critical wavelength approaches infinity.
&lt;ref name="JW"/&gt;

== Phase diagram ==
This type of phase transformation is known as '''spinodal decomposition''', and can be illustrated on a phase diagram exhibiting a miscibility gap. Thus, phase separation occurs whenever a material transitions into the unstable region of the phase diagram. The boundary of the unstable region, sometimes referred to as the binodal or coexistence curve, is found by performing a common tangent construction of the free-energy diagram. Inside the binodal is a region called the spinodal, which is found by determining where the curvature of the free-energy curve is negative. The binodal and spinodal meet at the critical point. It is when a material is moved into the spinodal region of the phase diagram that spinodal decomposition can occur.
&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;{{Cite book|last = Jones|first = Richard A. L.|title = Soft Condensed Matter|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Hl_HBPUvoNsC|accessdate = 2007-10-22|publisher = Oxford University Press|isbn = 978-0-19-850589-1|pages = 33|year = 2004|origyear = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The free energy curve is plotted as a function of composition for a temperature below the convolute temperature, T. Equilibrium phase compositions are those corresponding to the free energy minima. Regions of negative curvature (∂&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;f/∂c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 0 ) lie within the inflection points of the curve (∂&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;f/∂c&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0 ) which are called the spinodes. Their locus as a function of temperature defines the spinodal curve. For compositions within the spinodal, a homogeneous solution is unstable against infinitesimal fluctuations in density or composition, and there is no thermodynamic barrier to the growth of a new phase. Thus, the spinodal represents the limit of physical and chemical stability.

To reach the spinodal region of the phase diagram, a transition must take the material through the binodal region or the critical point. Often phase separation will occur via nucleation during this transition, and spinodal decomposition will not be observed. To observe spinodal decomposition, a very fast transition, often called a ''quench'', is required to move from the stable to the spinodally unstable region of the phase diagram.

In some systems, [[Order (crystal lattice)|ordering]] of the material leads to a compositional instability and this is known as a ''conditional spinodal'', e.g. in the [[feldspar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Cook, H.E., ''A lattice model of structural and dislocation transformations'', Acta Met, Vol. 21, p. 1431 (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cook, H.E., ''On the nature of the omega transformation'',

== Diffusion equation ==

The mathematical theory of spinodal decomposition is based largely on the development of a generalized [[diffusion]] equation.
&lt;ref name=HILL&gt;
Hilliard, J.E., '''Spinodal Decomposition''', in '''Phase Transformations''' p.&amp;nbsp;497 (American Society of Metals, Metals Park, 1970)
&lt;/ref&gt;
A diffusion equation relates a spontaneous flux of material to a gradient in composition. Fundamental thermodynamic principles dictate that in order for the flux to be spontaneous, it must be associated with a net decrease in the free energy of the system. Consider the following diffusion equation relating the flux of two species ( J&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and J&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; ) to the gradient of the chemical potential difference:

:&lt;math&gt; - \tilde J = M \nabla (\mu_a - \mu_b) &lt;/math&gt;

As pointed out by Cahn, this equation can be considered as a phenomenological definition of the mobility M, which must by definition be positive.
&lt;ref name=CAHN&gt;
Cahn, J.W., '''Spinodal Decomposition''', 1967 '''Institute of Metals Lecture''', Trans. Met. Soc. AIME, Vol. 242, p.&amp;nbsp;168 (1968)
&lt;/ref&gt;
It consists of the ratio of the flux to the local gradient in chemical potential.

The quantity ( ''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; - μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) is the change in free energy when we reversibly add a unit amount of A atoms ( ΔF = + ''μ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;'' ) and simultaneously remove an equal number of B atoms ( ΔF = - ''μ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;'' ). This term may include factors such as composition, compositional gradients, stresses, and magnetic fields. For a homogeneous system:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu_a - \mu_b = \frac{\partial f}{\partial c}&lt;/math&gt;

The quantity ''f'' is the free energy of that number of lattice points in the crystal which initially occupied a unit volume. Substituting,

:&lt;math&gt;-J_a = M \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial c^2} \nabla c &lt;/math&gt;

and defining the interdiffusion coefficient ''D'' by:

:&lt;math&gt; -\tilde J = - J_a = D \nabla c &lt;/math&gt;

We can then define the interdiffusion coefficient ''D'' as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; D = M \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial c^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Note that since M must always be positive, ''D'' takes its sign from the sign of f", which is negative within the spinodal. This has often been referred to as "uphill diffusion".

The above derivation of the diffusion coefficient is valid for concentration gradients that are so small that, for all practical purposes, each atom finds itself in surroundings which are similar to that which it would have in a homogeneous material of identical composition. If, however, concentration gradients are so large that within the range of interaction of an atom the average concentration has changed appreciably, then the atom will be aware of its inhomogeneous environment. This leads to a change in its chemical potential, and for fluids:

:&lt;math&gt;( \mu_a - \mu_b ) =\frac{\partial f}{\partial c} - 2 K \nabla^2 c &lt;/math&gt;

Substitution yields:

:&lt;math&gt; - \tilde J = M \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial c^2} \nabla c - 2 M K \nabla^3 c &lt;/math&gt;

By taking the divergence, we obtain the new diffusion equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial c} { \partial t} = M \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial c^2} \nabla^2 c - 2 M k \nabla^4 c &lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, since:

:&lt;math&gt; N_v (\mu_2 - \mu_1) = \frac {df}{dc} &lt;/math&gt;

the flux equation can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; J = -M \left( \frac{d}{dx} \right) \frac{df}{dc}&lt;/math&gt;

For a system in equilibrium, the chemical potentials, and hence their difference, are constant throughout the system. Thus this equation for the flux satisfies the physical requirement that the net flux should go to zero as equilibrium is approached. For the time dependence of the composition we obtain on differentiation:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = - \left( \frac{1}{N_v} \right) \left( \frac{\partial J}{\partial x} \right) = \left( \frac{M}{N_v} \right) f'' \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial x^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing this equation with the usual statement of Fick's second law

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial c}{\partial t} = D \left( \frac{\partial^2 c}{\partial x^2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

it is seen that the mobility is related to the interdiffusion coefficient by the following:

:&lt;math&gt; M = \frac{D N_v}{f''} &lt;/math&gt;

It then follows from the solution to be described next that a particular solution to this new diffusion equation is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; c -c_0 = A(\beta,t) \exp \left[i\beta x \right] &lt;/math&gt;

in which c&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; is the average composition and ''A(β,t)'' is the amplitude of the Fourier component of wavenumber β at time t. In terms of the initial amplitude at time zero:

:&lt;math&gt; A(\beta , t ) = A(\beta , 0 ) \exp \left[ R(\beta)t \right]&lt;/math&gt;

where ''R(β)'' is an amplification factor given by:

:&lt;math&gt;R(\beta) = - \frac{M}{N} \beta^2 f''&lt;/math&gt;

== Coherency strains ==

For most crystalline solid solutions, there is a variation of lattice parameter with composition. If the lattice of such a solution is to remain coherent in the presence of a composition modulation, mechanical work has to be done in order to strain the rigid lattice structure. The maintenance of coherency thus affects the driving force for diffusion.
&lt;ref name=CAHN/&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
De Fontaine, D., ''An approximate criterion for the loss of coherency in modulated structures'', Acta Met., Vol. 17, p. 477 (1969)
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
Cook, H.E., De Fontaine, D., Hilliard, J.E., ''A model for diffusion on cubic lattices and its application to the early stages of ordering'', Acta Met., Vol. 17, p. 765 (1969)
&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;
Cook, H.E. and De Fontaine, D., ''On the elastic free energy of solid solutions I. Microscopic theory'', Acta Met., Vol. 17, p. 915 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider a crystalline solid containing a one-dimensional composition modulation along the x-direction. We calculate the elastic strain energy for a cubic crystal by estimating the work required to deform a slice of material so that it can be added coherently to an existing slab of cross-sectional area. We will assume that the composition modulation is along the x' direction and, as indicated, a prime will be used to distinguish the reference axes from the standard axes of a cubic system (that is, along the &lt;100&gt;).
&lt;ref name=HILL/&gt;

Let the lattice spacing in the plane of the slab be ''a&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' and that of the undeformed slice ''a''. If the slice is to be coherent after addition of the slab, it must be subjected to a strain ε in the '' z' '' and '' y' '' directions which is given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon = \frac{ a - a_0}{a_0} &lt;/math&gt;

In the first step, the slice is deformed hydrostatically in order to produce the required strains to the '' z' '' and '' y' '' directions. We use the linear compressibility of a cubic system 1 / ( c&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 c&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; ) where the c's are the elastic constants. The stresses required to produce a hydrostatic strain of δ are therefore given by:

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma_{x'} = \sigma_{y'} = \sigma_{z'} &lt;/math&gt;

The elastic work per unit volume is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;W_E = \frac{1}{2} \displaystyle \sum_i \sigma_i\epsilon_i &lt;/math&gt;

where the ε's are the strains. The work performed per unit volume of the slice during the first step is therefore given by:

:&lt;math&gt;W_E(1) = \frac{3}{2} ( c_{11} + 2 c_{12} ) \epsilon^2&lt;/math&gt;

In the second step, the sides of the slice parallel to the x' direction are clamped and the stress in this direction is relaxed reversibly. Thus, ε&lt;sub&gt;z'&lt;/sub&gt; = ε&lt;sub&gt;y'&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. The result is that:

:&lt;math&gt; W_E(2) = \frac{\epsilon^2 (c_{11} + 2 c_{22})}{2c_{11}}&lt;/math&gt;

The net work performed on the slice in order to achieve coherency is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;W_E = W_E(1) - W_E(2) &lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;W_E = \left( \frac{\epsilon^2}{2} \right) (c_{11} + 2c_{12} ) \left( 3 - \left[ \frac{c_{11} - 2c_{12}}{c_{1'1'}} \right] \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The final step is to express c&lt;sub&gt;1'1'&lt;/sub&gt; in terms of the constants referred to the standard axes. From the rotation of axes, we obtain the following:

:&lt;math&gt;c_{1'1'} = c_{11} + 2(2c_{44} - c_{11} + c_{12}) (l^2m^2 + m^2n^2 + l^2n^2)&lt;/math&gt;

where l, m, n are the direction cosines of the x' axis and, therefore the direction cosines of the composition modulation. Combining these, we obtain the following:

:&lt;math&gt;W_E = Y \epsilon^2 &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; Y = \frac{1}{2} (c_{11} + 2c_{12}) \left[ 3 - \frac{c_{11} + 2c_{12}}{c_{11} + 2(2c_{44} - c_{11} + c_{12})(l^2m^2 + m^2n^2 + l^2n^2)} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

The existence of any shear strain has not been accounted for. Cahn considered this problem, and concluded that shear would be absent for modulations along &lt;100&gt;, &lt;110&gt;, &lt;111&gt; and that for other directions the effect of shear strains would be small. It then follows that the total elastic strain energy of a slab of cross-sectional area A is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;W_E = 4 \int Y \epsilon^2~dx &lt;/math&gt;

We next have to relate the strain δ to the composition variation. Let a&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; be the lattice parameter of the unstrained solid of the average composition c&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. Using a Taylor's series expansion about c&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; yields the following:

:&lt;math&gt;a = a_0[ 1 + \eta [c-c_0 ] + \cdots ] &lt;/math&gt;

in which

:&lt;math&gt;\eta = \left( \frac{1}{a_0} \right) \left(\frac{da}{dc}\right) + \frac{d \ln a}{dc}&lt;/math&gt;

where the derivatives are evaluated at c&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus, neglecting higher order terms, we have:

:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon = \frac{a-a_0}{a_0} = \eta ( c- c_0) &lt;/math&gt;

Substituting, we obtain:

:&lt;math&gt; W_E = A \int \eta^2 Y (c -c_0)^2~dx &lt;/math&gt;

This simple result indicates that the strain energy of a composition modulation depends only on the amplitude and is independent of the wavelength. For a given amplitude, the strain energy W&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; is proportional to Y. Let us consider a few special cases.

For an isotropic material:

:&lt;math&gt; 2c_{44} -c_{11} + c_{12} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

so that:

:&lt;math&gt;Y[\mathrm{iso}] = c_{11} + c_{12} -2 (\frac{c_{12}^2}{c_{11}})&lt;/math&gt;

Ths equation can also be written in terms of Young's modulus E and Poissons's ratio υ using the standard relationships:

:&lt;math&gt;c_{11} = \frac{ E (1-\nu)}{(1-2 \nu)(1 + \nu)} &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_{12} = \frac { E \nu} {(1-2 \nu)(1+\nu)}&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting, we obtain the following:

:&lt;math&gt;Y[\mathrm{iso} ] = \frac{E}{1-\nu} &lt;/math&gt;

For most metals, the left hand side of this equation

:&lt;math&gt;2c_{44} - c_{11} + c_{12} &lt;/math&gt;

is positive, so that the elastic energy will be a minimum for those directions that minimize the term: l&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + l&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. By inspection, those are seen to be &lt;100&gt;. For this case:

:&lt;math&gt;Y[\mathrm{100}] = c_{11} + c_{12} -2 \left( \frac{c_{12}^2}{c_{11}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

the same as for an isotropic material. At least one metal (molybdenum) has an anisotropy of opposite sign. In this case, the directions for minimum W&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; will be those that maximize the directional cosine function. These directions are &lt;111&gt;, and

:&lt;math&gt;Y[\mathrm{111}] = \frac{ 6c_{44} ( c_{11} + 2c_{12} )}{c_{11} + 2c_{12} + 4c_{44}} &lt;/math&gt;

As we will see, the growth rate of the modulations will be a maximum in the directions that minimize Y. These directions therefore determine the morphology and structural characteristics of the decomposition in cubic solid solutions.

Rewriting the diffusion equation and including the term derived for the elastic energy yields the following:

:&lt;math&gt;F_t = A \int f(c) + \eta Y (c-c_0)^2 + K\left(\frac{dc}{dx}\right)^2~dx&lt;/math&gt;

or

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial c} {\partial t} = \left( \frac{M}{N_\nu}\right) \left( [ f'' + 2 \eta Y ] \left(\frac{d^2 c}{dx^2}\right) - 2K\left(\frac{d^4c}{dx^4}\right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;

which can alternatively be written in terms of the diffusion coefficient D as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial c} {\partial t} = \left( \left[ 1 + \frac{ 2\eta Y}{f''} \right] \frac{d^2 c}{dx^2} - \frac{2KF}{f''} \frac{d^4c}{dx^4} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

The simplest way of solving this equation is by using the method of Fourier transforms.

== Fourier transform ==

The motivation for the Fourier transform comes from the study of a [[Fourier series]]. In the study of a Fourier series, complicated periodic functions are written as the sum of simple waves mathematically represented by [[sine]]s and [[cosine]]s. Due to the properties of sine and cosine it is possible to recover the amount of each wave in the sum by an integral. In many cases it is desirable to use [[Euler's formula]], which states that ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2''πiθ''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;cos&amp;nbsp;2''πθ''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''i''&amp;nbsp;sin&amp;nbsp;2''πθ'', to write Fourier series in terms of the basic waves ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2''πiθ''&lt;/sup&gt;, with the distinct advantage of simplifying many unwieldy formulas.

The passage from sines and cosines to [[complex exponentials]] makes it necessary for the Fourier coefficients to be complex valued. The usual interpretation of this complex number is that it gives you both the [[amplitude]] (or size) of the wave present in the function and the [[phase (waves)|phase]] (or the initial angle) of the wave. This passage also introduces the need for negative "frequencies". (E.G. If θ were measured in seconds then the waves ''e''&lt;sup&gt;2''πiθ''&lt;/sup&gt; and ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−2''πiθ''&lt;/sup&gt; would both complete one cycle per second—but they represent different frequencies in the Fourier transform. Hence, frequency no longer measures the number of cycles per unit time, but is closely related.)

If A(β) is the amplitude of a Fourier component of wavelength λ and wavenumber β = 2π/λ the spatial variation in composition can be expressed by the Fourier integral:
&lt;ref name=CAHN/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c - c_0  = \int A(\beta) \exp (i \beta x)~d\beta &lt;/math&gt;

in which the coefficients are defined by the inverse relationship:

:&lt;math&gt;A(\beta) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int (c-c_0) \exp(-i\beta x) ~dx&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting, we obtain on equating coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dA(\beta)}{dt} = - \frac{M}{N_\nu} [ f'' + 2 \eta^2Y + 2Y\beta^2 ] \beta^2 A(\beta) &lt;/math&gt;

This is an ordinary differential equation that has the solution:

:&lt;math&gt;A(\beta,t) = A(\beta,0) \exp[ R(\beta) t] &lt;/math&gt;

in which ''A(β)'' is the initial amplitude of the Fourier component of wave wavenumber β and ''R(β)'' defined by:

:&lt;math&gt; R(\beta) = - \frac{M}{N_\nu} (f '' + 2\eta Y + 2k\beta^2)\beta^2&lt;/math&gt;

or, expressed in terms of the diffusion coefficient D:

:&lt;math&gt; R(\beta) = -\tilde{D} \left(1 + \frac{2\eta^2 Y}{f''} + \frac{2K}{f''}\beta^2 \right) \beta^2&lt;/math&gt;

In a similar manner, the new diffusion equation:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial c }{ \partial t} = M \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial c^2} \nabla^2 c - 2MK\nabla^4 c) &lt;/math&gt;

has a simple sine wave solution given by:

:&lt;math&gt;c - c_0 = exp[R\bar{\beta}t] cos\beta \cdot r &lt;/math&gt;

where R(β) is obtained by substituting this solution back into the diffusion equation as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;R(\bar{\beta}) - M\beta^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial c^2} + 2 K \beta^2 \right) &lt;/math&gt;

For solids, the elastic strains resulting from (in)coherency add terms to the amplification factor R(β) as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; R(\bar{\beta}) = - M\beta^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 f}{\partial c^2} + 2\eta^2 Y + 2K\beta^2 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

where, for isotropic solids:

:&lt;math&gt;Y = \frac{E}{1-\nu} &lt;/math&gt;,

where E is Young's modulus of elasticity, υ is Poisson's ratio, and η is the linear strain per unit composition difference. For anisotropic solids, the elastic term depends on direction in a manner which can be predicted by elastic constants and how the lattice parameters vary with composition. For the cubic case, Y is a minimum for either (100) or (111) directions, depending only on the sign of the elastic anisotropy.

Thus, by describing any composition fluctuation in terms of its Fourier components, Cahn showed that a solution would be unstable with respect to sinusoidal fluctuations of a critical wavelength. By relating the elastic strain energy to the amplitudes of such fluctuations, he formalized the wavelength or frequency dependence of the growth of such fluctuations, and thus introduced the principle of selective amplification of Fourier components of certain wavelengths. The treatment yields the expected mean particle size or wavelength of the most rapidly growing fluctuation.

Thus, the amplitude of composition fluctuations should grow continuously until a metastable equilibrium is reached with a preferential amplification of components of particular wavelengths. The kinetic amplification factor ''R'' is negative when the solution is stable to the fluctuation, zero at the critical wavelength, and positive for longer wavelengths—exhibiting a maximum at exactly &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; times the critical wavelength.

Consider a homogeneous solution within the spinodal. It will initially have a certain amount of fluctuation from the average composition which may be written as a Fourier integral. Each Fourier component of that fluctuation will grow or diminish according to its wavelength.

Because of the maximum in ''R'' as a function of wavelength, those components of the fluctuation with &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; times the critical wavelength will grow fastest and will dominate. This "principle of selective amplification" depends on the initial presence of these wavelengths but does not critically depend on their exact amplitude relative to other wavelengths (if the time is large compared with (1/R). It does not depend on any additional assumptions, since different wavelengths can coexist and do not interfere with one another.

Limitations of this theory would appear to arise from this assumption and the absence of an expression formulated to account for irreversible processes during phase separation which may be associated with internal friction and entropy production. In practice, frictional damping is generally present and some of the energy is transformed into thermal energy. Thus, the amplitude and intensity of a one-dimensional wave decreases with distance from the source, and for a three-dimensional wave the decrease will be greater.

==Dynamics in k-space==
In the spinodal region of the phase diagram, the free-energy can be lowered by allowing the components to separate, thus increasing the relative concentration of a component material in a particular region of the material. The concentration will continue to increase until the material reaches the stable part of the phase diagram. Very large regions of material will change their concentration slowly due to the amount of material which must be moved. Very small regions will shrink away due to the energy cost in maintaining an interface between two dissimilar component materials.

To initiate a homogeneous quench a control parameter, such as temperature, is abruptly and globally changed. For a binary mixture of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-type and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;-type materials, the [[Landau theory|Landau free-energy]]

:&lt;math&gt;F=\int\!\left(\frac{A}{2}\phi^2+\frac{B}{4}\phi^4 + \frac{\kappa}{2}\left(\nabla\phi\right)^2\right)~dx\;.&lt;/math&gt;

is a good approximation of the free-energy near the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]] and is often used to study homogeneous quenches. The mixture concentration &lt;math&gt;\phi=\rho_A-\rho_B&lt;/math&gt; is the density difference of the mixture components, the control parameters which determine the stability of the mixture are &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, and the interfacial energy cost is determined by &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;.

Diffusive motion often dominates at the length-scale of spinodal decomposition. The equation of motion for a diffusive system is

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t\phi=\nabla ( m\nabla\mu + \xi(x) )\;,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusive mobility, &lt;math&gt;\xi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is some random noise such that &lt;math&gt;\langle\xi(x)\rangle=0&lt;/math&gt;, and the chemical potential &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is derived from the Landau free-energy:

:&lt;math&gt;\mu=\frac{\delta F}{\delta \phi}=A\phi+B\phi^3-\kappa \nabla^2 \phi\;.&lt;/math&gt;

We see that if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;, small fluctuations around &lt;math&gt;\phi=0&lt;/math&gt; have a negative effective diffusive mobility and will grow rather than shrink. To understand the growth dynamics, we disregard the fluctuating currents due to &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, [[Linearization|linearize]] the equation of motion around &lt;math&gt;\phi=\phi_{in}&lt;/math&gt; and perform a [[Fourier transform]] into &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-space. This leads to

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t\tilde{\phi}(k,t)=-m((A + 3B\phi_{in}^2)k^2 + \kappa k^4)\tilde{\phi}(k,t)=R(k)\tilde{\phi}(k,t)\;,&lt;/math&gt;

which has an [[exponential growth]] solution:

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}(k,t) = \exp(R(k)t)\;.&lt;/math&gt;

Since the growth rate &lt;math&gt;R(k)&lt;/math&gt; is exponential, the fastest growing angular wavenumber

:&lt;math&gt;k_{sp} = \sqrt{\frac{-(A+3B\phi_{in}^2)}{2\kappa}}\;,&lt;/math&gt;

will quickly dominate the morphology. We now see that spinodal decomposition results in domains of the characteristic length scale called the ''spinodal length'':

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_{sp} = \frac{2\pi}{k_{sp}} = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{2\kappa}{-(A+3B\phi_{in}^2)}}\;.&lt;/math&gt;

The growth rate of the fastest growing angular wave number is

:&lt;math&gt;R(k_{sp})=-m((A + 3B\phi_{in}^2)k_{sp}^2 + \kappa k_{sp}^4)=\frac{m(A+3B\phi_{in}^2)^2}{4\kappa} = \frac{1}{t_{sp}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;t_{sp}&lt;/math&gt; is known as the ''spinodal time''.

The spinodal length and spinodal time can be used to [[Nondimensionalization|nondimensionalize]] the equation of motion, resulting in universal scaling for spinodal decomposition.

[[Image:Global tropical cyclone tracks-edit2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Global [[Tropical Cyclone]] Tracks between 1985 and 2005, indicating the areas where tropical cyclones usually develop]]
'''Storm tracks ''' are the relatively narrow zones in seas and oceans where [[storm]]s travel driven by the [[prevailing winds]]. 

The [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific]] have storm tracks along which most Atlantic or Pacific [[extratropical cyclone]]s or [[tropical cyclone]]s travel. The storm tracks usually begin in the westernmost parts of Atlantic and Pacific, where the large temperature contrasts between land and sea cause [[cyclone]]s to form, particularly in winter. Surface [[friction]] cause these cyclones to quickly fill up and decay as soon as they reach land at the eastern end of the basins, accounting for the easternmost edges of the storm tracks.

Storm tracks can shift position, causing important climatic patterns. As an example, during [[La Niña]] the Atlantic storm track shifts north causing droughts in Israel, while during [[El Niño]] it shifts south bringing heavy rains to the same region.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Inman and Scott Jenkins. "Climate Patterns in the Coastal Zone." ''Encyclopedia of Coastal Science.'' Springer Science &amp; Business Media, Nov 8, 2006. pg. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of a storm track is the circumpolar storm track in the [[Antarctic]], however land-sea contrasts play no role in its formation.

Given a grid point field of [[geopotential height]], storm tracks can be visualized by contouring its average [[standard deviation]], after the data has been [[band-pass]] filtered.

The [[whole-life cost]] of electricity includes payments on this debt.

As technology improves, with all else equal, the cost of generating electricity falls. A new entrant to the [[Market (economics)|market]], unencumbered by debt, can build a modern plant and generate electricity at a lower cost than existing providers. Logical customers leave the incumbent utility for the new entrant, reducing the incumbent's [[revenue]] and spreading its debt payments across fewer remaining customers.

The problem is often caused by overlong [[depreciation]] schedules for capital investments by utilities, presuming that regulatory and market conditions would not change substantially.

Solutions to the stranded costs problem include assigning a portion of the incumbent utility's debt to the new entrant as a condition of entry, or charging all customers in the market area a "stranded cost recovery fee". In some cases, a government may assume a portion of an incumbent utility's debt and assign it to the public debt, thus freeing the incumbent to compete more efficiently against new entrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Stranded Costs |title=Draft Working Model for Restructuring the Electric Utility Industry |chapterurl= http://www.scc.virginia.gov/comm/reports/streprt4.pdf |url=https://www.scc.virginia.gov/power/history.aspx |publisher=Virginia State Corporation Commission |date=1997 |accessdate=October 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Upstream contamination''' by floating particles is a [[paradox|counterintuitive phenomenon]] in [[fluid dynamics]]. When pouring water from a higher container to a lower one, particles floating in the latter can climb upstream into the upper container.  A definitive explanation is still lacking: experimental and computational evidence indicates that the contamination is chiefly driven by [[surface tension]] gradients, however the phenomenon is also affected by the dynamics of swirling flows that remain to be fully investigated.

==Origins==
[[File:Experimental setup for upstream contamination.gif|thumb|Experimental setup for creating a constant flow of water falling from a higher to a lower recipient.]]

The phenomenon was first observed in 2008 by the Argentinian 
S. Bianchini during mate tea preparation, while studying Physics 
at the [[University of Havana]].

It rapidly attracted the interest of Prof. A. Lage, who performed,
with Bianchini, a series of controlled experiments. Later on
Prof. E. Altshuler completed the trio in [[Havana]], which resulted in the
Diploma thesis of Bianchini and 
a short original paper posted in the web arxiv&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arXiv|author=Bianchini S. |display-authors=etal |title=Upstream contamination in water pouring |date=2011 |arxiv=1105.2585}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commented as a surprising fact in some online journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=2011 |title=Contaminants Can Flow Up Waterfalls, Say Physicists |url=http://www.technologyreview.com/view/424026/contaminants-can-flow-up-waterfalls-say-physicists/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=2011 |title=Small Particles Can Flow Up Waterfalls, Say Tea-Drinking Physicists |url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/discoblog/2011/05/17/small-particles-can-flow-up-waterfalls-say-tea-drinking-physicists}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=2011 |title= Some particles are able to flow up small waterfalls, physicists show |url=http://phys.org/news/2011-05-particles-small-waterfalls-physicists.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| date=2013| title= Particles defy gravity, float upstream|url=https://www.sciencenews.org/article/particles-defy-gravity-float-upstream}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bianchini's Diploma thesis showed that the phenomenon could be reproduced 
in a controlled laboratory setting using mate leaves or chalk powder as contaminants, 
and that temperature gradients (hot in the top, cold in the bottom) were not necessary 
to generate the effect. The research also showed that surface tension was 
a key element to the explanation through the so-called [[Marangoni effect]], which was 
suggested by two facts: (a) both mate and 
chalk lowered the surface tension of water, and (b) if an industrial surfactant was
added on the upper reservoir, the upstream motion of particles would stop.

==Confirmation==
After a talk by A. Lage at the First Workshop on Complex Matter Physics
in Havana (MarchCOMeeting'2012), Prof. T Shinbrot ([[Rutgers University]])
got interested in the subject. Together with student T. Siu,  
Cuban results were confirmed and expanded with new experiments and numerical
simulations at Rutgers,
which resulted in a joint peer-reviewed paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bianchini S. |display-authors=etal |title=Upstream contamination by floating particles |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|date=2013 |url=http://rspa.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/469/2157/20130067|doi=10.1098/rspa.2013.0067 |volume=469 |pages=20130067|bibcode = 2013RSPSA.46930067B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, the phenomenon has been confirmed independently by others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upstream Contamination by Floating Particles |date=2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCKu_mwTTI0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Whether it is caused solely by surface tension gradients or depends also on dynamical 
behaviors of the falling water still remains as an open question.

Videos of the effect are available on YouTube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upstream contamination in water pouring|author=A. Lage-Castellanos |date=2013 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jk-qAIcZk74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upstream Contamination by Floating Particles |date=2014 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PCKu_mwTTI0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications==
The phenomenon of upstream contamination could be relevant to industrial and biotechnological processes, and may be
connected even to movements of the [[protoplasm]]. It could imply that some of the ''good practices'' in industrial and biotechnological procedures need revision.

[[File:Vacuum interrupter.jpg|thumb|Vacuum interrupter with ceramic housing.]]
In [[electrical engineering]], a '''vacuum interrupter''' is a [[switch]] which uses [[electrical contacts]] in a vacuum. It is the core component of medium-voltage circuit-breakers, generator circuit-breakers &amp; high-voltage circuit-breakers. Separation of the electrical contacts results in a metal vapour arc, which is quickly extinguished. Vacuum interrupters are widely used in utility [[power transmission]] systems, [[Electricity generation|power generation]] unit, and [[Electric power distribution|power-distribution system]]s for [[railway|railway,]] [[Electric arc furnace|arc furnace]] application &amp; [[industrial plant]]s.

Since the arc is contained within the interrupter, [[switchgear]] using vacuum interrupters are very compact compared with switchgear using air, [[Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker|SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] or oil as arc-suppression medium. Vacuum interrupters can be used for circuit-breakers and load switches. Circuit-breaker vacuum interrupters are primarily used in the [[energy industry|power sector]] in [[electrical substation|substation]] and power-generation facilities, and load-switching vacuum interrupters are used for [[electrical grid|power-grid]] end users.

==History ==
The use of a vacuum for switching electrical currents was motivated by the observation that a one-centimeter gap in an X-ray tube could withstand tens of thousands of [[volt]]s. Although some vacuum switching devices were patented during the 19th century, they were not commercially available. In 1926, a group led by [[Royal Sorensen]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]] investigated vacuum switching and tested several devices; fundamental aspects of arc interruption in a vacuum were investigated. Sorenson presented the results at an [[IEEE|AIEE]] meeting that year, and predicted the switches' commercial use. In 1927, [[General Electric]] purchased the [[patent]] rights and began commercial development. The [[Great Depression]] and the development of oil-filled switchgear caused the company to reduce development work, and little commercially-important work was done on vacuum power switichgear until the 1950s.&lt;ref name="greeenwood94"&gt;Allan Greenwood, ''Vacuum Switchgear'', IET, 1994 {{ISBN|0852968558}}, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, H. Cross revolutionized the high-frequency-circuit vacuum switch produced by Jenning and produced a vacuum switch with a rating of 15 kV at 200 A. Five years later, General Electric produced the first vacuum circuit breakers with a rated voltage of 15 kV at short-circuit breaking currents  of 12.5 kA. In 1966, devices were developed with a rated voltage of 15 kV and short-circuit breaking currents of 25 and 31.5 kA. After the 1970s, vacuum switches began to replace the minimal-oil switches in medium-voltage switchgear. in the early 1980s, SF6 switches &amp; breakers were also gradually replaced by vacuum  technology in medium-voltage application.

As of 2018, a single-break vacuum circuit breaker has reached 145 kV and breaking current has reached 200 kA.

Manufacturers of vacuum interrupters have included [[Siemens]], General Electric (GE), Westinghouse Electric (WH), Jucro Electric, Cooper Electric, Jenning ELectric, the [[General Electric Company]]
(later acquired by [[Alstom]]), [[Areva]] and [[AEG]]. [[Toshiba]], [[Meidensha]], [[Fuji Electric]], [[Hitachi]] and [[Mitsubishi]] products have a longitudinal magnetic-field structure.{{Technical statement|date=September 2017}}

==Classification==
[[File:Vbu16003.jpg|thumb|right|alt=see caption|A medium-voltage three-phase vacuum [[circuit breaker]] with three vacuum-interrupter housings]]Vacuum interrupters may be classified by enclosure type, by application, and by voltage class. 
Experimental, radio-frequency, and early power-switching vacuum interrupters had glass enclosures. More recently, vacuum interrupters for power switchgear are made with ceramic envelopes.

Applications &amp; uses include circuit-breakers, generator circuit-breaker, load switches, motor contactors, and [[recloser]]s. Special-purpose vacuum interrupters are also manufactured, such as those used in [[transformer]] [[tap changer]]s, or in [[Electric arc furnace|electrical arc furnace]].

==Generator circuit-breaker==
Researches and investigations in the early 1990s allow the employment of vacuum switching technology for generator applications. Generator switching applications are well-known for their higher strains on interrupting devices such as high fault current of high asymmetry or high and steep transient recovery voltage, the standard IEC/IEEE 62271-37-013 (former and still valid IEEE C37.013, 1997) was introduced to address such requirements on circuit breakers used in generator applications.

Vacuum circuit breakers can be qualified as a generator circuit breakers according to IEC/IEEE 62271-37-013. Compared to circuit breakers using other quenching media (such as [[Sulfur hexafluoride circuit breaker|SF6]], air-blast or minimum oil), vacuum circuit breakers have the advantages of: 
* Great recovery strength eliminating the need of capacitors to reduce the steepness of the [[Transient recovery voltage|Transient Recovery Voltage]] (as required in most [[Generator circuit breaker|SF6 GCB]]),
* High mechanical &amp; electrical durability with significantly higher numbers and frequency of possible switching operations without maintenance,
* Environmental-friendly not using [[Sulfur hexafluoride|F-gas]].

==Structure==
A vacuum interrupter generally has one fixed and one moving contact, a flexible bellows to allow movement of that contact, and arc shields enclosed in a [[Hermetic seal|hermetically-sealed]] glass, ceramic or metal housing with a high [[Vacuum#Measurement|vacuum]]. The moving contact is connected by a flexible braid to the external circuit, and is moved by a mechanism when the device is required to open or close. Since air pressure tends to close the contacts, the operating mechanism must hold the contacts open against the closing force of air pressure on the bellows.

===Airtight enclosure ===
The interrupter's enclosure is made of [[glass]] or [[ceramic]]. Hermetic seals ensure that the interrupter vacuum is maintained for the life of the device.  The enclosure must be impermeable to gas, and must not give off trapped gas. The [[Stainless steel|stainless-steel]] bellows isolates the vacuum inside the interrupter from the external atmosphere and moves the contact within a specified range, opening and closing the switch.

===Shielding ===
A vacuum interrupter has shields around the contacts and at the ends of the interrupter, preventing any contact material vaporized during an [[Electric arc|arc]] from condensing on the inside of the vacuum envelope. This would reduce the insulation strength of the envelope, ultimately resulting in the arcing of the interrupter when open. The shield also helps control the shape of the electric-field distribution inside the interrupter, which contributes to a higher open-circuit voltage rating. It helps absorb some of the energy produced in the arc, increasing a device's [[Breaking capacity|interrupting rating]].

===Contacts ===
[[File:Vacuum circuit breaker.jpeg|thumb|30 year old Siemens vacuum interrupter]]
The contacts carry the circuit current when closed, forming the terminals of the arc when open. They are made of a variety of materials, depending on the vacuum interrupter's use and design for long contact life, rapid recovery of voltage withstand rating, and control of over-voltage due to current chopping.

An external operating mechanism drives the moving contact, which opens and closes the connected circuit. The vacuum interrupter includes a guide sleeve to control the moving contact and protect the sealing bellows from twisting, which would drastically shorten its life.

Although some vacuum-interrupter designs have simple butt contacts, contacts are generally shaped with slots, ridges, or grooves to improve their ability to break high currents. Arc current flowing through the shaped contacts generate magnetic forces on the arc column, which cause the arc contact spot to move rapidly over the surface of the contact. This reduces contact wear due to erosion by an arc, which melts the contact metal at the point of contact.

Only few manufacturer of vacuum interrupters worldwide produce the contact material itself. The basic raw materials copper and chrome are combined to a powerful contact material by means of the arc-melting procedure. The resulting raw parts are processed to RMF or AMF contact discs, whereby the slotted AMF discs are deburred at the end. Contact materials require the following:

# High breaking ability: Excellent electrical conductivity, small [[thermal conductivity]], bigger [[heat capacity]] and low hot [[electron emission]] capability
# High [[breakdown voltage]] and resistance to [[electrical erosion]] 
# Resistance to welding
# Low cutoff current value
# Low gas content (especially copper)

In circuit breakers, vacuum-interrupter contact materials are primarily a 50-50 copper-[[chromium]] alloy. They may be made by welding a copper-chrome alloy sheet on the upper and lower contact surfaces over a contact seat made of [[oxygen-free copper]]. Other materials, such as silver, [[tungsten]] and tungsten compounds, are used in other interrupter designs. The vacuum interrupter's contact structure has a great influence on its breaking capacity, electrical durability and level of current chopping.

===Bellows===
The vacuum interrupter bellows allows the moving contact to be operated from outside the interrupter enclosure, and must maintain a long-term high vacuum over the expected operating life of the interrupter. The bellows is made of stainless steel with a thickness of 0.1 to 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm. Its [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] life is affected by heat conducted from the arc.

To enable them to meet the requirements for high endurance in real practice, the bellows are regularly subjected to an endurance test every three months. The test is carried out in a fully automatic test cabin with the travels adjusted to the respective type.

Bellows lifetime are over 30,000 CO operation cycles.

=={{anchor|Working principle}}Operation==
A vacuum interrupter uses a high vacuum to extinguish the arc between a pair of contacts. As the contacts move apart, current flows through a smaller area. There is a sharp increase in resistance between the contacts, and the temperature at the contact surface increases rapidly until the occurrence of electrode-metal evaporation. At the same time, the [[electric field]] is very high across the small contact gap. The breakdown of the gap produces a vacuum arc. As the [[alternating current]] is forced to pass through zero thanks to the arc resistance, and the gap between the fixed and moving contacts widens, the conductive [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] produced by the arc moves away from the gap and becomes non-conductive. The current is interrupted. u

AMF &amp; RMF contacts have spiral (or radial) slots cut into their faces. The shape of the contacts produces magnetic forces which move the arc spot over the surface of the contacts, so the arc does not remain in one place for very long. The arc is evenly distributed over the contact surface to maintain a low arc voltage and to reduce contact erosion.

==Production process==
Components of the vacuum interrupter must be thoroughly cleaned before assembly, since contaminants could emit gas into the vacuum envelope. To ensure a high breakdown voltage, components are assembled in a [[cleanroom]] where dust is strictly controlled.

After having finished and cleaned the surfaces by electroplating and performed an optical inspection of the surface consistency of all single parts, the interrupter is assembled. The high-vacuum solder is applied at the joints of the components, the parts are aligned, and the interrupters are fixed. As cleanliness during assembly is especially important, all operations are done under air-conditioned clean-room conditions – in this way we can guarantee a constantly high quality of the interrupters and maximum possible ratings up to 100 kA according to IEC/IEEE 62271-37-013.

Sub-assemblies of vacuum interrupters were initially assembled and [[Brazing|brazed]] together in a hydrogen atmosphere furnace. A tube connected to the interrupter's interior was used to evacuate the interrupter with an external vacuum pump while the interrupter was maintained at about {{convert|400|°C}}. Since the 1970s, interrupter sub-components have been assembled in a [[vacuum furnace|high-vacuum brazing furnace]] by a combined brazing-and-evacuation process. Tens (or hundreds) of bottles are processed in one batch, using a high-vacuum furnace which heats them at temperatures up to 900&amp;nbsp;°C and a pressure of 10-6 mbar.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph A. Eichmeier, Manfred Thumm (eds), ''Vacuum Electronics: Components and Devices'', Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2008 {{ISBN|3540719296}}, page 408&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the interrupters fulfill the quality requirement “[[sealed for lifetime]]”. Thanks to the fully automatic production process, the high quality can be constantly reproduced at any time

Then, the evaluation of the interrupters by means of the  [[X-ray]] procedure is used to verify the positions as well as the completeness of the internal components, and the quality of the brazing points. It ensures the high quality of  vacuum interrupters.

During forming, the definitive internal [[dielectric strength]] of the vacuum interrupter is established with gradually increasing voltage, and this is verified by a subsequent lightning impulse voltage test. Both operations are done with higher values than those specified in the standards, as evidence of the quality of the vacuum interrupters. This is the prerequisite for a long endurance and a high availability.

==Sealed for lifetime==
Due to their manufacturing process, vacuum interrupters are proved to be "sealed for lifetime".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cired.net/publications/cired2007/pdfs/CIRED2007_0156_paper.pdf|title=Vacuum Interrupter - Sealed for life|last=Renz, Gentsch, Fink, Slade, Schlaug|first=|date=2007|website=CIRED|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This avoids the need for monitoring systems or tightness tests as stated in the IEEE std C37.100.1 on paragraph 6.8.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=IEEE std C37.100.1 - IEEE Standard of Common Requirements for High-Voltage Power Switchgear Rated Above 1000 V|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overvoltage effects==
Under certain circumstances, the vacuum circuit breaker can force the current in the circuit to zero before the natural zero (and reversal of current) in the alternating-current circuit. If interrupter operation timing is unfavorable with respect to the AC-voltage waveform (when the arc is extinguished but the contacts are still moving and [[ionization]] has not yet dissipated in the interrupter), the voltage may exceed the gap's withstand voltage. This can re-ignite the arc, causing abrupt transient currents. In either case, [[Oscillation#Electrical|oscillation]] is introduced into the system which may result in significant [[overvoltage]]. Vacuum-interrupter manufacturers address these concerns by selecting contact materials and designs to minimize current chopping. To protect equipment from overvoltage, vacuum switchgears usually include [[surge arrester]]s.&lt;ref name="Smeaton98"&gt;Robert W. Smeaton, William H. Ubert, ''Switchgear and Control Handbook, 3rd Edition'', McGraw Hill, 1998, pages 14-29 and 14-30&lt;/ref&gt;

Nowadays, with very low current chopping, vacuum circuit breaker will not induce any overvoltage which could have a negative impact on the insulation of surrounding equipment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2967">A '''water conservation order''' is a legal ruling to protect aspects of water bodies. It may be to protect the quantity of the water itself or for any issues relating to the water body as a whole.

==New Zealand==
In [[New Zealand]], a Water Conservation Order is used to protect the natural, cultural and recreational values of any water body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/1991/0069/latest/DLM236751.html Part 9] of the Resource Management Act 1991&lt;/ref&gt;  Water Conservation Orders came about as a result of lobbying by a group of stakeholders in the late seventies.  At that time rivers were managed through the Water &amp; Soil Conservation Act, which was administered by an appointed statutory body (NWASCA) serviced by the Ministry of Works.  The engineers of the Ministry of Works argued that there was no need to legislate further as the Act contained provision for setting Minimum Flows.

There are currently 14 separate Water Conservation Orders:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/issues/water/freshwater/water-conservation/| publisher=Ministry for the Environment| title=Water conservation orders}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A water conservation order has been proposed for the [[Hurunui River]] in the South Island.
