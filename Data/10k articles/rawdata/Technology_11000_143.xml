[[3G]] [[mobile telephony]] was relatively slow to be adopted 3Gglobally. In some instances, 3G networks do not use the same radio frequencies as [[2G]] so mobile operators must build entirely new networks and license entirely new frequencies, especially so to achieve high data transmission rates. Other delays were due to the expenses of upgrading transmission hardware, especially for [[UMTS]], whose deployment required the replacement of most broadcast towers. Due to these issues and difficulties with deployment, many carriers were not able to or delayed acquisition of these updated capabilities.

In December 2007, 190 3G networks were operating in 40 countries and 154 [[HSDPA]] networks were operating in 71 countries, according to the Global Mobile Suppliers Association (GSA). In Asia, Europe, Canada and the USA, telecommunication companies use [[W-CDMA]] technology with the support of around 100 terminal designs to operate 3G mobile networks.

Roll-out of 3G networks was delayed in some countries by the enormous costs of additional spectrum licensing fees. (See [[Telecoms crash]].)  The license fees in some European countries were [[Telecoms crash|particularly high]], bolstered by government auctions of a limited number of licenses and [[sealed bid auction]]s, and initial excitement over 3G's potential.

The 3G standard is perhaps well known because of a massive expansion of the mobile communications market post-2G and advances of the consumer mophone. An especially notable development during this time is the [[smartphone]] (for example, the [[iPhone]], and the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] family), combining the abilities of a [[PDA]] with a mobile phone, leading to widespread demand for mobile internet connectivity. 3G has also introduced the term "[[mobile internet|mobile broadband]]" because its speed and capability make it a viable alternative for internet browsing, and USB Modems connecting to 3G networks are becoming increasingly common.

==Africa==
The first African use of 3G technology was a 3G video call made in [[Johannesburg]] on the [[Vodacom]] network in November 2004. The first commercial launch was by Emtel-ltd in Mauritius in 2004. In late March 2006, a 3G service was provided by the new company [[Wana (Telecommunications)|Wana]] in Morocco. In May 2007, [[Safaricom]] launched 3G services in Kenya while later that year Vodacom Tanzania also started providing services. In February 2012 Bharti Airtel Launched a 3.75G Network in selected cities in Kenya with a countrywide rollout planned for later in the year. In Egypt, [[Mobinil]] launched the service in 2008 and in Somaliland, [[Telesom]] started first 3G services on 3 July 2011, to both prepaid and postpaid subscription customers.
Telecommunication networks in Nigeria like Globacom, Etisalat, Airtel and MTN provide 3G services to their numerous customers.

==Asia==
Asia is also using 3G services very well. A lot of companies like [[Dialog Axiata PLC]] Sri Lanka (First to serve 3G Service in South Asia in 2006), [[BSNL]], [[WorldCall]], [[PTCL]], [[Mobilink]], [[Zong Pakistan|Zong]], [[Ufone]], [[Telenor PK]],  [[Maxis Communications|Maxis]], [[Vodafone India|Vodafone]], [[Bharti Airtel|Airtel]], [[Idea Cellular]], [[Aircel]], [[Tata DoCoMo]] and [[Reliance Communications|Reliance]] have released their 3G services.

===Sri Lanka===
Sri Lanka's All Mobile Networks([[Dialog Axiata|Dialog]], [[Mobitel (Sri Lanka)|Mobitel]], [[Etisalat (Sri Lanka)|Etisalat]], [[Hutch Sri Lanka|Hutch]], [[Airtel Lanka|Airtel]],) And CDMA Network Providers (Lankabell, Dialog,Suntel,SLT) Launched 3G Services.

[[Dialog Axiata|Dialog]], [[Mobitel (Sri Lanka)|Mobitel]] launched [[4G LTE]] Services In Sri Lanka.
Not Only ([[Dialog Axiata|Dialog CDMA]], Lankabell CDMA Have [[4G LTE]] Services.
Sri Lanka Telecom Have [[4G LTE]] , FTTX Services..

===Afghanistan===
On March 19, 2012, Etisalat Afghanistan, the fastest growing telecommunications company in the country and part of Etisalat Group, announced the launch of [[3G]] services in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etisalat.af/about-us/press-releases/188-etisalat-launches-3g-services-in-afghanistan&lt;/ref&gt; between 2013-2014 all telecommunications company ( [[Afghan Wireless]], [[Etisalat]], [[Roshan (Telecom)|Roshan]], [[MTN Group|MTN]] and [[Salaam Network]]) provided [[3G]], [[3.5G]] and [[3.75G]] services and they are planning for [[4G]] services in 2016-2017.

===Nepal===
Nepal was one of the first countries in southern Asia to launch 3G services. Nepal's first 3G company was [http://ntc.net.np NTC](Nepal Telecom Corporation) and the second was [https://web.archive.org/web/20100315102454/http://ncell.com.np/ Ncell]. Ncell also covered Mount Everest with 3G. [http://ntc.net.np NTC] provides high speed video calling with other 3G services, as well as post-paid and pre-paid 3G SIM cards.

===Pakistan===
{{main|Pakistani Telecom Spectrum Auction}}
3G and 4G was simultaneously launched in Pakistan on April 23, 2014 through a [[Spectrum auction|SMRA Auction]]. Three out of Five Companies got a 3G licence i.e. [[Ufone]], [[Mobilink]] and [[Telenor]] while [[China Mobile]]'s [[Zong Pakistan|Zong]] got 3G as well as a 4G licence. Whereas fifth company, [[Warid Pakistan]] did not participate in the auction procedure, But they launched 4G LTE services on their existing 2G 1800 MHz spectrum due to Technology neutral terms and became world's first Telecom Company to transform directly from 2G to 4G. With that Pakistan joined the 3G and 4G world.
In the non-mobile sector, Pakistan's biggest telecommunication company [[Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd|PTCL]] launched its 3G network, EVO, in mid-2008 and has since then established itself in this sector. It provides 3G services in 105 cities across Pakistan. [[Omantel]]'s [[WorldCall]] also provides 3G services in 50 cities Pakistan-wide. They provide mobile broadband service via dongles and modems. On 14 August 2010, [[Pakistan]] became the first country in the world to experience EVDO's RevB 3G technology that offers maximum speeds of 9.3 Mbit/s. At present the services of EVO Nitro (brand name) are available in [[Islamabad]], [[Rawalpindi]], [[Lahore]] and [[Karachi]]. The RevA network, with speeds if up to 3.1 Mbit/s is available in over 100 cities of the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://tribune.com.pk/story/699257/spectrum-auction-live-updates/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh===
State-run mobile operator [[Teletalk]] [[Bangladesh]] limited and other [[GSM]] operators [[GrameenPhone]], [[Banglalink]],  [[Robi]] and [[Bharti Airtel|Airtel]] already started hi-speed [[3G+]] and [[3.5G]] services using [[UMTS]] with [[HSDPA]] facilities. [[Grameenphone]] has a plan to launch [[4G]] [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] services first time in Bangladesh using [[TD-LTE]] technology.  Currently [[Grameenphone]] owned 10&amp;nbsp;MHz spectrum at 3G auction by [[Bangladesh Telecommunication Regulatory Commission|BTRC]].[[Robi]] and [[Airtel]]  recently merged, newly merged company has a plan to introduce 4G operation soon. Two other data operators, [[Qubee]] and [[Banglalion]], currently offer 4G [[Wimax]] services in Bangladesh. [[CityCell]] now switched off their operation by government order. [[4G LTE]] services have already begun in Bangladesh through all mobile operators except [[Teletalk]], the state run mobile operator. Bangladesh has a plan to introduce super speed [[5G]] service soon. A test run will be conducted in the country in mid July 2018.

===China===
China announced in May 2008, that the telecoms sector was re-organized and three 3G networks would be allocated so that the largest mobile operator, [[China Mobile]], would retain its GSM customer base. [[China Unicom]] would retain its GSM customer base but relinquish its CDMA2000 customer base, and launch 3G on the globally leading W-CDMA (UMTS) standard. The CDMA2000 customers of China Unicom would go to [[China Telecom]], which would then launch 3G on the CDMA2000 1x EV-DO standard. This meant that China would have all three main cellular technology 3G standards in commercial use. Finally in January 2009, Ministry of industry and Information Technology of China awarded licenses of all three standards: TD-SCDMA to China Mobile, W-CDMA to China Unicom and CDMA2000 to China Telecom. The launch of 3G occurred on 1 October 2009, to coincide with the 60th Anniversary of the Founding of the People's Republic of China.  By August 2011, China Telecom's 3G subscriber has exceeded 23 million
.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2011-08/23/content_13173323.htm|title=China Telecom subscribers reach 110.94m|author=China Daily|accessdate=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
11 December 2008, India entered the 3G arena with the launch of 3G enabled Mobile and Data services by Government owned Mahanagar Telephone Nigam Ltd [[MTNL]] in [[Delhi]] and later in [[Mumbai]]. MTNL becomes the first 3G Mobile service provider in India. After MTNL, another state operator Bharat Sanchar Nigam Ltd. ([[BSNL]]) launched 3G services on 22 Feb 2009 in [[Chennai]] and [[Kolkata]] and later launched 3G as Nationwide. The  [[3G Spectrum auction India|auction of 3G wireless spectrum]] was announced in April 2010 and 3G Spectrum allocated to all private operators on 1 September 2010.

===North Korea===
North Korea has had a 3G network since 2008, which is called [[Koryolink]], a joint venture between Egyptian company [[Orascom Telecom Holding]] and the state-owned Korea Post and Telecommunications Corporation (KPTC) is [[North Korea]]'s only 3G Mobile operator, and one of only two mobile companies in the country. According to Orascom quoted in [[BusinessWeek]], the company had 125,661 subscribers in May 2010. The Egyptian company owns 75 percent of Koryolink, and is known to invest in infrastructure for mobile technology in developing nations. It covers [[Pyongyang]], and five additional cities and eight highways and railways. Its only competitor, SunNet, uses GSM technology and suffers from poor call quality and disconnections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/idg/2010-05-13/cell-phone-demand-stays-strong-in-north-korea.html |title=Cell phone demand stays strong in North Korea |publisher=Business Week |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2010-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Phone numbers on the network are prefixed with +850 (0)192.&lt;ref&gt;[[Telephone numbers in North Korea]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
3G services were made available in the [[Philippines]] on December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physorg.com/news9436.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
3G services were made available in Singapore on October 2007. Widespread adoption of 3G began in January 2009, with the upgrading of phones to [[iPhone 3G]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]].

==Europe==
In Europe, mass market commercial 3G services were introduced starting in March 2003 by O2 in the UK and Italy. The [[European Union]] Council suggested that the 3G operators should cover 80% of the European national populations by the end of 2005.

==Canada==
In Canada, [[Bell Mobility]], [[SaskTel]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nortel.com/corporate/news/newsreleases/2005b/06_30_05_sasktel.html{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Telus]] launched a 3G EVDO network in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cellphones.ca/news/post001469/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rogers Wireless]] was the first to implement UMTS technology, with HSDPA services in eastern Canada in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Kapica Jack |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/article853485.ece |title=Rogers unveils new wireless network |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date=2006-11-02 |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing they would miss out on roaming revenue from the [[2010 Olympics|2010 Winter Olympics]], [[Bell Canada|Bell]] and [[Telus]] formed a joint venture and rolled out a shared [[HSDPA]] network using [[Nokia Siemens]] technology. After the [[Advanced Wireless Services|AWS]] spectrum in 2008, new entrants to the Canadian wireless markets including but not limited to [[Mobilicity]], [[Wind Mobile]] and [[Vidéotron]] have deployed their own UMTS networks in Canada using the [[Advanced Wireless Services|AWS]] spectrum.

==Middle East==
In [[Iran]] Rightel won the bid for the third Operator license. Rightel is the first 3G operator in Iran. Rightel has commercially launched in the last months of 2011.

In [[Jordan]], Orange is the first mobile 3G operator.

[[Mobitel (Iraq-Kurdistan)|Mobitel]] [[Iraq]] is the first mobile 3G operator in Iraq. It was launched commercially on February 2007.

MTN [[Syria]] is the first mobile 3G operator in Syria. It was launched commercially on May 2010.

In [[Lebanon]] Ministry of Telecoms launched a test period on September 20, 2011, where 4,000 smart-phone users were selected to enjoy 3G for one month and provide feedback. Currently, the test period is over, MTC Touch and Alfa began rolling out the new 3G services.

[[Saudi Arabia]] has got 4G as well as 3G/HSPA With Zain KSA, Saudi Telecom, and Mobily KSA.

==Turkey==
[[Turkcell]], [[Avea]] and [[Vodafone]] launched their 3G networks commercially on 30 July 2009 at the same time. [[Turkcell]] and [[Vodafone]] launched their 3G service on all provincial centres. Avea launched it on 16 provincial centres. It was after Turkey's monopoly mobile operator Turkcell accepted number portability, mobile operators attended frequency band auction and frequencies for 3G usage distributed around mobile operators. [[Turkcell]] got A band, [[Vodafone]] B and [[Avea]] C. Currently [[Turkcell]] and [[Vodafone]] have 3G networks on most of crowded cities and towns. Turkey has 3.9G networks now.

==New Zealand==
In late 2005, [[Vodafone NZ]] launched their 3G network, followed by [[Spark New Zealand|Spark NZ]]'s XT network in 2008, and newcomer [[2degrees]] using a combination of Vodafone's 3G towers and their own in 2009. [[2degrees]] has since built more towers, and is now self-sufficient in the major cities (Auckland, Hamilton, Wellington, Christchurch and Dunedin) but relies on a roaming agreement with Vodafone to cover the rest of the country. This gives it essentially the same footprint as Vodafone.

Kiwee One: an Airborne wind turbine
]]
An '''airborne wind turbine''' is a design concept for a [[wind turbine]] with a rotor supported in the air without a tower,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Flights of fancy: airborne wind turbines |work=Institute of Physics, Environmental Research Web |first=Dave |last=Elliot |url=http://blog.environmentalresearchweb.org/2014/04/12/flights-of-fancy-airborne-wind-turbines/ |date=2014-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus benefiting from more mechanical and aerodynamic options, the higher velocity and persistence of wind at high altitudes, while avoiding the expense of tower construction,&lt;ref&gt;Michael Specter, "Wind Power Takes Flight", ''The New Yorker''
May 20, 2013 [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/05/20/130520fa_fact_specter behind paywall]&lt;/ref&gt; or the need for [[slip ring]]s or [[yaw drive|yaw mechanism]]. An electrical generator may be on the ground or airborne. Challenges include safely suspending and maintaining turbines hundreds of meters off the ground in high winds and storms, transferring the harvested and/or generated power back to earth, and interference with aviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=High-Altitude Wind Energy: Huge Potential — And Hurdles |work=Environment 360 |first=David |last=Levitan |url=http://e360.yale.edu/feature/high_altitude_wind_energy_huge_potential_and_hurdles/2576/|quote="How do you safely suspend airborne turbines hundreds or thousands of feet off the ground? How do you keep them aloft for long periods of time in high winds without having to perform frequent, costly maintenance? And what about interference with aviation?" |date=2012-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Airborne wind turbines may operate in low or high altitudes; they are part of a wider class of Airborne Wind Energy Systems (AWES) addressed by [[high-altitude wind power]] and [[crosswind kite power]]. When the generator is on the ground,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energykitesystems.net/0/methods/index.html|title=Airborne Wind Energy Generation Systems|website=www.energykitesystems.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; then the tethered aircraft need not carry the generator mass or have a conductive tether. When the generator is aloft, then a conductive tether would be used to transmit energy to the ground or used aloft or beamed to receivers using microwave or laser. [[kite flying|Kite]]s and helicopters come down when there is insufficient wind; [[kytoon]]s and [[blimp]]s may resolve the matter with other disadvantages. Also, bad weather such as [[lightning]] or [[thunderstorm]]s, could temporarily suspend use of the machines, probably requiring them to be brought back down to the ground and covered. Some schemes require a long power cable and, if the turbine is high enough, a [[prohibited airspace]] zone. As of July 2015, no commercial airborne wind turbines are in regular operation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ac.els-cdn.com/S1364032115007005/1-s2.0-S1364032115007005-main.pdf?_tid=4919600e-0bc8-11e6-bf67-00000aab0f02&amp;acdnat=1461686733_a8f25d0787b25f451227cb02ac6376f0 Airborne Wind Energy Systems, a review of the technologies], A. cherubini, A. Papini, R. Vertechy, M.Fontana, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aerodynamic variety==
An aerodynamic airborne wind power system relies on the wind for support.
[[File:Crosswind kite power station with fast motion transfer having two wings offshore.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Crosswind kite generator with fast motion transfer]]

Miles L. Loyd proposed and analyzed an efficient AWES in his work "Crosswind Kite Power"&lt;ref name="Loyd"&gt;M. Loyd, [http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~highwind/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Loyd1980.pdf "Crosswind Kite Power"], J. Energy, vol. 4, no. 3, pp. 106-111, 1980&lt;/ref&gt; in 1980. Power output of AWES with crosswind wing motion is proportional to a square of a lift/drag ratio of the wing. Such AWES is based on the same aerodynamic principles as a conventional wind turbine (AWES), but it is more efficient because the air speed is constant along the wing span and the aerodynamic forces are resisted by tension of a tether, rather than by bending of a tower.

Bryan Roberts, a professor of engineering at the University of Technology, in Sydney, Australia, has proposed a helicopter-like craft which flies to {{convert|15000|ft|m}} altitude and stays there, held aloft by wings that generate lift from the wind, and held in place by a cable to a [[Earth anchor|ground anchor]]. According to its designers, while some of the energy in the wind would be 'lost' on lift, the constant and potent winds would allow it to generate constant electricity. Since the winds usually blow horizontally, the turbines would be at an angle from the horizontal, catching winds while still generating lift. Deployment could be done by feeding electricity to the turbines, which would turn them into electric motors, lifting the structure into the sky.

The Dutch ex-[[astronaut]] and [[physicist]] [[Wubbo Ockels]], working with the [[Delft University of Technology]] in the [[Netherlands]], has designed and demonstrated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Giant kites to tap power of the high wind |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/aug/03/renewableenergy.energy |first=Alok |last=Jha |work=The Guardian |date=3 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; an airborne wind turbine he called a "[[Laddermill]]". It consists of an endless loop of kites. The kites lift up one end of the endless loop (the "ladder"), and the released energy is used to drive an electric generator.

A September 2009 paper from Carbon Tracking Ltd., Ireland&lt;ref name="OGairbhith2009"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://carbontracking.com/reports/High_Altitude_Wind_Resource_in_Ireland.pdf

}}&lt;/ref&gt; has shown the [[capacity factor]] of a kite using ground-based generation to be 52.2%, which is better than terrestrial wind-farm capacity factors of 30%.

A team from [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in the [[United States]] has developed a smaller-scale&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.me.wpi.edu/wpi-kites/index.php/Main_Page |title=Welcome to the WPI Kite Power Wiki |accessdate=2008-05-05 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720120731/http://www2.me.wpi.edu/wpi-kites/index.php/Main_Page |archivedate=2011-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an estimated output of about 1&amp;nbsp;kW. It uses a [[kitesurfing|kiteboarding]] kite to induce a rocking motion in a pivoting beam.

The [[KiteGen]] uses a prototype vertical-axis wind turbine (actually a semi-rigid cross wind kite). It is an innovative plan (still in the construction phase) that consists of one wind farm with a vertical spin axis, and employs kites to exploit high-altitude winds. The Kite Wind Generator (KWG) or [[KiteGen]] is claimed to eliminate all the static and dynamic problems that prevent the increase of the power (in terms of dimensions) obtainable from the traditional horizontal-axis wind turbine generators. Generating equipment would remain on the ground, and only the airfoils are supported by the wind. Such a wind power plant would be capable of producing the energy equivalent to a [[nuclear plant]], while using an area of few square kilometres, without occupying it exclusively. (The majority of this area can still be used for agriculture, or navigation in the case of an offshore installation.)

The Rotokite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xercesblue.org/www_xercesblue_org_file/rotokite_ita.pdf|title=Rotokite|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is developed from Gianni Vergnano's idea. It uses aerodynamic profiles similar to kites that have been rotated on their own axis, emulating the performance of a propeller. The use of the rotation principle simplifies the problem of checking the flight of the kites and eliminates the difficulties due to the lengths of cables, enabling the production of wind energy at low cost. The Heli Wind Power is a project of Gianni Vergnano that uses a tethered kite.

The HAWE System &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omnidea.net/site/index.php/research/wind-energy|title=FP7|first=|last=pedro|website=www.omnidea.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; is developed from Tiago Pardal's idea. The System that consists in a Pumping Cycle similar to kite systems. In Generation Phase the pulling force increase 5-10 times due to Magnus Effect of a spinning cylinder(aerial platform), like a kite the pulling force produced by the aerial platform will unwind the cable and generate electricity in the ground.In the Recovery Phase it rewinds the cable with no Magnus Effect in the aerial platform.

In August 2011 the German company [[SkySails]], producer of kites for ship propulsion, announced a kite-based wind power system for on- and offshore applications that is supposed to be "30% cheaper than current offshore solutions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skysails.info/english/power/power-system/|title=SkySails GmbH - Compelling Technology|website=www.skysails.info|access-date=2011-10-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928145507/http://www.skysails.info/english/power/power-system/|archive-date=2011-09-28|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, the German company [[NTS GmbH]] had successfully tested [[X-Wind technology]] (spoken: Cross-Wind) on linear rail system in Freidland, Germany. "NTS Energie- und Transportsysteme GmbH" was found in 2006 by Uwe Ahrens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.x-wind.de/index.php/en/|title=NTS X-Wind|website=www.x-wind.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[X-Wind technology]] combines two well-known technologies - automatically steered kites and generators on a closed loop rail system. Closed loop prototype is under construction at Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleantech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Uwe_Ahrens_NTS.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202102652/http://www.cleantech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Uwe_Ahrens_NTS.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology allows to harness increasingly stable and constant wind currents at altitudes between 200 and 500m. Technical report readings and measurements show that NTS X-Wind Systems double to triple the efficiency of conventional wind energy systems according to energy production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cleantech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NTS-Airborne-Executive-Summary.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202102649/http://www.cleantech.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/NTS-Airborne-Executive-Summary.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, the Californian company [[Makani Power]], developer of some crosswind hybrid kite systems with onboard generator doubling as motor, has been acquired by Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-05-22/inside-googles-secret-lab|title=Inside Google's Secret Lab|author=|date=28 May 2013|publisher=|accessdate=3 April 2018|via=www.bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2013, an airborne wind energy system with a ground-based generator using fast motion transfer was suggested by L. Goldstein.&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;L. Goldstein, [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.energy.2013.03.087 "Theoretical analysis of an airborne wind energy conversion system with a ground generator and fast motion transfer"], Energy, Int. J, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a sails on rope wind and ocean current energy system was invented by a Taiwanese Johnson Hsu.[http://www.slideshare.net/ssusera40516/new-green-power]

Since 2014, Kitewinder, a French company located near [[Bordeaux]] is working on the first commercial airborne wind turbine named Kiwee One. Kiwee one is a back pack airborne wind turbine for nomadic uses with a nominal power of 100 [[Watt|Watts]]. Kiwee one launch procedure is manual but the product is equipped with an automatic retrieval mechanism for low wind / high wind conditions. 

==Aerostat variety==
An aerostat-type wind power system relies at least in part on [[buoyancy]] to support the wind-collecting elements. Aerostats vary in their designs and resulting [[lift-to-drag ratio]]; the kiting effect of higher lift-over-drag shapes for the aerostat can effectively keep an airborne turbine aloft; a variety of such kiting balloons were made famous in the [[kytoon]] by [[Domina Jalbert]].

[[Aerostat|Balloons]] can be incorporated to keep systems up without wind, but balloons leak slowly and have to be resupplied with lifting gas, possibly patched as well. Very large, [[solar balloon|sun-heated balloons]] may solve the helium or hydrogen leakage problems.

An [[Ontario]] based company called Magenn&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewallnut.eu/2011/11/15/magenn-power/|title="Magenn Air Rotor System" (broken link)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is developing a turbine called the Magenn Air Rotor System (MARS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latesttechnology-world.blogspot.com/2013/07/magenn-air-rotor-system-mars_18.html|title=Technical World : MAGENN AIR ROTOR SYSTEM (M.A.R.S.)|first=Moses Dhilip|last=Kumar|date=18 July 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A future {{convert|1000|ft|m|sing=on}}-wide MARS system would use a horizontal rotor in a [[helium]] suspended apparatus which is tethered to a transformer on the ground.

[[File:The Leading Facts of American History (1910) - Building the Fort at Jamestown.png|thumb|350px|Building a [[palisade]] wall for the fort at [[Jamestown, Virginia]]]]
[[File:Golden Plow York PA.JPG|thumb|The Golden Plow Tavern in York, PA, is a very unusual American building. It is built with ''corner post construction'' on the ground floor, ''half-timbered'' style of ''timber framing'' on the upper floor and has a less common style of wood roof shingles than typical in America.]]
'''American historic carpentry''' is the historic methods with which wooden buildings were built in what is now the United States since European settlement. A number of methods were used to form the wooden walls and the types of ''structural [[carpentry]]'' are often defined by the wall, floor, and roof construction such as log, timber framed, balloon framed, or stacked plank. Some types of historic houses are called plank houses but ''plank house'' has several meanings which are discussed below. Roofs were almost always framed with wood, sometimes with [[timber roof truss]]es. Stone and brick buildings also have some wood framing for floors, interior walls and roofs.

==Background==
Historically building methods were passed down from a master carpenter to an [[apprentice]] verbally, through demonstration, and through work experience.&lt;ref name="Noble" &gt;Noble, Allen George. ''Traditional buildings a global survey of structural forms and cultural functions''. London: I.B. Tauris ;, 2007. 7. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Designs, engineering details, floor plans, methods were time tested and communicated through [[Rule of thumb|rules of thumb]] rather than scientific study and documents. Each region of the world has variations on traditions, tools and materials. The carpenters who found themselves in the New World based their work on their traditions but adapted to new materials, climate, and mix of cultures. Immigrants to America were from all parts of the world so the history of American carpentry is very diverse and complex, but it is only four or five centuries old, a fraction of the history of many other regions.

Notable examples of structural carpentry which were not used in America include [[cruck]] framing.

==Definitions==
Carpentry is one of the [[traditional trades]] but is not always clearly distinguished from the work of the [[joiner]] and [[cabinetmaker]], in general a carpenter historically did the heavier, rougher work of framing a building including installing the sheathing and sub-flooring and installing pre-made doors and windows. Joiners did the finer work of installing trim and paneling. 
Plank and board are not consistently defined in history. Sometimes these terms are used synonymously. ''Board'' means a piece of [[lumber]] (timber) {{convert|1/2|in|cm}} to {{convert|1.5|in|cm}} thick and more than {{convert|4|in|cm}} wide. [[Plank (wood)|''Plank'']] generally means a piece of lumber (timber) rectangular in shape and thicker than a board.

===Timber framing===

[[File:John Ward House.jpg|thumb|[[John Ward House (Salem, Massachusetts)]] is a [[First Period]] house is Medieval in styling. Some of the oldest houses in America have [[jettying]] of the second floor, a feature mimicked by the Garrison style of houses.

{{main|Timber framing}}
Timber framing, historically called a ''braced frame'', was the most common method of building wooden buildings in America&lt;ref name="Hawkins" &gt;Hawkins, Reginald R., and Charles H. Abbe. ''New houses from old: a guide to the planning and practice of house remodeling''.. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1948. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; from the 17th-century European settlements until the early 20th century when timber framing was replaced by balloon framing and then platform framing in houses and what was called plank or "joist" framing in barns. The framing in [[barn]]s is usually visible, but in houses is usually covered with the [[siding]] material on the outside and [[plaster]] or [[drywall]] on the inside. Variations of timber framing are described based on their nature at the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], [[sill plate]], [[wall]], [[wall plate]], and [[roof]].

[[Post (structural)|Posts]] which were dug into the ground are called earthfast{{dubious|This appears to have been a very limited, localized usage historically.|date=November 2015}} or [[post in ground]] construction. This technique eliminated the need for bracing. Some buildings were framed with the posts landing on a foundation with ''interrupted sills''. Most buildings were framed with the posts landing on a heavy timber sill, the sills (rarely) laid on the ground, supported by stones or, late in the 19th century, concrete.

The structural carpentry of the walls are of several types and are discussed in detail below. French settlers called placing studs or posts on a sill spaced slightly apart  [[poteaux-sur-sol]] which is similar to the English [[close studding]]. These are examples of ''half timbering'' where the framing is ''infilled'' with another material such as a mud mixture, stones, or bricks. Half timbering in America is found in limited areas, mostly of German settlement, including [[Old Salem]], North Carolina, parts of Missouri, Louisiana, and Pennsylvania. Much more common was to build a framed building and add brick nogging between the framing which may not be considered half timbering. Half timbering is an architectural element in [[Tudor architecture|Tudor]] and [[Tudor Revival architecture]].

One of the earliest descriptions of how to build timber framed buildings in America was in a publication titled ''Information and Direction to Such Persons as are Inclined to America, more Especially Those Related to the Province of Pennsylvania'' attributed to William Penn in 1684. Described is an earthfast, [[Hewing|hewn]] frame "filled in" (half-timbered) with riven [[Clapboard (architecture)|clapboard]]s for the [[siding]], [[roofing material|roofing]] and loft [[flooring]]. The author called this a "first house" distinguishing that it is suitable until such time a better house can be built and then this building can be used as an outbuilding:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  To build then, an House of thirty foot long and eighteen foot broad, with a partition near the middle, and an other to divide one end of the House into two small rooms, there must be eight Trees about sixteen Inches square, and cut off, to ''Posts'' of about fifteen foot long, which the House must stand upon, and four pieces, two of thirty foot long, and two of eighteen foot long, for ''Plates'', which must lie upon the top of those Posts, the whole length and breadth of the House for the ''Gists'' [joists] to rest upon.  There must be ten ''Gists'' of twenty foot long, to bear the Loft, and two false ''Plates'' of thirty foot long to lie upon the ends of the ''Gists'' for the ''Rafters'' to be fixed upon, twelve pair of ''Rafters'' of about twenty foot, to bear the Roof of the House, with several other small pieces; as ''Wind-beams'', ''Braces'', ''Studs'', &amp;c. which are made out of the Waste Timber.  For Covering the House, Ends, and Sides, and for the Loft, we use ''Clabboard'', which is ''Rived feather-edeged'', of five foot and a half long, that well Drawn, [smoothed] lyes close and smooth: The Lodging Room may be lined with the same, and filled up between, which is very Warm.  These houses usually endure ten years without repair....
  The lower flour [floor] is the ''Ground'', the upper ''Clabbord'': This may seem a mean way of Building, but 'tis sufficient and safest among ordinary beginners...&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eg4XAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA331 "Information and Direction to Such Persons as are Inclined to America, more Especially Those Related to the Province of Pennsylvania"], reprinted in ''The Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography'' Vol. IV. 1880. Philadelphia. The Pennsylvania Historical Society. 329-342. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Earthfast construction is still used for buildings and structures such as in [[pole building framing]] and [[stilt houses]].

===Log building===
{{main|Log building}}
Log building is the second most common type of carpentry in American history. In some regions and periods it was more common than timber framing. There are many different styles of log carpentry: (1) where the logs are made into squared beams and fitted tightly. This style is typical of defensive structures called a [[blockhouse]]. The walls needed to be thick and strong and not have gaps in-between; (2) Round logs are left spaced apart, often with the gaps filled with a material called chinking; (3) Planked log buildings have the wall timbers shaped into rectangular thus called planks and ''plank houses''.

The [[C. A. Nothnagle Log House]], located in [[Gibbstown, New Jersey]], was constructed in 1638 and is believed to be the oldest surviving log house in what is today the United States. The house was built by colonial settlers in what was then the Swedish colony of [[New Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM4CDW_OLDEST_Log_House_in_North_America OLDEST - Log House in North America - Superlatives on Waymarking.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balloon framing===
{{main|Balloon framing}}
Balloon framing originated in the American Mid-west near [[Chicago]] in the 1830s. It is a rare type of American historic carpentry which was exported from America. Balloon framing is very important in history as the beginning of the transition away from the centuries-long method of timber framing to the common types of wood framing now in use.

===Corner post construction===
{{main|Post-and-plank}}
Corner post construction is known by many names listed below, but particularly as '''pièce sur pièce''' and it blurs the line between timber framing and log building. This type of carpentry has a frame with horizontal beams or logs tenoned into slots or mortises in the posts. Pièce sur pièce en coulisse: Literally piece on piece in a groove is a widespread type of carpentry which blurs the lines between log, plankwall and framing techniques, thus is classified as any of the above.
"The support of horizontal timbers by corner posts is an old form of construction in Europe. It was apparently carried across much of the continent from Silesia by the Lausitz urnfield culture in the late Bronze Age."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dell Upton]], John Michael Vlach. ''Common places: Readings in American Vernacular Architecture'',  referencing V. Gordon Childe, ''The Bronze Age'', NY, Macmillan, 1930, pp. 206-8&lt;/ref&gt; Examples also persist in southern Sweden, in the Alps, Hungry, Poland, Denmark, and Canada. Usually the origin of corner post construction is credited to the immigrants of the far-Eastern French in Canada and Alpine-Alemannic Germans or Swiss in the U. S.&lt;ref&gt;Jordan, Terry. "Alpine, Alemannic, and American Log Architecture", ''Annals of the Association of American Geographers'', Vol. 70(1980), pp. 154-80&lt;/ref&gt; This technique is best known in German as standerbohlenbau or bohlenstanderbau.
	Horizontal wood pieces (poles, beams, planks) tenoned into grooves in posts. This type of construction allows shorter timbers to be used and a building can be extended an indefinite length by adding more bays, typically measuring ten feet. Similar methods of construction are found in most if not all Viking settled regions and was common in Scandinavia. It is one of the earliest building types of French-Canada used extensively by the Hudson’s Bay Company for trading posts across Canada. It became a common, widespread building method in Canada. Other French names reflect the shape of wood (bois) used between the posts such as planche en coulisse, madriers-, or pieux-. Also recorded in French as bois en coulisse, poteaux en coulisse, madriers en coulisse, poteaux entourées de pieux, charpente entourée de madriers, poteaux entourées de madriers, en poteaux et close de pieux, en pieux sur pieux. (Lessard and Vilandré 1974:117) and “piece-sur-piece de charpente“ (French Canadian). Piece sur piece literally means piece on piece and also describes log building with notched corners or any kind of stacked construction. 
	Used in the United States predominantly in early French forts and settlements along the Mississippi River, though examples also occur in other states including Maine, New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Ohio, Wyoming, Maryland and Michigan where the it is the construction method of oldest house in the state ([[Navarre-Anderson Trading Post]], 1789). A particularly interesting example is the Golden Plough Tavern (c. 1741), York, York County, PA, which has the ground level of corner-post construction, the second floor of fachwerk (half timbered) and was built for a German with other Germanic features&lt;ref&gt;Nancy S. Shedd. [http://www.huntingdonhistoryresearchnetwork.net/?page_id=236 “Corner-Post Log Construction: Description, Analysis, and Sources”] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925103016/http://www.huntingdonhistoryresearchnetwork.net/?page_id=236 |date=2013-09-25 }}, A Report to Early American Industries Association. March 10, 1986 and updated 2011. A very interesting report discussing numerous examples found in PA, some examples with the rare feature of bracing which is also found in MD and Poland.&lt;/ref&gt;
	“This sophisticated system, which uses carefully constructed mortise-and-tenon joints, was common from the 1820s to the 1860s and represents some 5 percent of the log houses built in western Maryland.”&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Bock and Douglass C. Reed, [http://www.oldhouseonline.com/repairing-a-historic-log-cabin/ “Repairing a Historic Log Cabin: A variety of materials and methods work together in the structural repair of an 1850s log cabin”], ''Old House Journal'', March/April 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally these buildings have [[post in ground|earthfast]] posts. James Hébert incorrectly presented it as “an entirely Canadian style”.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/4946 "Culture built upon the land : a predictive model of nineteenth-century Canadien/Métis farmsteads."] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413124211/https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/4946 |date=April 13, 2014 }} Oregon State University Thesis 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Also known other parts of central Europe, Medieval British Isles, including (Switzerland, Austria and S. Germany),. The Norman French were credited with the introduction of this building technique to Canada, though this technique is found in northwest Europe, the Alps to Hungry. It was used in Pennsylvania and North Carolina by German immigrants.

===Plank-frame houses===
&lt;!--Plank frame redirects here--&gt;
Plank-frame house construction has a ''timber frame'' with the walls made of ''vertical planks'' attached to the frame. These houses may simply be called ''plank houses''. Some building historians prefer the term plank-on-frame. Plank-frame houses are known from the 17th century with concentrations in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]. The carpentry consists of a timber frame with vertical planks extending from sill to plate. Sometimes there are studs at the doors but mostly the vertical planks replace the studs. Both wood shingle or clapboard exterior siding and interior [[lath and plaster]] attach directly to the planks.&lt;ref name="Garvin" &gt;Garvin, James L.. ''A building history of northern New England''. Hanover: University Press of New England, 2001. 21. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of plank frame houses are the oldest house in New Hampshire, the [[Richard Jackson House]], [[Thomas and Esther Smith House]] in Massachusetts, and the &lt;!-- Where did the rest of this sentence go? --&gt;

===Palisade construction===
[[File:Drawing of Poteaux-en-Terre in the Beauvais House in Ste Genevieve MO.png|thumb|left|Drawing of Poteaux-en-Terre in the [[Amoureux House|Beauvais-Amoureux House]] in Ste Genevieve, MO]]
A [[palisade]] is a series of vertical pales (stakes) driven or set into the ground to form a fence or barrier. Palisade construction is a palisade or the similar use of timbers set on a [[Sill plate|sill]]; an example in England being the original portion of the ancient [[Greensted Church]] and the early type of stave church known as a [[palisade church]]. It was common for Native Americans and Europeans to build a palisade as part of a fort or to protect a village. Palisade construction is alluded to as a method of building of early dwellings.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, Fiske. ''Domestic Architecture of the American Colonies and of the Early Republic''. New York: Dover Publications, 1966. 7. Print. quoting S. Smith. ''History of New Jersey'' 1765 and "The disposition of George Dunbar...", ''A state of the province of Georgia; attested upon oath in the Court of Savannah'' November 10, 1740. 7. print.&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of planting one end of a timber in the ground is called earthfast or [[post in ground]] construction which was a common way to build worldwide. A benefit of earthfast construction is the ground holds the posts from swaying which eliminates the need for bracing and anchors the structure to the ground. The French settlers called this carpentry ''en pieux'' or ''poteaux en terre''&lt;ref name="Whiffen" &gt;Whiffen, Marcus, and Frederick Koeper. ''American Architecture''. Volume 1: 1607-1860. Cambridge, MA: MIT, 1983. 25. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''log on end''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=06oaAAAAYAAJ Dwyer, Charles P. ''The Economic Cottage Builder: Or, Cottages for Men of Small Means'']. Buffalo: Wanzer, McKim, 1856. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of carpentry may not considered ''framing''. The French method of poteaux en terre was different than palisade construction in that the timbers were hewn two sides and spaced slightly apart with the gaps filled with a material called [[bousillage]]&lt;ref name="Whiffen"/&gt;

Palisade construction is similar in concept to vertical plank wall construction.

===Vertical Plank wall===
[[File:Wooden stave silo.jpg|thumb|Another concept in vertical plank construction is the ''wooden stave silo'': A collection of staves (planks) carefully fitted and ringed with iron bands to resist the load.]]
Vertical plank wall buildings are sometimes also called ''plank houses''. In Australia houses with vertical plank walls are called [[slab hut]]s and the technique is similar to the American counterpart except in America these buildings may be two stories.

Some plank-wall houses or [[creole cottage]]s in the New Orleans area are called ''bargeboard''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ajbarnesonline.blogspot.com/2011/01/new-orleans-bargeboard.html "New Orleans Bargeboard", a blog with several interior photos showing the vertical plank walls]&lt;/ref&gt; or ''flatboat board''&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Samuel, Roulhac Toledano, and Sally Kittredge Evans. ''New Orleans architecture, volume IV: the Creole faubourgs''. Gretna, La.: Pelican Pub. Co., 1974. 42. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; houses because the vertical planks used to build the walls were reused planks from barges ([[flatboat]]s) floated down the Mississippi River loaded with cargo and then broken up and the lumber sold. (Note the possibility of confusion with the different carpentry element called a [[bargeboard]]).

===Stacked plank and stacked board construction===
&lt;!--Stacked plank construction, Stacked board construction redirect here--&gt;
Another carpentry method which is sometimes called ''plank wall'', ''board wall'', ''plank-on-plank'', ''horizontal plank frame'' is the stacking of horizontal planks or boards to form a wall of solid lumber. Sometimes the planks were staggered or spaced apart to form keys for a coat of plaster. This method was recommended by [[Orson Squire Fowler]] for [[octagon house]]s in his book ''The Octagon House: A Home for All'' in 1848.&lt;ref name="Garvin"/&gt; Fowler mentions he had seen this wall type being built in central New York state while traveling in 1842.

===Box houses=== &lt;!-- Courtesy comment per [[MOS:LINK2SECT]:  the hatnote in [[Box house]], and the redirect [[Single-wall construction]] links here --&gt;

[[File:Row of shacks, 1906 earthquake in San Francisco.jpg|thumb|left|Over 5,000 relief cottages after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake were built using single-wall construction]]
Box houses (boxed house, box frame,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen B. Jordan. "Houses Without Frames: The Uncommon Technique of Plank Construction", ''Old House Journal'' vol XXI, n. 3. May/June 1993. 36-41. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; box and strip,&lt;ref&gt;[https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/cbb01 Willard B. Robinson, "BOX AND STRIP CONSTRUCTION,"] ''Handbook of Texas Online'' (https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/cbb01), accessed April 15, 2014. Uploaded on June 12, 2010. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; piano box, single-wall, board and batten, and many other names) have minimal framing in the corners and widely spaced in the exterior walls, but like the vertical plank wall houses, the vertical boards are structural.&lt;ref&gt;Noble, Allen George. ''Traditional buildings a global survey of structural forms and cultural functions''. London: I.B. Tauris ;, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of boxed construction is unknown. The term ''box-frame'' was used in a reconstruction manual in 1868 after the American Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aKQZAAAAYAAJ C. Thurston Chase. ''A Manual on School-houses and Cottages for the People of the South''.] 1868. Washington: Government Printing Office. 26-28. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Box house'' may also be a nickname for ''Classic Box'' or ''[[American Foursquare]]'' architectural styles in North America, and is also not to be confused with a general type of timber framing called a box frame.

A variation on boxed construction is used on the [[Wesleyan Grove]] cottage: cottages around Oak Bluffs (Cottage City), Martha’s Vineyard, Massachusetts are built of vertical, tongue and groove planks without battens usually in a gothic style. This method was “inspired by the tent frame construction”&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Ellen. ''City in the woods: the life and design of an American camp meeting on Martha's Vineyard''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1987. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; of the original "board tents" used for Methodist [[Camp Meeting]]s beginning in 1835.

===A-frame buildings===
An A-frame building has framing with little or no walls, the rafters join at the ridge forming an A shape. This is the simplest type of framing but has historically been used for inexpensive cottages and farm shelters until the [[A-frame house]] was popularized in the 1950s as a style of vacation home in the United States.

===Inside-out framing===
Inside-out framing has the sheathing boards or planks on the inside of the framing.&lt;ref&gt;Vlach, John Michael. ''Barns''. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co.;, 2003. 338. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of structure was used for structures intended to contain bulk materials like ore, grain or coal.

===Plank-framed barns===
[[File:Ladviks gård 2013 11.jpg|thumb|A type of trussed plank frame barn in Sweden is representative of some types in America, the lack of heavy timbers in the framing give it the name ''plank frame barn''.]]
''Plank-framed barns''&lt;ref&gt;Radford, William A., and Alfred S. Johnson. ''Framing; a practical manual of approved up-to-date methods of house framing and construction, together with tested methods of heavy timber and plank framing as used in the construction of barns, factories, stores, and public buildings; strength of timbers; and principles of roof and bridge trusses''.. Chicago, Ill.: The Radford architectural Co., 1909. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; are different than a plank-framed house. Plank framed barns developed in the American Mid-West, such as the patente in 1876 (#185,690) by William Morris and Joseph Slanser of La Rue, Ohio shows (several other patents followed). Sometimes they were also called a ''joist frame'', ''rib frame'' and ''trussed frame'' barns. Built of a “Construction in which none of the material used is larger than 2 inches thick.”&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Deane G., and W. A. Foster. ''Farm buildings''. 3. ed. New York: Whiley and Sons, 1948. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than solid timbers. The reduction in availability of timber for barn building and experience with scantling framing resulted in the development of this lightweight barn framing using planks (“joists”) rather than timbers. Some stated advantages: cheaper, faster, no interior posts needed, use any length lumber, less skill, less lumber (either purchased or self-produced), “stronger”, lighter, all lumber can be purchased from a lumber yard, less labor, heavy timber getting scarce. Also, they were often similar to the Jennings barn design of 1879 (patent #218,031) with no tie beam so there were no beams to interfere with a hay fork (horse fork) on a track system (hay carrier) for pitching hay which became popular c. 1877. The gambrel roof shape lends itself to plank truss construction and became the most popular roof type. Plank frame barns were available by mail-order by 1910 from Chicago.  Syn joist-frame, Shawver plank-frame and Wing plank-frame.  “In large construction, such as barn framing, there are two general systems, the braced, pin-joint frame, made of heavy timbers, and the plank frame, made up of two inch planking, either in the form of the ‘plank truss’ or the ‘balloon frame.’” (Architectural Drawing and Design of Farm Structures, 1915)

==Types of structural roof carpentry==

===Timber roof trusses===

===Plank framed trusses===
[[File:Nash4.JPG|thumb|A variation of a plank framed truss with metal plate connectors on a [[pole barn]]]]
Plank framed truss was the name for roof trusses made with planks rather than [[timber roof trusses]]. In the 20th century it was typical for carpenters to make their own trusses by nailing planks together with wood plates at the joints. Today similar trusses are manufactured to engineering standards and use [[truss connector plate]]s.

==Types of structural floor carpentry==

===Single and double floor timber framing===
In timber framing a ''single floor'' is a floor framed with single set of joists. A ''double floor'' is generally used for longer spans and joists, called bridging beams or joists, are supported by other beams called binding beams: the two layers of timbers providing the name double floor. In a double floor there may be two sets of joists, one for the floor above and one for the ceiling below.

===Plank and beam construction===
'''Plank and beam''' construction or framing is a type of framing with no joists but widely spaced beams spanned by heavy planks. This method developed in the early 19th century for industrial mill floors but may also be found in timber framed roofs. Also known as '''Slow burning construction''', '''mill construction''', and heavy timber construction originated in industrial [[Sawmill|mills]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The joists are eliminated by the use of heavy planks saving time and strength of the timbers because the joists notches were eliminated. The beams are spaced {{convert|4|ft|m}} to {{convert|18|ft|m}} apart and the planks are {{convert|2|in|cm}} or more thick possibly with another layer of {{convert|1|in|cm}} on the top as the finished flooring could span these distances. The planks may be laid flat and [[tongue and groove]]d or splined together or laid on edge called a ''laminated floor''.&lt;ref name="Dewell" &gt;Dewell, Henry Dievendorf. ''Timber framing''. San Francisco: Dewey Pub. Co., 1917. 207. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''slow burning construction'' was coined in 1870&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Betsy H.. ''The works: the industrial architecture of the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. 127. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Factory Mutual]] insurance company&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationtech.com/RL's%20resume&amp;%20pub's/RL-publications/Milltowns/2013-ICSA-TimberMiniSymp-Keynote/LANGENBACHSlowBurningKEYNOTE.pdf Randolph Langenbach "Better than Steel? (Part 2): Tall Wooden Factories and the Invention of “Slow-burning” Heavy Timber Construction"]&lt;/ref&gt; because large, smooth timbers with [[chamfer]]ed edges ignite slower and last longer in a fire allowing fire suppression crews more time to extinguish a fire. These beams are designed to be self-releasing in case of fire, that is if they burn through and collapse the connection with the masonry wall and joint at the post should allow the beam to fall away without pulling the wall or post down.&lt;ref name="Dewell"/&gt; A common way to join a beam and a masonry wall in this regard is a [[fire cut]], an angled cut on the end of the beam.&lt;ref&gt;Brannigan, Francis L., and Glenn P. Corbett. ''Brannigan's building construction for the fire service''. 4th ed. Sudbury, MA: National Fire Protection Association :, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other wooden structures==
Other wooden structures do not necessarily have names for types of carpentry, but deserve mention. Carpenters were needed to build a variety of durable or temporary wooden structures such as a [[falsework]] and many other [[non-building structure]]s.

==Traditional carpentry tools==
Square, saw, hammer, and a rule are the essentials for any carpenter old or new.

'''CeCILL''' (from '''CEA CNRS INRIA Logiciel Libre''') is a [[free software license]] adapted to both international and French legal matters, in the spirit of and retaining [[License compatibility|compatibility]] with the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL).

It was jointly developed by a number of [[France|French]] agencies: the ''[[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique]]'' (Atomic Energy Commission), the ''[[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]]'' (National Centre for Scientific Research) and the ''[[Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique]]'' (National Institute for Research in Computer Science and Control). It was announced on 5 July 2004 in a joint press communication of the CEA, CNRS and INRIA.

It has gained support of the main French [[Linux User Group]] and the Minister of Public Function, and was considered for adoption at the [[Europe]]an level before the [[European Union Public Licence]] was created.

== Terms ==

The CeCILL grants users the right to copy, modify, and distribute the licensed software freely. It defines the rights as passing from the copyright holder to a "Licensor", which may be the copyright holder or a further distributor, to the user or "Licensee". Like the GPL, it requires that modifications to the software be distributed under the CeCILL, but it makes no claim to work that executes in "separate address spaces", which may be licensed under terms of the licensee's choice. It does not grant a patent license (as some other common open-source licenses do), but rather includes a promise by the licensor not to enforce any patents it owns. In Article 9.4, the licensor agrees to provide "technical and legal assistance" if litigation regarding the software is brought against the licensee, though the extent of the assistance "shall be decided on a case-by-case basis...pursuant to a memorandum of understanding".

The disclaimers of warranty and liability are written in a manner different from other common open-source licenses in order to comply with French law.&lt;ref&gt;https://cecill.info/faq.en.html#pourquoi-cecill&lt;/ref&gt; The CeCILL does not preclude the licensor from offering a warranty or technical support for its software, but requires that such services be negotiated in a separate agreement.

The license is compatible with the GPL through an explicit relicensing clause.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#CeCILL&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 13's explicit reference to French law and a French court does not limit users, who can still choose a jurisdiction of their choice by mutual agreement to solve any litigation they may experience. The explicit reference to a French court will be used only if mutual agreement is not possible; this immediately solves the problem of competence of laws (something that the GPL does not solve cleanly, except when all parties in a litigation are in the USA).

== Versions ==
Version 2 was developed after consultations with the French-speaking Linux and Free Software Users' Association, the ''Association pour la Promotion et la Recherche en Informatique Libre'', and the [[Free Software Foundation]]; it was released on 21 May 2005. According to the CeCILL FAQ there are no major differences in spirit, though there are in terms.

The most notable difference in CeCILL v2 is the fact that the English text was approved not as a draft translation (as in CeCILL v1) but as an authentic text, in addition to the equally authentic French version. This makes the CeCILL license much easier to enforce internationally, as the cost of producing an authentic translation in any international court will be lower with the help of a second authentic reference text. The second difference is that the reference to the GNU General Public License, with which CeCILL v2 is now fully compatible, is explicitly defined precisely using its exact title and the exact name of the Free Software Foundation, to avoid all possible variations of the terms of the GPL v2. Some additional definitions were added to more precisely define the terms with less ambiguity. With these changes, the CeCILL is now fully enforceable according to [[WIPO]] rules, and according to French law in courts, without the legal problems remaining in GPL version 2 outside the United States.

Version 2.1 was released in June 2013. It allows relicensing to the GNU [[Affero General Public License]] and the [[European Union Public License]] as well as the GPL, and clarifies the language that requires licensees to give access to the source code (which had previously caused rejection of version 2.0 by the Open Source Initiative&lt;ref&gt;http://osdir.com/ml/licenses.open-source.general/2005-09/msg00193.html&lt;/ref&gt;).

== International protection and approbation of the CeCILL licenses ==
Note that CeCILL v1 already allowed replacing a CeCILL v1 license by CeCILL v2, so all software previously licensed with CeCILL v1 in 2004 can be licensed with CeCILL v2, with legal terms enforceable as authentic not only in French but in English too.

The fact that it is protected by reputed public research centers (in France the INRIA, a founding member of the international W3 consortium, and the CEA working on atomic energy) which use them to publish their own open-source and free software, and by critical governmental organizations (which are also working in domains like military and defense systems) also gives much more security than using the GPL alone, as the license is supported officially by a government which is a full member of WIPO, and by an enforceable law. This also means that all international treaties related to the protection of intellectual rights do apply to CeCILL-licensed products, and so they are enforceable by law in all countries that signed any of the international treaties protected by WIPO. However, this also leaves open the possibility that the French government will make a future version of the CeCILL unfree and restricted.

The CeCILL license is approved as a "Free Software" license by the FSF with which the CeCILL project founders have worked. Since version 2.1, CeCILL is also approved by the Open Source Initiative as an "Open Source" license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cea Cnrs Inria Logiciel Libre License, version 2.1 (CECILL-2.1)|url=http://opensource.org/licenses/CECILL-2.1|work=Open Source Initiative|accessdate=2 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other CeCILL licenses ==
The CeCILL project also adds two other licenses:
* CeCILL-B, which is fully compatible with BSD-like licenses (BSD, X11, MIT) which have a strong attribution requirement (which goes much further than a simple copyright notice), a requirement normally not allowed by the GPL itself (which describes it as an advertising requirement), and so this license may be incompatible with the original CeCILL license, if BSD-like components are integrated, unless the software uses a dual-licensing scheme and conforms to the licensing terms of all embedded components.
* CeCILL-C, for "component" software, which is fully compatible with the FSF's LGPL license.

These two licenses are also defined to make BSD-like and FSF's LGPL licenses enforceable internationally under WIPO rules.

== Origins and general applicability ==
Although the three CeCILL licenses were developed and used for strategic French research systems (in the domain of defense, space launching systems, medical research, meteorology/climatology, and various domains of fundamental or applied physics), they are made to be usable also by the general public or any other commercial or non-profit organization, including from other governments, simply because these software component need and use (or are integrated with) component software or systems which were initially released with an open-source or free license, and they are operated by organizations that also have a commercial status.

Without these licenses, such systems could not have been built and used, and protected legally against various international patent claims. Due to the huge cost of these French strategic systems, a very strong licensing scheme was absolutely necessary to help protecting these investments against illegitimate claims by other commercial third parties, and one of the first needs was to make the well-known open-source and free licenses fully compatible and protected under the French law and the many international treaties ratified by France.

'''Commercial Intelligence''' is the highest and most comprehensive form of legal, ethical [[open-source intelligence]] as practiced by diverse international and localized businesses.
'''Business intelligence''' is a mis-nomer for data mining and enterprise dashboards that present useful patterns or distillations of internal information to the executive.

==What is Commercial Intelligence?==
Commercial Intelligence (CI) is the process of defining, gathering, analyzing and distributing accurate and relevant intelligence regarding the products, customers, competitors, business environment and the organization itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Intelligence (CI)|url=https://www.kbmanage.com/concept/commercial-intelligence|website=www.kbmanage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This methodical program affects the organization’s tactics, decisions and operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kahaner|first1=Larry|title=Competitive Intelligence: How to Gather, Analyze, and Use Information to Move Your Business to the Top|date=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Who uses Commercial Intelligence?==
A 1998 study by the Futures Group, a Glastonbury, Connecticut-based consulting firm indicates that 82% of companies with annual revenues exceeding $10 billion and 60% of those with annual revenues exceeding $1 billion now have an organized intelligence system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Miller|first1=Stephan H.|last2=Bentley|first2=Samuel|journal=Competitive Intelligence Magazine|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most larger companies have specific departments devoted to Commercial Intelligence, mid-sized companies tend to hire Commercial Intelligence firms, and smaller business owners are more likely to do it themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Stephen H.|title=Competitive Intelligence -- An Overview|url=http://www.ventes-marketing.com/References/Intelligence%20concurrentielle/Articles/CI%20Overview.pdf|website=www.ventes-marketing.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==What Commercial Intelligence Could We Use?==
Commercial Intelligence can be obtained and analysed in various ways that include:
* Information on a supplier’s financial performance
* Political developments
* Economic indicators
* New product development
* Currency market movements
* Competitor performance
* New market entrants &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial Intelligence|url=https://www.cips.org/Documents/Resources/Knowledge%20Now/Commercial%20Intelligence.pdf|website=www.cips.org|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Primary Vs Secondary Intelligence==

===Primary Sources of Intelligence===
Primary sources of CI include:
* Speeches by executive managers concerning future strategies and tactics of the company and company literature shared at trade shows, conferences and other events.
* All forms of communication mediums such as TV, Radio, Business magazines, etc.
* Annual reports.
* Physical observations of activities.
* Conversations with internal sources known to be knowledgeable about the competitor's operations and decision making
* Conversation with ex-company employees
* Conversations with consultants or agencies of the company

===Secondary Sources of Intelligence===
Secondary sources of CI include:
* Articles and reviews created by someone outside the company concerning the company.
* Books about the company and/or the companies in the industry.
* Special studies, research papers and analyst reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Collecting Competitive Intelligence|url=http://www.exinfm.com/board/collecting_competitive_intelligence.htm|website=www.exinfm.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligence from both classifications can be found within the scope of open source intelligence (OSINT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Levy|first1=Joe|title=Primary Intelligence vs Secondary Intelligence|url=http://www.clearci.com/blog/bid/103774/Primary-Intelligence-vs-Secondary-Intelligence|website=www.clearci.com|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Commercial Intelligence Cycle==
Efficient and successful CI is a constant cycle that consists of 5 steps:
# '''Planning'''; deliberating with decision makers to discover their intelligence needs.
# '''Gathering'''; collecting activities that are conducted legally and ethically.
# '''Analysis'''; interpreting all the information gathered and assembling the suggested actions.
# '''Dissemination'''; presenting the findings to the decision makers
# '''Feedback'''; studying the decision makers’ responses and understanding their need for continued intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Herring|first1=Jan P.|title=What Is Intelligence Analysis?|journal=Competitive Intelligence Magazine|date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics in Commercial Intelligence==

===Ethical Challenges===

====''Misrepresentation''====
Misrepresentation in CI is a form of cyber engineering. It is the act of falsely identifying yourself and bluffing people into giving you information they probably would not have had your true identity been provided. In fact, misrepresentation is the most common issue that subdivides numerous CI practitioners in many unclear ethical issues. The most common types of misrepresentation include:
# Excluding specific details in one’s identity: Lying about one’s identity in order to gain access to certain information is known to be unethical amongst CI practitioners. However, there is a thin line between lying about one’s identity and omitting certain details about it. Some practitioners believe that it is acceptable to deliberately skip over some details to obtain information. For example: Person X is both a part-time student as well as a director to a large company. As part of a school assignment, X is expected to collect information about a company that just so happens to be one of X’s employer’s biggest competitors. In this case, it is believed by some CI practitioners that not revealing the fact that X works for the company in addition to being a part-time student is completely ethical. In other words, X is misleading the competitor into thinking the information given to him will be used to complete a school assignment and nothing more, although in reality he would be gathering commercial intelligence to present to his employer. However, these types of situations raise some ethical concerns because the competitor may not have provided certain information knowing X works for a direct competitor. The competitor was not lied to, but deliberately misled in order to give out specific information about the company.
# Overhearing classified information: Some CI practitioners believe that if you overhear a competitor’s conversation in a public venue, then the information discussed that was previously classified becomes ethical for you to use to your advantage. They believe that it is not necessary to reveal their identity since the conversation occurred in an open and public place, and it is in fact the competitors’ fault that their information has been leaked because they should have been more aware or their surroundings and been more secure with their information. On the other hand, some argue that the CI practitioners are at fault because they deliberately planned on being in those surroundings in hopes to overhear some information, which raises concerns on the ethics of the matter.
# Not Disclosing true intent on how information will be used: Many CI practitioners are paid by their clients to get as much information about their competitors. In order to do so, they would survey the competitors and suggest to them that they are simply collecting industry information, all the while not revealing who they are working for, thus, not disclosing the true intent on how the information gathered is going to be used.
All 3 misrepresentation issues share a common theme, which is: “What is the intent of the CI practitioner?”. Judging by a person’s intent, we can conclude whether or not the situation is ethical or non-ethical.

====''Client Conflict''====
Client conflict means any situation in which a practitioner is faced with a conflict of interest between a former and current client. The practitioner must attempt to determine how to act in the best interests of several clients in the same or substantially related matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stevens|first1=Sylvia|title=Former Client Conflicts|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of situation usually arises with CI practitioners who are consultants. However, a clear solution is obvious; the practitioners agree that they should never service competing clients at the same time in order to keep classified information secure. In addition, another conflict may arise in the CI consultant and client relationship. The client usually hires the consultant to gather as much information about their competitors. However, there is an ethical issue concerning the length in which a consultant would go in order to retrieve the required information; how much is too much? When the consultant ignores the cost at which they are seeking this information, they tend to stumble upon various ethical issues, and it is in fact these ethical issues which the clients don’t want to be associated with that push them to hiring a CI consultant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Trevino|first1=Linda|last2=Weaver|first2=Gary|title=Ethical Issues in Competitive Intelligence Practice: Consensus, Conflicts, and Challenges|journal=Competitive Intelligence Review|date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cases of Organizations accused of Unethical CI Practices===

====''[[Oracle Corporation]]''====
In 2000, Oracle Corporation hired a detective agency to investigate two research groups that supported [[Microsoft]] during the antitrust trial. After attempting to buy garbage, the agency discovered that those two research groups were falsely identifying themselves as independent advocacy groups when they were in reality funded by Microsoft. Oracle and the hired detective agency may have acted in questionable matters to obtain that information, but they believe that the outcome justifies their actions. [[Larry Ellison]], Oracle’s chairman, says: “I feel very good about what we did. […] Maybe our investigation organization may have done things unsavoury, but it's not illegal. We got the truth out.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Wylie|title=Oracle chief defends Microsoft snooping|url=http://www.cnet.com/search/?query=Oracle+chief+defends+Microsoft+snooping|website=www.cnet.com|date=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''[[WestJet]]''====
In May 2004, [[Air Canada]] filed a $5 million corporate-espionage lawsuit against WestJet after discovering that their rival had hacked into Air Canada’s internal employee-only website over 243,000 times in a period of 10 months. WestJet used the confidential information it found to rearrange its load schedules as well as adjust routes and it significantly reduced service from the Hamilton airport and increased service in Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Teel|first1=Gina|title=Founding member to depart from WestJet|date=2007|url=http://www.calgaryherald.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; WestJet later issued a rare apology to its rival and [[Robert Milton]], the chief executive of parent [[ACE Aviation Holdings|ACE Aviation Holdings Inc]], admitting that its actions of online snooping "were both unethical and unacceptable" and ended paying AirCanada $15.5-million in legal fees as well as donating $10-million to children's charities in the names of both airlines. Moreover, Hill, one of the founders of WestJet later resigned from his position as vice-president of strategic planning in July 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=6138fbd4-c3db-44ca-83a7-bfb6bcc0cbdb|title=WestJet apologizes to Air Canada for snooping|last1=Ratner|first1=Jonathan|date=2006|website=www.canada.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304214910/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=6138fbd4-c3db-44ca-83a7-bfb6bcc0cbdb|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''[[Hewlett-Packard]]''====
In 2005, HP filed a lawsuit against its former VP, [[Karl-Heinz Kamp|Karl Kamp]], for $100 million, claiming Kamp had betrayed the company and appropriated its trade secrets as well as its money to start up his own flat-panel-TV company, as he was working on the TV project for HP. In January 2007. Kamb filed a countersuit. Not only did he deny stealing trade secrets but also claimed that HP was aware of what he had done with its money. He claimed that HP had asked him to gather classified information on [[Dell]], whose entry into printers had threatened HP's most profitable line of business. In 2002, the CI unit hired Katsumi Iizuka, former president of Dell Japan until 1995, sold HP information on Dell’s plans to enter the printer business. The information they gathered revolved around printer models, specifications, terms and prices, many months before their launch. Further more, HP was accused of pretexting, which is the act of lying about one's identity to obtain privileged data and information, in order to obtain Kamb’s private phone records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varchaver|first1=Nicholas|title=A pretext for revenge|url=http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/06/11/100060613/index.htm?postversion=2007053113|website=www.fortune.com|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals==

===Historic Development===
The Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals is one of the only global membership organizations in the rapidly growing field of competitive intelligence and business strategy. SCIP is a global not-for-profit association whose 7,000 members conduct competitor research and analysis for large and small companies, and help manage planning competitive strategy. Established in 1986 in Washington DC, it is currently headquartered in Alexandria, Virginia. It focuses on enhancing the success of its members through education, leadership, support and networking. Since 1986, SCIP has developed drastically and globally, and has, today, chapters all around the world as well as alliance partnerships with numerous independent affiliate organis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategy, Market &amp; Ccompetitive Intelligence|url=https://www.scip.org/|website=www.scip.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; ations. On July 8, 2010 the SCIP Board of Directors voted to officially change the 25-year-old non-profit organisation's name from "Society of Competitive Intelligence Professionals" to "Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexandria|first1=Va|title=SCIP Changes Name to Strategic and Competitive Intelligence Professionals|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/scip-changes-name-to-strategic-and-competitive-intelligence-professionals-100524874.html|website=www.prnewswire.com|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapters Overview===
SCIP Chapters are the best way for members to build relationships within the competitive intelligence discipline in their area. Its event are open for anyone to attend, become involved, and enjoy the benefits of programming and networking. The SCIP offers many opportunities to its members including exceptional educational and networking experiences with leading industry experts, as well as opportunities to increase knowledge by gaining access to rare and distinctive practices, tools and publications. In addition, the SCIP offers Collegiate Chapters for students who show interest in the world of commercial and competitive intelligence. Participant students in the Collegiate Chapter are offered training and education programs that represent unique opportunities for professional advancement. They are also benefitting exceptionally in terms of leadership skills, career development and indispensable CI know-how. Also, the SCIP awards mentoring programs and scholarships to students who deem prominent, promising and capable business students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCIP Chapter Overview|url=https://www.scip.org/ChaptersOverview.php|website=www.scip.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethics===
Economic espionage represents a failure of Commercial Intelligence, which uses open sources and other forms of ethical inquiry. Importantly, SCIP mandates that all this be done within a strictly ethical framework, which is why it has agreed upon a code of ethics;
* To continually strive to increase the recognition and respect of the profession.
* To comply with all applicable laws, domestic and international.
* To accurately disclose all relevant information, including one's identity and organization, prior to all interviews.
* To avoid conflicts of interest in fulfilling one's duties.
* To provide honest and realistic recommendations and conclusions in the execution of one's duties.
* To promote this code of ethics within one's company, with third-party contractors and within the entire profession.
* To faithfully adhere to and abide by one's company policies, objectives and guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCIP Code of Ethics for CI Professionals|url=https://www.scip.org/CodeOfEthics.php|website=www.scip.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Crop Trust''', officially known as the '''Global Crop Diversity Trust''', is an [[international organization|international]] [[nonprofit organization]] which works to preserve [[crop diversity]] in order to protect global [[food security]]. It was established through a partnership between the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] and [[Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research|CGIAR]] acting through [[Bioversity International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/newsroom/en/news/2004/51211/index.html|title=Crop Trust to conserve plant diversity|website=www.fao.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In 2006, the Crop Trust entered into an agreement with the governing body of the [[International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture]]. The agreement recognises the Crop Trust as an "essential element" of the treaty's funding strategy in regards to the ''ex situ'' conservation and availability of [[plant genetics resources]] for food and agriculture. It also confirms the autonomy of the Crop Trust as a scientific organization in raising and disbursing funds.

The Crop Trust is assembling an [[Financial endowment|endowment fund]], the income from which will be used to support the conservation of distinct and important [[crop diversity]], in perpetuity, through existing institutions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://agfundernews.com/the-crop-trust-raises-300m-of-850m-target-to-safeguard-biodiversity5854.html|title=The Crop Trust Raises $300m of $850m Target to Safeguard Global Biodiversity - AgFunderNews|date=2016-05-17|newspaper=AgFunderNews|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crop diversity is the biological foundation of agriculture, and is the [[raw material]] [[plant breeder]]s and farmers use to adapt crop varieties to [[Pest (organism)|pests]] and [[diseases]]. In the future, this crop diversity will play a central role in helping agriculture adjust to climate change and adapt to water and energy constraints.

==Management==

The Crop Trust has its offices in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]], after relocating there from [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. The executive board is chaired by [[Tim Fischer]] (Australia). The Crop Trust Trust also has a Donors' Council, chaired by Jaap Satter (Netherlands). As of May 2016 the organization had raised approximately US$300 million for its endowment.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Main donors include: Australia, Canada, Germany, Ireland, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the [[Grains Research and Development Corporation]] (Australia). A number of developing countries have also provided support, including Egypt, Ethiopia and India. Further contributions have been received from private corporations, foundations, industry associations, and from private individuals. 

[[Åslaug Haga]], a Norwegian politician who was chairperson of the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Centre Party]] from 2003 to 2008, took over as executive director from [[Cary Fowler]] in 2013.

==Grants==

Since its establishment, the Crop Trust has funded work in over 80 countries, and made its  first grant for long-term conservation of a collection in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scidev.net/en/news/indefinite-funding-safeguards-biodiversity-of-ri.html|title='Indefinite funding' safeguards biodiversity of rice|last=SciDev.Net|newspaper=SciDev.Net|access-date=2017-02-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2011, the Crop Trust had established in-perpetuity support (i.e. grants funded through the Crop Trust's endowment) for collections of 15 crops: [[rice]], [[cassava]], [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[faba bean]], [[pearl millet]], [[maize]], [[Forage crops|forages]], [[banana]], [[Araceae|aroids]], [[grass pea]], [[sorghum]], [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] and [[lentil]]. 

In 2007, the Crop Trust began a global initiative to rescue threatened, high-priority collections of crop diversity in developing countries and to support information systems to improve their conservation and availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/science/earth/19farm.ready.html|title=Global Effort to Save Endangered Crops Gets $37.5 Million Infusion|last=Revkin|first=Andrew C.|date=2007-04-19|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-26|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These efforts included providing support to developing countries and international agricultural research centers to deposit shipments of seed samples in the [[Svalbard Global Seed Vault]] for safety duplication purposes. 

In 2010, the Crop Trust launched a global 10-year program to find, gather, catalog and save the [[crop wild relative|wild relatives]] of 22 major food crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9273000/9273567.stm|title=BBC - Earth News - Wild food crop relatives to be 'rescued'|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2017-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These wild species contain untapped diversity to help address future challenges to agriculture.

== Svalbard Global Seed Vault==

The Crop Trust joined the [[Government of Norway]] and the [[Nordic Gene Bank]] in the 2008 establishment of the [[Svalbard Global Seed Vault]], a "[[fail-safe]]" facility located at [[Svalbard]], Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1852747_1854195_1854118,00.html|title=Best Inventions of 2008 - #6.

The Vault has also been touted as providing a means for restoring agriculture in the event of a [[global catastrophe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/health/article/0,8599,1882288,00.html|title=The Planet's Ultimate Backup Plan: Svalbard|last=Walsh|first=Bryan|date=2009-02-27|work=Time|access-date=2017-03-09|issn=0040-781X}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is designed to hold the seeds of some 4.5 million samples of different varieties of agricultural [[crops]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7217821.stm|title='Doomsday' seeds arrive in Norway|last=|first=|date=|website=news.bbc.co.uk|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cybertill''' is a [[cloud-based]] retail software provider, which incorporates [[point of sale]] (commonly referred to as EPoS), [[ecommerce]], [[stock control]], [[Customer relationship management|CRM]], Merchandising and Warehousing modules. Cybertill’s headquarters are in [[Knowsley, Merseyside|Knowsley]], near Liverpool, in the UK. The company is privately owned and funded by Merseyside Investment Fund (MSIF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msif.co.uk "Merseyside Investment Fund"]&lt;/ref&gt; and employs over 100 people.

==History==
Cybertill was founded by current CEO Ian Tomlinson&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybertill.co.uk/about-2/directors-profile "Cybertill: The Management Team."]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2001. Its software offering consisted of EPoS, ecommerce and mail order systems delivered over an internet connection (referred to as cloud-based software). In late 2001 Cybertill secured funding from Merseyside Investment Fund (MSIF). Cybertill claims to be the world’s first cloud based EPoS and ecommerce system.

Cybertill’s first customer was a bike shop in York in 2001. By 2014, according to the company’s website, there are over 650 retailers using its system.

The company says it is currently migrating users to its latest iteration of its software entitled Retail Store.

In 2014 Cybertill announced it was developing new supply chain modules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cybertill.co.uk/news/cybertill-to-deliver-end-to-end-enterprise-cloud-solution-for-multi-channel-retailers.php "Cybertill to deliver end-to-end enterprise cloud solution for multi-channel retailers"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703124141/http://www.cybertill.co.uk/news/cybertill-to-deliver-end-to-end-enterprise-cloud-solution-for-multi-channel-retailers.php |date=2014-07-03 }} Cybertill&lt;/ref&gt; These are merchandising and warehousing.

==Features==
Cybertill is a cloud based retail system which incorporates EPoS, ecommerce and mail order applications. These modules allow retailers to carry out the following tasks such as stock control, ordering, managing promotions and loyalty programmes.

Cybertill also supplies a charity retail system,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charitystore.co.uk "Cybertill Charity Retail System"]&lt;/ref&gt; this includes an additional module for [[gift aid]] software. This enables charity retailers to claim gift aid on donated goods.

As well as having its own proprietary ecommerce platform, Cybertill claims that it can integrate with a variety of third party ecommerce platforms such as [[Magento]].

A '''decorticator''' (from [[Latin]]: ''cortex'', bark) is a machine for stripping the skin, [[Bark (botany)|bark]], or rind off nuts, wood, plant stalks, grain, etc., in preparation for further processing.

==History==

In 1861, a farmer named Bernagozzi from [[Bologna]] manufactured a machine called a''"scavezzatrice"'', a decorticator for [[hemp]].&lt;ref name="rananlli"&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/t457t43813156h33/ Paolo Ranalli and Gianpietro Venturi: Hemp as a raw material for industrial applications, Euphytica, Euphytica 140: 1–6, 2004.]&lt;/ref&gt; A working hemp decorticator from 1890, manufactured in Germany, is preserved in a museum in Bologna.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hempology.org/DECORTICATORS/1890%20DECORT.html Picture of an 1890 GERMAN DECORTICATOR at Museo Della Civilta Contadina, San Marino Di Bentivoglio, Bologna, Italy.]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Misconceptions about early versions of the device include the suggestion that the first working hemp decorticator was invented in the [[United States]] in 1935. In 1916, there were already five different kinds of ''"machine brakes"'' for hemp in use in the [[United States]], and still others in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/17855/17855-h/17855-h.htm Lyster H. Dewey: HEMP HURDS AS PAPER-MAKING MATERIAL. UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE, BULLETIN No. 404, 1916]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the''"scavezzatrice"'' faded in the 1950s because of monopolisation from fossil fuel, paper interests, synthetic materials and from other less profitable crops.

Many types of decorticators have been developed since 1890.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.se/images?hl=sv&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;hs=YFj&amp;rls=org.mozilla:sv-SE:official&amp;q=decorticator&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;source=univ&amp;ei=5ksOTZTnGYWs8gPmmtyCBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=image_result_group&amp;ct=title&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4QsAQwAQ&amp;biw=1048&amp;bih=458 Pictures of many decorticators in Internet]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, George Schlichten  received a U.S. [[patent]] on his improvements of the decorticator for treating fiber bearing plants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hempology.org/DECORTICATORS/1919%3B%20SCHLICHTEN%27S%20DECORT.HTML  George W Schlichten, 1919]&lt;/ref&gt; Schlichten failed to find investors for production of his decorticator and died in 1923, a broken man.&lt;ref&gt;[http://userpages.bright.net/~fixit/history5.htm History of hemp prohibition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=V|first=Johansen John|title=Control mechanism for decorticating machines|date=Mar 1, 1949|url=http://www.google.com/patents/US2463278|inventor-last=V|inventor2-last=C|inventor-first=Johansen John|inventor2-first=Westergaard Carl|last2=C|first2=Westergaard Carl|issue=US2463278 A|accessdate=2017-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current usage==

Even though many suppliers claim the "full-automatic" type for their decorticating units, the actual operation identifies the "semi-automatic" features by several stops during operation.

There are companies who produce and sell decorticators for different crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oilmillmachinery.com/decorticator.html IndiaMART InterMESH Limited; Decorticators]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Depssi''' card ([[Depth of field]], sunrise, sunset indicator) is a handy guide/reference card that has two functions; it enables the outdoor [[photographer]] to quickly select the [[hyperfocal distance]] for different lenses (or [[zoom lens|zoom]] settings) using various [[aperture]]s. On the reverse side of the card there are the angles/positions of sunrise and sunset for every month.

The card is made in a durable plastic suitable for prolonged use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7797">[[Image:Diagnostic Medical Dipstick.png|thumb|300px|A schematic diagram of an average diagnostic dipstick]]
A '''dipstick''' is one of several measurement devices.

Some dipsticks are dipped into a liquid to perform a chemical test or to provide a measure of quantity of the liquid.

Since the late 20th century, a flatness/levelness measuring device trademarked "Dipstick" has been used to produce concrete and pavement surface profiles and to help establish profile measurement standards in the concrete floor and paving industries.

== Testing dipstick ==

A testing dipstick is usually made of paper or cardboard and is impregnated with reagents that indicate some feature of the liquid by changing color. In [[medicine]], dipsticks can be used to test for a variety of liquids for the presence of a given substance, known as an [[analyte]].&lt;ref name=Paek2000&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[urine test strip|urine dipsticks]] are used to test [[urine]] samples for [[haemoglobin]], [[nitrite]] (produced by bacteria in a [[urinary tract infection]]), [[protein]], [[nitrocellulose]], [[glucose]] and occasionally [[urobilinogen]] or [[ketone]]s.&lt;ref name="Yetisen2013"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yetisen A.

They are usually brightly coloured, and extremely rough to touch.

== Measuring dipstick ==

[[File:Engine oil dipstick.JPG|thumb|left|A dipstick for measuring the level of motor oil inside a car engine.]] 
Dipsticks can also be used to measure the quantity of liquid in an otherwise inaccessible space, by inserting and removing the stick and then checking the extent of it covered by the liquid. The most familiar example is the oil level dipstick found on most internal combustion engines.

Other kinds of dipsticks are used to measure everything from fuel levels to the amount of beer left in an [[cask ale|ale]] [[cask]] ([[English brewery cask units#Firkin|Firkin]]).

==Floor &amp; pavement profiler==

"Dipstick" is the trade name of a profiling device manufactured by Face Construction Technologies of Norfolk, Virginia USA.&lt;ref name = Dip&gt;[http://www.Dipstick.com  Face® Dipstick® website home page]&lt;/ref&gt;  The instrument is used in 65 countries on six continents to measure the flatness and levelness of concrete floor slabs and pavements.&lt;ref name= Dip /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umtri.umich.edu/content/LittleBook98R.pdf  The Little Book of Profiling; Sayers, Michael W. and Karamihas, Steven M.; The Regent of the University of Michigan, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dipstick measures concrete floor slab flatness/levelness in terms of Face Floor Profile Numbers ("F-Numbers"), a profile measurement system adopted in 1990 by the [[American Concrete Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.concrete.org/FAQ/afmviewfaq.asp?faqid=24  Technical Questions: "What are F-numbers?" - ACI Concrete Knowledge Center]&lt;/ref&gt;  F-Number measurement procedures were established by [[ASTM]] Standard E1155.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astm.org/Standards/E1155.htm ASTM E1155 - 96(2008) Standard Test Method for Determining FF Floor Flatness and FL Floor Levelness Numbers]&lt;/ref&gt;  The instrument also measures TR-34 Free Movement (FM); TR-34 Defined Movement (DM); Gap under Sliding Unleveled Straightedge; Gap under Rolling Straightedge; and DIN 18202.&lt;ref name= Dip /&gt;

The U.S. [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/ltpp/pubs/08056/appende.cfm FHWA Manual for Profile Measurements and Processing, March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[World Bank]] (with its [[International Roughness Index]]... or "IRI")&lt;ref&gt;[http://pavementinteractive.org/index.php?title=Roughness PavementInteractive.org: "Roughness"]&lt;/ref&gt; have established measurement procedures using Dipstick profiler data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dipstick.com/road-profiler-info/  Face® Dipstick® website road profiler page]&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ([[AASHTO]]) has established its Standard R 41 (most recently published as R 41-05 (2010)) to, "... manually collect precision profile data utilizing the Face Technologies Dipstick. The instrument measures profiles (relative elevation differences) at a rate and accuracy greater than traditional rod and level surveys. Procedures for measuring both longitudinal and transverse profiles are described."&lt;ref&gt;[https://bookstore.transportation.org/item_details.aspx?source=GSA&amp;ID=649&amp;Title=Standard%20Practice%20for%20Measuring%20Pavement%20Profile%20Using%20a%20Dipstick%c2%ae,%20Single%20User%20Digital%20Publication AASHTO R 41-05 - 2010 Standard Practice for Measuring Pavement Profile Using a Dipstick]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dipstick, with a reported accuracy of .01&amp;nbsp;mm ( 0.0004 inches), measures "true" profiles &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NwAnAQAAMAAJ Measurements, specifications, and achievement of smoothness for pavement construction; James H. Woodstrom, National Research Council (U.S.), Transportation Research Board, Page 10]&lt;/ref&gt; and is the most widely used and accepted Class 1 profiler for the purposes of calibrating other profilers.&lt;ref name = Dip /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpcb.org/index.php/component/docman/doc_view/11127-2006-nz-comparison-of-roughness-calibration-equipment-with-a-view-to-increased-confidence-in-network-level-data?Itemid=  Comparison of Roughness Calibration Equipment - with a View to Increased Confidence in Network Level Data; G. Morrow, A. Francis, S.B. Costello, R.C.M.

Dipstick was used to obtain data that were used as ground truth in FHWA evaluations of the repeatability of IRI values as measured by other profilers and in Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTTP) studies conducted by several states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/pavement/ltpp/pubs/05054/chapt3.cfm FHWA Profiler Comparison Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

The PIARC experiment was conducted in the USA, Japan, Holland and Germany and included IRI values from airport runways&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rahiran.ir/data/reports/reports1/dri/piarc%20world%20road%20association/Report_93.pdf International Experiment to Harmonise Longitudinal and Transverse Profile Measurement and Reporting Procedures Draft Report, Danish Road Institute, 1999, Page 21]&lt;/ref&gt; and super highways to rough unpaved roads.&lt;ref name= piarc /&gt;

A '''gene gun''' or a '''biolistic particle delivery system''', originally designed for [[plant]] [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]], is a device for delivering exogenous [[DNA]] ([[transgene]]s) to cells. The payload is an [[chemical element|elemental]] particle of a [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] coated with DNA (typically [[plasmid]] DNA). This technique is often simply referred to as '''biolistics'''.

This device is able to transform almost any type of cell, including plants, and is not limited to transformation of the nucleus; it can also transform organelles, including [[plastids]].

[[File:Gene Gun.svg|thumb|A gene gun is used for delivery of exogenous DNA to cells. This method is known as 'biolistics'.  Gene guns can be used effectively on most cells but are mainly used on plant cells. Step 1 The gene gun apparatus is ready to fire. Step 2 Helium fills the chamber and pressure builds against the rupture disk. Step 3 The pressure eventually reaches the point where the rupture disk breaks, and the resulting burst of helium propels the DNA/gold-coated macrocarrier ('Plastic Disk') into the stopping screen. Step 4 When the macrocarrier hits the stopping screen, the DNA-coated gold particles are propelled through the screen and into the target cells.]]

==Gene gun design==
The gene gun was originally a [[Crosman]] [[air gun|air pistol]] modified to fire dense [[tungsten]] particles. It was invented by [[John C Sanford]], Ed Wolf and Nelson Allen at [[Cornell University]],&lt;ref name="CornellChronicle"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/25239/1/018_33.pdf |title=Biologist invent gun for shooting cells with DNA |work=Cornell Chronicle |date=14 May 1987 |accessdate=5 June 2014 |author=Segelken, Roger |pages=3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029191933/http://www.ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/1813/25239/1/018_33.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sanford1987"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Delivery of substances into cells and tissues using a particle bombardment process | journal=Particulate Science and Technology | year=1987 | volume=5 | issue=1 | pages=27–37 | doi=10.1080/02726358708904533 | last1=Sanford | last2=Klein | last3=Wolf | last4=Allen | first1=J.C. | first2=T.M. | first3=E.D. | first4=N.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Klein1987"&gt;{{cite journal | title=High-velocity microprojectiles for delivering nucleic acids into living cells | journal=Nature |date=May 1987  | volume=327 | issue=6117 | pages=70–73 | doi=10.1038/327070a0 | last1=Klein | last2=Wolf | last3=Wu | last4=Sanford | first1=T.M. | first2=E.D. | first3=R. | first4=J.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ted Klein of DuPont, between 1983 and 1986.  The original target was onions (chosen for their large cell size) and it was used to deliver particles coated with a [[reporter gene|marker gene]].&lt;ref name="GeneShotgun"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cals.cornell.edu/cals/public/businesspartnerships/made/gene-shotgun.cfm | title=The Gene Shotgun | publisher=Cornell University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences | accessdate=5 June 2014 | author=Segelken, Roger | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100426054730/http://www.cals.cornell.edu/cals/public/businesspartnerships/made/gene-shotgun.cfm | archivedate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic transformation was then proven when the onion tissue [[gene expression|expressed]] the gene.

The earliest custom manufactured gene guns (fabricated by Nelson Allen) used a 22 caliber [[nail gun]] cartridge to propel an extruded [[polyethylene]] cylinder (bullet) down a 22 cal. Douglas barrel. A droplet of the tungsten powder and genetic material was placed on the bullet and shot down the barrel at a [[lexan]] "stopping" disk with a [[Petri dish]] below.  The bullet welded to the disk and the genetic material blasted into the sample in the dish with a doughnut effect (devastation in the middle, a ring of good transformation and little around the edge). The gun was connected to a vacuum pump and was under vacuum while firing.  The early design was put into limited production by a Rumsey-Loomis (a local machine shop then at Mecklenburg Rd in Ithaca, NY, USA). Later the design was refined by removing the "surge tank" and changing to nonexplosive propellants.  DuPont added a plastic extrusion to the exterior to visually improve the machine for mass production to the scientific community.  [[Biorad]] contracted with Dupont to manufacture and distribute the device. Improvements include the use of [[helium]] propellant and a multi-disk-collision delivery mechanism. Other heavy metals such as [[gold]] and [[silver]] are also used. Gold may be favored because it has better uniformity than tungsten and tungsten can be toxic to cells, but its use may be limited due to availability and cost.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Biolistic construct design ==
A [[DNA construct|construct]] is a piece of DNA inserted into the target's genome, including parts that are intended to be removed later.&lt;ref name="Plant Biotech" /&gt; All biolistic transformations require a construct to proceed and while there is great variation among biolistic constructs, they can be broadly sorted into two categories: those which are designed to transform [[Eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]], and those designed to transform [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]]-type genomes such as [[mitochondria]], [[plasmid]]s or [[plastid]]s.&lt;ref name="Plant Biotech" /&gt;

Those meant to transform prokaryotic genomes generally have the gene or genes of interest, at least one [[promoter (genetics)|promoter]] and [[terminator (genetics)|terminator]] sequence, and a [[reporter gene]]; which is a gene used to enable detection or removal of those cells which didn't integrate the construct into their DNA.&lt;ref name="Plant Biotech" /&gt; These genes may each have their own promoter and terminator, or be grouped to produce multiple gene products from one [[Transcription (genetics)|transcript]], in which case [[ribosomal binding site|binding sites for translational machinery]] should be placed between each to ensure maximum translational efficiency. In any case the entire construct is flanked by regions called border sequences which are similar in sequence to locations within the genome, this allows the construct to target itself to a specific point in the existing genome.&lt;ref name="Plant Biotech"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slater|first1=Adrian|last2=Scott|first2=Nigel|last3=Fowler|first3=Mark|title=Plant Biotechnology: the genetic manipulation of plants|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|location=Oxford, New York, USA|isbn=978-0-19-928261-6|edition=2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Constructs meant for integration into a eukaryotic nucleus follow a similar pattern except that: the construct contains no border sequences because the sequence rearrangement that prokaryotic constructs rely on rarely occurs in eukaryotes; and each gene contained within the construct must be expressed by its own copy of a promoter and terminator sequence.&lt;ref name="Plant Biotech" /&gt;

Though the above designs are generally followed, there are exceptions. For example, the construct might include a [[Cre-Lox recombination|Cre-Lox]] system to selectively remove inserted genes; or a prokaryotic construct may insert itself downstream of a promoter, allowing the inserted genes to be governed by a promoter already in place and eliminating the need for one to be included in the construct.&lt;ref name="Plant Biotech"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slater|first1=Adrian|last2=Scott|first2=Nigel|last3=Fowler|first3=Mark|title=Plant Biotechnology: the genetic manipulation of plants|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|location=Oxford, New York, USA|isbn=978-0-19-928261-6|edition=2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Gene guns are so far mostly used with plant cells. However, there is much potential use in humans and other animals as well.

===Plants===
The target of a gene gun is often a [[callus (cell biology)|callus]] of undifferentiated plant cells or a group of immature embryos growing on gel medium in a Petri dish. After the DNA-coated gold particles have been delivered to the cells, the DNA is used as a template for transcription (transient expression) and sometimes it integrates into a plant [[chromosome]] ('stable' transformation)

If the delivered DNA construct contains a selectable marker, then stably transformed cells can be selected and cultured using tissue culture methods. For example, if the delivered DNA construct contains a gene that confers resistance to an antibiotic or herbicide, then stably transformed cells may be selected by including that antibiotic or herbicide in the tissue culture media.

Transformed cells can be treated with a series of plant hormones, such as [[auxins]] and [[gibberellins]], and each may divide and differentiate into the organized, specialized, tissue cells of an entire plant. This capability of total re-generation is called [[totipotency]]. The new plant that originated from a successfully transformed cell may have new traits that are heritable. The use of the gene gun may be contrasted with the use of ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]'' and its [[Ti plasmid]] to insert DNA into plant cells. See [[Transformation (genetics)|transformation]] for different methods of transformation in different species.

===Humans and other animals===
Gene guns have also been used to deliver [[DNA vaccination|DNA vaccines]].

The delivery of plasmids into rat neurons through the use of a gene gun, specifically DRG neurons, is also used as a pharmacological precursor in studying the effects of neurodegenerative diseases such as [[Alzheimer's disease]].

The gene gun has become a common tool for labeling subsets of cells in cultured tissue.  In addition to being able to transfect cells with DNA plasmids coding for fluorescent proteins, the gene gun can be adapted to deliver a wide variety of vital dyes to cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pages=219–25 |doi=10.1016/S0896-6273(00)00031-3 |title=Multicolor "DiOlistic" Labeling of the Nervous System Using Lipophilic Dye Combinations |year=2000 |last1=Gan |first1=Wen-Biao |last2=Grutzendler |first2=Jaime |last3=Wong |first3=Wai Thong |last4=Wong |first4=Rachel O.L |last5=Lichtman |first5=Jeff W |journal=Neuron |volume=27 |issue=2 |pmid=10985343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gene gun bombardment has also been used to [[transformation (genetics)|transform]] ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', as an alternative to [[microinjection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1385/1-59745-151-7:93 |pmid=16988428 |year=2006 |last1=Praitis |first1=Vida |title=C.

==Advantages==
Biolistics has proven to be a versatile method of genetic modification and it is generally preferred to engineer transformation-resistant crops, such as [[cereals]]. Notably, [[Genetically modified maize#Insecticide-producing corn|''Bt'' maize]] is a product of biolistics.&lt;ref name="Plant Biotech"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slater|first1=Adrian|last2=Scott|first2=Nigel|last3=Fowler|first3=Mark|title=Plant Biotechnology: the genetic manipulation of plants|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press Inc.|location=Oxford, New York, USA|isbn=978-0-19-928261-6|edition=2}}&lt;!--|accessdate=16 October 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Plastid transformation has also seen great success with particle bombardment when compared to other current techniques, such as ''Agrobacterium'' mediated transformation, which have difficulty targeting the vector to and stably expressing in the chloroplast.&lt;ref name="Plant Biotech" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Journal plant transformation"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanford|first1=John|title=Biolistic plant transformation|journal=Physiologia Plantarum|date=April 28, 2006|volume=79|issue=1|pages=206–209|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.1990.tb05888.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are no reports of a chloroplast [[gene silencing|silencing]] a transgene inserted with a gene gun.&lt;ref name="Stable transformation journal"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Kikkert|first1=Julie|last2=Vidal|first2=Jose|last3=Reisch|first3=Bruce|title=Stable transformation of plant cells by particle bombardment/bioistics|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology|date=2005|volume=286|pages=61–78|doi=10.1385/1-59259-827-7:061|pmid=15310913|isbn=978-1-59259-827-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, with only one firing of a gene gun, a skilled technician can generate two transformed organisms.&lt;ref name="Journal plant transformation"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanford|first1=John|title=Biolistic plant transformation|journal=Physiologia Plantarum|date=April 28, 2006|volume=79|issue=1|pages=206–209|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.1990.tb05888.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technology has even allowed for modification of specific tissues ''in situ'', although this is likely to damage large numbers of cells and [[Mosaic (genetics)|transform only some]], rather than all, cells of the tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hayward|first1=M.D.|last2=Bosemark|first2=N.O.|last3=Romagosa|first3=T.|title=Plant Breeding: Principles and Prospects|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789401115247|page=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==

Biolistics introduces DNA randomly into the target cells. Thus the DNA may be transformed into whatever genomes are present in the cell, be they nuclear, mitochondrial, plasmid or any others, in any combination, though proper construct design may mitigate this. Another issue is that the gene inserted may be overexpressed when the construct is inserted multiple times in either the same or different locations of the genome.&lt;ref name="Plant Biotech" /&gt; This is due to the ability of the constructs to give and take genetic material from other constructs, causing some to carry no transgene and others to carry multiple copies; the number of copies inserted depends on both how many copies of the transgene an inserted construct has, and how many were inserted.&lt;ref name="Plant Biotech" /&gt; Also, because eukaryotic constructs rely on [[Exon shuffling#Illegitimate recombination|illegitimate recombination]], a process by which the transgene is integrated into the genome without similar genetic sequences, and not [[homologous recombination]], which inserts at similar sequences, they cannot be targeted to specific locations within the genome,&lt;ref name="Plant Biotech" /&gt; unless the transgene is co-delivered with [[genome editing]] reagents.

[[Image:TI-84 Plus graphing.jpg|thumb|A typical graphing calculator by [[Texas Instruments]]]]
A '''graphing calculator''' (also '''graphics / graphic display calculator''') is a [[handheld computer]] that is capable of plotting [[Graph of a function|graphs]], solving simultaneous [[equation]]s, and performing other tasks with [[variable (mathematics)|variables]]. Most popular graphing calculators are also [[programmable calculator|programmable]], allowing the user to create customized programs, typically for scientific/engineering and education applications. Because they have large displays in comparison to standard 4-operation handheld calculators, graphing calculators also typically display several lines of text and calculations at the same time.

== History ==
[[File:Casio fx-7000G Box&amp;Manual.JPG|220px|thumb|[[Casio fx-7000G]]; The world's first graphing calculator]]
An early "graphical calculator" was designed and patented by electrical engineer, [[Edith Clarke]], in 1925.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ge.com/reports/edith-clarke-mother-of-invention/|title=Mother Of Invention: This Barrier-Busting Electrical Engineer Joined Edison, Tesla in National Inventors Hall of Fame - GE Reports|last=Kellner|first=Tomas|date=2017-02-10|work=GE Reports|access-date=2018-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825185215/https://www.ge.com/reports/edith-clarke-mother-of-invention/|archive-date=25 August 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calculator was used to solve problems with electrical power line transmission.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.women.cs.cmu.edu/ada/Resources/Women/|title=Pioneering Women in Computer Technology|last=|first=|date=|website=The Ada Project|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326031002/https://www.women.cs.cmu.edu/ada/Resources/Women/|archive-date=26 March 2018|dead-url=|access-date=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Casio]] produced the first commercially available graphing calculator, the [[Casio fx-7000G|fx-7000G]], in 1985. Casio's innovations include an icon menu for easy access to functions (1994, FX-7700GE and later), graphing in several colors (1995, CFX-9800G), textbook-like "Natural Display" input and output (2004, FX-82ES/300ES &amp; FX-9860G), expandable memory (2005, FX-9860SD), backlit screen (2006, FX-9860G Slim), full-color, high resolution backlit screen (2010, FX-CG10/CG20 PRIZM).

Sharp produced its first graphing calculator, the EL-5200, in 1986. Since then Sharp's innovations include models with a touchscreen (EL9600 series), Equation Editor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sharp-world.com/sc/excite/calculator/image/EL9400TG.pdf|title=Graphing Calculator EL-9400 TEACHERS’ GUIDE|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; (textbook-like input) (EL-9300&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www004.upp.so-net.ne.jp/upc/pc/sharp.html|title=SHARP Calculators (Japanese).

[[Hewlett Packard]] followed in the form of the [[HP-28 series|HP-28C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Campbell|first1=Paul|title=Reviews|journal=Mathematics Magazine|date=October 1987|volume=60|page=249|doi=10.2307/2689351|jstor=2689351}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the [[HP-28S]] (1988), [[HP-48SX]] (1990), [[HP-48S]] (1991), and many other models. Models like the [[HP 50g]] (2006) or the [[HP Prime]] (2013) feature a [[computer algebra system]] (CAS) capable of manipulating symbolic expressions and analytic solving. An unusual and powerful CAS "calculator" is the now obsolete year 2001 [[Casio Cassiopeia A-10]] and [[Casio Cassiopeia A-11|A-11]] (flip top) stylus-operated PDAs, which ran the [[Maple V]] symbolic engine. The HP-28 and -48 ranges were primarily meant for the professional science/engineering markets; the HP-38/39/40 were sold in the high school/college educational market; while the HP-49 series cater to both educational and professional customers of all levels. The HP series of graphing calculators is best known for its [[Reverse Polish notation]] (RPN) / [[Reverse Polish Lisp]] (RPL) interface, although the [[HP-49G]] introduced a standard expression entry interface as well.

Texas Instruments has produced graphing calculators since 1990, the oldest of which was the [[TI-81]]. Some of the newer calculators are similar, with the addition of more memory, faster processors, and USB connection such as the [[TI-82]], [[TI-83]] series, and [[TI-84]] series. Other models, designed to be appropriate for students 10–14 years of age, are the [[TI-80]] and [[TI-73]]. Other TI graphing calculators have been designed to be appropriate for calculus, namely the [[TI-85]], [[TI-86]], [[TI-89]] series, and [[TI-92]] series (TI-92, [[TI-92 Plus]], and [[Voyage 200]]). TI offers a CAS on the TI-89, [[TI-Nspire CAS]] and TI-92 series of calculators. TI calculators are targeted specifically to the educational market, but are also widely available to the general public.

== Features ==

=== Computer algebra systems ===
Some graphing calculators have a [[computer algebra system]] (CAS), which means that they are capable of producing symbolic results. These calculators can manipulate algebraic expressions, performing operations such as factor, expand, and simplify. In addition, they can give answers in exact form without numerical approximations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://blogs.uchicago.edu/uei/technology_in_education/the_role_of_computer_algebra_s.shtml|title=The Role of Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) in Math Teaching and the Common Core |website=University of Chicago Blogs}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calculators that have a computer algebra system are called '''symbolic''' or '''CAS''' calculators. Examples of symbolic calculators include the [[HP 50g]], the [[HP Prime]], the [[TI-89]], the [[TI-Nspire series#TI-Nspire CAS|TI-Nspire CAS]] and [[TI-Nspire CX CAS]] and the [[Casio ClassPad 300|Casio ClassPad]] series.

=== Laboratory usage ===
Many graphing calculators can be attached to devices like electronic thermometers, pH gauges, weather instruments, decibel and light meters, [[accelerometer]]s, and other sensors and therefore function as [[data logger]]s, as well as WiFi or other communication modules for monitoring, polling and interaction with the teacher. Student laboratory exercises with data from such devices enhances learning of math, especially statistics and mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Texas Instruments Graphing Calculator Data Collection |url=https://education.ti.com/en/products?category=data-collection |website=Texas Instruments |publisher=Texas Instruments |accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Games ===
[[File:TI83tris.JPG|thumb|alt=The game [[Tetris]] is being played on a [[TI-83 Plus]].|Graphing calculators are sometimes used for [[Mobile game#Calculator games|gaming]].]]
Since graphing calculators are usually readily user-programmable, such calculators are also widely used for gaming purposes, with a sizable body of user-created game software on most popular platforms. Some of the most notable and extensive community-driven graphing calculator archives are [http://www.ticalc.org/archives ticalc.org] and [http://www.cemetech.net/programs/index.php cemetech.net]. The ability to create games and other utilities within most graphing calculators has spurred the creation of numerous calculator hobbyist sites, where more advanced programs are created using a calculator's [[assembly language]]. It is simple to download games to a graphing calculator, as nearly all calculator program archives are free and open source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How To Get Graphing Calculator Games|url=http://calcustar.com/how-to-get-graphing-calculator-games/|website=Calcustar|publisher=Scotty Thompson|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though handheld gaming devices fall in a similar price range, graphing calculators offer superior math programming capability for math based games. However, for developers and advanced users like researchers, analysts and gamers, 3rd party software development involving firmware mods, whether for powerful gaming or exploiting capabilities beyond the published data sheet and programming language, is a contentious issue with manufacturers and education authorities as it might incite unfair calculator use during standardized high school and college tests where these devices are targeted. Nowadays graduate (Masters) students and researchers have turned to advanced Computer Aided Math software for learning as well as experimenting.

== Graphing calculators in education ==
{{Update|section|date=September 2018}}
[[Image:TI-biju.jpg|thumb|upright|TI-89 Titanium, capable of doing Symbolic Manipulation, Computer Algebra System (CAS)]]
* '''North America''' – high school mathematics teachers allow and even encourage their students to use graphing calculators in class. In some cases (especially in [[calculus]] courses) they are ''required''. Some of them are disallowed in certain classes such as [[chemistry]] or [[physics]] due to their capacity to contain full [[periodic table]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://education.ti.com/en/us/software/details/en/1E8EB275DBED43918A5E8230BCDDEDF0/83periodictable1 Periodic table app for the Ti-84&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=January 2017}}
* '''[[College Board]] of the United States''' – permits the use of most graphing or [[Computer algebra system|CAS]] calculators that do not have a [[QWERTY]]-style keyboard for parts of its [[Advanced Placement|AP]] and [[SAT]] exams, but the [[ACT (test)|ACT]] exam and [[International Baccalaureate|IB]] schools do not permit the use of calculators with computer algebra systems.
* '''United Kingdom''' – a graphing calculator is allowed for [[A-level]] maths courses (excluding the C1 module where no calculator of any kind is permitted), however they are not required and the exams are designed to be broadly 'calculator neutral'. Similarly, at [[GCSE]], all current courses include one paper where no calculator of any kind can be used, but students are permitted to use graphical calculators for other papers. The use of graphical calculators at [[GCSE]] is not widespread with cost being a likely factor. The use of [[Computer algebra system|CAS]] is not allowed for either [[A-level]] or [[GCSE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jcq.org.uk/attachments/published/898/17.%20ICE%2010-11.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812224928/http://www.jcq.org.uk/attachments/published/898/17.%20ICE%2010-11.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }} General, Vocational and Diploma Qualifications Instructions for conducting examinations.&lt;/ref&gt; The Scottish SQA allows the use of graphic calculators in maths exams (excluding paper 1, which is exclusively non-calculator), however these should either be checked before exams by invigilators or handed out by the exam centre, as certain functions / information is not allowed to be stored on a calculator in the exam. SQA exams do not favour a graphic calculator, and since working must be shown for full marks, do not give a significant advantage over candidates who do not use them.
* '''Finland and Slovenia''' – and certain other countries, it is forbidden to use calculators with symbolic calculation ([[Computer algebra system|CAS]]) or 3D graphics features in the [[matriculation|matriculation exam]]. This changed in the case of Finland, however, as symbolic calculators were allowed from spring 2012 onwards.
* '''Norway''' – calculators with [[Wireless|wireless communication]] capabilities, such as [[Infrared|IR]] links, have been banned at some technical universities.
* '''Australia''' – policies vary from state to state.
** '''Victoria''' – the [[Victorian Certificate of Education|VCE]] specifies approved calculators as applicable for its mathematics exams. For [[Further Mathematics]] an approved graphics calculator (for example [[TI-83 series|TI-83]]/[[TI-84 Plus series|84]], [[Casio 9860 series|Casio 9860]], [[HP 39/40 series|HP-39G]]) or CAS (for example [[TI-89 series|TI-89]], [[Casio ClassPad 300|the ClassPad series]], [[HP 39/40 series#HP 40G|HP-40G]]) can be used. Mathematical Methods (CAS) has a technology free examination consisting of short answer and some extended answer questions. It then also has a technology-active examination consisting of extended response and multiple choice questions: a CAS is the assumed technology for Mathematical Methods (CAS). Specialist Mathematics has a technology free examination and a technology-active examination where either an approved graphics calculator or CAS may be used. Calculator memories are not required to be cleared. In subjects like Physics and Chemistry, students are only allowed a standard scientific calculator.
** '''Western Australia''' – all [[tertiary entrance examination]]s in Mathematics involve a calculator section which assume the student has a graphics calculator; CAS enabled calculators are also permitted. In subjects such as Physics, Chemistry and Accounting only non programmable calculators are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.curriculum.wa.edu.au/internet/_Documents/Policy/Calculators_use_in_the_WACE_examinations_2010_pdf.pdf Calculator use in the 2011 WACE examinations&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''New South Wales''' – graphics calculators are allowed for the General Mathematics [[Higher School Certificate (New South Wales)|Higher School Certificate]] exam, but disallowed in the higher level Mathematics courses.
* '''China''' - Only the Shanghai College Entrance Examination allows the use of calculators without graphing and memory. Except for Shanghai, the other provinces and cities do not allow the use of calculators, so calculators in general are banned in primary and secondary education in most parts of China.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
* '''India''' - Calculators are banned in primary and secondary education. University degree and diploma courses have their own rules on use and permitted models of calculators in exams.
* '''New Zealand''' – calculators identified as having high-level algebraic manipulation capability are prohibited in [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement|NCEA]] examinations unless specifically allowed by a standard or subject prescription. This includes calculators such as the [[TI-89]] series [http://www.nzqa.govt.nz/ncea/acrp/secondary/4/47.html].
* '''Turkey''' – any type of calculator whatsoever is prohibited in all primary and high schools except the IB and American schools. {{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
* '''Singapore''' – graphing calculators are used in junior colleges; it is required in the Mathematics paper of the GCE 'A' Levels, and most schools use the [[TI-84 Plus]] or [[TI-84 Plus Silver Edition]].
* '''Netherlands''' – high school students are obliged to use graphing calculators during tests and exams in their final three years. Most students use the [[TI-83 Plus]] or [[TI-84 Plus]], but other graphing calculators are allowed, including the [[Casio CFX-9860G|Casio fx-9860G]] and [[HP-39G]]. Graphing calculators are almost always allowed to be used during tests instead of normal calculators, which sometimes results in cheat sheets being made on forehand and exchanged before the test starts using link cables.
* '''Israel''' –  Graphing calculators are forbidden to use in the [[Bagrut]] (equivalent to the American SAT) math exam, in addition to programmable calculators.&lt;ref&gt;http://meyda.education.gov.il/sheeloney_bagrut/2012/1/HEB/35807.PDF The instructions for conducting the 5 point exam Bagrut in math, 2012 in Hebrew.&lt;/ref&gt; University degree and diploma courses have their own rules on use and permitted models of calculators in exams.

== Programming ==
Most graphing calculators, as well as some non-graphing scientific and programmer's calculators can be programmed to automate complex and frequently used series of calculations and those inaccessible from the keyboard.

The actual programming can often be done on a computer then later uploaded to the calculators.  The most common tools for this include the PC link cable and software for the given calculator, configurable text editors or hex editors, and specialized programming tools such as the below-mentioned implementation of various languages on the computer side.

Earlier calculators stored programs on magnetic cards and the like; increased memory capacity has made storage on the calculator the most common implementation. Some of the newer machines can also use memory cards.

Many graphing and scientific calculators will tokenize the program text, replacing textual programming elements with short numerical tokens. For example, take this line of TI-BASIC code:
&lt;code&gt;Disp [A]&lt;/code&gt;
In a conventional programming language, this line of code would be nine characters long (eight not including a newline character). For a system as slow as a graphing calculator, this is too inefficient for an [[interpreted language]]. To increase program speed and coding efficiency, the above line of code would be only three characters. "Disp_" as a single character, "[A]" as a single character, and a newline character. This normally means that single byte chars will query the standard [[ASCII]] chart while two byte chars (the Disp_ for example) will build a graphical string of single byte characters but retain the two byte character in the program memory. Many graphical calculators work much like computers and use versions of 7-bit, 8-bit or 9-bit ASCII-derived character sets or even [[UTF-8]] and [[Unicode]]. Many of them have a tool similar to the [[Character Map (Windows)|character map]] on Windows.

They also have [[BASIC]] like functions such as chr$, chr, char, asc, and so on, which sometimes may be more Pascal or C like. One example may be use of ''ord'', as in [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], instead of the ''asc'' of many Basic variants, to return the code of a character, i.e. the position of the character in the collating sequence of the machine.

A cable and/or [[IrDA]] transceiver connecting the calculator to a computer make the process easier and expands other possibilities such as on-board spreadsheet, database, graphics, and word processing programs.  The second option is being able to code the programs on board the calculator itself.  This option is facilitated by the inclusion of full-screen text editors and other programming tools in the default feature set of the calculator or as optional items.  Some calculators have [[QWERTY]] keyboards and others can be attached to an external keyboard which can be close to the size of a regular 102-key computer keyboard.  Programming is a major use for the software and cables used to connect calculators to computers.

The most common programming languages used for calculators are similar to keystroke-macro languages and variants of [[BASIC]].  The latter can have a large feature set—approaching that of BASIC as found in computers—including character and string manipulation, advanced conditional and branching statements, sound, graphics, and more including, of course, the huge spectrum of mathematical, string, bit-manipulation, number base, I/O, and graphics functions built into the machine.

Languages for programming calculators fall into all of the main groups, i.e. machine code, low-level, mid-level, high-level languages for systems and application programming, scripting, macro, and glue languages, procedural, functional, imperative &amp;.  object-oriented programming can be achieved in some cases.

Most calculators capable to being connected to a computer can be programmed in assembly language and machine code, although on some calculators this is only possible through using exploits. The most common assembly and machine languages are for [[TMS9900]], [[SuperH|SH-3]], [[Zilog Z80]], and various [[Motorola]] chips (e.g. a modified [[68000]]) which serve as the main processors of the machines although many (not all) are modified to some extent from their use elsewhere.  Some manufacturers do not document and even mildly discourage the assembly language programming of their machines because they must be programmed in this way by putting together the program on the PC and then forcing it into the calculator by various improvised methods.

Other on-board programming languages include purpose-made languages, variants of [[Eiffel (programming language)|Eiffel]], [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]], and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], and Command Script facilities which are similar in function to batch/shell programming and other [[Scripting language#Glue languages|glue languages]] on computers but generally not as full featured.  Ports of other languages like [[BBC BASIC]] and development of on-board interpreters for [[Fortran]], [[REXX]], [[AWK]], [[Perl]], [[Unix shell]]s (e.g., [[bash (Unix shell)|bash]], [[Z shell|zsh]]), other shells ([[DOS]]/[[Windows 9x]], [[OS/2]], and [[Windows NT]] family shells as well as the related [[4DOS]], [[Take Command Console|4NT]] and [[4OS2]] as well as [[DIGITAL Command Language|DCL]]), [[COBOL]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Tcl]], [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]], [[Delphi (programming language)|Delphi]], [[ALGOL]], and other languages are at various levels of development.

Some calculators, especially those with other PDA-like functions have actual operating systems including the TI proprietary OS for its more recent machines, [[DOS]], [[Windows CE]], and rarely [[Windows NT 4.0 Embedded]] et seq, and [[Linux]]. Experiments with the [[TI-89]], [[TI-92 series|TI-92]], [[TI-92 Plus]] and [[Voyage 200]] machines show the possibility of installing some variants of other systems such as a chopped-down variant of [[CP/M#The 16-bit world|CP/M-68K]], an operating system which has been used for portable devices in the past.

Tools which allow for programming the calculators in C/C++ and possibly Fortran and assembly language are used on the computer side, such as [[HPGCC]], [[TIGCC]] and others.  Flash memory is another means of conveyance of information to and from the calculator.

The on-board BASIC variants in TI graphing calculators and the languages available on [[HP-48 series|HP-48 type calculators]] can be used for rapid prototyping by developers, professors, and students, often when a computer is not close at hand.

Most graphing calculators have on-board spreadsheets which usually integrate with Microsoft Excel on the computer side.  At this time, spreadsheets with macro and other automation facilities on the calculator side are not on the market.  In some cases, the list, matrix, and data grid facilities can be combined with the native programming language of the calculator to have the effect of a macro and scripting enabled spreadsheet.

{{For|details of practical heat pumps|Heat pump}}
{{Thermodynamics|cTopic=[[Thermodynamic system|Systems]]}}
Thermodynamic '''heat pump cycles''' or '''refrigeration cycles''' are the conceptual and [[mathematical model]]s for [[heat pump]]s and [[refrigerator]]s. A heat pump is a machine or device that moves [[heat]] from one location (the "source") at a lower temperature  to another location (the "sink" or "heat sink") at a higher temperature using [[mechanical work]] or a high-temperature heat source.&lt;ref&gt;The Systems and Equipment volume of the ''[[ASHRAE Handbook]]'', ASHRAE, Inc., Atlanta, GA, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus a heat pump may be thought of as a "heater" if the objective is to warm the heat sink (as when warming the inside of a home on a cold day), or a "refrigerator" if the objective is to cool the heat source (as in the normal operation of a freezer). In either case, the operating principles are identical.&lt;ref name="Cengel2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cengel, Yunus A. and Michael A. Boles |title=Thermodynamics: An Engineering Approach|edition=6th|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2008|isbn=0-07-330537-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat is moved from a cold place to a warm place.

== Thermodynamic cycles ==
According to the [[second law of thermodynamics]] heat cannot spontaneously flow from a colder location to a hotter area; [[mechanical work|work]] is required to achieve this.&lt;ref&gt;''Fundamentals of Engineering Thermodynamics'', by Howell and Buckius, McGraw-Hill, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; An air conditioner requires work to cool a living space, moving heat from the cooler interior (the heat source) to the warmer outdoors (the heat sink).  Similarly, a refrigerator moves heat from inside the cold icebox (the heat source) to the warmer room-temperature air of the kitchen (the heat sink). The operating principle of the [[refrigeration]] cycle was described mathematically by [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] in 1824 as a [[Carnot heat engine|heat engine]]. A heat pump can be thought of as a [[heat engine]] which is operating in reverse.

Heat pump and refrigeration cycles can be classified as ''vapor compression'', ''vapor absorption'', ''gas cycle'', or ''Stirling cycle'' types.

=== Vapor-compression cycle ===
{{Main|Vapor-compression refrigeration}}

The vapor-compression cycle is used in most household refrigerators as well as in many large commercial and industrial refrigeration systems. Figure 1 provides a schematic diagram of the components of a typical vapor-compression refrigeration system. [[File:Refrigeration.png|frame|right|Figure 1: Vapor-compression refrigeration]] The [[thermodynamics]] of the cycle can be analysed on a diagram&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.me.unr.edu/me372/Spring2001/Vapor%20Compression%20Refrigeration%20Cycles.pdf The Ideal Vapor-Compression Cycle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226113352/http://web.me.unr.edu/me372/Spring2001/Vapor%20Compression%20Refrigeration%20Cycles.pdf |date=2007-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://iehmtu.edata-center.com/toc/chapt_r/ch18s82.html Scroll down to "The Basic Vapor Compression Cycle and Components"]&lt;/ref&gt; as shown in Figure 2. In this cycle, a circulating [[Working fluids|working fluid]] commonly called  [[refrigerant]] such as [[Freon]] enters the [[gas compressor|compressor]] as a vapor. The vapor is compressed at constant [[entropy]] and exits the compressor [[superheating|superheated]]. The superheated vapor travels through the [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] which first cools and removes the superheat and then condenses the vapor into a liquid by removing additional heat at constant pressure and temperature. The liquid refrigerant goes through the [[thermal expansion valve|expansion valve]] (also called a throttle valve) where its pressure abruptly decreases, causing [[flash evaporation]] and auto-refrigeration of, typically, less than half of the liquid. [[File:RefrigerationTS.png|frame|right|Figure 2:[[Temperature-entropy diagram|Temperature–Entropy diagram]] of the vapor-compression cycle.]] That results in a mixture of liquid and vapor at a lower temperature and pressure. The cold liquid-vapor mixture then travels through the evaporator coil or tubes and is completely vaporized by cooling the warm air (from the space being refrigerated) being blown by a fan across the evaporator coil or tubes. The resulting refrigerant vapor returns to the compressor inlet to complete the thermodynamic cycle.

The above discussion is based on the ideal vapor-compression refrigeration cycle, and does not take into account real-world effects like frictional pressure drop in the system, slight [[thermodynamic reversibility|thermodynamic irreversibility]] during the compression of the refrigerant vapor, or [[ideal gas|non-ideal gas]] behavior (if any).

=== Vapor absorption cycle ===
{{Main|Absorption refrigerator}}
In the early years of the twentieth century, the vapor absorption cycle using water-ammonia systems was popular and widely used but, after the development of the vapor compression cycle, it lost much of its importance because of its low [[coefficient of performance]] (about one fifth of that of the vapor compression cycle). Nowadays, the vapor absorption cycle is used only where heat is more readily available than electricity, such as [[waste heat]] provided by [[Solar thermal collector|solar collector]]s, or [[Propane#Refrigeration|off-the-grid refrigeration]] in [[recreational vehicle]]s.

The absorption cycle is similar to the compression cycle, except for the method of raising the pressure of the refrigerant vapor. In the absorption system, the compressor is replaced by an absorber which dissolves the refrigerant in a suitable liquid, a liquid pump which raises the pressure and a generator which, on heat addition, drives off the refrigerant vapor from the high-pressure liquid. Some work is required by the liquid pump but, for a given quantity of refrigerant, it is much smaller than needed by the compressor in the vapor compression cycle. In an absorption refrigerator, a suitable combination of refrigerant and absorbent is used. The most common combinations are ammonia (refrigerant) and water (absorbent), and water (refrigerant) and [[lithium bromide]] (absorbent).

=== Gas cycle ===
When the [[Working fluids|working fluid]] is a gas that is compressed and expanded but does not change phase, the refrigeration cycle is called a ''gas cycle''. [[Air]] is most often this working fluid. As there is no condensation and evaporation intended in a gas cycle, components corresponding to the condenser and evaporator in a vapor compression cycle are the hot and cold gas-to-gas [[heat exchanger]]s.

For given extreme temperatures, a gas cycle may be less efficient than a vapor compression cycle because the gas cycle works on the reverse [[Brayton cycle]] instead of the reverse [[Rankine cycle]]. As such, the working fluid never receives or rejects heat at constant temperature. In the gas cycle, the refrigeration effect is equal to the product of the specific heat of the gas and the rise in temperature of the gas in the low temperature side. Therefore, for the same cooling load, gas refrigeration cycle machines require a larger mass flow rate, which in turn increases their size.

Because of their lower efficiency and larger bulk, ''air cycle'' coolers are not often applied in terrestrial refrigeration. The [[air cycle machine]] is very common, however, on [[gas turbine]]-powered [[jet airliner]]s since compressed air is readily available from the engines' compressor sections. These jet aircraft's cooling and ventilation units also serve the purpose of heating and pressurizing the [[aircraft cabin]].

=== Stirling engine ===
{{Main|Stirling engine}}

The [[Stirling cycle]] heat engine can be driven in reverse, using a mechanical energy input to drive heat transfer in a reversed direction (i.e. a heat pump, or refrigerator).  There are several design configurations for such devices that can be built. Several such setups require rotary or sliding seals, which can introduce difficult tradeoffs between frictional losses and refrigerant leakage.

===Reversed Carnot cycle===
&lt;!-- Process labels do not correspond to Figure 2. Please clarify.--&gt;
Since the [[Carnot cycle]] is a reversible cycle, the four processes that comprise it, two isothermal and two isentropic, can all be reversed as well. When this happens, it is called a reversed Carnot cycle. A refrigerator or heat pump that acts on the reversed Carnot cycle is called a Carnot refrigerator and Carnot heat pump respectively. In the first stage of this cycle (process 1-2), the refrigerant absorbs heat isothermally from a low-temperature source, T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;, in the amount Q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;. Next, the refrigerant is isentropically compressed (process 2-3) and the temperature rises to the high-temperature source, T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;. Then at this high temperature, the refrigerant rejects heat isothermally in the amount Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; (process 3-4). Also during this stage, the refrigerant changes from a saturated vapor to a saturated liquid in the condenser. Lastly, the refrigerant expands isentropically where the temperature drops back to the low-temperature source, T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; (process 4-1).&lt;ref name="Cengel2008" /&gt;

==Coefficient of performance==
The efficiency of a refrigerator or heat pump is given by a parameter called the [[coefficient of performance]] (COP).

The COP of a refrigerator is given by the following equation: 
:COP = Desired Output/Required Input = Cooling Effect/Work Input = Q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/W&lt;sub&gt;net,in&lt;/sub&gt;

The COP of a heat pump is given by the following equation:
:COP = Desired Output/Required Input = Heating Effect/Work Input = Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;/W&lt;sub&gt;net,in&lt;/sub&gt;

Both the COP of a refrigerator and a heat pump can be greater than one. Combining these two equations results in:

:COP&lt;sub&gt;HP&lt;/sub&gt; = COP&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; + 1 for fixed values of Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; and Q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;

This implies that COP&lt;sub&gt;HP&lt;/sub&gt; will be greater than one because COP&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; will be a positive quantity. In a worst-case scenario, the heat pump will supply as much energy as it consumes, making it act as a resistance heater. However, in reality, as in home heating, some of Q&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is lost to the outside air through piping, insulation, etc., thus making the COP&lt;sub&gt;HP&lt;/sub&gt; drop below unity when the outside air temperature is too low. Therefore, the system used to heat houses uses fuel.&lt;ref name="Cengel2008" /&gt;

For an ideal refrigeration cycle:
:COP = T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/(T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;-T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)

For an ideal heat pump cycle:
:COP = T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;/(T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;-T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;)

For Carnot refrigerators and heat pumps, COP is expressed in terms of temperatures:

:COP&lt;sub&gt;R,Carnot&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/((T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;) - 1)

:COP&lt;sub&gt;HP,Carnot&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/(1 - (T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;/T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;))

A '''high chair''' is a piece of [[furniture]] used for feeding older [[baby|babies]] and younger [[toddler]]s. The seat is raised a fair distance from the ground, so that a person of adult height may [[spoon-feed]] the child comfortably from a standing position (hence the name). It often has a wide base to increase stability. There is a tray which is attached to the arms of the high chair, which allows the adult to place the food on it for either the child to pick up and eat or for the food to be spoon-fed to them.  High chairs typically have seat belts to strap the child in.

A booster chair is meant to be used with a regular chair to boost the height of a child sufficiently.  Some boosters are a simple monolithic piece of plastic.  Others are more complex and are designed to fold up and include a detachable tray.

Rarely, a chair can be suspended from the edge of the table avoiding the need for an adult chair or a high chair.

== Safety standards ==

The EU standards EN 14988-1:2006 + A1 and EN 14988-2: 2006 + A1 on high chairs will be published by the member states during autumn 2012. Meanwhile, they are available at the online library of the [[European Committee for Standardization]] (CEN).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130322170123/http://esearch.cen.eu/esearch/Details.aspx?id=7018451 CEN Catalogue] Retrieved August 31, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horn furniture''' is a name given to furniture which is manufactured completely by shed antlers or pieces of furniture such as e.g. cabinets which are appliqued with antler elements such as carved horn roses or with antler pieces from tusks, fallow deer, stag and deer. Trophies of chase have already been used during the late Middle Age for furnishing and in modern times furniture makers use the horns and antlers of animals such as [[cattle]] (usually [[longhorn cattle (disambiguation)|longhorned]] ones), [[antelope]], [[moose]] and [[elk]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.antiques-bible.com/victorian-horn-chair/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Antlers were already used in the late 15th century as a source material for clothes hooks, storage racks and chandeliers, the so-called "lusterweibchen".&lt;ref&gt;Dagmar Preising, Michael Rief, Christine Vogt (hrsg): Artefakt und Naturwunder - Das Leuterweibchen der Sammlung Ludwig, Katalog zur Ausstellung in der Ludwig Galerie, Oberhausen 2011, {{ISBN|978-3-86678-512-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furniture made by antlers have been invented in the 19th century and can therefore be assigned to the Biedermeier period.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Payne: 19th CENTURY EUROPEAN FURNITURE  Antique Collectors' Club, England 1981&lt;/ref&gt; They were exclusively made for the European nobility to decorate their hunting castles and various manors. Historically mentioned horn furniture was developed in the year 1825 for a hunting castle of the count William of Nassau near Wiesbaden, Germany, A photograph of 1890 is the single existing evidence as the castles was destroyed in World War II and the interior furniture is regarded as lost. Further known collections of historic horn furniture are credited with the hunting room in the country estate of the Brandhof of the Archduke Johann of Austria or the antler collection of count Arco in Munich, Germany. Many other examples of horn furniture of that time can only be found with drawings and pictures, e.g. Joseph Danhauser (1780–1829) an Austrian furniture manufacturer left hundreds of drawing and another well-known aquarelle is the dressing room of Ferdinand Baron von Hildprandt.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine Spindler: Geweihmöbel 1825–1925. Klaus Spindler, München 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The ambitious European middle-class people embodied a lifestyle trend of the cultivation of home décor during the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mid-Century Style Guide|url=https://www.roveconcepts.com/blog/aug2016/mid-century-style-guide|website=www.roveconcepts.com|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Newman: Fantasy Furniture. Rizzoli, New York 1989&lt;/ref&gt; With the increasing popularity of the World Exhibitions furniture styling trends became more and more accessible. The London World Exhibition in 1851 presented antler furniture as one of its great novelties. The Hamburg sculptor and ivory carver H.F.C.Rampendahl exhibited horn furniture pieces such as bureaus, chairs and sofa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O62293/armchair-rampendahl-h-f/|title=Armchair - Rampendahl, H. F. C. - V&amp;A Search the Collections|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other artists followed and the manufacturing of horn furniture finalized in a serial production via catalogue sales.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Olms: August Stukenbrok Illustrierter Hauptkatalog. Olmspresse, Hildesheim 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular horn furniture was related to the following well-known designers and or company names in Germany and Austria such as Gustav Lorenz, Heinrich Keitel, Kurt Schicker, Rudolf Brix, Vitus Madel &amp; Sohn. In the United States the most famous designer was Friedrich Wenzel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ffr30|title=FRIEDRICH, WENZEL|first=ST. JOHN, RICHARD|last=W.|date=12 June 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their portfolio covered the complete market of furnishings and additionally a lot of houseware.

The horn furniture trend suddenly ended at the end of the 1920s and the production was ceased completely. During the post-war period in Europe only individual orders could be recognized by antique furnishing experts.

The lodge style and cabin décor trend in modern households today is facing a reinvigorated demand for horn furniture. Home décor magazines show modern reproductions of seating horn furniture, lamps, candle stick and other small furniture.

'''ISO/TC 37''' is a technical [[committee]] within the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) that prepares [[Technical standard|standards]] and other [[documents]] concerning [[methodology]] and principles for [[terminology]] and [[language resources]].

'''Title: Terminology and other language and content resources'''

'''Scope: [[Standardization]] of principles, methods and applications relating to [[terminology]] and other [[language]] and content [[resources]] in the [[contexts]] of [[multilingual]] [[communication]] and cultural [[Multiculturalism|diversity]]'''

ISO/TC 37 is a so-called "horizontal committee", providing guidelines for all other technical committees that develop standards on how to manage their terminological problems. However, the standards developed by ISO/TC 37 are not restricted to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]. Collaboration with [[industry]] is sought to ensure that the requirements and needs from all possible users of standards concerning terminology, language and structured content are duly and timely addressed.

Involvement in standards development is open to all [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] and requests can be made to the TC through any liaison or member organization (see the list of current members and liaisons of ISO/TC 37:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iso.org/iso/standards_development/technical_committees/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=48104&lt;/ref&gt;)

ISO/TC 37 standards are therefore fundamental and should form the basis for many [[Internationalization and localization|localization]], [[translation]], and other [[industry]] [[Industrial application|applications]].

==ISO/TC 37 "Terminology and other language and content resources"==
International Standards are developed by [[expert]]s from [[industry]], [[academia]] and [[business]] who are [[delegates]] of their national standards institution or another [[organization]] in liaison. Involvement, therefore, is principally open to all [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. They are based on consensus among those national standards institutes who collaborate in the respective committee by way of membership.

ISO/TC 37 develops [[International Standards]] concerning:
* terminological principles and methods
* vocabulary of terminology and language resource management
* terminology work
* preparation and management of language resources
* preparation and layout of terminology standards
* [[computer]]ized terminography and [[lexicography]]
* terminology [[documentation]]
* coding and [[code]]s in the field of terminology and other language resources
* applications of terminology and other language resources in [[language engineering]] and [[content management]]
* translation, interpreting and related technology

ISO/TC 37 looks upon a long [[history]] of terminology unification activities. In the past, terminology experts - even more so experts of terminology [[theory]] and methodology - had to struggle for wide recognition. Today their [[expertise]] is sought in many application areas, especially in various fields of standardization. The emerging multilingual [[information society]] and [[knowledge society]] will depend on reliable [[Digital data|digital]] content. [[Terminology]] is indispensable here. This is because terminology plays a crucial role wherever and whenever specialized [[information]] and [[knowledge]] is being prepared (e.g. in [[research and development]]), used (e.g. in specialized [[Textbook|texts]]), recorded and processed (e.g. in data banks), passed on (via [[training]] and [[teaching]]), implemented (e.g. in technology and knowledge transfer), or translated and interpreted. In the age of [[globalization]] the need for methodology standards concerning multilingual [[Digital data|digital]] [[Content (media and publishing)|content]] is increasing - ISO/TC 37 has developed over the years the [[expertise]] for methodology standards for [[science]] and [[technology]] related content in textual form.

==Terminology standardization==
The beginnings of terminology standardization are closely linked to the standardization efforts of IEC ([[International Electrotechnical Commission]], founded in 1906) and ISO ([[International Organization for Standardization]], founded in 1946).

A terminology standard according to [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]/[[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] Guide 2 (1996) is defined as "standard that is concerned with terms, usually accompanied by their [[definition]]s, and sometimes by explanatory notes, [[illustration]]s, examples, etc."

ISO 1087-1:2000 defines [[terminology]] as ''"set of designations belonging to one special language" and designations as "[[Representation (systemics)|representation]] of a [[concept]] by a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]] which denotes it".'' Here, concept representation goes beyond terms (being only linguistic signs), which is also supported by the state-of-the-art of terminology science, according to which terminology has three major functions:

# basic elements carrying meaning in [[Domain Name System|domain]] [[communication]],
# ordering of scientific-technical [[knowledge]] at the level of concepts,
# access to other representations of specialized information and knowledge.

The above indicates that terminological [[data]] (comprising various kinds of knowledge representation) possibly have a much more fundamental role in domain-related information and knowledge than commonly understood.

Today, terminology standardization can be subdivided into two distinct activities:
* standardization of terminologies,
* standardization of terminological principles and methods.

The two are mutually [[interdependent]], since the [[standardization]] of terminologies would not result in high-quality terminological data, if certain common principles, rules and methods are not observed. On the other hand, these standardized terminological principles, rules and methods must reflect the state-of-the-art of theory and methodology development in those domains, in which terminological data have to be standardized in connection with the formulation of subject standards.

Terminology gained a special position in the field of standardization at large, which is defined as ''"activity of establishing, with regard to actual or potential [[problem]]s, provisions for common and repeated use, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context"'' (ISO/IEC 1996). Every technical committee or sub-committee or working group has to standardize subject matters, define and standardize its respective terminology. There is a consensus that terminology standardization precedes subject standardization (or "subject standardization requires terminology standardization").

==History of ISO/TC 37==
ISO/TC 37 was put into operation in 1952 in order "to find out and formulate general principles of terminology and terminological lexicography" (as terminography was called at that time).

The [[history]] of terminology standardization proper - if one excludes earlier attempts in the field of [[metrology]] - started in the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), which was founded in [[London]] in 1906 following a recommendation passed at the International Electrical Congress, held in [[St. Louis]], United States, on 15 September 1904, to the extent that: ''"...steps should be taken to secure the co-operation of the technical societies of the world, by the appointment of a representative Commission to consider the question of the standardization of the [[nomenclature]] and ratings of [[electric]]al [[Electrical equipment|apparatus]] and [[machinery]]".'' From the very beginning, [[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]] considered it its foremost task to standardize the terminology of electrotechnology for the sake of the quality of its subject standards, and soon embarked upon the International Electrotechnical [[Vocabulary]] (IEV), whose first edition, based on many individual terminology standards, was published in 1938. The IEV is still being continued today, covering 77 chapters as parts of the International Standard series IEC 60050. The IEV [[Online]] [[Database]] can be accessed on Electropedia &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electropedia.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427022958/http://www.electropedia.org/ |archivedate=2015-04-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The predecessor to the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), the International Federation of Standardizing Associations (ISA, founded in 1926), made a similar experience. But it went a step further and - triggered by the publication of [[Eugen Wüster]]'s book "Internationale Sprachnormung in der Technik" [International standardization of technical language] (Wüster 1931) - established in 1936 the Technical Committee ISA/TC 37 "Terminology" for the sake of formulating general principles and rules for terminology standardization.

ISA/TC 37 conceived a scheme of four classes of recommendations for terminology standardization mentioned below, but the [[Second World War]] interrupted its [[Innovator|pioneering]] work. Nominally, ISO/TC 37 was established from the very beginning of ISO in 1946, but it was decided to re-activate it only in 1951 and the Committee started operation in 1952. Since then until 2009 the secretariat of ISO/TC 37 has been held by the International Information Centre for Terminology (Infoterm),&lt;ref name="infoterm"&gt;http://www.infoterm.org&lt;/ref&gt; on behalf of the [[Austrian Standards Institute]] Austria. Infoterm,&lt;ref name="infoterm" /&gt; an [[international non-governmental organization]] based in Austria, continues to collaborate as a [[twin towns and sister cities|twinning]] [[wikt:secretariat|secretariat]]. After this the administration went to CNIS (China).

==Objective of ISO/TC 37==
To prepare standards specifying principles and methods for the preparation and [[management]] of language resources within the framework of standardization and related activities. Its technical work results in [[International Standards]] (and Technical Reports) covering terminological principles and methods as well as various aspects of [[computer-assisted]] terminography. ISO/TC 37 is not responsible for the co-ordination of the terminology standardizing activities of other ISO/TCs.

The '''International Radio Corporation''' ('''IRC''') was an American [[receiver (radio)|radio receiver]] manufacturing company based in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. It was established in 1931 by Charles Albert Verschoor with financial backing from Ann Arbor mayor William E. Brown, Jr., and a group of local business leaders. IRC manufactured numerous different radios, many bearing the Kadette name, including the first mass-produced [[AC/DC receiver design|AC/DC radio]], the first pocket radio, and the first [[clock radio]]. Due to the seasonal nature of radio sales, the company attempted to diversify its offerings with a product that would sell well during the summer, eventually settling on a [[camera]] that would become the [[Argus (camera company)|Argus]]. In 1939, IRC sold its radio-manufacturing business to its former General Sales Manager, W. Keene Jackson, although his new Kadette Radio Corporation only survived for a year before it went defunct. After [[World War II]], International Industries and its International Research division became [[wholly owned subsidiary|wholly owned subsidiaries]] of Argus, Inc., after which point the International name ceased to exist.

== History ==

=== Establishment ===
The International Radio Corporation was founded in 1931 in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]],&lt;ref name="Kuzyk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Argus Museum"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.michigan.org/property/the-argus-museum/|title = The Argus Museum|date = |accessdate = 22 March 2015|website = [[Pure Michigan|Pure Michigan Travel]]|publisher = Michigan Economic Development Corporation|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the creation of Charles Albert Verschoor, who had begun making radios in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="Mayer"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.shutterbug.com/content/argus-cameras-american-firm-made-miniature-photography-affordable|title = Argus Cameras; The American Firm That Made Miniature Photography Affordable|date = March 1, 2006|accessdate = 22 March 2015|website = Shutterbug|publisher = [[TEN: The Enthusiast Network]]|last = Mayer|first = Robert E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Voorhees"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://antiqueradios.com/features/kadette.html|title = International Radio Corp.|date = |accessdate = 22 March 2015|website = Antique Radios|publisher = |last = Voorhees|first = Alan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as a "colorful old-time promoter" in a January 1945 ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine article and as a "go-getting inventor" by Mary Hunt, Verschoor had previous experience in [[automotive industry|automobile manufacturing]] as well. The company was initially financed with $10,000 raised by Ann Arbor mayor William E. Brown, Jr., and a group of local business leaders who desired to create a new local company with substantial potential for growth and job creation during the [[Great Depression]]. It was based out of a former furniture factory located at 405 Fourth Street on Ann Arbor's west side.&lt;ref name="Hunt"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://oldnews.aadl.org/aa_news_19750323-an_erratic_genius|title = An Erratic Genius Put Ann Arbor On The Map|last = Hunt|first = Mary|date = March 23, 1975|work = [[The Ann Arbor News]]|access-date = 22 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early products and profitability ===
[[File:International Radio Corporation Kadette Model H 1932.jpg|thumb|Kadette Model H (1932), made of [[Bakelite]]]]
IRC debuted its first radio, the International Duo, on August 7, 1931; it was named for its ability to receive both local [[longwave]] and European [[shortwave radio|shortwave]] radio signals. It measured {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on}} by {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} by {{convert|9|in|cm|abbr=on}}, at a time when most table radios measured {{convert|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} in length without their separate [[loudspeaker|speaker]].&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

[[File:1933 Kadette radio, made in Ann Arbor, Michigan, by International Radio Corp. (14917643774).jpg|thumb|A 1933 Kadette radio receiver]]

Shortly thereafter,{{#tag:ref|The year of the Kadette's debut is a matter of some disagreement: it has been stated, respectively, as 1931 by Mahon,&lt;ref name="Mahon"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mahon | first=Morgan E. | title=A Flick of the Switch 1930–1950 | work=Antiques Electronics Supply | year=1990 | pages=100–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1932 by Mayer,&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt; and 1933 by Hunt.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;|group = "nb"}} IRC introduced the Kadette, the first mass-produced [[AC/DC receiver design|AC/DC radio]];&lt;ref name="Mahon" /&gt; it was a four-[[vacuum tube|tube]], {{convert|6|lb|kg|sp=us|adj=on}} radio small enough to be easily portable that featured an innovative plastic cabinet.&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voorhees" /&gt; This cabinet material, called [[Bakelite]], was fairly cheap to produce and helped IRC to turn a substantial profit on its radio sales.&lt;ref name="Kuzyk"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://theargusa.com/History.htm|title = The Story Of The Argus A|date = 2004|accessdate = 22 March 2015|website = The Argus A/A2 Camera Page|publisher = |last = Kuzyk|first = Hrad}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufactured by the Chicago Molded Products Company, the Kadette's plastic cabinet was the first to be used on a radio, although its [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] styling gave it a fairly traditional appearance. The radio also boasted an innovative new [[circuit design]], while its ability to operate on either [[alternating current|alternating]] (AC) or [[direct current]] (DC) allowed it to operate without a [[transformer|power transformer]], resulting in it being cheaper, smaller, and lighter than its competitors;&lt;ref name="Voorhees" /&gt; it also allowed the Kadette to be plugged into typical household [[AC power plugs and sockets|wall sockets]].&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt; Furthermore, IRC released a kit that instructed customers how to modify their Kadettes for [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered mobile applications, such as in railroad cars and automobiles;&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt; in the words of Robert E. Mayer, this kit "effectively started the [[vehicle audio|car radio]] market".&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt;

The popularity of the Kadette led to "almost immediate profitability" for IRC, and by 1933 it was the only company in Ann Arbor that was still able to pay [[dividend]]s to its [[shareholder]]s.&lt;ref name="Voorhees" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Marwil" /&gt; During the early 1930s, Ann Arbor was less adversely affected by the Great Depression than [[Detroit]] or most other [[Michigan]] communities, although lost orders and inability to pay dividends were common occurrences for Ann Arbor-based companies.&lt;ref name="Marwil"&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Ann Arbor|last = Marwil|first = Jonathan|publisher = [[University of Michigan Press]]|year = 1991|isbn = 0472064630|location = |pages = 118|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=wdNO4rb973YC&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;dq=%22International+Radio+Corporation%22+Ann+Arbor&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=63S0bZLv8B&amp;sig=y3e-93Q3MRfYc-VXK-VqTKLW3zk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Bn4PVb_OGZCAygSmj4KwCA&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22International%20Radio%20Corporation%22%20Ann%20Arbor&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later products and financial difficulties ===
Following after the Kadette were a variety of other models, many of which were innovative in their own right: the Kadette Jr., the world's first pocket radio; the Kadette Jewel, the original Kadette's successor that was available in five different color combinations; the Kadette Classic, built with three different types of plastic; and the Kadette Clockette, which resembled a small [[mantel clock]] and was available in four different wooden case styles.&lt;ref name="Voorhees" /&gt; IRC also introduced a number of related accessories, including the Tunemaster, a portable radio [[remote control]], and the Kadette Autime, the first mass-produced [[clock radio]].&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

In 1937, as its sales had climbed to $2,700,000,&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt; IRC introduced a 10-tube Kadette radio for $19.95, a price comparable with many four- and five-tube sets when its 10-tube competitors cost $100 or more. With three ballast tubes, these 10-tube radios were met with largely negative reviews; in the words of Alan Voorhees, they were "$20 sets with extra ballast tubes thrown in".&lt;ref name="Voorhees" /&gt; They were also reminiscent of 10-tube radios that Verschoor had built between 1925 and 1930 under the "Arborphone" name, which had only five functioning tubes alongside five superfluous ones intended simply to impress prospective customers.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

Furthermore, when radio dealers sold IRC's 10-tube Kadettes, they achieved [[profit margin]]s of 15% at most, far less than what they could earn selling premium models made by competitors. After the company began requiring its dealers to stock its slower selling units in order to also have access to its 10-tube Kadettes, some dealers resorted to giving unauthorized discounts to move the less attractive models, resulting in their total profit margins on the whole Kadette line falling to as low as 5% in some cases. As their profit margins fell, many dealers dropped Kadettes from their catalogs altogether; while IRC made efforts to reverse this trend, in many cases irreparable damage had already been done.&lt;ref name="Voorhees" /&gt;

=== Diversification ===
[[File:Argus C3 35mm.jpg|thumb|An [[Argus C3]], produced by [[Argus (camera company)|Argus]] between 1939 and 1966]]

While IRC's radio business was initially successful, it was generally seasonal in nature;&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt; due to better reception in winter&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt; as well as general patterns of behavior before the widespread adoption of [[air conditioning]], sales of radios were much higher during the winter months than during the summer.&lt;ref name="Kuzyk" /&gt; This prompted Verschoor to explore possibilities for expanding the company's product line in order to reduce the slack periods caused by the seasonal variation in its radio sales.&lt;ref name="Mayer" /&gt; Looking for a product that could be produced relatively cheaply and that would also sell well during the summer months, he decided upon an inexpensive [[Leica Camera|Leica]]-inspired [[camera]] that would ultimately become the [[Argus (camera company)|Argus]], which launched to nearly instant success in 1936.&lt;ref name="Kuzyk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Voorhees" /&gt; That same year, when IRC had 150 employees, it sold its Kadette AC/DC [[patent]]s to [[RCA]].&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

=== Final years ===
In 1938, Verschoor departed from IRC after being pressured to leave. By the early 1940s the company was being run by a "modern management team".&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt;

In 1939, International Industries sold its radio-manufacturing business to the company's former General Sales Manager, W. Keene Jackson. After renaming it the Kadette Radio Corporation, Jackson expressed his desire to expand its product line by adding [[television set]]s, vowing that the new company would "employ every technical resource to bring the price of efficient television reception to the point where every American home can enjoy this new art as quickly as possible." However, Jackson's company suffered from the same problems that IRC had, and just a year after its establishment it was already out of business.&lt;ref name="Voorhees" /&gt;

While its radio business had faltered, International Industries had found success in the camera and [[optics|optical equipment]] fields with its Argus line;&lt;ref name="Voorhees" /&gt; by 1942, Argus, Inc.'s sales had climbed to $4,800,000, and during [[World War II]] the company employed 1,200 people.&lt;ref name="Hunt" /&gt; After the war, International Industries and its International Research division became [[wholly owned subsidiary|wholly owned subsidiaries]] of Argus, Inc., and shortly thereafter the International name ceased to exist.&lt;ref name="Voorhees" /&gt;

[[File:FDA_Classification_of_Soft_Contact_Lens_Materials.gif|thumb|FDA Classification of soft contact lenses]]
Soft [[contact lenses]] are one of several types on the U.S. Market approved by the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Denise Hampton, Ph.D|title=Contact Lens Safety - Ophthalmic Devices Panel|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/OphthalmicDevicesPanel/UCM397603.pdf|website=www.fda.gov|publisher=FDA Division of Ophthalmic and Ear, Nose and Throat Devices|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618091821/http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/OphthalmicDevicesPanel/UCM397603.pdf|archivedate=18 Jun 2016|pages=97|format=Microsoft PowerPoint|date=13 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''corrective vision eyewear'' as prescribed by [[optometrists]] and [[ophthamologist]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Contact Lenses - clma.net|url=http://www.clma.net/about-contact-lenses/|website=clma.net|publisher=Contact Lens Manufacturers Association|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Optometric Association]] published a  contact lens comparison chart called ''Advantages and Disadvantages of Various Types of Contact Lenses'' on the differences between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Caring for Your Vision: Advantages and Disadvantages of Various Types of Contact Lenses|url=http://www.aoa.org/patients-and-public/caring-for-your-vision/contact-lenses/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-various-types-of-contact-lenses?sso=y|website=www.aoa.org|publisher=American Optometric Association|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include: 
* soft contact lenses
* rigid gas-permeable (RGP)
* daily wear 
* extended wear
* disposable and 
* planned replacement contact lenses.

==Definition==
The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) states that:
{{block quote|Soft contact lenses are made of soft, flexible plastics that allow oxygen to pass through to the cornea. Soft contact lenses may be easier to adjust to and are more comfortable than rigid gas permeable lenses. Newer soft lens materials include silicone-hydrogels to provide more oxygen to your eye while you wear your lenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Center for Devices and Radiological Health|title=Contact Lenses - Types of Contact Lenses|url=http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/HomeHealthandConsumer/ConsumerProducts/ContactLenses/ucm062319.htm#scl|website=www.fda.gov|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=18 June 2016|language=en}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Types of soft contact lenses==
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) classifies soft contact lenses into four groups for the U.S. Market.  They are also subcategorized into 1st generation, 2nd generation, and 3rd generation lens materials.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aalens.com/fda.html&lt;/ref&gt; These 'water-loving' soft contact lens materials are categorized as
"Conventional Hydrophilic Material Groups ("-filcon"):
{| class="wikitable"

|-

|-
| II || High Water Content || (&gt;50%) || Nonionic

| III || Low Water Content || (&lt;50%) || Ionic
|-
| IV || High Water Content || (&gt;50%) || Ionic
|}
Note: Being ionic in pH = 6.0 - 8.0". This chart was published in the FDA Executive Summary Prepared for the May 13, 2014 Meeting of the Ophthalmic Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ophthalmic Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee|title=FDA Executive Summary Prepared for the May 13, 2014 Meeting of the Ophthalmic Devices Panel of the Medical Devices Advisory Committee|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/OphthalmicDevicesPanel/UCM395577.pdf#page=3|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=18 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150807034704/http://www.fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/MedicalDevices/MedicalDevicesAdvisoryCommittee/OphthalmicDevicesPanel/UCM395577.pdf|archivedate=7 Aug 2015|page=2|language=English|date=May 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contact lens polymers (hydrogel and silicone hydrogel materials) ==
The materials that are classified in the 5 FDA groups include the ones listed in the next 5 sections:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact Lenses: Manufacturing/Chemistry|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../ucm080960.pdf|website=www.fda.gov|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=18 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501105110/http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/.../ucm080960.pdf|archivedate=15 May 2015|pages=25|format=PDF|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Editorial - Should Silicone Hydrogels be Placed in a Separate FDA Soft Contact Lens Category?|url=http://www.siliconehydrogels.org/editorials/oct_04_serina.asp|website=www.siliconehydrogels.org|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The first contact lenses were made of a [[polymer]] called [[polymethylmethacrylate]] (PMMA) and became available in the 1960s. Lenses made of PMMA are called hard lenses.&lt;ref name="RSC.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Polymers in everyday things – Contact Lenses|url=http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/Inspirational/resources/3.1.1.pdf|website=rsc.org|publisher=Royal Society of Chemistry|accessdate=19 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160619083706/http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/Inspirational/resources/3.1.1.pdf|archivedate=19 June 2016|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soft contact lenses made of [[polyacrylamide]] were introduced in 1971.&lt;ref name="RSC.org" /&gt;

===FDA groups and brands===
Below is a list of most contact lens materials on the market, their water percentage, their oxygen permeability rating, and manufacturer brands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact Lens Materials: Water Content|url=http://www.aclens.com/lens-materials.asp|website=www.aclens.com|publisher=aclens.com|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the higher the [[oxygen permeability]] rating, the more oxygen gets to the eye.

'''The Little Cleo''' is a small spoon lure made by the Acme Tackle Company which comes in nine sizes from &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; oz to 1&amp;thinsp;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; oz, and in many different color combinations.  Its wiggling action creates the illusion of an injured baitfish acting erratically, and often instigates reactionary strikes in predatory fish. The Little Cleo, which has been widely available for over a quarter of a century, is one of the most popular lures in use today and according to ''[[Field &amp; Stream]]'' is one of the 50 greatest lures of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fieldandstream.com/fieldstream/photogallery/article/0,13355,1179845_17,00.html The 50 Greatest Lures of All Time - Little Cleo], [[Field &amp; Stream Magazine]]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830164125/http://www.fieldandstream.com/fieldstream/photogallery/article/0,13355,1179845_17,00.html |date=2006-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Little Miss Geek'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://littlemissgeek.org |title=Little Miss Geek |publisher=Little Miss Geek |date=2012-09-25 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a campaign that aims to inspire young women to consider careers in the technology and video-games industries. Little Miss Geek is the non-for-profit subsidiary of [[Lady Geek]], a campaigning agency which aims to make technology more accessible and appealing to women.

== History ==

The campaign was launched on October 3, 2012 at the Apple Store on Regent Street by [[Belinda Parmar]] and her team at [http://ladygeek.com Lady Geek].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ladygeek.com |title=LadyGeek |publisher=LadyGeek |date= |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Little Miss Geek campaign has received coverage in BBC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Parmar |first=Belinda |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19884720 |title=BBC News - Viewpoint: More women needed in technology |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2012-10-11 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; WIRED,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Olivia Solon |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-10/03/little-miss-geek |title=Little Miss Geek campaign encourages more girls into tech careers (Wired UK) |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metro,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=metrowebukmetro |url=http://metro.co.uk/2012/10/22/we-are-the-geeky-girls-the-mission-to-get-girls-creating-gadgets-606036/ |title=We are the Geeky Girls: The mission to get girls creating gadgets &amp;#124; Metro News |publisher=Metro.co.uk |date=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Guardian,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jemima Kiss |url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/oct/01/so-few-women-working-technology |title=Why are so few women working in technology? &amp;#124; Life and style |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2012-10-01|accessdate=2013-06-07 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Independent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rebecca Armstrong |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/kicking-myself-as-lady-geek-catches-the-it-bug-8202190.html |title=Kicking myself as Lady Geek catches the IT bug - Comment - Voices |publisher=The Independent |date=2012-10-08 |accessdate=2013-06-07 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Computer Weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ranford |first=Robyn |url=http://www.computerweekly.com/blogs/witsend/2012/09/little-miss-geek-launch-at-the-apple-store-next-wednesday.html |title=Little Miss Geek launch at the Apple Store next Wednesday - WITsend |publisher=Computerweekly.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Her In Hero Campaign ==
[[File:Theresa May supports Little Miss Geek.jpg|thumb|upright|British MP and Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] supporting the Little Miss Geek campaign in 2013]]
For 2013 [[Ada Lovelace]] Day, Little Miss Geek created a campaign to put the 'Her In Hero'. Saying that 'Brilliant successful women in technology exist, but they are not celebrated in the same way their male counterparts are', the campaign urged schools and MPs to celebrate great female technologists, scientists and inventors to inspire girls with brilliant role models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://littlemissgeek.com/her-in-hero |title=HER In Hero initiative |publisher=Little Miss Geek |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign took place at over 15 schools across the UK, reaching out to over 10,000 students and gaining the support of over 40 MPs including Ms Jo Swinson MP, Hon Ed Vaizey MP, and Rt Hon Theresa May MP. The campaign received media coverage across Metro&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Metro|url=http://metro.co.uk/2013/10/15/ada-lovelace-day-a-celebration-of-the-worlds-first-computer-programmer-4145367/|title=Ada Lovelace Day: A celebration of the world’s first computer programmer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Guardian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/women-in-leadership/2013/oct/15/women-technology-science-careers-her-in-hero|publisher=The Guardian|date=2013-10-15|title=Putting the HER in Hero: why we need more tech superwomen|author=Belinda Parmar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An event was held on the morning of Ada Lovelace Day at [[Highgate Wood School]], featuring a talk from Siobhan Reddy of [[Media Molecule]] on her experiences with the games industry and how she got into it.

== School Takeovers ==

On 8 March 2013 ([[International Women's Day]]) Little Miss Geek ran the ‘Little Miss Geek ICT School Takeover’&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=__start__ |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMXDNJxmjgk |title=Little Miss Geek ICT School Takeover 8.3.13 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; at two schools in London: [[Queen Elizabeth's School for Girls]] and [[St Saviour's and St Olave's Church of England School]]. MP [[Simon Hughes]] attended the session and [[Boris Johnson]] who commented on the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=549636098400679&amp;set=a.159024880795138.32635.124879530876340&amp;type=1&amp;theaterhttps://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=549636098400679&amp;set=a.159024880795138.32635.124879530876340&amp;type=1&amp;theater |title=Tijdlijnfoto's |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The events made use of [[Raspberry Pi]] computers in order to give girls actual software development experience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.news.yahoo.com/interview--the-computer-which-is-teaching-british-children-to-code-154220241.html |title=Interview: The £25 computer which is teaching British children to code - Yahoo! News UK |publisher=Uk.news.yahoo.com |date=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and address the gender imbalance in the technology industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gothinkbig.co.uk/features/gadgets-arent-just-for-guys-ladygeek-want-girls-to-get-gaming/ |title=LadyGeek want girls to get gaming |publisher=Gothinkbig.co.uk |date=2013-03-08 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Parmar, the Takeover events were intended to address an image problem: "girls think that people who work in technology are pizza-loving nerds who can't get girlfriends. The reality is technology is one of the most creative industries out there".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/story/1062240/girl-gamers-transform-pizza-loving-nerd-image |title=Girl Gamers Transform 'Pizza-Loving Nerd' Image |publisher=News.sky.com |date=2013-03-11 |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[Girls are] dreaming of using the iPad mini and the latest smart-phone, but they’re not dreaming of creating it,”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/technology/computer-coding-its-not-just-for-boys.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;|publisher=New York Times|title=Computer Coding: It's Not Just for Boys|author=Beth Gardiner|date=2013-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parmar is a critic of British technology education. She states: "The education system should be the place where we convert childhood experiences with technology into an understanding about computing, where we lay the groundwork for a child to push on into adulthood with not only an interest in tech, but also the skills to start competing in the industry. As it is, however, we are failing our youngsters.”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyrobertson/2013/03/07/little-miss-geek-campaign-offers-tech-inspiration-for-girls/ |title=Little Miss Geek Campaign Offers Tech Inspiration for Girls |publisher=Forbes |date=2012-04-18 |accessdate=2013-06-07 |first=Andy |last=Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Wearable Technology Event ==

On 25 April 2013 Little Miss Geek held a Wearable Tech Event&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGjqgWaAvMs |title=Little Miss Geek - Wearable Tech Event |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in celebration of [http://girlsinict.org/events/international-girls-ict-day International Girls in ICT Day] at [[St Saviour's and St Olave's Church of England School]]. [[Justin Tomlinson]] MP spoke to the girls about why the British Economy needs more women working in technology. The event featured contributions from fashion designer [[Francesca Rosella]], wearable-technology specialists [[Cute Circuit]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephanie Hirschmiller |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/features/istyle-the-future-of-fashion-8595545.html |title=iStyle: The future of fashion - Features - Fashion |publisher=The Independent |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2013-06-07 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ukschools/archive/2013/05/08/little-miss-geek-wearable-tech-event.aspx |title=Little Miss Geek Wearable Tech Event - Microsoft UK Schools blog - Site Home - MSDN Blogs |publisher=Blogs.msdn.com |date=2013-05-08 |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and speakers from the British Fashion Council&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/news/world/542341/little-miss-geek-event-gets-girls-interested-in-technology.html |title=Little Miss Geek Event Gets Girls Interested In Tech |publisher=Marie Claire |date= |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was designed to shatter the "myth that technology is a boys-club".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/belinda-parmar/is-wearable-technology-the-answer-to-get-more-girls-in-tech_b_3286154.html |title=Belinda Parmar: Is Wearable Technology the Answer to Get More Girls in Tech? |publisher=Huffingtonpost.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|Live, Virtual, and Constructive}}
'''Live, Virtual, and Constructive''' ('''LVC''') [[Simulation]] is a broadly used [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] for classifying [[Modeling and simulation|Models and Simulation]] (M&amp;S). However, [[categorization|categorizing]] a [[simulation]] as a live, virtual, or constructive environment is problematic since there is no clear division between these categories. The degree of human participation in a simulation is infinitely variable, as is the degree of equipment realism. The categorization of simulations also lacks a category for simulated people working real equipment.&lt;ref&gt;"DoD Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) Glossary", DoD 5000.59-M, [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]], January 1998 {{cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/500059m.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070710104756/http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/500059m.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories==
The LVC categories as defined by the United States Department of Defense in the Modeling and Simulation Glossary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Department of Defense Modeling and Simulation Glossary|url=http://www.acqnotes.com/Attachments/DoD%20M&amp;S%20Glossary%201%20Oct%2011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as follows:

* '''Live''' -  A simulation involving real people operating real systems. Military training events using real equipment are live simulations. They are considered simulations because they are not conducted against a live enemy.
* '''Virtual''' - A simulation involving real people operating simulated systems. Virtual simulations inject a [[Human-in-the-Loop]] into a central role by exercising [[motor control]] skills (e.g., flying jet or tank simulator), [[decision making]] skills (e.g., committing fire control resources to action), or [[communication skills]] (e.g., as members of a [[C4I]] team).
* '''Constructive''' - A simulation involving simulated people operating simulated systems. Real people stimulate (make inputs to) such simulations, but are not involved in determining the outcomes. A constructive simulation is a computer program. For example, a military user may input data instructing a unit to move and to engage an enemy target. The constructive simulation determines the speed of movement, the effect of the engagement with the enemy and any battle damage that may occur. These terms should not be confused with specific constructive models such as Computer Generated Forces (CGF), a generic term used to refer to computer representations of forces in simulations that attempts to model human behavior. CGF is just one example model being used in a constructive environment. There are many types of constructive models that involve simulated people operating simulated systems.

Other associated terms are as follows:
'''LVC [[Enterprise application integration|Enterprise]]''' - The overall enterprise of resources in which LVC activities take place.
'''LVC [[Enterprise application integration|Integration]]''' - The process of linking LVC simulations through a suitable technology or protocol to exploit simulation [[interoperability]] within a federated simulation environment such as the [[high level architecture (simulation)]] or Eurosim.&lt;ref&gt;"Policy, information and guidance on the Modelling and Simulation aspects of UK MOD Defence Acquisition version 1.0.3 - May 2010", {{cite web |url=http://www.aof.mod.uk/aofcontent/tactical/mands/content/lvc_integration.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904043544/http://www.aof.mod.uk/aofcontent/tactical/mands/content/lvc_integration.htm |archivedate=2011-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurosim.info/&lt;/ref&gt;
'''LVC [[Enterprise application integration|Integrating Architecture]]''' ('''LVC-IA''') - The aggregate representation of the foundational elements of a LVC Enterprise, including [[Hardware-in-the-loop simulation|hardware]], [[Computer software|software]], [[Computer network|networks]], [[database]]s and [[user interface]]s, [[Separation of mechanism and policy|policies]], agreements, [[certifications]]/[[accreditations]] and [[business rules]]. LVC-IA is intrinsically an [[Enterprise Architecture]], given the [[System of systems|system-of-systems]] environment it must support.

LVC-IA bridges M&amp;S technology to the people who need and use the [[information]] gained through [[simulation]]. To accomplish this a LVC-IA provides the following:
* '''[[System Integration|Integration]]''' through simulation equipment, interoperability tools and support personnel. See also [[Enterprise integration]] and [[Enterprise architecture]]. Integration creates '''[[Network centrics|network-centric]]''' linkages to collect, retrieve and [[data exchange|exchange data]] among live [[instrumentation]], virtual simulators and constructive simulations as well as between the joint military and specific [[United States armed forces|service command]] systems. Integration also bridges together '''[[Enterprise Information Integration|data management]]''', [[Military exercise|exercise management]], exercise collaboration and updating [[Military technology and equipment|training support systems.]]
* ''' [[Interoperability]]''' through common [[Communications protocol|protocols]], [[specifications]], [[Technical standard|standards]] and [[interface (computing)|interface]]s to standardize LVC components and tools for mission rehearsals and [[training]], [[Test (assessment)|testing]], [[Simulation Based Acquisition|acquisition]], [[analysis]], [[experiment]]ation, and [[logistics]] [[Strategic planning|planning]].
* ''' [[Composability]] ''' through common and [[Reusability|reusable]] components and tools such as enterprise [[after action review]], adapters, [[Digital elevation model|correlated terrain databases]], [[Multilevel security]] for [[Multinational force|multinational players]] and hardware/software requirements.

Other definitions used in LVC discussions (Webster's dictionary)

# Enterprise:  a project or undertaking that is especially difficult, complicated, or risky
#* A: a unit of economic organization or activity; especially: a business organization
#* B: a systematic purposeful activity
# Environment:  The aggregate of surrounding things, conditions or influences; surroundings
# Construct:  To make or form by combining or arranging components
# Component:  One of the parts of something

Current and emerging technology to enable true LVC technology for Combat Air Forces (CAF) training require standardized definitions of CAF LVC events to be debated and developed.  The dictionary terms used above provide a solid foundation of understanding of the fundamental structure of the LVC topic as applied universally to DoD activities.  The terms and use cases described below are a guidepost for doctrine that uses these terms to eliminate any misunderstanding.  The following paragraph uses these terms to layout the global view, and will be explained in detail throughout the rest of the document.  In short:

{{block quote|Training and Operational Test are conducted through the combined use of three separate Constructs (Live, Simulator and Ancillary) which are in turn made up of several enabling Components to prepare, test and/or train warfighters in their respective disciplines.  The LVC Enterprise, a component of the Live construct, is the totality of personnel, hardware and software that enables warfighters to combine three historically disparate Environments (Live, Virtual and Constructive) to improve performance in their combat role.}}

Central to a functionally accurate understanding of the paragraph above is a working knowledge of the Environment definitions, provided below for clarity:

*Live Environment (L)*:  Warfighters operating their respective disciplines’ operational system in a real-world application

*Virtual Environment (V)*:  Warfighters operating fielded simulators or trainers

*Constructive Environment (C)*:  Computer Generated Forces (CGFs) used to augment and force multiply Live and/or Virtual scenario development

The Environments (L, V, &amp; C) by themselves are generally well understood and apply universally to a diverse range of disciplines such as the medical field, law enforcement or operational military applications.  Using the medical field as an example, the Live Environment can be a doctor performing CPR on a human patient in a critical real world situation.  In this same context, the Virtual Environment would include a doctor practicing CPR on a training mannequin, and the Constructive Environment is the software within the training mannequin that drives its behavior.  In a second example, consider fighter pilot training or operational testing.  The Live environment is the pilot flying the combat aircraft.  The Virtual environment would include that same pilot flying a simulator.  The constructive environment includes the networks, computer generated forces, and weapons servers, etc. that enable the Live and Virtual environments to be connected and interact.  Although there are clearly secondary and tertiary training benefits, it is important to understand combining one or more environments for the purpose of making Live real world performance better is the sole reason the LVC concept was created.  
However, when referring to specific activities or programs designed to integrate the environments across the enterprise, the use and application of terms differ widely across the DoD.  Therefore, the words that describe specifically how future training or operational testing will be accomplished require standardization as well.  This is best described by backing away from technical terminology and thinking about how human beings actually prepare for their specific combat responsibilities.  In practice, human beings prepare for their roles in one of three Constructs:  Live (with actual combat tools), in a Simulator of some kind, or in other Ancillary ways (tests, academics, computer-based training, etc.).  Actions within each of the Constructs are further broken down into Components that specify differing ways to get the job done or achieve training objectives.  The three Constructs are described below:

==Live Construct==
Live is one of three constructs representing humans operating their respective disciplines’ operational system.  Operational system examples could consist of a tank, a naval vessel, an aircraft or eventually even a deployed surgical hospital.  Three components of the Live Construct follow

* Live vs. Live:  Traditional Live vs. Live training is a component of the Live Construct and occurs when Live operational systems interact with one another to augment scenario complexity (incidentally this is how actual combat is accomplished as well; making this component the most fully immersive form of combat training available today)
* LC:  Live, Constructive is a component of the Live Construct whereby CGFs are injected into Live operational systems in a bi-directional, integrated, secure, dynamically adaptable network to augment scenario complexity
* LVC:  Live, Virtual and Constructive (LVC) is a component of the Live Construct whereby Virtual entities and CGFs are injected into Live operational systems in an integrated, secure, dynamically adaptable network to augment scenario complexity

==Simulator Construct==
A second construct representing humans operating simulator devices in lieu of Live operational systems.  The Simulator Construct (the combination of Virtual and Constructive (VC)) is made up of three components that consist of 
* A locally networked set of identical simulators typical of a fighter base (stand-alone simulators)
* A networked set of disparate simulators (Distributed Mission Operations (DMO))
* A locally closed-loop networked enclave of multiple simulator devices in support of High-End Testing, Tactics and Advanced Training (HET3)

==Ancillary Construct==
Is the third construct other than Live or Simulator whereby training is accomplished via many components (not all-inclusive)
* Computer-based instruction
* Self-study 
* Platform instructed academics

Utilizing the definitions above, the following table provides a graphical representation of how the terms relate in the context of CAF Training or Operational Test:

Using the figure above as a guide, it is clear LVC activity is the use of the Virtual and Constructive environments to enhance scenario complexity for the Live environment – and nothing more.  An LVC system must have a bi-directional, adaptable, ad-hoc and secure communication system between the Live environment and the VC environment.  Most importantly, LVC used as a verb is an integrated interaction of the three environments with the Live environment always present.  For example, a Simulator Construct VC event should be called something other than LVC (such as Distributed Mission Operations (DMO)). In the absence of the Live environment LVC and LC do not exist, making the use of the LVC term wholly inappropriate as a descriptor.

As the LVC Enterprise pertains to a training program, LVC lines of effort are rightly defined as “a collaboration of OSD, HAF, MAJCOM, Joint and Coalition efforts toward a technologically sound and fiscally responsible path for training to enable combat readiness.”  The “lines of effort,” in this case, would not include Simulator Construct programs and development but would be limited to the Construct that includes the LVC Enterprise.  The other common term, “Doing LVC” would then imply “readiness training conducted utilizing an integration of Virtual and Constructive assets for augmenting Live operational system scenarios and mission objective outcomes.”   Likewise, LVC-Operational Training (in a CAF fighter training context) or “LVC-OT” are the tools and effort required to integrate Live, Virtual and Constructive mission systems, when needed, to tailor robust and cost-efficient methods of Operational Training and/or Test.

==Misused and extraneous terms==

To ensure clarity of discussions and eliminate misunderstanding, when speaking in the LVC context, only the terms in this document should be used to describe the environments, constructs, and components.  Words like “synthetic” and “digi” should be replaced with  “Constructive” or “Virtual” instead.  Additionally, Embedded Training (ET) systems, defined as a localized or self-contained Live/Constructive system (like on the F-22 or F-35) should not be confused with or referred to as LVC systems.

== History ==
[[File:LVC Architecture Venn Diagram.png|thumb|400px |LVC Simulation Architectures Venn Diagram]]
[[File:Architectures in Use.png|thumb|400px |Usage Frequency of Simulation Architectures]]
Prior to 1990, the field of M&amp;S was marked by fragmentation and limited coordination between activities across key communities.  In recognition of these deficiencies, Congress directed the Department of Defense (DoD) to “... establish an Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) level joint program office for simulation to coordinate simulation policy, to establish interoperability standards and protocols, to promote simulation within the military departments, and to establish guidelines and objectives for coordination [sic] of simulation, wargaming, and training.” (ref Senate Authorization Committee Report, FY91, DoD Appropriations Bill, SR101-521, pp.&amp;nbsp;154–155, October 11, 1990) Consistent with this direction, the [[Defense Modeling and Simulation Office]] (DMSO) was created, and shortly afterwards many DoD Components designated organizations and/or points of contact to facilitate coordination of M&amp;S activities within and across their communities. 
For over a decade, the ultimate goal of the DoD in M&amp;S is to create a LVC-IA to assemble models and simulations quickly, which create an operationally [[Verification and Validation (software)|valid]] LVC environment to train, develop doctrine and tactics, formulate operational plans and assess warfighting situations. A common use of these LVC environments will promote closer interaction between operations and acquisition communities. These M&amp;S environments will be constructed from [[Composability|composeable]] components interoperating through an integrated architecture. A robust M&amp;S capability enables the DOD to meet operational and support objectives effectively across the diverse activities of the military services, combatant commands and agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Strategic Vision for DOD Modeling and Simulation; http://www.msco.mil/files/Strategic_Vision_Goals.pdf, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;“Modeling and Simulation Master Plan”, DoD 5000.59P, Oct 1995, http://www.everyspec.com/DoD/DoD-PUBLICATIONS/DoD5000--59_P_2258/&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of available architectures have increased over time. M&amp;S trends indicate that once a community of use develops around an architecture, that architecture is likely to be used regardless of new architectural developments. M&amp;S trends also indicate that few, if any, architectures will be retired as new ones come online. When a new architecture is created to replace one or more of the existing set, the likely outcome is one more architecture will be added to the available set. As the number of mixed-architecture events increase over time, the inter-architecture communication problem increases as well.&lt;ref&gt;Henninger, Amy E., Cutts, Dannie, Loper, Margaret, et al., “Live Virtual Constructive Architecture Roadmap (LVCAR) Final Report”, Institute for Defense Analysis, Sept. 2008, {{cite web |url=http://www.msco.mil/files/MSCO%20Online%20Library/LVCAR%20-%201%20of%205%20-%20Final%20Report%20-%2020090814.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722190632/http://www.msco.mil/files/MSCO%20Online%20Library/LVCAR%20-%201%20of%205%20-%20Final%20Report%20-%2020090814.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

M&amp;S has made significant progress in enabling users to link critical resources through distributed architectures.

In the mid 1980s, [[SIMNET]] became the first successful implementation of a large-scale, real-time, man-in-the-loop simulator networking for team training and mission rehearsal in military operations. The earliest successes that came through the SIMNET program was the demonstration that geographically dispersed simulation systems could support distributed training by interacting with each other across network connections.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, D. C.; Thorpe, J. A. (1995). SIMNET: the advent of simulator networking; Proceedings of the IEEE Volume: 83 Issue: 8 Aug 1995 Page(s): 1114-1123, cited in Henniger, Amy, et al., "Live Virtual Constructive Architecture Roadmap Final report"&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol]] (ALSP) extended the benefits of distributed simulation to the force-level training community so that different aggregate-level simulations could cooperate to provide theater-level experiences for battle-staff training. The ALSP has supported an evolving “confederation of models” since 1992, consisting of a collection of infrastructure software and protocols for both inter-model communication through a common interface and time advance using a conservative Chandy-Misra-based algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Weatherly | first1 = Richard M.| last2 = Wilson | first2 = Annette L.| last3 = Canova | first3 = Bradford S.| last4 = Page | first4 = Ernest H.| last5 = Zabek | first5 = Anita A.| last6 = Fischer | first6 = Mary C.| chapter = Advanced distributed simulation through the Aggregate Level Simulation Protocol | doi = 10.1109/HICSS.1996.495488 | title = Proceedings of HICSS-29: 29th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences| conference = [[Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences]].&amp;nbsp;| pages = 407 | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-8186-7324-5 | pmid =  | pmc = | citeseerx = 10.1.1.37.4784}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At about the same time, the SIMNET protocol evolved and matured into the [[Distributed Interactive Simulation]] (DIS) Standard. DIS allowed an increased number of simulation types to interact in distributed events, but was primarily focused on the platform-level training community. DIS provided an open network protocol standard for linking real-time platform-level wargaming simulations.&lt;ref&gt;Murray,Robert;"DIS Overview and Version 7 Information", SISO; http://www.sisostds.org/DesktopModules/Bring2mind/DMX/Download.aspx?Command=Core_Download&amp;EntryId=29289&amp;PortalId=0&amp;TabId=105&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid 1990s, the [[Defense Modeling and Simulation Office]] (DMSO) sponsored the [[High Level Architecture]] (HLA) initiative. Designed to support and supplant both DIS and ALSP, investigation efforts were started to prototype an infrastructure capable of supporting these two disparate applications. The intent was to combine the best features of DIS and ALSP into a single architecture that could also support uses in the analysis and acquisition communities while continuing to support training applications.

The DoD test community started development of alternate architectures based on their perception that HLA yielded unacceptable performance and included reliability limitations. The real-time test range community started development of the [[Test and Training Enabling Architecture]] (TENA) to provide low-latency, high-performance service in the hard-real-time application of integrating live assets in the test-range setting. TENA, through its common infrastructure, including the TENA Middleware and other complementary architecture components, such as the TENA Repository, Logical Range Archive, and other TENA utilities and tools, provides the architecture and software implementation and capabilities necessary to quickly and economically enable interoperability
among range systems, facilities, and simulations.&lt;ref&gt;Hudges, Ed; The Test and Training Enabling Architecture (TENA) Enabling Interoperability Among Ranges, Facilities, and Simulations;{{cite web |url=http://www.sapmea.asn.au/conventions/sete2010/downloads/Tutorial%20F.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706100047/http://www.sapmea.asn.au/conventions/sete2010/downloads/Tutorial%20F.pdf |archivedate=2011-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Powell, E.; Range System Interoperability.

Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the U.S. Army started the development of the [[Common Training Instrumentation Architecture]] (CTIA) to link a large number of live assets requiring a relatively narrowly bounded set of data for purposes of providing [[After-action review|After Action Reviews]] (AARs) on Army training ranges in the support of large-scale exercises.&lt;ref&gt;"COMBAT TRAINING CENTER - INSTRUMENTATION SYSTEM", PEO STRI; http://www.peostri.army.mil/combat-training-center-instrumentation-system-ctc-is-&lt;/ref&gt;

Other efforts that make the LVC architecture space more complex include universal interoperability software packages such as OSAMS&lt;ref&gt;Steinman,Jeffrey;"A Proposed Open System Architecture for Modeling and Simulation";presentation to JPEO; 2007;http://www.dtic.mil/ndia/2007cbis/wednesday/steinmanWed430.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; or CONDOR&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | last1 = Wallace | first1 = Jeffrey W. | last2 = Hannibal | first2 = Barbara J. | title = A Naturalistic Approach to Complex, Intelligent System Development and Integration | booktitle = Proceedings of the 2006 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, ICAI 2006 | year = 2006 | volume = 2 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.85.4259 }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed and distributed by commercial vendors.

As of 2010 all of the DoD architectures remain in service with the exception of SIMNET. Of the remaining architectures: CTIA, DIS, HLA, ALSP and TENA, some are in early and growing use (e.g., CTIA, TENA) while others have seen a user-base reduction (e.g., ALSP). Each of the architectures is providing an acceptable level of capability within the areas where they have been adopted. However, DIS, HLA, TENA, and CTIA-based federations are not inherently interoperable with each other. when simulations rely on different architectures, additional steps must be taken to ensure effective communication between all applications. These additional steps, typically involving interposing gateways or bridges between the various architectures, may introduce increased risk, complexity, cost, level of effort, and preparation time. Additional problems extend beyond the implementation of individual simulation events. As a single example, the ability to reuse supporting models, personnel (expertise), and applications across the different protocols is limited. The limited inherent interoperability between the different protocols introduces a significant and unnecessary barrier to the integration of live, virtual, and constructive simulations.

== Challenges ==
The current status of LVC interoperability is fragile and subject to several reoccurring problems that must be resolved (often anew) whenever live, virtual or constructive simulation systems are to be components in a mixed-architecture simulation event. Some of the attendant problems stem from simulation system capability limitations and other system-to-system incompatibilities. Other types of problems arise from the general failure to provide a framework which achieves a more complete semantic-level interoperability between disparate systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Zeigler, Saurabh Mittal, Xiaolin Hu; "Towards a Formal Standard for Interoperability in M&amp;S/System of Systems Integration", AFCEA-George Mason University Symposium, May 2008;{{cite web |url=http://c4i.gmu.edu/events/reviews/2008/papers/2_Zeigler_Mittal_Hu.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702183148/http://c4i.gmu.edu/events/reviews/2008/papers/2_Zeigler_Mittal_Hu.pdf |archivedate=2010-07-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interoperability, Integration and Composeablity have been identified as the most technical challenging aspects of a LVC-IA since at least 1996. The ''Study on the Effectiveness of Modeling and Simulation in the Weapon System Acquisition Process''&lt;ref&gt;Patenaude, A;"Study on the Effectiveness of Modeling and Simulation in the Weapon System Acquisition Process";SAIC for the Director, Test, Systems Engineering and Evaluation Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Logistics and Technology; 1996; http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=ADA327774&amp;Location=U2&amp;doc=GetTRDoc.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; identified cultural and managerial challenges as well. By definition a LVC-IA is a [[sociotechnical systems|socialtechnical system]], a technical system that interacts directly with people. The following table identifies the 1996 challenges associated with the technical, cultural and managerial aspects. In addition, the challenges or gaps found in a 2009 study are also included.&lt;ref&gt;Funaro, Gregory, “Measures of Effectiveness for Live, Virtual, Constructive Integrated Architectures”, 09F-SIW-028 , SISO Conference, 2009;&lt;/ref&gt; The table shows there is little difference between the challenges of 1996 and the challenges of 2009.

A virtual or constructive model usually focuses on the fidelity or accuracy of the element being represented.  A live simulation, by definition represents the highest fidelity, since it is reality. But a simulation quickly becomes more difficult when it is created from various live, virtual and constructive elements, or sets of simulations with various network protocols, where each simulation consists of a set of live, virtual and constructive elements. The LVC simulations are [[socialtechical systems]] due to the interaction between people and technology in the simulation.  The users represent stakeholders from across the acquisition, analysis, testing, training, planning and experimentation communities. M&amp;S occurs across the entire [[Joint Capabilities Integration Development System]] (JCID) lifecycle. See the "M&amp;S in the JCID Process" figure. A LVC-IA is also considered an [[ultra large scale systems|Ultra Large Scale (ULS) system]] due to the use by a wide variety of stakeholders with conflicting needs and the continuously evolving construction from heterogeneous parts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sei.cmu.edu/uls/&lt;/ref&gt; By definition, people are not just users but elements of a LVC simulation.

During the development of various LVC-IA environments, attempts to understand the foundational elements of integration, composability and interoperability emerged. As of 2010, our understanding of these three elements are still evolving, just as software development continues to evolve. Consider software architecture; as a concept it was first identified in the research work of Edsger Dijkstra in 1968 and David Parnas in the early 1970s. The area of software architecture was only recently adopted in 2007 by ISO as ISO/IEC 42010:2007. Integration is routinely described using the methods of architectural and software patterns. The functional elements of integration can be understood due to universality of integration patterns, e.g. [[Data transformation|Mediation]] (intra-communication) and [[Federation (information technology)|Federation]] (inter-communication); process, data [[Synchronization (computer science)|synchronization]] and [[concurrency pattern]]s.

A LVC-IA is dependent on the Interoperability and Composability attributes, not just the technical aspects, but the social or cultural aspects as well. There are sociotechnical challenges, as well as ULS system challenges associated with these features. An example of a cultural aspect is the problem of composition validity. In an ULS the ability to control all interfaces to ensure a valid composition is extremely difficult. The VV&amp;A paradigms are challenged to identify a level of acceptable validity.

=== Interoperability ===
The study of interoperability concerns methodologies to interoperate different systems distributed over a network system. Andreas Tolk introduced the [[Conceptual interoperability|Levels of Conceptual Interoperability Model]] (LCIM) which identified seven levels of interoperability among participating systems as a method to describe technical interoperability and the complexity of interoperations.&lt;ref&gt;Chungman Seo, Bernard P. Zeigler;"DEVS NAMESPACE FOR INTEROPERABLE DEVS/SOA";Proceedings of the 2009 Winter Simulation Conference; {{cite web |url=http://www.acims.arizona.edu/PUBLICATIONS/PDF/2009/WSC_interoperability_6_1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627111356/http://www.acims.arizona.edu/PUBLICATIONS/PDF/2009/WSC_interoperability_6_1.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Zeigler's Architecture for M&amp;S extends on the three basic levels of interoperability; pragmatic, semantic, and syntactic. The pragmatic level focuses on the receiver’s interpretation of messages in the context of application relative to the sender’s intent. The semantic level concerns definitions and attributes of terms and how they are combined to provide shared meaning to messages. The syntactic level focuses on a structure of messages and adherence to the rules governing that structure. The linguistic interoperability concept supports simultaneous testing environment at multiple levels. The LCIM associate the lower layers with the problems of simulation interoperation while the upper layers relate to the problems of reuse and composition of models. They conclude “simulation systems are based on models and their assumptions and constraints. If two simulation systems are combined, these assumptions and constraints must be aligned accordingly to ensure meaningful results”. This suggests that levels of interoperability that have been identified in the area of M&amp;S can serve as guidelines to discussion of information exchange in general. The Zeigler Architecture provides an [[architecture description language]] or conceptual model in which to discuss M&amp;S. The LCIM provides a conceptual model as a means to discuss integration, interoperability and composability. The three linguistic elements relates the LCIM to the Ziegler conceptual model. Architectural and structural complexity an area of research in systems theory to measure the [[Cohesion (computer science)|cohesion]] and [[Coupling (computer science)|coupling]] and is based on the metrics commonly used in software development projects. Zeigler, Kim, and Praehofer presents a theory of modeling and simulation which provides a conceptual framework and an associated computational approach to methodological problems in M&amp;S. The framework provides a set of entities and relations among the entities that, in effect, present a ontology of the M&amp;S domain.&lt;ref&gt;Zeigler, B. P., Kim, T.G., and Praehofer, H., Theory of Modeling and Simulation, New York, NY, Academic Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Composability ===
Petty and Weisel&lt;ref&gt;Petty, M.D. and Weisel, E.W. (2003). A Composability Lexicon. Proceedings IEEE Spring Simulation Interoperability Workshop, IEEE CS Press; http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~rgb2u/03S-SIW-023.doc&lt;/ref&gt; formulated the current working definition: "Composability is the capability to select and assemble simulation components in various combinations into simulation systems to satisfy specific user requirements." Both a technical and user interaction is required indicative of a sociotechnical system is involved. The ability for a user to access data or access models is an important factor when considering composability metrics. If the user does not have visibility into a repository of models, the aggregation of models becomes problematic.

In ''Improving the Composability of Department of Defense Models and Simulation'', the factors associated with the ability to provide composability are as follows:
* The complexity of the system being modeled. The size (complexity) of the M&amp;S environment.
* The difficulty of the objective for the context in which the composite M&amp;S will be used. The flexibility of exploration, extensibility.
* The strength of underlying science and technology, including standards.
* Human considerations, such as the quality of management, having a common community of interest, and the skill and knowledge of the work force.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, P.K. and Anderson, R.H. (2003).  [http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/2004/RAND_MG101.pdf Improving the Composability of Department of Defense Models and Simulations.]  RAND Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolk&lt;ref&gt;Simon J. E Taylor, Azam Khan, Katherine L. Morse, Andreas Tolk, Levent Yilmaz, Justyna Zander, and Pieter J. Mosterman (2015): “Grand Challenges for Modeling and Simulation: Simulation Everywhere - From Cyberinfrastructure to Clouds to Citizens,” SIMULATION Vol.91, pp. 648-665, DOI: 10.1177/0037549715590594&lt;/ref&gt; introduced an alternative view on Composability, focusing more on the need for conceptual alignment:
{{block quote|The M&amp;S community understands interoperability quite well as the ability to exchange information and to use the data exchanged in the receiving system. Interoperability can be engineered into a system or a service after definition and implementation. ...{{pb}}Composability is different from interoperability. Composability is the consistent representation of truth in all participating systems. It extends the ideas of interoperability by adding the pragmatic level to cover what happens within the receiving system based on the received information. In contrast to interoperability, composability cannot be engineered into a system after the fact. Composability requires often significant changes to the simulation.}}
In other words: Propertied concepts, if they are modeled in more than one participating system, have to represent the same truth. It is not allowed for composable systems to gain different answer to the same question in both systems. The requirement for consistent representation of truth supersedes the requirement for meaningful use of received information known from interoperability.

=== LVC requires integratability, interoperability, and composability ===

Page et al.&lt;ref&gt;Page, E.H., Briggs, R., and Tufarolo, J.A. (2004).  Toward a Family of Maturity Models for the Simulation Interconnection Problem.  Proceedings of the Spring 2004 Simulation Interoperability Workshop, IEEE CS Press&lt;/ref&gt; suggest defining '''integratability''' contending with the physical/technical realms of connections between systems, which include hardware and firmware, protocols, networks, etc., '''interoperability''' contending with the software and implementation details of interoperations; this includes exchange of data elements via interfaces, the use of middleware, mapping to common information exchange models, etc., and '''composability''' contending with the alignment of issues on the modeling level. As captured, among others, by Tolk,&lt;ref&gt;Tolk, A. (2010). Interoperability and Composability. Chapter 12 in J.A. Sokolowski and C.M. Banks (Eds): Modeling and Simulation Fundamentals - Theoretical Underpinnings and Practical Domains, John Wiley, 403-433&lt;/ref&gt; successful interoperation of solutions of LVC components requires ''integratability of infrastructures, interoperability of systems, and composability of models''. LVC Architectures must holistically address all three aspects in well aligned systemic approaches.

==Economic drivers==
To produce the greatest impact from its investments, the DoD needs to manage its M&amp;S programs utilizing an enterprise-type approach. This includes both identifying gaps in M&amp;S capabilities that are common across the enterprise and providing seed moneys to fund projects that have widely applicable payoffs, and conducting M&amp;S investment across the Department in ways that are systematic and transparent. In particular, “Management processes for models, simulations, and data that … Facilitate the cost effective and efficient development of M&amp;S systems and capabilities….” such as are cited in the vision statement require comprehensive Departmental M&amp;S best-practice investment strategies and processes. M&amp;S investment management requires metrics, both for quantifying the extent of potential investments and for identifying and understanding the full range of benefits resulting from these investments. There is at this time no consistent guidance for such practice.&lt;ref&gt;AEgis;Metrics for Modeling and Simulation (M&amp;S) Investments, REPORT No. TJ-042608-RP013;2008;http://www.msco.mil/files/MSCO%20Online%20Library/MSCO%20-%20Metrics%20for%20M&amp;S%20Investments%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722190817/http://www.msco.mil/files/MSCO%20Online%20Library/MSCO%20-%20Metrics%20for%20M%26S%20Investments%20-%20Final%20Report.pdf |date=2011-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:LVC Continuum.PNG|thumb|400px|right|LVC Continuum]]

The development &amp; use costs associated with LVC can be summarized as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Michael J., and Phillips, Mark, "The Application of Live, Virtual and Constructive Simulation to Training for Operations Other Than War", [[Simulation Industry Association of Australia]], 3 February 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Furness, Zach , Tyler, John, "Fully Automated Simulation Forces (FAFs): A Grand Challenge for Military Training", 01F-SIW-007, [[Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization]], 2001 [http://www.mitre.org/work/tech_papers/tech_papers_01/furness_fullyauto/furness_fullyauto.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Live''' - Relatively high cost since it is very [[Human resources|human resource]]/[[materiel]] intensive and not particularly repeatable.
* '''Virtual''' - Relatively medium cost since it is less [[Human resources|human resource]]/[[materiel]] intensive, some reuse can occur, and repeatability is moderate.
* '''Constructive''' - Relatively low cost since it is the least [[Human resources|human resource]]/[[materiel]] intensive, reuse is high, and repeatability is high.

In contrast, the [[fidelity]] of M&amp;S is highest in Live, lower in Virtual, and lowest in Constructive.  As such, [[United States Department of Defense|DoD]] policy is a mixed use of LVC through the [[Military Acquisition]] life cycle, also known as the [[LVC Continuum]].  In the [[LVC Continuum]] figure to the right, the [[JCIDS]] process is related to the relative use of LVC through the [[Military Acquisition]] life cycle.

'''Maclaren''' is a manufacturer of [[Baby transport|baby buggies, strollers and carriers]] based in [[England]].

==Product range==
Strollers based around [[Owen Maclaren]]'s original design are sold in over 50 countries under the Maclaren brand. These include the Maclaren Volo, Globetrotter, Triumph, Quest, Techno XT, and Techno XLR.

==Financial difficulties==
In September 2000, the company went into receivership with large debts and was subsequently acquired by a family based in Monaco and Switzerland. The factory in [[Long Buckby]] closed in October 2000, and production was moved to [[Shenzhen]], China.

On 29 December 2011, the U.S. unit of Maclaren filed for Chapter 7 Liquidation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2012/03/02/maclaren-a-stroller-maker-in-bankruptcy/|title=For Stroller Maker, Bankruptcy Is Latest Setback|last=Martin|first=Peter Lattman and Andrew|work=DealBook|access-date=2018-11-04|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the company is considered one of the biggest players in this industry.

==Recall of strollers==
In November 2009, Maclaren voluntarily recalled its entire line of buggies sold in the U.S. and produced from 1999-2009, citing 12 reported fingertip [[amputation]]s in its hinges. The company will provide free hinge covers for all consumers and advises against using the buggies until the hinge covers are installed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recall.maclaren.us/ Maclaren US stroller recall notice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101114080625/http://recall.maclaren.us/ |date=2010-11-14 }}, accessed 2010-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml10/10033.html CPSC-Maclaren joint press release] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113153315/http://www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/prerel/prhtml10/10033.html |date=2010-11-13 }}, accessed 2010-11-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maul Camera Rocket''' was a [[rocket]] for [[aerial photography]] developed by [[Alfred Maul]]'s company from 1903 to 1912. The Maul Camera Rocket was demonstrated in 1912 to the [[Austria]]n Army and tested as a means for [[reconnaissance]] in the [[Turkish-Bulgarian War]] in 1912/1913.  It was not used afterwards, because [[aircraft]] were much more effective.

The Maul Camera Rocket had a maximum flight altitude of 1 kilometre (3,300 ft), a launch mass of 42 kg (93 pounds), a diameter of 0.32 metre (12½ inches), a length of 6 metres (19 ft 8 in) and a fin span of 0.35 metres (1 ft 2 in).

The '''Metadata Working Group''' was formed in 2006 by [[Adobe Systems]], [[Apple Computers|Apple]], [[Canon (company)|Canon]], [[Microsoft]] and [[Nokia]]. [[Sony]] joined later in 2008.

The focus of the group is to advance the [[interoperability]] of [[metadata]] stored in [[digital media]]. Its specification, [http://www.metadataworkinggroup.org/pdf/mwg_guidance.pdf Guidelines for Handling Image Metadata], defined the interoperability among [[Exif]], [[IPTC Information Interchange Model|IIM]] (old [[IPTC]]), and [[Extensible Metadata Platform|XMP]] with consumer digital images. The following properties were selected for interoperability:
* keywords
* description
* date and time
* orientation
* rating
* copyright
* creator
* location created
* location shown

[[Test file]]s for [[verification and validation|verification]] were added in 2008 and area available for [http://metadataworkinggroup.com/specs/test_files.html download].

The '''Nintendo 3DS family'''&lt;ref&gt;''Nintendo 3DS hardware questions'' http://www.nintendo.com.au/nintendo-3ds-hardware-questions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Nintendo Support'' http://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/landing/p/430&lt;/ref&gt; is a family of [[handheld game console]]s developed and sold by [[Nintendo]] since 2011. It succeeded the [[Nintendo DS family]].

Throughout its lifetime, [[Sony]]'s [[PlayStation Vita]] has been the main market competitor to the Nintendo 3DS family. There have been six models in the 3DS family: the original [[Nintendo 3DS]] and its XL variant, the [[Nintendo 2DS]], and the [[New Nintendo 3DS]] and its XL variant, as well as the [[New Nintendo 2DS XL]]. Similar to the Nintendo DS family, which has been highly successful, the Nintendo 3DS family has also been successful, with nearly 69 million units shipped as of late September 2017.

{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2018}}
{{expand section|date=January 2015}}

=== Circle Pad Pro ===
The Circle Pad Pro can attach to the Nintendo 3DS, and adds a second circle pad and ZR/ZL digital triggers. A model for the Nintendo 3DS XL, the Circle Pad Pro XL, is also available.

=== Nintendo 3DS Stand ===
This accessory came bundled exclusively with every retail copy of ''[[Kid Icarus: Uprising]]''. The stand made the game, and other games with similar controls such as ''[[Liberation Maiden]]'', easier to play for various users, as it helped free the tension of suspending the console with one hand since the other hand would be using the stylus on the touch screen for longer periods than usual.

=== NFC Reader ===
An NFC platform reader for Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo 3DS XL, and Nintendo 2DS was released on September 25, 2015 alongside ''[[Animal Crossing: Happy Home Designer]]''. This peripheral allows [[Amiibo]] and other NFC-based items to be supported on the aforementioned consoles. The New Nintendo 3DS comes with an NFC reader already built-in.

'''NorthStar Alarm''', also known as NorthStar Home or NorthStar Alarm Services, LLC, is a Utah-based home security provider that was founded in 2000. NorthStar is an authorized [[Honeywell]] Security Products Dealer, headquartered in [[Orem, Utah]], and services homeowners and residents in 20 states throughout the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northstaralarm.com/index.php?p=Locations|title=Northstar Alarm Locations|publisher=Northstaralarm.com|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
NorthStar Home was formed in 2000, originally to take advantage of unique marketing opportunities created with the deregulation of public utilities brought about by the [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c102:H.R.776.ENR:|title=Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Enrolled Bill (Final as Passed Both House and Senate)|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=May 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its original focus was in the telecommunication and energy markets. Because of the strong sales background of the company and its management, other service companies expressed interest in working with NorthStar to increase their customer base.

The company began operating sales offices in [[Ohio]]. Since then, the company has established a customer base in [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Arizona]], [[California]], [[Colorado]], [[Idaho]], [[Indiana]], [[Michigan]], [[North Carolina]], [[Nevada]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Oregon]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Texas]], [[Utah]] and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northstaralarm.com/index.php?p=Locations|title=Northstar Alarm Locations|publisher=Northstaralarm.com|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; NorthStar partners with UL listed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ul.com/global/eng/pages/corporate/standards/|title=UL Standards|publisher=Ul.com|accessdate=1 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rapid Response Monitoring to provide advanced digital and two-way voice monitoring available.

In January 2015, it was announced that NorthStar would acquire 8000 accounts from Vision Security, effectively expanding the company's reach into Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania and Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.securitysales.com/article/northstar_alarm_acquires_8k_accounts_from_vision_security&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.heraldextra.com/business/local/northstar-alarm-acquires-assets-from-vision-security/article_5bd6f85a-bb8e-554e-8163-2973a9b3d0cf.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oil-based mud'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyons|first=William C.|title=Standard Handbook of Petroleum and Natural Gas Engineers|year=1996|publisher=Gulf Publishing Company|location=Houston Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a [[drilling fluid]] used in [[drilling engineering]]. It is composed of oil as the [[continuous phase]] and water as the [[dispersed phase]] in conjunction with [[emulsifier]]s, [[wetting agent]]s and [[gellant]]s. The oil base can be [[diesel fuel|diesel]], [[kerosene]], [[fuel oil]], selected [[crude oil]] or [[mineral oil]].

The requirements are a gravity of 36–37 API, a [[flash point]] of {{convert|180|F|C|abbr=on}}, [[fire point]] of {{convert|200|F|C|abbr=on}} and an [[aniline point]] of {{convert|140|F|C|abbr=on}}.

Emulsifiers are important to oil-based mud due to the likelihood of contamination. The water phase of oil-based mud can be [[freshwater]], or a solution of [[sodium]] or [[calcium chloride]]. The external phase is oil and does not allow the water to contact the formation. The [[shale]]s don't become water wet.

Poor stability of the emulsion results in the two layers separating into two distinct layers. 
The advantages are: 
# high drilling rates
# lowered drill pipe [[torque]] and drag,
# less bit balling and
# reduction in [[differential sticking]].

Oil-based muds are expensive, but are worth the cost when drilling through: 
# troublesome shales that would otherwise swell and disperse in water based mud e.g. [[smectite]], 
# to drill deep, high-temperature holes that [[dehydrate]] water-based mud, 
# to drill water-soluble zones and 
# to drill producing zones.

The disadvantages of using oil-based mud, especially in wildcat wells are:
#Inability to analyze oil shows in cuttings, because the oil-based mud has fluorescence confusing with the original oil formation.
#Contamination samples of cuttings, cores, sidewall cores for geochemical analysis of TOC and masks the real determination of API gravity due to this contamination.
#Contaminate areas of freshwater aquifers causing environmental damage.
#Disposal of cuttings in an appropriate place to isolate possible environmental contamination.

This mud type can be used as a completion and workover fluid, a spotting fluid to relieve a stuck pipe and as packer or casing fluid. They are very good for "Gumbo" shales. The mud weight can be controlled from 7–22&amp;nbsp;lbs/gal. It is sensitive to temperature but does not dehydrate as in the case of water based mud as mentioned before. It has no limit on the drilled solids concentration. The water phase should be maintained above a pH of 7. Stability of the emulsion depends on the [[alkaline]] value.

'''Open sustainability innovation''' is the use of [[open innovation]] in the development of [[Sustainable product development|sustainable products]], services and initiatives. This is an approach to [[marketing]] for companies may prove to be advantageous as it is not point of sale based, but rather offers consumers information they have previously never been exposed to. Creating a basis for more long term conversational relationships. As a result of this conversational relationship between companies and consumers ideas about the importance of sustainability and how people relate to this through consumption can arise. By offering an open communication way of marketing to consumers, companies may ultimately gain a competitive advantage based on trust and disclosure. Thus not only will open sustainability innovations promote the use of sustainable products and services, it will actually create a snowballing effect to other companies who will have to adopt new sustainability practices in order to remain on the market.&lt;ref name="BFM"&gt;{{cite book|last=Belz|first=Frank-Martin|title=Sustainability Marketing|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd|location=West Sussex|isbn=978-0-470-51922-6|author2=Ken Peattie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How to put open innovation in a sustainability context ==

The key to open innovation is the integration of the consumers’ ideas into the process of innovation. This means that the creation of the innovation should come largely from the consumer’s input and ideas. Or the marketing strategy shows the consumer any externalities that the product may incur to the environment or compare it to other products on the market that are less sustainable. In any case, it is important to remember that these initiatives are largely conversational. The company must be willing to give much more information to the consumer than was ever really accepted in conventional marketing and the consumer must play a part by bringing in his own ideas and feelings. This entails that the issue of trust is not uni-lateral, the consumer gains trust from the company because of the interaction, but the company must first trust the consumers in order to spend the money, time and knowledge on their open strategy.&lt;ref name="BFM" /&gt;

== History ==

As the world is becoming a more globalized society and more and more people are adopting the western consumption patterns, there has been a coinciding concern for the impact on our environment incurred by the production, distribution, use and disposal of consumer goods. As a result of this awareness, there are more and more consumers who take sustainability as an important factor in their consumer intent and behavior. Thus it has become beneficial for companies to also not only adopt sustainable practice but also to involve these concerned consumers in that practice. The first companies to adopt sustainable open innovation in their marketing strategies acknowledged that only providing more sustainable products and services, but leaving out a communication about those new practices would not be enough to encourage the rest of the market to be more sustainable. By opening their new practices to the consumer, they put themselves on a platform where others would have to do the same or face failure in the market. "There were some early developments in key industries during the 1980s and 1990s when the major players in the electronics industry collaborated with the goal of eliminating CFCs as a solvent in electronic assembly processes; and the quest for low emission vehicle technologies created some unprecedented levels of information sharing between the 'Big Three' car manufacturers. However, such collaborations were a long way from truly 'opening up'."{{cite quote|date=June 2018}} This example represents the position that any kind of open sustainability innovation incurs on the market. Rather than seeking out a new product or new advertising scheme, companies look to each other as leaders in the industry, and customers, in turn have the opportunity to understand what they are really consuming.&lt;ref name="BFM" /&gt;

== Sustainability innovations ==

[[Sustainability innovations]] play a crucial role in the process of developing successful sustainability marketing strategies. Passively heated houses, solar cells, organic food, fair trade products, hybrid cars and car sharing are just some vivid examples of sustainability innovations. Sustainability innovation is an outstanding way for acquisition of both competitive advantage and differentiation. If the aim of sustainability marketing is to transform the society to a more sustainable one, innovations should not be restricted just to technological innovations. At a first step, in many markets sustainability innovations presuppose so called soft innovations in social practices, finance and business relationships. The innovation is not necessarily a new product or a product advancement, but also entails brand new ways to communicate products, new ways to operate focus groups or using internet tools to have idea generating systems in order to learn from the consumers.
In the last years, sustainability performance of products and services has experienced continuous improvements. The above-mentioned examples of sustainable products became produced at lower cost, in a more resource efficient way and satisfied the increasing consumer concerns about sustainability issues. For example, especially in the last decade e.g. fuel efficiency improvements in cars, increased use of recycled materials in packaging and growth in fairly traded commodities and organic foods has been witnessed by consumers, non-government organizations, policy makers and companies alike. Nevertheless, some critics exist about these kinds of product improvement, emphasizing that they are only capable of achieving certain level of eco improvement and also in many cases the potential gains already exist or are known to the manufacturers. 
&lt;ref name="BFM"/&gt;

=== Product improvements vs. radical changes ===

In most companies there is a power struggle between the Quality Management departments and the environmental management departments because though the environmental people want to make changes to products in order for them to be more economically efficient, the Quality people do not want to sacrifice the efficiency and product qualities that are already enjoyed by the consumer. These quality management systems, however have a very big challenge moving into a more sustainable minded consumption world, because they have based their innovations on gradual continuous improvement, and they align their development with the status quo of the industry. This may prove to be a barrier because the changes needed to reach more sustainable products and services is quite radical, hence this struggle as stated before. This kind of deficiency can be sorted out by complementing environmental management systems by other kinds of systems and approaches that favour new discoveries of alternative approaches and nonstop searching for more radical, "step change" solutions to sustainability challenges.&lt;ref name="BFM" /&gt;

=== Eco-efficiency curves ===

Step change solutions contain "as a series of waves or types of innovation that can deliver increasing levels of eco-efficiency until a sustainable global economy can be established".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brezet|first=Han|title=Eco-Design: A promising Approach to Sustainable Production and Consumption|year=1997|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP)|location=Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each wave is I shown as an S-curve in this model and these S-curves are similar to the conventional product life cycles depicted in conventional models. It shows that over time the eco-efficiency or environmental benefits of products actually decreases over time. Thus moving along in time, the new curves and their very radical new approaches over ride the ones of the older curves. The model follows four steps of sustainable design innovation and change.&lt;ref name="BFM" /&gt; Following are the four steps: 
*Product improvement: Changes made to an existing product that improve pollution prevention and other environmental impacts of the product. For example, and improvement on fuel efficiency, less use of water, or lowering the amount of pesticides used to grow food.			
*Product redesign: The concept of the product stays exactly the same and certain aspects are tweaked, or re-designed. This could be that the product components are made from a different material, or they add certain new parts so that the product will be more energy efficient over longer periods of time. 	
*Function innovation: This means that a change is made within the product so that it still has the same result, but the way in which it comes to that result is changed.
*System innovation: This is a change in the infrastructure of companies or organizations, meaning they provide the same kind of service but have a changeover to some other way of providing these ways of service.

== Open innovation ==

Whereas classical marketing is characterized by a uni-directional, sender – receiver relationship, in present times, marketing has changed. [[Open innovation]] re-conceptualizes marketing into a bi-directional relationship, based on processes of reciprocal learning. Companies open up their Research and Development departments in order to let new stimuli of information and knowledge flow in, as well as to allow insights to flow out.&lt;ref name="BFM" /&gt;

== Combination of open innovation and sustainable innovation ==
In order to be able to stand the huge competition prevailing in such markets, Porter and van der Linde identified the general importance of green innovations for a company’s competitiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Porter|first=Michael E.|author2=Linde, C.|title=Grenn and Competitive: Ending the Stalemate|journal=Harvard Business Review|year=1995|volume=73|issue=5|pages=119–134}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2010, the Greendex survey confirmed Porter’s and van der Linde’s emphasis on green innovations by identifying an increased environmentally oriented consumption behavior and an articulated desire by consumers to see less talking and more action to tackle environmental problems, from businesses and governments. Greendex is a quantitative consumer study of 17,000 consumers in 17 countries, in companionship of National Geographic and GlobeScan. Probands are interviewed regarding their energy use and conservation, transportation choices, food sources, the relative use of green products versus traditional products, attitudes towards the environment and sustainability, and knowledge of environmental issues. This study aims at a quantitative measurement of consumer behavior and at promoting sustainable consumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greendex|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/greendex/|accessdate=01.07.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
With regard to a company’s marketing strategy on sustainable products and services, McDonagh elaborated four principles: "Ecological trust", "ecological access", "ecological disclosure", and "Ecological dialogue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McDonagh|first=Pierre|title=Towards a theory of Sustainable Communication in Risk Society: Relating issues of sustainability to marketing communications|journal=Journal of Marketing Management|year=1998|volume=14|pages=591–622|doi=10.1362/026725798784867699}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Open sustainability innovations in practice ==

With open innovations and sustainable mindsets only recently becoming more popular within big companies, open sustainability innovations are not yet that often observed.
Open Sustainability Innovation can be seen applied by companies in their Sustainability Marketing campaigns. In contrary to traditional marketing laws where point of sale, advertising and the product are the main drivers, Sustainability Marketing requires firms to "build and maintain sustainable relationships with customers, the social environment and the natural environment."&lt;ref name="BFM" /&gt;

It involves these four characteristics

* Customer cost
* Customer solution
* Communication
* Convenience

An example of a company following the trend to share knowledge regarding sustainability innovations is [[Facebook]]. The social networking service started the Open Compute Project&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Compute Project|url=http://opencompute.org/|accessdate=01.07.2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to share methods with the entire industry about their new energy-efficient data centre in [[Oregon]], and therefore provides public access to all specifications and mechanical drawings of the facility and servers. According to Facebook, the building is 38% more efficient to build and run than similar data centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Report to Congress on Server and Data Center Energy Efficiency, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ENERGY STAR Program|date=2 August 2007|url=http://www.energystar.gov/ia/partners/prod_development/downloads/EPA_Datacenter_Report_Congress_Final1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Personal Load Carrying Equipment''' ('''PLCE''') is one of several current tactical [[webbing#Military|webbing]] systems of the [[British Armed Forces]]. Dependant upon the year of design, and the [[decade]] of introduction, the webbing system was designated, and is commonly referred to, as either the ''85 Pattern'', the ''90 Pattern'' or the ''95 Pattern'' webbing.

The basic configuration consists of a belt, a shoulder harness and a number of individual pouches. Associated with the PLCE webbing system is a series of other similar load carrying equipment, individual items and rucksacks that are produced of the same materials and feature high interoperability.

==Purpose==
The purpose of the '''''PLCE''''' webbing system is to retain the means by which a British soldier may  operate for 48 hours or conduct a mission-specific task. Items and components may include a variety of munitions and weapon ancillaries, a three-fold [[entrenching tool]], a [[bayonet]], food and water (including a means to heat water and prepare food), [[CBRN|Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear ''(CBRN)'']] protective clothing and communications equipment. Soldiers will also often carry other personal items such as waterproof clothing and spare socks.

==History==
The '''''PLCE''''' webbing system had replaced the Type [[58 Pattern webbing|58 Pattern]] webbing, which was [[Olive (color)#Olive drab|Olive drab]] (OD/OG)  in colour and made of [[canvas]] material. This system, after having been introduced to the forces in 1960, and considered long outdated by 1980, was still being part of the standard issue equipment of the [[British Armed Forces]] during the [[Falklands War]] in 1982.

To overcome the common issues associated with canvas materials, such as shrinking and accelerated decomposition in damp climate conditions, arctic climate conditions, or constant exposure to wet terrain, military load bearing systems, outside of the range of use by the British Armed Forces, had been revised to incorporate or be produced of newer and tougher materials.

During the [[Vietnam War]], the [[United States Armed Forces]] had introduced and serviced the M-1967 [[Modernized Load-Carrying Equipment]] (MLCE) in 1968, and later the [[All-purpose Lightweight Individual Carrying Equipment ]] (ALICE)]] in 1974. Both systems had incorporated non-decomposing synthetic fabrics and were produced of highly durable [[nylon]] material.

Following this influential lead, and reconsidering the progression and renewal of military load bearing systems around the world, Britain developed the Type [[72 pattern webbing|72 Pattern webbing]], which mainly consisted of two ammunition pouches, to be worn on the front, and a field pack, to be worn on the back, produced of [[Polyurethane]]-coated nylon and [[Butyl rubber]]. This system was never generally issued, but was a Troop Trials Equipment.

The [[National People's Army]] (''Nationale Volksarmee'') of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]] designed and introduced the [[UTV webbing|''Uniformtrageversuch'' 85-90]] (UTV 85-90), resembling, with the exception of the clothing system, a modified duplicate of the British Type [[58 Pattern webbing]], inheriting very similar features in appearance and function. The shoulder harness was of identical design, the belt had featured the use of identical buckles, and Type 58 Pattern C-hooks had been incorporated in all components. Complementary items, such as pouches, had been changed in design and size, to meet [[Warsaw Pact]] requirements. The webbing system and components were produced of a more robust [[Nylon]] material, and featured the [[Strichtarn]] camouflage pattern. Whilst this late improvement was observed by the British Armed Forces, and being found to be an affront, especially against the [[British Army of the Rhine]] (BAOR), no further considerations have been made, as the testing of prototypic PLCE equipment was already underway.

==85 Pattern==
Developments resumed with the progression of the firearms development and introduction of the [[SA80]] family of British small arms. Trials of experimental '''''PLCE''''' webbing and [[Combat Body Armour]] (CBA)]] were conducted with selected units in 1984 and 1985. Being very similar to the first standard issue PLCE webbing system, it used snaps of proprietary design for closure on all pouches{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}.

==90 Pattern==
Seven years after the [[Falklands War|Falklands Conflict]], the first standard issue PLCE webbing was introduced in 1989, it was designated the Type ''90 Pattern'' webbing and was [[Olive (color)#Olive drab|Olive (OD/OG)]]  in colour.

The original components used Type [[58 Pattern webbing|58 Pattern]] C-hooks for the belt attachment, and angled D-rings for the shoulder harness attachment on the ammunition pouches. There were separate left and right pouches. The first utility pouches in production, had additional belt attachments for high mounting, similar to the ammunition pouches of the [[1937 Pattern Web Equipment]] or Type [[44 Pattern]] webbing. Later produced PLCE webbing of the Type 90 Pattern incorporates ambidextrous yoke fittings and the standard PLCE webbing belt attachments (see below).

The PLCE webbing system was also adopted by the [[Danish Defence|Danish Defence Forces]] (''Forsvaret'') in the [[M84 camouflage pattern|M84]] camouflage pattern and by the [[Defence Forces (Ireland)|Defence Forces of Ireland]] (''Óglaigh na hÉireann'') in Olive drab. The Permanent and Reserve Defence Forces now employ the [[Integrated Protection and Load Carrying System]] (IPLCS).

Many other countries still issue, or have issued similar load bearing systems. By way of example, in its year of introduction to the forces, the [[United States Armed Forces]] have adopted the [[Individual Integrated Fighting System]] (IIFS).

The newest variant of the PLCE webbing system, of the Type 90 Pattern, has been in production since 1992 and features the [[Disruptive Pattern Material]] (DPM) camouflage pattern as being an integral feature of the now partially obsolete [[Combat Soldier 95]] ("Soldier 95") clothing system. The official designation remained unchanged.

==95 Pattern==
With the introduction of the [[Combat Soldier 95]] (CS95 or "Soldier 95") clothing system in 1995, the common misconception arose that a complete revision of the Type 90 Pattern PLCE webbing system was taking place.

The clothing system underwent final development and entered troop trials in between the years 1992 and 1995. Garments were specifically manufactured for these trials, yet the PLCE webbing system issued, officially remained of the Type 90 Pattern.

Due to confusion, or for the sake of convenience, individual components of the webbing system, were now, as of 1995, unofficially designated, described, and specified as the '''Type 95 Pattern''' webbing, as having been widely understood to be part of the Combat Soldier 95 clothing system. No such official change of designation had taken place.

The only array of PLCE components that could be considered of the unofficial Type 95 Pattern, are those components produced during or after the year of 1995.

==Construction==
The PLCE webbing system is produced from double-layered 1000 [[Denier (unit)|Denier]] internally rubberised [[Cordura]] [[Nylon]], a long lasting and hard wearing fabric. [[Olive (color)#Olive drab|Olive]] webbing of the same material ("1000 D") is being incorporated, along with a variety of hard wearing plastic fasteners [[Illinois Tool Works#ITW companies|(ITW Nexus)]], [[Hook and loop fastener]]s ([[Velcro]]) and anti-magnetic press stud fasteners ("Pull the Dot").

The pouches are opened and closed with Spanish Tab fasteners, they can be closed in two different ways, quick release or secure. Small sections of [[Velcro]], sewn on the inside of the lids of the pouches, and the top front section of the pouches, allow for easy and effortless fastening. Added silencer strips allow to cover them when not needed.

A standard ammunition pouch as issued ("Pouch, Ammunition, Universal, DPM, IRR.") has two pockets; single pocket versions ("Pouch, Ammunition (Other Arms), DPM, IRR.") are available for those individuals not required to carry as much ammunition. Pouches designated to hold ammunition initially contained a dividing strip to hold two magazines in separate compartments and eliminate rattle. Some soldiers, especially infantry soldiers, often removed these dividing strips to make it easier to insert and remove magazines. They also found that three magazines would then fit comfortably and without excessive noise, giving a total capacity of twelve magazines per person in a standard fighting configuration. Later issue ammunition pouches were manufactured without dividers, as eight magazines was not thought to be sufficient for sustained firefights with the enemy. Without dividers, each pouch can now alternatively contain one grenade.

Infrared Reduction (or Resistant) (IRR) coating is applied to and incorporated in all fabric and webbing of the PLCE webbing system, which reduces its heat signature to that of natural foliage, when viewed through infrared [[night vision]] systems.

==Order of Dress==
The [[Infantry Trials and Development Unit]] (ITDU) based in [[Warminster#Military|Warminster]], conducted trials with the PLCE webbing system. It had decided for the system to be fit for purpose, and divided the system into three orders of dress:

* Assault Order.
The Assault Order consists of the very essentials needed to conduct a military task in the theatre of war. Ammunition, the water bottle, the entrenching tool, the bayonet, the helmet, and [[CBRN]] (Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear) protective clothing (stowed in one of the detachable side pouches of the rucksack) is to be carried on operations and patrols of only short duration.
* Combat Order.
The Combat Order is the Assault Order in addition to the means of stowage for rations and personal equipment, that enable the British soldier to live and fight for a period of 24 hours. The second side pouch of the rucksack is now carried. In practice, the patrol packs are used by many units and individual soldiers instead of the side pouches, as they are to be found larger in size and more convenient.
* Marching Order.
The Marching Order is the Combat Order in addition to the carrying of the rucksack (Bergen) and is the fighting load required for operations of up to the duration of two weeks, without means of resupply, except for ammunition, rations and water. The complete Bergen (with side pouches attached) is being carried.

==Configuration==
The initial basis of the '''''PLCE''''' webbing system is the belt; it features two D-rings at the back to attach to the shoulder harness, and many rows of narrow vertical slots sewn into the fabric. Two or more front pouches (ammunition or utility) attach to the belt; these have belt loops and feature T-Bar plastic tab attachments to provide more stability and security when connected to the belt. Every major component of the '''''PLCE''''' webbing system features two T-Bar plastic tab attachments.

The six-point shoulder harness attaches to the two D-rings on the belt and the two A-rings on each front pouch chosen. This benefits the distribution of weight and allows for a more comfortable carry, than provided with the use of a four-point shoulder harness. Pouches that are to be worn on the back (field pack, utility, water bottle, respirator, wire cutter, entrenching tool) attach to the belt using the same loop and tab system.

The detachable side pouches of a Bergen (''Pouch, Side, Rucksack, DPM, IRR.'') can be attached to the dedicated shoulder harness (''Yoke, Pouch Side, Rucksack, DPM, IRR.'') to construct a day-sack.

==Scaling==
In the year 1997, the [[Defence Clothing &amp; Textile Agency|Defence Clothing &amp; Textile Agency (''DCTA'')]] had decided, that Type ''90 Pattern (Infantry)'' equipment was to be scaled and issued in the following capacity.
 
*01. ''1x Carrier, Entrenching Tool.''
*02. ''2x Pouch Side, Rucksack.''
*03. ''1x Carrier, Water Canteen.''
*04. ''2x Pouch, Ammunition, Universal.''
*05. ''1x Pouch, Utility.''
*06. ''1x Haversack, Respirator.''
*07. ''1x Yoke, Main.''
*08. ''1x Yoke, Pouch Side, Rucksack.''
*09. ''2x Strap, Pouch Side, Yoke.''
*10. ''1x Belt, Waist (of appropriate size).''
*11. ''2x Strap, Utility, O/D, IRR.''
*12. ''1x Bayonet, Frog, DPM, IRR.''
*13. ''1x Rucksack (Infantry) (of appropriate size).''
*14. ''1x Bag, Insertion, Rucksack.''
*15. ''2x Bag, Insertion, Pouch, Side, Rucksack.''
*16. ''1x Bag, Transparent, PLCE, Rucksack.''
*17. ''2x Bag, Transparent, PLCE, Pouch, Side, Rucksack.''

The standard issue accoutrement today, dependent upon the branch of service, was changed to the capacity of two front pouches (''Pouch, Ammunition, Universal, DPM, IRR.'') instead of one. To this, privately purchased water bottle or utility pouches and hip pads are often added. The entrenching tool pouch (''Carrier, Entrenching Tool Case, DPM, IRR.'') is sometimes used as an alternative water bottle pouch.

Multi Terrain Pattern (MTP) PLCE is replacing all Disruptive Pattern Material (DPM) PLCE as the core issued webbing equipment for the British Armed Forces, this program started in 2015.

==Assault Vest==
A new standard issue piece of equipment (''Waistcoat, Mans, General Purpose Ops.'') that was designed for carrying essential items on a more secure platform than the original '''''PLCE''''' webbing system.

This consists of a typical [[waistcoat]] design, fastened with three [[Illinois Tool Works#ITW companies|ITW Nexus]] clips. Two triple ammunition pouches are situated on the left hand side of the coat, along with a utility pouch, small utility pouch and a zippered pocket with an internal holster. The right side is similar but with three large utility pouches, along with a small utility pouch and again a zippered pocket with notepad holder. All pouches open and close with [[Illinois Tool Works#ITW companies|ITW Nexus]] clips as well as having storm seals.

The vest is adjusted through four ladderlock fasteners and webbing, the shoulders are adjustable with [[Velcro]] material. The concept is to gain a secure load carrying system that fits over body armour comfortably. There are various types of this vest depending upon the year of manufacture. The originals are as described above but newer models have loops on the left side for the bayonet frog, clips for a large hydration pouch, name patches on the left side, and a small utility pouch. Most recently, the Spanish tab fasteners are being incorporated again, instead of the [[Illinois Tool Works#ITW companies|ITW Nexus]] clips.

The standard issue assault vest, depending on the operational requirements, is available in either the [[Disruptive Pattern Material#Later developments|Disruptive Pattern Material (''DPM'')]] camouflage pattern, or the [[Desert DPM (''DDPM'')]] camouflage pattern. Commercial variants are available in multiple colours, such as Black, Green, or the American [[Desert Camouflage Uniform|Desert Camouflage Uniform (''DCU'')]] camouflage pattern.

==Criticism==
The main criticism of the '''''PLCE''''' webbing system amongst members of the [[British Armed Forces]], is that the belt is prone to slipping. Some soldiers opt to change the plastic buckle for a [[Roll-Pin]] type, whereby the belt is threaded and tightened each time it is put on.

==Future==
Most other nations are developing, or have developed more modular load bearing systems, such as the [[MOLLE (military)|Modular Lightweight Load-carrying Equipment (''MOLLE'')]] which is being widely employed by most branches of the [[United States Armed Forces]]. Following this major improvement, the [[Pouch Attachment Ladder System|Pouch Attachment Ladder System (''PALS'')]] had been incorporated into the [[Osprey body armour|Osprey Body Armour (''OBA'')]] platform, which is currently being issued to British troops on operations world-wide.

Further international developments of influence and interest include the [[IdZ|Infanterist der Zukunft (''IdZ'')]] platform, the [[FÉLIN|Fantassin à Équipements et Liaisons Intégrés (''FÉLIN'')]] platform, the [[NORMANS|Norwegian Modular Arctic Network Soldier (''NORMANS'')]] platform, and the [[F-INSAS|Future Infantry Soldier As a System (''F-INSAS'')]] platform, which was planned to be fielded by the [[Indian Armed Forces]] in the year 2020. No such sophisticated plans of a British [[Future Soldier]] programme had been announced by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence (''MoD'')]].

In the year 2015, the Personal Protective Equipment and Load Carriage System (''VIRTUS'') platform, this is now on issue to high readiness units.

Due to the introduction and constant improvement of protective equipment, such as the [[Osprey body armour|Osprey Body Armour (''OBA'')]], the '''''PLCE''''' webbing system is incompatible so Osprey Mk 4 has a MOLLE belt and under armour Yoke to allow Osprey pouches to be used as belt equipment.

After the first introduction in 1989, PLCE in its current MTP form is still Britain's core issue webbing equipment which is compatible with ECBA armour and Mk 6 and 7 helmet, with Osprey issued to non-deployed infantry, leaving Virtus issued to deployed Infantry Commando and Parachute Units

A '''personal flotation device''' (abbreviated as '''PFD'''; also referred to as a '''life jacket''', '''life preserver''', '''life belt''', '''Mae West''', '''life vest''', '''life saver''', '''cork jacket''', '''buoyancy aid''' or  '''flotation suit''') is a piece of equipment designed to assist a wearer to keep afloat in water. The wearer may be either conscious or unconscious.

PFDs are available in different sizes to accommodate variations in [[Human body weight|body weight]]. Designs differ depending on wearing convenience and level of protection.

== History ==
[[Image:PSM V31 D669 Cork jacket and life buoy.jpg|thumb|A typical cork jacket from 1887]]

The most ancient examples of primitive life jackets can be traced back to inflated bladders or animal skins or hollow, sealed gourds,  for support when crossing deep streams and rivers. Purpose-designed buoyant safety devices consisting of simple blocks of wood or [[Cork (material)|cork]] were used by [[Norway|Norwegian]] seamen.

In 1804 a cork life jacket was available for sale. ''The Sporting Magazine'' October, 1804, Vol.XXV, No.147, Page 129. MALLISON's SEAMAN'S FRIEND.&lt;ref&gt;https://archive.org/stream/sportingmagazin51unkngoog/sportingmagazin51unkngoog_djvu.txt

&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal flotation devices were not part of the equipment issued to naval sailors until the early 19th century, for example at the Napoleonic Battle of Trafalgar, although seamen who were press-ganged into naval service might have used such devices to jump ship and swim to freedom.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

It was not until lifesaving services were formed that the personal safety of boat crews heading out in pulling boats in generally horrific sea conditions was addressed. The modern life jacket is generally credited to one Captain Ward, a [[Royal National Lifeboat Institution]] inspector in the [[United Kingdom]], who created a cork vest in 1854 to be worn by [[Lifeboat (rescue)|lifeboat]] crews for both weather protection and [[buoyancy]].

In 1900, French electrical engineer, [[Gustave Trouvé]], patented a battery-powered wearable lifejacket. It incorporated small, rubber-insulated maritime electric batteries not only to inflate the jacket, but also to power a light to transmit and receive [[SOS]] messages and to launch a distress flare.

The rigid cork material eventually came to be supplanted by pouches containing watertight cells filled with [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]], a vegetable material.  These soft cells were much more flexible and comfortable to wear compared with devices using hard cork pieces.  Kapok buoyancy was used in many navies fighting in [[World War II]].  Foam eventually supplanted kapok for 'inherently buoyant' (vs. inflated and therefore not inherently buoyant) flotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = DCIEM / D.C.I.E.M. / Defence and Civil Institute for Environmental Medicine: 50 - The First Fifty Years, 1939 to 1989 | publisher = Defence and Civil Institute of Environmental Medicine | year = 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Victoria]] pioneered research and development of the UVic Thermo Float PFD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.uvic.ca/torch/torch2003f/feature_survival_science.htm|title=Feature - Survival Science|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170516035442/http://web.uvic.ca/torch/torch2003f/feature_survival_science.htm|archivedate=16 May 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides superior protection from immersion hypothermia by incorporating a neoprene rubber "diaper" that seals the user's upper thigh and groin region from contact with otherwise cold, flushing and debilitating water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://learntokayak.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/sea-kayaker-deep-trouble-by-matt-broze-and-george-gronseth/|title=Sea Kayaker: Deep Trouble by Matt Broze and George Gronseth|date=5 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304213416/https://learntokayak.wordpress.com/2010/05/05/sea-kayaker-deep-trouble-by-matt-broze-and-george-gronseth/|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During World War II, research to improve the design of life jackets was also conducted in the UK by Edgar Pask [[OBE]], the first Professor of [[Anaesthesia]] at [[Newcastle University]]. His research involved self-administered anaesthesia as a means of simulating [[unconsciousness]] in freezing sea-water. Pask's work earned him the OBE and the description of "The bravest man in the RAF never to have flown an aeroplane".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.ncl.ac.uk/nsa/pask.html|title=The bravest man in the RAF never to fly an aeroplane|publisher=|accessdate=23 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022140945/http://research.ncl.ac.uk/nsa/pask.html|archivedate=22 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mae West ===
[[Image:Mae West life preserver.jpg|thumb|upright|A "Mae West" life preserver]]
The Mae West was a common nickname&lt;ref name="ingersoll1940"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ReportOnEngland#page/n165/mode/2up |title=Report on England, November 1940 |last=Ingersoll |first=Ralph |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=1940 |location=New York |pages=147, 158}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the first inflatable life preserver, which was invented in 1928 by Peter Markus (1885–1974) ([[United States patent law|US Patent]] 1694714), with his subsequent improvements in 1930 and 1931. The nickname originated because someone wearing the inflated life preserver often appeared to be as large-breasted as the actress [[Mae West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mae West Crashes Oxford Dictionary|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19430806&amp;id=37pSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EH0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4881,1303181&amp;hl=en|accessdate=29 June 2015|work=St. Petersburg Times|agency=INS|issue=Volume 60 Number 13|date=6 August 1943|page=15|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426090848/https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=888&amp;dat=19430806&amp;id=37pSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EH0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4881,1303181&amp;hl=en|archivedate=26 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was popular during the Second World War with [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] and [[Royal Air Force]] servicemen, who were issued inflatable Mae Wests as part of their flight gear. Air crew members whose lives were saved by use of the Mae West (and other personal flotation devices) were eligible for membership in the [[Goldfish Club]].

==Specifications==
Devices designed and approved by authorities for use by civilians (recreational boaters, sailors, [[canoe]]ists, [[kayak]]ers) differ from those designed for use by passengers and crew of aircraft (helicopters, airplanes) and of commercial vessels ([[tugboat]]s, passenger ferries, cargo ships).  Devices used by government and military (e.g. [[water police]], [[coast guard]], [[navy]], [[marines]]) generally have features not found on civilian or commercial models, for example compatibility with other items worn, like a survival vest, bulletproof vest/body armor, equipment harness, rappelling harness, or parachute harness, and the use of ballistic nylon cloth to protect pressurized {{CO2|link=yes}} canisters used for inflating the vest from injuring the wearer if struck by a round from a firearm.  The ballistic cloth keeps the fragments from the canister from becoming shrapnel injurious to the user.

==Design and regulation==
[[File:LifevestlocationSeatbeltreminder.jpg|thumb|On many aircraft life vests are underneath the seats, as indicated by this sign]]
Life jackets or life vests are mandatory on airplanes flying over water bodies, in which case they consist of a pair of air cells (bladders) that can be inflated by triggering the release of carbon dioxide gas from a canister—one for each cell.  Or the cells can be inflated "orally" that is by blowing into a flexible tube with a one-way valve to seal the air in the cell. Life jackets must also be supplied on commercial seafaring vessels, be accessible to all crew and passengers, and be donned in an emergency.

Flotation devices are also found in near water-edges and at swimming pools. They may take the form of a simple [[vest]], a [[jacket]], a full-body suit (one piece coverall), or their variations suited for particular purposes. They are most commonly made of a tough [[synthetic fiber]] material encapsulating a source of buoyancy, such as [[foam]] or a chamber of air, and are often brightly colored yellow or orange to maximize visibility for rescuers.  Some devices consist of a combination of both buoyancy foam and an air chamber.  Retroreflective "SOLAS" tape is often sewn to the fabric used to construct life jackets and PFDs to facilitate a person being spotted in darkness when a search light is shone towards the wearer.
In the US, federal regulations require all persons under the age of 13 to wear a life jacket (PFD) when in a watercraft under 12 meters long. State regulations may raise or lower this number and must be followed when in that state's jurisdiction.

== Types ==

=== Buoyancy aid (foam core) ===
{{Main|Buoyancy aid}}
[[Image:Lifejacket2.PNG|thumb|A buoyancy aid (with a foam core)]]
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Childs life vest.jpg|thumb|A child's life vest]] --&gt;

The simplest and least buoyant type of PFD comes in the form of [[nylon]]-lined [[foam]] vests, used predominantly in water sports such as [[kayak]]ing, [[canoe]]ing and [[dinghy sailing]].

Buoyancy aids are designed to allow freedom of movement while providing a user with the necessary buoyancy. They are also designed for minimal maintenance and as they are only constructed from [[foam]] and can be mass-produced inexpensively, making them one of the most common forms of PFDs.

Some buoyancy aids also come designed especially for children and youth. These vests may include one or two understraps to be worn between the legs of the wearer and also a headrest flap. The understraps are designed to keep the vest from riding up when worn in the water and restrict the wearer from slipping out of the life vest. These straps are adjustable and are included on many different life vests designed to be worn by everyone from infants to adults.
The headrest flap is designed to help support the head and keep it out of the water. A grab handle is attached to the headrest to be used if needed to rescue or lift someone out of the water.

Buoyancy aids are rated by the amount of buoyancy they provide in Newtons - the minimum rating to be considered suitable as an adult life-jacket for offshore use is {{convert|150|N|lbf|lk=on}}.

=== Life jacket ===
[[Image:Life vest.jpg|thumb|A man wearing a life vest, with another life vest hanging on a hook at lower left]]
[[File:Alaska 2007 075.jpg|thumb|The person on the right is wearing an air chamber life jacket]]
Life jackets for outfitting large commercial transport ventures in potentially dangerous waters, such as coastal cruises, offshore passages, and overwater air flights, consisting of either a single air chamber or a pair of (twin or double) sealed air chambers constructed of coated nylon (sometimes with a protective outer encasing of heavier, tougher material such as [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]]), joined together. For use aboard ships they may be constructed of foam.  Twin air chambers provide for redundancy in the event of one of the air chambers leaking or failing to "fire", for example if the thin air cell fabric is sliced open by sharp metal fragments during emergency evacuation and egress. Most life jackets for leisure use are of the single air chamber type.

Aircraft devices for crew and passengers are always inflatable since it may be necessary to swim down and away from a ditched or submerged aircraft and inflated or foam filled devices would significantly impede a person from swimming downward in order to escape a vehicle cabin.  Upon surfacing, the person then inflates the device, orally or by triggering the gas canister release mechanism. Most commercial passenger life jackets are fitted with a  plastic whistle for attracting attention. It has a light which is activated when in contact with water.

Quality life jackets always provide more buoyancy than offered by the buoyancy aids alone.&lt;ref&gt;Ten [[newton (unit)|newtons]] equals 1&amp;nbsp;kg of flotation&lt;/ref&gt; The positioning of the buoyancy on the wearer's torso is such that a righting moment (rotational force) results that will eventually turn most persons who are floating face down in the water (for example, because they are unconscious) into a face up orientation with their bodies inclined backward, unlike more simply designed common foam buoyancy vests.

Today these air chamber vests are commonly referred to as 'inflatable life jackets or vests' and are available not only for commercial applications but also for those engaged in recreational boating, fishing, sailing, kayaking and canoeing. They are available in a variety of styles and are generally more comfortable and less bulky than traditional foam vests.

The air chambers are always located over the breast, across the shoulders and encircle the back of the head. They may be inflated by either self-contained [[carbon dioxide]] cartridges activated by [[pullcord|pulling a cord]], or blow tubes with a [[one-way valve]] for inflation by [[exhalation]]. Some inflatable life jackets also react with salt or fresh water, which causes them to self-inflate. The latest generation of self-triggering inflation devices responds to water pressure when submerged and incorporates an actuator known as a 'hydrostatic release'.  All automatic life-jackets can be fired manually if required. Regardless of whether manually or automatically triggered, a pin punctures the cartridge/canister and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas escapes into the sealed air chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishrowing.org/sites/default/files/rowsafe/2-1-SafetyAids-v1.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-04-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180430213106/https://www.britishrowing.org/sites/default/files/rowsafe/2-1-SafetyAids-v1.pdf |archivedate=2018-04-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is a chance that these water pressure activated inflation devices do not inflate the life jacket if a person is wearing waterproof clothing and falls into the water face-down. In these cases the buoyancy of the clothing holds a person on the water surface, which prevents the hydrostatic release. As a result, a person can drown although wearing a fully functional life jacket. In addition there are some circumstances in which the use of self-triggering devices can result in the wearer becoming trapped underwater. For example, the [[coxswain]] of a [[bowloader]] rowing shell risks being unable to escape should the craft capsize.

To be on the safe side, a pill-activated inflation device is preferred.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} A small pill that dissolves on water contact is the safest option, as it also works in shallow waters where a hydrostatic activator fails. This type of jacket is called an 'automatic'. As it is more sensitive to the presence of water, early models could also be activated by very heavy rain or spray. For this reason, spare re-arming kits should be carried on board for each life jacket. However, with modern cup/bobbin mechanisms this problem rarely arises and mechanisms such as the Halkey Roberts Pro firing system have all but eliminated accidental firing.

Drifting in open seas and international waters, as encountered on long sea voyages and by [[military]] forces, requires prolonged survival in water. Suitable life jackets are often attached to a vest with pockets and attachment points for distress signaling and survival aids, for example, a handheld two-way radio ([[walkie-talkie]]), emergency beacon (406&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency), signal mirror, sea marker dye, smoke or light signal flares, strobe light, first-aid supplies, concentrated nutritional items, water purification supplies, shark repellent, knife, and pistol.

Accessories such as leg straps can be utilized to keep the inflated chambers in position for floating in a stable attitude, and splash or face shields constructed of clear see-through vinyl covers the head and face to prevent water from waves from inundating the face and entering the airway through the nose or mouth.

=== Survival suit ===
[[File:Survival suit mg 6520.jpg|thumb|150px|right|An example of a survival suit on a dummy]]
{{main|Survival suit}}

Some formats of PFDs are designed for long term immersion in cold water in that they provide insulation as well as buoyancy.  While a [[wetsuit]] of neoprene rubber or a diver's [[drysuit]] provides a degree of flotation, in most maritime countries they are not formally considered by regulatory agencies as approved lifesaving devices or as PFDs.

It is possible for an incapacitated person in the water to float face-down while wearing only a wet suit or a dry suit since they are not designed to serve as lifesaving devices in the normal understanding of that term.

The Mark 10 [[Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment]] (SEIE) suit is intended to allow [[Escape trunk|submariners to escape]] from much deeper depths than currently possible with the [[Steinke hood]]. Some [[United States Navy]] submarines already have the system, with an ambitious installation and training schedule in place for the remainder of the fleet.

Because it is a full-body suit, the Mark 10 provides thermal protection once the wearer reaches the surface, and the Royal Navy has successfully tested it at {{convert|180|m|ft|-2}} depths.

=== Buoyancy compensator ===
{{main|Buoyancy compensator (diving)}}

Scuba divers commonly wear a buoyancy compensator, which has an inflatable gas chamber.  The amount of gas can be increased or decreased to enable the diver to ascend, descend or maintain neutral buoyancy at a given water depth and to provide positive buoyancy in an emergency to bring him to the surface or keep him at the surface.

=== Specialized ===
Specialized life jackets include shorter-profile vests commonly used for [[kayaking]] (especially [[playboating]]), and high-buoyant types for [[Whitewater rafting|river outfitters]] and other whitewater professionals.  PFDs which include harnesses for tethered rescue work ('live-bait rescue') and pockets or daisy-chains (a series of loops created by sewing flat nylon webbing at regular intervals for the attachment of rescue gear) are made for [[Swiftwater rescue|swiftwater rescue technicians]].

=== PFDs for pets ===
[[File:French bulldog in life jacket.jpg|thumb|[[French Bulldog|French bulldog]] wearing a life jacket]]
Personal flotation devices have been developed for dogs and other pets.

While the [[USCG]] does not certify personal flotation devices for animals, many manufacturers produce life jackets for dogs and cats. Dogs and cats have been known to die from drowning, either because they do not know how to swim, or because they tire out from overexposure or old age, or have a medical complication such as a seizure, or become unconscious.

Most life jackets on the market are designed with foam that wraps around the animal's torso and neck.  They provide a basic amount of buoyancy for a dog, but may not provide enough support for the head.  They are not ideal for use with heavy dogs.  However, they often incorporate a grab handle, which may help to hoist the dog back into the boat.

Although most pet life jackets are passive devices, there is at least one automatically inflated life jacket available for pets (made by Critter’s Inflatable, LLC).  An automatic flotation device is generally more expensive than a foam life jacket, but, like automatic PFDs designed for humans, they are less bulky to wear when not inflated, and when inflated may provide more buoyancy than foam devices.  Automatic pet flotation devices are popular in the bulldog community, and also for water therapy where extra support may be needed under the head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doggie Life Jackets and Flotation Devices|url=http://www.boatus.org/findings/51/|publisher=Boat US Foundation|accessdate=6 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407084049/http://www.boatus.org/findings/51/|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horsfall|first=Cindy|title=Canine Flotation Devices|url=http://www.iaamb.org/acwt/how-to/canine-flotation-devices.html|publisher=International Association of Animal Massage &amp; Bodywork / Association of Canine Water Therapy|accessdate=6 April 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407071317/http://www.iaamb.org/acwt/how-to/canine-flotation-devices.html|archivedate=7 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plant floor communications''' refers to the control and data communications typically found in automation environments, on a manufacturing plant floor or process plant.  The difference between manufacturing and process is typically the types of control involved, [[Discrete manufacturing|discrete control]] or continuous control (aka [[process control]]).  Many plants offer a hybrid of both discrete and continuous control.  The underlying commonality between them all is that the automation systems are often an integration of multi-vendor products to form one system.  Each vendor product typically offers communication capability for programming, maintaining and collecting data from their products.  A properly orchestrated plant floor environment will likely include a variety of [[Automation protocols|communications]], some for machine to machine (M2M) communications – to facilitate efficient primary control over the process and some for Machine to Enterprise (M2E) communications – to facilitate connectivity with Business Systems that provide overall reporting, scheduling and inventory management functions.

==Machine to machine (M2M) communications==
Automation controllers typically offer communication modules to enable them to support a variety of [[Automation protocols|industrial protocols]], to facilitate [[machine to machine]] communications.  These modules are often special designed for the protocol.  A new class of module, the [[universal gateway]], is becoming more prevalent as it offers the ability for an automation controller to communicate over one or more protocols simultaneously, and can be reconfigured for additional protocols without a module change.

==Machine to enterprise (M2E) communications==
Few automation controllers offer direct connectivity to business systems such as MES and ERP systems.  Overall integration of automation controllers to business systems are typically configured by [[systems integrator|system integrators]], able to bring their unique knowledge on process, equipment and vendor solutions.

==Integration==
Integration is typically managed through one of three mechanisms:

'''Direct Integration''' – Business systems include connectivity (communications to plant floor equipment) as part of their product offering.  This requires the business system developers to offer specific support for the variety of plant floor equipment that they want to interface with.  Business system vendors must be expert in their own products, and connectivity to other vendor products, often those offered by competitors.

'''[[Relational database|Relational Database]] (RDB) Integration''' – Business systems connect to plant floor data sources through a Relational Database Staging Table.  Plant floor systems will deposit the necessary information into a Relational Data Base.  The business system will remove and use the information from the RDB Table.  The benefit of RDB Staging is that business system vendors do not need to get involved in the complexities of plant floor equipment integration.  Connectivity becomes the responsibility of the [[Systems integrator|system integrator]].

'''EATM ([[Eatm|Enterprise Transaction Modules]])''' – These devices have the ability to communicate directly with plant floor equipment and will transact data with the business system in methods best supported by the business system.  Again, this can be through a staging table, Web Services, or through system specific business system [[Api|APIs]].  The benefit of an EATM is that it offers a complete, off the shelf solution, minimizing long term costs and customization.

'''Custom Integrated Solutions''' – Many system integrators designs offer custom crafted solutions, created on a per instance basis to meet site and system requirements.  There are a wide variety of [[List of automation protocols|communications drivers]] available for plant floor equipment and there are separate products that have the ability to log data to relational database tables.  Standards exist within the industry to support interoperability between software products, the most widely known being OPC, managed by the [[OPC Foundation]].  Custom Integrated Solutions typically run on workstation or server class computers.  These systems tend to have the highest level of initial integration cost, and can have a higher long term cost in terms on maintenance and reliability.  Long term costs can be minimized through careful system testing and thorough documentation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3709">'''Porting Authorization Code''' ('''PAC''') is a [[unique identifier]] (normally 9 characters long and in the format "ABC123456") used by some [[mobile network operators]] to facilitate [[mobile number portability]] (MNP). This allows users to retain their mobile telephone number when switching operators.

==United Kingdom==
Telecommunications service is regulated in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] by [[Ofcom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.btplc.com/Thegroup/RegulatoryandPublicaffairs/RegulationsintheUK/index.htm|title=Regulation in the UK|website=www.btplc.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July 2003, Ofcom introduced the ''General Conditions of Entitlement'' which apply to all communications networks and service providers in the UK. Several amendments to this original document have been issued since this time

Condition 18 requires all providers to provide number portability but only to subscribers of [[Publicly Available Telephone Services|publicly available telephone services]] who request it. Number portability must be provided as soon as practicable and on reasonable terms to subscribers and bilateral porting arrangements between providers must accord with agreed processes.

#A current Service Provider must give a customer a Porting Authorisation Code (PAC) or a reason why it cannot be issued within 2 working hours of their request (if for less than 26 numbers) or 10 working days (if 26+ numbers)
#A PAC is valid for a period of 30 calendar days from the day of PAC issue and the customer's request must be submitted to their new Service Provider within that time.
#A number can then be transferred anytime between 1 and 32 calendar days from the date the PAC is issued.

Some mobile phone companies can charge a fee to move the customer's number. This is usually no more than £25.  The provider must issue a PAC within 2 hours of the port-out request, if such request was made over the phone for fewer than 25 numbers on a single account. Customer debt is not a valid reason for a service provider to refuse issuing of a PAC. Service providers may not treat PAC requests as requests to terminate service. Pay-as-you-go customers will lose any unused credit when switching service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.portnumber.co.uk/help#transfer-payg-credit|title=Port Number UK|website=www.portnumber.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1st July 2019, customers will be able to request a PAC by text message, rather than having to call their existing network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uswitch.com/mobiles/news/2017/12/uswitch-welcomes-ofcom-mobile-switching-plans/|title=Ofcom changes rules to allow switching network with single SMS|website=www.uswitch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==

In India, the code is known as a 'Unique Porting Code (UPC)'. The rules for number portability are prescribed by the [[TRAI|Telecom Regulatory Authority of India]].

*You are allowed to move to another mobile service provider only after 90 days of the date of activation of your mobile connection or from the date of last porting of your mobile number, whichever is applicable.
*You are allowed to change mobile service provider across the country.
*If you are a pre-paid subscriber, note that the balance amount of talk time, if any, at the time of porting will lapse.
*If you are a post-paid subscriber, ensure that you have paid all the dues as per your last bill. (You will also have to sign an undertaking on the porting form.)

A '''programmer''' (hardware), '''device programmer''', '''chip programmer''', '''[[Programmable read-only memory#Programming|device burner]]''',&lt;ref name="Muller 2003"/&gt;{{rp|364}} or '''PROM writer'''&lt;ref name="Cressler 2017"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; is a piece of electronic equipment that arrange written [[software]] to configure programmable [[Non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Integrated circuit|integrated circuits]], called programmable devices.&lt;ref name="Czerwinski 2013"&gt;
{{cite book|last1=Czerwinski|first1=Robert|last2=Kania|first2=Dariusz|title=Finite State Machine Logic Synthesis for Complex Programmable Logic Devices|date=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9783642361661|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVBEAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=programmable+devices|language=en}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}} The target devices include; [[Programmable read-only memory|PROM]], [[EPROM]], [[EEPROM]], [[Flash memory]], [[MultiMediaCard#eMMC|eMMC]], [[Magnetoresistive random-access memory|MRAM]], [[Ferroelectric RAM|FeRAM]], [[Non-volatile random-access memory|NVRAM]], [[Programmable logic device|PLD]], [[Programmable logic array|PLA]], [[Programmable Array Logic|PAL]], [[Generic array logic|GAL]], [[Complex programmable logic device|CPLD]], [[Field Programmable Gate Array|FPGA]], and [[microcontroller|MCU]].

Programmer hardware has two variants. One is configuring the target device itself with a socket on the programmer. Another is configuring the device on a [[printed circuit board]].

In the former case, the target device is inserted into a socket (usually [[Zero insertion force|ZIF]]) on top of the programmer.&lt;ref name="Mazidi 2017"/&gt;{{rp|642, pdf15}} If the device is not a standard [[Dual in-line package|''DIP packaging'']], a plug-in adapter board, which converts the [[Footprint (electronics)|footprint]] with another socket, is used.&lt;ref name="Edward 2006"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|58}}

In the latter case, device programmer is directly connected to the printed circuit board by a connector, usually with a cable. This way is called ''on-board programming'', ''in-circuit programming'', or ''[[in-system programming]]''.&lt;ref name="IEEE-2532"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards the data is transferred from the programmer into the device by applying signals through the connecting pins. Some devices have a serial interface&lt;ref name="Ong 2001"&gt;

for receiving the programming data (including [[JTAG]] interface).&lt;ref name="Mazidi 2017"/&gt;{{rp|642, pdf15}}
Other devices require the data on parallel pins, followed by a programming pulse with a higher voltage for programming the data into the device.&lt;ref name="Ravichandran 2001"&gt;

In the early days of [[computing]], [[booting]] mechanism was a mechanical devices usually consisted of switches and [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]]. It means the ''programmer'' was not an equipment but a human, who entered [[machine code]]s one by one, by setting the switches in a series of "on" and "off" positions.

A formula may be derived mathematically for the rate of [[electron scattering|scattering]] when a beam of electrons passes through a material.


==The interaction picture==
Define the unperturbed Hamiltonian by &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;, the time dependent perturbing Hamiltonian by &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt; and total Hamiltonian by &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

The eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian are assumed to be
:&lt;math&gt; H=H_0+H_1\ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; H_0 |k\rang = E(k)|k\rang  &lt;/math&gt;

In the [[interaction picture]], the state ket is defined by
:&lt;math&gt; |k(t)\rang _I= e^{iH_0 t /\hbar} |k(t)\rang_S= \sum_{k'} c_{k'}(t) |k'\rang  &lt;/math&gt;

By a [[Schrödinger equation]], we see 
:&lt;math&gt; i\hbar \frac{\partial}{\partial t} |k(t)\rang_I=H_{1I}|k(t)\rang_I &lt;/math&gt;
which is a Schrödinger-like equation with the total &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; replaced by &lt;math&gt;H_{1I}&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving the [[differential equation]], we can find the coefficient of n-state.
:&lt;math&gt; c_{k'}(t) =\delta_{k,k'} - \frac{i}{\hbar}  \int_0^t dt' \;\lang k'|H_1(t')|k\rang \, e^{-i(E_k - E_{k'})t'/\hbar} &lt;/math&gt;

where, the zeroth-order term and first-order term are
:&lt;math&gt;c_{k'}^{(0)}=\delta_{k,k'}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c_{k'}^{(1)}=- \frac{i}{\hbar}  \int_0^t dt' \;\lang k'|H_1(t')|k\rang \, e^{-i(E_k - E_{k'})t'/\hbar} &lt;/math&gt;

==The transition rate==
The probability of finding &lt;math&gt;|k'\rang&lt;/math&gt; is found by evaluating &lt;math&gt;|c_{k'}(t)|^2&lt;/math&gt;.

In case of constant perturbation,&lt;math&gt;c_{k'}^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; is calculated by 
:&lt;math&gt;c_{k'}^{(1)}=\frac{\lang\ k'|H_1|k\rang }{E_{k'}-E_k}(1-e^{i(E_{k'} - E_k)t/\hbar})&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|c_{k'}(t)|^2= |\lang\ k'|H_1|k\rang |^2\frac {sin ^2(\frac {E_{k'}-E_k} {2 \hbar}t)}  { ( \frac {E_{k'}
-E_k} {2 \hbar} ) ^2 }\frac {1}{\hbar^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the equation which is
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\alpha \rightarrow \infty} \frac{1}{\pi} \frac{sin^2(\alpha x)}{\alpha x^2}= \delta(x)&lt;/math&gt;

The transition rate of an electron from the initial state &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; to final state &lt;math&gt;k'&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;P(k,k')=\frac {2 \pi} {\hbar} |\lang\ k'|H_1|k\rang |^2 \delta(E_{k'}-E_k) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{k'}&lt;/math&gt; are the energies of the initial and final states including the perturbation state and ensures the &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-function indicate energy conservation.

==The scattering rate==
The scattering rate w(k) is determined by summing all the possible finite states k' of [[electron scattering]] from an initial state k to a final state k', and is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;w(k)=\sum_{k'}P(k,k')=\frac {2 \pi} {\hbar} \sum_{k'} |\lang\ k'|H_1|k\rang |^2 \delta(E_{k'}-E_k)&lt;/math&gt;

The integral form is 
:&lt;math&gt;w(k)=\frac {2 \pi} {\hbar} \frac {L^3} {(2 \pi)^3} \int d^3k' |\lang\ k'|H_1|k\rang |^2 \delta(E_{k'}-E_k)&lt;/math&gt;

SAASM allows satellite authentication, over-the-air rekeying, and contingency recovery.  Those features are not available with the similar, but older, PPS-SM (Precise Positioning Service Security Module) system. PPS-SM systems require periodic updates with a classified "[[Red/black concept|Red Key]]" that may only be transmitted by secure means (such as physically taking the receiver to a secure facility for rekeying or having a trusted courier deliver a paper tape with a new key to the receiver, after which that paper tape must be securely destroyed). SAASM systems can be updated with an encrypted "[[Red/black concept|Black Key]]" that may be transmitted over unclassified channels. All military receivers newly deployed after the end of September 2006 must use SAASM.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

SAASM does not provide any additional anti-jam capability, however the higher data (chipping) rate of [[GPS signals#Precision code|P(Y) code]] can provide a higher processing gain which will provide better tracking performance in a jamming environment.  Future GPS upgrades, such as [[GPS signals#Military (M-code)|M-Code]], will provide additional improvements to anti-jam capabilities.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

SAASM hardware is covered with an anti-tampering coating, to deter analysis of their internal operation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Deployment of the next generation military signal for GPS, called [[GPS modernization#Military .28M-code.29|M-code]], commenced with the launch of IIR-M and IIF satellites, beginning in 2005. A complete constellation of 18 satellites with M-code capability is planned for 2016.

'''Skeleton programming''' is a style of [[computer programming]] based on simple high-level program structures and so called '''dummy code'''. Program skeletons resemble [[pseudocode]], but allow [[parsing]], [[compiler|compilation]] and testing of the code.  Dummy code is inserted in a program skeleton to simulate processing and avoid [[compiler|compilation]] error messages. It may involve empty [[subroutine|function]] declarations, or functions that return a correct result only for a simple test case where the expected response of the code is known.

Skeleton programming facilitates a [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] design approach, where a partially functional system with complete high-level structures is designed and coded, and this system is then progressively expanded to fulfill the requirements of the project.  Program skeletons are also sometimes used for high-level descriptions of [[algorithm]]s.  A program skeleton may also be utilized as a template that reflects syntax and structures commonly used in a wide class of problems.

Skeleton programs are utilized in the [[template method design pattern]] used in [[object-oriented programming]]. In [[object-oriented programming]], dummy code corresponds to an [[abstract method]], a [[method stub]] or a [[mock object]]. In the [[Java remote method invocation]] (Java RMI) nomenclature, a [[Stub (computer science)|stub]] communicates on the client-side with a skeleton on the server-side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

A '''class skeleton''' is an outline of a [[class (computer science)|class]] that is used in [[software engineering]]. It contains a description of the class's roles, and describes the purposes of the [[Variable (programming)|variables]] and [[method (computer science)|method]]s, but does not implement them. The class is later [[implementation|implemented]] from the skeleton.

'''''The Truth About Chernobyl''''' is a 1991 book by Grigori Medvedev.  Medvedev served as deputy chief engineer at the No. 1 reactor unit of the [[Chernobyl]] Nuclear Power Plant in the 1970s.  At the time of the [[Chernobyl disaster]] in 1986, Medvedev was deputy director of the main industrial department in the Soviet Ministry of Energy dealing with the construction of nuclear power stations.  Since Medvedev knew the Chernobyl plant well, he was sent back as a special investigator immediately after the 1986 catastrophe.

In his book, Medvedev provides extensive first-hand testimony, based on many interviews, describing minute by minute precisely what was and was not done both before and after the explosion.  It has been described{{who|date=January 2014}} as a tragic tale of pervasive, institutionalized, bureaucratic incompetence leading up to the accident; and heroic, heartbreaking sacrifice among those who had to deal with the emergency afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19910901fabook6845/grigori-medvedev/the-truth-about-chernobyl.html  The Truth About Chernobyl. Grigori Medvedev. New York: [[Basic Books]], 1991]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is the single prime source for much of the actions of the operators, managers, firemen and others who are the actors in the Chernobyl disaster. It is, for example, the prime source for the article [[Individual involvement in the Chernobyl disaster]]. The book is written not in a documentary style but in a very personal style, often speaking in the first person.  While it includes extensive direct quotes from some of those who survived the disaster, it does not include references beyond a bare seven footnotes.

In 1991 it was awarded the [[Los Angeles Times Book Prize]], Science and technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1722">In [[thermodynamics]], a '''thermodynamicist''' is someone who studies [[thermodynamic process]]es and phenomena, i.e. the [[physics]] that deal with [[Mechanics|mechanical]] action and relations of [[heat]].

Among the well-known number of [[:Category:thermodynamicists|famous thermodynamicists]], include [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]], [[Rudolf Clausius]], [[Willard Gibbs]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], and [[Max Planck]].

==History of term==
Although most consider the French physicist [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Nicolas Sadi Carnot]] to be the first true thermodynamicist, the term ''thermodynamics'' itself wasn’t coined until 1849 by [[Lord Kelvin]] in his publication ''An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat''.&lt;ref&gt;Kelvin, William T. (1849). "An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat - with Numerical Results Deduced from Regnault's Experiments on Steam." ''Transactions of the Edinburg Royal Society, XVI. January 2.'' [http://visualiseur.bnf.fr/Visualiseur?Destination=Gallica&amp;O=NUMM-95118 Scanned Copy]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first thermodynamic textbook was written in 1859 by [[William John Macquorn Rankine|William Rankine]], a civil and mechanical engineering professor at the [[University of Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cengel, Yunus A.|author2=Boles, Michael A. | title=Thermodynamics - An Engineering Approach | publisher=McGraw-Hill | year=2005 | isbn=0-07-310768-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''weather vane''', '''wind vane''', or '''weathercock''' is an instrument for showing the [[Wind direction|direction of the wind]]. It is typically used as an architectural ornament to the highest point of a building. The word ''vane'' comes from the Old English word ''fana'' meaning "flag". 

Although partly functional, weather vanes are generally decorative, often featuring the traditional [[chicken|cockerel]] design with letters indicating the points of the compass. Other common motifs include ships, arrows and horses. Not all weather vanes have pointers. When the wind is sufficiently strong, the head of the arrow or cockerel (or equivalent depending on the chosen design) will indicate the direction from which the wind is blowing.

The weather vane was independently invented in ancient China and Greece around the same time during the 2nd century BCE. The earliest written reference to a weather vane appears in the ''[[Huainanzi]]'', and a weather vane was fitted on top of the [[Tower of the Winds]] in Athens.&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;

==History==
The oldest textual reference to a weather vane comes from the Chinese ''[[Huainanzi]]'' dating from around 139 BCE, which describes a "wind-observing fan" (''hou feng shan'', {{lang|zh-Hant-TW|侯風扇}}).&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt;  The [[Tower of the Winds]] on the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] ''[[agora]]'' in [[Athens]] once bore on its roof a wind vane in the form of a bronze [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]] holding a rod in his outstretched hand, rotating as the wind changed direction. Below this was a [[frieze]] adorned with the eight Greek wind deities. The eight-metre-high structure also featured [[sundial]]s, and a [[water clock]] inside. It dates from around 50 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Noble |first1=Joseph V. |last2=Price  |first2=Derek J. de Solla |authorlink2=Derek J. de Solla Price |date=October 1968 |title=The Water Clock in the Tower of the Winds |journal=American Journal of Archaeology |publisher= |volume=72 |issue=4 |pages=345–355 (353) |doi=10.2307/503828 |jstor=503828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military documents from the [[Three Kingdoms]] period of China (220–280) refer to the weather vane as "five ounces" (''wu liang'', {{lang|zh-Hant-TW|五兩}}), named after the weight of its materials.&lt;ref name="Needham"&gt;{{Citation |last=Needham |first=Joseph|last2=Ling|first2=Wang|volume=Vol. 3|title=Science and Civilisation in China: Mathematics and the Sciences of the Heavens and the Earth|publisher=Cambridge University Press|p=478|year=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 3rd century, Chinese weather vanes were shaped like birds and took the name of "wind-indicating bird" (''xiang feng wu'', {{lang|zh-Hant-TW|相風烏}}). The ''Sanfu huangtu'' ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|三輔黃圖}}), a 3rd century book written by Miao Changyan about the palaces at [[Chang'an]], describes a bird-shaped wind vane situated on a tower roof, which was possibly also an [[anemometer]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Han 'Ling Tai' (Observatory Platform)  was  eight  ''[[Li (unit)|li]]''  north-west of Chang'an.  It was called 'Ling  Tai' because  it was originally intended for observations of the [[Yin and Yang|Yin and the Yang]] and the changes occurring in the celestial bodies, but in the Han it began to be called Qing Tai. Guo Yuansheng, in his  ''Shu Zheng Ji'' (Records of Military Expeditions), says  that south of the palaces there was a Ling Tai, fifteen ''ren'' (120 feet) high,
upon the top of which  was  the [[armillary sphere]] made by [[Zhang Heng]]. Also there was a wind-indicating bronze bird  (''xiang feng tong wu''),  which  was  moved by the wind; and it was said that the bird moved when a 1000-''li'' wind was
blowing. There was also a bronze gnomon 8 feet high, with a 13 feet long and 1 foot 2 inches broad. According to an  inscription, this was set up in the 4th year of the Taichu reign-period (101 BCE).&lt;ref name="Needham"/&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The oldest surviving weather vane with the shape of a rooster is the ''Gallo di Ramperto'', made in 820 CE and now preserved in the [[Museo di Santa Giulia]] in [[Brescia]], [[Lombardy]].&lt;ref&gt;Rossana Prestini, ''Vicende faustiniane'', in AA.VV.,''La chiesa e il monastero benedettino di San Faustino Maggiore in Brescia'', Gruppo Banca Lombarda, La Scuola, Brescia 1999, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fedele Savio, ''Gli antichi vescovi d'Italia. La Lombardia'', Bergamo 1929, p. 188&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Leo IV]] had a cock placed on the [[Old St. Peter's Basilica]] or old [[Constantine I|Constantinian]] basilica.&lt;ref&gt;ST PETER'S BASILICA.ORG - Providing information on St. Peter's Basilica
and Square in the Vatican City - The Treasury Museum [http://saintpetersbasilica.org/Interior/Sacristy-Treasury/Items/Museum-8.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Gregory I]] said that the cock ([[rooster]]) "was the most suitable emblem of Christianity", being "the emblem of St Peter", a reference to [[wikisource:Bible (American Standard)/Luke#22:34|Luke 22:34]] in which [[Jesus]] predicts that Peter will deny him three times before the rooster crows.&lt;ref name=Forlong&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Forlong+%22emblem+of+St+Peter%22 John G. R. Forlong, ''Encyclopedia of Religions'': A-d - Page 471]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Antiquary"&gt;The Antiquary: a magazine devoted to the study of the past, Volume 17 edited by [[Edward Walford]], [[John Charles Cox]], George Latimer Apperson - page 202 [https://books.google.com/books?id=jeAmWNkmpHUC&amp;pg=PA202&amp;lpg=PA202&amp;dq=sixth+century+Pope+Gregory+the+cock+the+emblem+of+Christianity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bGRh9hE0Vl&amp;sig=M4VfpbZnY_ojmvNlvRkL7dV6T8g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CAK5T4-VB4LA8ATU8cGnBA&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=sixth%20century%20Pope%20Gregory%20the%20cock%20the%20emblem%20of%20Christianity&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this,&lt;ref name=Forlong/&gt; the cock gradually began to be used as a weather vane on church steeples, and in the 9th century [[Pope Nicholas I]]&lt;ref name="smithsonianmag.com"&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Jerry Adler |author2=Andrew Lawler |date=June 2012 |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/?no-ist= |magazine=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt; ordered the figure to be placed on every church steeple.&lt;ref&gt;The Philadelphia Museum bulletin, Volumes 1-5 - By Pennsylvania Museum of Art, Pennsylvania Museum and School of Industrial Art, Philadelphia Museum of Art - p 14 - 1906 [https://books.google.com/books?id=0HIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA14&amp;lpg=RA2-PA14&amp;dq=sixth+century+Pope+Gregory+declared+the+cock+the+emblem+of+Christianity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KVeGwJpdTe&amp;sig=ccsDg49XZiGR4dj2XP2yP319OE4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NwW5T9K0DIiQ9gSEyaHICg&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=sixth%20century%20Pope%20Gregory%20declared%20the%20cock%20the%20emblem%20of%20Christianity&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] of the 1070s depicts a man installing a [[rooster|cock]] on [[Westminster Abbey]].

One alternative theory about the origin of weathercocks on church steeples is that it was an emblem of the vigilance of the clergy calling the people to prayer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Forster+Circle+%22devised+as+an+emblem%22 Thomas Ignatius M. Forster, ''Circle of the Seasons'', p. 18]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory says that the cock was not a Christian symbol&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=William+White+%22steeples+may+possibly%22 William White, ''Notes and Queries'']&lt;/ref&gt; but an emblem of the sun&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Jennings+%22innumerable+weathercocks%22 Hargrave Jennings, ''Phallicism'', p. 72]&lt;/ref&gt; derived from the Goths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=Shepard+Walsh+%22derived+from+the+Goths%22 William Shepard Walsh, ''A Handy Book of Curious Information'']&lt;/ref&gt;

A few churches used weather vanes in the shape of the emblems of their patron saints. The [[City of London]] has two surviving examples. The weather vane of [[St Peter upon Cornhill]] is not in the shape of a rooster, but a key;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://historylondon.wordpress.com/2013/12/30/vanity-and-wind/|title=History of London: Vanity and Wind|publisher=Wordpress|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[St Lawrence Jewry]]'s weather vane is in the form of a gridiron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlawrencejewry.org.uk/photos.php?pgid=2&amp;photoid=1278087163|title=Our Weather Vane|publisher=St Lawrence Jewry|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early weather vanes had very ornamental pointers, but modern wind vanes are usually simple arrows that dispense with the directionals because the instrument is connected to a remote reading station. An early example of this was installed in the Royal Navy's [[Admiralty]] building in London – the vane on the roof was mechanically linked to a large dial in the boardroom so senior officers were always aware of the wind direction when they met.

Modern ''aerovanes'' combine the directional vane with an [[anemometer]] (a device for measuring wind speed). Co-locating both instruments allows them to use the same axis (a vertical rod) and provides a coordinated readout.

==World's largest weather vane==
According to the [[Guinness World Records]], the world's largest weather vane is a [[Tío Pepe]] [[sherry]] advertisement located in [[Jerez de la Frontera|Jerez]], [[Spain]]. The city of [[Montague, Michigan]] also claims to have the largest standard-design weather vane, being a ship and arrow which measures 48 feet tall, with an arrow 26 feet long.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michigan.org/Property/Detail.aspx?p=G4884 |title=The World's Largest Weather Vane -  Ella Ellenwood|date= |accessdate=2010-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A challenger for the title of world's largest weather vane is located in [[Whitehorse, Yukon]]. The weather vane is a retired [[Douglas DC-3]] CF-CPY atop a swiveling support. Located at the Yukon Transportation Museum&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goytm.ca goytm.ca]&lt;/ref&gt; beside [[Whitehorse International Airport]], the weather vane is used by pilots to determine wind direction, used as a landmark by tourists and enjoyed by locals. The weather vane only requires a 5 knot wind to rotate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.explorenorth.com/library/aviation/cf-cpy.html |title=DC-3 CF-CPY: The World's Largest Weather Vane - ExploreNorth |publisher=ExploreNorth |date= |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A challenger for the worlds tallest weather vane is located in [[Westlock]], [[Alberta]].  The classic weather vane that reaches to 50 feet is topped by a 1942 Case Model D Tractor.  This landmark is located at the [http://canadiantractormuseum.ca/ Canadian Tractor Museum].  

==Slang term==
The term "weathervane" is also a slang word for a politician who has frequent changes of opinion. The [[National Assembly of Quebec]] has banned use of this slang term as a slur after its use by members of the legislature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Quebec bans 'weathervane' insult |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/article.html?in_article_id=71265&amp;in_page_id=2 |newspaper=Metro |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2010-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
