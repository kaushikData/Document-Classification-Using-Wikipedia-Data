'''Azerbaijani art''' has developed over the ancient [[history of Azerbaijan]] and [[Iranian Azerbaijan]]. The [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] have created a rich and distinctive culture, a major part of which is [[Decorative arts|decorative]] and [[applied art]]. This form of art rooted in hoary antiquity, is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jewelery-making, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lacing&lt;!--lace-making?--&gt;, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery. Each of these types of [[Visual arts of Azerbaijan|decorative art]], evidence of the culture and endowments of the Azerbaijan nation, is very popular there. Many interesting facts pertaining to the development of arts and crafts in Azerbaijan were reported by numerous merchants, travelers and diplomats who had visited these places at different times.

Images reflecting magic, [[totem]]ic notions of ancient people, their religious customs and hunting scenes saved on rocks in [[Gobustan National Park|Gobustan]] evidence about primitive art in the [[Paleolithic]] epoch. Men and women, fishing scenes, images of people dancing on the rocks, galloping horses hunters, lonely figure of a reaper with a sickle, round dances of people reminding of “[[yalli]]”, boats with rowers, solar signs and various wild animals had been portrayed there.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1076 UNESCO World Heritage: Gobustan Rock Art Cultural Landscape]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gamigaya Petroglyphs]] in the territory of [[Ordubad Rayon]] are dated back to the 4th-1st centuries BC. About 1500 dislodged and carved rock paintings with images of deer, goats, bulls, dogs, snakes, birds, fantastic beings and also people, carriages and various symbols had been found out on basalt rocks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://irs-az.com/pdf/090621154956.pdf Наскальные рисунки Гямигая]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Caucasian albanian stone azerbaijan mingechaur2.jpg|250px|thumb|The stone cap of the 5th-6th centuries found out in a temple in Sudagilan settlement of Mingachevir Rayon with an inscription in [[Caucasian Albanian language]]&lt;ref name="artofazerbaijan" /&gt;]]
Development of old and appearance of new cities favored development of caravan trade and expansion of handicraft production. Many cities famed for rug weaving, production of artistic ceramic jars, gold and silver items.

Patterns of engravings and sculptures were broadly spread in visual arts in the period of [[Caucasian Albania]]’s existence.&lt;ref name="artofazerbaijan" /&gt;

A stone cap of the 5th-6th centuries found out in Sudagilan settlement of Mingachevir Rayon were one of the most famous findings of that time. A cup found out in Bartim village and dated from the 2nd-4th centuries is kept in the [[State Historical Museum|Moscow Museum of History]].

[[File:Momine Fragment.jpg|left|thumb|Ornament on Momine Khatun Mausoleum in Nakhchivan, the 12th century]]
Seizure of Caucasian Albania by Arabs in the 7th century was of great importance in further development of visual arts. [[Muslim]] – [[Culture of Iran|Iranian]] and [[Arab culture|Arabic]] cultures began to spread in the territory of modern Azerbaijan. Construction of mosques, mausoleums, castles and other cultic architectural monuments was followed by their decoration with various patterns and ornaments, calligraphic elements (epitaph), tile and bas-reliefs. Restriction of images of alive beings by [[Islam]] stimulated development of ornamental forms of decorative arts. Ornaments on [[Momine Khatun Mausoleum]] in Nakhchivan, constructed in the epoch of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] [[Atabeg]]’ reign and khanegah on the shore of the [[Pirsaat River]] are interesting monuments of that time.

[[File:Divankhane ornament.jpg|150px|thumb|"Divankhana". A fragment of a decoration. Palace of the Shirvanshahs in Baku, the 15th century]]
Set of small states appeared in the territory of Azerbaijan after weakening of [[Caliphate|Arab Caliphate]]. Local art schools were opened in cities such as [[Barda Rayon|Barda]], [[Shamakhi Rayon|Shamakhi]], [[Beylagan Rayon|Beylagan]], [[Ganja, Azerbaijan|Ganja]], [[Nakhchivan (city)|Nakhchivan]] and [[Shabran (historical city)|Shabran]]. Architectural schools of [[Architectural school of Nakhchivan|Nakchivan]], [[Shirvan (city)|Shirvan]]-[[Absheron Rayon|Absheron]] and [[Tabriz]] are the most important among them. Monuments and constructions of “Nakhchivan school” are distinguished for their ceramic details, which initially were one-colored, but then became multi-colored. Ornamental motifs generally consisted of baked brick and tile. Smooth stone walls with plastics which were rarely used in architectural elements, belong to “Shirvan-Absheron architectural school”. Patterns of stone carving art, geometric and plant ornaments take an important place in buildings belonging to this architectural school.

Artistic value of “[[divankhana]]” from [[Palace of the Shirvanshahs]] ensemble “are determined by perfection of the composition, tectonics of architectural forms, virtuosity of painting and creation of ornaments” according to L.Bretatsinki and B.Weymarn.

Stones with inscriptions and images of people and animals (tiger, camel, horse, bull and bird) had been found out in the Shirvanshahs’ architectural monument called [[Sabayil Castle]] constructed in the 13th century in [[Bay of Baku|Baku Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_pictures/52/%D0%90%D0%B7%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B1%D0%B0%D0%B9%D0%B4%D0%B6%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0%D1%8F Художественная энциклопедия]&lt;/ref&gt; There had been made in deep carving style and had characteristics of frieze. This monument is a pattern of sculptural art where inscriptions and salient images was a decisive factor in decorative design of buildings. Cultural traditions of ancient Caucasian Albania are saved in reliefs of the stones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotekar.ru/Iskuss2/7.htm Академия художеств СССР.

Искусство Азербайджана]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayil stones which had characteristics of friezes, consisted of decorative elements in grand architectural land monuments located on land, at that time.

Ceramic items found out during archeological excavations in Shabran and Baylagan also give evidence of the high-level development of visual arts in the [[Middle Ages]].

===Azerbaijani rugs===
{{main|Azerbaijani carpet weaving|Azerbaijani rug|Quba rugs and carpets|Ganja rugs|Karabakh carpet}}
Azerbaijani rugs are a product of [[Azerbaijan]], an ancient center of carpet weaving. 
Azerbaijan has been since the ancient times known as a center of a large variety of crafts. The archeological dig on the territory of Azerbaijan testifies to the well developed agriculture, stock raising, metal working, pottery and ceramics, and last but not least carpet-weaving that date as far back as to the 2nd millennium BC. Development of carpet weaving boosted after [[Ismail I]]'s takeover of [[Safavid dynasty]].

Azerbaijani carpets can be categorized under several large groups and a multitude of subgroups. The true scientific research of the Azerbaijani carpet is connected with the name of [[Latif Karimov]], a prominent scientist and artist. It was his classification that related the four large groups of carpets with the four geographical zones of Azerbaijan, i.e. Guba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh, Karabakh and Tabriz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art - KMT |url=http://www.kmt.az/culture/art.html |website=www.kmt.az |accessdate=6 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213642/http://www.kmt.az/culture/art.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Karabakh carpet]] is one of five major regional groups of carpets made in [[Azerbaijan]] named after the [[Karabakh]] region, which comprises present [[Nagorno-Karabakh]] and adjacent lowland territories ('lowland Karabakh'). The Karabakh carpets amount to 33 compositions. Due to the specifics of the local sheep wool the Karabakh carpets are characterized by thick pile, high and fluffy. These carpets are marked for their vivid and joyous colors. They are divided into four groups: without medallions, with medallions, namazlyk and subject carpet. In the mountainous part of Karabakh the carpets were made in Malybeili, Muradkhanly, Dashbulakh, Jebrail, Goradis and many other villages.

In 2010, art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving in Azerbaijan was added to the [[Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]].

===Tabriz school of miniature painting===
[[Persian miniature|Persian miniature painting]] was developing in the territory of Azerbaijan in the Middle Ages. Manuscripts with miniature paintings of people, animals and landscapes in them were popular at that time. Heores of poetic works by [[Ferdowsi]], [[Nizami Ganjavi|Nizami]], [[Saadi Shirazi|Saadi]], [[Hafez]], [[Jami]], [[Navoiy]], [[Amir Khusrow|Amir Khusrow Dehlawi]] and others took an important place in creativity of Persian miniature artists.&lt;ref&gt;G.Fehervari. Art and architecture // Peter Malcolm Holt, Ann K. S. Lambton, Bernard Lewis. The Cambridge history of Islam, vol. 2. Cambridge University Press, 1977. {{ISBN|0-521-29138-0}}, 9780521291385. Стр. 738 ''"In miniature painting, Herat remained the centre only for a few years after Shah Ismail's occupation of the city. Artists, like Bihzad and many of his pupils, moved to the new capital, Tabriz. Thus Tabriz became once more a centre of '''Persian painting'''. Another new centre emerged in Bukhara, which was very active during the tenth/sixteenth and early eleventh/seventeenth centuries. Illumination of manuscripts of the Shah-namа and Khamsa of Nizami continued. Bihzad's style was followed for quite a long time. Upon the moving of the capital to Isfahan under Shah 'Abbas I, a new school of painters was founded there which excelled not only in miniature painting, but also in the production of bookbindings and in lacquer-works as well."''&lt;/ref&gt; In the middle of the 15th century, a new style –“[[Turkmenistan|Turkmen]] style” – of miniature spread in the territories of [[Kara Koyunlu]] and [[Aq Qoyunlu]] states was developed.&lt;ref name="artofazerbaijan" &gt;[http://www.elibrary.az/docs/artofazerb.pdf Л. С. Бретаницкий, Б. В. Веймарн. Очерки истории и теории изобразительных искусств. Искусство Азербайджана]&lt;/ref&gt; Such miniatures of this style were made in Tabriz and other cities located in the territory of modern Azerbaijan. Shamakhi – the capital of the Shirvanshahs’ Government was one of them. Traces of this now ancient style created by artists worked in workshops of [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashidaddin]] in the beginning of the 14th century can be observed in miniatures created by Abdul-Bagi Bakuvi, [[Baku]] artist of the 15th century. Illustrations for “Anthology of the Eastern poetry” or “Anthology of Shamakhi” of 1468 and saved in [[British Museum]] in [[London]] are the best miniatures created by artist of Shamakhi and Baku. One-figured and two-figured portraits painted by Abdulbagi Bakuvi (“Stableman” and “Two amirs”) and saved in [[Topkapı Palace|Topkapi Museum]], in [[Istanbul]] belong to miniature art of Baku. Influence of Far Eastern painting can be felt in creativity of many miniature artists of that time.

Wars between [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]] and also feudal wrangles among [[Khanates of the Caucasus|khanates]] adversely affected development of visual arts in 17th-18th centuries. But colorful masterpieces of visual arts had been continuing created and the [[Palace of Shaki Khans]] built by architect Khadali Zeynalabdin from [[Shiraz]] in 1797, is one of these masterpieces. These decorative paintings created by masters such as Abbasgulu, [[Usta Gambar Garabaghi]], Aligulu, Gurban Ali, Shukur and others were created with bright and motley colors. Images of people and animals, and also battle and hunting scenes were painted on the waslls of the palace.

Monumental constrictions, generally was suffering a decline. In the XVIII, wall paintings which mainly consisted of compositions of plant motifs appeared in houses of wealthy townsmen.&lt;ref name="enciclopediya"&gt;{{cite web

A '''banduryst''' ({{lang-uk|бандури́ст}}) is a person who plays the [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[plucked string instrument]] known as the [[bandura]].

==Types of performers==
There are a number of different types of bandurist who differ in their particular choice of instrument, the specific repertoire they play and manner in which they approach their vocation.

*'''[[Kobzar]]i''', who play authentic ethnographic instruments or copies. This group can also be further categorized into ''authentic'', ''reproduction'', and ''stage'' performers.
*'''Academic players''', playing more sophisticated contemporary concert banduras. These performers have a [[tertiary education]] majoring in bandura performance and typically perform works by Western classical composers in addition to, or instead of, Ukrainian folk music. This category can be further divided into instrumentalists (who only perform instrumental works) and vocalists (who primarily use the bandura to accompany their voice). The most common academic bandurists play in the [[Kiev academic style]]. There are also a number of [[Kharkiv style]] academic bandurists.
* So-called "'''Fakeloric'''" '''performers''', who play stylized songs and repertoire on contemporary instruments. Othen these performers refer to themselves as contemporary kobzars. Many contemporary blind bandurists can be placed into this category.
*'''Ensemble performers''' - performers who sing in a choir and accompany their chorral performance with their own playing on the bandura.

===Ensembles===

[[Image:Kaplelia39.jpg|thumb|150px|[[The Canadian Bandurist Capella]].]]

Evidence of ensemble playing prior to the 20th century is scarce, although there do exist accounts of two or sometimes three kobzars playing together at bazaars, especially in the area around Kharkiv.

The first documented performance by a bandura ensemble however took place in Kharkiv in 1902, at the [[XIIth Archeological conference]]. The performance had a very positive effect on the popularity of the bandura and ensemble bandura playing. Attempts were made by [[Hnat Khotkevych]] to repeat the performance and take the ensemble on tour throughout [[Ukraine]], but permission was not obtained from the Russian authorities.

In 1905 there is evidence of the first performance of a bandura quartet of non-blind bandurists performing in [[Moscow]]. From 1906 small bandura ensembles began to form not just from kobzars who had participated in the [[Kharkiv]] performance of 1902 but also from non-blind bandurists and had become interested in the instrument. Groups were established by [[M. Domontovych]] in Kiev and [[V. Shevchenko]] in Moscow and the Kuban.

What is considered to be the first professional (in the sense that this was their main livelihood) bandurist ensemble was established by [[Vasyl Yemetz]] in 1918 and became known as the [[Kiev Bandurist Capella]]. Despite periods in which the ensemble did not function due to the political turmoil within the country, the ensemble re-established and re-defined itself on numerous occasions and through its concerts stimulated the establishment of many other similar bandura groups. By 1928 there were over 900 bandura ensembles in [[Ukraine]].

Active persecution of bandurists in the 1930s resulted in many players being murdered or persecuted in the 1930s. Many of those that continued playing took the opportunity of seeking freedom emigrating to the West. The [[Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus]] which was originally established in 1941 during the Nazi occupation emigrated as a group. It settled in [[Detroit]] in the USA where it continued to actively propagated the art form in the West.

The [[Kiev State Bandurist Capella]] was re-established in [[Kiev]] in 1948 under the direction of [[Oleksander Minkivsky]]. Many members after being mobilized to the front in 1941 had died. Others had emigrated. It currently has over 70 members. Numerous other bandurist Capellas exist in Ukraine throughout the country having all male membership, mixed membership, or just female membership. A capella made up of blind bandurists also exists in Lviv.

Bandurist choruses, ensembles and capellas were also established in [[Argentina]], Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Paraguay, Poland the United States and Venezuela.

{{Renaissance}}
{{Bengalis}}
The '''Bengali renaissance''' or simply '''Bengal renaissance''', ({{lang-bn|বাংলার নবজাগরণ}}; Bānglār nabajāgaraṇ) was a [[Cultural movement|cultural]], [[Social movement|social]], [[Intellectual history|intellectual]] and [[Art movement|artistic movement]] in [[Bengal region]] in the eastern part of the [[Indian subcontinent]] during the period of the [[British Indian Empire]], from the nineteenth century to the early twentieth century dominated by [[Bengali Hindus]].&lt;ref name="Willford1991"&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Clinton Willford|title=Religious Resurgence in British India: Vivekananda and the Hindu Renaissance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ifNyrle9u0C|year=1991|publisher=University of California, San Diego, Department of Anthropology}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bengal renaissance can be said to have started with [[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]] (1772–1833) and ended with [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (1861–1941), although there have been many stalwarts, such as [[Satyajit Ray]] (1921-1992), thereafter embodying particular aspects of the unique intellectual and creative output.&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Bengali-speaking People'' by Nitish Sengupta, p 211, UBS Publishers' Distributors Pvt. Ltd. {{ISBN|81-7476-355-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nineteenth-century Bengal was a unique blend of religious and social reformers, scholars, literary giants, journalists, patriotic orators and scientists, all merging to form the image of a renaissance, and marked the transition from the 'medieval' to the 'modern'.&lt;ref&gt;Sumit Sarkar, "Calcutta and the Bengal Renaissance", in ''[[Calcutta]], the Living City'' ed. Sukanta Chaudhuri, Vol I, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

== &lt;span lang =="Bangla" dir="rtl"&gt;Background&lt;/span&gt; ==
[[File:Raja Ram Mohan Roy.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Raja Ram Mohan Roy]] is regarded as the "''Father of the Bengal Renaissance''."]]
During this period, [[Bengal]] witnessed an [[intellectual]] awakening that is in some way similar to the [[Renaissance]] in Europe during the 16th century, although Europeans of that age were not confronted with the challenge and influence of alien [[colonialism]]. This movement questioned existing orthodoxies, particularly with respect to women, marriage, the [[Dowry system in India|dowry]] system, the [[caste system]], and religion. One of the earliest [[social movement]]s that emerged during this time was the [[Young Bengal]] movement, that espoused [[rationalism]] and [[atheism]] as the common denominators of civil conduct among upper caste educated Hindus.
[[File:Keshab Chandra Sen.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Keshub Chandra Sen]] is one of the early pioneers of [[Brahmo Samaj]].]]
The parallel socio-religious movement, the [[Brahmo Samaj]], developed during this time period and counted many of the leaders of the Bengal Renaissance among its followers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangalinet.com/calcutta3.htm  "Reform and Education: Young Bengal &amp; Derozio", ''Bengalinet.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; In the earlier years the Brahmo Samaj, like the rest of society, could not however, conceptualize, in that feudal-colonial era, a free India as it was influenced by the European [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (and its bearers in India, the [[British Raj]]) although it traced its intellectual roots to the [[Upanishad]]s. Their version of Hinduism, or rather Universal Religion (similar to that of [[Ramakrishna]]), although devoid of practices like [[Sati (practice)|sati]] and [[polygamy]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} that had crept into the social aspects of Hindu life, was ultimately a rigid impersonal [[monotheistic]] faith, which actually was quite distinct from the pluralistic and multifaceted nature of the way the Hindu religion was practiced. Future leaders like [[Keshub Chunder Sen]] were as much devotees of [[Christ]], as they were of [[Brahma]], [[Krishna]] or the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]]. It has been argued by some scholars that the Brahmo Samaj movement never gained the support of the masses and remained restricted to the elite, although Hindu society has accepted most of the social reform programmes of the Brahmo Samaj. It must also be acknowledged that many of the later Brahmos were also leaders of the [[Indian freedom movement|freedom movement]].

The renaissance period after the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] saw a magnificent outburst of Bengali literature. While Ram Mohan Roy and [[Iswar Chandra Vidyasagar]] were the pioneers, others like [[Bankim Chandra Chatterjee]] widened it and built upon it.&lt;ref&gt;''History of Bengali-speaking People'' by Nitish Sengupta, p 253.&lt;/ref&gt; The first significant nationalist detour to the Bengal Renaissance was given by the writings of Bankim Chandra Chatterjee.  Later writers of the period who introduced broad discussion of social problems and more colloquial forms of Bengali into mainstream literature included [[Saratchandra Chatterjee]].
[[File:Tagorenazrul.png|thumb|right|[[Rabindranath Tagore]] is [[Asia]]'s first [[Nobel laureate]] and composer of [[Jana Gana Mana]] the national anthem of [[India]] as well as [[Amar Shonar Bangla]] the [[national anthem]] of [[Bangladesh]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]] the national poet of [[Bangladesh]].]]

The [[Tagore family]], including [[Rabindranath Tagore]], were leaders of this period and had a particular interest in educational reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infed.org/thinkers/tagore.htm Kathleen M. O'Connell, "Rabindranath Tagore on Education", ''infed.org'']&lt;/ref&gt; Their contribution to the Bengal Renaissance was multi-faceted. Tagore's 1901 [[Bengali language|Bengali]] [[novella]], ''[[Nastanirh]]'' was written as a critique of men who professed to follow the ideals of the Renaissance, but failed to do so within their own families. In many ways Rabindranath Tagore's writings (especially poems and songs) can be seen as imbued with the spirit of the [[Upanishads]]. His works repeatedly allude to Upanishadic ideas regarding soul, liberation, transmigration and—perhaps most essentially—about a spirit that imbues all creation not unlike the Upanishadic Brahman. Tagore's English translation of a set of poems titled the [[Gitanjali]] won him the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]] in 1913. He was the first [[Asian people|Asian]] to win this award (and the first non-European/non-white person of 'colour' to win the Nobel Prize in any category). That was the only example at the time but the contribution of the Tagore family is enormous.&lt;ref name="Deb, Chitra, pp 64-65"&gt;Deb, Chitra, pp 64-65.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison with European renaissance==
The word "renaissance" in European history meant "rebirth" and was used in the context of the revival of the Graeco-Roman learning in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries after the long winter of the dark medieval period. A serious comparison was started by the [[dramatis personae]] of the Bengal renaissance like [[Keshab Chandra Sen]], [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] and [[M. N. Roy]]. For about a century, Bengal's conscious awareness and the changing modern world was more developed and ahead of the rest of India.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} The role played by Bengal in the modern awakening of India is thus comparable to the position occupied by Italy in the European renaissance. Very much like the [[Italian Renaissance]], it was not a mass movement; but instead restricted to the upper classes. 

Though the Bengal Renaissance was the "culmination of the process of emergence of the cultural characteristics of the [[Bengali people]] that had started in the age of [[Alauddin Hussain Shah|Hussein Shah]], it remained predominantly [[Hindu]] and only partially [[Muslim]]." There were, nevertheless, examples of Muslim intellectuals such as [[Syed Ameer Ali]], [[Mir Mosharraf Hossain|Mosharraf Hussain]],&lt;ref&gt;''History of Bengali-speaking People'' by Nitish Sengupta, p 210, 212-213.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sake Dean Mahomed]], [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], and [[Roquia Sakhawat Hussain]]. The [[Freedom of Intellect Movement]] sought to challenge religious and social dogma in Bengali Muslim society.

==Science and technology==
During the Bengal Renaissance science was also advanced by several Bengali scientists such as [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], [[Anil Kumar Gain]], [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis]], [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]] and [[Meghnad Saha]]. Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose was a [[polymath]]: a [[List of physicists|physicist]], [[biologist]], [[Botany|botanist]], [[Archaeology|archaeologist]], and writer of [[science fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://frontlineonnet.com/fl2124/stories/20041203003009100.htm A versatile genius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203202750/http://frontlineonnet.com/fl2124/stories/20041203003009100.htm |date=3 February 2009 }}, ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]'' '''21''' (24), 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He pioneered the investigation of [[radio]] and [[microwave]] [[optics]], made very significant contributions to [[plant science]], and laid the foundations of [[experiment]]al [[science]] in the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref&gt;Chatterjee, Santimay and Chatterjee, Enakshi, ''Satyendranath Bose'', 2002 reprint, p. 5, National Book Trust, {{ISBN|8123704925}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is considered one of the fathers of radio science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Sir J.C. Bose and radio science |last1=Sen |first1=A.

He was the first from the Indian subcontinent to get a [[United States patent law|US patent]], in 1904. [[Anil Kumar Gain]] and [[Prasanta Chandra Mahalanobis]] were leading mathematicians and statisticians of their time. Gain went on to found [[Vidyasagar University]], while Mahalanobis laid the foundation of the [[Indian Statistical Institute]]. Satyendra Nath Bose was a [[physicist]], specializing in [[mathematical physics]]. He is best known for his work on [[quantum mechanics]] in the early 1920s, providing the foundation for [[Bose-Einstein statistics]] and the theory of the [[Bose-Einstein condensate]]. He is honoured as the namesake of the [[boson]]. Although more than one [[Nobel Prize]] was awarded for research related to the concepts of the boson, Bose-Einstein statistics and Bose-Einstein condensate—the latest being the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]], which was given for advancing the theory of Bose-Einstein condensates—Bose himself was never awarded the Nobel Prize.

According to historian Romesh Chunder Dutt:&lt;ref&gt;''Cultural Heritage of Bengal'' by R. C. Dutt, quoted by Nitish Sengupta, pp 211-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The conquest of Bengal by the English was not only a political revolution, but ushered in a greater revolution in thoughts and ideas, in religion and society... From the stories of gods and goddesses, kings and queens, princes and princesses, we have learnt to descend to the humble walks of life, to sympathise with the common citizen or even common peasant … Every revolution is attended with vigour, and the present one is no exception to the rule. Nowhere in the annals of Bengali literature are so many and so bright names found crowded together in the limited space of one century as those of Ram Mohan Roy, Akshay Kumar Dutt, Isvar Chandra Vidyasagar, Michael Madhusudan Dutt, Hem Chandra Banerjee, Bankim Chandra Chatterjee and Dina Bandhu Mitra. Within the three quarters of the present century, prose, blank verse, historical fiction and drama have been introduced for the first time in the Bengali literature...}}

The '''Burney Collection''' consists of over 1,270 17th-18th century newspapers and other news materials, gathered by [[Charles Burney (scholar)|Charles Burney]], most notable for the 18th-century London newspapers. The original collection, totalling almost 1 million pages, is held by the [[British Library]].

== Contents of the collection ==
===Highlights===
Key objects in the collection include:
*The financial scandal of the 1720s, the South Sea bubble, with reports in the ''Weekly Journal'' or ''Saturday’s Post'' of how Parliament decided that if they left the country, the directors of the South Sea company "shall suffer death as a felon without benefit of clergy and forfeit to the King all his Lands, Goods and Chattels whatsoever."
*First advertisement for ''[[The Memoirs of Fanny Hill]]'' in the ''[[Whitehall Evening Post]]'', 6 March 1750, and then, in the issue of 17 March, a report of how the publisher was taken into custody and all copies were seized.
* Insight into English attitudes to contemporary events, such as when the ''[[English Chronicle|English Chronicle, or, Universal Evening Post]]'' used the unusual device of a headline –  FRENCH REVOLUTION!! –  for a whole page article on 18 of July 1789. It reported sympathetically on the fall of the Bastille four days earlier, including how the officers were decapitated in ‘a sad but necessary spectacle...a solemnity worthy of the highest admiration.’

== Preservation and access ==
===Microfilm===
Due to rapid deterioration of the collection, a decision was made to microfilm the collection and restrict access to physical copies. The success of the microfilm project led to many other book collections being preserved on film.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Library Publishing |series=British Library Occasional Papers 2| chapter=Publishing and preservation |first=Nicholas |last=Barker |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7239">The '''Cello Concerto No. 1 in C major''', [[Hoboken-Verzeichnis|Hob.]] VIIb/1, by [[Joseph Haydn]] was composed around 1761-65 for longtime friend [[Joseph Franz Weigl]], then the principal cellist of [[Nikolaus I, Prince Esterházy|Prince Nicolaus]]'s Esterházy Orchestra.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Konzert in C für Violoncello und Orchester |last=Haydn |first=Joseph |authorlink= |others=Clément, Roger (trans.) |year=2007 |publisher=Bärenreiter-Verlag |location=[[Kassel]] |isbn= |pages=V–VI |url= }} ISMN M-006-20254-6&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was presumed lost until 1961, when musicologist Oldřich Pulkert discovered a copy of the score at the [[Prague National Museum]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Konzert in C für Violoncello und Orchester |last=Haydn |first=Joseph |authorlink= |others=Clément, Roger (trans.) |year=2007 |publisher=Bärenreiter-Verlag |location=[[Kassel]] |isbn= |pages=V–VI |url= }} ISMN M-006-20254-6&lt;/ref&gt; Though some doubts have been raised about the authenticity of the work, most experts believe that Haydn did compose this concerto.

== Background ==
Although the full work was discovered in 1961, Haydn had written the beginning of the principal theme of the first movement in his draft catalogue of 1765.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anders|first1=Gerhard|last2=Anderson|first2=Keith|title=Liner notes to HAYDN: Cello Concertos Nos. 1, 2 and 4|url=http://www.naxos.com/mainsite/blurbs_reviews.asp?item_code=8.555041&amp;catNum=555041&amp;filetype=About+this+Recording&amp;language=English|website=naxos.com|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Furse|first1=Edward Niel|title=PERSPECTIVES ON THE RECEPTION OF HAYDN’S CELLO CONCERTO IN C, WITH PARTICULAR REFERENCE TO MUSICOLOGICAL WRITINGS IN ENGLISH ON HAYDN’S CONCERTOS AND THE CLASSICAL CONCERTO (Master's thesis)|url=http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/516/1/FurseMMus10.pdf|accessdate=17 January 2017|page=4|date=2009|quote=The only record of the work is its appearance in Haydn’s own thematic catalogue of compositions, compiled in 1765 to prove to Prince Nikolaus Esterházy that he was working diligently.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This early work, contemporaneous with symphonies [[Symphony No. 6 (Haydn)|6]], [[Symphony No. 7 (Haydn)|7]] and [[Symphony No. 8 (Haydn)|8]] and predating his [[Cello Concerto No. 2 (Haydn)|D major cello concerto]] by around twenty years, already shows Haydn as a master of instrumental writing. The solo [[cello]] part is thoroughly idiomatic. The concerto reflects the [[ritornello]] form of the [[Baroque music|baroque]] concerto as well as the emerging structure of the sonata-allegro form. As in the baroque [[concerto grosso]], the accompanying ensemble is small: strings, two oboes, and two horns.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite book |title=Konzert in C für Violoncello und Orchester |last=Haydn |first=Joseph |authorlink= |others=Clément, Roger (trans.) |year=2007 |publisher=Bärenreiter-Verlag |location=[[Kassel]] |isbn= |pages=V–VI |url= }} ISMN M-006-20254-6&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible that Weigl was the only cellist in the Esterházy Orchestra when Haydn composed the concerto, since there is only one cello line in the score, marked alternately “solo” and “tutti.” There is also, however, a [[basso continuo]] line, that might have been played by another cellist, or by Haydn himself on the harpsichord, or by a string bass player.

==Movements==
# [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Moderato]] 
# [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Adagio]]
# [[Tempo#Italian tempo markings|Allegro]] [[Wiktionary:molto|molto]]

All three movements of this work are written in [[sonata form]], unlike the second concerto, where [[Rondo|rondo form]] is used in the second and third movements. This concerto is more related to Haydn's violin concerti than its follower, holding very close resemblance to the [[Violin Concerto No. 3 (Haydn)|Violin Concerto no. 3 in A major]], such as the first movement's etched rhythms, and flowing second themes, a peaceful slow movement, and a brisk finale. Both concerti were composed in the same period of time. 

[[Image:score.JPG|thumb|Entrance of solo cello]]

After the orchestral exposition of the first movement, the solo instrument plays the opening theme with full chords that use all four strings. Virtuosity is developed further in the use of rapidly repeating notes, the very high range, and quick contrasts of register. This movement is dominated by a single theme, although the theme itself includes several motives that Haydn develops separately. Near the end, a cadenza is played. 

In the slow movement (scored without winds),&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:scoremov2.jpg|thumb|Caption text]]  --&gt; the cello enters dramatically on a long note, played while the orchestral strings relaunch the opening theme. Two measures later the cello goes on to imitate this melody. Haydn was fond of this gesture: several times in the movement the cello enters on a sustained pitch. This movement, like the first, calls for a cadenza toward the end.

The finale also has the cello enter on a long note, after an extended orchestral introduction. &lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:scoremov3.jpg|thumb|Caption text]] --&gt; This spirited finale, written in sonata allegro form, represented another chance for Haydn to show what he could do in spinning out a single theme into a series of short motives and a large variety of rapidly changing moods. The virtuosity of the solo instrument is exploited in this movement, especially in passages where the cello alternates rapidly from low to high, so that it seems to be two instruments playing in [[counterpoint]]. Haydn uses the sustained-note entrance several times, the final one on a very high, penetrating G.&lt;ref&gt;'''Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra''' Program Notes 113 Edition&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Haydn's C Major Cello Concerto has become a staple of the cello repertoire, after its 20th century premiere by [[Miloš Sádlo]] and the Czechoslovak Radio Symphony Orchestra, conducted by [[Sir Charles Mackerras]], on 19 May 1962.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1444832/Milos-Sadlo.html Telegraph.co.uk - 20th-century premiere by Miloš Sádlo]&lt;/ref&gt; Many famous artists, including [[Jacqueline du Pré]], [[Yo-Yo Ma]], [[Julian Lloyd Webber]], [[Pierre Fournier]], [[Truls Mørk]], [[Mstislav Rostropovich]], [[Pieter Wispelwey]], [[Heinrich Schiff]], [[Lynn Harrell]], [[Christine Walevska]], [[Sol Gabetta]], [[Maximilian Hornung]], [[Mischa Maisky]], [[Steven Isserlis]], and [[Sergei Istomin]] have recorded it.

'''Dan Pyle''' (born April 4, 1954 in [[Wolf Point, Montana|Wolf Point]], [[Montana]]) is an American artist and a representative of [[Contemporary Realism]]. He works mainly in [[charcoal (art)|charcoal]] and his drawings highlight figurative objects in general and the human body in particular.&lt;ref&gt;''Art-to-Art Palette'' 08/2013, p. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

=== Career and artistic influence ===
[[file:Dan PYLE_Weary Traveler.jpg |thumb|''Weary Traveller'' (2014)]]

Dan Pyle was born in Wolf Point, Montana, and grew up in [[Washington (state)|Washington State]]. Dan Pyle has been drawing since his childhood and was awarded for his works early on. However, his artistic career began as a dancer with the [[Pacific Northwest Ballet]] in [[Seattle]], and was substantially influenced by his admiration for black and white photography. This cross fertilization is where his specific artistic style developed.&lt;ref&gt;Art Galleries Los Angeles, Artist Interview 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Pyle’s work is marked by contrasts and the special light of a [[Johannes Vermeer|Jan Vermeer]] and a [[J. M. W. Turner|William Turner]]. Thematically, the human body with its muscles, shapes and movements are at the forefront of his work, which he is able to present authentically and expressively as a former ballet dancer.&lt;ref&gt;Art of Man, edition 16 dated January 24, 2014, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; After moving to [[California]], Dan Pyle settled in [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], developing his detailed technique with new and unconventional materials.&lt;ref&gt;Art Galleries Los Angeles, Artist Interview 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Style and techniques ===
[[file:Dan PYLE_Lost in the Moment.jpg|thumb|''Lost in the Moment'' (2008)]]

Pyle's media initially include paintings in [[oil painting|oil]] and [[acrylic paint|acrylic]], and, during a later period, [[mural]]s for public spaces. After several phases, in which he also experimented with and [[Ink wash painting|ink]] and [[pencil]], as well as [[Pastel (color)|pastels]] and [[Watercolor painting|watercolors]], Pyle finally found the charcoal as the medium of his choice.&lt;ref&gt;''Art-to-Art Palette'' 08/2013&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to focusing on the human body there are unexpected and aged objects that he transforms into his charcoal compositions.  So, in addition to living figures, old teapots to rusted motorcycles become his models to which he gives a new identity through the use of contrast, negative space and isolation. The anonymity that his art is reflecting are subject and intention at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Art Galleries Los Angeles, Artist interview 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

[[file:Dan PYLE_Crushed.jpg |thumb|left|''Crushed'' (2014)]]

Pyle's technique with shadows and light seems to make the presence of color superfluous. So only a few of his works show deliberately weak color characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;''Art-to-Art Palette'' 08/2013&lt;/ref&gt; Even in his current phase, the artist shows himself adventurous and works, e.g., with formats on wood. The substrate with its idiosyncratic structures gives his drawings an additional dimension.&lt;ref&gt;Art Galleries Los Angeles, Artist Interview 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

When editing his works Pyle aims to include negative space which isolates the subject of the drawing. His original compositions are already in his mind's eye, and the photography helps Pyle to capture the exact vision that he wants to realize. By avoiding a final photographic sharpness, Pyle's work breaks away from [[photorealism]] and takes on its own interpretation of modern [[realism (arts)|realism]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott Brassart, in: The Bottom Line Magazine, Palm Springs 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exhibitions ===
Dan Pyle's works are exhibited primarily in the US and increasingly in [[Europe]]. With 23 images, the [[Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas|Cosmopolitan Hotel]]  in [[Las Vegas]] owns one of the largest private collections.&lt;ref&gt;''Art-to-Art Palette'' 08/2013&lt;/ref&gt; Other exhibitions were held in West Hollywood, [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]], [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Hollywood]], [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]] and [[New York City|New York]], and now also in [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;Art of Man, edition 16 dated January 24, 2014, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EverGreene Architectural Arts''' (EverGreene), based in New York City, is a specialty contractor and design studio working with commercial, government, institutional, sacred and theater clients in the areas of interior [[Conservation-restoration|restoration, conservation]], decoration and new design. Established in 1978, EverGreene is a company of artists, conservators, [[Artisan|craftsmen]] and designers who work throughout the United States and several sites abroad.

The company operates as both an art studio and a contractor combining art, science and technology as designers and craftsmen work side-by-side.

== History ==
In 1976, with the advent of the Historic Preservation tax Incentives, interest in historic preservation grew in the United States. EverGreene, originally started as a firm that almost exclusively focused on decorative painting and murals, expanded in size and service offerings to assist clients and owners of historic structures including: [[courthouse]]s, [[State Capitol Building|state capitols]], [[Church building|churches]], [[synagogue]]s, [[theater]]s and [[commercial buildings]]. To execute large scale projects, EverGreene will often partner with [[Architectural firm|architecture firms]] during the design and planning phases and with [[general contractors]] as a specialty contractor.

'''Frederic Richard "Dickie" Sullivan'''&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, p. 2.  Although Sullivan was sometimes credited as "Frederick" or "Fred", his birthname, as shown on his birth certificate was "Frederic Richard Sullivan".  See General Record Office index of births for the third quarter of 1872.&lt;/ref&gt; (sometimes credited as "Frederick"; 18 July 1872 &amp;ndash; 24 July 1937), was an English-born American [[film director]] and actor of the [[silent film|silent era]]. He directed 34 films between 1913 and 1923. He also appeared in 29 films between 1913 and 1935.  He also acted on stage.  He was a nephew of the composer [[Arthur Sullivan]].

==Early life==
Sullivan was born in [[Pimlico]] in London, England, the son of [[Fred Sullivan]] and Charlotte Louisa Lacy (1841–1885). His uncle was composer [[Arthur Sullivan]].  He had seven brothers and sisters: Amy Sophie (1863–1947), Florence Louise (1865–1891), Edith Mary (1866–1877), [[Herbert Sullivan|Herbert "Bertie" Thomas]] (1868–1928), Maud "Cissie" Helen (1870–1940), George Arthur (1874–1919) and William Lacy (1877–1902). Sullivan's father died in 1877, leaving his pregnant mother with seven children under the age of 14.  After his father's death, Sullivan's uncle Arthur visited the family often and became guardian to all of the children. In 1881, Charlotte married Captain Benjamin Hutchinson, a man 13 years her junior.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, pp. 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1883, at the urging of Charlotte's brother, William Lacy, the family emigrated to [[Los Angeles, California]], in the United States, except for Sullivan's eldest brother, Bertie, who stayed with their uncle Arthur in London.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Charlotte died in January 1885, barely a year after the move to the U.S. Sullivan's stepfather, Hutchinson, unable to cope with this loss and his responsibilities, soon returned to England, leaving the six surviving children (Edith had died) to be brought up mostly by their uncle William, with the financial support of their uncle Arthur.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, pp. 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1885, the family went on a sightseeing trip of the American West with their visiting uncle Arthur, who continued to support the family until his death in 1900 and in his will.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, pp. 14-23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career, marriage and children==
Sullivan directed at least 34 films, during the [[silent film|silent era]], between [[1913 in film|1913]] and [[1923 in film|1923]]. He also acted in at least 29 films between 1913 and [[1935 in film|1935]], including the [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', and he appeared on stage, including in several [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] shows, from 1905 to 1931.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=100612 "Frederick Sullivan"] at the IBDB database, accessed 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Sullivan married Kate Webb in 1902, and the couple had two daughters, Helen Mary (1906–1966) and Sheila (born 1919). Kate died in 1921, and Sullivan died in [[Los Angeles, California]] at the age of 65.&lt;ref&gt;[http://math.boisestate.edu/GaS/other_sullivan/genealogy/fred_r.pdf Genealogy record for Frederic Richard Sullivan], 1998, accessed 20 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hassan Jangju''' ({{lang-fa|حسن جنگجو}}; 1967–1984) was an Iranian [[Basij]]i during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] who became subject to an [[List of iconic photographs|iconic photograph]] taken by [[Alfred Yaghobzadeh]] in 1980.&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Spencer|title=Hassan "Jangju", boy soldier of the Iran-Iraq war, laid to rest at last|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/hassan-jangju-boy-soldier-of-the-iran-iraq-war-laid-to-rest-at-last-fb7t5zdmv|accessdate=9 September 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was missed in action in 1984, and his body was returned to Iran in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://iranwire.com/en/features/4817|title=Revolutionary Guards Deny Using Child Soldiers|date=14 September 2017|access-date=31 October 2017|work=IranWire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shot ==
In the photo, Jangju is crawling through muddy ground of the marshes in south of Iran while he is holding a rifle in ready state.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; The photograph became viral and was published in several media outlet both due to the special style of the soldier and it also attracted a lot of attention since the family name of the boy, "Jangju" meaning Warrior in Persian language was a good fit for the picture.&lt;ref name="Pars"&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran, dopo 37 anni trovato il corpo di un soldato|url=http://parstoday.com/it/news/iran-i112875-iran_dopo_37_anni_trovato_il_corpo_di_un_soldato|website=Pars Today|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=it-IT|date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alfred Yaghobzadeh]] was working for the Gamma and Associated Press news agencies at the time of capturing the famous photograph. The same photo used as a propaganda for recruiting volunteers by Iranian authorities during war time and afterwards.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

== Background ==
Jangju was a volunteer [[Basij]]i.&lt;ref name="Pars" /&gt; He was killed in February 1984 during [[Operation Kheibar]], part of the Battle of the Marshes, when Iran sent soldiers back over the Iraqi border, before they too became bogged down north of Basra.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt;

== Funeral and aftermath ==
The remains of his body was discovered and identified in the former Iran-Iraq war zone and sent back to Tabriz after 34 years on September 5, 2017. On September 6, 2017 the coffin of Hassan Jangju, which was draped in the Iranian flag, was borne through the streets by a huge crowd and laid to rest with full military honours. The ceremony for condolences to the Jangju's family was led by [[Ali Larijani]], speaker of the Iranian parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=مراسم تشییع پیکر شهید تازه شناسایی شده"حسن جنگجو" برگزار شد+تصاویر|url=http://tn.ai/1512409 |website=خبرگزاری تسنیم - Tasnim|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=مادر شهید جنگجو در روز تشییع پسرش دار فانی را وداع گفت|url=http://tn.ai/1512402 |website=خبرگزاری تسنیم - Tasnim|accessdate=10 September 2017|language=fa}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few hours after the funeral, his mother Jeyran Pourali died.&lt;ref name="Times" /&gt; Jangju's family described how the mother would lay out his clothes on a chair at the dinner table every evening, resembling his presence at home.

'''''Imaginary Conversations''''' is a publication consisting of five volumes of imaginary conversations, mainly between historical people of classical Greece and Rome, composed by the English author [[Walter Savage Landor]]. Landor's fame rests on this prose. The work is of great interest as a specimen of the poetic prose full of rich imagery &amp; ornate diction as seen in De Quincey.

==Background==
The Imaginary Conversations were begun when Landor, aged 46, was living with his family in [[Florence]] during 1821 where he had rooms in the Medici Palace and later rented the Villa Castigilione. The idea of the compositions began during his childhood as he wrote later: ''"When I was younger..[a]mong the chief pleasures of my life, and among the commonest of my occupations was the bringing before me such heroes and heroines of antiquity, such poets and sages, such of the prosperous and unfortunate as most interested me … Engaging them in conversations best suited to their characters..."''.&lt;ref&gt;H Van Thal ''Landor:a biographical anthology'' (1973)&lt;/ref&gt; The unenthusiastic reception of Landor's play “Count Julian” demonstrated that Landor, while adept at dialogue, lacked the dramatic capability necessary to convert it to stage performance, and he destroyed another tragedy “Ferranti and Giulio” in frustration at his publishers. 

At Florence, Landor was corresponding with [[Robert Southey]], who had planned to write a book of "Colloquies", and they considered collaborating on a project. Landor had finished fifteen dialogues by 9 March 1822, and sent them to [[Longman]]'s company.  Longman would not publish, so by the influence of his friend Julius Hare, he managed to get an agreement with the company of Taylor &amp; Hessey to publish them. Some disputes with the publishers followed in which both Southey and [[William Wordsworth]] became involved, not without some embarrassment to Southey as one of the "Conversations" was between Southey and Porson on the merits of Wordsworth's poetry. During 1824, two volumes were published with eighteen conversations in each. The third volume of Imaginary Conversations was published by Henry Colburn during 1828 but Julius Hare was frustrated by Colburn’s delays, and the fourth and fifth volumes were finally published by James Duncan during 1829. Over the succeeding years Landor published occasional Imaginary Conversations as individual publications and collated a number of them during 1853.

==[[Algernon Charles Swinburne]]'s Appraisal==
{{cquote|The very finest flower of his dialogues is probably to be found in the single volume  ''Imaginary Conversations of Greeks and Romans''; his command of passion and pathos may be tested by its success in the distilled and concentrated tragedy of ''Tiberius and Vipsania'', where for once he shows a quality more proper to romantic than classical imagination: the subtle and sublime and terrible power to enter the dark vestibule of distraction, to throw the whole force of his fancy, the whole fire of his spirit, into the shadowing passion (as Shakespeare calls it) of gradually imminent insanity. Yet, if this and all other studies from ancient history or legend could be subtracted from the volume of his work, enough would be left whereon to rest the foundation of a fame which time could not sensibly impair.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopædia Britannica 1882&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Interliterary mentions==
''Imaginary Conversations'' was a favorite book of the character ''Tibby'' in E.M. Forster's 1910 novel, ''[[Howards End]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Forster, E.M. ''Howards End''. Alfred A. Knopf, 2011, p. 11, {{ISBN|978-0-679-40668-6}} (US)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mentioned in the book and film &lt;i&gt;84 Charing Cross Road&lt;/i&gt; by Helene Hanff.

In "The Gay Science", Nietzsche praises Landor as a 'master of prose' for "Imaginary Conversations".

[[File:Battleofdorking.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Battle of Dorking'' (1871) triggered an explosion of invasion literature. Cover of a 1914 edition.]]

'''Invasion literature''' (or the '''invasion novel''') is a [[literary genre]] most notable between 1871 and the [[World War I|First World War]] (1914) but still practised to this day. The genre first became recognizable starting in [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] in 1871 with ''[[The Battle of Dorking]]'', a fictional account of an invasion of [[England]] by [[Germany]]. This short story was so popular it started a literary craze for tales that aroused imaginations and anxieties about hypothetical [[invasion]]s by foreign powers, and by 1914 the genre had amassed a corpus of over 400 books, many best-sellers, and a world-wide audience.&lt;ref name="reiss"&gt;{{Harvnb|Reiss|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was influential in Britain in shaping politics, national policies, and popular perceptions in the years leading up to the First World War, and remains a part of popular culture to this day. Several of the books were written by or ghostwritten for military officers and experts of the day who believed that the nation would be saved if the particular tactic that they favoured was or would be adopted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Echevarria |first=Antonio J. |title=Imagining Future War: The West's Technological Revolution and Visions of Wars to Come 1880–1914 |year=2007 |publisher=Prager Institute |location= |isbn=9780313051104 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-"Dorking"==

Nearly a century before the invasion literature genre became a true popular phenomenon after the publication of ''The Battle of Dorking'' in the 1870s, a mini-boom of invasion stories appeared soon after the French developed the [[hot-air balloon]]. Poems and plays that centred on armies of balloons invading England could be found in France, and even America. However, it was not until the Prussians used advanced technologies such as [[rifled breech-loader|breech-loading artillery]] and railroads to defeat the French in the [[1870 War]] that the fear of invasion by a technologically superior enemy became more realistic.

==In Europe==

''The Battle of Dorking'' (1871) by [[George Tomkyns Chesney]] first appeared in ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'', a respected [[Victorian era|Victorian]] political journal read by important British politicians.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick M Kirkwood, "The Impact of Fiction on Public Debate in Late Victorian Britain: The Battle of Dorking and the 'Lost Career' of Sir George Tomkyns Chesney," The Graduate History Review 4, No. 1 (Fall, 2012), 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; This [[short story]] describes the invasion of England by an unnamed enemy (who happen to speak [[German language|German]]), in which the narrator and 1,000 citizens defend the small English town of [[Dorking]], with no supplies or news of outside events. The story then moves forward in time 50 years and England is still devastated.

The author, like many of his countrymen at the time, was alarmed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]'s [[Franco-Prussian War|successful invasion of France]] in 1870, defeating Europe's largest army in only two months.&lt;ref name="reiss" /&gt; ''The Battle of Dorking'' was initially meant to shock readers into becoming more aware of the possible dangers of a foreign threat, but unwittingly created a new literary genre appealing to popular anxieties. The story was an immediate success, with one reviewer saying "We do not know that we ever saw anything better in any magazine... it describes exactly what we all feel."&lt;ref name="reiss" /&gt; It was so popular that the magazine was re-printed six times, a new pamphlet version was created, dozens of spoofs were created, and it was for sale throughout the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref name="reiss" /&gt; One [[running joke]] in England at the time was an injury, such as a bruise or scrape, being attributed to a wound received at the battle of Dorking.

Between the publication of ''The Battle of Dorking'' in 1871 and the start of the [[World War I|First World War]] in 1914 there were hundreds of authors writing invasion literature, often topping the best seller lists in Germany, [[France]], England and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="reiss" /&gt; During the period it is estimated over 400 invasion works were published. Probably the best known work was [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898), bearing plot similarities to ''The Battle of Dorking'' but with a [[science fiction theme]]. In 1907, Wells wrote ''[[The War in the Air]]'', a cautionary tale depicting purely human invasions: a German invasion of the US triggers off a worldwide chain of attacks and counter-attacks, leading to the destruction of all major cities and centers, the collapse of world economy, disintegration of all the fighting nations and the sinking of the world into new Middle Ages.

''[[Dracula]]'' (1897) also tapped into English fears of foreign forces arriving unopposed on its shores, although between 1870 and 1903 the majority of these works assumed that the enemy would be France, rather than Germany. This changed with the publication of [[Robert Erskine Childers|Erskine Childers]]'s 1903 novel ''[[The Riddle of the Sands]]''. Often called the first modern [[spy novel]], two men on a sailing holiday thwart a German invasion of England when they discover a secret fleet of invasion barges assembling on the German coast. Of these hundreds of authors, few are in print now. [[Saki]] is one of the exceptions, although his 1913 novel ''[[When William Came]]'' (subtitled "A Story of London Under the [[Hohenzollerns]]") is more [[jingoistic]] than literary. Another is [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|John Buchan]], whose novel ''[[The Thirty-Nine Steps]]'', published in 1915 but written just prior to the outbreak of World War I,  is a thriller dealing with German agents in Britain preparing for an invasion.

[[William Le Queux]] was the most prolific author of the genre; his first novel was ''[[The Great War in England in 1897]]'' (1894) and he went on to publish from one to twelve novels a year until his death in 1927. His work was regularly serialised in newspapers, particularly the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', and attracted many readers. It is believed{{By whom|date=April 2018}} [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[James Bond]] character was inspired by Le Queux's agent "Duckworth Drew". In some ways ''The Great War'' can be considered an antithesis to ''The Battle of Dorking'' – with the one ending for Britain in sombre and irrevocable defeat and decline, while in the other the invasion of [[London]] is pushed back in the last moment (with the help of [[Germany]], portrayed as a staunch ally against [[France]] and [[Russia]]), with enormous territorial aggrandizement (Britain gets [[Algeria]] and Russian [[Central Asia]]; "Britannia" becomes "Empress of the World").

Le Queux's most popular invasion novel was ''[[The Invasion of 1910]]'' (1906) which was translated into twenty-seven languages selling more than a million copies world-wide. Le Queux and his publisher changed the ending depending on the language, so in the German print edition the fatherland wins, while in the English edition the Germans lose. Le Queux was said to be [[Alexandra of Denmark|Queen Alexandra]]'s favorite author.

[[P. G. Wodehouse]] parodied the genre in ''[[The Swoop!]]'', in which England is simultaneously invaded by nine different armies, including Switzerland and Germany. English elites appear to be more interested in a cricket tournament, and the country is eventually saved by a boy scout named Clarence.

==In Asia==
Invasion literature had its impact also in [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], at the time undergoing a fast process of [[modernization]]. [[Shunrō Oshikawa]], a pioneer of Japanese [[science fiction]] and adventure stories (genres unknown in Japan until a few years earlier), published around the start of the 20th century the [[best-seller]] ''Kaitō Bōken Kidan: Kaitei Gunkan'' ("Undersea Battleship"): the story of an armoured,  [[ramming|ram]]-armed [[submarine]] involved in a [[future history]] of war between Japan and Russia. The novel reflected the [[imperialist]] ambitions of Japan at the time, and foreshadowed the [[Russo-Japanese War]] that followed a few years later, in 1904. When the actual war with Russia broke out, Oshikawa covered it as a journalist while also continuing to publish further volumes of fiction depicting Japanese imperial exploits set in the [[Pacific]] and [[Indian Ocean]] – which also proved an enormous success with the Japanese public. In a later career as a magazine editor, he also encouraged the writing of more fiction in the same vein by other Japanese authors.

Colonial [[Hong Kong]]'s earliest work of invasion literature is believed to have been the  1897 ''[[The Back Door (fiction)|The Back Door]]''. Published in serial form in a local English-language newspaper, it described a fictional French and Russian naval landing at [[Hong Kong Island]]'s [[Deep Water Bay]]; the story was intended to criticise the lack of [[British Empire|British]] funding for [[British Forces Overseas Hong Kong|the defence of Hong Kong]], and it is speculated that members of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] may have read the book in preparation for the 1941 [[Battle of Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bickley|first=Gillian| isbn = 962-209-526-7 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press|location=Hong Kong, China|title=Hong Kong Invaded!

One of the earliest stories to appear in print in the U.S. was "The Stricken Nation" by [[Henry Grattan Donnelly]] published in 1890 in New York. It tells of a successful British invasion of the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tales of the next great war |editor1-first=I. F. |editor1-last=Clarke |publisher=Syracuse University Press |year=1995 |isbn=081562672X }}&lt;/ref&gt; The move of American public opinion towards participation in [[World War I]] was reflected in ''Uncle Sam's Boys at The Invasion of the United States'' by [[H. Irving Hancock]]. This four-book series, published by the [[Henry Altemus Company]] in 1916, depicts a German invasion of the U.S. in 1920–1921. The plot seems to transfer the main story line of Le Queux's ''The Great War'' (with which the writer may have been familiar) to an American theatre: the Germans launch a surprise attack, capture [[Boston]] despite heroic resistance by "Uncle Sam's boys", overrun all of [[New England]] and [[New York (state)|New York]] and reach as far as [[Pittsburgh]] – but at last are gloriously crushed by fresh American forces.

==In Australia==

Australia's contribution to invasion literature was set against the background of pre-[[Federation of Australia|Federation]] colonial fears of the "[[Yellow Peril]]" and the foundations of the [[White Australia policy]]. From the late 1880s through to the beginning of World War I, this fear was expressed in Australia through cartoons, poems, plays and novels. Three of the most well known of these novels were ''White or Yellow? A Story of the Race War of AD 1908'' (1888) by journalist [[William Lane]], ''The Yellow Wave'' (1895) by Kenneth Mackay and ''The Australian Crisis'' (1909) by Charles H. Kirmess (possibly a pseudonym for another Australian author Frank Fox). Each of these novels contained two major common themes which were a reflection of the fears and concerns within a contemporary Australian context; the Australian continent was at risk of major invasion from a strong Asian power (ie. China or Japan, sometimes with the assistance of the Russian Empire) and that the United Kingdom was apathetic towards the protection of its faraway colonies, and would not come to Australia's aid when needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Australia and the Wider World: Selected Essays of Neville Meaney |editor1-first=James |editor1-last=Curran |editor2-first=Stuart |editor2-last=Ward |publisher=Sydney University Press |year=2013 |isbn=9781743320259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After World War I==

The "[[First Red Scare]]" following [[World War I]] produced [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]'s ''[[The Moon Maid|The Moon Men]]'' (1925), a depiction of Earth (and specifically, the United States) under the rule of cruel invaders from the [[Moon]]. This book is known to have been originally written as ''Under the Red Flag'', an explicit [[anti-Communist]] novel, and when rejected by the publishers in that form it was successfully "recycled" by Burroughs as science fiction.

[[Ivan Petrushevich]]'s "[[The Flying Submarine]]" (1922), depicted an invasion of The United Kingdom by Soviet forces after most of Europe and Asia had fallen to communism. The story features the British fleet being destroyed by a swarm of insect-like single pilot submarines which can emerge from the water to attack their foes.  

[[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[Sixth Column]]'' (1941) told the story of the invasion and conquest of the United States by the technologically advanced PanAsians, and the subsequent guerrilla struggle to overthrow them with even more advanced technology.

==After World War II==

Fears of Communist invasion became even more pronounced in books like [[Robert A. Heinlein]]'s ''[[The Puppet Masters]]'' (1951) and films like ''[[Invasion U.S.A. (1952 film)|Invasion USA]]'' (1953) and a Department of Defense information film released to the general public ''[[Red Nightmare]]'' (1957). A more explicit Soviet invasion and occupation is depicted in [[Jerry Sohl]]'s'' [[Point Ultimate]]'' (1955) – where the United States lies prostrate under cruel and degenerate Soviet occupiers, helped by "Commie" American collaborators – but a band of undaunted rebels manage the improbable feat of launching an extensive space program under the Soviets' noses, colonising [[Mars]] and using it as a base of operations. Similar themes were continued in the 1980s with the film ''[[Red Dawn]]'' (1984) and TV miniseries ''[[Amerika (TV miniseries)|Amerika]]'' (1987).

During the 1960s, the enemy was changed from the Soviet Union to [[China|Red China]] where China was shown as behind plots to destroy the American economy with a nuclear weapon in ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964), instigating a war between the USA and USSR in ''[[You Only Live Twice (film)|You Only Live Twice]]'' and invading the United States from tunnels dug beneath the ocean in ''[[Battle Beneath the Earth]]'' (1967).

In 1971, when realization of losing the [[Vietnam War]] was sinking into the American consciousness, two books appeared almost simultaneously, both depicting a United States under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] occupation. In ''[[Vandenberg (novel)|Vandenberg]]'' by [[Oliver Lange]] – written, like "Dorking", as a cautionary tale – most Americans accept Soviet overlordship without much protest, the only resistance coming from a group of oddballs in a corner of [[New Mexico]]. In contrast, in [[John Ball (American author)|John Ball]]'s ''[[The First Team (novel)|The First Team]]'' – as in "The Great War" – a seemingly hopeless situation is retrieved by a band of courageous patriots with the book ending on a note of uplifting liberation. The ''[[Amerika (miniseries)|Amerika]]'' TV miniseries, depicting a Soviet-occupied US, was aired in 1987 - a time when [[Gorbachev]]'s [[Perestroika]] already rendered its theme highly implausible.  

The [[Tomorrow series|''Tomorrow'' series]] by [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]], published between 1993 and 1999, detail an invasion of [[Australia]] by an unnamed country from the perspective of a band of teenage [[Guerrilla warfare|guerillas]].

==Political impact==
Stories of a planned German invasion rose to increasing political prominence from 1906. Taking their inspiration from the stories of Le Queux and Childers, hundreds of ordinary citizens began to suspect foreigners of espionage. This trend was accentuated by Le Queux, who collected 'sightings' brought to his attention by readers and raised them through his association with the Daily Mail. Subsequent research has since shown that no significant German espionage network existed in Britain at this time. Claims about the scale of German invasion preparations grew increasingly ambitious. The number of German spies was put at between 60,000 and 300,000 (in spite of the total German community in Britain being no more than 44,000&amp;nbsp;people). It was alleged that thousands of rifles were being stockpiled by German spies in order to arm saboteurs at the outbreak of war.

Calls for government action grew ever more intense, and in 1909 it was given as the reason for the secret foundation of the [[Secret Service Bureau]], the forerunner of [[MI5]] and [[MI6]]. Historians today debate whether this was in fact the real reason, but in any case the concerns raised in invasion literature came to define the early duties of the Bureau's Home Section. [[Vernon Kell]], the section head, remained obsessed with the location of these saboteurs, focusing his operational plans both before and during the war on defeating the saboteurs imagined by Le Queux.

Invasion literature was not without detractors; policy experts in the years preceding the First World War said invasion literature risked inciting war between England and Germany and France. Critics such as [[Prime Minister]] [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] denounced Le Queux's ''[[The Invasion of 1910]]'' as "calculated to inflame public opinion abroad and alarm the more ignorant public at home."&lt;ref name="reiss" /&gt;  Journalist [[Charles Lowe (journalist)|Charles Lowe]] wrote in 1910: "Among all the causes contributing to the continuance of a state of bad blood between England and Germany perhaps the most potent is the baneful industry of those unscrupulous writers who are forever asserting that the Germans are only awaiting a fitting opportunity to attack us in our island home and burst us up."&lt;ref name="reiss" /&gt;

[[Baron]] '''Giulio Cesare Andrea Evola''' ({{IPAc-en|ɛ|ˈ|v|oʊ|l|ə}}; {{IPA-it|ˈɛːvola|lang}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |article=Evola cogn. |publisher=[[Rai Libri]] |encyclopedia=Dizionario d'Ortografia e di Pronunzia (DOP)  |url=http://www.dizionario.rai.it/poplemma.aspx?lid=61429&amp;r=90351 |accessdate=2018-10-23 &lt;!--Feb 13 2017--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; 19 May 1898 – 11 June 1974), better known as '''Julius Evola''', was an Italian [[philosopher]], painter, and [[Western esotericism|esotericist]]. He has been described as a "fascist intellectual,"&lt;ref&gt;Cyprian Blamires. ''World Fascism: a historical encyclopedia, vol 1''. ABC-CLIO, 2006. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; a "radical traditionalist,"&lt;ref name="packer2009"&gt;{{cite book |last=Packer |first=Jeremy |title=Secret agents popular icons beyond James Bond |location=New York |publisher=Lang |year=2009 |page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt; "antiegalitarian, antiliberal, antidemocratic, and antipopular,"&lt;ref name="Atkins, Stephen E. 2004. p 89"&gt;Atkins, Stephen E. Encyclopedia of modern worldwide extremists and extremist groups. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004. p 89.&lt;/ref&gt; and as having been "the leading philosopher of Europe's neofascist movement."&lt;ref name="Atkins, Stephen E. 2004. p 89"/&gt;

Evola is popular in fringe circles, largely because of his extreme metaphysical, magical, and supernatural beliefs (including belief in ghosts, telepathy, and alchemy),&lt;ref&gt;Horrox, James. "Julius Evola". The Literary Encyclopedia. First published 20 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and his extreme [[Traditionalist conservatism|traditionalism]] and [[misogyny]]. He himself termed his philosophy "magical idealism." Many of Evola's theories and writings were centered on his idiosyncratic [[mysticism]], [[occultism]], and esoteric religious studies,&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=occult/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;  and this aspect of his work has influenced [[occult]]ists and esotericists. Evola also justified rape (among other forms of male domination of women) because he saw it "as a natural expression of male desire". This misogynistic outlook stemmed from his extreme right views on [[gender role]]s, which demanded absolute submission from women.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name=occult/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;&lt;ref name=Merelli/&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz /&gt;

According to the scholar Franco Ferraresi, "Evola's thought can be considered one of the most radical and consistent anti-egalitarian, [[Liberalism#Criticism and support|anti-liberal]], [[criticism of democracy|anti-democratic]], and anti-popular systems in the twentieth century. It is a singular (though not necessarily original) blend of several schools and traditions, including [[German idealism]], Eastern doctrines, traditionalism, and the all-embracing ''[[world view|Weltanschauung]]'' of the interwar [[conservative revolutionary movement]] with which Evola had a deep personal involvement".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Franco Ferraresi|title=Threats to Democracy: The Radical Right in Italy after the War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0DG3uk9o8oC&amp;pg=PA44|year=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=1-4008-2211-4|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Aaron Gillette described Evola as "one of the most influential fascist racists in Italian history".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillette|first=Aaron|authorlink=Aaron Gillette|title=Racial Theories in Fascist Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Gjq0ZPvIZgC|year=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-52706-9|chapter=7: Julia Evola and spiritual Nordicism, 1941-1943}}&lt;/ref&gt; He admired SS head [[Heinrich Himmler]], whom he once met.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola spent [[World War II]] working for the ''[[Sicherheitsdienst]]''.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; During his trial in 1951, Evola denied being a fascist and instead referred to himself as a "superfascist". Concerning this statement, historian Elisabetta Cassina Wolff wrote that "It is unclear whether this meant that Evola was placing himself above or beyond Fascism".&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;

==Life==
Giulio Cesare Andrea Evola was born in Rome to a minor aristocratic family of Sicilian origins. He was a [[baron]]. Little is known about his early upbringing except that he considered it irrelevant. Evola studied engineering in Rome, but did not complete his studies because he "did not want to be associated in any way with [[bourgeois]] academic recognition and titles such as doctor and engineer."&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"&gt;Paul Furlong, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fVGkhzpXxLkC The Social and Political Thought of Julius Evola]''. London: Routledge, 2011. {{ISBN|9780203816912}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="Evola, Cinabro"&gt;Julius Evola, Il Camino del Cinabro, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

In his teenage years, Evola immersed himself in painting—which he considered one of his natural talents—and literature, including [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]]. He was introduced to philosophers such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Otto Weininger]]. Other early philosophical influences included [[Carlo Michelstaedter]] and [[Max Stirner]].&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. ''Fascism: Post-war fascisms''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004. p. 219&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola served in [[World War I]] as an [[artillery]] officer on the [[Asiago]] plateau. He was attracted to the [[avant-garde]] and after the war, Evola briefly associated with [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]'s [[Futurism|Futurist]] movement. He became a prominent representative of [[Dada]]ism in Italy through his painting, poetry, and collaboration on the briefly published journal, ''Revue Bleue''. In 1922, after concluding that avant-garde art was becoming [[commercialized]] and stiffened by academic conventions, he reduced his focus on artistic expression such as painting and poetry.&lt;ref&gt;G.Evola, ''Il Camino del Cinabro'', 1963&lt;/ref&gt;{{primary inline|date=July 2017}}

Evola died on 11 June 1974 in Rome.&lt;ref name="treccani"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author=Luca Lo Bianco |language=it |title=EVOLA, Giulio Cesare Andrea |encyclopedia=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani |trans-title=Biographical Dictionary of Italians |volume=43 |year=1993 |publisher=Treccani |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giulio-cesare-andrea-evola_(Dizionario-Biografico) |accessdate=2018-10-23 |quote=Morì a Roma l'11 giugno 1974 e le ceneri, per sua volontà, furono sepolte sul Monte Rosa.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{how|date=June 2018}}

==Works==

===Christianity===
In 1928, Evola wrote an attack on Christianity titled ''Pagan Imperialism'', which proposed transforming fascism into a system consistent with ancient Roman values and the ancient mystery traditions. Evola proposed that fascism should be a vehicle for reinstating the caste system and aristocracy of antiquity. Although Evola invoked the term "fascism" in this text, his diatribe against the Catholic Church was criticized by both the fascist regime and the Vatican itself. [[A. James Gregor]] argued that the text was an attack on fascism as it stood at the time of writing, but noted that [[Benito Mussolini]] made use of it in order to threaten the Vatican with the possibility of an "anti-clerical fascism".&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name=gregor2006&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gregor|first1=A. James|authorlink1=A. James Gregor|title=The search for neofascism : the use and abuse of social science|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0521676397}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|89–91}} On account of Evola's sentiment, the Vatican-backed right wing Catholic journal ''Revue Internationale des Sociétés Secrètes'' published an article in April 1928 entitled "Un Sataniste Italien: Julius Evola."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

''The Mystery of the Grail'' discarded Christian interpretations of the [[Holy Grail]]. Evola wrote that the Grail "symbolizes the principle of an immortalizing and transcendent force connected to the primordial state ... The mystery of the Grail is a mystery of a warrior initiation." He held that the Ghibellines, who fought the Guelph for control of Northern and Central Italy in the thirteenth century, had within them the residual influences of pre-Christian Celtic and Nordic traditions that represented his conception of the Grail myth. He also held that the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines|Guelph victory against the Ghibellines]] represented a regression of the castes, since the merchant caste took over from the warrior caste.&lt;ref name=Sedgwick/&gt; In the epilogue to this text, Evola argued that the fictitious ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', regardless of whether it was authentic or not, was a cogent representation of modernity.&lt;ref name=Barber&gt;Richard W. Barber. ''The Holy Grail: Imagination and Belief''. Harvard University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Richard Barber]] said, "Evola mixes rhetoric, prejudice, scholarship, and politics into a strange version of the present and future, but in the process he brings together for the first time interest in the esoteric and in conspiracy theory which characterize much of the later Grail literature."&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt;

===Buddhism===
In ''The Doctrine of Awakening'', Evola argued that the [[Pāli Canon]] could be held to represent true [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name=forum/&gt; His interpretation of Buddhism is that it was intended to be anti-democratic. He believed that Buddhism revealed the essence of an "Aryan" tradition that had become corrupted and lost in the West. He believed it could be interpreted to reveal the superiority of a warrior caste.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt; [[Harry Oldmeadow]] described Evola's work on Buddhism as exhibiting Nietzschean influence,&lt;ref&gt;Harry Oldmeadow. ''Journeys East: 20th Century Western Encounters with Eastern Religious Traditions''. World Wisdom, Inc, 2004. p. 369&lt;/ref&gt; but Evola criticized Nietzsche's anti-ascetic prejudice.&lt;ref name=forum&gt;T. Skorupski. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=yYSAAAAAQBAJ The Buddhist Forum, Volume 4]''. Routledge, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The book "received the official approbation of the Pāli [text] society", and was published by a reputable Orientalist publisher.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt; Evola's interpretation of Buddhism, as put forth in his article "Spiritual Virility in Buddhism", is in conflict with the post-WWII scholarship of the Orientalist [[Giuseppe Tucci]], which argues that the viewpoint that Buddhism advocates universal benevolence is legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;Donald S. Lopez. ''Curators of the Buddha: The Study of Buddhism Under Colonialism''. University of Chicago Press, 1995. p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arthur Versluis]] stated that Evola's writing on Buddhism was a vehicle for his own theories, but was a far from accurate rendition of the subject, and he held that much the same could be said of Evola's writing on Hermeticism.&lt;ref name=Versluis&gt;Arthur Versluis. ''Magic and Mysticism: An Introduction to Western Esoteric Traditions''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2007. p. 144-145&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nanavira Thera|Ñāṇavīra Thera]] was inspired to become a [[bhikkhu]] from reading Evola's text ''The Doctrine of Awakening'' in 1945 while hospitalized in [[Sorrento]].&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;

===Modernity===
Evola's ''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]'' is a text that promotes the mythology of an ancient [[Golden Age]]. In this work, Evola described the features of his idealized traditional society. Evola argued that modernity represented a serious decline from an ideal society. He argued that in the postulated Golden age, religious and temporal power were united. He wrote that society had not been founded on priestly rule, but by warriors expressing spiritual power. In mythology, he saw evidence of the West's superiority over the East. Moreover, he claimed that the traditional elite had the ability to access power and knowledge through a hierarchical version of magic which differed from the lower "superstitious and fraudulent" forms of magic.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Evola insists on "nonmodern forms, institutions, and knowledge" as being necessary to produce a "real renewal ... in those who are still capable of receiving it."&lt;ref name=Versluis/&gt; The text was "immediately recognized by [[Mircea Eliade]] and other intellectuals who allegedly advanced ideas associated with Tradition."&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; Eliade, one of Evola's closest friends, was a fascist sympathizer associated with the Romanian fascist [[Iron Guard]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola was aware of the importance of myth from his readings of [[Georges Sorel]], one of the key intellectual influences on fascism.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; [[Hermann Hesse]] described ''Revolt Against the Modern World'' as "really dangerous."&lt;ref name=Sedgwick&gt;Mark Sedgwick. ''Against the Modern World: Traditionalism and the Secret Intellectual History of the Twentieth Century''. Oxford University Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

E. C. Wolff noted that in ''Ride the Tiger'' "Evola argued that the fight against modernity was lost. The only thing a 'real man' could just do was to ride the tiger of modernity patiently". Evola wrote that the events of the period would have to run their course but he "did not exclude the possibility of action in the future." He argued that one should be ready to intervene when the tiger "is tired of running."&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; Goodrick-Clarke notes that, "Evola sets up the ideal of the 'active nihilist' who is prepared to act with violence against modern decadence."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; According to European Studies professor Paul Furlong, this text presents Evola's view that the potential "elite" should immunize itself from modernity and use "right wing anarchism" to rebel against it.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

===Other writings===
In the posthumously published collection of writings, ''Metaphysics of War'', Evola, in line with the conservative revolutionary [[Ernst Jünger]], explored the viewpoint that war could be a spiritually fulfilling experience. He proposed the necessity of a transcendental orientation in a warrior.&lt;ref&gt;Lennart Svensson. ''Ernst Junger – A Portrait''. Manticore Books, 2016. p. 202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]] has written that Evola's 1945 essay "American 'Civilization'" described the United States as "the final stage of European decline into the 'interior formlessness' of vacuous individualism, conformity and vulgarity under the universal [[aegis]] of money-making." According to Goodrick-Clarke, Evola argued that U.S. "mechanistic and rational philosophy of progress combined with a mundane horizon of prosperity to transform the world into an enormous suburban shopping mall."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Occultism and esotericism==
Around 1920, Evola's interests led him into [[spirituality|spiritual]], [[transcendence (religion)|transcendental]], and "supra-rational" studies. He began reading various esoteric texts and gradually delved deeper into the occult, [[alchemy]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]], and [[Oriental studies]], particularly [[Vajrayana|Tibetan Tantric]] [[yoga]]. A keen mountaineer, Evola described the experience as a source of revelatory spiritual experiences. After his return from the war, Evola experimented with [[hallucinogen]]s and magic.

When he was about 23 years old, Evola considered suicide. He claimed that he avoided suicide thanks to a revelation he had while reading an early Buddhist text that dealt with shedding all forms of identity other than absolute transcendence.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Evola would later publish the text ''The Doctrine of Awakening'', which he regarded as a repayment of his debt to [[Buddhism]] for saving him from suicide.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;

Evola wrote prodigiously on Eastern mysticism, Tantra, [[hermeticism]], the myth of the Holy Grail and Western esotericism.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; German Egyptologist and esoteric scholar Florian Ebeling has noted that Evola's ''The Hermetic Tradition'' is viewed as an "extremely important work on Hermeticism" in the eyes of esotericists.&lt;ref&gt;Florian Ebeling. ''The Secret History of Hermes Trismegistus: Hermeticism from Ancient to Modern Times''. Cornell University Press, 2007. p. 138&lt;/ref&gt; Evola gave particular focus to Cesare della Riviera's text ''Il Mondo Magico degli Heroi'', which he later republished in modern Italian. He held that Riviera's text was consonant with the goals of "high magic" – the reshaping of the earthly human into a transcendental 'god man'. According to Evola, the alleged "timeless" Traditional science was able to come to lucid expression through this text, in spite of the "coverings" added to it to prevent accusations from the church.&lt;ref name=Hermeticism/&gt; Though Evola rejected [[Carl Jung]]'s interpretation of alchemy, Jung described Evola's ''The Hermetic Tradition'' as a "magisterial account of Hermetic philosophy".&lt;ref name=Hermeticism&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=rNOYDQAAQBAJ Lux in Tenebris: The Visual and the Symbolic in Western Esotericism]''. BRILL, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition'', the philosopher Glenn Alexander Magee favored Evola's interpretation over that of Jung's.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Alexander Magee. ''Hegel and the Hermetic Tradition''. Cornell University Press, 2008. p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, a journal devoted to Hermetic thought published a section of Evola's book and described it as "Luciferian."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Evola later confessed that he was not a Buddhist, and that his text on Buddhism was meant to balance his earlier work on the Hindu ''tantras''.&lt;ref name=forum/&gt; Evola's interest in [[tantra]] was spurred on by correspondence with [[John Woodroffe]].&lt;ref name="Gary Lachman 2012. p. 215"/&gt; Evola was attracted to the active aspect of tantra, and its claim to provide a practical means to spiritual experience, over the more "passive" approaches in other forms of Eastern spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Taylor. ''Sir John Woodroffe, Tantra and Bengal: 'An Indian Soul in a European Body?' ''. Routledge, 2012. p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Tantric Buddhism in East Asia'', Richard K. Payne, Dean of the Institute of Buddhist Studies, argued that Evola manipulated Tantra in the service of right wing violence, and that the emphasis on "power" in ''The Yoga of Power'' gave insight into his mentality.&lt;ref&gt;Richard K. Payne. ''Tantric Buddhism in East Asia''. Simon and Schuster, 2006. p. 229&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola advocated that "differentiated individuals" following the [[Left-hand path and right-hand path#Left-Hand Path|Left-Hand Path]] use dark violent sexual powers against the modern world. For Evola, these "virile heroes" are both generous and cruel, possess the ability to rule, and commit "Dionysian" acts that might be seen as conventionally immoral. For Evola, the Left Hand path embraces violence as a means of transgression.&lt;ref name=occult/&gt;{{rp|217}}

According to [[A. James Gregor]] Evola's definition of spirituality can be found in ''Meditations on the Peaks'': "what has been successfully actualized and translated into a sense of superiority which is experienced inside by the soul, and a noble demeanor, which is expressed in the body."&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|101–102}} Goodrick-Clarke wrote that Evola's "rigorous [[New Age]] spirituality speaks directly to those who reject absolutely the leveling world of democracy, capitalism, multi-racialism and technology at the outset of the twenty-first century. Their acute sense of cultural chaos can find powerful relief in his ideal of total renewal."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Thomas Sheehan (academic)|Thomas Sheehan]] wrote that to "read Evola is to take a trip through a weird and fascinating jungle of ancient mythologies, pseudo-ethnology, and transcendental mysticism that is enough to make any southern California consciousness-tripper feel quite at home."&lt;ref name=sheehanterror&gt;Thomas Sheehan. [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/7178 Italy: Terror on the Right]. ''The New York Review of Books'', Volume 27, Number 21 &amp; 22, January 22, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magical idealism===
[[Thomas Sheehan (academic)|Thomas Sheehan]] wrote that "Evola's first philosophical works from the 'twenties were dedicated to reshaping neo-idealism from a philosophy of Absolute Spirit and Mind into a philosophy of the "absolute individual" and action."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; Accordingly, Evola developed the doctrine of "[[magical idealism]]", which held that "the Ego must understand that everything that seems to have a reality independent of it is nothing but an illusion, caused by its own deficiency."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; For Evola, this ever-increasing unity with the "absolute individual" was consistent with unconstrained liberty, and therefore unconditional power.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; In his 1925 work ''Essays on Magical Idealism'', Evola declared that "God does not exist. The Ego must create him by making itself divine."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt;

According to Sheehan, Evola discovered the power of metaphysical mythology while developing his theories. This led to his advocacy of supra-rational intellectual intuition over discursive knowledge. In Evola's view, discursive knowledge separates man from Being.&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; Sheehan stated that this position is a theme in certain interpretations of Western philosophers such as [[Plato]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[Martin Heidegger]] that was exaggerated by Evola.&lt;ref name=Sheehan&gt;Thomas Sheehan. ''Myth and Violence: The Fascism of Julius Evola and Alain de Benoist''. Social Research, XLVIII, 1 (Spring, 1981). 45–73&lt;/ref&gt; Evola would later write:

{{quote|The truths that allow us to understand the world of Tradition are not those that can be "learned" or "discussed." They either are or are not. We can only ''remember'' them, and that happens when we are freed from the obstacles represented by various human constructions (chief among these are the results and methods of the authorized "researchers") and have awakened the capacity to ''see'' from the nonhuman viewpoint, which is the same as the Traditional viewpoint ... Traditional truths have always been held to be essentially ''non-human''.&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt;}}

Evola developed a doctrine of the "two natures": the natural world and the primordial "world of 'Being'". He believed that these "two natures" impose form and quality on lower matter and create a hierarchical "great chain of Being."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; He understood "spiritual virility" as signifying orientation towards this postulated transcendent principle.&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt; He held that the State should reflect this "ordering from above" and the consequent hierarchical differentiation of individuals according to their "organic preformation". By "organic preformation" he meant that which "gathers, preserves, and refines one's talents and qualifications for determinate functions."&lt;ref name=Sheehan/&gt;

===Ur Group===
Evola was introduced to esotericism by [[Arturo Reghini]], who was an early supporter of fascism. Reghini sought to promote a "cultured magic" opposed to Christianity and introduced Evola to the traditionalist [[René Guénon]]. In 1927, Reghini and Evola, along with other Italian esotericists, founded the ''Gruppo di Ur'' ("[[Ur]] Group").&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; The purpose of this group was to attempt to bring the members' individual identities into such a superhuman state of power and awareness that they would be able to exert a magical influence on the world. The group employed techniques from Buddhist, Tantric, and rare Hermetic texts.&lt;ref&gt;Nevill Drury. ''The Dictionary of the Esoteric: 3000 Entries on the Mystical and Occult Traditions''. Motilal Banarsidass Publ., 2004. p. 96&lt;/ref&gt; They aimed to provide a "soul" to the burgeoning Fascist movement of the time through the revival of [[religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], and to influence the fascist regime through esotericism.&lt;ref&gt;Isotta Poggi. "Alternative Spirituality in Italy." In: James R. Lewis, J. Gordon Melton. ''Perspectives on the New Age.'' SUNY Press, 1992. Page 276.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

Articles on occultism from the Ur Group were later published in ''Introduction to Magic''.&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|89}}&lt;ref name="Gary Lachman 2012. p. 215"&gt;Gary Lachman. ''Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen''. Quest Books, 2012. p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; Reghini's support of [[Freemasonry]] would however prove a bone of contention for Evola; accordingly, Evola broke with Reghini in 1928.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Reghini himself broke from Evola, accusing Evola of plagiarizing his thoughts in the book ''Pagan Imperialism''.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola, on the other hand, blamed Reghini for the premature publication of ''Pagan Imperialism''.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Evola's later work owed a considerable debt to René Guénon's text ''Crisis of the Modern World'',&lt;ref name=Versluis/&gt; though he diverged from Guénon on the issue of the relationship between warriors and priests.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

===Views on sex and gender roles===
Julius Evola believed that the alleged higher qualities expected of a man of a particular race were not those expected of a woman of the same race. He held that "just relations between the sexes" involved women acknowledging their "inequality" with men.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; In 1925, he wrote an article titled ''"La donna come cosa"'' ("Woman as Thing").&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; Evola later quoted [[Joseph de Maistre]]'s statement that "Woman cannot be superior except as woman, but from the moment in which she desires to emulate man she is nothing but a monkey."&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. ''Fascism: Post-war fascisms''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004. p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Evola believed that [[women's liberation movement|women's liberation]] was "the renunciation by woman of her right to be a woman".&lt;ref&gt;Franco Ferraresi. ''Threats to Democracy: The Radical Right in Italy after the War''. Princeton University Press, 2012. p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; A woman "could traditionally participate in the sacred hierarchical order only in a mediated fashion through her relationship with a man."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; He held, as a feature of his idealized gender relations, the Hindu [[sati (practice)|sati]], which for him was a form of sacrifice indicating women's respect for patriarchal traditions.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ben-Ghiat, M. Fuller. ''Italian Colonialism''. Springer, 2016. p. 149&lt;/ref&gt; For the "pure, feminine" woman, "man is not perceived by her as a mere husband or lover, but as her lord."&lt;ref name=Merelli/&gt; Women would find their true identity in total subjugation to men.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Evola regarded matriarchy and goddess religions as a symptom of decadence, and preferred a hyper-masculine, warrior ethos.&lt;ref&gt;J. Gordon Melton, Martin Baumann. ''Religions of the World: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices, 2nd Edition [6 volumes]: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices''. ABC-CLIO, 2010. p. 1085&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola was influenced by [[Hans Blüher]]; he was a proponent of the ''[[Secret society#Characteristics|Männerbund]]'' concept as a model for his proposed ultra-fascist "Order".&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Goodrick-Clarke noted the fundamental influence of [[Otto Weininger]]'s misogynist book ''[[Sex and Character]]'' on Evola's dualism of male-female spirituality. According to Goodrich-Clarke, "Evola's celebration of virile spirituality was rooted in Weininger's work, which was widely translated by the end of the First World War."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Unlike Weininger, Evola believed that women needed to be conquered, not ignored.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola denounced [[homosexuality]] as "useless" for his purposes. He did not neglect [[sadomasochism]], so long as sadism and masochism "are magnifications of an element potentially present in the deepest essence of [[eros]]."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Then, it would be possible to "extend, in a transcendental and perhaps [[ecstasy (emotion)|ecstatic]] way, the possibilities of sex."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Evola held that women "played" with men, threatened their masculinity, and lured them into a "constrictive" grasp with their sexuality.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002" /&gt; He wrote that "It should not be expected of women that they return to what they really are ... when men themselves retain only the semblance of true virility",&lt;ref name=Merelli/&gt; and lamented that "men instead of being in control of sex are controlled by it and wander about like drunkards".&lt;ref name=occult/&gt; He believed that in Tantra and in [[sex magic]], in which he saw a strategy for aggression, he found the means to counter the "emasculated" West.&lt;ref name=occult&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Lycourinos|editor1-first=Damon Zacharias|title=Occult traditions|date=2012|publisher=Numen Books|isbn=9780987158130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IOG3fu3dss4C|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=haaretz&gt;{{cite news |last1=Arad |first1=Roy |title=How an Israeli Bookstore in Berlin Ended Up Accused of Nazi Recruitment |url=https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium.MAGAZINE-how-an-israeli-bookshop-in-berlin-ended-up-accused-of-nazi-recruitment-1.6053918 |accessdate=July 23, 2018 |work=Haaretz |date=May 3, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Annalisa Merelli, Evola "went so far as to justify rape" because he saw it "as a natural expression of male desire".&lt;ref name=Merelli/&gt; Evola also said that the "ritual violation of virgins",&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; and "whipping women" were a means of "consciousness raising",&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; so long as these practices were done to the intensity required to produce the proper "liminal psychic climate".&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; He wrote that "as a rule, nothing stirs a man more than feeling the woman utterly exhausted beneath his own hostile rapture."&lt;ref name=Merelli&gt;Annalisa Merelli. "[https://qz.com/909323/bannons-interest-for-julius-evola-unveils-the-sexism-at-the-core-of-trump/ Steve Bannon’s interest in a thinker who inspired fascism exposes the misogyny of the alt-right]". [[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]. February 22, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola translated Weininger's ''Sex and Character'' into Italian. Dissatisfied with simply translating Weininger's work, he wrote the text ''Eros and the Mysteries of Love: The Metaphysics of Sex'', where his views on sexuality were dealt with at length.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; [[Arthur Versluis]] described this text as Evola's "most interesting" work aside from ''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]''.&lt;ref name=Versluis/&gt; This book remains popular among many New Age adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conner |first1=Randy P. |last2=Sparks |first2=David Hatfield |last3=Sparks |first3=Mariya |date=1997 |title=Cassell's Encyclopedia of Queer Myth, Symbol, and Spirit: Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Lore |publisher=Cassell |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on race==
{{anchor|Race}}
Evola's dissent from standard biological concepts of race had roots in his aristocratic elitism, since Nazi ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'' ideology inadequately separated aristocracy from "commoners."&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; According to Furlong, Evola developed "the law of the regression of castes" in ''[[Revolt Against the Modern World]]'' and other writings on racism from the 1930s and World War II period. In Evola's view "power and civilization have progressed from one to another of the four castes—sacred leaders, warrior nobility, bourgeoisie (economy, 'merchants') and slaves".&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Furlong explains: "for Evola, the core of racial superiority lay in the spiritual qualities of the higher castes, which expressed themselves in physical as well as in cultural features, but were not determined by them. The law of the regression of castes places racism at the core of Evola's philosophy, since he sees an increasing predominance of lower races as directly expressed through modern mass democracies."&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

In 1941, Evola's book ''Synthesis of the Doctrine of Race'' (Italian: ''Sintesi di Dottrina della Razza'') was published by [[Hoepli]]. It provides an overview of his ideas concerning race and [[eugenics]], introducing the concept of "spiritual racism",&lt;ref name="Rota2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rota|title=Intellettuali, dittatura, razzismo di stato|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGwiln0yQC4C&amp;pg=PA57|year=2008|publisher=FrancoAngeli|isbn=978-88-568-2094-2|pages=57–}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "esoteric-traditionalist racism".&lt;ref name=cassata&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassata|first=Francisco|title=Building the New Man: Eugenics, Racial Science and Genetics in Twentieth-century Italy|publisher=Central European University Press|year=2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rZKPeD6CyAC&amp;pg=PA264&amp;lpg=PA264&amp;dq=%22Sintesi+di+Dottrina+della+Razza%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the end of War, Evola had frequently used the term "Aryan" to mean the nobility, who in his view were imbued with traditional spirituality.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Wolff notes that Evola seems to have stopped writing about race in 1945, but adds that the intellectual themes of Evola's writings were otherwise unchanged. Evola continued to write about elitism and his contempt for the weak. His "doctrine of the Aryan-Roman 'super-race was simply restated as a doctrine of the 'leaders of men' ... no longer with reference to the SS, but to the mediaeval Teutonic knights of the Knights Templar, already mentioned in Rivolta."&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;

Evola spoke of "inferior non-European races".&lt;ref name=Coogan&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coogan|first1=Kevin|title=Dreamer of the day : Francis Parker Yockey and the postwar fascist international|date=1999|publisher=Autonomedia|location=Brooklyn, NY|isbn=9781570270390|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_Wa7AAAAIAAJ|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peter Merkl wrote that "Evola was never prepared to discount the value of blood altogether". Evola wrote: "a certain balanced consciousness and dignity of race can be considered healthy" in a time where "the exaltation of the negro and all the rest, anticolonialist psychosis and integrationist fanaticism [are] all parallel phenomena in the decline of Europe and the West."&lt;ref&gt;Peter H. Merkl. ''Political Violence and Terror: Motifs and Motivations''. University of California Press, 1986. p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; While not totally against race-mixing, in 1957, Evola wrote an article attributing the perceived acceleration of American decadence to the influence of "negroes" and the opposition to segregation. Furlong noted that this article is "among the most extreme in phraseology of any he wrote, and exhibits a degree of intolerance that leaves no doubt as to his deep prejudice against black people."&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;

===National mysticism===
For his spiritual interpretation of the different racial psychologies, Evola found the work of German race theorist Ludwig Ferdinand Clauss invaluable. Like Evola, Clauss believed that physical race and spiritual race could diverge as a consequence of [[miscegenation]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola's racism included racism of the body, soul, and spirit, giving primacy to the latter factor, writing that "races only declined when their spirit failed."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Like [[René Guénon]], Evola believed that mankind is living in the [[Kali Yuga]] of the [[Hindu]] tradition—the Dark Age of unleashed, materialistic appetites. He argued that both Italian fascism and [[Nazism]] represented hope that the "celestial" Aryan race would be reconstituted.&lt;ref name=intellectuals&gt;[[A. James Gregor]], ''Mussolini's Intellectuals: Fascist Social and Political Thought''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; He drew on mythological accounts of super-races and their decline, particularly the [[Hyperborea]]ns, and maintained that traces of Hyperborean influence could be felt in Indo-European man. He felt that Indo-European men had devolved from these higher mythological races.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt; Gregor noted that several contemporary criticisms of Evola's theory were published: "In one of Fascism's most important theoretical journals, Evola's critic pointed out that many Nordic-Aryans, not to speak of Mediterranean Aryans, fail to demonstrate any Hyperborean properties. Instead, they make obvious their materialism, their sensuality, their indifference to loyalty and sacrifice, together with their consuming greed. How do they differ from 'inferior' races, and why should anyone wish, in any way, to favor them?"&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|106}}

Concerning the relationship between "spiritual racism" and biological racism, Evola put forth the following viewpoint, which Furlong described as pseudo-scientific:

{{quote|The factor of "blood" or "race" has its importance, because it is not psychologically—in the brain or the opinions of the individual—but in the very deepest forces of life that traditions live and act as typical formative energies. Blood registers the effects of this action, and indeed offers through heredity, a matter that is already refined and pre-formed ...&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011" /&gt;}}

===Views on Jews===
Evola endorsed [[Otto Weininger]]'s views on the Jews. Though Evola viewed Jews as corrosive and anti-traditional, he described [[Adolf Hitler]]'s more fanatical anti-Semitism as a paranoid [[Idée fixe (psychology)|idée fixe]] that damaged the reputation of the Third Reich.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Evola's conception did not emphasize the Nazi racial conception of Jews as "representatives of a biological race"—in Evola's view the Jews were "the carriers of a world view ... a spirit [that] corresponded to the 'worst' and 'most decadent' features of modernity: democracy, egalitarianism and materialism."&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;

Evola argued that ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''—whether or not a forgery—accurately reflect the conditions of modernity.&lt;ref name=Barber/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He believed that the ''Protocols'' "contain the plan for an occult war, whose objective is the utter destruction, in the non-Jewish peoples, of all tradition, class, aristocracy, and hierarchy, and of all moral, religious, and spiritual values."&lt;ref name=religionfascism&gt;Horst Junginger. ''The Study of Religion Under the Impact of Fascism''. BRILL, 2008. p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote the foreword to the second Italian edition of the ''Protocols'', which was published by the Fascist [[Giovanni Preziosi]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=religionfascism/&gt;&lt;ref name=Dershowitz&gt;Oren Nimni and Nathan J.

Following the murder of his friend [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]], the leader of the Fascist Romanian [[Iron Guard]], Evola expressed anticipation of a "talmudic, Israelite tyranny."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; However, Evola believed that Jews had this "power" only because of European "decadence" in modernity.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; He also believed that one could be "Aryan", but have a "Jewish" soul, just as one could be "Jewish", but have an "Aryan" soul.&lt;ref&gt;Gary Lachman. ''Politics and the Occult: The Left, the Right, and the Radically Unseen''. Quest Books, 2012. p. 217&lt;/ref&gt; In Evola's view Otto Weininger and [[Carlo Michelstaedter]] were Jews of "sufficiently heroic, ascetic, and sacral" character to fit the latter category.&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|105}}

==Fascism==
Evola developed a complex line of argument, closely related to the spiritual orientation of Traditionalist writers such as [[René Guénon]] and the political concerns of the European [[Authoritarianism|Authoritarian]] Right.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt; Evola's first published political work was an anti-fascist piece in 1925. In this work, Evola called Italy's fascist movement a "laughable revolution," based on empty sentiment and materialistic concerns. He applauded Mussolini's anti-bourgeois orientation and his goal of making Italian citizens into hardened warriors, but criticized Fascist populism, party politics, and elements of leftism that he saw in the fascist regime. Evola saw Mussolini's Fascist Party as possessing no cultural or spiritual foundation. He was passionate about infusing it with these elements in order to make it suitable for his ideal conception of ''Übermensch'' culture which, in Evola's view, characterized the imperial grandeur of pre-Christian Europe.&lt;ref name=occult/&gt; He expressed anti-nationalist sentiment, stating that to become "truly human," one would have to "overcome brotherly contamination" and "purge oneself" of the feeling that one is united with others "because of blood, affections, country or human destiny." He also opposed the [[futurism]] that Italian fascism was aligned with, along with the "plebeian" nature of the movement.&lt;ref name=gregor2006/&gt;{{rp|86}} Accordingly, Evola launched the journal ''La Torre'' (The Tower), to voice his concerns and advocate for a more elitist fascism.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola's ideas were poorly received by the fascist mainstream as it stood at the time of his writing.&lt;ref name=Sedgwick/&gt;

===Mussolini===
[[File:Evola-40.jpg|thumb|Julius Evola (1940)]]
Scholars disagree about why [[Benito Mussolini]] embraced racist ideology in 1938—some scholars have written that Mussolini was more motivated by political considerations than ideology when he introduced anti-semitic legislation in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Renzo de Felice, ''Storia degli ebrei''; [[A. James Gregor]]; Meir Michaelis, ''Mussolini and the Jews''; ''contra'' Aaron Gillette, ''Racial Theories in Fascist Italy'', Ch. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars have rejected the argument that the racial ideology of Italian fascism could be attributed solely to Nazi influence.&lt;ref&gt;''See'' Luigi Preti (1968) for discussion of [[miscegenation]]; Gene Bernardini (1977) for discussion of German influence&lt;/ref&gt; A more recent interpretation is that Mussolini was frustrated by the slow pace of fascist transformation and, by 1938, had adopted increasingly radical measures including a racial ideology. Aaron Gillette has written that "Racism would become the key driving force behind the creation of the new fascist man, the ''uomo fascista''."&lt;ref&gt;Gillette, ''Racial Theories'', p.51-53&lt;/ref&gt;

Mussolini read Evola's ''Synthesis of the Doctrine of Race'' in August 1941, and met with Evola to offer him his praise. Evola later recounted that Mussolini had found in his work a uniquely Roman form of Fascist [[racism]] distinct from that found in [[Nazi Germany]]. With Mussolini's backing, Evola launched the minor journal ''Sangue e Spirito'' (Blood and Spirit). While not always in agreement with German racial theorists, Evola traveled to Germany in February 1942 and obtained support for German collaboration on ''Sangue e Spirito'' from "key figures in the German racial hierarchy."&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Fascists appreciated the [[Palingenetic ultranationalism|palingenetic]] value of Evola's "proof" "that the true representatives of the state and the culture of ancient Rome were people of the Nordic race."&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola eventually became Italy's leading racial philosopher.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt;

Evola blended [[Sorelianism]] with Mussolini's [[eugenics]] agenda. Evola has written that "The theory of the Aryo-Roman race and its corresponding myth could integrate the Roman idea proposed, in general, by fascism, as well as give a foundation to Mussolini's plan to use his state as a means to elevate the average Italian and to enucleate in him a new man."&lt;ref&gt;Gillette, ''Racial Theories'', p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 1951, Evola was arrested and charged with promoting the revival of the Fascist Party, and of glorifying Fascism. Defending himself at trial, Evola stated that his work belonged to a long tradition of anti-democratic writers who certainly could be linked to fascism—at least fascism interpreted according to certain Evolian criteria—but who certainly could not be identified with the Fascist regime under Mussolini. Evola then declared that he was not a Fascist but a "superfascist". He was acquitted.&lt;ref name=Wolff&gt;Wolff, Elisabetta Cassini. "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0031322X.2016.1243662 Evola's interpretation of fascism and moral responsibility]", Patterns of Prejudice, Vol. 50, Issue 4–5, 2016. pp. 478–494&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Reich===
Finding Italian fascism too compromising, Evola began to seek recognition in [[Nazi Germany]]. Evola spent a considerable amount of time in Germany in 1937 and 1938, and gave a series of lectures to the German–Italian Society in 1938.&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002" /&gt; Evola took issue with Nazi populism and biological materialism. SS authorities initially rejected Evola's ideas as supranational and aristocratic though he was better received by members of the conservative revolutionary movement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Nazi [[Ahnenerbe]] reported that many considered his ideas to be pure "fantasy" which ignored "historical facts.".&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002"/&gt; Evola admired [[Heinrich Himmler]], whom he knew personally,&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002" /&gt; but he had reservations about [[Adolf Hitler]] because of Hitler's reliance on ''völkisch'' nationalism.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Himmler's [[Schutzstaffel]] ("SS") kept a dossier on Evola—dossier document AR-126 described his plans for a "Roman-Germanic Imperium" as "utopian" and described him as a "reactionary Roman," whose goal was an "insurrection of the old aristocracy against the modern world." The document recommended that the SS "stop his effectiveness in Germany" and provide him with no support, particularly because of his desire to create a "secret international order".&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H.T. Hansen, "A Short Introduction to Julius Evola" in Evola, ''Revolt Against the Modern World'', p xviii.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Umland&gt;A. James Gregor and Andreas Umland. ''Erwägen Wissen Ethik'', 15: 3 &amp; 4 (2004), pp. 424-429, 591-595; vol. 16: 4 (2005), pp. 566-572 ''[https://www.academia.edu/174269/Dugin_Not_a_Fascist_A_Debate_with_A._James_Gregor_6_texts_ Dugin Not a Fascist?]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this opposition, Evola was able to establish political connections with pan-Europeanist elements inside the [[Reich Main Security Office]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola subsequently ascended to the inner circles of Nazism as the influence of pan-European advocates overtook that of Völkisch proponents, due to military contingencies.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola wrote the article ''Reich and Imperium as Elements in the New European Order'' for the Nazi-backed journal ''European Review''.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; He spent World War II working for the [[Sicherheitsdienst]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; The Sicherheitsdienst bureau Amt VII, a [[Reich Main Security Office]] research library, helped Evola acquire arcane occult and Masonic texts.&lt;ref name=Rahn&gt;Nigel Graddon. ''Otto Rahn and the Quest for the Grail: The Amazing Life of the Real Indiana Jones''. SCB Distributors, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forum/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Italian Fascism went into decline when, in 1943, Mussolini was deposed and imprisoned. At this point, Evola fled to Germany with the help of the Sicherheitsdienst.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Although not a member of the [[National Fascist Party]], and despite his apparent problems with the Fascist regime, Evola was one of the first people to greet Mussolini when the latter was broken out of prison by [[Otto Skorzeny]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin, Matthew Feldman. ''Fascism: Post-war fascisms''. Taylor &amp; Francis, 2004. p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Evola helped welcome Mussolini to [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Wolf's Lair]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Following this, Evola involved himself in Mussolini's [[Italian Social Republic]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; It was Evola's custom to walk around the city of [[Vienna]] during [[bombing raid]]s in order to better "ponder his destiny". During one such raid, 1945, a [[shell (projectile)|shell]] fragment damaged his [[spinal cord]] and he became [[paralysis|paralyzed]] from the waist down, remaining so for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Guido&gt;Guido Stucco, "Translator's Introduction," in Evola, ''The Yoga of Power'', pp. ix–xv&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-War==
[[File:Julius Evola – Smernice (it. Orientamenti).jpg|thumb|Julius Evola – ''Směrnice'' (2015),  the Czech translation  of his book ''Orientamenti'' (1950).]]
After World War II, Evola continued his work in esotericism. He wrote a number of books and articles on sex magic and various other esoteric studies, including ''The Yoga of Power: Tantra, Shakti, and the Secret Way'' (1949), ''Eros and the Mysteries of Love: The Metaphysics of Sex'' (1958), and ''Meditations on the Peaks: Mountain Climbing as Metaphor for the Spiritual Quest'' (1974). He also wrote his two explicitly political books ''Men Among the Ruins: Post-War Reflections of a Radical Traditionalist'' (1953), ''Ride the Tiger: A Survival Manual for the Aristocrats of the Soul'' (1961), and his autobiography,&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; ''The Path of Cinnabar'' (1963). He also expanded upon critiques of American civilization and materialism, as well as increasing American influence in Europe, collected in the posthumous anthology ''Civiltà Americana''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civiltà americana. Scritti sugli Stati Uniti (1930–1968)|last=Evola|first=Julius|publisher=Controcorrente|year=2010|isbn=|location=Napoli|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evola's occult ontology exerted influence over post-war [[neo-fascism]].&lt;ref name="Aaron Gillette 2002" /&gt; In the post-war period, Evola's writing evoked interest among the neo-fascist right.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; After 1945, Evola was considered the most important Italian theoretician of the conservative revolutionary movement&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt; and the "chief ideologue" of Italy's post-war radical right.&lt;ref name=Payne/&gt; According to Egil Asprem and Kennet Granholm, Evola's most significant post-war political texts are ''Orientamenti'' and ''Men Among the Ruins''.&lt;ref&gt;Egil Asprem, Kennet Granholm. ''Contemporary Esotericism''. Routledge, 2014. p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;

''Orientamenti'' was a text against "national fascism"—instead, it advocated for a European Community modeled on the principles of the [[Waffen-SS]].&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; The Italian Neo-fascist group [[Ordine Nuovo]] adopted ''Orientamenti'' as a guide for action in postwar Italy.&lt;ref name=Laurelle&gt;Marlene Laruelle. ''Eurasianism and the European Far Right: Reshaping the Europe–Russia Relationship''. Lexington Books, 2015. p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Liberation Front]], who were affiliated with [[Francis Parker Yockey]], called Evola "Italy's gretest living authoritarian philosopher" in the April 1951 issue of their publication ''Frontfighter''.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

During the post-war period, Evola attempted to dissociate himself from totalitarianism, preferring the concept of the "organic" state, which he put forth in his text ''Men Among the Ruins''.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt; Evola sought to develop a strategy for the implementation of a "conservative revolution" in post World War II Europe.&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt; He rejected nationalism, advocating instead for a European ''Imperium'', which could take various forms according to local conditions, but should be "organic, hierarchical, anti-democratic, and anti-individual."&lt;ref name="Furlong 2011"/&gt; Evola endorsed [[Francis Parker Yockey]]'s neo-fascist manifesto ''Imperium'', but disagreed with it because he believed that Yockey had a "superficial" understanding of what was immediately possible.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; Evola believed that his conception of neo-fascist Europe could best be implemented by an elite of "superior" men who operated outside normal politics.&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt;

Giuliano Salierni was an activist in the neo-Fascist [[Italian Social Movement]] during the early 1950s. He later recalled Evola's calls to violence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Roberto Fiore]] and his colleagues in the early 1980s helped the [[National Front (UK)|National Front]]{{'}}s "Political Soldiers" forge a militant elitist philosophy based on Evola's "most militant tract", ''The Aryan Doctrine of Battle and Victory''. ''The Aryan Doctrine'' called for a "Great Holy War" that would be fought for spiritual renewal and fought in parallel to the physical "Little Holy War" against perceived enemies.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Wolff attributes extreme-right terrorist actions in Italy in the 1970s and 1980s to the influence of Julius Evola.&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;

Thomas Sheehan has argued that Evola's work is essential reading for those seeking to understand [[Neo-fascism|Eurofascism]], in the same way that knowledge of the writings of [[Karl Marx]] is necessary for those seeking to understand Communist actions.&lt;ref name=sheehanterror/&gt;

==Political influence==
The Italian Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]], the Nazi Grail seeker [[Otto Rahn]], and the Romanian fascist sympathizer and religious historian [[Mircea Eliade]] admired Julius Evola.&lt;ref name=HorowitzMussolini/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rahn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wolff/&gt;&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; After World War II, Evola's writings continued to influence many European far-right political, racist and neo-fascist movements. He is widely translated in French, Spanish, partly in German, and mostly in Hungarian (the largest number of his translated works [see &lt;http://www.tradicio.org/bibliographia.pdf&gt; pp.&amp;nbsp;130–154]). Amongst those he has influenced are the American Blackshirts Party, the "esoteric Hitlerist" [[Miguel Serrano]],&lt;ref name=Coogan/&gt; [[Savitri Devi]], [[GRECE]], the [[Italian Social Movement|Movimento sociale italiano]] (MSI), [[Gaston Armand Amaudruz]]'s [[New European Order|Nouvel Ordre Européen]], [[Pino Rauti]]'s [[Ordine Nuovo]], [[Troy Southgate]], [[Alain de Benoist]], [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]], [[Giorgio Freda]], the [[Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari]] (Armed Revolutionary Nuclei), [[Eduard Limonov]], [[New Force (Italy)|Forza Nuova]], [[CasaPound|CasaPound Italia]], [[Tricolor Flame]] and the [[Conservative People's Party of Estonia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} [[Giorgio Almirante]] referred to him as "our [[Herbert Marcuse|Marcuse]]&amp;mdash;only better."&lt;ref name=sheehanterror/&gt; According to one leader of the neofascist "black terrorist" [[Ordine Nuovo]], "Our work since 1953 has been to transpose Evola's teachings into direct political action."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ferraresi, Franco. "The Radical Right in Postwar Italy." ''Politics &amp; Society''. 1988 16:71-119. (p.84)&lt;/ref&gt; The now defunct French fascist group [[Third Way (France)|Troisième Voie]] was also inspired by Evola.&lt;ref&gt;Institute of Race relations. "The far Right in Europe: a guide." ''Race &amp; Class'', 1991, Vol. 32, No. 3:125-146 (p.132).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Bowden]], English political activist and chairman of the [[Far-right politics in the United Kingdom|far right]], spoke highly of Evola and his ideas and gave lectures on his philosophy.

Evola has also influenced the [[alt-right]] movement,&lt;ref name=HorowitzMussolini/&gt; which also cites [[Oswald Spengler]], [[H. L. Mencken|H.L Mencken]], [[Samuel T. Francis|Sam Francis]], and [[Pat Buchanan]] as influences.&lt;ref name=Dershowitz/&gt; Additionally, Evola has influenced [[Vladimir Putin]] advisor&lt;ref name=Meyer&gt;Meyer, Henry and Ant, Onur.

[[Donald Trump]]'s former chief adviser [[Steve Bannon]] noted Evola's influence on the [[Eurasianism]] movement;&lt;ref name=Bannon&gt;Feder, J. Lester.

'''''July Fourteenth, Rue Daunou, 1910''''' is an early 20th century painting by American impressionist [[Childe Hassam]]. Done in oil on canvas, the painting depicts the celebration of [[Bastille Day]] in [[Paris]].

== Description ==
''July Fourteenth, Rue Daunou, 1910'' depicts the celebration of Bastille Day from the artist's viewpoint on top of the Hôtel l’Empire in Paris. The street below is thronged with automobiles and people, while the flags of France, Belgium, and the United States are being flown on various buildings. The [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], where the painting is now on display, considers the painting to be a precursor to Hassam's famous [[Childe Hassam#The Flag series|Flag Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/11035?sortBy=Relevance&amp;amp;od=on&amp;amp;ft=*&amp;amp;offset=500&amp;amp;rpp=100&amp;amp;pos=569|title=July Fourteenth, Rue Daunou, 1910|publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/hass/hd_hass.htm|title=July Fourteenth, Rue Daunou, 1910|publisher= Metropolitan Museum of Art|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kirsten Beyer''' is an American science fiction writer, best known for her [[List of Star Trek: Voyager novels|novels]] based on the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' television series. She is a staff writer for ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]'', and functions as the coordinator for ''Discovery'' tie-in media, such as comic books and novels, on behalf of [[CBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/interview-discovery-writer-voyager-novelist-kirsten-beyer|title=INTERVIEW: Discovery Writer, Voyager Novelist Kirsten Beyer|last=|first=|date=2017-09-23|work=StarTrek.com|access-date=2018-04-08|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|publisher=CBS Entertainment|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has also written for the [[Buffyverse]].

== Career ==
Little is known of Beyer's career prior to her involvement with ''Star Trek: Voyager''.

After corresponding with ''Voyager'' show runner [[Jeri Taylor]] expressing an interest in writing for television, Beyer was invited to [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]] for the series.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Voyages of Imagination|last=Ayers|first=Jeff|publisher=Pocket Books|year=|isbn=1-4165-0349-8|location=New York|publication-date=14 Nov 2006|pages=299–301}}&lt;/ref&gt; She pitched stories from ''Voyager'' seasons five (1998) until seven (2000), but none were produced.

Beyer was encouraged to send a [[Query letter|query package]] to [[Pocket Books]] by her writing partner, Heather Jarman. The query was accepted, and development of a new ''Voyager'' tie-in novel began. However, the editor leading the development moved on to other projects, and the unnamed novel was never realized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Beyer was later introduced to Marco Palmieri, editor of the ''Star Trek'' line at [[Pocket Books]], while attending the Shore Leave science fiction convention with Jarman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unreality-sf.net/2009/04/05/kirsten-beyer-interview/|title=Kirsten Beyer interview {{!}} Unreality SF|last=|first=|date=2009-04-05|website=Unreality-SF.net|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palmieri agreed to accept samples of her work, and invited Beyer to write for him a few days later.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Beyer's first published novel with Palmieri was ''Fusion'' ({{Date|Nov 2005|format=dmy}}), the second book in the ''Voyager: String Theory'' miniseries. A subplot of the novel, involving the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] character [[Tuvok]], was originally a ''Voyager'' episode pitch titled "Siren's Song".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another unproduced pitch became the short story "Isabo's Shirt", [[anthology|anthologized]] in ''Distant Shores'' ({{Date|Nov 2005|format=dmy}}). Beyer becoming the lead writer of the ''Voyager'' novel series, replacing [[Christie Golden]], with the release of ''Full Circle'' in {{Date|Mar 2009|format=dmy}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startrek.com/article/kirsten-beyer-unleashes-a-storm|title=Kirsten Beyer Unleashes a Storm|last=|first=|date=2011-05-31|website=StarTrek.com|publisher=CBS Entertainment|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2017-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has completed nine novels in the series since 2009, with a tenth planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fletcher|first1=Harry|title=Star Trek 2017 TV show hires Voyager novelist Kirsten Beyer|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/star-trek/news/a796209/star-trek-2017-tv-show-hires-voyager-novelist-kirsten-beyer/|accessdate=November 1, 2017|work=Digital Spy|date=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite podcast|url=http://trek.fm/literary-treks/225|publisher=Stellar Debris, Ltd.|website=Literary Treks|title=A Ship Full of Legends|date=8 Apr 2018|host=|last1=Gunther|first1=Dan|last2=Gibson|first2=Bruce|series=|number=225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In {{Date|May 2016|format=dmy}}, Beyer was hired as a staff writer for ''[[Star Trek: Discovery]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://screencrush.com/cbs-star-trek-kirsten-beyer-writer-voyager/|title=CBS 'Star Trek' 2017 Adds 'Voyager' Novels Writer to Staff|last=|first=|date=2016-05-30|website=ScreenCrush|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She believes she was recruited because of her familiarity with ''Star Trek'' [[Star Trek canon|canon]], and because of her experience as a tie-in fiction writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2017/09/how_shows_like_star_trek_discovery_stick_to_canon.html|title=The Keepers of the Canon|last=Martinelli|first=Marissa|date=2017-09-21|work=Slate|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has contributed to the ''Discovery'' comics line published by [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] from its first issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bleedingcool.com/2017/07/19/star-trek-discovery-kirsten-beyer-comic-october-idw/|title=Star Trek: Discovery's Kirsten Beyer Behind Spinoff Comic, Starting In October, From IDW - Bleeding Cool News And Rumors|date=2017-07-19|work=Bleeding Cool News And Rumors|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyer was revealed as a writer of an upcoming ''Star Trek'' series, detailing the later years of the character [[Jean-Luc Picard]], via a Twitter post by actor [[Patrick Stewart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/SirPatStew/status/1044244216677912576|title=Patrick Stewart on Twitter|last=|first=|date=2018-09-24|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beyer regularly attends science fiction conventions such as Star Trek Las Vegas, Shore Leave, and [[Dragon Con]]. She frequently appears as a guest on ''Star Trek''-focused podcasts to promote her book releases, and to discuss ''Discovery'' production news.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11692">The [[Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame]] (LSHOF) was established in 2012 by [[Rudy Pérez]] and [[Desmond Child]] in the United States to "educate, preserve, honor and celebrate the legacy of the greatest [[Latin music (genre)|Latin]] songwriters from all over the world and their music in every genre".&lt;ref name="miaminews"&gt;{{cite news|author1=S.

The organization's committee is made up of music professional from 21 Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries in Latin America, Europe, and the United States. Nominees for the LSHOF are chosen by the committees while inductees are voted by the public.&lt;ref name="Levin"/&gt; For a songwriter to be considered, they must have a composed a [[hit song]] at least twenty years old.&lt;ref name="Puga"/&gt; Both living and deceased songwriters are eligible to be inducted into the LSHOF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.latinsonghall.com/about-us/|website=Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame|accessdate=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inductions were first held in 2013: [[Manuel Alejandro]], [[José Ángel Espinoza]], [[José Feliciano]], [[Julio Iglesias]], [[Armando Manzanero]], [[Concha Valdés Miranda]], and [[Roberto Cantoral]] were the first songwriters to be inducted. The latter was posthumously inducted.&lt;ref name="billboard"/&gt; Mexico is the country with the most songwriters inducted with twelve.

This is a list of awards, winners and commendations awarded by the international '''[[World Architecture Festival]]''' (WAF). 

==History==
In 2008 all winners were award winners. In 2009 and later only 5 of the winners were declared award winners.

The list is compiled from the official websites of World Architecture Festival and World Buildings Directory. Where there was a discrepancy between the information on the project page and the winner list with WAF, the information from the WAF list was used. All names are spelled as in the WAF list, links may therefore lead to articles with different spellings. In some cases the projects were renamed after receiving the award.
The notes to the list contain a link to the project page with World Buildings Directory and are sorted in the same sequence as in the winner lists published by the World Architecture Festival.

'''Lundgaard &amp; Tranberg Arkitekter''' is a Danish [[architecture|architectural firm]], based in [[Copenhagen]] [[Denmark]]. It is most noted for the [[Tietgenkollegiet]] student housing in [[Ørestad]] from 2006 and the [[Royal Danish Playhouse]] on the Copenhagen harbourfront from 2008. Lundgaard &amp; Tranberg has won [[RIBA European Award]]s three years in a row in 2006, 2007 and 2008.&lt;ref name="RIBA European Awards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAEuropeanAwards/RIBAEuropeanAwards.aspx |title=RIBA European Awards |publisher=RIBA |accessdate=2009-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930190836/http://www.architecture.com/Awards/RIBAEuropeanAwards/RIBAEuropeanAwards.aspx |archivedate=2009-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RIBA European Awards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="RIBA Awards 2007: UK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-architect.co.uk/awards/riba_awards_2007.htm|title=RIBA Awards 2007: UK|publisher=e-architects|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Lundgaard &amp; Tranberg was founded in 1983 by Boje Lundgaard and Lene Tranberg. In the 1990s, the firm gained a reputation as designers of [[Combined heat and power plant|heat &amp; power plant]] and other technical facilities, while its breakthrough in the general public came in the mid-2000s with  the Charlottehaven from residential project from 2004 and particularly the award-winning and highly celebrated designs for the Tietgenkollegiet student residences and a new building for the [[Royal Danish Theater]]. In 2004, just when the firm's major success set in, Boje Lundgaard departed, and Lene Tranberg continued the practice with a new partner group.

'''[[Maqbara|Maqbarat]]-o-shoara''' ({{lang-ar|مقبرةالشعراء}}) or the '''Mausoleum of Poets''' ({{lang|fa|مزارِ شاعران}} ''Mazār-e Shāerān'' or {{lang|fa|مزارِ سرایندگان}} ''Mazār-e Sorāyandegān'') is a graveyard belonging to classical and contemporary poets, mystics and other notable people, located in the [[Surkhab district]] of [[Tabriz]] in [[Iran]]. It was built by Tahmaseb Dolatshahi in the mid-1970s while he was the Secretary of Arts and Cultures of [[East Azarbaijan]].

On the east side of Sayyed Hamzeh's grave and Ghaem Magham's grave, there is a graveyard containing the graves of important poets, mystics, scientists and well-known people of Tabriz. The Mausoleum was first mentioned by the medieval historian [[Hamdollah Mostowfi]] in his ''[[Nozhat ol-Gholub]]''.  Hamdollah mentions it being located in what, at the time, was the Surkhab district of Tabriz.  

Since the 1970s, there have been attempts to renovate the graveyard area. Some work has been carried out like the construction of a new symbolic building on this site.

The first poet buried in this complex is [[Asadi Tusi]] (999-1072).

The '''Minnesota Fringe Festival''' is a performing arts festival held in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], [[United States]], every summer, usually during the first two weeks in August.  The eleven-day event, which features performing artists of many genres and disciplines, is one of many [[Fringe Festival]]s in [[North America]].  Minnesota Fringe is the largest nonjuried festival in the United States&lt;ref name=2014stribstats&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe Festival hits new ticket record|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/blogs/270773461.html|accessdate=November 24, 2014|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the third-largest Fringe festival in North America.  In 2013, Minnesota Fringe ran August 1–11 and featured 176 shows with a total of 895 performances in multiple venues around the city and distributed 50,007 tickets over the eleven-day event. In 2007, attendance and box office revenue were adversely affected by the [[I-35W Mississippi River bridge|collapse of the I-35W bridge]] the day before the festival opened.

Fringe shows are 60 minutes or less and appear in an official venue supplied by the festival for five performances stretched out over the festival's eleven days.  Venues vary widely, with capacities ranging from 55 to over 400, and available configurations include black-box, proscenium, thrust or arena stages.  Past venues include Minneapolis Theatre Garage, [[HUGE Improv Theater]], [[Mixed Blood Theatre]] mainstage, [[Theatre de la Jeune Lune]]'s side stage and the four stages at the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Rarig Center]].&lt;ref name=2014venues&gt;{{cite news|title=Minnesota Fringe will have 20 Minneapolis venues|url=http://www.twincities.com/stage/ci_25426766/minnesota-fringe-will-have-20-minneapolis-venues|accessdate=November 24, 2014|work=[[St. Paul Pioneer Press]]|date=March 26, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, eleven shows will share a venue.

Performing companies that participate in the Fringe split a share of the ticket revenues with the festival and pay an application fee.  Currently, the artists' share is 65 percent of the box office revenue.

The 2017 festival, which runs August 3-13, marks the 24th annual festival, the first under the leadership of executive director Dawn Bentley, who assumed this position on April 3, 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=A new director takes the helm at the Minnesota Fringe Festival|url=http://www.startribune.com/a-new-director-takes-the-helm-at-the-minnesota-fringe-festival/415000824/|accessdate=March 1, 2017|publisher=[[Star Tribune|Minneapolis Star Tribune]]|date=February 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; after former executive director Jeff D.

==History==
{{further|List of Minnesota Fringe Festivals}}
The Minnesota Fringe Festival was created as part of a trend of [[fringe festival]] establishments in the United States. The country's first fringe was the [[Seattle Fringe Festival]], founded in 1991, followed by the [[Orlando International Fringe Theater Festival]] and the [[San Francisco Fringe Festival]] in 1992 and 1993, respectively.&lt;ref name="NA fests"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hersh|first1=Amy|title=North American fringe fests: A new tradition that's growing|url=https://apps.hclib.org/auth/EDS?url=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dedb%26AN%3d9512033983%26site%3deds-live%26scope%3dsite|accessdate=June 14, 2016|work=[[Backstage (magazine)|Back Stage]]|date=November 17, 1995|subscription=yes|via=[[EBSCOHost]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded by Bob McFadden and operating with a budget of around $35,000, the Minnesota Fringe Festival first ran from June 23–July 2, 1994, in several theaters around the [[Cedar-Riverside, Minneapolis|West Bank]] neighborhood of [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name="fringe at 20"&gt;{{cite news|title=Minnesota Fringe Festival at 20|first1=Rohan|last1=Preston|url=http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-fringe-festival-at-20/217176491/|date=August 1, 2013|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|archivedate=July 9, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709230904/http://www.startribune.com/minnesota-fringe-festival-at-20/217176491/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pizzato"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pizzato|first1=Mark|title=Minnesota Fringe Festival|journal=[[Theatre Journal]]|date=March 1995|volume=47|issue=1|pages=142–145|jstor=3208817|doi=10.2307/3208817}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of the festival's name, the Minnesota Fringe did not serve as the fringe festival to any larger, more mainstream theater event. The first annual Fringe was described by Mark Pizzato as "quickly organized and underpublicized", with low attendance reported at its 53 shows, each of which cost six dollars or less and ran under 90 minutes.&lt;ref name="pizzato" /&gt; It drew 4,600 theatergoers and featured shows from companies hailing from three continents (North America, Asia, and Europe).&lt;ref name="returns1995"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abdallah|first1=Cheryl|title=Minnesota Fringe Festival Returns|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-2351423.html|accessdate=June 14, 2016|work=Asian Pages|date=June 30, 1995|subscription=yes|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival's growth was modest in its first several years. In 1997, following the previous year's festival which had seen the lowest attendance of any Fringe to date, the event moved to the [[Loring Park]] neighborhood.&lt;ref name="loring"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Vaughan|first1=Peter|title=Grass is greener in Loring Park for Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62606945.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=March 16, 1997|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year marked an attendance of 4,300, after which point Dean Seal replaced McFadden as the festival's executive director.&lt;ref name="seal steps down"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe producer Seal steps down; festival reorganizes staff|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-78377664.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=September 18, 2001|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="passes"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=Fringe getting bigger|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62564942.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 23, 1998|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the festival began offering patrons multi-show passes and attendance increased to 6,573.&lt;ref name="passes" /&gt; The following year, the festival's attendance more than doubled, owing, according to Fringe officials, to better marketing and the 68 shows at that years festival, an increase from previous years.&lt;ref name="double"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=Fans flocked to this year's Fringe Festival|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62458919.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=August 12, 1999|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the Fringe won a $10,000 grant from the [[McKnight Foundation]] and once more expanded, to 80 shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Preston|first1=Rohan|title=Boosting the Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-62456545.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=April 23, 2000|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Festival operations, with a working budget of $260,000, were run out of an office space above the Acadia Cabaret Cafe in Minneapolis, and the festival had begun attracting a variety of sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peck|first1=Claude|title=Growth at the Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-63677082.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=July 23, 2000|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in its earlier years, acts had been selected by invitation, by the new millennium the festival was operating on an [[unjuried]] [[first-come, first-served]] model.&lt;ref name="loring" /&gt;&lt;ref name="2001 success"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Success presses Fringe|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-76875872.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=July 29, 2001|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2001 festival marked the first year that Fringe organizers had to turn away applicants, with the number of shows capped at 120.&lt;ref name="2001 success" /&gt; The festival had also expanded into screening films and showcasing visual art as part of the Visual Fringe.&lt;ref name="on the move"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Royce|first1=Graydon|title=Fringe is on the move|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-88131007.html|accessdate=July 9, 2016|work=[[Star Tribune]]|date=June 30, 2002|via=[[HighBeam Research]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features of the Minnesota Fringe==
[[File:The Donner Party Kidz!.jpg|thumb|right|''The Donner Party Kidz!'', a show from the 2012 Festival]]
===Nonjuried entry===
Minnesota Fringe Festival is nonjuried; that is, the performers and shows are not vetted by a panel of judges ahead of time.  Companies that wish to perform submit applications and are drawn by lottery, a practice that replaced the festival's former method of "first come, first served" in 2004.

===Performance categories===
The festival is open to all performing artists.  Show genres typically include comedy (scripted and improv), drama, dance (classical, modern and ethnic), puppetry, musical theater, opera and shows for/by children and teens. Minnesota Fringe, like many fringe festivals, has proven to be an excellent launching point for new work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2amtheatre.com/2010/08/19/the-minnesota-fringe-festival-and-the-popularity-of-new-plays/ "The Minnesota Fringe Festival and the Popularity of New Plays"]; 2AMt blog, Max "Bunny" Sparber; 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessibility===
Each venue is wheelchair-accessible and the festival offers ASL-interpreted shows for the deaf and hard-of-hearing, as well as audio-described shows for the blind.&lt;ref name=access&gt;{{cite news|title=Accessible Fringe Festival Returns for 13th Season|url=http://www.accesspress.org/archive/2006/07/story_accessible_fringe_festival.htm|accessdate=November 24, 2014|work=Access Press|date=July 10, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014133421/http://www.accesspress.org/archive/2006/07/story_accessible_fringe_festival.htm|archivedate=October 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Bring Your Own Venue"===
In the past, Minnesota Fringe has provided an option for companies to produce site-specific work outside the official venues. The Bring Your Own Venue (BYOV) option was only available for shows that could not normally fit into a traditional theater space.  Past BYOV shows have been staged in places such as a clothing store dressing area, a swimming pool, an art gallery and a coffee shop.  In 2006, 23 shows, a record number, performed in BYOV slots.&lt;ref&gt;Papatola, Dominic; [http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/entertainment/performing_arts/15181139.htm "Wrinkle in the rules requires some fringers to get a place lift"]; St. Paul Pioneer Press; 3 August 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Website===
The [http://www.fringefestival.org Minnesota Fringe Festival Website] operates year-round.  All of the shows in the yearly festival are up for review by any audience member who registers on the site.  Shows are rated on a scale of 0 to 5 stars along with a written review.  Each show is assigned an overall star rating based on the average of all the reviews received.  Minnesota Fringe also retains a staff of photographers who attend shows and return photographs for the festival's daily slide show.  During the six-week 2013 festival period, the site received over a million pageviews.

[[File:Beatles ad 1965 just the beatles crop.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[John Lennon]] (far left) with [[the Beatles]], 1965]]

"'''More popular than Jesus'''"{{efn|Although "Bigger than Jesus" has been used in analysis of the controversy,{{sfn|Womack|Davis|2012|p=103}} the specific words used were "more popular than Jesus".{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=308–309}}}} was part of a longer remark made by [[the Beatles]]' [[John Lennon]] during a 1966 interview, in which he argued that [[Christianity]] would end, possibly before [[rock music]]. His opinions drew no controversy when originally published in the United Kingdom, but angry reactions flared up in Christian communities when the comment was republished in the United States five months later. The full quotation was: {{quote|Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I'll be proved right. '''We're more popular than Jesus now'''; I don't know which will go first – rock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.}}

The statement originates from an interview conducted by journalist [[Maureen Cleave]], who included it in a March 1966 article for the London newspaper the ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'', which drew no public reaction at the time. When ''Datebook'', a US teen magazine, quoted Lennon's comments five months later in August, extensive protests broke out in the United States, particularly throughout the [[Bible Belt]]. Some radio stations stopped playing Beatles songs, their records were publicly burned, press conferences were cancelled, and threats were made. The controversy coincided with the group's [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|US tour in August 1966]], and Lennon and [[Brian Epstein]] attempted to quell the dispute at a series of press conferences. Some tour events experienced disruption and intimidation, including a picketing by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

Shortly after the controversy broke, Lennon reluctantly apologised for the comment, saying "if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it". He stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people [[Cultural impact of the Beatles|viewed and popularised the band]]. The events contributed to the Beatles' lack of interest in public live performances, and the US tour was the last they undertook, after which they became a studio-only band.

==Background {{anchor|BiggerThanJesus}}==
{{The Beatles history}}

In March 1966, London's ''[[London Evening Standard|Evening Standard]]'' ran a weekly series of articles titled "How Does a Beatle Live?"{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}} that featured, in chronological order, [[John Lennon]], [[Ringo Starr]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Paul McCartney]]. The articles were written by journalist [[Maureen Cleave]],{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}} who knew the group well and had interviewed them regularly since the start of [[Beatlemania in the United Kingdom|Beatlemania]] in the UK. Three years previously she had described them as "the darlings of Merseyside",{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}} and had accompanied them on the plane on the group's first US tour in February 1964.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}}{{sfn|Pawlowski|1990|p=175}} For her lifestyle series in March 1966, she chose to interview the group individually, rather than all together, as was the norm.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=307}}

Cleave interviewed Lennon on 4 March 1966. At his home, [[Kenwood, St. George's Hill|Kenwood]], in [[Weybridge]], she found a full-size [[crucifix]], a [[gorilla]] [[costume]], a medieval suit of [[armour]]{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=449}} and a well-organised library, with works by [[Alfred, Lord Tennyson]], [[Jonathan Swift]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[George Orwell]], [[Aldous Huxley]],{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=308–309}} and ''[[The Passover Plot]]'' by [[Hugh J. Schonfield]], which had influenced Lennon's ideas about Christianity.{{sfn|Cadogan|2008|p=4}} Cleave's article mentioned that Lennon was "reading extensively about religion",{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=308–309}} and quoted a comment he made:

{{blockquote|Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I'll be proved right. We're more popular than Jesus now; I don't know which will go first – [[rock and roll|rock 'n' roll]] or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his [[Disciple (Christianity)|disciples]] were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=308–309}}&lt;ref name="LennonIKnew"&gt;{{cite news |first=Maureen |last=Cleave |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3646983/The-John-Lennon-I-knew.html |title=The John Lennon I knew |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=5 August 2014 | date=5 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Cleave's interview with Lennon was published in the ''Evening Standard'' in March 1966 and provoked no public reaction in the UK.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}} [[Church attendance]] there was in decline and the Christian churches were making no secret of the need to transform their image into something more relevant to modern times.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}} Music historian Jonathan Gould wrote, "The satire comedians had had a field day with the increasingly desperate attempts of the Church to make itself seem more relevant ('Don't call me vicar, call me ''Dick''&amp;nbsp;...')."{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}} In 1963, the [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] [[Bishop of Woolwich]], [[John A.T. Robinson]], published a [[controversy|controversial]] but popular book, ''[[Honest to God]]'', urging the nation to reject traditional church teachings on [[morality]] and the concept of God as an "old man in the sky", and instead embrace a universal ethic of love.{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}} [[Bryan R. Wilson]]'s 1966 text ''Religion in Secular Society'' explained that increasing [[secularisation]] led to British churches being abandoned. However, in the US, churches remained popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Secularisation in the Christian World: Essays in Honour of Hugh McLeod|editor1-first=Callum G.|editor1-last=Brown|editor2-first=Michael Francis|editor2-last=Snape|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2010|p=205|isbn=978-0-7546-6131-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both McCartney and Harrison had been baptised in the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]], but neither of them followed Christianity.&lt;ref name="vatican"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/vaticancityandholysee/7579019/Vatican-forgives-The-Beatles-for-bigger-than-Jesus-comment.html|title=Vatican forgives The Beatles for 'bigger than Jesus' comment|first=Nick|last=Pisa|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=11 April 2010|accessdate=5 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the start of Beatlemania, the group came into contact with the Revd Ronald Gibbons, who told reporters that a Beatles version of "[[O Come, All Ye Faithful]]" might provide the [[Church of England]] with "the very shot in the arm it needs".{{sfn|Gould|2008|p=342}}

==Response in the US==
The day after Cleave's article appeared in the ''Evening Standard'', Beatles press officer [[Tony Barrow]] offered ''Datebook'', a US teen magazine, rights to all four interviews. Barrow believed the pieces were important to show fans that the Beatles were progressing beyond simple [[pop music]] and producing more intellectually challenging work. As ''Datebook'' was a socially progressive magazine that addressed subjects such as interracial dating and legalisation of marijuana, it seemed like a suitable vehicle to carry this information.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=82}}

Lennon's quote was featured in a 3 July article in ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' and provoked no reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cleave |first=Maureen |date=3 July 1966 |title=Old Beatles—A Study in Paradox |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/07/03/93851831.html?pageNumber=118 |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York, New York |access-date=16 December 2016 |pages=10–11, 30–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late July, when ''Datebook'' republished the interviews, editor Art Unger put Lennon's quote "I don't know which will go first – rock 'n' roll or Christianity!" on the cover.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}}&lt;ref name="JohnLennonforgiven"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/culture/music/article133727.ece |title=John Lennon forgiven for Jesus claim |first=Maurice |last=Chittenden |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |accessdate=2 June 2011 | date=23 November 2008 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also on the cover was a quote from Paul McCartney regarding America: "It's a lousy country where anyone black is a dirty nigger!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Luft |first=Eric |date=2009 |title=Die at the Right Time: A Subjective Cultural History of the American Sixties |url= |location=North Syracuse, New York |publisher=Gegensatz Press |page=181 |isbn=978-0-9655179-2-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Birmingham, Alabama]], [[WAYE|WAQY]] DJ Tommy Charles heard about Lennon's remarks from his coworker Doug Layton, and was immediately incensed, saying, "That does it for me. I am not going to play the Beatles any more".{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}} Charles and Layton asked for listeners' views on Lennon's comment and the response was overwhelmingly negative.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}} Charles later stated, "We just felt it was so absurd and [[sacrilege|sacrilegious]] that something ought to be done to show them that they can't get away with this sort of thing".{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=340–341}} Al Benn, who was the bureau manager for [[United Press International]] News, heard the WAQY show and immediately filed a news report in New York City, culminating in a major news story in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on 5 August.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}} Over twenty other stations followed WAQY's lead with similar announcements. Some stations in the [[Deep South]] went further, organising demonstrations with bonfires, drawing hordes of teenagers to publicly burn their Beatles records and other memorabilia.{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=176}}

Epstein was so concerned by the reaction that he considered cancelling [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|the group's upcoming US tour]], believing they would be seriously harmed in some way.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} He then flew to the US and held a press conference in [[New York City]], where he publicly criticised ''Datebook'', saying the magazine had taken Lennon's words out of context, and expressed regret on behalf of the group that "people with certain religious beliefs should have been offended in any way".{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} Epstein's efforts had little effect, as the controversy quickly spread beyond the borders of the US. In [[Mexico City]] there were demonstrations against the group, and a number of countries, including [[South Africa]] and [[Spain]],&lt;ref name="SquashesBeatles"&gt;{{cite news |title=South Africa Squashes Beatles |newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |page=6|date=9 August 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; made the decision to ban the Beatles' music on national radio stations.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} The [[Holy See|Vatican]] issued a public denouncement of Lennon's comments.&lt;ref name="vatican"/&gt;

The Beatles left for their US tour on 11 August 1966. According to Lennon's wife, [[Cynthia Lennon|Cynthia]], he was nervous and upset that he had made people angry simply by expressing his opinion.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=83}} The Beatles attended a press conference in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]; Lennon did not want to apologise but was advised by Epstein and Barrow that he should.{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=84}} Lennon said that "if I had said television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it"{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=293}} but stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. He described his own belief in God by quoting the Bishop of Woolwich, saying, "not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us."{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} Adamant that he was not comparing himself with Christ, he tried to explain the decline of Christianity in the UK. Pressed for an apology by a reporter, he said: "if you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then OK, I'm sorry."{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=295}} Journalists gave a sympathetic response, and told Lennon that the [[Bible Belt]] were "quite notorious for their Christian attitude".{{sfn|Hewitt|2012|p=85}}

When the tour began, it was marred by protests and disturbances.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} Telephone threats were received, and concerts were picketed by the [[Ku Klux Klan]].{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}} ''[[Daily Express]]'' writer Robert Pitman, responding to the US outcry, wrote, "It seems a nerve for Americans to hold up shocked hands, when week in, week out, America is exporting to us a subculture that makes the Beatles seem like four stern old churchwardens."{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=340–341}} The reaction was also criticised in the US; a [[Kentucky]] radio station announced that it would give the Beatles' music airplay to show its "contempt for hypocrisy personified", and the [[Jesuit]] magazine ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'' wrote: "Lennon was simply stating what many a Christian educator would readily admit".{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=340–341}}

[[File:Mid-South Coliseum.jpg|left|thumb|During the Beatles' performance at [[Mid-South Coliseum]], [[Memphis, Tennessee]], on 19 August 1966, a firecracker was set off onstage.]]

The [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] city council, aware that a Beatles concert was scheduled at the [[Mid-South Coliseum]] during the tour, voted to cancel it rather than have "municipal facilities be used as a forum to ridicule anyone's religion", and also saying, "the Beatles are not welcome in Memphis".{{sfn|Wiener|1991|p=12}} The Ku Klux Klan nailed a Beatles album to a wooden cross, vowing "vengeance", with conservative groups staging further public burnings of Beatles records.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=340–341}} The Reverend Jimmy Stroad stated that a Christian rally in Memphis "would give the youth of the mid-South an opportunity to show Jesus Christ is more popular than the Beatles".{{sfn|Wiener|1991|p=11}} The Memphis shows did take place, on 19 August;{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=622}} the afternoon show went as planned, but there was a minor panic when a firecracker was set off on stage during the evening performance,&lt;ref name="BeatlesInterviewsorg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatlesinterviews.org/db1966.0819.beatles.html |title=Beatles Interview: Memphis, Tennessee |first=Jay |last=Spangler |publisher=Beatles Interviews |date=19 August 1966 |accessdate=2 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led the group to believe they were the target of gunfire.{{sfn|Gould|2008|pp=346–347}}

The Beatles hated the tour, partly due to the controversy and adverse reaction from Lennon's comments, and were unhappy about Epstein continuing to organise live performances that were increasingly at odds with their studio work.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=212–213}} The controversy had also overshadowed the US release of their 1966 album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]'',&lt;ref name="GilmoreAcidTest"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/beatles-revolver-how-lsd-opened-the-door-to-a-masterpiece-w436062 |first=Mikal|last=Gilmore |title=Beatles' Acid Test: How LSD Opened the Door to 'Revolver'|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=25 August 2016|accessdate=16 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the band considered to be their best and most mature musical statement up to that point.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2012|pp=xii, 174–75}} Following the tour, Harrison seriously contemplated leaving the group, but was persuaded to stay on the condition that the Beatles would from now on focus solely on their work as recording artists.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=213}} After a break, they reconvened in November 1966 to begin recording ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'', which was a major critical and commercial success when released in June 1967.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=350–351}} {{clear left}}

==Aftermath==
Lennon was asked about the controversy during a trip to [[Canada]] in 1969. He repeated his opinion that the Beatles were more influential on young people than Christ, adding that some ministers had agreed with him. He called the protestors in the US "fascist Christians", saying he was "very big on Christ. I've always fancied him. He was right."{{sfn|Harry|2000|p=412}} In 1978, he thanked Jesus for an end to the Beatles' touring, saying "if I hadn't said [that] and upset the very Christian Ku Klux Klan, well, Lord, I might still be up there with all the other performing fleas! God bless America. Thank you, Jesus."&lt;ref name="LennonIKnew"/&gt;

In 1993, [[Michael Medved]] wrote in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' that "today, comments like Lennon's could never cause controversy; a contemptuous attitude to religion is all but expected from all mainstream pop performers."{{sfn|Huq|2007|p=143}} In 1997, [[Noel Gallagher]] claimed that his band [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] was "bigger than God", but reaction was minimal.{{sfn|Huq|2007|p=143}}

In a 2008 article marking the 40th anniversary of the Beatles' double album ''[[The Beatles (album)|The Beatles]]'' (also known as the "White Album"), the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] newspaper, ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'', issued the statement:

{{blockquote|The remark by John Lennon, which triggered deep indignation, mainly in the United States, after many years sounds only like a "boast" by a young working-class Englishman faced with unexpected success, after growing up in the legend of [[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] and rock and roll. The fact remains that 38 years after breaking up, the songs of the Lennon-McCartney brand have shown an extraordinary resistance to the passage of time, becoming a source of inspiration for more than one generation of pop musicians.&lt;ref name=nyt-100413&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/arts/music/13arts-VATICANGETSA_BRF.html |title=Vatican Gets Around to Praising the Beatles |first=Dave|last=Itzkoff |work=The New York Times |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In response to the statement, Starr said "Didn't the Vatican say we were possibly Satanic, and they've still forgiven us? I think the Vatican's got more to talk about than the Beatles."&lt;ref name=inewp&gt;{{cite web| url=http://inewp.com/?tag=losservatore-romano |title=Vatican "Forgives" Beatles; Ringo Starr Says Bugger Off |work=iNEWP.com |date=15 April 2010 |accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn-100412&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-04-12/entertainment/ringo.starr.vatican.beatles_1_ringo-starr-vatican-satanic?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title=Ringo Starr: 'Vatican has more to talk about than the Beatles' |first=Phil |last=Han |publisher=CNN |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=3 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722135052/http://articles.cnn.com/2010-04-12/entertainment/ringo.starr.vatican.beatles_1_ringo-starr-vatican-satanic?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 14 April 2010 edition, ''L'Osservatore Romano'' responded to Starr's comments, stating that "John Lennon had no need of forgiveness from the Vatican, ''L'Osservatore Romano'' reprinted its 1966 article on John Lennon's comments. The 1966 ''L'Osservatore Romano'' article noted that Lennon had apologised for his comments and that fellow Beatle Paul McCartney had criticized them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholicculture.org/news/headlines/index.cfm?storyid=6019  "Vatican newspaper responds to Ringo Starr's dismissal of Beatles coverage"]. CatholicCulture.org, [[Catholic World News]]. 14 April 2010. Retrieved 18 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Starr said that he had now found religion, adding, "For me, God is in my life&amp;nbsp;... I think the search has been on since the 1960s."&lt;ref name="vatican"/&gt;

In 2012, the ''[[Houston Press]]'' music blog compared several aspects of popular media and concluded that Jesus is more popular than the Beatles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/music/seriously-are-the-beatles-more-popular-than-jesus-6513260|title=Seriously: Are the Beatles More Popular Than Jesus?|last=Smith

==Other mentions==
On 18 May 1968, Lennon summoned the other Beatles to a meeting at [[Apple Corps]] to announce that he was the living reincarnation of Jesus: "I have something very important to tell you all. I am Jesus Christ. I'm back again."{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=233}} The meeting was adjourned for lunch and Lennon never mentioned the subject again.{{sfn|Ingham|2003|p=262}} In May 1969, Lennon and McCartney recorded "[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]", with Lennon singing the lines, "Christ, you know it ain't easy, You know how hard it can be, The way things are going, They're gonna crucify me."{{sfn|Ingham|2003|p=262}} In a [[BBC]] interview a few months later, Lennon called himself "One of Christ's biggest fans", talked about the Church of England, his vision of heaven, and unhappiness over being unable to marry [[Yoko Ono]] in church.&lt;ref name="BiggestFans"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/2403617/Bigger-than-Jesus-The-Beatles-were-a-Christian-band.html |title=Bigger than Jesus?

On 3 December 1969,{{sfn|Cross|2005|p=296}} [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] and [[Tim Rice]] asked Lennon to play the part of Jesus in the stage production of ''[[Jesus Christ Superstar]]'', which he declined,{{sfn|Ingham|2003|p=262}} although he said he would have been interested if Ono could play the part of [[Mary Magdalene]].&lt;ref name="LennonPlayJesus"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Lennon Won't Play Jesus |newspaper=[[The Tuscaloosa News]] |page=2|date=5 December 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon mentioned Jesus again in his 1970 song "[[God (John Lennon song)|God]]", singing, "I don't believe in Jesus", but also sang that he did not believe in the [[Bible]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Gita]]'', and the Beatles.{{sfn|Wiener|1991|p=6}} Critics of Lennon's lyrics have also focused on the line "Imagine there's no heaven" from his 1971 song "[[Imagine (John Lennon song)|Imagine]]".{{sfn|Wiener|1991|p=161}}

Lennon was [[murder of John Lennon|murdered]] on 8 December 1980 by [[Mark David Chapman]], who had become a [[born-again Christian]] in 1970{{sfn|Jones|1992|p=115}} and was incensed by Lennon's "more popular than Jesus" remark, calling it [[blasphemy]]. He later stated that he was further enraged by the songs "God" and "Imagine", even singing the latter with the altered lyric: "Imagine John Lennon dead".{{sfn|Jones|1992|p=118}}

'''Nadhim Ramzi''' ({{lang-ar|ناظم رمزي}}; 14 July 1928 – 18 September 2013 from a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] family) was an Iraqi [[graphic designer]], [[calligrapher]], photographer, and painter best known for documenting life in Iraq from the 1950s by photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Photographer Bio |first= |title=Iraq, the land and the people|url=https://books.google.iq/books?id=KMqePQAACAAJ&amp;dq=iraq+the+land+and+the+people&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi54KD6gJ3SAhVGb5oKHSYKCroQ6AEIGjAA |agency=(1977) Iraqi Cultural Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career ==
Nadhim Ramzi was born in Baghdad into a family of Kurdish background. In his youth, Ramzi began to recognize the beauty of his natural environment and the local people in various parts of Iraq due to his father's constant movement. His father was administrative staff member during 1934–1944; Ramzi liked birds hunting and learned to draw them. He also loved the wilderness and the native people. Ramzi started to get involved and participate in a lot of hobbies that affected his future.&lt;ref name="Hamid"/&gt;

In Al-[[Yusufiyah]] he started practicing [[Islamic geometric patterns]] and became obsessed with it, and in [[Khan Bani Saad]] he found happiness in the life of the countryside and grazing sheep: "It was to this small village a great impact on my lifestyle and behavior. He watched artisans making carpets and ceramics, which aroused his interest in traditional design. He taught himself to paint at a very young age. &lt;ref name="moo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamid"/&gt;

And in [[Al-Mahawil District]] he got in touch with the ancient hills and ruins of the [[Babylonia]]n civilization, amazed and inspired by [[Art of Mesopotamia]] that has survived for decades.&lt;ref name="Hamid"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mai Muzaffar (25 September 2013)|first=|title=The Iraqi artist N.Ramzi:In love with the land and people|url=http://www.alquds.co.uk/?p=87224|date=|language=Arabic |agency=Al-Quds Al-Arabi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ramzi started photography as a hobby at the age of 16, when he received his first camera as a gift. "&lt;ref name="moo"&gt;{{cite news|last=  |first=|title=From the memory|url=|date=|agency=a book by N.Ramzi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview, Ramzi's good friend, Rifat Chidirji, described the photographer's approach:

{{block quote| Nadhim Ramzi was a very good friend of mine, and I knew of Latif Al-Ani's work through publications and exhibitions. They photographed with an attention to aesthetics, looking for beautiful compositions. I photographed things as they are. One day, I went out to take photographs with Nadhim Ramzi. We saw a bench. I immediately took several photographs, focusing on its structure. Ramzi went around it for about five minutes, and he ended up taking one image only. That was the difference between us. I documented quickly and moved on.&lt;ref&gt;Alsaden, A., "Capturing Evanescence: Rifat Chadirji and Balkis Sharara in conversation with Amin Alsaden," ''Ibraaz,'' 16 November 2016 [https://www.ibraaz.org/interviews/206 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Ramzi's Printing Company===
Ramzi's traveled to Paris in 1964 where he stayed for two years and was introduced to printing methods and its techniques, He founded a printing company in [[Baghdad]] and named it after his name,&lt;ref name="Hamid"/&gt; It was one of the best printing companies in Iraq, it was located near Al Rasheed Camp's main road. The company was established in 70s and founded by Ramzi himself. It offered a variety of printing products and services with a focus on quality, and service.&lt;ref name="nkad"/&gt;

It contained three main departments:&lt;ref name="nkad"&gt;{{cite news|last=  |first=|title=The departure of the Iraqi art|url=http://www.alnaked-aliraqi.net/article/18404.php|date=|language=Arabic |agency=Al Mada Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oliver Joseph St John Gogarty''' (17 August 1878 – 22 September 1957) was an Irish poet, author, [[otolaryngologist]], athlete, politician, and well-known conversationalist. He served as the inspiration for [[Buck Mulligan]] in [[James Joyce]]'s novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]''.

==Life==

===Early life===
Gogarty was born 17 August 1878 in [[Parnell Square|Rutland Square]], Dublin, the eldest child of Henry Gogarty, a well-to-do Dublin physician, and Margaret Gogarty (née Oliver), the daughter of a [[Galway]] mill owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://civilrecords.irishgenealogy.ie/churchrecords/details-civil/7adc675723754|title=General Registrar's Office|last=|first=|date=|website=IrishGenealogy.ie|publisher=|access-date=17 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three siblings (Henry, Mary, and Richard) were born later.  Gogarty's father, himself the son of a medical doctor, had been educated at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] and owned two fashionable homes in Dublin, which set the Gogartys apart from other [[Irish Catholic]] families at that time and allowed them access to the same social circles as the [[Protestant Ascendancy]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp.12-13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1887 Gogarty's father died of a [[Appendicitis|burst appendix]], and Gogarty was sent to [[Mungret College]], a boarding school near [[Limerick]]. He was unhappy in his new school, and the following year he transferred to [[Stonyhurst College]] in Lancashire, England, which he liked little better, later referring to it as "a religious jail".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= It Isn't This Time of Year at All! |last= Gogarty |first= Oliver |year= 1954 |publisher= Doubleday &amp; Company, Inc. |location= New York |page= 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty returned to Ireland in 1896 and boarded at [[Clongowes Wood College]] while studying for examinations with the [[Royal University of Ireland]]. He was a talented athlete; in England he had briefly played for the [[Preston North End FC]] Reserve, and while at [[Clongowes Wood College|Clongowes]] he played for the [[Bohemian FC]].  He also played on Clongowes's soccer and [[cricket]] elevens.  His extracurricular interests, which also included cycling and drinking, prevented him from being an attentive student, and in 1898 he switched to the medical school at [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]], having failed eight of his ten [[examinations]] at the [[Royal University of Ireland|Royal]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt;

===University days===
As one of [[Dublin]]'s "[[medical student|medicos]]", Gogarty was known to be fond of public [[pranks]]&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; and midnight carousing in "the Kips", Dublin's red-light district.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; He had a talent for [[light poetry|humorous]] and [[ribaldry|bawdy verse]], which quickly made the rounds through the city, and sometimes composed [[mnemonic]] lyrics to aid his [[medical school|medical studies]].  He also enjoyed a highly successful cycling career before being banned from the tracks in 1901 for bad language, and between 1898 and 1901 he rescued at least four people from drowning.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 24–25, 39&lt;/ref&gt; He became interested in [[Irish nationalism]] after meeting [[Arthur Griffith]] in 1899, and contributed propaganda pieces to ''[[United Irishman|The United Irishman]]'' over subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:OSJGogarty1897.jpg|thumb|left|Gogarty in 1897]]

A serious interest in poetry and literature also began to manifest itself during his years at Trinity.  His witty conversation made him a favourite with the [[university don|dons]], particularly [[John Pentland Mahaffy]] (formerly the tutor of [[Oscar Wilde]]) and [[Robert Yelverton Tyrrell]], and between 1901 and 1903 he won three successive Vice-Chancellor's prizes for verse.  In 1900 he made the acquaintance of [[W. B. Yeats]] (of whom his mother highly approved) and of [[George Moore (novelist)|George Moore]] (of whom she did not) and began to frequent [[Celtic revival|Dublin literary circles]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt; He also formed close friendships with other up-and-coming young poets, such as [[Seamus O'Sullivan]] and [[James Joyce]].  In 1904 he spent two [[academic term|terms]] at [[Oxford]] to compete for the [[Newdigate Prize]], but lost to [[George Bell (bishop)|G.K.A. Bell]], the future [[Bishop of Chichester]], who became a friend and frequent correspondent over the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp71-75&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Joyce Martello Tower.jpg|thumb|right|The Tower in Sandycove]]

Upon returning to Dublin in the summer of 1904, Gogarty made arrangements to rent the famous [[James Joyce Tower|Martello Tower in Sandycove]].  The primary goal of this scheme, as described by Gogarty in a letter to G.K.A. Bell, was to "house the Bard" (i.e. James Joyce), who was without money and required "a year in which to finish his novel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Many Lines to Thee |last= Carens |first= James |year= 1972 |publisher= Dolmen Press |location= Dublin |page= 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two friends quarrelled in August, however, and Joyce either failed to move in or left shortly after doing so.  Joyce briefly took up residence in the [[James Joyce Tower|Tower]] the following month, together with Gogarty and his Oxford friend Samuel Chenevix Trench (a setup which later provided inspiration for the opening chapter of ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]])'' but left again suddenly after only six days.&lt;ref&gt;Ellman, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; Forty years later in America, Gogarty would attribute Joyce's abrupt departure to his and S.C. Trench's midnight antics with a loaded [[revolver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Mourning Became Mrs. Spendlove |last= Gogarty |first= Oliver |year= 1948 |publisher= Creative Age Press |location= New York |pages= 56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joyce and Gogarty corresponded intermittently during the early years of Joyce's continental exile and occasionally planned meetings, but contemporaneous letters from Joyce to his brother reveal deep distrust of Gogarty's motives,&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, p. 842&lt;/ref&gt; and their friendship was never fully renewed.  Gogarty made use of the Martello Tower during the following year as a writing retreat and party venue, and officially held the lease until 1925.

In 1904 and 1905 Gogarty published several short poems in the London publication ''The Venture'' and in [[William Kirkpatrick Magee|John Eglinton]]'s journal ''Dana''.&lt;ref&gt;Carens (1979) p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; His name also appeared in print as the renegade priest Fr. Oliver Gogarty in George Moore's 1905 novel ''The Lake'', an occurrence which upset Gogarty's devout mother.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905 Gogarty became one of the founding members of [[Arthur Griffith]]'s [[Sinn Féin]], a [[nonviolent revolution|non-violent political movement]] with a plan for Irish autonomy modelled after the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian dual monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical career and family===
[[File:Nollgogarty.jpg|thumb|right|Noll Gogarty, painted by [[William Orpen]]]]
In August 1906, Gogarty married Martha Duane, a girl from a landowning [[Connemara]] family.  Eager to establish himself with a profession, he passed his final medical examinations in June 1907, several months after the death of his mother.  In July 1907 his first son, Oliver Duane Odysseus Gogarty (known as "Noll") was born, and in autumn of that year Gogarty left for [[Vienna]] to finish the practical phase of his medical training.  Owing in part to the influence of his mentor, [[Robert Henry Woods|Sir Robert Woods]], Gogarty had decided to specialise in [[otolaryngology]], and in [[Vienna]] he studied under [[Ottokar Chiari]], Markus Hajek, and [[Robert Bárány]].

Returning to Dublin in 1908, Gogarty secured a post at Richmond Hospital, and shortly afterwards purchased a house in Ely Place opposite George Moore.  Three years later, he joined the staff of the [[Meath Hospital]] and remained there for the remainder of his medical career.  He became known for flamboyant theatrics in the [[operating room]], including off-the-cuff witticisms and the flinging of recently removed [[larynx]]es at the viewing gallery.  He also maintained [[otolaryngology|ENT]] consulting rooms in [[Ely Place]], attracting a number of wealthy clients and attending to less well-off patients for free.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 113–127&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty and his wife went on to have two more children, [[Dermot St. John Gogarty|Dermot]] (born 1908) and Brenda (born 1911), and in 1917 Gogarty purchased Renyvle House, a large [[country house]] in [[Renvyle]], [[Connemara]].  He became a keen [[motorist]] during this time, purchasing a succession of [[cars]] that culminated with a buttercup-coloured [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls Royce]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; During the following decade he was also interested in aviation, earning a [[pilot's licence]] and helping to found the Irish Aero Club.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt;

===Free State Senator===
As a [[Sinn Féin]]er during the [[Irish War of Independence]], Gogarty participated in a variety of anti-[[Black and Tans|Black and Tan]] schemes, allowing his home to be used as a [[safe house]] and transporting disguised [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] volunteers in his car.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 173–174&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[ratification]] of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], Gogarty sided with the [[Irish Free State|pro-Treaty government]] (headed by his close friend [[Arthur Griffith]]) and was made a [[Seanad Éireann|Free State Senator]].&lt;ref name=oireachtas_db&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=1&amp;HouseNum=1922&amp;MemberID=1338&amp;ConstID=214|title=Dr. Oliver St. John Gogarty|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Griffith fell ill during the summer of 1922, Gogarty frequently attended his bedside.  His death on 12 August 1922 had a profound effect on Gogarty; W.T. Cosgrave later observed that "he was almost mortally wounded when Griffith died, he was so very, very much attached to him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Irish Literary Portraits |last= Rodgers |first= William |year= 1973 |publisher= Taplinger Publishers |location= New York |page= 153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gogarty carried out Griffith's official [[autopsy]] and [[embalmment]], and went on to perform the same offices for [[Michael Collins (Irish leader)|Michael Collins]], another close friend whom Gogarty had often sheltered in his Ely Place home prior to his assassination.  It was rumoured that Griffith had been planning to make Gogarty the new [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]], but in his absence the post went to [[Timothy Michael Healy|Tim Healy]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gogarty1922.jpg|thumb|left|Gogarty in 1922]]

In November 1922, anti-Treaty [[Irish Republican Army|IRA]] commander [[Liam Lynch (Irish republican)|Liam Lynch]] issued a general order to his forces to shoot [[Seanad Éireann|Free State Senators]].  Two months later, Gogarty was [[Kidnapping|kidnapped]] by a group of anti-Treaty militants, who lured him out of his house and into a waiting car under the pretext of bringing him to visit a sick patient.  Gogarty was subsequently driven to an empty house near [[Chapelizod]] and held under armed guard.  Aware that he might be in imminent danger of execution, Gogarty contrived to have himself led out into the garden (purportedly by claiming to be suffering from [[diarrhoea]]), where he broke free from his captors and flung himself into the [[River Liffey|Liffey]]; he then swam to shore and delivered himself to the protection of the police barracks in [[Phoenix Park]].  In February of that same year, [[Destruction of Irish country houses (1919-1923)|Renvyle was burnt to the ground]] by anti-Treaty forces.  Following these incidents, Gogarty relocated his family and practice to London, where he resided until February 1924.  Upon returning to Ireland, he famously released two swans into the [[River Liffey]] in gratitude for his life.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 194–199&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty remained a senator until the abolition of the [[Seanad Éireann|Seanad]] in 1936, during which time he identified with none of the existing political parties and voted according to his own whims.  He believed that Ireland should retain its dominion status in the [[British Commonwealth]] so as to "keep with nations who understand that the first principle of freedom is a freedom that does not permit interference with the personal liberties of the citizen."  He supported rural electrification schemes, road improvement, [[reforestation]] and [[Conservation movement|conservation]], prevention of livestock cruelty, and [[educational reform]].  His views on controversial issues such as censorship and [[birth control]] were ambiguous; after expressing initial support for the Censorship Bill, he eventually went on to denounce it in scathing terms ("I think it is high time the men of this country found some other way of loving God than by hating women"), and while generally professing to oppose the sale of prophylactics, he voiced support for their usage in certain cases.  He was most passionate on the subject of sanitation in schools and in urban and rural housing, about which he spoke frequently.&lt;ref&gt;Carens (1979) pp.112–113&lt;/ref&gt; His speeches frequently contained [[pun]]s, wordplays, and extended poetic quotations, and were sometimes given in favour of facetious schemes, such as his attempt to have the [[Phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]] statue in [[Phoenix Park]] included in the 1929 Wild Birds Protection Bill.&lt;ref&gt;Historical Debates Website. Seanad Éireann Wild Birds Protection Bill, 1929—Report. Tithe an Oireachteas. 19 August 2009. {{cite web |url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0013/S.0013.192912120007 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607135429/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0013/S.0013.192912120007 |archivedate=7 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was notoriously scornful of the government's attempts to reinstate the [[Irish language]] (which he referred to as "Woolworth's Irish"), proposing that funding be used instead for housing and school health services,&lt;ref&gt;Historical Debates Website.

[[Éamon de Valera|De Valera]] eventually dissolved the Seanad when it persisted in obstructing Government proposals, effectively ending Gogarty's political career.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp.246–254&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literary endeavours===
Gogarty maintained close friendships with [[W. B. Yeats]], [[George William Russell|AE]], George Moore, [[Lord Dunsany]], [[James Stephens (author)|James Stephens]], [[Seamus O'Sullivan]], and other Dublin literati, and continued to write poetry in the midst of his political and professional duties.  Three small books of poetry (''Hyperthuleana'', ''Secret Springs of Dublin Song'', and ''The Ship and Other Poems'') were published between 1916 and 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 31–37&lt;/ref&gt; Gogarty also tried his hand at [[playwriting]], producing a slum drama (''[[Blight (play)|Blight]]'') in 1917 under the pseudonym "Alpha and Omega", and two comedies (''A Serious Thing'' and ''The Enchanted Trousers'') in 1919 under the pseudonym "[[Gideon Ouseley]]", all three of which were performed at the [[Abbey Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 42–46&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty devoted less energy to his medical practice and more to his writing during the twenties and thirties.  His 1924 book of poetry ''An Offering of Swans'' won the Gold Medal for poetry at the revived [[Tailteann Games (Irish Free State)|Tailteann Games]], for which he also wrote the 1924 Olympic bronze medal-winning ''Tailteann Ode'' (which he was later to describe as "rather tripe").&lt;ref&gt;Carens, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; In 1929 another book of verse, ''Wild Apples'', was published, and was followed in 1933 by ''Selected Poems''.  Gogarty was also a member of [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]]'s Irish Academy of Letters and frequently assisted in arranging its social functions.  1936 saw the publication of [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]]'s ''[[Oxford Book of Modern Verse]]'', which contained seventeen of Gogarty's poems and an introduction proclaiming him "one of the great lyric poets of our age."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The over-representation given to Gogarty outraged many poets and perplexed Gogarty himself, who remarked, "What right have I to figure so bulkily?  None from a poetical point of view... [[Sappho]] herself could not have made a more subjective anthology."&lt;ref&gt;Carens, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 Gogarty published his first prose work, ''[[As I Was Going Down Sackville Street]]'' (subtitled "A Phantasy in Fact"), a semi-fictional novel-memoir that tells, in reverse chronological order, the story of Gogarty's Dublin through a series of interconnected anecdotes and lively characters sketches.  Shortly after its publication, it became the subject of a lawsuit by a Jewish [[art dealer]], Harry Sinclair, who claimed that he and his recently deceased twin brother, William Sinclair, had been [[libel]]ed by the publication.  The two men did not appear as named characters in the book, but some derogatory lines of verse beginning ''"Two Jews grew in Sackville Street"'', written by Gogarty's friend George Redding and included in a scene in the novel, were widely known to refer to the Sinclair siblings.  Harry Sinclair further recognised a reference to his grandfather, described in the text as one who "enticed little girls into his office", an offence of which his grandfather had in fact been convicted.  Gogarty responded to the charges by claiming that the unnamed Jews were parodies or composite characters rather than deliberate evocations of living persons.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp.280–283&lt;/ref&gt; The case attracted a great deal of public attention, with one commentator observing that "only ''[[The Pickwick Papers]]'', rewritten by James Joyce, could really capture the mood of this trial."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; Among the witnesses for the prosecution was William Sinclair's nephew-by-marriage, [[Samuel Beckett]], then a little-known writer, who was humiliatingly denounced as a "bawd and blasphemer" by Gogarty's counsel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Damned to Fame: The Life of Samuel Beckett |last= Knowlson |first= James |year= 1996 |publisher= Bloomsbury |location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gogarty ultimately lost the lawsuit and was ordered to pay £900 in damages, plus court costs.  This outcome deeply embittered Gogarty, who had already suffered financial setbacks after the [[stock market crash of 1929]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= W. B. Yeats: A Life, Vol. II: The Arch-Poet 1915–1939 |last= Foster |first= Robert |year= 2003 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |page= 405}}&lt;/ref&gt; and felt that the verdict had been politically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the ''Sackville Street'' imbroglio, Gogarty's output over the next two years was prolific.  In 1938 he published ''I Follow St. Patrick'', a historical and geographic portrait of Ireland as told through Gogarty's rambling visits to various sites traditionally associated with [[St. Patrick]]; in 1939 he published ''Tumbling in the Hay'', a semi-autobiographical comic novel about medical students in turn-of-the-century Dublin, and ''Elbow Room'', another collection of poetry.  In 1938 he relocated to London for a second time and brought forth his own libel suit against the young poet [[Patrick Kavanagh]], whose autobiography ''The Green Fool'' said of [[Patrick Kavanagh|Kavanagh]]'s first visit to Gogarty's home: "I mistook Gogarty's white-robed maid for his wife or his mistress; I expected every poet to have a spare wife."  Gogarty, who had taken offence at the close coupling of the words "wife" and "mistress", was awarded £100 in damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Patrick Kavanagh |last= O'Brien |first= Darcy |year= 1975 |publisher= Bucknell University Press |location= Lewisburg |page= 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American years===
With the onset of [[World War II]], Gogarty, who was an enthusiastic and talented amateur [[aviator]], attempted to enlist in the [[RAF]] and the [[RAMC]] as a doctor.  He was denied on grounds of age.  He then departed in September 1939 for an extended lecture tour in the United States, leaving his wife to manage Renvyle House, which had since been rebuilt as a hotel.  When his return to Ireland was delayed by the war, Gogarty applied for [[American citizenship]], and eventually decided to reside permanently in the United States.  Though he regularly sent letters, funds, and care-packages to his family and returned home for occasional holiday visits, he never again lived in Ireland for any extended length of time.  His primary American residence was in New York, where he was known to frequent bars on [[Third Avenue]]. He also spent time in [[Vermont]] and in Wyckoff, [[New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Renvyle Letters |last= Williams |first= Guy |year= 2000 |publisher= Daletta Press |location= Monasterevan |pages= 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feeling that he was too old to sit for the medical examinations that would have qualified him as a practitioner in the United States, Gogarty instead chose to support himself entirely by his writing.  In addition to various essays and short stories, his prose output included ''Going Native'', a satire on English social mores, ''Mad Grandeur'' and ''Mr. Petunia'', two period narratives composed with an eye to having them optioned as Hollywood films, and ''Rolling Down the Lea'' and ''It Isn't This Time of Year at All!'', two loosely constructed memoirs.  He also published two books of poems, ''Perennial'' and ''Unselected Poems''; a collection of bawdy verse, ''The Merry Muses of Hibernia'', was planned but never completed.  Gogarty's literary output during the forties and fifties is generally considered to be inferior to his earlier writings.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Gogarty suffered from heart complaints during the last few years of his life, and in September 1957 he collapsed in the street on his way to dinner.  He died on 22 September 1957; his body was flown home to Ireland and buried in Cartron Church, Moyard, near Renvyle.

==Literary portrayal==
[[File:Revolutionary Joyce Better Contrast.jpg|thumb|right|James Joyce]]
A highly visible and distinctive [[Dublin]] character during his lifetime, Gogarty appears in a number of memoirs penned by his contemporaries, notably George Moore's ''Hail and Farewell'', where he goes both by his own name and by the pseudonym "Conan."&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, pp. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous literary incarnation, however, is as [[Buck Mulligan]], the irrepressible roommate of [[Stephen Dedalus]] in James Joyce's ''Ulysses''.  Mulligan quotes a number of songs and poems known to have been written by Gogarty,&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 25–26&lt;/ref&gt; the most famous of which, [[The Ballad of Japing Jesus|"The Song of the Cheerful (But Slightly Sarcastic) Jesus"]], was originally sent to Joyce as a belated Christmas peace offering after their quarrels of 1904.&lt;ref&gt;Ellmann, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; Other details, such as Mulligan's [[Hellenism (neoclassicism)|Hellenism]], his status as a medical student, his history of saving men from drowning, his friendship with George Moore, and the metrical arrangement of his full name (Malachi Roland St. John Mulligan) parallel Gogarty's biography.   Due to his influence on Joyce (he is also sometimes cited as an inspiration for ''[[Dubliners]]'' character Ignatius Gallaher and ''[[Exiles (play)|Exiles]]'' antagonist Robert Hand), Gogarty's name often comes up in Joyce scholarship, though Gogarty's own editors and biographers have complained that these references are frequently inaccurate, owing to Gogarty-related errata in [[James Joyce (biography)|Richard Ellmann's ''James Joyce'']] and a tendency to conflate the real-life Gogarty with the fictional character of Buck Mulligan.&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 10–21&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested{{who|date=November 2012}} that the speaker of W. B. Yeats's poem ''High Talk'', "Malachi Stilt-Jack", is intended to be a representation of Gogarty.&lt;ref&gt;Carens, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A pub in the [[Temple Bar, Dublin|Temple Bar]] district of Dublin is named after him, and an annual Oliver St. John Gogarty Literary Festival is held in the author's family home, now the Renvyle House Hotel in [[Connemara]]. A surgical ward in the descendant hospital of his workplace, the [[Tallaght Hospital|AMNCH]], now also bears his name.

'''Penoyre &amp; Prasad''' is an architectural practice based in London. It was established in 1988&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newlondonarchitecture.org/organisation.php?id=43&amp;name=penoyre_prasad_llp New London Architecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929010213/http://www.newlondonarchitecture.org/organisation.php?id=43&amp;name=penoyre_prasad_llp |date=2011-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Sunand Prasad]] and [[Greg Penoyre]]. The practice has an interest in low energy and sustainability. In 2007 Sunand Prasad became president of the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtpi.org.uk/item/1094/23/5/3 Royal Town Planning Institute press release 2 August 2007]{{broken citation|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice has designed many public buildings, with the Richard Desmond Children's Eye Centre at London's [[Moorfields Eye Hospital]] winning the World Architecture News Healthcare Building of the Year 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arup.com/News/2009-07%20July/02-07-09-Richard_Desmonds_Childrens_Eye_Centre_Named_Healthcare_Building_Of_The_Year.aspx Arup press release 2 July 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2006 [[Ashburton Learning Village]] in Croydon includes many  sustainable design features.&lt;ref&gt;Architecture Today 172, October 2006{{full|date=September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of the practice was published in a 2007 book titled: Transformations: the architecture of Penoyre &amp; Prasad.

'''Richard Lawrence Bartholomew''' (1926–1985) was an Indian art critic, photographer, painter, poet, and writer.

==Early life==
Richard Bartholomew fled from [[Tavoy]] (Dawei), Burma ([[Myanmar]]), where he was born, during the [[Second World War]]. To escape the Japanese capture of Burma and the imminent persecution on account of their Christian names, Bartholomew fled with his family, walking the General Stilwell Road from [[Mandalay]] to [[Ledo, Assam|Ledo]] in upper [[Assam]], India.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} His schooling at [[Basic Education High School No. 6 Botataung|St. Paul's School]] in [[Rangoon]] (Yangon) was interrupted because of the Japanese invasion and Bartholomew finished high school at Delhi's Cambridge School.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} He received his bachelor's and master's degree from [[St. Stephen's College, Delhi]] in 1950. While at St. Stephens, he met Rati Batra, his future wife, who was herself a refugee from [[Pakistan]] who came to India during the [[Partition of India|Partition]] in 1947. Bartholomew lived in India as a stateless citizen until 1967 when he gained Indian citizenship, thereby closing all possibilities of returning to Burma which had become a dictatorship from the early–1960s.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Photographer, painter, poet==
Bartholomew pursued a career not only as an art critic but also as a writer, poet, painter, and curator.&lt;ref name="Critic's Choice: The Art Critic Richard Bartholomew"&gt;Pankaj Mullick. "Critic's Choice: The Art Critic Richard Bartholomew." ''Hindustan Times'', Delhi, September 23, 2012. [http://www.hindustantimes.com/books/critics-choice/story-EDIvWkFzezZYpgFQv9v3DO.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Solo shows of his work were held in Delhi and Bombay in the 1950s. Between then and the 1970s, he documented life around him through photography. Though he rarely exhibited his photographic work during his lifetime, his pictures intimately portrayed his family and his circle of artist friends and associates and his travels in India and the US.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Art critic and writer==
Bartholomew was a pioneering art critic in that he was one of the first to initiate dialogues with painters. He fostered a sense of community within the artists and communicated their ideals to the public who were not entirely receptive or convinced of the daring, artistic exploration of India's [[Bombay Progressive Artists' Group|Progressive Art Movement]].

Through numerous reviews published from the early–1950s until the late–1970s in publications like ''[[The Indian Express]]'', ''[[The Times of India]]'', and ''Thought'', Bartholomew documented the artistic trajectories of painters such as [[Francis Newton Souza]], [[Tyeb Mehta]], [[Manishi Dey]], Biren De, [[Ram Kumar (artist)|Ram Kumar]], Krishen Khanna, [[Akbar Padamsee]], [[SH Raza]], [[Sailoz Mookherjea]], [[Bhupen Khakkar]], [[Satish Gujral]]; sculptors like [[Ramkinkar Baij]], Dhanraj Bhagat, Chintamoni Kar, [[Somnath Hore]], [[Sankho Chaudhuri]]; graphic artists including Kanwal Krishna, Devayani Krishna, [[Krishna Reddy (artist)|Krishna Reddy]], [[Jagmohan Chopra]], [[Jyoti Bhatt]] as well as renowned photographers [[Raghu Rai]] and TS Satyan.&lt;ref name="Critic's Choice: The Art Critic Richard Bartholomew"/&gt;

Besides a series of articles on Indian and [[Tibetan art]], Bartholomew also co-authored, [http://openlibrary.org/b/OL7997371M/Husain/ Husain], a monograph on [[M.F. Husain]] which was published by [[Harry Abrams]], New York in 1972. In 1974, he published a monograph on [[Krishna Reddy (artist)|Krishna Reddy]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}} He also wrote poems and short stories which were published in magazines including ''Thought'' and ''[[The Illustrated Weekly of India|Illustrated Weekly]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Gallerist and curator==
Bartholomew was the Gallery Director of Kunika-Chemould, New Delhi's first contemporary art gallery. Subsequently, from 1966–1973, he worked with the [http://www.tibethousenewdelhi.org/ Tibet House], New Delhi as their curator and development officer where he catalogued the [[Dalai Lama]]'s collection of religious artefacts and travelled with them to the US and Japan. He was also the recipient of the [[Asian Cultural Council]]'s [[John D. Rockefeller 3rd]] Award in 1970. He was appointed Commissioner of the Silver Jubilee of Indian Independence exhibition held in Washington DC in 1973 and travelled to UK in 1982 as a [[British Council]] Visitor and as Commissioner of the Festival of India Exhibition held in Britain in 1982, during which he co-curated the exhibition ''[[Contemporary Indian Art (Exhibition)|Contemporary Indian Art]]'' at the Royal Academy of Arts with [[Geeta Kapur]] and [[Akbar Padamsee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Contemporary Indian Art|last=Kapur|first=Geeta|publisher=Indian Advisory Committee, Festival of India, U.K.|year=1982|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bartholomew served as the Secretary of the [[Lalit Kala Akademi]] from 1977 to 1985.

Barely 58, Bartholomew died in 1985. He is survived by his wife Rati Bartholomew and his two sons [[Pablo Bartholomew|Pablo]] and Robin.

Gaudí's work on the building is part of a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]],&lt;ref name=UNESCO/&gt; and in November 2010 [[Pope Benedict&amp;nbsp;XVI]] consecrated and proclaimed it a [[minor basilica]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alexander |last=Drummer |url=http://www.zenit.org/article-29981?l=english |title=Pontiff to Proclaim Gaudí's Church a Basilica |publisher=ZENIT |date=23 July 2010 |accessdate=7 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925095015/http://www.zenit.org/article-29981?l=english |archivedate=25 September 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://press.catholica.va/news_services/press/vis/dinamiche/b2_en.htm |title=The Pope Consecrates The Church of the Sagrada Familia |publisher=Vatican Information Service |location=[[Vatican City]] |date=7 November 2010 |accessdate=11 November 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uAAUTwy8?url=http://press.catholica.va/news_services/press/vis/dinamiche/b2_en.htm |archivedate=11 November 2010 |deadurl=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CNSvisit"&gt;{{cite web |date=4 March 2010 |title=Pope to visit Santiago de Compostela, Barcelona in November |author=Delaney, Sarah |publisher=[[Catholic News Service]] |url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1000887.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20100407164905/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/1000887.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 April 2010 |accessdate=7 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as distinct from a [[cathedral]], which must be the seat of a bishop.

In 1882, construction of Sagrada Família started under architect [[Francisco de Paula del Villar]]. In 1883, when Villar resigned,&lt;ref name= UNESCO/&gt; Gaudí took over as chief architect, transforming the project with his architectural and engineering style, combining [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and curvilinear [[Art Nouveau]] forms. Gaudí devoted the remainder of his life to the project, and he is buried in the crypt. At the time of his death at age 73 in 1926, when he was run down by a streetcar, less than a quarter of the project was complete.&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;

Relying solely on private donations, Sagrada Familia's construction progressed slowly and was interrupted by the [[Spanish Civil War]], only to resume intermittent progress in the 1950s. Since commencing construction in 1882, advancements in technologies such as [[computer aided design]] and computerised [[numerical control]] (CNC) have enabled faster progress and construction passed the midpoint in 2010. However, some of the project's greatest challenges remain, including the construction of ten more spires, each symbolising an important [[List of major biblical figures|Biblical figure]] in the [[New Testament]].&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt; It is anticipated that the building can be completed by 2026—the centenary of Gaudí's death. 

The basilica has a long history of dividing the citizens of Barcelona: over the initial possibility it might compete with [[Cathedral of Santa Eulalia|Barcelona's cathedral]], over Gaudí's design itself, over the possibility that work after Gaudí's death disregarded his design,&lt;ref name="nyt3"/&gt; and the 2007 proposal to build an underground tunnel of Spain's [[AVE|high-speed rail]] link to France which could disturb its stability.&lt;ref name="nyt4"&gt;{{cite news| title = Warning: Trains Coming.

==History==
[[File:Inside Sagrada familia - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|300px|left|A model of the completed church]]

===Background===
The Basilica of the Sagrada Família was the inspiration of a bookseller, Josep Maria Bocabella, founder of Asociación Espiritual de Devotos de San José (Spiritual Association of Devotees of St. Joseph).&lt;ref name=gbc&gt;The Gaudí &amp; Barcelona Club [http://www.gaudiclub.com/ingles/i_vida/i_sagr.html Sagrada Família]&lt;/ref&gt;

After a visit to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] in 1872, Bocabella returned from Italy with the intention of building a church inspired by [[Basilica della Santa Casa|the basilica]] at [[Loreto, Marche|Loreto]].&lt;ref name=gbc/&gt; The apse crypt of the church, funded by donations, was begun 19 March 1882, on the festival of St. Joseph, to the design of the architect [[Francisco de Paula del Villar y Lozano|Francisco de Paula del Villar]], whose plan was for a [[Gothic revival]] church of a standard form.&lt;ref name=gbc/&gt; The apse crypt was completed before Villar's resignation on 18 March 1883, when Gaudí assumed responsibility for its design, which he changed radically.&lt;ref name=gbc/&gt; Antoni Gaudí began work on the church in 1883 but was not appointed Architect Director until 1884.

===Construction===
[[File:Sagrada familia construction differences.jpg|thumb|New stonework at the Sagrada Família is clearly visible against the stained and weathered older sections.]]
On the subject of the extremely long construction period, Gaudí is said to have remarked: "My client is not in a hurry."&lt;ref name="Time"/&gt; When Gaudí died in 1926, the basilica was between 15 and 25 percent complete.&lt;ref name="nyt1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt2"&gt;{{cite news | title = ARCHITECTURE: Gaudí's Unfinished Masterpiece Is Virtually Complete | journal=The New York Times|first=Valerie|last= Gladstone|date= 22 August 2004 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/22/arts/architecture-gaudi-s-unfinished-masterpiece-is-virtually-complete.html?scp=10&amp;sq=gaudi%20sagrada%20familia&amp;st=cse}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Gaudí's death, work continued under the direction of [[Domènec Sugrañes i Gras]] until interrupted by the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936.

Parts of the unfinished basilica and Gaudí's models and workshop were destroyed during the war by [[Anarchist Catalonia|Catalan anarchists]]. The present design is based on reconstructed versions of the plans that were burned in a fire as well as on modern adaptations. Since 1940 the architects Francesc Quintana, [[Isidre Puig Boada]], Lluís Bonet i Gari and Francesc Cardoner have carried on the work. The illumination was designed by [[Carles Buïgas]].
The current director and son of Lluís Bonet, Jordi Bonet i Armengol, has been introducing computers into the design and construction process since the 1980s. [[Mark Burry]] of New Zealand serves as Executive Architect and Researcher. Sculptures by [[J. Busquets]], [[Etsuro Sotoo]] and the controversial [[Josep Maria Subirachs]] decorate the fantastical façades. Barcelona-born Jordi Fauli took over as chief architect in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Completion Date for Sagrada Família, Helped by Technology|url = http://www.architectmagazine.com/technology/a-completion-date-for-sagrada-familia-helped-by-technology_o|website = Architect|accessdate = 9 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The central [[nave]] [[Vault (architecture)|vaulting]] was completed in 2000 and the main tasks since then have been the construction of the [[transept]] vaults and [[apse]]. {{As of|2006}}, work concentrated on the crossing and supporting structure for the main tower of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]] as well as the southern enclosure of the central nave, which will become the Glory façade.

The church shares its site with the [[Sagrada Família Schools]] building, a school originally designed by Gaudí in 1909 for the children of the construction workers. Relocated in 2002 from the eastern corner of the site to the southern corner, the building now houses an exhibition.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

[[File:SagradaFamiliaRoof2.jpg|thumb|Base of the Christ Tower under construction (2009).]]

Chief architect Jordi Fauli announced in October 2015 that construction is 70 percent complete and has entered its final phase of raising six immense towers. The towers and most of the church's structure are to be completed by 2026, the centennial of Gaudí's death; decorative elements should be complete by 2030 or 2032. Visitor entrance fees of 15–20 euros finance the annual construction budget of 25{{nbsp}}million euros .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Barcelona's La Sagrada Familia Basilica enters final years of construction|url = http://www.torontosun.com/2015/10/22/barcelonas-la-sagrada-familia-basilica-enters-final-years-of-construction|website = Toronto Sun|accessdate = 9 November 2015|first = Joseph|last = Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CAD/CAM|Computer-aided design]] technology has been used to accelerate construction of the building. Current technology allows stone to be shaped off-site by a [[Numerical control|CNC milling]] machine, whereas in the 20th century the stone was carved by hand.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, Paul ({{Nowrap|January 2009}}).

===AVE tunnel===
Since 2013, [[AVE]] high-speed trains have passed near the Sagrada Família through an underground tunnel that runs beneath the centre of Barcelona.

The tunnel's construction, which began on 26 March 2010, was controversial. The Ministry of Public Works of Spain (''Ministerio de Fomento'') claimed the project posed no risk to the church.&lt;ref name="tbm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=ADIF (Administrator of Railway Infrastructures)|title=Madrid&amp;nbsp;– Zaragoza Barcelona&amp;nbsp;– French Border Line Barcelona Sants-Sagrera&amp;nbsp;– high-speed tunnel|url=http://www.adif.es/en_US/infraestructuras/lineas_de_alta_velocidad/madrid_barcelona_frontera_francesa/tunel_sagrera.shtml|accessdate=9 November 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621024109/http://www.adif.es/en_US/infraestructuras/lineas_de_alta_velocidad/madrid_barcelona_frontera_francesa/tunel_sagrera.shtml|archivedate=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sagrada Família engineers and architects disagreed, saying there was no guarantee that the tunnel would not affect the stability of the building. The Board of the Sagrada Família (''Patronat de la Sagrada Família'') and the neighborhood association ''AVE pel Litoral'' (AVE by the Coast) had led a campaign against this route for the AVE, without success.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

In October 2010, the [[tunnel boring machine]] reached the church underground under the location of the building's principal façade.&lt;ref name="tbm"&gt;{{cite news|last=Comorera|first=Ramon |title=La tuneladora del AVE perfora ya a cuatro metros de la Sagrada Família |trans-title=The tunnel boring machine of the AVE is already excavating four meters from the Sagrada Família |url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/barcelona/20101013/sagrada-familia-pasa-primer-test-del-ave/530676.shtml|accessdate=9 November 2010|newspaper=El Periódico de Catalunya|date=13 October 2010 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Service through the tunnel was inaugurated on 8 January 2013.&lt;ref name="AVEopen"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/sociedad/ave-alcanza-girona-2288906| title= El AVE alcanza Girona| accessdate=8 January 2013| date= 8 January 2013| newspaper= [[El Periódico de Catalunya]]| language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Track in the tunnel makes use of a system by [[Edilon Sedra]] in which the rails are embedded in an elastic material to dampen vibrations.&lt;ref name="Periodico_2012-03-11A"&gt;{{cite news|last=Comorera|first=Ramon |title=Doble aislante de vibraciones en las obras de Gaudí|trans-title=Double Isolation of Vibrations at the Gaudí constructions|url=http://www.elperiodico.com/es/noticias/barcelona/doble-aislante-vibraciones-las-obras-gaudi-1526442|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=El Periódico de Catalunya|date=12 March 2012 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; No damage to the Sagrada Família has been reported to date.

Accessed September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
[[File:Σαγράδα Φαμίλια 2941.jpg|thumb|right|East view, with the Nativity façade (2017)]]

The style of la Sagrada Família is variously likened to [[Spanish Gothic architecture|Spanish Late Gothic]], [[Catalan Modernism]] and to [[Art Nouveau]] or Catalan [[Noucentisme]]. While the Sagrada Família falls within the Art Nouveau period, [[Nikolaus Pevsner]] points out that, along with [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]] in Glasgow, Gaudí carried the Art Nouveau style far beyond its usual application as a surface decoration.&lt;ref name=Pevsner/&gt;

===Plan===
While never intended to be a [[cathedral]] (seat of a bishop), the Sagrada Família was planned from the outset to be a cathedral-sized building.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Its ground-plan has obvious links to earlier Spanish cathedrals such as [[Burgos Cathedral]], [[León Cathedral]] and [[Seville Cathedral]]. In common with Catalan and many other European Gothic cathedrals, the Sagrada Família is short in comparison to its width, and has a great complexity of parts, which include double aisles, an [[ambulatory]] with a [[chevet]] of seven [[apsidal]] chapels, a multitude of towers and three portals, each widely different in structure as well as ornament.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Where it is common for cathedrals in Spain to be surrounded by numerous chapels and ecclesiastical buildings, the plan of this church has an unusual feature: a covered passage or [[cloister]] which forms a rectangle enclosing the church and passing through the [[narthex]] of each of its three portals. With this peculiarity aside, the plan, influenced by Villar's crypt, barely hints at the complexity of Gaudí's design or its deviations from traditional church architecture.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}  There are no exact [[right angle]]s to be seen inside or outside the church, and few straight lines in the design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Strickland|first1=Carol|last2=Handy|first2=Amy|title=The Annotated Arch: A Crash Course in the History of Architecture|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=rdiFhC6XOWwC|accessdate=26 October 2018|volume=2|date=11 April 2001|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=9780740710247|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gaudí|first1=Antoni |last2=Cuito|first2=Aurora |last3=Montes|first3=Cristina |title=Gaudí|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=f90NukJl5cIC|accessdate=26 October 2018|year=2002|publisher=A. Asppan S.L|isbn=9788489439917|page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spires===
Gaudí's original design calls for a total of eighteen spires, representing in ascending order of height the [[Twelve Apostles]],&lt;ref&gt;Note: the two Apostles who are also Evangelists are left out and replaced by St. [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] and also St. [[Barnabas]].&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Mary, the Mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]], the [[four Evangelists]] and, tallest of all, Jesus Christ. Eight spires have been built {{As of|2010|lc=y}}, corresponding to four apostles at the Nativity façade and four apostles at the Passion façade.

According to the 2005 "Works Report" of the project's official website, drawings signed by Gaudí and recently found in the Municipal Archives, indicate that the spire of the Virgin was in fact intended by Gaudí to be shorter than those of the evangelists. The spire height will follow Gaudí's intention, which according to the report will work with the existing foundation.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} 

The Evangelists' spires will be surmounted by sculptures of their traditional symbols: a winged bull ([[Luke the Evangelist|Saint Luke]]), a winged man ([[Matthew the Apostle|Saint Matthew]]), an eagle ([[John the Evangelist|Saint John]]), and a winged lion ([[Mark the Evangelist|Saint Mark]]). The central spire of Jesus Christ is to be surmounted by a giant [[Christian cross|cross]]; its total height ({{convert|170|m|ft}}) will be one metre less than that of [[Montjuïc]] hill in Barcelona as Gaudí believed that his creation should not surpass God's. The lower spires are surmounted by communion hosts with sheaves of wheat and chalices with bunches of grapes, representing the [[Eucharist]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Plans call for tubular bells to be placed within the spires, driven by the force of the wind, and driving sound down into the interior of the church. Gaudí performed acoustic studies to achieve the appropriate acoustic results inside the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Álvaro Muñoz |first1=Mari Carmen |last2=Llop i Bayo |first2=Francesc |title=Tubular bell |url=http://www.campaners.com/php/catedral.php?numer=2043 |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, only one bell is currently in place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Inventario de campanas de las Catedrales de España |url=http://www.campaners.com/php/cat_campanes1.php?numer=2043 |accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The completion of the spires will make Sagrada Família the [[List of tallest church buildings|tallest church building in the world]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

===Façades===
[[File:TTTT6.JPG|thumb|right|The Nativity façade]]
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
The Church will have three grand façades: the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] façade to the East, the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] façade to the West, and the [[Glory (religion)|Glory]] façade to the South (yet to be completed). The Nativity Façade was built before work was interrupted in 1935 and bears the most direct Gaudí influence. The Passion façade was built according to the design that Gaudi created in 1917. The construction began in 1954, and the towers, built over the elliptical plan, were finished in 1976. It is especially striking for its spare, gaunt, tormented characters, including emaciated figures of Christ being scourged at the pillar; and Christ on the [[Christian cross|Cross]]. These controversial designs are the work of [[Josep Maria Subirachs]]. The Glory façade, on which construction began in 2002, will be the largest and most monumental of the three and will represent one's ascension to God. It will also depict various scenes such as Hell, Purgatory, and will include elements such as the [[Seven deadly sins]] and the [[Seven heavenly virtues]].

====Nativity Façade====
[[File:Die Geburtsfassade der Sagrada Familia im Detail.jpg|thumb|Sculpture of the choir of angel children]]

Constructed between 1894 and 1930, the Nativity façade was the first façade to be completed. Dedicated to the birth of Jesus, it is decorated with scenes reminiscent of elements of life. Characteristic of Gaudí's naturalistic style, the sculptures are ornately arranged and decorated with scenes and images from nature, each a symbol in its own manner. For instance, the three porticos are separated by two large columns, and at the base of each lies a turtle or a tortoise (one to represent the land and the other the sea; each are symbols of time as something set in stone and unchangeable). In contrast to the figures of turtles and their symbolism, two chameleons can be found at either side of the façade, and are symbolic of change.

The façade faces the rising sun to the northeast, a symbol for the birth of Christ. It is divided into three porticos, each of which represents a theological virtue (Hope, Faith and Charity). The [[Tree of Life]] rises above the door of Jesus in the portico of Charity. Four towers complete the façade and are each dedicated to a Saint ([[Saint Matthias|Matthias]], [[Barnabas]], [[Jude the Apostle]], and [[Simon the Zealot]]).

Originally, Gaudí intended for this façade to be [[polychrome]]d, for each [[archivolt]] to be painted with a wide array of colours. He wanted every statue and figure to be painted. In this way the figures of humans would appear as much alive as the figures of plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bergós i Massó | first = Joan | title = Gaudí, l'home i l'obra | year = 1999 | publisher=Ed. Lunwerg |place= Barcelona | isbn= 84-7782-617-X |page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaudí chose this façade to embody the structure and decoration of the whole church. He was well aware that he would not finish the church and that he would need to set an artistic and architectural example for others to follow. He also chose for this façade to be the first on which to begin construction and for it to be, in his opinion, the most attractive and accessible to the public. He believed that if he had begun construction with the Passion Façade, one that would be hard and bare (as if made of bones), before the Nativity Façade, people would have withdrawn at the sight of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Barral i Altet | first = Xavier | title = Art de Catalunya. Arquitectura religiosa moderna i contemporània | year = 1999 | publisher=L'isard |place= Barcelona | isbn = 84-89931-14-3 |page=218}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the statues were destroyed in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War, and subsequently were reconstructed by the Japanese artist [[Etsuro Sotoo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catalannews.com/life-style/item/first-door-of-the-nativity-facade-of-the-sagrada-familia-has-now-been-fitted|title=First door of the Nativity Façade of the Sagrada Família has now been fitted|last=Sendra|first=Enric|date=17 July 2014|website=Catalan News|access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Passion Façade====
[[File:SF - Passió 2018-m.jpg|thumb|right|Passion façade of the Sagrada Família in 2018]]
In contrast to the highly decorated Nativity Façade, the Passion Façade is austere, plain and simple, with ample bare stone, and is carved with harsh straight lines to resemble the bones of a skeleton. Dedicated to the [[Passion of Jesus|Passion]] of Christ, the suffering of Jesus during his [[crucifixion]], the façade was intended to portray the sins of man. Construction began in 1954, following the drawings and instructions left by Gaudí for future architects and sculptors. The towers were completed in 1976, and in 1987 a team of sculptors, headed by [[Josep Maria Subirachs]], began work sculpting the various scenes and details of the façade. They aimed to give a rigid, angular form to provoke a dramatic effect. Gaudí intended for this façade to strike fear into the onlooker. He wanted to "break" arcs and "cut" columns, and to use the effect of [[chiaroscuro]] (dark angular shadows contrasted by harsh rigid light) to further show the severity and brutality of Christ's sacrifice.

Facing the setting sun, indicative and symbolic of the death of Christ, the Passion Façade is supported by six large and inclined columns, designed to resemble [[Sequoia (genus)|Sequoia]] trunks. Above there is a pyramidal [[pediment]], made up of eighteen bone-shaped columns, which culminate in a large cross with a crown of thorns. Each of the four towers is dedicated to an apostle ([[James, son of Zebedee|James]], [[Thomas the Apostle|Thomas]], [[Philip the Apostle|Philip]], and [[Bartholomew the Apostle|Bartholomew]]) and, like the Nativity Façade, there are three porticos, each representing the theological virtues, though in a much different light.

The scenes sculpted into the façade may be divided into three levels, which ascend in an ''S'' form and reproduce the stations of the Cross ([[Via Crucis]] of Christ).&lt;ref name="gimeno"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gómez Gimeno | first = María José | title = La Sagrada Família | year = 2006 | publisher=Mundo Flip Ediciones | isbn = 84-933983-4-9 |pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lowest level depicts scenes from Jesus' last night before the crucifixion, including the [[Last Supper]], [[Kiss of Judas]], [[Ecce homo]], and the [[Sanhedrin trial of Jesus]]. The middle level portrays the Calvary, or Golgotha, of Christ, and includes [[The Three Marys]], Saint [[Longinus]], [[Saint Veronica]], and a [[hollow-face illusion]] of Christ on the [[Veil of Veronica]]. In the third and final level the Death, Burial and the [[Resurrection of Christ]] can be seen. A bronze figure situated on a bridge creating a link between the towers of Saint Bartholomew and Saint Thomas represents the [[Ascension of Jesus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/06/02/cultura/1117725182.html |title=La Sagrada Familia abrirá al culto en 2008, según sus responsables |trans-title=The Sagrada Familia opens for worship in 2008, according to its leaders |date=2 June 2005 | agency=Europa Press |language=Spanish| publisher=Mundinteractivos, SA |work=El Mundo| accessdate=7 July 2010 }} ([https://translate.google.com/translate?u=http%3A//www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2005/06/02/cultura/1117725182.html&amp;hl=en&amp;langpair=auto|en&amp;tbb=1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1 English tr.])&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

The largest and most striking of the façades will be the Glory Façade, on which construction began in 2002. It will be the principal façade and will offer access to the central [[nave]]. Dedicated to the Celestial Glory of Jesus, it represents the road to God: Death, Final Judgment, and Glory, while [[Hell]] is left for those who deviate from God's will. Aware that he would not live long enough to see this façade completed, Gaudí made a model which was demolished in 1936, whose original fragments were base for the development of the design for the façade. The completion of this façade may require the partial demolition of the block with buildings across the Carrer de Mallorca.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.barcelonas.com/future-of-la-sagrada-familia.html&lt;/ref&gt;


To reach the Glory Portico the large staircase will lead over the underground passage built over Carrer de Mallorca with the decoration representing Hell and vice. On other projects Carrer de Mallorca will have to go underground.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gaudiallgaudi.com/AA012c.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It will be decorated with demons, idols, false gods, heresy and schisms, etc. Purgatory and death will also be depicted, the latter using tombs along the ground. The portico will have seven large columns dedicated to [[gifts of the Holy Spirit]]. At the base of the columns there will be representations of the [[Seven Deadly Sins]], and at the top, The [[Seven Heavenly Virtues|Seven Virtues]].
*'''Gifts''': wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety and fear of the Lord.
*'''Sins''': greed, anger, pride, gluttony, sloth, wrath, envy.
*'''Virtues''': kindness, diligence, patience, charity, temperance, humility, chastity.
[[File:Puerta Gloria.jpg|thumb|right|Eucharist Door of the Glory Facade showing, at bottom, the "A...G" for Anoni Gaudí]]
This facade will have five doors corresponding to the five naves of the temple, with the central one having a triple entrance, that will give the Glory Façade a total seven doors representing the sacraments:

*[[Baptism]]
*[[Confirmation]]
*[[Eucharist]]
*[[Penance]]
*[[Holy orders]]
*[[Marriage]]
*[[Unction of the sick]]

In September 2008, the doors of the Glory façade, by [[Josep Maria Subirachs]], were installed.  Inscribed with the [[Lord's prayer]], these central doors are inscribed with the words "Give us our daily bread" in fifty different languages.  The handles of the door are the letters "A" and "G" that form the initials of Antoni Gaudí within the phrase "lead us not into temptation".

===Interior===

File:Sagrada_Fam%C3%ADlia,_Columns.jpg
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The church plan is that of a Latin cross with five aisles. The central nave vaults reach {{convert|45|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}} while the side nave vaults reach {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. The transept has three aisles. The columns are on a 7.5{{nbsp}}metre (25&amp;nbsp;ft) grid. However, the columns of the [[apse]], resting on del Villar's foundation, do not adhere to the grid, requiring a section of columns of the ambulatory to transition to the grid thus creating a horseshoe pattern to the layout of those columns. The crossing rests on the four central columns of porphyry supporting a great hyperboloid surrounded by two rings of twelve hyperboloids (currently under construction). The central vault reaches {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. The apse is capped by a hyperboloid vault reaching {{convert|75|m|ft|abbr=off|spell=in}}. Gaudí intended that a visitor standing at the main entrance be able to see the vaults of the nave, crossing, and apse; thus the graduated increase in vault loft.

There are gaps in the floor of the apse, providing a view down into the crypt below.

The columns of the interior are a unique Gaudí design. Besides branching to support their load, their ever-changing surfaces are the result of the intersection of various geometric forms. The simplest example is that of a square base evolving into an octagon as the column rises, then a sixteen-sided form, and eventually to a circle. This effect is the result of a three-dimensional intersection of helicoidal columns (for example a square cross-section column twisting clockwise and a similar one twisting counter-clockwise).

Essentially none of the interior surfaces are flat; the ornamentation is comprehensive and rich, consisting in large part of abstract shapes which combine smooth curves and jagged points. Even detail-level work such as the iron railings for balconies and stairways are full of curvaceous elaboration.

====Organ====
In 2010 an [[Organ (music)|organ]] was installed in the chancel by the Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat organ builders. The instrument has 26 stops (1,492 pipes) on two manuals and a pedalboard.

To overcome the unique acoustical challenges posed by the church's architecture and vast size, several additional organs will be installed at various points within the building. These instruments will be playable separately (from their own individual consoles) and simultaneously (from a single mobile console), yielding an organ of some 8000 pipes when completed.&lt;ref&gt;Blancafort Orgueners de Montserrat, [http://www.orguesblancafort.com/PRO-CAT.pdf] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903070257/http://www.orguesblancafort.com/PRO-CAT.pdf |date=3 September 2011 }} {{ca icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geometric details===
{{further|Mathematics and art}}

[[File:AlphaOmega.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alpha and Omega]] carving at Sagrada Família entrance]]

The towers on the Nativity façade are crowned with [[Mathematics and art|geometrically shaped]] tops that are reminiscent of [[Cubism]] (they were finished around 1930), and the intricate decoration is contemporary to the style of [[Art Nouveau]], but Gaudí's unique style drew primarily from nature, not other artists or architects, and resists categorization.

Gaudí used [[hyperboloid structure]]s in later designs of the Sagrada Família (more obviously after 1914), however there are a few places on the nativity façade—a design not equated with Gaudí's [[ruled surface|ruled-surface]] design—where the [[hyperboloid]] crops up. For example, all around the scene with the pelican there are numerous examples (including the basket held by one of the figures). There is a hyperboloid adding structural stability to the cypress tree (by connecting it to the bridge). And finally, the "bishop's mitre" spires are capped with hyperboloid structures.&lt;ref name=BDM&gt;{{cite journal |first1=M. C. |last1=Burry |first2=J. R. |last2=Burry |first3=G.

===Symbolism===
[[File:SagradaFamiliaSanctus.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of a tower of the Passion Façade decorated with the word [[Sanctus]]]]
Themes throughout the decoration include words from the liturgy. The towers are decorated with words such as "Hosanna", "Excelsis", and "Sanctus"; the great doors of the Passion façade reproduce excerpts of the [[Passion of Jesus]] from the New Testament in various languages, mainly [[Catalan language|Catalan]]; and the Glory façade is to be decorated with the words from the [[Apostles' Creed]], while its main door reproduce the entire [[Lord's Prayer]] in Catalan, surrounded by multiple variations of "Give us this day our daily bread" in other languages. The three entrances symbolize the three virtues: Faith, Hope and Love. Each of them is also dedicated to a part of Christ's life. The Nativity Façade is dedicated to his birth; it also has a cypress tree which symbolizes the tree of life. The Glory façade is dedicated to his glory period. The Passion façade is symbolic of his suffering. The apse tower bears Latin text of [[Hail Mary]]. All in all, the Sagrada Família is symbolic of the lifetime of Christ.

Areas of the sanctuary will be designated to represent various concepts, such as saints, virtues and sins, and secular concepts such as regions, presumably with decoration to match.

===Burials===
*Josep Maria Bocabella
*[[Antoni Gaudí]]

==Appraisal==
The art historian [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], writing in the 1960s, referred to Gaudí's buildings as growing "like [[Sugarloaf|sugar loaves]] and anthills" and describes the ornamenting of buildings with shards of broken pottery as possibly "bad taste" but handled with vitality and "ruthless audacity".&lt;ref name=Pevsner&gt;[[Nikolaus Pevsner]], ''An Outline of European Architecture'', Penguin Books, (1963), pp. 394–5&lt;/ref&gt;

The building's design itself has been polarizing. Assessments by Gaudí's fellow architects were generally
positive; [[Louis Sullivan]] greatly admired it, describing Sagrada Família as the
"greatest piece of creative architecture in the last twenty-five years. It is spirit symbolised
in stone!"&lt;ref name="dm"&gt;[[David Mower]], ''Gaudí'', Oresko Books Limited, 1977, (p.6) {{ISBN|0905368096}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Walter Gropius]] also praised the Sagrada Família, describing the building's walls as "a marvel of
technical perfection".&lt;ref name="dm" /&gt;
[[Time Magazine]] called it "sensual, spiritual, whimsical, exuberant",&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news

===World Heritage status===
Together with six other Gaudí buildings in Barcelona, part of la Sagrada Família is a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]], as testifying "to Gaudí's exceptional creative contribution to the development of architecture and building technology", "having represented el Modernisme of Catalonia" and "anticipated and influenced many of the forms and techniques that were relevant to the development of modern construction in the 20th century". The inscription only includes the Crypt and the Nativity Façade.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;''[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/320 Works of Antoni Gaudí]'', UNESCO World Heritage Centre, Retrieved 14 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visiting==
Visitors can access the Nave, Crypt, Museum, Shop, and the Passion and Nativity towers. Entrance to either of the towers requires a reservation and advance purchase of a ticket. Access is possible only by lift (elevator) and a short walk up the remainder of the towers to the bridge between the towers. Descent is via a very narrow spiral staircase of over 300 steps. There is a posted caution for those with medical conditions.

As of June 2017, on-line ticket purchase has been available. As of August 2010, there had been a service whereby visitors could buy an entry code either at Servicaixa [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] kiosks (part of "La Caixa") or online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/tickets/ |website=Basílica de la Sagrada Família |title=Tickets |access-date=8 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608050100/http://www.sagradafamilia.org/en/tickets/ |archive-date=8 June 2017 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the peak season, May to October, reservation delays for entrance of up to a few days are not unusual.

==Funding and Building permit==
Construction on Sagrada Família is not supported by any government or official church sources. Private patrons funded the initial stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.essential-architecture.com/SPAIN/SP-BA/BA-006.htm |title= Sagrada Família Church of the Holy Family |work=Essential Architecture| author=Fletcher, Tom |accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Money from tickets purchased by tourists is now used to pay for the work, and private donations are accepted through the Friends of the Sagrada Família.

The construction budget for 2009 was €18&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="elpais"/&gt;

In October 2018, Sagrada Família trustees agreed to pay €36&amp;nbsp;million in payments to the city authorities, to land a building permit after 136 years of construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://newatlas.com/la-sagrada-familia-building-permit/56929/|title=136 years late, La Sagrada Familia finally lands a building permit|work=New Atlas|date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the funds would be directed to improve the access between the church and [[Barcelona metro|Barcelona's metro]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://time.com/5429231/barcelona-sagrada-familia-building-permit/|title=Barcelona's Sagrada Familia Church Has Been Under Construction for 136 Years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2664">The '''Scriblerus Club''' was an informal association of authors, based in London, that came together in the early 18th century. They were prominent figures in the [[Augustan literature|Augustan Age]] of English letters. The nucleus of the club included the satirists [[Jonathan Swift]] and [[Alexander Pope]]. Other members were [[John Gay]], [[John Arbuthnot]], [[Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke|Henry St. John]] and [[Thomas Parnell]]. The group was founded in 1714 and lasted until the death of the founders, finally ending in 1745. Pope and Swift are the two members whose reputations and work have the most long-lasting influence. Working collaboratively, the group created the persona of '''Martinus Scriblerus''', through whose writings they accomplished their satirical aims. Very little of this material, however, was published until the 1740s. [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Mortimer]] occasionally joined the club for meetings, though he is not known to have contributed to their literary output.  He, along with Henry St John, 1st Viscount Bolingbroke, contributed to the literary productions of the Club.

The club began as an effort to satirize the abuses of learning wherever they might be found, which led to ''[[The Memoirs of Martinus Scriblerus]]''. The second edition of Pope's ''[[The Dunciad]]'' also contains work attributed to Martinus Scriblerus.

[[Richard Owen Cambridge]] wrote a [[mock epic]] poem, the ''Scribleriad'', where the hero is Martinus Scriblerus.

[[Henry Fielding]]'s play ''[[The Welsh Opera]]'' is presented as a tribute to the "Scriblerians".  Fielding's pen name was "Scriblerus Secundus."

'''''Selected Essays, 1917-1932''''' is a collection of [[prose]] and [[literary criticism]] by [[T. S. Eliot]]. Eliot's work fundamentally changed literary thinking and ''Selected Essays'' provides both an overview and an in-depth examination of his theory.&lt;ref name=BRags&gt;[[BookRags]]: ''Selected Essays of T. S. Eliot, 1917-1932 Study Guide&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in 1932 by his employers, [[Faber &amp; Faber]], costing 12/6 (''2009: £{{formatnum:{{Inflation|UK|0.625|1932|2009|r=-0}}}}'').&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 16 September 1932; ''Some New Books''&lt;/ref&gt; 

In addition to his poetry, by 1932, Eliot was already accepted as one of English Literature's most important critics. In this position he was instrumental in the reviving interest in the long‐neglected Jacobean playwrights.&lt;ref name=OCAT&gt;Eliot, T[homas] S[tearns]"  The Oxford Companion to American Theatre, 3rd edn., Gerald Bordman and Thomas S. Hischak, eds., Oxford University Press 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; ''A Dialogue on Dramatic Poetry'' was originally an addendum to Eliot's preface to Dryden's ''[[Essay of Dramatick Poesie]]'' (1928 reprint).&lt;ref name=Baden&gt;Richard Badenhausen ''T.S. Eliot and the art of collaboration'' [[Cambridge University Press]], 2004, {{ISBN|0-521-84123-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further essays include ''The Metaphysical Poets (1921)'' in which Eliot argued that a "[[dissociation of sensibility]]" set in...  due to the influence of ... [[John Milton|Milton]] and [[Dryden]].&lt;ref Name=ODQ&gt;"T. S. Eliot"  Oxford Dictionary of Quotations. by Elizabeth Knowles. Oxford University Press Inc. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the modern poet ‘must be difficult’... ‘to force, to dislocate if necessary, language into his meaning’.&lt;ref&gt;"Eliot, T. S."  The Oxford Companion to English Literature. Edited by Dinah Birch. Oxford University Press Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Philip Massinger (1920)'' contains his [[aphorism]] "Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal".&lt;ref Name=ODQ/&gt;

Eliot converted to the [[Church of England]] and some of the essays expressed the form and discipline he felt necessary for fulfillment in his own life.&lt;ref&gt;Eliot, T[homas] S[tearns]"  The Oxford Companion to American Literature. James D. Hart, ed., rev. Phillip W. Leininger. Oxford University Press 1995&lt;/ref&gt; ''For Lancelot Andrewes (1926)'', examines  [[Lancelot Andrewes|Andrewes]], a 17th-century Anglican bishop whose Eliot considers an important figure in history of the church, distinguished for the quality of his thoughts and prose.&lt;ref name=Lance&gt;"For Lancelot Andrewes"  The Oxford Companion to American Literature. James D. Hart, ed., rev. Phillip W. Leininger. Oxford University Press 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Humanism of Irving Babbitt (1927)'', Eliot posits that [[Irving Babbitt|Babbitt]]'s faith in civilization must have a discipline derived from dogmatic religious authority.&lt;ref name=Lance/&gt;

==Reception==
''Selected Essays'' was placed fourth in the [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]]'s [[Fifty Best Books of the Century]] and sixth in [[Modern Library]]'s Best 20th-Century Nonfiction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernlibrary.com/top-100/100-best-nonfiction/ 100 Best Nonfiction] &amp;mdash;Modern Library&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Separation of Light from Darkness''''' is, from the perspective of the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] chronology, the first of nine central panels that run along the center of [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]] and which depict scenes from the Book of Genesis. Michelangelo probably completed this panel in the summer of 1512, the last year of the Sistine ceiling project. It is one of five smaller scenes that alternate with four larger scenes that run along the center of the Sistine ceiling. The ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' is based on verses 3–5 from the first chapter of the Book of Genesis:
:&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;And God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
:&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;God saw that the light was good, and He separated the light from the darkness.
:&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;God called the light "day," and the darkness he called "night." And there was evening, and there was morning—the first day.
 
Although in terms of the Genesis chronology it is the first of nine central panels along the Sistine ceiling, the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' was the last of the nine panels painted by Michelangelo. Michelangelo painted the Sistine ceiling in two stages. Between May 1508 and the summer of 1511, he completed the "entrance half" of the Sistine chapel and ended this stage by painting the ''Creation of Eve'' and the scenes flanking this central panel. After an idle period of about 6 months, he painted the "altar half," starting with the ''Creation of Adam'', between the winter of 1511 and October 1512.

==Composition==

[[File:First Day of Creation.jpg|thumb|left|&lt;center&gt;Four ''ignudi'' and two shields or medallions surround the image of God in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness''&lt;/center&gt;]]

In the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'', the image of God is framed by four ''ignudi'' and by two shields or medallions. The ''ignudi'' are young, nude males that Michelangelo painted as supporting figures at each corner of the five smaller narrative scenes along the center of the ceiling. There are a total of 20 ''ignudi''. These figures are all different and appear less constrained within their space than the Ancestors of Christ or the Bronze Nudes. In the earliest frescoes painted by Michelangelo toward the entrance of the Sistine chapel, the ''ignudi'' are paired, and their poses are similar but with minor variations. The variations in the poses increase with each set until the poses of the final set of four ''ignudi'' in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' bear no relation to each other.

Although the meaning of these figures has never been completely clear, the Sistine scholar Heinrich Pfeiffer has proposed that the four ''ignudi'' associated with the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' represent day and night, which echo the theme of light and darkness.&lt;ref&gt;Pfeiffer, Heinrich W. The Sistine Chapel: A New Vision. New York/London, Abbeville Press Publishers, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, he points out that the ''ignudo'' next to God's right hand (on the side of darkness) is stretching as if awakening from sleep in the morning, that the diagonally opposed ''ignudo'' below God's knee (on the side of light) is carrying a heavy bundle of oak garlands on his shoulders, representing a daytime activity, and that the ''ignudo'' next to God's left arm is falling asleep and signifies nighttime.
Pfeiffer and other scholars have also suggested that in Michelangelo's Sistine iconography the ''ignudi'' represent angels and that the Bronze Nudes below the ''ignudi'' are fallen angels.

[[Image:Michelangelos David.jpg|thumb|right|''Contrapposto'' pose in Michelangelo's ''David''. The shoulders of the figure are seen to angle in one direction, the pelvis in another.]]

Two shields or medallions accompany each set of four ''ignudi'' in the five smaller Genesis panels along the center of the Sistine ceiling. They are often described as painted to resemble bronze. Each is decorated with a picture from either the Old Testament or the Book of Maccabees from the Apocrypha. The subjects of the shields are often violent. In the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' the shield above God shows Abraham sacrificing his son Isaac (Genesis 22:9–12), and the one below God shows the prophet Elijah as he is carried up to heaven in a chariot of fire (2 Kings 2:11).

At the center of the composition, God is shown in ''[[contrapposto]]'' rising into the sky, with arms outstretched separating the light from the darkness. Michelangelo employed in this fresco the challenging ceiling fresco technique of ''[[sotto in su]]'' ("from below, upward"), which makes a figure appear as if it is rising above the viewer by using foreshortening. The contrapposto pose was also used by Michelangelo in the ''David''. It is reported that Michelangelo painted this fresco in a single ''giornata'', that is, a single working day of approximately eight hours.&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Dixon, Andrew. Michelangelo and the Sistine Chapel. London, England: The Orion Publishing Group Ltd., 2008&lt;/ref&gt; During Michelangelo's lifetime, this fresco was considered evidence of the painter's technical prowess at its peak. For instance, Giorgio Vasari (1511–1574), Michelangelo's student and biographer, wrote in 1550:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Furthermore, to demonstrate the perfection of his art and the greatness of God, Michelangelo depicted God dividing the light from darkness in these scenes, where He is seen in all His majesty as He sustains himself alone with open arms with the demonstration of love and creative energy.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, Giorgio. The Lives of the Artists. 1550.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Art historians have noted several unusual features of this fresco. Andrew Graham-Dixon has pointed out that God has exaggerated pectoral muscles suggestive of female breasts, which he interprets as Michelangelo's attempt to illustrate "male strength but also the fecundity of the female principle."&lt;ref&gt;Graham-Dixon 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In addition it has been noted that the anatomy of God's neck is too complex and does not resemble the normal contour of the neck. The lighting scheme of the image has been noted to be inconsistent; whereas the entire scene is illuminated from the bottom left, God's neck appears to have a different light source from the right.

==Anatomical interpretations==

[[Image:Michelangelo neuroanatomy.jpg|thumb|left| Suk and Tamargo proposed that there are three concealed neuroanatomical images in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'', the first panel in the Genesis series.]]
[[Image:Michelangelo Sistine Chapel - Ignudo above Libyan Sibyl - restored.jpg|thumb|upright|right| Ignudo facing God in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness''.]]

Several authors have proposed that Michelangelo concealed anatomical images in this fresco and that these anatomical images account for its unusual features. In an article published in the journal ''[[Neurosurgery (journal)|Neurosurgery]]'' in May 2010, Ian Suk, a medical illustrator, and Rafael Tamargo, a neurosurgeon, both from the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]], suggested that Michelangelo concealed three neuroanatomical images in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Suk | first1=Ian |last2=Tamargo|first2=Rafael J.| date=May 2010 |title=Concealed Neuroanatomy in Michelangelo's Separation of Light From Darkness in the Sistine Chapel (abstract) | journal=[[Neurosurgery (journal)|Neurosurgery]] |volume=66 |issue=5 |pages=851–861 |publisher= |doi=10.1227/01.NEU.0000368101.34523.E1 |url=http://journals.lww.com/neurosurgery/Abstract/2010/05000/Concealed_Neuroanatomy_in_Michelangelo_s.1.aspx |accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA" &gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/michelangelos-secret-message-in-the-sistine-chapel-a-juxtaposition-of-god-and-the-human-brain/ | title=Michelangelo's secret message in the Sistine Chapel: A juxtaposition of God and the human brain | first=R. Douglas |last=Fields | date=27 May 2010 | work=[[Scientific American]] | accessdate=9 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suk and Tamargo explained that Michelangelo started to dissect cadavers at the age of 17–19 years and continued his anatomical studies throughout his life. As a result of his dissections, Michelangelo probably developed a detailed understanding of gross anatomy of the brain and spinal cord. They showed that the anatomical details in God's neck are unlike those of either other necks painted by Michelangelo in the Sistine Chapel or of other necks painted by Michelangelo's contemporaries, such as Leonardo da Vinci and Raffaello Sanzio (Raphael). The unusual anatomy of God's neck is particularly evident when it is contrasted with the anatomy of the neck of the ignudo facing God in the upper left corner of the panel. The position of the neck of this ignudo is almost identical to that of God's neck, yet the ignudo's neck does not have any of the unusual lines found in God's neck. It is possible that Michelangelo placed these two analogous neck perspectives side by side to emphasize and contrast the hidden image in God's neck.

Suk and Tamargo suggested that Michelangelo concealed a sophisticated image of the undersurface of the brainstem in God's neck and that by following Michelangelo's lines in God's neck, one can outline an anatomically correct image of the brainstem, cerebellum, temporal lobes, and optic chiasm. In addition, they suggested that Michelangelo also included an anterior view of the spinal cord in God's chest and an image of the optic nerves and globes in God's abdomen. They showed how a "shadow analysis" of the unusual lines in God's neck correspond to specific spaces around the brainstem known as the "arachnoid cisterns," which were described in detail much later in 1875 but which Michelangelo inadvertently depicted in God's neck since he was able to render images with almost photographic accuracy. They concluded that "being a painter of genius, a master anatomist, and a deeply religious man, Michelangelo cleverly enhanced his depiction of God in the iconographically critical panels on the Sistine Chapel vault with concealed images of the brain and in this way celebrated not only the glory of God, but also that of His most magnificent creation."

[[File:Michelangelo, Creation of Adam 04.jpg|upright=1.15|thumb|right|Meshberger wrote that Michelangelo concealed an image of the brain in the shroud surrounding God in the ''[[Creation of Adam]]''.]]

Of note is that in an article published in the ''[[JAMA (journal)|Journal of the American Medical Association]]'' in October 1990, Frank Meshberger, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Indiana, explained that Michelangelo similarly concealed an image of the brain in the shroud surrounding God in the ''[[Creation of Adam]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meshberger |first1=Frank Lynn |date=10 October 1990 |title=An Interpretation of Michelangelo's Creation of Adam Based on Neuroanatomy |journal=[[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]] | volume=264 |issue=14 |pages=1837–41 |publisher=[[American Medical Association]] |location=[[Chicago]], [[Illinois]] | doi=10.1001/jama.1990.03450140059034 |pmid=2205727 }} [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cluster=1229086804171881877 Pdf]. [http://www.mentalhealthandillness.com/creation_fr.html Excerpt] on Mental Health &amp; Illness.com. Retrieved 21 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SA" /&gt; Since Michelangelo painted the ''Creation of Adam'' and the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'', along with two other Genesis panels, as a single thematic unit between the winter of 1511 and October 1512, it is possible that these four central panels have an underlying anatomical motif. Indeed, Garabed Eknoyan, a nephrologist from [[Baylor College of Medicine]], proposed in an article published in ''[[Kidney International]]'' in March 2000 that Michelangelo concealed an image of a kidney in the ''Separation of Land and Water'', the third panel in the Genesis series.&lt;ref name="Kidney"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Eknoyan | first1=Garabed |date=March 2000 |title=Michelangelo: Art, anatomy, and the kidney |url=http://www.kidney-international.org/article/S0085-2538%2815%2946851-6/fulltext |journal=[[Kidney International]] | volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=1190–1201 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |location=[[Amsterdam]] | doi=10.1046/j.1523-1755.2000.00947.x |accessdate=11 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michelangelo was particularly interested in kidney function because he suffered from kidney stones throughout his adult life and documented this interest in his letters and poems, according to Eknoyan.

[[File:Dividing water from Heaven.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Eknoyan suggested&lt;ref name="Kidney"/&gt; that Michelangelo concealed an image of a kidney in the ''Separation of Land and Water'', the third panel in the Genesis series.]]

Alternatively, the concealed anatomical image in God's neck in the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' has been interpreted as a goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland). In an article published in the ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'' in December 2003, Lennart Bondeson and Anne-Greath Bondeson from Malmo University Hospital in Sweden, argued that the abnormality in God's neck is a goiter.&lt;ref&gt;Bondeson, L., and Bondeson, A. G.. Michelangelo's divine goitre. J. R. Soc. Med. 96: 609–611, December 2003&lt;/ref&gt; This interpretation has been challenged on the basis that goiters typically occur lower in the neck and, as stated by Suk and Tamargo, that "it is unlikely that Michelangelo, a deeply religious individual, would have defiled the image of God in this important panel by giving God a goiter."

Along these lines, Gilson Barreto and Marcelo G. de Oliveira, in a book published in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;Barreto, G., and de Oliveira, M. G.. A Arte Secreta de Michelangelo. Uma Licao de Anatomia na Capela Sistina. Editoria Arx, Sao Paulo, Brasil, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; analyzed the ''Separation of Light from Darkness'' and noted that God's upper chest and outstretched arms define a "U" shape, which they suggested is reminiscent of the hyoid bone, although they do not offer a thematic explanation for this structure in the fresco.

The '''Six principles of [[Chinese painting]]''' were established by [[Xie He (Chinese artist)|Xie He]] in "Six points to consider when judging a painting" (繪畫六法, [[Pinyin]]:Huìhuà Liùfǎ) from the preface to his book "The Record of the Classification of Old Painters" (古畫品錄; [[Pinyin]]: Gǔhuà Pǐnlù) written circa 550 and refers to "old" and "ancient" practices.  The six elements that define a painting are:

# "''Spirit Resonance''," or vitality, and seems to translate to the nervous energy transmitted from the artist into the work.  The overall energy of a work of art.  Xie He said that without Spirit Resonance, there was no need to look further.
# "''Bone Method''," or the way of using the brush.  This refers not only to texture and brush stroke, but to the close link between handwriting and personality.  In his day, the art of calligraphy was inseparable from painting.
# "''Correspondence to the Object''," or the depicting of form, which would include shape and line.
# "''Suitability to Type''," or the application of color, including layers, value and tone.
# "''Division and Planning''," or placing and arrangement, corresponding to composition, space and depth.
# "''Transmission by Copying''," or the copying of models, not only from life but also the works of antiquity.

These have been translated over the years by a succession of sinologists with very varying translations. "The problem lies, of course, in the terseness of the original Chinese, where each principle is stated in but four characters.... Each period of Chinese painting has its own special way of interpreting the six principles...their application is fluid, varying according to period and artist".&lt;ref&gt;Fritz van Briessen, ''The Way of the Brush: Painting Techniques of China and Japan''. Rutland, Vermont: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1962, pp. 111-112.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5456">'''''Taiwan the Formosa''''' (sometimes '''''Taiwan the Green'''''; [[pe̍h-ōe-jī]]: ''Tâi-oân Chhùi-chhiⁿ''; {{zh|c=台灣翠青}}) is a [[poem]] written (conceived in 1977; finalized in 1993) by Taiwanese poet and [[clergy]]man Tīⁿ Jî-gio̍k (鄭兒玉; John Jyi-giokk Ti'n, Er-Yu Cheng, died 11 December 2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.roodo.com/senghian/archives/35571928.html 鄭兒玉牧師轉--去-ah]&lt;/ref&gt;), set to music between 1988 and 1993 by [[neo-Romantic]] Taiwanese composer [[Tyzen Hsiao]]. An English metrical translation was provided by Boris and Clare Anderson. The text represents an early example of the popular verse that emerged from the [[Taiwanese literature movement]] in the 1970s and 80s. In 1994 Hsiao used this [[hymn]] to conclude his ''1947 Overture'' for soprano, choir and orchestra.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/1947-overture 1947 Overture]'', [[Answers.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

''Taiwan the Formosa'' has been popular with [[democracy|pro-democracy]] activists  and has been adopted by the [[Taiwan independence movement]] as a proposed [[national anthem]] for a future Republic of Taiwan.&lt;ref&gt;Shih Hsiu-chuan  [http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2006/05/18/2003308786 "Pro-independence supporters promote 'Taiwan the Green' for national anthem"]'', [[Taipei Times]], 5/18/2006''&lt;/ref&gt; The first stanza is [[secular]]. The second, written by popular demand and published in number 2364 of [[Taiwan Church News]] in 1997, has overt [[Christian]] references in keeping with the poet's vocation as a [[Minister of religion|minister]] in the [[Presbyterian Church in Taiwan]]. The second verse is intended only for performance in [[Church (building)|church]] settings or on similarly appropriate occasions.

==Original text==
The poem was originally written in [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]] [[pe̍h-ōe-jī]]. It has subsequently been translated into other languages, such as [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] (by another clergyman Hiû San-hiùng).

==Non-metrical paraphrase in English==
:On the southwestern edge of the [[Pacific Ocean]] stands the lush [[Taiwan]], the beautiful island ("[[Taiwan|Formosa]]").
:Earlier it was ruled by [[Power in international relations|foreign powers]], but now it has achieved its [[Taiwan|nation]]hood ("[[chhut-thâu-thiⁿ]]").

:Towards humanity, civilization, and peace, the people will come forward to contribute their talents.

(Christian stanza added in church performance:)

:In the beginning, [[God]] created the beautiful island of Taiwan, our favourite.
:God gave it to our ancestors to inhabit and still looks over our nation.
:[[Jesus Christ|Christ]] being the Lord of our nation, the ideal state is our hope and aim.
:We will work towards love and justice, so that our [[Taiwan|motherland]] will become as [[Kingdom of God|heaven on earth]]. ([[Amen]].)

The '''Teatro Comunale di Bologna''' is an [[opera house]] in [[Bologna]], Italy, and is one of the most important opera venues in Italy.  Typically, it presents eight operas with six performances during its November to April season.

While there had been various theatres presenting opera in Bologna since the early 17th century, they had either fallen into disuse or burnt down. However, from the early 18th century, the ''Teatro Marsigli-Rossi'' had been presenting operatic works by popular composers of the day including [[Vivaldi]], [[Gluck]], and [[Niccolò Piccinni]]. The ''Teatro Malvezzi'', built in 1651, burned down in February 1745 and this event prompted the construction of a new public theatre, the ''Nuovo Teatro Pubblico'', as the Teatro Comunale was first called when it opened on 14 May 1763.

==Design and inauguration==

[[File:Piazza Giuseppe Verdi (Bologna) 3.jpg|thumb|Teatro Comunale di Bologna]]
Although he had been opposed by several others who lost the design competition, it was won by the architect [[Antonio Galli Bibiena]]&lt;ref&gt;Landriani 1830, p. 164—166&lt;/ref&gt; and the theatre's inaugural performance was [[Gluck]]'s ''[[Il trionfo di Clelia]]'', an opera which the composer had written for the occasion.  A bell-shaped auditorium consisting of four tiers of boxes plus a royal box and small gallery with a ceiling decorated as if open to the sky was built primarily of masonry as a protection against fire.  However, much work remained unfinished, the facade in particular which was not completed until 1936.  Also, many of the backstage facilities which would allow for the presentations of operas were unfinished and only completed due to competition from another theatre in 1805.

It was to be the first major opera house to be constructed with public funds and owned by the municipality. Although 35 of its 99 boxes were sold for private use, the terms of ownership were also unique in that they have been described as being limited to "the right to rent in perpetuity" &lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2005, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; rather than outright ownership and control.

Various renovations were undertaken between 1818 and 1820 and also in 1853/54. After fire destroyed much of the stage area in 1931, the theatre was closed, and it did not re-open until 14 November 1935.  By that date, the original bell-shaped auditorium had given way to a horseshoe-shaped one seating 1,034 people.&lt;ref&gt;Lynn 2005, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works presented and people associated with the house==

The 19th century saw the presentation of twenty operas by [[Gioachino Rossini]], while seven of [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s ten operas were presented in the 1830s. Works by [[Giuseppe Verdi]] and, later in 1871, the Italian premiere of Wagner's ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]'', dominated the theatre's repertoire as the century progressed. In fact, Bologna became the location for several other Wagner opera premieres in Italy, notably with the composer present for his ''[[Rienzi]]'' and the ''[[Parsifal]]'' premiere on 1 January 1914.

Another major figure associated with the ''Teatro Comunale'' from 1894 onwards was the conductor [[Arturo Toscanini]] who presented Verdi's ''[[Falstaff (opera)|Falstaff]]'' in that year and conducted there until the [[Second World War]].

Premieres at the house have included [[Alessandro Solbiati]]'s ''Il suono giallo'', based on [[Wassily Kandinsky]]'s experimental play ''[[The Yellow Sound]]'' on 13 June 2015.&lt;ref name="Repubblica"&gt;{{cite web

==Plot==
Daniel Balint is a former [[Jewish]] [[yeshiva]] student, brilliant but troubled, who is now a fanatically violent [[neo-Nazi]] in [[New York City|New York]] in his early twenties. As a child, he often challenged his teachers with unorthodox interpretations of scripture. He once argued that the [[Binding of Isaac]] was not about [[Abraham]]'s faith but God's power: that God did not want Abraham to accomplish a particular task but instead asks unquestioning obedience, which Abraham refuses to give. He concluded that God is a [[Bullying|bully]].

Daniel finds a meeting of [[Fascism|fascists]] run by Curtis Zampf and Lina Moebius, where he also makes a connection with Lina's daughter Carla. Daniel advocates killing Jews, and a banker named Manzetti in particular, but Curtis and Lina oppose harming Jews on practical if not moral grounds. Impressed with Daniel's intelligence, Lina invites him to their camp retreat in the country. Afterward, Daniel and his fellow neo-Nazi friends pick a fight with two [[African-American]] men, get arrested, and are bailed out of jail by Carla. He spends the night with her but returns to the home of his ailing father. Daniel searches his Hebrew school notebooks and finds a semiautomatic pistol. He is harangued by his sister Linda for his Nazi beliefs, but she also urges him to stay and have ''[[Shabbat]]'' dinner with their father. The men watch television, which is forbidden, leading them to commiserate on the incomprehensibility of Jewish law.

Guy Danielsen, a journalist writing an article on hate groups in the wake of the [[Oklahoma City Bombing]], meets Daniel for an interview. He listens to Daniel's [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] rant, then reveals that he had been in contact with Daniel's old rabbi Stanley Nadelman and knows that Daniel is Jewish. Daniel pulls out his pistol and threatens to commit [[suicide]] if Guy publishes the truth.

Daniel goes to Lina's fascist camp retreat, where he meets Drake, a skilled marksman, along with an explosives expert. Six of the retreat participants, including Daniel, go to a Jewish deli, where they mock the other patrons and torment the owner about Jewish dietary laws until a fight breaks out. After this fight, Daniel and his friends are required by a court to take sensitivity training, where they listen to the experiences of [[Holocaust]] survivors. One talks about how his infant son was murdered by a Nazi. Daniel is enraged that the man did nothing to save his son, but all the survivors assert that Daniel would also have done nothing to avoid being killed, and he walks out in anger.

The story will haunt him, and he imagines himself as both the Nazi and the Jew. Later that night, Daniel and the other neo-Nazis break into a [[synagogue]], vandalize it, and plant a bomb under the pulpit. They also tear, trample, and spit on a [[Torah]] scroll, though Daniel protests. After they leave, Daniel takes the scroll and a [[tallit]] with him. The next morning, the neo-Nazis hear on the news that the bomb failed to go off because the timer froze at thirteen minutes, which the rabbi explains is [[Significance of numbers in Judaism#13|a mystical number]] in Judaism. He says that he believes this means that God protected the synagogue. Back in his cabin, Daniel cleans and repairs the scroll, envisioning himself as the Nazi soldier in the Holocaust survivor's story. He puts on the tallit under his shirt and performs a combination of the [[Nazi salute]] and a [[Torah reading#Hagbaha|gesture used in Jewish prayers]].

Drake soon approaches him with a plan to kill Manzetti, so the two ambush him outside a temple, where Daniel fires but misses. Drake sees the tallit under Daniel's shirt and realizes that he is a Jew, so Daniel shoots him and escapes. He continues to meet with Lina and Curtis, who want to start an above-ground movement to bring fascism into the political mainstream, inviting Jews, blacks, and liberals. Daniel reluctantly agrees to help them raise funds. At the meetings that follow Daniel first charms, then enrages, their potential donors with his intellectual games, leading to his eventual expulsion. When the group hears that Manzetti was killed, Lina suspects Daniel, since he proposed the assassination, but Drake is the real killer.

In the meantime, Carla comforts Daniel and the two sleep together at his home. When she sees the stolen Torah, she asks Daniel to teach her [[Hebrew]], ostensibly for intellectual reasons. They also begin to practice Jewish rituals. He soon runs into an old friend and his fiancée, Stuart and Miriam, who invite him to a [[Rosh Hashanah]] service, assuming that he is an [[Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice|anti-racist skinhead]]. When Daniel arrives, another old friend calls him out as a racist skinhead. As he is leaving, Miriam, who works for the [[District Attorney]], tells him that half of the people in Lina Moebius' meetings are informants for the D.A. Later she asks Daniel to record conversations at a meeting so she can help him with possible charges stemming from the Manzetti killing. He refuses because as Miriam confesses she doesn't care about the truth, she only cares about Daniel.

As [[Yom Kippur]] approaches, Daniel calls Miriam and insists on taking Stuart's place [[Torah reading|reading the Torah]] at the [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] on Yom Kippur. He and his friends plant a new bomb under the temple's pulpit even though they find it reinforced, limiting the explosion. When Daniel takes the pulpit the next day, he is shocked to see Carla in the congregation. He again imagines himself in the story the Holocaust survivor told him, this time as both the Nazi and the Jew. With five minutes to go, Daniel stops and tells to everyone to get out because there is a bomb, but refuses to leave himself.

Daniel is shown in a mystical vision, ascending the stairs in the Jewish school he left as a child. His old teacher approaches, hoping to talk about the Binding of Isaac, and suggests that Isaac died on the mountain and was reborn in the next world. But Daniel ignores him and keeps going, up, and up, infinitely, as his teacher urges him to stop, calling out, "There's nothing up there."

==Reception==
''The Believer'' received an 82% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 90 reviews; the average rating is 7.3 out of 10. The consensus states: "Gosling commands the screen with a raw, electrifying performance."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|believer|The Believer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film also has a score of 75 on [[Metacritic]] based on 28 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Believer |publisher=metacritic |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-believer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jamie Russell of [[BBC Films]] said that it was "awe-inspiring ... a late contender for one of the best films of the year—an intellectually breathtaking, profoundly moving film."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2001/12/04/the_believer_2001_review.shtml The Believer (movie review)] BBC, 4 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Charlotte O'Sullivan of ''[[The Independent]]'' said, "It's naturally thrilling...''The Believer'' is astonishing."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/the-big-picture-the-believers-15-619289.html The Big Picture: The Believers (review)] ''The Independent'', 7 December 2001&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]'' said, "the film is driven by Gosling's revelatory performance ... arresting, prickly, vaguely funny, even—'difficult' in the best sense."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/reviews/67574/the-believer.html The Believer (review)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908075853/http://www.timeout.com/film/newyork/reviews/67574/the-believer.html |date=2008-09-08 }} ''Time Out New York''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Todd McCarthy]] for ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "Bean deals with the core elements of this odd, and oddly compelling, situation with admirable frankness and intelligence, but flounders around the edges. The tenets of Zampf and Moebius' political movement receive such scant attention that the scenes devoted to it are borderline ludicrous, and the masochistic impulses that seem to draw Carla to Danny—"Hurt me!," she begs at the start of their first sexual encounter, and he willingly obliges—are rote and undeveloped."&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2001/film/reviews/the-believer-1117797162/ Review: The Believer] ''Variety''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julie Salamon]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "This willfully provocative film portrait (...) offers lots of raging, vulgarity and shock but little insight into the character's psychopathology. (...) The movie's most telling moment comes when Danny confronts Holocaust survivors about why they allowed themselves to be brutalized. One of them, an old man, responds by asking, ''And what shall we learn from you, Daniel ?'' It's a good question, never answered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Julie Salamon |date=March 16, 2002 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F03E4DD1F39F935A25750C0A9649C8B63 |title=The Believer, Imagery of Anger In a Troubled Mind |newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Germain for ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said, "Even as he commits hate crimes and becomes an anti-Jewish rabble-rouser, the youth is torn between contempt for Jewish passivity during the Holocaust and reverence for the traditions of Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David Germain |agency=Associated Press |date=January 27, 2001 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20010127/aponline233018_000.htm |title='The Believer' Wins at Sundance |newspaper=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Peter Travers]] for ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'' said, "This is a touchy topic, notably for Rabbi Abraham Cooper of the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], who felt the film didn't work and has publicly said so. Without full-throttle support from the Jewish community, ''The Believer'' is on the ropes. Bean, a Conservative Jew from Philadelphia, is a screenwriter with a commercial track record, from Internal Affairs to Enemy of the State. (...) In Gosling, a Canadian actor who started at twelve as a TV Mouseketeer alongside Britney Spears before moving on to film (''[[Remember the Titans]]''), Bean has found the perfect actor. Gosling gives a great, dare-anything performance that will be talked of for ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Peter Travers |date=May 19, 2001 |title=The Believer |work=Rolling Stone |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/the-believer-20010101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apollinaire first intended this book to be a general collection of his writings on art entitled ''Méditations Esthétiques'' rather than specifically on Cubism. In the fall of 1912 he revised the page proofs to include more material on the Cubist painters, adding the subtitle, ''Les Peintres Cubistes''. When the book went to press, the original title was enclosed in [[bracket]]s and reduced in size, while the subtitle ''Les Peintres Cubistes'' was enlarged, dominating the cover. Yet ''Les Peintres Cubistes'' appears only on the half t.p. and t.p. pages, while every other page has the title ''Méditations Esthétiques'', suggesting the modification was made so late that only the title pages were reprinted.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Breunig, Chevalier"&gt;Leroy C.

==Author==
[[File:Apollinaire Rouveyre 1914.webm|thumb|thumbtime=1|upright=1.5|Guillaume Apollinaire and [[André Rouveyre]] in 1914]]
Guillaume Apollinaire, a French poet, playwright, short story writer, novelist, and art critic, served as a decisive interface between artists and poets of the early 20th century, joining the [[visual arts]] and literary circles.&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt; Italian by birth, Polish by name (Wilhelm Albert Włodzimierz Apolinary Kostrowicki), Parisian by choice, Apollinaire was a leading figure in early modernist poetry, a permutable figure whose work echoed the [[Symbolism (art)|Symbolists]], the Cubists and foresaw the [[Surrealism|Surrealists]].

As an active figure in well-established literary journals from 1902 to his death in 1918, Apollinaire played a crucial role in the development of early modernism by founding his own artistic journals, by supporting galleries and exhibitions, as a collector of [[avant-garde]] art, and as an impassioned supporter of a divers group of emerging artists.&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt; His pervasive influence on these artists is exemplified by a multitude of portraits of Apollinaire painted by artists such as [[Henri Rousseau]], Pablo Picasso, Jean Metzinger, [[Louis Marcoussis]], [[Amedeo Modigliani]], Marie Laurencin, Marcel Duchamp, [[Maurice de Vlaminck]], [[Giorgio de Chirico]], [[Mikhail Larionov]], [[Robert Delaunay]], [[Marc Chagall]], Pierre Savigny de Belay and [[Henri Matisse]].&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/jean-metzinger-portrait-de-guillaume-apollin-4911615-details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=4911615&amp;sid=bf281115-cf70-463b-ad5c-c027467afb4c Jean Metzinger, 1910, Portrait of Guillaume Apollinaire, Christie's Paris, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photo.rmn.fr/C.aspx?VP3=SearchResult&amp;VBID=2CO5PCSIW6_O&amp;SMLS=1&amp;RW=1092&amp;RH=584 Ministère de la Culture - Médiathèque du Patrimoine, Dist.

:"Apollinaire, like Baudelaire", writes Pamela A. Genova, "was a self-taught art critic, and he began his art theory naïve to the technical terminology and to the conventional precepts of the field. His work was spontaneous, impetuous, and ahead of its time, and like many ''avant-garde'' pioneers, he was often misunderstood, underestimated, or disregarded. Yet for one who began as a novice in the appreciation, analysis, and promotion of painting, the accuracy of Apollinaire's taste is uncanny, for his favorite painters [for example the artists he includes in ''Les Peintres Cubistes''] are now considered among the most influential artists of the century".&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt;

[[File:Guillaume Apollinaire, c. 1916.jpg|thumb|Guillaume Apollinaire during the spring of 1916 after his shrapnel wound to the temple]]
As a close friend of all the Cubists, and Marie Laurencin's lover, Apollinaire witnessed the development of Cubism firsthand. He was in close contact with [[Le Bateau-Lavoir]] and its habitués—including [[Max Jacob]], [[Maurice Princet]], Picasso, Braque and Metzinger. He was also in close contact with the [[Section d'Or|Groupe de Puteaux (or Section d'Or)]], based in the western suburbs of Paris—including the Duchamp brothers, Gleizes, Picabia and again Metzinger (who associated with both groups early on).

Apollinaire coined several important terms of the avant-garde, such as [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] (at the Salon de la [[Section d'Or]] in 1912)&lt;ref name="MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/theme.php?theme_id=10142 Hajo Düchting, ''Orphism'', MoMA, From Grove Art Online, 2009 Oxford University Press]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Surrealism]] (concerning the ballet ''[[Parade (ballet)|Parade]]'' in 1917),&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Paul Clébert, ''Dictionnaire du surréalisme'', A.T.P. &amp; Le Seuil, Chamalières, p. 17, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hargrove, Nancy (1998).

(''Les Peintres Cubistes'', p.&amp;nbsp;18)&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt;

==Volume==
Guillaume Apollinaire's only book on art, ''The Cubist Painters, Aesthetic Meditations'' is an unsystematic collection of reflections and commentaries.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA"&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/details.php?theme_id=10068&amp;section_id=T020541#skipToContent Christopher Green, ''Cubism, Origins and application of the term'', and ''Meanings and interpretations'', MoMA, Grove Art Online, Oxford University Press, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; It was written between 1905 and 1912, and ultimately published in 1913. Composed of two parts, the volume demonstrates the poetic vision of Apollinaire. The first part, "On Painting" (''Sur la peinture''), is a manifesto for the new art form, consisting of seven chapters (22 pages), of which much of the text was written in 1912 and published in ''{{Ill|Les Soirées de Paris|fr}}'' the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Part II adapted from Guillaume Apollinaire, ''Du sujet dans la peinture moderne'', Les Soirées de Paris, No. 1, Feb. 1912, pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Part III, IV and V adapted from Guillaume Apollinaire, ''La peinture moderne'', Les Soirées de Paris, No. 3, April 1912, pp. 89-92, and No. 4, May 1912, pp. 113-115&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UZ4Gu7a7V9UC&amp;pg=PA220 Herschel Browning Chipp, Peter Selz, ''Theories of Modern Art: A Source Book by Artists and Critics'', University of California Press, 1968, pp. 221-248], {{ISBN|0-520-01450-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second and larger section of the book (53 pages), under the heading "New Painters" (''Peintres nouveaux''), analyzes the work of ten artists most representative of the movement in the following order: Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Laurencin, Gris, Léger, Picabia, Duchamp, and in the Appendix, Duchamp-Villon. In the section on [[Marie Laurencin]], Apollinaire included a text a [[Henri Rousseau]], first published in a review of the 1911 Salon des Indépendants (L'Intransigéant, 10 April 1911).&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

Included are four reproductions of the works by each artist (with the exception of Rousseau), and portrait photographs of Metzinger, Gleizes, Gris, Picabia, and Duchamp.&lt;ref name="metmuseum" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

A landmark in the history of art criticism, this essay synthesizes the aesthetic preoccupations of not just the Cubists, but of Apollinaire himself. The volume is valued today as a work of reference and a vintage example of creative modernist writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucpress.edu/book.php?isbn=9780520243545 Guillaume Apollinaire, "Les Peintres Cubistes" (The Cubist Painters) published in 1913], Peter Read (Translator), University of California Press, 25 Oct. 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qYATQ3Rw6qgC&amp;q=metzinger#v=snippet&amp;q=metzinger&amp;f=false Guillaume Apollinaire, "Les Peintres Cubistes" (The Cubist Painters) published in 1913], (translated and analyzed by Peter F. Read, University of California Press, 25 Oct. 2004 (back cover)&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the third attempt to define the new pictorial trend burgeoning during the years before the First World War, following ''[[Du "Cubisme"]]'' by Albert Gleizes and Jean Metzinger, 1912,&lt;ref name="Du Cubisme" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; and [[André Salmon]], ''Histoire anecdotique du cubisme'' (''Anecdotal History of Cubism''), 1912.&lt;ref name="Salmon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon 1968" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salmon 2005" /&gt;

In his analysis of the new [[art movement]], Apollinaire makes a distinction between four different types of Cubism;&lt;ref name="Genova" /&gt; scientific, physical, orphic and instinctive. The first, ''Scientific Cubism'', is the art of painting new ensembles with elements borrowed not from the reality of vision, but from the reality of knowledge. It is the tendency of 'pure' painting. The painters Apollinaire places in this category are: Picasso, Braque, Metzinger, Gleizes, Laurencin and Gris.&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

The second, ''Physical Cubism'', is the discipline of constructing painting with elements borrowed mostly from the reality of vision. Its social role is well marked, but it is not a pure art. The 'physicist' who created this trend is Le Fauconnier.&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

''Orphic Cubism'' is the art of painting with elements borrowed not from visual reality, but entirely created by the artist and endowed by him with a powerful reality. The works of the Orphic artists simultaneously present a pure aesthetic pleasure, a construction to the senses and a sublime meaning. This is pure art, according to Apollinaire, that includes the work of R. Delaunay, Léger, Picabia and M. Duchamp.&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

''Instinctive Cubism'' is, according to Apollinaire, the art of painting elements borrowed not from visual reality, but suggestive of the artist's instinct and intuition. Instinctive Cubism includes a very large number of artists. Derived from French Impressionism, the movement spans ("is spreading") across all of Europe.&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

The historical study of Cubism began in the late 1920s, drawing at first from ''Du "Cubisme"'' and Apollinaire's ''Les Peintres Cubistes''.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/albertgleizes1881robb#page/n3/mode/2up Daniel Robbins, 1964, ''Albert Gleizes 1881 - 1953, A Retrospective Exhibition'', Published by The Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation, New York, in collaboration with Musée National d'Art Moderne, Paris, Museum am Ostwall, Dortmund, pp. 19-20]&lt;/ref&gt; It came to rely heavily on [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]]'s book ''Der Weg zum Kubismus'' (published in 1920), which centered exclusively on the developments of Picasso, Braque, Léger, and Gris.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt; The terms "Analytical Cubism" and "Synthetic Cubism" which subsequently emerged (overshadowing Apollinaire's classification scheme) have been widely accepted since the mid-1930s. However, both terms are historical impositions that occurred after the facts they identify.&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt; Neither phase was designated as such at the time corresponding works were created. "If Kahnweiler considers Cubism as Picasso and Braque," wrote [[Daniel Robbins (art historian)|Daniel Robbins]], "our only fault is in subjecting other Cubists' works to the rigors of that limited definition."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt; This interpretation of Cubism, formulated ''post facto'' as a means of understanding the works of Braque and Picasso, is difficult to apply to other Cubist's whose art fundamentally differed from the 'Analytic' or 'Synthetic' categories, compelled Kahnweiler to question their right to be called Cubists at all. According to Robbins, "To suggest that merely because these artists developed differently or varied from the traditional pattern they deserved to be relegated to a secondary or satellite role in Cubism is a profound mistake."&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Daniel Robbins, Guggenheim" /&gt;

Other terms have surfaced since. In his book,''The Cubist Epoch'', [[Douglas Cooper (art historian)|Douglas Cooper]] divides Cubism into three phases: "Early Cubism" (from 1906 to 1908), when the movement was initially developed in the ateliers of Picasso and Braque; "High Cubism" (from 1909 to 1914), during which time [[Juan Gris]] emerged as an important exponent (after 1911); and  "Late Cubism" (from 1914 to 1921), the last phase of Cubism as a radical [[avant-garde]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Cooper, [https://archive.org/stream/cubistepoch00coop#page/n0/mode/2up "The Cubist Epoch"], pp. 11–221, Phaidon Press Limited 1970 in association with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, {{ISBN|0-87587-041-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooper's restrictive use of these terms to distinguish the work of Braque, Picasso, Gris and Léger (to a lesser extent) implied an intentional value judgement, according to Christopher Green.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt;

The current trend in the classification of Cubist styles reflects Apollinaire's wider view of the movement, more so than others. Cubism is once again no longer definitively attached to the art of a specific group or even a movement. It embraces vastly disparate work; applying to artists in different socio-cultural environments and settings. And despite the difficulties of classification, Cubism, as predicted by Apollinaire in 1913, has been called the first and the most influential of all movements in 20th-century art.&lt;ref name="Green, MoMA" /&gt;

===''On Painting''===
Apollinaire stressed the importance of what he perceived as virtues of the [[plastic arts]]: purity, unity, and truth; all of which would keep "nature in subjection". He deplored the violent attacks waged against the Cubist's preoccupation with geometry; geometrical figures being the essence of drawing. "Geometry, the science of space, its dimensions and relations, has always determined the norms and rules of painting."

Before Cubism, the three dimensions of Euclidean geometry had been sufficient for artists. But according to Apollinaire, "geometry is to the plastic arts what grammar is to the art of the writer". Artists, just as scientists, no longer had to limit themselves to three spatial dimensions. They were guided by intuition, to preoccupy themselves with the new possibilities of spatial measurement which included the 'fourth dimension'. This fictitious realm represented the "immensity of space eternalizing itself in all directions at any given moment". This utopian expression stood for the aspiration and premonitions of artists who contemplated Egyptian, African, and oceanic sculptures; who meditated on various scientific works, and who lived "in anticipation of a sublime art".&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

===''New Painters''===

====Picasso====

Picasso, with his planes to denote volume, "gives an enumeration so complete" that objects are entirely transformed, "thanks to the effort of the spectator, who is forced to see all the elements simultaneously". In questioning whether Picasso's art is profound rather than noble, Apollinaire answers, "It does not dispense with the observation of nature, and acts upon us as intimately as nature itself."&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Georges Braque====
It was Braque who, at the [[Salon des Indépendants]] of 1908, first exhibited to the public works whose geometric preoccupations began to dominate the composition. Picasso's work, though not exhibited, set the precedent. This transformation, believed Apollinaire, was in perfect harmony with the society in which the painter evolved. Braque's role was "heroic", his art "peaceful and admirable", writes the poet, "He expresses a beauty, a beauty full of tenderness, and the pearl-like quality of his pictures irradiates our understanding. He is an angelic painter."&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Jean Metzinger====
[[File:Jean Metzinger, portrait photograph, published in Les Peintres Cubistes, 1913.jpg|thumb|Jean Metzinger]]
Metzinger, following Picasso and Braque, was chronologically the third Cubist artist, observed Apollinaire.&lt;ref name="S. E. Johnson"&gt;S. E. Johnson, 1964, ''Metzinger, Pre-Cubist and Cubist Works, 1900–1930'', International Galleries, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt;
Describing Metzinger, Apollinaire claims this 'great painter's work had not yet been fully appreciated, despite the design, composition, the contrasted lights and an overall style'. His works were "set apart" above and beyond many of the works of his contemporaries. "It was then that Jean Metzinger, joining Picasso and Braque, founded the Cubist City."&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

There was "nothing incomplete" in the works of Metzinger. His works were the "fruit of a rigorous logic" writes the author. When explaining the art of our epoch, "his work will be one of the surest documents". Metzinger's paintings contained their own 'explanation'. For Apollinaire this was a case "unique in the history of art".&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt; For Apollinaire, Metzinger had purity; "his meditations take beautiful forms whose harmony tends to approach the sublime... entirely stripped of all that was known before him. [...] Each one of his pictures contains a judgment of the universe and his entire work resembles a nocturnal firmament when it is clear, free from all clouds and trembling with adorable lights. There is nothing incomplete in his works, poetry ennobles the smallest details."&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Albert Gleizes====
[[File:Albert Gleizes, portrait photograph, published in Les Peintres Cubistes, 1913.jpg|thumb|Albert Gleizes]]
The works of Gleizes show "powerful harmonies", but Apollinaire warns of confounding his paintings with the "theoretical cubism" of the "scientific painters". Referring to the writings of Gleizes, Apollinaire cites the will of the artist to "bring back his art to his simplest elements".&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

Gleizes had understood the influence of Cézanne on the Cubists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peterbrooke.org.uk/a&amp;r/gltexts/epic#anchor1044900 Albert Gleizes, ''The Epic, From immobile form to mobile form, From Cézanne to Cubism'', Kubismus, 1928 and Le Rouge et le Noir, 1929, translation by Peter Brooke]&lt;/ref&gt; writes Apollinaire. The work of Gleizes, he continues, has "a degree of plasticity such that all the elements which constitute the individual characters are represented with the same dramatic majesty".&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

Majesty above all characterized the art of Gleizes, bringing a startling innovation to contemporary art, as few of the modern painters had done before. "This majesty arouses and provokes the imagination... the immensity of things. This art is vigorous... realized by a force of the same sort as that which realized the Pyramids and the Cathedrals, the constructions in metal, the bridges and the tunnels."&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Marie Laurencin====
The art of Laurencin (and women more generally) brought a "new vision full of the joy of the universe", an "entirely feminine aesthetic" writes Apollinaire. As an artist, he placed Laurencin between Picasso and Le Douanier Rousseau, not as a hierarchical indication, but as a statement of relationship. "Her art dances, like Salome, between that of Picasso, who like a new John the Baptist bathes all the arts in a baptism of light, and that of Rousseau, a sentimental Herod." The author states the similarities to dance and "rhythmic enumeration, infinitely gracious in painting".&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

:"Feminine Art, the art of Laurencin, tends to become a pure arabesque humanized by an attentive observation of nature, which, being expressive, forsakes simple decoration while remaining just as agreeable."&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=====Henri Rousseau=====
Rousseau had past away in September 1910. Apollinaire made clear the great esteem held by the Cubist painters for his works, calling Rousseau the "Inhabitant of Delight". It was for Apollinaire the qualities of his work that made his painting "so charming to look at". Few artists had been mocked during their lifetime as Rousseau, and even fewer had faced with equal calm the hail of insults. And happily, writes Apollinaire, he "was able to find, in insults and mockeries, evidence that even the ill-intentioned could not disregard his work".&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

[[File:Juan Gris, portrait photograph, published in Les Peintres Cubistes, 1913.jpg|thumb|140px|Juan Gris]]
Rousseau had painted two portraits of Apollinaire: "I often watched him at work, and I know the care he gave to the tiniest details; he had the capacity to keep the original and definitive conception of his picture always before him until he had realized it; and he left nothing, above all, nothing essential, to chance. Its nervous draftsmanship, variety, charm, and delicacy of tones make this work's excellence. His pictures of flowers show the resources of charm and emphasis in the soul and hand of the Douanier."&lt;ref name="The Little Review, vol. 9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;

====Juan Gris====
Gris had "meditated on everything modern", painting "to conceive only new structures" and "materially pure forms".&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2"&gt;[http://modjourn.org/render.php?id=1299783137937502&amp;view=mjp_object The Little Review: Quarterly Journal of Art and Letters, Vol. 9, No. 2: Miscellany Number, Anderson, Margaret C. (editor), New York, 1922-12, Winter 1922, pp. 49-60]&lt;/ref&gt; Apollinaire compares the work of Gris with the "scientific cubism" of Picasso, "his only master", a type of drawing that was geometrical individualized, "a profoundly intellectual art, according to color a merely symbolic significance". His works had "purity, scientifically conceived", and "from this purity parallels are sure to spring".&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Fernand Léger====
Léger is described as a talented artist. "I love his art because it is not scornful, because it knows no servility, and because it does not reason. I love your light colors [''couleurs légers''], O Fernand Léger! Fantasy does not lift you to fairylands, but it grants you all your joys."&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Francis Picabia====
[[File:Francis Picabia, photograph published in Les Peintres Cubistes, 1913.jpg|thumb|140px|Francis Picabia]]
Just as the Impressionists and the Fauves, Picabia "translated light into color", arriving at "an entirely new art". His color was not just a "luminous transposition" without "symbolic significance". It was a "form and light of whatever is represented".&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

As in the works of Robert Delaunay, color was for Picabia "the ideal dimension", one that incorporated all other dimensions. Form was symbolic, while the color remained formal. It was "a perfectly legitimate art, and surely a very subtle one". Color was saturated with energy and prolonged in space.&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

The title for Picabia was intellectually inseparable from the work to which it referred, playing a role as actual objects. Analogous to Picabia's titles, real objects, "are the pictorial arabesques in the backgrounds of Laurencin's pictures. With Albert Gleizes this function is taken by the right angles which retain light, with Fernand Léger by bubbles, with Metzinger by vertical lines, parallel to the sides of the frame cut by infrequent echelons." Apollinaire found equivalence in the works of all the great painters. "It gives pictorial intensity to a painting, and this is enough to justify its legitimacy."&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

It was not a question of abstraction, but of "direct pleasure". Surprise played an important role. "Can the taste of a peach be called abstract?" mused the author. Each picture of Picabia "has a definite existence, the limits of which are set by the title". Picabia's paintings were so far from ''a priori'' abstractions that "the painter can tell you the history of each one of them. ''Dance at the Spring'' is simply the expression of a plastic emotion experienced spontaneously near Naples".&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

[[File:Marcel Duchamp, photograph published in Les Peintres Cubistes, 1913.jpg|thumb|110px|Marcel Duchamp]]

====Marcel Duchamp====
To date, Duchamp's production had been too spars and differed considerably from one painting to the next. Apollinaire hesitated to make any broad generalizations, noting rather Duchamp's apparent talent and his abandoning of "the cult of appearances". To free his art from all perceptions, Duchamp wrote the titles on the paintings themselves. "This literature, which so few painters have been able to avoid, disappears from his art, but not poetry. He uses forms and colors, not to render appearances, but to penetrate the essential nature of forms and formal colors... Perhaps it will be the task of an artist as detached from aesthetic preoccupations, and as intent on the energetic as Marcel Duchamp, to reconcile art and the people."&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

====Duchamp-Villon====
The departure of sculpture from nature tends toward architecture, writes Apollinaire: "The utilitarian end aimed at by most contemporary architects is responsible for the great backwardness of architecture as compared with the other arts. The architect, the engineer should have sublime aims: to build the highest tower, to prepare for time and ivy the most beautiful of ruins, to throw across a harbor or a river an arch more audacious than the rainbow, and finally to compose to a lasting harmony, the most powerful ever imagined by man. Duchamp-Villon had this titanic conception of architecture. A sculptor and an architect, light is the only thing that count for him; but in all the arts, also, it is only light, the incorruptible light, that counts."&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

====Note====
Besides the artists of whom Apollinaire writes in preceding chapters, there were other artists and writers alike attached, "whether willingly or not", to the Cubist movement. ''Scientific Cubism'' was defended by [[Ricciotto Canudo]], Jacques Nayral, [[André Salmon]], Joseph Granié, [[Maurice Raynal]], [[Marc Brésil]], [[Alexandre Mercereau]], [[Pierre Reverdy]], André Tudesq, {{Interlanguage link multi|André Warnod|fr}}, Georges Deniker, [[Jacques Villon]], and [[Louis Marcoussis]]. ''Physical Cubism'' was supported in the press by the writers listed above, in addition to {{Interlanguage link multi|Roger Allard|fr}}, [[Olivier Hourcade]], [[Jean Marchand (painter)|Jean Marchand]], [[Auguste Herbin]], and Véra. ''Orphic Cubism'' was defended by [[Max Goth]], [[Pierre Dumont (painter)|Pierre Dumont]] and {{Interlanguage link multi|Henry Valensi|fr}}. Certain artists associated with ''Instinctive Cubism'' were supported by [[Louis Vauxcelles]], [[René Blum (ballet)]], Adilphe Basler, [[Gustave Kahn]], [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]], and Michel Puy. According to Apollinaire this trend included [[Henri Matisse]], [[Georges Rouault]], [[André Derain]], [[Raoul Dufy]], [[Auguste Chabaud]], [[Jean Puy]], [[Kees van Dongen]], [[Gino Severini]], and [[Umberto Boccioni]]. In addition to Duchamp-Villon, other Cubist sculptors included [[Auguste Agéro]], [[Alexander Archipenko]], and [[Constantin Brâncuși]].&lt;ref name="Chipp, Selz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Little Review, Vol. 9, No. 2" /&gt;

'''''The Object of My Affection''''' is a 1998 American [[romance film|romantic]] [[comedy-drama]] film directed by [[Nicholas Hytner]] and starring [[Jennifer Aniston]] and [[Paul Rudd]]. The film was adapted from the [[The Object of My Affection (novel)|novel of the same name]] by [[Stephen McCauley]] and the screenplay was written by [[Wendy Wasserstein]]. The story concerns a pregnant New York social worker who develops romantic feelings for her [[gay]] best friend and decides to raise her child with him, and the complications that ensue.

The film was filmed in 1997 in various locations around [[New York City]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120772/locations IMDb.com filming locations – ''The Object of My Affection'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Social worker Nina Borowski ([[Jennifer Aniston]]) is a bright young woman living in a cozy [[Brooklyn]] apartment. Nina attends a party given by her [[stepsister]] Constance ([[Allison Janney]]) and her husband, Sidney ([[Alan Alda]]). There Nina meets George Hanson ([[Paul Rudd]]), a young, handsome, and gay first grade teacher. Nina tells George that her stepsister is constantly trying to fix her up with somebody from higher society, completely ignoring the fact that Nina has a boyfriend, Vince ([[John Pankow]]). During the conversation, Nina offers George a room in her apartment as she has just heard from his boyfriend, Dr. Robert Joley ([[Tim Daly]]), that George is looking for somewhere to live. George, not knowing about Robert's plans, is taken aback and heartbroken, and after the party the two split up. George accepts Nina's offer and moves into her apartment.

The two soon become best friends; they watch films together and go [[ballroom dancing]]. Everything is great until Nina announces that she is pregnant. Vince, the baby's father, wants to marry her, but his constant care drives Nina crazy; she leaves him and asks George to help raise her child. For some time, they live together in her apartment in Brooklyn. Everything is perfect again until Nina finds that her love for George is growing every day, especially after he tells her he had a girlfriend in high school, leading her to believe they might have a sexual relationship.

One afternoon, George and Nina are about to have sex when George gets a phone call from Robert who tells him how much he has missed him and invites him away for the weekend. George is confused but agrees to go. Nina feels threatened and gets jealous. George and Robert do not re-establish their relationship, but George meets Paul James ([[Amo Gulinello]]), a young actor, and the two fall in love and have sex. Meanwhile, Nina is staying with Constance at a vacation mansion and is extremely moody. She has a horrible time and decides to head back home and asks George to return as well. She is mugged on the way and a friendly police officer, Louis ([[Kevin Carroll (actor)|Kevin Carroll]]), gives her a ride home. Nina and George decide to invite Paul and his elderly acting mentor, Rodney, for [[Thanksgiving]]. Paul stays the night and has sex with George, resulting in a fallout between George and Nina.

The following day, they start arguing again at George's brother's wedding. Nina fully explains to George her feelings for him. George, who loves Nina as his best friend, tells her that he wants to be with Paul. A few hours later, Nina gives birth to a beautiful girl she names Molly. Vince, ecstatic, visits her in the hospital, but when he leaves to complete paperwork, Nina and George remain alone with Molly. Nina asks George when he plans to move out to which he replies that he doesn't know. She asks him to move out of her apartment before she gets home from hospital, stating that it would hurt her too much to have him stay any longer knowing that he doesn't love her.

The end of the film takes place at George's school eight years later, in which all of the characters go to see Molly in a musical production that George has directed. Nina is now in a relationship with Louis, and George is with Paul, both of them now happy. The film ends as Nina, George, and young Molly ([[Sarah Hyland]]) (who refers to George as her "Uncle George") walk together down the sidewalk, hand-in-hand, on their way to get coffee.

{{Distinguish|Vitrography|Vitrigraph (disambiguation){{!}}Vitrigraph}} 

'''Vitreography''' is a fine art printmaking technique that uses a {{convert|3/8|in|mm|adj=mid|-thick}} [[float glass]] matrix instead of the traditional matrices of metal, wood or stone. A print created using the technique is called a vitreograph. Unlike a [[monotype]], in which ink is painted onto a smooth glass plate and transferred to paper to produce a unique work, the vitreograph technique involves fixing the imagery in, or on, the glass plate. This allows the production of an [[edition (printmaking)|edition]] of prints.

[[File:Pilchuck Summer cropped web.jpg|thumb|'''Glen Alps, ''Pilchuck Summer''''' (1987) Edition of 40. Plate size: 18 × 24 inches. This color print on paper is an intaglio vitreograph. It was printed from a glass matrix.]]

==Advantages/disadvantages of vitreography==

In addition to being relatively inexpensive, glass is chemically inert. It does not oxidize, nor does it change or interact with the composition of printing inks, especially yellows and whites, which can turn green or gray in contact with metal plates.&lt;ref&gt;Lidh, W. (1986) “Prints from Glass”, Introduction. Western Carolina University, Cullowhee, NC,&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Claire Van Vliet]] of Janus Press, intaglio vitreographs also have an advantage over metal in that the glass plate wipes cleanly in non-image areas, allowing bright white to coincide with “black that is velvety as a [[mezzotint]]” in the finished print.&lt;ref&gt;McLean, G. (1999) “In Black and White: Landscape Prints by Claire Van Vliet”, page 61. Stinehour Press, Vermont&lt;/ref&gt;

Another advantage of vitreograph printmaking is its ability to withstand the pressure of the printing press with no discernible breakdown of the imagery, even after numerous runs. Printmaker [[Ken Kerslake]] wrote, “The glass plate will last indefinitely because, unlike [one of] copper or zinc, it will always return to its original configuration no matter how much pressure is applied.”&lt;ref&gt;Kerslake(1998) “Vitreography: The Art and Technique of the Glass Print”, page 46. Glass Art, Vol. 13 No. 3&lt;/ref&gt; A disadvantage to this is that unwanted lines or marks on the glass plate cannot be burnished out, as they can on a zinc or copper plate.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, (1987) “Luminous Impressions: Prints from Glass Plates”, page 12. Mint Museum, Department of Art, Charlotte, NC&lt;/ref&gt; 

The transparency of the glass plate can be used to advantage, in that the plate may be placed over a preliminary drawing on paper to guide the artist in creating a drawing on the plate. This is done by placing the drawing face down on a light table (to allow for the reversal of the image in printing) and placing the vitreograph plate on top of it.&lt;ref&gt;Byrd, J. Falconer (1998) “Littreography”, page 15, special edition reprinted with permission of GLASS: the Urban Glass Quarterly, Number 72, Fall 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
Although glass is unaffected by compression in the printing press, it will break under tension. For that reason, vitreographs are always printed on an etching press, whose rigid bed will support the glass plate firmly.&lt;ref&gt;Kerslake (1998) page 46&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the press bed must be level and working conditions in the print shop immaculate. A particle of grit or dirt between press bed and the plate will create a tension point that will cause the glass to crack when pressure is applied.&lt;ref&gt;Kerslake, 1998, page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of vitreography==

American glass artist [[Harvey Littleton]] was a tenured professor of art at the University of Wisconsin in Madison when, in June 1974, he taught a workshop in cold-working techniques for glass artists.&lt;ref&gt;The workshop was supported by the University of Wisconsin Research Committee, The [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and Corning Glassworks. Corning sent a glasscutter and glass engraver to assist Littleton in teaching the workshop. Byrd, J. Falconer (2004) page 29. Archives of American Art Journal, Volume 44 Numbers 3-4&lt;/ref&gt; To cold-work glass is to shape or sculpt cold (as opposed to hot or molten) glass, or to produce texture or decoration on its surface. Cold-working is done by carving, grinding or engraving glass with various tools, or by selectively blasting it with abrasives. As a result of experimenting with various resists for sandblasting, Littleton became intrigued by the possibility of printmaking from glass.&lt;ref&gt;Littleton said that the experimental plates from the workshop stayed in his studio for about three weeks. As he related to Joan Byrd during a 2001 interview, “I kept looking at them and decided they really ought to be printed.” Byrd (2004) page 29&lt;/ref&gt; He asked his colleague at the University of Wisconsin, printmaker [[Warrington Colescott]], to ink five of the sandblasted plates from the workshop and print them onto paper in his etching press. The first plate broke under pressure, but after making some adjustments to the press, the rest of the glass plates printed “like dreamboats,” Colescott said.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, page 7&lt;/ref&gt; Editions printed from the plates looked promising, and Littleton was awarded a research grant from the University of Wisconsin to continue the development of printing from glass.&lt;ref name="Lidh 1986 Introduction"&gt;Lidh (1986) Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976 Littleton retired from teaching and moved to Spruce Pine, North Carolina, where he set up a glass studio, reserving space for an etching press on which he continued to make vitreograph prints. A few years later, at the end of 1981, he hired a [[woodcut]] artist, Sandy Willcox, to work as a part-time printer. He encouraged her and his colleagues in glass art, including Ken Carder, Billy Bernstein, Erwin Eisch and Ann Wolff (formerly Wärff), to try their hands at vitreography.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler (1987) page 7&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1982 Littleton invited curator Jane Kessler of the Mint Museum in Charlotte, North Carolina to see the prints that were being created at Littleton Studios. Kessler was impressed by the new technique, and recommended that experienced painters and printmakers be invited to the studio to explore the medium. A grant awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts made it possible for three painters, [[Walter Darby Bannard]], Ed Blackburn and [[Hollis Sigler]] to collaborate with two master printers, Paul Maguire of Flatrock Press and June Lambla, who had apprenticed at Crown Point Press, in the creation of prints at Littleton Studios. By this time Littleton had constructed a fully equipped printmaking studio that was separate from his glassblowing shop.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler, 1987, page 9&lt;/ref&gt; Sigler visited Littleton Studios in 1985 and produced five prints; Blackburn produced five prints in 1986 and Bannard created seven prints in 1987. The project led to an exhibition at the Mint Museum in 1987 that included a catalog detailing these and other artists’ research in glass plate printmaking. Littleton continued to invite painters, printmakers, potters and glass artists to the studio to fully develop the possibilities of vitreography. Littleton Studios has published vitreograph print editions by 110 artists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.littletoncollection.com] referenced May 20, 2008.

==Processes==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jack web smaller size.jpg|thumb|'''David Dodge Lewis, ''Jack''''' (1983) Edition of 40, Plate size: 18 × 24 inches. This intaglio vitreograph is the result of a using white lithographic ink as a sandblast resist.  {{Deletable image-caption|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;

Vitreography was initially conceived of as an [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] process, in which line and tone are carved, engraved or etched into the glass plate’s surface. Printing an intaglio plate involves forcing ink into the grooves and pits, and then wiping the plate’s surface with tarlatan &lt;ref&gt;Tarlatan is a stiff muslin used by etchers to wipe excess ink from intaglio plates.&lt;/ref&gt; to remove excess ink. The image is transferred to dampened paper under pressure in an etching press.&lt;ref&gt;Petrie, K. (2006) Glass and Print, University of Pennsylvania Press, {{ISBN|0-8122-1946-5}} page 115&lt;/ref&gt; 
Color intaglio prints are achieved by processing separate plates, each carrying one or more colors in proportion to the effect desired in the print. The plates are printed in succession onto paper, each carrying color and imagery that, in register with the others, combine to form the finished print.&lt;ref&gt;Kerslake (1998) page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Tools used to make marks in the glass include diamond point scribers, a flexible shaft power tool with a diamond bit and a sandblaster. Littleton Studios printer Sandy Willcox and her husband David Lewis, a painter, are credited with discovering that white lithograph ink is a versatile resist for [[sandblasting]] intaglio glass plates. They found that the viscous white ink, applied to the plate freely with a brush or evenly with a roller, can be drawn into by removing ink with wooden styluses, needles, or paintbrushes. When the drawing is complete, the plate is taken to the sandblasting booth wet. There, the initial onslaught of sand sticks to those areas of the image where ink remains (forming an even more resistant barrier) while etching those parts of the glass revealed by the hand of the artist. After the plate is cleaned of ink, the parts of the plate that received the blast can be seen to have minute pits that hold ink; the areas that were protected by the white litho ink remain smooth and are wiped clean before printing.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler (1987) pages 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; [[Contact paper]] and tape are also used on the plates as a sandblasting resist; those materials create imagery with a hard-edged, stencil effect. Diluted [[hydrofluoric acid]] can be brushed onto the plate to create areas of very delicate tone.&lt;ref&gt;Kerslake (1998) page 45&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Soul Sleeper web.jpg|thumb|'''Judith O'Rourke, ''Soul Sleeper''''' (1996) Edition of 10, Plate size: 12½ × 17½ inches. This print was made using the technique of siligraphy on a glass vitreograph plate. It is printed in four colors on paper.]]

A second method of creating imagery on the vitreograph plate is waterless lithography (sometimes called “siligraphy”). The process was originally developed by [[3M Company]] for commercial printing in the late 1960s; it was purchased and subsequently refined by [[Toray Industries]] of Japan. The commercial process is a type of [[offset printing]] that uses photo-sensitized silicone rubber plates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://printwiki.org/Waterless_Lithography Waterless Lithography - PrintWiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The waterless lithography process employed in fine art printmaking has been credited to Nik Semenoff, who developed it for use on metal plates.&lt;ref&gt;Semenoff, N. [http://www.polymetaal.nl/beguin/mapw/waterlesslithography/waterlesslitho01.htm]
“Waterless Lithography Using Common Caulking Silicone”, accessed May 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;
Donald Furst demonstrated his adaptation of the silicone method to glass plate printmaking in June, 1995, and the Littleton Studios adopted his process for their work with glass plate lithography.&lt;ref&gt;According to Judith O'Rourke, master printer at Littleton Studios, printmaker Donald Furst showed the staff of Littleton Studios how to combine solvent with silicone to form a solution. Telephone call to Judith O'Rourke at Littleton Studios on 7/02/09.&lt;/ref&gt; The image is drawn onto a ground glass matrix with water-soluble art materials, over which is applied a film of common caulking [[silicone]] thinned with synthetic turpentine. Master printer Mark Mahaffey has found that frosted [[Mylar]] can be used as a printing matrix as well as 3/8” float glass to create a vitreograph using waterless lithography.&lt;ref&gt;Mahaffey, M. [http://www.baschwar.com/printmakers/Vitreography111499/index.html] “Vitreography Demonstration”, Accessed May 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
After the silicone layer cures, the original drawing is gently washed from the plate with water, dried, and inked with a roller. The silicone layer protects the non-printing areas of the image while allowing open areas (those free of silicone) to accept ink.&lt;ref&gt;Waggoner, S. (1998) “The Vitreographer”, page 48. Glass Art, Vol. 13 No. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Like intaglio vitreographs, waterless lithographs on glass plates are transferred to paper in an etching press.

In 1998 Littleton invited three artists, Bonnie Pierce Lhotka, Karin Schminke and Dorothy Simpson Krause (collectively known as the Digital Atelier), to investigate combining digital imagery with vitreography processes.&lt;ref&gt;Schminke et al. (2004) “Digital Art Studio: Techniques for Combining Inkjet Printing with Traditional Art Materials”, page 118. Watson-Guptill Publications, New York {{ISBN|0-8230-1342-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The artists printed digital images onto clear transfer film using a large format inkjet printer, transferring them to paper in the etching press, along with glass plate imagery processed in the intaglio and/or siligraph techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Schminke et al. (2004) page 118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artists at Littleton Studios==

Since 1981 over 100 artists have worked in collaboration with Littleton Studios to publish vitreograph prints. They include Harvey Littleton's colleagues in glass art, [[Dale Chihuly]], [[Erwin Eisch]], [[Shane Fero]], [[Stanislav Libenský/Jaroslava Brychtová|Stanislav Libenský]], [[Paul Joseph Stankard|Paul Stankard]], [[Therman Statom]], [[Sybren Valkema]] and Ann Wolff. Littleton also invited painters, sculptors and printmakers to Littleton Studios to explore the possibilities and limitations of vitreography. Painters [[Walter Darby Bannard]], Louisa Chase, [[Herb Jackson]], [[Mildred Thompson]], [[Emilio Vedova]] and [[John Wilde]]; potters Cynthia Bringle and John Glick, sculptors [[Sergei Isupov]] and [[Italo Scanga]] and printmakers [[Glen Alps]], [[Ken Kerslake]], Karen Kunc, Judith O’Rourke and Dan Welden are a few of the artists whose work has been published by the studio.&lt;ref&gt;Telephone conversation with Ellen Fischer, Director of The Littleton Collection art gallery, March 10, 1009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exhibition of vitreographs==

The first public exhibition of Littleton’s own intaglio prints from glass plates was at the Brooks Memorial Art Museum in Memphis, Tennessee in 1975. There the prints were shown along with Littleton’s glass sculptures.&lt;ref name="Lidh 1986 Introduction"/&gt; The same was the case with Ann Wolff’s glass plate intaglios, which were included in a show of her glass artworks, drawings and copper plate intaglios in 1986 at Holsten Galleries in Palm Beach.&lt;ref&gt;Holsten, C &amp; Holsten, K. (1986) “Ann Wolff”, Pages 18–19. Holsten Galleries, Palm Beach, FL&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first group exhibition of the prints to include works by painters and printmakers, as well as glass artists, was at Western Carolina University in Cullowhee, North Carolina in 1986. Seventeen artists were represented in the exhibition, all of whom had created their prints at Littleton Studios.&lt;ref&gt;Lidh, W. 1986, Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Mint Museum mounted another group exhibition in 1987 titled Luminous Impressions: Prints from Glass Plates. It featured vitreographs by nineteen artists and included prints by glass artist [[Dale Chihuly]] and California printmaker Connor Everts.&lt;ref&gt;Kessler 1987, pages 36–37&lt;/ref&gt; Everts is credited with coining the term “vitreography” to describe printmaking from glass plates.&lt;ref&gt;Kerslake, K. (2001) The Vitreographic Image: A Selection of Glass Prints from The Littleton Studios, Belk Gallery, Western Carolina University, Cullowhee, NC (unpaginated)&lt;/ref&gt; Another early group exhibition took place in 1988 at the Kunstsammlungen der Veste Coburg in Coburg, Germany. Titled "Prints from Glass Plates - Vitreographs,"  the show featured works by Americans and two Germans:  Erwin Eisch and Ann Wolff.&lt;ref&gt;Neue Presse, "Glas als Gefãß und als Druck-Werkstoff", March 19, 1988, Coburg, Germany&lt;/ref&gt; 

Other notable group exhibitions include ''Vitreographs: Collaborative Works from the Littleton Studio'' which was exhibited at The [[Hunter Museum of American Art]] in Chattanooga, Tennessee and The University Gallery at The University of Florida at Gainesville (both in 1993); “Vitreographs” at The Portland Art Museum in Portland, Oregon in 1997 and “Vitreographs: Collaborative Works from Littleton Studio” at the Center for the Arts in Vero Beach, Florida in 1998.

Recent group exhibitions include ''Reflections on a Legacy: Vitreographs from Littleton Studios'' at [[Appalachian State University]] in Boone, North Carolina (2006) and ''Harvey K. Littleton + Friends: A Legacy of Transforming Object, Image &amp; Idea,'' at [[Western Carolina University]] in Cullowhee, North Carolina (2006–07).  The latter was an exhibition of the work of 75 artworks by seventeen artists, and included vitreographs alongside works in glass, clay, ceramic, painting and book art. Curator Martin DeWitt wrote in the catalog accompanying the exhibition that “Not only is Littleton credited to be the father of the contemporary studio glass movement in the United States…he is also inventor and progenitor of the versatile and unique vitreographic printmaking process.” &lt;ref&gt;De Witt, M. (2006) Fine Art Museum at the Fine &amp; Performing Arts Center, Western Carolina University, The University of North Carolina, Page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vitreographs in public collections==

Vitreograph prints can be found in collections in the United States, including the Achenbach Foundation for Graphic Art, San Francisco; Burroughs Chapin Art Museum, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; [[Cincinnati Art Museum]], Cincinnati, Ohio; The [[Corning Museum of Glass]], Corning, New York; [[Samuel P. Harn Museum of Art]], University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida; [[Milwaukee Art Museum]], Milwaukee, Wisconsin; Museum of Fine Arts, [[New Britain Museum of American Art]], New Britain Connecticut which holds an archive of over 500 vitreographs, St. Petersburg, Florida; [[Portland Art Museum]], Portland, Oregon; Sherwin Miller Museum of Jewish Art, Tulsa, Oklahoma; [[Smithsonian American Art Museum]], Washington, DC; [[Tweed Museum of Art]], Duluth, Minnesota and the [[Vero Beach Museum of Art]], Vero Beach, Florida. The Fine Art Museum of Western Carolina University holds an archive of 723 vitreograph editions published at Littleton Studios.&lt;ref&gt;Executive Director Martin De Witt, telephone conversation May 21, 2008, Fine and Performing Arts Center, [[Western Carolina University]], Cullowhee, North Carolina&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wakker Prize''' (in German: ''Wakkerpreis'', in French ''Prix Wakker'', in Italian ''Premio Wakker'') is awarded annually by the [[Swiss Heritage Society]] to a [[Municipality of Switzerland]] for the development and preservation of its architectural heritage.

At the beginning, the prize honoured municipalities which did special needs for preservation of the old towns. Recently,{{When|date=January 2015}} the prize also honours municipalities that develop their townscapes on a specific leading point. This might be an estimated use of an old industrial facility or a successful combination between old and new basic structure of a building.

In 2005, the prize was given to the [[Swiss Federal Railways]], rather than a municipality, because of the jubilee of the Swiss Heritage Society.

The prize is named for [[Henri-Louis Wakker]].

==Criteria==
To get this prize, municipalities have to follow the named criteria:
* A visible, qualitative development and upgrading of townscape in a contemporary manner.
* To be respectful towards with old settlement pattern.
* An active input for above-average architectural quality, due to a good example of the municipality.
* The current place-planning prefers the development of the prize.
* At the end are following issues important for the overall assessment, protection of the area, sustainability, traffic planning and residential quality.
