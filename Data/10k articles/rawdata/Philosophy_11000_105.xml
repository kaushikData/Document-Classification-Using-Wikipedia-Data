{{quote box|width=25%|quote='''“We migrated key functions from Windows to Linux because we needed an operating system that was stable and reliable -- one that would give us in-house control.

The use of [[free software]] instead of [[proprietary software]] can give institutions better control over information technology. Therefore, a growing number of public institutions started a transition to free-software solutions. This does not only grant independence but can address the often argued need for public access to publicly-funded developments. In addition, this is the only way that public services can ensure that citizen data is handled in a trustworthy manner since non-free software wouldn't allow total control (or even knowledge) over the employed functions of the needed programs.

== Asia ==

=== India ===

====Assam====
The Government of [[Assam]] state made open source a part of its IT policy.&lt;ref name="assamitpolicy"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://assamgovt.nic.in/pdf/ITPOLICY-2009-Final-Gazette-Style.pdf |title=Assam government IT Policy |access-date=2018-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716031024/http://assamgovt.nic.in/pdf/ITPOLICY-2009-Final-Gazette-Style.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="assamitpolicy2"&gt;[http://osindia.blogspot.com/2009/12/yet-another-indian-state-government.html Open Source India News]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kerala====
The Government of [[Kerala]], India, announced its official support for free/open-source software in its State IT Policy of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan002950.pdf | title="Role of Open or Free Software", Section 15, page 20, of the State IT Policy (2001) of the Government of Kerala, copy available at the UN Public Administration Network (UNPAN) site}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was formulated after the first-ever free-software conference in India, "Freedom First!", held in July 2001 in Thiruvananthapuram, the capital of Kerala, where Richard Stallman inaugurated the Free Software Foundation of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.gnu.org/press/2001-07-20-FSF-India.html | title=Press release from GNU Project, July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kerala's Government's support for Free Software in 2001 is perhaps the earliest instance of a Government supporting the use of Free Software.

Under the IT@School project the government of [[Kerala]] has adopted free and open sourced software for the schools.&lt;ref name="keralaschools"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://teck.in/news/kerala-opted-free-and-open-software-for-it-school-project-t377.html |title=Kerala opted for foss  |access-date=2018-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100530101541/http://teck.in/news/kerala-opted-free-and-open-software-for-it-school-project-t377.html |archive-date=2010-05-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Romania ===

IOSSPL is a free and open source software used for public libraries in Romania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iosspl.org/ IOSSPL]&lt;/ref&gt;

== North America ==

=== United States ===
In September, the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] announced its formal adoption of the OpenDocument standard for all Commonwealth entities.&lt;ref name="casson_ryan" /&gt;

In February 2009, the [[United States]] [[White House]] moved its website to Linux servers using [[Drupal]] for content management.&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan-Nichols, Steven J. [http://www.pcworld.com/article/174746/obama_invites_open_source_into_the_white_house.html "Obama Invites Open Source into the White House"] in ''PCWorld'', 29 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, the [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] announced a new federal [[source-code]] policy. This policy mandates that at least 20% of custom source code developed by or for any agency of the federal government must be released as [[open-source software]] (OSS).&lt;ref name="scott-and-rung-2016"&gt;{{cite book

}} Also available as HTML at: {{url|https://sourcecode.cio.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the policy requires that all source code be shared between agencies.  The public release is under a three-year pilot program and agencies are obliged to collect data on this pilot to gauge its performance. The overall policy aims to reduce duplication, avoid vendor 'lock-in', and stimulate collaborative development. A new website {{url|code.gov}} provides "an online collection of tools, best practices, and schemas to help agencies implement this policy", the policy announcement stated. It also provides the "primary discoverability portal for custom-developed software intended both for Government-wide reuse and for release as OSS".&lt;ref name="scott-and-rung-2016"/&gt;  As yet unspecified [[Open-source license|OSS licenses]] will be added to the code.&lt;ref name="new-2016"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The US Chief Information Officer Tony Scott, co-author of the policy, blogged "This is, after all, the People's code. Explore it. Learn from it. Improve it. Use it to propel America's next breakthrough in innovation."&lt;ref name="scott-2016"&gt;

== South America ==

=== Brazil ===
The government of [[Brazil]] migrated from Microsoft Windows to Linux.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4471963 NPR: Brazil Makes Move to Open Source Software&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4602325.stm BBC NEWS | Business | Brazil adopts open-source software&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[Federal government of Brazil|Brazilian government]] also encouraged the distribution of cheap computers running Linux throughout its poorer communities by subsidizing their purchase with tax breaks.&lt;ref name="casson_ryan"/&gt;

=== Ecuador ===
In April, [[Ecuador]] passed a similar law, Decree 1014, designed to migrate the public sector to Libre Software.&lt;ref&gt;{{es icon}} [http://www.estebanmendieta.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/Decreto_1014_software_libre_Ecuador.pdf Estebanmendieta.com], Decree 1014&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Peru ===
In 2005, the [[Government of Peru]] voted to adopt open source across all its bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clarke |first=Gavin |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/09/29/peru_goes_open_source/ |title=TheRegister.co.uk |work=TheRegister.co.uk |date=29 September 2005 |accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2002 response to Microsoft's critique is available online. In the preamble to the bill, the Peruvian government stressed that the choice was made to ensure that key pillars of [[democracy]] were safeguarded: "The basic principles which inspire the Bill are linked to the basic guarantees of a state of law."&lt;ref name="NACI"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.naci.org.za/pdfs/floss_v2_6_9.pdf|title = Free/Libre &amp; Open Source Software and Open Standards in South Africa |accessdate =31 May 2008|last = National Advisory Council on Innovation Open Software Working Group |authorlink = |date=July 2004|format=PDF|archiveurl=http://www.gissa.org.za/special-interest-groups/open-source/foss-documents/foss-advisory-document/at_download/file|archivedate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Venezuela ===
In 2004, a law in [[Venezuela]] (Decree 3390) went into effect, mandating a two-year transition to open source in all public agencies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15383">'''Affect''' (from [[Latin]] ''affectus'' or ''adfectus'') is a [[concept]], used in the [[philosophy]] of [[Baruch Spinoza]] and elaborated by [[Henri Bergson]], [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], that places emphasis on bodily or [[Embodied cognition|embodied]] experience. The concept of [[Affect (psychology)|affect]] takes on a different meaning in [[psychology]] and other fields. 

For Spinoza, as discussed in Parts Two and Three of his ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', affects are states of mind and body that are related to (but not exactly synonymous with) feelings and emotions, of which he says there are three primary kinds: pleasure or joy (''laetitia''),&lt;ref name="Spinoza2001a"&gt;Part III, Proposition 56. {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent philosophical usage by Gilles Deleuze, Félix Guattari and their translator Brian Massumi, while derived explicitly from Spinoza, tends to distinguish more sharply than Spinoza does between affect and what are conventionally called emotions. Affects are difficult to grasp and conceptualize because, as Spinoza says, "an affect or passion of the mind [''animi pathema''] is a confused idea" which is only perceived by the increase or decrease it causes in the body's vital force.&lt;ref name="Spinoza2001c"&gt;''Existendi vis'' or power of existence. {{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "affect" is central to what has become known as the "affective turn" in the humanities and social sciences.

== In Spinoza ==
In [[Baruch Spinoza]]'s ''[[Ethics (Spinoza)|Ethics]]'', Part III Definition 3, the term "affect" (''affectus'', traditionally translated as "emotion")&lt;ref&gt;Of the two "standard" English translations, the version by Samuel Shirley uses "emotion" for ''affectus'', whereas the more recent rendering by Edwin Curley uses "affect". {{cite book

Affect is thus a special case of the more neutral term "affection" (''affectio''), which designates the form "taken on" by some thing,&lt;ref name="SpinozaShirley1992"&gt;Samuel Shirley, "Translator's Preface". {{cite book

In Part III, "Definitions of the Emotions/Affects", Spinoza defines 48 different forms of affect, including love and hatred, hope and fear, envy and compassion. They are nearly all manifestations of the three basic affects of:
* desire (''cupiditas'') or appetite (''appetitus''), defined as "the very essence of man insofar as his essence is conceived as determined to any action from any given affection of itself";&lt;ref name=SpinozaCurley1994b&gt;{{cite book |last=Spinoza |first=Benedictus de |authorlink=Baruch Spinoza |others=Trans. by Edwin M. Curley |title=A Spinoza Reader: The Ethics and Other Works |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5yeKQgAACAAJ |accessdate=27 November 2011 |year=1994 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton and Chichester |isbn=978-0-691-00067-1 |page=311}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* pleasure (''laetitia''), defined as "man's transition from a state of less perfection to a state of greater perfection";&lt;ref name=SpinozaCurley1994b /&gt; and
* pain or sorrow (''tristitia''), defined as "man's transition from a state of greater perfection to a state of less perfection".&lt;ref name=SpinozaCurley1994b /&gt;
In Spinoza's view, since God's power of activity is infinite, any affection which increases the organism's power of activity leads to greater perfection. Affects are transitional states or modes in that they are vital forces by which the organism strives to act against other forces which act on it and continually resist it or hold it in check.&lt;ref name="Kisner2011"&gt;{{cite book

== In Bergson ==
[[Henri Bergson]] contends in ''[[Matter and Memory]]'' (1896) that we do not know our body only "from without" by [[perception]]s, but also "from within" by affections (French: ''affections'').&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''Matter and Memory'' (1896), [https://brocku.ca/MeadProject/Bergson/Bergson_1911b/Bergson_1911_01.html ch. 1].&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Deleuze and Guattari ==
The terms "affect" and "affection" came to prominence in [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]]'s ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'', the second volume of ''Capitalism and Schizophrenia''. In his notes on the terminology employed, the translator Brian Massumi gives the following definitions of the terms as used in the volume:
:AFFECT/AFFECTION. Neither word denotes a personal feeling (''sentiment'' in Deleuze and Guattari). ''L'affect'' (Spinoza's ''affectus'') is an ability to affect and be affected. It is a prepersonal intensity corresponding to the passage from one experiential state of the body to another and implying an augmentation or diminution in that body's capacity to act. ''L'affection'' (Spinoza's ''affectio'') is each such state considered as an encounter between the affected body and a second, affecting, body (with body taken in its broadest possible sense to include "mental" or ideal bodies).&lt;ref name="DeleuzeGuattari1987"&gt;{{cite book

Affects, according to Deleuze, are not simple [[affection]]s, as they are independent from their [[subject (philosophy)|subject]].
Artists create affects and [[percept]]s, "blocks of space-time", whereas science works with functions, according to Deleuze, and philosophy creates concepts.

== Affective turn&lt;!--'Affective turn' redirects here--&gt; ==
Since 2000, a number of authors in the social sciences and humanities have begun to explore affect theory as a way of understanding spheres of experience (including bodily experience) which fall outside of the dominant paradigm of representation (based on [[rhetoric]] and [[semiotics]]); this movement has been called the &lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;'''affective turn'''.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Ticineto Clough, [[Jean Halley]] (eds.), ''The Affective Turn: Theorizing the Social'', Duke University Press, 2007, p. 1; Paul Hoggett, Simon Thompson (eds.), ''Politics and the Emotions: The Affective Turn in Contemporary Political Studies'', Bloomsbury, 2012, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, these approaches are interested in the widest possible variety of interactions and encounters, interactions and encounters that are not necessarily limited to human sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seyfert|first=Robert |year=2012|title=Beyond Personal Feelings and Collective Emotions: A Theory of Social Affect|journal=Theory, Culture &amp; Society|volume=29/6|pages= 35|doi=10.1177/0263276412438591}}&lt;/ref&gt; The translator of Deleuze and Guattari's ''[[A Thousand Plateaus]]'', Canadian political philosopher [[Brian Massumi]], has given influential definitions of affect (see above) and has written on the neglected importance of movement and sensation in cultural formations and our interaction with real and virtual worlds.&lt;ref name="Massumi2002"&gt;  {{cite book

This step will be necessary for cognitive science, Mog Stapleton maintains, to be "properly embodied" [[cognitive science]].

[[File:Ahmad fardid.jpg|thumb|Ahmad Fardid]]
[[Seyyed]] '''Ahmad Fardid''' ({{lang-fa|سید احمد فردید}}) (Born in 1912,&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.maxwell.syr.edu/mborouje/ Boroujerdi, Mehzad] ''[https://books.google.ca/books?id=B6gRGzqz4WsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA63#v=onepage&amp;q=1912&amp;f=false Iranian Intellectuals and the West: The Tormented Triumphs of Nativism]''. Syracuse: Syracuse UP, pp. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yazd]] – 16 August 1994, [[Tehran]]), born '''Ahmad Mahini Yazdi''',&lt;ref&gt;Farhang Rajaee, ''Islamism and Modernism: The Changing Discourse in Iran'', University of Texas Press (2010), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; was a prominent [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[philosopher]] and an inspiring and dedicated professor of [[Tehran University]]. He is considered to be among the philosophical ideologues of the Islamic government of Iran which came to power in 1979. Fardid was under the influence of [[Martin Heidegger]], the influential [[Germany|German]] philosopher, whom he considered "the only Western philosopher who understood the world and the only philosopher whose insights were congruent with the principles of the Islamic Republic. These two figures, [[Khomeini]] and Heidegger, helped Fardid argue his position."&lt;ref&gt;Farhang Rajaee, ''Islamism and Modernism: The Changing Discourse in Iran'', University of Texas Press (2010), p. 183&lt;/ref&gt; What he decried was the [[anthropocentrism]] and [[rationalism]] brought by [[classical Greece]], replacing the authority of God and faith with human reason, and in that regard he also criticized Islamic philosophers like [[al Farabi]] and [[Mulla Sadra]] for having absorbed [[Greek philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;Farhang Rajaee, ''Islamism and Modernism: The Changing Discourse in Iran'', University of Texas Press (2010), p. 182&lt;/ref&gt;

Fardid studied philosophy at [[University of Paris|Sorbonne university]] and [[University of Heidelberg]]. The sparsity of Fardid’s written work has led to his recognition as an "oral philosopher". This was, to be sure a puzzling attribute. Although Fardid tried to justify his expository reluctance to the poverty and contamination of the language, (in the [[Heidegger]]ian sense) some suspect his reticence stemmed from his paralyzing perfectionism.

Fardid coined the concept of "Westoxication" which was then popularized by [[Jalal Al-e-Ahmad]] on his then widely known book [[Gharbzadegi]], and after the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, became among the core ideological teachings of the new Islamic government of Iran. Among those influenced by his thought are also included "the theoretician of Islamic cinema", [[Morteza Avini]],&lt;ref&gt;Farhang Rajaee, ''Islamism and Modernism: The Changing Discourse in Iran'', University of Texas Press (2010), p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; and the former conservative president, [[Ahmadinejad]].&lt;ref&gt;Avideh Mayville, "The Religious Ideology of Reform in Iran" in [[J. Harold Ellens]] (ed.), ''Winning Revolutions: The Psychosocial Dynamics of Revolts for Freedom, Fairness, and Rights [3 volumes]'', ABC-CLIO (2013), p. 311&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fardid's turbulent intellect was absorbed in the enterprise of synthesizing (promisingly or otherwise) the results of his studies of Eastern civilizations with the Western philosophy, as interpreted by [[Heidegger]]. Fardid's project remains unfinished and fraught with shortcomings and errors. Nevertheless, it remains an enormously intriguing and valuable endeavor. Heidegger himself on several occasions (including in his encounters with DT Suzuki concerning "transmetaphysical thinking" and in his valedictory interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'') optimistically alluded to the possibility of a convergence of Eastern and Western thought but he never explored the subject matter himself, citing a lack of knowledge and insight about the non-Western [[universe of discourse]]. Ahmad Fardid, from his corner, hoped to produce a blueprint for the endeavor, but he only succeeded in vaguely adumbrating certain contours of it. His influence is evident in the work of many philosophers in modern Iran even if that is left concealed in their biographies and writings due to the criticism that is generally directed at his thinking by intellectuals with liberal and leftist politics.

== Criticisms ==
Ahmad Fardid has been widely denounced by prominent Iranian intellectuals such as [[Abdolkarim Soroush]] and [[Dariush Ashuri]] as a total fraud; and perhaps this is due to their own political commitments rather than being as such on purely philosophical grounds. Mahmoud Sadri, himself a student of Fardid in the seventies, has rejected such virulent ad hominem attacks on Fardid in an article for www.iranian.com.
Fardid rejected [[Human Rights]] declaring it a Western notion, and an instance of [[gharbzadegi|"Westoxication"]]. Fardid often instructed his disciples, many of whom later became among the ruling clique of the Islamic government of Iran, to disregard such "westoxicated" concepts as democracy, civil rights, and tolerance, and instead to return to their "authentic Oriental self". Fardid was also a [[conspiracy theorist]] and an avid [[anti-Semite]].

Abdee Kalantari has described Fardid as "a terrorist with 'philosophical' gloves". Introducing [[Dariush Ashuri]]'s famous exposé documenting Fardid's fraudulent scholarship, and the horrendous consequences of his anti-west, nativist views and teachings, Kalantari wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Those who remember the little clownish figure of Fardid on TV (Beyond the West and the East), with his stern but funny gestures and incomprehensive phrases, would enjoy the debunking of the ‘depth’ of this cartoon figure. But when they reach the final pages, blood is everywhere! They will be touched by an apt comparison and contrast with [[Sadeq Hedayat|Sadegh Hedayat]], whose gentle countenance lies silently next to the cold, pale, sleeping figures of all those murdered writers in morgue; all the victims who saw through the Oriental spirituality and anti-modern postures. Reminiscent of the work of [[Aramesh Doustdar|Aramesh Dustdar]] thirty years ago, here Mr. Ashouri points his finger at, and then stirs some, the swamp. Fardid is dead but little Fardids are all around us. And not just of religious stripe. They come in all varieties: secular, left, right, liberal …When will this cycle end?
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], there is no trace of the human… It is all about liberty, equality, and fraternity of the ego ([[Nafs|nafsi ammarah]]) and the satanic self.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad Fardid, ''Didar e Farahi va Fotuhate Aakhare Zamaan ''[The Divine Encounter and Apocalystic Revelations,” 2nd edition, Tehran: Moassesseye Farhangi va Pajoheshi Chap va Nashr Vaza, 2008, pp. 76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In accordance with [[Heidegger]], I put forward a historical position [mowghef]. Mankind is in a historical age when God is absent, the true God... Now, human is the Truth which is apparent, that, human is god, and the Greek [[taghut]] [idolatry] embodies the human. This is the humanism that I previously mentioned: humanism and human [[taghut]] [idolatry].&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mirsepassi, ''Transnationalism in Iranian Political Thought: The Life and Times of Ahmad Fardid'', Cambridge University Press (2017), p. 242&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mysticism's one eye has been blinded by [[Sufi metaphysics|wahdat al-vojud]] ("the Unity of Being'), and the other one has been blinded by [[Bergson]]. According to Bergson, there is turbulence in the world. Where is presence ? Where is God ? I hope the human dies of the unrest. This intrinsic (natural) wisdom [esnokherad], which is like darkness, appears like lightness for Bergson. Bergson's gnosis one of the examples of [[Westoxification]]. In fact, there is no [[gnosis]] in the West. During the last four hundred years, philosophy in the West has focused on the actually existing reality (mowjud). In fact, you can not find any question about "existence" [vojud] in the nineteenth century, and all discussion were centered on mowjud.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Mirsepassi, ''Transnationalism in Iranian Political Thought: The Life and Times of Ahmad Fardid'', Cambridge University Press (2017), p. 249&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6027">'''Apperception''' (from the [[Latin]] ''ad-'', "to, toward" and ''percipere'', "to perceive, gain, secure, learn, or feel") is any of several aspects of perception and consciousness in such fields as [[psychology]], [[philosophy]] and [[epistemology]].

==Meaning in philosophy==
The term originates with [[René Descartes]] in the form of the word ''apercevoir'' in his book ''Traité des passions''. [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] introduced the concept of apperception into the more technical philosophical tradition, in his work ''Principes de la nature fondés en raison et de la grâce''; although he used the word practically in the sense of the modern [[attention]], by which an object is apprehended as "not-self" and yet in relation to the self.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Apperception |volume=2 |page=221}} This cites:
*Karl Lange, ''Ueber Apperception'' (6th ed. revised, Leipzig, 1899; trans. E. E. Brown, Boston, 1893)
*[[George Stout|G. F. Stout]], ''Analytic Psychology'' (London, 1896), bk. ii. ch. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] distinguished [[transcendental apperception]] from empirical apperception.  The first is the perception of an object as involving the consciousness of the pure self as subject--"the pure, original, unchangeable consciousness that is the necessary condition of experience and the ultimate foundation of the unity of experience."  The second is "the consciousness of the concrete actual self with its changing states", the so-called "inner sense." (Otto F. Kraushaar in ''Runes''&lt;ref name="Dagobert D 1972"&gt;[[Dagobert D. Runes|Runes, Dagobert D.]] (ed.), ''Dictionary of Philosophy'', Littlefield, Adams, and Company, Totowa, NJ, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;).  Transcendental apperception is almost equivalent to self-consciousness; the existence of the ego may be more or less prominent, but it is always involved.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;  See ''[[Kantianism]]''.

===Meaning in the writings of Theodor Lipps===
The German philosopher [[Theodor Lipps]] distinguished the terms perception and apperception in his 1902 work, ''Vom Fühlen, Wollen und Denken''.&lt;ref&gt;Lipps, Theodor. ''Vom Fuehlen, Wollen und Denken.'' Leipzig, Verlag von Johann Ambrosius Barth, 1902. See pages 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Perception, for Lipps, is a generic term that covers such psychic occurrences as auditory and tactile sensations, recollections, visual representations in memory, etc. But these perceptions do not always hold our conscious attention - perception is not always consciously noticed. Lipps uses the term apperception, then, to refer to attentive perception, wherein, in addition to merely perceiving an object, either one also consciously attends to the perceived object or one also attends to the very perception of the object.&lt;ref&gt;''Judgement and Truth in Early Analytic Philosophy and Phenomenology''. ed. Mark Textor. Springer, 2013. pp. 14f.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Meaning in psychology==
In [[psychology]], apperception is "the process by which new experience is assimilated to and transformed by the residuum of past experience of an individual to form a new whole."&lt;ref name="Dagobert D 1972"/&gt; In short, it is to perceive new experience in relation to past experience. The term is found in the early psychologies of [[Herbert Spencer]], [[Hermann Lotze]], and [[Wilhelm Wundt]]. It originally means passing the threshold into consciousness, i.e., to perceive. But the percept is changed when reaching consciousness due to the contextual presence of the other stuff already there, thus it is not perceived but apperceived.

According to [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] apperception is that process by which an aggregate or "mass" of presentations becomes systematized (''apperceptions-system'') by the accretion of new elements, either sense-given or product of the inner workings of the mind.  He thus emphasizes in apperception the connection with the self as resulting from the sum of antecedent experience.  Hence in education the teacher should fully acquaint himself with the mental development of the pupil, in order that he may make full use of what the pupil already knows.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Apperception is thus a general term for all mental processes in which a presentation is brought into connection with an already existent and systematized mental conception, and thereby is classified, explained or, in a word, understood; e.g. a new scientific phenomenon is explained in the light of phenomena already analysed and classified. The whole intelligent life of man is, consciously or unconsciously, a process of apperception, in as much as every act of attention involves the appercipient process.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

===Example===
A rich child and a poor child walking together come across the same ten dollar bill on the sidewalk. The rich child says it is not very much money and the poor child says it is a lot of money. The difference lies in how they ''apperceive'' the same event – the lens of past experience through which they see and value (or devalue) the money.|Christopher Ott&lt;ref&gt;Ott, Christopher, ''The Evolution of Perception and the Cosmology of Substance'', iUniverse, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Meaning in epistemology==
In [[epistemology]], apperception is "the introspective or reflective apprehension by the mind of its own inner states".&lt;ref name="Dagobert D 1972"/&gt;

A '''boyfriend''' is a male [[Friendship|friend]] or [[Interpersonal relationship|acquaintance]], often specifying a regular male companion with whom one is [[Platonic love|platonic]], [[Romance (love)|romantically]] or [[Sexual relationship|sexually involved]].&lt;ref&gt;Compact Oxford English Dictionary of Current English , published 23 June 2005, University of Oxford, {{ISBN|978-0-19-861022-9}} edition&lt;/ref&gt; This is normally a short-term committed relationship, where other titles (e.g., ''husband, partner'') are more commonly used for long-term committed relationships. A boyfriend can also be called an admirer, beau, suitor and sweetheart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thesaurus.com|title=Boyfriend|url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/boyfriend?s=t|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The analogous female term is "[[girlfriend]]".

==Scope==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P0310-0025, Berlin, Straßenszene.jpg|thumb|A woman with her boyfriend at [[Alexanderplatz]] in March 1975.]]
[[File:Gay Couple Savv and Pueppi 02.jpg|thumb|A man with his boyfriend.]]
Partners in committed non-marital relationships are also sometimes described as a ''[[significant other]]'' or ''partner'', 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thesaurus.com|title=Significant other|url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/significant+other?s=t|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially if the individuals are cohabiting.

''Boyfriend'' and ''partner'' mean different things to different people; the distinctions between the terms are subjective. How the term is used will ultimately be determined by personal preference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Goldstein|first=Meredith|title=Partner? Boyfriernd? Maybe?|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/relationships/blog/2009/06/partner_boyfriend_mate.html|accessdate=6 May 2012|work=The Boston Globe|date=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study of 115 people ages 21 to 35 who were either living with or had lived with a romantic partner notes that the lack of proper terms often leads to awkward situations, such as someone upset over not being introduced in social situations to avoid the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jayson|first=Sharon|title=Adults stumble over what to call their romantic partners|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/lifestyle/2008-06-22-adult-dating-descriptor_N.htm|accessdate=6 May 2012|work=USA Today|date=23 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a significant difference between ''[[girlfriend]]'' and ''boyfriend'', and ''girl friend'' and ''boy friend''. In a strictly grammatical sense, a ''girlfriend''&lt;ref name="girlfriend"/&gt; or ''boyfriend''&lt;ref name="boyfriend"/&gt; is an 'individual of significance' with whom one shares a relationship.

==Word history==
The word ''dating'' entered the American language during the [[Roaring Twenties]]. Prior to that, courtship was a matter of family and community interest. Starting around the time of the [[American Civil War]], courtship became a private matter for couples.&lt;ref name="Hirsch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hirsch|first=Elaine|title=The History of Dating and Communication|url=http://www.communicationstudies.com/the-history-of-dating-and-communication|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early to mid 20th century in the US, women were often visited by "gentleman callers", single men who would arrive at the home of a young woman with the hopes of beginning a [[courtship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunt|first=Lana J.|title=Ladies and Gentleman|url=http://www.angelfire.com/ar3/townevictorian/ladiesgentlemen.html|accessdate=6 May 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120728021740/http://www.angelfire.com/ar3/townevictorian/ladiesgentlemen.html|archivedate=28 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The era of the gentleman caller ended in the early 20th century and the modern idea of dating developed.&lt;ref name="Hirsch"/&gt;

In literature, the term is discussed in July 1988 in [[Neil Bartlett (playwright)|Neil Bartlett]]'s, ''Who Was That Man? A Present for Mr Oscar Wilde.'' On pages 108-110, Bartlett quotes from an issue of ''[[The Artist and Journal of Home Culture]]'', which refers to [[Alectryon (mythology)|Alectryon]] as "a boyfriend of [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]]".

==Synonyms==
*An older man may be referred to as a sugar daddy, a well-to-do man who financially supports or lavishly spends on a mistress, girlfriend, or boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Merriam-Webster|title=Sugar daddy|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sugar%20daddy|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In popular culture, slang, internet chat, and cellphone texting, the truncated [[acronym]] ''bf'' is also used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acronymfinder.com/af-query.asp?Acronym=bf&amp;Find=find&amp;string=exact BF - Definition by AcronymFinder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Leman, an archaic word for "sweetheart, paramour," from Medieval British ''leofman'' (c.1205), from Old English ''leof'' (cognate of Dutch ''lief'', German ''lieb'') "dear" + ''man'' "human being, person" was originally applied to either gender, but usually means mistress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|title=Leman|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Leman|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="71092">The '''Church Educational System (CES) Honor Code''' is a set of standards by which students and faculty attending a school owned and operated by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) are required to live. The most widely known university that is part of the [[Church Educational System]] (CES) that has adopted the honor code is [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), located in [[Provo, Utah]]. The standards are largely derived from codes of conduct of the LDS Church, and were not put into written form until the 1940s. Since then, they have undergone several changes. The CES Honor Code also applies for students attending BYU's sister schools [[Brigham Young University&amp;ndash;Idaho]], [[Brigham Young University&amp;ndash;Hawaii]], and [[LDS Business College]].

Maeser]]. Maeser created the "Domestic Organization", which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes to see that they were following the school's moral rules. In the 1901 school catalog this guide of conduct included a prohibition on "strong drink and tobacco", "profanity and obscenity", attending parties not under the control of "responsible persons", "keeping late hours, having improper associates, and visiting places of questionable repute".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1901-1902 Catalogue (sic)|date=1901|publisher=Brigham Young Academy|location=Provo, Utah|pages=10–11|url=https://archive.org/stream/cataloguesannoun19011902brig#page/10/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maeser also, however, relied largely on individual student's [[honor]] and honesty in keeping the rules, intending faculty visits as times of counsel rather than espionage. After [[George H. Brimhall]] served as president, enforcement became somewhat more lax (there were no more faculty visits), but adherence to the same basic principles were encouraged. From 1910 to 1960 the annual student catalog would only contain a few brief sentences on student conduct and discipline, often mentioning the prohibition of tobacco, "improper associates", and "visiting places of questionable repute",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1960-1961 Annual Catalog|date=Fall 1960|publisher=BYU|location=Provo, Utah|url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogofcourses19601961brig#page/80/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; though the 1930s and 40s saw increased standards regarding rules related to student housing and the dress code. Women were allowed to wear slacks only on Saturdays, and men wore uniforms for a short time.&lt;ref name=BYUhouse3&gt;{{cite book |last1= Bergera |first1= Gary James |last2= Priddis |first2= Ronald |year= 1985 |chapter= Chapter 3: Standards &amp; the Honor Code |chapter-url= http://signaturebookslibrary.org/?p=13895 |title= Brigham Young University: A House of Faith |place= Salt Lake City |publisher= [[Signature Books]] |isbn= 0-941214-34-6 |oclc= 12963965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 students drafted the first Honor Code enforced by an Honor Council of students and administrators, and was used mainly for cases of cheating and [[academic dishonesty]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Piper|first1=Matthew|title=The history of BYU’s Honor Code: From ‘an institution practically without rules’ to one that exterminates ‘beetles, beatniks or buzzards,’ and beyond|journal=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=29 Oct 2016|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/3854493-155/the-history-of-byus-honor-code|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Student Honor Council, created around 1949, oversaw case violations. This council met with enough success among students in alleviating cheating that in 1957 BYU president [[Ernest L. Wilkinson]] suggested the Honor Code expand to include other school standards. This led to an expansion during the 1960s which created the bulk of what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs, and alcohol.&lt;ref name=BYUhouse3 /&gt; Instead of a short paragraph on university standards,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Catalog Issue 1966-1968|date=Fall 1966|publisher=BYU|location=Provo, Utah|page=41|url=https://archive.org/stream/catalogofcourses19661968brig#page/41/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; the undergraduate catalog began printing a more detailed set of Honor Code policies in 1968, including a clause requiring students to act when observing any violation and a list of banned drugs ("amphetamines, barbiturates, hallucinogenic drugs, psychedelic drugs, and narcotics").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=L.

In the 1960s, several rules regarding longer hairstyles in men were introduced after long hair on men became associated with the radical movements then springing up on college campuses around the country. However, long hair and beards were not completely against the rules until the mid-1970s&lt;ref name="A history of the BYU Honor Code"/&gt; with the 1978 annual catalog being the first edition to contain any detailed dress and grooming standards code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1978-1979 General Catalog of Courses|date=January 1978|publisher=BYU|location=Provo, Utah|url=https://archive.org/stream/generalcatalog19781979brig#page/6/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The 1960s also saw changes in rules regarding women's dress, as LDS Church leaders made statements against low-cut dresses and short skirts. By this time, women were allowed to wear slacks and pant-suits, but jeans were not allowed until 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Randle|first1=Jenna|title=70s BYU student undressed to take a test|url=http://universe.byu.edu/2014/11/04/26-years-later-the-story-of-anita-welch1/|agency=Daily Universe|publisher=BYU|date=4 Nov 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==
The CES Honor Code governs not only academic behavior but also everyday conduct on or off campus as well as dress and grooming standards of students and faculty, with the aim of providing an atmosphere consistent with LDS principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://registrar.byu.edu/catalog/2014-2015ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php |title=Church Educational System Honor Code |work=2014-2015 Undergraduate Catalog |publisher=Brigham Young University |access-date=2015-07-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125225815/http://registrar.byu.edu/catalog/2014-2015ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php |archive-date=2014-11-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Honor Code requires:

==Policies on homosexuality==
{{seealso|Brigham Young University LGBT history|Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}

===Ban on gay students===
Before the 1960s there was little explicit mention of homosexuality by BYU administration, but by 1962 a ban on homosexual students was enacted. On 12 September 1962 Apostles [[Spencer W. Kimball]] and [[Mark E. Peterson]] and BYU President [[Ernest L. Wilkinson]] agreed on a university policy that "no one will be admitted as a student ... whom we have convincing evidence is a homosexual". They agreed to share information about individuals cases of homosexual members between general church administration and BYU administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Seth|title=Timeline of Mormon Thinking About Homosexuality|url=http://www.nomorestrangers.org/timeline-of-mormon-thinking-about-homosexuality/|website=NoMoreStrangers.org|publisher=No More Strangers: LGBT Mormon Forum|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Ernest L.|title=BYU Diary|date=12 September 1962|publisher=Brigham Young University|location=BYU Library Special Collections UA 1000 Box 101 Folder 1|url=http://files.lib.byu.edu/ead/XML/UA1000.xml|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy was reiterated in Wilkinson's address to BYU in 1965 when he stated "we [do not] intend to admit to this campus any homosexuals. ... [I]f any of you have this tendency, ... may I suggest you leave the University immediately .... We do not want others on this campus to be contaminated by your presence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Ernest|title=Make Honor Your Standard|date=23 Sep 1965|publisher=Brigham Young University|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Ernest|title=Make Honor Your Standard|journal=Deseret News: Church News|date=13 Nov 1965|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1967 version of the Honor code stated that "homosexuality will not be tolerated" along with not approving "any form of artificial birth control".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkinon|first1=Ernest L.|title=Presidential Files, Memorandum: Conference Held with First Presidency|date=18 August 1967|publisher=BYU|location=Provo, UT, BYU HBLL Special Collections UA 1000 Box 271 Folder 22|page=2|url=http://files.lib.byu.edu/ead/XML/UA1000.xml|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ban on any homosexually oriented students was softened a decade later by Wilkinson's successor [[Dallin H. Oaks]] in a 19 April 1973 Board of Trustees meeting. There it was decided BYU would allow students who had "repented of" homosexual acts and "forsaken" them for a "lengthy period of time". Additionally they would allow students "guilty of irregular sexual behavior" (not including fornication or adultery equivalents) who were "repentant" and "showed evidence" that the act(s) would "not be repeated" while still banning overt and active homosexuals.&lt;ref name="BYU Board Meeting Minutes"&gt;{{cite book|title=BYU Board Meeting Minutes|date=19 April 1973|publisher=BYU|location=BYU Library Special Collections|pages=6–7|url=http://files.lib.byu.edu/ead/XML/UA1085.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Donovan|first1=Connell|title=Private Pain, Public Purges: A History of Homosexuality at Brigham Young University|url=http://exmormon.org/d6/drupal/byuhis|accessdate=16 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shock therapy===
According to the Standards Office director from 1971 to 1981, all homosexual BYU students who were reported to the Standards Office (now called the Honor Code Office) were either expelled, or, for "less serious" offenses, were required to undergo therapy in order to remain at the university; in "special cases" this treatment included "electroshock and vomiting aversion therapies".&lt;ref name="BYU Board Meeting Minutes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Signature Books"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corcoran|first1=Brent|last2=O'Donovan|first2=Rocky|title=Multiply and Replenish: Mormon Essays on Sex and Family|date=1994|publisher=Signature Books|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|isbn=1560850507|page=155|url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/the-abominable-and-detestable-crime-against-nature/|accessdate=29 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[Homosexuality and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Aversion therapy at BYU|program]] of aversion therapy—which spanned from the late 1950s until at least the late 1970s—was dedicated to "curing" male homosexual students reported by bishops and BYU administrators through administering electrical shocks or vomit inducing drugs while showing "nude" pictures of men to the patient in an attempt to associate pain with homosexual visual stimulation.&lt;ref name=mormon-gay-cures&gt;{{citation |url= http://abcnews.go.com/Health/mormon-gay-cures-reparative-therapies-shock-today/story?id=13240700&amp;singlePage=true |title= Mormon 'Gay Cure' Study Used Electric Shocks Against Homosexual Feelings |work= [[Good Morning America]] |publisher= [[ABC News]] |first= Susan Donaldson |last= James |date= March 30, 2011 |accessdate= July 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Quinn|first1=D.

===Ban on advocacy and coming out===
[[File:Gay_BYU_Logo_Parody.png|175px|thumb|right|A gay pride parody of the "Y" logo]]
In the late 1990s a reference to homosexual conduct was added to the code, and in 2001 Associate Dean of Students Lane Fischer over the BYU Honor Code Office stated that it was inappropriate for a BYU student to advocate for the [homosexual] lifestyle by publishing material or participating in public demonstrations as well as advertising ones same-sex preference in any public way. He also required homosexual students facing discipline to refrain from same-sex "dating, holding hands, kissing, romantic touching, showering, clubbing, ets., as well as regular association with homosexual men."&lt;ref name="BYU Brass Suspend Two Gays"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stewart|first1=Kirsten|title=BYU Brass Suspend Two Gays|agency=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=29 March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current policies===
In 2007, BYU changed the honor code to read that stating one's sexual orientation was not an honor code issue while removing the phrase that "any behaviors that indicate homosexual conduct, including those not sexual in nature, are inappropriate and violate the Honor Code." The change also clarified the policy on advocacy of LGBTQ rights or romantic relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lyon|first1=Julia|title=BYU changes honor code text about gay students|url=http://archive.sltrib.com/story.php?ref=/news/ci_5684555|accessdate=15 January 2017|agency=Salt Lake Tribune|date=17 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walch|first1=Tad|title=BYU clarifies Honor Code about gay orientation|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/660212820/-BYU-clarifies-Honor-Code-about-gay-orientation.html|accessdate=15 January 2017|agency=Deseret News|publisher=LDS Church|date=18 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several students, including gay and lesbian students, thought that the previous wording was confusing and unclear.

There is no similar restriction against expressing heterosexual feelings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2009-2010ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php|title=Church Educational System Honor Code|work=2009-2010 Undergraduate Catalog|publisher=BYU|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903210257/http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2009-2010ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php|archivedate=2011-09-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first explicit mention of homosexuality in the language of the school's code of conduct available to students was not noted until the Fall of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2008 Church Educational System Honor Code |url=http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2008-2009ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php |website=byu.edu |publisher=BYU |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140608222002/http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2008-2009ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php |archivedate=2014-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Church Educational System Honor Code |url=http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2009-2010ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php |website=byu.edu |publisher=BYU |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903210257/http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2009-2010ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php |archivedate=2011-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both this version and the 2010 versions contained a clause banning homosexual advocacy defined as "seeking to influence others to engage in homosexual behavior or promoting homosexual relations as being morally acceptable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2009 Church Educational System Honor Code |url=http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2009-2010ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php |website=byu.edu |publisher=BYU |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903210257/http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2009-2010ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php |archivedate=2011-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Church Educational System Honor Code |url=http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2010-2011ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php |website=byu.edu |publisher=BYU |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828063509/http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2010-2011ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php |archivedate=2010-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2011, BYU quietly removed the clause prohibiting advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://gaysaltlake.com/news/2011/02/02/byu-removes-pro-gay-advocacy-from-its-honor-code/ |title= BYU removes pro-gay advocacy from its honor code |date= February 2, 2011 |newspaper= [[QSaltLake]] |publisher= QSaltLake}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 Church Educational System Honor Code |url=http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2010-2011ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php |website=byu.edu |publisher=BYU |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110414163048/http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2010-2011ucat/GeneralInfo/HonorCode.php |archivedate=2011-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enforcement==
Honor code policies and principles are promoted by [[Brigham Young University Student Service Association|BYUSA]], the campus student association, and the Honor Code Office. The office handles all accusations and violations, and works in conjunction with [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishops]] of BYU [[Ward (LDS Church)|wards]]. If the student's bishop is thought to be able to corroborate the alleged infraction, the accused student may be required to sign a legal form waiving his or her rights to ecclesiastical privacy, which allows the school direct access to the bishop and any content discussed on the said topic, or others which may have been in violation of the Honor Code, but not yet reported. Not all students at the school are familiar with LDS standards, so students who break the code for the first time are usually only contacted by mail as a warning and clarification of standards. Later violations may cause the student to be called into the office to speak with an Honor Code officer. Severe and continued violations can merit expulsion.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://universe.byu.edu/2007/01/18/honor-code-exists-to-uphold-gospel-principles-create-environment/ |title= Honor Code Exists to Uphold Gospel Principles, Create Environment |first= Nicole |last= Miller |date= January 18, 2007 |newspaper= The Universe |publisher= BYU }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students may be brought to the attention of the Honor Code office by faculty, staff, or other students&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://universe.byu.edu/2006/05/26/universities-use-social-networks-to-find-misbehaving-students/ |title= Universities use social networks to find misbehaving students |first= Elizabeth |last= Stuart |date= May 26, 2006 |newspaper= The Universe |publisher= BYU }}&lt;/ref&gt; but "no anonymous reports will be acted upon".&lt;ref name="Honor Code Faculty Information"/&gt; BYU Events Staff patrol school dances for Honor Code violations.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://universe.byu.edu/2006/01/17/byu-dances-keeping-it-clean/ |title= BYU Dances Keeping it Clean |first= Rosalie |last= Westenskow |date= January 17, 2006 |newspaper= The Universe |publisher= BYU }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cafeteria, library, athletics, and [[BYU Testing Center]] employees are asked to encourage students to follow dress and grooming standards, sometimes denying service to students not adhering to the code.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://universe.byu.edu/2005/09/13/hbll-reviews-honor-code-enforcement/ |title= HBLL reviews Honor Code enforcement |first= Sara Elizabeth |last= Payne |date= September 13, 2005 |newspaper= The Universe |publisher= BYU }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 it was reported that less than 2 or 3 percent of BYU students are referred to the Honor Code Office annually, though no percentage on punitive actions were given.&lt;ref name="BYU Brass Suspend Two Gays"/&gt; Data from 1955, however, showed that 9 students were expelled, 23 were suspended, and 72 were placed on probation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkinson|first1=Ernest|title=Seven Year Report of the President of BYU (1950 to 1957)|date=1957|publisher=BYU|location=BYU L.

===Beard Exemptions===
In regards to facial hair restrictions, permission to wear facial hair can be granted in three specific cases: For men with skin conditions aggravated by shaving, for theatrical performances, and (since a policy change in January 2015) for religious reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Knox|first1=Annie|title=BYU clarifies beard policy; spells out exceptions|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/2057823-155/byu-clarifies-beard-policy-to-allow?fullpage=1|accessdate=17 February 2017|agency=Salt Lake Tribune|date=14 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wpbeard&gt;{{citation | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2015/01/14/brigham-young-university-adjusts-anti-beard-policies-amid-student-protests/ |title= Brigham Young University adjusts anti-beard policies amid student protests |first= Abby |last=Phillip |date= January 14, 2015 |newspaper= The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to medical exemptions, students/faculty must visit a BYU Student Health Center doctor who will fax a recommendation to the Honor Code office. The student/faculty must then visit the office to fill out the requisite exemption paperwork. A new BYU ID card is issued including a symbol marked "BE" and a photograph with the facial hair. In regards to theater exemptions, students or faculty must obtain written permission from the theater or film company explaining the need for facial hair. Such exemptions are only granted for the duration of the production. Thus, in such cases a temporary exemption card issued. Religious exemptions will be coordinated through the university chaplain's office.&lt;ref name=wpbeard /&gt;

===Ecclesiastical endorsement===
Students are required to sign in agreement to the Honor Code, Dress and Grooming Standards, Residential Living Guidelines, and Academic Honesty Policy yearly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ecclesiastical Endorsement Instructions for Students Attending BYU Provo |url=https://it.byu.edu/byu/sc_help.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge%2Cdf579dc52b967c047ed590a069da1557 |website=byu.edu |publisher=BYU |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106175606/https://it.byu.edu/byu/sc_help.do?sysparm_document_key=kb_knowledge%2Cdf579dc52b967c047ed590a069da1557 |archivedate=2015-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally they must have a yearly&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BYU OneStop|url=https://onestop.byu.edu/complete-ecclesiastical-endorsement|website=byu.edu|publisher=BYU}}&lt;/ref&gt; interview with a leader of their local religious congregation, or (for religious students or those without a local congregation) the non-denominational BYU chaplain and maintain this ecclesiastical endorsement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Church Educational System|url=https://home.byu.edu/webapp/endorsements/|website=byu.edu|publisher=BYU}}&lt;/ref&gt; to attend BYU.

===Housing accommodation===
Students have the option of living in on-campus housing, with family members who reside in the local area, or in off-campus housing which must pass a school inspection for health and safety, as well as satisfactory separation of gender quarters and compliance with other standards. Students under certain conditions can apply for a housing waiver for special approval.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://och.byu.edu/contracted.html|title=BYU Contracted Housing|work=BYU Off Campus Housing|publisher=BYU}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2009-2010ucat/GeneralInfo/Housing.php|title=Off-Campus Housing|work=2009-2010 Undergraduate Catalog|publisher=BYU|access-date=2010-04-10|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120713061249/http://saas.byu.edu/catalog/2009-2010ucat/GeneralInfo/Housing.php|archive-date=2012-07-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Single parents with children.
*Single students living with parents.
*Single students who are taking classes away from Provo.
*Graduate students.
*Under certain conditions, as determined by the Off-Campus Housing Office, the university housing requirement may be waived for other students who have a special circumstance or hardship.
This approval is designed to ensure that students live in a safe environment that is consistent with the standards of the University. Since students are only allowed to live in BYU-approved housing, landlords in the area consider it important to meet the standard in order to gain residents. The housing standards mandate that bathrooms and bedrooms be off limits to those of the opposite sex. Members of the opposite sex are required to be out of the apartment by midnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://universe.byu.edu/2006/06/12/honor-code-influence-helps-and-hampers-student-housing/ |title= Honor code influence helps and hampers student housing |first= Rebecca |last= Shippen |date= June 12, 2006 |journal= The Universe |publisher= BYU }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guns are permitted in off-campus housing only if the gun owner receives written permission from both the landlord and all residents in the apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://universe.byu.edu/2005/06/02/byu-housing-office-prohibits-firearms-in-apartments/ |title= BYU housing office prohibits firearms in apartments |first= Leaa |last= Forschler |date= June 2, 2005 |newspaper= The Universe |publisher= BYU }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, BYU announced that beginning in 2007, housing would only be approved if it was within {{convert|2|mi}} of campus. The school did this out of concern that its Office of Residence Life was being stretched too thin and was unable to meet demands. Students feared the new boundaries might lead to a rise in apartment prices and decrease the amount of available housing. According to BYU, the effect would be minimal, as 98 percent of students already lived within the designated area. About 40 properties lost BYU approval due to the new guideline.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://universe.byu.edu/2006/06/12/students-resistant-to-and-confused-by-new-housing-boundaries/ |title=Students resistant to and confused by new housing boundaries |first=Lesley |last=Larson |date=June 12, 2006 |newspaper=The Daily Universe |publisher=BYU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
There has been several controversies surrounding BYU's honor code, with criticism from students, advocacy groups, local governmental institutions, and national press coverage.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

===YouTube Blocking===
As part of a BYU ban on websites containing sexual content, the popular website YouTube was blocked on all BYU networks. In 2007 [[Fox News]] highlighted BYU's blocking of pornographic and other sites, including [[YouTube]], from campus Internet connections,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/2007/02/17/brigham-young-university-bans-youtube-access-for-students/ |title= Brigham Young University Bans YouTube Access for Students |date= 2007-02-17 |publisher= Fox News |agency= [[Associated Press|AP]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; pursuant to the code's prohibition of the viewing of pornographic material. BYU lifted the YouTube ban in 2009, again receiving nationwide press attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/06/27/brigham-young-university-_n_221908.html |title= Brigham Young University Lifts YouTube Ban |date= 27 June 2009 |work= Huffington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious and academic freedom===

BYU students led a campaign to loosen the [[Beard#LDS Church|beard restrictions]] in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Whitney |last= Evans |date= September 27, 2014 |title= Students rally for beard 'revolution' in Provo |url= http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865611874/Students-rally-for-beard-revolution-in-Provo.html?pg=all |newspaper= [[Deseret News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Annie |last= Knox |date= September 26, 2014 |title= BYU student asks school to chop beard ban |url= http://www.sltrib.com/58458452-219/university-beards-beard-campus.html |newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |access-date= November 2, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141125224803/http://www.sltrib.com/58458452-219/university-beards-beard-campus.html |archive-date= November 25, 2014 |dead-url= yes |df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Whitney |last= Evans |date= September 27, 2014 |title= Students protest BYU beard restriction |url= http://www.ksl.com/?nid=148&amp;sid=31728643 |publisher= [[KSL-TV|KSL 5 News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Annie |last= Cutler |date= September 26, 2014 |title= 'Bike for Beards' event part of BYU students' fight for facial hair freedom |url= http://fox13now.com/2014/09/26/bike-for-beards-event-part-of-byu-students-fight-for-facial-hair-freedom/ |publisher= [[KSTU|Fox 13 News (KSTU)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it had the opposite effect at Church Educational System schools: some students who had previously been granted beard exceptions were found no longer to qualify, and for a brief period the [[LDS Business College]] required students with a registered exception to wear a "beard badge", which was likened to a "[[badge of shame]]". Some students also join in with [[shame|shaming]] their fellow beard-wearing students, even those with registered exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Annie |last= Knox |date= November 24, 2014 |title= Beard ban at Mormon schools getting stricter, students say |url= http://www.sltrib.com/1867918-155/beard-ban-at-mormon-schools-getting |newspaper= [[The Salt Lake Tribune]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Cram school]]s in Hong Kong''' (also commonly known as "tutorial schools") are commercial organisations that cater principally to students preparing for public examinations at secondary school level, namely the[[Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education| Diploma of Secondary Education]] (HKDSE), and its precursors prior to 2012, [[Hong Kong Advanced Level Examination|Advanced Level]] and [[Hong Kong Certificate of Education Examination|Certificate of Education]] (HKCEE) examinations.&lt;ref name="scmp1893444" /&gt;

==Business model==
[[File:KGE billboard.jpg|thumb|500px|"Star teachers" featured on a prominent billboard on [[Nathan Road]]]]
Cram schools are relied upon by some primary school students and many secondary school students to endow them with techniques for public examinations in Hong Kong that determine students' acceptance to local universities.&lt;ref name=scmp20090716/&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp1893440/&gt; According to the Census and Statistics Department of Hong Kong, a third of secondary school students went for private tutoring in the 2004–05 school year, spending a total of [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]]18.9&amp;nbsp;million per month (2.42 million).&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;  [https://www.usatoday.com/news/offbeat/2007-01-22-tutors_x.htm "Hong Kong tutors selling sex appeal"], [[Associated Press]], 20 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On the lower estimate, the whole industry is worth more than HK$400&amp;nbsp;million,&lt;ref name="Jiujik"&gt;[http://www.jiujik.com/jsarticle.php?lcid=HK.B5&amp;artid=3000015690&amp;arttype=MGT&amp;artsection=CAREER 年薪千萬元的補習天王] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927215910/http://www.jiujik.com/jsarticle.php?lcid=HK.B5&amp;artid=3000015690&amp;arttype=MGT&amp;artsection=CAREER |date=27 September 2007 }}, ''Jiujik'', 10 November 2006 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to other reports, the industry is generating more than US$3.6&amp;nbsp;billion a year.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/business/global/01iht-cramside.html |title=In Hong Kong, Cram School Teachers' Image Rivals Pop Stars' |first=Yuk-hang |last=Ng |work=The New York Times |date= 1 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst these, [[Modern Education]] and Beacon College are the only listed operations.&lt;ref name=scmp1893444/&gt;

These establishments cater to the 478&amp;nbsp;thousand secondary school students in Hong Kong (2008 figures).&lt;ref name=wealth/&gt; The schools focus on the two major local public examinations, namely HKDSE and HKALE. Cram schools focus on teaching examination techniques as well as providing students tips on topics which may appear on the coming examination.&lt;ref name=hk-magazine17682/&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp20090716/&gt; Monthly tuition fees per subject in 2009 were approximately HK$400 (US$51) for each student.&lt;ref name=scmp20090716/&gt; The fee for a course, such as English, can be HK$100 per hour.&lt;ref name=wealth&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=36&amp;art_id=90181&amp;sid=25984870&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20091106&amp;sear_year=2009 |title=Wealth of knowledge |first=Nickkita |last=Lau |work=The Standard |date= 6 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, fees were stable at around HK$500, due to tough competition amongst tuition centres and falling school rolls due to demographic factors.&lt;ref name=scmp1893444/&gt; The use of video tutorials, pioneered by Kevin Ko, has become a permanent feature in the industry in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=hks20091016/&gt; Multimedia technology has permitted the leveraging of classes simultaneously to hundreds of students at two or more different locations.&lt;ref name=scmp1893444/&gt;

The Hong Kong Federation of Youth Groups surveyed 524 year five to year twelve pupils in 2012, 63 per cent of respondents said they were being tutored; approximately 56 per cent of those spent at least HK$1,000 a month on tuition fees.&lt;ref name=scmp1893440&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/1893440/hong-kongs-poor-children-lose-out-cramming-system|title=Rise of exam-cramming system will widen Hong Kong’s social divide, educators warn|date=19 December 2015|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of tutoring has been fuelled by aggressive social pressures and competition for university places for subjects such as medicine and law.&lt;ref name=scmp1893440/&gt;

=== Tutor profiles ===
Tutors are independent contractors to cram schools, who share their revenue with tutors. Tutors on the other hand bear their own overheads, such as advertising and promotion expenses; many hire assistants to research course materials and to answer students' queries.&lt;ref name=scmp1893444/&gt; The share of gross revenues paid to tutors may depend on their bargaining power (popularity), and whether classes are live or virtual. Media reported that the more successful amongst these are able to obtain a 60% share. Some liken themselves to stage performers, so cultivate their images and daily rehearse new content or delivery.&lt;ref name=scmp1893444/&gt; There are said to be approximately 20 such 'star tutors' in number within the industry in 2007, who made monthly gross revenues of HK$1&amp;nbsp;million or above.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sing Pao"/&gt; Public disclosures made during the 2014/15 fiscal year by two leading cram schools indicated that Modern Education paid fees ranging from about HK$2 million to around HK$15 million to five tutors; Beacon College paid its top tutor HK$35 million in the same year, and another four tutors averaged approximately HK$4.8 million each.&lt;ref name=scmp1893444/&gt; By comparison, Hong Kong secondary school teachers earnings are capped at $68,915, and a primary school teacher was earning maximum $52,815 in 2009.&lt;ref name=scmp20090716/&gt; Some of the tutors, or "presenters", are model-turned.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sing Pao"&gt;[http://www.singpao.com/20060830/feature/870230.html 變質補習天皇 為錢走火入魔] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125104853/http://singpao.com/20060830/feature/870230.html |date=25 November 2006 }}, ''[[Sing Pao]]'', 30 August 2006 {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The schools apply a fandom approach to promote tutors, who dress fashionably and are given nicknames like "the Godfather of Science," "Brand-A tutor", "Super tutor" or the "Queen of English."&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; They can be seen on billboards, full-page newspaper ads and TV screens in railway stations or on buses.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp716876&gt;http://www.scmp.com/article/716876/controversy-fails-take-shine-star-tutors&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them have their own teams of stylists, fashion designers and photographers; many have personal web sites.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt; Ken Ng, founder of Modern Education, claims credit for initiating this trend, and for "liberat[ing] the very feudal education system" whilst making a lot of money.&lt;ref name=hk-magazine17682&gt;http://hk-magazine.com/article/inside-hk/interviews/17682/ken-ng-king-cram-schools-and-celebrity-tutors&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike individual private tutors who advertise on sites such as adpost, kijiji and craiglist, cram schools regularly spend a lot on millions on front pages of papers, on the MTR and on buses. Multimedia techniques are increasingly deployed. To increase yield, once traditional classes are now supplemented by classes transmitted by video feed.&lt;ref name=scmp20090716&gt;Martin Wong, Yvonne Tsui, 'Star tutors' can net HK$1m a month, page C1, ''South China Morning Post'', 16 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Since around 2004, tutors have produced promotional videos for posting to YouTube.&lt;ref name=scmp1893444/&gt;

In late 2015, media reported that Modern Education was overtly trying to poach a "star tutor" employed by a competitor. The tutor, likely to have been responsible for over 40 percent of the fees generated by rival Beacon College, was reported to have been offered a lucrative package representing an estimated HK$85&amp;nbsp;million (US$10.97&amp;nbsp;million) a year. The package included $30&amp;nbsp;million signing bonus plus 65% of all the revenue he generates throughout his 4-year contract period. Modern Education took out full-page advertising in two local journals to vaunt its offer publicly.&lt;ref name=20151008ejinsight&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejinsight.com/20151008-why-this-hong-kong-tutor-is-worth-22-barack-obamas/|title=Why this Hong Kong tutor is worth 22 Barack Obamas|work=EJ Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=20151009scmp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/1865497/want-earn-cool-hk85-million-hong-kong-tutorial|title=Want to earn a cool HK,5 million?

==Criticism and controversies==
[[Fernando Cheung]] , a member of the Legislative Council panel on education questioned the purpose of the money fuelling Hong Kong’s cram culture. Cheung said: “Our children are pushed into a system where they have to go through exercise after exercise, extracurricular activities, exam preparation and all that. Even when kids take up activities in arts and sports, they’re just there to be competitive and put one more thing on their resumes”.&lt;ref&gt;http://hk-magazine.com/article/inside-hk/hk-stories/17835/failing-grade-hong-kong-students-cant-stop-paying-cram-kings&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption of Hong Kong]] stepped in to investigate allegations that HKCEE examination papers had been bought, and that K. Oten of [[Modern Education]] had sent out an analysis the current year's paper to examination candidates by text message during the exam. His employers immediately distanced themselves, saying he had been terminated.&lt;ref name=probe&gt;Carol Chung and Jeffrey Tam, [http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=65603&amp;sid=18828288&amp;con_type=3&amp;d_str=20080508&amp;sear_year=2008 "Tutor faces exam leak probe"], ''[[The Standard (Hong Kong)|The Standard]]'', 8 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Oten had previously been dismissed by [[King's Glory Education Centre|King's Glory]] in April 2006 on several counts of violating his employment contract.&lt;ref name=scmp20090716/&gt; The court found him in breach, and ordered him to pay HK$8.87&amp;nbsp;million in damages to his former employers.&lt;ref name=scmp20090226&gt;Yvonne Tsui &amp;Loretta Fong, Tutorial school sues star teacher for HK$10m, page C4, ''South China Morning Post'', 26 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

For his satirical dramatisation of the tutoring sector entitled ''[[Trick or Cheat]]'' 《愛出貓》, Hong Kong director [[Oxide Pang]] was sued by one of the sector's biggest stars for libel. Kevin Ko, co-founder of Ever Learning, alleges the film was a libellous portrayal of him. The film's main character, named Seven Ko, uses all manner of unethical means, including bribery and having sex with an exams official to gain access to examination questions.&lt;ref name=hks20091016&gt;{{cite news |url=

In 2002 and again in 2010, Chinese star tutor Siu Yuen became embroiled in controversies when his teaching manuals included essay answers that bore uncanny resemblances to the year end examinations. His teaching materials for written Chinese in 2010 included notes on how to write an essay on a cinema on fire, which turned out to closely resemble a written question the fifth form Chinese public exam the same year. Siu was accused of possessing insider knowledge.&lt;ref name=scmp716876/&gt;

== Notable cram schools in Hong Kong ==
According to the Education Bureau, there are almost 7,500 tutorial centres and branches across Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=scmp1893444&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/education-community/article/1893444/hong-kongs-superstar-teachers-talk-about-their|title=Hong Kong’s rock star tutors: Meet the teachers earning more than the average British Premier League footballer|date=19 December 2015|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ones with larger scale operations include:

{{Discrimination sidebar|expanded=Social}}

'''Elitism''' is the belief or attitude that individuals who form an [[elite]] — a select group of people with a certain [[ancestry]], intrinsic [[quality (philosophy)|quality]], high [[intellect]], [[wealth]], special skills, or experience — are more likely to be constructive to society as a whole, and therefore deserve influence or authority greater than that of others. In the United States, the term ''elitism'' often refers to the concentration of power in the [[Northeast megalopolis|Northeast Corridor]] and on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], where the typical American elite resides – journalists, lawyers, doctors, high-level civil servants, businesspeople, university lecturers, entrepreneurs, and financial advisors in the [[quaternary sector of the economy|quaternary sector]], often in established technological or political catchments of their [[higher education]] [[alma mater]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Alternatively, the term ''elitism'' may be used to describe a situation in which power is concentrated in the hands of a limited number of people. Oppositions of elitism include [[anti-elitism]], [[egalitarianism]], [[populism]] and [[political theory]] of [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralism]].

[[Elite theory]] is the sociological or political science analysis of elite influence in society: elite theorists regard pluralism as a utopian ideal. Elitism is closely related to [[social class]] and what [[sociologist]]s call [[social stratification]], which in the [[Anglo Saxon]] tradition have long been anchored in the "blue blood" claims of hereditary [[nobility]]. Members of the upper classes are sometimes known as the social elite. The term ''elitism'' is also sometimes used to denote situations in which a group of people claiming to possess high abilities or simply an [[in-group]] or [[En cadre|cadre]] grant themselves extra privileges at the expense of others. This form of elitism may be described as ''[[discrimination]]''.

==Characteristics==
Attributes that identify an elite vary; personal achievement may not be essential. Elitist status ''can'' be based on personal achievement, such as degrees from top-rate universities or impressive internships and job offers, it can (in archaic societies) be based on lineage or passed-on fame from parents or grandparents. As a term, "elite" usually describes a person or group of people who are members of the uppermost class of society, and wealth can contribute to that class determination. Personal attributes commonly purported by elitist theorists to be characteristic of the elite include: rigorous study of, or great accomplishment within, a particular field; a long track record of competence in a demanding field; an extensive history of dedication and effort in service to a specific discipline (e.g., medicine or law) or a high degree of accomplishment, training or wisdom within a given field. Elitists tend to favor social systems such as [[meritocracy]], [[technocracy (bureaucratic)|technocracy]] and [[plutocracy]] as opposed to radical [[democracy]], political [[egalitarianism]] and [[populism]]. Elitists also believe only a few "shakers and movers" truly change society rather than society being changed by the majority of people who only vote and elect the elites into power. To elitists, the public is abjectly powerless and can be manipulated only by the top group of elites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Elite (elitist) theory|url=http://www.auburn.edu/~johnspm/gloss/elite_theory|website=auburn.edu|publisher=Auburn University|accessdate=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[synonym]]s for "elite" might be "upper-class" or "[[aristocracy|aristocratic]]", indicating that the individual in question has a relatively large degree of control over a society's [[means of production]]. This includes those who gain this position due to socioeconomic means and not personal achievement. However, these terms are misleading when discussing elitism as a political theory, because they are often associated with negative "class" connotations and fail to appreciate a more unbiased exploration of the philosophy.

===Academic elitism===
{{anchor|Academic}}
{{see also|Ivory tower}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}
Elitism in the context of [[education]] is the practice of concentrating attention on or allocating funding to the best students, or those [[student]]s who rank highest in a particular field of endeavour. For example, a politician who promotes advanced classes for students deemed to be highly intelligent might be accused of elitism, even if this were argued to promote an egalitarian goal, such as curing disease. Elitism in education could be based on conventional assessment of learning ability, knowledge, or other abilities. However, an "elite" school can also mean a school for the wealthy or one that is hard to enter.

==Anti-elitism&lt;!--'Antielitism' and 'Antielitism' redirect here--&gt;==
{{main|Populism|Pluralism (political theory)}}
The term ''elitism'' and the [[pejorative]] title ''elitist'' are sometimes used by people who are not (or, who claim not to be) members of elite organizations. In politics, such terms are often used to disparage a politician's views as out of touch with the interests of the "[[average Joe]]". The implication is that the alleged elitist person or group thinks they are better than everyone else, and put themselves before others as a result. The definition of ''elitist'' is similar to that of the word "[[snob]]".

An elitist is not always seen as truly elite, but only privileged. The definition may have different appreciations depending on the political contexts. Since elitism may be viewed as something necessary for creating patterns of good intellectual or professional performance, it can be used also for maintaining conditions of lack of competition and privilege.

An early proponent of '''anti-elitism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; was [[Georges Sorel]].&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Woodley, ''Fascism and Political Theory: Critical Perspectives on Fascist Ideology'', Routledge, 2010, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egalitarianism===
{{further|Egalitarianism}}
Elitism endorses the exclusion of large numbers of people from positions of privilege or power. Thus, many populists seek the (perceived, if not present in practice) social equality of egalitarianism, [[populism]], [[socialism]], or [[communism]]. They may also support [[affirmative action]], [[social security]], [[luxury tax]]es, and highly [[progressive tax]]es for the wealthiest members of society. All of these measures seek to reduce the difference of power between the elite and the ordinary. However, these measures to reduce difference could be seen as anti-[[meritocracy|meritocratic]] in that they avoid rewarding or promoting those who are the most competitive or provide the most effort in their endeavors.

The terms ''elitism'' and ''meritocracy'' are not equivalent in meaning. Professor Kenneth Paul Tan at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy asserts that "Meritocracy, in trying to 'isolate' merit by treating people with fundamentally unequal backgrounds as superficially the same, can be a practice that ignores and even conceals the real advantages and disadvantages that are unevenly distributed to different segments of an inherently unequal society, a practice that in fact perpetuates this fundamental inequality. In this way, those who are picked by meritocracy as having merit may already have enjoyed unfair advantages from the very beginning, ignored according to the principle of nondiscrimination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tan|first1=Kenneth Paul|title=Meritocracy and Elitism in a Global City: Ideological Shifts in Singapore|journal=International Political Science Review|date=January 2008|volume=29|issue=7–27|pages=7|doi=10.1177/0192512107083445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Daoism]], '''The Five Precepts''' ({{zh|c=五戒|p=Wǔ Jiè|j=Ng&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Gaai&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}) constitute the basic code of [[ethics]] undertaken mainly by lay practitioners. For monks and nuns, there are more advanced and stricter precepts. The Five Precepts are the same as the [[Five Precepts]] of [[Buddhism]]; however, there are minor differences to fit in with Chinese society.

According to ''The Ultra Supreme Elder Lord's Scripture of Precepts'', the five basic precepts are:

* The first precept: No Murdering;
* The second precept: No Stealing;
* The third precept: No Sexual Misconduct;
* The fourth precept: No False Speech;
* The fifth precept: No Taking of Intoxicants.

Their definitions can be found in an excerpt of ''The Ultra Supreme Elder Lord's Scripture of Precepts'':
{{Quote|[[Daode Tianzun|The Elder Lord]] said: "The precept against killing is: All living beings, including all kinds of animals, and those as small as insects, worms, and so forth, are containers of the uncreated energy, thus one should not kill any of them."

The Elder Lord said: "The precept against stealing is: One should not take anything that he does not own and is not given to him, whether it belongs to someone or not."

The Elder Lord said: "The precept against sexual misconduct is: If a sexual conduct happens, but it is not with your married spouse, it is a Sexual Misconduct. As for a monk or nun, he or she should never marry or practice sexual intercourse with anyone."*

The Elder Lord said: "The precept against false speech is: If one did not witness what happened himself but telling something to others, or if one lies with knowing it's a lie, this constitutes False Speech."

The Elder Lord said: "The precept against taking of intoxicants is: One should not take any alcoholic drinks, unless he has to take some to cure his illness, to regale the guests with a feast, or to conduct religious ceremonies."**

The Elder Lord had said: "These five precepts are the fundamentals for keeping one's body in purity, and are the roots of the upholding of the holy teachings. For those virtuous men and virtuous women who enjoy the virtuous teachings, if they can accept and keep these precepts, and never violate any of them till the end of their lifetimes, they are recognized as those with pure faith, they will gain the Way to Tao, will gain the holy principles, and will forever achieve Tao -- the Reality."}}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The precept against sexual misconduct also outlines that sexual acts such as premarital sexual conduct, adultery, prostitution, having intercourse with prostitutes, etc., are all sexual misconduct. (Original commentary: If the married spouses have intercourse too frequently, that is also considered sexual misconduct.)

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;The term for married spouses ({{zh|c=夫婦}}) usually means "husband and wife"; the scripture itself does not explicitly mention [[homosexuality]]. (Original commentary: sexual misconduct is unfaithful sexual relationships [不貞為婬])

'''Francis Bonnici''' (1853–1905) was a Maltese [[educationist]], [[philanthropist]] and a minor [[philosopher]]. In philosophy he mostly specialised in [[pedagogy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. I, pp. 56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Bonnici was born in [[Cospicua]], [[Malta]], on July 14, 1853. However, when still very young, his family moved to [[Mqabba]]. He graduated as Doctor of [[Theology]] from the [[University of Malta]] in 1872 and was ordained priest in 1876. He taught languages for many years at the bishop’s major seminary at [[Mdina]], and was Rector at the bishop’s minor seminary at [[Floriana]]. He was nominated a canon of the bishop’s cathedral chapter in 1882.

Throughout the years, Bonnici endeavoured to create institutions of Christian charity. In 1884 he founded a popular educational itinerary mission for children, and in 1888 he began a shelter for homeless boys at [[Ħamrun]], where it also had a small printing press for educational purposes. Bonnici further founded a congregation of Brothers of Charity to keep up his work at the shelter. Moreover, he also founded a crèche for homeless babies.

Despite his hard and wide pastoral work, Bonnici engaged himself in serious study, both of theology and philosophy. In 1890 he was appointed Professor of the Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of Malta]], an office he held for ten years, up till 1900. During the last two years of his life, he was very ill, having spent all his energies in indefatigable work. He was only fifty-three years of age when he died on December 24, 1905. Though he was buried at the [[St. Paul's Cathedral, Mdina|Mdina cathedral]], his body was later transferred to the Boys’ Shelter in [[Ħamrun]].

==Works==
Bonnici’s philosophical writings do not seem to be many. Nevertheless, one composition stands out from the rest. It is his 1893 pamphlet '''''La Pedagogia e la Filosofia''''' (Pedagogy and Philosophy), printed at his own printing press in [[Ħamrun]] by his homeless boys (Tipografia della Casa di S. Giuseppe).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Montebello|2001|loc=Vol. II, p. 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is in Italian, and is made up of 22 pages. The writing has no divisions or parts. In fact, it is an address which Bonnici delivered at the [[National Library of Malta|Malta National Library]] in [[Valletta]] on October 2, 1893, on the occasion of the opening of the academic year 1893/94 for public schools. Bonnici dedicated the work to his parents and teachers. In it he deals with the relation between the philosophy of education and the theory of education ([[pedagogy]]). Bonnici sustains his views with philosophical arguments and submits to the idea that education is the root to all progress.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s views on women have attracted controversy, beginning during his life and continuing to the present.

==Attitudes in public and in private==
Ida von Miaskowski{{who|date=November 2018}} remarked in her memoir, published 7 years after his death:&lt;blockquote&gt;In the eighties, when Nietzsche's later writings containing some of the oft-quoted sharp words against women appeared, my husband sometimes told me jokingly not to tell people of my friendly relations with Nietzsche, since this was not very flattering for me. It was just a joke. My husband, like myself, always kept friendly memories of Nietzsche [...] his behavior precisely towards women was so sensitive, so natural and comradely, that even today in old age I cannot regard Nietzsche as a despiser of women.&lt;ref&gt;Ida von Miaskowski, cited in S. L. Gilman (Ed.), D. J. Parent (Trans.), ''Conversations with Nietzsche, A Life in the Words of His Contemporaries'',  Oxford University Press, 1987, p52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Remarks in his writings==
Nietzsche wrote specifically about his views on women in Section VII of ''Human, All Too Human'', which seems to hold women in high regard; but given some of his other comments, his overall attitude towards women is ambivalent. For instance, while in ''Human, All Too Human'', he states that "the perfect woman is a higher type of human than the perfect man, and also something much more rare," there are a number of contradictions and subtleties in Nietzsche's thought elsewhere which are not easily reconcilable. He could be both in praise and contempt of women at one time or another. For instance, in the following passage: "What inspires respect for woman, and often enough even fear, is her nature, which is more “natural” than man’s, the genuine, cunning suppleness of a beast of prey, the tiger’s claw under the glove, the naiveté of her egoism, her uneducability and inner wildness, the incomprehensibility, scope, and movement of her desires and virtues." (''Beyond Good and Evil'', section 239.)

His attitude can sometimes be entirely disparaging: "From the beginning, nothing has been more alien, repugnant, and hostile to woman than truth—her great art is the lie, her highest concern is mere appearance and beauty." In section 6 in "Why I Write Such Excellent Books" of ''Ecce Homo'', he claims that "goodness" in women is a sign of "physiological degeneration", and that women are on the whole cleverer and more wicked than men- which in Nietzsche's view, constitutes a compliment. Yet he goes on to claim that the emancipation of women, and feminists, was merely the resentment of some women against other women, who were physically better constituted and able to bear children.

Despite Nietzsche's writings being viewed as being misogynistic by many, others, such as [[Anthony Ludovici]], insist that he is only an [[anti-feminist]], not a misogynist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ludovici|first1=Anthony|title=Enemies of Women (The Origins in Outline of Anglo-Saxon Feminism)|date=1948|publisher=Carroll &amp; Nicholson Limited|location=London|page=VII|accessdate=3 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other writings include:

"Woman's love involves injustice and blindness against everything that she does not love... Woman is not yet capable of friendship: women are still cats and birds. Or at best cows... (''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'', On the Friend)

"Woman! One-half of mankind is weak, typically sick, changeable, inconstant... she needs a religion of weakness that glorifies being weak, loving, and being humble as divine: or better, she makes the strong weak--she rules when she succeeds in overcoming the strong... Woman has always conspired with the types of decadence, the priests, against the 'powerful', the 'strong', the men-" ([[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]] - 864, Second German edition of 1906) (It must be noted, however, that ''The Will to Power'' is a gathering of notes and fragments assembled through his sister [[Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche]] and others which were never approved by Nietzsche himself to be published.)

==Possible influence from Aristotle==
Scholars of [[Aristotle]] have drawn comparisons between Nietzsche's views on women and [[Aristotle's views on women]]. They have argued that Nietzsche may have borrowed much of his political philosophy from the latter.&lt;ref&gt;Durant, Will (1926 (2006). The Story of Philosophy. United States: Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc., p. 86 ,{{ISBN|978-0-671-73916-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact of Nietzsche's anthropology==
Some philosophers{{who|date=August 2015}} have even suggested that Nietzsche's philosophy cannot be understood or analyzed apart from his remarks on women. They discuss the fact that Nietzsche's work has been useful in the development of some feminist theory but ultimately conclude "While Nietzsche challenges traditional hierarchies between mind and body, reason and irrationality, nature and culture, truth and fiction - hierarchies that have been used to degrade and exclude women - his remarks about women and his use of feminine and maternal metaphors throughout his writings confound attempts simply to proclaim Nietzsche a champion of feminism or women."&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Oliver, Marilyn Pearsall, "Introduction: Why Feminists Read Nietzsche", in Feminist Interpretations of Friedrich Nietzsche, Penn State Press, 1998, pp 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with Salomé==
[[Lou Andreas-Salomé]], who knew Nietzsche very well, and claimed that he had proposed to her (according to her, she refused him) claimed there was something feminine in Nietzsche's "spiritual nature", and that he had considered genius to be a feminine genius.&lt;ref&gt;Biddy Martin, Women and Modernity: The (Life)Styles of Lou Andreas-Salomé, Ithaca, Cornell University Press, 1991, p98&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=April 2018}}

==Apparent misogyny as rhetorical strategy==
Frances Nesbitt Oppel interprets Nietzsche's attitude towards women as part of a [[rhetoric]]al strategy.&lt;blockquote&gt;...Nietzsche's apparent misogyny is part of his overall strategy to demonstrate that our attitudes toward sex-gender are thoroughly cultural, are often destructive of our own potential as individuals and as a species, and may be changed. What looks like misogyny may be understood as part of a larger strategy whereby "woman-as-such" (the universal essence of woman with timeless character traits) is shown to be a product of male desire, a construct.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Nesbitt Oppel, Nietzsche on Gender, University of Virginia Press, 2005, p1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Not advocating a model for others==
{{POV-section|date=June 2014}}
Others exhibit a less tolerant sophistication, though some recognize that Nietzsche made these remarks from a consciously relative position, and while they show little patience for his remarks overall they recognize that however odious his individual opinion of women may have been, he was not advocating it as a model for others. Cornelia Klinger states in her book ''Continental Philosophy in Feminist Perspective'': "Nietzsche, like Schopenhauer a prominent hater of women, at least relativizes his savage statements about woman-as-such."&lt;ref&gt;Cornelia Klinger, Herta Nagl-Docekal, Continental Philosophy in Feminist Perspective, Penn State Press, 2002, p224&lt;/ref&gt; One of Nietzsche's own statements is cited in support of this assertion:&lt;blockquote&gt;"Whenever a cardinal problem is at stake, there speaks an unchangeable "this is I"; about man and woman, for example, a thinker cannot relearn but only finish learning–only discover ultimately how this is "settled in him." At times we find certain solutions of problems that inspire strong faith in ''us''; some call them henceforth ''their'' "convictions." Later–we see them only as steps to self-knowledge, signposts to the problem we ''are''–rather, to the great stupidity we are, to our spiritual ''fatum'', to what is ''unteachable'' very "deep down". &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After this abundant civility that I have just evidenced in relation to myself I shall perhaps be permitted more readily to state a few truths about "woman as such"–assuming that it is now known from the outset how very much these are after all only–''my'' truths." (BGE, 7, 231)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Psychological digs and constructions==
Another author takes up this same quote, recognizing that "[a]lthough Nietzsche as generously as ever saves his commentators the labor of interpretation the problem recurs precisely because of the nature of what he proceeds to call his truths." But instead of focusing on putative misogyny she opines:&lt;blockquote&gt;Much more [...] must be thought to affect everything Nietzsche writes about woman. Rather than mere psychological digs and constructions, rather than a simple expression of his own misogyny, Nietzsche's philosophic expression of the nature of woman reflects and repeats the possibilities of the affirmation or denial of illusion. This is Nietzsche's understanding of truth, and to this extent Nietzsche was able to exploit his own misogyny, in style, tracing the Platonic metaphor as such.&lt;ref&gt;Babette E. Babich, ''Nietzsche's Philosophy of Science'', SUNY Press, 1994,  p241&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Women as source of all folly and unreason==
As Leonard Lawlor and Zeynep Direk point out, "What Nietzsche ''says'' -and repeats with hysterical insistence- is that woman is the source of all folly and unreason, the siren figure who lures the male philosopher out of his appointed truth-seeking path."&lt;ref&gt;Leonard Lawlor and Zeynep Direk, Derrida, Routledge, 2002, p139&lt;/ref&gt;

Rev Prof '''George Jardine''' [[FRSE]] (1742–1827) was a Scottish minister of religion, philosopher, academic and educator. He was Professor at the [[University of Glasgow]], of Greek from 1774, and then [[Professor of Logic and Rhetoric, Glasgow|Professor of Logic and Rhetoric]] 1787 to 1824.&lt;ref&gt;Comments on teaching style [http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/mlemen/mlemen096.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; He was a co-founder of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1783 and co-founder of [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]] in 1792.

At the [[University of Glasgow]] he was a pioneer of [[collaborative learning]];&lt;ref&gt;Lynée Lewis Gaillet, ''A Foreshadowing of Modern Theories and Practices of Collaborative Learning: The Work of Scottish Rhetorician George Jardine.''

==Life==
[[File:The grave of prof George Jardine, Glasgow Cathedral churchyard.jpg|thumb|The grave of prof George Jardine, Glasgow Cathedral churchyard]]

He was born in 1742 at [[Lamington, South Lanarkshire|Wandel]] in [[Lanarkshire]] where  his predecessors had resided for nearly two hundred years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A biographical dictionary of eminent Scotsmen|publisher=Blackie &amp; Son|page=387|url=http://digital.nls.uk/biographical-dictionary-of-eminent-scotsmen/pageturner.cfm?id=74513188|author=Chambers, Robert |date=1874–1875 |accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was a daughter of Weir of Birkwood, in the parish of [[Lesmahagow]]. Jardine was transferred in October 1760 from the parish school to [[Glasgow College]], and after passing through the arts and divinity courses (MA 1765), was licensed to preach by the presbytery of [[Linlithgow]].

In 1770 he went to Paris as tutor to the sons of [[William Mure (1718–1776)|William Mure of Caldwell]], who obtained for him from [[David Hume]] introductions to [[Claude Adrien Helvétius|Helvetius]] and [[D'Alembert]]. Soon after his return from France in July 1773, he failed to secure election to the chair of humanity at Glasgow, by a single vote, but in June 1774 was appointed professor of Greek and assistant professor in logic. In 1787 he became sole professor of logic.

Jardine gave a practical turn to the teaching of his chair, and established a system of daily examination. His classes rose from an average of fifty to nearly two hundred. He expounded his principles of teaching in his ''Outlines of Philosophical Education'', published at Glasgow, 1818; 2nd edit. 1825. He was also an administrator and brought the finances of the college to order.

He had a country house, ''Hallside'' (near [[Cambuslang]] and modern-day [[Drumsagard Village]]) constructed in 1790.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gdl.cdlr.strath.ac.uk/smihou/smihou056.htm Country Houses of the old Glasgow gentry – Hallside House]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of the founders in 1792, and afterwards for more than twenty years secretary, of [[Glasgow Royal Infirmary]]. For over thirty years he was the representative of the presbytery of Hamilton in the [[General Assembly of the Church of Scotland]]. He retired from the chair of logic in 1824, and died on 27 January 1827.

He is buried in the Lindsay plot on the north side of the churchyard around [[Glasgow Cathedral]].

==Family==

In 1776 Jardine married Janet Lindsay, daughter of John Lindsay, founder in Glasgow. She died in 1815. They had one son, John Jardine, advocate, who held the office of sheriff of Ross and Cromarty, and died in 1850.

They are both buried with him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8106">{{God}}The '''God gene''' hypothesis proposes that human [[spirituality]] is influenced by heredity and that a specific [[gene]], called [[vesicular monoamine transporter 2]] (VMAT2), predisposes humans towards [[spirituality|spiritual]] or [[mysticism|mystic]] experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silveira|first=Linda A.|date=2008-03-20|year=|title=Experimenting with Spirituality: Analyzing The God Gene in a Nonmajors Laboratory Course|url=http://www.lifescied.org/content/7/1/132|journal=CBE-Life Sciences Education|language=en|volume=7|issue=1|pages=132–145|doi=10.1187/cbe.07-05-0029|issn=1931-7913|pmc=2262126|pmid=18316816|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has been proposed by [[Genetics|geneticist]] [[Dean Hamer]] in the 2004 book called ''[[The God Gene: How Faith is Hardwired into our Genes]]''.

The God gene hypothesis is based on a combination of behavioral genetic, neurobiological and psychological studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Dean|last= Hamer|title= The God Gene: How Faith Is Hardwired Into Our Genes|year= 2005 |publisher=Anchor Books |isbn=0-385-72031-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major arguments of the hypothesis are: (1) spirituality can be [[Quantitative property|quantified]] by psychometric measurements; (2) the underlying tendency to spirituality is partially [[heritable]]; (3) part of this heritability can be attributed to the gene VMAT2; (4) this gene acts by altering [[monoamine]] levels; and (5) spirituality provides an evolutionary advantage by providing individuals with an innate sense of optimism.

==Proposal==
{{refimprove|date=March 2014}}
According to the God Gene hypothesis, spirituality has a genetic component, of which ([[VMAT2]]) comprises one component by contributing to sensations associated with  [[mysticism|mystic]] experiences, including the [[presence of God]] and feelings of connection to a larger universe.

The research uses the self-transcendence scale developed by psychologist [[Robert Cloninger]] to quantify spirituality using three sub-scales:  "self-forgetfulness" (as in the tendency to become totally absorbed in some activity, such as reading); "transpersonal identification" (a feeling of connectedness to a larger universe); and "mysticism" (an openness to believe things that remain unproven, such as [[Extra-sensory perception|ESP]]).   Cloninger suggests that taken together, these measurements are a reasonable way to [[Quantitative property|quantify]] (make measurable) an individual's propensity to [[Spirituality|spiritual]].

The self-transcendence measure was shown to be [[heritable]] by classical [[twin studies]] conducted by Lindon Eaves and Nicholas Martin. Their work demonstrated that approximately 40% of the variation in self-transcendence was due to genes.  By contrast, specific religious beliefs (such as belief in a particular deity) were found to have no genetic basis and are instead cultural units or [[memes]].  Similar conclusions were drawn from studies of identical twins reared apart.

In order to identify some of the specific genes involved in self-transcendence, Hamer analyzed DNA and personality score data from over 1,000 individuals and identified one particular locus, VMAT2, with a significant correlation.  VMAT2 codes for a vesicular monoamine transporter that plays a key role in regulating the levels of the brain chemicals serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine.  These monoamine transmitters are in turn postulated to play an important role in regulating the brain activities associated with mystic beliefs.

Hamer hypothesized that self-transcendence might provide an evolutionary advantage by providing human beings with an innate sense of optimism that gives people the will to keep on living and procreating, despite the inevitability of death, and promoting better health and recovery from diseases.

==Scientific response==
In the brain, VMAT2 proteins are located on [[synaptic vesicle]]s. VMAT2 transports [[monoamine neurotransmitter]]s from the [[cytosol]] of monoamine [[neuron]]s into vesicles. [[PZ Myers]] argues: "It's a pump. A teeny-tiny pump responsible for packaging a neurotransmitter for export during brain activity. Yes, it's important, and it may even be active and necessary during higher order processing, like religious thought. But one thing it isn't is a 'god gene.'"&lt;ref name="No god, and no 'god gene', either"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/no_god_and_no_god_gene_either/ |title=No god, and no 'god gene', either |last=Myers |first=PZ |date=2005-02-13 |publisher=Pharyngula |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003213607/http://pharyngula.org/index/weblog/comments/no_god_and_no_god_gene_either/ |archivedate=October 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl Zimmer]] claimed that VMAT2 can be characterized as a gene that accounts for less than one percent of the variance of self-transcendence scores. These, Zimmer says, can signify anything from belonging to the Green Party to believing in [[Extrasensory perception|ESP]].  Zimmer also points out that the God Gene theory is based on only one unpublished, unreplicated study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zimmer | first = Carl | authorlink = Carl Zimmer |date=October 2004 | title = Faith-Boosting Genes: A search for the genetic basis of spirituality | journal = [[Scientific American]] | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000AD4E7-6290-1150-902F83414B7F4945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However Hamer notes that the importance of the VMAT2 finding is not that it explains all spiritual or religious feelings, but rather that it points the way toward one neurobiological pathway that may be important.

==Religious response==
[[John Polkinghorne]], an Anglican priest, member of the [[Royal Society]] and [[Canon (priest)|Canon]] [[theology|Theologian]] at [[Liverpool Cathedral]], was asked for a comment on Hamer's theory by the [[United Kingdom|British]] national daily newspaper, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. He replied: "The idea of a God gene goes against all my personal theological convictions. You can't cut faith down to the lowest common denominator of genetic survival. It shows the poverty of [[reductionism|reductionist]] thinking." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.srtp.org.uk/godgene.htm The 'God Gene' Sales Stunt] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813233431/http://www.srtp.org.uk/godgene.htm |date=August 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2004/nov/14/20041114-111404-8087r/ Geneticist claims to have found 'God gene' in humans]&lt;/ref&gt;

Walter Houston, the [[chaplain]] of [[Mansfield College, Oxford]], and a fellow in [[theology]], told the ''Telegraph'': "Religious belief is not just related to a person's constitution; it's related to society, tradition, character&amp;mdash;everything's involved. Having a gene that could do all that seems pretty unlikely to me."

Hamer responded that the existence of such a gene would not be incompatible with the existence of a personal God: "Religious believers can point to the existence of God genes as one more sign of the creator's ingenuity&amp;mdash;a clever way to help humans acknowledge and embrace a divine presence."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt; He repeatedly notes in his book that, "This book is about whether God genes exist, not about whether there is a God."&lt;ref&gt;Hamer, Dean (2005). ''The God Gene: How Faith Is Hardwired Into Our Genes''. Anchor Books. Page 16&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graded absolutism''' is a theory of [[moral absolutism]] in [[Christian ethics]] which resolves the objection to absolutism that in moral conflicts we are obligated to opposites.  Moral absolutism is the [[Ethics|ethical]] view that certain actions are absolutely right or wrong regardless of other contexts such as their consequences or the intentions behind them.  Graded absolutism is moral absolutism but qualifies that a moral absolute, like "Do not kill," can be greater or lesser than another moral absolute, like "Do not lie". Also called contextual absolutism or the greater good view, is an alternative to the third alternative view and the [[Lesser of two evils principle|lesser evil view]], both discussed below, regarding moral conflict resolution.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

According to graded absolutism, in [[Ethical dilemma|moral conflicts]], the dilemma is not that we are obligated to opposites, because greater absolutes are not opposites of lesser absolutes, and evil is not the opposite of good but is instead the privation of good.  Since evil is the privation of good, only the privation of the greater good counts as evil, since whenever there is a moral conflict, we are only obligated to the greater good.  The real dilemma is that we cannot perform both conflicting absolutes at the same time.  'Which' absolutes are in conflict depends on the context, but which conflicting absolute is ‘greater’ does not depend on the context. That is why graded absolutism is also called 'contextual absolutism' but is not to be confused with [[situational ethics]]. The conflict is resolved in acting according to the greater absolute. That is why graded absolutism is also called the 'greater good view', but is not to be confused with [[utilitarianism]].

==The third alternative view==

This is the view that there are never any real moral conflicts and that there is always a third alternative. For example, instead of answering in the affirmative or negative to the Nazi at the door, one may simply withhold an answer.

==The lesser evil view==

[[Lesser of two evils principle|The lesser evil view]] is the view that the only way out of a moral conflict is to violate one of the moral absolutes and choose the lesser evil.  For example, if we disagree with [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s thoughts on the [[categorical imperative]] and say that lying is a lesser evil than helping a would-be murderer, the lesser evil view would have us lie rather than help a would-be murderer.  According to the proponent of graded absolutism, this violates the [[ought implies can]] principle and defeats itself in obligating evil.

==The greater good view==

The greater good view is the view that there are real moral conflicts between absolutes, but rather than requiring a third alternative (as in the case of the third alternative view above) or obligating evil (as in the case of the lesser evil view above), this view obligates the greater absolute, or greater good.  For example, when one saves a life rather than telling the truth to a would-be murderer, one is committing the greater good of saving life, rather than violating the lesser good of telling the truth or committing the lesser (than aiding a murderer) evil of lying.  Since evil is the privation of good, only the privation of the greater good counts as evil, since whenever there is a moral conflict, we are only obligated to the greater good.

Currently he is the abbot of Mahabodhi Temple in Singapore.

In February 2017, Guo Jun stepped down as abbot of the Mahabodhi Monastery  and now the president of the monastery's management committee. Venerable Jing Yao replaced him as the abbott, witnessed by senior monks from various countries. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fjnet.com/hwjj/haiwainr/201702/t20170220_243623.htm | title=净耀法师荣膺新加坡菩提阁方丈升座大典圆满举行 | accessdate=2017-10-25 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025185737/http://www.fjnet.com/hwjj/haiwainr/201702/t20170220_243623.htm | archivedate=2017-10-25 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court cases==
Businessman Lee Boon Teow, who is also a trustee of the Mahabodhi Monastery and former vice-president of its management committee, has filed three lawsuits against Guo Jun. Lee had also filed a [[Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau]] report against the monk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/bid-to-suspend-monasterys-abbot-fails | title=Bid to suspend monastery's abbot fails | accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two were in a dispute over the ownership of a Buddhist sculpture valued around over $1 million. Lee Boon Teow has sued the monk for defamation over a series of group chat messages that the former abbot had shared with other management committee members, where Guo Jun had allegedly implied that Lee's company was in financial difficulties and questioned if his cancer relapse was affecting his judgement and decision-making.&lt;ref name="sculpture"&gt;{{cite news | first1=Selina | last1=Lum | url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/settlement-reached-over-sculpture-dispute | title=Settlement reached over sculpture dispute | date=25 October 2017 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025132535/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/settlement-reached-over-sculpture-dispute | archivedate=25 October 2017 | deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee claimed that Guo Jun discredited him as he had uncovered the monk's alleged impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=法庭文件揭 果峻化名网上找男伴|url=http://www.zaobao.com.sg/znews/singapore/story20171024-805498|work=联合早报网|date=24 October 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024123722/http://www.zaobao.com.sg/znews/singapore/story20171024-805498|archivedate=24 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mothership&gt;{{cite news|title=Metrosexual millionaire monk in S’pore sued over S$244,000 ‘study grant’|url=https://mothership.sg/2017/11/metrosexual-millionaire-monk-in-spore-sued-over-s244000-study-grant/|work=Mothership.sg|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180224233640/https://mothership.sg/2017/11/metrosexual-millionaire-monk-in-spore-sued-over-s244000-study-grant/|archivedate=2018-02-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guo Jun countersued Lee, claiming ownership of the sculpture and asked for its return.

On 24 October 2017, a settlement was reached over the defamation lawsuit, with Guo Jun offering to pay $30,000 to Lee Boon Teow to settle the case, without admitting to any defamation or guilt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Trustee and ex-abbot of monastery settle dispute over religious sculpture|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/trustee-and-ex-abbot-of-monastery-settle-dispute-over-religious-sculpture|work=The Straits Times|date=24 October 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171025193044/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/trustee-and-ex-abbot-of-monastery-settle-dispute-over-religious-sculpture|archivedate=25 October 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November 2017, Lee also told the High Court that his monetary contributions for the monk to pursue a doctoral degree was used by Guo Jun to buy a A$545,000 property in Sydney, Australia. Guo Jun believed that the money had been given to him as a gift for his own use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lum|first1=Selina|title=Prominent monk sued by devotee seeking return of A$240,000 'study grant'|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/prominent-monk-sued-by-devotee-seeking-return-of-a240000-study-grant|work=The Straits Times|date=28 November 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202132047/http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/courts-crime/prominent-monk-sued-by-devotee-seeking-return-of-a240000-study-grant|archivedate=2 December 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the proceedings, Guo Jun disclosed that he has at least A$3 million in assets in 2009, and that he has a "different interpretation" of Buddhist concepts of austerity; he believes he should manage his own financial assets and expenditure, without disclosing them to the monastery or its management committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=果峻：有钱没错 “我是钱的保管人”|url=http://www.zaobao.com.sg/znews/singapore/story20171130-815143|work=联合早报网|date=30 November 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319125408/http://www.zaobao.com.sg/znews/singapore/story20171130-815143|archivedate=19 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mothership/&gt;

Hindemburg has written over 1600 articles on science, philosophy, chess, finance, among other fields, and the book ''IMC na Balança'' ("BMI on the scale").

Hindemburg is known as a player of [[correspondence chess]] (with a rating of 2328&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iccf.com/player?id=70781 International Correspondence Chess Federation: Melão Jr., Hindemburg]&lt;/ref&gt;), and of [[blindfold chess]], where he holds the record for “longest announced mate in simultaneous blindfold chess”, with an announced checkmate in 12 moves in a [[simultaneous exhibition]] against nine boards, which was recorded in the ''[[Guinness Book]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Guinness Book of Records [S.l.: s.n.] 1998, pp. 110–111. {{ISBN|85-86293-64-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also gathered a collection of blindfold chess games from many players from different epochs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blindfoldchess.net/blog/2009/11/both_without_sight_two_of_the_best_blindfold_masters_faced_each_other_in_19/&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''IMC na Balança'', Hindemburg proposed a correction in the formula used for the [[body mass index]]:&lt;ref&gt;''[http://pt.scribd.com/doc/56882680/IMC-na-balanca#scribd IMC na Balança]'', Ed. Ferrari, 2009 {{ISBN|9788561306182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;BMI = 1.72 m / h^3&lt;/math&gt;

where ''m'' is the mass and ''h'' the height of a person, in the [[International System of Units]].

His studies on the financial market have resulted in the creation of ''[https://www.saturnov.org Saturn V]'', an artificial intelligence software that continuously analyzes the prices of financial instruments in search for morphological patterns. It was presented at ''[[Shark Tank]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twyw4RGu5eI&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''In memoriam''' (Latin for ''in memory of'') '''card''' is greeting card that is printed as a commemoration for certain events such as the [[sacraments|sacrament]] of first [[holy communion]], [[marriage]], and the reception of [[holy orders]]. However, these cards are most associated with a [[death]] and [[funeral]]. In addition to a religious image, such as that of a [[saint]], it often also includes a prayer, and details regarding the given event. The first known example appeared in the [[Netherlands]] in the 17th century.

'''Inherent powers''' are powers held by a [[sovereign state]]. In the [[United States]], the [[President of the United States|President]] derives these [[Political power|powers]] from the loosely worded statements in the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] that "the executive Power shall be [[vested]] in a [[President]]" and the president should "take care that the laws be faithfully executed" (defined in practice, rather than by constitutional or [[statutory]] law).

In re Debs, 158 U.S. 564 (1896)[1] was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision involving [[Eugene V. Debs]] and labor unions. Debs (president of the [[American Railway Union]]) was involved in the [[Pullman Strike]] earlier in 1894, and challenged the federal injunction ordering the strikers back to work. The injunction had been issued because of the hindrance to transportation of U.S. Mail. However, Debs refused to end the strike and was cited for contempt of court; he appealed the decision to the courts. The main question being debated was whether the [[President]] had a right to issue the injunction, which dealt with both interstate and intrastate commerce and shipping on rail cars. The legislative branch had never [[delegated]] to the President the power to issue an injunction. However, in a unanimous decision written by Justice David Josiah Brewer, the court ruled in favor of the U.S. government. Joined by Chief Justice Melville Fuller and Associate Justices [[Stephen Johnson Field]], John Marshall Harlan, Horace Gray, Henry Billings Brown, George Shiras, Jr., [[Howell Edmunds Jackson]] and Edward Douglass White, the court ruled that the government had a right to regulate interstate commerce and ensure the operations of the Postal Service, along with a responsibility to "ensure the general welfare of the public." 

The constitution is interpreted by the government and the people. However, the limits of inherent powers were articulated in ''Youngstown Sheet &amp; Tube Co. v. Sawyer'', 343 U.S. 579 (1952)[1]. This case was a Supreme Court decision limiting the power of the president to seize private property in the absence of either specifically enumerated authority under Article Two of the United States Constitution or statutory authority conferred on him by Congress. However, Justice Black's majority decision was qualified by separate concurring opinions of five other members of the Court; this made it difficult to determine the details and limits of the president's power to seize private property in emergencies. Justice Jackson's concurring opinion provided three categories to be considered:
*Congress authorizes (express or implied)
*Congress disapproves (express or implied)
*Congress does nothing (which can invite judicial consideration of the president's actions)

From some time before 1678 he had also been censor of the books published by the S. Ufficio, Venice, which presupposed his Catholic loyalty, actually praised by D’ Alviani. His Greek and theological wisdom, his modesty, piety and other humane virtues are praised by Petin, Nicholas Bouboulios and D’ Alviani. In 1685 he appears as bestman at the marriage of Antonia daughter of Const. Tzane the Cretan painter to Mario Botza.

In [[knowledge representation]], [[object-oriented programming]] and [[Object-oriented design|design]] (see [[object-oriented]] [[program architecture]]), '''is-a''' ('''is_a''' or '''is a''') is a [[wikt:subsume|subsumption]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[Liskov substitution principle]].&lt;/ref&gt; relationship between [[abstractions]] (e.g. [[type (disambiguation)|types]], [[class (disambiguation)|classes]]), wherein one [[Class (computer programming)|class]] ''A'' is a [[subclass (disambiguation)|subclass]] &lt;!-- This deliberately links to the disambiguation page --&gt; of another class ''B'' (and so ''B'' is a [[superclass (disambiguation)|superclass]] &lt;!--This deliberately links to the disambiguation page--&gt; of ''A'').
In other words, type A is a subtype of type B when A’s [[Formal specification|specification]] implies B’s specification. That is, any object (or class) that satisfies A’s specification also satisfies B’s specification, because B’s specification is weaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Subtypes and Subclasses|url=http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-170-laboratory-in-software-engineering-fall-2005/lecture-notes/lec14.pdf|publisher=MIT OCW|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''is-a'' relationship is to be contrasted with the ''[[has-a]]'' (''has_a'' or ''has a'') relationship between types (classes); confusing the relations ''has-a'' and ''is-a'' is a common error when designing a model (e.g., a [[computer program]]) of the real-world relationship between an object and its subordinate. The ''is-a'' relationship may also be contrasted with the ''[[Typeof|instance-of]]'' relationship between objects (instances) and types (classes): see "[[type-token distinction]]" and "[[type-token relations]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Type–token relations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To summarize the relations, we have

* [[hyperonym]]–[[hyponym]] (supertype–subtype) relations between types (classes) defining a taxonomic hierarchy, where
** for a [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|subsumption]] relation: a hyponym (subtype, subclass) has a ''type-of'' (''is-a'') relationship with its hyperonym (supertype, superclass);
* [[holonym]]–[[meronym]] (whole/entity/container-part/constituent/member) relations between types (classes) defining a possessive hierarchy, where
** for an [[Aggregation (object-oriented programming)|aggregation]] (i.e. without ownership) relation:
*** a holonym (whole) has a ''has-a'' relationship with its meronym (part),
** for a [[Composition (object-oriented programming)|composition]] (i.e. with ownership) relation:
*** a meronym (constituent) has a ''[[part-of]]'' relationship with its holonym (entity),
** for a [[Object composition#Containment|containment]]&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Containment (computer programming)]].&lt;/ref&gt; relation:
*** a meronym (member) has a ''[[member-of]]'' relationship with its holonym ([[Container (abstract data type)|container]]);
* concept-object (type-token) relations between types (classes) and objects (instances), where
** a token (object) has an ''[[Instance (computer science)|instance-of]]'' relationship with its type (class).

==Examples of subtyping==

[[Subtype polymorphism|Subtyping]] enables a given type to be substituted for another type or abstraction. Subtyping is said to establish an '''is-a''' relationship between the subtype and some existing abstraction, either implicitly or explicitly, depending on language support. The relationship can be expressed explicitly via inheritance in languages that support inheritance as a subtyping mechanism.

===C++===
The following C++ code establishes an explicit inheritance relationship between classes '''B''' and '''A''', where '''B''' is both a subclass and a subtype of '''A''', and can be used as an '''A''' wherever a '''B''' is specified (via a reference, a pointer or the object itself).

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;class A
{ public:
   void DoSomethingALike() const {}
};

class B : public A
{ public:
   void DoSomethingBLike() const {}
};

void UseAnA(A const&amp; some_A)
{
   some_A.DoSomethingALike();
}

void SomeFunc()
{
   B b;
   UseAnA(b); // b can be substituted for an A.
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell2002"&gt;
{{cite book

 | location=Cambridge, UK
 | isbn=0-521-78098-5
 | page=287
 | chapter=10 "Concepts in object-oriented languages"}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Python===
The following python code establishes an explicit inheritance relationship between classes '''B''' and '''A''', where '''B''' is both a subclass and a subtype of '''A''', and can be used as an '''A''' wherever a '''B''' is required.

&lt;source lang="python"&gt;class A:
    def doSomethingALike(self):
        pass

class B(A):
    def doSomethingBLike(self):
        pass

def useAnA(some_A):
    some_A.doSomethingALike()

def someFunc():
    b = B()
    useAnA(b)  # b can be substituted for an A.
&lt;/source&gt;

The following example, type(a) is a "regular" type, and type(type(a)) is a metatype. While as distributed all types have the same metatype (PyType_Type, which is also its own metatype), this is not a requirement. The type of classic classes, known as types.ClassType, can also be considered a distinct metatype.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Guido van Rossum|title=Subtyping Built-in Types|url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0253/|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=python&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 0
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(type(a))
&lt;type 'type'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(type(type(a)))
&lt;type 'type'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(type(type(type(a))))
&lt;type 'type'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Java===

In Java, '''is-a''' relation between the type parameters of one class or interface and the type parameters of another are determined by the extends and [[Interface (Java)|implements]] clauses.

Using the Collections classes, ArrayList&lt;E&gt; implements List&lt;E&gt;, and List&lt;E&gt; extends Collection&lt;E&gt;. So ArrayList&lt;String&gt; is a subtype of List&lt;String&gt;, which is a subtype of Collection&lt;String&gt;. The subtyping relationship is preserved between the types automatically. When we define an interface, PayloadList, that associates an optional value of generic type P with each element. Its declaration might look like:

&lt;source lang=java&gt;
interface PayloadList&lt;E, P&gt; extends List&lt;E&gt; {
    void setPayload(int index, P val);
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The following parameterizations of PayloadList are subtypes of List&lt;String&gt;:

&lt;source lang=java&gt;
PayloadList&lt;String, String&gt;
PayloadList&lt;String, Integer&gt;
PayloadList&lt;String, Exception&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==Liskov substitution principle==
{{main|Liskov substitution principle}}
Liskov substitution principle explains a property, ''"If for each object o1 of type S there is an object o2 of type T such that for all programs P defined in terms of T, the behavior of P is unchanged when o1 is substituted for o2 then S is a subtype of T,"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liskov|first=Barbara|title=Data Abstraction and Hierarchy|date=May 1988|publisher=SIGPLAN Notices}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following example shows a violation of LSP.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;void DrawShape(const Shape&amp; s)
{
  if (typeid(s) == typeid(Square))
    DrawSquare(static_cast&lt;Square&amp;&gt;(s));
  else if (typeid(s) == typeid(Circle))
    DrawCircle(static_cast&lt;Circle&amp;&gt;(s));
}&lt;/source&gt;
Obviously, the DrawShape function is badly formatted. It has to know about every derivative classes of Shape class. Also, it should be changed whenever new subclass of Shape are created. In [[object-oriented design]], many{{who|date=April 2017}} view the structure of this as anathema.

Here is a more subtle example of violation of LSP:

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
class Rectangle
{
  public:
    void   SetWidth(double w)  { itsWidth = w; }
    void   SetHeight(double h) { itsHeight = h; }
    double GetHeight() const   { return itsHeight; }
    double GetWidth() const    { return itsWidth; }
  private:
    double itsWidth;
    double itsHeight;
};
&lt;/source&gt;
This works well but when it comes to Square class, which inherits Rectangle class, it violates LSP even though the '''is-a''' relationship holds between Rectangle and Square. Because square is rectangular. The following example overrides two functions, Setwidth and SetHeight, to fix the problem. But fixing the code implies that the design is faulty.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
public class Square : Rectangle
{
  public:
    virtual void SetWidth(double w);
    virtual void SetHeight(double h);
};
void Square::SetWidth(double w)
{
    Rectangle::SetWidth(w);
    Rectangle::SetHeight(w);
}
void Square::SetHeight(double h)
{
    Rectangle::SetHeight(h);
    Rectangle::SetWidth(h);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The following example, function g just works for Rectangle class but not for Square, and so the open-closed principle has been violated.

&lt;source lang=cpp&gt;
void g(Rectangle&amp; r)
{
  r.SetWidth(5);
  r.SetHeight(4);
  assert(r.GetWidth() * r.GetHeight()) == 20);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{Judaism}}

'''Judaism''' (originally from [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] {{Hebrew|יהודה}}, ''Yehudah'', "[[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]";&lt;ref name="bibleinterp_mason3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="askoxford" /&gt; via [[Latin]] and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]) is the religion of the [[Jews|Jewish people]]. It is an ancient, [[monotheistic]], [[Abrahamic religion]] with the [[Torah]] as its foundational text.&lt;ref name="uncertainties" /&gt; It encompasses the [[religion]], [[philosophy]], and [[culture]] of the [[Jewish people]].&lt;ref name="Judaism" /&gt; Judaism is considered by religious Jews to be the expression of the [[Mosaic covenant|covenant]] that [[God in Judaism|God]] established with the [[Children of Israel]].&lt;ref name="Knowledge Resources: Judaism" /&gt; Judaism encompasses a wide corpus of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. The Torah is part of the larger text known as the [[Tanakh]] or the [[Hebrew Bible]], and supplemental oral tradition represented by later texts such as the [[Midrash]] and the [[Talmud]]. With between 14.5 and 17.4&amp;nbsp;million adherents worldwide,&lt;ref name="Population of Jews" /&gt; Judaism is [[Major religious groups#Religious demographics|the tenth largest religion in the world]].

Within Judaism there are a variety of movements, most of which emerged from [[Rabbinic Judaism]], which holds that God revealed his laws and [[613 Mitzvot|commandments]] to [[Moses]] on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]] in the form of both the [[Torah|Written]] and [[Oral Torah]].&lt;ref name="What is the oral Torah?" /&gt; Historically, this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the [[Sadducees#General|Sadducees]] and [[Hellenistic Judaism]] during the [[Second Temple period]]; the [[Karaite Judaism#Karaite interpretations of the Torah|Karaites]] and [[Sabbateans]] during the early and later medieval period;&lt;ref name="Karaite Jewish University" /&gt; and among segments of the modern non-Orthodox denominations. Modern branches of Judaism such as [[Humanistic Judaism]] may be [[nontheistic]].&lt;ref name="Society for Humanistic Judaism" /&gt; Today, the largest [[Jewish religious movements]] are [[Orthodox Judaism]] ([[Haredi Judaism]] and [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]]), [[Conservative Judaism]], and [[Reform Judaism]]. Major sources of difference between these groups are their approaches to [[Jewish law]], the authority of the [[Rabbinic tradition]], and the significance of the [[State of Israel]].&lt;ref name="Jewish Denominations" /&gt; Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and Jewish law are divine in origin, eternal and unalterable, and that they should be strictly followed. Conservative and Reform Judaism are more [[Religious liberalism|liberal]], with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of Judaism's requirements than Reform Judaism. A typical Reform position is that Jewish law should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews.&lt;ref name="Reform Judaism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="What is Reform Judaism?" /&gt; Historically, [[beth din|special courts]] enforced Jewish law; today, these courts still exist but the practice of Judaism is mostly voluntary.&lt;ref name="Britannica Online Encyclopedia: Bet Din" /&gt; Authority on theological and legal matters is not vested in any one person or organization, but in the sacred texts and the [[rabbis]] and scholars who interpret them.&lt;ref name="religiousleadership" /&gt;

The [[history of Judaism]] spans more than 3,000 years.&lt;ref name="MINDELL2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=David P Mindell|title=The Evolving World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s8kA6eaz7hsC&amp;pg=PA224|date=30 June 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-04108-0|page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism has its roots as an [[organized religion]] in the [[Middle East]] during the [[Bronze Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/judaism/history/history_1.shtml|title=History of Judaism until 164 BCE|work=History of Judaism|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judaism is considered one of the oldest monotheistic religions.&lt;ref name="Religion &amp; Ethics – Judaism" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/globalconnections/mideast/themes/religion/ Religion: Three Religions, One God] PBS&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hebrews]] and [[Israelites]] were already referred to as "Jews" in later books of the Tanakh such as the [[Book of Esther]], with the term Jews replacing the title "Children of Israel".&lt;ref name="google" /&gt; Judaism's texts, traditions and values strongly influenced later [[Abrahamic religions]], including [[Christianity]], [[Islam]] and the [[Baha'i Faith]].&lt;ref name="Islam, Judaism, and Christianity: Theological and Historical Affiliations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Historical Muhammad" /&gt; Many aspects of Judaism have also directly or indirectly influenced [[secular]] [[Western world|Western]] [[ethics]] and [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]].&lt;ref name="questia" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} [[Hebraism]] was just as important a factor in the ancient era development of [[Western civilization]] as [[wikt:Hellenism|Hellenism]], and Judaism, as the background of [[Christianity]], has considerably shaped Western ideals and morality since [[Early Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Cambridge University Historical Series"&gt;Cambridge University Historical Series, ''An Essay on Western Civilization in Its Economic Aspects'', p.40: Hebraism, like Hellenism, has been an all-important factor in the development of Western Civilization; Judaism, as the precursor of Christianity, has indirectly had had much to do with shaping the ideals and morality of western nations since the christian era.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews are an [[ethnoreligious group]]&lt;ref name="Ethnoreligious" /&gt; including those born Jewish, in addition to [[converts to Judaism]]. In 2015, the [[Jewish population by country|world Jewish population]] was estimated at about 14.3&amp;nbsp;million, or roughly 0.2% of the total world population.&lt;ref name=WJP2015&gt;{{cite web|title=World Jewish Population 2015|url=http://www.jewishdatabank.org/Studies/details.cfm?StudyID=803|accessdate=8 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 43% of all Jews reside in [[Israel]] and another 43% reside in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], with most of the remainder living in [[Europe]], and other minority groups spread throughout [[Latin America]], [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="WJP2015" /&gt;

Unlike other ancient Near Eastern gods, the Hebrew God is portrayed as unitary and solitary; consequently, the Hebrew God's principal relationships are not with other gods, but with the world, and more specifically, with the people he created.&lt;ref name="understanding" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} Judaism thus begins with ethical monotheism: the belief that God is one and is concerned with the actions of mankind.&lt;ref name="google1" /&gt; According to the [[Tanakh]] (Hebrew Bible), God promised [[Abraham]] to make of his offspring a great nation.&lt;ref name="everlasting" /&gt; Many generations later, he commanded the nation of [[Israelites|Israel]] to love and worship only one God; that is, the Jewish nation is to reciprocate God's concern for the world.&lt;ref name="deuteronomy" /&gt; He also commanded the Jewish people to love one another; that is, Jews are to imitate God's love for people.&lt;ref name="leviticus" /&gt; These commandments are but two of a large corpus of [[613 mitzvot|commandments]] and [[Halakha|laws]] that constitute this [[Covenant (biblical)|covenant]], which is the substance of Judaism.

Thus, although there is an esoteric tradition in Judaism ([[Kabbalah]]), Rabbinic scholar [[Max Kadushin]] has characterized normative Judaism as "normal mysticism", because it involves everyday personal experiences of God through ways or modes that are common to all Jews.&lt;ref name="publishing" /&gt; This is played out through the observance of the [[Halakha]] (Jewish law) and given verbal expression in the [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|Birkat Ha-Mizvot]], the short blessings that are spoken every time a positive commandment is to be fulfilled.
:The ordinary, familiar, everyday things and occurrences we have, constitute occasions for the experience of God. Such things as one's daily sustenance, the very day itself, are felt as manifestations of God's loving-kindness, calling for the ''Berakhot''. ''Kedushah'', holiness, which is nothing else than the imitation of God, is concerned with daily conduct, with being gracious and merciful, with keeping oneself from defilement by idolatry, adultery, and the shedding of blood. The ''Birkat Ha-Mitzwot'' evokes the consciousness of holiness at a rabbinic rite, but the objects employed in the majority of these rites are non-holy and of general character, while the several holy objects are [[Theurgy|non-theurgic.]] And not only do ordinary things and occurrences bring with them the experience of God. Everything that happens to a man evokes that experience, evil as well as good, for a ''Berakah'' is said also at evil tidings. Hence, although the experience of God is like none other, the ''occasions'' for experiencing Him, for having a consciousness of Him, are manifold, even if we consider only those that call for Berakot.&lt;ref name="publishing2" /&gt;
Whereas [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosophers]] often debate whether God is [[Immanence|immanent]] or [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], and whether people have free will or their lives are determined, [[Halakha]] is a system through which any Jew acts to bring God into the world.

Ethical monotheism is central in all sacred or normative texts of Judaism. However, monotheism has not always been followed in practice. The Jewish Bible ([[Tanakh]]) records and repeatedly condemns the widespread worship of other gods in [[ancient Israel]].&lt;ref name="mechon-mamre" /&gt; In the Greco-Roman era, many different interpretations of monotheism existed in Judaism, including the interpretations that gave rise to Christianity.&lt;ref name="The Jewish roots of Christological monotheism: papers from the St. Andrews conference on the historical origins of the worship of Jesus" /&gt;

Moreover, some have argued that Judaism is a non-creedal religion that does not require one to believe in God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283487502_Is_There_a_Jewish_Theology_or_Not|title=Is There a Jewish Theology or Not?|last=Maimes|first=Steven|date=Jan 2013|website=|language=en|via=ResearchGate|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Nov 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/must-a-jew-believe-in-god/|title=Must a Jew Believe in God?|last=Septimus|first=Daniel|work=My Jewish Learning|access-date=Nov 19, 2018|publisher=70 / Faces Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, observance of Jewish law is more important than belief in God ''per se''.&lt;ref name="jovanovich" /&gt; In modern times, some liberal Jewish movements do not accept the existence of a personified deity active in history.&lt;ref name="movements" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/community/st-tammany/index.ssf/2014/01/theology_on_tap_winter_2014_un.html|title=Theology on Tap Winter 2014 under way in Mandeville: Keeping the Faith|work=NOLA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate about whether one can speak of authentic or normative Judaism is not only a debate among religious Jews but also among historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Normative Judaism?

Scholars throughout [[Jewish history]] have proposed numerous formulations of Judaism's core tenets, all of which have met with criticism.&lt;ref name="montpelier" /&gt; The most popular formulation is [[Maimonides]]' [[13 principles of faith|thirteen principles of faith]], developed in the 12th century. According to Maimonides, any Jew who rejects even one of these principles would be considered an apostate and a heretic.&lt;ref name="mesora" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Maimonides, 13 Principles of Faith" /&gt; Jewish scholars have held points of view diverging in various ways from Maimonides' principles.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The JPS guide to Jewish traditions" /&gt;

In Maimonides' time, his list of tenets was criticized by [[Hasdai Crescas]] and [[Joseph Albo]]. Albo and [[Abraham ben David|the Raavad]] argued that Maimonides' principles contained too many items that, while true, were not fundamentals of the faith.

Along these lines, the ancient historian [[Josephus]] emphasized practices and observances rather than religious beliefs, associating [[apostasy]] with a failure to observe Jewish law and maintaining that the requirements for conversion to Judaism included [[circumcision]] and adherence to traditional customs. Maimonides' principles were largely ignored over the next few centuries.&lt;ref name="medieval" /&gt; Later, two poetic restatements of these principles ("''[[Ani Ma'amin]]''" and "''[[Yigdal]]''") became integrated into many Jewish liturgies,&lt;ref name="The Thirteen Principles of the Jewish Faith" /&gt; leading to their eventual near-universal acceptance.&lt;ref name="What Do Jews Believe?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="traditions" /&gt;

In modern times, Judaism lacks a centralized authority that would dictate an exact religious dogma.&lt;ref name="religiousleadership" /&gt;&lt;ref name="judaism101beliefs" /&gt; Because of this, many different variations on the basic beliefs are considered within the scope of Judaism.&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt; Even so, all [[Jewish religious movements]] are, to a greater or lesser extent, based on the principles of the [[Hebrew Bible]] and various commentaries such as the [[Talmud]] and [[Midrash]]. Judaism also universally recognizes the Biblical [[Covenant (biblical)|Covenant]] between God and the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarch]] [[Abraham]] as well as the additional aspects of the Covenant revealed to [[Moses]], who is considered Judaism's greatest [[prophet]].&lt;ref name="learning" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ontario" /&gt;&lt;ref name="patriarchscovenant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="How Do You Know the Exodus Really Happened?" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sacredtexts" /&gt; In the [[Mishnah]], a core text of [[Rabbinic Judaism]], acceptance of the Divine origins of this covenant is considered an essential aspect of Judaism and those who reject the Covenant forfeit their share in the [[World to Come]].&lt;ref name="sacred-texts" /&gt;

Establishing the core tenets of Judaism in the modern era is even more difficult, given the number and diversity of the contemporary [[Jewish religious movements|Jewish denominations]]. Even if to restrict the problem to the most influential intellectual trends of the nineteenth and twentieth century, the matter remains complicated. Thus for instance, [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik|Joseph Soloveitchik's]] (associated with the [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox movement]]) answer to modernity is constituted upon the identification of Judaism with following the [[halakha]] whereas its ultimate goal is to bring the holiness down to the world. [[Mordecai Kaplan]], the founder of the [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], abandons the idea of religion for the sake of identifying Judaism with [[civilization]] and by means of the latter term and secular translation of the core ideas, he tries to embrace as many Jewish denominations as possible. In turn, [[Solomon Schechter]]'s [[Conservative Judaism]] was identical with the tradition understood as the interpretation of Torah, in itself being the history of the constant updates and adjustment of the Law performed by means of the creative interpretation. Finally, [[David Philipson]] draws the outlines of the [[Reform Judaism|Reform movement]] in Judaism by opposing it to the strict and traditional rabbinical approach and thus comes to the conclusions similar to that of the Conservative movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/15006583/Some_Remarks_on_the_Self-Images_of_the_Modern_Judaism._Textual_Analysis|title=Some Remarks on the Self-Images of the Modern Judaism.

===Jewish legal literature===
{{Main article|Halakha}}
The basis of Jewish law and tradition (halakha) is the [[Torah]] (also known as the [[Pentateuch]] or the Five Books of Moses). According to rabbinic tradition, there are [[613 mitzvot|613 commandments]] in the Torah. Some of these laws are directed only to men or to women, some only to the ancient priestly groups, the [[Kohen|Kohanim]] and [[Levite|Leviyim]] (members of the tribe of [[Levi]]), some only to farmers within the [[Land of Israel]]. Many laws were only applicable when the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] existed, and only 369 of these commandments are still applicable today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/541686/jewish/How-Many-of-the-Torahs-Commandments-Still-Apply.htm|title=How Many of the Torah's Commandments Still Apply?|last=Danzinger|first=Eliezer|website=Chabad.org|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there have been Jewish groups whose beliefs were based on the written text of the Torah alone (e.g., the [[Sadducees]], and the [[Karaite Judaism|Karaites]]), most Jews believe in the [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|oral law]]. These oral traditions were transmitted by the [[Pharisees|Pharisee]] school of thought of ancient Judaism and were later recorded in written form and expanded upon by the rabbis.

According to Rabbinical Jewish tradition, God gave both the Written Law (the [[Torah]]) and the [[Oral law]] to Moses on [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]]. The Oral law is the oral tradition as relayed by God to Moses and from him, transmitted and taught to the sages ([[rabbi]]nic leaders) of each subsequent generation.

For centuries, the Torah appeared only as a written text transmitted in parallel with the oral tradition. Fearing that the oral teachings might be forgotten, Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] undertook the mission of consolidating the various opinions into one body of law which became known as the ''Mishnah''.&lt;ref&gt;Codex Judaica Kantor 2006, page 146" (as cited on [[Judah haNasi]])&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mishnah consists of 63 tractates codifying Jewish law, which are the basis of the ''Talmud.'' According to [[Abraham ben David]], the ''[[Mishnah]]'' was compiled by Rabbi [[Judah the Prince|Judah haNasi]] after the destruction of Jerusalem, in [[anno mundi]] 3949, which corresponds to 189 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Abraham ben David, ''Seder Ha-Kabbalah Leharavad'', Jerusalem 1971, p.16 (Hebrew) (as cited on [[Judah haNasi]])&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the next four centuries, the Mishnah underwent discussion and debate in both of the world's major Jewish communities (in Israel and [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Babylonia]]). The commentaries from each of these communities were eventually compiled into the two [[Talmud]]s, the Jerusalem Talmud (''Talmud Yerushalmi'') and the Babylonian Talmud (''Talmud Bavli''). These have been further expounded by commentaries of various Torah scholars during the ages.

In the text of the Torah, many words are left undefined and many procedures are mentioned without explanation or instructions. Such phenomena are sometimes offered to validate the viewpoint that the Written Law has always been transmitted with a parallel oral tradition, illustrating the assumption that the reader is already familiar with the details from other, i.e., oral, sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aishdas.org/student/oral.htm|title=Proofs for the Oral Law|last=Student|first=Gil|date=|website=The AishDas Society|access-date=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halakha, the rabbinic Jewish way of life, then, is based on a combined reading of the Torah, and the oral tradition—the Mishnah, the halakhic [[Midrash]], the Talmud and its commentaries. The Halakha has developed slowly, through a precedent-based system. The literature of questions to rabbis, and their considered answers, is referred to as [[responsa]] (in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], ''Sheelot U-Teshuvot''.) Over time, as practices develop, codes of Jewish law are written that are based on the responsa; the most important code, the [[Shulchan Aruch]], largely determines Orthodox religious practice today.

===Jewish philosophy===
{{Main article|Jewish philosophy}}
Jewish philosophy refers to the conjunction between serious study of philosophy and Jewish theology. Major Jewish philosophers include [[Solomon ibn Gabirol]], [[Saadia Gaon]], [[Judah Halevi]], [[Maimonides]], and [[Gersonides]]. Major changes occurred in response to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] (late 18th to early 19th century) leading to the post-Enlightenment Jewish philosophers. Modern Jewish philosophy consists of both Orthodox and non-Orthodox oriented philosophy. Notable among Orthodox Jewish philosophers are [[Eliyahu Eliezer Dessler]], [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], and [[Yitzchok Hutner]]. Well-known non-Orthodox Jewish philosophers include [[Martin Buber]], [[Franz Rosenzweig]], [[Mordecai Kaplan]], [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]], [[Will Herberg]], and [[Emmanuel Lévinas]].

===Rabbinic hermeneutics===
{{Quote box|width=35%|align=right|quote=13 Principles of Hermeneutics:

# A law that operates under certain conditions will surely be operative in other situations where the same conditions are present in a more acute form
# A law operating in one situation will also be operative in another situation if the text characterizes both situations in identical terms.
# A law that clearly expresses the purpose it was meant to serve will also apply to other situations where the identical purpose may be served.
# When a general rule is followed by illustrative particulars, only those particulars are to be embraced by it.
# A law that begins with specifying particular cases, and then proceeds to an all-embracing generalization, is to be applied to particulars cases not specified but logically falling into the same generalization.
# A law that begins with a generalization as to its intended applications, then continues with the specification of particular cases, and then concludes with a restatement of the generalization, can be applied only to the particular cases specified.
# The rules about a generalization being followed or preceded by specifying particulars (rules 4 and 5) will not apply if it is apparent that the specification of the particular cases or the statement of the generalization is meant purely for achieving a greater clarity of language.
# A particular case already covered in a generalization that is nevertheless treated separately suggests that the same particularized treatment be applied to all other cases which are covered in that generalization.
# A penalty specified for a general category of wrongdoing is not to be automatically applied to a particular case that is withdrawn from the general rule to be specifically prohibited, but without any mention of the penalty.
# A general prohibition followed by a specified penalty may be followed by a particular case, normally included in the generalization, with a modification in the penalty, either toward easing it or making it more severe.
# A case logically falling into a general law but treated separately remains outside the provisions of the general law except in those instances where it is specifically included in them.
# Obscurities in Biblical texts may be cleared up from the immediate context or from subsequently occurring passages
# Contradictions in Biblical passages may be removed through the mediation of other passages.

[[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and many other [[Jews]] do not believe that the revealed [[Torah]] consists solely of its written contents, but of its interpretations as well. The study of [[Torah]] (in its widest sense, to include both poetry, narrative, and law, and both the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]] and the [[Talmud]]) is in Judaism itself a sacred act of central importance. For the sages of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]], and for their successors today, the study of Torah was therefore not merely a means to learn the contents of God's revelation, but an end in itself. According to the [[Talmud]],
:These are the things for which a person enjoys the dividends in this world while the principal remains for the person to enjoy in the world to come; they are: honoring parents, loving deeds of kindness, and making peace between one person and another. But the study of the Torah is equal to them all. (Talmud Shabbat 127a).
In Judaism, "the study of [[Torah]] can be a means of experiencing God".&lt;ref name="publishing3" /&gt; Reflecting on the contribution of the [[Amoraim]] and [[Tanaim]] to contemporary Judaism, Professor Jacob Neusner observed:
:The rabbi's logical and rational inquiry is not mere logic-chopping. It is a most serious and substantive effort to locate in trivialities the fundamental principles of the revealed will of God to guide and sanctify the most specific and concrete actions in the workaday world .... Here is the mystery of Talmudic Judaism: the alien and remote conviction that the intellect is an instrument not of unbelief and desacralization but of sanctification."&lt;ref name="invitation" /&gt;
To study the Written Torah and the Oral Torah in light of each other is thus also to study ''how'' to study the word of God.

In the study of Torah, the sages formulated and followed various [[logic]]al and [[hermeneutics|hermeneutical]] principles. According to David Stern, all Rabbinic hermeneutics rest on two basic axioms:
:first, the belief in the omni-significance of Scripture, in the meaningfulness of its every word, letter, even (according to one famous report) scribal flourish; second, the claim of the essential unity of Scripture as the expression of the single divine will.&lt;ref name="indeterminacy" /&gt;
These two principles make possible a great variety of interpretations. According to the Talmud,
:A single verse has several meanings, but no two verses hold the same meaning. It was taught in the school of R. Ishmael: 'Behold, My word is like fire—declares the Lord—and like a hammer that shatters rock' (Jer 23:29). Just as this hammer produces many sparks (when it strikes the rock), so a single verse has several meanings." (Talmud Sanhedrin 34a).
Observant Jews thus view the Torah as dynamic, because it contains within it a host of interpretations&lt;ref name="indeterminacy4" /&gt;

According to Rabbinic tradition, all valid interpretations of the [[written Torah]] were revealed to Moses at Sinai in [[oral Torah|oral form]], and handed down from teacher to pupil (The oral revelation is in effect coextensive with the Talmud itself). When different rabbis forwarded conflicting interpretations, they sometimes appealed to hermeneutic principles to legitimize their arguments; some rabbis claim that these principles were themselves revealed by God to Moses at Sinai.&lt;ref name="indeterminacy5" /&gt;

Thus, [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] called attention to seven commonly used hermeneutical principles in the interpretation of laws ([[baraita]] at the beginning of [[Sifra]]); [[R. Ishmael]], thirteen (baraita at the beginning of Sifra; this collection is largely an amplification of that of Hillel).&lt;ref name="introduction" /&gt; [[Eliezer b. Jose ha-Gelili]] listed 32, largely used for the exegesis of narrative elements of Torah. All the hermeneutic rules scattered through the [[Talmudim]] and [[Midrashim]] have been collected by [[Malbim]] in ''Ayyelet ha-Shachar'', the introduction to his commentary on the [[Sifra]]. Nevertheless, R. Ishmael's 13 principles are perhaps the ones most widely known; they constitute an important, and one of Judaism's earliest, contributions to [[logic]], [[hermeneutics]], and [[jurisprudence]].&lt;ref name="introduction6" /&gt; [[Judah Hadassi]] incorporated Ishmael's principles into [[Karaite Judaism]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref name="introduction7" /&gt; Today R. Ishmael's 13 principles are incorporated into the Jewish prayer book to be read by observant Jews on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="jerusalem" /&gt;&lt;ref name="congregations" /&gt;&lt;ref name="publications" /&gt;&lt;ref name="publication" /&gt;

==Jewish identity==
===Origin of the term "Judaism"===
[[File:Macedonian Mezuzah.jpg|right|thumb|A [[mezuzah]] case]]

The term "Judaism" derives from ''Iudaismus'', a Latinized form of the Ancient Greek ''[[Ioudaismos]]'' (Ἰουδαϊσμός) (from the verb {{lang|grc|ἰουδαΐζειν}}, "to side with or imitate the [Judeans]").&lt;ref name="LSJverb"&gt;{{LSJ|*)ioudai/zw|ἰουδαΐζειν|ref|mLSJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its ultimate source was the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] יהודה, ''Yehudah'', "[[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]]",&lt;ref name="bibleinterp_mason3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="askoxford8" /&gt; which is also the source of the Hebrew term for Judaism: יַהֲדוּת, ''Yahadut''. The term ''Ἰουδαϊσμός'' first appears in the [[Hellenistic Greek]] book of [[2 Maccabees]] in the 2nd century BCE. In the context of the age and period it meant "seeking or forming part of a cultural entity"&lt;ref name=influence /&gt; and it resembled its antonym ''[[hellenismos]]'', a word that signified a people's submission to [[Hellenistic period|Hellenic]] ([[Ancient Greece|Greek]]) cultural norms. The conflict between ''iudaismos'' and ''hellenismos'' lay behind the [[Maccabean revolt]] and hence the invention of the term ''iudaismos''.&lt;ref name=influence&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2q6qTb-A7GwC&amp;pg=RA1-PA39 |first=Oskar |last=Skarsaune |authorlink=Oskar Skarsaune | title=In the Shadow of the Temple: Jewish Influences on Early Christianity|publisher=InterVarsity Press|pages=39ff. |accessdate=22 August 2010|isbn=978-0-8308-2670-4|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shaye J. D. Cohen]] writes in his book ''The Beginnings of Jewishness'':

{{quote|We are tempted, of course, to translate [''Ioudaïsmós''] as "Judaism," but this translation is too narrow, because in this first occurrence of the term, ''Ioudaïsmós'' has not yet been reduced to the designation of a religion. It means rather "the aggregate of all those characteristics that makes Judaeans Judaean (or Jews Jewish)." Among these characteristics, to be sure, are practices and beliefs that we would today call "religious," but these practices and beliefs are not the sole content of the term. Thus ''Ioudaïsmós'' should be translated not as "Judaism" but as Judaeanness.&lt;ref&gt;Shaye J.D. Cohen 1999 ''The Beginnings of Jewishness: Boundaries, Varieties, Uncertainties'' University of California Press. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' the earliest citation in English where the term was used to mean "the profession or practice of the Jewish religion; the religious system or polity of the Jews" is Robert Fabyan's ''The newe cronycles of Englande and of Fraunce'' (1516).&lt;ref&gt;"He anon renouncyd his Iudaisme or Moysen Lawe, And was cristenyd, and lyued after as a Cristen Man." (Robert Fabian, ''New Chronicles of England and France'', reprint London 1811, p. 334.)&lt;/ref&gt; "Judaism" as a direct translation of the Latin ''Iudaismus'' first occurred in a 1611 English translation of the [[Biblical apocrypha|apocrypha]] ([[Deuterocanon]] in [[Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodoxy]]), 2 Macc. ii. 21: "Those that behaved themselves manfully to their honour for Iudaisme."&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt;

===Distinction between Jews as a people and Judaism===
According to [[Daniel Boyarin]], the underlying distinction between religion and ethnicity is foreign to Judaism itself, and is one form of the dualism between spirit and flesh that has its origin in [[Plato]]nic philosophy and that permeated [[Hellenistic Judaism]].&lt;ref name="A radical Jew: Paul and the politics of identity" /&gt; Consequently, in his view, Judaism does not fit easily into conventional Western categories, such as religion, ethnicity, or culture. Boyarin suggests that this in part reflects the fact that much of Judaism's more than 3,000-year history predates the rise of Western culture and occurred outside the West (that is, Europe, particularly medieval and modern Europe). During this time, Jews experienced slavery, anarchic and theocratic self-government, conquest, occupation, and exile. In the Diaspora, they were in contact with, and influenced by, ancient Egyptian, Babylonian, Persian, and Hellenic cultures, as well as modern movements such as the Enlightenment (see [[Haskalah]]) and the rise of nationalism, which would bear fruit in the form of a Jewish state in their ancient homeland, the [[Land of Israel]]. They also saw an elite population convert to Judaism (the [[Khazar]]s), only to disappear as the centers of power in the lands once occupied by that elite fell to the people of Rus and then the Mongols.{{citation needed | reason= Boyarin does not say anything about Khazars is this synthesis?|date=April 2015}} Thus, Boyarin has argued that "Jewishness disrupts the very categories of identity, because it is not national, not genealogical, not religious, but all of these, in dialectical tension."&lt;ref name="A radical Jew: Paul and the politics of identity10" /&gt;

In contrast to this point of view, practices such as [[Humanistic Judaism]] reject the religious aspects of Judaism, while retaining certain cultural traditions.

===Who is a Jew?===
{{Main article|Who is a Jew?}}

According to [[Rabbinic Judaism]], a Jew is anyone who was either born of a Jewish mother or who [[Conversion to Judaism|converted to Judaism]] in accordance with Jewish Law. [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] and the larger denominations of worldwide [[Reform Judaism|Progressive Judaism]] (also known as Liberal or Reform Judaism) accept the child as Jewish if one of the parents is Jewish, if the parents raise the child with a Jewish identity, but not the smaller regional branches.{{Clarify|date=December 2015}} All mainstream forms of Judaism today are open to sincere converts, although conversion has traditionally been discouraged since the time of the Talmud. The conversion process is evaluated by an authority, and the convert is examined on his or her sincerity and knowledge.&lt;ref name="Who is a Jew?" /&gt; Converts are called "ben Abraham" or "bat Abraham", (son or daughter of Abraham). Conversions have on occasion been overturned. In 2008, Israel's highest religious court invalidated the conversion of 40,000 Jews, mostly from Russian immigrant families, even though they had been approved by an Orthodox rabbi.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel G. Freedman, [https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/07/us/strains-grow-between-israel-and-many-jews-in-the-us.html "Strains Grow Between Israel and Many Jews in the U.S."] ''[[The New York Times]]'', 6 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Rabbinical Judaism maintains that a Jew, whether by birth or conversion, is a Jew forever. Thus a Jew who claims to be an atheist or converts to another religion is still considered by traditional Judaism to be Jewish. According to some sources, the Reform movement has maintained that a Jew who has converted to another religion is no longer a Jew,&lt;ref name="faqs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="university" /&gt; and the Israeli Government has also taken that stance after Supreme Court cases and statutes.&lt;ref name="Law of Return 5710-1950" /&gt; However, the Reform movement has indicated that this is not so cut and dried, and different situations call for consideration and differing actions. For example, Jews who have converted under duress may be permitted to return to Judaism "without any action on their part but their desire to rejoin the Jewish community" and "A proselyte who has become an apostate remains, nevertheless, a Jew".&lt;ref name="Jacob, Walter (1987). Contemporary American Reform Responsa. Mars, PA: Publishers Choice Book Mfg." /&gt;

[[Karaite Judaism]] believes that Jewish identity can only be transmitted by patrilineal descent. Although a minority of modern Karaites believe that Jewish identity requires that both parents be Jewish, and not only the father. They argue that only patrilineal descent can transmit Jewish identity on the grounds that all descent in the Torah went according to the male line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karaite-korner.org/karaite_faq.shtml|title=Karaite FAQ: Frequently Asked Questions About Karaism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question of what determines Jewish identity in the State of Israel was given new impetus when, in the 1950s, [[David Ben-Gurion]] requested opinions on ''mihu Yehudi'' ("Who is a Jew") from Jewish religious authorities and intellectuals worldwide in order to settle citizenship questions. This is still not settled, and occasionally resurfaces in [[Politics of Israel|Israeli politics]].

Historical definitions of [[Jewish identity]] have traditionally been based on ''[[halakha|halakhic]]'' definitions of matrilineal descent, and halakhic conversions. Historical definitions of who is a Jew date back to the codification of the [[Oral Torah]] into the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]], around 200 [[Common Era|CE]]. Interpretations of sections of the Tanakh, such as [[Book of Deuteronomy|Deuteronomy]] 7:1–5, by Jewish sages, are used as a warning against [[Interfaith marriage in Judaism|intermarriage]] between Jews and [[Canaanites]] because "[the non-Jewish husband] will cause your child to turn away from Me and they will worship the gods (i.e., idols) of others." {{bibleref2|Leviticus|24:10}} says that the son in a marriage between a Hebrew woman and an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] man is "of the community of Israel." This is complemented by {{bibleref2|Ezra|10:2–3}}, where Israelites returning from Babylon vow to put aside their [[gentile]] wives and their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/10-11.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961018024300/http://shamash.org/lists/scj-faq/HTML/faq/10-11.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 October 1996|title=What is the origin of Matrilineal Descent?|accessdate=9 January 2009|date=4 September 2003|publisher=Shamash.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torah.org/qanda/seequanda.php?id=318 |title=What is the source of the law that a child is Jewish only if its mother is Jewish? |accessdate=9 January 2009 |publisher=Torah.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224205847/http://www.torah.org/qanda/seequanda.php?id=318 |archivedate=24 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A popular theory is that the rape of Jewish women in captivity brought about the law of Jewish identity being inherited through the maternal line, although scholars challenge this theory citing the Talmudic establishment of the law from the pre-exile period.&lt;ref name="Klein2016"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0BC_DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA6|title=Lost Jews: The Struggle for Identity Today|author=Emma Klein|date=27 July 2016|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-349-24319-8|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schott2010"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6iFx-wHhMJMC&amp;pg=PA67|title=Birth, Death, and Femininity: Philosophies of Embodiment|author=Robin May Schott|date=25 October 2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-253-00482-9|pages=67–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the anti-religious ''[[Haskalah]]'' movement of the late 18th and 19th centuries, ''halakhic'' interpretations of Jewish identity have been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;Dosick (2007), pp. 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish demographics===
{{Main|Jewish population by country}}

The total number of Jews worldwide is difficult to assess because the definition of "who is a Jew" is problematic; not all Jews identify themselves as Jewish, and some who identify as Jewish are not considered so by other Jews. According to the ''Jewish Year Book'' (1901), the global Jewish population in 1900 was around 11 million. The latest available data is from the World Jewish Population Survey of 2002 and the Jewish Year Calendar (2005). In 2002, according to the Jewish Population Survey, there were 13.3&amp;nbsp;million Jews around the world. The Jewish Year Calendar cites 14.6&amp;nbsp;million. Jewish population growth is currently near zero percent, with 0.3% growth from 2000 to 2001.

==Jewish religious movements==
{{Main article|Jewish religious movements}}

===Rabbinic Judaism===
Rabbinic Judaism (or in some Christian traditions, Rabbinism) (Hebrew: "Yahadut Rabanit" – יהדות רבנית) has been the mainstream form of Judaism since the 6th century CE, after the codification of the [[Talmud]]. It is characterised by the belief that the [[Written Torah]] (Written Law) cannot be correctly interpreted without reference to the [[Oral Torah]] and the voluminous literature specifying what behavior is sanctioned by the [[halakha|Law]].

The [[Jewish Enlightenment]] of the late 18th century resulted in the division of [[Ashkenazi]] (Western) Jewry into religious movements or denominations, especially in North America and Anglophone countries. The main denominations today outside Israel (where the situation is rather different) are Orthodox, Conservative, and Reform.
* [[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that both the Written and [[Oral Torah]] were divinely revealed to [[Moses]] and that the laws within it are binding and unchanging. Orthodox Jews generally consider commentaries on the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]'' (a condensed codification of halakha that largely favored Sephardic traditions) to be the definitive codification of Jewish law. Orthodoxy places a high importance on [[13 Principles of Faith|Maimonides' 13 principles]] as a definition of Jewish faith.
:* Orthodoxy is often divided into [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Haredi Judaism]]. [[Haredi Judaism]] is less accommodating to modernity and has less interest in non-Jewish disciplines, and it may be distinguished from [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] in practice by its styles of dress and more stringent practices. Subsets of [[Haredi Judaism]] include [[Hasidic Judaism]], which is rooted in the [[Kabbalah]] and distinguished by reliance on a [[Rebbe]] or religious teacher; and [[Sephardic Haredi]] Judaism, which emerged among [[Sephardic]] (Asian and North African) Jews in Israel.
* [[Conservative Judaism]] is characterized by a commitment to traditional Jewish laws and customs, including observance of [[Shabbat]] and [[kashrut]], a deliberately non-fundamentalist teaching of Jewish principles of faith, a positive attitude toward modern culture, and an acceptance of both traditional rabbinic and modern scholarship when considering Jewish religious texts. Conservative Judaism teaches that Jewish law is not static, but has always developed in response to changing conditions. It holds that the Torah is a divine document written by prophets inspired by God and reflecting his will, but rejects the Orthodox position that it was dictated by God to Moses.&lt;ref name="Torah MiSinai:Conservative Views" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Conservative Judaism" /&gt; Conservative Judaism holds that the [[oral Torah|Oral Law]] is divine and normative, but holds that both the Written and Oral Law may be interpreted by the rabbis to reflect modern sensibilities and suit modern conditions.
* [[Reform Judaism]], called Liberal or Progressive Judaism in many countries, defines Judaism in relatively universalist terms, rejects most of the ritual and ceremonial laws of the [[Torah]] while observing moral laws, and emphasizes the ethical call of the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]]. Reform Judaism has developed an egalitarian prayer service in the vernacular (along with [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in many cases) and emphasizes personal connection to Jewish tradition.

* [[Reconstructionist Judaism]], like Reform Judaism, does not hold that Jewish law, as such, requires observance, but unlike Reform, Reconstructionist thought emphasizes the role of the community in deciding what observances to follow.
* [[Jewish Renewal]] is a recent North American movement which focuses on spirituality and social justice but does not address issues of Jewish law. Men and women participate equally in prayer.
* [[Humanistic Judaism]] is a small non-theistic movement centered in North America and Israel that emphasizes Jewish culture and history as the sources of Jewish identity.

====Sephardi and Mizrahi Judaism====
While [[Minhag|traditions and customs]] (see also "[[Sephardic law and customs]]") vary between discrete communities, it can be said that [[Sephardi]] and [[Mizrahi]] Jewish communities do not generally adhere to the "movement" framework popular in and among [[Ashkenazi]] Jewry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Elazar|first1=Daniel|title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed?|url=http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm|website=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, Sephardi and Mizrahi communities have eschewed denominations in favour of a "big tent" approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jager|first1=Elliot|title=Sephardi Judaism Straining to Stay Non-Denominational|url=https://www.jpost.com/Jerusalem-Report/Sephardi-Judaism-Straining-to-Stay-Non-Denominational-513181|website=Jerusalem Post|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly the case in contemporary [[State of israel|Israel]], which is home to the largest communities of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews in the world. (However, individual Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews may be members of or attend synagogues that do adhere to one Ashkenazi-inflected movement or another.) 

Sephardi and Mizrahi observance of Judaism tends toward the conservative, and [[Nusach#Sephardi_and_Mizrachi_nuschaot|prayer rites]] are reflective of this, with the text of each rite being largely unchanged since their respective inception. Observant Sephardim may follow the teachings of a particular rabbi or school of thought; for example, the Sephardic [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel|Chief Rabbi of Israel]].

====Jewish movements in Israel====
{{Main article|Religion in Israel}}
Most Jewish Israelis classify themselves as "secular" (''hiloni''), [[Masortim|"traditional" (''masorti'')]], "religious" (''dati'') or ''[[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]]''. The term "secular" is more popular as a self-description among Israeli families of western (European) origin, whose Jewish identity may be a very powerful force in their lives, but who see it as largely independent of traditional religious belief and practice. This portion of the population largely ignores organized religious life, be it of the official Israeli rabbinate (Orthodox) or of the liberal movements common to diaspora Judaism (Reform, Conservative).

The term "traditional" (''masorti'') is most common as a self-description among Israeli families of "eastern" origin (i.e., the Middle East, Central Asia, and North Africa). This term, as commonly used, has nothing to do with the [[Conservative Judaism]], which also names itself "Masorti" outside North America. There is a great deal of ambiguity in the ways "secular" and "traditional" are used in Israel: they often overlap, and they cover an extremely wide range in terms of worldview and practical religious observance. The term "Orthodox" is not popular in Israeli discourse, although the percentage of Jews who come under that category is far greater than in the [[Jewish Diaspora|diaspora]]. What would be called "Orthodox" in the diaspora includes what is commonly called ''dati'' (religious) or ''haredi'' (ultra-Orthodox) in Israel. The former term includes what is called "[[Religious Zionism]]" or the "National Religious" community, as well as what has become known over the past decade or so as ''haredi-leumi'' ([[nationalism|nationalist]] ''haredi''), or "Hardal", which combines a largely ''haredi'' lifestyle with nationalist ideology. (Some people, in [[Yiddish]], also refer to observant Orthodox Jews as ''frum'', as opposed to ''frei'' (more liberal Jews)).

''Haredi'' applies to a populace that can be roughly divided into three separate groups along both ethnic and ideological lines: (1) "Lithuanian" (non-hasidic) ''haredim'' of [[Ashkenazim|Ashkenazic]] origin; (2) Hasidic ''haredim'' of Ashkenazic origin; and (3) [[Sephardim|Sephardic]] ''haredim''.

===Karaites and Samaritans===
[[Karaite Judaism]] defines itself as the remnants of the non-Rabbinic Jewish sects of the [[Second Temple]] period, such as the [[Sadducees]]. The Karaites ("Scripturalists") accept only the Hebrew Bible and what they view as the [[Peshat]] ("simple" meaning); they do not accept non-biblical writings as authoritative. Some European Karaites do not see themselves as part of the Jewish community at all, although most do.

The [[Samaritan]]s, a very small community located entirely around [[Mount Gerizim]] in the [[Nablus]]/[[Shechem]] region of the [[West Bank]] and in [[Holon]], near [[Tel Aviv]] in Israel, regard themselves as the descendants of the Israelites of the Iron Age [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|kingdom of Israel]]. Their religious practices are based on the literal text of the written [[Torah]] (Five Books of Moses), which they view as the only authoritative scripture (with a special regard also for the [[Book of Joshua (Samaritan)|Samaritan Book of Joshua]]).

===Haymanot (Ethiopian Judaism)===
''See also: [[Haymanot]]; [[Beta Israel]].''

Haymanot (meaning "religion" in Ge'ez and Amharic) refers the Judaism practiced by Ethiopian Jews. This version of Judaism differs substantially from Rabbinic, Karaite, and Samaritan Judaisms, Ethiopian Jews having diverged from their coreligionists earlier. Sacred scriptures (the Orit) are written in Ge'ez, not Hebrew, and dietary laws are based strictly on the text of the Orit, without explication from ancillary commentaries. Holidays also differ, with some Rabbinic holidays not observed in Ethiopian Jewish communities, and some additional holidays, like [[Sigd]].

==Jewish observances==
===Jewish ethics===
{{Main article|Jewish ethics}}
Jewish ethics may be guided by [[halakhic]] traditions, by other moral principles, or by central Jewish virtues. Jewish ethical practice is typically understood to be marked by values such as justice, truth, peace, loving-kindness ([[chesed]]), compassion, humility, and self-respect. Specific Jewish ethical practices include practices of charity ([[tzedakah]]) and refraining from negative speech ([[lashon hara]]). Proper ethical practices regarding sexuality and many other issues are subjects of dispute among Jews.

===Prayers===
{{Main article|Jewish services}}
[[File:YemeniJew1914.jpg|thumbnail|upright=0.9|right|A Yemenite Jew at morning prayers, wearing a [[kippah]] skullcap, prayer shawl and [[tefillin]]]]
Traditionally, Jews recite prayers three times daily, [[Shacharit]], [[Mincha]], and [[Ma'ariv]] with a fourth prayer, [[Mussaf]] added on [[Shabbat]] and [[Jewish holiday|holidays]]. At the heart of each service is the ''[[Amidah]]'' or ''Shemoneh Esrei''. Another key prayer in many services is the declaration of faith, the ''[[Shema Yisrael]]'' (or ''Shema''). The ''Shema'' is the recitation of a verse from the Torah ([[Deuteronomy]] 6:4): ''Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu Adonai Echad''—"Hear, O Israel! The Lord is our God! The Lord is One!"

Most of the prayers in a traditional Jewish service can be recited in solitary prayer, although communal prayer is preferred. Communal prayer requires a [[quorum]] of ten adult Jews, called a ''[[minyan]]''. In nearly all Orthodox and a few Conservative circles, only male Jews are counted toward a ''minyan''; most Conservative Jews and members of other Jewish denominations count female Jews as well.

In addition to prayer services, observant traditional Jews recite [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings|prayers and benedictions]] throughout the day when [[List of Jewish prayers and blessings#Everyday prayers and blessings|performing various acts]]. Prayers are recited upon [[Modeh ani|waking up in the morning]], before eating or drinking different foods, [[Birkat Hamazon|after eating a meal]], and so on.

The approach to prayer varies among the Jewish denominations. Differences can include the texts of prayers, the frequency of prayer, the number of prayers recited at various religious events, the use of musical instruments and choral music, and whether prayers are recited in the traditional liturgical languages or the vernacular. In general, Orthodox and Conservative congregations adhere most closely to tradition, and Reform and Reconstructionist synagogues are more likely to incorporate translations and contemporary writings in their services. Also, in most Conservative synagogues, and all Reform and Reconstructionist congregations, women participate in prayer services on an [[Egalitarianism|equal basis]] with men, including roles traditionally filled only by men, such as [[Torah reading|reading from the Torah]]. In addition, many Reform temples use musical accompaniment such as organs and mixed choirs.

===Religious clothing===
{{Further|kippah|tzitzit|tefillin}}
A ''[[kippah]]'' (Hebrew: כִּפָּה, plural ''kippot''; Yiddish: יאַרמלקע, ''yarmulke'') is a slightly rounded brimless skullcap worn by many Jews while praying, eating, reciting blessings, or studying Jewish religious texts, and at all times by some Jewish men. In Orthodox communities, only men wear kippot; in non-Orthodox communities, some women also wear kippot. ''Kippot'' range in size from a small round beanie that covers only the back of the head to a large, snug cap that covers the whole crown.

''[[Tzitzit]]'' (Hebrew: צִיציִת) ([[Ashkenazi Hebrew|Ashkenazi pronunciation]]: ''tzitzis'') are special knotted "fringes" or "tassels" found on the four corners of the ''[[tallit]]'' (Hebrew: טַלִּית) (Ashkenazi pronunciation: ''tallis''), or prayer [[shawl]]. The ''tallit'' is worn by Jewish men and some Jewish women during the prayer service. Customs vary regarding when a Jew begins wearing a tallit. In the Sephardi community, boys wear a tallit from bar mitzvah age. In some Ashkenazi communities, it is customary to wear one only after marriage. A ''tallit katan'' (small tallit) is a fringed garment worn under the clothing throughout the day. In some Orthodox circles, the fringes are allowed to hang freely outside the clothing.

[[Tefillin]] (Hebrew: תְפִלִּין), known in English as phylacteries (from the Greek word φυλακτήριον, meaning ''safeguard'' or ''amulet''), are two square leather boxes containing biblical verses, attached to the forehead and wound around the left arm by leather straps. They are worn during weekday morning prayer by observant Jewish men and some Jewish women.&lt;ref name="publishers" /&gt;

A ''[[kittel]]'' (Yiddish: קיטל), a white knee-length overgarment, is worn by prayer leaders and some observant traditional Jews on the [[High Holidays]]. It is traditional for the head of the household to wear a kittel at the Passover seder in some communities, and some grooms wear one under the wedding canopy. Jewish males are buried in a ''tallit'' and sometimes also a ''kittel'' which are part of the ''[[tachrichim]]'' (burial garments).

===Jewish holidays===
{{Main article|Jewish holiday}}
Jewish holidays are special days in the Jewish calendar, which celebrate moments in Jewish history, as well as central themes in the relationship between God and the world, such as [[Creation myth|creation]], [[revelation]], and [[salvation|redemption]].

====Shabbat====
{{Main article|Shabbat}}

[[File:Shabbat Challos.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Two braided Shabbat [[challah]]s placed under an embroidered [[challah cover]] at the start of the Shabbat meal]]
''[[Shabbat]]'', the weekly day of rest lasting from shortly before sundown on Friday night to nightfall on Saturday night, commemorates God's day of rest after six days of creation.&lt;ref name="shabbat" /&gt; It plays a pivotal role in Jewish practice and is governed by a large corpus of religious law. At sundown on Friday, the woman of the house welcomes the Shabbat by lighting two or more candles and reciting a blessing. The evening meal begins with the Kiddush, a blessing recited aloud over a cup of wine, and the Mohtzi, a blessing recited over the bread. It is customary to have [[challah]], two braided loaves of bread, on the table. During Shabbat, Jews are forbidden to engage in any activity that falls under [[39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat|39 categories of ''melakhah'']], translated literally as "work". In fact the activities banned on the Sabbath are not "work" in the usual sense: They include such actions as lighting a fire, writing, using money and carrying in the public domain. The prohibition of lighting a fire has been extended in the modern era to driving a car, which involves burning fuel and using electricity.

====Three pilgrimage festivals====
{{Main article|Shalosh regalim}}

[[File:Jerusalemsukkas.jpg|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Some [[sukkah|sukkot]] in Jerusalem]]
Jewish holy days (''chaggim''), celebrate landmark events in Jewish history, such as the Exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Torah, and sometimes mark the change of seasons and transitions in the agricultural cycle. The three major festivals, Sukkot, Passover and Shavuot, are called "regalim" (derived from the Hebrew word "regel", or foot). On the three regalim, it was customary for the Israelites to make pilgrimages to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices in the Temple.
* [[Passover]] (''Pesach'') is a week-long holiday beginning on the evening of the 14th day of [[Nisan]] (the first month in the Hebrew calendar), that commemorates the [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt. Outside Israel, Passover is celebrated for eight days. In ancient times, it coincided with the barley harvest. It is the only holiday that centers on home-service, the [[Passover Seder|Seder]]. [[leavening agent|Leavened]] products ([[chametz]]) are removed from the house prior to the holiday and are not consumed throughout the week. Homes are thoroughly cleaned to ensure no bread or bread by-products remain, and a symbolic burning of the last vestiges of chametz is conducted on the morning of the Seder. [[Matzo]] is eaten instead of bread.
* [[Shavuot]] ("Pentecost" or "Feast of Weeks") celebrates the revelation of the [[Torah]] to the [[Israelite]]s on Mount Sinai. Also known as the Festival of Bikurim, or first fruits, it coincided in biblical times with the wheat harvest. Shavuot customs include all-night study marathons known as Tikkun Leil Shavuot, eating dairy foods (cheesecake and blintzes are special favorites), reading the Book of Ruth, decorating homes and synagogues with greenery, and wearing white clothing, symbolizing purity.
* [[Sukkot]] ("Tabernacles" or "The Festival of Booths") commemorates the Israelites' forty years of wandering through the desert on their way to the Promised Land. It is celebrated through the construction of temporary booths called ''sukkot'' (sing. ''[[sukkah]]'') that represent the temporary shelters of the Israelites during their wandering. It coincides with the fruit harvest and marks the end of the agricultural cycle. Jews around the world eat in ''sukkot'' for seven days and nights. Sukkot concludes with [[Shemini Atzeret]], where Jews begin to pray for rain and [[Simchat Torah]], "Rejoicing of the Torah", a holiday which marks reaching the end of the Torah reading cycle and beginning all over again. The occasion is celebrated with singing and dancing with the Torah scrolls. Shemini Atzeret and Simchat Torah are technically considered to be a separate holiday and not a part of Sukkot.

====High Holy Days====
[[File:Maurycy Gottlieb - Jews Praying in the Synagogue on Yom Kippur.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|''[[Yom Kippur]]'' by [[Maurycy Gottlieb]] (1878)]]
{{Main article|High Holidays}}
The High Holidays (''Yamim Noraim'' or "Days of Awe") revolve around judgment and forgiveness.
* [[Rosh Hashanah]], (also ''Yom Ha-Zikkaron'' or "Day of Remembrance", and ''Yom Teruah'', or "Day of the Sounding of the [[Shofar]]"). Rosh Hashanah is the Jewish New Year (literally, "head of the year"), although it falls on the first day of the seventh month of the [[Hebrew calendar]], [[Tishri]]. Rosh Hashanah marks the beginning of the 10-day period of atonement leading up to Yom Kippur, during which Jews are commanded to search their souls and make amends for sins committed, intentionally or not, throughout the year. Holiday customs include blowing the shofar, or ram's horn, in the synagogue, eating apples and honey, and saying blessings over a variety of symbolic foods, such as pomegranates.
* [[Yom Kippur]], ("Day of Atonement") is the holiest day of the Jewish year. It is a day of communal fasting and praying for forgiveness for one's sins. Observant Jews spend the entire day in the synagogue, sometimes with a short break in the afternoon, reciting prayers from a special holiday prayerbook called a "Machzor". Many non-religious Jews make a point of attending synagogue services and fasting on Yom Kippur. On the eve of Yom Kippur, before candles are lit, a prefast meal, the "seuda mafseket", is eaten. Synagogue services on the eve of Yom Kippur begin with the Kol Nidre prayer. It is customary to wear white on Yom Kippur, especially for Kol Nidre, and leather shoes are not worn. The following day, prayers are held from morning to evening. The final prayer service, called "Ne'ilah", ends with a long blast of the shofar.

====Purim====
{{Main article|Purim}}
[[File:Jerusalem Purim street scene.jpg|right|thumb|Purim street scene in Jerusalem]]
[[File:Présentation de la Loi, Edouard Moyse (1860) - Musée d'art et d'histoire du Judaïsme.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Torah]] reading, France, 1860 [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]
[[Purim]] ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]: {{Audio|He-Purim.ogg|פורים}} ''Pûrîm'' "[[Cleromancy|lots]]") is a joyous Jewish holiday that commemorates the deliverance of the [[Persian Jews]] from the plot of the evil [[Haman (Bible)|Haman]], who sought to [[genocide|exterminate]] them, as recorded in the biblical [[Book of Esther]]. It is characterized by public recitation of the Book of Esther, mutual gifts of food and drink, [[Alms|charity]] to the poor, and a celebratory meal (Esther 9:22). Other customs include drinking wine, eating special pastries called [[hamantash]]en, dressing up in masks and costumes, and organizing carnivals and parties.

Purim has celebrated annually on the 14th of the Hebrew month of [[Adar]], which occurs in February or March of the Gregorian calendar.

====Hanukkah====
{{Main article|Hanukkah}}

[[Hanukkah]] ({{lang-he|חֲנֻכָּה}}, "dedication") also known as the Festival of Lights, is an eight-day Jewish holiday that starts on the 25th day of [[Kislev]] ([[Hebrew calendar]]). The festival is observed in Jewish homes by the kindling of lights on each of the festival's eight nights, one on the first night, two on the second night and so on.

The holiday was called Hanukkah (meaning "dedication") because it marks the re-dedication of the Temple after its desecration by [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes]]. Spiritually, Hanukkah commemorates the "Miracle of the Oil". According to the Talmud, at the re-dedication of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] following the victory of the [[Maccabees]] over the [[Seleucid Empire]], there was only enough consecrated [[oil]] to fuel the eternal flame in the Temple for one day. Miraculously, the oil burned for eight days – which was the length of time it took to press, prepare and consecrate new oil.

Hanukkah is not mentioned in the Bible and was never considered a major holiday in Judaism, but it has become much more visible and widely celebrated in modern times, mainly because it falls around the same time as Christmas and has national Jewish overtones that have been emphasized since the establishment of the State of Israel.

====Fast days====
{{Main article|Tisha B'Av|Seventeenth of Tamuz|10th of Tevet|Tzom Gedaliah}}
[[Tisha B'Av]] ({{lang-he|תשעה באב}} or {{lang|he|ט׳ באב}}, "the Ninth of [[Av (month)|Av]]") is a day of mourning and fasting commemorating the destruction of the [[First Temple|First]] and [[Second Temple]]s, and in later times, the [[Alhambra Decree|expulsion of the Jews from Spain]].

There are three more minor Jewish fast days that commemorate various stages of the destruction of the Temples. They are the [[Seventeenth of Tamuz|17th Tamuz]], the [[10th of Tevet]] and [[Tzom Gedaliah]] (the 3rd of Tishrei).

====Israeli holidays====
{{Main article|Yom Hashoah|Yom Hazikaron|Yom Ha'atzmaut}}
The modern holidays of [[Yom Ha-shoah]] (Holocaust Remembrance Day), [[Yom Hazikaron]] (Israeli Memorial Day) and [[Yom Ha'atzmaut]] (Israeli Independence Day) commemorate the horrors of the [[Holocaust]], the fallen soldiers of Israel and victims of terrorism, and Israeli independence, respectively.

There are some who prefer to commemorate those who were killed in the Holocaust on the [[Tenth of Tevet#Day of general kaddish|10th of Tevet]].

===Torah readings===
{{Main article|Torah reading}}
The core of festival and [[Shabbat]] prayer services is the public reading of the [[Torah]], along with connected readings from the other books of the [[Tanakh]], called [[Haftarah]]. Over the course of a year, the whole Torah is read, with the cycle starting over in the autumn, on [[Simchat Torah]].

===Synagogues and religious buildings===
{{Main article|Synagogue}}
[[File:Belz World Center Inside.jpg|right|thumb|Interior of the [[Belz Great Synagogue]] in Jerusalem.]]

Synagogues are Jewish houses of prayer and study. They usually contain separate rooms for prayer (the main sanctuary), smaller rooms for study, and often an area for community or educational use. There is no set blueprint for synagogues and the architectural shapes and interior designs of synagogues vary greatly. The Reform movement mostly refer to their synagogues as temples. Some traditional features of a synagogue are:
* The [[ark (synagogue)|ark]] (called ''aron ha-kodesh'' by [[Ashkenazi Jews|Ashkenazim]] and ''hekhal'' by [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardim]]) where the [[Torah]] scrolls are kept (the ark is often closed with an ornate curtain (''[[parochet]]'') outside or inside the ark doors);
* The elevated reader's platform (called ''[[Bema#Judaism|bimah]]'' by Ashkenazim and ''tebah'' by Sephardim), where the Torah is read (and services are conducted in Sephardi synagogues);
* The [[sanctuary lamp|eternal light]] (''ner tamid''), a continually lit lamp or lantern used as a reminder of the constantly lit [[Menorah (Temple)|menorah]] of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]]
* The pulpit, or ''amud'', a lectern facing the Ark where the [[hazzan]] or prayer leader stands while praying.

In addition to synagogues, other buildings of significance in Judaism include [[yeshiva]]s, or institutions of Jewish learning, and [[mikvah]]s, which are ritual baths.

===Dietary laws: ''kashrut''===
{{Main article|Kashrut}}

The Jewish dietary laws are known as ''[[kashrut]]''. Food prepared in accordance with them is termed [[kosher foods|kosher]], and food that is not kosher is also known as ''treifah'' or ''treif''. People who observe these laws are colloquially said to be "keeping kosher".&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt;

Many of the laws apply to animal-based foods. For example, in order to be considered kosher, [[mammals]] must have split [[hooves]] and [[ruminants|chew their cud]]. The [[pig]] is arguably the most well-known example of a non-kosher animal.&lt;ref name="The Kosher Pig?" /&gt; Although it has split hooves, it does not chew its cud.&lt;ref name="Tamar Levy, St. Louis, MO – Block Yeshiva High School, Grade 9" /&gt; For [[seafood]] to be kosher, the animal must have [[fins]] and [[Scale (zoology)|scales]]. Certain types of seafood, such as [[shellfish]], [[crustaceans]], and [[eel]]s, are therefore considered non-kosher. Concerning birds, a list of non-kosher species is given in the [[Torah]]. The exact [[translations]] of many of the species have not survived, and some non-kosher birds' identities are no longer certain. However, [[traditions]] exist about the ''kashrut'' status of a few birds. For example, both [[chickens]] and [[turkeys]] are permitted in most communities. Other types of animals, such as [[amphibians]], [[reptiles]], and most [[insects]], are prohibited altogether.&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt;

In addition to the requirement that the species be considered kosher, meat and poultry (but not fish) must come from a healthy animal slaughtered in a process known as ''[[shechitah]]''. Without the proper [[Animal slaughter|slaughtering]] practices even an otherwise kosher animal will be rendered ''treif''. The slaughtering process is intended to be quick and relatively painless to the animal. Forbidden parts of animals include the [[blood]], some [[fat]]s, and the area in and around the [[sciatic nerve]].&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt;

Jewish law also forbids the consumption of meat and dairy products together. The waiting period between eating meat and eating dairy varies by the order in which they are consumed and by community, and can extend for up to six hours. Based on the Biblical injunction against cooking a kid in its mother's milk, this rule is mostly derived from the [[Oral Torah]], the [[Talmud]] and [[Rabbinic law]].&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt; Chicken and other kosher birds are considered the same as meat under the laws of ''kashrut'', but the prohibition is Rabbinic, not Biblical.&lt;ref name="shulchan" /&gt;

The use of [[Dishware|dishes]], serving utensils, and [[oven]]s may make food ''treif'' that would otherwise be kosher. Utensils that have been used to prepare non-kosher food, or dishes that have held meat and are now used for dairy products, render the food ''treif'' under certain conditions.&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt;

Furthermore, all [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] and some [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] authorities forbid the consumption of processed [[grape]] products made by non-Jews, due to ancient [[pagan]] practices of using wine in rituals.&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt; Some Conservative authorities permit wine and grape juice made without rabbinic supervision.&lt;ref name="rabbinicalassembly" /&gt;

The [[Torah]] does not give specific reasons for most of the laws of ''kashrut''.&lt;ref name="JewFAQ Kashrut" /&gt; However, a number of explanations have been offered, including maintaining ritual purity, teaching impulse control, encouraging obedience to God, improving health, reducing [[cruelty to animals]] and preserving the distinctness of the Jewish community.&lt;ref name="Kashrut Facts" /&gt; The various categories of dietary laws may have developed for different reasons, and some may exist for multiple reasons. For example, people are forbidden from consuming the blood of birds and mammals because, according to the Torah, this is where animal souls are contained.&lt;ref name="Judaism 101: Kashrut: Jewish Dietary Laws" /&gt; In contrast, the Torah forbids Israelites from eating non-kosher species because "they are unclean".&lt;ref name="leviticus11" /&gt; The [[Kabbalah]] describes sparks of holiness that are released by the act of eating kosher foods, but are too tightly bound in non-kosher foods to be released by eating.&lt;ref name="Judaism and the Art of Eating" /&gt;

Survival concerns supersede all the laws of ''kashrut'', as they do for most [[halakha|halakhot]].&lt;ref name="jewishmag" /&gt;&lt;ref name="biu" /&gt;

===Laws of ritual purity===
{{Main article|Tumah}}
[[File:Шабатна кибритна кутија - Shabbat matchbox holder.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.15|A silver matchbox holder for ritual use on [[Shabbat]] with inscription in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]]]
The [[Tanakh]] describes circumstances in which a person who is ''tahor'' or ritually pure may become ''tamei'' or ritually impure. Some of these circumstances are contact with human [[corpses]] or [[grave (burial)|graves]], seminal flux, vaginal flux, [[menstruation]], and contact with people who have become impure from any of these.&lt;ref name="leviticus15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bamidbar" /&gt; In Rabbinic Judaism, [[Kohanim]], members of the hereditary [[caste]] that served as [[priests]] in the time of the Temple, are mostly restricted from entering grave sites and touching dead bodies.&lt;ref name="Torah tidbits" /&gt; During the Temple period, such priests ([[Kohanim]]) were required to eat their bread offering ([[Terumah]]) in a state of ritual purity, which laws eventually led to more rigid laws being enacted, such as [[Handwashing in Judaism|hand-washing]] which became a requisite of all Jews before consuming ordinary bread.

====Family purity====
[[File:Fauteuil de circoncision ("Fauteuil d'Elie").jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|18th-century circumcision chair [[Musée d'Art et d'Histoire du Judaïsme|Museum of Jewish Art and History]]]]
{{Main article|Niddah}}

An important subcategory of the ritual purity laws relates to the segregation of menstruating [[women]]. These laws are also known as ''[[niddah]]'', literally "separation", or family purity. Vital aspects of halakha for traditionally observant Jews, they are not usually followed by Jews in liberal denominations.&lt;ref name="koshersex" /&gt;

Especially in [[Orthodox Judaism]], the Biblical laws are augmented by Rabbinical injunctions. For example, the [[Torah]] mandates that a woman in her normal menstrual period must abstain from [[sexual intercourse]] for seven days. A woman whose menstruation is prolonged must continue to abstain for seven more days after bleeding has stopped.&lt;ref name=leviticus15 /&gt; The Rabbis conflated ordinary ''niddah'' with this extended menstrual period, known in the Torah as ''[[zavah]]'', and mandated that a woman may not have sexual intercourse with her [[husband]] from the time she begins her [[Menstrual cycle|menstrual]] flow until seven days after it ends. In addition, [[Rabbinical law]] forbids the [[husband]] from touching or sharing a bed with his wife during this period. Afterwards, purification can occur in a ritual bath called a [[mikveh]].&lt;ref name=koshersex /&gt;

Traditional [[Ethiopian Jews]] keep menstruating women in separate [[huts]] and, similar to [[Karaite Judaism|Karaite practice]], do not allow menstruating women into their [[temples]] because of a temple's special sanctity. Emigration to [[Israel]] and the influence of other Jewish denominations have led to Ethiopian Jews adopting more normative Jewish practices.&lt;ref name="Karaites" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Women and water: menstruation in Jewish life and law" /&gt;

===Life-cycle events===
Life-cycle events, or [[rites of passage]], occur throughout a Jew's life that serves to strengthen Jewish identity and bind him/her to the entire community.
* [[Brit milah]]&amp;nbsp;– Welcoming male babies into the covenant through the rite of [[circumcision]] on their eighth day of life. The baby boy is also given his Hebrew name in the ceremony. A naming ceremony intended as a parallel ritual for girls, named ''[[zeved habat]]'' or brit bat, enjoys limited popularity.
* [[Bar Mitzvah / Bat Mitzvah|Bar mitzvah and Bat mitzvah]]&amp;nbsp;– This passage from childhood to adulthood takes place when a female Jew is twelve and a male Jew is thirteen years old among Orthodox and some Conservative congregations. In the Reform movement, both girls and boys have their bat/bar mitzvah at age thirteen. This is often commemorated by having the new adults, male only in the Orthodox tradition, lead the congregation in prayer and publicly read a "portion" of the Torah.
* [[Jewish views of marriage|Marriage]]&amp;nbsp;– Marriage is an extremely important lifecycle event. A wedding takes place under a ''[[chuppah]]'', or wedding canopy, which symbolizes a happy house. At the end of the ceremony, the groom breaks a glass with his foot, symbolizing the continuous mourning for the destruction of the Temple, and the scattering of the Jewish people.
* [[bereavement in Judaism|Death and Mourning]]&amp;nbsp;– Judaism has a multi-staged [[mourning]] practice. The first stage is called the [[shiva (Judaism)|shiva]] (literally "seven", observed for one week) during which it is traditional to sit at home and be comforted by friends and family, the second is the ''shloshim'' (observed for one month) and for those who have lost one of their parents, there is a third stage, ''avelut yud bet chodesh'', which is observed for eleven months.

==Community leadership==
===Classical priesthood===
[[File:Jewish Children with their Teacher in Samarkand.jpg|thumb|Jewish students with their teacher in [[Samarkand]], [[Uzbekistan]] c. 1910.]]
The role of the priesthood in Judaism has significantly diminished since the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE when priests attended to the Temple and sacrifices. The priesthood is an inherited position, and although priests no longer have any but ceremonial duties, they are still honored in many Jewish communities. Many Orthodox Jewish communities believe that they will be needed again for a future [[Third Temple]] and need to remain in readiness for future duty.
* [[Kohen]] (priest) – patrilineal descendant of [[Aaron]], brother of [[Moses]]. In the Temple, the ''kohanim'' were charged with performing the sacrifices. Today, a Kohen is the first one called up at the reading of the Torah, performs the [[Priestly Blessing]], as well as complying with other unique laws and ceremonies, including the ceremony of redemption of the first-born.
* Levi ([[Levite]]) – Patrilineal descendant of [[Levi]] the son of [[Jacob]]. In the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], the levites sang [[Psalms]], performed construction, maintenance, janitorial, and guard duties, assisted the priests, and sometimes interpreted the law and Temple ritual to the public. Today, a Levite is called up second to the reading of the Torah.

===Prayer leaders===
From the time of the [[Mishnah]] and [[Talmud]] to the present, Judaism has required specialists or authorities for the practice of very few rituals or ceremonies. A Jew can fulfill most requirements for prayer by himself. Some activities—reading the [[Torah]] and ''haftarah'' (a supplementary portion from the Prophets or Writings), the prayer for mourners, the blessings for bridegroom and bride, the complete grace after meals—require a ''[[minyan]]'', the presence of ten Jews.

The most common professional clergy in a [[synagogue]] are:
* [[Rabbi]] of a congregation – Jewish scholar who is charged with answering the legal questions of a congregation. This role requires ordination by the congregation's preferred authority (i.e., from a respected Orthodox rabbi or, if the congregation is Conservative or Reform, from academic seminaries). A congregation does not necessarily require a rabbi. Some congregations have a rabbi but also allow members of the congregation to act as ''shatz'' or ''baal kriyah'' (see below).
** Hassidic ''[[Rebbe]]'' – rabbi who is the head of a [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] dynasty.
* [[Hazzan]] (note: the "h" denotes [[voiceless pharyngeal fricative]]) (cantor) – a trained vocalist who acts as ''shatz''. Chosen for a good voice, knowledge of traditional tunes, understanding of the meaning of the prayers and sincerity in reciting them. A congregation does not need to have a dedicated hazzan.

Jewish prayer services do involve two specified roles, which are sometimes, but not always, filled by a rabbi or hazzan in many congregations. In other congregations these roles are filled on an ad-hoc basis by members of the congregation who lead portions of services on a rotating basis:
* Shaliach tzibur or ''Shatz'' (leader—literally "agent" or "representative"—of the congregation) leads those assembled in prayer and sometimes prays on behalf of the community. When a ''shatz'' recites a prayer on behalf of the congregation, he is ''not'' acting as an intermediary but rather as a facilitator. The entire congregation participates in the recital of such prayers by saying ''amen'' at their conclusion; it is with this act that the ''shatz's'' prayer becomes the prayer of the congregation. Any adult capable of reciting the prayers clearly may act as ''shatz''. In Orthodox congregations and some Conservative congregations, only men can be prayer leaders, but all [[Progressive Judaism|Progressive]] communities now allow women to serve in this function.
* The Baal kriyah or ''baal koreh'' (master of the reading) reads the weekly [[Torah]] portion. The requirements for being the ''baal kriyah'' are the same as those for the ''shatz''. These roles are not mutually exclusive. The same person is often qualified to fill more than one role and often does. Often there are several people capable of filling these roles and different services (or parts of services) will be led by each.

Many congregations, especially larger ones, also rely on a:
* [[Gabbai]] (sexton) – Calls people up to the Torah, appoints the ''shatz'' for each prayer session if there is no standard ''shatz'', and makes certain that the synagogue is kept clean and supplied.

The three preceding positions are usually voluntary and considered an honor. Since the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] large synagogues have often adopted the practice of hiring rabbis and hazzans to act as ''shatz'' and ''baal kriyah'', and this is still typically the case in many Conservative and Reform congregations. However, in most Orthodox synagogues these positions are filled by laypeople on a rotating or ad-hoc basis. Although most congregations hire one or more Rabbis, the use of a professional hazzan is generally declining in American congregations, and the use of professionals for other offices is rarer still.

===Specialized religious roles===
* ''[[Beth din#Officers of a beth din|Dayan]]'' (judge) – An ordained rabbi with special legal training who belongs to a ''[[beth din]]'' (rabbinical court). In Israel, religious courts handle marriage and divorce cases, conversion and financial disputes in the Jewish community.
* [[Mohel]] (circumciser) – An expert in the laws of circumcision who has received training from a previously qualified ''mohel'' and performs the ''[[brit milah]]'' (circumcision).
* [[shechita|Shochet]] (ritual slaughterer) – In order for meat to be kosher, it must be slaughtered by a ''shochet'' who is an expert in the laws of kashrut and has been trained by another ''shochet.''
* [[Sofer (scribe)|Sofer]] (scribe) – [[Torah]] scrolls, ''[[tefillin]]'' (phylacteries), ''[[mezuzah|mezuzot]]'' (scrolls put on doorposts), and ''gittin'' (bills of divorce) must be written by a ''sofer'' who is an expert in Hebrew calligraphy and has undergone rigorous training in the laws of writing sacred texts.
* [[Rosh yeshiva]] – A Torah scholar who runs a [[yeshiva]].
* [[Mashgiach ruchani|Mashgiach]] of a yeshiva – Depending on which yeshiva, might either be the person responsible for ensuring attendance and proper conduct, or even supervise the emotional and spiritual welfare of the students and give lectures on [[Mussar movement|mussar]] (Jewish ethics).
* [[Mashgiach]] – Supervises manufacturers of kosher food, importers, caterers and restaurants to ensure that the food is kosher. Must be an expert in the laws of [[kashrut]] and trained by a rabbi, if not a rabbi himself.

===Origins===

[[File:Duraeuropa-1-.gif|thumb|left|Scenes from the [[Book of Esther]] decorate the [[Dura-Europos synagogue]] dating from 244 CE]]
At its core, the Tanakh is an account of the [[Israelite]]s' relationship with [[God]] from their earliest history until the building of the [[Second Temple]] (c. 535 BCE). [[Abraham]] is hailed as the first [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] and the father of the Jewish people. As a reward for his act of faith in one God, he was promised that [[Isaac]], his second son, would inherit the [[Land of Israel]] (then called [[Canaan]]). Later, the descendants of Isaac's son [[Jacob]] were enslaved in [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], and God commanded [[Moses]] to lead [[the Exodus]] from Egypt. At [[Biblical Mount Sinai|Mount Sinai]], they received the [[Torah]]—the five books of Moses. These books, together with [[Nevi'im]] and [[Ketuvim]] are known as ''Torah Shebikhtav'' as opposed to the [[Oral Torah]], which refers to the Mishnah and the Talmud. Eventually, God led them to the [[land of Israel]] where the [[tabernacle]] was planted in the city of [[Shiloh (Biblical)|Shiloh]] for over 300 years to rally the nation against attacking enemies. As time went on, the spiritual level of the nation declined to the point that God allowed the [[Philistines]] to capture the tabernacle. The people of Israel then told [[Samuel (Bible)|Samuel]] the [[prophet]] that they needed to be governed by a permanent king, and Samuel appointed [[Saul the King|Saul]] to be their King. When the people pressured Saul into going against a command conveyed to him by Samuel, God told Samuel to appoint [[David]] in his stead.

[[File:Western wall jerusalem night.jpg|thumb|The [[Western Wall]] in [[Jerusalem]] is a remnant of the wall encircling the [[Second Temple]]. The [[Temple Mount]] is the holiest site in Judaism.]]

Once King David was established, he told the prophet [[Nathan (prophet)|Nathan]] that he would like to build a permanent temple, and as a reward for his actions, God promised David that he would allow his son, [[Solomon]], to build the [[Solomon's Temple|First Temple]] and the throne would never depart from his children.

Rabbinic tradition holds that the details and interpretation of the law, which are called the ''[[Oral Torah]]'' or ''[[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|oral law]]'', were originally an unwritten tradition based upon what God told Moses on Mount Sinai. However, as the persecutions of the Jews increased and the details were in danger of being forgotten, these oral laws were recorded by [[Rabbi]] [[Judah HaNasi]] (Judah the Prince) in the [[Mishnah]], redacted ''circa'' 200 CE. The [[Talmud]] was a compilation of both the Mishnah and the [[Gemara]], rabbinic commentaries redacted over the next three centuries. The Gemara originated in two major centers of Jewish scholarship, [[Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina|Palestine]] and [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Babylonia]].&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14213-talmud|title=Talmud|publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia|author=Wilhelm Bacher}}&lt;/ref&gt; Correspondingly, two bodies of analysis developed, and two works of Talmud were created. The older compilation is called the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. It was compiled sometime during the 4th century in [[Talmudic Academies in Syria Palaestina|Palestine]].&lt;ref name="jewishencyclopedia.com"/&gt; The Babylonian Talmud was compiled from discussions in the houses of study by the scholars [[Ravina I]], [[Ravina II]], and [[Rav Ashi]] by 500 CE, although it continued to be edited later.

Some critical scholars oppose the view that the sacred texts, including the [[Tanakh|Hebrew Bible]], were divinely inspired. Many of these scholars accept the general principles of the [[documentary hypothesis]] and suggest that the [[Torah]] consists of inconsistent texts edited together in a way that calls attention to divergent accounts.&lt;ref name="yehezkal" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name="biblical" /&gt;&lt;ref name="speiser" /&gt; Many suggest that during the First Temple period, the people of Israel believed that each nation had its own god, but that their god was superior to other gods.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;ref name="history12" /&gt;{{page needed|date=July 2017}} Some suggest that strict monotheism developed during the Babylonian Exile, perhaps in reaction to [[Zoroastrian]] dualism.&lt;ref name="ephraim" /&gt; In this view, it was only by the [[Hellenic period]] that most Jews came to believe that their god was the only god and that the notion of a clearly bounded Jewish nation identical with the Jewish religion formed.&lt;ref name="beginnings" /&gt;

[[John Day (Old Testament scholar)|John Day]] argues that the origins of biblical [[Yahweh]], [[El (deity)|El]], [[Asherah]], and [[Ba'al]], may be rooted in earlier [[Canaanite religion]], which was centered on a pantheon of gods much like the [[Greek pantheon]].&lt;ref name="goddesses" /&gt;

===Antiquity===
{{Main article|Ancient Israel and Judah|Babylonian captivity|Hellenistic Judaism|Hasmonean Kingdom|Iudaea Province|Bar Kokhba revolt}}

According to the [[Hebrew Bible]], the [[United Monarchy]] was established under [[Saul the King|Saul]] and continued under [[King David]] and [[Solomon]] with its capital in [[Jerusalem]]. After Solomon's reign, the nation split into two kingdoms, the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] (in the north) and the [[Kingdom of Judah]] (in the south). The Kingdom of Israel was conquered by the [[Assyria]]n ruler [[Sargon II]] in the late 8th century BCE with many people from the capital Samaria being taken captive to Media and the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]] valley. The [[Kingdom of Judah]] continued as an independent state until it was conquered by a Babylonian army in the early 6th century BCE, destroying the [[First Temple]] that was at the center of ancient Jewish worship. The Judean elite was exiled to [[Babylonia]] and this is regarded as the first Jewish Diaspora. Later many of them returned to their homeland after the subsequent conquest of Babylonia by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] seventy years later, a period known as the [[Babylonian Captivity]]. A new [[Second Temple]] was constructed, and old religious practices were resumed.

During the early years of the Second Temple, the highest religious authority was a council known as the Great Assembly, led by Ezra of the Book of Ezra. Among other accomplishments of the Great Assembly, the last books of the Bible were written at this time and the canon sealed.

[[Hellenistic Judaism]] spread to [[Ptolemaic Egypt]] from the 3rd century BCE. After [[First Jewish–Roman War|the Great Revolt]] (66–73 CE), the Romans destroyed the Temple. [[Hadrian]] built a pagan idol on the Temple grounds and prohibited circumcision; these acts of ethnocide provoked the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] 132–136 CE after which the Romans banned the study of the [[Torah]] and the celebration of Jewish holidays, and forcibly removed virtually all Jews from Judea. In 200 CE, however, Jews were granted Roman citizenship and Judaism was recognized as a ''[[religio licita]]'' ("legitimate religion") until the rise of [[Gnosticism]] and [[Early Christianity]] in the fourth century.

Following the destruction of Jerusalem and the expulsion of the Jews, Jewish worship stopped being centrally organized around the Temple, prayer took the place of sacrifice, and worship was rebuilt around the community (represented by a minimum of ten adult men) and the establishment of the authority of rabbis who acted as teachers and leaders of individual communities (see [[Jewish diaspora]]).

===Historical Jewish groupings (to 1700)===
[[File:Parochet of Beth Jakov Macedonia.jpg|thumb|The [[Torah Ark]] of the Beth Jakov synagogue in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]]]
Around the 1st century CE, there were several small Jewish sects: the [[Pharisees]], [[Sadducees]], [[Zealots]], [[Essenes]], and [[early Christianity|Christians]]. After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE, these sects vanished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sara E. Karesh|author2=Mitchell M. Hurvitz|title=Encyclopedia of Judaism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2cCZBDm8F8C&amp;pg=PA444|year=2005|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-6982-8|pages=444–|quote=The Sadducees disappeared when the second Temple was destroyed in the year 70 C.E and Pharisaic Judaism became the preeminent Jewish sect.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christianity]] survived, but by breaking with Judaism and [[Schism (religion)|becoming a separate religion]]; the [[Pharisees]] survived but in the form of [[Rabbinic Judaism]] (today, known simply as "Judaism"). The [[Sadducees]] rejected the [[Revelation|divine inspiration]] of the [[Nevi'im|Prophets]] and the [[Ketuvim|Writings]], relying only on the [[Torah]] as divinely inspired. Consequently, a number of other core tenets of the Pharisees' belief system (which became the basis for modern Judaism), were also dismissed by the Sadducees. (The [[Samaritans]] practiced a similar religion, which is traditionally considered separate from Judaism.)

Like the Sadducees who relied only on the Torah, some Jews in the 8th and 9th centuries rejected the authority and divine inspiration of the [[oral law]] as recorded in the [[Mishnah]] (and developed by later rabbis in the two [[Talmud]]s), relying instead only upon the [[Tanakh]]. These included the Isunians, the Yudganites, the [[Malikites]], and others. They soon developed oral traditions of their own, which differed from the rabbinic traditions, and eventually formed the [[Karaism|Karaite]] sect. Karaites exist in small numbers today, mostly living in Israel. Rabbinical and Karaite Jews each hold that the others are Jews, but that the other faith is erroneous.

Over a long time, Jews formed distinct ethnic groups in several different geographic areas—amongst others, the [[Ashkenazi Jews]] (of [[Central Europe|central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]), the [[Sephardi Jews]] (of Spain, [[Portugal]], and [[North Africa]]), the [[Beta Israel]] of [[Ethiopia]], and the [[Yemenite Jews]] from the southern tip of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. Many of these groups have developed differences in their prayers, traditions and accepted canons; however, these distinctions are mainly the result of their being formed at some cultural distance from normative (rabbinic) Judaism, rather than based on any doctrinal dispute.

===Persecutions===
{{Main article|Persecution of Jews|Antisemitism|History of antisemitism}}
[[Antisemitism]] arose during the [[Middle Ages]], in the form of persecutions, [[pogrom]]s, [[forced conversion]]s, expulsions, social restrictions and [[ghetto]]ization.

This was different in quality from the repressions of Jews which had occurred in ancient times. Ancient repressions were politically motivated and Jews were treated the same as members of other ethnic groups. With the rise of the Churches, the main motive for attacks on Jews changed from politics to religion and the religious motive for such attacks was specifically derived from Christian views about Jews and Judaism.&lt;ref name="History, religion, and antisemitism" /&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], Jewish people who lived under Muslim rule generally experienced tolerance and integration,&lt;ref name="Cohen, Mark R 1991"&gt;Cohen, Mark R.

''Tikkun'' 6.3 (1991)&lt;/ref&gt; but there were occasional outbreaks of violence like [[Almohads#Status of non-Muslims|Almohad's persecutions]].&lt;ref name="ugr"&gt;Amira K.

MEAH, sección Hebreo 56 (2007), 33–51&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasidism===
{{Main article|Hasidic Judaism}}

Hasidic Judaism was founded by [[Yisroel ben Eliezer (The Baal Shem Tov)|Yisroel ben Eliezer]] (1700–1760), also known as the ''Ba'al Shem Tov'' (or ''Besht''). It originated in a time of persecution of the Jewish people when European Jews had turned inward to Talmud study; many felt that most expressions of Jewish life had become too "academic", and that they no longer had any emphasis on spirituality or joy. Its adherents favored small and informal gatherings called [[Shtiebel]], which, in contrast to a traditional synagogue, could be used both as a place of worship and for celebrations involving dancing, eating, and socializing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How and Why Did Hasidism Spread?|last=Stampfer|first=Shaul|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel|pages=205–207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ba'al Shem Tov's disciples attracted many followers; they themselves established numerous Hasidic sects across Europe. Unlike other religions, which typically expanded through word of mouth or by use of print, Hasidism spread largely owing to [[Tzadik]]s, who used their influence to encourage others to follow the movement. Hasidism appealed to many Europeans because it was easy to learn, did not require full immediate commitment, and presented a compelling spectacle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=How and Why Did Hasidism Spread?|last=Stampfer|first=Shaul|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel|pages=202–204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasidic Judaism eventually became the way of life for many Jews in Eastern Europe. Waves of Jewish immigration in the 1880s carried it to the United States. The movement itself claims to be nothing new, but a ''refreshment'' of original Judaism. As some have put it: ''"they merely re-emphasized that which the generations had lost"''. Nevertheless, early on there was a serious schism between Hasidic and non-Hasidic Jews. European Jews who rejected the Hasidic movement were dubbed by the Hasidim as [[Misnagdim]], (lit. "opponents"). Some of the reasons for the rejection of Hasidic Judaism were the exuberance of Hasidic worship, its deviation from tradition in ascribing infallibility and miracles to their leaders, and the concern that it might become a messianic sect. Over time differences between the Hasidim and their opponents have slowly diminished and both groups are now considered part of [[Haredi Judaism]].

===The Enlightenment and new religious movements===
{{Main article|Haskalah|Jewish religious movements}}

In the late 18th century CE, Europe was swept by a group of intellectual, social and political movements known as the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. The Enlightenment led to reductions in the European laws that prohibited Jews to interact with the wider secular world, thus allowing Jews access to secular education and experience. A parallel Jewish movement, [[Haskalah]] or the "Jewish Enlightenment", began, especially in [[Central Europe]] and [[Western Europe]], in response to both the Enlightenment and these new freedoms. It placed an emphasis on integration with secular society and a pursuit of non-religious knowledge through reason. With the promise of political emancipation, many Jews saw no reason to continue to observe Jewish law and increasing numbers of Jews assimilated into Christian Europe. Modern religious movements of Judaism all formed in reaction to this trend.

In [[Central Europe]], followed by [[Great Britain]] and the United States, [[Reform Judaism|Reform (or Liberal) Judaism]] developed, relaxing legal obligations (especially those that limited Jewish relations with non-Jews), emulating [[Protestant]] decorum in prayer, and emphasizing the ethical values of Judaism's Prophetic tradition. [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]] developed in reaction to Reform Judaism, by leaders who argued that Jews could participate in public life as citizens equal to Christians while maintaining the observance of Jewish law. Meanwhile, in the United States, wealthy Reform Jews helped European scholars, who were Orthodox in practice but critical (and skeptical) in their study of the Bible and Talmud, to establish a seminary to train rabbis for immigrants from Eastern Europe. These left-wing Orthodox rabbis were joined by right-wing Reform rabbis who felt that Jewish law should not be entirely abandoned, to form the [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative movement]]. Orthodox Jews who opposed the Haskalah formed [[Haredi Orthodox Judaism]]. After massive movements of Jews following [[The Holocaust]] and the creation of [[Israel|the state of Israel]], these movements have competed for followers from among traditional Jews in or from other countries.

===Spectrum of observance===
[[File:KnesetEliyahooSynagogue.JPG|thumb|Judaism is practised in all parts of the world, for example in a synagogue in downtown [[Mumbai]].]]
Countries such as the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Argentina]] and [[South Africa]] contain large Jewish populations. Jewish religious practice varies widely through all levels of observance. According to the 2001 edition of the [[National Jewish Population Survey]], in the United States' Jewish community—the world's second largest—4.3&amp;nbsp;million Jews out of 5.1&amp;nbsp;million had some sort of connection to the religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishdatabank.org/studies/details.cfm?StudyID=307 |title=National Jewish Population Survey (NJPS) 2000–01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of that population of connected Jews, 80% participated in some sort of Jewish religious observance, but only 48% belonged to a congregation, and fewer than 16% attend regularly.&lt;ref name="harrisinteractive" /&gt;

Birth rates for American Jews have dropped from 2.0 to 1.7.&lt;ref name="relations" /&gt; (Replacement rate is 2.1.) Intermarriage rates range from 40–50% in the US, and only about a third of children of intermarried couples are raised as Jews. Due to intermarriage and low birth rates, the Jewish population in the US shrank from 5.5&amp;nbsp;million in 1990 to 5.1&amp;nbsp;million in 2001. This is indicative of the general population trends among the Jewish community in the [[Diaspora]], but a focus on total population obscures growth trends in some denominations and communities, such as [[Haredi Judaism]]. The [[Baal teshuva]] movement is a movement of Jews who have "returned" to religion or become more observant.

==Judaism and other religions==
===Christianity and Judaism===
{{Main article|Christianity and Judaism}}
{{See also|Christianity and antisemitism|Christian–Jewish reconciliation}}
[[Christianity]] was originally a sect of [[Second Temple Judaism]], but the two religions [[Split of early Christianity and Judaism|diverged in the first century]]. The differences between Christianity and Judaism originally centered on whether Jesus was the Jewish Messiah but eventually became irreconcilable. Major differences between the two faiths include the nature of the Messiah, of [[Atonement in Judaism|atonement]] and [[Jewish views on sin|sin]], the status of God's commandments to Israel, and perhaps most significantly of the [[God in Judaism|nature of God]] himself. Due to these differences, Judaism traditionally regards Christianity as [[Shituf]] or worship of the God of Israel which is not monotheistic. Christianity has traditionally regarded Judaism as obsolete with the invention of Christianity and Jews as a people replaced by the Church, though a Christian belief in [[dual-covenant theology]] emerged as a phenomenon following Christian reflection on how their theology influenced the Nazi [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Kendall Soulen, The God of Israel and Christian Theology, (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1996) {{ISBN|978-0-8006-2883-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the time of the [[History of Christianity during the Middle Ages|Middle Ages]], the [[Catholic Church]] upheld the ''[[Sicut Judaeis|Constitution pro Judæis]]'' (Formal Statement on the Jews), which stated {{quotation|We decree that no Christian shall use violence to force them to be baptized, so long as they are unwilling and refuse. ... Without the judgment of the political authority of the land, no Christian shall presume to wound them or kill them or rob them of their money or change the good customs that they have thus far enjoyed in the place where they live."&lt;ref name="BaskinSeeskin2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baskin|first1=Judith R.|last2=Seeskin|first2=Kenneth|title=The Cambridge Guide to Jewish History, Religion, and Culture|date=12 July 2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521869607|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Until [[Jewish emancipation|their emancipation]] in the late 18th and the 19th century, Jews in Christian lands were subject to humiliating legal restrictions and limitations. They included provisions requiring Jews to wear specific and identifying clothing such as the [[Jewish hat]] and the [[yellow badge]], restricting Jews to certain cities and towns or in certain parts of towns ([[Jewish ghettos in Europe|ghettos]]), and forbidding Jews to enter certain trades (for example selling new clothes in medieval [[Sweden]]). Disabilities also included special taxes levied on Jews, exclusion from public life, restraints on the performance of religious ceremonies, and linguistic censorship. Some countries went even further and completely expelled Jews, for example, [[Edict of Expulsion|England]] in 1290 (Jews were readmitted in 1655) and [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|Spain]] in 1492 (readmitted in 1868). The first Jewish settlers in North America arrived in the Dutch colony of [[New Amsterdam]] in 1654; they were forbidden to hold public office, open a retail shop, or establish a synagogue. When the colony was seized by the British in 1664 Jewish rights remained unchanged, but by 1671 [[Asser Levy]] was the first Jew to serve on a jury in North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/US-Israel/amsterdam.html |title=New Amsterdam's Jewish Crusader |publisher=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1791, [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]] was the first country to abolish disabilities altogether, followed by [[Prussia]] in 1848. [[Emancipation of the Jews in the United Kingdom]] was achieved in 1858 after an almost 30-year struggle championed by [[Isaac Lyon Goldsmid]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/237923/Sir-Isaac-Lyon-Goldsmid-1st-Baronet#ref213807 |title=Sir Isaac Lyon Goldsmid, 1st Baronet| publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the ability of Jews to sit in parliament with the passing of the [[Jews Relief Act 1858]]. The newly united [[German Empire]] in 1871 abolished Jewish disabilities in Germany, which were reinstated in the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in 1935.

Jewish life in Christian lands was marked by frequent [[blood libel]]s, expulsions, [[forced conversion]]s and [[massacre]]s. An underlying source of prejudice against Jews in Europe was religious. Christian rhetoric and antipathy towards Jews developed in the [[Apostolic Age|early years of Christianity]] and was reinforced by ever increasing anti-Jewish measures over the [[Early Christianity|ensuing centuries]]. The action taken by Christians against Jews included acts of violence, and murder culminating in the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="HarriesAfter" /&gt;{{rp|21}}&lt;ref name="Kung" /&gt;{{rp|169}}&lt;ref name="Dawidowicz" /&gt; These attitudes were reinforced in Christian preaching, art and popular teaching for two millennia, containing contempt for Jews,&lt;ref name=JCPSHorst&gt;Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs. 5 May 2009.

One of these was the Confessing Church, a Protestant denomination formed in May 1934, the year after Hitler became chancellor of Germany. One of its goals was to repeal the Nazi law "which required that the civil service would be purged of all those who were either Jewish or of partly Jewish descent." Another was to help those "who suffered through repressive laws, or violence." About 7,000 of the 17,000 Protestant clergy in Germany joined the Confessing Church. Much of their work has one unrecognized, but two who will never forget them are Max Krakauer and his wife. Sheltered in sixty-six houses and helped by more than eighty individuals who belonged to the Confessing Church, they owe them their lives. German Catholic churches went out of their way to protect Catholics of Jewish ancestry. More inclusive was the principled stand taken by Catholic Bishop Clemens Count von Galen of Munster. He publicly denounced the Nazi slaughter of Jews and actually succeeded in having the problem halted for a short time. ... Members of the Society of Friends—German Quakers working with organizations of Friends from other countries—were particularly successful in rescuing Jews. ... Jehovah's Witnesses, themselves targeted for concentration camps, also provided help to Jews.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The attitude of Christians and Christian Churches toward the Jewish people and Judaism, have been changed mostly positive since [[World War II]]. Pope [[John Paul II]] and the Catholic Church have "upheld the Church's acceptance of the continuing and permanent election of the Jewish people" as well as a [[Dual-covenant theology|reaffirmation of the covenant]] between [[God in Christianity|God]] and the Jews.&lt;ref name="Wigoder1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wigoder|first=Geoffrey|title=Jewish-Christian Relations Since the Second World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9N9RAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=14 January 2017|year=1988|publisher=Manchester University Press|language=English|isbn=9780719026393|page=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2015, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] released a 10,000-word document that, among other things, stated that Catholics should work with Jews to fight antisemitism.&lt;ref name="news.va"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.va/en/news/vatican-issues-new-document-on-christian-jewish-di|title=Vatican issues new document on Christian-Jewish dialogue|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam and Judaism===
{{Main article|Islam and Judaism}}
Both Judaism and [[Islam]] arose from the patriarch [[Abraham]], and they are therefore considered [[Abrahamic religions]]. In both Jewish and [[Muslim]] tradition, the Jewish and [[Arabs|Arab peoples]] are descended from the two sons of Abraham—[[Isaac]] and [[Ishmael]], respectively. While both religions are [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] and share many commonalities, they differ based on the fact that Jews do not consider [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] or [[Muhammad]] to be prophets. The religions' adherents have interacted with each other since the 7th century when [[Islam]] originated and spread in the [[Arabian peninsula]]. Indeed, the years 712 to 1066 CE under the [[Ummayad]] and the [[Abbasid]] rulers have been called the [[Golden age of Jewish culture in Spain]]. Non-Muslim monotheists living in these countries, including Jews, were known as [[dhimmis]]. Dhimmis were allowed to practice their own religions and administer their own internal affairs, but they were subject to certain restrictions that were not imposed on Muslims.&lt;ref name="Lewis-84" /&gt; For example, they had to pay the [[jizya]], a per capita tax imposed on free adult non-Muslim males,&lt;ref name="Lewis-84" /&gt; and they were also forbidden to bear arms or testify in court cases involving Muslims.&lt;ref name="lewis14" /&gt; Many of the laws regarding dhimmis were highly symbolic. For example, dhimmis in some countries were required to wear [[Yellow badge|distinctive clothing]], a practice not found in either the [[Qur'an]] or the [[hadiths]] but invented in [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] [[Baghdad]] and inconsistently enforced.&lt;ref name="lewis15" /&gt; Jews in Muslim countries were not entirely free from persecution—for example, many were killed, exiled or forcibly converted in the 12th century, in [[Persia]], and by the rulers of the [[Almohad]] dynasty in North Africa and [[Al-Andalus]],&lt;ref name="stillman" /&gt; as well as by the Zaydi imams of Yemen in the 17th century (see: [[Mawza Exile]]). At times, Jews were also restricted in their choice of residence—in [[Morocco]], for example, Jews were confined to walled quarters ([[mellah]]s) beginning in the 15th century and increasingly since the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="lewis16" /&gt;

In the mid-20th century, Jews were expelled from nearly all of the Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/263/why-jews-fled-the-arab-countries "Why Jews Fled the Arab Countries"]. ''Middle East Forum''. Retrieved on 28 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shumsky, Dmitry.

'Haaretz''. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; Most have chosen to live in [[Israel]]. Today, antisemitic themes including [[Holocaust denial]] have become commonplace in the propaganda of Islamic movements such as [[Hizbullah]] and [[Hamas]], in the pronouncements of various agencies of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran]], and even in the newspapers and other publications of [[Refah Partisi]].&lt;ref name="Lewis_MEQ" /&gt;

===Syncretic movements incorporating Judaism===
There are some movements that combine elements of Judaism with those of other religions. The most well-known of these is [[Messianic Judaism]], a religious movement, which arose in the 1960s,&lt;ref name=Feher1998p140 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p191b /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p194a /&gt;&lt;ref name =Meltonp373a /&gt; that incorporates elements of Judaism with the [[Christianity#Beliefs|tenets of Christianity]].&lt;ref name =Meltonp373a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p191a /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2006p194b /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherbok_179" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ariel2000p223 /&gt; The movement generally states that [[Jesus]] is the Jewish Messiah, that he is one of the [[Trinity|Three Divine Persons]],&lt;ref name="UMJC-3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Trinitarianism" /&gt; and that [[Salvation (Christianity)|salvation]] is only achieved through acceptance of Jesus as one's savior.&lt;ref name="JeC3" /&gt; Some members of the movement argue that Messianic Judaism is a sect of Judaism.&lt;ref name="MJSelfID" /&gt; Jewish organizations of every denomination reject this, stating that Messianic Judaism is a Christian sect, because it teaches creeds which are identical to those of [[Pauline Christianity]].&lt;ref name="Denominations" /&gt;

Other examples of [[syncretism]] include [[Semitic neopaganism]], a loosely organized sect which incorporates [[Paganism|pagan]] or [[Wicca]]n beliefs with some Jewish religious practices; [[Jewish Buddhists]], another loosely organized group that incorporates elements of Asian spirituality in their faith; and some [[Jewish Renewal|Renewal Jews]] who borrow freely and openly from [[Buddhism]], [[Sufism]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] religions, and other faiths.

The [[Kabbalah Centre]], which employs teachers from multiple religions, is a [[New Age]] movement that claims to popularize the [[kabbalah]], part of the [[Jewish mysticism|Jewish esoteric tradition]].

This universal humanity, however, was predicated (and still is) on the dualism of the flesh and the spirit, such that while the body is particular, marked through practice as Jew or Greek, and through anatomy as male or female, the spirit is universal. Paul did not, however, reject the body—as did, for instance, the gnostics—but rather promoted a system whereby the body had its place, albeit subordinated to the spirit. Paul's anthropological dualism was matched by a hermeneutical dualism as well. Just as the human being is divided into a fleshy and a spiritual component, so also is language itself. It is composed of outer, material signs and inner, spiritual significations. When this is applied to the religious system that Paul inherited, the physical, fleshy signs of the Torah, of historical Judaism, are re-interpreted as symbols of that which Paul takes to be universal requirements and possibilities for humanity. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

|chapter= Chapter 20: The Rise of Messianic Judaism
|chapterurl=
|quote= Messianic Judaism, although it advocated the idea of an independent movement of Jewish converts, remained the offspring of the missionary movement, and the ties would never be broken. The rise of Messianic Judaism was, in many ways, a logical outcome of the ideology and rhetoric of the movement to evangelize the Jews as well as its early sponsorship of various forms of Hebrew Christian expressions. The missions have promoted the message that Jews who had embraced Christianity were not betraying their heritage or even their faith but were actually fulfilling their true Jewish selves by becoming Christians. The missions also promoted the dispensationalist idea that the Church equals the body of the true Christian believers and that Christians were defined by their acceptance of Jesus as their personal Savior and not by their affiliations with specific denominations and particular liturgies or modes of prayer. Missions had been using Jewish symbols in their buildings and literature and called their centers by Hebrew names such as Emanuel or Beth Sar Shalom. Similarly, the missions' publications featured Jewish religious symbols and practices such as the lighting of a menorah. Although missionaries to the Jews were alarmed when they first confronted the more assertive and independent movement of Messianic Judaism, it was they who were responsible for its conception and indirectly for its birth. The ideology, rhetoric, and symbols they had promoted for generations provided the background for the rise of a new movement that missionaries at first rejected as going too far but later accepted and even embraced.

Unlike the previous communities of Jewish Christians, Messianic Jewish congregations were largely independent of control from missionary societies or Christian denominations, even though they still wanted the acceptance of the larger evangelical community.

|quote=When the term resurfaced in Israel in the 1940s and 1950s, it designated all Jews who accepted Christianity in its Protestant evangelical form. Missionaries such as the Southern Baptist Robert Lindsey noted that for Israeli Jews, the term ''nozrim'', "Christians" in Hebrew, meant, almost automatically, an alien, hostile religion. Because such a term made it nearly impossible to convince Jews that Christianity was their religion, missionaries sought a more neutral term, one that did not arouse negative feelings. They chose ''Meshichyim'', Messianic, to overcome the suspicion and antagonism of the term ''nozrim''. ''Meshichyim'' as a term also had the advantage of emphasizing messianism as a major component of the Christian evangelical belief that the missions and communities of Jewish converts to Christianity propagated. It conveyed the sense of a new, innovative religion rather that''{{sic}}'' an old, unfavorable one. The term was used in reference to those Jews who accepted Jesus as their personal savior, and did not apply to Jews accepting Roman Catholicism who in Israel have called themselves Hebrew Christians. The term Messianic Judaism was adopted in the United States in the early 1970s by those converts to evangelical Christianity who advocated a more assertive attitude on the part of converts towards their Jewish roots and heritage.

 |quote=Missionary Impossible, an imaginative video and curriculum guide for teachers, educators, and rabbis to teach Jewish youth how to recognize and respond to "Jews-for-Jesus," "Messianic Jews," and other Christian proselytizers, has been produced by six rabbinic students at Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion's Cincinnati School. The students created the video as a tool for teaching why Jewish college and high school youth and Jews in intermarried couples are primary targets of Christian missionaries.

 |quote='''''What is ALEPH's position on so called messianic Judaism?''''' ALEPH has a policy of respect for other spiritual traditions, but objects to deceptive practices and will not collaborate with denominations which actively target Jews for recruitment. Our position on so-called "Messianic Judaism" is that it is Christianity and its proponents would be more honest to call it that.

| accessdate = 18 August 2010

| quote = To convert to the Jewish sect of HaDerech, accepting Yeshua as your King is the first act after one's heart turns toward HaShem and His Torah – as one can not obey a commandment of God if they first do not love God, and we love God by following his Messiah. Without first accepting Yeshua as the King and thus obeying Him, then getting circumcised for the purpose of Jewish conversion only gains you access to the Jewish community. It means nothing when it comes to inheriting a place in the World to Come.... Getting circumcised apart from desiring to be obedient to HaShem, and apart from accepting Yeshua as your King, is nothing but a surgical procedure, or worse, could lead to you believe that Jewish identity grants you a portion in the World to Come – at which point, what good is Messiah Yeshua, the Word of HaShem to you? He would have died for nothing!... As a convert from the nations, part of your obligation in keeping the Covenant, if you are a male, is to get circumcised in fulfillment of the commandment regarding circumcision. Circumcision is not an absolute requirement of being a Covenant member (that is, being made righteous before HaShem, and thus obtaining eternal life), but it is a requirement of obedience to God's commandments, because circumcision is commanded for those who are of the seed of Abraham, whether born into the family, adopted, or converted....If after reading all of this you understand what circumcision is, and that is an act of obedience, rather than an act of gaining favor before HaShem for the purpose of receiving eternal life, then if you are male believer in Yeshua the Messiah for the redemption from death, the consequence of your sin of rebellion against Him, then pursue circumcision, and thus conversion into Judaism, as an act of obedience to the Messiah.

'''LCD Smartie''' is [[open-source software]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] which allows a character [[LCD]] to be used as an auxiliary display device for a PC. Supported devices include displays based on the [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] [[Hitachi HD44780 LCD controller|HD44780]] [[Controller (computing)|Controller]], the Matrix Orbital Serial/USB LCD, and [[Palm OS]] devices (when used in conjunction with [[PalmOrb]]). The program has built in support for many systems statistics (i.e. cpu load, network utilization, free disk space...), downloading [[RSS]] feeds, [[Winamp]] integration and support for several other popular applications. To support less common applications LCD Smartie uses a powerful plugin system.

The project was started as [[freeware]] by Basie P who wrote it in [[Delphi programming language|delphi]]. After running the software as freeware from 2001 to late 2004, Basie P quit the project and passed it on to Chris Lansley as an Open Source project hosted on the [[Sourceforge]] servers. Chris Lansley maintained the project for few years, and now the whole project remains alive thanks to the program community.
LCD Smartie is a relatively mature software and development of the main executable has slowed down considerably, most of the new features are introduced by new plugins which are released by both the core team and by the community. The LCD Smartie forums are quite active and are the primary source for support and developer discussion.

To facilitate the use of LCD Smartie on modern PCs running version of windows 7 and 8 the team has started working on a USB interface to connect LCDs to a PC that does not require any additional kernel driver and provides a complete plug and play experience.

'''Libert Froidmont''' (Latin: ''Libertus Fromondus'', 3 September 1587 in Haccourt-Liège &amp;ndash; 28 October 1653 in Louvain) a son of Gerard Libert de Froidmont and Marguerite Radoux, was a [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège|Liégeois]] theologian and scientist. He was a close companion to [[Cornelius Jansen]] and corresponded with [[René Descartes]].

==Life==
Froidmont was educated by the Jesuits in his native Haccourt, near Liège, and studied philosophy in Louvain at the Falcon college. He became friends with Jansenius but did not pursue his studies and instead went to teach first at Antwerp and later back at Louvain. His scientific interests led him to publish on physics and mathematics. 

Acknowledging him as an authority on meteors, [[Descartes]] sent him his ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'', which Froidmont received rather critically. The scientific revolution may have been underway but Froidmont, who was well informed on many scientific matters, kept a traditionalist Aristotelian view. Nevertheless, he sought to co-opt rather than reject new approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Davide Cellamare, and Paul J.J.M. Bakker, ''Libertus Fromondus' Christian Psychology: Medicine and Natural Philosophy in the ''Philosophia christiana de anima'' (1649)", ''Lias'', 42:1 (2015), pp. 37-66.&lt;/ref&gt;

While teaching philosophy he also started studying theology and obtained a doctorate in 1628. Meanwhile he had become close to Jansenius who entrusted him with the posthumous publication of the ''[[Augustinus (Jansenist book)|Augustinus]]''. Froidmont succeeded him in the chair of Scripture at Louvain.

As the study of argument is of clear importance to the reasons that we hold things to be true, [[logic]] is of essential importance to [[rationality]].  [[Argument]]s may be logical if they are "conducted or assessed according to strict principles of [[Validity (logic)|validity]]",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of English]], sense 1 of logic.&lt;/ref&gt; while they are rational according to the broader requirement that they are based on [[reason]] and [[knowledge]].

Logic and rationality have each been taken as fundamental concepts in [[philosophy]].  Philosophical [[rationalism]] in its most extreme form is the doctrine that knowledge can ultimately be founded on pure reason, while [[logicism]] is the doctrine that mathematical concepts, among others are reducible to pure logic.

==Forms of reasoning==
[[Deductive reasoning]] concerns the [[logical consequence]] of given premises. On a narrow conception of logic, logic concerns just deductive reasoning, although such a narrow conception controversially excludes most of what is called informal logic from the discipline.  Other forms of reasoning are sometimes also taken to be part of logic, such as [[inductive reasoning]] and [[abductive reasoning]], which are forms of reasoning that are not purely deductive, but include [[material inference]].  Similarly, it is important to distinguish deductive validity and inductive validity (called "strength"). An inference is deductively valid [[if and only if]] there is no possible situation in which all the premises are true but the conclusion false. An inference is inductively strong if and only if its premises give some degree of probability to its conclusion.

The notion of deductive validity can be rigorously stated for systems of formal logic in terms of the well-understood notions of [[semantics]]. Inductive validity, on the other hand, requires us to define a reliable generalization of some set of observations. The task of providing this definition may be approached in various ways, some less formal than others; some of these definitions may use logical association [[rule induction]], while others may use [[mathematical model]]s of probability such as [[decision tree]]s. For the most part this discussion of logic deals only with deductive logic.

Abductive reasoning is a form of [[inference]] which goes from an observation to a [[theory]] which accounts for the observation, ideally seeking to find the simplest and most likely explanation. In abductive reasoning, unlike in deductive reasoning, the premises do not guarantee the conclusion. One can understand abductive reasoning as "inference to the best explanation".&lt;ref&gt;Sober, Elliot. Core Questions in Philosophy, 5th edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical thinking==
{{main article|Critical thinking}}
Critical thinking, also called critical analysis, is clear, rational thinking involving [[critique]].

==Dialectic==
{{main article|Logic and dialectic}}
[[Dialectic]] is a discourse between two or more people holding different points of view about a subject but wishing to establish the truth through reasoned arguments. It has been the object of study since ancient times, but only recently has it been the subject of attempts at formalisation.

=={{anchor|Illogicality}} Illogical thinking and irrational processes==

[[wikt:illogicality|Illogicality]] in terms of thinking processes are, as defined by researchers such as [[Aaron T. Beck]], cognitive distortions that cause abnormal functioning. The state of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] often feeds off of [[wikt:illogical|illogical]] thinking and results in victims being mired in self-defeating conclusions. Patients seeking psychological help may suffer from problems of [[Hasty generalization|over-generalization]], becoming mired in general, negative conclusions on the basis of essentially insignificant life events. [[Cognitive behavioral therapy]] can assist individuals in recognizing their own habits of faulty logic and slanted interpretations of past experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Abnormal Psychology|pages=67–68|first=Ronald J.|last=Comer|publisher=Macmillan|date=2010|ISBN=9781429216319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand depression in the sense of "Weltschmerz" in its non-aesthetically realistic and non-positivistic nature is intrinsically logical and rational. Some philosophers assert that the question of value of life has not been answered in psychologically pleasing way without embracing circular reasoning fallacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Weltschmerz: Pessimism in German Philosophy, 1860-1900|pages=87-100|first=Frederick C.|last=Beiser|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=2016|ISBN=9780198768715}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Pessimism: Philosophy, Ethic, Spirit|pages=33-34|first=Joshua F.|last= Dienstag|publisher=Princeton University Press|date=2009|ISBN=9780691141121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the socio-political context, the ability to amalgamate disparate, conflicting interests and passions into an illogical synthesis has been labeled as a possible strength, albeit one with concurrent weaknesses, by literary publications such as ''[[Blackwood's Magazine]]'':
{{quote|It is difficult not to connect together these two very characteristic ideas of illogicalness and permanence. Not that illogicalness is itself a virtue, but the illogicalness of which we speak is not simply bad reasoning. It means here only that more than one principle is found to assert itself in... social work. But these principles are fused into a higher unity. The illogicalness is not the cause of the permanence, but rather both are joint products of a common cause— respect, namely, for the living forces which exist in human nature&lt;ref&gt;''Blackwood's Edinburgh Magazine'', Volume 104. 1868.&lt;/ref&gt;.}}

The '''Millennium Seed Bank Partnership''' (MSBP or MSB), formerly known as the Millennium Seed Bank Project,  is an international [[conservation biology|conservation]] project coordinated by the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]]. After being awarded a [[Millennium Commission]] grant in 1995, the project commenced in 1996, and is now housed in the [[Wellcome Trust]] Millennium Building situated in the grounds of [[Wakehurst Place]], [[West Sussex]]. Its purpose is to provide an "insurance policy" against the [[extinction]] of plants in the wild by storing [[seeds]] for future use. The storage facilities consist of large underground frozen vaults preserving the world's largest wild-plant [[seedbank]] or collection of seeds from wild species. The project had been started by Dr Peter Thompson and run by Paul Smith after the departure of [[Roger Smith (biologist)|Roger Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/conservation-climate-change/millennium-seed-bank/about-the-msb/our-history/index.htm |title=Science and Conservation - Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |publisher= |accessdate=21 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160217014140/http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/conservation-climate-change/millennium-seed-bank/about-the-msb/our-history/index.htm |archivedate=17 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Roger Smith was awarded the [[OBE]] in 2000, in the Queen's New Year Honours for services to the Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/new-year-honours-1135267.html |title=NEW YEAR HONOURS |work=The Independent |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In collaboration with other [[biodiversity]] projects around the world expeditions are sent to collect seeds from [[dryland]] plants. Where possible, collections are kept in the country of origin with duplicates being sent to the Millennium Seed Bank Project for storage. Major partnerships exist on all the continents, enabling the countries involved to meet international objectives such as the [[Global strategy for plant conservation|Global Strategy for Plant Conservation]] and the [[Millennium Development Goals]] of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]].

The seed bank at Kew has gone through many iterations.  The Kew Seed Bank facility, set up by Peter Thompson in 1980, preceded the MSBP and was headed by Roger Smith from 1980 to 2005. From 2005, Paul Smith took over as head of the MSBP.  The Wellcome Trust Millennium Seed Bank building was designed by the firm [[Stanton WIlliams]] and opened by Prince Charles in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kew.org/visit-wakehurst/explore/attractions/millennium-seed-bank Millennium Seed Bank Building] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719021303/http://www.kew.org/visit-wakehurst/explore/attractions/millennium-seed-bank |date=2014-07-19 }} page on website&lt;/ref&gt; The laboratories and offices are in two wings flanking a wide space open to visitors housing an exhibition, and also allowing them to watch the work of cleaning and preparing seeds for storage through the large windows of the work areas. There is also a view down to the entrance to the underground vaults where the seeds are stored at {{cvt|-20|°C}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kew.org/visit-wakehurst/explore/attractions/millennium-seed-bank-exhibition Millennium Seed Bank Exhibition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120403/http://www.kew.org/visit-wakehurst/explore/attractions/millennium-seed-bank-exhibition |date=2014-08-26 }} page on website&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the international programme of the MSBP was launched.

In April 2007, it banked its [[1000000000 (number)|billionth]] seed,&lt;ref name = billion&gt;Black, Richard [[BBC News]] 2007-04-26 Plant vault passes billion mark [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/6593333.stm], accessed 2007-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Oxytenanthera abyssinica'', a type of African bamboo.
In October 2009, it reached its 10% goal of banking all the world's wild plant species by adding ''[[Musa itinerans]]'', a wild [[banana]], to its seed vault. As estimates for the number of seed bearing plant species have increased, 34,088 wild plant species and 1,980,405,036 seeds in storage as of June 2015 represent over 13% of the world's wild plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About {{!}} Millennium Seed Bank Partnership At Kew|url=http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/collections/millennium-seed-bank/about-millennium-seed-bank|access-date=25 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626104051/http://www.kew.org/science-conservation/collections/millennium-seed-bank/about-millennium-seed-bank|archivedate=26 June 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Project aims==
The main aims of the project&lt;ref name=yearatkew&gt;"A Year at Kew – the Millennium Seed Bank" {{cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/places/wakehurst/seedbank.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526061239/http://www.kew.org/places/wakehurst/seedbank.html |archivedate=2007-05-26 |df= }} accessed 2007-06-09&lt;/ref&gt; are to:
* Collect the seeds from 75,000 species of plants by 2020, representing 25% of known [[flora]].  This is the second phase of this goal, with the original partnership goal of banking 10% of known flora by 2010 was achieved in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/8305456.stm |title=BBC NEWS - Science &amp; Environment - Banana marks seed bank milestone |publisher= |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Collect seeds from all of the UK's native flora.
* Further research into conservation and preservation of seeds and plants.
* Act as a focal point for research in this area and encourage public interest and support.

==International partnerships==
Partnerships exist in Australia, Mexico, [[Chile]], [[Kenya]], China, United States, [[Jordan]], [[Mali]], [[Malawi]], [[Madagascar]], [[Burkina Faso]], [[Botswana]], [[Tanzania]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Lebanon]] and [[South Africa]]. Australia is particularly significant as its flora constitutes 15% of the world's total of species, with 22% of them identified as under threat of extinction.&lt;ref name=australia&gt;Australian partnership project {{cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/msbp/where/Australia.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929134528/http://www.kew.org/msbp/where/Australia.htm |archivedate=2007-09-29 |df= }} accessed 2007-06-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation of seeds==
[[File:Pilosella officinarum cleaning.JPG|thumb|A placement student cleaning Pilosella officinarum at the Millennium Seed Bank.  The procedure is being carried out in a dust hood.]]
Seed collections arrive at the MSBP in varying states, sometimes attached to [[fruit]]s, sometimes clean. The collections usually also include a [[Pressed flower craft|voucher specimen]] that can be used to identify the plant.  The collections are immediately moved to a dry room until processing can be conducted where the seeds are cleaned of debris and other plant material, X-rayed, counted, and banked at {{cvt|-20|°C}}. Seeds are banked in hermetically sealed glass containers along with [[Silica gel]] packets impregnated with indicator compounds that change colour if moisture seeps into the collection. Seeds are tested for viability with a germination test shortly after banking and then at regular 10 year intervals. If seed collections are low, re-harvesting from the wild is always the preferred option.

==Seed distribution==
When seeds are required for research purposes they can be requested from the MSBP's seedlist. If it has the legal permission to do so the MSB can then provide up to 60 seeds for free, to bona fide, non-commercial organisations for the purposes of research, restoration, and reintroduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.kew.org/seedlist/ |title=MSB Seed List — Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |publisher= |accessdate=21 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All seeds provided to institutions are on a [[non-profit]] mutual benefit basis. The MSB also operates the [[UK Native Seed Hub]] which aims to improve the resilience of the UK's ecological networks by providing high quality UK native seeds to conservation and restoration groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3992">The [[stereotypical]] behavior of people from [[Minnesota]] to be [[courteous]], reserved, and mild-mannered, is popularly known as '''Minnesota nice'''. The cultural characteristics of "Minnesota nice" include polite friendliness, an aversion to confrontation, a tendency toward [[understatement]], a disinclination to make a fuss or stand out, emotional restraint, and [[self-deprecation]].&lt;ref name="Atkins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Atkins|first=Annette|year=2008|title=Creating Minnesota: A History from the Inside Out|publisher=[[Minnesota Historical Society]] |isbn=0-87351-633-8|pages=242, 243, 248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social norms ==
[[Playwright]] and corporate communications consultant Syl Jones suggested that ''Minnesota nice'' is not entirely about being "nice" but is more about keeping up appearances, maintaining the [[social order]], and keeping people in their place. He relates these [[social norms]] to the literary work of Danish-Norwegian novelist [[Aksel Sandemose]], the fictional [[Law of Jante]], and more generally, [[Scandinavia|Scandinavian]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news &lt;!-- actually commentary, but news citation format --&gt; | url = http://www.mprnews.org/story/2009/12/14/syljones | title = The unwritten rules that tell Minnesotans how to be nice | first = Syl | last = Jones | date = December 14, 2009 | publisher = [[Minnesota Public Radio]] | location = [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]] | accessdate = December 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Garrison Keillor]]'s ''[[A Prairie Home Companion]]'' discusses "Wobegonics", the supposed language of Minnesotans which includes "no confrontational verbs or statements of strong personal preference".&lt;ref&gt;[http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/programs/19970419/97_0419WOBEGONICS.htm "Wobegonics" on ''A Prairie Home Companion'', Saturday, April 19, 1997] Retrieved December 14, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
The generosity of state citizens has been commented on; the heavily-reported [[influenza vaccine]] shortage of late 2004 did not strike the state as hard as elsewhere since many people willingly gave up [[injection (medicine)|injection]]s for others.&lt;ref&gt;''[[New York Times]]''. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/12/national/12flu.html In Minnesota, Flu Vaccines Go Waiting]". 12 November 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept has also received some support from the academic community; a national study by Peter Rentfrow, Samuel Gosling, and Jeff Potter done in 2008 found that Minnesota was the second most [[Agreeableness|agreeable]] and fifth most [[Extroversion|extroverted]] state in the nation, traits associated with "nice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1745-6924.2008.00084.x |pmid=26158954 |title=A Theory of the Emergence, Persistence, and Expression of Geographic Variation in Psychological Characteristics |journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science |volume=3 |issue=5 |pages=339–69 |year=2008 |last1=Rentfrow |first1=Peter J. |last2=Gosling |first2=Samuel D. |last3=Potter |first3=Jeff }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of [[social progressivism]] in [[Minnesota politics]] has been linked to the Minnesota Nice culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Christian |last1=Eichenlaub |year=2008 |title='Minnesota Nice': A Comparative Analysis of Minnesota's Treatment of Adoption by Gay Couples |journal=University of St. Thomas Law Journal |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=312–34 |url=http://ir.stthomas.edu/ustlj/vol5/iss1/13/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Minnesota nice was an influence on the [[Coen brothers]] movie ''[[Fargo (film)|Fargo]]'', set in both Minnesota and neighboring [[North Dakota]]; a documentary about the making of the movie was entitled ''Minnesota Nice''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0323262/ ''Minnesota Nice''] at [[imdb.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological impact==
{{See also|Miscarriage and mental illness}}
Miscarriage has an emotional effect and can also lead to psychological disorders. One discorder that can develop is primary maternal preoccupation. This is defined as a " ...'special psychiatric condition' in which the pregnant woman identifies with her baby, highlights the crisis a woman faces when the baby with whom she is preoccupied and identified dies..."&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt; Grieving manifests itself differently for each woman after miscarriage. It may often go unrecognized.&lt;ref name="loyd"/&gt; The grief that follows a miscarriage resembles, but is not the same as, the grief experienced after the loss of a family member.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brier|first=Norman|date=2008-03-17|title=Grief Following Miscarriage: A Comprehensive Review of the Literature|journal=Journal of Women's Health|volume=17|issue=3|pages=451–464|doi=10.1089/jwh.2007.0505|pmid=18345996|issn=1540-9996|citeseerx=10.1.1.473.673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disbelief, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], [[anger]], and yearning, are described as being a part of the normal grieving process.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kinsey|first=Cara Bicking|last2=Baptiste-Roberts|first2=Kesha|last3=Zhu|first3=Junjia|last4=Kjerulff|first4=Kristen H.|date=2015-02-01|title=Effect of Previous Miscarriage on Depressive Symptoms During Subsequent Pregnancy and Postpartum in the First Baby Study|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=391–400|doi=10.1007/s10995-014-1521-0|pmid=24894728|issn=1092-7875|pmc=4256135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = beutel&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beutel|first=M.|last2=Deckardt|first2=R.|last3=von Rad|first3=M.|last4=Weiner|first4=H.|date=November 1995|title=Grief and depression after miscarriage: their separation, antecedents, and course|journal=Psychosomatic Medicine|volume=57|issue=6|pages=517–526|issn=0033-3174|pmid=8600477}}&lt;/ref&gt; These reactions remain from three to nine months after the loss. Forty-one percent of parents experience a normal, expected decline in grief in the first two years while 59% were delayed in the resolution of their grief.&lt;ref name="kirs" /&gt;

Grieving can create feelings of [[loneliness]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
This grieving has been called a type of  [[psychological trauma]].&lt;ref name="loyd"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lloyd Jones|first1=Sarah|year=2015|title=The Psychological Miscarriage: An Exploration of Women's Experience of Miscarriage in the Light of Winnicott's 'Primary Maternal Preoccupation', The Process of Grief According to Bowlby and Parkes, and Klein's Theory of Mourning|journal=British Journal of Psychotherapy|volume=31|issue=4|pages=433–447|doi=10.1111/bjp.12172|issn=0265-9883}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; Other serious consequences can develop including depression, [[anxiety disorder]], [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]], and [[Somatic symptom disorder|somatoform disorder]]. These responses all are associated with grieving after a miscarriage.&lt;ref name="ce" /&gt; Some women are able to complete the grieving process a few weeks after the miscarriage and start anticipating their next pregnancy. Planning another pregnancy is traumatic for others. The impact of a miscarriage can be "crippling" psychologically.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt; Anger can be directed toward those who have had successful  pregnancies and children.&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;  A woman can grieve the "loss of a future child" and question her own role as a mother.&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; They may blame themselves or their partner for the miscarriage.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.webmd.com/baby/grief-after-miscarriage#1|title=Grief After Miscarriage|work=WebMD|access-date=2017-09-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Robinson2011dil/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

Unsuccessful attempts to become pregnant through [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) can also illicit a similar grief response in women.&lt;ref name="Robinson2011dil"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Robinson|first1=Gail Erlick|title=Dilemmas Related to Pregnancy Loss|journal=The Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease|volume=199|issue=8|year=2011|pages=571–574|issn=0022-3018|doi=10.1097/NMD.0b013e318225f31e|pmid=21814082}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those experiencing a late miscarriage may have more significant distress compared to those who have experienced a miscarriage in the first trimester.&lt;ref name="ce"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scheidt|first=CE|date=2007|title=Trauerverarbeitung nach Prä- und Perinatalverlust ( Mourning processing after pre-and perinatal loss)|journal=Psychother Psych Med|volume=57|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1055/s-2006-951906|pmid=17357028}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even depression can occur.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;

===Trauma===
Miscarriage has been found to be a traumatic event and a major loss for women.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt; Pregnancy loss, including induced abortion is a risk factor for mental illness. The impact of miscarriage can be underestimated.{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}}&lt;ref name=buon/&gt; The trauma can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
The trauma of miscarriage can be compounded if the miscarriage was accompanied by visible and relatively large amounts of blood loss.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}}
&lt;!--==Risks==--&gt; 
Bipolar disorders are associated with miscarriage. Depression and bilpolar disorder becomes evident after a miscarriage in 43% of women. Some women are more likely to experience complicated and prolonged grief than others.&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;

==== Mental health ====
Women experiencing miscarriage are at risk for grief reactions, anxiety or depression.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;  Obsessiveness regarding the miscarriage can develop.{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}}  Primary maternal preoccupation is also considered a consequence of miscarriage. This condition can occur if a woman who develop a close bond "with her baby" experiences the loss of the pregnancy.&lt;ref name="loyd" /&gt;{{Medical citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Complicated grief===
Different grieving "styles" can exist and vary between individuals. There can be a complete avoidance of dealing with the memories of the miscarriage and there can be an "obsessive" concentration on an event in the miscarriage. This is in contrast with the expected ability to "reminisce about the loss of a loved one".{{sfn|Seftel|page = 60}} [[Prolonged grief disorder|Complicated grief]] differs from the more common form of grief that occurs after a miscarriage. The grieving process associated with other events such as the loss of a spouse or parent is expected to decline in predictable and steady rate. This not true for those experiencing grief after a miscarriage because only 41% follow the expected decline in grief while most, 59% do not fit this pattern.&lt;ref name = kirs&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kersting|first=Anette|last2=Wagner|first2=Birgit|date=June 2012|title=Complicated grief after perinatal loss|journal=Dialogues in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=14|issue=2|pages=187–194|issn=1294-8322|pmc=3384447|pmid=22754291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stress and posttraumatic stress disorder===
Miscarriage is associated with post traumatic stress disorder.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;&lt;ref name=daug&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Daugirdaitė|first=Viltė|last2=Akker|first2=Olga van den|last3=Purewal|first3=Satvinder|date=2015|title=Posttraumatic Stress and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after Termination of Pregnancy and Reproductive Loss: A Systematic Review|url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/jp/2015/646345/|journal=Journal of Pregnancy|language=en|volume=2015|pages=1–14|doi=10.1155/2015/646345|pmid=25734016|pmc=4334933|issn=2090-2727}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = kirs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bowles|first=Stephen V.|last2=James|first2=Larry C.|last3=Solursh|first3=Diane S.|last4=Yancey|first4=Michael K.|last5=Epperly|first5=Ted D.|last6=Folen|first6=Raymond A.|last7=Masone|first7=Maryann|date=2000-03-15|title=Acute and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder After Spontaneous Abortion|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2000/0315/p1689.html|journal=American Family Physician|language=en|volume=61|issue=6|issn=0002-838X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Risks for developing PTSD after miscarriage are: emotional pain, expressions of emotion, and low levels of  social support.&lt;ref name= daug/&gt; Even if relatively low levels of stress occur after the miscarriage, symptoms of PTSD including flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, dissociation and hyperarousal can later develop.{{sfn|Seftel|page=60}} The effects of stress can complicate miscarriage.&lt;ref name = jeve/&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Miscarriage is a stressful event and because stress is a risk factor for subsequent miscarriage, its presence can become part of cycle that continues.&lt;ref name="jeve" /&gt; Lower stress levels are associated with more favorable outcomes in future pregnancies while higher stress levels increase the risk.{{sfn|Christiansen|page = 92}}

==Recovery==
Physical recovery from miscarriage can have an effect on emotional disturbances. The body has to recover from the sudden pregnancy loss. In some instances f[[Fatigue (medical)|fatigue]] is present. [[Insomnia]] can be a problem.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name="aafp" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The miscarriage is very upsetting to the family and can generate very strong emotions. Some women may feel that the miscarriage occurred because they somehow had caused it. Others may blame the father or partner for the miscarriage.&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hale|first=B.|date=2007-01-01|title=Culpability and blame after pregnancy loss|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/33/1/24|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=24–27|doi=10.1136/jme.2005.015560|issn=0306-6800|pmid=17209106|pmc=2598085}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coping with a miscarriage can very greatly between women and families.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name = aafp/&gt; Some find it difficult to talk about the miscarriage.&lt;ref name = aafp&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2007-11-01|title=Pregnancy Loss: What You Should Know|journal=American Family Physician|volume = 76|issue=9|pages=1347–8|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/2007/1101/p1347.html|language=en|pmid=18019879|author1=American Academy of Family Physicians}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sing" /&gt; The narratives of women tend to coincide with quantified and measurable effects.&lt;ref name = loyd/&gt; Some women engage in activities that are believed to aid in recovery such as therapy, [[religion]] and art.{{sfn|Seftel|page = 57}}

* Turning to loved ones and friends for support. Sharing feelings and asking for help when needed.
* Talking to the partner about the miscarriage. 
* Keeping in mind that men and women cope with loss in different ways.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Making good choices for health and well-being such as: eating healthy foods, keeping active, and getting enough sleep to help restore energy.
* Joining a support group. A support group might help with feelings of being alone in the loss.&lt;ref name="whealth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;
* Doing something in remembrance of the baby.
* Seeking help from a grief counselor, especially if the grief doesn't ease with time.&lt;ref name = whealth/&gt;

Generally, the impact of experiencing miscarriage is underestimated.&lt;ref name="buon"/&gt;{{sfn|Chritiansen| page=87}} Other methods used to promote recovery are be relaxation techniques, guided imagery, and "thought-stopping". Even Gestalt role-playing has been used. Some women can "emotionally relocate the child", redefine a relationship "with the missing child", and engage in "continuing the bond" to incorporate the loss into their life experiences.{{sfn | Seftel | page = 60}}

Women who have miscarried report that they were dissatisfied with the care they received from physicians and nurses.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014provision/&gt; One observer highlights the insensitivity of some health care providers when they approach the grieving mother "...by playing down her emotion as somehow an irrational response..."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christiansen|first=Dorte M.|title=Posttraumatic stress disorder in parents following infant death: A systematic review|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0272735816300903|journal=Clinical Psychology Review|language=en|volume=51|pages=60–74|doi=10.1016/j.cpr.2016.10.007|pmid=27838460|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Clinicians may not recognize the psychological impact of the miscarriage and can "expect parents to move on with their lives."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Since the experiences of women can vary so widely, sensitive nursing care afterward is appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Radford|first=Eleanor J|last2=Hughes|first2=Mark|date=2015-06-01|title=Women's experiences of early miscarriage: implications for nursing care|journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing|volume=24|issue=11–12|pages=1457–1465|doi=10.1111/jocn.12781|pmid=25662397|issn=1365-2702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Children and concerns about future pregnancies==
One emotional response to miscarriage is the strong apprehension that can develop anticipating a subsequent pregnancy.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name = sing&gt;{{cite journal | publisher = Singapore Nursing Journal | title = The impact miscarriage on women's psychological well being and interventions: A literature review | first = Marianne | last = Wen-Yi | first2 = Lam | last2 = Ka Shun | first3 = Priscilla Jia | last3 = Ling Ho et.al }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = aafp/&gt; Procreation abilities may also be questioned by the woman.&lt;ref name = sing/&gt;&lt;ref name="lok" /&gt; Significant distress can develop in the other children in the family when they think a sibling has died. They may regard this as a baby they did not get to meet. They can also experience grief and guilt find it difficult to express these emotions to their parents. The siblings may feel a need to act as if everything is the same and that they are unaffected in an attempt to protect their parents from their own feelings. Children can also need help, understanding and the ability to make sense of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Becoming Parents and Overcoming Obstacles : Understanding the Experience of Miscarriage, Premature Births, Infertility, and Postnatal Depression|last=Quagliata|first=Emanuela|publisher=Karnac Books|year=2013|isbn=9781782200185|location=City|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials and burial==
[[Ritual]]s that recognize the loss can be important in coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Women's reproductive mental health across the lifespan|others=Lynn-Barnes, Diana|isbn=9783319051154|location=Cham|oclc=880941778}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Family and friends often conduct a memorial or burial service.&lt;ref name=Robinson2014pregloss/&gt;&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; Hospitals also can provide support and help memorialize the event. Depending on locale others desire to have a private ceremony.&lt;ref name=uk/&gt; The religious faith of the woman and family impacts the grief process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cowchock|first=F.

&lt;!--==Narratives==
Women discuss their miscarriage and interact with others who have had the same experience. This is one way that their loss is recognized, publically mourned and socially accepted.{{sfn | Seftel | page = 57}}--&gt;

==In culture==
Grieving after the loss of a child through miscarriage in other cultures can vary from western culture.&lt;ref name="Klass2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Klass|first1=Dennis|title=Book Reviews of Narratives of Sorrow and Dignity: Japanese Women, Pregnancy Loss, and Modern Rituals of Grieving|journal=OMEGA - Journal of Death and Dying|volume=70|issue=4|year=2015|pages=454–457|issn=0030-2228|doi=10.1177/0030222815573931}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://hospicefoundation.org/Grief-(1)/What-to-Expect | title=Hospice Foundation of America - What is Grief?}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An individual’s [[culture]] plays a large role in determining an inappropriate pattern of grief, and it is appropriate to take into account cultural norms before reaching a complicated grief diagnosis.&lt;ref name="one"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shear|first1=MK|last2=Simon|first2=N|last3=Wall|first3=M|last4=Zisook|first4=S|last5=Neimeyer|first5=R|last6=Duan|first6=N|last7=Reynolds|first7=C|last8=Lebowitz|first8=B|last9=Sung|first9=S|last10=Ghesquiere|first10=A|last11=Gorscak|first11=B|last12=Clayton|first12=P|last13=Ito|first13=M|last14=Nakajima|first14=S|last15=Konishi|first15=T|last16=Melhem|first16=N|last17=Meert|first17=K|last18=Schiff|first18=M|last19=O'Connor|first19=MF|last20=First|first20=M|last21=Sareen|first21=J|last22=Bolton|first22=J|last23=Skritskaya|first23=N|last24=Mancini|first24=AD|last25=Keshaviah|first25=A|title=Complicated grief and related bereavement issues for DSM-5.|journal=Depression and Anxiety|date=February 2011|volume=28|issue=2|pages=103–17|doi=10.1002/da.20780|pmid=21284063|pmc=3075805}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are cultural differences in emotional levels, how these are expressed and how long they are expressed.

Investigations describe their grief over their miscarriage: "When miscarriage occurs it is not a gore, an embryo, or a fetus they lose, it is their child.

'''Morteza Motahari'''  ({{lang-fa|{{nq|مرتضی مطهری}}}}; January 31, 1919 &amp;ndash; May 1, 1979) was an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]  [[cleric]], philosopher, lecturer, and politician.

Motahari is considered to have an important influence on the ideologies of the [[Islamic Republic]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Manouchehr Ganji|title=Defying the Iranian Revolution: From a Minister to the Shah to a Leader of Resistance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NboVl-CeYs0C&amp;pg=PA109|accessdate=8 August 2013|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-97187-8|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a co-founder of [[Hosseiniye Ershad]] and the [[Combatant Clergy Association]] (''Jāme'e-ye Rowhāniyat-e Mobārez''). He was a disciple of [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]] during the [[Shah]]'s reign and formed the [[Council of the Islamic Revolution]] at Khomeini's request. He was chairman of the council at the time of his assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J5RGlpx0j8sC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;dq=Furqan+mutahhari&amp;lr=&amp;ei=YUnuSdeKFYjCMqTLkJQB ''Debating Muslims''] Michael M.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Motahari was born in [[Fariman]] on January 31, 1919. He attended the [[Hawza]] of [[Qom]] from 1944 to 1952 and then left for [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name=kasra&gt;{{cite web|last=Kasra|first=Nilofar|title=Ayatollah Morteza Motahari|url=http://iichs.org/index_en.asp?id=1627&amp;doc_cat=16|work=IICHS|accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather was an eminent religious scholar in [[Sistan]] province and since he traveled with his family to [[Khorasan Province]], there is little information about his origin as Sistanian.&lt;ref&gt;اولین همایش مطهری سیستانی در زابلhttp://www.neyzarnews.ir&lt;/ref&gt; His father Shaykh Mohammad Hosseini was also an eminent figure in his village, Fariman, who was respected by the people. He was considered as one of the pupils of [[Mohammad-Kazem Khorasani|Akhund Khorasani]] and besides he was admired by Ayatollah [[Shahab al-Din Mar'ashi Najafi|Mara'shi Najafi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Abdollah Nasri|Life's outcome, A survry of Murteza Motahari's ideas|pp=5–6|1386 solar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

It is said that he was very intelligent as a child. At the age of 5, he went to school without informing his parents. Sometimes he was found sleeping near the school. By the age of twelve he learned the preliminary Islamic sciences from his father. He also went to the seminary of Mashhad and studied for two years there in the school of Abd ul-Khan along with his brother. But his studies remained unfinished  in Mashhad seminary because of problems faced by his family which obliged him to return to Fariman to help them.

According to his own account, in this period he could study a great number of historical books. It was in this period that he was confronted with questions on worldview such as the problem of God. He considered Agha Mirza Mahdi Shahid Razavi as an eminent master in rational sciences. He decided to go to [[Qom]] in 1315 [[Solar Hijri calendar]].&lt;ref name=Nasri&gt;{{cite book|title=Lif's outcome:A survey of Morteza Motahari's Ideas|last=Nasri|date=1386|p=5–10 |publisher=daftere Nashre Farhang}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He finally took up residence in the school of Feyzieh in [[Qum]]. He studied books Kifayah and Makaseb in Shia jurisprudence under instruction of Ayatollah Sayyed Mohaqeq Yazdi popularly known as Damad. He also participated in the lectures of Hojjat Kooh Kamarehei ant sough knowledge from Sayyed Sadr Al Din Sadr, Mohammad Taqi Khansari, Golpaygani, Aaahmad Khansari and Najafi Marashi.&lt;ref name="Nasri"/&gt;

When Ayatollah Boroujerdi emigrated to Qom, Motahari could take part in his courses on Principles of Jurisprudence. Ayatollah Montazeri was his classmate in this period.&lt;ref name="Nasri"/&gt;

Later, Motahari emigrates to Isfahan because of hot climate of [[Qom]]. There he becomes familiar with Haj Ali Agha Shirazi who was the teacher of Nahj Al Balaghah in 1320 [[Solar Hijri calendar]] who Motahari always describes with honor.&lt;ref name="Nasri"/&gt;
Later, he joined the [[University of Tehran]], where he taught philosophy for 22 years. Between 1965 and 1973 he also gave regular lectures at [[Hosseiniye Ershad|the Hosseiniye Ershad]] in Northern Tehran.

Motahari wrote several books on [[Islam]], [[Iran]], and historical topics. His emphasis was on teaching rather than writing. However, after his death, some of his students worked on writing down his lectures and publishing them as books. As of the mid-2008, the "Sadra Publication" published more than sixty volumes by Motahari. Nearly 30 books were written about Motahari or quoted from his speeches.

Morteza Motahari opposed what he called groups who "depend on other schools, especially materialistic schools" but who present these "foreign ideas with Islamic emblems". In a June 1977 article he wrote to warn "all great Islamic authorities" of the danger of "these external influential ideas under the pretext and banner of Islam." It is thought he was referring to the [[People's Mujahideen of Iran]] and the [[Furqan Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1QTrs9Nk4DEC|title=The Political Thought of Ayatollah Murtaza Mutahhari: An Iranian Theoretician of the Islamic State|first=Mahmood T.|last=Davari|date=1 October 2004|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|accessdate=19 August 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motahari was the father in law of Iran's former secretary of National Security Council [[Ali Larijani]].&lt;ref name=rabi11&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sohrabi|first=Naghmeh|title=The Power Struggle in Iran:  A Centrist Comeback?|journal=Middle East Brief|date=July 2011|issue=53|url=http://www.brandeis.edu/crown/publications/meb/MEB53.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was by Motahari's advice that Larijani switched from computer science to [[Western Philosophy]] for graduate studies.

A major street in Tehran formerly known as ''Takhte Tavoos'' ([[Peacock Throne]]) was renamed after him. Morteza Motahari Street connects Sohrevardi Street and Vali Asr Street, two major streets in Tehran.

==Activities during Islamic revolution==
{{Iranian Revolution}}
During the struggle with [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|shah]]’s regime, Morteza Motahari contributed in creating new Islamic discourses. Besides, he was among those who had discussed the conditions of [[Marja']] after the death of [[Seyyed Hossein Borujerdi|Ayatollah Broujerdi]]. He wrote the book ''Mutual services of Iran and Islam'' in such a {{clarify|date=August 2016}}condition. Also his works had important impact on expanding the movement of religious reform in early days of revolution. His works primarily consisted of traditional Islamic and Shia thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=irY4_doVYVYC|title=Islam and Democracy in Iran: Eshkevari and the Quest for Reform|first1=Hasan Yousefi|last1=Eshkevari|first2=Ziba|last2=Mir-Hosseini|first3=Richard|last3=Tapper|date=27 June 2006|publisher=I.B.Tauris|accessdate=19 August 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote an essay about revitalization of religious thought in the occasion. Writing the "need for Candidness in religious leadership", he aimed to show the youth the attractiveness of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hZ7Hmo5_7cgC|title=Intellectual Discourse and the Politics of Modernization: Negotiating Modernity in Iran|first=Ali|last=Mirsepassi|date=12 October 2000|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=19 August 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Morteza Motahhari.jpg|thumb|264x264px|Motahhari in his late years]]
During the [[Iranian revolution|revolution]], while Shapour Bakhtiyar prevented [[Khomeini's return to Iran]] in 1978, Ayatollah Motahari was the leader who managed the protester clergies in Tehran University's mosque. Motahari was an important figure, and helped [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] to organize revolutionary department.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Opinions==
Morteza Motahari expressed his opinions in different majors and disciplines such as [[philosophy]], [[religion]], [[economic]], [[politics]] and etc. Motahari and  [[Ali Shariati|Shariati]] were counted as two prominent figures during [[Islamic revolution of Iran]]. He emphasized on Islamic democracy for suitable political structure.&lt;ref name="Jafar"/&gt;

Motahari also recognized [[fitra]] as the truth of human. According to him, fitra is a permanent and unchangeable quality in human nature. In fact, he believed that fitra played the role of a mediator in God-human beings relation. Also, he believed that [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Imam]] was a perfect man who shows the high rank of human spirituality. Imam also is characterized as a religious leader. His lengthy footnote on the “book of principles of philosophy and method of realism” by [[Muhammad Husayn Tabataba'i]] was against the historical [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shahibzadeh|first1=Yadullah|title=Islamism and Post-Islamism in Iran: An Intellectual History|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137578259|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4olFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=morteza+motahari&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC9_PAl_vNAhXsIpoKHbhDDO84FBDoAQhFMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=morteza%20motahari&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 August 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also he believed that ''[[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist|Wali-e faqih]]'' only had the right of supervisory not governing.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b7upBAAAQBAJ|title=Religious Secularity: A Theological Challenge to the Islamic State|first1=Naser|last1=Ghobadzadeh|first2=Nāṣir|last2=Qubādzādah|date=1 December 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=19 August 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also maintained that the ruling was one of the political aspect of Imam in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Surdykowska|first1=Sylwia|title=Martyrdom and Ecstasy: Emotion Training in Iranian Culture|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443839532|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqIwBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA179&amp;dq=morteza+motahari&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiRkMffn_vNAhXJjywKHXT4CDA4HhDoAQhRMAk#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 August 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that there was no conflict between science and religion since he believed that Science qua science had no conflict and challenge with metaphysics. He believed that the quasi-conflict between science and religion was in terms of their language not themselves.&lt;ref&gt;The relation of science and religion according to Motahari, Muhammad hossein mahdavi nejad, magazine of legal investigation, number:6-7, 1381 solar, in persian&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development===
Motahari also expressed views on development and relevant ideology. According to him, freedom, culture and mental-cultural revolution are principles of development. He also refers to some elements for characterizing a developed society.these factors are  independence, knowledge and transcendence. Also, according to Motahari, development originates from cultural self-reliance, purification of cultural sources and logical and cautious communication with [[western civilization|west]]. Motahari believed in the development of human resources but he also thought that economy was not an aim but only is  a condition for development.&lt;ref name="Jafar"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Movahedi|first1=Masood|last2=Siuki|first2=Jafar Fahimi|last3=Shakeri|first3=Mohsen|title=Analysis of Current Theories on the Development of the Islamic Republic of Iran|journal=Academic Journal of Research in Economics and Management|date=September 2014|volume=2|issue=9|pages=42–48|doi=10.12816/0006595|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4olFDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52&amp;dq=morteza+motahari&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiC9_PAl_vNAhXsIpoKHbhDDO84FBDoAQhFMAg#v=onepage&amp;q=morteza%20motahari&amp;f=false|accessdate=19 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equality===
As outlined by Ayatollah Morteza Motahari in 1975, the phrase ‘equal rights’ means something different from what is commonly understood by western world. He clarified that men and women were innately different and therefore enjoyed different rights, duties and punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bucar|first1=Elizabeth M.|title=Creative Conformity: The Feminist Politics of U.S. Catholic and Iranian Shi'i Women|publisher=Georgetown University Press|isbn=1589017528|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Creative_Conformity.html?id=eQVxVEldP0sC|accessdate=20 August 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fiqh===
Motahari believed that the eternality of Islam is provided by ''[[Jurisprudence|Fiqh]]''. He thought that fiqh along with the character of [[ijtihad]] could be an important thing for confronting with the problem of different times and places. Using ijtihad, there is no need to a new prophet.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

===Anthropology ===
Motahari also believed that there were great challenges between scientists for knowing the human as a phenomenon and at the same time we can rarely find two philosophers who have common ideas in their approach toward studying humanity.&lt;ref name="Naderi 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naderi|first1=Mohammad|title=PATHOLOGY OF PRESERVATION OF MORALITY IN ISLAMIC AND WESTERN SOCIETIES|journal=Kuwait Chapter of Arabian Journal of Business and Management Review|date=July 2014|volume=3|issue=11a|url=http://www.arabianjbmr.com/pdfs/KD_VOL_3_11a/7.pdf|accessdate=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freedom ===
Motahari defined freedom as nonexistence of obstacles. According to him, obstacles were of two characters. The first one was that obstacle could limit human and besides counted as a something get human not to do something. In simple word, obstacle could has the dignity of limiting and declining humans. The second one is to thing which decline the perception and introspection of subject in terms of knowledge. According to Motahhari, aside from the realization of putting away obstacles we need to give the spirit of freedom. He analyze the concept of freedom as both right and obligation. He believes that the freedom has necessity for human. Human must be free to choose voluntarily his path. He believes that, contrary to liberalists, inborn right has an ultimate for transcending of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;lif's outcome, A survey of Morteza Motahari's Ideas.p.455-475.vol.1,1386 solar,Abdullah Nasri&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of law===
Like other men of thought, Motahari thinks that we have to define the concepts first of all. Therefore, he defines right as a dominance or score on something. According to right the human is merit to possess something and other human ought to respect him. Some of rights are such as the right of parents on their children or the rights of husband and wife in relation to each other. Motahari divided the right into two groups. First group is existential rights Or Takwini and the second is religious rights or tashriei. former is a real relation between person and object and the latter determined according to former. He knew the right as a potential score for persons. In fact the right concerned with the priority of somebody on something. He concerned with the question in that is the right and possession predicated on human as such or predicated on human in terms of being in society? He believes that undoubtedly the right existed prior to society.Contrary to [[John Austin (legal philosopher)]], Motahari believes that there is a mutual relation between right and responsibility (''Haq va Taklif''). Motahari believes that the natural law theory is a rational one that is of importance for human kind. According to him, the foundation of natural theory of law is to world has a goal and aim finally. On the basis of principle of having goal, the God creates the world for the sake of human kind and they have potential right to change the world therefore human kind have right prior to introducing in society.&lt;ref&gt;life's outcome, A survey of Motahari's Ideas.p.401-410.vol.1,1386 solar&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy of religion===
Motahari refers to the concept of Maktab or school when he intends to define the word of religion. According to him maktab is a thoughtful disciplined system including ideology and View in terms of ethics, politics, economy and civil law and etc. Finally, he defines religion as a collection of knowledge bestowed to human for the sake of guiding him and also religion is a collection of beliefs, moralities and individual and collective judgments. Therefore, he knows religion and its teaching as beliefs, moralities and judgments. Also Motahari believes that the domain of religion at all is not limited to life but concerned with after afterlife. He believes that Islam as a religion is consistent with life of human and there is no room for denying it.&lt;ref&gt;Ryaz Ahmaddar,religion and political and social system from Motahari and Iqbal Lahouri, Tolou Magazine, 2007, 21, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Western philosophy===
[[Dariush Shayegan]] believes that Motahari confused the [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|hegelian]] thought and [[Walter Terence Stace|Stace]]'s quotations in confronting with Hegel. According to Shaygan since each of Motahari and hegel belong to different paradigms, there is no common world between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EKmws3uvj6YC|title=Cultural Schizophrenia: Islamic Societies Confronting the West|first=Darius|last=Shayegan|date=1 January 1997|publisher=Syracuse University Press|accessdate=19 August 2016|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Epistemology==
He considered [[Marxism]] as a great threat for youths and [[Iranian Revolution|revolution of Iran]] therefore he tried to criticize Marxism along with pioneer figures like shariati. Also his commentary on the book of Mulla Sadra influenced many scholars. Besides, he also emphasized on the social, cultural and historical contingencies of religious knowledge. Motahari  argued that if someone compares fatwas belong to different jurists and at the same time considers their lives and states of knowledge then it is clear that the presuppositions of jurists and its knowledge affected their knowledge. According to him, because of this reason, we observe that the fatwa belong to Arab has an Arab flavor and the fatwa belong to non-Arab has an Ajam flavor. Also He tried to compare Quran with nature. He also believed that the contemporary interpretations of Quran were considerable than Ancient rendition of Islam because the future generation has a better understanding of Quran and Also a deeper appreciation of it. But At the same Time he doesn’t believe in epistemological pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;Behrooz Ghamari-Tabrizi, Abdolkarim Soroush,The Oxford Handbook of Islam and Politics, Edited by John L.

'''Richard McKay Rorty''' (October 4, 1931 – June 8, 2007) was an [[American philosopher]].  Educated at the [[University of Chicago]] and [[Yale University]], he had strong interests and training in both the [[history of philosophy]] and contemporary [[analytic philosophy]], the latter of which came to comprise the main focus of his work at [[Princeton University]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rorty/#1&lt;/ref&gt;  He subsequently came to reject the tradition of philosophy according to which knowledge involves correct representation (a "mirror of nature") of a world whose existence remains wholly independent of that representation. Rorty had a long and diverse academic career, including positions as Stuart Professor of Philosophy at [[Princeton University]], Kenan Professor of Humanities at the [[University of Virginia]], and Professor of [[Comparative Literature]] at [[Stanford University]]. Among his most influential books are ''[[Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature]]'' (1979), ''Consequences of Pragmatism'' (1982), and ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'' (1989).

Rorty saw the idea of knowledge as a "mirror of nature" as pervasive throughout the history of [[western philosophy]]. Against this approach, Rorty advocated for a novel form of [[American pragmatism]], sometimes called [[neopragmatism]], in which scientific and philosophical methods form merely a set of [[contingency (philosophy)|contingent]] "[[final vocabulary|vocabularies]]" which people abandon or adopt over time according to social conventions and usefulness. Abandoning [[representationalist]] accounts of knowledge and language, Rorty believed, would lead to a state of mind he referred to as "[[ironist|ironism]]", in which people become completely aware of the contingency of their placement in history and of their philosophical vocabulary. Rorty tied this brand of philosophy to the notion of "social hope"; he believed that without the representationalist accounts, and without metaphors between the mind and the world, human society would behave more peacefully. He also emphasized the reasons why the interpretation of culture as conversation ([[Richard J. Bernstein|Bernstein]] 1971), constitutes the crucial concept of a "[[postphilosophy|postphilosophical]]" culture determined to abandon representationalist accounts of traditional epistemology, incorporating American pragmatist [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] that considers the natural sciences as an advance towards [[liberalism]].

==Biography==
Richard Rorty was born on October 4, 1931, in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/309903.html |title=Richard Rorty: The Making of an American Philosopher |publisher=press.uchicago.edu |date=1931-10-04 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, [[James Rorty|James]] and Winifred Rorty, were activists, writers and social democrats. His maternal grandfather, [[Walter Rauschenbusch]], was a central figure in the [[Social Gospel]] movement of the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/10/AR2007061001268.html |title=Richard Rorty, 75; Leading U.S. Pragmatist Philosopher |publisher=washingtonpost.com |author=Bernstein, Adam|date=11 June 2007 |accessdate=26 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His father experienced two nervous breakdowns in his later life. The second breakdown, which he had in the early 1960s, was more serious and "included claims to divine prescience."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Bruce Kuklick. "Neil Gross, Richard Rorty: The Making of an American Philosopher." ''Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society'' 47.1 (2011):36.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, Richard Rorty fell into depression as a teenager and in 1962 began a six-year psychiatric analysis for obsessional neurosis.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; Rorty wrote about the beauty of rural New Jersey orchids in his short autobiography, "Trotsky and the Wild Orchids." His colleague [[Jürgen Habermas]]'s obituary for Rorty points out that Rorty's contrasting childhood experiences, such as beautiful orchids versus reading a book in his parents' house that defended [[Leon Trotsky]] against [[Stalin]], created an early interest in philosophy. He describes Rorty as an ironist:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Nothing is sacred to Rorty the ironist. Asked at the end of his life about the 'holy', the strict [[atheist]] answered with words reminiscent of the young [[Hegel]]: 'My sense of the holy is bound up with the hope that some day my remote descendants will live in a global civilization in which love is pretty much the only law.'&lt;ref name="signandsight1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signandsight.com/features/1386.html |title=Jürgen Habermas: Philosopher, poet and friend (12/06/2007) |publisher=signandsight |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rorty enrolled at the [[University of Chicago]] shortly before turning 15, where he received a bachelor's and a master's degree in philosophy (studying under [[Richard McKeon]]),&lt;ref&gt;Marchetti, Giancarlo.

After two years in the [[United States Army]], he taught at [[Wellesley College]] for three years until 1961.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rorty/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Rorty divorced his wife and then married [[Stanford University]] [[bioethicist]] [[Mary Varney Rorty]] in 1972. They had two children, Kevin and Patricia. While Richard Rorty was a "strict atheist" (Habermas),&lt;ref name="signandsight1"/&gt; Mary Varney Rorty was a practicing Mormon.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Rorty was a professor of philosophy at [[Princeton University]] for 21 years.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu"/&gt; In 1981, he was a recipient of a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellowship]], commonly known as the "Genius Award," in its first year of awarding, and in 1982 he became Kenan Professor of the Humanities at the [[University Of Virginia]].&lt;ref name=nyto&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/11/obituaries/11rorty.html?_r=3&amp;ref=obituaries&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin "Richard Rorty, Philosopher, Dies at 75"] (NY Times Obituary), June 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 Rorty became professor of [[comparative literature]] (and philosophy, by courtesy), at [[Stanford University]], where he spent the remainder of his academic career.&lt;ref name=nyto/&gt; During this period he was especially popular, and once quipped that he had been assigned to the position of "transitory professor of trendy studies."&lt;ref&gt;Ryerson, James. [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/22/books/review/Ryerson-t.html?em&amp;ex=1185163200&amp;en=b5c7e421ef8aa6b6&amp;ei=5087%0A "Essay: Thinking Cheerfully."] ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''. July 22, 2007: p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rorty's doctoral dissertation, ''The Concept of Potentiality'' was an historical study of the concept, completed under the supervision of [[Paul Weiss (philosopher)|Paul Weiss]], but his first book (as editor), ''The Linguistic Turn'' (1967), was firmly in the prevailing [[analytic philosophy|analytic]] mode, collecting classic essays on the [[linguistic turn]] in analytic philosophy. However, he gradually became acquainted with the American philosophical movement known as [[pragmatism]], particularly the writings of [[John Dewey]]. The noteworthy work being done by analytic philosophers such as [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] caused significant shifts in his thinking, which were reflected in his next book, ''[[Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature]]'' (1979).

[[Pragmatists]] generally hold that the meaning of a proposition is determined by its use in linguistic practice. Rorty combined pragmatism about truth and other matters with a [[Philosophical Investigations|later]] [[Wittgenstein]]ian [[philosophy of language]] which declares that [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] is a social-linguistic product, and sentences do not 'link up' with the world in a correspondence relation. Rorty wrote in his ''[[Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity]]'' (1989):

&lt;blockquote&gt;Truth cannot be out there—cannot exist independently of the human mind—because sentences cannot so exist, or be out there. The world is out there, but descriptions of the world are not. Only descriptions of the world can be true or false. The world on its own unaided by the describing activities of humans cannot."(5)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Views like this led Rorty to question many of philosophy's most basic assumptions—and have also led to him being apprehended as a postmodern/deconstructionist philosopher. Indeed, from the late 1980s through the 1990s, Rorty focused on the [[Continental philosophy|continental philosophical tradition]], examining the works of [[Friederich Nietzsche]], [[Martin Heidegger]], [[Michel Foucault]], [[Jean-François Lyotard]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. His work from this period included ''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity'', ''Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers'' (1991) and ''Truth and Progress: Philosophical Papers'' (1998). The latter two works attempt to bridge the dichotomy between analytic and continental philosophy by claiming that the two traditions complement rather than oppose each other.

According to Rorty, analytic philosophy may not have lived up to its pretensions and may not have solved the puzzles it thought it had. Yet such philosophy, in the process of finding reasons for putting those pretensions and puzzles aside, helped earn itself an important place in the history of ideas. By giving up on the quest for [[apodictic]]ity and finality that [[Edmund Husserl]] shared with [[Rudolf Carnap]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], and by finding new reasons for thinking that such quest will never succeed, analytic philosophy cleared a path that leads past [[scientism]], just as the [[idealism|German idealists]] cleared a path that led around [[empiricism]].

In the last fifteen years of his life, Rorty continued to publish his writings, including four volumes of his archived philosophical papers, ''[[Achieving Our Country]]'' (1998), a political manifesto partly based on readings of Dewey and [[Walt Whitman]] in which he defended the idea of a [[Progressivism|progressive]], pragmatic left against what he feels are defeatist, anti-liberal, anti-humanist positions espoused by the critical left and continental school. Rorty felt these anti-humanist positions were personified by figures like Nietzsche, Heidegger, and Foucault. Such theorists were also guilty of an "inverted Platonism" in which they attempted to craft overarching, metaphysical, "sublime" philosophies—which in fact contradicted their core claims to be ironist and contingent. Rorty's last works, after his move to Stanford University, focused on the place of [[religion]] in contemporary life, liberal communities, comparative literature and philosophy as "cultural politics."

Shortly before his death, he wrote a piece called "The Fire of Life," (published in the November 2007 issue of ''[[Poetry (magazine)|Poetry]]'' magazine),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.poetryfoundation.org/article/180185 | title=The Fire of Life | author=Rorty, Richard | journal=Poetry magazine |date=November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he meditates on his diagnosis and the comfort of poetry. He concludes, "I now wish that I had spent somewhat more of my life with verse. This is not because I fear having missed out on truths that are incapable of statement in prose. There are no such truths; there is nothing about death that [[Swinburne]] and [[Walter Savage Landor|Landor]] knew but [[Epicurus]] and Heidegger failed to grasp. Rather, it is because I would have lived more fully if I had been able to rattle off more old chestnuts—just as I would have if I had made more close friends. Cultures with richer vocabularies are more fully human—farther removed from the beasts—than those with poorer ones; individual men and women are more fully human when their memories are amply stocked with verses."

On June 8, 2007, Rorty died in his home from [[pancreatic cancer]].&lt;ref name=sa/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyto/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telospress.com/main/index.php?main_page=news_article&amp;article_id=188 "Richard Rorty,"] (short obituary), June 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==

===''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature''===
{{main|Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature}}
In ''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature'' (1979), Rorty argues that the central problems of modern [[epistemology]] depend upon a picture of the mind as trying to faithfully represent (or "mirror") a mind-independent, external reality. If we give up this metaphor, then the entire enterprise of [[anti-foundationalism|foundationalist epistemology]] is misguided. A foundationalist believes that in order to avoid the regress inherent in claiming that all beliefs are justified by other beliefs, some beliefs must be self-justifying and form the foundations to all knowledge.

There were two senses of "foundationalism" criticized in ''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature''. In the epistemological sense, Rorty criticized the attempt to justify knowledge claims by tracing them to a set of foundations (e.g., self-evident premises or noninferential sensations); more broadly, he criticized the claim of philosophy to function foundationally within a culture. The former argument draws on Sellars's critique of the idea that there is a "given" in sensory perception, in combination with Quine's [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism|critique]] of the distinction between analytic sentences (sentences which are true solely in virtue of what they mean) and synthetic sentences (sentences made true by the world). Each critique, taken alone, provides a problem for a conception of how philosophy ought to proceed, yet leaves enough of the tradition intact to proceed with its former aspirations. Combined, Rorty claimed, the two critiques are devastating. With no privileged insight into the structure of belief and no privileged realm of truths of meaning, we have, instead, knowledge as those beliefs that pay their way. The only worthwhile description of the actual process of inquiry, Rorty claimed, was a [[Thomas S. Kuhn|Kuhnian]] account of the standard phases of the progress of disciplines, oscillating through [[normal science|normal]] and abnormal periods, between routine problem-solving and intellectual crises.

After rejecting foundationalism, Rorty argues that one of the few roles left for a philosopher is to act as an intellectual gadfly, attempting to induce a revolutionary break with previous practice, a role that Rorty was happy to take on himself. Rorty suggests that each generation tries to subject all disciplines to the model that the most successful discipline of the day employs. In Rorty's view, the success of modern science has led academics in philosophy and the humanities to mistakenly imitate scientific methods. ''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature'' popularized and extended ideas of [[Wilfrid Sellars]] (the critique of the [[Myth of the given]]) and [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] (the critique of the [[analytic-synthetic distinction]]) and others who advocate the Wittgensteinian doctrine of "dissolving" rather than solving philosophical problems.

===''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity''===
{{main|Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity}}
In ''Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity'' (1989), Rorty abandons specifically analytic modes of explication in favor of narrative pastiche in order to develop an alternative conceptual vocabulary to that of the "Platonists" he rejects. This schema is based on the belief that there is no worthwhile theory of truth, aside from a non-epistemic semantic one (as [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] developed out of the work of [[Alfred Tarski]]). Rorty suggests that the task of philosophy should be distinguished along public and private lines. Private philosophers, who provide one with greater abilities to (re)create oneself, a view adapted from Nietzsche and which Rorty also identifies with the novels of [[Marcel Proust]] and [[Vladimir Nabokov]], should not be expected to help with public problems. For a [[public philosophy]], one might turn to [[John Rawls|Rawls]] or [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas]].

This book also marks his first attempt to specifically articulate a political vision consistent with his philosophy, the vision of a diverse community bound together by opposition to cruelty, and not by abstract ideas such as 'justice' or 'common humanity,' policed by the separation of the public and private realms of life.

In this book, Rorty introduces the terminology of [[Ironism]], which he uses to describe his mindset and his philosophy.

===''Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth''===
Amongst the essays in ''Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth: Philosophical Papers, Volume 1'' (1990), is "The Priority of Democracy to Philosophy," in which Rorty defends Rawls against communitarian critics. Rorty argues that liberalism can "get along without philosophical presuppositions," while at the same time conceding to communitarians that "a conception of the self that makes the community constitutive of the self does comport well with liberal democracy."&lt;ref&gt;''Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth: Philosophical Papers, Volume 1'' (1990), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;  For Rorty, social institutions ought to be thought of as "experiments in cooperation rather than as attempts to embody a universal and ahistorical order."&lt;ref&gt;''Objectivity, Relativism, and Truth: Philosophical Papers, Volume 1'' (1990), p. 196&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Essays on Heidegger and Others''===
In this text, Rorty focuses primarily on the continental philosophers Heidegger and Derrida. He argues that these European "post-Nietzscheans" share much with American pragmatists, in that they critique metaphysics and reject the correspondence theory of truth. When discussing Derrida, Rorty claims that Derrida is most useful when viewed as a funny writer who attempted to circumvent the Western philosophical tradition, rather than the inventor of a philosophical (or literary) "method." In this vein, Rorty criticizes Derrida's followers like [[Paul de Man]] for taking deconstructive literary theory too seriously.

===''Achieving Our Country''===
{{main|Achieving Our Country}}
In ''Achieving Our Country: Leftist Thought in Twentieth-Century America'' (1997), Rorty differentiates between what he sees as the two sides of the Left, a cultural Left and a progressive Left. He criticizes the cultural Left, which is exemplified by post-structuralists such as Foucault and postmodernists such as Lyotard, for offering critiques of society, but no alternatives (or alternatives that are so vague and general as to be abdications). Although these intellectuals make insightful claims about the ills of society, Rorty suggests that they provide no alternatives and even occasionally deny the possibility of progress. On the other hand, the progressive Left, exemplified for Rorty by the [[pragmatism|pragmatist]] Dewey, Whitman and James Baldwin, makes hope for a better future its priority. Without hope, Rorty argues, change is spiritually inconceivable and the cultural Left has begun to breed cynicism. Rorty sees the progressive Left as acting in the philosophical spirit of pragmatism.

==On human rights==
Rorty's notion of [[human rights]] is [[Grounding (metaphysics)|grounded]] on the notion of [[sentimentality]]. He contended that throughout history humans have devised various means of construing certain groups of individuals as inhuman or subhuman. Thinking in rationalist (foundationalist) terms will not solve this problem, he claimed. Rorty advocated the creation of a culture of global human rights in order to stop violations from happening through a sentimental education. He argued that we should create a sense of [[empathy]] or teach empathy to others so as to understand others' suffering.&lt;ref&gt;See Barreto, José-Manuel. [http://www.utrechtlawreview.org/index.php/ulr/article/viewFile/164/163 "Rorty and Human Rights: Contingency, Emotions and How to Defend Human Rights Telling Stories."] Utrecht Law Review, Volume 7 Issue 2 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and criticism==
Rorty is among the most widely discussed and controversial contemporary philosophers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rorty/ (Last sentence of the introduction)]&lt;/ref&gt; and his works have provoked thoughtful responses from many other well-respected figures in the field. In [[Robert Brandom]]'s anthology, entitled ''Rorty and His Critics'', for example, Rorty's philosophy is discussed by [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Hilary Putnam]], [[John McDowell]], [[Jacques Bouveresse]], and [[Daniel Dennett]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0631209824 Amazon.com: Rorty and His Critics (Philosophers and their Critics): Robert B. Brandom: Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, [[Roger Scruton]] wrote, "Rorty was paramount among those thinkers who advance their own opinion as immune to criticism, by pretending that it is not truth but consensus that counts, while defining the consensus in terms of people like themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opendemocracy.net/democracy_power/people/richard_rorty_legacy |title=Richard Rorty's legacy |author=Scruton, Roger|publisher=openDemocracy |date=2007-06-12 |accessdate=2012-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph Marvin Tumaob concludes that Rorty was really influenced by the notion of  [[Jean-François Lyotard]]'s Metanarratives, and by this he further added that "postmodernism was influenced further by the works of Rorty".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=|title=System of Rorty|url=https://syntheticzero.net/2016/10/18/rortys-philosophy-the-mirror-of-nature-pdf/|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John McDowell]] is strongly influenced by Rorty, particularly by Rorty's ''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;In the preface to ''Mind and World'' (pp. ix–x) McDowell states that "it will be obvious that Rorty's work is [...] central for the way I define my stance here".&lt;/ref&gt; In continental philosophy, authors such as [[Jürgen Habermas]], [[Gianni Vattimo]], [[Jacques Derrida]], [[Albrecht Wellmer]], [[Hans Joas]], [[Chantal Mouffe]], [[Simon Critchley]], [[Esa Saarinen]], and [[Mike Sandbothe]] are influenced in different ways by Rorty's thinking. American novelist [[David Foster Wallace]] titled a short story in his collection ''[[Oblivion: Stories]]'' "Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature", and critics have attributed some of Wallace's writings on Irony to Rorty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Howard|first=Jennifer|title=The Afterlife of David Foster Wallace|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Afterlife-of-David-Foster/125823|publisher=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Susan Haack]] has been a fierce critic of Rorty's neopragmatism. Haack criticises Rorty's claim to be a pragmatist at all and wrote a short play called ''We Pragmatists'', where Rorty and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] have a fictional conversation using only accurate quotes from their own writing. For Haack, the only link between Rorty's neopragmatism and the pragmatism of Peirce is the name. Haack believes Rorty's neopragmatism is both anti-philosophical and anti-intellectual, and exposes people further to rhetorical manipulation.&lt;ref name="plato.stanford.edu" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/rortyism-haack-3261|title=Vulgar Rortyism|author=Susan Haack|authorlink=Susan Haack|date=November 1997|work=New Criterion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Blackwell |isbn = 0631118519 |publication-place = Oxford UK |title = Evidence and Inquiry |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL1398949M/Evidence_and_inquiry |first = Susan |last=Haack |authorlink=Susan Haack|year = 1993 |chapter=Ch. 9: Vulgar Pragmatism: an Unedifying Prospect}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Rorty was an avowed liberal, his political and moral philosophies have been attacked by commentators from the [[Left-wing politics|Left]], some of whom believe them to be insufficient frameworks for social justice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uwlax.edu/urc/JUR-online/PDF/2005/heyer.pdf "Objectivity and Action: Wal-Mart and the Legacy of Marx and Nietzsche"], A discussion of [[Terry Eagleton]]'s attacks on Rorty's philosophy as insufficient in the fight against corporations such as Wal-Mart&lt;/ref&gt; Rorty was also criticized by others for his rejection of the idea that science can depict the world.&lt;ref&gt;"The failure to recognize science's particular powers to depict reality, Daniel Dennett wrote, shows 'flatfooted ignorance of the proven methods of scientific truth-seeking and their power.'"[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/06/11/frontpage/obits.php]&lt;/ref&gt; One criticism, especially of ''Contingency, irony, and solidarity'' is that Rorty's philosophical 'hero', the [[ironist]], is an elitist figure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/EPS/PES-Yearbook/96_docs/reich.html Rob Reich – The Paradoxes of Education in Rorty's Liberal Utopia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615222748/http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/EPS/PES-Yearbook/96_docs/reich.html |date=2006-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rorty claims that the majority of people would be "commonsensically nominalist and historicist" but not ironist. These people would combine an ongoing attention to the particular as opposed to the transcendent ([[nominalism]]), with an awareness of their place in a continuum of contingent lived experience alongside other individuals ([[historicist]]), without necessarily having continual doubts about the resulting worldview as the ironist does. An ironist is someone who: 1) "has radical and continuing doubts about their final vocabulary"; 2) "realizes that argument phrased in their vocabulary can neither underwrite nor dissolve these doubts"; and 3) "does not think their vocabulary is closer to reality than others" (all 73, ''Contingency, irony, and solidarity''). On the other hand, the Italian philosopher [[Gianni Vattimo]] alongside the Spanish philosopher Santiago Zabala in their 2011 book ''[[Hermeneutic Communism|Hermeneutic Communism: from Heidegger to Marx]]'' affirm that "together with Richard Rorty we also consider it a flaw that 'the main thing contemporary academic Marxists inherit from Marx and Engels is the conviction that the quest for the cooperative commonwealth should be scientific rather than [[utopian]], knowing rather than [[Romanticism|romantic]].' As we will show hermeneutics contains all the utopian and romantic features that Rorty refers to because, contrary to the knowledge of science, it does not claim modern universality but rather postmodern particularism."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gianni Vattimo]] and Santiago Zabala. ''[[Hermeneutic Communism]]: From Heidegger to Marx'' Columbia University Press. 2011. Pgs. 2 and 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Rorty often draws on a broad range of other philosophers to support his views, and his interpretation of their works has been contested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/rorty/ Richard Rorty (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Since Rorty is working from a tradition of re-interpretation, he remains uninterested in 'accurately' portraying other thinkers, but rather in utilizing their work in the same way a literary critic might use a novel. His essay "The Historiography of Philosophy: Four Genres" is a thorough description of how he treats the greats in the history of philosophy. In ''Contingency, irony, and solidarity'', Rorty attempts to disarm those who criticize his writings by arguing that their philosophical criticisms are made using axioms that are explicitly rejected within Rorty's own philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. {{ISBN missing}}, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Rorty defines allegations of irrationality as affirmations of vernacular "otherness", and so—Rorty claims—accusations of irrationality can be expected during ''any'' argument and must simply be brushed aside.&lt;ref&gt;Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1989. p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Robinson Jeffers''' (January 10, 1887 – January 20, 1962) was an [[United States|American]] [[poet]], known for his work about the central [[California]] coast. Much of Jeffers' poetry was written in [[narrative]] and [[Epic poetry|epic]] form.  However, he is also known for his shorter verse and is considered an icon of the [[environmentalism|environmental]] movement. Influential and highly regarded in some circles, despite or because of his philosophy of "inhumanism", Jeffers believed that transcending conflict required human concerns to be de-emphasized in favor of the boundless whole. This led him to oppose U.S. participation in World War II, a stance that was controversial after the U.S. entered the war.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

==Life==
Jeffers was born in [[Allegheny, Pennsylvania]] (now part of [[Pittsburgh]]), the son of Reverend Dr. William Hamilton Jeffers, a [[Presbyterian]] minister and scholar of ancient languages and Biblical history, and Annie Robinson Tuttle. His brother was [[Hamilton Jeffers]], a well-known astronomer who worked at [[Lick Observatory]]. Jeffers traveled through Europe during his youth and attended school in [[Germany]], [[France]], and [[Switzerland]]. An outstanding student, he was instructed in the [[classics]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Latin language|Latin]] language and literature. By age twelve, he was fluent in German and French as well as English. He earned his bachelor's degree from [[Occidental College]] at age 18. While attending college he was an avid outdoorsman and active in the school's literary societies.

After he graduated from Occidental, Jeffers went to the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) to study at first literature, and then medicine. He met Una Call Kuster in 1906; she was three years older than he was, a graduate student, and the wife of a Los Angeles attorney. Jeffers and Mrs. Kuster became lovers. [[Edward G. Kuster|Mr. Kuster]] discovered their affair in 1910. Jeffers dropped out of USC medical school and enrolled as a forestry student at the University of Washington in Seattle, a course of study that he abandoned after a semester, at which time he returned to Los Angeles. By 1912 the affair became a scandal, reaching the front page of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Una spent some time in Europe to quiet things down, then the lovers lived together by Lake Washington to await the completion of Una's divorce. The two were married in 1913, then moved to [[La Jolla, California]], and finally [[Carmel-by-the-Sea, California|Carmel, California]], where Jeffers constructed [[Tor House and Hawk Tower]]. The couple had a daughter who died a day after birth in 1913, and then twin sons (Donnan and Garth) in 1916. Una died of cancer in 1950. Jeffers died in 1962; an obituary can be found in the ''[[New York Times]]'', January 22, 1962.

[[File:Robinson Jeffers Hawk Tower, Tor House, Carmel, CA 2008 Photo by Celeste Davison.JPG|thumb|left|Hawk Tower in Carmel]]
In the 1920s and 1930s, at the height of his popularity, Jeffers was famous for being a tough outdoorsman, living in relative solitude and writing of the difficulty and beauty of the wild. He spent most of his life in Carmel, California, in a granite house that he had built himself called "[[Tor House and Hawk Tower]]". ''[[Tor (rock formation)|Tor]]'' is a term for a craggy outcrop or lookout. Before Jeffers and Una purchased the land where Tor House would be built, they rented two cottages in Carmel, and enjoyed many afternoon walks and picnics at the "tors" near the site that would become Tor House.

To build the first part of Tor House, a small, two story cottage, Jeffers hired a local builder, Michael Murphy. He worked with Murphy, and in this short, informal apprenticeship, he learned the art of stonemasonry. He continued adding on to Tor House throughout his life, writing in the mornings and working on the house in the afternoon. Many of his poems reflect the influence of stone and building on his life.

He later built a large four-story stone tower on the site called Hawk Tower.  While he had not visited Ireland at this point in his life, it is possible that Hawk Tower is based on Francis Joseph Bigger's [[Jordan's Castle|'Castle Séan']] at Ardglass, County Down, which had also in turn influenced Yeats' choice of a poets tower, [[Thoor Ballylee]]. Construction on Tor House continued into the late 1950s and early 1960s, and was completed by his eldest son. The completed residence was used as a family home until his descendants decided to turn it over to the Tor House Foundation, formed by [[Ansel Adams]], for historic preservation. The romantic Gothic tower was named after a hawk that appeared while Jeffers was working on the structure, and which disappeared the day it was completed. The tower was a gift for his wife Una, who had a fascination for Irish literature and stone towers. In Una's special room on the second floor were kept many of her favorite items, photographs of Jeffers taken by the artist Weston, plants and dried flowers from Shelley's grave, and a rosewood [[Melodeon (organ)|melodeon]] which she loved to play. The tower also included a secret interior staircase – a source of great fun for his young sons.

During this time, Jeffers published volumes of long narrative blank verse that shook up the national literary scene. These poems, including ''Tamar'' and ''Roan Stallion'', introduced Jeffers as a master of the [[Epic poetry|epic]] form, reminiscent of ancient Greek poets. These poems were full of controversial subject matter such as incest, murder and [[parricide]]. Jeffers' short verse includes "Hurt Hawks," "The Purse-Seine" and "Shine, Perishing Republic." His intense relationship with the physical world is described in often brutal and apocalyptic verse, and demonstrates a preference for the natural world over what he sees as the negative influence of civilization. Jeffers did not accept the idea that [[Meter (poetry)|meter]] is a fundamental part of poetry, and, like [[Marianne Moore]], claimed his verse was not composed in meter, but "rolling stresses." He believed meter was imposed on poetry by man and not a fundamental part of its nature.

[[Image:Rjeffersstamp.jpg|thumb|Robinson Jeffers U.S. postage stamp – 1973]]

Many books followed Jeffers' initial success with the epic form, including an adaptation of Euripides' ''Medea'', which became a hit [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] play starring [[Judith Anderson|Dame Judith Anderson]]. [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Edgar Lee Masters]], [[Benjamin De Casseres]], and [[George Sterling]] were close friends of Jeffers, Sterling having the longest and most intimate relationship with him. While living in Carmel, Jeffers became the focal point for a small but devoted group of admirers. At the peak of his fame, he was one of the few poets to be featured on the cover of ''[[Time Magazine]]''. He was also asked to read at the [[Library of Congress]], and was posthumously put on a U.S. postage stamp.

Part of the decline of Jeffers' popularity was due to his staunch opposition to the United States' entering [[World War II]]. In fact, his book ''The Double Axe and Other Poems'' (1948), a volume of poems that was largely critical of U.S. policy, came with an extremely unconventional note from [[Random House]] that the views expressed by Jeffers were not those of the publishing company. Soon after, his work was received negatively by several influential literary critics. Several particularly scathing pieces were penned by [[Yvor Winters]], as well as by [[Kenneth Rexroth]], who had been very positive in his earlier commentary on Jeffers' work. Jeffers would publish poetry intermittently during the 1950s but his poetry never again attained the same degree of popularity that it had in the 1920s and the 1930s.

===Inhumanism===
Jeffers coined the word ''inhumanism'', the belief that [[human|mankind]] is too self-centered and too indifferent to the "astonishing beauty of things." In the famous poem "Carmel Point," Jeffers called on humans to "uncenter" themselves.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/g_l/jeffers/life.htm Robinson Jeffers' Life and Career]&lt;/ref&gt; In "The Double Axe," Jeffers explicitly described inhumanism as "a shifting of emphasis and significance from man to notman; the rejection of human [[solipsism]] and recognition of the trans-human magnificence. ... This manner of thought and feeling is neither misanthropic nor pessimist. ... It offers a reasonable detachment as rule of conduct, instead of love, hate and envy ... it provides magnificence for the religious instinct, and satisfies our need to admire greatness and rejoice in beauty."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffers, Robinson. The Double Axe and Other Poems. New York: Liverlight, 1977. Print. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Loyalties of Robinson Jeffers'',the  first in-depth study of Jeffers not written by one of his circle, poet and critic [[James Radcliffe Squires|J. Radcliffe Squires]] addresses the question of a reconciliation of the beauty of the world and potential beauty in mankind: "Jeffers has asked us to look squarely at the universe.  He has told us that materialism has its message, its relevance, and its solace.  These are different from the message, relevance, and solace of humanism.  Humanism teaches us best why we suffer, but materialism teaches us how to suffer." &lt;ref&gt;Squires, Radcliffe.  The Loyalties of Robinson Jeffers, University of Michigan Press, Ann Arbor, 1956, pages 190-191.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
His poems have been translated into many languages and published all over the world. Outside of the United States he is most popular in [[Japan]] and the [[Czech Republic]]. [[William Everson]], [[Edward Abbey]], [[Robert McDowell (poet)|Robert McDowell]], [[Gary Snyder]], and [[Mark Jarman]] are just a few recent authors who have been influenced by Jeffers. [[Charles Bukowski]] remarked that Jeffers was his favorite poet. Polish poet [[Czesław Miłosz]] also took an interest in Jeffers' poetry and worked as a translator for several volumes of his poems. Jeffers also exchanged some letters with his Czech translator and popularizer, the poet [[Kamil Bednář]].  Writer [[Paul Mooney (writer)|Paul Mooney]] (1904–1939), son of American Indian authority [[James Mooney]] (1861–1921) and collaborator of travel writer [[Richard Halliburton]] (1900–1939), "was known always to carry with him (a volume of Jeffers) as a chewer might carry a pouch of tobacco ... and, like Jeffers," writes Gerry Max in ''Horizon Chasers'', "worshipped nature ... (taking) refuge (from the encroachments of civilization) in a sort of chthonian mysticism rife with Greek dramatic elements ..."&lt;ref&gt;Gerry Max, ''Horizon Chasers – The Lives and Adventures of Richard Halliburton and Paul Mooney'' (McFarland, c2007), pp. 80-82, qtd. at p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffers was an inspiration and friend to western U.S. photographers of the early twentieth century, including [[Ansel Adams]], [[Edward Weston]], and [[Morley Baer]]. In fact, the elegant book of Baer's photographs juxtaposed with Jeffers' poetry,&lt;ref&gt;''Stones of the Sur: Poetry by Robinson Jeffers, Photographs by Morley Baer'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; combines the creative talents of those two residents of the Big Sur coast.

Although Jeffers has largely been marginalized in the mainstream academic community over the last thirty years, several important contemporary literary critics, including [[Albert Gelpi]] of [[Stanford University]], and poet, critic and [[National Endowment for the Arts|NEA]] chairman [[Dana Gioia]], have consistently cited Jeffers as a formidable presence in modern literature.

His poem "The Beaks of Eagles" was included in the track "California Saga" on [[The Beach Boys]] album ''[[Holland (album)|Holland]]'' (1973).

Two lines from Jeffers' poem "We Are Those People" are quoted toward the end of the 2008 film ''[[Visioneers]]''.

Several lines from Jeffers' poem "Wise Men in Their Bad Hours" ("Death's a fierce meadowlark: but to die having made / Something more equal to the centuries / Than muscle and bone, is mostly to shed weakness.") appear in [[Christopher McCandless]]' diary.

Robinson Jeffers is mentioned in the 2004 film ''[[I Heart Huckabees]]'' by the character Albert Markovski played by Jason Schwartzman, when defending Jeffers as a nature writer against another character's claim that environmentalism is socialism. Markovski says, "Henry David Thoreau, Robinson Jeffers, the National Geographic Society...all socialists?"

A passage from Jeffers' poem "Ghost" was read in the [[Ghost Adventures]] episode "Tor House", where the Ghost Adventures crew investigated Jeffers' [[Tor House|house]] to see if Jeffers' spirit would appear 50 years later after his death, as was said in his poem.

In ''[[A Secular Age]]'', a critique of Western [[secularization]], philosopher [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]] presents Jeffers as an important literary example of "immanent [[anti-humanism]]" alongside figures such as [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Cormac McCarthy]]. Invoking (often at length) the poems "At the Birth of an Age," "Invasion," "Rock and Hawk," "Tamar," and "The Women at Point Sur," Taylor sees Jeffers as encouraging human beings to embrace the beautiful cruelty of an indifferent universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Charles|title=A Secular Age|date=2007|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=665–667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Poet Adrienne Rich &lt;ref&gt;Adrienne Rich&lt;/ref&gt; quotes Jeffers's poem "Prelude" in her poem "Yom Kippur 1984"

==Further reading and research==
[[Stanford University Press]] released a five-volume collection of the complete works of Robinson Jeffers. In an article titled, "A Black Sheep Joins the Fold", written upon the release of the collection in 2001, ''Stanford Magazine'' commented that it was remarkable that, due to a number of circumstances, "there was never an authoritative, scholarly edition of California's premier bard"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2001/novdec/showcase/chapter.html Cynthia Haven, "A Black Sheep Joins the Fold," ''Stanford Magazine'', November/December 2001]&lt;/ref&gt;  until the complete works published by Stanford.

In a rare recording, Jeffers can be heard reading his "The Day Is A Poem" (September 19, 1939) on ''Poetry Speaks – Hear Great Poets Read Their Work from Tennyson to Plath'', Narrated by Charles Osgood (Sourcebooks, Inc., c2001), Disc 1, #41; including text, with Robert Hass on Robinson Jeffers, pp.&amp;nbsp;88–95.  Jeffers was also on the cover of ''Time – The Weekly Magazine'', April 4, 1932 (pictured on p.&amp;nbsp;90. ''Poetry Speaks'').

''Jeffers Studies'', a journal of research on the poetry of Robinson Jeffers and related topics, is published semi-annually by the Robinson Jeffers Association.

'''''Sexual Desire: A Philosophical Investigation''''', published as '''''Sexual Desire: A Moral Philosophy of the Erotic''''' in the United States, is a 1986 book about the [[philosophy of sex]] by the philosopher [[Roger Scruton]], in which the author discusses [[sexual desire]] and erotic [[love]], arguing against the idea that the former expresses the animal part of human nature while the latter is an expression of its rational side. The book was first published in the United Kingdom by [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]], and in the United States by [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]].

Scruton draws upon both [[analytic philosophy]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], a philosophical movement founded by [[Edmund Husserl]]. Borrowing the term from phenomenology, he argues that sexual desire is characterised by "[[intentionality]]", the quality "of pointing to, and delineating, an object of thought". He makes the case that common experiences related to sex, such as [[obscenity]], modesty and shame, falling in love, and jealousy, involve intentionality. He defends traditional sexual morality, but rather than basing his arguments on religion, he writes from a secular perspective, following an approach suggested by [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''. He upholds the traditional condemnation of lust (which he defines as sexual desire "from which the goal of erotic love has been excluded") and perversion (which he defines as "a diverting of the sexual impulse from its interpersonal goal"). In his view, sexual perversion involves failure to recognise "the personal existence of the other", and this justifies its moral condemnation. He argues that [[homosexuality]] is a perversion, as is a form of [[masturbation]]. He argues that science cannot provide substitute for the concepts which order everyday experience and that it may potentially harm people's understanding of human sexual desire. He criticises [[Sigmund Freud]], arguing that psychoanalytic theory unacceptably depends on metaphor and that its scientific status is questionable. He also criticises [[feminism]] and the work of the biologist [[Alfred Kinsey]], describing it as reductive and as involving misrepresentation of sexual arousal and desire.

The book received positive reactions from some reviewers and unfavourable reactions from others. It has been called a classic work, and has been praised for providing insightful or appealing accounts of topics such as jealousy, [[Sadomasochism|sado-masochism]], sexual arousal, love and sexual desire, for its criticism of Freud, and for its originality. A noted example of a work by a philosopher who argues that sex is morally acceptable only if it involves love and intimacy, it has been considered one of the most important works in the philosophy of sex and has influenced subsequent discussions of [[sexual ethics]]. However, many of Scruton's conclusions were controversial. ''Sexual Desire'' has been criticised for Scruton's claim that sexual desire essentially aims at an individual person, his defense of conservative moral views, his arguments against feminism, his treatment of sexual behaviours such as homosexuality and masturbation and theories such as [[psychoanalysis]] and [[sociobiology]], his use of the concept of intentionality, his interpretation of the British political tradition, and his understanding of science. Some reviewers wrote that the book contains errors of fact, would be difficult for people who are not philosophers to read, and presented arguments that were unlikely to convince readers not already in agreement with Scruton.

==Summary==
[[File:Roger Scruton (1).jpg|thumb|upright|Roger Scruton]]

===Philosophical background===
Scruton discusses sexual desire and erotic love, and the views that philosophers have held of these topics. He argues against [[Plato]]'s view that sexual desire expresses the animal part of human nature while erotic love is an expression of its rational side, and tries to provide a philosophical basis for sexual morality and to defend traditional moral views on a secular basis. He draws upon both [[analytic philosophy]] and [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], despite some disagreements with its founder [[Edmund Husserl]], and discusses the distinction between categories that involve "functional significance" and those that involve "explanatory power", respectively "functional and [[natural kind]]s." He argues that science aims to discover natural kinds, since only they make it possible to explain the world; in contrast, many concepts used in everyday life are not explanatory, or at least not primarily explanatory, but rather "divide the world in accordance with out interests" and "mark out possibilities of action." He adopts the term "[[intentionality]]" from phenomenology, using it to refer to the quality, contained in human consciousness, "of pointing to, and delineating, an object of thought." He also makes use of the term, often used by phenomenologists, "''Lebenswelt''", or "[[Lifeworld]]", which refers to the world described with the "concepts that designate the intentional objects of human experience."{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=vii, 1–8}}
[[Image:Edmund Husserl 1910s.jpg|thumb|upright|Edmund Husserl, the founder of the philosophical movement of phenomenology. Scruton draws upon phenomenology, despite disagreements with Husserl.]]

According to Scruton, science cannot provide substitutes for "the concepts which order and direct our everyday experience" and may potentially harm our understanding of human sexual desire. Scruton argues that philosophy and religion must help to sustain everyday concepts, such as that of the human person, when science threatens to undermine them. He attempts to "restore the concept of sexual desire to its rightful place" in the description of the lifeworld and show "why a science of sex can neither displace that concept nor illuminate the human phenomenon that it describes." Scruton is influenced by [[Immanuel Kant]] and his "distinction between person and thing", although he rejects Kant's theory of the "transcendental self", which "ascribes to persons a metaphysical core ... lying beyond nature and eternally free from its constraints."{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=8–10}} Scruton maintains that sexual experience is informed by some of the concepts which define the lifeworld, including "the concepts of innocence and guilt, normality and perversion, sacred and profane." He identifies the "three basic phenomena of human sexual feeling" as arousal, desire, and love and its important expressions as "glances, caresses and the act of love itself." In his view, sexual desire is a "social artefact" that must be built properly so that it can be fulfilled by "those who experience its normal forms", and that the "problem of sexual desire" is therefore ultimately "a political problem". He follows the example of [[Aristotle]] in the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' by moving "from the facts of human nature to the morality which they imply."{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=13–15}}

===Arousal===
[[Image:Sigmund Freud, by Max Halberstadt (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Sigmund Freud, the founder of psychoanalysis. Scruton argues that Freud's theories depend upon metaphor and as such are not genuinely scientific.]] 
Arousal is defined by Scruton as the state of [[mind]] in which "the body of one person awakens to the presence or thought of another." He maintains that sensations only qualify as sexual pleasure when they are "an integral part of sexual arousal." According to Scruton, it is arousal that transforms pleasurable sensations into sexual pleasure, which is characterised by intentionality. Scruton criticises views about sexual arousal expressed by authors such as [[Sigmund Freud]], the founder of psychoanalysis, and the biologist [[Alfred Kinsey]]. He refers to the [[Kinsey Reports]] as "exercises in reduction" because of their representation of sexual arousal as a bodily state, common to humans and non-human animals, which "so irritates those subject to it that they can find relief only in the sexual act" and whose "root phenomena" are "the [[erection]] of the penis or the softening of the vagina". He maintains that Freud's theory of the erotogenic zones paradoxically presents "the localised pleasures of the sexual act as the aim or object of desire", which in his view ignores both "the drama of sexual feeling" and "the fact of the other who is desired."{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=16–19}}

Scruton illustrates his view of the dependence of sexual pleasure and sexual arousal on the intentional object of experience with reference to the [[Bible]]'s account of [[Jacob]] and [[Leah]], and its retelling by the novelist [[Thomas Mann]] in ''[[Joseph and His Brothers]]'' (1933–1943), noting that Jacob did not "discover attractions in Leah that he had previously overlooked" and that "his pleasure in her was really pleasure in [[Rachel]], whom he wrongly thought to be the recipient of his embraces". He credits the philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] with providing, in ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (1943), "perhaps the most acute philosophical analysis of desire", citing Sartre's metaphorical suggestion that the caress "incarnates" the other. He also refers to the philosopher [[Thomas Nagel]]'s discussion of desire in ''Mortal Questions'' (1979), though unlike Nagel he holds that the intentionality exemplified by meaning is only sometimes, rather than always, found in glances of desire. He argues that obscenity "involves the attempt to divorce the sexual act from its interpersonal intentionality", or the directedness of sexual arousal. According to Scruton, the face has a key role in desire because it is "the primary expression of consciousness, and to see ''in the face'' the object of sexual arousal is to find the focus which all attraction requires".{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=20–24, 32, 394}}

===Desire===
According to Scruton, sexual desire does not originate in sexual arousal or have sexual arousal as its aim. He believes that while sexual arousal may seem to support the idea that desire is "a 'biological' fact, rooted in the life which we share with animals", it does not do so, because it is an interpersonal response founded in an epistemic intentionality and can be experienced only by people. He argues that though non-human animals experience sexual urges, they do not experience sexual desire. He attempts to defend this conclusion against potential criticism by clarifying the ideas of the animal and the person. In his view, the concept of the person is not a qualification of the concept of the animal, but a distinct concept with a differing purpose. Scruton outlines the history of the term "person", noting that in the theatre a ''[[persona]]'', originally a mask, came to stand for a theatrical character. ''Persona'' was then used in a more general sense, to refer to any representation of a human being, and in [[Roman law]] came to denote the "collection of rights and liabilities which the law courts could adjudicate, on behalf of the subject who appeared before them." Though he rejects the idea that the concept of legal personality can be used to distinguish what separates humans from non-human animals, he considers it relevant to understanding the concept of the person.{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=36, 40–41}}

[[Image:Alfred Kinsey 1955.jpg|thumb|upright|Sex researcher Alfred Kinsey. Scruton is critical of Kinsey's ideas about sexual arousal and behaviour.]]
Scruton believes that desire is characterised by intentionality. He argues that "desire expresses itself through patterns of deliberate activity" but can nevertheless be understood as an expression of human mental states only if "we recognise the central importance of the involuntary aspect of human behaviour", giving blushing, laughter, and the erection of the penis as examples. He sees the focus of desire as embodiment, which entails finding a unity between the body and the personal identity of the desired person. He criticises what he considers a common picture of the aim of sexual desire, according to which it begins in sexual arousal and has as its objective "pleasurable stimulus" and [[orgasm]]. He considers Kinsey and his co-authors the "most-simple minded" proponents of this view, writing that they unacceptably see orgasm as the aim of desire and "the presence of the other person as its occasion." He follows Sartre and Thomas Nagel in holding that the "attempt to assimilate sexual desire to appetite misses the interpersonal component of human sexual responses." He argues that ordinary language shows that the object of sexual desire is the "person himself", and that despite the possibility of mistakes of identity, it is part of the directed character of desire that its object is a particular person.{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=62–63, 66–67, 73–75, 79}}

In Scruton's view, "true sexual desire" has as its aim union with a "particular person, with a particular perspective upon my actions." According to him, a person who feels "randiness" and desires sex with a particular category of person but with no specific person within that category is "desiring to desire" and exchanges "the desire to desire for desire" when he encounters a person within the relevant category.{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=88, 90}} Scruton argues that common experiences related to sex, such as obscenity, modesty and shame, the meanings associated with the sexual organs, prostitution, falling in love, jealousy, [[Don Juanism]], and sado-masochism, involve intentionality. His discussion of love is partially informed by [[Stendhal]]'s views.{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=138, 140, 149, 156, 160, 162–167, 173}}

===Individuality===
Discussing the "metaphysical idea of individuality", Scruton considers six features of interpersonal attitudes, corresponding to six distinctions: those between the universal and the particular; between the reason-based, the reason-free, and the reason-involving; between the attentive and the non-attentive; between the purposeful and the purposeless; between the transferable and the non-transferable; and between the mediate and the immediate. He describes these distinctions to make sense of "the highly complex claim that some of our attitudes are directed towards individuals ''as'' individuals, and others towards individuals only ''as'' members of some class." He criticises Kant's ideas about love, desire, and morality, and the views of the philosophers [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. Scruton writes that Spinoza created an impersonal metaphysics in which "the 'self' and all its mysteries" vanish, and argues that Leibniz, by trying to understand the world based on an idea of individual existence that has the self as its model, made it impossible to recognise the "objective order into which individuals may enter as component parts." He advocates an understanding of individuality between these extremes. He suggests that the aim of sexual desire can be described metaphorically as the wish to "''unite you with your body''" or to "summon your perspective into your flesh, so that it becomes identical with your flesh". He explains that this means establishing a metaphysical "sense of an identity" between a person's "unity of consciousness" and the "animal unity" of their body.{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=95–97, 99, 101, 103, 107, 109–111, 118, 128}}

===Sociobiology===
Scruton questions the scientific basis of sociobiology and criticises what he sees as its moral implications. He considers sociobiology the "most radical of all attempts at a science of sexual conduct" because of its attempt to explain social phenomena in evolutionary terms by showing how they relate to the survival of the species. However, he is critical of sociobiological explanations of the behavior of both non-human animals and humans, arguing that the former risk [[anthropomorphism]] and that the latter dubiously extend explanations of the behavior of non-human animals to that of humans. He criticises the biologist [[E. O. Wilson]] for using anthropomorphic language, and for suggesting that sociobiology supports a liberalised sexual morality. However, he maintains that the criticisms directed against sociobiology do not show that it should be rejected entirely, but only that it has drawn premature conclusions. He accepts that sociobiological explanations of phenomena such as [[monogamy]] may possibly be correct, albeit in his view they remain insensitive to important distinctions and cannot lead to full understanding of human behaviour because in human life phenomena that must be understood in terms of reasons rather than causes are common. He argues that the prime mistake of sociobiology is to hold that because humans as a species have a social disposition, "human societies will owe their ruling characteristics to genetic implantation." He suggests that sociobiology is incapable of taking intentional understanding into account in its theory of social behavior.{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=180, 183–188, 190, 403}}

===Psychoanalysis===
Discussing psychoanalysis, Scruton suggests that Freud had the same fundamental objective, that of creating "a theory of human nature and human sexuality that might eventually be given a biological basis", as that of sociobiology. He writes that Freud's presentation of his theories is "widely admitted to be fluctuating, unsystematic and riddled with metaphor", and that later psychoanalysts such as [[Melanie Klein]] and [[Wilhelm Reich]], both of whom he considers to be among the "most influential of the post-Freudian psychoanalytic writers on sex", are vulnerable to criticisms similar to those that can be made against Freud. He maintains that Freud was "neither an accurate observer nor a plausible theorist" of sex, and that recognizing this is important for anyone concerned to rescue sexual morality. According to Scruton, Freud's account of sexuality is based on a metaphorical model of the human mind, the scientific value of which depends on "whether it can be transformed into a literal, and explanatory, theory of the mind." Scruton criticises Freud for failing to provide a convincing theory that would explain the mind in neurophysiological terms and identify the mental forces, barriers and spaces he postulated in terms accessible to empirical investigation. He argues that Freud's model of the mind functions as a myth rather than a scientific theory, and that it is doubtful that it could expressed in literal terms and retain any explanatory power because it is only as myth that it explains the mind in terms of intentional understanding, something it would be unable to do as a scientific theory.{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=195–197}}

[[File:Karl Popper.jpg|thumb|upright|The philosopher Karl Popper. Scruton criticizes Popper's claims about Freudian theory.]] 
Scruton argues that Freud's model of the [[id, ego and super-ego]] is anthropomorphic and may also be incoherent. He provides an account and critique of the model, noting that it construes the ego as an agent that keeps unwelcome thoughts out of conscious awareness and in the unconscious. According to Scruton, the model suggests that mental states move from the unconscious into conscious awareness unless the ego acts to prevent this. He argues that since the contents of the unconscious are not observed by the ego, they are not part of it, and its consciousness and its mentality must be identical unless it is also divided into a conscious and unconscious section, opening the prospect of an infinite regress. He maintains that if it is possible to conclude that the mental states of the ego as all necessarily conscious, then it should be possible to reach the same conclusion about the mental states of the human person as a whole. In his view a truly scientific account of the mind would therefore eliminate metaphor entirely and make no reference to the [[unconscious mind]]. He further argues that even if it were possible to resolve the philosophical problems of Freudian theory it would still provide neither a correct description nor an explanation of sexual phenomena. However, he is unconvinced by the argument, put forward by the philosophers [[Karl Popper]] and [[Ernest Nagel]], that Freudian theory implies no testable observation and therefore does not have genuine predictive power, maintaining that it has both "theoretical terms" and "empirical content." He points to the example of Freud's theory of [[Repression (psychology)|repression]], arguing that despite being tied to metaphor it has "strong empirical content" and implies testable consequences. In his view, psychoanalysis is not genuinely scientific because the transition from its theoretical terms to the empirical consequences they entail involves "ineliminable metaphor."{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=197–199, 201}}

In his view, the two crucial parts of Freud's theory of the development of adult sexuality from its origins in infantile sexuality are the libido and the erotogenic zone. He argues that both are incoherent and present "a caricature of sexual desire": the libido is supposed to be conceived as both an instinct seeking the release of accumulated sexual tension and "a passion" based on a person's understanding of himself and his relations with others, and involves an incorrect comparison between the sexual drive and hunger. He argues that writers such as Reich, in ''The Function of the Orgasm'' (1942), and [[Norman O. Brown]], in ''[[Life Against Death]]'' (1959), have illegitimately drawn moral conclusions from the theory of the libido. He argues that the theory of the libido and the theory of the erotogenic zone both require the zones to inconsistently be locations of both sexual pleasure and sexual arousal, which involves interpersonal intentionality. He argues that Freud's definitions of the erotogenic zones are tautologous. He criticises Freud for lending his authority to the idea "that human sexuality belongs in the depths of our organic nature" and that the human sexual impulse is amoral and "outside the sphere of personal feeling and relation" and held in check by shame. He argues against Freud that, "Sexual desire is not impeded by morality, but created by it."{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=201–205, 211, 405}}

===Love===
Scruton believes that traditional accounts of sexuality have failed to explain the place of sexual desire in love, friendship, and esteem. Following the views of [[Socrates]], as reported in Plato's dialogue ''[[Symposium (Plato)|Symposium]]'' (4th century BC), he argues that it is problematic to hold that sexual desire either is part of love or that it is not part of love, since the former view suggests that erotic love cannot be a form of friendship and the latter suggests that love is never erotic. He refers to this dilemma as "Plato's question". He criticises Plato's ideas about love, such as his belief that desire, as a physical urge, has no place in love, and argues that erotic love is both a form of desire and a form of love. In Scruton's view, "Plato's question" derives its force from the fact that, "Love implicates the whole being of the lover, and desires the whole being of the beloved", and [[Platonism]] involves a "misdescription of desire" that makes it impossible to understand how desire can be an expression or a form of love. He attempts to clarify the distinction between love and friendship by providing an account of the intentional structure of the latter, and discusses different kinds of friendship, concluding that "the friendship of esteem" can become love and in so doing acquire its distinguishing features, but that the development of esteem into love is not inevitable and that love may also have other origins. He maintains that erotic love has a normal course that involves the lover and the beloved developing their selves through responses to each other's desires and perceptions. He also discusses the European tradition of [[courtly love]], and criticises the idea that romantic love did not exist before the 12th century, arguing that evidence from [[Japanese literature|Japanese]], [[Persian literature|Persian]], and [[Classics|classical literature]] shows otherwise.{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=213–217, 219, 231–232, 241–242}}

===Sex and gender===
Scruton discusses the concept of [[gender]], and the distinction between gender and sex. He maintains that sex is "material base" of the "intentional superstructure" of gender. According to Scruton, gender incorporates, "not only the distinct observable forms of man and woman, but also the differences in life and behaviour which cause us selectively to respond to them." Scruton criticises other understandings of gender, including those of feminists, writing that they have wrongly argued that "distinctions of gender are entirely arbitrary, and may be either abolished or constructed in any way, depending on the social conventions, prejudices and ideological purpose of the person who makes them." He argues that feminist views often depend on untenable assumptions resembling those of Kant. He refers to such views as "Kantian feminism", giving [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s ideas in ''[[The Second Sex]]'' (1949) as an example. He argues that "Kantian feminism" wrongly maintains that "personality is distinct from its bodily form" and thereby ignores the fact that people are identical with their bodies, and fails to recognise that distinctions of gender are "artificial" only in the same sense that the human person is "artificial", and suggests that sociobiology supports the claim that men and women have "distinct psychological dispositions" deriving from the different roles of men and women in [[sexual reproduction]].{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=255–262, 408}}

===Perversion===
Scruton defends and explicates the concept of [[sexual perversion]], and the related idea of [[Normality (behavior)|normality]]. He criticises Freud's view that sexual acts of a kind that do not normally lead to procreation should be considered perverted. He also criticises [[G. E. M. Anscombe]]'s view that perversion is "to be explained in terms of the ''animal'' process of biological reproduction", noting that few other philosophers have found her argument satisfactory. According to Scruton, perversion involves deviations from "the unity of animal and interpersonal relation" that normally characterises sexual desire and detaches the sexual urge from its interpersonal intentionality. Scruton sees its "major structural feature" as the "failure to recognise, in and through desire, the personal existence of the other", which in turn is "an affront, both to him and oneself." He argues that this justifies its moral condemnation.{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=284, 287, 289}}

Building on these ideas, Scruton evaluates [[bestiality]], [[necrophilia]], [[pedophilia|paedophilia]], [[Sadomasochism|sado-masochism]], [[homosexuality]], [[incest]], [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]] and [[masturbation]], to determine whether they can be considered perverted. He concludes that bestiality, necrophilia and paedophilia are perversions. However, he argues that sado-masochism is "relatively normal", while maintaining that it also has a perverted form. He compares sadism to slavery, invoking the philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s account of the [[Master–slave dialectic|conflict between master and slave]] in ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'' (1807), summarising Hegel as maintaining that the "final end of every rational being is the building of the self", which involves recognising other people as ends in themselves. According to Scruton, Hegel maintains that all human relations involve both an element of conflict, based on desire to "compel the other to give what is required", and a compulsion toward agreement and "the mutual recognition that only what is given can be genuinely received." Scruton argues that sado-masochism likewise involves an "intrinsic paradox", whereby the sadist "wishes to possess the other, but also to be recognised by the other as a person and accepted accordingly." In the normal form of sado-masochism, the pain inflicted is "incorporated into the love-play of the partners" and the sadomasochistic impulse is "incorporated into an interpersonal relation", while in the perverted form, the consent of the other is irrelevant and he is reduced "a state of servitude in which his existence as a free being is systematically negated." According to Scruton, masochism also has both perverted and non-perverted forms; he cites an example in which a girl's masochism formed part of "a sincere erotic giving of herself to another."{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=291–304, 410}}

Scruton suggests that homosexuality can be considered a perversion, arguing that it differs from heterosexuality in a way that helps to explain that traditional judgment. He suggests that the "intentional content" of homosexual desire may differ from that of heterosexual desire in a way that justifies the conclusion that the former has "a distinct moral character" and potentially "diverges from the norm of interpersonal relations in the direction of obscenity." He argues that heterosexuality, unlike homosexuality, involves dealing with the different and complementary nature of the opposite sex, and that such "opening of the self to the mystery of another gender" is a feature of sexual maturity. He believes that male and female homosexuality differ from each other significantly because of differences between the sexual dispositions of the two sexes: men are interested in immediate sexual excitement and prone to promiscuity, while women are interested in lasting partnerships and find sexual excitement "inseparable from the feeling of dependence". He considers male, though not female, homosexuals prone to sexual [[promiscuity]], and argues that this, combined with "the natural predatoriness of the male", constitutes the danger inherent in male homosexuality. Though basing his conclusions about homosexuality partly on [[Greek art]] and literature, he dismisses the classicist [[Kenneth Dover]]'s ''[[Greek Homosexuality (book)|Greek Homosexuality]]'' (1978) as "trivialising". He suggests that it may be proper to regard homosexuality as obscene because, "In the heterosexual act, it might be said, I move out ''from'' my body ''towards'' the other, whose flesh is unknown to me; while in the homosexual act I remain locked within my body narcissistically contemplating in the other an excitement that is the mirror of my own."{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=305–310}}

Though Scruton concludes that incest is not necessarily a perversion, he maintains it is nevertheless immoral. He argues that fetishism is a perversion, though a "harmless and amusing" one. He maintains that there are two forms of masturbation, one in which the practice "relieves a period of sexual isolation, and is guided by a fantasy of copulation" and the other in which it "replaces the human encounter", and that only the second can be considered perverted, since it diverts the sexual impulse away from interpersonal union.{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=314–315, 317–320}}

===Morality and politics===
Combining his theory of sexual desire with a "plausible account of moral reasoning", Scruton tries to establish an "intuitively persuasive sexual morality." He relates morality to [[practical reason]], describing it as a "constraint upon reasons for action" and which is "a normal consequence of the possession of a first-person perspective." He criticises Kant's attempt to base morality on the [[categorical imperative]], considering it a failure even though it is "the most beautiful and thorough of all the theories which try to find the basis of morality in the first-person perspective". He proposes an alternative view inspired by Aristotle, which seeks to base "first-person practical reason outside the immediate situation of the agent", believing that only this approach can help to establish "a secular morality of sexual conduct" because unlike other secular approaches it "gives cogency to prohibitions and privations". He argues that the capacity for erotic love is a virtue, and that sexual virtue involves avoiding habits that impede the "development of the sexual impulse towards love" and acquiring dispositions that encourage that development. He considers preventing jealousy an essential moral task. He argues that because virtuous desire is "an artefact, made possible by a process of moral education which we do not, in truth, understand in its complexity" much of "traditional sexual morality" must be upheld. For Scruton, this includes the traditional condemnation of lust and perversion, the former of which he defines as sexual desire "from which the goal of erotic love has been excluded", and latter of which he defines as "a diverting of the sexual impulse from its interpersonal goal". He defends sexual fidelity and marriage, criticises promiscuity, and maintains that sexual morality inevitably has a political aspect. He criticises the philosophers [[Herbert Marcuse]] and [[Michel Foucault]], writing that in ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' (1976), Foucault mistakenly assumes that there could be societies in which a "problematisation" of the sexual did not occur. He argues against Foucault that, "No history of thought could show the 'problematisation' of sexual experience to be peculiar to certain specific social formations: it is characteristic of personal experience generally, and therefore of every genuine social order."{{sfn|Scruton|1994|pages=322, 324, 330, 337–339, 343–344, 350, 362}}

==Publication history==
''Sexual Desire'' was first published in the United Kingdom in 1986 by [[Weidenfeld and Nicolson]]. Subsequent British editions include those published by [[Phoenix Books]] in 1994 and [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]] in 1996.{{sfn|Scruton|1994|page=iv}}{{sfn|Scruton|2006|page=iv}} In the United States, the book was published as ''Sexual Desire: A Moral Philosophy of the Erotic'' by [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] in 1986.{{sfn|Belliotti|1997|page=326}}

==Reception==
===Mainstream media, 1986–2008===
''Sexual Desire'' received positive reviews from the historian [[Piers Paul Read]] in ''[[The Spectator]]'',{{sfn|Read|1986|pages=24–25}} C. D. Keyes in ''[[Library Journal]]'',{{sfn|Keyes|1986|page=70}} the anthropologist [[Richard Shweder]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'',{{sfn|Shweder|1986}} and the journalist [[Joseph Sobran]] in ''[[National Review]]'',{{sfn|Sobran|1986|pages=48–49}} mixed reviews from John Ryle in the ''[[London Review of Books]]'',{{sfn|Ryle|1986|pages=5–6}} the philosopher [[Galen Strawson]] in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'',{{sfn|Strawson|1986|pages=207–208}} and the philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]] in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'',{{sfn|Nussbaum|1986|pages=49–52}} and negative reviews from the critic [[Roz Kaveney]] in the ''[[New Statesman]]'',{{sfn|Kaveney|1986|page=25}} [[Shirley Robin Letwin]] in ''[[The American Spectator]]'',{{sfn|Letwin|1986|pages=45–46}} the philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] in ''[[The New Republic]]'',{{sfn|Rorty|1986|pages=34–36}} and John Weightman in ''[[Encounter (magazine)|Encounter]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Weightman|1986|pages=46–51}} The book was also reviewed by the sociologist [[Michael Kimmel]] in ''[[Psychology Today]]'',{{sfn|Kimmel|1987|page=76}} and discussed by the political commentator [[Andrew Sullivan]] in ''The New Republic'',{{sfn|Sullivan|1986|pages=28–36}} the critic [[Terry Teachout]] in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' magazine,{{sfn|Teachout|1987|page=76}} and the Christian cleric [[Richard John Neuhaus]] in ''National Review''.{{sfn|Neuhaus|1987|page=45}}

Read described the book as an ambitious and erudite work. He compared it to ''The Second Sex'', but found its conclusions sounder. He credited Scruton with providing unprejudiced discussions of topics such as homosexuality and bestiality, finding this important since his conclusions went against views currently accepted in western society. However, he argued that Scruton relied too much on philosophy and was overly dismissive of anthropology and psychology. He agreed with Scruton's criticism of Freud, but criticised him for neglecting the psychiatrist [[Carl Jung]]. He believed that Scruton neglected theology, questioned his claim to reach moral conclusions independently of religion, and criticised him for underestimating the importance of children in the fulfillment of love based on trust and companionship and for failing to clarify the relationship between flourishing and sexual virtue. He noted that parts of the book would be incomprehensible to many readers, but suggested that the details of Scruton's writing were more valuable than his "general argument".{{sfn|Read|1986|pages=24–25}}

Keyes considered the book "radical in its methods and conservative in many of its conclusions". He credited Scruton with "drawing from a wide range of historical and contemporary texts", but concluded that the book would be of interest mainly to scholars and specialists in the field of the philosophy of sex.{{sfn|Keyes|1986|page=70}} Shweder, who characterised Scruton's views as "illiberal, antifeminist, anti-Freudian, antiliberationist, antilibertarian, and anti-free market", described the book as "a stunning achievement", "brave", and "deliberately provocative". However, he noted that Scruton was not a sexologist, and wrote that his work was "not sexy", "excessively illiberal", and likely to be misinterpreted. He also considered Scruton's case that homosexuality is a perversion to be contrived.{{sfn|Shweder|1986}} Sobran described Scruton's argument as "learned and subtle in the extreme", and admitted that he did not fully understand it. However, though not considering himself competent to offer a final evaluation of ''Sexual Desire'', he wrote that it "abounds in fine observations and fascinating insights", that "its dozens of stimulating passages will reward any reader's effort, whether or not he accepts the argument as a whole", and that the book was highly original.{{sfn|Sobran|1986|pages=48–49}}

Ryle wrote that while the book would not be easy for non-philosophers to read it was often enjoyable. He compared Scruton's views to Foucault's, writing that Scruton and Foucault would agree that human sexuality is unique and were both disinterested in the biological basis of sexual desire. He praised Scruton's discussions of jealousy and sado-masochism, and credited Scruton with effectively criticising sociobiology and Kinsey by demonstrating that desire "involves a distinctively human concept of selfhood." He believed that Scruton's use of theological language suggested that he was covertly expressing religious views. However, while he found Scruton's view that the aim of sexual desire is to "unite you with your body" attractive, he questioned its accuracy. He argued that Scruton ignored the diversity of homosexual experience. He faulted Scruton for dismissing Dover's ''Greek Homosexuality'', writing that he did so without relevant credentials. He also observed that despite Scruton's discussion of topics such as Japanese court literature, the literary and philosophical references of the book were limited mainly to classical and modern European culture, and that the work was undermined by Scruton's limited use of ethnographic evidence.{{sfn|Ryle|1986|pages=5–6}}

Strawson described the book as ambitious, interesting, and serious, and predicted that those interested in philosophizing about sex would find it impossible to ignore. However, he also believed that it was florid in style, that its level of originality was questionable, that it presented an incomplete attempt at philosophical analysis, and that most non-philosophers, and even some philosophers, would find it unreadable. He criticised Scruton for using terms such as "rational" and "moral" in a vague fashion and for "intellectual irresponsibility". He wrote that Scruton made misleading or incorrect statements and drew conclusions about human nature in general from his own distinctive experience. He criticised Scruton's views about jealousy, embarrassment and friendship, sexual arousal, homosexuality, women's experience, feminism, psychoanalysis, and obscenity, and argued that his outline of a "general moral theory" took no account of possible objections from anthropologists and historians and that Scruton presented idealised accounts of sexual desire and love. However, he expressed a more favorable view of Scruton's discussions of other topics, including nakedness, orgasm, narcissism, sociobiology, gender identity, perversion, and Platonic love. He agreed with Scruton that Plato's view that desire has no place in love should be rejected, and welcomed Scruton's defense of the claim that erotic love is a genuine possibility.{{sfn|Strawson|1986|pages=207–208}}

Nussbaum described the book as uneven in quality and argued that Scruton's work revealed his "distaste for the flesh", disgust for "the sexuality of animals", and lack of sense of fun. She was convinced by Scruton's case for the intentionality of sexual desire and credited Scruton with using it to make "effective criticisms of reductionist pseudosciences of sex that have severed desire from its personal and subjective aspects." However, she wrote that Scruton unconvincingly moved from the claim that sexual desire is intentional to the proposition that it "treats its object as irreducibly unique and particular, attending to and cherishing all of its perceptible properties" and that "desire’s aim is to establish union with that ineffable spirit, through contact with its embodied traces." She found Scruton's view that love is "love of the other person’s entire self" appealing but unconvincing. She found Scruton's discussions of bestiality and necrophilia disappointing, but his discussion of sado-masochism interesting. She was unconvinced by Scruton's condemnation of homosexuality and what she saw as his rejection of "female equality", arguing that, like his support for state religion and marriage, it did not follow in any obvious way from his philosophical reflections on sexual desire. She criticised Scruton for inconsistently trying to use sociobiology to criticise feminism, despite his own criticisms of it.{{sfn|Nussbaum|1986|pages=49–52}}

In a letter responding to Nussbaum's review, Scruton accused her of misrepresenting his views about sexual desire, love, and feminism. In response, Nussbaum wrote that ''Sexual Desire'' suffered from "vagueness and haste about crucial distinctions, lack of clarity about argumentative structure, and the substitution of truculent rhetoric for careful inquiry." She also defended her interpretations and criticisms of Scruton's book, describing his philosophical arguments as interesting but his views as open to various objections.{{sfn|Scruton|Nussbaum|1987|page=46}}

Kaveney described the book as "foggy and pompous" and as containing "misstatements of fact and misinterpretations of texts". In her view, "the only thing which redeems it is Scruton's tendency to shoot himself, and his cause, in the foot." She accused Scruton of being driven by spite toward "lives he does not understand and wishes to remould."{{sfn|Kaveney|1986|page=25}} Letwin found Scruton's discussions of personhood and intentionality obscure. She rejected his view that the unity of an aesthetic object is imposed by the observer. She compared Scruton's conception of erotic love to Stendhal's, finding its only novel feature to be Scruton's refusal to accept that sexuality and morality cannot be reconciled. Though agreeing with Scruton's call for "sexual integrity", she criticised him for failing to support it convincingly and for moving from "saying that the illusion of a person is the object of sexual desire to the conclusion that this illusion ''ought to be'' what we seek". She further argued that, despite his claims, Scruton was "violating traditional morality" rather than defending it. She also found his view of marriage inconsistent, and believed that he failed to take sufficient interest in religion and that his conclusions about politics were misleading. She questioned his claim to be a conservative, arguing that his beliefs conflicted with the English moral and political tradition, that he misinterpreted Aristotle, and that conservatives should reject his work.{{sfn|Letwin|1986|pages=45–46}}

Rorty considered the book less "interesting as it might have been" because of Scruton's refusal "to take the competition seriously", writing that Scruton discussed Freud alongside Kinsey and sociobiology and dismissed him in a condescending fashion. He also criticised Scruton's treatment of Foucault and feminism. He argued that Scruton was misled by his belief that as a philosopher he had "the methodological high ground", questioned whether it was possible to use philosophy to determine the nature of sexual desire, and suggested that Scruton's account of desire was overly technical and that his book was too long. He also questioned whether Scruton's analysis of sexual desire helped him to make a moral argument about it, and argued that Scruton was wrong to believe that ever since Plato sexual desire had wrongly been assigned to the "animal side of human nature." Though considering some of Scruton's observations about sex "brilliant", he criticised Scruton's treatment of masturbation and homosexuality. He concluded that, "The later chapters of the book partly make up for the almost unreadable, and specifically philosophical, earlier chapters. But Scruton has written better books, and doubtless will again."{{sfn|Rorty|1986|pages=34–36}}

Weightman wrote that while he was initially "captivated" by Scruton's work, he came to find it disappointing. He believed that Scruton wrote insightfully about subjects such as "the importance of the face in human sex, the psychology of fashion, and the symbolism of the Incarnation", and rightly skeptical of Freudian views. Nevertheless, he found ''Sexual Desire'' as a whole confused and unsatisfactory. He believed that Scruton, despite his avoidance of religious commitment, made dogmatic and quasi-religious claims about the nature of personal identity. He also questioned the accuracy of Scruton's ideas about sexual desire, writing that Scruton defined "desire as he thinks it should ideally be, not as it very commonly is", and presented "very personal quirks with a rhetorical vigour that gives them a false air of universal truth." He described Scruton's discussion of the morality of homosexuality as "unexpectedly tentative" and unhelpful and his discussion of the politics of sex as "astonishingly simplistic and moralising".{{sfn|Weightman|1986|pages=46–51}}

Sullivan wrote that the book, like Scruton's previous work, expressed its author's wish to make conservatism "a sexy research topic" and "reclaim lost intellectual ground by staging terror strikes into the heart of the enemy camp and then retreating." He credited Scruton with showing how "involuntary actions, such as a blush, a glance, or an erection, can be the most powerful signs of an acutely voluntary desire" and explaining "sexual hunger as an urge to enter conversation, rather than to assuage appetite, and of orgasm as an interruption of congress rather than its end". He complimented Scruton for his "defense of pain in sex", his analysis of shame and "the relationship of love to esteem" and "the uncontractual nature of marriage", noting that they were insights that might not be expected from a conventional political conservative. However, he criticised Scruton's treatment of homosexuality, describing his arguments about it as contrived. He also criticised Scruton's lack of sympathy for Freud and failure to appreciate that "Victorian virtues" could "destroy the sexual virtue of countless people". He believed that the credibility of Scruton's arguments about sexual morality was undermined by his refusal to base them on "religious revelation or [[natural law]]". He questioned the merits of Scruton's use of phenomenology, and suggested that Scruton was guilty of the "cynical use of philosophy to support a particular political structure."{{sfn|Sullivan|1986|pages=28–36}}

Teachout praised the book as "a serious discussion of conservative sexual ideology".{{sfn|Teachout|1987|page=76}} Neuhaus described the book as "remarkable", but noted that Scruton's project of making a secular case for traditional sexual ethics was not easy.{{sfn|Neuhaus|1987|page=45}}

===Mainstream media, 2009–present===
''Sexual Desire'' was discussed by Nussbaum in ''[[The New Republic]]'',{{sfn|Nussbaum|2009|pages=43–45}} Michael Tanner in ''[[Literary Review]]'',{{sfn|Tanner|2009}} and the radical feminist [[Julie Bindel]] in ''[[Standpoint (magazine)|Standpoint]]'' magazine.{{sfn|Bindel|2015}}

Nussbaum credited Scruton with popularising a view of sexual attraction according to which, "Really valuable sexual passion ... requires qualitative differences between the parties". She criticised Scruton for applying his thesis inconsistently, writing that he applied it to sexual orientation but not to romances between people of different ages or backgrounds. Nussbaum wrote that it was unclear how his argument about similarity could be assessed.{{sfn|Nussbaum|2009|pages=43–45}}

Tanner described ''Sexual Desire'' as Scruton's "magnum opus".{{sfn|Tanner|2009}} Bindel called the book a classic work.{{sfn|Bindel|2015}}

===Scientific and academic journals===
''Sexual Desire'' received positive reviews from the political scientist [[Mark Lilla]] in ''[[The Public Interest]]'',{{sfn|Lilla|1986|pages=86–94}} the philosopher [[Norman P.

Martin Stafford in the ''[[Journal of Applied Philosophy]]'' and ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'',{{sfn|Stafford|1988|pages=87–100}}{{sfn|Stafford|1991|pages=187–193}} Alan Singer in ''[[SubStance]]'',{{sfn|Singer|2016|pages=158–183}} and the philosopher [[Alan Soble]] in the ''[[Journal of Sex Research]]''.{{sfn|Soble|2009|page=117}}

Lilla credited Scruton with being the first author to provide a detailed examination of sexual morality written from a secular conservative viewpoint, with making effective criticisms of "liberal morality" and its psychological basis, and with making sense of the widespread revulsion for phenomena such as prostitution, pornography, and incest. He described ''Sexual Desire'' as "a permanent contribution to conservative thought". However, he considered the work difficult and open to possible misunderstanding. He considered Scruton's approach to moral issues more interesting than his conclusions, which he found largely unsurprising. He suggested that Scruton's work was sufficiently different from philosophy as usually practiced that it could be considered instead a work of "moral psychology", and that Scruton's use of phenomenology to discuss sexual experience was both simpler and more compelling than Husserl's work. He endorsed Scruton's view that sexual desire is both "intentional and interpersonal" and that it arises "within the mores and institutions also constructed through human intention", and praised Scruton discussions of "the smile and the caress, shame and jealousy" and the moral relevance of gender, but criticised his treatment of homosexuality. He complimented Scruton for his criticism of Freud, writing that his discussion of metapsychology accomplished more than that of the philosopher [[Adolf Grünbaum]], although he noted that Scruton's failed to consider "Freud's own moral project, and how it might compare with Scruton's." He also believed that, because Scruton rejected Freud's metapsychology, Scruton created a mistaken impression "that we bear moral blame for our sexual incapacities as well as our chosen perversions." He faulted Scruton's proposals for moral education, suggesting that underlying them "there lurks an ineradicable Freudianism that still fears being overwhelmed by wild, untamed desire."{{sfn|Lilla|1986|pages=86–94}}

Barry described the book as "profound  and  penetrating" and "intellectually exciting and beautifully written". He considered it comparable to [[Alfred Schütz]]'s ''The Phenomenology of the Social World''. He praised Scruton's discussions of sexual desire and sexual arousal, considering Scruton correct to stress that orgasm is not the purpose of sexual desire and to stress "the role of the face in sexual desire", believing that Scruton helped to show that arousal is not only a biological response to another person but has "cognitive significance". He also credited Scruton with showing that the "ideal of embodiment" finds its "truest expression in erotic love" and providing a beautiful description of "the agony of sexual jealousy". However, he expressed dissatisfaction with Scruton's discussion of the politics of sex and skepticism about whether Scruton had succeeded in refuting libertarian views of sexual morality, suggesting that Scruton's Aristotelian view of sexual morality could be compared to that of [[Ayn Rand]]. He criticised Scruton for attempting to "view the metaphysically sanitised conception of sexual desire from a specific political perspective." He agreed with Scruton that "the cultivation of an appropriate sexual morality is an essential part of the process of self-realisation" and that this requires a public set of rules, but disputed Scruton's "Hegelian assertion that such a desirable  public  morality cannot be sustained by the spontaneous development of social institutions", believing that Scruton arbitrarily rejected "the idea that the moral integrity of marriage can be sustained by contract alone." Against Scruton, Barry argued that the state "has destroyed that morality which Scruton is so anxious to preserve" by prescribing a standard form of the marriage contract.{{sfn|Barry|1986|pages=265–268}}

O'Hear credited Scruton with usefully illustrating his thesis that human sexual relations in general, and sexual arousal and desire in particular, are characterised by intentionality with reference to Mann's novel ''Joseph and His Brothers'' (1933–1943), and with using the thesis to make "highly effective criticisms of both Freud and of Kinsey." He described Scruton's argument that one of the roots of feminist thought is the "Kantian approach to the human person as something essentially disembodied" as interesting.{{sfn|O'Hear|1988|pages=493–496}} Pateman wrote that there is much to be learned from Scruton's account of sexual desire, including his discussions of arousal, the object of desire, the meaning of the sexual organs, normality, and sexual phenomena such as sado-masochism and jealousy, but that his book was nevertheless "deeply flawed." Though she found Scruton's account of desire appealing, she did not consider it a description "of the structure of our existing sexual lives." She criticised Scruton for his failure to present evidence about "actual relations between women and men", for presenting a model of the self that remained abstracted from the body, for discussing Freud without mentioning that "an explanation of how masculinity and femininity are constructed is central to Freud's work", for ignoring the perpsective of women, for his treatment of prostitution, and for including numerous untranslated quotations. She found Scruton's comments about women full of "conventional banalities" and sometimes "silly", and argued that it was possible to accept much of Scruton's account of desire without accepting his conservative moral and political conclusions, which she described as "patriarchal". She also suggested that ''Sexual Desire'' "could profitably have been much shorter."{{sfn|Pateman|1987|pages=881–882}}

Richards considered Scruton's attempt to defend traditional sexual morality open to question and believed it had only limited connection to Scruton's philosophy of the erotic. He found the book dogmatic and wrote that Scruton's account of erotic experience and human sexuality added little to that of Thomas Nagel. He criticised the idea that "integrity of sexual experience requires the interpersonal intentionality" emphasised by Scruton. He also criticised Scruton for defining perversion in a way that made it include anything Scruton considered morally unacceptable, such as masturbation. He believed that Scruton misunderstood the work of Freud and Kinsey, falsely attributing to them a "depersonalization of sexual experience", presented an oversimplified view of the British political tradition, offered arguments that were unlikely to convince those not already in agreement with him, and presented "a highly personal profession of faith in traditional heterosexuality." He faulted Scruton's criticism of feminism, as well as Scruton's discussion of homosexuality, writing that it ignored the role of differences between individuals in sexual attraction and love and that Scruton's emphasis on the sex organs was suggestive of [[biological determinism]].{{sfn|Richards|1987|pages=463–470}}

McArthur criticised Scruton's understanding of science, describing it as "rather limiting". He suggested that Scruton had a conception of science that was "based on the crudest of physical models" and was unable to "comprehend the great complexities of  biological systems." He considered it inconsistent of Scruton to criticise Freud for using metaphor while doing so himself, and also criticised Scruton for stereotyping men as having a tendency to sexual promiscuity and women as finding sexual excitement "inseparable from the feeling of dependence" and for ignoring "centuries of crime and injustice based on sex". He charged Scruton with distorting Wilson's views by quoting him out of context. He believed that Scruton's "exaggerated" view of responsibility created philosophical difficulties for his understanding of sexual desire. He questioned whether the concept of intentionality was useful for "a practical morality of sexual desire", and argued that if all significant human acts, whether voluntary or involuntary, were evidence of intentionality, then the concept itself became "empty" and was not necessarily more useful than an emphasis on "will-power". He argued that Scruton had not achieved an advance over traditional philosophical views, such as those of Plato and Aristotle. He concluded that because Scruton condemned the scientific study of human sexuality and failed to address fundamental questions about traditional sexual morality, ''Sexual Desire'' was "more rhetoric than philosophy." He predicted that it would "encourage the right and enrage the left", but that it would "change no minds."{{sfn|McArthur|1989|pages=181–187}}

Johnson considered Scruton's efforts at "baiting liberals", and his "theme of the devaluation of claims to first-person epistemic authority", familiar from his earlier work. He wrote that Scruton's view that perversion is a form of depersonalization required constant readjustment. He argued that it was hard to specify exactly what recognizing someone as a person requires, and that Scruton's reinterpretation of Kantian ideas was of little help. He believed that Scruton's account of perversion was most convincing in the cases of bestiality, necrophilia, and paedophilia, but described Scruton's distinction between normal and perverted forms of sado-masochism as surprising. He considered Scruton's account of sexual relations between the sexes interesting but debatable, suggesting that what Scruton saw as normal might be part of a "patriarchal heritage". He criticised Scruton's arguments about gender. He also suggested that Scruton's concern with "clarity of feeling and scrutability of desire" were primary motives behind many of his arguments. He dismissed Scruton's arguments about homosexuality. He found Scruton's descriptions of "male and female desire" to be based on stereotypes, and criticised Scruton's treatment of feminism, as well as his accounts of sexual arousal and desire. He questioned the usefulness of Scruton's view that "the metaphysical self is a transcendental illusion, albeit one we cannot do without" for understanding desire, as well whether Scruton's account of desire supported Scruton's moral and political views, and the overall coherence of Scruton's philosophical views, which combined Aristotelian with Kantian ideas. He also criticised Scruton's discussions of masturbation, sexual fantasy, and fetishism, and suggested that Scruton was prudish.{{sfn|Johnson|1990|pages=208–219}}

Kingham compared ''Sexual Desire'' to the sociologist [[Jeffrey Weeks (sociologist)|Jeffrey Weeks]]'s ''[[Sexuality and Its Discontents]]'' (1985), writing that while Scruton's conclusions differed from those of Weeks, his book addressed the same range of issues and was similar in structure and content. He also compared Scruton's work to that of the critic [[F. R. Leavis]].{{sfn|Kingham|2016|pages=917–918}} Stafford, writing in the ''Journal of Applied Philosophy'', criticised ''Sexual Desire'', arguing that Scruton's proposal that moral education guide students toward a state in which sexuality is integrated within a life of personal affection and responsibility is inconsistent with his views on homosexuality.{{sfn|Stafford|1988|pages=87–100}} According to Stafford, Scruton was invited by the ''Journal of Applied Philosophy'' to respond, but declined to do so.{{sfn|Stafford|2005|page=977}} Writing in ''Studies in Philosophy and Education'', Stafford again criticised Scruton, arguing that Scruton's view that children should be encouraged to feel revulsion for homosexuality is inconsistent with the ideas expressed in ''Sexual Desire''. He noted that the question of why homosexuality exists could potentially be answered through a sociobiological explanation of the kind that Scruton might accept. Stafford endorsed Scruton's view that a proper sexual relationship involves interpersonal intentionality, and argued that Scruton's admission that this is possible in homosexual and as well as heterosexual relationships should have led him to oppose discrimination against homosexuals.{{sfn|Stafford|1991|pages=187–193}} Singer credited Scruton with succinctly discussing the problems involved in thinking about sexual activity and with showing that sexual desire involves complexity of thought.{{sfn|Singer|2016|pages=158–183}} Soble described the book as "erudite and philosophically elegant", and noted that despite a "social climate already highly sensitive to issues surrounding sexual orientation", Scruton was "not afraid to doubt the normality, morality, and social effects of homosexuality." He observed that Scruton's contrast between sex and love was a "standard" part of traditionalism.{{sfn|Soble|2009|page=117}}

===Evaluations in books, 1986–1997===
Robert Brown observed in ''Analyzing Love'' (1987) that while some of his conclusions about topics such as moral theory, love and sex were similar to Scruton's, he reached them by "independent routes that, if pursued further, would diverge toward disparate outcomes." He considered the points raised in ''Sexual Desire'' "important, interesting, and also highly contentious".{{sfn|Brown|1997|page=viii}} The philosopher [[Michael Ruse]] argued in ''[[Homosexuality: A Philosophical Inquiry]]'' (1988) that Scruton's critique of Freud is weak and unconvincing. He considered Scruton's view that genuine science does not involve metaphor outdated, as philosophers and historians have shown that metaphor is common in science, in fields as diverse as [[physics]] and [[sociology]]. He also wrote that Scruton's criticism of sociobiology suggests that he falsely understands rationality as a "beyond-biology phenomenon".{{sfn|Ruse|1988|pages=28, 140}} The classicist [[David M. Halperin]] argued in ''[[One Hundred Years of Homosexuality]]'' (1990) that Scruton's textual practice of retaining the masculine pronoun for both the subject and object of desire helped illustrate the philosopher and psychoanalyst [[Luce Irigaray]]'s concept of ''hom(m)osexualité''.{{sfn|Halperin|1990|pages=210–211}} Scruton, writing in "Sexual morality and the liberal consensus", an essay included in ''The Philosopher on Dover Beach'' (1990), drew on his arguments in ''Sexual Desire'' in the course of seeking to justify revulsion for homosexuality.{{sfn|Scruton|1990|pages=264, 267}}

Norman O. Brown wrote in ''Apocalypse and/or Metamorphosis'' (1991) that Scruton was correct to identify Spinoza as his philosophical antagonist. He cited Scruton's ideas as an example of the way in which the "popular mythology" of individual love depends on the idea of "the individual self, soul, or person as a substantial reality".{{sfn|Brown|1991|page=123}} The social theorist [[Jonathan Dollimore]] interpreted Scruton as basing his sexual ethic on the Hegelian proposition that the "final end of every rational being is the building of the self" in ''[[Sexual Dissidence]]'' (1991). He wrote that Scruton sees homosexuality as a perversion and argued that Scruton's philosophy of sex is open to many objections. He argued that by "privileging sexual difference", Scruton is engaging in "the modern intensification of sexuality which in other ways he might regard as contributing to a legitimation of the perversions he repudiates." He found Scruton's writing jargon-ridden, believing that its Hegelian framework bestows "a spurious profundity on a normative sexual politics" that is "timid, conservative, and deeply ignorant." He also suggested that, notwithstanding Scruton's attack on psychoanalysis, his defense of sexual difference is indebted to psychoanalytic theory.{{sfn|Dollimore|1991|pages=261–262}}

Raymond A. Belliotti cited ''Sexual Desire'' as a notable example of a work by a philosopher who argues that sex is morally permissible only if it involves love and intimacy in the anthology ''A Companion to Ethics'' (1991). He compared the work to Vincent Punzo's ''Reflective Naturalism'' (1969).{{sfn|Belliotti|1997|page=318}} The economist [[Richard Posner]], in ''[[Sex and Reason]]'' (1992), compared ''Sexual Desire'' to Anscombe's defense of [[Pope Paul VI]]'s encyclical ''[[Humanae vitae]]'' (1968). He noted that they both sought to free Christian sexual morality from inessential details such as "making sexual pleasure problematic even in marriage". He argued that Scruton does not provide any adequate reason for viewing homosexuality as immoral, although he granted that Scruton might be correct that, "the fact that a male homosexual's preferred sex partner is another man reduces the psychological distance between the partners to the point of making the relationship narcissistic, almost masturbatory." He compared Scruton's views about the narcissistic character of homosexuality to those of Freud.{{sfn|Posner|1992|pages=228–229}} Dover observed in ''Marginal Comment'' (1994) that he was unconcerned by Scruton's dismissal of ''Greek Homosexuality'', explaining that despite agreeing with part of Scruton's analysis of sexual emotion, his work has a different focus.{{sfn|Dover|1995|page=115}} The philosopher [[Christopher Janaway]] identified ''Sexual Desire'' as one of several works in which Scruton challenges the conventional boundaries of analytic philosophy in ''[[The Oxford Companion to Philosophy]]'' (1995).{{sfn|Janaway|1995|page=816}}

Nussbaum credited Scruton with providing an interesting argument against gay rights in the anthology ''The Liberation Debate: Rights at Issue'' (1996). She noted that Scruton's argument was "expressed with a tentativeness and a lack of venom rare in these matters." However, she criticised it on several grounds, writing that Scruton used the unclear notion of "gender" rather than the clearer notion of biological sex, and suggesting that if one accepts Scruton's view that having sex with a person of the same gender is superficial in comparison to having sex with a person of the opposite gender because of one's greater familiarity with one's own gender, then "any relationship in which a barrier of experiential difference is crossed" should have superior moral value.{{sfn|Nussbaum|1996|pages=104–106}} Nussbaum maintained in the third edition of the anthology ''The Philosophy of Sex'' (1997) that Scruton's work advances the understanding of [[sexual objectification]] and provides "the most interesting philosophical attempt as yet to work through the moral issues involved in our treatment of persons as sex partners."{{sfn|Nussbaum|1997|page=293}} Soble, in the same work, criticised Scruton's treatment of masturbation and described his judgment that all masturbation is "obscene" as "silly".{{sfn|Soble|1997|pages=82–83}}

''Sexual Desire'' was cited in the anthology ''[[Unauthorized Freud]]'' (1998), edited by the critic [[Frederick Crews]].{{sfn|Crews|1999|page=285}}

===Evaluations in books, 1998–present===
The philosopher [[James Giles (philosopher)|James Giles]] argued in ''The Nature of Sexual Desire'' (2003) that Scruton is mistaken to think that sexual desire essentially aims at an individual person, since it can be desire simply for sexual activity.{{sfn|Giles|2004|page=73}} Scruton stated in his memoir ''Gentle Regrets'' (2005) that the philosopher [[A. J. Ayer]] dismissed ''Sexual Desire'' as "silly". Describing Ayer's comment as part of a pattern of negative responses to his work, he replied that he considers ''Sexual Desire'' cogent and an answer to Foucault's "mendacious" ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' (1976).{{sfn|Scruton|2005|page=55}} Stafford argued in the second volume of ''Sex from Plato to Paglia'' (2005) that Scruton's essay "Sexual morality and the liberal consensus" (1989), in which Scruton argued that children should be encouraged to feel revulsion for homosexuality, was an attempt by Scruton to prevent his admission that homosexual desire is spontaneous and not necessarily perverted from being seen as supporting the positive treatment of homosexuality by moral educators.{{sfn|Stafford|2005|page=977}} Christopher Hamilton called ''Sexual Desire'' "the most interesting and insightful philosophical account of sexual desire" produced within analytic philosophy in the fifth edition of ''The Philosophy of Sex'' (2008).{{sfn|Hamilton|2008|page=101}}

The philosopher [[Mark Dooley]] called ''Sexual Desire'' "magisterial" in ''Roger Scruton: The Philosopher on Dover Beach'' (2009). He observed that Scruton's objective is to show that sexual desire fundamentally enriches a person's experience of the sacred.{{sfn|Dooley|2009|page=53}} Dooley stated in his introduction to ''The Roger Scruton Reader'' (2011) that ''Sexual Desire'' is often considered Scruton's "magnum opus".{{sfn|Dooley|2011|page=xvii}} Anne Barnhill described ''Sexual Desire'' as, "One of the most interesting philosophical accounts of sexual ethics" but also "one of the most frustratingly anti-feminist" in the anthology ''Out from the Shadows: Analytical Feminist Contributions to Traditional Philosophy'' (2012). She adopted Scruton work on sexual ethics as a model despite disagreeing with most of Scruton's conclusions about gender.{{sfn|Barnhill|2012|pages=115–116}} Michael Plaxton described ''Sexual Desire'' as important in ''Implied Consent and Sexual Assault'' (2015), though he noted that Scruton's conclusions about topics such as homosexuality and the role of women in society are controversial. He drew on Scruton's work in his own discussion of sexual ethics despite not accepting some of Scruton's views.{{sfn|Plaxton|2015|pages=221, 223}}

Scruton, interviewed by Dooley in ''Conversations with Roger Scruton'' (2016), attributed his interest in writing ''Sexual Desire'' to having lived through the [[sexual revolution]] and experiencing a need to explain why the view of sex that he observed at the time was "naïve and destructive." He commented that he considered the book far too long and that if he were writing it again, he would "write it at half the length." He suggested that the book's essential ideas were summarised in a single chapter of his work ''Death-Devoted Heart: Sex and the Sacred in Wagner's Tristan und Isolde'' (2003). He noted that the book "upset many advocates of sexual liberation, who saw it as a kind of assault", adding that he had not expected that it would change people's views. Dooley suggested the book represents the first time Scruton made use of concepts, such as intentionality, the lifeworld, the transcendental, and the sacred, that later became central to his philosophical work, though Scruton noted that his interest in intentionality predated the book.{{sfn|Scruton|Dooley|2016|pages=101–102, 104, 111}} Scruton observed in the anthology ''The Religious Philosophy of Roger Scruton'' (2017) that his views on the philosophy of sex had become gradually clearer to him after the publication of ''Sexual Desire'', and that he had moved "away from the abstract theory of intentionality towards more concrete representations of our interpersonal being."{{sfn|Scruton|2017|pages=257–258}}

===Other responses===
Scruton, in an interview with the journalist [[Mick Hume]] published in ''[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]'' magazine in 2015, commented that it had become more dangerous to express the views about homosexuality that he put forward in ''Sexual Desire''.{{sfn|Hume|2015}} According to Lily Pickard, writing in ''[[The Independent]]'', officers at the [[University of Bristol Union|University of Bristol Students' Union]] sought to [[No Platform]] Scruton in 2016 for comments he "made over same-sex marriage" in ''Sexual Desire'' and "Sexual morality and the liberal consensus".{{sfn|Pickard|2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1309">'''Siro''' (also '''Syro''', '''Siron''', or '''Syron'''; [[floruit|fl.]] c. 50 BC) was an [[Epicurean]] philosopher who lived in [[Naples]].

He was a teacher of [[Virgil]],&lt;ref&gt;Donatus, ''Vita Vergilii'', 79.&lt;/ref&gt; and taught at his school in [[Naples]]. There are two poems attributed to Virgil in the [[Appendix Vergiliana]],&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Catalepton'', 5; ''Catalepton'', 8.&lt;/ref&gt; which mention Siro, and where the author speaks of seeking peace in the company of Siro:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I am setting sail for the havens of the blest to seek the wise sayings of great Siro, and will redeem my life from all care.&lt;ref&gt;Virgil, ''Catalepton'', 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Cicero]] also mentions Siro several times and speaks of Siro along with [[Philodemus]] as being "excellent citizens and most learned men."&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''de Finibus'', ii. 35&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th-century commentator  [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] claimed that Siro was commemorated in Virgil's sixth ''[[Bucolics|Eclogue]]'' as the character [[Silenus]].&lt;ref&gt;Servius on ''Eclogue'' 6.1&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''sugar baby''' is a person who is in a specific type of [[Transactional sex|transactional]] relationship for the expressed purpose of achieving [[economic security]]. A person in such a romantic relationship may receive cash, gifts or other financial and material benefits in exchange for being in the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/06/sugar-babies_n_6112290.html|title='Sugar Baby' Reveals Why Married Men Cheat With Her For Thousands Of Dollars (VIDEO)|journal=Huffington Post|first=Rochelle|last=Nelson|date=6 November 2014|via=Huff Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The practice is sometimes called "sugaring". The sugar baby's partner is referred to as either the "[[sugar daddy (slang term)|sugar daddy]]" or "[[sugar mama]]" and is typically wealthier and older than the sugar baby.

The online sites used for introducing people who may negotiate sugar arrangements are technically dating sites. Membership on one site in 2016 was $70 a month for sugar daddies, but free for sugar babies. What happens after the initial date, whether much or nothing, involving sex or not, is between the parties.&lt;ref name="DP51316"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Elizabeth Hernandez|title=Colorado "sugar babies" use online dating to cover soa.

[[File:Four-swastika collage (transparent).png|thumb|225px|A ''swastika'' is a symbol found in many cultures, with different meanings, drawn in different styles.]]

The '''swastika''' (as a character 卐 or 卍) is a geometrical figure and an ancient religious [[ideogram|icon]] in the cultures of [[Eurasia]], used as a symbol of divinity and spirituality in [[Indian religions]].&lt;ref name="Sullivan2001p216" /&gt;&lt;ref name=snodgrass82 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cort 2001 17"&gt;{{citation|last=Cort|first=John E.|authorlink=John E.

The name ''swastika'' comes from [[Sanskrit]] ([[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|[[wikt:स्वस्तिक|स्वस्तिक]]}}) meaning "conducive to well being or auspicious".&lt;ref name="etymology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="britswast"&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/topic/swastika Swastika: SYMBOL], Encyclopædia Britannica (2017)&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism, the clockwise symbol is called ''swastika'', symbolizing [[surya]] (sun), prosperity and good luck, while the counterclockwise symbol is called ''[[sauvastika]]'', symbolizing night or [[tantra|tantric]] aspects of [[Kali]].&lt;ref name="britswast" /&gt; In Jainism, a swastika is the symbol for [[Suparshvanatha]]—the seventh of 24 [[Tirthankara]]s (spiritual teachers and saviours), while in Buddhism it symbolizes the auspicious footprints of the [[Buddha]].&lt;ref name="britswast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="silverblatt109" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mohan Pant |author2=Shūji Funo |title=Stupa and Swastika: Historical Urban Planning Principles in Nepal's Kathmandu Valley |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W-K5_Z8qsJEC |year=2007|publisher=National University of Singapore Press|isbn=978-9971-69-372-5|pages=231 with note 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thirthankara Suparshvanath Museum Rietberg RVI 306.jpg|thumb|Idol of [[Jain]] ''[[Tirthankara]]'' [[Suparshvanath]] with his swastika symbol below it.]]
The swastika is an icon widely found in human history and the modern world.&lt;ref name="p.97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="britswast" /&gt; In various forms it is alternatively known in various European languages as the '''Hakenkreuz''', '''gammadion''', '''cross cramponnée''', '''croix gammée''', '''[[fylfot]]''' or '''tetraskelion''' and in [[East Asia]] as the '''wàn''' 卐/卍/萬, meaning "all things", and the '''manji'''. A swastika generally takes the form of a [[cross]] whose arms are of equal length and perpendicular to the adjacent arms, each bent midway at a right angle.&lt;ref name="MigSym" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CambDict" /&gt; It is found in the archeological remains of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] and [[Mesopotamia]] as well as in early [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Christian art]]work.&lt;ref name="p.97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="britswast" /&gt;

[[Western use of the swastika in the early 20th century|The swastika was adopted by several organizations in pre–World War I Europe]] and later, and most notably, by the [[Nazi Party]] and [[Nazi Germany]] prior to [[World War II]]. It was used by the Nazi Party to symbolize German nationalistic pride. To Jews and the enemies of Nazi Germany, it became a symbol of antisemitism and terror.&lt;ref name="holocaust2009" /&gt; In many Western countries, the swastika is viewed as a symbol of racial supremacy and intimidation because of its association with [[Nazism]].&lt;ref name="wiener463" /&gt;&lt;ref name="boissoneaultsm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenberg" /&gt; The reverence for the ''swastika'' symbol in Asian cultures, in contrast to the stigma in the West, has led to misinterpretations and misunderstandings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29644591|title=How the world loved the swastika—until Hitler stole it|first=Mukti Jain|last=Campion|date=23 October 2014|work=[[BBC News Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pokémon cards" /&gt;

==Etymology and nomenclature==
The word ''swastika'' has been used in the [[Vedas|Indian subcontinent]] and the middle east since 500 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zimmer |first1=Heinrich |title=Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization |date=4 April 2017 |publisher=Princeton University Press |accessdate=13 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its appearance in English is more recent. In the 1870s, replacing ''gammadion'', from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|γαμμάδιον}}.&lt;ref name="MigSym" /&gt; It is alternatively spelled in contemporary texts as ''svastika'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. R. Allchin|author2=George Erdosy|title=The Archaeology of Early Historic South Asia: The Emergence of Cities and States|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q5kI02_zW70C&amp;pg=PA180 |year= 1995|publisher= Cambridge University Press|isbn= 978-0-521-37695-2|page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in the 19th- and early 20th-century, alternate spellings such as ''suastika'' were occasionally used.&lt;ref&gt;first recorded 1871 ([[OED]]); alternative historical English spellings include ''suastika'', ''swastica'', and ''svastica''; see, for example: {{cite book|title=Notes and Queries, No. 170, March 31 1883|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C2AEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA259|year=1883|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was derived from the [[Sanskrit]] term ([[Devanagari]]: {{lang|sa|[[wikt:स्वस्तिक|स्वस्तिक]]}}), which transliterates to ''{{IAST|svastika}}'' under the commonly used IAST transliteration system, but is pronounced closer to "swastika" when letters are used with their English values. The first attested use of the word swastika in a European text is found in 1871 with the publications of [[Heinrich Schliemann]], who while crudely digging the [[Hisarlik|Hisarlik mound]] near the [[Aegean Sea]] coast, for the lost history of Troy (Trojan war), discovered over 1,800 ancient samples of the swastika symbol and its variants. Schliemann linked his findings to the Sanskrit ''swastika''.&lt;ref name="boissoneaultsm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Harper (2016), [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=swastika Swastika], Etymology Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernard Thomas Mees|title=The Science of the Swastika|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLNUx6YK9RIC|year=2008|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=978-963-9776-18-0|pages=57–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''swastika'' derives from the Sanskrit root ''swasti'', which is composed of ''su,'' ("good, well") and ''asti'' ("it is, there is").&lt;ref name="Schliemann347" /&gt; The word ''swasti'' occurs frequently in the [[Vedas]], as well as in classical literature, meaning ‘health luck, success, prosperity", and was commonly used a greeting &lt;ref name="M-W" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/vedicconcordance00bloouoft#page/1053/mode/1up A Vedic Concordance], Maurice Bloomfield, Harvard University Press, pages 1052–1054&lt;/ref&gt; The final ‘ka’ is a common suffix with same meaning as the English suffix ‘like’, so swastika means  "associated with well-being".&lt;ref name="M-W" /&gt; According to [[Monier-Williams]], a majority of scholars consider it a solar symbol.&lt;ref name="M-W" /&gt;

The sign implies something fortunate, lucky or auspicious, and when applied to entrances, doors, mandalas or object it denotes or reminds of auspiciousness or well-being.&lt;ref name="M-W" /&gt;

The earliest known textual use of the word ''swastika'' is in [[Pāṇini|Panini's]] Ashtadhyayi, which uses it to explain one of the Sanskrit grammar rules, in the context of a type of identifying mark on a cow's ear.&lt;ref name="Schliemann347" /&gt; Most scholarship suggests Panini lived in or before mid 4th-century [[Common Era|BCE]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Frits Staal]] (1965), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1397332 Euclid and Pāṇini], ''Philosophy East and West'', Vol. 15, No. 2 (April 1965), pp. 99–116&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | year=1998 | title=Pāṇini: A Survey of Research | last=Cardona|first=George|authorlink=George Cardona | publisher=Motilal Banarsidass | isbn=978-81-208-1494-3 | page=268 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=adWXhQ-yHQUC&amp;pg=PA268}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly in 6th or 5th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://www.britannica.com/topic/Ashtadhyayi|title= Panini (Indian Grammarian)|year= 2013 | publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hartmut Scharfe|title=Grammatical Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_VbnWkZ-SYC&amp;pg=PA88|year=1977|publisher=Otto Harrassowitz Verlag|isbn=978-3-447-01706-0|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other names for the symbol include:
* ''tetragammadion'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|τετραγαμμάδιον}}), or ''cross gammadion'' ({{lang-la|crux gammata}}; French: {{lang|fro|croix gammée}}), as each arm resembles the [[Greek alphabet|Greek letter]] Γ ({{lang|grc-Latn|[[gamma]]}}).&lt;ref name="MigSym" /&gt;
*''hooked cross'' ({{lang-de|Hakenkreuz|links=no}}), ''angled cross'' ({{lang|de|Winkelkreuz}}) or ''crooked cross'' ({{lang|de|Krummkreuz}}).
* ''cross cramponned,'' ''cramponnée'', or ''cramponny'', in [[heraldry]], as each arm resembles a [[Crampon (heraldry)|Crampon]] or angle-iron ({{lang-de|Winkelmaßkreuz}}).
* ''[[fylfot]]'', chiefly in heraldry and architecture.
* ''tetraskelion'' (Greek: {{lang|grc|τετρασκέλιον}}), literally meaning "four-legged", especially when composed of four conjoined legs (compare [[Triskelion|triskelion/triskele]] [Greek: {{lang|grc|τρισκέλιον}}]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.word.com/idictionary/tetraskelion|title=''Tetraskelion'' Definition and Origin|publisher=Merriam-Webster Inc.|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''whirling logs'' (Navajo, Native American): can denote abundance, prosperity, healing, and luck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/08/07/melissa-codys-whirling-logs-dont-you-dare-call-them-swastikas-150782 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130811070916/http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2013/08/07/melissa-codys-whirling-logs-dont-you-dare-call-them-swastikas-150782 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 August 2013 |title=Melissa Cody's Whirling Logs: Don't You Dare Call Them Swastikas |date=7 August 2013 |website=ICTMN.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|right|Swastika.svg|90|Swastika right-facing.svg|90|Left: the left-facing swastika is a sacred symbol in the [[Bon]] and Buddhist traditions. Right: the right-facing swastika appears commonly in Hinduism and Jainism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= John Powers|title= Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cy980CH84mEC&amp;pg=PA509 |year=2007|publisher= Shambhala|isbn= 978-1-55939-835-0|page=509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Luciano Chessa|title=Luigi Russolo, Futurist: Noise, Visual Arts, and the Occult |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2NGRnEFfmQC&amp;pg=PA34 |year=2012|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-95156-3|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

All swastikas are bent crosses based on a [[chiral]] symmetry—but they appear with different [[Geometry|geometric]] details: as compact crosses with short legs, as crosses with large arms and as motifs in a pattern of unbroken lines. One distinct representation of a swastika, as a double swastika or swastika made of squares, appears in a Nepalese silver mohar coin of 1685, kingdom of Patan (NS 805) KM# 337.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.numista.com/catalogue/pieces59114.html|title=1 Mohar – Yōga Narēndra Malla, Nepal| publisher=Numista |website=en.numista.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chirality describes an absence of [[reflective symmetry]], with the existence of two versions that are [[mirror image]]s of each other. The mirror-image forms are typically described as:
* left-facing (卍) and right-facing (卐);
* left-hand (卍) and right-hand (卐).
The left-facing version is distinguished in some traditions and languages as a distinct symbol from the right-facing and is called the "[[sauwastika]]".

The compact swastika can be seen as a chiral irregular [[icosagon]] (20-sided [[polygon]]) with fourfold (90°) [[rotational symmetry]]. Such a swastika proportioned on a 5 × 5 square grid and with the broken portions of its legs shortened by one unit can [[Tessellation|tile the plane]] by [[Translation (geometry)|translation]] alone. The Nazi ''Hakenkreuz'' used a 5 × 5 diagonal grid, but with the legs unshortened.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://flagspot.net/flags/de%271933.html Swastika Flag Specifications and Construction Sheet (Germany)]". ''[[Flags of the World]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Written characters===
The sauwastika were adopted as a standard character in [[Written Chinese|Chinese]], "{{script|Hant|[[:wikt:卍#Translingual|卍]]}}" ({{zh|p=wàn}}) and as such entered various other [[East Asian languages]], including [[Chinese character|Chinese script]]. In Japanese the symbol is called {{nihongo|"{{lang|ja|[[:wikt:卍#Japanese|卍]]}}"||manji|lead=yes}} or {{nihongo|"{{lang|ja|[[:wikt:卍字#Japanese|卍字]]}}"||manji}}.

The sauwastika is included in the [[Unicode]] character sets of two languages. In the Chinese block it is U+534D [[:wikt:卍|卍]] (left-facing) and U+5350 for the swastika [[:wikt:卐|卐]] (right-facing);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/U4E00.pdf |title="CJK Unified Ideographs" }} {{small|(4.83 MB)}}, ''The Unicode Standard, Version 4.1''. Unicode, Inc. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter has a mapping in the original [[Big5]] character set,&lt;ref&gt;Big5: C9_C3, according to [[Wenlin]]&lt;/ref&gt; but the former does not (although it is in Big5+&lt;ref&gt;Big5+: 85_80, according to [[Wenlin]]&lt;/ref&gt;). In Unicode 5.2, two swastika symbols and two sauwastikas were added to the [[Tibetan (Unicode block)|Tibetan block]]: swastika {{unichar|0FD5|right-facing svasti sign}}, {{unichar|0FD7|right-facing svasti sign with dots}}, and sauwastikas {{unichar|0FD6|left-facing svasti sign}}, {{unichar|0FD8|left-facing svasti sign with dots}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unicode-table.com/en/0FD5/ "Right-Facing Svasti Sign"] (click "next" 3 times)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning of the symbol ==

European hypotheses of the swastika are often treated in conjunction with [[cross symbol]]s in general, such as the [[sun cross]] of [[prehistoric religion|Bronze Age religion]]. Beyond its certain presence in the "[[proto-writing]]" symbol systems, such as the [[Vinca script]],&lt;ref&gt;Paliga S., ''The tablets of Tǎrtǎria'' Dialogues d'histoire ancienne, vol. 19, n°1, 1993. pp. 9–43; [http://www.persee.fr/doc/dha_0755-7256_1993_num_19_1_2073 (Fig.5 on p.28)]&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared during the [[Neolithic]].&lt;ref&gt;Freed, S.

===North pole===
According to [[René Guénon]], the swastika represents the north pole, and the rotational movement around a centre or immutable axis (''[[axis mundi]]''), and only secondly it represents the [[Sun]] as a reflected function of the north pole. As such it is a symbol of life, of the vivifying role of the supreme principle of the universe, the [[absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] [[God]], in relation to the cosmic order. It represents the activity (the Hellenic ''[[Logos]]'', the Hindu ''[[Aum]]'', the Chinese ''[[Chinese theology|Taiyi]]'', "Great One") of the principle of the universe in the formation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guénon|first=René|authorlink1=René Guénon|last2=Fohr|first2=Samuel D.|title=Symbols of Sacred Science|publisher=Sophia Perennis|year=2004|isbn=9780900588785|pages=64–67, 113–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Guénon, the swastika in its polar value has the same meaning of the [[yin and yang]] symbol of the Chinese tradition, and of other traditional symbols of the working of the universe, including the letters Γ ([[gamma (letter)|gamma]]) and G, symbolizing the [[Great Architect of the Universe]] of [[Freemasonry|Freemasonic]] thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guénon|first=René|authorlink1=René Guénon|last2=Fohr|first2=Samuel D.|title=Symbols of Sacred Science|publisher=Sophia Perennis|year=2004|isbn=9780900588785|pages=113–117, 130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the scholar Reza Assasi, the swastika represents the north [[ecliptic north pole]] centred in [[Zeta Draconis|ζ Draconis]], with the constellation [[Draco (constellation)|Draco]] as one of its beams. He argues that this symbol was later attested as the four-horse chariot of [[Mithra]] in ancient [[Iran]]ian culture. They believed the cosmos was pulled by four heavenly horses who revolved around a fixed centre in a clockwise direction. He suggests that this notion later flourished in Roman [[Mithraism]], as the symbol appears in Mithraic iconography and astronomical representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Assasi|first=Reza|title=Swastika: The Forgotten Constellation Representing the Chariot of Mithras|url=https://www.academia.edu/4087681/|type=Supplement: Šprajc, Ivan; Pehani, Peter, eds.

According to the Russan archaeologist [[Gennady Zdanovich]], who studied some of the oldest examples of the symbol in [[Sintashta culture]], the swastika symbolizes the universe, representing the spinning constellations of the [[celestial north pole]] centred in [[Polaris|α Ursae Minoris]], specifically the [[Little Dipper|Little]] and [[Big Dipper]] (or Chariots), or Ursa Minor and Ursa Major.&lt;ref name="ru-sled.ru"&gt;[[Gennady Zdanovich]].

''Русский след'', 26 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, according to René Guénon the swastika is drawn by visualising the Big Dipper/Great Bear in the four phases of revolution around the pole star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guénon|first=René|authorlink1=René Guénon|last2=Fohr|first2=Samuel D.|title=Symbols of Sacred Science|publisher=Sophia Perennis|year=2004|isbn=9780900588785|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comet===
[[File:Mawangdui_Astrology_Comets_Ms.JPG|thumb|220px| Detail of Astrology Manuscript, ink on silk, BCE 2th century, Han, unearthed from Mawangdui tomb 3rd, Chansha, Hunan Province, China.]][[Carl Sagan]] in his book ''[[Comet (book)|Comet]]'' (1985) reproduces a [[Han dynasty|Han-dynasty]] Chinese manuscript (the ''[[Book of Silk]]'', 2nd century BCE) that shows comet tail varieties: most are variations on simple comet tails, but the last shows the comet nucleus with four bent arms extending from it, recalling a swastika. Sagan suggests that in antiquity a [[comet]] could have approached so close to Earth that the jets of gas streaming from it, bent by the comet's rotation, became visible, leading to the adoption of the swastika as a symbol across the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sagan |first=Carl |authorlink=Carl Sagan|author2=Ann Druyan|title=Comet|year=1985|page=496|publisher=Ballantine Books|location= |isbn=0-345-41222-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bob Kobres in his 1992 paper ''Comets and the Bronze Age Collapse'' contends that the swastika-like comet on the Han-dynasty silk comet manuscript was labeled a "long tailed pheasant star" (''dixing'') because of its resemblance to a bird's foot or footprint,&lt;ref name="kobres" /&gt; the latter comparison also being drawn by J.F.K. Hewitt's observation on page 145 of ''Primitive Traditional History: vol. 1''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Primitive Traditional History: The Primitive History and Chronology of India, South-eastern and South-western Asia, Egypt, and Europe, and the Colonies Thence Sent Forth |author=Hewitt, J.F.K. |volume=1 |year=1907 |publisher=J.

According to Mukti Jain, the symbol is part of "an intricate meander pattern of joined up swastikas" found on a late paleolithic figurine of a bird, carved from mammoth ivory, found in [[Mezine]], [[Ukraine]] and dated to 15,000 years old. These engraved objects were found near [[Phallus|phallic]] objects, which states Jain may support the idea that the meandering pattern of swastika was a fertility symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-29644591|title=How the world loved the swastika – until Hitler stole it|first=Mukti Jain|last=Campion|date=23 October 2014|publisher=|access-date=14 February 2017|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it has also been suggested that this swastika may be a stylized picture of a [[stork]] in flight and not the true swastika that is in use today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Flight of the Wild Gander |last=Campbell |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Campbell |year=2002 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[England]], neolithic or Bronze Age stone carvings of the symbol have been found on [[Ilkley Moor]], such as the [[Swastika Stone]].

Mirror-image swastikas (clockwise and anti-clockwise) have been found on ceramic pottery in the [[Devetashka cave]], [[Bulgaria]], dated to 6,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/4220089/Eight_Thousand_Years_Ago_the_Proto-Thracians|title=Dimitrova, Stefania: "8 000 Year Ago Proto-Thracians Depicted the Evolution of the Divine"|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the earliest archaeological evidence of the swastika in the [[Indian subcontinent]] can be dated to 3,000 BCE.&lt;ref name="Kathleen M. Nadeau 2010 87" /&gt; Investigators have also found seals with "mature and geometrically ordered" swastikas that date to before the [[Indus Valley Civilisation]] (3300–1300 BCE). Their efforts have traced references to swastikas in the ''[[Vedas]]'' at about that time. The investigators put forth the theory that the swastika moved westward from India to [[Finland]], [[Scandinavia]], the [[Scottish Highlands|British Highlands]] and other parts of [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff (ndg) [https://www.ancient-code.com/researchers-find-the-swastika-predates-indus-valley-civilization/ "Researchers find the Swastika predates the Indus Valley Civilization"] ''Ancient Code''; citing :lead project investigator" Joy Sen from the [[Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Swastikas have also been found on pottery in archaeological digs in Africa, in the area of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]] and on pottery at the Jebel Barkal temples,&lt;ref&gt;Dunham, Dows "A Collection of 'Pot-Marks' from Kush and Nubia", Kush, 13, 131–147, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Iron Age]] designs of the northern [[Caucasus]] ([[Koban culture]]), and in [[Neolithic China]] in the [[Majiabang culture|Majiabang]],&lt;ref name="xinhua" /&gt;[[Majiayao culture|Majiayao]],&lt;ref name="Daghlian Collection of Chinese Art" /&gt; [[Dawenkou culture|Dawenkou]] and Xiaoheyan cultures.&lt;ref name="epoch" /&gt;

Other Iron Age attestations of the swastika can be associated with [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-European]] cultures such as the [[Illyrians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLcWAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=swastika%20of%20the%20illyrians&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=swastika|title=The Illyrians: history and culture|first=Aleksandar|last=Stipčević|date=1 January 1977|publisher=Noyes Press|access-date=14 February 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Indo-Iranians]], [[Celt]]s, [[Ancient Greeks|Greeks]], [[Swastika (Germanic Iron Age)|Germanic peoples]] and [[Slavs]].

The swastika is also seen in Egypt during the Coptic period. Textile number T.231-1923 held at the V&amp;A Museum in London includes small swastikas in its design. This piece was found at Qau-el-Kebir, near Asyut, and is dated between AD 300 and 600.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O184378/textile-fragment-unknown/ | title=Textile fragment | publisher=V&amp;A Museum | accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://factsfootprint.blogspot.com/2012/10/swastika-symbol-represent-good-or-evil.html|title=a real foot print of facts|last=Rp|first=Aravindan|access-date=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tierwirbel'' (the German for "animal whorl" or "whirl of animals"&lt;ref&gt;a term coined by Anna Roes, "Tierwirbel", IPEK, 1936–37&lt;/ref&gt;) is a characteristic motif in Bronze Age Central Asia, the [[Eurasian Steppe]], and later also in Iron Age [[Scythian]] and [[Iron Age Europe|European]] ([[Baltic peoples|Baltic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=[[Marija Gimbutas]] |url=http://www.vaidilute.com/books/gimbutas/gimbutas-07.html |title=The Balts before the Dawn of History |website=Vaidilute.com |access-date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110165543/http://www.vaidilute.com/books/gimbutas/gimbutas-07.html |archivedate=10 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]]) culture, showing rotational symmetric arrangement of an [[Animal style|animal motif]], often four birds' heads.

==Historical use==
In [[Asia]], the swastika symbol first appears in the archaeological record around&lt;ref name="Kathleen M.

In all these cultures the swastika symbol does not appear to occupy any marked position or significance, but appears as just one form of a series of similar symbols of varying complexity. In the Zoroastrian religion of Persia, the swastika was a symbol of the revolving sun, infinity, or continuing creation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130419073535/http://www.websters-dictionary-online.com/definitions/swastika?cx=partner-pub-0939450753529744:v0qd01-tdlq&amp;cof=FORID:9&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=swastika&amp;sa=Search%23906#906 Dictionary – Definition of swastika&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unique-design.net/library/word/symbol.html|title=A symbol is a thought, a drawing, an action, an archetype, etcetera of the conceptualization of a thing that exists either in reality or in the imagination.|first=Morning Star Athbhreith Athbheochan Kwisatz Haderach|last=Druid|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most common symbols on Mesopotamian coins.&lt;ref name="britswast" /&gt;

In [[Thailand]], the word ''Sawaddi'' is normally used as a greeting that simply means "hello"; Sawaddi-ka (feminine) and Sawaddi-krup (masculine). ''Sawaddi'' derives from the Sanskrit word ''swasti'' and its meaning is a combination of the words ''prosperity, luck, security, glory'', and ''good''.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}{{clear left}}

[[File:Udaygiri &amp; Khandagiri Caves, Bhubaneswar (26) - Oct 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Jain]] symbol (Prateek) containing Swastika at [[Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves]] in [[India]]]]
In [[Jainism]], it is a symbol of the seventh [[Tirthankara|tīrthaṅkara]], [[Suparshvanatha|Suparśvanātha]].&lt;ref name="britswast" /&gt; In the [[Śvētāmbara]] tradition, it is also one of the [[ashtamangala|aṣṭamaṅgala]] or eight auspicious symbols. All [[Jain temple]]s and holy books must contain the swastika and ceremonies typically begin and end with creating a swastika mark several times with rice around the altar. Jains use rice to make a swastika in front of statues and then put an offering on it, usually a ripe or dried fruit, a sweet ({{lang-hi|मिठाई}} {{IAST|miṭhāī}}), or a coin or currency note. The four arms of the swastika symbolize the four places where a soul could be reborn in the cycle of birth and death — [[svarga]] "heaven", [[naraka]] "hell", manushya "humanity" or ''tiryancha'' "as flora or fauna" — before the soul attains [[moksha (Jainism)|moksha]] "salvation" as a [[Siddha#Siddha in Jainism|siddha]], having ended the cycle of birth and death and become [[omniscience|omniscient]].&lt;ref name="Cort 2001 17"/&gt;{{clear left}}

The swastika is an important Hindu symbol.&lt;ref name="p.97" /&gt;&lt;ref name="britswast" /&gt;  The swastika symbol is commonly used before entrances or on doorways of homes or temples, to mark the starting page of financial statements, and [[mandala]] constructed for rituals such as weddings or welcoming a new born.&lt;ref name="britswast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lander2013p27" /&gt;

The Swastika has a particular association with Diwali, being drawn in rangoli (coloured sand) or formed with deepak lights on the floor outside Hindu houses and on wall hangings and other decorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://indiatribune.com/significance-of-swastika-in-diwali-celebrations/ |title=Significance of Swastika in Diwali celebrations |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=October 27, 2010 |website=indiatribune.com |publisher= |access-date=11 November 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the diverse traditions within Hinduism, both the clockwise and counter-clockwise swastika are found, with different meaning. The clockwise or right hand icon is called swastika, while the counter clockwise or left hand is called sauvastika.&lt;ref name="britswast" /&gt; The clockwise swastika is a solar symbol ([[Surya]]), mirroring the motion of Sun in India (the northern hemisphere) where it appears to enter from east, then south, exiting to the west.&lt;ref name="britswast" /&gt; The counterclockwise sauvastika is less used, connotes the night and in tantric traditions it is an icon for goddess [[Kali]], the terrifying form of Devi Durga.&lt;ref name="britswast" /&gt; The symbol also represents activity, karma, motion, wheel, lotus in some contexts.&lt;ref name="Sullivan2001p216" /&gt;&lt;ref name="snodgrass82" /&gt; Its symbolism for motion and Sun may be from shared prehistoric cultural roots, according to Norman McClelland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Norman C.

==== Buddhism ====
In [[Buddhism]], the swastika is considered to symbolize the auspicious footprints of the Buddha.&lt;ref name="britswast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="silverblatt109" /&gt; It is an aniconic symbol for the Buddha in many parts of Asia and a homologous with the [[Dharmachakra|''dharma wheel'']].&lt;ref name="snodgrass82" /&gt; The shape symbolizes eternal cycling, a theme found in [[samsara]] doctrine of Buddhism.&lt;ref name="snodgrass82" /&gt;

The swastika symbol is common in esoteric tantric traditions of Buddhism, along with Hinduism, where it is found with [[Chakra]] theories and other meditative aids.&lt;ref name="Lander2013p27" /&gt; The clockwise symbol is more common, and contrasts with the counter clockwise version common in the Tibetan Bon tradition and locally called ''yungdrung''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Chris Buckley|title=Tibetan Furniture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TDfrAAAAMAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Sambhala|isbn=978-1-891640-20-9|pages=5, 59, 68–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swastika-like symbols were in use in China already in [[Neolithic signs in China|Neolithic]] scripts. The paired swastika symbols (leftwise and rightwise) are included, at least since the [[Liao Dynasty]] (AD 907–1125), as part of the [[Chinese character|Chinese writing system]] (卍 and 卐) and are [[Variant Chinese character|variant characters]] for 萬 or 万 (''wàn'' in Mandarin, ''man'' in Korean, Cantonese, and Japanese, ''vạn'' in Vietnamese) meaning "[[myriad]]", "all", or "eternity. The swastika marks the beginning of many Buddhist scriptures. In East Asian countries, the left-facing character is often used as symbol for Buddhism and marks the site of a Buddhist temple on maps.

[[File:SwastikaCW.svg|thumb|100px|[[Mongolian shamanism]] "Temdeg" symbol]]
In Chinese, Japanese, and Korean the swastika is also a homonym of the number 10,000, and is commonly used to represent the whole of creation, e.g. "the myriad things" in the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]''. During the [[Tang dynasty]], Empress [[Wu Zetian]] (684–704) decreed that the swastika would also be used as an alternative symbol of the Sun.

When the [[Chinese character|Chinese writing system]] was introduced to Japan in the 8th century, the swastika was adopted into the Japanese language and culture. It is commonly referred as the ''manji'' (lit. "man-character"). Since the Middle Ages, it has been used as a ''[[mon (emblem)|mon]]'' by various Japanese families such as [[Tsugaru clan]], [[Hachisuka clan]] or around 60 clans that belong to [[Tokugawa clan]].&lt;ref&gt;(Japanese) Hitoshi Takazawa, ''Encyclopedia of [[Mon (emblem)|Kamon]]'', Tōkyōdō Shuppan, 2008. {{ISBN|978-4-490-10738-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Japanese map symbols|Japanese maps]], a swastika (left-facing and horizontal) is used to mark the location of a Buddhist temple. The right-facing swastika is often referred to as the {{nihongo|''gyaku manji''|逆卍||lit. "reverse swastika"}} or {{nihongo|''migi manji''|右卍||lit. "right swastika"}}, and can also be called {{nihongo|''kagi jūji''|鉤十字||literally "hook cross"}}.

In [[Chinese art|Chinese]] and [[Japanese art|Japanese]] art, the swastika is often found as part of a repeating pattern. One common pattern, called ''sayagata'' in Japanese, comprises left- and right-facing swastikas joined by lines.&lt;ref&gt;"Sayagata　紗綾形". ''[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/sayagata.htm Japanese Architecture and Art Net Users System]''.&lt;/ref&gt; As the negative space between the lines has a distinctive shape, the sayagata pattern is sometimes called the ''key fret'' motif in English.

[[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] theorized that the swastika symbol was associated with [[Thor]], possibly representing his [[Mjolnir]] — symbolic of thunder — and possibly being connected to the Bronze Age sun cross.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON83" /&gt; Davidson cites "many examples" of the swastika symbol from Anglo-Saxon graves of the pagan period, with particular prominence on cremation urns from the cemeteries of East Anglia.&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON83" /&gt; Some of the swastikas on the items, on display at the Cambridge Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, are depicted with such care and art that, according to Davidson, it must have possessed special significance as a [[funerary art|funerary symbol]].&lt;ref name="DAVIDSON83" /&gt; The [[runic inscription]] on the 8th-century [[Sæbø sword]] has been taken as evidence of the swastika as a symbol of Thor in [[Norse paganism]].

According to painter Stanisław Jakubowski the "little sun" (pol. ''słoneczko'') is an [[Early Slavs|Early Slavic]] pagan symbol of the Sun. It was engraved on wooden monuments built near the final resting places of fallen Slavs to represent eternal life. The symbol was first seen in a collection of Early Slavic symbols and architectural features drawn and compiled by [[Poland|Polish]] painter Stanisław Jakubowski, which he named ''Prasłowiańskie motywy architektoniczne'' ({{lang-pl|Early Slavic Architectural Motifs}}). His work was published in 1923, by a publishing house that was then based in the Dębniki district of [[Kraków]].&lt;ref name="Old Slavic Symbols" /&gt; The symbol can also be found on embroidery and pottery in most Slavic countries.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}

In [[Russia]] before [[World War I]] the swastika was a favorite sign of the last Russian Empress [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alexandra Feodorovna]].

=== Greco-Roman antiquity ===
[[Ancient Greek]] architectural, clothing and coin designs are replete with single or interlinking swastika motifs. There are also gold plate [[fibula (brooch)|fibulae]] from the 8th century BCE decorated with an engraved swastika.&lt;ref&gt;Biers, W.R. 1996. ''The Archaeology of Greece'', p. 130. Cornell University Press, Ithaca/London.&lt;/ref&gt; Related symbols in classical Western architecture include the cross, the three-legged triskele or [[triskelion]] and the rounded [[lauburu]]. The swastika symbol is also known in these contexts by a number of names, especially ''gammadion'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/image?lookup=1990.26.0822 |title=Perseus:image:1990.26.0822 |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date=26 February 1990 |access-date=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or rather the tetra-gammadion. The name ''gammadion'' comes from its being seen as being made up of four Greek gamma (Γ) letters. Ancient Greek architectural designs are replete with the interlinking symbol.

In [[Art in Ancient Greece|Greco-Roman]] art and architecture, and in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic art]] in the West, isolated swastikas are relatively rare, and the swastika is more commonly found as a repeated element in a border or tessellation. The swastika often represented perpetual motion, reflecting the design of a rotating windmill or watermill. A meander of connected swastikas makes up the large band that surrounds the [[Augustus|Augustan]] [[Ara Pacis]].

A design of interlocking swastikas is one of several [[tessellation]]s on the floor of the [[Amiens Cathedral|cathedral]] of [[Amiens]], France.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Ferré. "[http://www.labyrinth-enterprises.com/amiens.html Amiens Cathedral]". ''Labyrinth Enterprises''. Constructed from 1220 to 1402, Amiens Cathedral is the largest [[Gothic Architecture|Gothic]] cathedral in France, a popular tourist attraction and since 1981 a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. During World War I, [[Amiens]] was targeted by German forces but remained in Allied territory following the [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]].&lt;/ref&gt; A border of linked swastikas was a common Roman architectural motif,&lt;ref&gt;Gary Malkin. "[http://romanbristol.tripod.com/avon/tockington.html Tockington Park Roman Villa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040521150446/http://romanbristol.tripod.com/avon/tockington.html |date=21 May 2004 }}". ''The Area of Bristol in Roman Times''. 9 December 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; and can be seen in more recent buildings as a neoclassical element. A swastika border is one form of [[meander (art)|meander]], and the individual swastikas in such a border are sometimes called [[Meander (art)|''Greek keys'']]. There have also been swastikas found on the floors of [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref&gt;Lara Nagy, Jane Vadnal, "Glossary Medieval Art and Architecture", [http://www.pitt.edu/~medart/menuglossary/greekkey.htm "Greek key or meander"], [[University of Pittsburgh]] 1997–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Armenia ===
[[File:Armenian Khachkar with Swastikas Sanahin Armenia 1.jpg|thumb|right|[[Khachkar]] with swastikas [[Sanahin]], [[Armenia]]]]
In [[Armenia]] the swastika is called the "[[arevakhach]]" and "kerkhach" ({{lang-hy|կեռխաչ}})&lt;ref name="Concise Armenian Encyclopedia p. 663" /&gt;{{dubious|date=December 2014}} and is the ancient symbol of eternity and eternal light (i.e. God). Swastikas in [[Armenia]] were founded on petroglyphs from the copper age, predating the Bronze Age. During the Bronze Age it was depicted on [[cauldron]]s, belts, [[medallion]]s and other items.&lt;ref&gt;T. Wilson [https://archive.org/details/theswastika00wilsuoft The swastika, the earlist known symbol and its migrations], p. 807, 951&lt;/ref&gt; Among the oldest petroglyphs is the seventh letter of the Armenian alphabet – "E" (which means "is" or "to be") – depicted as a half-swastika.

Swastikas can also be seen on early Medieval churches and fortresses, including the principal tower in Armenia's historical capital city of [[Ani]].&lt;ref name="Concise Armenian Encyclopedia p. 663" /&gt; The same symbol can be found on [[Armenian carpet]]s, cross-stones ([[khachkar]]) and in medieval manuscripts, as well as on modern monuments as a [[Armenian eternity sign|symbol of eternity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Epec69LGa0IC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=symbol+of+eternity+modern+armenia&amp;hl=ru&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tpkRU4-SJYWF4gSbs4HABg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=symbol%20of%20eternity%20modern%20armenia&amp;f=false|title=Armenia|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

In Christianity, the swastika is used as a hooked version of the [[Christian Cross]], the symbol of Christ's victory over death. Some Christian churches built in the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] and [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] eras are decorated with swastikas, carrying over earlier Roman designs. Swastikas are prominently displayed in a [[mosaic]] in the St. Sophia church of [[Kiev]], Ukraine dating from the 12th century. They also appear as a repeating ornamental motif on a tomb in the Basilica of St. Ambrose in [[Milan]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

A [[ceiling]] painted in 1910 in the church of St Laurent in [[Grenoble]] has many swastikas. It can be visited today because the church became the archaeological museum of the city. A proposed direct link between it and a swastika floor mosaic in the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Amiens]], which was built on top of a pagan site at [[Amiens]], France in the 13th century, is considered unlikely. The [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] worn by a priest in the 1445 [[Seven Sacraments Altarpiece|painting of the Seven Sacraments]] by [[Rogier van der Weyden]] presents the swastika form simply as one way of depicting the cross.

Swastikas also appear in art and architecture during the [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] era. The fresco ''The School of Athens'' shows an ornament made out of swastikas, and the symbol can also be found on the facade of the ''Santa Maria della Salute'', a Roman Catholic church and minor basilica located at Punta della Dogana in the Dorsoduro sestiere of the city of [[Venice]].

In the Polish First Republic the symbol of the swastika was also popular with the nobility. According to chronicles, the [[Rus' (people)|Rus']] prince [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]], who in the 9th century [[Rus'-Byzantine War (907)|attacked Constantinople]], nailed his shield (which had a large red swastika painted on it) to the city's gates.&lt;ref name="distedu.ru" /&gt; Several noble houses, e.g. Boreyko, Borzym, and Radziechowski from Ruthenia, also had swastikas as their [[coat of arms]]. The family reached its greatness in the 14th and 15th centuries and its crest can be seen in many heraldry books produced at that time.
The swastika was also a heraldic symbol, for example on the [[Boreyko coat of arms]], used by noblemen in Poland and Ukraine. In the 19th century the swastika was one of the Russian empire's symbols; it was even placed in coins as a background to the [[Russian eagle]].&lt;ref name="klk.pp.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://klk.pp.ru/2007/01/26/svastika_istoricheskie_korni.html |author=Vladimir Nikolaevich|title=The Swastika, the historical roots|publisher=Klk.pp.ru |language=Russian |date= |access-date=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ruskolan.xpomo.com" /&gt;

In the Western world, the symbol experienced a resurgence following the archaeological work in the late 19th century of [[Heinrich Schliemann]], who discovered the symbol in the site of ancient [[Troy]] and associated it with the ancient migrations of [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]], whose proto-language was not coincidentally termed "Proto-Indo-Germanic" by German language historians. He connected it with similar shapes found on ancient pots in Germany, and theorized that the swastika was a "significant religious symbol of our remote ancestors", linking it to ancient [[Teutons]], Greeks of the time of [[Homer]] and Indians of the [[Vedas|Vedic]] era.&lt;ref&gt;Schliemann, H, ''Troy and its remains'', London: Murray, 1875, pp. 102, 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/arts/072900tank-swastika.html|title=One of the World's Great Symbols Strives for a Comeback|first=Sarah|last=Boxer|date=29 June 2000|accessdate=7 May 2012 |publisher=[[The New York Times]]|work=Think Tank}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 20th century, it was used worldwide and was regarded as a symbol of good luck and success.

Schliemann's work soon became intertwined with the ''[[Völkisch movement|völkisch]]'' movements, which used the swastika as a symbol for the "[[Aryan race]]"—a concept that theorists such as [[Alfred Rosenberg]] equated with a [[Nordic race|Nordic]] [[master race]] originating in northern Europe. Since its adoption by the [[Nazi Party]] of [[Adolf Hitler]], the swastika has been associated with Nazism, fascism, racism in its ([[white supremacy]]) form, the [[Axis powers]] in World War II, and [[the Holocaust]] in much of the West. The swastika remains a core symbol of neo-Nazi groups.

The Benedictine choir school at [[Lambach Abbey]], Upper Austria, which Hitler attended for several months as a boy, had a swastika chiseled into the monastery portal and also the wall above the spring grotto in the courtyard by 1868. Their origin was the personal [[coat of arms]] of Abbot [[Theoderich Hagn]] of the monastery in Lambach, which bore a golden swastika with slanted points on a blue field.&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Swastika|Dutch article in Wikipedia "Swastika"]]; [http://www.humanitas-international.org/holocaust/1889-99t.htm Holocaust Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120801224433/http://www.humanitas-international.org/holocaust/1889-99t.htm |date=1 August 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lambach swastika is probably of Medieval origin.

In the 1880s the [[Theosophical Society]] adopted a swastika as part of its seal, along with an [[Om]], a hexagram or [[star of David]], an [[Ankh]] and an [[Ouroboros]]. Unlike the much more recent [[Raëlian movement]], the Theosophical Society symbol has been free from controversy, and the seal is still used. The current seal also includes the text "There is no religion higher than truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ts-adyar.org/content/emblem|title=Emblem or the Seal – TS Adyar|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ireland ====
The [[Swastika Laundry]] was a laundry founded in 1912, located on Shelbourne Road, [[Ballsbridge]], a district of [[Dublin]], Ireland. In the fifties [[Heinrich Böll]] came across a van belonging to the company while he was staying in Ireland, leading to some awkward moments before he realized the company was older than Nazism and totally unrelated to it. The chimney of the boiler-house of the laundry still stands, but the laundry has been redeveloped.&lt;ref name="IT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Comehere" /&gt;

==== Finland ====
In Finland the swastika ("hakaristi", meaning hook-cross) was often used in traditional folk art products, as a decoration or magical symbol on textiles and wood. The swastika was also used by the [[Finnish Air Force]] until 1945, and is still used on air force flags.

The [[tursaansydän]] is used by [[scouting|scouts]] in some instances&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitva.partio.net |title=Partiolippukunta Pitkäjärven Vaeltajat ry |publisher=Pitva.partio.net |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a student organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kainuun Kerho |url=http://ppo.osakunta.fi/kainuunkerho/ |title=Kainuun Kerho |publisher=Ppo.osakunta.fi |date=18 September 2009 |accessdate=2 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091005010249/http://ppo.osakunta.fi/kainuunkerho/ |archivedate=5 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The village of Tursa uses the tursaansydän as a kind of a certificate of authenticity on products made there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tursa.fi/info/tursaansydan.html |title=Tursan Sydän |publisher=Tursa.fi |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional textiles are still being made with swastikas as parts of traditional ornaments.

The [[Finnish Air Force]] used the swastika as an emblem, introduced in 1918. The type of swastika adopted by the air-force was the symbol of luck for the Swedish count [[Eric von Rosen]], who donated one of its earliest aircraft; he later became a prominent figure in the Swedish nazi-movement.

The swastika was also used by the women's paramilitary organization [[Lotta Svärd]], which was banned in 1944 in accordance with the [[Moscow Armistice]] between Finland and the [[Allies of World War II|allied]] [[Soviet Union]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]].

The [[President of Finland]] is the grand master of the [[Order of the White Rose]]. According to the protocol, the president shall wear the Grand Cross of the White Rose with collar on formal occasions. The original design of the collar, decorated with 9 swastikas, dates from 1918, and was designed by the artist [[Akseli Gallen-Kallela]]. The Grand Cross with the swastika collar has been awarded 41 times to foreign heads of state. To avoid misunderstandings, the swastika decorations were replaced by fir crosses at the decision of president [[Urho Kekkonen]] in 1963 after it became known that the [[President of France]] [[Charles De Gaulle]] was uncomfortable with the swastika collar.

Also a design by Gallen-Kallela from 1918, the [[Order of the Cross of Liberty|Cross of Liberty]] has a swastika pattern in its arms. The Cross of Liberty is depicted in the upper left corner of the standard of the President of Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tpk.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=41443&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 Flag] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110720194040/http://www.tpk.fi/public/default.aspx?nodeid=41443&amp;culture=en-US&amp;contentlan=2 |date=20 July 2011 }} The President of the Republic Of Finland&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, a silver replica of the World War II period Finnish air defence's relief ring decorated with a swastika became available as a part of a charity campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rautasormus.fi |title=Campaign site rautasormus.fi (campaign now closed) |publisher=Rautasormus.fi |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221232818/http://www.rautasormus.fi/ |archivedate=21 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original war time idea was that the public swap their precious metal rings for the State air defence's relief ring, made of iron.

==== Poland ====
The traditional symbols of the Podhale Rifles include the [[edelweiss]] flower and the Mountain Cross, a swastika symbol popular in folk culture of the Polish mountainous regions. The units of Podhale Rifles, both historical and modern, are notable for their high morale and distinctive uniforms.

==== Sweden ====
[[File:ASEA logo pre 1933.jpg|thumb|120px|ASEA logo prior to 1933.]]
The Swedish company [[ASEA]], now a part of [[ABB]], in the late 1800s introduced a company [[logo]] featuring a swastika. The logo was replaced in 1933, when [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in [[Germany]]. During the early 1900s, the swastika was used as a symbol of electric power, perhaps because it resembled a [[waterwheel]] or [[turbine]]. On maps of the period, the sites of hydroelectric [[power station]]s were marked with swastikas.

==== Norway ====
[[File:Lysverker 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Wrought iron gate of the Oslo Municipal Power Station, 1932]]
The headquarters of the [[Oslo]] Municipal [[Power station|Power Station]] was designed by architects ''Bjercke and Eliassen'' in 1928–31. Swastikas adorn its wrought iron gates. The architects knew the swastika as a symbol of ''electricity'' and were probably not yet aware that it had been usurped by the German Nazi party and would soon become the foremost symbol of the German [[Reich]]. The fact that these gates survived the cleanup after the [[German occupation of Norway]] during [[WW II]] is a testimony to the innocence and good faith of the power plant and its architects.

=== North America ===
[[File:Patch of the 45th Infantry Division (1924-1939).svg|thumb|right|120px|The old symbol of the US 45th Infantry Division]]
The swastika motif is found in some traditional [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] art and iconography. Historically, the design has been found in excavations of [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]]-era sites in the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River]] valleys, and on objects associated with the [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex#Motifs|Southeastern Ceremonial Complex (S.E.C.C.)]]. It is also widely used by a number of [[Southwestern United States|southwestern]] tribes, most notably the [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]], and [[Plains Indians|plains nations]] such as the [[Dakota people|Dakota]]. Among various tribes, the swastika carries different meanings. To the [[Hopi]] it represents the wandering Hopi clan; to the Navajo it is one symbol for the whirling log (''tsin náálwołí''), a sacred image representing a legend that is used in healing rituals.&lt;ref&gt;Dottie Indyke. "[http://www.collectorsguide.com/fa/fa086.shtml The History of an Ancient Human Symbol]". 4 April 2005. originally from ''The Wingspread Collector's Guide to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico|Albuquerque]]'', Volume 15.&lt;/ref&gt; A brightly colored [[First Nations]] saddle featuring swastika designs is on display at the [[Royal Saskatchewan Museum]] in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Photo and text,[http://www.royalsaskmuseum.ca/research/faqs/ex_8.shtml "Why is there a Swastika on the saddle in the First Nations Gallery?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060118021210/http://www.royalsaskmuseum.ca/research/faqs/ex_8.shtml |date=18 January 2006 }}, Royal [[Saskatchewan]] Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Passamaquoddy]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribe, now located in the state of [[Maine]] and in [[Canada]], used an elongated swastika on their war canoes in the American colonial period as well as later.&lt;ref&gt;Adney, Edwin Tappan and Chapelle, Howard I. (2015) ''The Bark Canoes and Skin Boats of North America''. Washington, D.C.: [[Smithsonian Institution]]. {{isbn|9781588345226}}&lt;/ref&gt; A carving of a canoe with a Passamaquody swastika was found in a ruin in the [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne Forest]] in [[France]], having been carved there by Moses Neptune, an American soldier of Passamaquody heritage, who was one of the last American soldiers to die in battle in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;Wickham, Jonathan (writer) (2016) ''Americans Underground: Secret City of WWI'' (TV documentary), Lone Wolf Media (producer) for [[Smithsonian Networks]] Accessed: 14 December 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1930s, the symbol for the [[45th Infantry Division (United States)|45th Infantry Division of the United States Army]] was a red diamond with a yellow swastika, a tribute to the large Native American population in the southwestern United States.

A swastika shape is a symbol in the culture of the [[Kuna (people)|Kuna people]] of [[Kuna Yala]], Panama. In Kuna tradition it symbolizes the octopus that created the world, its tentacles pointing to the four cardinal points.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rainforestart.com/creationch.htm ''Chants and Myths about Creation''], from Rainforest Art. Retrieved 25 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1925 the Kuna revolted vigorously against Panamanian suppression of their culture, and in 1930 they assumed autonomy. The flag they adopted at that time is based on the swastika shape, and remains the official flag of Kuna Yala. A number of variations on the flag have been used over the years: red top and bottom bands instead of orange were previously used, and in 1942 a ring (representing the traditional Kuna nose-ring) was added to the center of the flag to distance it from the symbol of the Nazi party.&lt;ref name="Panama - Native Peoples" /&gt;

The town of [[Swastika, Ontario| Swastika, Ontario, Canada]] is named after the symbol.

From 1909 to 1916, the K-R-I-T automobile, manufactured in Detroit, Michigan, used a right-facing swastika as their trademark.

===Use in Nazism===
{{Further|Nazi symbolism}}
The swastika was widely used in Europe at the start of the 20th century. It symbolized many things to the Europeans, with the most common symbolism being of good luck and auspiciousness.&lt;ref name=holocaust2009 /&gt; In the wake of [[Western use of the Swastika in the early 20th century|widespread popular usage]], in [[Weimar Republic|post-World War I Germany]], the newly established [[Nazi Party]] formally adopted the {{lang|de|Hakenkreuz}} ({{IPA-de|ˈhaːkn̩kʁɔʏts|lang}}, meaning "hooked-cross") in 1920&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007453|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|title=History of the Swastika|accessdate=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/03/18/mysterious-wwii/|last=A.|first=Aleksandra|title=Planted in 1933 this mysterious forest swastika remained unnoticed until 1992 – it was then quickly cut down|date=18 March 2018|publisher=The Vintage News|access-date=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emblem was a black swastika (hooks branching clockwise) rotated 45 degrees on a white circle on a red background. This insignia was used on the party's flag, badge, and armband.

In his 1925 work {{lang|de|[[Mein Kampf]]}}, Adolf Hitler writes that: "I myself, meanwhile, after innumerable attempts, had laid down a final form; a flag with a red background, a white disk, and a black swastika in the middle. After long trials I also found a definite proportion between the size of the flag and the size of the white disk, as well as the shape and thickness of the swastika."

When Hitler created a flag for the Nazi Party, he sought to incorporate both the swastika and "those revered colors expressive of our homage to the glorious past and which once brought so much honor to the German nation." (Red, white, and black were the colors of the [[flag of Germany#North German Confederation and the German Empire (1866–1918)|flag of the old German Empire]].) He also stated: "As National Socialists, we see our program in our flag. In red, we see the social idea of the movement; in white, the nationalistic idea; in the swastika, the mission of the struggle for the victory of the [[Aryan]] man, and, by the same token, the victory of the idea of creative work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks02/0200601.txt |title=text of ''Mein Kampf'' at Project Gutenberg of Australia |publisher=Gutenberg.net.au |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The swastika was also understood as "the symbol of the creating, effecting life" ({{lang|de|das Symbol des schaffenden, wirkenden Lebens}}) and as "race emblem of Germanism" ({{lang|de|Rasseabzeichen des Germanentums}}).&lt;ref&gt;Walther Blachetta: {{lang|de|Das Buch der deutschen Sinnzeichen}} (The book of German sense characters); reprint of 1941; page 47&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the swastika was incorporated by Nazi theorists with their conjecture of Aryan cultural descent of the German people. The fascination of the German people with Aryanism arose when artifacts with swastikas on them were found near the Trojan city of Troy by {{lang|de|Heinrich Schliemann}}. The Nazi party was looking for the symbol that would preferably catch the attention of all of Germany and the swastika had that potential. It became a symbol to unify the German people, to a conjecture about their ancestors, Aryan identity and nationalistic pride. It also allowed the Nazi party to establish their anti-Semitic views, as well as terrify Jews and the enemies of the Nazi state.&lt;ref name=holocaust2009 /&gt;

The concept of [[racial hygiene]] was an ideology central to Nazism, though it is [[scientific racism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Racial Hygiene: Medicine Under the Nazis |page=220 |publisher=Harvard University Press |author=Robert Proctor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hogbxS2Gp1QC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wellborn Science: Eugenics in Germany, France, Brazil, and Russia: Eugenics in Germany, France, Brazil, and Russia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iX0IOWHsoAUC |page=43 |author=Mark B. Adams |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1990 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For {{lang|de|Alfred Rosenberg}}, the Aryans of India were both a model to be imitated and a warning of the dangers of the spiritual and racial "confusion" that, he believed, arose from the proximity of races. Thus, they saw fit to co-opt the sign as a symbol of the Aryan master race. The use of the swastika as a symbol of the Aryan race dates back to writings of [[Emile Burnouf]]. Following many other writers, the German nationalist poet [[Guido von List]] believed it was a uniquely Aryan symbol.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Before the Nazis, the swastika was already in use as a symbol of German {{lang|de|völkisch}} nationalist movements ({{lang|de|[[Völkisch movement|Völkische Bewegung]]}}).

José Manuel Erbez says:
{{Quote|The first time the swastika was used with an "Aryan" meaning was on 25 December 1907, when the self-named [[Order of the New Templars]], a secret society founded by [[Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels|Lanz von Liebenfels]], hoisted at {{ill|Werfenstein Castle|de|Burg Werfenstein|vertical-align=sup}} ([[Austria]]) a yellow flag with a swastika and four [[fleur-de-lys|fleurs-de-lys]].&lt;ref&gt;José Manuel Erbez.

However, Liebenfels was drawing on an already established use of the symbol.

On 14 March 1933, shortly after Hitler's appointment as Chancellor of Germany, the NSDAP flag was hoisted alongside Germany's national colors. An adaption of the NSDAP flag – with the swastika slightly offset from center – was adopted as the sole national flag of Germany on 15 September 1935.

The swastika was used for badges and flags throughout [[Nazi Germany]], particularly for government and military organizations, but also for "popular" organizations such as the {{lang|de|Reichsbund Deutsche Jägerschaft}} ([[Deutsche Jägerschaft|German Hunting Society]]).&lt;ref&gt;Santiago Dotor and Norman Martin.

While the DAP and the NSDAP had used both right-facing and left-facing swastikas, the right-facing swastika was used consistently from 1920 onwards. Ralf Stelter notes that the swastika flag used on land had a right-facing swastika on both sides, while the ensign (naval flag) had it printed through so that a left-facing swastika would be seen when looking at the ensign with the flagpole to the right.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sensen, António Martins, Norman Martin, and Ralf Stelter.

===Use by anti-Nazis===

During World War II it was common to use small swastikas to mark air-to-air victories on the sides of Allied aircraft, and at least one British fighter pilot inscribed a swastika in his logbook for each German plane he shot down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/world-war-two/10764884/Battle-of-Britain-heros-medals-to-go-under-the-hammer.html|title=Battle of Britain hero's medals to go under the hammer|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post–World War II stigmatization ===
Because of its use by Nazi Germany, the swastika since the 1930s has been largely associated with Nazism. In the aftermath of World War II it has been considered a symbol of hate in the West,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Verhulsdonck, Gustav|title=Digital Rhetoric and Global Literacies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ed9GAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|year=2013|publisher=IGI|isbn=978-1-4666-4917-0|page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively of white supremacy in many Western countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dawn Perlmutter|title=Investigating Religious Terrorism and Ritualistic Crimes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QPnKBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA242|year=2003|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-4104-0|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, all of its use, or its use as a Nazi or hate symbol, is prohibited in some countries, including Germany. Because of the stigma attached to the symbol, many buildings that have used the symbol as decoration have had the symbol removed.{{Citation needed|date = February 2017}} In some countries, such as the United States' ''Virginia v. Black'' 2003 case, the highest courts have ruled that the local governments can prohibit the use of swastika along with other symbols such as cross burning, if the intent of the use is to intimidate others.&lt;ref name=wiener463 /&gt;

==== Germany ====
{{Further|Strafgesetzbuch section 86a}}
The German and Austrian postwar [[Strafgesetzbuch|criminal code]] makes the public showing of the {{lang|de|Hakenkreuz}} (the swastika), the [[sig rune]], the [[Celtic cross]] (specifically the variations used by white power activists), the {{lang|de|[[wolfsangel]]}}, the [[odal (rune)|odal rune]] and the {{lang|de|[[Totenkopf]]}} skull illegal, except for scholarly reasons (and, in the case of the odal rune, as the insignia of the rank of sergeant major, {{lang|de|Hauptfeldwebel}},&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Hauptfeldwebel]]{{Better source|date=November 2018|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the modern German {{lang|de|Bundeswehr}}). It is also censored from the reprints of 1930s railway timetables published by the {{lang|de|[[Reichsbahn]]}}. The eagle remains{{where|date=June 2018}}, but appears to hold a solid black circle between its talons. The swastikas on Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain temples are exempt, as religious symbols cannot be banned in Germany.

The German fashion company [[Esprit Holdings]] was investigated for using traditional British-made folded leather buttons after complaints that they resembled swastikas. In response, Esprit Holdings destroyed two hundred thousand catalogues.&lt;ref name="ejp-button" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rawstory.com/news/2006/German_prosecutors_drop_probe_into__10192006.html "Prosecutors drop probe into swastika buttons"], {{lang|de|dpa Deutsche Presse-Agentur GmbH}} German News Service, 19 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A controversy was stirred by the decision of several police departments to begin inquiries against anti-fascists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spcm.org/Journal/article.php3?id_article=1869 |work=Le Journal Chrétien |title=Stuttgart Seeks to Ban Anti-Fascist Symbols |publisher=Spcm.org |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2005 police raided the offices of the [[punk rock]] label and mail order store "Nix Gut Records" and confiscated merchandise depicting crossed-out swastikas and fists smashing swastikas. In 2006 the {{lang|de|[[Stade]]}} police department started an inquiry against anti-fascist youths using a placard depicting a person dumping a swastika into a trashcan. The placard was displayed in opposition to the campaign of right-wing nationalist parties for local elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.tageblatt.de/main.cfm?DID=747071 Tageblatt] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113164205/http://www.tageblatt.de/main.cfm?DID=747071 |date=13 January 2009 }} 23 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On Friday, 17 March 2006, a member of the {{lang|de|[[Bundestag]]}}, [[Claudia Roth]] reported herself to the German police for displaying a crossed-out swastika in multiple demonstrations against [[Neo-Nazis]], and subsequently got the Bundestag to suspend her immunity from prosecution. She intended to show the absurdity of charging anti-fascists with using fascist symbols: "We don't need prosecution of non-violent young people engaging against right-wing extremism." On 15 March 2007, the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] ({{lang|de|Bundesgerichtshof}}) held that the crossed-out symbols were "clearly directed against a revival of national-socialist endeavors", thereby settling the dispute for the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=pm&amp;Datum=2007&amp;Sort=3&amp;Seite=5&amp;anz=200&amp;pos=164&amp;nr=39349&amp;linked=urt&amp;Blank=1&amp;file=dokument.pdf |title=3 StR 486/06 |publisher=[[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://juris.bundesgerichtshof.de/cgi-bin/rechtsprechung/document.py?Gericht=bgh&amp;Art=pm&amp;Datum=2007&amp;Sort=3&amp;Seite=5&amp;nr=39202&amp;pos=164&amp;anz=200 |title=Bundesgerichtshof press statement No. 36/2007 |publisher=[[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]] |date=15 March 2007 |accessdate=2 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,471880,00.html |title=Anti-Nazi-Symbole sind nicht strafbar |trans-title=Anti-Nazi symbols are not forbidden |work=Der Spiegel |language=de |date=15 March 2007 |accessdate=2 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Legislation in other European countries ====
* Until 2013 in [[Hungary]], it was a criminal misdemeanour to publicly display "totalitarian symbols", including the swastika, the [[SS]] insignia, and the [[Arrow Cross]], punishable by custodial arrest.&lt;ref name=hu-const-court /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Act C of 2012 on the Criminal Code, Section 335: Use of Symbols of Totalitarianism|url=http://thb.kormany.hu/download/a/46/11000/Btk_EN.pdf|page=97|website=Ministry of Interior of Hungary|accessdate=21 February 2017|quote=Any person who: a) distributes, b) uses before the public at large, or c) publicly exhibits, the swastika, the insignia of the SS, the arrow cross, the sickle and hammer, the five-pointed red star or any symbol depicting the above so as to breach public peace – specifically in a way to offend the dignity of victims of totalitarian regimes and their right to sanctity – is guilty of a misdemeanor punishable by custodial arrest, insofar as it did not result in a more serious criminal offense.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Display for academic, educational, artistic or journalistic reasons was allowed at the time. The [[communist symbol]]s of [[hammer and sickle]] and the [[red star]] were also regarded as totalitarian symbols and had the same restriction by Hungarian criminal law until 2013.&lt;ref name=hu-const-court /&gt;
*In [[Latvia]], public display of Nazi and Soviet symbols, including the Nazi swastika, is prohibited in public events since 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/latvia-bans-nazi-symbols-in-public-1.5283630|title=Latvia Bans Nazi, Soviet Symbols at Public Events|date=2013-06-20|work=Haaretz|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.upi.com/Latvian-bill-would-ban-Soviet-Nazi-symbols/58631371833846/|title=Latvian bill would ban Soviet, Nazi symbols|last=|first=|date=2013-06-21|work=UPI|access-date=2018-11-08|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a court case from 2007 a regional court in Riga held that the swastika can be used as a ethographic symbol, in which case the ban does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://lvportals.lv/skaidrojumi/255373-ka-aizliegt-to-kas-jau-ir-aizliegts-2013|title=Kā aizliegt to, kas jau ir aizliegts? - LV portāls|last=lvportals.lv|first=|date=2013-05-07|work=|access-date=2018-11-08|language=lv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Lithuania]], public display of Nazi and Soviet symbols, including the Nazi swastika, is an administrative offence, punishable by a fine from 150 to 300 [[euros]]. According to judicial practice, display of a non-Nazi swastika is legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jurist.org/paperchase/2010/05/lithuania-court-rules-swastikas-are-part-of-historic-legacy.php |title=Lithuania court rules swastikas are part of historic legacy |last=Stemple |first=Hillary |date=20 May 2010 |website=[[JURIST]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Poland, public display of Nazi symbols, including the [[Nazi]] swastika, is a criminal offence punishable by up to eight years of imprisonment. The use of the swastika as a religious symbol is legal.&lt;ref name=tele-che /&gt;

==== Attempted ban in the European Union ====
The [[European Commission|European Union's Executive Commission]] proposed a European Union-wide anti-racism law in 2001, but European Union states failed to agree on the balance between prohibiting racism and freedom of expression.&lt;ref name=EthanMcNern /&gt; An attempt to ban the swastika across the EU in early 2005 failed after objections from the British Government and others. In early 2007, while Germany held the European Union presidency, Berlin proposed that the European Union should follow German Criminal Law and criminalize the [[Holocaust denial|denial of the Holocaust]] and the display of Nazi symbols including the swastika, which is based on the Ban on the Symbols of Unconstitutional Organizations Act. This led to an opposition campaign by Hindu groups across Europe against a ban on the swastika. They pointed out that the swastika has been around for 5,000 years as a symbol of peace.&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6269627.stm Hindus opposing EU swastika ban], [[BBC]] online, 17 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Staff (source dgs/[[Reuters]])[http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,460259,00.html Hindus Against Proposed EU Swastika Ban] [[Der Spiegel]] online, 17 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal to ban the swastika was dropped by Berlin from the proposed [[Fundamental Rights Agency|European Union wide anti-racism laws]] on 29 January 2007.&lt;ref name=EthanMcNern /&gt;

==== Latin America ====
* The manufacture, distribution or broadcasting of the swastika, with the intent to propagate Nazism, is a crime in [[Brazil]] as dictated by article 20, paragraph 1, of federal statute 7.716, passed in 1989. The penalty is a two to five years prison term and a fine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/LEIS/L7716.htm Brazilian Federal Statute 7.716] 1989-05-01, (Portuguese)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The former flag of the [[Guna Yala]] autonomous territory of [[Panama]] was based on a swastika design. In 1942 a ring was added to the centre of the flag to differentiate it from the symbol of the [[Nazi Party]] (this version subsequently fell into disuse).&lt;ref name="Panama - Native Peoples" /&gt;

==== United States====
As the public display of [[Nazi]]-era German flags (or any other flags) is protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which guarantees the right to [[freedom of speech]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shuster|first1=Simon|title=How the Nazi Flags in Charlottesville Look to a German|url=http://time.com/4900385/charlottesville-nazi-kkk-swastika-germany-reaction/|accessdate=15 August 2017|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Nazi ''[[Reichskriegsflagge]]'' has also been seen on display at white supremacist "events" within United States borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/nation-world/world/article29557972.html |title=How Germany dealt with its symbols of hate |last=Schofield |first=Matthew |date=30 July 2015 |website=mcclatchydc.com |publisher=McClatchy DC Bureau |access-date=18 August 2017 |quote=It’s notable that when Ku Klux Klan members recently rallied in South Carolina, they carried both the battle flag and the Nazi swastika.

As with many [[neo-Nazi]] groups across the world, the swastika was also a part of the [[American Nazi Party]]'s flag before its first dissolution in 1967 – its "re-use" was initiated by successor organizations in 1983, without the publicity Rockwell's original organization possessed. The symbol was originally chosen by the initial organization's founder, George L. Rockwell.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick J. Simonelli (1995), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24451464 The American Nazi Party, 1958–1967], The Historian, Vol. 57, No. 3 (SPRING 1995), pp. 553–566&lt;/ref&gt;

The swastika, in various iconographic forms, is one of the hate symbols identified in use as [[graffiti]] in the schools of the United States, and is a part of the 1999 US Department of Education's emergency school-wide response trigger.&lt;ref&gt;Carnes, Jim (1999), [http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED437466.pdf Responding to Hate at School: A Guide for Teachers, Counselors and Administrators], ERIC, Department of Education, US Government, pages 9–11, 33, 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Media ====
In 2010, [[Microsoft]] officially spoke out against use of the swastika by players of the [[first-person shooter]] ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]''. In ''Black Ops'', players are allowed to customize their name tags to represent, essentially, whatever they want. The swastika can be created and used, but [[Stephen Toulouse]], director of [[Xbox Live]] policy and enforcement, stated that players with the symbol on their name tag will be banned (if someone reports as inappropriate) from Xbox Live.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Black Ops Swastika Emblems Will Earn Xbox Live Ban|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/105501-Black-Ops-Swastika-Emblems-Will-Earn-Xbox-Live-Ban|publisher = [[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]|date=22 November 2010 |accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Indiana Jones Stunt Spectacular]]'' in [[Disney Hollywood Studios]] in Orlando, Florida, the swastikas on German trucks, aircraft and actor uniforms in the reenactment of a scene from ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' were removed in 2004. The swastika has been replaced by a stylized [[Greek Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mouse Machine: Disney and Technology, p. 201|author=Jay P.

Nazi imagery was adapted and incorporated into the 2016 sci-fi movie ''[[2BR02B: To Be or Naught to Be]]''. Its inclusion was to subliminally draw parallels between the movie's Federal Bureau of Termination and Nazi Germany, and also refer to [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s experiences as a [[POW]] and the influence [[World War II]] played in his imagining of a population-controlled future where authorities use [[gas chambers]] to terminate people. The Federal Bureau of Termination logo appears as a white geometric design with a black outline, centered on vertical banners, in reference to the Third Reich banners. These banners were initially red, until the crew felt the allusion was too strong. The movie's hospital was envisaged as the Bureau's branch that controlled birth, and their [[red cross]] was given 'wings' to transform it into a swastika, and link it to the Bureau's logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Masson |first=Sophie |author-link=Sophie Masson |title=2BR02B: the journey of a dystopian film–an interview with Leon Coward |website=Feathers of the Firebird |url=https://firebirdfeathers.com/2016/10/19/2br02b-the-journey-of-a-dystopian-film-an-interview-with-leon-coward/ |date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
==== Central Asia ====
In 2005, authorities in [[Tajikistan]] called for the widespread adoption of the swastika as a national [[symbol]]. President [[Emomali Rahmonov]] declared the swastika an [[Aryan]] symbol, and 2006 "the year of Aryan culture," which would be a time to "study and popularize Aryan contributions to the history of the world civilization, raise a new generation (of Tajiks) with the spirit of national self-determination, and develop deeper ties with other ethnicities and cultures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Saidazimova |first=Gulnoza |url=http://www.rferl.org/featuresarticle/2005/12/27f36005-4b37-4ada-87e0-034f33867c8e.html |title=Tajikistan: Officials Say Swastika Part Of Their Aryan Heritage – Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty © 2008 |publisher=Rferl.org |date=23 December 2005 |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In East Asia, the swastika is prevalent in Buddhist monasteries and communities. It is commonly found in Buddhist temples, religious artefacts, texts related to Buddhism and schools founded by Buddhist religious groups. It also appears as a design or motif (singularly or woven into a pattern) on textiles, architecture and various decorative objects as a symbol of luck and good fortune. The icon is also found as a sacred symbol in the Bon tradition, but in the left facing mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= John Powers|title= Introduction to Tibetan Buddhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cy980CH84mEC&amp;pg=PA509 |year=2007|publisher= Shambhala|isbn= 978-1-55939-835-0|pages=508–509}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lee86 /&gt;

Many [[Chinese folk religion|Chinese religions]] make use of the swastika symbol, including [[Guiyidao]] and [[Shanrendao]]. The [[Red Swastika Society]], which is the philanthropic branch of Guiyidao, runs two schools in Hong Kong (the Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tai Po Secondary School&lt;ref&gt;[Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tai Po Secondary School Official website http://www.hkrsstpss.edu.hk]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tuen Mun Primary School&lt;ref&gt;[Hong Kong Red Swastika Society Tuen Mun Primary School website http://www.hkrsstmps.edu.hk]&lt;/ref&gt;) and one in Singapore ([[Red Swastika School]]). All of them show the swastika in their logos.

Among the predominantly Hindu population of [[Bali]], in [[Indonesia]], the swastika is common in temples, homes and public spaces. Similarly, the swastika is a common icon associated with Buddha's footprints in Theravada Buddhist communities of Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia.&lt;ref name=lee86 /&gt;

In Japan, the swastika is also used as a [[List of Japanese map symbols|map symbol]] and is designated by the Survey Act and related Japanese governmental rules to denote a [[Buddhist temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsi.go.jp/MAPSAKUSEI/25000SAKUSEI/zushiki-zushiki.html#tatemono |script-title=ja:平成１４年２万５千分１地形図図式 |author= |date= |month= |year= |work= |publisher=Geospatial Information Authority of Japan |language=Japanese |trans-title=2002 1:25000 Topographical Map Scheme |accessdate=21 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city of [[Hirosaki]] in [[Aomori Prefecture]] designates this symbol as its official flag, which stemmed from its use in the emblem of the [[Tsugaru clan]], the lords of [[Hirosaki Domain]] during the [[Edo period]].

==== Indian subcontinent ====
In India, Nepal and Sri Lanka, the swastika is common. Temples, businesses and other organisations, such as the Buddhist libraries, [[Ahmedabad Stock Exchange]] and the Nepal Chamber of Commerce,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nepalnews.com/today/frontpic/2008/mar/mar30.htm |title=daily picture (News from Nepal as it happens):: |publisher=Nepalnews.com |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; use the swastika in reliefs or logos.&lt;ref name=lee86 /&gt; Swastikas are ubiquitous in Indian and Nepalese communities, located on shops, buildings, transport vehicles, and clothing. The swastika remains prominent in Hindu ceremonies such as weddings. The left facing ''sauwastika'' symbol is found in tantric rituals.&lt;ref name=britswast /&gt;

[[Musaeus College]] in Colombo, [[Sri Lanka]], a Buddhist girls' school, has a left facing swastika in their school logo.

In India, swastik and swastika, with their spelling variants, are first names for males and females respectively, for instance with [[Swastika Mukherjee]]. The [[Seal of Bihar]] contains two swastikas.{{clear left}}

==== Western misinterpretation of Asian use ====
Since the end of the 20th century, and through the early 21st century, confusion and controversy has occurred when consumer goods bearing the traditional Jain, Buddhist, or Hindu symbols have been exported to the West, notably to North America and Europe, and have been interpreted by consumers as bearing a Nazi symbol. This has resulted in several such products having been boycotted or pulled from shelves.

When a ten-year-old boy in [[Lynbrook, New York]], bought a set of [[Pokémon Trading Card Game|Pokémon cards]] imported from Japan in 1999, two of the cards contained the left-facing Buddhist swastika. The boy's parents misinterpreted the symbol as the right-facing Nazi swastika and filed a complaint to the manufacturer. [[Nintendo of America]] announced that the cards would be discontinued, explaining that what was acceptable in one culture was not necessarily so in another; their action was welcomed by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] who recognised that there was no intention to offend, but said that international commerce meant that, "Isolating [the Swastika] in Asia would just create more problems."&lt;ref name="Pokémon cards" /&gt;

In 2002, [[Christmas cracker]]s containing plastic toy red pandas sporting swastikas were pulled from shelves after complaints from consumers in Canada. The manufacturer, based in China, said the symbol was presented in a traditional sense and not as a reference to the Nazis, and apologized to the customers for the cross-cultural mixup.&lt;ref&gt;[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News]] 30 December 2002: [http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2002/12/30/swastika021230.html Toy pandas bearing swastikas a cultural mix-up]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New religious movements ===
Besides the use as a religious symbol in Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism, which can be traced to pre-modern traditions, the swastika is also used by a number of [[new religious movements]] established in the modern period.

[[File:Raelian symbols.svg|right|upright |thumb|||The Raëlian symbol with the swastika (left) and the alternative version (right)]]
[[File:Falun Gong Logo.svg|thumb|upright |[[Falun Gong]] symbol]]
* The [[Raëlism|Raëlian Movement]], who believe that extraterrestrials originally created all life on earth, use a symbol that is often the source of considerable controversy: an interlaced [[star of David]] and a swastika. The Raelians state that the Star of David represents infinity in space whereas the swastika represents infinity in time—no beginning and no end in time, and everything being cyclic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.proswastika.org |title=Pro-Swastika |publisher=Pro-Swastika |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the symbol was changed to remove the swastika, out of respect to the victims of the [[Holocaust]], but as of 2007 has been restored to its original form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://raelianews.org/news.php?item.206.3 |title=The Official Raelian Symbol gets its swastika back |publisher=Raelianews |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Tantra]]-based movement [[Ananda Marga]] (Devanagari: आनन्द मार्ग, meaning ''Path of Bliss'') uses a motif similar to the Raëlians, but in their case the apparent star of David is defined as intersecting triangles with no specific reference to Jewish culture.{{citation needed|date=May 2016|reason=not mentioned in the main article}}
* The [[Falun Gong]] [[qigong]] movement uses a symbol that features a large swastika surrounded by four smaller (and rounded) ones, interspersed with [[yin and yang|yin-and-yang]] symbols. The usage is taken from traditional Chinese symbolism, and alludes to [[Dan Tian]], a [[chakra]]-like portion of the esoteric human anatomy, located in the stomach.
* The swastika is a holy symbol of [[Germanic Heathenry]], along with hammer of Thor and runes. This tradition—found in [[Scandinavia]], [[Germany]], and elsewhere—considers the swastika derived from a Norse symbol for the sun. Their use of the symbol has led people to accuse them of being a neo-Nazi group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Marijke Gijswijt-Hofstra|author2=Brian P.

'''Tactical litigation''' is a type of [[Lawsuit|litigation]] which is not used for the normal purposes of victory on the merits, but instead, to give expression to a tactical goal.&lt;ref name=friedman&gt;Lawrence M. Friedman, "Litigation and Its Discontents", in ''40 Mercer L. Rev. 973 (1988-1989)'', 981.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most well known uses of tactical litigation, is the use of [[Lawsuit|lawsuits]] for manufacturing delay, for example as an environmental authority to prevent a decision being taken to remove a wilderness area.&lt;ref name=friedman /&gt;

"'''The Extended Mind'''" by [[Andy Clark]] and [[David Chalmers]] (1998)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Andy Clark, David J Chalmers |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/3328150?sid=21105405194441&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=3739256&amp;uid=3739824&amp;uid=4 |title=The extended mind |journal=Analysis |volume=58 |issue=1 |date=January 1998 |pages=7–19 |doi=10.1093/analys/58.1.7}}; reprinted as: {{cite book |title= The Extended Mind |chapter=Chapter 2: The extended mind |author=Andy Clark, David J Chalmers |editor=Richard Menary, ed |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DxQNhOS8VjQC&amp;pg=PA27 |pages=27–42 |isbn= 9780262014038 |publisher=MIT Press |year=2010}}; and available on line as: {{cite web |title=The extended mind |author=Andy Clark, David J Chalmers  |url=http://cogprints.org/320/1/extended.html |publisher=Cogprints}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a seminal work in the field of [[extended cognition]]. In this paper, Clark and Chalmers present the idea of ''active externalism'' (similar to semantic or "content" [[Internalism and Externalism#Semantics|externalism]]), in which objects within the environment function as a part of the mind. They argue that it is arbitrary to say that the mind is contained only within the boundaries of the skull. The separation between the mind, the body, and the environment is seen as an unprincipled distinction. Because external objects play a significant role in aiding cognitive processes, the mind and the environment act as a "coupled system". This coupled system can be seen as a complete cognitive system of its own. In this manner, the mind is extended into the external world. The main criterion that Clark and Chalmers list for classifying the use of external objects during cognitive tasks as a part of an extended cognitive system is that the external objects must function with the same purpose as the internal processes.

In "The Extended Mind", a [[thought experiment]] is presented to further illustrate the environment's role in connection to the mind. The fictional characters Otto and Inga are both travelling to a museum simultaneously. Otto has [[Alzheimer's disease]], and has written all of his directions down in a notebook to serve the function of his memory. Inga is able to recall the internal directions within her memory. In a traditional sense, Inga can be thought to have had a belief as to the location of the museum before consulting her memory. In the same manner, Otto can be said to have held a belief of the location of the museum before consulting his notebook. The argument is that the only difference existing in these two cases is that Inga's memory is being internally processed by the brain, while Otto's memory is being served by the notebook. In other words, Otto's mind has been extended to include the notebook as the source of his memory. The notebook qualifies as such because it is constantly and immediately accessible to Otto, and it is automatically endorsed by him.

Going further, the authors ask and answer their own question about the role of enculturation:
:"And what about socially-extended cognition? Could my mental states be partly constituted by the states of other thinkers? We see no reason why not, in principle."

They bring up the recurrent theme of the role of language:
:"The major burden of the coupling between agents is carried by language ... Indeed, it is not implausible that the explosion of intellectual development in recent evolutionary time is due as much to this linguistically-enabled extension of cognition as to any independent development in our inner cognitive resources."

==Background==
The "extended mind" is an idea in the field of [[philosophy of mind]], often called [[extended cognition]], which holds that the reach of the mind need not end at the boundaries of skin and skull. Tools, instrument and other environmental props can under certain conditions also count as proper parts of our minds. Closely related topics often conjoined with the idea of "extended mind" are [[situated cognition]], [[distributed cognition]], and [[embodied cognition]].

==The extended mind and language==

In a book with the title ''The Extended Mind: The Emergence of Language, the Human Mind and Culture'', [[Robert K. Logan]] (2007) develops the thesis that verbal language extends the brain into a mind capable of conceptualization and hence the mind = brain + language. The human brain before it acquired verbal language according to this thesis is considered to be a percept processor. With language the mind is capable of conceptualization and hence able to consider things that are not immediately available in the here and now. The first words of verbal language are concepts associated with all the percepts associated with those words. For example the word water brings to mind the water we drink, the water we cook with, the water we wash with and the water we find in rivers, lakes and oceans and the water we find when it rains or when snow melts. Logan's thesis was first developed in a paper, "The extended mind: understanding language and thought in terms of complexity and chaos theory" presented at the 7th Annual Conference of The Society for Chaos Theory in Psychology and the Life Sciences at Marquette U., Milwaukee, Wisconsin on August 1, 1997.

'''''The Moral Maze''''' is a live discussion programme on [[BBC Radio 4]], broadcast since 1990. Since November 2011, it has also been available as a [[podcast]].

==Structure==
Four regular panellists discuss [[morality|moral]] and [[ethics|ethical]] issues raised by a recent news story. Michael Buerk delivers a [[preamble]] launching the topic, then a series of 'witnesses' - experts or other relevant people - are questioned by the panellists, who then discuss what each witness said.

==Panellists==
The regular panellists are:
* [[Claire Fox]]
* [[Giles Fraser]]
* [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]]
* Shiv Malik
* [[Anne McElvoy]]
* [[Laura Perrins]]
* [[Melanie Phillips]]
* [[Michael Portillo]]
* [[Mona Siddiqui]]
* [[Tim Stanley]]
* [[Matthew Taylor (Labour politician)|Matthew Taylor]]

The panellists mainly fall into two opposing camps of broadly centrist and right-wing viewpoints{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}, and the discussions hence often revolve around whether newer liberal values are eroding more traditional values.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This binary split is often complicated by differing philosophical views the panel hold which do not conveniently sit in a simple left-right political divide.

Notable former panellists include [[Rabbi]] [[Hugo Gryn]] (who died in 1996), [[Janet Daley]], [[Edward Pearce (journalist)|Edward Pearce]], [[Geoffrey Robertson]], [[Michael Mansfield]], politician [[Michael Gove]], [[Ian Hargreaves]], [[Kenan Malik]], scientist [[Steven Rose]], philosophers [[Simon Blackburn]] and [[Roger Scruton]], and historian [[David Starkey]], who often attracted controversy for his allegedly blunt manner.

==History==
The first programme on Monday 20 August 1990 was forty minutes long from 11{{nbsp}}am, and followed by ''[[Poetry Please]]''. It was made by the Factual Unit of Religious Programmes (later called Factual Programmes Religion) at [[BBC North]] in Manchester. It was hoped that the programme format would involve the panellists' views being revised during the course of a programme, but this rarely happened.

In April 1991, it had moved to Tuesdays, and followed the 9{{nbsp}}am news, until 9:45{{nbsp}}am (a slot similar to the current ''[[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]]''). In July 1991, it had moved to 8:05{{nbsp}}pm until 8:50{{nbsp}}pm on Fridays, replacing ''[[Any Questions?]]'' for the summer recess. There was then a repeat at 1{{nbsp}}pm on the following Saturday, and a phone-in from 2 to 2:30{{nbsp}}pm, replacing ''[[Any Answers?]]''. There was also an end-of-year programme. In July 1992, it had moved to Thursday mornings following the 9{{nbsp}}am news. It became a ''[[Costume de rigueur|de rigueur]]'' listen for Westminster MPs. By 1997, it was fifty-five minutes long, lasting until 10{{nbsp}}am. It moved to Wednesday evenings from 13 May 1998 in the 1998 schedule changes, with a repeat of the forty-five-minute programme on Saturday night at 10:15{{nbsp}}pm.

Michael Buerk has presented the programme since August 1990. [[David Aaronovitch]] presents occasional episodes during Buerk's absence. 

Originally produced at the [[BBC North West]]'s [[New Broadcasting House (Manchester)|New Broadcasting House]] on [[Wilmslow Road|Oxford Road]] in [[Manchester]], the programme production base is [[Salford Quays]]. The programme is broadcast live from [[BBC Broadcasting House]] in London.

===TV pilot===
In early 1994, a television version was considered, which eventually took off on Saturday 10 September 1994 on [[BBC2]] as a trial series of six 45-minute-long programmes broadcast around midnight, perhaps influenced by [[Channel 4]]'s successful late-night discussion programme ''[[After Dark (TV series)|After Dark]]''. The pilot had audiences of around 1.3 million. It was last broadcast on 15 October 1994 at 11{{nbsp}}pm.

==Criticism==
In his book ''Bad Thoughts'' (US title ''Crimes Against Logic''), libertarian philosopher [[Jamie Whyte]], who has been a witness on the programme, advises readers to listen to ''The Moral Maze'' for innumerable examples of faulty reasoning. Journalist and author Nick Cohen has also criticised the programme, in a piece highlighting the media careers of Trotskyite-turned-libertarian former cadres of the [[Revolutionary Communist Party (UK, 1978)|Revolutionary Communist Party]], centered around the [[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked magazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Nick|title=Wireless: Long March to the Microphone|url=http://standpointmag.co.uk/television-wireless-july-10-long-march-to-microphone-nick-cohen-radio-4-moral-maze|website=Standpoint Magazine|accessdate=8 February 2018|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Name of the Rose''''' ({{lang-it|Il nome della rosa}} {{IPA-it|il ˈnoːme della ˈrɔːza|}}) is the 1980 [[debut novel]] by [[Italy|Italian]] author [[Umberto Eco]]. It is a [[historical novel|historical]] [[murder mystery]] set in an Italian [[monastery]] in the year 1327; an intellectual mystery combining [[semiotics]] in fiction, biblical analysis, medieval studies and literary theory. It was translated into English by [[William Weaver]] in 1983.

The novel has sold over 50 million copies worldwide, becoming one of the [[List of best-selling books|best-selling books]] ever published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Name-of-the-Rose/Umberto-Eco/e/9780156001311 Library Journal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080921060952/http://search.barnesandnoble.com/The-Name-of-the-Rose/Umberto-Eco/e/9780156001311/ |date=2008-09-21 }} (no date)&lt;/ref&gt; It has received many international awards and accolades, such as the [[Strega Prize]] in 1981 and [[Prix Médicis|Prix Medicis Étrangère]] in 1982, and was ranked 14th on [[Le Monde's 100 Books of the Century|''Le Monde''{{'s}} 100 Books of the Century list]].

== Plot summary ==
In 1327, [[Franciscan|Franciscan friar]] [[William of Baskerville]] and Adso of [[Stift Melk|Melk]], a [[Benedictine]] [[Novice#Christianity|novice]] travelling under his protection, arrive at a Benedictine monastery in [[Northern Italy]] to attend a [[Disputation|theological disputation]]. This abbey is being used as an embassy between [[Pope John XXII]], and the Friars Minor, who are suspected of heresy. 

The monastery is disturbed by the death of Adelmo of Otranto, an illuminator revered for his illustrations. Adelmo was skilled at comical artwork, especially concerning religious matters. William is tasked by the monastery's [[abbot]], Abo of Fossanova to investigate the death, and he has a debate with one of the oldest monks in the abbey, Jorge of Burgos, about the theological meaning of laughter, which Jorge despises. 

The next day, a scholar of Aristotle and translator of Greek and Arabic, Venantius of Salvamec, is found dead in a vat of pig's blood. Previously, William and Adso had been prohibited from the library by the book keeper Malachi of Hildesheim, so they penetrate the labyrinth, discovering that there must be a hidden room, entitled the ''finis Africae.'' Bencio of Uppsala, a rhetoric scholar, reveals to William that Malachi, and his assistant Berengar of Arundel, had a homosexual relationship, until Berengar seduced Adelmo, who committed suicide out of religious shame. The only other monks who knew about the indiscretions were Jorge and Venantius.

By the day after, Berengar has gone missing, which puts pressure onto William. William learns of how Salvatore of Montferrat, and Remigio of Varagine, two cellarer monks, had a history with the [[Dulcinian|Dulcinian heretics]]. Meanwhile, Adso is seduced by a peasant girl, with whom he has his first sexual experience. After confessing to William, Adso is absolved, although he still feels guilty. Severinus of Sankt Wendel, the herbalist, tells William that Venantius's body had ink stains on the tongue and fingers, which suggests poison. William and Adso penetrate the library once more, discovering that Venantius had a book stolen from him, which they pursue. 

On the fourth day, Berengar is found drowned in a bath, although he bears ink stains similar to those of Venantius. Bernard Gui, a member of the [[Inquisition]], arrives to search for the murderer via Papal deduction. Due to this arrival, Gui arrests the peasant girl Adso loved, as well as Salvatore, accusing them both of heresy.

Remigio is interrogated by Gui, who scares him into revealing his heretic past, as well as falsely confessing to the crimes of the Abbey. Severinus then is found dead in his room, to which Jorge responds by leading a sermon about the coming of the Antichrist. 

Malachi returns to the early sermon that day near death, and his final words concern scorpions. Nicholas of Morimondo, the glazier, tells William that whoever is the librarian would then become the Abbot, and with new light, William goes to the library to search for evidence. The Abbot is distraught that William has not solved the crime, and that the Inquisition is undermining him, so he fires William. That night, William and Adso penetrate the library once more in search of the ''finis Africae.''

William and Adso discover Jorge waiting for them in the forbidden room. He says that he has been masterminding the Abbey for years, and his last victim is the Abbot himself, who has been led into the library. The Abbot suffocates, and Jorge tells them that Venantius's hidden book was [[Poetics_(Aristotle)|Aristotle's Second ''Poetics'']], which speaks of the virtues of laughter, something Jorge despises. Jorge poisoned the ink on the book, which is consumed when one turns the pages. Venantius was translating the book and died. Berengar found the body and disposed of it in pig's blood, fearing exposure, before reading the book himself and dying. Malachi was convinced by Jorge to retrieve the book, which was stashed with Severinus, so he kills Severinus and retrieves the book, before getting curious and dying as well. 

All of the murders time out with the [[Seven_trumpets|Seven Trumpets]], which call for objects falling from the sky (Adelmo threw himself from a tower), pools of blood, poison from water, bashing of the stars (Severinus was killed with his head bashed in with a celestial orb), scorpions, locusts, and fire. Jorge consumes the book's poisoned pages and uses Adso's lantern to start a fire, which burns down the library. As the fire spreads to the rest of the abbey, William laments his failure. Confused and defeated, William and Adso escape the abbey. Years later, Adso, now aged, returns to the ruins of the abbey and collects books that were salvaged from the fire, creating a lesser library.

== Major themes ==
{{essay-like|section|date=July 2011}}
Eco was a professor of [[semiotics]], and employs techniques of [[metanarrative]], partial fictionalization, and linguistic ambiguity to create a world enriched by layers of meaning. The solution to the central murder mystery hinges on the contents of [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|book on Comedy]], which has been [[Lost work|lost]]. In spite of this, Eco speculates on the content and has the characters react to it. Through the motif of this lost and possibly suppressed book which might have aestheticized the farcical, the unheroic and the skeptical, Eco also makes an ironically slanted plea for tolerance and against dogmatic or self-sufficient metaphysical truths—an angle which reaches the surface in the final chapters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lars Gustafsson]], postscript to Swedish edition ''The Name of the Rose''&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Name of the Rose'' has been described as a work of [[postmodernism]].&lt;ref name=butler&gt;[[Christopher Butler]]. ''Postmodernism: A Very Short Introduction''. [[OUP]], 2002. {{ISBN|978-0-19-280239-2}} — see pages 32 and 126 for discussion of the novel.&lt;/ref&gt; The quote in the novel, "books always speak of other books, and every story tells a story that has already been told", refers to a postmodern idea that all texts perpetually refer to other texts, rather than external reality, while also harkening back to the medieval notion that citation and quotation of books was inherently necessary to write new stories. The novel ends with irony: as Eco explains in his ''Postscript to the Name of the Rose'', "very little is discovered and the detective is defeated."&lt;ref name="postscript"&gt;"Postscript to the Name of the Rose", printed in ''The Name of the Rose'' (Harcourt, Inc., 1984), p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; After unraveling the central mystery in part through coincidence and error, William of Baskerville concludes in fatigue that there "was no pattern." Thus Eco turns the modernist quest for finality, certainty and meaning on its head, leaving the overall plot partly the result of accident and arguably without meaning.&lt;ref name=butler/&gt;

== The aedificium's labyrinth ==
The mystery revolves around the abbey library, situated in a fortified tower—the aedificium. This structure has three floors—the ground floor contains the kitchen and [[refectory]], the first floor a [[scriptorium]], and the top floor is occupied by the library.&lt;ref&gt;First Day, Terce, paragraph 37&lt;/ref&gt; The two lower floors are open to all, while only the librarian may enter the last. A catalogue of books is kept in the scriptorium, where [[manuscript]]s are read and copied. A monk who wishes to read a book would send a request to the librarian, who, if he thought the request justified, would bring it to the scriptorium. Finally, the library is in the form of a labyrinth, whose secret only the librarian and the assistant librarian know.&lt;ref&gt;First Day, Terce, paragraph 67&lt;/ref&gt;

The aedificium has four towers at the four cardinal points, and the top floor of each has seven rooms on the outside, surrounding a central room. There are another eight rooms on the outer walls, and sixteen rooms in the centre of the maze. Thus, the library has a total of fifty-six rooms.&lt;ref&gt;Third Day, Vespers, paragraphs 50-56&lt;/ref&gt; Each room has a scroll containing a verse from the [[Book of Revelation]]. The first letter of the verse is the letter corresponding to that room.&lt;ref&gt;Third Day, Vespers, paragraphs 64-68&lt;/ref&gt; The letters of adjacent rooms, read together, give the name of a region (e.g. [[Hibernia]] in the West tower), and those rooms contain books from that region. The geographical regions are:
[[File:Labyrinthus Aedificium.svg|thumb|The aedificium's labyrinth]]
* ''Fons Adae'', 'The earthly paradise' contains Bibles and commentaries, East Tower
* ''Acaia'', Greece, Northeast
* ''Iudaia'', Judea, East
* ''Aegyptus'', Egypt, Southeast
* ''Leones'', 'South' contains books from Africa, South Tower
* ''Yspania'', Spain, Southwest outer
* ''Roma'', Italy, Southwest inner
* ''Hibernia'', Ireland, West Tower
* ''Gallia'', France, Northwest
* ''Germania'', Germany, North
* ''Anglia'', England, North Tower
Two rooms have no lettering - the easternmost room, which has an altar, and the central room on the south tower, the so-called ''finis Africae,'' which contains the most heavily guarded books, and can only be entered through a secret door. The entrance to the library is in the central room of the east tower, which is connected to the scriptorium by a staircase.&lt;ref&gt;Fourth Day, After Compline&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title ==
Much attention has been paid to the mystery the book's title refers to. In fact, Eco has stated that his intention was to find a "totally neutral title".&lt;ref name="postscript"/&gt; In one version of the story, when he had finished writing the novel, Eco hurriedly suggested some ten names for it and asked a few of his friends to choose one. They chose ''The Name of the Rose''.&lt;ref name="onLiterature"&gt;[[Umberto Eco]]. ''On Literature''. Secker &amp; Warburg, 2005, p. 129-130. {{ISBN|0-436-21017-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In another version of the story, Eco had wanted the neutral title ''Adso of Melk'', but that was vetoed by his publisher, and then the title ''The Name of the Rose'' "came to me virtually by chance." In the ''Postscript to the Name of the Rose'', Eco claims to have chosen the title "because the rose is a symbolic figure so rich in meanings that by now it hardly has any meaning left".&lt;ref name="postscript" /&gt;

The book's last line, {{lang|la|"Stat rosa pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus"}} translates as: "the rose of old remains only in its name; we possess naked names." The general sense, as Eco pointed out,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Name of the Rose: Title and Last Line | url = http://www.umbertoeco.com/id-39/UmbertEco_Name_of_the_Rose_Umberto_Eco.html | accessdate = 2007-03-15 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070121024505/http://www.umbertoeco.com/id-39/UmbertEco_Name_of_the_Rose_Umberto_Eco.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; was that from the beauty of the past, now disappeared, we hold only the name. In this novel, the lost "rose" could be seen as [[Aristotle]]'s [[Poetics (Aristotle)|book on comedy]] (now forever lost), the exquisite library now destroyed, or the beautiful peasant girl now dead.

The title is also an allusion to the [[nominalist]] position in the [[problem of universals]], taken by [[William of Ockham]]. According to nominalism, universals are bare names: there is not a universal rose, only the name ''rose''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.crisismagazine.com/1987/war-of-the-rose-the-historical-context-of-the-name-of-the-rose&lt;/ref&gt;

This text has also been translated as "Yesterday's rose stands only in name, we hold only empty names." This line is a verse by twelfth century monk [[Bernard of Cluny]] (also known as Bernard of Morlaix). Medieval manuscripts of this line are not in agreement: Eco quotes one Medieval variant verbatim,&lt;ref&gt;Eco would have found this reading in, for example, the standard text edited by H.C. Hoskier (London 1929); only the Hiersemann manuscript preserves "Roma". For the verse quoted in this form before Eco, see e.g. Alexander Cooke, ''An essay on the origin, progress, and decline of rhyming Latin verse'' (1828), [https://books.google.com/books?id=u2_DthwIpvsC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=%22stat+rosa+pristina%22 p. 59], and Hermann Adalbert Daniel, ''Thesaurus hymnologicus sive hymnorum canticorum sequentiarum'' (1855), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6ScPAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=%22stat+rosa+pristina%22 p. 290]. See further Pepin, Ronald E. "Adso's closing line in The Name of the Rose." ''American notes and queries'' (May–June 1986): 151–152.&lt;/ref&gt; but Eco was not aware at the time of the text more commonly printed in modern editions, in which the reference is to [[Rome]] (''Roma''), not to a rose (''rosa'').&lt;ref&gt;As Eco wrote in [http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_author.html "The Author and his Interpreters"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101231523/http://www.themodernword.com/eco/eco_author.html |date=2008-01-01 }} "Thus the title of my novel, had I come across another version of Morlay's poem, could have been ''The Name of Rome'' (thus acquiring fascist overtones)".&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative text, with its context, runs: ''Nunc ubi Regulus aut ubi Romulus aut ubi Remus? / Stat Roma pristina nomine, nomina nuda tenemus''. This translates as "Where now is Regulus, or Romulus, or Remus? / Primordial Rome abides only in its name; we hold only naked names."&lt;ref name="cluny"&gt;See the source edition of 2009: Bernard of Cluny, De contemptu mundi: Une vision du monde vers 1144, ed. and trans. A. Cresson, Témoins de notre histoire (Turnhout, 2009), p.&amp;nbsp;126 (bk. 1, 952), and note thereto p.&amp;nbsp;257.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also the title of the book may be related to a poem by the Mexican poet and mystic [[Nun|Sor]] [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]] (1651–1695):
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Rosa que al prado, encarnada,&lt;br /&gt;
te ostentas presuntuosa&lt;br /&gt;
de grana y carmín bañada:&lt;br /&gt;
campa lozana y gustosa;&lt;br /&gt;
pero no, que siendo hermosa&lt;br /&gt;
también serás desdichada.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

which appears in Eco's ''Postscript to the Name of the Rose'', and is translated into English in "Note 1" of that book as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Red rose growing in the meadow,&lt;br /&gt;
you vaunt yourself bravely&lt;br /&gt;
bathed in crimson and carmine:&lt;br /&gt;
a rich and fragrant show.&lt;br /&gt;
But no: Being fair,&lt;br /&gt;
You will be unhappy soon.&lt;ref name="postscript" /&gt;&lt;!-- "soon", not "too", is the translation provided in Note 1; please do not alter it --&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Refimprove section|date=June 2010}}

=== To other works ===
The name of the central character, William of Baskerville, alludes both to the fictional detective [[Sherlock Holmes]] (compare ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]'' – also, Adso's description of William in the beginning of the book resembles, almost word for word, Dr. Watson's description of Sherlock Holmes when he first makes his acquaintance in ''[[A Study in Scarlet]]'') and to [[William of Ockham]] (see the next section). The name of the narrator, his apprentice Adso of Melk is among other things a pun on Simplicio from [[Galileo Galilei]]'s ''Dialogue''; Adso deriving from "ad Simplicio" ("to Simplicio"). Adso's putative place of origin, Melk, is the site of a famous medieval library, at [[Melk Abbey]]. And his name echoes the narrator of the Sherlock Holmes stories, Watson (omitting the first and last latters, with "t" and "d" being phonetically similar).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ipbOrcd8q9UC&amp;pg=PA257&amp;lpg=PA257&amp;dq|title=Reading Eco: An Anthology|editor-first=Rocco|editor-last=Capozzi|date=February 22, 1997|publisher=[[Indiana University Press]]|isbn=9780253112828}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The blind librarian Jorge of [[Burgos]] is a nod to [[Argentina|Argentinian]] writer [[Jorge Luis Borges]], a major influence on Eco. Borges was blind during his later years and was also director of [[National Library of the Argentine Republic|Argentina's national library]]; his [[short story]] "[[The Library of Babel]]" is an inspiration for the secret library in Eco's book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/44089369|title=The library of Babel|last=1899-1986.|first=Borges, Jorge Luis,|date=2000|publisher=David R. Godine|others=Desmazières, Erik, 1948-, Hurley, Andrew, 1944-, Giral, Angela.|isbn=156792123X|location=Boston|oclc=44089369}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another of Borges's stories, "[[The Secret Miracle]]", features a blind librarian. In addition, a number of other themes drawn from various of Borges's works are used throughout ''The Name of the Rose'': [[labyrinth]]s, mirrors, sects and obscure manuscripts and books.

The ending also owes a debt to Borges' short story "[[Death and the Compass]]", in which a detective proposes a theory for the behavior of a murderer. The murderer learns of the theory and uses it to trap the detective. In ''The Name of the Rose'', the librarian Jorge uses William's belief that the murders are based on the [[Revelation of John]] to misdirect William, though in Eco's tale, the detective succeeds in solving the crime.

The "poisoned page" motif may have been inspired by [[Alexandre Dumas]]' novel ''[[La Reine Margot (novel)|La Reine Margot]]'' (1845). It was also used in the film ''[[Il giovedì]]'' (1963) by Italian director [[Dino Risi]].&lt;ref name="Lolito"&gt;notes to {{cite book|title=Lolito|author=Daniele Luttazzi|pp=514–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar story is associated with the Chinese erotic novel ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]'', translated as ''The Golden Lotus'' or ''The Plum in the Golden Vase''.

Eco seems also to have been aware of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s short story "[[Debits and Credits (Kipling)|The Eye of Allah]]", which touches on many of the same themes, like optics, manuscript illumination, music, medicine, priestly authority and the Church's attitude to scientific discovery and independent thought, and which also includes a character named John of Burgos.

Eco was also inspired by the 19th century Italian novelist [[Alessandro Manzoni]], citing ''[[The Betrothed (Manzoni novel)|The Betrothed]]'' as an example of the specific type of historical novel he purposed to create, in which some of the characters may be made up, but their motivations and actions remain authentic to the period and render history more comprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postscript to The name of the rose|last=Umberto.|first=Eco,|date=1984|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|others=Eco, Umberto.|year=|isbn=9780151731565|edition=1st|location=San Diego|pages=|oclc=10996520}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the book, there are [[Latin]] quotes, authentic and apocryphal. There are also discussions of the philosophy of [[Aristotle]] and of a variety of [[Millenarism|millenarist]] heresies, especially those associated with the [[fraticelli]]. Numerous other philosophers are referenced throughout the book, often anachronistically, including [[Wittgenstein]].

=== To actual history and geography ===
[[File:La Sacra ammantata dalla neve.jpg|thumb|[[Sacra di San Michele|Saint Michael's Abbey]], in the [[Susa Valley]], [[Piedmont]]]]

William of Ockham, who lived during the time at which the novel is set, first put forward the principle known as [[Ockham's Razor]], often summarised as the ''[[dictum]]'' that one should always accept as most likely the simplest explanation that accounts for all the facts (a method used by William of Baskerville in the novel).

The book describes monastic life in the 14th century. The action takes place at a [[Benedictine]] abbey during the controversy surrounding the [[Apostolic poverty]] between branches of [[Franciscans]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]]; (see [[Franciscan#Renewed controversy on the question of poverty|renewed controversy on the question of poverty]]). The setting was inspired by monumental [[Sacra di San Michele|Saint Michael's Abbey]] in [[Susa Valley]], [[Piedmont]] and visited by Umberto Eco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avosacra.it/sito/curiosita_sulla_sacra.html|title=AVOSacra - Associazione volontari Sacra di San Michele|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=May 2014}} The Spirituals abhor wealth, bordering on the [[Apostolics]] or [[Dulcinian]] [[heresy]]. The book highlights this tension that existed within [[Christianity]] during the medieval era: the Spirituals, one faction within the Franciscan order, demanded that the Church should abandon all wealth, and some heretical sects began killing the well-to-do, while the majority of the Franciscans and the clergy took to a broader interpretation of the gospel. Also in the background is the conflict between [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis IV]] and [[Pope John XXII]], with the Emperor supporting the Spirituals and the Pope condemning them.

A number of the characters, such as the [[Inquisitor]] [[Bernard Gui]], [[Ubertino of Casale]] and the [[Minorite]] [[Michael of Cesena]], are historical figures, though the novel's characterization of them is not always historically accurate. Eco notes in a companion book that he had to situate the monastery in mountains so it would experience early frosts, in order for the action to take place at a time when the historical Bernard Gui could have been in the area. For the purposes of the plot, Eco needed a quantity of pig blood, but at that time pigs were not usually slaughtered until a frost had arrived. Later in the year, Gui was known to have been away from Italy and could not have participated in the events at the monastery.

Part of the dialogue in the inquisition scene of the novel is lifted bodily from the historical Gui's own Manual for Inquisitors, the ''Practica Inquisitionis Heretice Pravitatis'', for example the dialogue: "What do you believe?" "What do you believe, my Lord?" "I believe in all that the Creed teaches." "So I believe, my Lord." Bernardo then points out that what Remigius the cellarer is saying is not that Remigius believes in the Creed, but that Remigius believes that ''Bernardo'' believes in the Creed. This is an example given by the historical Gui in his book to warn inquisitors against the slipperiness and manipulation of words by heretics. This use of Gui's own book by Eco is self-consciously of a piece with his perspective that "books always speak of other books". In this case, the author integrates the historical Bernard Gui's text into his own through the fictional character of Bernardo.

Adso's description of the portal of the monastery is recognizably that of the portal of the church at [[Moissac|Moissac, France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=cJRV1c57xfgC&amp;pg=PA248&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=eglise+moissac+eco&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j21a4pin7R&amp;sig=DD4AIlhaW9YeYpObKApyUXvVsYE&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4-uj62f_YAhUxja0KHc0TBR4Q6AEIWjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=eglise%20moissac%20eco&amp;f=false|title=Signs of Change: Transformations of Christian Traditions and Their Representation in the Arts, 1000-2000|last=Petersen|first=Nils Holger|last2=Clüver|first2=Claus|last3=Bell|first3=Nicolas|date=2004|publisher=Rodopi|isbn=9042009993|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dante Alighieri]] and his ''[[Divine Comedy|Comedy]]'' are mentioned once in passing. There is also a quick reference to a famous "Umberto of Bologna"—Umberto Eco himself.

'''Victor Ovcharenko''' ({{lang-ru|Ви́ктор Ива́нович Овчаре́нко}}; February 5, 1943 – May 5, 2009) was a Russian [[philosopher]], [[sociologist]], [[historian]] and [[psychologist]]. He also was a PhD., professor, academician of the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences (1997), academician of the Academy for Humanities Research (1998) and academician of the Academy of Pedagogical and Social Sciences (2000). He co-edited the journals "The Psychoanalytical Bulletin", "The Bulletin of [[Psychoanalysis]]", etc. He was a forerunner (with V.S. Stepin) of the Minsk philosophical school "Humanities Encyclopedia". He is considered one of the founders of modern Belarusian [[sociology]].

==Biography==
In 1969 he graduated from the historical department of the [[Belarusian State University]] (BSU). After finishing post-graduate study at the chair of philosophy of BSU he wrote his doctoral thesis "Critical analysis of the personality theory of [[Freud|Freud's]] psychoanalytical system" (1973, BSU). From 1972 to 1982 he worked as a lecturer, a senior lecturer, and an assistant professor of the chair of [[philosophy]] at the BSU.

In 1982-1983 he was an assistant professor of the chair of philosophy at the Refresher Institute for Lectures of Social Sciences of the BSU. From 1983-1987 he worked as an assistant professor of the chair of philosophy at the Refresher Institute for Lecturers of Social Sciences of [[Moscow State University]], named after M.V. Lomonosov.

In 1987 he was an assistant professor and later a professor (1995) of the chair of philosophy at [[Moscow State Linguistic University]]. His doctoral thesis was "Genesis, Foundations, Forms and Tendencies of [[Sociological Psychologism]] Development as a Phenomenon of Social Thought" (1995, MSU).

==Scientific achievements==
The scientific achievements of V.Ocharenko connect sociological psychologism, the problems of [[Personality psychology|personality]] and [[interpersonal relations]], the contents and models of mind; history, the theory and methodology of [[psychoanalysis]] and post-freudism, the human dimensions of world history, [[Social alienation|alienation]] and humanism, the history of philosophy, sociology and psychology; [[metaphilosophy]] and methods of teaching philosophy.

He proved that the creation of the [[Western world|Western]] and Eastern versions of conceptual [[humanism]] were one of the first socially significant results of systematic [[philosophical]] activity in the [[Ancient]] world.

He researched [[paradigms]] and trends of classical and modern social thought. In 1990 he elaborated the foundations of the [[sociological psychologism]]— "concept that regards action and interaction of social, group and individual [[psychical]] factors as a premise of research and explanation of [[social]] phenomena and processes" .&lt;ref&gt;Ovcharenko V.I., Gritsanov A.A., "Sociological Psychologism. Critical Analysis", p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 V.Ovcharenko initiated the campaign to return original documents and materials about the history of the Russian Psychoanalytical movement to [[Russia]].

In 1994 he published the "Psychoanalytical [[Glossary]]" — the first Russian language edition of a dictionary and reference book on psychoanalysis that presented systematized data on the history of psychoanalysis, its ideas and leaders, terminology, founding documents, classical and modern schools and theories. He has marked out three principal stages in the development of classical psychoanalysis: 1) Clinical (1896—1905), 2) Psychological (1905—1913) and 3) [[Metaphysics|Metaphysical]] (1913—1939).

In 1996 V.Ovcharenko worked out the first historical periods of the Russian psychoanalysis and psychoanalytical movement. With Russian psychoanalyst [[Leibin, Valery Moiseevich|V.Leibin]], he published "The [[Anthology]] of Russian Psychoanalysis" (in two volumes) describing the first century of Russian psychoanalytical ideas.

V.Ovcharenko introduced the categories of "sociological psychologism", "conceptual problematic complex", "conceptual problematic associations", "latent and contact world history", "dispersed rational sphere", "dispersed psychoanalytical sphere", "multibasisness of a person", etc. He published about 1500 articles in different countries. These include more than 700 biographies of philosophers, sociologists, psychologists and psychoanalysts.  He also wrote articles in Russian and foreign journals, encyclopedias and dictionaries.&lt;ref&gt;"The History of Philosophy. Encyclopedia", p.730.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Zafu.jpg|thumb|right|A typical kapok-filled ''zafu'']]
A '''''zafu''''' ({{lang-ja|座蒲}}, {{IPA-ja|d͡zaɸɯ|pron}}) or '''''putuan''''' ({{zh|c=蒲团}}, &lt;small&gt;pronounced&lt;/small&gt; {{IPAc-cmn|p|u|2|.|t|uan|2}}) is a round [[cushion]]. Although also a utilitarian accessory, it is  best known for its use in [[zazen]] [[Zen]] [[meditation]].

==Name==
Although ''zafu'' is often translated as "sewn seat" in American English, the meaning of the Japanese [[kanji]], 座蒲, is different. ''Za'' (座) means "seat", and ''fu'' (蒲) means [[reedmace]] (cattail, ''[[Typha]]'' spp.). A ''zafu'' is a seat stuffed with the fluffy, soft, downy fibres of the disintegrating reedmace seed heads. The Japanese zafu originates in China, where these meditation seats were originally filled with reedmace down.

The words ''[[zabuton]]'', ''zafuton'' and ''[[futon]]'' are closely linked.  The word ''[[zazen]]'' meaning "seated meditation" or "sitting meditation" is also closely linked. In western terms, colloquially speaking, ''zafu'' refers to a meditation cushion, and ''zabuton'' refers to the cushioned mat upon which a zafu is placed.

==Construction==
Typical zafus are  about {{Convert|35|cm|0}} in diameter,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dogensangha.org.uk/IBPZ/IBPZ-English.pdf Introduction to Buddhism and the Practice of Zazen] page 14&lt;/ref&gt; and often about {{Convert|20|cm|0}} high when fluffed.
Contemporary zafus are sewn from three pieces of heavy cloth, usually colored black: two round swatches of equal size for the top and the bottom of the cushion, and a long rectangle that is sewn into gathers in between. They are typically filled with either [[Ceiba pentandra|kapok]] (a fluffy plant fibre, similar to Typha) or [[buckwheat]] hulls. [[Zen]] [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practitioners traditionally sit on a zafu when engaged in [[zazen|sitting meditation]]. The cushion raises the hips, making the entire range of cross-legged sitting positions more stable for the meditator.

==Use in zazen==
Before and after practicing [[zazen]], Zen practitioners perform a [[gassho]] bow to the zafu, to fellow practitioners, and to the teacher. In many practice places, there is a prescribed form for respectfully handling zafu while walking in the meditation hall, or [[zendo]].

[[Image:zabutonstore.jpg|thumb|right|A typical kapok-filled zabuton]]
A [[zabuton]] ({{lang-ja|座布団}}, {{IPA-ja|d͡zabɯtoɴ|}}) is a rectangular cushion, about {{Convert|76|cm|0}} by {{Convert|71|cm|0}}, that is often used under a zafu cushion to provide comfort and support when engaged in zazen.  The outer cover is typically made of a heavy duty fabric and has a zipper along one side so that it can be easily removed and washed. Inside the cover, the batting is enclosed in a natural cotton casing.

The '''Zen Group of Western Australia''' (ZGWA) is an organization of lay [[zen]] practitioners located in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], [[Western Australia]].

== Affiliation and practice ==

The ZGWA is formally affiliated with the [[Diamond Sangha]] tradition of [[Zen Buddhism]], which was founded in [[Hawaii]] in 1959 by [[Robert Aitken Roshi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diamondsangha.org/Who%20we%20are.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 11, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815033918/http://diamondsangha.org/Who%20we%20are.htm |archivedate=August 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In keeping with Diamond Sangha tradition, the ZGWA uses rituals from both the Soto and Rinzai schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bisbeelotussangha.org/historydiamond.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Mediation practices of [[Shikantaza]] from the [[Sōtō]] school and [[koan]] training from the [[Rinzai]] school are typical forms of practise employed by students in the group, under the guidance of the groups roshi.

== Teachers ==
[[File:Arthur Wells and Ross Bolleter 01.JPG|thumb|Ross Bolleter (right) after the transmission ceremony for Arthur Wells]]
ZGWA's senior teacher is [[Ross Bolleter Roshi]], who supervises new Zen teachers and assists with the founding of new groups throughout [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].
